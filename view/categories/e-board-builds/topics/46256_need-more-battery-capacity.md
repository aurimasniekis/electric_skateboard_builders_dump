okay guys I weight about 300 pounds and I‚Äôm 6‚Äô1 right now I‚Äôm running dual 6374 motors and 4 3s 5000mah in series and I only get 7miles on my battery‚Äôs what can I do to get more time on my ride

Lipos can only take you so far and have limits to capity and if you wiegh that much your going to want  
18650 cells, instead if your not content with 7 miles if your 300pounds and are trying to get 10-15 miles at least 12s4p -12s5p 30q.

Honestly as a community if we stopped responding to this posts or only responded with ‚Äúuse the search function‚Äù, it would help to curb the problem (I think)

In all seriousness, do go read through the starter threads, there's a lot of good information there. Your current battery has about 220 watt-hours of capacity. By increasing the size of your cells, or the number of cells in parallel, you can increase your overall energy content of your battery pack. More energy=more miles.

You should also take a closer look at your setup, including controller settings, etc, since you're getting really terrible efficiency. A 220Wh pack should get you at least 15 miles.

only way to extend range is to increase capacity. only way to increase capacity is find a more dense chemistry, or increase the parallel count in your pack.  the former is less likely until new ground is broken on battery technology (putting my money on solid state liion). so your best option for now is throwing more batteries, therefore money, at it.

so lets take your 3x4s lipo, attempting to increase P count means you'll double number of lipos, it starts to get messy.

its pricy to convert to liions cells but it would be the least painful and easier way to get what you need, namely more watthours.

Calm down bro... Take a look from our perspective, we get newbie post very often and they are really basic problems that can be easily looked up in the search engine. You would feel the same if you stayed around for a while and people ask the same basic questions over and over again. We are just advising new people to this forum to do a fair bit of private research before turning to human resource. :pray:t2::grinning:

We are frustrated because it seems that you have little interest In the vast knowledge that there is in community and u are asking the most basic questions ever that can be found In the search function which it seems you have yet to find out it exist. Which thus it gets old to see thread after thread people like you who don't read and rather want a tech support.

Calculating the range is basic algebra:
wh(watt-hours) = # of series X 3.7 X mah / 1000
wh is directly related to the range so twice the wh = twice the range
You can also calculate your riding efficiency is by doing wh(of your battery) / mi(total on one charge)

[/quote]
They are relatively safer and in some cases less expensive and they have a lower capacity degredation. If you are looking for 18650 packs, you can look them up on the forum. We have people here that make fully equiped battery kits.

There more reliable than lipos that's for sure just there current draw is not the best its the trade off so you have to stack them past 3p your good like I said a 12s4p or 12s5p should do u good. It would be plug and play for charging wise just a charger port , nothing to pull apart just a hole in the enclosure for the charger port

Difference is tho that they would take forever like month lead time for that, I'd rather have @barajabali do my batteries now he's gain a forever customer, I'd pay the extra to have Baja do it instead of waiting the same time and having them thicker. But sending this guy to Baja the never ending questions he would ask maybe TB then there use to being annoyed.

Seems like to much welds(uneducated guess). Also I hate battery spacers make battery packs to thick, my TB 12s4p was bigger than a 12s6p 30q without battery spacers.
That or TB layers the Shit out of their batteries for it to be stupid proof.

I am using a lot of welds to ensure maximum contact and strength(uneducated guess). I like battery spacers in that they provide convenient and somewhat more rigid support for the cells, but density is something I sometimes consider too.

He is right in the sense of liability, what if something goes wrong will you be able to pay for the refund or fix it, quality control proper equipment. Getting sued stuff like that . Nothing against your buttriding or anything, but scepterr does have a valid point

If you need more capacity then you will need more batteries in parallel.  By increasing the P you will gain range.  Generally you want 3 or 4p to give you decent range, some guys here have 5 and 6p. There are several guys who could make you a pack here and you can choose how you would like it set up as far as dimensions go.  I would not suggest you doing the spot welds yourself unless you have previous knowledge of it as if you search board fire you will find plenty of threads of boards on fire most are caused by not properly doing the packs.

@Thatdudedominic, forget your weight and build, it's all about energy stored in the type of battery your using, and what it can safely discharge at.
1st thing you need to do is post a link to the 3s 5000mah LiPO you're using, that way we can see it's specs and advise better.

the suggestion to use 18650 cells isn't necessarily a good one without determining your competence with battery's. Yes they are generally the preferred battery type, but you'd either need to wire & weld them yourself or buy from a proper battery maker, and compared to LiPo's, it isn't cheap.

Absolute easiest way to increase range is to either buy another set of what you've got, or buy bigger batteries.

Currently your WH is --- 5 x (3.7 x 12) = 222WH
Assuming your LiPo's are 30C, 5000 * 30 \ 1000 = 150 Max Amps discharge

A Samsung 30q 12s4p pack would be (3 x 4) x (3.6 x 12) = 518.4WH
Max Discharge amps would be (15 * 4) = 60A Max discharge (advertised max discharge is 15A)

The difference in the amps that the above 2 solutions can (reasonably) output does have a worthwhile impact, so as a complete off-the-cuff guess i'd say the 12s4p Li-Ion pack would would give you twice the range.

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-compact-5000mah-4s-25c-lipo-pack.html
6 of these as a 12s2p LiPo pack would give you 444WH and (5000 * 25 \ 1000 *2) a 250A max discharge

So Im about to get my fourth 3s 25c 5000mah lipo battery. Is there a way I could connect them in series and parallel ? Don't really need to go to fast something like 18mph is fine, I just want more range.

With only 4 packs, you can't distribute them in parallel other than 2 series 2 parallel, which is only 6s. Having a higher voltage is just giving the potential for more speed, you can do speed restrictions on VESC if you really worry about it.

Speed I could handle, just not to worried about it. Don't really see no reason to go that fast atm. But what your saying it'll be 6s2p10ah. That's only like 11miles range üòê I need to stop being lame and get some 5s 8ah lipos since it'll only cost me like $160 for both

Cough Cough *Save up for li-on pack.* 
Uh what was I saying? Oh yea, range is only improved by having more packs. Parallel or series distribution does not affect the range. If 6s2p is only 11 miles, 12s1p should still be 11 miles. :neutral_face:

You have four 3s batteries. In series.  Giving you 12s1p.  

The only thing you can do is buy four more of the same kind.  That would make the same 12s1p.  Then you take those combined in parallel with your other four you get 12s2p
