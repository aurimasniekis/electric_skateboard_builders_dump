Hello,

This year I have been working on designing and buiding an all terrain electric skateboard with independent suspension for hobby. As an mechanical engineer I liked to make my own design and realize it. When I was happy with the design I started to build the project. I wanted to build an electric skateboard that is able to ride in all terrain, so I choosed to use big wheels on it. I added my own design of independent suspension to create an unique driving experience while riding offroad instead of using normal skateboard trucks. the board is connected with steering rods to steer with all the 4 wheels. Extra springs are used to reposition the board to the middle after steering.

Now the board is ready I like to show it to you. The Lipo battery and motor controller are placed invisable in the frame. the 800W brushed motor gives the board more than enough power and torque and reaches a topspeed about 30km/h. I choosed consciously to use an brushed motor because the size of the motor was not a problem on this build. 
I hope you like it!

I'd love to see a pic with someone on it at full lean.

I'm curious about the turn radius, as typical mountain boards turn like a school bus.

Thanks for the great comments! Nice to hear the enthusiasm!

The board is able to make sharp turns. After I builded the board it turned sharper as wished, so i adjusted the arm that controls the steering, so now it makes a smaller swing what results in less steering. Also the wheel camber and the line of the wheels is adjustable.

I will make a video to show it in action. I also will show the streering at full lean in it.

Further, a response to Kane: Yes I made the parts by myself, I will look for photos of the work in progress. I used modern production techniques to build the parts.

Today we made an video of the board in action!

For information, this is not topspeed driving. I don't have a lot of boarding experience :wink:
The speed on the road is about half the topspeed.

 I hope you like it!

Thanks!

A response to bigben: It does not use servos for steering. Steering works the same as on a normal skateboard. It only has an stepless controller for controlling the motor. The board is connected with the steering system on the wheels by a pendulum inside the frame. Leaning moves the pendulum what results in steering.

This is really amazing what you did but what is the advantage over normal skateboard trucks? Would be nice to see a video about steering, I mean where we can see how tight the curves are possible. How stable is your suspension at higher speed? No wobbling at all? Did you ever try a normal mountainboard for comparison? For sure your suspension adapts better to the ground then a normal one. Don't get me wrong, I really like your board but is this made just for fun or does it really have big advantages over normal trucks?

same questions basically. From the video, it looks like the board is really sensitive and that it requires relatively little force/pressure from the feet to turn. Around 44 seconds in, I also noticed the board quickly swirling to the right. Not sure if the board tracks easily, or if it simply requires more practice.

I see vids of people bombing down mountains at four times the speed I am currently going and I know my own skills are setting the limits of the relatively simple design of a mountain board, not necessarily the components I am using. Then there is the added weight of such complexity, which could have a negative influence on handling.

No doubt, this thing will tackle any terrain, just because of the wheel size and clearance alone. Perfect for beaches etc. Engineering marvel for sure. Different design for different purposes.

Thanks for the comments! 

I like to answer the questions, so don't be afraid to ask them!:smile: 

_Is there an advantage over normal skateboard trucks?_
If wished to ride for performance, for example extreme driving with high speeds and jumps a normal skateboard system will be absolutely better, they are simple, light weight, reliable and proven. Also you only need a board and not a frame. It was not the goal to beat the traditional board by performance, but to build something difference, and look with another view to skateboarding. So are the trucks an advantage for performance? No it is not an performance advantage, It is different but works very well, for cruising and fun driving through offroad paths it's works fine. 

From telnoi:
_it looks like the board is really sensitive and that it requires relatively little force/pressure from the feet to turn. Around 44 seconds in, I also noticed the board quickly swirling to the right. Not sure if the board tracks easily, or if it simply requires more practice_

This was my first time riding it on a mountainbike path, riding onroad is way easier than the offroad paths.:grin: I use springs on both sides to hold the board in the straight position, There has to be a balance between steering at low speed and steering at high speed. By using stiffer springs the board can't steer in his max steering position what I use on lower speed. By driving on high speed you don't want that the board is steering sensitive because than you can loose the balance if the board is steering sharp. I adjusted the springs and also the pendulum to get a balance between this. A wish is to add oil dampers to the steering system in the future. This prevents the possibility of suddenly steering at higher speeds what can result in a wobble and loosing balance. Now it is is fine to drive it with 20- 23km/h average. (measured by gps).

About the weight:
The total weight including battery is 27,2 kg. 

_any problem with torque steering using just the one motor? i'm wondering if that insanely awesome suspension helps with that._
One motor works fine by normal use. Only on very loose sand it is ofcours harder to accelerate. Accelarating offroad on a normal forest path is not a problem. For performance 2 motors is ofcourse always better. 

So in general, The board is intended for fun, to have a new view on skateboarding. To challenge myself to design a good working special type of electric skateboard. When I was young I skateboarded a lot and past year I found this forum on the internet. I saw the great electric boards on this forum what motivated me to build this board.:grin:. So I want to thank you all for the great inspiration on this forum!

Great job!  With the steering, how much of a problem is bump steer?  In other words, if suspension compression occurs during a turn does it change the steering angle?
```

Hello There!

Steering while the suspension is compressed is the same as steering with uncompressed suspension.I designed the steeringrods in the steering system as parallel as possible together with the support arms. Desiging the steering rods parallel with the support arms will give the smallest angular rotation as possible. 
So if the springs are uncompressed, aswel compressed the steering rods rotates together (in vertical direction) with the support arms and stay parallel. Only than there is no rotation as result of compressing the springs. 

Iff the wheather permits maybe I make another video now I have a bit more experience with the board. I'm still riding with it and have great fun. Iff I make the video I can show the suspension more detailed and show the max sharpness of steering.

Greetings!

Would be cool to see how the suspension works in action. Is it possible for you to mount the camera facing the board or just get a 'selfie stick' for camera?..

Otherwise.. happy riding :)

Hi There,

It is time for me to start with an new project, so i am thinking of selling the board.
I had a lot of fun with building and riding it, but my biggest hobby is still to design and build cool things like this board.

For information:
This board is not a toy, it can be dangerous and reach high speeds. It is not recommended for kids.  To maintain the board, you need to be a bit technical. The board is not a product, but an project. 
Further the board is as good as new.

If you are interested feel free to send me an personal message on this forum. 
I don't need to sell it, it only will be sold for a fair price. 
For the time it only can be picked up in the Netherlands.

A picture how it is today:

very cool! like a diy baja board.

Thanks.

I had good contacts to produce the parts that are needed, so it doesn't have to be that expensive.
The sheetmetal is indeed laser cutted. Other parts are machined and welded. 
It has a single motor and works fine. (more than powerfull enough, see video)
