**Updated** - Completed Boosted Poke. More details on the updated post.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/4/d48df6ef87a34599cbded466bf5c8d6ac536dccc.JPG" width="619" height="500"> 

After the first DIY build with long 41" deck and 107mm wheels, I wanted to make another esk8 for commuting purpose that has much lighter weight and is smaller to carry. Then I was looking at someone who transplanted their boosted board V1 into the Loaded poke deck. It seemed really cool but I wanted to make one under the $900AUD ($702USD) budget, so buying boosted board ($2100AUD) + Loaded deck ($270AUD) for transplant wasn't an option for me. Instead, I decided to try another DIY build challenge :smile:

  **My aim for this build were:**
 - **Authentic look** : Clean build that look very similar to original boosted board 
 - **Performance as good as original BB** : Aim to reach 10km range with decent speed (23mph+ or 37km/h+) but weigh less than 7kg to carry easily.
 - **Uphill climb ability** : I live in hilly area so I decided to go for 13T/38T pulley gearing. I probably need to replace belts for the different length as well.


 **Part purchased (exc. shipping cost):** 
 - Loaded Poke Deck ($270AUD)
 - Loaded Mounting screw ($11AUD)
 - Orangatang Kegel 80mm 80A Orange x 4 ($90AUD)
 - Venom Bushings x 2 ($22AUD)
 - M5 Rivet bushings ($6AUD)
 - Evolve 38T wheel pulley for Kegel wheels x2 ($60AUD)
 - Yeeplay Enclosure ($20AUD)
 - Samsung 18650 10S2P battery from Yeeplay ($96AUD)
 - DIYeboard Dual Belt Drive 1400W*2 N5055 Kit ($190AUD)
 - DIYeboard Dual Belt Drive ESC ($100AUD)
 - Supreme sticker ($3AUD) :wink:
 - Polytuf Water-resistant foam from bunnings ($5AUD)
 - Psycho 1/4" Shock-pad ($8AUD)
 - Other extra acc. ($14AUD) 

 **Total cost : $895AUD** (equals to $699USD)

 So just got the Loaded Poke deck. I wanted to put a rivet nuts and wires underneath the griptape just like the original BB so I've used hair dryer to gentle pull the griptape.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/a/9ac8abbfb8368d7d07297595cd6069a0625b4162.jpg" width="740" height="560">

 When I pulled the griptape successfully, I used sticker storage paper to temporary store the griptape so I can re-use it later after all the wiring, drilling work.


 For my first DIY esk8 board, I just used hand-drill but the screw hole locations were not perfectly accurate. So I used the CNC machine this time to make sure every screw hole is aligned. I also CNC-drill the wire slots from Battery enclosure to ESC enclosure, I've used 14AWG wire for extension battery cable and the slot is 3mm deep. I didn't want to drill too deep because Loaded Poke deck was thinner than the other deck I've had so I was worried if I would make the deck weaker by drilling too much. 3mm seemed like an optimal depth for the wire slot. Also Loaded Poke deck is concaved so rivet nuts were not fitting in fully (This case, the rivet nuts will lift up and the trace will be shown on the griptape). So I had to CNC-cut the surface flat around the rivet nuts area as well.

 Here are some photos after the CNC-drilling work:

 Now putting back the griptape that I took out before..

 <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/d/ddb845723e21313e64c2f8d6b7646763e4f72c2b.jpg" width="740" height="560">

 I was pretty happy with the result. I couldn't see the trace of wires or the rivet nuts on the griptape. Just looks like a normal longboard. Loaded Poke deck came with the pre-cut griptape and there were some area where grip tape is sticking outside of the deck. so I had to trimmed a bit of griptape using razor blade.

 I am still waiting for the evolve 38T wheel pulleys to arrive. Evolve is on a holiday so I need to wait few more days to finish the build. While waiting for the parts, I just tried putting everything together to see what it'd look like when I finish the build. 

 <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/4/7436000033e59ee450364fdaaeb8dfede2b0627c.jpg" width="740" height="560">

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/d/7defe882ee37f83925491fa0208d10969da92cc2.jpg" width="740" height="560">

 I think it'd look fantastic when I finish the build :slight_smile: Looks clean and original BB alike.

 The enclosure is from Yeeplay board. I really likes this enclosure because ESC enclosure looks so much similar to the original BB. Bottom plate is made out of metal which will work as a heat-shrink. Battery enclosure is for 10S2P size (little-bit shorter but wider than BB style enclosure) and it seems perfect for Loaded Poke build. I also have Yeeplay M1 board which is really fun to ride, I will upload a reviewing video of Yeeplay board soon as well.

 I will update a post of the build once Evolve 38T pulley arrives :blush: 

 Stay tuned for more updates for Boosted Poke Replica build!

 I got the battery and enclosure from Yeeplay. It's just a 10S2P 22P which is cheaper than 25R or 30Q. However, Rex from Yeeplay gave me a good discount on battery. Enclosure has plenty of space, I think you can put 12S2P easily or even possibly 10S3P if I sand a enclosure abit.

 **Updates #2** 

 Evolve Kegel pulley came. Time to dremel rear trucks to fit the new pulley.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/6/b6c822f2ce8c740852ef76dd9f9fe982cd5d69a9.jpg" width="740" height="555">

 Rear truck is from DIYeboard. I had to cut upto the motor mount part. The 8mm axle had those grip grains so I had to sand down flat so bearing can fit through.

```
 I am located in Melbourne :) I have Evolve/ABEC11 107mm Superfly on my another electric skateboard because I thought 80mm wheels would be too small to roll over the branches and debris.  However, I got 80mm kegels on this build because I wanted to reduce the weight as much as possible. After riding for 30~40mins, I couldn't feel much difference in riding on footpath compared to 107mm wheels. It definitely rides much better than 83mm flywheel clones that came with the DIYeboard dual belt kit. It probably wouldn't make the rough gravel surface though.

I really should get some 107's, my 83mm enertion clones are really hard and make my feet numb. What are roads like down there, do you have the really chunky bitumen stuff like here?

```
There are some bitumen (maybe about 6mm~10mm in diameter big) but mainly a lot of wood branches. I haven't really tried 83mm enertion wheels but 80mm Kegel feels much smoother and better than 83mm clone wheels. It make much less noise when riding on footpath, 107mm feels pretty much the same but just makes the ride smoother (you feel less bumps) imo.

I'm really interested in this - I just bought a Loaded Poke and am looking to do a very similar build - what is the range that you can get from a 10s2p with LG HG2s?

I am thinking of the same or 10s3p with HG2 or 30Q, running a single 6374 190kv motor, but wondering which side of the trade off between weight/size and range I should go down. Any thoughts are welcome!

## \#24 Posted by: creat0r5 Posted at: 2018-04-26T09:07:39.109Z Reads: 227

Range is about 9km in my area (a lot of up and down hills) using 10S2P Samsung 22P batteries. I had another esk8 with single 6374 build. The weight was quite similar vs dual 5060 build. I prefer the dual 5060 because it has better traction, better brakes and I could go over the grass easier. Single 6374 on the other hand, gave me a better range on a same battery setup.

Hi sunnyD, thanks for the reply. Yep it's holding up pretty well. I believe this board now has at least 200km+ mileage. The only part I've been replaced was a set of bearing and motor-phase wire connector. Otherwise, I haven't any issue. I will post a follow-updates post soon.

 It's on the updated post #2. I used Evolve pulley which is different from the kegel kit from DIYelectricskateboard. You basically use the hack-saw and cut some of the rear truck to increase the width of 8mm axle.

Hey I was going to message you outside this thread but I am new and I am struggling to figure out how.

I am trying to build my own electric longboard, and I had decided on the poke deck before having even seen this. I am consequently trying to use yours as a guide.

I understand the general build, thanks to your post. But I am a total greenhorn at this, and as a new electric skateboard builder, many petty details remain unclear.

What is the difference between a ESC/VESC? also, many of the prices you list appear to be wrong/no longer correct. Also, you don't list any remote, which is something I am unsure about. Moreover, you list materials like the water-resistant foam, the shock pads, yet Im not sure how you use them. Also- can you speak more to the dremeling of the truck?

sorry for the soooo late reply, I rarely visit this website here. You bascially need to use dremel or saw to cut off the aluminium block part of the rear truck to make the axle longer (so there's enough room for evolve's kegel pulley to go in).

Really depends on your weight and the bushing setup but you may need a riser as I am using a 6mm soft riser for 80mm kegel and have about 3~4mm clearance when I try to turn sharp.

 I think there's a lot of discussion posts regarding the difference between ESC/VESC. I used ESC above because I've already tried using VESC before and just wanted to try something different. Price may no longer be correct because it's been more than a year. Lastly, you just need to dremel the aluminium block of the truck. Pretty much cut it off except the axle part where the pulley/wheel sits in. Cutting width was easy because cutting point was exactly where the motor mounts starts to sit on the truck. Thanks
