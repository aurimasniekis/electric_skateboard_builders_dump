Always,I find more fans for Marvel characters than DC :pensive: since I have been working with only DC Characters at work, Why? Because they are cooler!  I am dying to work on a project like DC VS Marvel.:grinning:

So, I decided to make one with Iron Man Themed.   
@TonyStark, message me if you want one!   

**Motor Mount**
I would start with designing Motor Mount,  I liked the idea of angle adjustment capability from DIY Electric Skateboard but using the lock nuts.

I am using 5mm thick fiberglass panel.

I printed the wheel pulley with Taulman 3D TECH-G 3D,it is suppose to give tensile strength of 5900 PSI.

You can find the pulley here http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mbs-all-terrain-longboard-wheels-36-38-40-42-44-48-50-tooth-pulley-stl-files-for-9mm-12mm-15mm-belt/8518. Thanks for the file @JuniorPotato93  It fits great!

It will be 17/42/149KV. I am looking for little more torque with MBS all terrain wheels than what I currently have(14/36/213kv).  I was only able to find 17 teeth motor pulley for 15mm wide.

Why?  You are obviously ridiculously skilled and have the tools - why wouldn't you use vacuum when laminating CF to wood if you have them?  it'll be lighter/stronger/etc...

Laminating/skinning a perfectly fine wooden deck with CF is mainly for the look, so strength isn't my concern, but the weight is. 
I guess the extra resin and cloth weight should be very minimal I'll find out.  I might do the cutout for the deck to compensate the weight. It depends on how cold my garage is ha :confounded:

hey, i was just wondering what technique you used to mount your balancing port (and for other ports for that matter...)?  looks like you got some kind of gasket for the 11pin balance port.

found this technique, would this work?

That looks like a good idea.

I used 3d printed parts which are achieved by friction between enclosure(3mm thin wall)and the plug with little epoxy glue inside.

Do you plan to charge the packs individually all the time since the packs are different voltages? I'm also doing a split enclosure and was thinking of having the balance leads to balance once in a while but charging unbalanced with a 10/12s charger.

This is actually one pack(10s5p). I used 10guage flat wires to connect the packs together so no need to charge them separately.

same here I am planning balance charging once in a while just for the maintenance purpose, most of the time I am using the laptop style charger.

B6 (6s max) will not charge a 10s battery.  You can find 10s battery chargers online, i think there is a 1010 b or something like that.  Not sure what Mastercho uses but there are a few 10s balance chargers out there.
