Really nice job you did "chewing up the board"
It looks very cool like that!

I always loved the shape of the Wolfshark, amazing deck.

Too bad is no longer available, the 2017 model looks terrible.

Seriously I love the look and feel....there are a couple used ones around I might pick up and just play around with cutting up......love the shape and the curvature of the board just feels like home, while being stiff
