This looks like Borg technology. Resistance is futile. I would call it futility.

The trucks are drop through mounted, giving the deck a super low stance, but it also doesn't leave much room for motor wires underneath the deck. Rather than taking a chance on pinching them between the deck and hanger, I routed them over the top using those tubes. To keep the wires from touching the belts I made belt guards that isolate the tubes from the belts.

I dont think Ive ever planned a build other than my first, and it was crap :).  I mostly buy product when I see something I wanna try or its cheap.  Then when the mood strikes or someone shows up and says "Hey dude, I need a board so help a brother out" I start building.  

I've had builds that were 99% complete that I stripped down because I didn't like something about it.  And this whole Spud 29 kick I'm on is just straight up off the cuff, just decided I needed it.

That being said, I usually document my builds afterwards, so it looks like I actually planned it instead of boy scouting the shit out of it  :slight_smile:/

@psychotiller you named it wrong. I think that board should be named BANE. Just look at those juice pipes
