Hi everyone, I’m here to present my first build, I’m very proud of it and I want to say thanks to the forum for making this possible.
When I started building an electric skateboard I was focused on adding a motor to my Carver with a carbon fiber deck that I made some time ago, but I realized that I really liked to go fast and it wasn’t quite possible with this setup because it was really unstable over 20km/h.
So I decided to go for a long pintail with 180mm trucks and the result is very good for me.
This is the last iteration of a three months build but I have in mind some others improvements that I will explain later.

**List of pieces:**

* 2x5s 4000mAh Turnigy Nanotech LiCo batteries HK 
* Focbox ekating.eu
* Sk3 168kv motor HK
* 75mm X-wheels 
* 116cm Ridge Pintail Amazon
* 180mm Z-flex trucks 
* 12mm pulley HK
* 2.4:1 reduction gear (adapted) HK
* 12 AWG wires HK
* custom motor mount
* battery status indicator eskating.eu

The focbox, I bought form @fottaz (a great guy with a fantastic shop here in Italy), is running field oriented control and is awesome, it runs smooth and didn’t gave me any problem so far. 

I choose this batteries essentially because they have a great charging rate rating so I can push a little bit more when regenerating, they are also quite light and small.

I’ve never tried a full 100% to 0% battery test because I don’t want to stress the batteries too much and I don’t have a datasheet that tells me how much I can go deep with my discharge (if someone has it please let me know) but I reached 8km with 38v still in the batteries so I think I can reach like 12km safely.

The battery case is CFRP, I made the mold with wood and a local shop that works with racing cars laminated and cooked it for me.

**The next step** I have in mind is to change trucks with Paris or Caliber that have a constant section and make a CNC motor mount.
I’m looking also for a BMS to pair with this batteries, but for the moment I balance charge every time my batteries.
