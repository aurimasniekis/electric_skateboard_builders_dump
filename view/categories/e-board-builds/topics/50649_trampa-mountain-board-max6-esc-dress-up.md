I'm also curious about the dampers.

I'd be afraid that by the time the dampening was strong enough for them to be effective at doing anything they'd already be intrusive.

I do not know the specifications of the board. I just received a request to install a dress up.

This damper is possible by dialing the intensity and fine adjustment. It locks at high speed and is said to be released when it is dynamic.
