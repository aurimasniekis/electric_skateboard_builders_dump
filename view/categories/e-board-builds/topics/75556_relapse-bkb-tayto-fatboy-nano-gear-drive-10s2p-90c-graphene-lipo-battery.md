Alright .....so after comming on to this site to build a cheaper boosted mini I got sucked into the black hole that is DIY esk8. I built my first shortdeck esk8 but it was very much a duct tape build and I was not happy after seeing what other people we're building. So I'm finally starting my proper first build. I want to make this thread to keep me motivated to build this one properly. 

So here goes my parts list. Some parts are used, hence the lower price but most are new parts. 
![37%20AM|516x500](upload://tMzXdtJwo6TJukFJxdWQWqKHrx4.png) 

This isn't the end all be all cost, but it is most of it. We'll see how much more expensive this gets. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

I have some of the parts already and the last thing to arrive will the nano gear drive which hopefully will be before the end of the year. I will keep updating this post as I make progress. 

if you guys have any suggestions feel free to let me know. And lastly, I want to thank @mmaner, @Namasaki and for putting up with my noob questions and this build is inspired from what you guys have built in the past. 
also thanks @Skunk for the late night entertainment. lol. :joy:

i'l update below with pics as more parts arrive and this comes together.

**UPDATE:** 

A lot has changed with this build now. Im going with maytech 6365 motors instead of the TB motors. Also thanks @hyperIon1 for changing the bullet connectors for me. I really appreciate it! 
![20181219_145307|690x335](upload://wnNACU43kwFf6YywFz1BERGF3tw.jpeg) 

I also finished up wiring up my pack and then walked ooutside to see that @psychotiller enclosure was delivered. So i checked for space issues and threes just enough space for me to fit everything. 
![20181219_145322|690x335](upload://fCtL71Rcl7YeVXuDU326n8af7kQ.jpeg) 
![20181219_014006|243x500](upload://aLfdUk8P1shEozCczJ0Qht2AoUg.jpeg) 

I got a deal on a unity i could not pass up so im going to be using that instead now. It actully worked out perfect because of the space. 

I need to find shorter 10s balance cable so i can make the wiring more tidy. And everything else needed to complete this build has been shipped. Deck should be here saturday and the Fatboy nano sometime next week. 

Cant f'in wait to build this puppy.

so what I thought would arrive last ended up arriving first (the fatboy nano). Unity delivery got delayed but hopefully, it should be here tomorrow along with the deck. I started to put to together the drive and boy does this drive just screem quality. Thanks @Kug3lis for this amazing drive.

Just a tip with the balance leads. I wouldn’t just plug them in like that. Even with glue they come loose.

I found that you can easily pull the individual balance wires on the battery out of the connectors and then connect them up how you did before and add some solder to them for a permanent solution.

To get the wire out you have to push down on a little tab

You could try to make smaller jump leads in order to connect the batteries in series, whouc would allow for a cleaner installation, but that's just a thought!

i roughly put together the drive with the trucks to figure some stuff out. 
First of i know kugs is gonna be pissed at me for this but i did'nt want to cut the shaft of two brand new motors. So i figured out what length bolts and spacers i need. 
Here it goes if anyone else wants to use spacers. 
I used 22mm m4 bolts and 13mm spacers for my motors. 
![20181223_001630|690x335](upload://ofC7u736dKCIAHshu4EMBcPwiYa.jpeg)

Your build is scarily awesome.

I would suggest cutting the shaft and having it mounted normally. Having the pulley so far out might affect the bearing in the motor.

**UPDATE** 
i cut the shafts on the motor but im running into a bit of a problem. The cover won't close flush with the motor baseplate. I don't know why this is happening because the shaft clears the gear so the gear is stopping it. I can put spacers on those bolts but I don't know if they will clear the wheels. This is happening on both sides. If anyone has any ideas, let me know.

I've tired it with wahsers and it's better but when I tighten the cover down it prevent the gear from turning freely.

A lathe would be the best method, without that just make a jig to hold the pulley flat on a piece of sandpaper. Sand a little, measure, sand a kitt6 more, measure again, keep repeating. Cumbersome but it works.

I would avoid washers between the motor plate and motor if possible. Debris ingress alone will be troublesome not mention you will weaken the contact of the motor to the plate meaning it more likely for a motor screw to vibrate out or brake.

I think your missing you motor plate the lil shield in between the motor and the housing of the gear drive .. mine has one.. and that seem pretty close to the gap that your having issues with.. I think.. with out that there in place I think the motor will be into the housing more so that would make your gear case not close properly.. not sure but that what it looks like to me

I think you need to remove the locking ring on the motor axle and just have 1 ring close to the motor, if you have the lock ring on the motor pulley will hit the enclosure
Edit: i now saw earlier post about you already have the problem, removing the locking ring and all other rings except 1 small is the solution

And the thicker ring under needs to be removed.
The problem you have is because this is to high up because of the ring under so its touching the cover:

Its hard to get it off if you want to keep it (and reuse it) and if you don't get the right tool, but here you could destroy it :smile:

i took the circlip out and removed the bigger spacer that was under it. i had to cut the shaft 2mm more but the cover still hits the gear still doesn't fit. 

correct me if I'm wrong but what excatly does the circlip hold? because i dont think not having the circlip there would make a difference. if i take the circlip out and cut the shaft 2mm more. it should fit. or do you recomend keeping the cir clip?

Not the cleanest build but its 10x better than my first duct tape build. lol 
I only got a chance to take it out for a quick ride before Atlanta wheater ruined my day. its been raining for the past 3 days. 

Overall the ride was meh. mainly due to the acceleration but i imagine that is because im on 10s and 107mm wheels and also 170 kv motors. But this thing powered up every hill in my area no problem. I'm going to have to find steeper hills to test the limits. 

The settings im using right now are as follows.
Battery max. 85A
Motor max (per motor) 40A
Brake 45A

im gonna bump these up when i get the chance to ride next. And i will add videos when i ride next. 

If you guys have any suggestions, let me know.

Yeah, I tried really hard to align the grip tape properly but my adhd ass gave up with that 5 mins in. :joy:

As for the batteries I need to see what the sag is to have an opinion on them. I'm waiting for the metr update to be able to collect data. is there anything, in particular, you want me to test? I think their true discharge is probably in the range of 40-50c. But i have to test it. oh and the weight is probably 20+lbs let me check really quick.

Edit. checked the weight. its 21lbs excatly.

Thanks so much sir. Pretty heavy no? How is to carry around? 
Yeah I’d like to see after how many miles it starts to sag.

although worth mentioning is when i hold the board it doesn't hit the ground so it makes it a little easier to carry.
