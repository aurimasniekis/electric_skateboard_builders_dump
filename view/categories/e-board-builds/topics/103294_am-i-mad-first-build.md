Ok , a little background, I'm a wreck.

Have heart issues since 36 yo.

Looking for mobility options and a skateboard / hoverboard cross would be amazing.

I get very tired doing anything strenuous(walking included) and lack balance  to steer with a skateboard but can stand up without too much issue.

Am building a skateboard but with width of hoverboard. 70cmlong 45 wide in middle.

Twin 6354 sk3's 15 to 72 gearing ratio

10s lipo battery

200mm mtboard wheels

Tilting, independent suspension  at front.

Handlebar steering system.

I'm getting there with build but am I way off? Having self doubt!!!

Isnt this just kind of an electric scooter? Why not just get an electric scooter? :I Except the width, they're much easier to ride...

I did consider a scooter but they just don't provide the stability four wheels can give.

The board is 70cm not inches.![IMG_20191029_084849|690x388](upload://TyNWTMlAoNYwKWcAQUQ3CDMVRF.jpeg) ![IMG_20191029_084838|690x388](upload://nlo8vQNeT5QHwbqBDMlkeo8t4gw.jpeg) ![IMG_20191025_193145|281x500](upload://kiqKL6W6XJntlRzRNVo9bvAdzGu.jpeg)

Still got the steering arms and column/handlebars to do.

Then battery enclosure.

I second that.

BTW you have a really interesting concept going here. Looks like you put a lot of thought & energy into it.
