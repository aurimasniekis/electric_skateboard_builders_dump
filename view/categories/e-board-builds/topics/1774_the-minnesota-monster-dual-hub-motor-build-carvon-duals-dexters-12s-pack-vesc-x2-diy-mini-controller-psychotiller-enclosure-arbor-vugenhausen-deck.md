Okay, so I have been doing my research and lurking the forums for awhile trying to get my bearings before I get on here and ask the same novice questions that I'm sure have been asked over and over again. I will admit that I probably have much more to learn, but I want to jump into this. I am a hands-on learner when it comes to stuff like this and usually just need a little guidance sourcing parts, and then eventually on how to hook up and arrange the electronics.

 What I am looking for is feedback, and constructive criticism on the build I am planning to do. I will post as many parts as I can, and would love others to chime in on what components they feel may be a better bang for the buck, especially if they make my build easier, more reliable, or efficient. I am willing to invest up to $1300-$1400 into the build with ~$600 going into the dual motor, and truck setup from Carvon. I think I should have plenty of cash to spare, no? Here is what I have come up with so far for basic component ideas. I know I will be missing a few parts so any guidance you fine people can offer will be greatly appreciated.

Trucks and Motor: As mentioned above, I plan to use the Dual Hub Motor Setup from Carvon.  ( http://bit.ly/1plkHYC )

Battery(ies): I was thinking of just keeping it simple and going with Jason's SPACE Cell at 10s which should provide enough power I'd think. I reached out to Jerry at Carvon, and they recommend 12s2p of A123 26650 cells. I have little experience working with wiring up batteries in series/parallel, but would be willing to put in the work if I can save a significant amount of money doing so, or if there is any other benefit to this besides the power gain. Thoughts? 
**UPDATE:** Decided on Dexter's 12s3p Battery pack!

VESC: Decided to skip ESC and just pre-ordered 2x VESC from torqueboards site.

Enclosure: I like the looks of Psychotiller's stuff, and RunPlayBack's custom enclosures look ideal for the SPACE cell if I end up going that route.

Deck:  I decided that my current deck flexes wayyy too much and has a bit too much curve :( Shame, as I love the look and ride...oh well. Guess a fresh deck wouldn't hurt this build...

**UPDATE:** Still undecided here, but I want to make a list of boards that I think look good. Maybe it will also help others. My requirements are pretty standard of the general community. Long(er) to fit the 12s3p pack comfortably, flat to fit electronics easily, low flex to prevent any issues, drop through ( because I can with hub motors and I like the look/ride, and made of the highest quality materials. Here's my list so far...

- http://www.hi5ber.com/#!longboards/cm89 - Hi5ber Carbon Decks
- http://bit.ly/1pFNh6W - Method Suirado
- http://bit.ly/1pi66wu - Arbor Vugenhausen
- http://bit.ly/1QRyOyL - Bustin Sportster Pro
Got into looking at custom/crazy looking boards for something different..
- http://bit.ly/1M3DSju Love this design for a hub motor board
- http://bit.ly/1QTfDU1 - Great style custom wood boards.
- http://bit.ly/1UctQPm Billet aluminum boards?! That may be pretty cool if I could figure out mounting. Dunno If the guy even makes them anymore though.

**UPDATE 2:** Finally decided on the Arbor Vugenhausen for my deck after all the looking around. Crossing my fingers, hoping everything will fit!

Controller: It seems most options are pretty good, I wouldn't mind a nun chuck like the Wii, or Carvon remote and the torqueboards one looks cool if it's as small as it looks in the pictures.. What's the best bang for my buck in your guys' opinion? I want it to be small, preferably easy to install or work with given my other electronics, and customizable where it needs to be.
**UPDATE:** Went with Dexter's mini controller.

Misc Parts:
Power Switch?
Dank Bolts
Shock Pads/Risers
Waterproofing Materials
Grommets
Velcro/3M Adhesive Sheets

And again, I should have plenty left over If I am smart about it, what other goodies/refinement can I add to this thing to help take it to the next level? What am I missing, or what new product didn't I see? Give me any and all advice you can muster! Thanks, I really appreciate it!!

Sounds like an awesome build. You did quite a bit of homework too :)

The best deck I've ridden for carving is literally a longer deck with longer trucks.

You can use weatherproofing strips with 3M adhesive works great. McMaster.com has a nice 1" grommet.

Thanks torqueboards! Funny how most people on this forum tend not to pimp their own shit all that much, and are just as happy to recommend another users product(s). Good stuff. You're already on my list of course, so any recommendations on battery, and VESC vs ESC with Hub style motors (not sure if this makes a difference in what I need), especially considering whatever 12s battery setup you would choose? Is the Wiiceiver pretty awesome? It looks pretty nice, and is it still on track for the end of the month? I'd like to get this done in the next couple weeks, but I'm sure sourcing every last part will take a bit more time.

Edit: Same question on the VESC on your site, delivered by the end of the month still?

I had a 12S3P 18650 pack but sold out of the last I had. They are a bit long since they are thin. It costs around $420 shipped. I think the 10S3P is a nice option since it's no so long, so that's what I actually have in production right now.

Haven't tested my hub motor yet so not sure on the best ESC for it. I heard the VESC is nice as well as the TorqueBoards 12S.. VESC is cheaper though.

Wiiceiver is delayed... We are working on an upgraded Wiiceiver which won't drop connection so we'll be testing soon but nothing complete yet. The previous Wiiceiver I won't be making until the new option is available.

Yeah, VESC will be delivered about the end of the month but give or take a few weeks as I want to double triple check everything as well as load the bootloader/firmware. I don't want to rush it to ruin it. If you know what I mean.

I hear you, I expect delays on nearly every part I'm ordering. Hmm, I really need to find a solid 12s battery pack that's as thin as I can get it and reasonably priced or figure out how to put my own together. Any reason to run 18650's over 26650s or vice versa besides thickness? The weather is just getting nice here so I can hold out a little bit and keep researching until the best parts are ready for my build. I don't want to rush and ruin it if you know what I mean :wink:.

18650 have just been tested much more and are purchased in higher quantities than 26650s. Also the height issue too.

Okay cool, so as long as I get either one to 12s2p they will be providing the same power, but 26650's are larger packs to get there? Or am I hearing you wrong?

Edit: Went ahead and pre-ordered a pair of VESC's from you. Just need to settle on a battery setup, and enclsoure to fit it all. Oh, and I subscribed to the website, and it said get ten bucks off, but I didn't get a code or anything?

What do we think about using two of these to attain a 12s pack in a decently size package? I know 50mm isn't ideal, but I want the best range/power delivery combo. Let me know if I am way off base guys.

You want at least 12S3P that way you aren't pulling alot of amps from the cells. 26650's just aren't used as much so chemistry of 18650 just seem better as well as the height issue.

Yeah, two 6S 8ah NanoTech packs would be ridiculous. They'd be a lot more powerful than the 10S3P or 12S3P 18650 packs.

The only downside with the 3S 5ah packs are you would have 4 wires to disconnect at least in my opinion.

You could go with a 12s2p using Sony VTC5s which have 30amp continuous. Also, I disagree with your comments about 26650. They pack sometimes double amp rating of 18650 (Some of them go up to 75amp continuous) Also, they have about the same type of ah ratings and their voltage is the same depending on chemistry.

Thanks for the recommendation! That would be building my own pack, so any preference on how you would do that? And have you had any personal experience with the 26650's that would be a good choice? I'm willing to put in the work to do something crazy/different. Otherwise I just want it to be simple plug and play for the most part. Lipo packs don't seem too hard to work with, and those nano-techs seem to pack a punch, and would seemingly give me good range. Any other thoughts?

Hi! 

I saw that you commented my build so I'll update my status here! I got 3x 4S 6Ah Turnigy nanos for my build. I wanted to make my build with 18650-cells but there were not that many options out there with enough punch for my. So I'll test my setup with these and hope that @torqueboards gets new batch of those all-in-one packs :wink:

Awesome, Thanks for the update! Please let me know how that works for you. I want the most power, from the slimmest setup i can get at 12s3p. I think I woukd go with 4 3s nano tech packs in series if I go the Lipo route, and get RunPlayBacks Dual VESC enclosure. I'd love to see your stats at 12s with that MAH.

Pretty sure I found my the deck I want to go with. Arbor's Vugenhausen looks to be stiff as all hell, flat, lots of space to work with and  beautiful all in one. Built for speed, with the aesthetic to back it up. Anyone wanna talk to into going with Carbon? Does the weight make that much of a difference? I'm 150 soaking wet so...

Here's a carbon fiber deck which I'm working on. However, it's going to be running a 10S3P. I'd have to double check if I can run a 12S3P pack on it. That would be nice.

Similar to the board that you like.

You would spot weld the batteries with pure nickel band and then wire up balance leads to each serial connection and the positive and negative. You don't have to use a BMS, but it adds a few features like one plug charging and can also make the pack a bit safer. I'm looking to build a pack as well soon using A123 lifepo4 cells which have 75amp continuous and 2400mah per cell. These will probably be in a 12s2p configuration. This will get me 184.32wh. And 38.4volts. Lithium ion cells would get me 44.4volts nominal in 12s but lifepo4 have a lower voltage per cell. I could essentially go 14s to get the equivalent of 12s in lithium ion. Tell me if this makes sense and if you have any questions.

That makes sense, I'd love to see how it would fit under the board. I definitely like the long/slim look for battery packs versus the bulky, short enclosures. If you can get it to push more power than a SPACE cell i'd be interested. From what I understand that is just slightly lacking the power I'll need.

Still working on those. He still needs to make sure that he can get a batch in, and I will be a test dummy for it basically from the sounds of it. He only has it on one other test board I think. As long as it pushes more power than the SPACE cell, in a similar size I will be very pleased.

@mrquin - For the 12S3P dimensions are 18.25″ Length, 6″ Width, 1″ Height.

I've tested it with two people so far. Myself and another friend. So far so good. I probably have about 150+ miles on my pack.

@AbrownMN - I've recently sent out 3 packs as well and should get some feedback on them soon. I've been riding them on a dual motor setup climbing up hills here in SF. Haven't been able to trip the fuse yet.

I thought, I'd never say it but they are pretty convenient not having to charge any Lipo packs anymore are pretty nice.

I don't have an enclosure on my board right now. I have some thick velcro that's just bolted to the deck. I'm currently using 2x 12S TorqueBoards ESC.

As for the CF deck it's 21" x 6.5" but the 12S3P is about 18.25". Looking at extending it but haven't checked yet.

Got it. Hopefully Psychotiller can come up with something nice and sleek for me to start with. I will probably have a custom carbon fiber enclosure eventually. My main concern is making sure all the connections are super protected, and the enclosure is as waterproof as possible. I thought about maybe cutting a thin outline into the board and putting sealer strips on both sides, and using a multi latch system, if I can do it without it looking bulky/goofy. Any other ideas that we've seen work well?

Not quite yet, I will definitely keep you posted on what we come up with, and make sure he knows that there is more demand for 12s enclosures. Yeah I would be too scared to run it like that personally, but I'm, sure you got all the parts you need to fix what breaks. I also live in MN, so it's really wet especially this time of year, and I want to be able to ride every day. I will definitely be doing some experimenting with waterproofing, and I will make some videos of my findings. I want overkill in this area as it could save me hundreds of dollars, weeks of waiting, and plenty of heartbreak.

Helps to seal up concaves on certain decks.

I have one of my boards that's my rain board. I dog it out and don't clean it and ride it in the rain. It's relatively enclosed and doesn't get wet much. Motors are fine for the most part. I just don't ride in puddles and only slight rain.

Nice, I will definitely make use of some sort of gasket. I am thinking of getting a sheet of neoprene or some other rubber and mounting that to the board first, cutting it down to sit inside the enclosure perfectly and installing everything onto that. Then cutting a channel around that sheet and adding a gasket/stripping like that. I haven't quite got it hashed out yet, but something to that effect. Have you seen anyone make use of automotive RTV to form a gasket seal? I still need to figure out how I am going to access everything which seems to be a challenge when it comes to keeping it waterproof, but I'll figure something out.

I cannot decide on a deck..I need something with over a 30 inch wheel base from the looks of it so my options are limited. Especially considering it can't flex much. I have the hub motors and slim pack so I can get away with a dropdown/through board and I do like the look of a heavy drop. Has anyone seen anything cool lately that I'm missing? Seems like a lot of the same old on most sites..

Edit: I really like Arbor boards due to the wood grain tops. If I am going to be covering the entire bottom of the board I may as well have a slick looking top..Open to ideas!! I do really like this board and it fits my specs for the most part, but is mild flex going to be too much, and is the concavity going to be an issue?

Been following your thread closely as I'm planning a very similar build (Hoping my 12s from Dexter arrives next week). I'd ask Jerry at Carvon for board shape recommendations...I seem to recall an email or post from from him mentioning some clearance issues around the extended hub motor with certain drop through decks. Also, I'm not sure you'll need a 30" wheelbase. I've measured out the space using Dexter's 12s3p specs and added in the space dedicated to two VESCs, receiver, etc in my Raptor dual...I'm confident 24"x 6 1/2" interior space will do the trick. I guess it depends on enclosure lip, but I'm shooting for a 27" wheelbase. Leaning towards this board at the moment. https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/completes/70846/bombsquad-chubbernaut-longboard-skateboard-custom-complete

Right on, most of the boards that I am looking at are downhill and 8+ ply. Do they normally just say the widest part of the board? Because the one I linked had a slight inward curve in the middle and I want to make sure everything will fit.

Awesome! Thanks for posting. I am sure you're just as excited as I am. And of course it depends on the board, but the wheelbase doesn't necessarily equate to usable board space as far as mounting. From the looks of it you would have to assume that most boards have a couple inches of space lost on each side from the wheelbase measurements. If you look at RunPlayBack's latest build he uses about a 28.5 inch wheelbase board with an enclosure that is a couple inches shorter than mine will be and it just barely fits on there from the looks of it so I just wanted to play it safe. Plus, I like the feel of a longer board if I can get away with it without it flexing too much.

Yeah that board looks nice, he did post the bamboo model as well I believe. I could be mistaken. I was also looking at the older version of the Arbor Axis Koa which is similar in most aspects. My concern is that it is listed as medium flex, rather than mild or stiff which is a bit disconcerting.

Yeah, the downside is the fact that the board is too flexy. So I would pick a similar style deck which maximizes the wheelbase but get something way more rigid. More of a downhill deck. But shoot I got my 12S3P here and I've been bouncing around on it with no issues. Not that I would suggest it. I don't.. but for the world of testing.. gotta make sure it's durable.

Right, I am glad that you did too because that give the rest of us a baseline of what's possible versus what's recommended which is very helpful. I have pretty much decided on a board with a wood grain top because I love the look. Is there any companies besides Arbor where this is a standard style? Just want to look around some more. Otherwise I will probably just go with the Vugenhausen or Genesis and see what happens..

Edit: This thing looks awesome! Probably too flexy though :stuck_out_tongue:

Yeah I guess because it is so damn long, even 8+ ply probably wouldn't do it. The Vugenhausen seems to be the best of all the specs I need. I was just hesitant about it because I found it right away and wanted to do my due diligence. Any reason not to go that route?

Edit: Meh, the top is not the same woodgrain, and they wont even put the clear glass grip on there. I guess I could take it into my shop, stain the top really cool and seal/grip it myself..Is there any good clear tape out there or is the crushed glass method the best way to go?

Oh god, just pulled this off another guys thread...

http://www.threesixdownhill.com/shop/threesix-downhill-deck

I would absolutely love to use a deck like this, but keeping the electronics sealed away seems like it would be a nightmare...

Maybe these are better options for those purposes if I can get him to make it a bit longer...not quite the same aggressive form factor, but cool nonetheless...Maybe i"m just looking to hard into this and trying too hard to do something unique..idk

Yeah, probably not. @psychotiller recommended that I look into Cindrich' Decks, and I really like the honeycomb style. Going to see if he can do something up for me. I will just have to make a nice solid metal top for my enclosure, attach the magnets to the board with an adhesive probably to make sure they stick, and then just click the whole thing on and off as one sealed piece. I don't want it to take too much away from the aesthetic of the deck so I will eventually make an all metal case to match probably. I could even even have my friend laser engrave the same honeycomb/cell pattern onto the case :open_mouth:.

Niiice! Super excited to see the final product and get working on some ideas for mounting them to whatever deck I get...Still want an aluminum one,  but may just get a nice downhill wood deck to start. I really like Cindrich's decks, but I see his all have this hump in the middle on the bottom which concerns me a little bit.. Have you seen any actual builds with his decks? He says they all have that, so I wonder how it will affect my mounting/space for battery. It appears to only protrude about 1/4 to 1/2 inch.

Yeah that's my issue. I am using @torqueboards 12s flat pack. I will post the photo he sent me of it here if I can, but it doesn't seem like I could make it work. I was thinking maybe cutting down the edge of the enclosure, but I think the hump would intrude into the compartment too much since it's a tight fit as is. This isn't the board I would get and the hump on mine would be about an 1/8th to a 1/4 less protruded, but I probably shouldn't risk it...<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c09738a1db9fb445a202330ba79fcc403ffcbba4.jpg" width="375" height="500">

It's best on a semi flat deck. Carving is actually pretty nice on a flat deck with a long truck. I actually enjoy it better than the traditional setup with a kicktail now. lol. Kicktail you can heel pivot but you can get a deeper lean and turn on a semi-flat board with the longer trucks. No need to get all fancy with the kicktail pivot :smile: 

I'd go for these decks..

Thanks for the recommendations. Gives me an idea of what to look for in a board. I am really set on getting some sort of custom wood grain style deck if I go with wood. I really want something unique for this build. I'll show you some of my front runners, and you can check them out. I have been scouring every single board maker, and saving all of the coolest finds then I will just keep narrowing them down. Had to come up with some sort of system or I will never decide. I am usually very decisive, but this one has been really evading me. Who knows, maybe some other young lad will come along and find all these links I am posting and it will help them decide.. :stuck_out_tongue:

I think I will take your advice, and just go middle of the road. I would love to get a $300 Warren deck and ride around on a piece of true art, but I am going over on budget as is probably after all is said and done so It's not the most important thing. And you''re right that there will be another build. I can already tell this thing is going to be too fun. Do you think the drop on a board like this is too much? I will be running smaller rises/shock pads (1/4 to 1/2"?), and big 97mm wheels. I love how big and wide it is, and still a work of art. Not  a  bad price for just the deck either. He also says there is very little flex, just enough. 11 Ply of bamboo I think?

I wonder how easy it is to switch off the motors onto different trucks? I guess I just was assuming they would have to stay on there due to some mounting reason,truck diameter, bolt pattern etc..I guess I never asked.

Edit: Have you every used Seismic Trucks? I was peeping them early in the build, and love the idea of springs over bushings for control, comfort and wear. I don't know which set would be best for my setup, but they sure look nice. Their Aeon's look interesting too, I like the innovation in their setups.

We'll not for Carvon. It's specific to the hub motor.

I meant more for a belt and pulley setup.

No, they are machined to fit :smile:  It's better that way in a sense since you have 6374 motors versus a 6350 motor which would be able to fit on the truck. You'll get more power on the Carvon then most of any other hub motor setups.

I know we're planning out similar builds, thought I post some photos to give you a sense of specs for decks. The first photo is psychotiller's 25" enclosure on a Arbor axis. The enclosure is very well done and I'm glad I chose it, but as you can see it takes up quite a bit of real estate. Second photo is DIY's 12s3p battery inside the enclosure and next to my raptor dual with space cell for perspective. The 12s itself fits nicely, but the massive 80amp fuse will make placing the two VESCs very tricky.

Thanks for posting that info. That helps a ton, and probably saved me a bunch of wasted time. I had finally settled on a board and then realized that nearly none of them would actually work when I started asking for exact measurements of the bottom of the board..The space for the VESC's is concerning..let me know how it ends up working out for you. I'd love to see a step by step of how you do it if it's not too much hassle.

Edit: With about the same wheelbase, but a much more usable board space on the bottom, that actually looks like it was designed to fit this enclosure, I am back to looking at my first choice once again with the Vugenhausen. Seems like that or the Method may be the only ones I can make work.

@AbrownMN - I'm probably just going to end up doing this.. http://www.rubbercal.com/sheet-rubber/recycled-rubber/x-derm-recycled-rubber-60a.html

Recycled Rubber relatively strong. Will bolt it onto the deck with washers (that way rubber or bolt doensn't come out/rip) but it's rugged and strong. Will keep everything from falling down. As for as strong as an ABS enclosure it's not but i'm not running over anything crazy. I'm more worried about things being enclosed for weather protection/dirt/grime and the pack falling out then hitting a brick or something in the middle of the road.

I think you can fit everything on a deck. You can purchase a 40Amp fuse or 60Amp fuse and replace the 80Amp. 80Amp is nice though. I've yet to pop the fuse. I've been throttling it hard and dogging it out too.

Then next... comes...
- Solder all wires to VESCs
- Bootloader/Firmware for VESCs
- Some hardcore testing and trying to break parts.
- Some 12S, higher KV testing.. Which doesn't matter for you :smile:

Perhaps, maybe I'll actually test my Carvon motors too :smiley: Speaking of.. need to order some 195mm Paris Trucks...

Awesome! So just to be clear as I don't see a lot of builds break it down, with your pack, vesc's and the dual Carvon's everything should just be plug and play right? Or will I need to solder or otherwise solidify any connections (receiver?).
 Also, will the VESC's come heat shrinked or should I buy some to do myself? I already bought some corrosionX to treat them as well unless they are already treated with something else? Thanks man! Looking forward to getting everything put together.

Pack is going to be with an XT90 Male Plug.

VESC's are with an XT90 Female Plug.

With two VESCs, you'll need the XT90 parallel Y Connector. 2 Male/1 Female. product/dual-vesc-xt90-parallel-connector/

Oh.. you'll need to switch out the VESC motor wires from the 5.5mm standard to 4mm to fit for the Carvon's.

VESC's will come heatshrinked.

Thanks for the info! So I will need to remove the wires/connectors and solder on new ones? Anyway I can have this done on my VESC's on your end? Or I suppose I could see if Jerry could switch the motor connections to 5.5 if he's still putting them together..

Edit: and I already bough the xt60 y connector doh! Got ahead of myself there I guess.

Got my Carvon's and my Vugenhausen today! Getting even more excited! Just need a few more things from @torqueboards and my enclosure from @psychotiller and I'll be on this beast every day carving! Or I'll be stuck in my shop working on making more for friends haha.. Pleasantly surprised with the Carvon build quality and they really do roll nicely even just pushing! That was a huge selling point for me so I am glad it functions as promised. The board is excellent, a bit more curve than I thought it would have, but it should work and it is stable as hell, but still comfortable. Too bad I will have to cover up the beautiful wood grain with a big black box..cannot wait to tear off the grip and throw on some custom design. 

I also got some wires, bushings 3M dual lock, risers and some other miscellaneous shtuff if you guys want pictures of that too .. :stuck_out_tongue:

Board looks good with the black trucks and green wheels. What's the distance between the wheelwells? If it's more than 26" you're good to go, less than 26" and you'll have to adapt the enclosure some.

I'm in wait and see mode frankly. Have some concerns about compatibility between VESCs and Carvons and also I've yet to find a board that I really love (want a kick tail and less than 38"). Have you already ordered the enclosure? if not I'd recommend ordering it 1/2" deeper. DIY 12s isn't uniform in height and the extra 1/2" would give you some wiggle room. If you've already ordered it, I think it still works, but you'll likely need to add some weather stripping to gain some clearance.

Thanks for the tips. Sorry to hear you're having delays. What are your concerns with compatibility with the VESC? It seems like you might be hard pressed to find any deck that size with the usable board space you'd need. You could look into have a custom deck made. I found a company that uses hardwood and will make you a really beautiful custom deck for a decent price. I believe it was East Coast Customs. Check them out.

Thanks. Thinking about the custom decks...really like what @longhairedboy does with the wiring channels. Regarding the Carvon/VESC combo, seems like there's a pretty small margin of error, especially under heavy loads. I've no doubt they'll be great long term (might be great already), but for now I'll wait and see how this combo develops.

Depends on bushings and how tight I tighten the main nut. With super loose trucks there would be issues, but since I like a stiffer bushing on this build based on how fast I plan on going most of the time it shouldn't be an issue at all. I could even get away with a pretty carvy setup without too much bite except in majorly sharp curves. There's plenty of room for adjustment, but I would say definitely order some more supportive bushings to avoid any issues.

Sure. I got a big set of grommets, a set of different sized wire heat shrink wrap, Lots of waterproof foam edging and 3M dual lock, a few sets of risers/wedges, different bushing combinations and a bunch of weather proofing stuff, RTV, CorrosionX, gasket compound etc..

Originally, I was going to use magnets to secure the enclosure, and I still may do this but I am going back and forth on how I would have to go about it, and if it's worth it given that I will eventually probably have a full wood enclosure that is water tight. The ABS enclosure is less pliable than I originally thought, and I got pretty strong magnets but I would probably need them to be even stronger still and they get pretty expensive and bulky at that point. That said, I also really don't want to drill a bunch of holes in the board more than once either. I'll come up with something..still trying to work out problems with getting the rest of my stuff ;/

Maybe some stiff metal brackets the contur of your board that is on the edge of the enclosure and magnets in the board? Strong magnets ! And maybe heat up the edge of the enclosure with a heat gun to see if you can work the abs into shape that sits flush with the board?

Just thinking out loud

Well, I got the battery but I am having some strange issues with it so I may need to return it. Not sure at this point. Dexter @torqueboards will make it right so I have no worries there, just more waiting unfortunately. Also need my VESC's from him still. I know he has been working on them awhile. Not sure when they're actually going to be done though. Other than that and the remote/receiver from him  I am pretty much set on parts. When you're this close and start hitting roadblocks and issues it's like torture though. Trying to find other stuff to work on with it. I am going to rip the standard grip off, have a buddy laser engrave the entire top with sacred geometry and probably clear grip it. It's gonna look incredible and should keep my excitement about the project up!

Thanks for the tips man! I will definitely invest in the heat gun to mold it a bit better, and you actually gave me a great idea with the metal frame idea. My biggest concern was throwing the magnets into the board ( which would be awesome to hold it down flush) and then having them be underpowered due to their thickness. What I could do though is make that metal frame, adhere the magnets to the bottom strip of it, cover it up with weather stripping and then just set the enclosure onto that and drop the really strong magnets right onto the top of the lip of the enclosure to hold the seals together. It would make it sit out a bit, but with sufficient stripping and sealant I could probably make it pretty waterproof with a little work.

So, I finally got everything running after a few small issues...the board was an absolute blast for a few minutes until a solder broke and sent my ass walking back home in ridiculous humidity with the board as extra weight just for extra fun. I have little to no experience soldering electronics, no soldering gun and don't really want to mess this one up. Time to learn or should I just have someone else do it? If I had the energy I'd post pictures of the finished build, but after months of anticipation this day has been total anti-climatic shit.

Thanks for the encouragement! Any tips on stuff to watch out for? Should I add hot glue or something to those connections on the VESC as well? I think I left too much room where the wires run through the enclosure so that any force on the exterior wiring would affect the interior wiring. I pulled some slack into the case and hot glued the connections and now it seems more solid from being affected. My real issue is that instead of swapped connections I got extension/conversion cords and now wire management is difficult with two stiff points where the connections are made :confused: I'll have to figure something out there.

@AbrownMN

Welcome back brother!  Glad to see you finally got all your parts in.

Can you post more details about which solder joint broke?  My guess is you're better off picking up a soldering iron and learning how to solder.  There are a ton helpful posts out there about soldering.  

I'm in the same boat as you.  I have basically the same build and I've never soldered shit before.

I picked up a fairly decent soldering iron so I could clean up the wiring on my build:
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ANZRT4M/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

So far I've only soldered a couple of spliced wires and I made a dual output xt90 connector for DIY's 12s pack based on this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCtiN1KR9iE

This thing was so easy my dog could've done it.

Did you get your enclosure working for your board?  Post some pics!  I'd love to see what you've done with the enclosure.  My board is held together with a ton of velcro at the moment.

Hey man! Thanks for the welcome back! Been leaving the thread dead until I got all the parts, but still been posting here and there. I will definitely get you some photos up tonight or tomorrow showing the enclosure/setup. I have a lot of 3M dual lock holding everything inside down, and eventually gave in to screwing the enclosure to the board. Since I will eventually (4-5 weeks) be getting a custom wood enclosure I didn't really want to do this, but I also didn't want it falling off on the maiden voyage. Interested to see what you have come up with as well. I'll go peep your build again if you have it all up there. 

You're probably right since this will happen more than once I'm sure. I will be buying a soldering gun and messing around with it. Just don't really want to test on my VESC, which is expensive, but more importantly takes forever to get lol..should have ordered 4 right out of the gate. I wonder if there is a similar board/connection i could find laying around to test my skills on. 

If anyone knows of a good video showing how to solder to the VESC itself that would be awesome. Almost all videos show soldering wire to wire or ESC wire to motor. It's probably a similar process, but I am sure there is some difference when working on the board as far as temperatures etc..

Umm, yeah I think...those look a bit different than mine. To be more clear, the solder on the VESC itself broke off on one of the outgoing motor connectors. The big fat solders on the end of the board. Dunno exactly how it happened, but like I mentioned above I think I just left too much room for the cords to wiggle. Added hot glue to the other side and they have held up on about 30-40 minutes of riding so far so I think I got it sorted. Hoepfully... Now I just need to redo that solder and get another 4 to 5.5mm connector/extender. I was running it on a single motor and like a fool left the other wires tucked under the board and lost one of them :stuck_out_tongue:

Edit: Went and checked on your build again. Yeah those are the wires that broke. You have a Chaka VESC right? You're build says you ordered from Dexter but you have different outgoing cables and that black piece holding them in place which seems far superior to the setup I have.

I have to do something similar with DIY's VESCs. They come with 10awg wires and 5mm connectors.

If I can find wide opening 4mm connectors in stock, I'll just add those directly to the 10awg wires.

I might just remove these 10awg wires from the VESC and replace them with 12awg and 4mm connectors.

@LukeM I ended up just getting an entirely new pack rather than switching over parts. It nearly doubled my wait, but it worked out great. I prefer the switch and fuse I have now. 

@TheWrongHombre So you already popped those connectors off? I just made a post about finding connectors rather than cutting the wires up. I currently have like 4 inch long conversion wires from Dexter, but they are way too long for cable management and I imagine they add resistance. I found these on Ebay and these seem to be the ticket for the easiest, most simple conversion from the 4mm male on the Carvon to the 5.5mm female on the DIY VESC.

Basically, I love it! I intend to leave a review on the individual components once I spend a little more time with them. I have learned a ton, and am open to help anyone else with questions as best I can.

There's a few things I want to refine, I like the enclosure I made, but will also be excited to see what @cmatson comes up with for me. Psychotiller made a fine enclosure, I wish it was one solid piece and everything fit a bit better, but overall it did the job. I run a small wood shop so I figured what the hell and have been working on my own wood enclosure as shown above over the past few days. I am pretty pleased with the end result, except I did a pretty shit job of sealing it due to the fact that the stuff I used had the top left off. Also, I think I would've preferred higher gloss to match the board. Either way, everything fits a bit nicer and it goes well with the board.

I am sort of glad that I was stuck with one motor for the first few days. It really solidified my decision to go with two motors and gave me a chance to get used to how the system rides. It is insanely fast with dual motors and has more than enough power for anyone that I have had jump on it. Everyone gets off a bit shaky with adrenaline. Oh and a  helmet is absolutely required. Already had a few close calls. 

I'll probably just edit this post with updates onspecific components, unless it gets buried before I get the chance. Let me know what you all think!

@AbrownMN How do you like the Vugenhausen? That's the board I bought for my project and I'm hoping it works well as an eboard

Works great Blake, Super rigid, awesome foot feel, tons of space for carving, and minimal wheelbite with a stiff bushing setup. I am running a double step and barrel bushing setup with a pretty tight fit and it's perfect!

Damn man. That thing looks fucking awesome!

Love the enclosure. Looks like it's buttoned up nice and tight.

Is that pine? How much weight does it add to the board?  Did you use threaded inserts or just screw it directly to the board?  What's the wheel base or the length of the enclosure?  Did you already add poly?

Oh yeah, more questions...

Which helmet is that?

Is that newer switch a push button or toggle on the battery pack?

What's the story with the other enclosure you mentioned?

Thanks brotha! Yeah, I basically just hand routered, chiseled and sanded it down from a block of pine. It's very light, but stronger than you'd think since it's all a solid piece. I just drilled into the board through the enclosure with a collared bit made for the screws I intended to use. Not sure if the inserts are necessary, I have checked my board after all my sessions and nothing has been loose yet. Anyways, the screws ended up being a bit too long and they didn't have stock of the shorter ones so for now there are just some heavy threaded stainless screws holding it in. 

It's about 28 inches long or so which fills basically the whole wheelbase. I might shave one end down a bit, but I like how it fits to the board. The "poly" I tried to use was a matte lacquer. I should've just went with a higher gloss poly, but I was getting bored so I wanted to experiment. It was goopy and applied blotchy with a brush and seemed to dry very fast. Even tried to lightly torch it to get out bubbles and smooth it out to no avail. Probably gonna sand it down and re seal next week for a higher gloss finish. The stain mix I had was pretty dead on with the board. 

The helmet is the Vector M6 from ZGskate. It's light, doesn't make you feel like a bobblehead, and draws attention but is actually pretty low key for the most part..I got a bit hot in it today and found myself taking it off a lot when we slowed down. I think it looks way less absurd than the bigger helmets, it's really nice.

The push button is just a grommet that I used to seal the hole drilled for the power button. Have yet to carve out the LCD screen. Not sure if I really want to cut into that central piece for rigidity purposes. 

The story on the other enclosure from Psychotiller is that it worked great, just didn't fit my aesthetic even though it was pretty sharp.  Mainly though it was a bit tight on room for everything. Really not much tighter than what I have now but the tiny bit of extra room helped with layout. Also, it was in two pieces so since my board has a pretty nice curve to it the enclosure kept break apart in the middle. The pine is soft enough to have a bit of flex without snapping and it holds everything really snug.

Only other issues I have experienced with it is wire management near the motors, had one spark off a connection which scared the hell out of me, but luckily I caught it quick and nothing went wrong from it. Added some extra tape and rode it for 2 hours straight and it rode like a dream. Pulling my friends back up the hill at 25 miles an hour was a trip....

Ahhh.  That explains it.  The color looked like a good match.  The sanding/poly sounds like a good project while you wait for the battery pack to charge. :wink:

Have you thought about trying a maple veneer to match the board?  The board is maple right?

I have the same issue with wire management on the motor wires.  I've seen people using wire clamps to tighten it up a bit.

The board layers are maple, but they also put a veneer on the outside to jazz it up I think, not sure what that is made of, but maple isn't red. I have a clamp to keep the two cords together. I think I was just thinking wrong when I had the enclosure off and upside down. I didn't want to stress the VESC's at all this time around so I made the wire come out of th enclosure really level with them at what I was assuming to be the bottom of the enclosure..flip it over and they are now really close to the motor and I set them up to barely poke out so they are really stiff as well and not a lot of room to move around. In a deep carve I rub a tiny bit on them. So far, some friction tape has  done the trick. Oh, and tightening up the rear truck ;)

Hahaha, I was pretty surprised how well it worked myself...not sure of the exact grade but this is a realllly long down slanting stretch of trail. It's not super steep but I was towing them for a mile at times all up hill with no issues flying by serious bikers who were clocking at 22 mph or so when we flew by. This thing is an absolute beast top end. I usually have them push as fast as they can and then link up hands as I fly by them so it doesn't strain the motor at the low end any more than it already does. Super fun to get your buddies to roll with you so they don't die trying to keep pace and you don't have to kill your motors with the low end. 

I'll try to get some videos next time. Hard when we are both flying...need a drone now.

edit: after looking at some grades I'd say it's varying between a 10-15% grade all the way up. Again, towing them for up to and probably even slightly over a mile at a time.

No, I never did. Not sure if he's still on vacation or just busy or what..We will see! I have been having an absolute blast on mine this week especially. I have run into an issue where my signal is getting randomly sent to my board and the motors twitch. And if I turn my remote off it just powers my motors to full throttle..sketchy.

Not to hijack the thread, but ya, the 5 weeks flew by for me, and I was still on the forum some so I wasn't by any means off the grid or away from eboards that long..

After all, idk who could survive that without at least have a single hub motor board with them :wink:

This is the best pic I have of my Velcro setup. 

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/jobby-lane-clutch-underdog-carvon-v2-dual-hubs-abec-11s-18650-battery-pack-undecided-dual-vesc/2292/43?u=thewronghombre

I took a couple strips of 2" Velcro and put it along the entire  bottom of the board.  A couple strips on the back of the battery too and just pressed it to the board. 

https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00006IC2T/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1475353884&sr=8-2&pi=SY200_QL40&keywords=velcro+strips&dpPl=1&dpID=31aNRUcnFzL&ref=plSrch

Components are held on by just cutting up some smaller strips of Velcro. 

https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004AF9II6/ref=mp_s_a_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1475354284&sr=8-10&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&keywords=velcro+strips

The other strap you see across the battery might not be necessary but it certainly ensures that battery won't drop.

this worked well for me. If I were to do another temporary solution, I might also consider building a temporary enclosure out of Legos. That seems to have worked well for a few people.

Hey man just wanted to chime in in case you needed some tips on waterproofing still, a thin, relatively untextured yoga mat works awesome. I can fill the enclosure with water and seal it, and nothing comes out. I.E. nothing gets in.

Nice! I ended up using the waterproof gaskets made for sealing interior doors and stuff like that but they aren't great for taking the enclosure on and off a lot. Especially after they've been cranked down and left on for awhile. Considering I haven't taken the case off all winter I imagine I'll have to come up with something else when I do. Thanks for the tip!

Word. I work in Andover. Two of my favorite paths are closer to my house in Stillwater. One is 18 miles of paved with lots of nature and even a food truck on the weekends.. the other is like 6 miles but it's this perfect downhill slant and brings you right into downtown for a drink after a nice ride. Sometimes a food truck at the end of that one too!
