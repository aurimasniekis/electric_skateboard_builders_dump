Hi, 

Today, I shortened my Caliber truck (26 mm) to install my new unikboards dual mount system on my tesseract.

I perforated Kegel wheels with 6mm wick to install bearing driver.

mount is too close to the board, youll need risers or maybe you used 44s instead of 50s caliber? thats the big downside of these kind of mounts and its why i dont like them. no flexibility at all and no real advantage to counter that downside. less parts? doesnt work for me :confused:

Agree, that's why I designed my own mount, although the CNC machining cost was not cheap

Not even kidding:
http://unikboards.com/shop-product-list/support-dual-moteur-mount-caliber/

Seriously wondering who buys stuff like that. I mean it looks amazing - but lack of flexibility and price is just a no.

I own a unikboard motor mount too. Main advantage: just put the screw, et voilà !
No need epoxy glue, tricks to let the mount in place ... It's light, quality made , and design by a guy who knows esk8 (OKP :slight_smile:) 
For this mount it is mandatory to use a minimum 5 mm riser.
True the price is too hight ... hope in the future they could produce more, so they can drop the price

hello ! 

I have not had too much time to pursue my building (too much side work), but I got an old jetspud and i think that i change the tesseract for this. The unikboards mount is perfect maybe expensive but very good quality and the flexibility is not a problem, it's perfect ! I think to finish the build next week !
