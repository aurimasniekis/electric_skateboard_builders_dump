This deck is only 25 inches long,  has an awesome shape to it!  I wanna put a mono drive on it with a 20 cell battery pack.  Probably just enough room.  Need some advice on where I can get motor mounts and a really powerful brushless motor? Any advice would be awesome,  wanna keep the cost way down,  but quality as high as I can.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/4299ded32a5851b6f7bd47590722aba0a87a88a5.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/25f50b263bcbf9037647702109721f7b8fa7ab88.jpg" width="281" height="500">

Hub motors would make this much easier to build. Are you going with lipo or li-ion?

Hub motors,  great idea.   I will most likely do that!  18650 cells!
