While most here are looking to get bigger wheels I'm the odd man out looking to build a board with smaller wheels, preferably 70mm. The problem is obviously that 40 tooth pulleys are pretty much this size (maybe bigger?) And that motor brackets would be scraping the ground. Even when I had a board with 83mm I was scraping the motor bracket constantly and snapping them as well as truck hangers from the impact on crappy NYC streets. 

Does anyone have any ideas on how I could make this work or am I looking to do something that simply isn't possible? Just want to build a small, light, low profile, single motor board for running errands.

Use a 32T pully?

I have 59mm wheels and have been using a 32T well :)

What sort of speed do you get? I'm not sure how small I can go on the motor pulley to get sufficient reduction. 

Probably all stupid questions.....

You can work it out via:

I've done it. I had to make my own hub though. IT had a 16mm od and a 8mm id. A smaller bearing went in there to replace the original 8x22.  The insert had to be epoxied to the wheelhub, but worked well. It had a flange on it to screw pulleys to.

Others just drilled holes through their wheels.

I have had a build with 70mm wheels and used a 30T pulley from ebay, worked fine!

Good to know it's been done. What sort of mount are you using for the motor that it's not scraping on the ground? I assume you probably just filed down a regular mount to solve this issue? Most seem to be made to a height to protect a 40t wheel pulley

How did you mount the pulley to the wheel without a core?

I did some small changes to the wheel with a lathe.
Made an aluminium piece and drilled through the wheel.

I also did it in my next build, the pulleys are from ebay:

In my other builds I just bought abec style wheels and a pulley kit which is made for them, so much easier.

It's not a direct drive, it clearly has gears.  You can see them in the photo.

you can also look at Akasha's wheel. They are dope and made by riders. I sourced them years ago and had them on my bustin cruiser.

Yes with the kegel core like, they're the smallest and sweetest ! (there is also the Flywheels in 76mm)

I have build a very cheapo build for my first eskate and I ended up using 70mm wheels with this wheelpulley:

It is for 3m belts so a bit more slip but I find it okay (I live in a very flat area)

They also [sell the pulley](https://www.arcboardsev.com/product-page/arc-board-drive-pulley) and [belts](https://www.arcboardsev.com/product-page/arc-board-drive-pulley) separately so you can use your own favourite 70mm wheels.
