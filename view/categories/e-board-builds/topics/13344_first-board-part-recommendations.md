I've looked around for a while but I haven't found much along the lines of what I'm looking for so I figured I'd write up a post.

My questions -

1. How much should I expect to spend to make a decent long board for pretty cheap? I would like to have a good battery life.
2. If I build my own deck, is there anything I should take into consideration when it comes to shape and size?
3. Is there a build I could follow? Maybe someone could refer me to one? I have no experience with moters, battery's, electronics, etc and I would like to be confident that what I buy will all work together.

Thanks for the awesome sight and great insight.

You obviously haven't looked around very much... this forum has every type of build (with part lists) known to esk8. Just look through the build section
