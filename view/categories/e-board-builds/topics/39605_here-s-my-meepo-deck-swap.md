I ordered a Meepo just to get me to my jiujitsu classes in the morning. Afterwards I ended up going down the esk8 YouTube rabbit hole and now I think I’ve found a new hobbie.

It’s an Arbor Highground, think it may be an older model. If you are gonna use this deck you’ll need 1.5 inch hardware as it’s really thick.

Not sure about long rides. I only use it for quick city commutes. I like the concave, I find it very confidence inspiring. I’ve been skating way faster since swapping the deck out.
