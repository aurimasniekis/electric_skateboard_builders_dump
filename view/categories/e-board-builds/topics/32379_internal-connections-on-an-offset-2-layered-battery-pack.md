Hi All, 

I'm building a 10s6p battery in 2 layers of 30. (Similar to Damon's 12S6P monster in the photo). Deciding whether to build a more 'compact' pack by sitting the second layer in the 'grooves' of the first layer. Not sure how to configure the nickel strip for the internal series connections?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/8/d8b452e7b163543e9e29bdb8353faeed975043bd.PNG" width="281" height="500">

Whitepony on endless sphere had his nickel strips configured so he could 'fold' the battery flat. Sketch below is what it'd look like prior to folding. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/4/04a12af64b94ef76bf61f52eb928df4deb374193.JPG" width="375" height="500">
