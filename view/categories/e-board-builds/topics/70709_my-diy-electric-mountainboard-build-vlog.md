[PART ONE OF MY MOUNTAIN BOARD BUILD! ](https://youtu.be/B8KMw9AMx08)

Hey everyone.   I just posted a video showing my progress in building an electic version of an old old mountainboard I used to own back in 1999.  I decided I needed to take this little piece of my childhood and bring it into the 21st century!    

I did a lot of 3D animation to show the assembly and build materials, please let me know what you think. 

If you happen to be supercool like me and like electric skateboards AND Star Wars.  Check out the rest of my robotics builds, it may be right up your alley!
