Edit:
My shot at a board that is budget friendly while still being able to handle small gradients, daily cruising around town, and having some of the "extra" features for ease of use. A value build. 

Realized I'm gonna be using this board on some small hills and that expanding my original budget of about $350 to about $450 makes my build more reliable and adds a bunch of awesome extra features such as smooth starts from standstill (sensored motor), ability to monitor vesc using an app, ~3 more miles of range (10s), ~5 more mph top speed (due to more battery cells), not having to worry about small gradients or hot weather (more efficient and higher torque motor), not having to solder on plugs for the battery and motor connections to the vesc.

UPDATED PARTS LIST POSTED IN THREAD BELOW

Original:
Hey guys! I'm looking to build a board to cruise around suburbia this summer. I have a complete (I think) parts list ready to go, just wanted to run it by you guys as I'm new to this. Any suggestions? Am I missing anything? I'll probably add a BMS later on. I have specific questions at the bottom of the post too.

Buy this esc instead of the FVT 120A:
FLIPSKY FSESC 50A
https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/cPUU2qPm

For the batteries, buy 3 to make a 9S battery or it should be better to buy 2 x 5S battery to make a 10S battery.

Motor mount is good enough.

I should go for another remote because I think that's the one which is very unreliable. Buy this:
https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com.au%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F183186012920

Also buy another motor if you go for 10S, you need a lower kv-motor like 120-190kv depending on the speed you want.

SK3 or SK8 series are good, but the SK8 versions are maybe a bit better for esk8.

You can calculate the speed with this calculator and search a good kv-motor value:

That ESC can only handle 50A is that enough?

I'm trying to make the initial build as cheap as possible, so I think I'll stick to 6S and just add another 3S in the future. I'll stick to one motor as well. 

I see that the sk8 motors are sensored. Will this draw more power, especially if I stick to 6S?

If I'm doing one motor, 213KV seemed to be a good balance of torque and speed with a 16:36 pulley ratio.

Thanks for taking the time to help man!

It's your choice but that 120A crappy esc will be destroyed in a couple of runs and they will pull so much amps out of your Lipo that they will get puffed/unbalanced.

Those car esc's are just not used anymore in builds at this moment, because vescs are getting so cheap and they are also cheap hobbywing esc's which work so much better and are designed for esk8.

50A on 10S is like 1500W so that's not bad at all.

Using a 10S battery (so 2 x 5S batteries in series) will be much more efficient because you need to pull less amps for the same power and this will be so much better for your lipo's.

I not made my previous post for fun, I should really take a look at the products I mentioned to make a much better controlled build, and I'm sure the final price of your build will be around the same.

Ok I bought the Flipsky Vesc along with the remote you recommended!

I'm leaning towards doing 9S because I like that the 3S packs are slimmer. When I charge them, do I need to do each one individually, so in this case I would need to charge 3 separate times?

Could either of these motors work?

This one seems like it could be a good sk8 alternative?

Also, I want a board that goes about 21mph max. So I'm looking for whatever is the minimum/cheapest to buy to achieve this.

Also I'm looking to get about 5mi of range. Does the 50A Flipsky Vesc, 6S battery, and 200kv motor do that with a top speed of 21mph? Would there be enough torque?

9S will be better, you can charge them seperate or buy a parallel charging dock to charge them at the same time.

If you want a cheap and good motor which fits on the motormount from hobbyking buy this one (because I don't know if the motors from banggood will fit, they have other mounting holes) :
https://hobbyking.com/nl_nl/kd-53-30-high-voltage-brushless-outrunner-190kv.html

With the 9S battery and 190kV motor you will be able to go around 23mph and I guess around 7miles.

The motor you sent is out of stock. I decided I want to use a sensored motor for smooth startup. 

[https://buildkitboards.com/collections/motors/products/6354-208kv-motor](https://buildkitboards.com/collections/motors/products/6354-208kv-motor)
How does this one look? Any other 190kv sensored motor recommendations for cheap? I haven't heard great things about sk8 motors. 

Also thinking 3 of these for 9S

Ok I'm just about set. Last two things to figure out...

Because I'm doing 9S, a 2 series harness off of hobbyking won't work. How could I put 3 batteries in series?

Also not sure what the best battery indicator/ voltmeter would be to get. Ideally something I can mount on the board to tell how much battery I have left.

Good luck with the build :) 

I'm curious about this. Also looking to do a budget build myself. Last time I tinkered with RC was nitro cars and brushed 480s ECT and then ditched RC to ride downhill.

What sort of hill gradient would this setup be able to tackle with a 85kg rider?

I should get 7-8Nm of torque but I'm not sure how that translates to hill gradients

Not sure either :) I'm here to learn. Will be following this with great interest. 

From my downhill days, a cheap set of zealous or similar bearings are worth their weight. Either order the wheels you have in mind without them or keep them for spares. 

The inbuilt spacers and longevity of them are fantastic! (Not sure if any guys have thoughts otherwise)
