This build is a rebuild/reimagining of my Glory build after I had some issues with my battery pack, I had BMS issues and have since rebuilt the pack for use in another board.

I kept the motors, motor mounts, wheels, pulleys and belts...everything else is new.  The concept for this build is a top tier daily driver.  I didn't want incredible speed or massive range, decent range and comfort is what I'm looking for. It's like the Cadillac AWD level of comfort and sleek performance of a Charger R/T in an esk8.

I'm running 6374 190kv motor at 10s because it's the least troublesome and most reliable setup with a VESC platform, has tons if torque and at 4p lots of range. I'm running FOC Hybrid mode for startup boost and quiet at low speeds, I find that road noise cancels out the noise of BLDC at higher speeds for the most part.

I had the board running thursday of last week, but have made a couple of programming changes and swapped out the truck hardware for 10-24 bolts and added the X-Braces.  

I can't say enough of the (@treenutter) Bludgeon, this is a beautiful deck with the standard Red Ember level quality...lush is all I can say.  As always, the (@psychotiller) 6 shooters are unbeatable.  The size and profile make them the perfect pneumatic for the esk8 platform.  I'm crazy addicted to Surf Rodz TKP's, they are solid and carvey beasts.  The (@JLabs) 10s4p 30Q pack is my favorite, it makes the VESC/FOCBox setup pretty much dummy proof and you can ride as hard or lazy as you want without worry.  The (@torqueboards) TB 6374 motors are brick houses, never have any trouble and always just go go go. 

On to the build porn...

You are building as crazy! Although I think that dual 6374 it's a bit more than a Cadillac :grin: Good that you went for a 10s then otherwise it would be a rocket:sunglasses:
Anyhow very nice one, as usual.

Comfort is what I had in mind too.

Wow now I need some sixshooters. They work fine with the TB trucks that I have now so they'd run pretty with that. Not as carvey but still darn solid.

I LOVE THIS BUILD @mmaner , the execution of this is so well done. @treenutter the things I've seen people do to your decks...you must be proud.

Edit: +1 for @JLabs battery, it is really dummy proof. and excellent quality

Great to hear! by charger you mean BMS or the luna charger cut off at the correct voltage? This is super close to how I will wire my board only I will be using Lipo packs.

This counts as talking about your builds electrical system so that's how I'm justifying doing some of my research here lol Thanks!

Looks awesome! 

Only thing is that you need to flip your wheels. The tire tread is going the wrong direction. The V is supposed to be pointing forward, the point being that any water or debris is being pushed outward not in. 

Are you running two middle pieces with two outers for the wheel pulleys? Any issues?

[/quote]

Both, the BMS will cutoff at 42v and start balancing. The Luna Charger will drop from.4a once it sees 42v at the pack. It's meant to be a dummy proof system, although it's still safest to not charge unattended.

That's is correct, the VEX pulleys are highly.modular, very nice. I've done this on other boards as well.

Had an issue with my old ass VESC-X, the USB port broke off and was shorting something inside the case causing cutouts.  Replaced with FocBox's and sending the VESC-X to @JohnnyMeduse.  Also upgraded to @Ackmaniac firmware 3.1 to try out current & reverse, not sure I like it but we will see.

Looks like it wasn't the VESC's. It cutout in me this evening in a rise downtown. I've checked all the wireing, it might be the remote but I think it's the battery pack. 

I'll test another remote to tile that iut but I guess I need to find a charge only 10s BMS...

Also, @sender is doing some mondo cool stuff to a caldera for me...shhhh, it a a secret 😀

Ya seems like one needs at least two builds at all times to be able to safely have a deck when the others being worked on.

Hi Mike,
I’m interested to see your @psychotiller mounts. Do you technically have them mounted upside down? I’m setting up my surfrodz and tiller mounts now but thought the thicker part went underneath as motor protection?
```

I've done it both ways, depends in the deck. Sometimes if I have shirt clearance, from the motor to the deck I'll out the thick part up so the motor doesn't hit the deck. If I have plenty of room I'll mount the thick part down so the motor can't hit the ground. Is that what you mean?
```

I think so, most of the decisions in how to build are made based in the environment and materials. That's what's so great about @psychotiller mounts, they are very fluid in how they can be installed.

I honestly couldn't say, they are absolutely my favorite trucks. Almost as stable as RKPs at high speed (30 mph +) and the carviest trucks I've ever ridden. The bushing seat is perfect for geometry changes by using tall or street bushings, okus make them as wide or short as you want by changing axles.

If you need more width you can make the 'clamp', for lack of a better word, ride the axle with a 10mm slot as if they were spacers then the hex that slides into the hanger. Could even make it press fit as the spacers and then the wheel will tighten everything down and won't allow it to back out when the axle is tightened.

I think the way I've done it already is good but always room for improvement. I'll show how it clamps etc. Later but the motor isn't mounted inline with the end of the hanger. But 5mm further out

So there's a lot of space for motors

I just received my Surf Rodz tkp and psychotiller’s tkp mounts last week. Just eyeballing the hangers and mounts, it looks like the clamps will need to be spread apart or possibly hammered down, they definitely don’t slide on without force. Was that your experience?

You want them pretty tight, keeps everything straight.  I used a big socket and a rubber mallet, just lightly tamp the clamps down onto the hanger until they are in the correct position.  The correct position is defined by lining up the grub screw in the clamp with the grub screw on the hanger.  You can then use loctite on the clamp grub screw to split the threads between the hanger and clamp.  It will absolutely never move.
