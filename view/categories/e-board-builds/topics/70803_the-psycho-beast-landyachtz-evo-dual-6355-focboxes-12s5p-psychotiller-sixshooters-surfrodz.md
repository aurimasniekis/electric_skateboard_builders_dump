This board started its life as an eskating Dual Beast.
Generally I was happy with it apart from a few issues however a few weeks ago I tried an Evolve board with pneumatics and upgraded battery. The performance was unimpressive but the ride on the pneumatics, on the crappy roads we usually ride on, was an eye opener.
I was pushed towards SurfRodz, @psychotiller mounts and SixShooters by some guys in the forum 
you know who you are @Skunk  @Wraith
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/help-me-upgrade-my-boards-drivetrain/67992

So I present you the board in its current form.
The Psycho Beast

I had to get creative with custom spacers and 3d printed parts to keep the track as narrow as possible.

I only went for a quick ride and wonder why I ever bothered with thanes. If I lived in a place where all the roads were perfect then maybe but unfortunately this is not the case.
The ride is unlike anything I have experienced and it has transformed the board. I can even ride on roads where I had to get off the board and walk.
I still need to figure out what my wh/km is but as long as I have a 30-35km range I am happy
Finally, I now understand why everyone raves about @psychotiller. This guy has the best customer service I have experienced. Period.

Just speaking the truth man.
Here is the spacer I made to get the wheel closer to the truck in case anyone wants it.
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3147841
It is similar to this spacer only 4mm thinner
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2655613

In the back I used a 21mm spacer between the truck and the wheel and a 6mm spacer on the outer side to take up the extra bolt length.

In the front a 23mm spacer between the truck and the wheel and a 7mm spacer on the outer side to take up the extra bolt length.

Noice man. Knew You'd be happy. Those trucks with tillers parts are next level. I've got three new sets of urethane wheels..... trying to hold off getting addicted to 6shooters just yet myself.

Got my first two proper rides today.
I was grinning like a madman the whole time. 
I could stay on full throttle whenever I felt like it.

https://metr.at/r/3r5qx

https://metr.at/r/Ha209

Now I need a 13S10P and quad 6374s ü§£.
However the father and professional in me will tell me to settle for what I have (although I see 6374s in the not too distant future üòè). I am not a young man anymore.

@psychotiller you wouldn't have any 18T motor pulleys laying around would you? I feel the need, the need for speed. üòÇ

Fixed that for you. 
Send more money to @psychotiller

That should count as a few more punches on my card right @psychotiller?

Just a closeup to see how far out the axels are from the wheel. 

And you should go for the 42t. The extra speed is ok. But the feel is just much better. It will take some of the distance and torque then the battery run low, but you have 12s and that should be better... I think. (I run 10s).

I have the dimension of the spacers I made on my first post.

Seriously, I can't go to a 42T. Where I live is very hilly (think San Francisco). 
I already overheat my motors and on occasion my Focboxes and I am not that heavy (75-78kg depending on what I ate the previous night :joy:)

Sorry, does this use risers and wedges, will it work with 63mm motor mounts and 6355s?
```

Originally the board had risers and wedges.
I removed the wedges and settled for 20mm risers.
Due to the nature of the original eskating mounts and deliver trucks I could not remove the risers since the motors would hit the deck at full lean. Also with the 100mm wheels and the double stack enclosure it would be too close to the ground.
When I changed to Surfrodz trucks and psychotiller mounts, I removed almost all of the risers (left only one 6mm riser for the motor cables to pass under the truck)  since a) the mounts allowed for more adjustment and b)the bigger wheels give enough ground clearance without the need for additional risers.
Also the surfrodz baseplates are 44 degrees so there is no need to dewedge the front since with the 9 degrees the deck has it ends up at 53 degrees which is stable enough. With the 50 degrees on the caliber trucks I had to dewedge the front by 5 degrees since 59 degrees were a bit too sensitive when moving around my front foot at speed.

@taz could you take a photo of the trucks so I can see the riser size and all, like a side on shot.

Taz, do you need some 18t motor pullies?  I have some extras I got from Dickyho.  They are cheap, but take forever to arrive.

I could send you a set if you just back fill me.

Thanks man.
In the end, the terrain I ride on is not very friendly to a taller gear ratio. Too many steep hills.
I would just overheat the motors in the first 5 minutes of my ride if I changed to 18T.
I really appreciate the offer though so don't hesitate to hit me up if you need anything. I might be able to help.
