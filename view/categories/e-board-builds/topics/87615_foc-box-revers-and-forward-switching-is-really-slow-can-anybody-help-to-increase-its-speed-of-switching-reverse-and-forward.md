I don´t have all input fields in my head now, but i would look for the switching ERPM and set it more high, if that´s even possible.
But be aware that with it you set the speed at which your wheels start to turn backwards more high.
At factory settings it should be something around 3km/h.
Till this speed you can push your trigger as much as you want into the negative possition and nothing will happen.
If you set it up to 10km/h and hit full negative throttle than your wheels directly start to turn backwards.
As min in theory it should be like this...
