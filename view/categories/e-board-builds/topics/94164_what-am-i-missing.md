Can not for some reason get motor detection to work in bdlc . updated to new firmware. It will do the foc sensorless fine but feels under powered but when i check the battery settings its setting it up with crazy high numbers. When i change them to my battery specs the board runs worse. No faults reported. Im gonna try a different motor later today. But any tips or things to look into would be greatly appreciated

post screen caps of all settings. Maybe there's something somebody here will find that you're missing.

Last time I setup a motor had some detection result problems too but running through the wizard for motor setup seemed to resolve the issue(s).  Would just make sure the motor isn't loaded/being held back at all (remove belt) and make sure amps are set high enough.... would be good to know what happens when you try to do motor detection as well does it move at all?

motor does move, i have ran it just by itself. got it to work the first time and then when cleaned up the 3 wires then i had to redo the setup and thats when it started with the motor detection problem.
