My customer wanted a white on black witchblade GT, and i was immediately inspired by one of my favorite designers, Coco Chanel. So we started calling the board Coco and it stuck. 

It went through a couple of aesthetic changes along the way but i think the end result came out pretty smooth. 

It's not 100% completed as of this post, I still need to finish assembling it, grip it, and street test it. But it ships tomorrow and i wanted a thread about it. 

I'll be doing some white backdrop photos as well this evening once its put together before i put it on the street. 

## HERE'S THE PORN!

we'll know tonight. I stil have to drop the settings onit and bolt it up and grip it. I suspect it will ride much like a Witchblade GT usually does. 

Actually, with the designations we've been discussing...

This would be a GT/S (12S5P or bigger)

The top one is the second one similar to that that i did, and was inspired in the customer by the first one, which i'm pretty sure was inspired by a cartoon not unlike what you posted here. Crazy stuff.

Oh i almost forgot.. there's video of Holly cutting the chrome on Instagram. Holly is my die cutter. Her and Shirly mostly get along, but there's an awful lot of noise when they're in the room together. Can't tell if they're arguing or making fun of me.

in the coco, yes. They are underneath the phase leads in the wire channel. I ran black 20awg superworm as the sensor wires (that's what i use for balance leads and anything else i need small wire for). Previously i've been using a tequnique that involves creating a flat cable out of very very thin 24awg stuff and slipping it under the flange of the box. However, on some builds, that caused some problems, so now i'm doing what i should have done in the beginning.

Business is hard. Buying a shit load of stock to have on hand is hard. How much profit do you make in your builds...would lowering your price gain more customers? Thus gaining multiply small profits. Or raise price and lose potential customers but gain just one or two larger profit.

At the moment all money is flowing back into the business, there is no wage or profit. On paper i'm bleeding. In reality i'm growing.

people tell me i can charge whatever i want for my customs and they'd pay it. I kind of believe them, after seeing what i've seen. 

people also tell me they want something they can "just get" that is still a market murdering beast and reflects the soul of my typical customs, but doesn't cost quite as much and will be there in a few days instead of a couple months. 

So we'll do both. I can do both. I can do all four. this will be My Shit. I've already been building Your Shit. In a few weeks i'll be building Their Shit, provided the carvon boxes stay on the rough estimated schedule, and as you can tell with the evolve mods, the Other Shit is doing well too. So to sum up, the Four Shit Pillars of Esk8 are still holding up my precariously placed ass rather well.
