Hi there !
First big thank to Jason and this community, english is hard for me but I try !
I'm riding an e-longboard seens this summer, that I start to build 1 yr ago !!! And its so cool !.. Like you know !

... I was selling my setup... (I don't really have a good feeling with brake and the ride is so reactive in 10s ... And I try the Busted like by OKP ... dual vesc + r-pec ... GORGEOUS !!!)
but I dont know why I have never try it,  I thinks I'm gonna keep him and try with a VESC ! (okp told me to test that :smile: I have two of them from esk8.de for my e-mtb )

Maybe you remember this logo :blush:

now 1th test with *esk8.de* VESC HW4.10 FW 1.14 BLDC in 5S : 
[https://youtu.be/5cavXUXMtIY][2] 
the trigger is acting strangely, just some mm stroke and is directly on max speed ... 
it had to the fact that the test is empty?

Now in 10s : 
https://youtu.be/shL1H-r_mss
I have to watch to calibrate the stroke remote I think :smile: 

How that looks for you ? I never really see vesc programmation or test so thanks for your help !!!

Enjoy & good ride !

Hey man,

Have a nive day :)

Did you have any types of problems (just write them all, if you can)? I heard that these Flier's ESCs have quality issues...

hey Aigenic, I was with VESC but got APS ESC before that (when like you I have buy the kit, works fine, just some FW problem at first cause it was to us to find the good one (it was 2 yr before), OKP help me on that.
No shouldn't be a problem now I think (I hope).

The motor is fine, lighter and smaller than the older version... but more powa  ... works fine and looks really good !
