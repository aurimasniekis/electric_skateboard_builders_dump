Hey all!

After a tone of research and study, I think I've got everything i need for a mtb build. 
A couple of things im concerned about is:
- Do i need higher than 80a for my bms? / Change the bms config from buildkits?
- Would the batteries be fine for over 20km? (Hilly inner city riding Melbourne)
- Do i need to change the vesc settings like in the tab for this setup?
If anyone has any recommendations for alt parts that would work better would be greatly appreciated :smiley:  

Build: (Excel doc)
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cr9wY56VrvvGmJ0NvRqy2t7HWt7iCgy6BqOLUjkcQE8/edit?usp=sharing

Thank you all for your help so much info and especially @Namasaki 
(Started from not knowing much :stuck_out_tongue: )

Go 6384 and save yourself some cash. 6380 fills a niche and is therefore expensive. 

You are wiring in series to get 12s, which means you still only have 5000mah which is not nearly enough for 20km.  You need at least double that/most likely even more. I needed 15Ah, but I am heavy and tend to ride full throttle allot.

Aren't the 6380s by Torqueboards actually 6384 in stator size with a smaller can making it measure to 6380?

Yes...but the price is different. They made a custom motor to fit their trucks, but with trampa you can even fit 8xxx motors. No need for an expensive custom motor size.

Something like that. Your only determining factor might be how deep your pockets are and how long you are willing to wait. APS takes up to 4 weeks.

Every diy project with a vesc requires a complete setup from beginning till the end. Don't forget your remote failsafe either, it could save your life or that of others around you.

Only if the motors on stock...
Waiting already 10 weeks for my 6374 and 6384 motors from aps.
They wrote 6weeks if they on back order.
Hopefully they will ship today, than another two weeks for delivery and we made it to 3month and the end of the summer...

yeah you're right didn't realize it was going to be a full Trampa deck and trucks. definitely go bigger then without the same constraints as the Tb218 trucks for motor sizes

Dual 6374 is fine by the way. I haul 120kg Uphill off road at 35 km/h. The sk8 from hobbyking is most likely a good match. Personally running SK3 unsensored and it's holding up over 3000 km now.

If I understood right, this week they get the new batch of all motors which have been on backorder. So theoretically now is the best time to order ðŸ˜…
Just hope they made this time a quality check...
Looks like with the last batch of 6384 motors they had some issues ðŸ˜¬

Keep in mind that the aps 63xx motors have a 10mm shaft, most other like sk3/8, torqueboard etc. usually only 8mm.
Important to know when you choose your pulley!

Already a bit sad that I didnâ€™t order 4 sk3 motors... guess the 6374 is one of the most reliable motors on the market...unfortunately only unsensored

No short answer. Simple failsafe is programmed with just the receiver and the remote. You press a button on the receiver and hold the throttle neutral or with a slight brake to save that value. It will then use that value when the remote looses the connection. 

Ackmaniac's vesc firmware also has software level failsafe stages that can be programmed via his vesc tool graphical user interface. Visit the dedicated thread for ackmaniac's firmware for more info on this, he describes the steps involved.

yeah bigger motors as the Trampa trucks are all considerably wider than standard longboard trucks. as for the battery yeah you can scale way up as well. probably better to top mount as this is an mtb build

Sk8 is the sensored alternative. Supposedly it has almost the same internals as the SK3.

Would not go unsensored in the city.

You can always buy a sensor kit and install it by your own. 
Think even hobbyking has one listed.

Don't think you'd really need to run sensor-ed as you won't be starting on an even surface mostly. APS is what I usually see on atb builds and my first build isn't full atb so I can't give a good recommendation on other motor options for that use. Ideally sealed and then go big to handle the heat is my 2 cents

Thanks, i'll have a bit more of a look into sensorless mtb build and if i dont like it i guess i could put sensors on them.

Unik parts are well made so they should serve you well. I recall seeing even a sub 170kv motor for massive torque to get you over steeper terrain

I think both similar just with different kV.
I have the eskating.eu motors and they work flawlessly till now. Manly I used them for flat roads. For off-road or hill climps I would go below 170kV to have a better torque

I think it would be good to factor in gearing as well. Not sure of the sweet spot for gearing and kv for atbs though but generally 170kv and below is the idea I think

Definitely a good choice.
And @okp is here in the forum too and owner of unik boards ;)
ThatÂ´s always good!

I just had some time to look through your part list.
Trampa board is nice, the motor mounts not really.
The end cap for the motor pulley will only fit if your motor shaft long enough. For mine it didnÂ´t..
Get some motor mounts from unik boards or @Idea makes very nice ones too.
From both you can also get your pulleys too, and I think itÂ´s even a bit more cheep.  (by the way, how you come to 400 dollar just for the motor mounts?)
Get a push to start switch from @Martinsp
http://electricskateboard.repair/index.php?id_product=44&controller=product
Will save you another 20-25 dollar
your focbox you can get from unik also...save you the shipping
about lipos we where speaking before. you will not get your 20km range with a 5ah battery, so you need to step up on this point.
in my opinion, if you have a BMS from Bestech, you donÂ´t need a 130 dollar charger. There are a lot of good 12S chargers for about 50 dollars to find or from unik for 69 Euro.
get 10AWG instead of 12AWG. For a MTB with batteries in the middle it will reduce voltage spikes which could fry your focbox. The bigger the better. I use even 8AWG.
Don't forget to buy some JST adapters for your motor sensor wires.
The ones on the motor are 1,5mm on the focbox are 2mm.
and get some 5.5mm bullet connectors...focbox has only 3.5, your motor 5.5

aaand, get a Bluetooth modul...always good to track your rides. 
Will help you also to adjust the focbox settings later or find faults

Awesome info! just having some trouble finding the adapters you mentioned, Is this a thing i have to make or can but them from somewhere?
Also is this what you meant for a bt module?

## \#41 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-09-13T07:08:48.623Z Reads: 89

```
for the sensor wires you need this adapter
https://eskating.eu/product/sensors-adapter-jst-2-0mm-6-pins/

or just cut the 1,5mm jst and solder a 2mm jst 6pin plug to the old wires. (if you do, donÂ´t mix the black and the red wire ;) )

The Bluetooth module you linked would work.
but you also can get one for cheap, like this 
http://s.aliexpress.com/mIviqeUn
This works for IOS and Android, but it is a clone, so in case you run Oreo I think you need than to update the firmware on the module. If you have IOS you fine with it. Works on mine perfectly.

Another note on Bluetooth modules.
They work usually with all esk8 apps instead of the Metr app.
If you wanna use this app you need to purchase a special module.
