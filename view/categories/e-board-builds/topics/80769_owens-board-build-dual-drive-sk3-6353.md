Hi guys,

This is my first Electric Skateboard build and I am excited to share what I have done so far and keep you updated as I complete the build (if that's ever possible).

To begin my build, I purchased 2 of Hobbykings 6354, 260KV motors in their Black Friday sale, as well as LESS THAN IDEAL Hobbyking X-Car Beast CHEAP 150A, 6S ESC's. ( I thought that they were cheap and would help me to get started before I go and buy some VESC's.)  I also bought a 6S, 5000 mAh Lipo battery pack, ill need another later on, and a programming card for the ESC's.

![Basket|690x476](upload://bnzigM9Tvk2UEWM9vlypdUeW9tL.png) 



I then went on Amazon and found the CHEAPEST Longboard I could find which was the Deuba Atlantic Rift Longboard for Â£37.75. (I know, I know, it'll break)

![Board|690x302](upload://k5uoH9Qhw4DKvBADLocjZRTGDUP.png) 

This arrived and the bearings were as shit as I expected and the board would slow down on a hill... Also, the grip tape made it look very cheap so I ground it all off and varnished the board with 4 coats of water based floor varnish. 

In the mean-time, I was waiting upon my Slick revolution Jumbo 110mm wheels to arrive and grip tape which I could apply temporarily to I don't slip off when learning how to ride the thing.

![Wheels|690x300](upload://pTXzHfgMqgIIwJW048FRNaYfTmf.png) 
![IMG_20181208_150424|666x500](upload://oEKOGkAkFS4zcyBjGdZqhtPPmpQ.jpeg) 
![IMG_20181216_130333|375x500](upload://jeYQMPWqiNMoA4TibrmjpfM5egq.jpeg) !

I some belt sander paper to act as grip tape temporarily and bought some green 120 grit which I cut into hexagons to see how it would look but the colours didn't match my wheels and frankly, it looked dumb.. (trust me)

![IMG_20181208_222828|375x500](upload://gjVEPgNcikOLRwLJiRkwdieLQAs.jpeg) ![IMG_20181208_171417|375x500](upload://506Q0kfMoUKA9mxTKv9NbWEPfey.jpeg) 

THEN MY WHEELS AND GRIP TAPE ARRIVED and TRANSFORMED the look of the board.  ( even if I did cut it all wonky.. ) I don't have a great photo of this.

![IMG_20190103_211719|375x500](upload://l45gXOWylZTEVtUB6nq9G5u35AR.jpeg) 

I left the edges of the board exposed so the varnished wood could show through and I think it looked quite good. I also taped on a bike light so I didn't get killed when I went skating about with trusty old electrical tape.

I hadn't mounted my motors yet because I didn't have the money to order a mount set... (College Life) so started work on making an electronics holder for the bottom of the board.

I measured up all of my components and in college, made an MDF mould shape of what I wanted to vacuum form.
![IMG_20190107_154550|666x500](upload://mqZWuUGkuJCxkuxV8iFRCul1q3l.jpeg) ![IMG_20190108_094838|375x500](upload://pvtltEq5ipYTvhqSlnQ80z36V3q.jpeg) 
 I used the band saw and disk sander to add the desired angles to it and then vacuum formed it in 1.5mm PVC, giving me this:

![IMG_20190108_111030_1|375x500](upload://c7DwVYZ8Ik0ZRNwFoiLInLl0ms1.jpeg) ![IMG_20190108_112658|375x500](upload://vT5wSlmzIuXc3L8Cl0SxDdOoYBM.jpeg) 

Then, I marked a 30mm flange around each mould and cut it out, giving me an area where I can screw it down onto the board.

![IMG_20190108_115644|666x500](upload://8dNtQhiksRS3GI0yk0x1IuIuQYY.jpeg) 

I thought that the best way to attach these to my board would be to use M8 Threaded Inserts and Wing Bolts so I purchased these.

![Threaded%20Inserts|690x286](upload://2cxVFVgFB6QnrGy3WutmF6Kl7Dn.jpeg) ![Wind%20Bolts|690x285](upload://uc09zRUEKODe71DlgGxKmZjLIk4.png) 

I got these and marked out the points they would be placed on my board, ensuring there were correct distances away to reach the motors etc and drilled 10mm holes in the deck for the Threaded Inserts and 8mm holes in the same positions on my moulds for the Wing Bolts.
However, my threaded inserts were 15mm long and my deck was about 11 so I cut them down on the college lathe.

![IMG_20190109_095808|375x500](upload://oiN7xAGcGi07NKyxJ4fJgKDLe8w.jpeg) 
![IMG_20190109_093635|666x500](upload://vQHGYKUaMqNktIR72hUkkrtyoUw.jpeg) 
![IMG_20190109_093750|375x500](upload://jBEyQnsVYZCY66GuZufhTD76Xnx.jpeg) ![IMG_20190109_094007|375x500](upload://bD3y0zrtnonWrOmbojAhBQKNsAQ.jpeg) ![IMG_20190109_095711|666x500](upload://20wdJGG9PvJ9OnErd6kZO66yHyw.jpeg) ![IMG_20190109_100243|666x500](upload://pmeYHGKck3BOH3kYARZcpuTOgFG.jpeg) 

(I had to rip off the grip tape again to do this, which wasn't a problem as I want to add HEXAGON grip tape on later anyways)

I then added in the side Threaded Inserts and used a heat gun to mould the vacuum form around the shape of the bottom of the board, which worked...ish.

My motor mounts arrived from HobbyKing:

![Mounts|690x294](upload://1Hb5QnyqJogQYzSkB0Cc7yINaZn.jpeg) 

And I screwed them onto my trucks, did a test fit and thought about adding thread locker. ( I decided not too just in case I need to take them off when fitting my pulleys. 


![DSC_0796|690x458](upload://vD0G9a9iryntC2EBn7ppjX8Wh1m.jpeg) 

I then got my wheel pulleys from Slick revolution and just need to file down my truck hangers in order to fit the supplied bearing over then voila, when I get my belts and motor pulleys, ill be good to go.


![IMG_20190113_161706|666x500](upload://4Yo9LU9YBN22MajfdRB78h8UPhX.jpeg) ![IMG_20190113_162027|375x500](upload://iID9x9WwtPqnMg0DuzsYEKlnjv3.jpeg) ![IMG_20190113_162040|375x500](upload://qHCBh5EQ4INEpDVUZMKX1592rSA.jpeg) 

So next steps
- Cut hexagon grip tape
- GRP mould my enclosures
- Paint my deck black
- Insert my LCD screen to monitor current and voltage
- Buy battery 2
- Anything else I think of.

Hmmmph
I mean it's a cheap build, and no problem with, mine is cheapish too, but I think it's not the best idea to get esc for such a build, especially when vesc 4.12 are so cheap now : for just few pounds more it would be better...
Also 6s battery with 5Ah and pneumatic wheels... Your're not going far with this...

Yeah, I know. I mentioned in my post that I'd be getting another battery, maybe 3 more. I also mentioned that the ESC's were only temporary as they were so cheap and that i'd be upgrading to VESC's in the not to near future.

There it is!   Always do a thread for your ideas my friend.  Helps you and helps others doing similar things.  Looks great!
As soon as you get a chance upgrade the esc to vesc.  The HK SK8 are a good enough unit.  As you know the battery is too small really but you got that in the pipeline so all good and the motor mounts are one sided so when you come to align the pulleys you may run into issues.  
Great stuff and good luck with the progression.

Cheers mate, I also have the Sk8 6364 so once I get a VESC, will go single drive 12S I think. Also, what do you mean by the one sided mounts?

Cheers.

If you look at the mount they are identical.  They should be mirror images of each other so that the cut away section is on the opposite side.  You can still use them dual but you have to go dual diagonal or one motor reverse and one under the deck.  Clear?  :joy:  Basically they need to be left and right handed but they are only right handed meant for single drive.

Look at the mount and where the motor fits the area is half the thickness to allow proper alignment of the pulleys.  Looking at the image


![image|666x500](upload://moBdZM21GLYsTfMDqD0pM5m370A.jpeg) 

One side its flush and the other side is stepped out.  Looking at it now though you might be able to turn the one on the left expertly marked with an x upside down to keep the outside(wheel side) face flush.  Try it and see if the motors will still sit at the same height and angle.  Doubt it though.

Ahhhh, forgive my thickness.. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I understand now. I should've though of that when I ordered it. 

I guess I can turn one over if I position the motors at a 90 degree angle to the trucks (straight backwards), but that's if I struggle for clearance, which I probably will...

Cheers for your help!

Yeah, very cheap Paris style trucks, so will mount at any angle which is nice. I just want to keep the rear mounted style because I think it looks cool ;).

I get my motor pulley and belt tomorrow or Tuesday so will let you know what happens.

Forgot to account for the fact that i'd need a longer belt and I guess the pitch of the motor pulley and wheel pulley are different?

**HOW DID I NOT CHECK BEFORE ORDERING** :man_facepalming:

Me being dumb thought that the pitch is kinda standardised but looking at the belt now, clearly says HTD3 not HTTD5. I wish they had advertised this on Amazon so I didn't keep wasting my time ðŸ˜‚. 

Does anyone know the best place to get 18t HTD5 motor pulleys? Also longer belts?

Cheers/

Well made man. Make a nice Esk8 and do not spend too much is remarkable. Well done. Sick deck for the price. I hope that the max load pf 80 and something kg is a bit underestimated :grin:
Let we know how the wheels ride. They are fair cheap for being 110mm wheels. 
As other suggested upgrade to vesc when you can and a bigger battery too. Your build can be a rocket of you balance the esc and battery with the motors. It's a pity you missed the Flipsky 4. 12 vesc at 6.89 euro this morning. Some guys bought way more then needed maybe they can sell two of them to you for cheap. Check the last messages in the TaoBao's thread. :wink:

Flipsky 4.12 is now st 50 Euro shipped. Still a crazy price for a vesc.

I think I will invest in a Flipsky VESC and just use my single drive 6364 at 12S instead of dual drive.. This shit is getting **EXPENSIVE** for me (a college student)

Well Flipsky 4.12 is more a 10s vesc if you ask me. I know @visnu777 used at 12 foc with no issue but still not a vesc6. Yoy already have big motors. Better you just buy two Flipsky 4.12 VESC 100 euro and you upgrade the battery to a 10s. It will give you more torque and braking then a single drive. Dual is generally better.
```

## \#25 Posted by: Owen Posted at: 2019-01-15T19:06:13.832Z Reads: 65

```
I guess 10S makes more sense actually. 

Trouble is I have a 6S pack as it is so will have to sell it and buy either 2X5S packs **OR** I might get 5x2S packs because they will be smaller and mean my enclosure can be smaller but I guess their discharge rates are smaller so possibly not as ideal? But they would provide me with more mAh because I would get possibly 5X2200mAh packs giving me 11,000 mAh rather then a likely 10,000 from two packs. Charging would then be a bitch and idk if it's worth it, thinking about it.

Well you can actually buy a 4s pack. As long you connect them un series will make a 10s. I get your point for the thickness. For that 5x 2s is the best. For a 12s then 4x3s or 3x4s. For the Ah depends the use. If like 15-20km of range are fine then a 6000mAh should be enough
```

Ah, I didn't think you could do that because one pack would discharge faster than the other but I guess not in series! And thanks! never knew what sort of range i'd get from 10k mAh!

For the range and performance use an Esk8 calculator. It gives you good prediction. For the battery yes you can add it in series. As long the two pack has the same capacity they will discharge at the same speed

Only now I saw you bought two 260Kv motors. Thst is too high for a 4.12 VESC. You will pass the ERPM limit. Yuu could limit it in the vesc setting but you will loose a lot of performance. What you can do is change the wiring configuration. A 260Kv motor is probably wye and if you move to delta it will be 260/1.7= 150Kv. With 110mm wheels and the roght motor and wheel Pulley, would be plenty of fun and crazy torque. Here a quick calculation 

![15475838120835832634072265533590|666x500](upload://xgeLR3sG9mpjqJ9Rxvir6MnbEuc.jpeg)

Here you see a pic showing that https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/review-and-eu-usa-group-buy-90mm-mad-hub-motors-75kv-or-130kv-dual-170-euro-1st-round-closed-working-on-the-dd-conversion-kit-mad-fury/62002/269?u=rey8801
You find tutorial on Youtube but basically you only need to open your motor and see the 3 motor phase wires. If they go together in couple of 2 then they are delta and you only have to separate them. Solder one of each together and the 3 left are your new phase wires. Done, 150Kv motors...:wink:
```

```
I've been using that calculator and it's so helpful!

So you're saying that I need a lower KV to keep the ERPM down then. Can you also re-wind adding more turns to increase the magnetic flux through the field coils and then more torque? 

or could I just use 8S instead, lower the ERPM to 53782? I don't know the limit but thought it was somewhere around 60,000.

Looking at that link, I realised that that's what i've been doing in my Engineering class and in my **A LEVEL EXAM TODAY!** 

So, changing the wiring from a Delta formation to a Y formation, I should get more torque?
Cheers for all your help!

```
For 4.12 vesc erpm limit is 60K, for vesc6 based 100K usually. Anyhow for the actual fun you do not want to high Kv motor for 10s, 12s, because you end up with ultrasonic speed that you won't reach and lower torque. You want to find a balance. Now with the motors you have there are two ways:
1- Check the wiring if it is delta then you can decrease of factor 1.75 to wye and get lower Kv (Kv = rpm x Volt), meaning more torque, less speed. Then you balance the torque with the speed by playing with wheels and gear ratio as I mentioned in the previous post.
2- In case the motor are already wye configuration or you want a custom Kv. You will need to unfold all the copper wiring and redo it. There are calculator online that helps to find the number of turns, wire thickness ecc... Way more work compare to the first one that takes 1/20 of the time and effort. :wink:

Do you think the problem was the weak lamination or the wood itself? Because I am making a new deck and I have to choose which wood to use. The one you used I can find them easily

I originally just used the 3 layers of 4mm and it was too flimsy and it cracked slightly on the bottom so i glued the third piece on and when I tested it, it broke along that line. I think it would have been fine otherwise. (_**I also jumped on it a bit hard**_)

I see. Marine ply is quite strong I used to make a door to access to the garden for my dog. It's really flexible too. I would aspecting better result from it.

Yeah, I'm not too sure what happened. I needed 3 layers of it only because the grain was going across the board and not lengthways which is obviously a lot stronger so that's probably another reason why it broke.
