Hey guys just looking for people that have kicktail decks with the space cell 3. I bought a 40 longboard with kicktail recently to find out that it doesn't fit the space cell 3 with belt driven system. The length between the front and back truck is not enough. Anyone has achieve this?

you want something with at least 26" wheel base (28" recommended)

Doesn't look like it lists wheel base on its specs

No since I don't like kick tails, but perhaps you can find something who's selling the Raptor 1 deck. I thought I saw a thread for one pretty recently

I had a hard time finding a kick tail for my space cell 3 without modifying the case(there's a ton of extra space in the enclosure that is filled with foam) so I settled on the arbor highground. If you're willing to cut the enclosure I'm pretty certain it would fit an arbor backlash 37 and maybe a backlash 39 without cutting. I'm a big fan of arbor decks...they're the bees knees

Yeah I tried. It doesnt fit. If I had hub motors or carvon's it would fit fine.

What about a the rayne otherside 38"? Awesome deck, I love my rayne darkside 36" for freeriding.

Like I said, wheelbase. It's not about the length of the board

Yep, you can have even less if you plan on rear mounting the motors or if you use hubs
