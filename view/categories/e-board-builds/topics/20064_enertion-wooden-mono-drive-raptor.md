R-spec 63x74mm motor.
Vesc X
Nano X
S.P.A.C.E cell pro 3
12mm Mono drive mech. kit. 
Jet - Black Death 8 ply maple, its a very stiff deck.
Custom blue/gold grip tape design 
I've put her through hell and she works beautifully.
My roads aren't smooth at all so the power wheels have some chips in the side. 
Accident : 1 Forgot to locktight motor mount, motor fell off at 45 km/h and dragged on the floor till I stopped. 
accident : 2 tried the same gearing ratio with 107mm offroad wheels, a total of 20 mm of wheel touching the road at 70Km/h resulted in a broken helmet and no skin on my arms.
accident : 3 took a corner at 45 km/h, the sprinklers had watered the road and I went through lovely lady Donna's fence.
accident : 4, locked skateboard up outside at school, it rained heavily.
Despite all of that its still working perfectly, I'm alive because helmet. 
I seriously doubt it would still work perfectly if I used hobby grade components. Enertion is quality
I'm not sure why the photos are upside down, ohwell.

Very nice project, I like your black wheels. See if you can change the position of some of the photos. Show us some videos of you riding also. :slight_smile:

thanks mate, Ill try recording on the way to work tomorrow, I don't have enough teeth on the black wheels sprocket yet so it doesn't have enough torque for offroading, ill hold me ipad the right way up for photos next time

Awesome,

Where did you get those other wheels and does it fit good on the enertion mono kit? I have the monokit as well but I get a lot of vibrations while riding, even some electronics are dead because of it. I am searching for offroad wheels and yours seems good since it also fits the kit.

I can't find the exact same wheels but there's ones will do, I drilled holes in the drive wheel for one of enertions old aluminium 36tooth pulleys, it runs good but it doesn't have the torque for off-roading sadly, need a bigger drive pulley

Yeah ðŸ˜‚ I think I might think about selling mine for my final build too actually, it'll take a chunk out of the total price
