My latest build was a bit of an experimental build in terms of wheels. I saw this AT deck for sale and couldn't resist turning it into an e-skate.

```
@JLabs belt size is such that I can have an idler without hitting the wheels.
smaller skate wheels isnt an issue, but the larger diameter 5X1"s needed more space.
plus the idler bolt head also has to clear the motor on the inside.
that's the shortest belt I could go with on this setup.

Do you have some stats for this board? What speed do you get? also a bit unclear what voltage you got.. so difficult to draw out any numbers.. 

(though, I assume it could be 6s, as these look like regular car escs :) )

Non the less.. nice board.. I wonder how these wheels work out.. they are not 100% pneumatics after all..

Yeah.. i dunno how fast you wanna go, I draw the line at about 35. I don't need to go any faster than that.
fuck imagine a spider to the face @ 40km/h!!  35km/h seems to scare the snakes off tho..

yep, 35 is totally fine for these extra times you want ''bursts of speed''.. though, ''maximum'' of 40 is advised, I think, not to push the motor/esc to the max when going faster..

hah nice reference to the snakes lol..

Does these wheels ''dampen'' the vibration nicely? 

[Edit]

Im not sure how it really went, but this user, didnt get nice experience with his amazon bought tires:

with no motor the wheels stop your board within 1 or 2 meters on concrete even downhill, and i have 74kg. I also wanted to do a eboard with this but after testing it on the street i knew i won't. Its a strange feeling when you have to push the board downhill, otherwise you stand still. On the same street with my longboard i have to break all the time not to get too fast :joy: @lowGuido I wonder what's the range with your 10Ah battery with this build?

[/quote]

Actually good question! I assume he might get something in between mountainboard and longboard consumtion.. I would say 14wh/km?

With that.. I would theoretically calculate ~12.7km at fully charged and fully depleted battery.. So in real life this might probably come close to 10-11km, That is, of course, if he does not have higher wh consumtion per km.. or his battery is rated differently than how I calculated (3.7v x 6cells x 8 ah), plus, he has two motors, so I assume 10-15% less range? 

Battery Discharge test?
---
---
I think would be cool, if @lowGuido could do a ''discharge test'' for those of us, who are curious about distance and energy consumtion!..

@lowGuido if you havent done this a lot.. I think the easiest is to charge your batteries till full, then go out to ride as much as you can with constant speed (if possible) and then when charging back to full, spend attention on how many Ah has been pumped back into the battery.. 

Then based on how many kilometers / miles, you made.. you should get an approx measure of wh per km..

I started a build with this deck and kegel wheels. The idea was to have a drop-through feeling with this drop deck without switching the motor to the back. I drilled new holes more outside to give the motor some room. I planned a top mount 10s 5Ah battery with bms and vesc for 20km range in the middle. I don't like the high position on most eboards, i love the stability escpecially on turns when it's lower to the ground. But i stopped that build because i prefer a shorter wheelbase.. So if someone is intersted in this deck, the 195mm black trucks or the 125mm offroad wheels with black hubs, just tell me. I would sell it (also in parts) for a low price (shipping in europe).

Woah.. that's some awesome range!

I assume that means:

**500mah (0.5 Ah) per km**
11.1 Wh / km (0.5 X 22.2v nom)

Cannot wait to fit my 6 inch wheels then.. I wonder what range I might get with these..

Yeah I saw the board for so cheap I couldnt help myself. As you say the grip is rubbish and so were the trucks and bearings. The deck itself seems ok.

Oh and I made everything by hand. As I do with all of my builds.. no fancy 3D printers or CNCs here.

I tried to calculate the gear ratio as close as possible to my street wheels. With street wheels I get about 22km from 10Ah. Also with the idler pulley setup it allows me to run quite a loose belt which makes a far more efficient drive.

mate, contrary to popular belief I'm not here to argue on the internet. just to share what I have done. I know what works and what doesn't because I have built Heaps of different boards that I experimented with and designed myself rather than just doing what everyone else does. 

to be honest I don't even care if people don't believe. there are people on here who still believe that narrow trucks don't turn tighter and that single drive will pull to one side. I'm not even gonna start on my Uneven Drive system...

at the end of the day I'm not telling anyone to do anything just sharing what I have done.


I mean If I had listened to people (to be honest I didn't see that thread.) about the quality of this board I never would have built it. and missed out on all this fun.

How do the wheels feel compared to a normal urethane wheel. I guess they are softer. And does it feel like there is air inside or are they completely filled? And can you measure the weight of them. Seems to be a interesting option.
Wondering if they are also stable at higher speeds because i like to go around 50 km/h max.

When i loosened the axle nut, the original bearings came apart. Never had such experience before.
But my testride was with nice brand new bustin abec7 bearings, the rubber of the wheels is the problem. But maybe you got "lucky" wheels with different rubber. Did you try the board without motors, too?

Unfortunately for the entire build period I had a broken foot so I couldnt ride. There is no doubts that these wheels have a much higher rolling resistance than thane street wheels. As do pneumatics. But I have never ridden pneumys either so I cant compare.

@Ackmaniac there is no way I would ride these at 50. Then again I wouldn't ride thane at 50 either.

I mean I am a snowboarder. And I do 50+ on snow regularly but concrete is far less forgiving than snow.

And the hub of the wheel looks to me like there is a chance that flywheel pulleys might fit.

Originally i wanted 5" pneumatics but it's hard to find. And to order 5" skike pneumatics is only nice when you own a lathe to make it fit. That's why i ordered the rubber tyre board. when it was delivered i was full of joy and started planning how to mount the pulley and so on. A friend visited me and asked if i tried it on the street. I said no, why, these are perfect tyres for my build. Later we went outside to test it. The first time i pushed with my foot i almost fall forward because the wheels brake like hell. Compared to a longboard,with like one or two pushes you reach min. 20 meters, with the offroad wheels maybe 1 meter. Then i took the bus up the hill to test it downwards and was amused that i almost stop and have to push it downhill. That's why i never did this build. I have a mountainboard with wide 9inch offroad pneumatics. The rolling resistance is less on concrete compared to the rubber wheels but still high.

I couldn't resist and also ordered a board for myself. I hope i can fit flywheel pulleys to the Hub. I think some little modifications and they might fit. But i will let you know.
If they fit then it still would be smarter to have a pulley with more teeth for my 10S and 12S. I think 50 teeth would be great because then you could use it with a 15 teeth motor pulley and 190 kv motors and the speed would be around 55 km/h with 12 S and around 45 km/h with 10S.
But maybe the wheels are also crap.

I also bought the board. 35€ on the german ebay. So it won't be a too expensive mistake.
The bearings are very bad but we knew that already. The trucks is cheap bullshit but i didn't expect something else.
The board itself seems to be ok. Relatively stiff so that we won't get a issue with the battery.
But now to the wheel.
They smell like hell. When the wheels are in your room you have to open the windows. Otherwise the entire flat smells. 
The hubs are bigger then ou can see on the pictures. Because the rubber is only around the Hub plastic and it moves on the sides so that you can have a look under it. And the rubber isn't very soft. It's comparable to a 75A uethane wheel but with much less contact of course.
Sadly the Hub is slightly wider than a normal skateboard wheel. So i don't know if the hub and a enertion pulley would fit on a chopped enertion caliber truck. Could be tight.
The spacers in the wheel are slightly too wide and the bearings don't match exactly with the Trucks axle so that they can slightly move. But we knew already that the bearings are shit.
With some little modifications a flywheel pulley would fit the hub. So i think i will give that wheels a try when i find the time. But the problem is that i would need bigger pulleys than 36 teeth. For example 50 would be great.
When i go over bad roads then the wheels don't perform bad. But i don't think that they are very stable at high speeds.
And i also don't think that they will have a lot of grip and i also think that they won't last long.
And i wouldn't call the wheels soft. They are OK but definitely not soft. I guess the big wheel size makes the biggest difference that they are ok when you go over bad roads.

With the board itself i think it is possible to fit the motors with enertion motor holders under the board when you drill new holes to put the axle position a bit further away.

I just had the board up to 35km/h and I started to get some speed wobbles.. nothing aggressive or uncontrollable but Id feel safer tightening the trucks for any speed higher..
I also took some videos over some different terrains which I will upload later tonight.

one thing that I have noticed most of all:

the tyres are wearing really quickly I have only done 22km and the tread is already showing signs of wear!

I'm not sure if they are solid rubber or what so I don't know how far they can wear before they need replacing?
also short of buying another complete I'm not sure where you would even source replacements.

on range of the board: I did 7 km at lunch time today and I charged 4580mah

@lowGuido  Hate to hear about the tire wear..
Ok from latest data u gave now it is about **14.5wh/km**

 ( 4.580 Ah / 7=  ~0.654 Ah/km = x22.2v (6s Nom volt) = 14.525 Wh / km )

Though I assume you went really fast this time, so there should be some reference to the speed.

oh P.S. you think I'm joking about snakes?
I have seen brown snakes on the path when skating before.
eastern browns are pretty common down here. one of the deadliest in the world.

@Pantologist I don't like snakes and spiders as much as the next guy, but do you not drive your car because you are scared of a crash?
car crash are far more common than snake bites.

you can't just wrap yourself up in cotton wool and stay indoors because you are scared.. you need to live

@Ackmaniacmy mate was on regular 70mm thane.. I know right.. props to him for trying to follow me most places :D

Oh P.S.
This thing is still cruising around on those wheels everyone thought wouldnt roll (or something) and while the "tread" wore off on the first few rides it seems that it was only really there for decoration. The wheels appear to be solid rubber and they work better bald.

Hey, where'd you find those wheels? I'm really looking for a lighter wheel that is also larger.
