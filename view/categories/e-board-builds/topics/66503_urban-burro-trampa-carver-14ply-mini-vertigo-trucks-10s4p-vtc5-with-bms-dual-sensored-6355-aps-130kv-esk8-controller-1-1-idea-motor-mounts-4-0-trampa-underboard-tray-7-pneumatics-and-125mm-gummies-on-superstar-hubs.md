Oh lord, I started this hybrid build in february 2017 and finally finished it yesterday night 16 months later. 
During building I’ve swapped motors, motor mounts, pulleys, tires and enclosure without using it a single day. 

Here some pics of the finished board, more details about building will follow soon, took a lot pictures. On Gummies the gearing is 15T/44T and for 7” tires 15T/60T. Swappable within a few minutes. The estimated range should be about 40km with Gummies and 20km with pneumatics. Top speed is about 35-38km/h and with Gummies the total weight is 11.4kg. This build is for commuting in the city.

My impression after my first test ride is very positive, it’s smooth but also a beast. I had a constant big grin in my face until one motor pulley came loose after 10km. I was afraid that 6355 motors won't give me enough power but the 130kv have nice torque at least with the Gummies.

It’s quite carvy with springs in inner position (with yellow dampas) but scary at speed. Since I have the E-Toxx elastomere dampers on my MTB I need this for the urban burro, too. The rebound is smoother and not springy. I need to pimp my ride 

@Nowind  when are they back in stock?

I have every Trampa spare part at home except 3/8" nuts. Unfortunately 2 threads on the Mini Vertigo hangers are not perfect and damaged 2 nuts, no way to find them locally so I had to fix it that way for now :crazy_face:

I'll switch to helicals on my MTB to get a feeling for it first.
Also I don't know yet if I prefer Gummies or pneumatics or both. It's easy to change the gearing with belt setup, with gears you would have to change motors if you want the same "feel" for both kind of wheels. 

Also there is no gear drive for Mini Vertigo Trucks and as commuter for the city I prefer it compact. Let's see.

Had my second ride today for about 2 hours including shopping test :grin:

![194656|690x388](upload://yZQFiuptkmmSRgs8zBOL6jWGW81.jpg)

![194718|690x388](upload://bJiONSQtefwZQI88Xx3x3RifwdQ.jpg)

All motor screws came loose and both motors slided down leading to funny skipping, need to switch from flathead to sockethead screws and use Loctite. Describing the Gummies is not easy, they feel like longboard wheels but also not :laughing: They handle curbs like a king which is great but they are too small for chestnuts, the board sent me flying but nothing happened.

I have some serious problems with the new Maytech remote. There are areas where it disconnects all the time and areas where it stays disconnected. I found out that the connectiion is safe below my knees so I can ride but it looks like I'm mentally ill. In most areas there are no connection problems no matter how far I hold the remote away, strange. Disconnections are very dangerous especially during accelerating or braking. Also on my first ride I had some disconnections during accelerating and braking but just randomly at some spots and not like today in whole areas.

About safety, this is my gear for this board

Thanks mate! 
16 months sounds sick but I had many throwbacks and did a lot of things twice. First I wanted to thermoform an segmented ABS enclosure. It took a lot of time for the mold, vacum table and so on. After many fails I gave up and ordered the Trampa tray.  Also I've built Version 1 and 2 of [my MTB](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/dirt-machine-trampa-holypro-16-ply-vertigo-trucks-superstar-hubs-unik-polaris-6374-150kv-e-toxx-black-direct-drive-vesc-6-12s/45377) within this time.

Not similar but very similar but also different, haha maybe I find the right words after more rides. You feel and hear every single crack on concrete or tiny stones like with longboard wheels but you can roll over bigger cracks and stones. They feel more comfy than smaller wheels but absolutely not comparable with pneumatics where you don't feel cracks or anything. But the gummies can deal with grass and hard packed dirt without problems.

:grin:

As long as it's not too soft or wavy it works well because of the diameter of the gummies. 

Unfortunately it's raining the next days but after that I want to shoot a video showing the gummies rolling over different terrains. Maybe also with 7" tires if I solve the wobbling hubs/pulleys problem soon.  

I'm collecting pics of the building process and writing text right now so probably tomorrow I can post some more details about this build :sunglasses:

I just recognized that I've lost 5 screws (of 14) which hold the trampa tray and have some loose ones. Damn I thought the rubber o-rings prevent the screws from unscrewing but I guess it doesn't work upside down. I have to use Loctite, lesson learned. For now I use washers and bigger o-rings but I have to find some proper rubber washers instead.

Blue Loctite (243) is king :rofl:

Yeah, I was thinking of red LocTite, but you bring up a very valid point. I need to be able to remove the enclosure so the blue one will be a better choice.

That's also why my motor pulley came loose on my first ride. I had problems with the thread of this pulley and used Brunox turbospray (oil based) to fix the problem. It worked but I didn't degrease it properly afterwards. Last time I took alcohol, brake cleaner plus a special degreaser like usually, it holds now.

Alcohol works great, when I get new fasteners I leave them for half an hour in it and wipe after

For the pulley, you can put in the stove and all oil will burn away, I do this a lot in my mountain bike to clean the brake disc

@12meterkuk I'll post the details and pics very soon, promised. It was a lot of work, I think I would choose @Eboosted enclosure instead of Trampa's if I would do it again. 

My problem right now is that I have 45 minutes of video footage to edit for a crazy video, it takes forever........

Furthermore I crashed 2 days ago and my elbow and one hand hurt a bit but no problem. I didn't see the wet sticky mud on asphalt which was like ice, too fast and no traction with gummies so I met the wall and fell backward.

Yes M4 but better use stainless steel, mine are standard and kinda soft, one broke during turning in. It is important to pre-drill the exact needed size for the threaded inserts (which is mostly not a standard size). Before drilling holes in the deck try it with hard wood e.g. MDF and find the perfect diameter of the hole. If the hole is too small you'll get a small hill around the insert. If it's too big the insert won't hold well. Search for charts in the internet for pre-drilling diameters for hard materials to get an idea which drill bit(s) to try.

Search and find :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

After over 100km on this board I have some feedback. The Gummies have nice grip and feel good beside the fact that you feel and hear every crack but very smooth on nice concrete. I’m so used to pneumatics that it needs some time but I like them. Especially I like the double range, was riding 4 hours non-stop (OK 1 stop), great!

The first damages appear

![145946e|690x388](upload://rqW4Q40JS48FHfvNynwLhBxnzAo.jpg)

I really have to change the new maytech remote due to heavy interference problems. I like the shape and the 2 modes but safety first. Abroad I have perfect connection for at least 10 meters distance from the board (didn’t try more) but in the city it frequently shrinks to 0.2 meter. That’s ridiculous.

I have very very very loose belts and still no skipping, I didn’t expect that but I guess that will change with bigger pulleys on 7” wheels and less teeth in mesh. The APS motors are very silent in FOC as long as I don’t accelerate, then they start to scream. 

I have springs with yellow dampas in inner position, without dampas it feels shaky. The carver carves well but not at (very) low speed. I have better turning radius with my MTB, waiting for the elastomere dampers to be back in stock, hail @Nowind and @Duffman for this mod!

![130903|690x388](upload://kIpmGeM3v5TqJOzB7ZUu2rTZ08.jpg)

I stepped on the connected charger cable and the charging port is loose now, need to dismount the enclosure and secure the nut with threadlocker (if there is still a plastic thread), damn. Lesson of the day: “Don’t charge your board in the middle of the room”

Got the M4 rubber washers today, seems much better than o-rings for the tray.

Bought mine as set
Repair threads, drill and drill to precut the thread (sorry don’t know the English word for it)
With it you definitely have the right size.
Usually it’s also written on the thread itself as d=1.5 or 2.5 thats how much more thick the insert is from the original hole. Like for m4 and d=1.5 you need a drill with the size 4.1mm

I would also add some epoxy or any other kind of glue to save the threads stronger in the trampa deck material. I opened mine every time for charging and with time they will become lose if not glued.

Ah OK repair threads are different, I was talking about standard threaded inserts for wood.

I hope not, I didn't use glue :laughing:

Today I met @slick for a pair ride in vienna, after some time we discovered another pair and boom, suddenly this was a original group ride! We had a lot of fun and looking forward to meet again.

Finally as promised here more details about this build, feel free to ask for further information.

ENCLOSURE

The Trampa tray is very pleasing to the eye, same look, same material but it was a long journey and ordeal to finish. You saw and saw and saw and saw and saw and saw and saw and saw and saw and saw and saw and saw and saw and saw and saw and saw and saw. Then you fall asleep and your arm hurts the next morning.

First I cut both sides to desired width and shortened the length. Then drilled the holes to prevent cracking and cut the tray in 7 segments to allow flexing.

![003731|666x500](upload://3NAw4qopAgrughemxnjts5k0zCc.jpg)

I thought I’m clever when using a japanese saw to get tiny slices but I forgot that it needs more space when bending it upward in shape of the deck. So I sanded down all slices until they were big enough. 

![163822h|690x388](upload://clkb7YwNYbLUhPiUp8qwmy836He.jpg)

![165628h|690x388](upload://ctzt8S9rHG8W7Axf8C3Bq3kgvO9.jpg)

![000138h|690x388](upload://ncagLSVrL7aZPVRZfWbE7HrWYIM.jpg)

If I would do it again (which I don’t) I would make bigger slices that there is enough room to seal it with black silicone. I also saw pics of beautiful CNC machined trays.

Drilled some holes for threaded inserts (M4 OD 6.5mm). Pre-drilled with 2mm drill bit first. The trampa material is special, the difference between drill bits must be at least 2mm otherwise the drill bit gets stuck. No problem to drill with 5 or 6mm after 2mm pre-drilling.

![003259h|690x388](upload://kOrEns25X0ASWTrtc9Cb4soNILW.jpg)




As end pieces I use 8mmx25mm wood, same shape as tray machined with a coping saw and painted in black later. The same wood is used as support (for impacts) in the middle of the tray.

![173224h|690x388](upload://q5SD7ZJSsRJG0BGBJqOGcoIHaYD.jpg)

I wanted to mount the electronics to the deck and had already mount the end pieces to the deck. In the end I did id the opposite way and glued the end pieces in the tray.

![202119h|690x388](upload://yqiB1uv2AolXpzshAZfAhUcWMGJ.jpg)

BATTERY

I soldered 10x 4p packs with 1mm flat copper wires (equal 3mm²) and angled copper bar for serial connections (equal 4mm²) with 80-100W iron and flux. First I wanted to use copper bar only but that didn’t work well because it’s so rigid and I damaged 2 cells (which I replaced).

![221728h|690x388](upload://A1I0abYbmtl84ktECgT5eManhJQ.jpg)

![220703h|690x388](upload://j5HFbQsWBlIlPy0Yah14vKWnady.jpg)

![152944|690x388](upload://l1Nhl72lN6ClrLPq1i285oFcczv.jpg)



Underneath the angled copper bars and all positive connections is fishpaper. I ordered the insulation rings at nkon.nl and they have it in sheets as well - the mystic fishpaper

I was very skeptical how a paper could be heat resistant but this material is the shit! Perfect safety for Li-ion cells.

I also used it as underlayment for pre-tinning the flat wires and copper bars. First I used a 1mm silicone mat to protect the table from heat but after a while soldering with 480°C the silicone melted. The insulation aka fish material gets a bit sticky after a while but never really damaged, it’s still does the insulation job plus the silicone mat underneath looks good and is not melted. 

Heat shrinked all 4p packs and glued them into the enclosure before soldering serial and balance connections. This "glue" is soft, flexible and stays flexible and is mouldable, also used it to cover all slices and holes, it can expand and shrink. Time will tell if it's long lasting but I can hold the enclosure upside down and nothing moves and it's kinda shock absorbing.

![024055h|690x388](upload://imc4kQSshzDQTpOeh6nrSQ0h966.jpg)

Soldered all serial connections with 2x 14AWG in a curve to allow movement when flexing, same with balance wires (20AWG).

![elec|562x500](upload://ntG9PgPmndB91CwcxtRMncyxbIZ.jpg)

![221226h|690x388](upload://5mQ4XKtll3Q9x64DMECzyTx4Krx.jpg)

On/off switch and charge port. The third hole is for a switch for lights but had no time to finish it. Better to ride now and finish this feature in winter. Between tray and deck is 3mm neoprene foam.

![223544h|690x388](upload://rGip8qqzWm3BqdscqDcJckw5uI9.jpg)

MOTOR MOUNT

I bought an urban carver mount from @Idea last year with steel plates and aluminium rings, it’s a great mount but the plates would bend without crossbar and I don’t like crossbars, also I want it black and that’s difficult with stainless steel. That’s why I ordered the 4.0 mount which can be used without crossbar and it’s aluminium, so black anodizing together with the 60T pulleys was the first step.

![111609h|690x388](upload://eyohmr1ruULAAhXTAmg3PpqabOo.jpg)

![124209h|690x388](upload://8urGGb4Wk0wZwKA9cZtLV3KCHef.jpg)

![124338h|690x388](upload://eHOA202a9QQZzrPQA4Y7uit756t.jpg)

Unfortunately the mini vertigo hangers are not that accurate as ATB hangers. The mounts fit much better on the ATB hangers, it’s impossible to mount them with the correct angle to the mini vertigo’s and the contact area is not much. 

![004042|690x388](upload://rgcN3bzG5iV53g62yXoJ4A7xk9N.jpg)

![002950|690x388](upload://1ETw23I1kY7AyUrG20APjDI9waN.jpg)

I ended up with adding stripes of insulation and kapton tape to achieve the proper angle (that took a while), it lasts so far.

![195616h|690x388](upload://plajAi2qKH3MkIo2JVFUE0EOqBU.jpg)

![004258h|690x388](upload://70f5alSlSPC34qs1GLM7sWfdxPh.jpg)

STRESS RELIEF CLAMP

I route the motor and balance wires through the hole in the baseplate (inside big shrink tube). For stress relief I machined an aluminium pieces and cut M3 threads. The other piece of the clamp is 2mm ABS with neoprene foam, does the job well.

Dude - legend. Great detail and pics to show what you have done. You have spent a lot of time on this - I'm envious. When I started my build, I wanted everything to be perfect but at the end, I couldn't give a shit, so it doesn't look as good. 
Your builds are very inspiring.

Thanks bro! 

Also not everything is perfect on this build but I tried to make it look like :laughing:

My first esk8 was looking very bad and I had a lot of troubles but riding was fun and I got addicted. Then I ordered parts already for a better version but I fell in love with the urban/street carver when I saw threads/pics of @Kaly and @whitepony. I didn't know how much work it will be with this flexible deck and how much it costs in the end.

Did some calculations, the total costs of this build are about 1700€ (1970$) damn that's a lot  :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

Yeah man, If I would have know just how much it would cost, before I got started, then I'm not sure if I would have chosen DIY. Sure, it is satisfying to build something, and it is nice to know that you can customise things, but, heck, it takes a lot of time, and money to do this. With brands, like LaCroix, now emerging, it brings another option to the esk8 field.
I wonder how long it will be before brands like MBS start to bring out their own dedicated electric mountainboard?

Curious to see that other people had exactly the same thoughts and problems like I with this tray.
Like the end covers. I also planed first to mount them on the deck but than just understood it’s more easy to glue them on the tray.
For my next build I bought some copper bars like you did, but didn’t used in the end...guess I need to rethink that point too.

Honestly your built looks too much similar to mine 😅
How you feel with the Esk8.de vescs?
I didn’t had so much luck with them.
First they arrived with damaged plastic cover.
Than one stated to throw some abs over current faults and after two 3 weeks one total blew with a drv error. They also got quite quick hot without extra hole in the enclosure. In dual it wasn’t an issue but after I blow one and could only drive single, I got temp cut out after 5min...
Still didn’t found the cause of it, my vesc settings have been on point...maybe 11s 190kV wasn’t that optimal for them. Idk

Looks like we should write a new official trampa under board tray thread with all our experiences so far 😅 if you start like I did with the thread from @trampa it’s gonna be way much more work than it need to be. I was bloody beginner and just wanted to follow the instruction one by one...didn’t work out as i couldn’t find some parts easily in Russia. Especially when it comes to the battery lay out I think it‘s good to see some alternatives. Still don’t know where to get this tufnol from...it also didn’t work out for me to mount the battery to the deck and just use the tray as cover. I was waiting 2,5month for the end covers as they where on stock but after I ordered they said they need first be produced...ended up getting a 3D printer and designed my own.

I like DIY because you can build it exactly how you like (if you don't calculate :wink:), you can fix problems by yourself or find answers in this great forum. You can tweak settings, change motors or whatever you want to change later. This is not possible with commercial boards (least of all with no knowledge).

I think like many other people I started DIY because of saving money. In 2015 I've tried an evolve (1st generation) but 1200€ was way too much. I met a distributor of evolve who told me he probably could organize me one for 600€. He wrote an e-mail to the chief of evolve germany and the answer was: " I can buy it for 1200€ and get 2 belts for free!!! :rofl: Time to do some research and DIY. Unfortunately I did no proper research (e.g. how to build an esk8 for 300$ on YT) and had to buy everything twice to finish my first esk8. After finishing and riding it for months I knew I have to build a proper one. Finally here it is.

[quote="slick, post:44, topic:66503"]

Haha thanks! It took so much time because my main tools are my brain and hands. My hands want to machine and work but my brain says: "no only one try, do it proper". I've spent 100-1000 times more in thinking and planning compared to building.

I like all the 3D printed parts on your build, that's something I can't do.

[quote="Andy87, post:45, topic:66503"]

[/quote]

For parallel connections copper bar sucks, flat wire is much better because it's flexible. When you pre-tinn the cells plus copper bar it's impossible to get the rigid bar flat on the cells without gap (or without heavy mechanical stress). When I tried to desolder a bar (which is impossible) I ripped off the thin metal sheet of the minus pole on 2 cells. Don't try this at home.....

[quote="Silverline, post:46, topic:66503"]

[/quote]

With the slices you made you can bend the tray upward to fit the shape of the deck but you restrict the flex. If you have a stiff deck or want it stiff this is the way to go. But I want to enjoy the flex of the 14ply deck. The reason why I didn't make additional slices like you have is that I don't use this tray as cover. Every of the 7 segments hold the battery/electronics and I wanted the segments rigid. With additional slices it would bend in the middle of the segments, not good for glued parts.

[quote="Andy87, post:47, topic:66503"]
Still don’t know where to get this tufnol from…
[/quote]

Forget this tuffnol, a middle spine is enough IMO.
The tray has only 23-24mm height so there is no space for additional material beside padding/glue. And I use 3mm neoprene foam as gasket. But it's important that nothing can move inside the tray.

Yesterday I've tried to fix my heavy interference problems of the Maytech MTSKR1712 remote. Re-matched and tried 2 other positions inside enclosure but as expected no difference at all, drop outs all the time in certain areas, traffic lights, main streets, houses, gas station ...... I'm done with this lethal remote, had so many dangerous moments.

Switched to my replacement Steez for MTB (Maytech MTSKR1512) and WOOOOOOOOOW no more drop outs as it should be. I am so happy to have a reliable remote again. Great experience to be able to break or accelerate when I want. Going downhill is no more a nightmare.... only thing the receiver is soooooooo big.

After dismounting the enclosure I realized my gasket sucks :laughing:

![165415h|690x388](upload://u6rysNP9yRLalKuVBTOuBzlYPIh.jpg)

Changed the gasket from 3mm neoprene foam to 1.5mm solid rubber plus 2mm neoprene because it was too much compressed, still experimenting, have to make it more dust/splashproof but first priority for now is to protect the inside. The tray is 24mm but I need 25-26mm that's why it's not safe to use neoprene only.

It's ugly but the quickly applied sugru does the job against movements supporting the short cables and solder joints on the controllers.

All around and especially at the end caps, filled the phase wire holes only for safety.
I have a special foam tape to solve this problem next time I open the enclosure.

But i have a problem with a drivetrain or motor, there is some resistance, damn..... need to investigate after work.

This video was a nightmare to edit because of too much footage, didn't finish just stopped it. Very nice fresh tarmac :sunglasses:

https://youtu.be/ojPnVqbH0tc

One motor mount moved and the angle changed so I had to mount it straight again. This is my DIY "helping hand" to get the correct position (30mm distance). Changed the angle with a small stripe of duct tape again.

![042028h|690x388](upload://AadAZJQRtFLZ6ZtzGbCeBUOWIKt.jpg)

I thought it's a good idea to have some light on the board and made a mount. Bent a plastic angle with heat gun and glued 1mm rubber before mounting to the baseplate

![212721h|690x388](upload://wwCtXKKEb5MJcxCVGw0Jb0wbgfC.jpg)

![223403h|690x388](upload://p9o1V9jTixDh2gmnnjx3JBmBXk2.jpg)

The light is secured with 3m dual lock which is heavy duty but on my first night ride it popped off several times because of cracks in tarmac. This vibrations must be ultra heavy because I can't reproduce this behaviour at home shaking and beating it. 

Also I realized that when the light is that close to the ground it's more for other people seeing me. When I hold the same light in my hand I see much more.

Yesterday evening I used a "finger light" but that was a bad idea, not bright enough, had a painful crash!

It started so nice visiting a skate park with small pools/ wavy concrete paths for the first time. I had so much fun and also made many scratches on the Trampa tray but no problem at all. 

When it got dark the scooter and skateboard kidz left the park so I thought it would be funny to make some last higher speed rounds, what a stupid idea. What I totally forgot was the rail for sliding in the beginning of the concrete place. I was going full throttle for 1-2 seconds and then I hit the rail and the board sent me flying. There was nothing I could do, was landing with elbow, shoulder and back with overturning.

Destroyed the front truck and have graze on the back and graze and a nice wound on my arm near the elbow. My arm and shoulder hurt but I think (hope) it's not broken. What a nightmare.

I think of you as a pioneer with these type of boards. You think outside of the box and you are not afraid to just go and try shit out. Best part is that you keep the rest of us (like me) informed along your journey. 
Hope you mend well so that you can continue with your updates.

Thanks for your replies :grin:

Now after one week I feel better and can move my arm again (like 50%), it's not good but nothing broken. So I wanted to order a new front truck to be able to ride again in 1-2 weeks. I did some further inspections and discovered that I broke the un-breakable deck WTF! I thought my depression is over but it starts again :weary:

Hi @rich , running a 10Kg board at speed into an obstacle is hardly a case of warranty. 
We warrant that under normal use conditions the deck will not brake. E-Boards have plenty of mass, and hitting a rail, bringing the heavy board to a full stop within a fraction of a second, will ultimately cause damages. Im pretty sure that any other deck would have been in two parts. 
That's a proper crash you had! The amount of energy involved is very high. Drive your car against a wall at 20Km/h... It would be a lot shorter.

However, we don't want our customers to stand in the rain, so please contact Ted to find a solution for you. 
I hope you will feel better very soon! Take your time to cure the wounds. Heads up!

Frank

Dude, that should have been a no brainer. You were one of the people that led me to purchase a Trampa board and I am sure that I am not alone - the amount of sales they would have generated because of people like you would easily carry the cost of a replacement deck. The work you have done, particularly in this thread should be fully supported by people like @trampa. I'm glad they have acknowledged this by providing a replacement for you.

Just a suggestion, i don’t know the dimensions of those decks but you could maybe have loaded shape and use boosted style enclosure.

Third replacement deck in 17 Years. All replacements happened due to accidents and were covered showing good will. @rene hat the same crash (but without someone standing on the board) when a friend accidentality pushed the trigger forward after plugging in the board. It hit a post at full speed, which was a good thing considering that it could also have been some(one)thing else. 
No worries, we try our best to support our customers in case of a miserable situation. The most important thing is your health! Glad that only the deck snapped.

Strange feeling to disassemble the complete build after 20 days of riding

![095446h|690x388](upload://hQNhRk2dGxanOMkeIsxId7Ms07p.jpeg) 

But this way I could take this pictures where you see how I routed the wires.
Going through the baseplate is only possible with 14AWG wires and I also soldered the 4mm bullets afterwards. I used a big shrink tube as support in the middle and to secure the sharp edges of the holes.

![095244h|690x388](upload://8bqaBxlyNkf2Wtb0InMBKMFZjqz.jpeg) 


Due to the crash 2-3 paralell groups shifted a bit but thanks to flexible wires and 2mm neoprene foam in between nothing happened. The glue ist flexible but I can't move them back in position, the glue is just too strong. I have to think about how I could move it without damage or maybe I leave it like that, have to check it further :face_with_monocle:

The glue is very flexible and stays flexible, at least for the next 20 years :laughing:

It is also a bit shock absorbing for that reason and it's strong. I can shake everything upside down. I also use this stuff for sealing the slices but don't expect this as everlasting solution. With this glue you can glue metal on metal or glass on metal for example, some industry shit.

I've never read about someone using this butyl stuff but I found it when I ordered neoprene foam and different rubbers. I thought I give it a try. It sticks strong and is mouldable, no acid, flammable at 400° C, removable, niiiiice! Available in different sizes ordered in germany:

https://www.fugendichtband24.de/Butylband-2mm-x-10mm-grau-18m-Rolle.htm

It's hard to explain this material that's why I made some pics it looks like this.

![125845h|690x388](upload://9aqYWdtBUVZ4eUnxQGl7vrizUDE.jpeg) 

OK now I want to know the limit of this glue, maybe a Trampa truck (about 0.8kg)?

![133149h|690x388](upload://1PwquAFZIqvkIdjktTjUOAOoqhq.jpeg) 

Solid, let's try 2.5kg :rofl:

![133329h|690x388](upload://bH00x7FKxlNMM8sa0HosPKbZOnb.jpeg) 

For 1-2 seconds it was fine then it dropped, that was loud.
You see it's strong AF.

You remember this was just a small stripe. When you look at the picture of my previous post then you'll know why I can't move anything.

It's still a wonder that nothing more is damaged and I did not need a hospital. 
I hit the rail with the left front Gummie wheel, the Gummie or hub has no visible damage which is great but look at the truck. You can imagine how hard I hit it (the baseplate is aligned with the raster) :astonished:

![220731h|690x294](upload://o6FRbgQGglXxwpDZR3jmAjvVc8c.jpeg) 

Also the deck is cracked and not totally broken. I am thinking about sanding the area down and fix it with epoxy, that could work if the crack is not too deep. I would have enough Trampa spare parts to build an unpowered board e.g. for skate parks :rofl:

It's probably only the outer layer that cracked. You can mount the new trucks and jump around on the deck. It will not brake into two pieces. Cracks do not travel easily in this material. It's only down to 14 Play in that area. Try to brake it for us.  Lets see if you manage to do that. 
Glad the wheel survived. The Superstar is very very sturdy, since it can flex a bit. I haven't heard of a broken hub in the last 10 years. They seam to be pretty indestructible. However, inspect it thoroughly. 
It's always sad to see a bent truck. This impact shows that they don't snap, they just bend under the strain of the impact. Cold forged aircraft aluminium front to back.... Did the baseplate bend or the hanger? Looks like the hanger.

Just disassembled the truck, the kingpin is bent therefore the hanger looked more askew as it is. But the hanger is a bit twisted and one axle heavy bent. The baseplate looks quite OK.

Yeah the hubs and Gummies are bouncy, after the crash the board bounced back some meters.

@Silverline do you mean the mini hanger or normal size?

If you don't find a spare part, just shoot us a mail.
Sometimes we take parts from the website when there is a shortage in supply. This way they don't sell out until the next batch arrives, so that we can supply spares to those who need them and so that we have enough parts to sell complete boards. The truck take time to make...
Once they are re-stocked and available again, we will show them again.

The rebirth and first ride finally happened today :grin:

![223552|690x388](upload://tSuT5QQA0Uq9OqttdaGsLAabCAI.jpeg) 

Removed the yellow dampas, springs only in inner position feels like riding on 2 wheels, scary but funny, nothing for higher speed. Need more practice, maybe I put the dampas back, let's see.

![223833|690x388](upload://iNKb5ol2awEH1Z5ZV7ddXI7iTNP.jpeg) 

But back to the beginning.... First I've tried to repair the cracked deck with epoxy and wanted to use it until it's cold and then switch to the new deck.

Sanding down....

![20181005_140944|690x388](upload://hCpigo24zoP15GkvRogOH6rSc7I.jpeg) 

Epoxy...... 

![20181005_154456|690x388](upload://4qZGQm861hEqRwvKhogRsK51TiW.jpeg) ![20181005_154508|690x388](upload://jteeGgqn0DgYmN8mC6T0lGDvRGJ.jpeg) 

Sanding down epoxy (to get the gloss back finally with 1500 grit).... done

![20181007_000403|690x388](upload://9FXodoKhixenSph05XEwkVricUv.jpeg) 

Looked good and mounted the trucks with washers.
Then I started to jump on the deck until I heard some noises and the clear epoxy looked like that.

![20181007_105330|690x388](upload://bVsk14zVfhxsbnloTZjIDSwjszr.jpeg) 

When I touch "the crack" and jump I can feel movement there so I don't trust the deck 100%  but definitely gonna mount trucks and bindings to it for e.g. skate park fun.

Time to drill holes for the threaded inserts. Took the old deck as template.

![161451|690x388](upload://5mZwdkf2lIfl1rfKiZiKrl8lg4w.jpeg)

I put duct tape on the blablabla to get it centered within the threaded insert. What blablabla is? No idea what this is called in english even don't know it in german :rofl: center-punch? I don't know.

![161333|690x388](upload://fUBmehX1RHLOL8my5XO4yb6oWrX.jpeg) 

Drilling the holes...

![205728|690x388](upload://gRXPSyLYrkPTBiWWOlL18E7rmMe.jpeg) 

Trampa Dreadlocks

![210122|690x388](upload://19dR2WlFcYgbcOznRK2xue1dGmV.jpeg) 

This time I used a socket head hex bolt for installing the threaded inserts which worked much better and all inserts are straight

![132133|690x388](upload://8XGniD8JtDhUUfj2Z5akgEEBmzC.jpeg) 
 
![141110|690x388](upload://saNH86E1glNkwcztXyXWXkGAaRw.jpeg) 

It's best to lay the deck in a way down that the actual hole for the insert is straight and not askew.

![141032|690x388](upload://uuW0aBHTG2R6Sh0hITGFNvYxBqp.jpeg) 

When mounting the enclosure I realized that a couple of holes are not at the correct spot. I could mount all screws but damn, almost not possible. The better idea would be to take the enclosure as template and not the old deck for marking the holes but now it's too late. However it's working.

My actual problem is that a motor mount shifted again (angle) and I think I need to mount cross bars to prevent this. Right now I'm riding with a crooked because I want to ride, need to fix this asap.

Ah and finally I had time to get the pulleys anodized in black, no more bling bling.

I ate it real bad on a busy intersection along the beach front 2 days ago.  Thank goodness I had my knee pads, elbow pads and helmet on.  I bruised and maybe even cracked a rib but it could have been a lot worse.  
To add insult to injury every one at this intersection saw me go flying and I ended up in a patch of sand spurs.  I was there for a while pulling sand spurs from all kinds of locations on my body.
There is nothing fashionable about safety equipment BUT it really serves a necessary  purpose.  Be smart and ride safe.

I'm not sure but before riding one motor had some cogging and stuttering from standstill (like unsensored) and strange noises at low speed that's why I checked the sensor wire extensions but looked OK. The problems were gone for no reason and I decided to commute home. After a couple of minutes I made a turn on a bicycle path and suddenly one motor stuttered or blocked I don't know it was so quick and sent me flying. Landed with the hip first and then with elbows but my backpack saved my back.

Just checked my wrist guard gloves and prefer the cuts there instead of on my palms :pray: Can't upload pic now , gonna show you later.

 Well said :sunglasses:
Nothing beats the great feeling after a crash when you stand up with no injuries and keep on riding. A friend of mine wanted to try the board and I forced him to wear helmet, elbow- and kneepads and gloves. 

Sorry about your accident, hope it heals quick! Glad you were wearing all this protectors otherwise it would look different :pray:

On my Mountainboard I wear full body armor including crash pants so my hip wouldn't hurt now. Not too long time ago I didn't wear anything but I was just lucky. The fall(s) WILL come! 

At my local BMX track where I like to ride and jump it's always the same. People look at me and call me "ninja turtle" or "knight" or other funny things. For example once there were 10 kids with bicycles on the track, most of them had helmets but within 30 minutes all of them were falling (it's slippery gravel) and 8 of them had bloody knees or other wounds crying for their parents. Even a adult with helmet fell and had graze everywhere including face. In the end I was the only person left and had the whole course for me. Protectors for president!

I can slide on gravel or stones if necessary without hurting myself. But the problem with commuting is that I mostly don't wear all protectors, only half cap and gloves but I should be clever and add elbow and kneepads.

That's a good idea and they are slim. Did you ever had a fall wearing them? Because I've heard that the material hardens after an impact and stays hard afterwards. Within 20 rides I knocked my elbows 3 times on concrete so I need long lasting protectors :laughing:

I have serious problems with shifting motor mounts, I corrected the angles 2 times already and it keeps shifting. There are 2 holes on the motor mounts where I can add 1 or 2 rods to hopefully prevent this annoying problem.

The turning radius right now is ridiculous narrow at low speed and still feels not safe at mid speed. High speed is deadly, I have to shoot a video showing it, hard to describe.

Nope. I try to avoid falls generally. Still getting used to the board too. To date I haven’t had the footstraps engaged either. Still need to find time to go learn jumps and stopping with footstraps before I’ll use them.

I’ve had one light fall on my butt, cutting a corner and not taking into account the lesser traction on dirt. A quick laugh and on my way again. I’m an easy learner anyway, favour longer time over injury.

Yeah I mean heelstraps, they’re mounted too, but just flipped up out of the way for now.

Riding style sure, but I don’t go low speed, learned how to do that over rough pavement on my Evolve already. I do pretty close to max 36-40 on rough pavement actually.

Almost got reminded the hard way that it’s not such a good idea going high speed through the road gutters on a footpath crossing, when the board lost it’s composure and gone fishtailing on me. I just managed to ride it out though.

Hence the need to learn how to jump, and one of the reasons I built this board, to avoid pesky road gutters and potentially jump up sidewalks and over other pesky slowy-downy things.

For street riding and commuting I would prefer footstraps only in your case. On my MTB I didn't use the heelstraps for a long time because they scared me. This year I started to use and love them and can't ride without anymore. It's a must for jumping IMO and feels much safer in offroad conditions. When I fall I know that I won't have one knee turned on the wrong side because one foot left the binding. That was always my biggest fear.

I would not jump up sidewalks without heelstraps, too dangerous.

As we talk about bindings, I decided to use no bindings on the Urban Burro. I have Freebord and Trampa bindings and originally wanted to mount one of them but for commuting and keeping it small and simple I prefer to keep them in the box. Also I can bail and the board can send me flying, it's more a street build.

My season is over :disappointed_relieved:

This board tries to kill me, the stuttering motor is back. I have very strange behavior of the whole system. One motor sound bad, sometimes it's not spinning and then the other spins slow no matter how much throttle. One motor makes loud noises, it's like blocked and then releases but only weighted not on the bench. 

And then the problem disappears for some kilometers and comes back while riding and send you flying. I'm still limping because my hip hurts from knocking on concrete. WTF!

I made a video showing the problems but no motivation to edit it yet, coming soon...

OK in my depression I thought it's a good time to mount the ATB trucks on the cracked deck. When it came to the point to mount the springs the confusion started. What the hell is going on here?  :thinking:

I'm using dual esk8 1.1 controller

@Silverline I don't get faults but also could reproduce the weird behavior once only. Tried it for 10 minutes at home but it's running like a charm. 

Did you check if your caps are still connected to your PCB and are they secured with silicone?

Once I had the problem that suddenly one motor was no more spinning and the other made clicking noises. Then it was spinning again but just for a short time. In the end it was a loose solder joint of one phase wire connector, I didn't see it because the loose cable was still inside the shrink tube.

Meanwhile I mounted the ATB trucks on the cracked deck with 7" wheels for direct comparison of both versions. Well with almost no pre-load on the springs this happened on hard lean.

After adding more pre-tension (bolt flush with deck) it didn't happen again.

The difference in size is huge

It depends on the flex. With 14ply deck yes but it's really flexy so higher ply decks would not be parallel. I have to check it on my 16ply Holypro as well, it's not that flexible compared to 14ply.

So 16ply seems right. For me with 74kg the 14ply is a bit more flexy than the 16ply for you but not too much. I took this for reference:

![Flexometer_Carve|690x261](upload://gUixJf10IwaSedZvcU5CEdilsxB.png) 

Maybe the 15ply would feel the same as the 14ply for me but it is really bouncy and not for high speed. The flex scared me in the beginning and it looked as if I was drunk, you need some balance. The 15ply would be also alright for me, just a bit stiffer.

You are right, I never thought about the added weight plus backpack, that's why it's so flexy :laughing:
Also according to this chart of the HolyPro the flex of a 16ply deck should be similar to 14ply Carver deck for me but the carver is much more flexible.

I don't think so because then it would be always, furthermore there is zero resistance. I had motors which had internal shorts and they had resistance and got sizzling hot within minutes.

The problem right now is that I can't reproduce this behavior. I tried to move the cables at the motor and on controller side to see if there is a problem but it's still running smooth

The gentle strange noise when spinning could be bearings.

That is my only hope.
 I had this as well last year, one solder joint of a bullet fell of. And another time my 2 wheels were spinning in opposite direction because a sensor extension broke.

All my phase wire connectors look fine. The sensor extensions are almost fine, should solder new ones anyway to see if it makes a difference. My fear is that the problem is on the short wires of the controllers. The solder stiffened the cables but some of them are no more stiff but on the other hand it makes no diffference if I move them (during spinning motor) so I'm not sure if this is the problem.

unplug the motor phase wires and try turning by hand. it should turn easily and doesn't feel like having much resistance. If there is some resistance, means that there is a short in the phase wires.

if the motor turns without the resistance, probably there is something wrong on the VESC. check the phase wires of the vesc and then also check the wires that is soldered on the VESC PCB. if those looks fine, it might be something wrong

i would start trouble shooting with run a new motor detection and
searching for weak solder joins, maybe have a look at the phase wires on the place where they come out of the motor.
The place where the bendet or the connection from motor windings to flex cable.
maybe the wires internal broken, what could cause that issue too i think.
Did you already open the motor and had a look if everything fine inside?

Now I understand, with the street carver setup the hangers are 180° flipped and 7" wheels would not fit (wheel bite). For Gummies or 7" wheels the hangers are rotated in normal position. The street carver mount works only in one direction so I'm afraid you can't switch to 7" wheels with this mount :pensive:

Exactly, just the hanger. By turning the hanger the axle sits more far away from the deck and higher from the ground. In this position longboard wheels don't work because of too less ground clearance.

I know ;) I like air tyres so I will use them. After the fixed thread, I will order that drive trail form you when my hanger is fixed 

@rich 
It sucks very much... 
I have already frozen my hanger with shaft and then heated the hanger with a gas burner, in the meantime I tried to knock the shaft out. This did not work. So now I am waiting on @trampa answer. How is it possible that such a expensive truck have problems :hushed:

If the tread is fucked, you need a new hanger. No way yo can pull the pin. Also axle pins are not available separately.

Actually they don't sell mini hangers, only ATB hangers.
The hanger would cost about £50, I would just order a complete truck for £75, then you have a spare baseplate, kingpin, springs, retainers, dampas, bushings, axle nuts and screws :grin:

Since days I can't reproduce the stuttering of one motor so troubleshooting is very difficult. The cables and connectors outside should be fine so I started to inspect the motor.

Big city dust on bearings
![170449|690x388](upload://dcgjC0g03Iol3OItvOMN2JqRILP.jpeg) 

At least I found the reason why the bad motor makes clicking sounds. The shaft has radial play, when I pull or push there is no play or movement (circlip is fine) but sideways click click click. No idea if this could be the reason for the stuttering problem, too. Not sure what to do now, tsssss..... next step is opening the motor. Unfortunately I have no warranty because I bought this (new) motors last year from a forum member.



There is one thing I would do different if I would build it again. It was not the best idea to place the controller so close to the end of the enclosure (2mm). There was no more space but it's bad for the solder joints on both sides and it would be better if the wires would leave the enclosure at the bottom of the deck like the sensor wires. Then nothing could happen if you e.g. lift or grab the board there accidentally.

Opened the motor, looks like some rusty grease left the bearings

That's not my hair :laughing:
![131623e|690x388](upload://7srF7bLEvvSTIBkxDeImictBwbO.jpeg) 

What a tiny stator compared to 6374
![131552|690x388](upload://pzgvHCINxpIAAtRdXuKSw9fnsVw.jpeg) 

Ok now I know I should change the bearings but don't think it has something to do with the stuttering, weird.

Finally I uploaded the video on Youtube where I test the 18W/12V lights from [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1Pcs-2Pcs-18w-DRL-LED-Spot-Flood-Work-Light-Worklight-9-32V-4WD-12-volt-led/32835112621.html). The spot version is better (I have both).

![203018|690x388](upload://vGzEvC5qrQUo4aOIkTOiRPEU7au.jpeg) 

But when mounted on the board the visibility is quite poor

Not yet but the SK8 motor sounds worse after some rides, I try to claim it first, posted a new video [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/dirt-machine-trampa-holypro-16-ply-vertigo-trucks-superstar-hubs-unik-polaris-6374-150kv-e-toxx-black-direct-drive-vesc-6-12s/45377/587?u=rich). I want to ride, I had so many breaks this year, I'm tired of building right now. 

The urban burro is out of order since over 2 weeks, I had 1-2 rides since my crash on Sept 18, that's not much riding for a commuter. I could switch to 6374 motors but then I would have to use the ATB hangers.

Yes I have 2x 6374 Unik motors but they are longer than 74mm with the nipple that's why I can't use them with mini hanger. I like the inner spring position and size of the mini trucks for commuting. But if I can't solve the APS problem I'll switch to 6374 and ATB hangers for now.

Finally I found the real root for the stuttering motor, after slightly pulling I had this in my hand :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

![214525|690x388](upload://52PIZ0OxGE2sZXes7Umc7ARQPjo.jpeg) 

Fortunately I could remove the sugru and the front plate so it should be easier but still tricky to lift the glued controllers. Originally I planned to heat shrink the controllers but unfortunately I didn't.

My plan is to change all cables of the controllers to 14AWG and solder the connectors more far away, that was too close and I knew this will happen one day. Have to order wires.

The APS motor has still the rattling shaft/can but it's not the reason for stuttering. Anyway I'm thinking about switching to my Unik 6374 150kv motors from @okp. It looks like they could fit :grin: 

![222006|690x388](upload://90dIltCiwaUPIugyReDN3Vq6qZf.jpeg)

My guess is this, when you soldered the bullets the wire got hot and pulled out a little from the pcb, weakening the joint that subsequently broke

Could be plus vibrations. 
I have another suspicion because the day before I let a friend ride and he lifted the board. Otherwise on the next day  I was riding to work without problems. At work I let 2 people try and they also lifted it. If they had one hand at the sturdy cables/bullets during lifting it could be the reason why the outer bullet almost broke and the stuttering motor sent me flying 5 minutes later. My cable managment was not idiot proof and I have to redo it better.

![120444|690x388](upload://m1l6ezOYV6ZOmr1GHcIwnhKLbBj.jpeg) 

Damn is this normal that I can lift the PCB? I thought this should stick better but I have zero experience with thermally conductive paste. It's still soft.

Small update, was lazy because it's cold and did not much the last weeks :laughing:

There are several issues to solve. I realized that I have to machine/file the motor mounts if I use the Unik motors because there is a sharp edge on the mount where the wires exit the motor, it doesn't fit. On the APS motors I could re-arrange the wires to make it fit but that's not possible with the Unik motors, cables are on bottom.

![011001h|690x388](upload://xjIOHMBQOjWTdCxM0OUkgebUHXl.jpeg) 




Also I still need a crossbar.... and I regret that I used long cables from motor to vesc through the baseplate. It's a nightmare to swap motors, I never thought about that.

These 1.5mm bushings are my enemies, they are too big inside and outside, both hangers have play and rattle really bad. Bushings with 2mm base are too thick so I need to file them down until they fit to get rid of the play.

But enough about problems I made some progress, too :grin: I've never liked the griptape design but I had to cover all the holes of the inserts, so function over design.

Time to change that and fill the holes with black silicone but first need to cover the inserts otherwise silicone would enter the thread. Just by accident I found out that my office hole puncher is exactly the size of my drilled holes so I used masking tape.

![020453h|690x388](upload://3FYH1v4LAtHgZvEHLSq27zus5PC.jpeg) 

On the right hole you can see the uncovered threaded insert.

![020600h|690x388](upload://vqw1JkRJOcyCYJZibhqFZaJEhay.jpeg) 

All holes covered with punched masking tape

![031909h|690x388](upload://tfO9nghvQjRKFKaeCHc9o4VrKNx.jpeg) 

Could I mask it better? Sick!

![035943h|690x388](upload://zabiV7crvVWnMvrSVQWPp5TS7zO.jpeg)

One side done, what a difference...

![040914h|690x388](upload://mKP77ypa29NFixb3Bjz2zM0JM88.jpeg)

I made a A4 template (300dpi) which can be printed and glued to the backside of the grip tape for cutting. The width of a hexagon is 6cm which I like most. Feel free to use it.

I have some stress to make the board ready 2 ride again, spring is coming... I can't believe it's 5 months ago since my last ride (and fall). So here a small update what I changed.

Small things with huge effect, custom sanded bushings on hangers :sunglasses:

![144733h|690x388](upload://4TALSgrrazfECUmhc4yj18B9Fr7.jpeg) 

I have all available bushings (from 1.5mm to 3mm) but sometimes the perfect fit is in between. Furthermore the inner and outer diameter differs a bit from bushing to bushing. The 1.5mm bushings are so big inside that the kingpin has play and the hanger rattles. And they are so big outside that it's really hard to insert/remove them. It helps to sand them outside but inside it's still too big. On my rear hanger I had 2x 1.5mm bushings and the hanger had massive play including bad noises. I sanded down 2mm bushings (with perfect inner fitting) to 1.6mm and wow, perfect truck, no movement at all. What a difference!

Next big thing was to stop the motor mounts from shifting. I made 2 crossbars out of an aluminium rod and cut threads. Sounds easy but without a lathe quite demanding to drill proper centered straight holes. I made a construction to drill it almost straight. Also centered worked on rod no. 3 and 4 :laughing:

![190409h|690x388](upload://soxqrW392p4xX7TEzSw6HqZdgou.jpeg) 

Zing!! Damn while cutting the thread cutter broke.

![092409h|690x388](upload://sPRWbAZ4IjbDLUtmEpQ7XKdHN02.jpeg) 

Fortunately I had a spare one (but had to make a new bar) and also made a construction which holds the thread cutter centered all the time for better cutting. It worked but this 2 ridicolous crossbars took me a whole day :smirk:. Finished with black foil.

![193120h|690x388](upload://a7TFNDu72QDmnQCSX89MmCwNaDf.jpeg) 

![193152h|690x388](upload://d15EuKZr7WlFfC1Ck0TgjEwB0gX.jpeg) 

Today I bought clear griptape and gave it a try..... I'm not sure if I like it. Also you see the former invisible holes. I'm waiting for daylight tomorrow if it looks better but maybe I remove it.

![192953h|690x388](upload://dbYGj8HETfiWNj2rSkCakCmI81Q.jpeg) 

But funny that the color is very similar to sanded edge of the Trampa deck, not bad.

![193349h|690x388](upload://xSC1Vw5hnvaiNOELXOiCZxBFgex.jpeg) 

Last thing to do is to fix this thing

![203803h|690x388](upload://xSVutwfCh3mxt9STcsWPFWFzB78.jpeg) 

Best would be to change all 6 phase wires and solder them in an different angle to the PCB (towards the deck) plus change all connectors on the other side. But lazy as I am it could be that I just solder the wire back :laughing: I have not decided yet.

My plan was to secure the capacitors to the PCB with silicone for electronics. The problem is that the angle of the white cap is a bit askew and gets pressed down a bit when installing the upper lid, it's very tight. 

![202215eh2|690x352](upload://t9dFlf1Tt7040BCnB9NCNm1Nzp9.jpeg) 

Therefore I would have to add silicone and instantly bolt on the upper lid. I don't know if it's good when the silicone cures in an almost closed enclosure with electronic parts, that's the question.

They are esk8 1.1 controller from germany, upgraded HW4.12 with direct FETs (not sealed).
Finally I glued the capacitors to the PCB with silicone, should be safer now.

![161438h|690x388](upload://cELCavP87F55RXlhwD3FclcqVaF.jpeg) 

For applying I use syringes with DIY nozzles made of shrink tube. The great thing is that any length, small diameter or shape is possible.

![153819h|690x388](upload://oamFwv1VVmQPjDnEjgYUDH8iDPn.jpeg) 

Needed to glue the end parts to the tray again, it didn&rsquo;t hold. This time I used sikaflex (PU) and it bonds AF and is flexible, thanks for the hint @Andy87.

After reading the &ldquo;fuse on charge port&rdquo; posts of @b264  in various topics for weeks I&rsquo;m kinda brainwashed and needed to do it. Bought 7.5A mini fuses, cut the length of the tabs and rounded the corners before soldering.

![132528h|690x388](upload://dQ8CFOjSxQhOcDN32vo9pVo4Bzr.jpeg) 

![135752h|690x388](upload://repDMVRlXd1kmVGMZueqNh0j7f0.jpeg) 

Several layers of kapton tape for insulation and the BMS has clear shrink tube, too. 

![154318h|690x388](upload://hYO1IremRXZPlDsyt2Z5BSa7Gfb.jpeg) 

Feels better with a 7.5A fuse instead of the 120A protection of the BMS only. I'm charging with 3A, maybe upgrade to 4-5A later but think (hope) the fuse won't get warm when charging.

Glued the controllers back into the tray but this time with less butyl tape, it was way too much last time.

![202550h|690x388](upload://d8DIDHFmeMImO6bNlMSwjRdcAFJ.jpeg) 

I sealed the holes quick and dirty and glued 2 painted wood blocks below the bullet connectors. This way they can't bend down and break the solder joint on the PCB like last year which sent me flying.

![151850h|690x388](upload://nMs04j8RMO6BbPkGjt0gUb8G3M.jpeg) 

![154048h|690x388](upload://ghNgTooYK2nCjM2Ah760cTD6Gm3.jpeg) 

I have already a better solution which secures the bullets from both sides, grab protection plus protection against movement but I wanted to ride today so next time.

I'm scared of the threads on the axles so I found this solution for now.

![134313h|690x388](upload://yo7KQg1XUta32meWo9ZOHRplfQL.jpeg) 

Board was fully charged so it was time for my first ride after 5 months

In the beginning it was very shaky because I am more used to the MTB but after a short while it got better. After adding more pre-tension on the springs (with yellow dampas) I could ride "faster". The funny thing is the difference between MTB and Carver, they feel completely different. My top speed of today was 31km/h (19mph) :joy:, didn't want to ride faster (too scared) but with the MTB I have no problem up to 50km/h (31mph). There is a reason why it's called carver.

My ride was 21km (13miles) between 4.2V and  3.5V per cell (10s 10.4Ah). Should be more range, guess it's the outside temperature (14°C).

But damn my commuter is back and ready 2 ride, yessss :grin:

Just don’t destroy anything again ok? 😄

Glass fuses are great to use as charge port fusing, no space used at all, just a shrink tube covering all of it

Made some improvement to secure the bullets/wires.

Shopping is much more fun combined with a ride :sunglasses:

![172349h|690x388](upload://6C6GpQS4UiMm32tl9UGXAtTDvYw.jpeg) 

But finally it was time to mount the 7" evolve tires because I've never tried them, only Gummies so far. 50% done :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

![133509h|690x388](upload://4iob4FIkWSDt166Dw9Dm7Ijkedl.jpeg) 

Now the most tricky part, the alignment of the pulleys, I really hate it. Of course I disassembled all hubs before and combined the "best" parts to get 2 almost true hubs (in theory). There is wobble sideways (red tape) and up and down (yellow tape) which is a real pain.

![202828h|690x388](upload://fvGPJ8XuiCCL6noQfrhz8D2ebMt.jpeg) 

Only thing against up and down movement which helps is to enlarge the holes to correct it.

![142953h|690x388](upload://7Vx4Jvnsitw3lCHrbq1TWnKgzta.jpeg) 

For the wobble sideways I tried different combinations of shims between 0.05 and 0.3mm.

![203428h|690x388](upload://jm2Yrcl3DMLSpYQHE0ytOEdW5iw.jpeg) 

Quite a while later the first pulley was done and secured with blue Loctite.

When I tried to mount the second aluminium pulley I recognized a difference, it didn't really fit despite the correct position of the spacer nuts (like in the pic above). I realized the edge is too curvy and there is too less space for the nuts.

![120256he|690x388](upload://5BWWsoWivFvRTZ8iESbZe5wtXXu.jpeg) 

Time to mill with the dremel.

![124044h|690x388](upload://l6VCHOLKsDieI6qDI4snXvkTnvC.jpeg) 

Not really beatiful but it worked.

![131353h|690x388](upload://Ahp9af49uONQTvAq0JrGSjNeRJT.jpeg) 

It's done. Marked the screws with white tape and which washers I've used for future reference.

![222342h|690x388](upload://bftLxFZGNfOQDOtteqo1b0Uo1EC.jpeg) 

Which belt length was it? :thinking: Ah 365mm...

![140742h|690x388](upload://l230MygvTlvTxB3rz0BJj70fuzY.jpeg) 

It was the maiden ride with pneumatics on this board and I was so curious....

![180603h|690x388](upload://lb0qpimt9wYYyBaxa25eGOb29CI.jpeg) 

Funny how the motors almost disappear.

![180435h|690x388](upload://qifsmSYjssJvdLCScB1z9Smi2Y6.jpeg)

First of all the ride feels more stable compared to Gummies and obviously much smoother and silent. The grip on concrete is very good and riding on different terrains is genius but obstacles without bindings tricky. 

Compared to my 8" MTB tires the evolve tires (50psi) feel quite rough on gravel. I'm not sure if it's the stiff rubber or the street profile or both. Good thing is that I can switch from 7" to Gummies wwithin 5 minutes.


The range with pneumatics is about 20km compared to 30km with Gummies (10s 10.4 Ah).

how about the pulleys, I think you have 44th for the gummies and for the pneumatics something like 60th? or so? I mean even if you use different belt length you will need to adjust the belt tension a bit by moving the motors, which would result in applying new loctite on the motor mount screws, whiiiich again would result in 24h waiting till the loctite gets dry.
Is this the case or does both belts sit perfect at the same motor position?

Yes 15T/44T/60T with 130kv motors. Now I understand what you mean with Loctite :laughing: I don't use Loctite for the motor screws, just 12.9 socket head and nothing moves (despite 3 bolts only). I have to untighten the belts to remove the wheels and tighten them again but it's still 7 minutes only :joy:


The motors look good and fit the the dark color scheme of the board but I don't really like these APS motors, they are loud as hell in FOC and scream like I would stab them. 

[quote="Ghost1068, post:198, topic:66503"]

[/quote]

Hard to say, today I had my second ride with 7" so I need more experience but it's definitely more comfortable and stable. Best thing is rolling over cracks or big cobble stones or wherever you want to ride. The biggest difference for me is the ability to ride bigger curbs which means less carrying around and faster     commuting which is great. 

I still like the look with Gummies more....

The next days I'll ride to work and can experience the difference to Gummies on the same track. With public transport I takes 1 hour to get to work, with esk8 only 30 minutes :sunglasses:

[quote="Ghost1068, post:198, topic:66503"]

It's the Trampa Tray which you have to slice (not funny) to make it flexible. I would do it different now but it's too late.

Just arrived home after a 45km ride. I charged the board there for the way back and forgot that this was not a good idea because it starts with heavy downhill. I experienced the first time the worst case, losing the brakes. I was riding on a steep street and couldn't brake anymore :open_mouth: I had to bail and luckily I was just barely slow enough to run and somehow stop the board with one foot. That was a very close call. 

Now I know how it feels when the BMS cuts off because of overcharge. After that I wanted to continue riding but the brake was not working, only throttle. Unweighted it worked, scary. When the terrain got flat I started riding again and the brakes started to work after some time.

I realized 6x OVER VOLTAGE faults for the first time. I hope it has something to do with the battery problem in the beginning of the ride and is nothing else :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

It's time for some feedback...

It's about a month ago since I've mounted the 7" tires and I got so used to it that I don't think about riding Gummies anymore. 
I never scraped with the underboard tray and the comfort with pneumatics is much better and I can ride almost all curbs and terrains without problems. 
I like the AT setup more than thane in all aspects except the look and decreased range. I don't use tire sealant but had zero flats which is great. Also there is enough rubber left after over 350km (218 miles), curious how long they last.

The 10s4p is barely enough for pneumatics, wish I had 7p and more range but wanted to have the slim look so I have no choice, original first world problems.


I had a crazy ride on some new cycle paths, some cyclists thought they can race with me until I said goodbye.
I also passed a walking police officer at full speed, his face with open mouth was so funny because he couldn't do anything. 
Damn, I love this esk8 life.

I regret that I didn't put a voltmeter somewhere because the app from Ackmaniac doesn't work all the time, could be my phone no idea but it sucks. It is working for weeks then not and after some weeks again or 1 day yes and the next day not :thinking: Also GPS never worked in the app. 

Had a nice ride in the countryside, friendly people there. An excited cyclist wanted to make high five and almost knocked me off the board :laughing:

Tires are inflated to 50psi. The range with pneumatics is about 33% less compared to gummies.

I haven't tried any other tires than Evolve on this build yet. I have 6x 7" Innova tires, too but I guess they wear down faster and furthermore the wheelchair style doesn't please my eyes. On the mini trucks I can't mount 8" tires so the only third option are the Trampa urban treads. I'm stuck :laughing:

I would say it depends on the definition of "off-road". This build with enclosure underneath the deck is perfect for street and all terrain and I enjoy riding without bindings wherever I want.

Real off-road need bindings otherwise you fly off the board all the time (except riding like a granny) and with top mounted enclosure you can ride or slide everywhere without any worries. This is exactly the reason why I love my MTB, really nothing can stop you except maybe sand or very loose dirt. I'm glad to have both boards because they are different. This Carver build is my commuter, the MTB is for ultimate fun.
