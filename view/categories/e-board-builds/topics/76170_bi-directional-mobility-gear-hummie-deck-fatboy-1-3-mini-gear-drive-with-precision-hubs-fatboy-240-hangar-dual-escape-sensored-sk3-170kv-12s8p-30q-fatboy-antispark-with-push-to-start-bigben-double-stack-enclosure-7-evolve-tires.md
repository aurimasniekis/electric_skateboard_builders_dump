Second build!

Actually this wasn't supposed to be a second build. I kept buying parts as improvements for my first build:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/future-gadget-204-2nd-edition-ver-2-34-trampa-mtb-fatboy-direct-drive-5-1-eboosted-double-stack-trampa-enlosure-fatboy-focbox-enclosure-dual-focbox-sk8-192kv-motors-12s7p-30q/58493/48

but ehh, I gathered enough parts for a new build, might as well gut my old one, turn it into a proper top mounted off-roading board, and make an entirely new street pneumatic long range build.

Parts list:

**Drivetrain**
Fatboy Mini 1:3 Pneumatic gear drive for torqueboard trucks by @3DServisas/@Kug3lis  
Fatboy CNC precision Solid Core Hubs
7" Evolve tires
Caliber Trucks (only need the baseplate, really)
Sensored Turnigy Sk3 170kv (from group buy) running FOC

**Board**
Hummie Deck by @Hummie
Double Stack enclosure by @bigben  

**Electronics**
Dual Escape by @stewii
Fatboy Anti-Spark switch with push to start
Charge only micro-bms from ebay
12s8p battery pack by @neiru37 (my old build)

**Build features**
Double drop
My signature custom grip tape job
Cutout on the enclosure to expose the escape heatsink for better cooling
No power button (charge port would be the only thing exposed)

Lastly, yes the name of my build is once again an anime reference. If you watch Attack on Titan, you might have heard of the **Omni-Directional Mobility Gear**.

Well since I can't move vertically with this thing, it's only a **Bi-Directional Mobility Gear**.

None so far, I'm still enjoying an out of the country vacation for the holidays. But thanks for the interest, will probably have some updates in 3-4 weeks. I'm still waiting on the new batch of hummie decks so there's also that.

I expect this to play the first opening theme song upon starting up and if for any reasons thereâ€™s any faults or disconnections , the betrayal theme from that betrayal scene.
