I'm still ordering parts for the next month or so but this is what I have to work with.

Do you really notice that much of a difference? I just finished picking up another long board and I tried some shorter boards like that and didn't really notice a difference, it was only the longer boards I found made a big difference.

As a fellow canadian though I definitely will be following this!

This is the first long one i've had and i find it's really awesome for going fast, putting both hands behind you, and dropping the back knee. Other than that I absolutely love short boards i find that around 30" is the sweet spot.

Yeah see I am the opposite, My first board I bought ten years ago and it was a drop deck and ever since than the short stuff just seems too high up. Oh and I love going fast!!

Unfortunately I don't see much electric skateboards in Canada at all. I'm in the GTA in Ontario. Bought a dual rocket from torque boards. probably going to gut the thing at some point and put everything on a different deck. Do you know of any groups or anything in Canada? I'd love to see somebody zoom by on an eskate. or maybe even this one?

Northlake just did some quick Kijiji search and saw your board on there, what's going on?

delduked I live in Caledon and work in Toronto, I only have a long board now but hoping to build an eskate soon enough!

Do you pay a lot of duty fees when you order your DIY parts? I haven't got my Torqueboards Dual Rocket yet. Where do you get your parts from?

I order them all separately so there's no duty. I just acquire parts from the usa that are cool and then charge a premium because they aren't native to canada. :slight_smile:

Hey guys! Update time!

I have now added a motor mount courtesy of @korryh, a motor courtesy of @JLabs, and a 15mm pulley setup with a 265 belt from @johnny_261 :smile: SUPER EXCITED

Looks good man!  I've used motor mounts from @korryh as well.  They are great, but would just recommend that you change the bolts on the clamp from allen bolts to regular ones.  I found even with threadlocker that the allen head bolts would work themselves loose after a while.  With regular bolts, I could get a lot more torque on them and they stayed put a lot better. Good luck with your build.

@Kaden56 add me an ABS enclosure specifically for this board. Maybe you can talk him into pulling one off the mold for you.
