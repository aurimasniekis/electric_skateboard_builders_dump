Hello, I put you here my build log of my board "Elephant aka Eph". The board, the case and the trucks come from a evolve Bamboo GT. The battery is a 10S4p, with two 6355 maytech engines, motor mount Unikboards and two focbox :slight_smile:

Looks nice so far. What 13-pin connector is that? I've been looking for one for my balancing system for **AGES** and I JUST found (a different) one, which I have to wait for it to come from China... So typical that when I order something, other options that I have been looking for everywhere, starts popping up!!! :joy:

It's a 13 pin DIN, you can find them on ebay (usually use for ATARI video cable).
I use it for charging and balancing, as i use an external BMS.
But it's a pain in the A.. to sold.:sweat_smile:

I think it's an elephant not a crane. Turn your head to the left when looking at the picture. You'll see what I mean.

@Toleg I love this build. It's stunning. Congratulations :slight_smile:

Don't worry, the picture where you're looking from front to back threw me off as well. I was like.. "it's called an elephant board. why put a crane on it? :confused:

I don't have the total budget, but should be the same price as a bamboo GT .... or less :)

Very nice setup mate! I am busy with a similar build right now. May i ask which motor pulleys you are using (are those from APS?)  ? Because it seems most pulleys touch the wheel when in AT mode. I just ordered motor pulleys without overhang to make sure it will fit the AT setup but when looking at your pics it seems that there is enough clearance eventhough you've used pulleys with overhang...And what belt size do you use?
```

Hi,
I uses 15 mm pulley, from unikboards, but should be the same as APS.
