So this board has been in my life for a number of years. I recently discovered the community here and instantly wanted to carve up some canyon roads here in the great state of South Dakota. @thervn hooked me up with some stellar parts. I'll tell you what I'm in love. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/7/c74b474047b43fc7c458b2f0803680fa50d1ba9f.jpg" width="374" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/9/f93605420bb1ef11df4318a5e5870e7e27e3a900.jpg" width="374" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/7/67c8a5fb1da0679f806185ba6d92dac7563ae6ca.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/d/3d2ea0dd123308b4b8a0c79322909af3793219ff.jpg" width="666" height="500">

The famous Cindrich Billet Aluminum Longboard. My favorite was always the Silverfish. But David Cindrich is not always available. Too busy to produce boards in a daily basis, just a few now and then. For a time I was considering buying one of his decks but seen that he wasn't producing anything lately, decided to go elsewhere to get my deck. Plus he decided long ago not to produce the Silverfish anymore. So I wasn't interested in the other models neither.

I got very lucky with grabbing it. It's a blemish board I really loved his baseplate design. I talked to him recently and he said that he would produce a them if I wanted to get some.

This is amazing. Always wanted to have a Cindrich board but wasn't sure about the weight and how stiff it will be.Also like the Thorlabs casing :slight_smile:

Stiff. Like your feet hurt if you use it to cruise for awhile until you get used to it. Downhill I wouldn't choose any other board, because its so freakin stable at speed.

So I have an update to the race board as of these last few weeks I was able to aquire a 30q 12s4p battery made by @ZackoryCramer Thanks dude. 
I am still in limbo with enertion and wating for some of the 97mm wheels and one focbox since something got lost in communication when I asked santa oh well might just see how nice @JLabs 97mm's are. is means with this I can start building my enclosure! Yay! 
This also comes in the wake of me frying my vesc's a few months back and generally not caring because its cold and wet and the dirtbike needed a tear down anyway. 
So @JohnnyMeduse has his masterful hands on them and hopefully be sending them back soon enough.

My wonderful girlfriend helping with the bms wires. Shes pretty great. also puts up with our office being a garage for my long board.

Got you guys that.

Mostly finished, I still have to do my XT90 anti spark on the positive lead and heat shrink it. Probably halfway doneish. 

I have fully intended to cover the bottom of this board with two different sheets of petg to create a clear enclosure for it. I don't want to lose what Cindrich has done with the CNC and it has some board rash that I have loved and want to be able to look through the board and still use some of the holes as grips.
I have access to a 4ftx4ft oven that my friend does powder coating in so size of the sheets doesn't matter so much. this will also help when I use the board itself as a vacuum buck for the first sheet and I'll end up making a second buck for the second sheet of petg. 
Now the best part of this whole project is while I'm itching to ride it its balls cold in SoDak. 
I also have a motorcycle torn apart in my shed while I wait for the same friend to powder coat my frame and just about everything else that I could unbolt.

I had great “flywheel like” reviews on the 90mm’s so I can’t wait to hear from you guys what the additional 7mm does :blush:

Yes 100% and I have the customer reviews to back it up. They are the best “clones” you can get that are not genuine ABEC’s

Would you by any chance be able to do a durometer test on them? I don't trust China urethane durometer ratings

So here's the update. I decided to go with dual diagonal. Because why not I had enough wire and I couldn't get both motors on the rear. I don't know why but eh 
This thing is a bullet. Holy praise skatan. 
Need longer belts though I noticed that on very steep inlines that my pull makes contact with my wheel so that needs to be fixed immediately. 
Now I'll make an enclosure and some wire extensions for one of the vescs.

Also really considering a different board for this whole ordeal for ease of buying a pre-made enclosure. @psychotiller any thoughts for a stiff drop. I thought about one of @Hummie  boards. Or a moonlight, there's also the old Evo for length. What I'm really wanting is a Gravity Hypercarve just for a nice surfy experience

I have to say I'm liking the hummie deck and how the enclosure fits...Red Ember can make some pretty nice stiff drops too!

After riding the Cindrich over 20 for a few miles I realized that it is just not a thing that needs power. It's also a heavy bastard. 
If I can get one of hummies decks I'll be coming to you for a beautiful black thing. I really do like the Caldera that @treenutter makes. Its a thing of beauty, I believe that your enclosure for that is the most elegant setup. Until i come up with enough dough to hand you two my money I think I'll do the really really janky thing with the zip ties. 

I'm just shuddering with the thought of one of those breaking.

Cindrich too heavy for Esk8 in your opinion? How much the deck weights alone?

The weight was not that much of an issue. I know it was almost 25 pounds with everything attached but the cindrich weighs about 12 with just the board and hardware. The hardest part for me was trying to engineer a enclosure for it that so that I didn't have to drill into the board itself. I'm weird like that but it seemed like sacrilege to drill into something that they worked so hard to make. For the whole project I really wouldn't choose a different board. It was so stable at speed and even with the weight tax I probably wouldn't have chose a different board. I think if someone had the time and cindrich was still doing custom work then it would be a great platform for an integrated deck design.

I always liked the Sillverfish.

I had talked with him before about the other board in the picture. All said and done I think it would have been around 900 or so. I always wanted a screamer![1_730330ef71f23a1c146d848a121c7faa|400x300](upload://qY9TT3gi0rTnOnRZvDIt9Uesuce.jpeg)

What do you know about him saying he will only do a couple models from now on? That he no longer produces boards like the Silverfish. Is that true or I misunderstood what he said? One could always talk to him and ask for a custom job, no?

As far as I know he's really only making the race board which is my board. Although if someone were to ask I bet he would still make a silverfish.
