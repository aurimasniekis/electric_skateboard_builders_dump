I purchased a blue motor mount from ebay that came from diy electric skateboards.com and i'm having a major issue with it. Apparently the truck clamp doesnt tighten all the way to stay on the truck. I tightned it as much as I could and it stays loose and wiggley. I think these motor mounts only fit Caliber one trucks. Is there something that I can use as a spacer? I really don't want to weld it. PLEASE HELP.

if you look closely, you can probably see the gap between truck and truck clamp.

@Tampaesk8er use a thin metal shim to fill the gap.

I tried that already, cant find anything thin enough to slide in there, the pic is enlarged so people can see it. I was thinking a piece of heat shrink heated up till it gets thin, i'm willing to try anything at this pointe. FRUSTRATED!

look like the clamp screw is not tight enough... or if it is you might want a smaller screw (it possible that the screw is just too long and won't close the clamp properly)

Edit: Also the hanger is not strait, but conic, so the mount might get a better fit farther from the end.

@Tampaesk8er a soda can like @rwxr notes, or nickel strip (for spot-welding) if you have it. Else go to a hardware store and buy some thin metal piping, cut it, and flatten it.

@JohnnyMeduse is right check the placement of the clamp to make sure you've got it close enough to the kingpin.

Just wanted to say thank you for the great idea, I made 4 spacers out of a diet coke can and placed one piece on every angle of the truck,  it seems to hold very tightly,maybe this will help others someday.

I had the same issue, try'd shimming and that didn't solve the problem for me. In a fit of desperation I cranked down on the larger bolt with a cheater bar and now it doesn't not move at all, though I'm slightly afraid to loosen it if I had to.

You can use some flat heat shrink if you have that lying around.

You could use aluminum foil, add or take away as much as you need.

be careful to not tighten the bolt to tight - it will strip and you won't be able to loosen it. we don't want any more problems :)

Yes, They are from Diy, after doing some research, the motor mount i bought fits Caliber one trucks, not Caliber Ii trucks. They explain it here,

I don't think that your motor mount is from diy since.... diy or @torqueboards is located in California and this seller from Ebay is from Florida :confused:

I spoke with the seller and he said he got them from Diy. My motor is a Turnigy 6374 sk3.

this is a perfect example of how speaking a statements as fact, just because you heard it somewhere, can cause a business owner to loose customers, which in turns causes a loss of product & innovation for the rest of us.  Verify your shit people.

I kind of figure that, I've bought stuff from diy and the products look profesionaly made, very happy with the pulley combo set for Kegal and the on off switch that I received this past week. Will be buying from them again.

I used an extra valve lash adjustment tool to shim my motor mount. Has multilevel sizes from .001 of an inch to I think .1 works great!
