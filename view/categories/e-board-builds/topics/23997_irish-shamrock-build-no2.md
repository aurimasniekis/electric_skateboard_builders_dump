On my clear polyurethane finished deck, I used 0000 steel wool to smooth it out and it worked great.
Made the finish really smooth but still left it shinny.
Not sure how it would work on paint though.

Have a few questions for you... thinking of painting my motor. 
Started a thread about it here: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/painting-a-motor/40262 
What kind of paint did you use? 
Did you take the motor apart to paint it?
How has the paint on the motor held up over time? 
Let me know!

Why wouldn't you paint the motor again? I'm thinking of painting mine because wrapping a shape like a motor seems hard to get the seems perfect.
