@Idea always wondered why you never created a sales topic there, and only have it in here.

Other than that back to the topic:
Are you using two different parts for the baseplate and the hanger? It seems like the baseplate is a vertigo one, and the truck is an infinity one. You bought them separately and assembled them after? It looks a bit weird to see this kind of combination haha.

Hi Stan8,

[quote="Stan8, post:4, topic:105727"]
baseplate is a vertigo one
[/quote]
I don't know what you mean with this, but maybe it is me because I'm new in this.
But I have bought per supplier one order and assembled this all together üéâ

And for sure there are always steps what can be different, but everything is working fine and I had fun with it to build this üòÑ

Maybe later I will build another one for fun/sale üòá

It's two different hangers

If you look at these complete trucks, it seems like you mixed a baseplate of one, with the hanger of another one. Nothing's wrong but it's the first time I ever see this so it felt a bit weird. :sweat_smile:

Wow indeed. I didn't notice this.
I have bought the Trampa board as a set. Strange this is a different combination. Don't know why Trampa have made this choice. For sure with a good reason!? (Hope so)

No. It was my choice.. Didn't look good. But i have done this for the color. The Infinity is chrome color and the Vertigo is in black. And my base plan is black with red üéâüëç

Because now I have little time for productions ... therefore I do not offer anything an forum.

I am coming back to the world of eSK8 in May, now I am working on several prototypes
