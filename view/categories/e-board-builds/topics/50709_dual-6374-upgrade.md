So I am currently running a single 6374 setup linked here: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-build-an-attempt-at-performance-on-a-budget/24468/26?u=penny_pincher. The setup has remained basically unchanged this entire time, and it performs well but there are a few things that I want to change so I figured I might as well go for an overhaul. The main issue I am having is with the motor mount- no matter what I do (including drilling into the trucks and using locktite) I cannot seem to get it to stay fixed for more than a month of riding at a time before I have to do it again. This is getting annoying and I want a different mounting system. Also, having to charge the Lipos with a balance charger is a tedious process and the fact that I am using an xt-90 instead of a power switch is also not very convenient. 

Basically what I know about the build is this:
- dual sealed 6374 from [Maytech](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Maytech-finger-longboard-6374-170kv-electro_60567428139.html?spm=a2700.7724838.2017115.33.7d2ef427dlKasH)
- 15mm belts and pulleys from [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/15mm-Wide-Belts-DIY-Electric-Skateboard-ABEC-Flywheel-Pulley-Kit-265-mm-255-mm/132340524149?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649) (i've had good luck with them in the past)
- 10s (probably 4p) battery (need help)
- 90 mm wheels that i'm currently using on my board
- dual [Maytech VESC](https://wholesaler.alibaba.com/product-detail/Maytech-e-bike-sensorless-controller-super_60554862428.html?spm=a2700.details.maylikever.2.5eef4737IF7YHw) (currently running single maytech VESC on my build) 
- [Remote and Receiver ](https://www.ebay.com/itm/2-4GHZ-Mini-Wireless-Remote-Controller-Receiver-Electric-Skateboard-DIY-Crafts/282777468217?epid=14011612855&hash=item41d6d9bd39:g:1LsAAOSw7z1aNm4q)- I have been using it without issue until now
- [Trucks and mounts](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Maytech-electric-skateboard-trucks-dual-motor_60742128414.html?spm=a2700.7724838.2017115.22.7d2ef427dlKasH) will also be from Maytech

**What I need help with**
- Deck- I can either reuse the same beat- up rayne deck from my current build or I can use my Loaded Fattail, but I don't know what enclosure to use with that. 
- Enclosure- If I use the rayne board I think I can get one from @psychotiller, but if I want to use the Fattail deck, i'm not sure that any enclosures exist for it.  
- Battery- I don't know what battery configuration and form factor to use and where I should get it from.

Any and all input welcome! my goal is for this board to be powerful, fast, and above all- reliable. Let me know what you all think.

30Q seems to be all the rage these days. I 10s4p is what I was planning on doing but depending on which deck I end up using I'll either want a flatpack or a stacked pack. That's the main issue i'm having for choosing a batter pack right now.

30Q is a good choice.

Yeah for now itâ€™s the best choice with the VTC6

@ElskerShadow and @bimmer can either of you recommend a enclosures that would work with the Loaded Fattail? I was wondering if the @Eboosted   vanguard enclosures might work on this deck as well.

Loaded vanguard could work, but they are designed for vanguards

I'm not really looking for another deck right now- and I also really like the kicktail on the Fattail which the vanguard doesn't have. I also have an Original Apex 40 Diamond Drop that I could theoretically use for this build. I appreciate the offer though.
