Hello dear builder,

I'm working on my first build and I have some question regarding parts. I've watched a ton of content and I'm starting to get the hang of the building process.
I know there's a lot of posts from new comers like me. Although there's some new alternatives on the market and I'm not really sure what to get.
I'm a happy Wowgo 2s owner but it failed on my lately, I think because of that freaking charging port cap which went off and let water in the battery enclosure. Not sure what component is failing, I want to rip off the heat shrinked PVC of the battery to look into it and see if there's corrosion but I won't be able to put it back on as my own heat shrink PVC didn't arrive yet.
I was hoping to use some components in my new build:

* ***The Board***:
* Loaded Vanguard flex 3 or 4 (I'm 62kg I'm not sure which one suits me the most)
* Caliber II 50" Trucks
* 85mm Orangatang 80a wheels
* Bones super red bearings
* 1/4" risers
-> 358â‚¬


## Recycled Components from wowgo:

* ***Battery*** : Samsung 44A 10s2p 4000mAh Battery -> 148Wh
-> Need to check if everything is right with it 
* ***Anti-Spark Switch*** 
-> This one should be good, just need to unsolder and resolder to the new setup.
* ***Enclosures***
-> These are not the most pretty enclosures but they'll save me ~50/100â‚¬
* ***Charging port***
-> It's included in the enclosure. I suppose this is not the failing component as my board charges normally when I plug the charger in.
-> Free :sunglasses:


## Purchased Components list:

* ***Motors***  : 2 x DIYesk8 6355 190kV - [Link ](products/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv)
* ***Motor mount***  : 2 x Single motor mount by DIYesk8 - [Link ](products/single-bolt-on-motor-mount-set-red)
* ***Pulley***  : [this](products/36t-kegel-pulley-combo-kit) 16T option from DIYesk8

->290$

## Help me choose list:

* ***ESC***  : 
-> Here's where I need help. I originally ordered the Vesc 4.12 from DIYesk8 but I read here and there that they weren't that good. I'm thinking FOCBOX Unity but not sure when those will ship. Would love their push to start feature.
Otherwise I'm looking into Flipsky's Vesc 6.6. Do those have included anti-spark included ? 
If I get those, should I get 2x single ? 1x dual ?
Also they look to have many different versions [simplified](https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/fsesc6-6-simplify-version-with-aluminum-heatsink) or [complete ?](https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/flipsky-fsesc-6-6-based-upon-vesc%C2%AE-6-heat-sink). Not sure what the difference is between all those.

* ***Controller***  : I think I would go with enertion's nano x controller [link](https://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/nano-x-enertion-2-4ghz-controller/). Would this work with Flisky's ESC or only with the focbox ?

* ***Lights***  : 
-> This is not a priority but I want to equip my board with front and rear lights for visibility and ideally they'd work with a voltage reducer on the same battery (where to solder this ?). Or should I buy a pre made solution such as shredlights (I've read mixed feelings reviews).

* ***Other*** : 
-> Here's also where I kinda lost. What do I need among these:

- Additional XT90 connectors 
- Additional XT60 ?
- Bullet connectors
- XT90/60 parallel / series connectors
- Can bus connector (I only need this if a take a 2x dual vesc i think)
- Servo connector (I think I need this in all cases to do esc -> remote receiver)
- anything else ? 

-> between 500 and 800$ i would guess


I do not have the budget for a big battery at the moment but hopefully I would upgrade later. 
What battery configuration (voltage / amps) would take full advantage from the motor specs ?
From my calculations if I build a 10s4p with Samsung 30Q 18650 cells it would cost me around 300â‚¬ including the purchase of a Spot Welder. Which is still cheaper than any website I browsed.

Sorry for the long post :slight_smile:

I would skip on the flipsky vesc due to all the little nuances that have popped up and haven't been remedied yet. Unity is too far away (time wise, I'm sure you actually want to ride the board, not stare at it )

I'm thinking used focboxes are your best bet, they can be found on the used items for sale tab

You said 10s4p was your plan for your battery and that's fine. Your other option would be 12s, which can lower system temperatures because lesser amperage flows for the same effect when you raise the voltage (** someone correct me if I'm wrong) and it provides a noticeable bump in speed 

If you're looking to get rid of your old hub motors I'm looking to grab some :slight_smile:

E: you forgot wheels! 
Would it be too shameless to link my 107mm? ðŸ˜‚

All the parts are good except:
You can't use antispark because it's inside the wowgo ESC. So you'll need a new antispark from @Martinsp or simple xt90s loop key.
Tb vesc are good. Just use them in 10s foc. You'll need canbus  or  ppm splitter.
Flipsky 6.6 dual is good in bldc.
Unity should be great. Should be shipped by this month but second batch is only in next year.
Everything else is good.
Get Riptide bushings and tunnel risers from @Alphamail
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/bushing-set-up-help/42036?u=grozniy

10s4p battery is good.

I don't mean to argue, but I wouldn't recommend putting TB vescs in foc mode, they pop like popcorn if you're not careful

E: that being said, 4.xx hardware that isn't the vesc x or focbox, or chakas vesc, has trouble with foc, so it's not only the tb vesc

I'm going to consider 12s4p then ! Still not sure which cells to use among [these](https://eu.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/price/0-4/min.-capacity-in-mah/1700-3600/discharge-current/15-35.html)

Yeah sure why not. I'm EU though so shipping might cost a lot if you're NA... They have around 600km I'd say but work perfectly.

Enertion doesn't seem to sell FOCBOX anymore :confused:

I'm getting mixed reviews on the VESCs lol. 
I think I will go flipsky 6.6 and maybe upgrade to FOCBOX later. I could then use my old vesc with a shorter deck.
I'll also investigate if I can find a place where there's a shared spot welder saving most of the cost and space in my small city flat.
What are the basics I need ?
- Heat shrink for wires + for battery 
- Soldering iron
- Foam 
- Drill
- heat gun ? or hair dryer does the work ?
- Multimeter ?
- what else ?

Yeah I'm in the US of a, I guess shipping will be too much ðŸ™ƒ

If you ever come to the states... Bring them with you? :D 

I'll link it in a second, let me type this out first so it doesn't lose my process ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

I would honestly recommend the sanyo 20700 a cells, or whatever the name is ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ they have 3000mah(I think?) And 30a discharge, meaning that if you stuck with 12s4p you would have tons of range and little voltage sag

But if you wanted to stick with 18650s , can't beat the 30q

Don't go 25r, sags more than Hopsins pants

A damn good set of Allen keys. People here (myself included) like the wera set. If you buy cheap chocolate tools you'll strip everything on your board and curse yourself!

A good set of pliers/wire strippers and a handy tool to help you solder. 

On the topic of solder, a good solder sucker and some flux will save you frustration. You'll also need wire. 12awg, 14awg and I believe 20/22 for phase wires, someone can correct me there.

Do the math on it though. Welder, cells, nickel, fishpaper, time, mistakes/wastage.

Making a single battery, or even two, I'd be surprised if it was less expensive than buying one.

Nice, that's what I needed !
Most of 10s4p are actually flat and that wouldn't fit a vanguard flexy deck ! This one is cheap as well !

According to my calculations, it should be 239$ so 210â‚¬ that's cheap AF

It's a diy remote. If you are willing to get all the parts and stuff, it is really **fun**! You do need a soldering iron and stuff like that, but they're not really expensive. The most expensive parts are the 3d printed parts, but I'm sure there are places online where you can get the prints. Just ask on the forum!

My bad, I own those but @pjotr47 told me that won't fit a 10s4p battery which I eventually want in my board.
He suggested a 10s2p Sanyo but will that work with "only" 30A max discharge or will I get a ton of sag ?

My twoâ€™s 8S 4.5 45C Hobbyking batteries mounted in serie fit in thoses, so 202A Max ! 

8S is enough for me but maybe you can buy 2 5S batteries if you didnâ€™t already buy them.
Hobbyking have some 5S 8A pack so you could have a great 30Km range without problems !

Hey guys I'm looking for some copper flat wires to avoid having to drill channel for the wires.
Not so sure about what to get though.
I'm from UE so Ebay is fine, amazon.com not so much.

I found this not sure if it would meet the requirements for the current that would go through those cables:

Then I'd put electrical tape on top and a brand new grip tape :)

Along with a good set of allen wrenches, my ceramic tweezers has been a godsend. I suppose needle-nose pliers works as well. It's been super useful but it pertains to doing electronic components stuff. Correct sizes for wire strippers too. So if you're not doing a lot of soldering and such, it doesn't matter too much. 

If you haven't already gotten a vesc, FocBoxes are for sale again. Pretty damn cheap too, I dunno if there is a limited supply or what though. 

I don't know if you're still decided on making your own battery pack or not but like people said before, you should consider mistakes and the learning process in your equation. I know the boss spot welder is pretty sweet. It does a good job and it is very small compared to the traditional spot welders you can buy. Even though it is about ~$100 (I know you use euros), the price for the correct li-po wasn't part of my initial price assessment and added about $50 more to the price. You can't get an underpowered lipo but I would have still opted for this spot welder. It's fantastic.

Hair dryer won't work for shrinking a heat shrink. A lighter will though. You don't really need a heat gun though it's a nice to have.

Get some 60/40 leaded solder. It's much easier to work with than unleaded.
