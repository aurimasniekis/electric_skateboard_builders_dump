Wud up esk8 peeps!

New build using some old stuff...

I'll be using an old 36x9 longboard with a kick tail ... Just took off the crappy grip...will be sanding the entire deck....I was gonna re-paint, but decided to use the sheet of sticker bomb for the bottom of the deck....as well as part of the top of the deck...ill have some sort of grip tape design....also thinking abt using the EL wire that I have as well.....ill run red leds on the bottom, and may use a laser for the rear tail light (not sure yet) .... And of course dual 15w headlights 

I'll be sporting Caliber 50 trucks that I'm contemplating on covering with the fake carbon fiber sheet....but not sure how it will hold up....

I'll be running 12s lipo with @torqueboards 12s ESC diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-12s-120a-car-esc-opto-hv/ with 15/36 gearing on 83mm wheels with @chaka's new 170kv 5065 motor  http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/om5065-170kv
...to mount everything I'll be using @onloop's tried and true motor mounts http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/carbon-fiber-motor-mount-enertion/

Depends ....

He easiest set up is this 

https://www.ebay.com/itm/391000880573 

I bypass this when I connect the headlights so they say static even if there's a disco happening under my feet lol 


Plus a switch to turn off all the lights during the day 😉

@Michaelinvegas Ok, I'll bite. What about the laser tail lights? I must have missed that, but I am genuinely interested. And thanks for the links. It was the eagle eye lights I was thinking of, but wanted to know which ones you like our where you bought from. I think it's finally time to get lit and do some knight ridering, but all the lighting options have my head spinning. Makes me just want to zip tie a flashlight to my board until I figure something out.

So I tested it out on my old ride ....👆🏻

I diffused the laser light with a glue stick .... It was super bright ....


But it actually looks like this un-diffused

@Michaelinvegas Oh yeah, the glowing red board weenus. I do remember seeing that and wondering what that was, but was afraid to ask. Just missing some glowing, blue...spheres. Lol. 

Those laser lights are pretty cool though. Never seen anything like that, except for when things get scanned in movies. Shine four of them in all directions and make it look like your riding a magic laser carpet.

I think the adhesive takes hold once you put pressure on it...you will see it's not really sticky but if you notice there are tiny dimples on the sticky side...once you rub it down...it seals up...I go over it with heat after to tidy it up and make sure it's stuck down good

.....and mounted them on this board...looks butch....

I had some UV LEDs on white pcb left over .... Made four rows of those and added the head lights <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/e7ec848097afe385fc15106a030dd51ca9579633.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/2cbf8c36ae851278336e320cf0606da46087c72a.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/8a47b44d97ddb4ad0fab0b635b5960f76063ed28.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Compleated 

Well...I decided to just take the parts from the penny board since it was kinda scary for other people to ride ...I thought this deck would be more suitable...plus Instarted to have doubts abt making this specific deck 12s....Hence my new Madrid board....

Any hoot ... This will be the loaner....gonna go for the first test ride....

Currently can out two 6s batteries to make it a 6s2p  lipo set up 

Should be good for 10+ miles at decent speed on 15t/36t

@ajaynagra  Sure man ...just for you....

Found this at a place called Harbor Frieght and Tool one day...

Costs a whooping $4.99 plus tax

I realized that it has two clasps on each side...positive snap to close...so it's secure.  It has a translucent hinged lid so I can check voltage and just easily open and close it without extra hardware.  And best of all it can hold two 6s 8000mah batteries if I want...while having everything enclosed.

I just cut some slits for some Velcro straps and added Velcro pads inside to adhere to the velcro I place on the batteries to reduce any sliding around....

There's a handle...I just hack that sucker off...

So, far it's saves me time .... And is the tidiest "lunch box" solution for esk8...and you can't beat the price...So it's a winner for me.

Looks strong and secure , its a shame that on eboards the enclosure hides the design on of the deck.

Did you make the sticker bomb yourself?

Yeah...the biggest challenges in DIY Esk8 building ... IMO...is the enclosure ...

Do you spend time creating an enclosure or spend X amount of dollars? How much do you have to drill into the deck?

Using this...I don't even think about it anymore 


Don't get me wrong .... I love all those awesome custom and pre made enclosures...it makes the builds super tight....but for me...I use lipos for now....I use various lipo setups and I like the options.....also...it's the bottom of the deck ... The ride is the most important thing...

The sticker bomb is from eBay ...just search for sticker bomb sheet ....they have all sorts....racing, cartoons ...even zombies.

Yeah i like cost effective solutions i use lipos too. I dont fancy drilling a lot of hole in my deck since i dont have the right equipment. The ride is the most important thing but i wish there was an easier of way of making the board look nice without the premade enclosures

Best would be of course routing the deck or having a pre built board that has compartments ... But agajn there is cost factor.

Going the DIY enclosure can result in a totally pimp build ...but again that adds more time to a build.

There's so many boards types ... There will never be a perfect all around solution. But maybe someone will prove me wrong.

It a matter of personal prefrence ... What matters to you... Looks, cost, functionality? I chose the latter two at the sacrifice of looks....and I can live with that...and 99% of the people are none the wiser and still say it looks good

Do you mean attach to the board......? Do you mean you want me to tell you how to wire them?

If you are running 6s just splice some battery power into one of these

https://www.ebay.com/itm/321348809000 


Then to a switch that is attached to your lights.

Volia! 

Use some insulated clamps for the lights ... and 💥 bam

I wouldn't use that one specifically, you want closer to 12v, not 5v (i've got almost the same lights, 5v won't cut it) But a buck converter is what you want.
I think this one will suit a little better.

Since I got 10 bulbs, i connected one directly to the battery to test one and it works perfecty, will it be ok to splice it in to the red and black wires of the vesc so when i turn the board on they also turn on? Also, will it use up alot of power from the batteries?

What @Michaelinvegas and I would recommend is to splice in the input leads of one of those step-down converters to the input of the VESC, then put a switch on one of the output leads of the converter (then you can turn them off during the day), and then wire however many you want in parallel (I imagine 2 would be quite sufficient) from the other side of the switch to the other lead of the converter.

They will draw 9W each, probably adding around 0.36 Amps of battery draw to your system (6s if I read your previous posts right)

I'm trying to figure out how I'm gonna put a Bluetooth module and speakers on to a board right now! Lol 50w per channel! To bad I can't fit 50w speakers ..... yet.
