Hello guys, I just finished my lightest eSk8, I call it the Biohazard because my GF is going to kill me to steel it from me.

I'll be a short commute board, the board is surprisingly light even with those 107mm wheels. I'm waiting for my Boa Hatchlings to make it even ligther.

Parts list:
Jet Spud 29" @JLabs 
Caliber II trucks 50"
107mm ABEC 11 Flywheels
Zealous bearings
Dual 6355 from @Torqueboards
10s3p battery Samsung 30Q
ebay BMS for charging
eBoosted Spud SS enclosure
Enertion FocBoxes

Freaking awesome! You definitely have an eye for design. I ride my spud deck more than any other...super easy to carry around and throw under a table when I ride to a restaurant or bar. I have freeboard binding on mine, which adds a ton of control and make convenient handles for carrying.

Hey guys, I just came from the test ride.

First off, no wheel bite, my trucks are not tight at all, it has great turning ratio at low speeds, more than my darth maul, maybe like my Vanguard on Ronins however at high speed I was really impressed by this deck, it's more stable than my Trampa and I ride 55km/hr on it, I need more riding time to get to full speed and feel it.

BTW I lost my Caliber original bushings so I had to use some spare Venoms SHR Double Barrel 91a, I don't think this could have something to do with the no wheel bite scenario, but I can lift two side wheels just balancing all my body to one side.

Here's what I was talking about.

Adding risers only increases leverage... So even with bigger wheels I get some nice bite

![com-resize%20(3)|210x118](upload://5V42H69pJl3RMVaiW531jmann3l.gif)

I guess it may be different on electric. But slides downhill I go full lean quite a bit. (You can see paint is worn away in the wells from bite)

It's Glassurit 55 line car paint with matte clearcoat. It's pretty high quality car paint mainly used on Porsche and Audis

I prepared the perfect color match using the Abec 107mm as reference.

After riding this board for 2 days here are my impressions:

1. The board is very stable at medium to low speeds, less wobbles than my Pho3nix, easier to ride

2. The trucks feel more tighten than my old calibers, could be because I'm runing Venom SHR Double Barrel Bushings (91a), but the turning ratio is great because the wheel base is so small, so it's a good combination

3. There is no wheel bite even if I put all my weight with both feet over one wheel. If I jumo on the flare the wheelwell would touch the wheel, however this won't happen on a real world.

4. The ride is very carvy, I can carve pretty much a lot. I can make sharper turns than on my Vanguard

5. The deck is pretty stiff but feels solid the concave is pronounced so it gives you a nice leverage for precise steering

6. The 107mm flwheels absorb all the road imprefections but I'd say they damp vibrations only 10% more than my 97mm flwheels

7. The 16/40T pulley ratio is good on 10S3P but maybe a 15/40T would be more suitable in order to get more torque. Speed is more than enough, I still don't push it to the limit even though it feels pretty stable

8. The Vicious grip tape is amazing, I won't use anything else ever

9. I love the 10s3p because of it's weight and because it charges faster, for short commutes it's better than 10s4p or 12s4p. It's doesn't jump forward from a dead stop like a 12s4p, it take a lottle longer but once you gain speed and push it it's powerful enough to ride very fast.

10. I can carry the deck everywhere, just grab them by the trucks and go inside a cab, walk up stairs, carry it to a restaurant and just leave it under the table.

I love that if one wants to see how to build their specific type of build, they need only look at the builds of @Eboosted. Alan your style and aesthetics are amongst the greatest. Let alone the obvious quality. Your battery has inspired me to change the way I'm going to build my mini 10s2p battery. All the extra room! So good bud. Great build.

Hello guys for those that are still thinking about 107mm vs wheelbite, I made a video for you:

https://youtu.be/0Go5vHc9RJ4

Is it possible to fit 107mm flywheels without wheelbite?

Yes, it's is possible. I've been riding this board for 4 days already and love it, the 107mm make the board look like a small tank.

Is there any wheelbite?

No under regular circumstances, but if you push all you weight with both feet into one corer of the deck you will get wheelbite but this is not a real life scenario, if you are going to push it like this then there would be no decks in the market that won't get wheelbite, most longboards will have to be redisigned, even the Raptor 2 has wheelbite if I forced this way.

Actually if you use the shorter wheelbase it does have a little stubby fat tail of sorts.

I use it to lift the nose up for a mall grab... No Ollie's though

No, there are two version of this enclosure:

The SS Single Stacked

and DS double stacked

10S7P has not neen tested but should be possible, 10S6P is 100% possible, if you get creative you ,ight even be able to fit a 10S8P without BMS and reaaaaaly tight space.

The Jet Spud and Potato are the same model, just different name (to my understanding). 

I will have 8 full kits available mid next month. It will include everything for you to make a Jet Spud Build and you can pick single 6374 or dual 6355. PM me to get on the waiting list. This is sort of the unofficial announcement. Oh yes. And I changed my profile pic. I figured it was about time.

Details: 29‚Äù Jet Spud, @eboosted enclosure, 11s3p battery, trucks, motor mounts, pulleys, belts, FOCBOX, motors, and remote. It will have everything you need. Only 8 available for the first run.

The only reason I haven't yet is I see your darth maul build and think I want that instead üòçüòçüòç

Or the LaCroix board, but I'd be more worried about maneuvering around people (I work in a downtown area).

I'll probably get both eventually but the Spud seems like a good first build.

I also use the jet Spud at the maximum wheels base position and the tail is still usable. I feel confident at really low speed for sharp turns although I have tried better tail that are easier to play with at higher speed. At least for my ability.

Just seen this thread. What an amazing board ! Love the details and and colours. Makes me realise I really need to learn all the other stuff that comes with esk8 building.... this board is an inspiration :) 

Your board looks better than any factory/branded board I've ever seen. Good job !

So, I was using one of those USB extenders to make it easier to reach it to update settings, but the Focbox power wires were pushing the USB extender plug down until the female port from the ESC broke and shorted the phase wires inside the ESC. 

![20180615_203435|690x388](upload://sTwvqfxkY90whPi6ZiK5lQqx7j3.jpg)

Do not use USB extenders if they are near power wires.

Question about your motor mount, you said you used the TB mount with a custom clamp, do you think the regular TB clamp will work?

very curious about your clamps! I cannot for the life of me get it straight on the trucks and align motor pulley and wheel pulley... :confused: either my belt slips to the wheel or the other side, but it's never spot on and it bothers me a lot!

Are you talking about the hanger clamps?, Well I have the same issue.

The best way to align them is to install a crossbar

Yes that's what I'm talking about. No crossbar: I have a single motor setup... I guess I'll have to fiddle around with the alignment. Thank you for your answer :slight_smile:

I'm really hoping to make a Spud now, your Biohazard is sick & is perfect for a short esk8 board - what BMS/Anti-Spark/Charger setup did you go with?

Your build is so beautiful. Way to advertise for your enclosure. I wanted a spud build as soon as I saw this.

I'd say 25-30kms depending on your weight and you riding habits

If you've not already ordered and are still wondering, double stack a 10s3p.
