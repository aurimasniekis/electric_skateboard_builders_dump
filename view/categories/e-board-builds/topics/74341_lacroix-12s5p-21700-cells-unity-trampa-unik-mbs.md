Currently scoping components for my build, shopping list is as follows. 

Cells/Deck/Motors already purchased

1. LaCroix Deck and Enclosure
2. 60x21700 cells
3. Focbox Unity
4. Trampa Super Hubs/Rims + 6.5' tires/tubes
5. Trampa 66T/15T gears/pulleys
6. Alien Power Systems Remote
7. MBS Matrix Pro II trucks
8. Energus "tiny" smart bms
9. Maytech 6374 Motors
10. Other bits.

Not 100% sure i can squeeze in 60x21700 cells into the enclosure. I built a rough CAD model of the LaCroix enclosure based on information I had. It does look possible.

No, not yet, I suspect it will be some time, (first shipments, maybe at the end of the month?) but I need the Unity, as it is small and will enable me to squeeze in the extra row of cells.

The LaCroix deck is ordered, but that will not be shipped for a few more weeks anyway. i'm in no rush. Currently scoping out components.

So just added the 5mm risers from e-toxx @Nowind to my build, (thanks for the advice @philvanzu).  I did build my own CAD model for the MBS matrix pro riser, but couldn't find anyone locally to 3d print in a tough enough material.

![riser_mbs|379x252](upload://oEIc9DyVkxraw0DuwYL248e4PuK.jpeg) 

All items now purchased, except the BMS from energus, (not sure if that thing is overkill)

Now the long wait starts, as the components are shipped to me here in Perth, (gives my bank balance time to recover :slight_smile: )

Because you can fit more Ah in the enclosure compartments !

I can fit one row of cells in each compartment,

so options are

* (12x18650)x6, Max Cell capacity is 3500Mah
* (10x21700)x6, Max Cell capacity is 5000Mah

I'll let you do the math, but it equates to roughly 16% more capacity opting for the 21700s. The larger cells also don't degrade as quick as the 18650s. (=more charge cycles)

LaCroix offers a similar option, 60x18650 or 50x20700. The 20700 being a few hundred bucks more for similar reasons.

That should explain my choice.

You have right that are larger but you can put more 18650 then but in this shape you have right. The 21700 degradate the same as 18650, all depends on Amps.

The price is the biggest difference. How much you pay for 21700? 
Despite the fact you can buy Sanyo Ga for 2,99$, VTC6 for 3,19$ and VTC5A for 2,79$ is more valuable to build packs based on 18650

```
@silaczdotoalet, if you want to debate, 18650 vs 21700, then perhaps you should start a new thread. 

You are correct that 18650s provide the best bang for buck, but that is because they are mass produced in far larger quantities than the 21700s

My build is not about saving $, it’s about building the best board I can. I have a limited amount of space in the enclosure and opting for the 21700 format enabled me to squeeze in the most capacity, (even if the cells were twice/three times the price! )

If opting for the 18650 would have given me more capacity, I would have used that format, as I did for my current board, (10s8p, 18650)

Today’s job, insulating the compartment sides with a little fishpaper.

All the insulation is done, lashings of fishpaper and kapton tape, cells sitting on a comfy bed of 2mm high density neoprene foam.

Spacers 3D printed to keep the cell packs away from the switches/charging ports on the sides.

Just waiting on the shrink wrap and the mbs trucks (now nearly 9 weeks to come from Germany). Feeling frustrated, might start building another board to keep me occupied and make use of the new spot welder.

## \#48 Posted by: Adstars Posted at: 2019-01-13T03:52:44.185Z Reads: 248

Yes it’s 59a rated for discharge and 20a for charge. Plan is to bypass for discharge, think the unity and a fuse should be safe enough. 

Can keep an eye on the individual cells using the bms bluetooth module and app during discharge though.

Still haven’t setup your mounts as I’m waiting patiently for my mbs matrix pro trucks. Seems mbs can’t keep up with demand. Can’t source them locally until February, so I ordered from Germany some 8 weeks ago, still not here and these summer days are ticking by.

Ok build is complete, (ish)

Thanks to all the guys on this forum for help and advice. The quality of parts you guys make continues to amaze me.

Thanks to @okp @Arch @trampa @EileenMaytech @ervinelin  @dannychan @Nowind 

Special mention to @SkaterBoy58 for being so patient and providing a rediclous amount of guidance.

Loving the results, took it out for a maiden run last night and this thing bites! Nursing a few bruises this morning.

Review of the new Maytech remote and the Neptune 15 BMS coming shortly.

Did the battery fit without any gasket ?

Yes, the cells went in without the need of a gasket.

I did go down from a 12s to 11s. Needed the extra space for some additional electrics, voltage converter for light etc.
