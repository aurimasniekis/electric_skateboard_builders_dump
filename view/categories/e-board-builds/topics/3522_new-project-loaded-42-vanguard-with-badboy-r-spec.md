Hi,

I just received this elements to build my e-longboard. I just waiting for the VESC from Enertion.
I need to build an space cell with BMS included, but I don't know with what technology; 10S3P LiPo or 12S LiFePo4. For the price and range probably I will chose the more dangerous LiPo. It should take more space but I think increasing range it will increase the fun. 

I accept suggestions.

Best regards

I am a fan of Lipos! A lot of builders in here are building boards with 18650 battery cells, but it gets too complicated for my taste. Maybe I will try it out in the future. For your first build I would recommend that you go with Lipo batteries simply because of the convenience.

I bought a new puley 36 that it will be adapted to attach on the in heat wheel. 

I found a big problem with te motor mount adapter. It is not 100% compatible with my Caliper 50. I was sure that the enertion truks had the same specifications. I should work in this adaptor :( pain in the ***.

You must have something on wrong if the motor mount doesn't fit correctly

For the pictures of the enertion trucks it seams the angle is more vertical than my Caliper. 

If you can se my picture I didn't install the truck elevator. Maybe it will improve a bit the gap separation between motor and board, but I'm not sure if it will be enoght.

Depending on the deck and how you angle the mount...yes you may or may not use a riser.

There's nothing wrong with the mount

You do realize that the three bolts holding the carbon to the main mount...you can play with the angle a little it doesn't need to be topped out

Do you think? I can't find another mount position but maybe i'm wrong. I will attach a detailled pictures to discuse it. Thanks.

Hi guys,

I decided to modify the pice of carbon of my Enertion motor mount. For any reason this carbon pice put my motor super high and then touches on the board very easy. This is my new alu pice. It was a nightmare because I had a belt to short. I bougt a biger one.

pretty sure its 100% compatible with caliber 50s. problem is: yours look like 44s! :smile: check the baseplate boardside!

left is 50s, right is 44!

Yes, you are right. It is a caliber 44º, I was completely sure that it was a 50º.
I'm afraid about if it will be useful this 44º angle with a motor. Do you know if this 6º of difference play a roll improving the control a high speeds?

i have a 42" vanguard myself and with that giant wheelbase its low speed maneuverability is already pretty bad, so imo 50s suit it better, but im sure 44s work too!

Bad days, since 9 of april I'm waiting a VESC.

Jason, wherever you are probably you should try to solve an easy issue with my vesc shipment that is arrested in the customs office with a wrong invoice. DHL has blocked 10 days there waiting to a good invoice from Enertion to be shipped to me.

I pretty sure that you will solve this very quickly to avoid waste money if they return the goods to you.
Thanks a lot in advance.
order #2820

Roger.
