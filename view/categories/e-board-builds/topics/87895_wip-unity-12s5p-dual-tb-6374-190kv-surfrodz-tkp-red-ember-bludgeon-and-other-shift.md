Alright so here it goes my second build, Ill keep It short and sweet. After riding my other board until it became a unfixable mess I decided that it was about time to start building a second board. I knew one thing that I wanted was a bigger battery and larger wheels to get around the shitty, not maintain, and ruined streets of my town. After drooling over all the RedEmber Board builds I knew that I had to get one of those boards.

My parts list is

**@treenutter RedEmber Boards Bludgeon**

- Glass frit on the top to keep the look of the board

**@psychotiller Altered wedge enclosure**

- skinned in Carbon Fiber for that extra sexy look (WIP)

     - Thank you so much @Sender for helping me out with the skinning part 

 **SurfRodz TKP 177mm with 90mm Axels**

- The 90mm axels allows for 15mm pulleys with dual 6374

**@torqueboards  2 x 6374 190kv motors and the TB110 wheels**
![ac2b97c77fabe4ed20c45d67d8f5f17fefc8d2e5_2_750x1000|375x500](upload://gleezFIX9TTUrY3xDOn9hVbIz2a.jpeg) 
![9d7a0166c0b44644d7a7515516c7545f892b587f_2_562x750|374x500](upload://hJULYYehP1gKYepscSAthFlDtts.jpeg) 

- The Dual 6374 will be a huge step up from my single 6355

- The TB110's will hopefully help with my shit roads 
   
  - @b264 You praised the wheels so much I just couldn't  think of any better wheels

 **BKB Kegel wheel pulleys 32t and 40t**
![15532529196565775070100165927612|375x500](upload://zxSJ7LKQW18MfYMk3rJhzLA2PAu.jpeg) 
- 15/40 ratio 

- used some pulleys and spacers to make them work with SurfRodz 10mm axels

**@akhlut  TKP motor mounts and Carbon Fiber X braces**

- I had them powder coated a matt black and will see how the powered coat holds up 
![15532516931778225074388030105425|375x500](upload://vSuqfpBu3WwdUXbUl99AaE76ImR.jpeg) 
- I can't thank him enough for all his help this build wouldn't be possible without him

**@thisguyhere/@akhlut 12s5p battery - Built using Boss level custom spot welder 1/2 done**
![15532518566228526687301076446348|375x500](upload://q97hITSXUoqPgBt0NeTolReQgWU.jpeg) 

- Got the battery PCBs, nickel strip, and from the 12s d140 BMS from thisguyhere

-  akhlut Helped me out with the Fusing 

- there is also a fuse on the charge port to make @b264 happy 

**Focbox Unity** 

- after seeing the Unity in person at the NYC Enertion ride I knew I had to get one  

**@winfly Nano - W (Enertion nano X mod)**
![15532517625055328978772402505884|375x500](upload://dOg2N8pF9mk7DUFOLECOFVl1dbO.jpeg) 
 
 - I like the feel of the mod a lot better then the Nano X

- hopefully in the future I can get something better like a Hoyt Puck or OSRR @DerelictRobot

Theres a lot of little things like fender washers and cable braids to add touches of color here and there to make it look ascetically pleasing.

Theres probably something Im missing and Ill add a bunch to this in the morning like pictures and more info.

I have everything currently, but the TB110, Unity, and RedEmber board but once I get those I will be all ready to put it all together.

Another note is I am using Rydesafe reflective decals from rydesafe.com I encourage everyone to get these they look super good and will get you seen by cars in the night.
![20190322_075139|690x407](upload://g1hCXgtAeI29xLYgzGggzejqzAq.jpeg) 
![20190322_075210|690x355](upload://5Ri9oglVciUiXYIgcOVdt314izi.jpeg) 

Please ask question and make suggestions for what I should add to it. 

Thank you to everyone of this forum for all the help and I love every single one of you (except @brenternet he is weird) Thank you all so much

Anyways you just sign up.

It's more like eBay then anything, everyone has their own rates for buy/sell and you can buy/sell with almost anything, PayPal, gift cards, ect.

You can even send cash via mail... Ffs
