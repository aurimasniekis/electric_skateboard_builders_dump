hmmm what to do, how to do it, how to mold it =) Got all my stuff in finally...just finished (pretty much) my first diy ebike build... and now onto this tomorrow... 

ditching the meepo deck... swapping for a 40" blank deck... and trying to build a case for 8p with the kydex sheet in the background but using 6p to start... 

dont have resources to build a nice wood buck to mold over... 
wondering if i can press the kydex into the baking pans?

If i mold around the pans theres not as much free space for mounting hardware as id like and theres a bit extra free space inside the pan that make me want to press it in hmmmm... <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/4/04e1d3e0d1aeab86c68135ee3da6338b04ce3d72.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/c/7c93f8149d33b741001a110a4ca6e717c7356ab5.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I don't think you could press it in. Smaller baking pan or 2-3 small ones(loaf pans) side by side would be your best, cheapest option probably

what about a cardboard buck? i have a fair amount of double thick from all my deliveries.. i can cut enough layers to get to 2.5", i know it will compress some with pressure BUT stacked enough will resist as well.. and can be shaped to perfection...

Wouldn’t recommend cardboard , I used it but it definitely didn’t turn out as well as I planned because of compression

what if you over stack it a hair to compensate for the compression?

May work , you just won’t get as good of a shape as you would if you used a wooden buck

I made a shape that went over the mold and left some space for the kydex to fit inbetween, then heated and pushed, worked fine. I think only one corner got semi bad, but was very minor. But yeah, its hard with only heatgun. 
Dropped mine and it made some burn marks on the enclosure.
