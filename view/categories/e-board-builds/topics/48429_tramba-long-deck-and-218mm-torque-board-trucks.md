Hi is this possible?

I have 2 63mm motors and 4x 6x2 inch wheels which i need a deck for. I have though of the Tramba Long. But i am not sure i can mount Torque board trucks 218mm? What do you guys think, printing a angled riser is possible im just not sure it will work

Man there have been 5 threads about this this week only, answer is no, you need to make a raiser.
If you trust plastic go for it, i strongly do not recommend it but people still do it.

I dont know with you, but i interprets this as a question where you are asking if you can mount the TB 218mm trucks to the trampa deck...

If buying a Trampa deck- do not buy calibers or similar. You will need angeled risers, and it will end up looking both high and weird af.

If buying calibers or similar- do not buy an angeled deck like trampa (unless youâ€™re a gangsta like @okp) . Again, it will be got damn high.

Now, if you choose not to listen to me (which you should btw) the risers CAN be 3D printed- However they wont be the strongest and may crack/snap at some point.
