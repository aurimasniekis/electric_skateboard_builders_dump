Please use the search function before you create a new thread! There are already plenty of information about different decks. I just searched for "deck" and found to got threads for you:

I did search for other posts, I just wanted to see what people have done with certain decks in their own build, I saw the first post in my search, but didn't see the second. Either way I'd still like to see what people have done in their builds :)

Edit: I'd like to see what others have, but if any mods find this spam or anything, remove it.

I like the general shapes of these, not sure how I feel about the cut outs in the board though.

@Airmacx,  I find google image search to be a helpful source of inspiration.  How about these search terms: 

"exotic design skateboard deck"
"marquetry skateboard" (my favourite)
"aluminium skate deck"
"carbon fibre skate deck"

And any other search terms which may tickle your fancy...

More so looking for just the shape of the deck, but marquetry looks really nice.

Really want to use Jet spud, but the wheelbase is too small to fit my enclosure and motor and stuff.

Before finding the Jet, I almost went with a neversummer board (like the reaper), they have some pretty cool stuff

Yeah the 35 looks good, maybe the 36 will be better have to check the 36.  My enclosure is 22 inches long and I need maybe 4 or 5 inches for the motor and stuff so looking to get 27-28 inch wheelbase. Thanks for the suggestion.

I really want a LHB one but pretty sure the shipping costs more than the deck itself plus usd conversions. 

Not looking to spend that much on a deck either I  regards to the enertion deck, and I don't really like the shape.

Yea, it's almost as flexible as a flex 3 Vangaurd. I used foam and spacers to stop the enclosure from bending when carving

I think that Longhairedboy has a flat shipping rate.
