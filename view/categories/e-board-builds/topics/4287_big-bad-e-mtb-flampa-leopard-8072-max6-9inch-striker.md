Building a new Board with the Leopards i tested last weeks on this build:
viewtopic.php?f=35&t=79525

Its an mix of Parts from Trampa and from Flame.
Mountainboarding guys call it FLAMPA

Its an 16PLY Holypro Deck from Trampa and the Trucks are the Dirtpipe-V2 from Flame.

I use the Leopards with Hobbywing MAX6 Esc´s, ISO-05 Chaindrive with a 
reduction from 10:50, Cryptic hubs and 9Inch Striker Tires.
Powered with 8S 10000mAh 40C SLS Lipos.

Have a look on the first mock up of the Parts:

Thx. 
These are the adapters for the Leopard Motor.
To reduce the bolting circle to fit my mounts, also its usefull because you dont have to shorten the motorshaft.

Got a Rc plate made out of 3mm carbon for mounting the MAX6 and a waterproof Traxxas reciever box.
Just have to drill 3XM4 treads in the deck, really easy.

Its light and compact, and the MAX6 comes as waterproof so no need for more (-;

Hey Jenso that looks awesome! Your manufacturing skills are first class. Just wondering if you did it again would you go the same again or a 10s with torqueboards esc and why? Also do you think these motors are overkill or would you do it again?
Thanks

Thank you Shane
At the moment i would go the same way. 
Because the Hobbywing perform extremly nice, are waterproof and IMO bulletproof.

I´m interrested to test the torqueboards esc´s, but i dont have them here.

I got the Board running since today :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:  and yes they are a bit overkill but a good overkill. This means that they startup really smooth, better then everything else i ever testet!
Even on inclines its better then my other setups. 

But be aware to be extremly sensitive on the trigger ! Have to say i run it on max agressive Setups, highest Punchlevel and Brakelevel.

I would say these motors are interresting for heavier riders, people who wanna ride under extrem conditions and Torque junkies :imp:

I´m really impressed how the new components perform.
I never was a friend of 9Inch wheels, but i have to say that it´s really nice to ride with them.

The performance is brutal, geared for 45kmh on max aggresive Punchlevel, it kicks your ass.

Need some more runs to finetune the trucks. First they where to stiff, then i changed the "elastomere" now its on high speed a little bit loose. But i´m on the right way.

The board is good to control in drifts and wheelies, for the first runs i´m really happy with it.

Would you say using these motors is a big range killer or do they get the job done easier so economy is close to using say 6374?

Thanks menwaylo
So would you say that the larger motors are the way to go or not really? Those leopards are hard to find by what about alien powers 80mm 170kv? I would only be running 10s though. Im really looking for something to ride to the shops and friends houses via the train but also want something that puts a big smile on my face too. Got street tyres on order but will probably get dirt ones a but later once its finished.

These motors are nice and very powerfull, but also a 6374 is fast and put a BIG smile in your face.

Yes the range drops a bit but not that massive i guess.
I tracked another run with these motors and get about 5km with 5AH with a average speed of 20kmh.

woow what :astonished:

I did an 23kph average cruise tour with vesc and single 6374, fairly loose belt and managed my best value so far: 9Wh/km! (it was a max range check afterall, so I didnt go mad along the way)

with your 8S and 5Ah, your energy consumption is 144Wh/5km = 29Wh/km, more than 3 times as much. :astonished:

was that a cruise tour or one of your "going mad with power wheelie whenever I can" gopro runs?

Hey.
I guess my driving style is always a little progressive. 
Love to pull the trigger hard so that the wheels spinout on loose underground.
And i think that these moments will pull alot Amps, because the Max6 can deliver high currents and the Leopards take it (-;

Do i get you right that your compared run was with single motor?
If so i think 3 times much isnt that bad (-; one 63mm Motor compared to two 80mm motors...

@JLabs
yes i´m selling the parts.

Have had some more runs on this board done:
The offroad characteristics with the 9Inch Striker are absolute amazing, i never thought that it make such a different compared to the 8inch ones.

try to make some video footage shortly to show what i mean.

[/quote]

dual or single nearly doesnt matter, since the single motor works twice as hard compared to each individual motor of the dual drive in that moment. havent seen a conclusive comparison of dual vs. single efficiency - at least my setups only used up slightly more energy in dual config, but Im comparing my old dual 12S torqueboard ESC vs. single vesc of my latest builds (and as far as I know the tb escs didnt have regen braking for example)!

In my beginnings i started with single drive, as i moved on to dual drive i mentioned a higher battery draw maybe about 20-30%. The same i mentioned as i tested the Quad drive later with 4XSK3.

Ok folks, I had the chance to record my energy consumption, riding the off-highway tracks of Amrum. Really not that progressive as Nowind's driving style (about 15 km/h average), but I also get values of 23 up to 28 Wh/km. 
My setup is a Trampa with Nowinds dual belt drive and two 6374@210 kV. The higher energy consumption is achieved when drawing narrow circles on a soccer field :sunglasses:
I got the feeling, that a lot of energy goes into the flexure of the belts. Even on roads with moderate downward gradient I have to energize :electric_plug:. Nowind, you also have energy consumption values for your belt drives compared to chain drives?

Hey.
After very good results with the Robbe Roxxy 9120 ESC´s on my Trampa Board,
i decidet to get a second pair to test them with the Leopards on the Flampa.

Also i want to fit the Beltdrive parts to the Flame Trucks and the 12mm shaft of the Leo´s.
IMO the Beltdrive is a great option for very high power setups and the Flame truck is excelent for fitting parts.
The complete truck is machined and the Mount can be placed in any wanted angle and position.

First of all i nededet the Motorpulleys for this big motorshaft : 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/5/d5f7e8996d83858c10dbf02612493c63b8ffb238.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Its not much left of the inside of the pulley, the originally one sided hub was removed trough the 12H7 boring : 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/5/f55e6b1098d88163481bcddc123538eb6fb66899.JPG" width="666" height="500">

I will use only Loctide for glueing them onto the shaft, amazing how strong this adhesive is!

Because i really want the full possible length of motorshaft to support the long pulley i cant go with the "Leopard-Adapter-Plates" .... i have to slightly redesign the slots for the 43mm pitchcircle with M5 threads : 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/d/dddcd250648fba1bbe02ec536f705f7cab01de34.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Left one is with 5.2mm Slots on the correct pattern:

Wheelpulleys are the new universal ones with 3 common pitchcircles of Trampa and Flame:
The one on the left.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7579fc0f07833a30719c085278cc20dc84ea0eff.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Fitted to the Flame Cryptic Hub with new red 9 Inch Strikers : 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/4/14c1fab7f582cd060d701550e06c489a3cd1c8c8.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Rollers are the same as i use on the Trampa Beltdrive, just with a 1mm smaller spacer to get a little more clearence for the huge tires:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/5/65c88a71f0f5056d3f8f4bf29b57733bde27db45.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Belts i decidet to go with the HP Series from Optibelt, they should be 50% stronger then normal Optibelts. But double the price! Dont have any issues with the normal ones but like to use best parts and btw the red HP Logo fits so nicely in the colour theme :sunglasses:

Also get the Flame Bindings as you see here, really good stuff. Nice and comfortable:

Still a tight fit with the external BEC:

Got done the first miles on the new setup today.
Rides really nice with the 9Inch and of course more powerfull with 12S.
Got some cutoffs by hard acceleration on high grip surfaces, only milliseconds but noticeable.
Have had these issues mentioned with MAX6 sometimes too. Not really sure whats the reason for that, maybe its a result of overheating one of the motors a few weeks ago caused due a woodenpiece which blockades the rotor... Dont know for sure ... But have tons of fun today by drifting the hell out of it :smiling_imp:

Optical they are a highlight.
Also the complete machined corpus is nice for mounting Motors.
But the steering ability dont suit my needs.
Like the spring loaded stuff more.
