Been lookin to build a board, have about $450 AUD budget

All this work out to about $420

Single Belt Motor Mounted to Trucks - http://www.diyeboard.com/single-belt-drive-1400w-n5055-motor-power-truck-front-truck-kit-p-421.html


ESC - http://www.diyeboard.com/v11-single-belt-motor-sine-wave-foc-esc-speed-controller-p-523.html


Batteries (2x 3s 500mah) https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-3s-30c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html

Deck (with trucks and wheels for spares) https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/AWOL-COMPLETE-LONGBOARD-SKATEBOARD-KIT-5-SETUP-DECK-TRUCKS-WHEELS-SKATE/263571321874

Basically I need to know if that is everything I need to build a board from nothing and Will that motor and batteries be enough to haul a 70kg bloke and have a decent rage of ~15km

Or would I be better off getting the 90mm dual hub motors https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/6364-90mm-Dual-Hub-Electric-Skateboard-Longboard-Motors-Drive-Parts-Brushless-AU/152832782374

If you are gonna use China parts. Why not just get a China board. Meepo, wowgo, backfire. All in your price range and work out of the box. If you want power, make a dual belt vesc board.

They're a bit over my price range. They're about $100 more than what I can spend atm. I know I'm kinda rushing into it buying cheap stuff and I could eventually save up and buy a $1000 board but that wouldn't be for quite a while. Someone recommended a single belt motor on 6s, similar to this one https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-245kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html
I kinda feel like single belt motors would last longer than the chinese dual hub motors but I have no idea about electric motors and I would eventually put another motor on in the future to make it a dual belt esk8 while upgrading from the basic single belt ESC. https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/ESC-Single-Motor-Electric-Longboard-Skateboard-Controller-Replace-Control-Modul/123149565221

Would a single belt on 6s be roughly = to a china board?

I feel like your budget isn't realistic, if you're starting from absolute scratch you'll be buying wiring, connectors, specific tools and other miscellaneous items which can really add up. 

I may be wrong, and brutally corrected by someone more experienced, but unless you're buying second hand quality items you'll end up with a build the same or possibly worse than a meepo but have no support or warranty.

I agree. I would just buy a china board if you are hard on the $420. The only one I would suggest is the Verreal VS1. There are 3 price options based on battery range. Check them out.

Yea, what other people said.

Not to mention with a home made build you will spend more time building and fixing than actual riding.

Comment by @mmaner just yesterday 
 "For an extreme budget build get the eBay ESC Single, a sensorless 200+kv 6364 motor, run a 6s battery pack with x2 3s 5000mah Lipos (at least 30c), XT90s loop key, caliber 2 trucks, flywheel clones and a budget/used deck. I’ve build this deck 3 or 4 times and its usually under 400 bucks US."

At least with these you have warranty and bolt on without modification, so no extra tools required. Then get an used deck somewhere

 Almost everything from @dickyho
And with this kit you'll probably have money for Sanyo 8ah battery from these Chinese boards.

What kind of tools do you already own? Tools cost a lot more than you think, usually costing equal or more than the cost of parts if you don't have any on hand

Please have a look through my build thead, I’m also an aussie so it might help with where to buy.

I would recommend build no 2 for you on that budget, and instead of the round trucks I used, get some HobbyKing trucks/mount. Some 97mm wheels are also a nice upgrade from Chinese 83s

Skunk, I did acknowledge that "someone reccomended a motor similar" to whom I was referring. His links also cost more due the brand of parts. Might cost $35USD on amazon but for me to get them here in Aus they cost me $60 usd

@Superflim i looked over everything. i saw how all the boards have same specs and some info overlaps and da english is what it is. im praying 30q batteries which im pretty sure china has on lock now. they advertising hella range so i bet it is what they say it is just hella cheap. but for 239 i think its worth the risk. and of course i paid with paypal!

when you say spam, do you mean scam or someone just spamming their product?

I agree. But for $240 and using PayPal I don't think you can loose anything. PayPal's buyer protection does not cover if you buy motorized vehicles. I think that means if the product is really shitty you don't get your money back but if you never received the product you do. I'll call them tomorrow and ask them.

I spent some time on alibaba and found a board almost identical for $240. Alibaba is full of electric skateboards for around $240 so the price seems legit I guess?

I wouldn't count on it too much. If you receive your board and it's got issues or its specs don't match what was advertised, I don't think Paypal will help. Even if you don't receive it at all, Paypal might refuse to cover it as "Motorised vehicles (of any kind)" are [not included](https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/paypal-safety-and-security) in their Buyer protection. I stopped trusting paypal when, after hundreds of successful transaction over 15 years, I only once needed to raise a claim as I did not receive my item from Gearbest and they took their side.

Contact from them is all fine and dandy but when it comes down to it the terms say vehicles are not covered. 

When it comes to crunch and you need to get your money back I'd bet my truncated consumer protection that PayPal will shaft you.
