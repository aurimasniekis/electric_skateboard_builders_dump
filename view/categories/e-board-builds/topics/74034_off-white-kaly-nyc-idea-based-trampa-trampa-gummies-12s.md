Well well well, this is my 4th build already this year? Better call me Mr build it all soon.

Always been crazy about the idea of a Kaly.Nyc, but never really liked Trampa or most Trampa builds but Kaly.Nyc has really grown on me.

I always used Streetboards, in hope that it would be whats legal one day but looking at how things are now I may as well just make a "Trampa" and not care about it being legal or not since nothing will be the looks of it.

My goal with this build is not to make a board that can be ridden anywhere, or have an insane range but rather just a freaking sexy board with lots of power and an amazing riding comfort. 

First time dealing with Trampa parts so don't judge!

Parts list:
Trampa Superstar Hub, White gloss with Black Spokes + 125mm Gummies.
Trampa Infinity Baseplate, Trampa Vertigo Truck.
Trampa Carver Deck 14Ply.
Eboosted Trampa Enclosure Trampa Carver.
2x Idea Trampa Spring Series Mounts.
2x Idea 60T Superstar Pulley.
2x Idea 15T Motor Pulley.
2x Enertion FocBox.
Firefly Remote.
Flipsky 190KV 6354.
12S4P Samsung 30Q.


To do list:
Mount enclosure.
Make battery.
Config Vesc.
Cut Griptape.

Those would work with a Eboosted Enclosure? That's what I'm worried about.

The added bulk by the plastic would make it not fit or a very right fit.

Idk really, just tossing ideas on the table.
Why not commission a battery pack from EU ? Just specify the p count and you can solder series connections by yourself.

Added expense, For this to be possible I have to use almost no money for other people to do work for me.

Paying 150 - 200 Euro for someone to ship and spotweld some welds for me would make it a bit harder for me to complete this on time.

Also, I would love to be able to upgrade on it myself in the future, if I can make a pack without spot-welding now I can just take out the cells later and get some that are better by just swapping.

If you wanna save cash, why dont you get the mounts and pulleys straight from trampa?

they cheaper than unik

I really dont like their mounts, im not a fan of those bulky big mounts.

Also the pulleys they have dont work with the other mounts, without using spacers and stuff that makes it looks pretty bad.

If i can find a solution without a spot welder for the battery i can get everything with money to spare, but i dont wanna put out 150 - 200 euro for someone to spotweld me some packs when a decent spotwelder can be bought in China for like 100 euro i can bring back with me.

How are these bulky?

265 euro for motor mounts and pulleys is a solid 100 euro saving compared to Unik

Also uniks set would be around 241 gbp, then 10 euro shipping or 15 i have a local place where i will get the belts so those are cheap.

Yep, its just i really dont wanna pay someone for work i can do myself.

I can just next time i go to China pay 600RMB (76euro)  for a SUNKKO 787A+ bring it with me back home and sell it again for the same price if i wanted to weld.

The nickel strips and fishpaper over in China is also almost nothing for what they use on prebuilt packs, but yeah.

So currently looking at my options on spotweld packs i can sort myself, for future upgrading.

But im looking at the ones Grozniy wrote and see what may fit.

Yep, they are great made a build with their parts a while ago and had their Caliber mounts as well super good stuff.

Also more or less exactly what i wanted, but the other ones looks great as well but minimal saving and i would have to paint them black since im going for a black on black with white rims.

BTW do the trampa short carver trucks use the same base plate as the longer 16" trucks?

you could sent them for anodizing instead of painting.

Yep, i can also do anodizing but its around 15 euro more then paiting.

i have access to a car body paint shop and got some paint gear myself, so can do it really cheap and make it look really good.

And yeah, i guess the others would come out at 160 incl shipping, so its 9 less then unik and no matter what im going for their pulley for the gummies so may as well just go with the mount since it works well together.

If you do not need a crossbar and idlers, v7.0 is cheaper by 1/3 price from v7.2
Version 7.0 can be equipped with idlers

I would need a 14/44 so that i may have to resort to Uniks or Trampa, that would work with your mounts correct?

Or would you say 60T would work with gummies? (125MM Size)

I dont need the idler, just the mount itself.

The 60t pulley fits 125mm gummies

The outer diameter of the 60t pulley is 95,5mm

You do not need to buy a set, you can buy pulleys from someone else

Its to keep everything at one place and make sure i wont have to sit down and file things to make them fit together im a bit tired of that :P 

But thats 25mm spare that should be alright i think since its just for roads and it would mean it would also work fine for up to 6.5" wheels.


But 15t and 60t 2x + the mounts and if you have belts that fits this kind of setup? With or without idlers thats just up to you if you have belts or know what would fit with idlers and not without.

That would be 100+110 or so right?

## \#45 Posted by: Idea Posted at: 2018-11-10T22:20:10.251Z Reads: 188

Yes, this set works fine with 6.5-inch wheels, I have the same in my board

I have belts of different lengths, the price of a set of pulleys also includes belts

The prices are correct, but you must add shipping costs
100+110+16

If you want to buy the whole set from me, it also suggests you buy a idlers

Using the idlers you will have more effective braking, in addition, the belts can be loose, which reduces  the resistance of the belt transmission.

Off White, why? Colors are white and black.

I like the brand, and the logo is easy to cut in griptape so win win!

Will be placed like Kaly Does, and ehm now i need to add more white details.

Also! Soon done, doing a decent amount of work on it atm when i get the enclosure i can get the last done and out on the road!

Got a bit done yesterday.

Wires now going into the trucks, single wire motor system basicly done no clue what to do with the sensors so ill just leave them as is and tape them down.

Just need to sort the vesc wires out for power then antispark and get the cells welded and put in and the inserts and bolts then i can ride.

How is the build in general? My friend is a big off white fan so I'd love to share this build with him when it's done :slight_smile:

I sadly never got to finish it due to some issues with battery space and stuff so sold it off, but I'm currently in progress of building a V2 of this but ever so slightly different
