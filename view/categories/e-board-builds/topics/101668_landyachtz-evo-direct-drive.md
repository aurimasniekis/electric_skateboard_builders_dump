how much clearance to you have from the enclosure to ground?
The Evo drops quite a bit

I have also an EVO with a 12S4P battery.

Clearance is enough. Just need bigger wheels for the direct drives.

Thats it isnt it this is going to be my street carver and abec 107 or TB 110's largest I will go. I was going to use my esk8europe.eu enclosure the same one they use on their evo board "beast" but its 55mm deep fits the 26650 cells with room to spare, only other enclosure I have that fits them is a amazon DIYE enclosure 30mm test fit with wheels not a lot of clearance, 26650s have to go. I will order some 35E cells and grab a streamlined enclosure, i dont want to negate the drop with lifters or massive wheels.

I would love to know how dkp work out on an Evo.   I can not imagine how the split angles will affect the ride.  I'm thinking it may try to kill you.

Been experimenting with split angles with my superspud but the evo intoduces a forced split angle not sure how its going to go at high speeds. Took it for a gravity only ride i live in a very hilly part of the Gold Coast. Rolls super smooth no belt drag only a slight drag from magnets. Carving is awesome I popped on some evolve green bushings. Loving the low centre of grav..thought I would be riding it this weekend : sad face emoji : foot breaking on such a heavy board nearly took my foot off.

Nope I havent takes back what little dignity I have..Lucky I ordered 20 2oz 4P pcbs last week. Have time now to get a bestech charge only anyone in oz want to swap a 10S CO bestech for a 12S CO bestech or cash please DM me. The dickyho waterproof bms looks ok but too thick for new enclosure and only use 8 awg its a s##t to solder and overkill.

I am a long time rider of Evo's bro and yes that can be the case when first looking at the deck lmfao.

Have you seen my evo ride?

It has a wide front area and this will give you good carve ability while the split angles make it stable with 50' rkp trucks.  Mine is twitchy with the front foot at over 60 k's so fuck knows what it would be like with dkps

Maybe tkp the rear and dkp the front.  Rear solidity will give you nice solid acceleration while still allowing the front to turn for carving.  Just be careful at anything over 40 k's

I thought they were rated at 10amp constant 40 is heaps for my needs. Especially if I go 12S4p the evo is a long deck even 10S5P should be possible. Maybe I should look at what the various enclosures hold. Leaning towards 12S only because I have a few bestech 12S charge only BMS. I am hoping the stormesk8 wheels will take 6" tubes and tires with modification. They will likely end up on my at build.

I ended up scoring 20 x Aldi drill Batteries 18V 4amp super cheap originally to build a diy powerwall. But found they had samsung high current cells inside. Rated at 20amps each but only 2000mah so I decided to make a few 80amp 12S 8000Mah sprint packs and one double layer 13S5P monster I have a few 12S bestech leftover. What kind of enlosure did you use on your evo?

Minor update new cells arrived been riding it with the 26650 nursing it everywhere because of  27mm of clearance, 26650 are very punchy.
Just waiting on @psychotiller enclosure and stormesk8 airless at wheels.

Its super carvey and love the deck its my new fav also received a moose brand evo copy yesterday i ordered when it looked like i wasn't going to find a evo falcon. Apart from the tail angle and narrower and no taper its a good copy. Might add a carbon fibre layer to reinforce it.

Big evolve group night ride on the 26th October. Halloween. Ride costome ordered board will be ready. will fit lights ftom my other board.

Looks like its a doa anyway f##kin evolve quality control. While I sort out the enclosure shenanigans psychotiller still isnt respond to email. I am going to finishing a stalled AT build made with leftovers. 2 x 6354 one flipsky one torqueboard (same motor) flipsky6.6 dual with busted antispark surprise surprise. Old esk8europe enclosure to deep for anything but at build. Its studded with ws8212b rgb leds running off a microcontroller esp8266 that commincates with vesc to vary the speed bases on board speed and red for break. Battery i will use the torch battery pack 10S3P 26650 l![hdr_00005_1|670x500](upload://ldUMzdfSt4YV7ZiL5KyM1dwrKm3.jpeg)

I am a bit premature with the AT build I have a dead Evolve GT coming, I found on gumtree I picked up dirt cheap with AT wheels. i will ditch the evolve 50mm and transfer the 63mm to evolve trucks and AT via some. Rest of the GT i will test and keep for parts. I am not a fan of the yumcha 6" wheels they are unbalanced and dont take regular 608 bearings.

My wifes new GT one is having the infamous R2 remote cut out issues. Turn it on works a few secs when you go to accelerate dead.no life from vesc. Voltage is 41.7 tested via charging port. Might be firmware mismatch. This was the GT one on the wall in HQ showroom the remote is much newer judging fw version. They will likely have to swap 1/2 the skateboard to fix it. I could fix it but that's what's warranty is for. Might try the r2 from the dead evolve likely older fw.

No sign of the Psychotiller enclosure but pressing forward with my temp enclosure will grab a eboosted enclosure soon. The sony VTC6 12S4P fits but its going to be too tight for a unity or 6.6 plus (old version) and no room for 12v buck conveter so opting for a 4amp 5v buck i have tons of them. This will drive the speed sensative neopixel strips and headlights and brake lights. Metr pro is also here. The 26650 battery is taken out now and enclosure sit flush with deck saving precious mm of clearance. I really hate these wheels Kenna sent me, i have done less than 10Km and already showing heaps of wear.![hdr_00006_1|670x500](upload://hSjCgbw7V1ufoLjaAq1qhrhCgQs.jpeg)

Diagnoses rubbing between cells weakened the 2 layers of Kapton tape causing a short. The voice of longhairboy in my head "it will catch fire!". In light of this I am repacking my sony pack with barley paper and shrinking each side separately.

Its a hard leason learned i can remember me electronic engineering lecturer saying dont cut corners. I knew better. I am just glad my 5 year old was asleep inside and not glued to my side when working on boards. Well my $70 ebay pack was a partial success, but my shoddy work was its undoing if i had left cell protection on the cells it might have lived another day. It was destined for my diy powerwall for my shed. now its going to battery waste station.

Glad you got it sorted.   My wife has just begun her esk8 journey on one of my builds and every single time she goes out I pray something doesn't go wrong.  I would rather put her in my hands though than any pre built. ( not a dig)  I know that whats in there works and save a random event she will be safe.   Not sure she has exceeded 10 mph yet so give it time.  Your esk8 mettle is only tested once you have tasted concrete at a fundamental level.

Sally from stormesk8 got back to me about the airless kegal mount wheels. Looks like a batch is about to ship. Ownboard have them but stormesk8 were cheaper $120 shipped for a set. VS $150 + postage from ownboard. ownboard do evolve truck clones (they buy from storm) and I have ordered some evolve styles 63mm motor mounts $55 a set. And some of their evolve compatible pressfit pulleys $30 a set.![Screenshot_2019-10-17-20-21-35|250x500](upload://lJxpsVMRpLzLfGY98dtATWqHsgS.png)

Will do. Do you ever get the felling you are cursed this week had a battery blow up,  my kweld has developed a fault and now the flipsky 4.2 plus has a major fault only one side is not powering up.voltage on the 3.3v line on one side is 1.9v. Went to email barbara at fs and glanced at the warranty for vesc is 2 months. What the actual f##k flipsky. Missed it by one month. The 12S battery was too much for the bec\buck. Going to shoehorn in a FS 6.6 dual or maybe 2 focbox. I will attempt a repair i thing the drv8302 acts as a bec so likely the issue or one of the passives.7

Realising I didnt buy it from flipshite but from hglrc.com and they have 6 months warranty. A tip next time you need to order a vesc. Hglrc are usually cheaper (except during sales) charge les for shipping and if your an aussie dont charge GST. Warranty is longer and they make the controllers and vesc for flipshite.

Small update
board has a name Kraken
Because under maritime legend ships with names of sea monsters were doomed to be unlucky.
and this tub is super unlucky.
Latest issue my 6.6 Plus died while programming
Flipshite antispark switch the GND not VCC
and with the GND connected via USB, as I switched off after a firmware update the antispark let out its magic smoke. all because I misplaced my bluetooth module.

I just ordered a eboosted enclosure last night and Psychotiller just shipped this morning, happy but looks like I have 2 enclosures coming now..
Ordered a makerX vesc - I am sick of Flipshites $300 fuses I have had bandaids that have lasted longer.
Looks like I will miss the evolve ride this weekend I have killed all my dual vesc and I have no chance of fitting 2 singles in. Sad Face emoji

Repaired the flipshite 6.6 plus - bypassed their shitetastic antispark switch. never ordering another of their products with this self destructing feature.  note I will desolder the fets and use copper braid for perm fix. Part of the issue was FS also use different pinouts for their 3 pin switch that or the printing on pcb is incorrect likely both. Will use a dependable loopkey may migrate to one of my home made AS switch.

Thats a worry an why I went for 12S to sqeeze as much torque out of these chinese wonders. I wont be taking it offoard just a few park rides. Maybe some walking trails.
Next build is definately going to be 4x4 but I am thinking 4x 6354 I already have these and have a second evolve rear truck on order.![15719556758255240201853249278693|666x500](upload://5s4XafCMDNTKq5WmFxy6UxZZEUl.jpeg)

Rebuilt the flipsky 6.6 buttoned up with the new batteries time to update firmware there was something in the back of my mind about 6.6 with A/S bypassed and firmware updates. F##k after you do a firmware update the vesc reboots and writes the firmware well it would if it wassnt hotwired in on position. The trick was to disrupt the power after the flash just enough to cause a reboot. Power off roverts to old firmware. After 2 hours I got it. The work around us to also bridge the switch as well but all of the AS has already been removed. Missed the evolve group ride but had a solo ride anyway. 12S is way more punchy than 10s. Speed is awesome. Didnt get it up to its 75Km/hr that cant be right vx2?

Will see how they handle some major rpm on the bench before i put them on my board. Tappering may mean a valve hole maybe hard.
