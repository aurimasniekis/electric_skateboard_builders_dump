I've been lurking in the forums for a while, reading and gaining knowledge into this whole esk8 thing. Having owned an evolve carbon GT I got a bit fed up with some of its short comings, so I started work on my own build with the assistance of some mates.

I wanted a board that I could get around with and climb any hills with my big ass on it, so I really wanted 4WD. This thing is gonna be all blacked out, wheels, trucks, deck, everything.

A rundown of the specs:

+ 5 Layer Maple Deck Sandwiched with 4 layers of carbon.
+ 4WD Hub Motors - 90kv, sensored and 90mm wheels (custom made)
+ VESC
+ 10S4P LG-HG2 Pack with custom BMS
+ G2TB Remote (The mini one)
+ Caliber II Trucks.
+ SLA 3D Printed housing, with seal for water resistance.

I think that's about it that's going into it. Work has commenced. Here's a pic of the hubs my friend made for me, he's a rocket scientist or something, not really sure what he does, haha. They fit onto standard trucks, so you don't need to modify anything which is super handy to speed up my build.

I'll document as I go through this process. Wish me luck!

[/quote]

looks awesome! but I really think you need a bigger/more powerful battery.
4p hg2 can do about 60/80A which is only 15A to each motor.
I'm sure it will still work, but this battery is going be a limiting factor.

Battery isn't final as of yet, so may need to change this depending on how much draw these motors need.

Sick build. I've had a friend or two build 4wd hub motors boards and the packs I've built for them was a 12s6p stacked. So orientation is (2) 12s3p packs on top of each other

You'll need a high parallel count for amps drawn.

[/quote]

OK< not arguing that point...but, if you take care of your li-ion packs (visual inspection, check each cell group voltage, check resistance, etc) you are not doing anymore work with a lipo.  Arguably, you are doing less as you can tell the voltage of each cell with a hobby charger.  Plus you get better AMP delivery that with a lion pack, on average.  

I'm not saying lipos are better than li-ion, Im just saying they are good and scaring people with "explosive" talk may be a bit irresponsible.  Lipos are easy and have great AMP delivery, way better than the majority of li-ion packs.  Li-ion packs are pretty maintenance free, for a time, and perform pretty well but they are more expensive than lipos.

No worries.  I have tried a BMS with lipos.  It works well.  That being said, my current lipo pack is 6s so I just use a balance charger.  I am also running a Samsung 25r 10s3p pack a 30q 10s3p pack on the way.  So I use both, I just dont want to see someone get the wrong idea bout lipos, they CAN be pretty awesome.  They just require visual inspection and balance charging, but I do that ( and recommend everyone to) to my li-ion packs too.

That is the best method for charging lipos because individual cells become unbalanced after a few discharges at these higher currents.

A few changes made this week, mainly around the battery and the deck. The battery is going to be 8S6P using the Panasonic NCR20700B which should give more than enough juice to push the 4 hubs up hills. My crazy friend said it should be able to do like 180 amps or something crazy.

The deck is also slightly changed with now two layers of 3mm vertically laminated (I don't even know what this means but he said its strong) bamboo sandwiched between two layers of carbon and then carbon top and bottom to give it a sexy look.

I've got some renderings my friend sent me and he's making the deck for me at the moment. It's boss! Super pumped to finish this so i can replace my evolve that keeps trying to kill me daily.

The speed should be plenty fast, around 35km/hr, I want range and torque :)
```

---
## \#29 Posted by: Maxid Posted at: 2017-04-07T08:41:59.824Z Reads: 702

```
your range will not increase just because you went parallel instead of series. Your total energy will stay the same. Torque will not be a problem either way as the 20700 have low voltage sag just like the 30Q. Actually torque will probably be even better at say 10S as you can adjust your gearing for the same top speed as 8S.

I just want to be able to go long distance. These batteries have a tonne of power in them, which means I can go for long distances without charging. That's my main goal with this build, to be able to go the distance at a safe and comfortable speed, but also climb any hill :slight_smile:
```

---
## \#31 Posted by: Maxid Posted at: 2017-04-07T08:54:00.400Z Reads: 688

```
? I just explained to you that distance will not be affected by rearranging your cells to a 10S config. The total energy in your pack is what matters and a s long as the same number of cells is used nothing changes.
8*6 = 48 and 10x5=50 --> you'd have even more range in a quite similar 10S pack as you can fit two additional cells. You could also go 12x4=48 and have 12S and exactly the same energy in your pack as in your initial 8S6P with the added benefit of a more efficient drive train, higher top speed/same top speed but lower gearing for higher torque.

I'm no battery expert by any means, alls i'm saying is what I wanted to go for, I don't want the board to be too crazy fast, thats why i've kept it to around 35km/hr.

I just now realized you are using Hub motors and no belt setup - the gearing argument is then obviously flawed. You will also have a hard time changing your kv so adjusting the voltage is obviously the only way then.
8S6P will give you almost 700Wh - that will keep you going for around 50Km - wow

Your argument is correct about voltage regardless of direct drive or geared drive. 
I have tested this theory by taking 2 6s/ 5000 Lipo packs and running them in series first for 12s/5000 and then running them in parallel for 6s/10000
Both yielded the same range and the 12s setup yielded what felt like double the torque and speed. 
6s was good for cruising the boardwalk at 10 mph but for hill climbing, higher voltage is king.

No, I didn't change anything except the voltage.
Running dual motors 230KV with TB 12s 120a ESC's
16/36 gears 90mm wheels
I also ran dual 145kv Carvon motors on 12s.
Frankly I don"t know if 8s would provide enough torque for hub motors.
Even at 12s my 145kv direct drives had trouble going up hills over 10% grade
It might be ok on flat ground.

The calculations on this stuff are usually just a guesstimate.
Actual experience is what we are pulling our info from.
And if anything, 4wd will probably need more battery.
But if it does rock on 8s, we would love to hear about it.

Some more updates! Part of the deck has been pressed, and it's being sliced up. After the shaping the carbon fibre will be laminated and fused to the bamboo. Can't seem to upload a video, so here's a still from the video my friend sent me.

But how does that stop it spinning on the shaft? Hubs need to be secured to the truck and the outside spins with the thane. Some hubs are mechanically fastened with pins, some glued. Others have a square boss to fit onto specific trucks. Interested to know how the diy bloke in the street can accomplish this on their own?

There's one bearing on the outside where the locking nut connects. There is no bearing on the motor housing where the C is, this ensures when it spins that only the outside of the motor spins.

It doesn't mount to any truck like all the hub makers are going for, but it is, in my opinion the only guaranteed way of making sure the hubs stay secure during any environmental conditions we throw at them.

I like the idea of a universal hub motor that can be user installed on a wide variety of trucks.
The thing that concerns me about any hub motor besides heat, is that fact that all of the road shock is being absorbed by the motor bearings. Therefore, any hub motor needs to be designed so that the motor bearings can be easily replaced preferably by the end user.

See here. This is the inside where it presses against the truck axle. The area where the motor goes into the axle is fixed and comes to a point to secure it, only the bigger bearing on the inside actually spins and the smaller bearing on the front side. This ensures the motor freely spins as it should.

What I would do:
These already fit to caliber trucks without modification. So why not use something like a key to fit it next to the cable (or let the cable run through the key). So that the key will fit to the flat part of the caliber hanger. Not a huge modification and it will really be safe that way!

You break 3mm screws on YOUR hubs, these are designed differently, so why class them as the same? I know we are all cautious of hubs since there has been so many issues. Friends close to me have had problems with hubs but that doesn't mean there can't be a great solution that hasn't been put in the esk8 context. I think I have been more than helpful to satisfy peoples concerns, the creator behind them has provided pictures and video to try to explain how they work. If there is a guarantee that they work, why don't you try and fault them?

These hub motors look really promising to me and have a cool design, to fit on our standard Calibers without modification.
But people on here tested nearly every hub motor available, and so far there was not a single design, that lasted without modification (I think carvon are the only one, but they are not real hubs, more directdrive). Some of them work well under normal conditions, but if you take it a bit further (hitting some hills/going 50km/h), you´ll see the problems occur.

So please don´t feel attacked if people start giving some advice.

My advice is to shape that inner piece in a D-shape to fit Calibers and I´m sure it will last longer and people would order more! (I would test a pair too!)

You and the inventor have answered questions with answers that have not satisfied people. The way things have been explained so far with the current understanding of hubs and the forces exerted they can not work long term. Perhaps it is our understanding, perhaps your explanation.

i know at least one design that hasn't had a mechanical failure for a single one that was put together by the seller.  :innocent:

with this design, why not add an adapter for different trucks as said so at least you'll possibly have a tight slide fit instead of a loose connection which is sure to eat the hanger aluminum with acceleration and braking really quickly.   One moment you say they're almost finished and you will have some rubber and the next you say the design is great and will last.  how bout some testing between.

not that I have anything for sale either but have to get my cents in with all this hub motor talk

When considering the forces we put these motors through, I can see why some are dubious about them not having sufficient holding strength. My view is that if these are engineered with the right tolerances (which they certainly appear to be) this is the answer I've been looking for. Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best.

I've already messaged the guy and have put my hand up to be one of the first ones of the production line. I will certainly report back as soon as I have one in hand! Although it looks like this Black Beauty might be the first horse out of the gate.

Its much regret that I make this post.  Particularly since I am new and are already making a negative post!  Today is 14 June.  After ordering 1 May when the items were "in stock" my order remains unshipped. 

Herewith a summary of broken promises:

1 May - order placed - It sin stock and shipped by fedex. Delivcery expected in two days. Yeah right!

8 May - after 7 days and no shipping, i contact them -  "we're waiting on more motors, expecting to be this week.... I will get our team onto this" - But they were in stock, huh? Anyhow, I never heard back!

22 May - 21 days and no shipping - "ETA is meant to be this week. I can update you in a couple of days." - I never heard back!

2 June - "I broke my leg....I believe your stuff should be in stock now. I'll find out why it hasn't shipped if it hasn't.  Monday I promise I'll come back to you." - never heard back

12 June -  5 weeks after order "Hi. Apologies for the delay. We just received more stock today. You order will be shipped out in the next 24 hours" - never heard back

Today "As mentioned we ran out of stock when you ordered. These things unfortunately take time to make....Our stock arrived this week" - Actually you told me it had arrived, it either has or it has not

Today - I will come an collect "We don't offer collection sorry.....I would prefer if you cancelled your order"

---Rant Start---

esk8hub, why so many lies, just do what you promise!!!  When you screw up, OWN IT.  Dont lie or BS people.  The maker community is made up of understanding people. I hope I am an understanding person. I get it, retail sucks, customers are a PITA, I am a PITA. Its not that you did not ship, its that you continued to treat your customer as a mug. It swings both ways asshole!  -

I will post an update when I actually receive the cash refund!

Thought I'd chime in here. This is not a scam. As with anything there can be unforeseen delays. When this guy ordered we had just run out of stock. Our shopify site wasn't setup for stock tracking so it didn't put the items out of stock. We didn't anticipate the number of people wanting our hubs. 

We explained that we had run out of stock and there would be a delay in getting more motors made. It takes time to make more. 

Fast forward I had to goto shenzen to fix an issue with the urethane which caused some more delays for the motors. In the meantime I broke my leg and had to undergo surgery to put 10 screws and a titanium plate in my leg. 

Each time we have offered this guy a refund but he opted to continue to wait.

Can anyone show some evidence of these hubs working on a board with a rider on it? 
If you ran out of stock there must be quite a few being used?

We had a very small amount of stock initially around 30 sets. We have been speaking to other customers who have them and have been riding them. 

We just received some more stock this week which were shipping out and we have another 100 sets of hubs on the way. 

Not sure everyone who has bought is active on the forums. Regardless we're not here to scam anyone.

@Esk8hubs - good to have you  on this thread and be publicly accountable, good and bad. Previously, some other 'parties' were promoting virtues of your products. 

This is my final post on this matter.  I hope your products live up to their promise. 

Yes,  I was offered refund on more than one occasion. I declined until today as I no longer believed any statements made by the vendor.   I was also offered discounts for my inconvenience,  I declined any discount as I paid for the products at that price and did not want to take advantage of the situation. 

To be clear,  you don't have to steal someone's money to be scam.  You just need to be materially dishonest in your dealings. 

It is interesting to note that you had 27 items in stock.  Yet you continued to take orders in full knowledge of this fact. 

"we had over 100 orders for hubs in the last week alone"

For those not aware,  it generally takes around 1 month to make a batch of brusheless motors.  Other than the initial stock,  you continued to take orders and then proceeded to make multiple false statements to me regarding availability.  You clearly knew there was no stock arriving.  

I am sorry about your leg,  it does sound incredibly painful.  I am curious what the rest of your team is doing to help you in your time of need  "i'll get our team onto this" . Since they never appeared to step up when you  were in hospital,  it is quite clear that their is no team.   I stupid thing is that I don't care if there is no team, but why make these patently misleading statements.  If there is a team, well,   I suggest you find somewhere else to work!

Let this be a lesson. All you needed to do is make one post on this thread stating you over sold and when new stock was expected. An update post closer to the time to confirm. It's that easy. I would never even have msg you.  

This us my final post on this matter, I have said my keep.  I genuinely hope you get your act together as the motors look pretty good IMO.  

Cheers
Bolts

Just thought I might pitch in on my view here. I've ordered a pair of these hubs as well and have been informed that I will receive them towards the end of this month, I'm fine waiting as there aren't a lot of choices for hubs atm and believe these will be worth it.
On another note there has been occasions where I have waited an extra 2-3 months past expected date for parts from Enertion such as the vesc-x and nano-x, each time I asked for an eta I was given a vague answer. Once I even got an answer saying they were going to be shipped on the 14th of the month when it was the 25th! So it not uncommon for parts to take a little longer than expected in the esk8 community. 
Also if you look at the title of this forum it is "The Black Beauty 4WD Hub Build" not "Esk8hubs". The forum was created to document the process of the build. At the time of writing this Esk8hubs account was created 3 hours ago. From that I'm guessing he wasn't expecting to get such reception putting his products up.

Update on the board. A logo has been decided upon and has been laser etched on! At the last second my friend decided to change up the look of the board and makeup. It is now a composite bamboo fibre deck as the carbon deck was too stiff.  It measures 42 inches and has a double kick.

Well if you used watt control then then the duty cycle is taken into account. Could be that these motors are bad to detect the correct duty cylce. And at braking there is no difference. So i really think something was wrong in your settings.

I'll review and compare them against my out runner board and possibly a bamboo GT if I can track one down. He just put the board together today and said "It's crazy fast, If you stand level and give it full throttle it'll actually lift the front wheels off the ground!" 
looking forward to this.. weather permitting expect a comparison video by Friday

Fast and acceleration are two different things though ;) Hubs on a 8S system should not be fast - if they are then the kv should have been lowered in the first place - my personal opinion.

Hi All,

I can completely understand how it seems on the surface, but we're definitely not here to try and scam or ripoff anyone by any means. Our communication may have slipped for some customers, and for that we apologise. Making hub motors is a complicated process and we've run into a number of hitches making them at scale and ensuring they maintain our strict quality control.

Some of the issues have arisen around urethane not being up to standard and lasting the distance. We've experienced some issues with the urethane slipping in some cases, and also cracking under stress, not something we'd like to give to customers and potentially have them hurt themselves.

We're working around the clock to rectify the situation, please bare with us. If anyone who has ordered and doesn't want to wait, we're more than happy to refund anyone who contacts us and @Cisphyx has already been refunded at his request.

Regarding the motors themselves, here's a little bit of technical information for anyone who is interested:

**Winding thickness**: 34T
**Stator size:** D49.3*35mm  t=0.35
**KV**: 95KV
**Power in Watts:** 1500W（@42V)

Regarding the bearings internally 6805ZZ(D=37,d=25,W=7) (NSK) and 6806ZZ, D=42, d=30, W=7(NMB).

Please do let me know if there's any other questions I can answer, more than happy to.
```

I really wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt but you have repeatedly told lies and half truths. If you are honestly having issues trying to put these together, that is completely fine, but your sketchy lies do not instill confidence that this is the case. 

I requested a refund on July 21st. After receiving no response, I again requested a refund on July 25th, at which point you told me it had been done. On August 3rd I requested proof that the refund was actually in process or I was going to dispute the transaction, and made the post here. At that point you finally submitted the refund and got the process going. So "we're more than happy to refund anyone" is questionable, as it took multiple requests and calling you out on lies to actually get it done. I'd like to think you just forgot about it, but why would you email me that it had been done when you hadn't actually done it? Were you hoping I would just forget about it?
