First phase of the project is about to begin. Been searching for parts and builds and finally got it together. Only thing I have to build wifeys before I build mine or I will never get any peace. Plus ‚ûï I will get a chance to practice on hers before I go full force on mine. Lol

Just to note, you can't do series with this because the motor you have is rated up to 10s. I would also recommend getting new motors anyways because those are 370kv, which is FAR too much for our application.

I believe Enertion's wheels are translucent. Don't dig that type of blue. I like the solid baby/sky blues. But I thought they were available in 90-93 or 97mm only. I'm ok with 83mm. For now at least.

Great setup and appreciate all the pics.  It's awesome your wife is into e-sk8!  Totally makes it easier to go ride more and i get my GF out infrequently though she does ride a bit.  (A bit = about 7-8mph tops, so i lap her... often)

I saw someone ask earlier and didn't see a response - where did you get your motor gears?  They look to be aluminum and 12-15mm wide?  

Nice project and will continue to follow!  Keep it up!

Like Link said the wheel touches the deck while steering and locks the inner wheel in a turn. Very bad because that's where your weight is and the skateboard makes a sudden stop and throws you of.
Try it first without rolling and simulate the lean in a turn to check for clearance.
This problem occurs due to large wheels.
I think you have to add some rise pads between the trucks and the deck too.
Unexpected wheelbite is a crash guarantee!

I know for a fact that with both 180 paris and caliber trucks with 83 mm wheels you will give you wheel bite. I know this from experience cause I had this setup on one of my skatedecks to pratice ollieing on the bigger wheels. Also be careful when near curbs cause if one of the protruding wheels rubs up against a curb u will fall off. I too know this from experience. Made me want to get wheel shields lol XD

I was kinda joking but they really are a cool! They will completely eliminate wheel bite and my problem where I rubbed up against a curb (also to be fair a was avoiding a car so I wasnt looking where I was going). As stated on their website they only work with 80 mm wheels and smaller. http://wheelshields.com/products/wheel-shields-metal

PARALLEL = DANGEROUS. @XvDarkVAngelvX parallel chargers ruined a set of my lipos. They don't balance the cells effectively because it reads 2 cells, finds the average, and charges based on that. Get a series charging adapter and then cut the innermost red wire (I ruined another set by not cutting the red wire). The reason we cut the wire is because if not, then the + and - wires cause a short and you'll get that not-so-beautiful black smoke.

love the coat hangers used as 3rd hands!  Saw the first picture and was "wtf?"... then them used to hold the wires for soldering - genius!

The advantage of the $5 3rd hand helper things - the weighted base.  Really makes a difference.

I parallel charge all the time - no issues here.  It would be safer to charge each cell individually with that logic...  While true i'm willing to charge them more quickly.

That makes no sense. @lowGuido can you help out here - i remember you had a diagram showing that cutting the inner wire is meaningless as it is basically the same as connecting the main cables for the series connection.

Flexibility mainly comes from the number of strands of the wire inside. If 2 wires have the same AWG then the wire with more strands is more flexible. Silicone is the material for covering the wire, it's preferred because it is heat resistant and more flexible than, say, plastic.

It just can't be. Physically impossible. The red and black balance wires are just smaller versions of the main cables. It does not matter if you cut or not when you connect them in series. The reason why you had a short was that the order of your balance cables was wrong and did not match the battery configuration.

Edit: you can see it here http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/2X/3/390522341ab49c16a594c814096cc17754b80175.png 
If you switch the left and right balance cables while not switching the main cables you will get your short. The correct order is crucial in a series configuration.

@Maxid I don't have pictures but with all due respect you can't determine that it was my mistake if you weren't there. I know for sure that it wasn't plugged in wrong because i had it zip tied and glued in place. Have never unplugged it at all and its charged other batteries just fine since the accident.

Either way @XvDarkVAngelvX the point is it's a bad idea to charge in parallel. I'm sure there are enough experts around here to help with charging in series. I would recommend cutting the red wire, but it is your choice.

that hook up wire is stiff and hard to work with in my experience. High strand count silicone wire (such as superworm) is slightly more expensive but totally worth it. Its like wet spaghetti and just stuffs in wherever you put it without crimping and being retarded. It also doesn't melt when you're trying to tin the leads, you can practically lay the iron on it and it will barely leave a mark.

Thank you very much. I've ordered a new set of rise pads. There are some on there, but they are very thin. I've ordered some thicker ones. I have a few revisions on that setup. So will post when new attachments aririve. From you and the rest of the forum. I really appreciate the feedback and concerns. Looking for new enclosure and smaller wheels. Will extend wheel base as well. While I take a break on this project for the wife. I will soon begin on my own. I'm ready for my rig.

@Randyc1 - those look almost identical (just plain vs blue or black) as DIYes (@torqueboards) wheel gears.  I just found out he will have both the "regular" 36t (what i've used on a few builds) and a new 40t available for flywheel in 12mm width.  I ran my last set w/ 9mm belts but hope to do 12mm belts on next build using his 40t!

here's his kit w/ both motor and wheel gear, belt, etc. all included:

I love VESC and everything, (I have 3 of them) but I have many super fun builds using HK 150A ESC. so straightforward and simple. no computer hacking involved.
the 2 main reasons I go VESC is because direct nunchuck compatibility (which is worth about $70 alone) and anything over 6S really limits ESC choice.

[quote="evoheyax, post:1, topic:2980"]
About the VESC

This speed controller has the ability to do many things a normal rc speed controller can not. One of those is limiting the amount of amps that come from your battery to your motors. An easy way to burn up a motor is by sending it more amps than it can handle for too long (often while riding up a hill). This means you should never burn up a motor with a vesc (unless you set this limit too high). There's also many other protections that can be set through limits, such as the max temperature you want the vesc to get to (so you can't burn up the speed controller), min and max input voltage (so you can't pull the voltage of your battery under a safe limit, which would brick your battery), and max regenerative break amps (protects battery from having too many amps sent back in to it). So you can protect your entire electronic system from making some of the most common user mistakes by setting these limits correctly.

Yea, but it might dissipate heat better then the default metal.

Why i'd think it does:

* The CF vinyl isn't flat, it has tiny vents. (which you can feel when rubbing over it with your thumb-nail.)

Why I'd think it doesn't:

*  Metal is already a pretty good dissipating heat, probably better then the plastic vinyl.

I do think there are some kind of tapes you can wrap around your motor to dissipate the heat eve better then the default metal casing. We should do some tests with it.
If anyone know if whether this exist or not, please tell me :slight_smile:

Vinyl will insulate not help dissipate motor heat.  If you want to add heatsinks (not likely), or a cooling fan at the end - that airflow would help cool the motor.  Wrapping it will hold in heat, but does look nice!

So far me, @XvDarkVAngelvX and  @jedi are the only texas riders,

And yeah, have her wear a helmet. Texas drivers are atrocious, don't want to see anything bad happen!

Is that the one, where all the guys were riding and his friend behind him hit face ‚òù first with helmet. That was a hell of a spill. No, she hasn't seen it.  But I will üòã show her.

Yes they are. They are the double out of nine kids. As you can see they are ready to üö¥ ride. I'm drawing up a plan for a go-cart with using the rc-tech. I think that would be cool. Or as one would call it an e-cart.
