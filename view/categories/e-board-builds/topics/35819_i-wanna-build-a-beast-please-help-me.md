hello skate builders 
first, please, this is my first project i will be thankful for any help you will give me, if i did not understood something on the web and i'm wrong please teach me. 
i took a trip around the web to found out what i wanna build.
i saw the trampa skateboards, i like it, do you?  first step i want to buy the skateboard.  
what are the difrences between the street carver (15 degrees deck?) and the mountain board (35 degrees deck?) if i want to be able to use two sets of wheels, all terrain or urbanit wheels.
where i can buy it in good price and good condition, and what do you think about new skateboard buy option.

i want to set up rear dual beast motors to get the most massive torque, acceleration and speed how can i choose it?
i think the torque 6374 190kv 3150w are good, what is the best option you can offer

the motor mounts will be the torque mounts, is it fit good with the trampa trucks? or u got better ideas?

next... i need all the rest parts please help me to choose them well
 
any help please:] tnx pro builders

For a good mountain board you will need around $2k (as it stands currently). Most of the price is the battery and Trampa deck..

You'll need a helmet, a battery, a BMS, an ESC, a remote, motor mounts, motors, belts, pulleys, a charger, an enclosure or two, and all the parts need to be compatible with one another

You need 2 trucks and 4 wheels. You only got 1 of each.

to be sure that you don't miss anything on the board, just get the whole set instead of getting it piece by piece.

i would vote for @Nowind 's direct drive

It depends on what you class as beast - motor whise.  the SK3 series from Turngy is the standard go to for outrunner motors.  at the moment, the SK3 192KV motor has the largest possible wattage throughput at just over 4KW. but some people might suggest getting a lower KV motor to increase the torque. but by pure numbers, the 192KV motor is the most powerful.

I'm a fan of li ion because they are safer but lipos are cheaper and work for mountainboards too

The battery needs to be [professionally built](https://longhairedboy.com/collections/all/products/high-powered-electric-skateboard-battery-pack-43v-12s5p-samsung-inr18650-30q) or you need to spend a month or two learning how to do it safely.  Also the [Turnigy Aerodrive SK3](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/power-systems-1/electric-motors/turnigy-sk3/63mm.html) - 6374-192KV motors that @notepad mentioned may be the most powerful but they also have big open ports in the back and aren't sealed so are more subject to debris getting in them if they're mounted real low

Both, I can build with any cell or if the customer has cells they can send them to me

@notepad I remember a few months ago it was listed as 2750W. With a mountain board why not go for the leopard 8072?
