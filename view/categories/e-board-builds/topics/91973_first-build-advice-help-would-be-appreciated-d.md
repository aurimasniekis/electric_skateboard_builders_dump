Hi everyone ! 
So this is gonna be my very first build, I've had this idea for a few years now but I bought a complete on a black friday and after two years with it I think it's time to get serious.

Basically I want something better than what I have which is : 
30-35 km/h top speed
12-15 km range 

I did a lot of research, what I can say is that I dont' want the best of the best in terms of innovation. I want something that works and that looks nice, but without spending more than 1300 euros. if it's less, it's even better !

What I know I want : 

DECK : Landyatchz EVO 40" falcon

WHEELS : 107mm ABEC 11 (already got this)

TRUCKS : 218mm TB or Caliber II

BATTERY : want to build a 12S4P or 12S5P pack from Samsung 30Q

BMS : NEED HELP (a lot of help)

ESC : I'm thinking about getting the FOCBOC unity but I don't really know if it's any better than 2ESC's from Torqueboards

MOTORS : I want 2 motors, because where I live is not flat at all and my actual e-board makes me want way more torque. Plus I weigh approx 90 kg so not really the lightest rider out there.
I'm looking to take a lot of parts from eskating.eu and I don't really know if 2 6355 are enough or if I'll be better using 2 6374.

If anyone has used 107mm on the landyatchz evo with some 180 mm trucks I'd be curious if those people had wheelbite issues... I only saw people using the 218mm trucks

Thank you for reading !  :smiley:

DECK : Landyatchz EVO 40" falcon - **Cant go wrong here - Ask @bigben if he has an enclosure that fits.** 

WHEELS : 107mm ABEC 11 (already got this) - **Cant go wrong here but consider TB110's as well, core is better in my opinion.**

TRUCKS : 218mm TB or Caliber II - **Get TB218's or better yet Surf Rodz, RKP best for Evo**

BATTERY : want to build a 12S4P or 12S5P pack from Samsung 30Q - **If you need help with BMS I would suggest getting the battery built by a professional.**

BMS : NEED HELP (a lot of help) - **as above**

ESC : I’m thinking about getting the FOCBOC unity but I don’t really know if it’s any better than 2ESC’s from Torqueboards - **Get the unity, it's easier for a first time builder and has treated many people very well, including myself x 2**

MOTORS : I want 2 motors, because where I live is not flat at all and my actual e-board makes me want way more torque. Plus I weigh approx 90 kg so not really the lightest rider out there. I’m looking to take a lot of parts from eskating.eu and I don’t really know if 2 6355 are enough or if I’ll be better using 2 6374. - **Not much difference between 6355 and 6374 aside from 74's will not get as hot when you push them. Esakting use maytech motors, can't really go wrong there but perhaps consider other stores in general because their lead times are insane at times.** 

If anyone has used 107mm on the landyatchz evo with some 180 mm trucks I’d be curious if those people had wheelbite issues… I only saw people using the 218mm trucks - **It's not advisable to use narrow trucks in general on a big ol deck. Just created unnecessary fitment issues. That's my 2c.**

Aside from all of that you need to consider pulleys, drivetrain in general and others. Looks like you've done some reading which is good.

For the battery, unless you plan to build like 4 - 6 batteries you're better off buying one. @pjotr47 can help I'm sure. Cost of materials, spot welder, mistakes and all the rest are simply not worth it for one or two batteries. Unless of course you're dead set on learning... then burn some cells my friend, go wild!

Thanks for the fast answer !

I know @bigben has one so i'll see about this in the future
I know but not really willing to spend an additionnal 80 euros for a set of wheels that I already have :confused:

Damn the RKP  trucks look good but the price is reeeeeally too high for me

Any idea of how much it would cost to get a battery built ?

that's what I was thinking, plus it's on sale right now but don't if I'll have the money to take it now

well in europe I saw they had low prices so that's what matters to me (and quality of course)

Think I'll stick to the 218 mm trucks and get the 6374 cause they will fit 

Pulleys : was thinking to use 16t motor and 40t drivetrain to get lots of torque and not going more than 50km/h (it's scary lol)

Well depending on @pjotr47 and the price to build a battery I'll see, but learning isn't really a problem (money is one though so I might consider getting a complete battery built xD )

You can choose two options here:

Quality or compromise - If you buy cheap you buy twice eventually. It sounds like you're building a board to ride and enjoy, not an experiment or beater. 

I was talking about enclosures for Ben, not wheels. I get what you're saying though on 107 vs 110, 107's are fine if you already have them, they are great in fact.

Look for maytech 6374 motors, sealed or unsealed. You can get them from many sources, including directly from Maytech via their store, email or their aliexpress shop. 

Ben's enclosures are cheap as hell (too cheap for the effort he puts in). I'd consider buying a second hand Evo 39" however, they are floating around and amazing decks for half the price of the new 40 falcon. As a matter of fact, I think Ben has a second hand 39" with enclosure for sale right now, perhaps ask?

If you are going to use TB218's I'd get mounts from woosh, (search here) or boardnamics - both inexpensive and work well.

15/40 is a common 107 gear ratio. Steel motor gear, allu pulley gear.

Do yourself a favour and search for Evo builds, bookmark them all, read them all 20 times. Especially @Deckoz master evo and all the clones that came off that (inlcuding my own :smiley: ) - they made all the mistakes and worked out all the hard stuff for you.

Yeah you got it exactly right

Yeah I understood about the enclosures I messed up when writing sorry x)

I was thinking about getting the sealed ones so I don't have to worry about rain and water (saw them on eskating.eu on sale) I'll check on maytech's shop anyway

Oh damn well if he has one I'm definitely interested, @bigben is that true ??

Oh that might be interesting because the ones from TB are very expensive. how do i look for these ? ^^

What do you think about this one ? people say that because it's not metal it makes less noise, but what do I know ^^

Yes that's what I'm trying to do, I've read already few of them but I tought that it was time to open a thread about my build because I had problems to find specific answers on the forum

Also, while we're on the topic. Gears are still relatively new, hardly commercially available right now and will take time to perfect as a consumer item.

You can either jump on the beta bandwagon or wait for perfection. Depends on what you're after here.

Hi everyone ! 

So I got some time and I made a little Google sheet so that's it's way easier to me (and all of you if it might help me or others) to see what I'm gonna do and the costs (which is a very important matter) : 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yZVlyHcWg7LfJv0R8rj10UEI3KcYwQEJUJjt4E5ggf4/edit?usp=sharing 

I tried to be as clear and complete as possible so if you feel like something is missing please tell me !

I'll try to get the deck, motors and pulleys as soon as possible while they're on sale so I get the free shipping from eskating.eu. Plus that way I'll be able to get the measures from the board and I'll try it with the wheels and some trucks I got.

@bigben Could you give a price range for the enclosure ? :smiley: (and shipping to France). Plus I wanted to know what do you use to fix the enclosure to the deck because it looks nice ! :slight_smile:
Btw, can i put a big vinyl sticker on the enclosure ? I mean will it actually stick to it ? heard something about it but can't remember or find where I saw it.

@Sender  Hi ! I wanted to ask you about what you did on Hummie's deck with fabric and epoxy (I think) and glass frit, is it hard to do ? I heard things about the grip peeling off on the Evo so I'm considering to do the same thing. So if you were good with sharing your technique it would be really nice :smiley: (I didn't see a thread about it but maybe I'm wrong)

I never mind sharing!  But it isn't the easiest process to do well, and minimum material costs are quite high to get the good stuff. To DIY you are looking at least $120 in materials or more.  That's not the real issue, it is the learning curve.


It is a ton of easy steps that needs to be done meticulously and timed right otherwise the end product will suffer greatly

Even if it's a hard process I might give it a try depending on time i have and cost.

Correct me if I'm wrong Tim but the tools are simply 600 brushes, big ol guns on your arms and nerves of steel. The materials are what will get you.

I'd suggest not thinking too far ahead buddy. Get the board rolling, it's currently gripped

## \#20 Posted by: Sender Posted at: 2019-04-28T15:01:15.135Z Reads: 72

No not tools. The minimum amount of epoxy you can get (the good stuff)  is like $75 or more without shipping.  Then whatever fabric.

You probably have the other stuff. Chip brushes, painters tape, heat gun, razor knife, various grit sand paper, and TIME

I agree, focus on getting the board up and running.  This is all looks really unless you are a heavy dude and need the reinforcement.  

Unless you are stuck waiting on parts

Just read through the thread.

@Deckoz and @brenternet are totally right. Rock the belts first.  

Gear drives are great, and I love them, but it definitely isn't nearly as intuitive and when something goes wrong, they can really go wrong.  

The best way to describe belts is "easy setup, easy maintenance, very quiet, and very forgiving"

Learn the belt side of the house, then maybe upgrade to gears.  Or better yet, do gears on board #2, as it is doubtful you will be done after your first build!

15mm

plus if i get them from italy there are no taxes and no shipping costs

Chuck it all into a calculator and figure that out according to your own desires. I'll tell you however that you'll spend 90% of your time in the low speed ranges than at full throttle and you'll likely not ever want to hold your trigger down. 170kv is plenty and gives you the option to rip the souls of your shoes off if you want.

![31|690x453](upload://4inkoNO0JAlNEo23GFpsyMcly6J.png) 
I think that something might have gone wrong here xD

And in the end I don't think I'll use the 190kv because it gives 68km/h top speed xD

So now the question is : is it better to go 10S and 190kv OR 12S and 170kv 

If I go for the 10S I can have like 6P instead of 5 and get even more range, while getting 56km/h (still very fast I don't know how the board will handle at that speed)
If I go 12S I get 60 km/h ... it's quite a lot ... I don't even know I am willing to go that fast on an esk8... need some thinking about this
```

For a first diy then 10s is plenty of speed and the added range is a better option.  12s and 192kv will have you flying and if you're not used to it can be very dangerous.
The difference between your pre built and this build in10s format will blow your mind in terms of power and speed.  What is the pre-built you have now?

## \#42 Posted by: souleat Posted at: 2019-04-28T18:56:42.569Z Reads: 48

It's a little brand, called gyromax (it's french) but I'm 100 percent sure it will be very different ! 
I'm getting about 12km range and about 32km/h speed when battery is full and on flat surface (not uphill)

So I think going for the 10S is the best option and as you said, I don't want to die on my board ;)
I think about going still for the 190kv even if I surely won't push them to max speed but if I ever change my wheels for smaller ones (like 83mm) because I'd like to try the tandem axle thing (I don't have a link but google it it looks nice) and the 190kv I found are sealed and where I live the weather sometimes feels unpredictable so it's a major good point to me.

Night and day my friend.  10s 5p with 192kv and 16/36 gearing running 107s will pull you up any hill with ease.  I'm 100kg and my 10s set up exactly like that rips me up some very steep inclines with no issues.  Tops out around 50kmh and thats fast enough for anyone really.  My 12s evo 39 on the other hand is ridiculously fast and that takes some getting used to.  Keep us all posted on the build as it progresses and good luck.

Also, I've got a big question : as a newbie / first build  would it be better / simpler to : 

buy a benchwheel remote as it is cheap and reliable and thumb control (I'm used to this kind of remote)

OR

get a GT2B and mod it into the sparkle mod (I know soldering a bit and have a 3D printer) ?

You probably have the efficiency rate too high.  Should be about 85%  107's will give you a higher top speed.  Mine is based on 97mm wheels.  Probably should have mentioned that. lol
Mines liion too.  Not sure if that makes a difference on that calc.  When I said 50kmh i also said thereabouts.  I wasn't too concerned with top speed rating on that board but we did do a speed gun on it and I clocked my son at 56 but hes a lot lighter than me.  Calcs are only an idea too.  Nothing beats doing it and there will always be discrepancies.

Yes this is a great remote.  I only use remotes that have never ever let me down and the benchwheel is one of those.

Hi everyone, little update on current state here if anyone is reading this thread x)

I made a few changes in the configuration of the board, the reason is : I want to avoid as much as possible to order from anyone not in europe, had to do some maths but it's definitely not worth it for most parts : 

for example, it's about the same price to order trucks and mounts from TB (which initially costs 150 euros approx.) and to order them from evolve : it costs me 230 euros for the supercarve trucks and the mounts, but there is only 8,50€ shipping, and no taxes to add to the initial price.

So I updated almost everything on the google sheet, added VAT and shipping costs and put the link on every product. I'm waiting for the answer of @fottaz about the pulley on eskating.eu to know which model to buy for the 107s but as soon as I know I will start ordering parts.

Hope the wheel pulley from eskating is gonna be compatible with the Supercarve trucks

Also waiting on the board to order the enclosure from @bigben and still looking for a battery builder in the EU but I've got some time for this

Only things I'll order from the US are the Unity Focbox (unless they still have a european warehouse which would be reeeeally nice) and maybe the benchwheel remote (or maybe I'll go for a GT2B, because if it goes through border, taxes and everything, it's really not worth it)

That was a bit long for a little update, but I'm getting more and more excited to get the first parts !

I saw he was doing it but saw no thread about it and wasn't sure


Also saw @Acido was making batteries but haven't asked yet

Supercarve trucks on an Evo? That'll be interesting. It has been done before though:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-build-landyachtz-evo-dual-setup-evolve-trucks-cell-level-fusing/39998/40

@pjotr47 is still sorting things out with laws and stuff to become an official battery building business, no idea when he'll be open to orders again. :confused:

  I'll be learning how to build batteries over the summer myself (just makes sense since I don't foresee ever quitting this hobby), but idk if I'll be able to help you out. I got my most recent battery made by @e.board_solutions (about 100€ more expensive than from someone on the forum), but it made sense due to free shipping. You can get pulleys from his store as well, but maybe you could get those from Evolve as well, that way being sure they will fit on the trucks.

Thanks I'll look it up !

Ok, if you have any other names that come to your mind ...

Yeah I was thniking about it but I wanted some 40T and they only have 38 T, guess I'll have to find another motor pulley to get the same ratio

BTW are 6374 motor compatible with the stock Evolve motor mounts ? i'm a bit worried

EDIT : I think their pulleys are 12mm and not 15 so it's annoying

EDIT2 : mounts are not compatible, unikboard does not have them now, if you know another dealer now ...

@pjotr47 Good luck for your exams and your business :slight_smile:

@Acido what kind of wait time ? It's not a problem but if could give an estimation it would be great :smiley:

@Acido  ok so not really a big delay :smiley: 

@e.board_solutions I'm going to use 6374 in dual so it's not gonna fit, and I've already chosen almost all my parts but thanks for the link :slight_smile:

I'm adding the link to the google sheet here and in the first post just in case :

Hi everyone !

Little update here !

I ordered a few parts last week (check the google sheet) most importantly the motors, deck and motor pulleys + a few other things :slight_smile:
I'm waiting for @e.board_solutions to get my deck at his place before he can ship everything to me  :smiley:

I might also order the Unity this week so I can get it before summer hopefully

VERY IMPORTANT : I'm looking for someone or a shop that can sell motor mounts for dual 6374 motors for the Evolve Trucks @okp isn't answering and I read that he doesn't work with UnikBoards anymore sooo it's getting hard to find some. 

@pjotr47 If you still have the ones you wanted to sell I'd still be interested :smiley:

have a nice week everyone :slight_smile:

hi everyone !

I don't know if anyone still reads this thread but little update here.
Got what i ordered (and more) from @e.board_solutions 

The board is reeeeeally nice.

Today I just ordered trucks, wheel pulleys and controller. I'm going to buy the UNITY but was wondering if I should take the one year warranty...

Anyway, have a nice week ! :smiley:

As far as I know Unities still haven't started shipping, so if you want the board done soon, get a different ESC.

maybe but it looks like the best esc out there so if needed I'll wait :slight_smile:

Hi ! 

Hope everyone's doing fine, just got my evolve trucks, they are reaaaaaally nice, they give a little flex to the board (which was scary at first but everything looks fine).

I am still waiting on the GT2B remote and I will try in the upcoming days to put my 3Dprinter up and running to print an enclosure for it.

I am going to order the enclosure and the UNITY as soon as i have enough money !

I'll try to post a few pics of what it look like ;)

have a nice day :smiley:

Hello !

Update on the build's state : 

- GT2B has arrived, I will try to print the Sparkle mod but it's really too hot where I am (about 40°C) and the printer is in my bedroom so I might delay that for later.

- Unity is ordered, will try to get it AT the Paris event, I am trying to contact someone (@EnertionSupport maybe ?)

- Battery is also ordered, will have it at the Paris event

- Enclosure is also ordered from @bigben, will also get it at the Paris event

- Also ordered a full face helmet because I don't see myself without this kind of helmet on a wooden board at 50+km/h. (link : https://www.urgebike.com/index.php?id_product=45582&controller=product&id_lang=2#/taille-xl) I hope it's a good helmet but it seems so

- I have to go to a FabLab today to see if they can make @okp's motor mounts

- also saw that I don't have screws for the motors ... so I'll have to buy some

Anyway, things are getting serious and I'm really happy but also stressed and I hope everything will be finished in time for the event !
have a nice day everyone ! :D

Hi again !

That was hella fast but helmet has arrived, it looks good and feels good too ! I'll do some test ride tonight when it's colder but definitely worth it !

I also bought some screws so that's done at least

FabLab will only be open on monday so got to wait a bit more for this :slight_smile:

Hi everyone !

soooooooooo... some good news and some bad news

Bad news first : 

I'm not getting the Unity until august so board can't be ready for the event AND I am looking for someone who would be ok with lending / renting a board for the time of the event (any board no problem, just not a MTB because I've never been on this kind of board) sooo if you are this person I'll be really happy x)

Good news : 

Battery from Eboard solutions just got shipped !

News in general : 

Making the mounts in the Fablab would cost approx. 110 euros but I can't machine both sides at the same time so i have to split the program, turn the part and "play" the other part of the program, and if the part moves, I'm screwed.

I found someone that can make it for 150 but it kind of feels expensive and I don't have this kind of money right now.

Also news but less important : 

Had a nice little test ride of the board yesterday night... feels like riding on an air cushion x) And the Evolve trucks really are awesome :smiley:

Have a nice day !
