Hello guys, I just ordered all the mechanical parts from DIY electric skateboard so I guess my board won't be an actual DIY after all lol. The reason why I purchased so many things, sadly, is not the quality nor the good price. It's because since I live in Europe shipping costs are nuts, and they will only free ship the products if you spend at least 300$.
My build is aiming for good torque since my commute include several semaphores (traffic lights or however is called in english). Here are the details [http://calc.esk8.it/#{"batt-type-lipo":1,"batt-cells":10,"motor-kv":190,"system-efficiency":85,"motor-pulley-teeth":14,"wheel-pulley-teeth":36,"wheel-size":83}|](http://calc.esk8.it/#{"batt-type-lipo":1,"batt-cells":10,"motor-kv":190,"system-efficiency":85,"motor-pulley-teeth":14,"wheel-pulley-teeth":36,"wheel-size":83}|)
I can't be more newbie to this so I would really appreciate the help, and don't hesitate to share your thoughts.

**Things I already have:**
- 83mm made in China flywheels (Abec wheels in Spain are at 90â‚¬... lul)
- Caliber II fifty 10" trucks bought in Spain
- Abec 7 bearings
- Spacers (here I have an issue, will explain below)
- Risers
**Things I have already ordered (from DIY):**
- VESC (with servo connector, sensor wire and mini-usb)
- 6355 190kv Motor
- Nano remote
- Mechanical kit including: Motor mount, 14/36T Pulleys, 12mm Belt
- Series connector for my batteries
**Things I'm about to buy:**
- 2 x ZIPPY Flightmax 5000mAh 5S1P 20C
- A couple more 12mm belts from Spain
**Things I know I'll have to buy but I haven't figured out yet:**
- Deck, obviously (if I'm lucky a friend of mine will build it for me with the most ideal shape and no flex)
- BMS
- AC charging cable
- Antispark switch
- Grip tape


If you notice that something is missing please let me know.
Also, and equally important, if you know where to buy the things I'm missing at a good price from Spain(EU) I would appreciate it.
How should I config my VESC to protect this 2x 5s battery setup?
My problem with the spacers is that they are too short to contact both of the bearings, so they will shake inside. The guy from the shop told me they are all the same and that it's a common/standard size.

Many thanks, I'll keep updating
