Hey! 

So I'm doing my first build as cheap as possible. 
I've been following this dude's tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuNxDbChhPw

I cannot find any working deck, need seriously some help with that. 
I live in Finland and I'd like to get it for around 50e, the lower the better
Let me know too if any of the other parts won't work either!

What is your budget? I would have bought some 10" caliber trucks if i were you. Much easier to find/make a motor mount that works, without reshaping the hangar.

Yeah or caliber clones if the real ones are too much

Also what's up with the deck.

If you want cheap buy a used one from ebay

My budget will be something like 275-325e.
Motor, battery, ESC and remote+receiver would cost around 180e if those what I listed really work, I wonder if somebody could check it? Thanks.
So I'm leaving about 100-150e for the board itself.

I haven't bought anything yet.

I was planning to buy it from skatewarehouse to get -20€ since they're offering that for those who buy the whole board from them. But I've looked a little from ebay, the options are there quite limited if I don't want to pay shipping that costs even more than the deck.

Man your overlooking some key things here. So you are going to have to listen to us or read a lot.

Where are you from?

It looks like your ordering your trucks and deck from an American website, have you thought about taxes and shipping?

Its not worth it, your trucks arent good for eskate or anything. And your deck isn't good for longboards

If I were in your position right now the only thing I would keep on your list is the remote and bearings :slight_smile:

I will PM you I have a few old things to sell if you are interested.

I've been reading for a few weeks now but guess it wasn't enough :smiley:

The electric stuff from that list is right from that tutorial video, I believe they do work but I'd just like a confirmation
Yeah that website just came when i searched quickly, I won't be ordering from there most likely. And I thought there were free shipping without taxes, ops.
I do live in Finland.

And sure, I could buy from you too but depending on where you live

Electric stuff isnt too bad.

But you can upgrade to a VESC
And you need to know how to charge lipos
Have a antispark loop key, or a antispark switch.

Enclosure and deck for 25e

I've watched several videos about charging lipos and I have a charger included in that 180e price so I think I'm good.

I'll be doing the enclosure myself I think from some kind of plastic drawer like it shows in the tutorial video and I'm not too satisfied with the look of that deck, good suggestion though

The remote I'm buying is only 25e including the receiver so it wouldn't be too big win anyway if I got this one for something like 5e since the shipping would make it about the same price...

I wonder if you knew any websites in Scandinavia selling board parts?

Dont get a vesc for low voltage builds, it cant handle the amps!

It will survive sure but you'll be stuck with low tourque and heat problems..

I have a vesc on 8s and 190kv single, i'd say thats as low as id recommend. It's fine for lighter duty but heats up quick for any hills
