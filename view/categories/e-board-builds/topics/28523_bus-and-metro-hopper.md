LOL this thing is so ridiculous. I'm having a hard time getting it tuned to where its actually ridable by a normal person. That 12S1P i made from older cells is terrible, decent acceleration and terrible brakes, sag all over the place. I tried running the calculations and detections for FOC on it after getting BLDC hybrid running and i think i fried something.

ITs fast and surprisingly stable, probably mostly due to the 165mm caliber iis. 

complete sketch on rough pavement, its like riding a pat of butter. its all over the place. 

I'm also working on the enclosure still. right now the package is heat shrinked and i just tape it to the deck like a fool.
