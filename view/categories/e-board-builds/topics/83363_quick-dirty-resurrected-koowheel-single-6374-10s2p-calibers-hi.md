So I have way too many parts now, left from my main build

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/street-slayer-dual-6374-190-kv-12s5p-flipsky-6-6/68413/40

I used to have a koowheel board, that was already modified a bit.

Once it completely broke, I made it into a regular longboard.

But yesterday I had decided to do a very quick build on it.
The board was run by a car twice, that's why it is shorter.

My main goal is too have as much fun as possible, not to plan anything and just figure it out as I go.

I will either use a TB Vesc or Flipskies one.
Have ordered a cheap remote, voltage indicator screen, some gromets and alu washers. I have found the battery at 25v, so not really sure how well it work out.

So the battery did got up to 43.6v, my solder died, so I'LL get a new one tomorrow, and see if the TB Vesc works or not, if not, I'll just put in flipsky.
