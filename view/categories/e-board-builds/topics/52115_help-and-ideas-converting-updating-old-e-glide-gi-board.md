In advance I want to thank everyone for reading and extra thanks for those providing guidance on this project.  I have a older e-glide GI power board that I would like to upgrade and reduce its overall weight.  The board has been good to me however I think technology has advanced a bit since it was designed.  The boards utilizes the following:

800W Brushed DC motor
PG Technologies Motor Controller
Ground Industries Bionic Trucks
Ground Industries Deck
High Pressure Pneumatic Tires
MBS Rockstar Aluminum Mag Style Wheels

I did upgrade to a lighter 10S5P battery and that has been working great.  I also have Kenda slicks just have not switched due to we still have snow in Minneapolis.

I think I need the following:

- 2 BLDC ESC
- dual drive mechanical setup
- 2 Brush-less motors
- 2.4ghz controller setup

I have attached pictures below would like your ideas on how to refresh and reuse what makes sense.
