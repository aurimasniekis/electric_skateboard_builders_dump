I don't have all of my parts in yet, deck should be here today and the rest of my batteries on tuesday.  Figured I'd go ahead and get this started so you could see the Red Ember (@treenutter) deck and Psychotiller (@psychotiller) AT wheels.

Gear ratio:  3.75:1
Top Speed:  32.47 mph - 52.26 km/h
Weighted Top Speed:  22.73 mph - 36.58 km/h
Constant Discharge Rate:  300a
Estimated Range:  21m (33.79km)

Obligatory skate porn...

Nope, just cheap hard case packs from Hobby King.  I'm using a JST extension cable to connect the balance leads to a BMS.  @Namasaki pioneered this type of battery pack.  You can see how he did it here...

Here it is with grip and the right truck hardware.  The hardware I ordered was 2.5in...WTH?  Anyways, I used some 1.25  zinc coated allen heads that I had laying around.  Im not crazy about the grip, I don't think it looks bad, but I need something that flows, the deck is to curvy for hard angles.  I'll figure something out eventually.

I swapped enclosures, the @psychotiller Monolith Low Pro 25 was a bit too long for the deck so I used a Space Cell Pro enclosure I bought for the heck of it.  I could trim down the low pro but I think I'll use it on my Jet Spud 33 that I am building next.

The next decision...I could finish it this weekend using a 10s3p battery pack I got from @PXSS (still waiting on x5 lipos) but I dont have a BMS yet so I would be running them with no discharge control.  Per @whitepony, if I understand correctly, is not a big deal.  Hmmmmmm, I ponder...

That looks really good. Do you think wheel bite will be an issue, or do you have enough clearance? I have a drop through deck I want to mount my hubs on, but I'm gonna have to do some serious hacking to make it work.

And for your boards name, how about the "Red Ryder BB Gun" cause it's red and it will blow away a Boosted Board (BB). :grin:

Just finished the maiden voyage, holy crap its awesome...

The Red Ember Boards deck by @treenutter is frikkin awesome.   I've never felt so locked in on a board before.  Just a little flex, but not so much it would hurt the electronics, just enough to smooth out the bumps.  I don't use this word much, but I can only describe it as "lush".

The @psychotiller 6x2in AT's are incredible.  I "see' the wobble that Dave was talking about, but I damn sure dont feel it.  It's all butter. 

I'm running a 10s3p that @PXSS built for me.  I don't have all my LIPO's in yet so I figured I'd run this temporarily.  I may not switch out, this pack has some meat.  I hit hills and accelerated quickly, never starved for amps.

I've still got some work to do.  I couldn't find my threaded inserts so the enclosure is just screwed on for now.  Still waiting on the BMS.  I need to align in my belts a little better. I need to dial in the VESC settings a bit, A little more punch on take-off, a little less brakes.

You can definitely run it without a BMS. You just have to be a little more vigilant and keep the settings conservative. Once you have a BMS you can relax the limits and really push the battery in terms of power and range since you'll have the BMS to protect the cells

I've got my battery cutoff pretty high.  I did the motor detection on both VESCs, setup the can bus and PPM.  Other than that and my bat min at -15 it's pretty much default.

I can say without a doubt, 30Q's are much meatier than 25R's.  I'm used to being starved for amps on 25R packs, but I am getting amp delivery like lipos with the 25R's.  

Good looking out brudda üòÄ.

Yeah, that's good. Cutoffs without a BMS, I'd say 33V/30V with a bms you can bump it down to 30/28 or 28/26 if you really want to squeeze all the range out of it. On the top end, 41V fully charged with occasional 42V charge to balance with or without. 

If you do go with these limits, I recommend using @Ackmaniac's firmware on watt control mode.  

As far as power goes, you can bump up your current draw from 45 up to 60, maybe even 90 if you want to really push it when you have the BMS that can handle it. 

Remember that at low speeds, you want higher motor current if you want some serious acceleration. I run 75A since that's plenty for me but you could go as high as 120A safely I think.

Ive got my cutoffs at 32/‡±©‡±¶ until my BMS(s) get here. I'll prolly keep it there even then.  I've only charged the pack once, but I watch the volt meter and stop it 41v.  When I get my BMS installed I'll prolly let it charge to 42.  I'm gonna need all the bolts/amps I can get.  Also, I just feel more comfortable with a BMS, less to worry about. 

I run @Ackmaniac 's firmware by default now, watt control  mode is unbeatable.  I'll play with the motor/battery settings when I get all the parts finalized.  When I get my 3d printer back from.repair I'm going to make a plate to surface mount USB connection for both VESC's so I don't have to take the enclosure off to re-config.  

I'm waiting on cables as well, gotta have them to make the Bluetooth lead for UART.  I've still got 15 packages I'm waiting on to finish both of my builds üòÄ. 

I'm going to buy some more 30Q's for my kids build in a couple of months.  Maybe make a 10s4p for me and give home the 3p.

All I have left is the 3d prints, bluetooth module (cable) & BMS.  @Crushkrew is printing the phase wire guide, and a couple of other things, for me (my printer is out for repair), thanks for that brudda.   

I'm still trying to settle on a name for this beast.  @treenutter thinks I should name it B.A. Baracus because it reminds him of The A Team.   @Mobutusan is voting for Red Ryder BB Gun cause it's red and it will blow away a Boosted Board (BB).  Any other suggestions? 

I'd like to put a volt meter on the top of the board.  Does anyone know of any that will handle 42V and either surface mount or is square so recessing would be a bit simpler?

@PXSS @mmaner all of the common BMS's we use (bestech, suupower, etc) are rated for 60A-80A continuous. The burst rates are higher of course, but have you found a reliable way to assess short-turm burst capacity without just frying the BMS? The spec sheets usually have a rating, but a) I don't really trust them and b) the "short term" duration is never actually quantified.

This is assuming we actually use the BMS for discharge and it's not bypassed. @mmaner I can move this question if you want, so as not to derail the build thread :slight_smile:

Naw, its all good.

I cant say with a ton of experience, Ive only used 4 BMS's but I've yet to burn one up.  With LIPO's I usually bypass and use it for charge only.  With Li-Ion's, I've got 2, I charge and discharge but I have really 'pushed' either board.  When I get my new BMS's in for the 30Q pack I'll let you know how it goes.

I'd ask @Namasaki too, he is the king of all things BMS.

The updated @psychotiller 6x2 AT Wheels (AKA 6 Shooters) are awesome.  They do not wobble, they are grippy as hell, smooth as butter.  The combo with the Red Ember (@treenutter) drop deck is as lush as I've ever ridden. 

 After careful consideration, I am gonna dub this board '**RE/PT'ile**'  I've got some graphics I need to get cut in vinyl, but after they are applied I'm going to liquid grip the deck.  There's a couple of things I want to do like put in a switch plate, relocate the XT90-S and charge port, pad the enclosure a little better...but for the most part, after the graphics I'm going to call it done.

I ended up using a Benchwheel remote that I had ordered but had not been delivered yet, I like it better than the mini-remote.  I used a 10s3p pack made with Samsung 30Q cells (@PXSS made it) and I must say its every bit as good as a lipo pack, awesome amp delivery, performance is solid.  Its obviously more expensive but supports a lot more charge cycles so it evens out. 

I'll post some pics when I get done with the grip.  I am still looking to get some vinyl cut for the top of the deck and then I am going to use liquid grip ([Lucid Grip](https://www.lucidgrip.com/products/lucid-grip-standard)) on top of that.

This is the best performing board that I own, and I have 5 total.  Its so torquey and fast that I cannot get all the way into the throttle, when I hit 25mph I start remembering im old and don't bounce :slight_smile:

It's a question (as indicated by the ? at the end).
And the question was excatly the reverse of your answer: I did not ask if your hubs fit all trucks, but if any other hub (Trampa, MBS) can fit on traditional skate trucks like the Paris in this case.

I may have already asked the question elsewhere but i can't remember, so here we go: only the @psychotiller hubs can fit on these trucks (a question of width of the axle or something like that)?

Where in this quote do you ask about trampa? Or other hubs? You should be more specific.

Are you talking about hub motors or motor mounts?  If hub motors I have no clue, been playing hell trying to get a set.  If you mean motor mounts, I had to mill down the paris trucks to fit the RIPBA mounts, but it was worth it.  THese are he best motor mounts I've ever used, very well balanced and infinitely configurable.

I just received a set of @psychotiller Wheels and man, they are worth every penny! Pictures really don't depict the well thought out design and most importantly, the fit and finish. Super high quality, plus the quality of the machining really puts it above any other AT wheels at the moment. 

I can't wait to put these wheels on my next build!

No, I would have liked to use longboat trucks with pneumatics, but it looks like most of the hubs on the market are slightly too wide for the axle and you cannot tighten the bolt completely. And I am sure I read that Psychotiller hub are just enough narrower to fit on these trucks. Maybe I'm wrong, and I would like to, but I would like to have confirmation of one or the other.
Thanks

My wheels aren't just narrow enough...As I said, They were designed for longboard trucks. They only take up 24mm of axle. Just like skateboard wheels. They are the real deal. Not, sourced from alibaba.

All of the other pneumatics on the market are for mountainboards, (But really scooters, wheelbarrows Wheelchairs or strollers.) With the exception of MBS and trampa, and those have wider bearing spacing and different sized bearings.

Really nice built.  I am considering building a board like this.  A couple of quick questions:

Are these Paris 195 trucks?

Do you think that Psychotiller's wheels + Paris 195 trucks will work on Loaded Vanguard deck without a wheelbite?

They are Paris 195s.  I don't know about a loaded vanguard, never owned one.

There was some discussion of BMS above in this thread. But what BMS do you actually use in your built?      There is no much space in the spacecell enclosure to put a big BMS.

Bestech 10s BMS is all I've ever used.
