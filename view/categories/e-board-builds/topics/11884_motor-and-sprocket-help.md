Hi I just bought this motor from alien power systems:http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/alien-5070-hev-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-270kv-2200w/
The thing it unlike sk3 motors which have a flat spot, this motor has a keyway.
Do you think it will still work with this sprocket:http://www.ebay.com/itm/1-4-12T-Rotary-Chain-Drive-Sprocket-12-Tooth-Pitch-6-35mm-Bore-5-6-8-10mm-/161940970678?var=&hash=item25b46f1cb6:m:m3rf6KeBnmJqoJmGjfqRq2g
Basically I m trying to figure out if set screws work with keyways.

It should work, preferably the setscrew diameter is smaller than the keyway width otherwise it may damage the edges of the keyway. In that case the setscrew also needs to be long enough.

Thank you for your quick answer. But if the diameter of the set screw is smaller its also not good because it light move a little bit right?

The bottom of the keyway should act as a flat spot. Only drawback is that the screw is closer to the center of the axle so it will have to deal with more torque than if it was on the outside surface of the axle.
