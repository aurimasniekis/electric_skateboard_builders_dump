So as the title says what are you guys looking for in a consumer board? Me and a friend are doing this thing called YEA and where wondering what you guys would be looking for in a board that would be sold at $1000-$1250. The markup doesn‚Äôt really matter but what would you guys like, ie: Range, speed, deck size, concave/flex, wheel duro and size, truck style, and anything else! We are trying to make a board tailored to the esk8 scene and not some Chinese branded board. So, what would you guys want in a $750-$1000 consumer grade board?

All I want in a consumer board you can‚Äôt get into for 1000$ üòÖ
If you can I will buy 5 and resell 4 for 1800$ üòÖüòú
Just jk...
750$ is pretty low
12s4p 350$ min
2x vesc6 or 1x focbox unity 250$
2x gear drive 300$
Uups we already over that üò¨

Even without gear drive
250$ for good motors
30$ min for a good remote
20$ optional for a Bluetooth module

And than let‚Äôs start with deck, trucks and wheels...

His are 2k+. The main point you need to hit is reliability, a consumer board MUST be reliable. With a small company like this if one thing goes wrong your whole company could be gone

Under $1000...I'd only expect a light weight minimalist board. 
25mph (ish) , 15 mile range, under 34inch deck.
Something i can easily carry if needed in a store or stash under a table grabbing a bite to eat. Be able to take on a bus/cab/train or toss in a shopping cart.
Not something im gonna take on group rides probably.

Meh, age is a number but when its that low you're limited by experience, access to equipment and funds, time to put into the project, patience, ability to communicate with customers, perseverance...

There's a myriad of problems that being young and trying to run a little business life with throw at you, it's often worth waiting until you're a bit more long in the tooth.

Lol 12 and thinking about a business. At that age I was playing football in the garden :grinning:

I don't know if it is possible to start a business at that age in your country. But know, you are playing with human lives. I do not think you want it on your conscience, that it goes wrong with a board and because of that someone is killed

Let's see if this sounds reasonable for a sub $1k board.

15+ mile range, pretty much enough to get across town and back on a single charge for most people,  10s3p?

multiple deck choices

20-30mph speed

Urethane/pneumatic interchangeability. Quality wheels.

RipTide urethane bits

vesc

single motor/dual motor choices

RELIABILITY, especially for a consumer board where if it breaks down; even something simple, can be loss of money for the seller.

Eh, it might be a bit over 1k but it would be a great retail board.

You could always sell kits with all the parts just without a deck. Then they make it and build it so if anything goes wrong you can blame it on them? Also you eliminate alot of the building process.

I‚Äôm pretty sound on what the board is going to have just need some thoughts from you guys!

Either Custom Jet spud style deck from @Ian-mountainboard or Tayto From @JLabs

For the Motors either gear drives from @moon with 6355 or Enertion R Spec drive kit

For the Vesc is going to be Focbox Unity

For battery @JLabs 11s3p  or @psychotiller 10s3p 

For remote Mini Remote from eBay 

Should be around $1300 without mass buying products
It‚Äôs higher then we wanted but should be able to get it down to about $1000 a board with mass buying... The boards will be sold from between $1500-$1750

I did not realize that my board would be used in a mini company. That's amazing that your 11 and already doing this but I was just considring offers from individuals. I could make a prototype deck for you to test but I have never worked with a deck shape like this. I'm not sure if I would be able to produce enough of these as I'm going to collage soon. By the time you get the funds I will probally be unavabale.
