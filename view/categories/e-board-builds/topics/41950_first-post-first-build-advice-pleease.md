Hi all. There doesn't seem to be an introduce yourself section so thought I would combine this with a plea for some advice on my first (budget-ish build).

Ok firstly a little bit about me, my main hobby is fly rc planes, so all the electronics is familiar to me. More specifically currently I fly mostly FPV (First Person view) so have a camera on board and fly through the picture that is sent back to my goggles.  This is a video of one of my favourite planes The MiniDrak, with a mixture of onboard and ground footage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cE50LTmLgU   Here's a different one with 4 of us in the air:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hY5RcPnQ00

So to my esk8 advice...

So for my foray into electric longboards I wanted to keep costs to a minimum. Having never Longboarded before I don't want to spend thousands on something I might only use twice.  

I've bought an ATOM drop through Longboard, reviews suggested good for beginners.  Tried riding it a few times, so far stopping is the main issue, with pushing far from easy :slight_smile: 

I decided I would go 8S for battery as I have 5X5200 4S batteries already.

For the rest..
Motor:  https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-213kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html
ESC:  https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-sk8-esc-for-electric-skateboard-conversion.html
Motor mount:  https://www.banggood.com/DIY-Electric-Skateboard-Kit-Parts-Pulleys-And-Motor-Mount-For-80MM-Wheels-p-1146629.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN
TX:  https://hobbyking.com/en_us/quanum-2-4ghz-3ch-pistol-grip-tx-rx-system.html

I think the thing that I really struggle to get my head around is whether what I have picked will all work well together.  I'm not fussed on getting the max top speed but I would like a bit of grunt to get up hills but some braking coming back down as well :slight_smile: 

I know what its like when people ask the same questions time and again, we get it all the time in RC. The amount of times I've been asked what is a good first plane :) I did try to find the answers myself, honest!

That esc is the older 4.10 HW vesc version. Its cheap, but its certainly not the best out there. Try to find a 4.12 hw version or a focbox instead.

A drop deck is fine if your lipo can fit under the deck with at least 3cm clearance from the ground. 
For your motor, you need a key slot or a flat edge for you can't secure the wheel pulley. I would go with torque board motors, but if you can do some steel work on the hobbyking motor axles, you're good. 
You also need the respective female connectors for your ESC from the battery and do some soldering work. 
Make sure the trucks you're buying is for the motor mount.
If it's something you not really gonna use that often, it doesn't really make sense to DIY. Anything branded board is for you.

Cool thanks.  I've been reading through the FAQ already but hadn't managed to find a new member thread.
