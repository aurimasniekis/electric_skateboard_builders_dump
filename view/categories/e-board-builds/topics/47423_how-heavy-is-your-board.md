Hello evryone,

I think mine is too heavy to carry in subway so, want to compare to others if I packed too much batteries

mine is 20lb or 9 killos. Probably because of avenur truck baseplate. it's extra heavy.

its not like i can't lift but not easy to carry in subway or bus, especially because of the crowd.
I'm building a portable one because of this so

I'd guesstimate mine at about 12 kg, what with dual 6374s, 10s5p battery, and trampa vertigo trucks. Yeah, it's got good range, and I have to take it up "only" two flights to my apartment, but it does add up. I'm debating switching to dual 6355s to save some weight without too much power loss. In the meantime, I've come up with a handle and carrying strap:
![handle|639x499](upload://khm7YkNBHxQjS3GWecTu5pRKlgJ.jpg)

A short strap goes from here to a hook which will catch a loop of stiff wire (12awg) that's attached to the rear truck. More pics when I get home.

mine do have handle at the rear, and very useful for draging but it adds up when I commute.
Im going to try strap front and back trcuk and lift from side.

don’t worry about it bro! you’re not “weak”. boards are just generally incredibly awkward to carry, mall grab ESPECIALLY with board that are 40”+ (unless you’re over 6’. build that second board!

Huh, that's good point. 
...aaand it now occurs to me that I could have done the same thing using an old dog leash or something. I forgot the KISS principle...

That could work, but you might need to wear it high and horizontal to avoid the wheels banging into your legs. I'm also guessing it won't exactly be fun to carry that on your shoulder along with a laptop backpack for example.

My summer-board is about 9kg, and winter-board is around 16kg. Both of them have 360Wh battery.
The winter-board has heavy hub-motors and trucks that weight about 7kg :smiley:
I'm trying to make my summer-board an all-year board by making removable tires around the wheels. Hopefully i can print good rubber tires once i get the filament :stuck_out_tongue: 

You are just falling the wrong way. I've never broken any of my bones :rofl:

I don't know about fitness but excercise does make denser bone.

lets keep things as related. it is not bio class.

I will flag anything about bone from now on

Just weighed mine, dual 5055 with 10S3P comes at 7,75 kg, the cool thing is that the CAD model gives about 7,6 kg

My previous one was single 6355 also with 10S3P and was 10,8kg, I guess I can say my goal to make my next board lighter was achieved

The thing is, we don´t push to get to our desired location and physics tell us that we have to compensate that.
So we´re given some heavy ass boards and have to carry them around..
Physics!
