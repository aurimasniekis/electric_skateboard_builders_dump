Working on my second build. The goal of this build was to create something small and light to make it easier to carry. 

I have most of the parts, just waiting on the battery.  

Deck: Bustin Spliff
Trucks: Paris
Wheels: Orangatang Kegel wheels
Motors: Hummie hub motors
ESC: Dual Ollin Board Co. (Best money I have spent)
Battery: Miami Electric Boards 12S
Enclosure: SULACO v1
Remote: 2.4ghz Nano remote

Thought it was odd that each hub motor is sporting different screws, if anyone knows where to order the black ones please let me know!

cool build, love the anodized purple hummi vs. purple kegel color scheme! :slight_smile:  

think I would try to get the hub motor wires running on top of the truck and not below it. thats why:

That looks like a smart move. Not sure if I can rotate the motors given the glue, Hummie mounted motors for me so not sure how they rotate once installed.

If I put Velcro on the outer part of the heat shrink on my VESC do i run any risk of hurting it??? Or do people mount using the mounting holes? Thanks in advance.

I actually prefer a soft mounting solution like this. We see a lot of vibration on eboards and the more you can dampen the vibrations the better off your electronics will be.

The battery installed.  I am getting about 9-10 miles out of a charge, great battery so far! I also like that I can switch out the battery pack and on off switch and fuel monitor stays with the board.

@Sboard342  I'm considering using a Spliff for a build too. Would you recommend it? Are there any downsides to the deck as an esk8?
