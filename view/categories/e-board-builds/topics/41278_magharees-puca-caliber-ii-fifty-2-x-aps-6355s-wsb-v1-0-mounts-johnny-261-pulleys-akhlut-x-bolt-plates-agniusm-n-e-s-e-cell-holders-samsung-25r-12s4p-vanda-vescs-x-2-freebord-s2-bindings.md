Wikipedia: _The púca (Irish for spirit/ghost), pooka, phouka, phooka, phooca, puca or púka is primarily a creature of Celtic folklore....If a human is enticed onto a púca's back, it has been known to give them a wild ride_

I'll let Santa(the guy holding the Titanium rod) introduce a tandem build I'm working on.

After I picked up some 6355 from @rich & some mounts from @WSB , I thought I could pair them all

The N.E.S.E packs are awaiting my hardware kit from @agniusm, I'll run the wiring through a center channel, not an actual channel made in the deck but perhaps a conduit or something printed. This is just a layout coffee momement of things to come. I'll mount them with Velco when I've decided their permenant location and fix them down with some Titanium plate, you can see some in the picture above, but may do each individually and in a way to make a bashplate for each pack.

Edit I got confused and mixed up @marcmt88's mounts oops, the mount on this build are of course @WSB and came with all hardware, there are no idlers pulleys...actually)  `T̶h̶e̶ ̶m̶o̶u̶n̶t̶s̶ ̶c̶a̶m̶e̶ ̶w̶i̶t̶h̶o̶u̶t̶ ̶a̶n̶y̶ ̶h̶a̶r̶d̶w̶a̶r̶e̶ ̶s̶o̶ ̶I̶ ̶h̶a̶d̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶s̶c̶r̶o̶u̶n̶g̶e̶ ̶w̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶I̶ ̶c̶o̶u̶l̶d̶ ̶f̶r̶o̶m̶ ̶w̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶I̶ ̶h̶a̶d̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶e̶i̶t̶h̶e̶r̶ ̶m̶a̶k̶e̶ ̶o̶r̶ ̶m̶o̶d̶i̶f̶y̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶r̶e̶s̶t̶.̶ ̶H̶e̶r̶e̶ ̶a̶r̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶s̶h̶i̶m̶s̶ ̶r̶o̶u̶g̶h̶l̶y̶ ̶d̶e̶s̶i̶g̶n̶e̶d̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶g̶o̶ ̶o̶v̶e̶r̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶M̶4̶ ̶b̶o̶l̶t̶s̶ ̶w̶h̶i̶c̶h̶ ̶r̶u̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶r̶o̶u̶g̶h̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶i̶d̶l̶e̶r̶ ̶b̶e̶a̶r̶i̶n̶g̶s̶`

And yeah the Freebord mounting did not come as easy as on a non-drop deck, since I am using this MBS ATB I needed to make my own boltholes, here are some brass M5 rivnuts, sadly this one broke so I had to easi-out it and replace.

Yes those are indeed Knipex adjustable pliers @agniusm  hehe

So I'll bury 2 Vanda VESCs which I got back in May in a @Kug3lis VESC enclosure..waiting on that so far. I also need to rejig the wiring and capacitors to make them fit ok, it came with a single huge cap from Vanda.

The BMS in this will be the @fedestanco produced @JTAG designed BMS in all it's glory, I haven't figured out where it will live yet but will knock something up

No the design lended itself well to a clean print even on the old wanhao I'm using so nice one on that front

It printed in ABS and scaled to 101% for shrinkage, the reason the green is off from the other greens is due to it being colour changing based on temperature, bad cell? I know which one 😉☘️

I think I started out with 0.3lyr and went to 0.2 for resolution, about 240 with 105 on the bed
Oh yes and the motor covers glow green in the dark as will the upcoming motor scrape guards/debris ingress protectors, I'm going to put some more work in this area watch this space

Thanks I will be sure to do so :grin:

Ok latest mockup looks like this on the underbelly I've moved themounts somewhat to address a clearance issue with the trucks and motors, I've also added about 1/2" of risers which should help clearance considering this is a drop deck.

Ok so here's the unfinalised electrics layout Alan no with the Ti skidpan for the packs frontal impact and underside skid rails, I'm going to do something cool with the wiring I think

And I'd really like some mudguards shame there's no room to use the axle bolt as a securing point @wsb would it be possible to mod the motor mount cover to elongate it over the wheel somewhat and secure it to the other end on the clamp ring holes which have unused depth in them? I have the rings with the bolts facing the motors not ideal but needed the clearance, I could try longer belts but then idlers would get necessary.... next purchase 😉

Will have to bend both bashplate ends around the last packs and devise a mounting system for the plates to the board.

And since I don't have access to an argon welding cabinet probably a mechanical join of plate to skids.

I went the extra piece in the middle to provide more protection and to help secure the packs, if will also protect and wiring between packs<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/9/498db8b47a68e71ed2dd4f492afcb42c47615f2a.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Need more Velcro for stronger X Velcro stripe, don't forget these will be lashed down with Ti, nothing is falling off!

Also you can see they are be padded from clunking into each other and the deck...vibration kills kids

The screws are stil assessable and lid of the pack can be removed no problems

Progress slowed by work, I made a mistake on the rejigged @JTAG  bms enclosure so that's still not completely finished but you can see what it will be like, also removed foam between packs for space, to be replaced by 1mm silicone (no pack 'clicks')

Easy, you can see the thought put in...

After connecting the series bars I think I will go with them and also they hold the packs so securely together I really don't see the need for any silicone buffer. Also I got rid of the foam between the packs and the board and replaced with more Velcro, given the design I don't see cells getting shaken loose...bonus is I may be able to test ride without the metal bars.

The packs want to splay a little on the other end when the series bars are connected, the Ti bars will eliminate any movement.

I did make a mistake insofar as I wasn't aware that only the negative side has a poron strip, as I didn't examine the contents carefully it meant I have to bend back and remove some bars after 2/3 packs, thankfully no break.

I will make a small loop to connect the two pack strips with copper ring terminals.

I made a small mark on each pack to denote polarity direction.

 I want to finish this up, ride some and move onto an ATB in the works.

"I did make a mistake insofar as I wasn’t aware that only the negative side has a poron strip, as I didn’t examine the contents carefully it meant I have to bend back and remove some bars after 2/3 packs, thankfully no break."

It actually does not matter which side you put in, negative or positive (i like to put cells negative to the foam as you said it, no particular scientific reason). The bumps are sized to positive side so there is no overlap and with cells sitting snug, no chance of them shorting on positive end with negative outer lip.

The compression gasket is on one end to minimize play. When there is more material, e.g. on both tabs there is twice as much risk for cell loose compression. One side is more than enough.

If you have a gas torch, heat up the bend spot. This will anneal it  and it will go back to its previous crystalline form (copper molecules) and you will be able to bend back and forth as many times as you like granted you anneal again after bending couple of times ;)

BTW, you can jus use some 5mm x .2mm stainless strap, feed it through ribs of the modules and strarp it that way to the board. They actually are meant for that:

I'm good no breaks! But I would not risk removing them again without annealing good advice

Steel band? That is a great idea, I'm eager to take a ride so may go that route for both the splaying problem and a quick mount the packs are pretty study and I don't plan on grounding the underside for the moment

Liquid tape for the series bars and a smear of silicone on the pack interface top/bottom methinks would be enough

Ordered some VHB tape and some steel band...well wire but who's checking?

For some reason probably beer I took the mounting lugs off the box and instead will put 4 small magnets under the pcb (with insulation) this working with 4 more magnets mounted to the board will allow the bms to be taken off easily

You can see the routing in the pic above 😉

Of course the silicone tubes are empty right now but I'm going to use the old trick of pulling them through a small pinhole for each pack 12 holes by sticking a piece of wire through the hole from the other side, pushing it back to the box and temp soldering it to a balance lead...then pull. I'll have to do that 12 times but should end up with a watertight solution

I'm too mean to buy liquid tape so silicone sealant/ instant gasket will be used, too cheap to buy corrosionx for the bms so will use some acf50 I have on hand.

The wire rope I ordered was too fat at 3mm so plumped for some 2mm and some hardware

So I got ahold of this magical ABS from HK. Not having a good time printing it, even with the mightly Prusa I3 MK3! Might use up the whole spool trying to get this done :)

The lids print okay for the most part. But the case warps and pulls the corners off the PEI bed.

Tried printing 2 of the cases at once, with a 8 layer brim. Curled up in the center about 70% of the way through, and somehow finished printing with a nice slope.

Did you print them one at a time? I can fit six on the bed, but chances of getting that to print successfully are pretty low I think.

And I was using 255/100 for temperatures. I'll try your numbers on the next run.

Maybe try putting on 'ears' on the corners, I printed one at a time, they do like to curl, in using a glass bed btw, temp can be high 230s bed around 100 for the HK glow abs, print one at a time for sure

I think BK my magnet version is without ears

They are not without imperfections I'm a cad noob

[/quote]

Thanks for all the info, it's helping.

So far I have 2 good ones and 5 bad. :) After the 1st good one, tried for 2 at once. I think it fails because the parts have more time to cool. Singles it is.

I printed at 101% -- batteries are way tight in there especially the ones on the edges due to the slight curling. I'm thinking about going to 102%.

For the good ones I printed at 230/105, 2 bottom layers (I read the more solid the layer, the more it shrinks), and a brim 10 wide.

The bad ones, the corner curling makes the slot for the metal tabs too small.

I printed a bed attached camera arm out of this color change ABS. Hehe it's quite amusing seeing the color change near the heated bed.

These are the longest i found.
For printing abs, try to use large cardboard box. Even a trash bag over the printer helps.

Thanks guys.

I'm back on 5 bottom layers, reducing that didn't make much difference.

I've still got some lifting in the corners but the brim keeps things down, and I think the result is not perfect but okay.

I've got this thing though, where every few prints, it underextrudes like crazy. Reset the printer, and it goes back to normal. I've been using octoprint and the latest beta firmware, maybe it's some interaction. So annoying! But now that I know what's happening I can watch and abort early.

The tightness I was getting, I think I sliced those at 100% doh! the 101% guys fit much better.

I think I can get the rest out without using an enclosure. 3 hours per tray!

The bands, thanks for the link, that helps a ton. Non mobile link:

"stainless steel zip tie" on amazon (US) turns up good hits. This link doesn't show dimensions, but there's a tightening tool. Looks like one way trip, like a zip tie :slight_smile:

Going cooler seems counter-intuitive (I think), but will give it a shot. Thanks for the tip.

4 more to go then it's lids, then fun with SainSmart TPU for the caps, for which despite the Bondtech extruder, still misfeeds if I print faster than 60mm/s, and I can't get 1st layer to stick reliably unless i go 10mm/s. And strings like mad.

Update on the underextrusion glitch. I disconnected USB, and printed from SD card (I got a FlashAir card at least). Glitched on 2nd print. So it's the beta firmware or the slicer's start/end gcode. I can get back on octoprint.

Believe it or not I'm trying to keep things simple. Wasn't going to use even Octoprint but with all the failures I needed remote webcam, and had a Pi lying around, and Prusa has a modified octopi image... Staying in the ecosystem at least gives me some decent starting points for configs and such.

I was under the impression that it happened from excess heat as it tries to maintain 100c throughout the print and overshoots a bit, especially right over the heating elements

I think the theory is, each successive layer above the heated bed gets a bit colder, and shrinks a bit more. Making the bed hotter keeps more of the lower layers from cooling and shrinking, moving the shrink stress higher.

All confused and curious now. I'll try what you suggested, and also try bed heat 120, I believe that's my max. I can also try like 5 layer high mouse ears in addition to the brim. But maybe all this would be a waste -- an enclosure is probably the better thing to try. Just a bit scared of flames.

And dude go to sleep!

My box is not a great model, you may need to slightly enlarge the lid groove, also I get a strange filet from each of the corner bolsters, but it's workable.

I had a little package arrive from beltingonline a whiles back and since my printer is being a bitch again I needed a switch of activity.

Introducing tool steel, it's what should go into  the keyway you find in an APS motor, which was another reason for the order...10mm motor pulleys are not common.

Anyway you can buy a keyway for about €3.5 or you can roll your own it's not hard, a dremel or hacksaw and a file is all you need. This bar would make keyways for a dozen or so motors, a small vice is handy

BTW, @deucesdown, have you tried abs juice? Get some acetone, put some abs scraps, same colour, mix it until dissolved, should be still watery, not thick, brush it onto the bed and you shouldn' need even a brim. Although i print on pei and that stuff made it stick so well that i ripped my pei, mostly my fault not letting it cool down.

Slight mod with additional reinforcement ring on the fan blades and plenty of cooling to the end, not a great print as those holes should be hexagonal, it's printed in carbonfill. The printer is being a bitch with her thermocouple.

2nd vesc repaired and running, needs the cappcb installed and phase sorted for the @3DServisas case, getting closer on this one.

Oh and I'm learning through failure on the ups and downs of drv replacements, this time I managed to free another solder pad from its moorings but a LCD microscope really helped getting it back in place. I salvaged a couple of caps I managed to blow off with hot air from the Miami vesc I got from @Martinsp which I subsequently butchered with an angry drv repair, never repair 😡

Dont give up on the repair! Some pads are not connected to anything, those are the ones that easily come off. You can check that in the schematic. If you are interested in giving it another shot post a pic id be interested to see.
BTW the miami VESC uses DRV8301 even though it is based on 4.12 HW

Following @Deckoz's lead there was only one thing to do; bury the receiver and BT modules.....,

But in the same single vesc enclosure, no what?
![IMG_8909|375x500](upload://uMWh2n0cQQQJO8Tu1GwHct8OiTY.JPG)
I had to bend pins and shrink wrap, worm things in and around around but hey I claim victory so far on this part.

I put on @Ackmaniac's F/W & ran setup again, now reasonably happy with it. One vesc had a bad motor temp reading which was not the motor, vesc thermistor is reading far too high.

May have to replace something which is a shame since I conformal coated them while I was at it.  So to avoid a faulting vesc slave I leave the motor temp cable disconnected, the vesc can handle that without faulting you just see a wildly inaccurate negative value in realtime

I'll rough finish to try and get out on Sunday 😎
