Hi everyone, I wanted to introduce myself and let you all know how excited I am to find this forum. 

A week ago I was out for a walk with my family and saw a kid on a skateboard coming in the opposite direction. I noticed he was coming uphill...then I noticed he wasn't pushing. I had never seen this before, and I immediately went home and looked up electric skateboards, and haven't been able to think about much else since.

I saw some boards I wanted to buy, but figured I could probably build one and then found this forum. It's informative and I'm loving the mentality here (build a better quality board vs buy the hype .. yeah, I almost pulled the trigger on a gtr that first day lol).

So I'm learning the terminology and trying to understand the basics before I start planning a build, but I'm looking forward to sharing my progress when the time comes.

i don't know where you come from but where i come from (germany) we don't have that many months to drive an esk8. Should it be the same for you, I recommend you simply buy a Chinese hub board for 400-500â‚¬ and take advantage of the summer months. As soon as the winter comes I would start with the planning and realisation phase of your DIY.

Lol it's a new obsession for sure. I'm hoping to keep it around 2k, but I can picture myself going way over budget

That's a great idea, thank you. I'm in New England, so I have approximately 6-8 months with no snow. I'm in a pretty rural area too so I'm interested in an all terrain setup (that gets me thinking.. I've never seen anyone do it, but I wonder if an AT board can ride on snow trails??)

It's not that, you buy into it thinking youll have one board but than, you end up having , 2,3,4,5.... Boards. And in financial ruins
