You need to know the center-to-center distace of the axles, and whether or not there are any idler pulleys.  Then search for belt length calculator using the search button

What I did was I took a string, and ran it around the pulleys with the motor as close as possible to the trucks, measured the string length and then got a belt that was 10-15mm longer than what I measured. 

Not the best way to do it unless you use some type of belt size calculator (which I didnâ€™t) since that is getting the inside length of the belt
