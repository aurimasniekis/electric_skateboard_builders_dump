First Build. This is obviously going to be a progressive build while I wait for the unity to arrive. 

The Shryke is named after my favourite Innova Golf Disc, the Innova Shyrke. 
13 Speed, 6 gluide, -2 turn, 2 fade… if that means anything to anyone. 

I probably should have named this build Apprentice Evo, after getting so much inspiration and information from @Deckoz Brad and his Master Evo thread. So you've probably seen it all before. 

In saying that, with the Australian Dollar only getting .70 USD, and the shipping costs getting here (normally $50+ USD), I really wanted to do a lot of research to try and get it right the first time. 

My mate has an Evo Falcon which I was comfortably cruising at 48kph (30mph), so I wanted something that went a little bit faster. My original plan was 31mph. I found the falcon just a little bit short for my stance, so I decided to go for the Evo. 

So here goes… I ordered a bunch of parts and received most of them this week: 

**Purchased / Received:** 

**Deck** : Landyachtz Evo 39”  (concrete lines skate store) 

**Enclosure:** @eboosted custom evo standard enclosure 

**Wheels:** BOA 100mm Red
* Bronson G3 Bearings

**Trucks** : Caliber II 44° Red 
* torque boards hanger on order
* Sector 9 Wedge Riser pads Black
* Lux Wedge Riser pads Red

**Gearing** : 
Build Kit Boards 
* 15T Motor
* Kegel modular pulley set 36T 
* HTD 265 - 15mm belts

**Extras:**
Customer Evo X braces from Matt @aklut… which I’m yet to pay for!! 

Bestech D140 Charge Only BMS

**Purchased / Waiting for delivery:**

**Motor** : 2x Torqueboards 6374 motors
**Motor mount** : Torqueboards V5 Fixed Dual Motor Mount Set 
**ESC** : FOCBOX Unity on pre-order


**Yet to purchase:** 

**Battery** : 12s5p… possibly Samsung 30Q cells

**Remote / Received:** Undecided / possibly Entertion Nano-X /  until the Fireflys are become more refined. 

I’ve also bought some 40” Globe Grip Tape that is ridiculously coarse.. going to try laser cut some designs into it. 

My original plans in April… 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-member-introduce-yourself-here-tell-us-your-plan/216/1234?u=moone 

Not too much changed, bigger wheels, more range, and a higher top speed. 

**Good bloke awards:** 

@Jlabs - Jared.. good banter.. answered a bunch of questions.. saved me a heaps of cash.. hopefully got some beers out of it. 
The modular pulley set is amazing. Love how it's push in and there isn't bolts going through the wheels. Awesome product. 

@deckoz - Brad... always helpful in answering small stupid questions about his Evo build specifically - Appreciate it mate. 

@eboosted - Alan... Can’t think of anyone more patient. Amazing talented craftsman. Cheers for the quick turnaround! 
The enclosure looks better in person then in photos... if that's possible. 

@akhlut  Matt... Gave me free X braces…. seriously, send me your bank details.

How do you like the evo as just a push board?

I see it being used in alot of builds lately so I was getting interested in the wedged/dewedged set ups.

I'm building my own decks now so I kinda want to make one and try it out!

Yeah mate, I'm actually loving it with the Calibre 44s. 
It rolls really well, it's easy to control, and the turning with the trucks is much better than my boosted board (the boosted trucks are quite tight though). 

I have two other functioning push boards that I use and this probably feels the smoothest / nicest with the set up in the photo. 

I need to find a big hill to see how it handles are higher speeds. Have the wedges sitting there ready to go, interested to see how to handles as is first.

How good is it even without the big motors?  Planted board hey?  Did a little analog work myself earlier because well just because. Mine will be rocking and a rolling tomorrow so I'll keep you posted.  
Nice build and don't be thanking @Deckoz he just cost us both a fortune. :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

Was actually thinking I needed to buy a second Evo deck just to push around the streets. 
But I'm sure I'll be over it by the time the unity arrives. I'll live vicariously through your build until then. 

Fortune is an understatement. I stopped counting because the exchange rate was killing me. :skull_and_crossbones::money_mouth_face:

There is usually a fine line for carving and speed.. its one or the other..the Evo just carries high speed with ease and carves like a beast at speed with the right bushing set ups....

The Falcon looks sick! But with my long legs it was just that little bit too short. 
I haven't even started playing with bushing set ups yet. I wasn't planning on changing them until I actually get the board up and running, but if you have any recommendations let me know!

Yes @moone this is why I enjoy the smaller version this year so much more..as the original Evo felt really long to me all my boards that are close to 40 feel like a mini surf board to me as I'm only 5.6 tall ..so for bushing set up as you can see I haven't touched this set up yet either new trucks and wheels and this board reacts different to the original much smaller..I have alot of tuning myself... for the Evo you will find you will run different duro from front to back stiffer fron softer back to help carve at lower speeds..they are like a bus..but you will run different duro for board side and road side..it's hard for me to give you a set up as your weight height and style and how advanced in riding..DH you will want stiffer carving softer...this is your tuning comes in everyone  is different..as you advance you will want more carving abilities..loser trucks. the best bet for Evo really is to get a basic feel and get a couple duro harder and softer and play around with them..now @Alphamail from riptide can most likely help you out much more he is the bushing guru ..cheers and have fun..

**Battery Update:**
Waiting for the Unity to finish production and start shipping, so in the interim, decided to learn how to build a battery. Luckily have a mate who is clued on with everything and has a spot welder. 

Bought Samsung 30Qs and tested them all. 
Put them in the configuration for a 12s5p, and once I was happy with everything, started spot welding. 

![20181012_122336|281x500](upload://zZVJB3IetsG0k7n17B6mCZbEUvK.jpeg) 


I haven't been able to find a big sheet of fish paper in Australia, like I see people using to insulating the batteries, but there is sticky fish paper sheets stuck in between the batteries length ways. 

My friend Roger keeps saying Insulate, Insulate, Insulate. 

![20181012_180501|281x500](upload://q3Qskphyr1YfimqNnpgfJKnVKBv.jpeg) 

The BMS was wired up next, which after speaking with @dareno, I'm going to hopefully move tomorrow and put at the very front of the nose. 

Any other tips / recommendations I'm happy to hear them!

**Controller Update:**
Ended up going with the Enertion Nano-X controller. 
I wanted a thumb wheel controller, like my boosted remote - I'll probably look into the fireflies when they are more readily available in the future. Or even look at building my own based on Solid Geeks files and product part list online. Might be a little challenge for me to work on. 

This controller is a lot smaller than the boosted. I have pretty large hands but I think like I can sit in there comfortably. 

Time will tell.

Can't believe that you are using that thing in your build.  The whole concept is flawed mate.  I mean who the hell in their right mind would build a board using an evo?  Worst deck on the planet.  And using 6374's
Really.  Should be hubs if you want performance.  Whats wrong with you? 
this is what you need for true esk8 quality

I thought i'd post a bit of an update to where I'm at. 
I've assembled and dissembled the Evo several times trying different things, trying to make everything perfect for when the Unity arrives. 

Noob tip: 
No matter how much research you do, you're always going to hit a bump on the road and something isn't going to work. 

I really liked @torqueboards V5 fixed motor mounts. Unfortunately, the angle of the Evo and the angle of the motor mount meant that mounting the motors inwards was resulting in them hitting the board. Even with a wedge, they were going to be too close when the enclosure is finally mounted. 

![20181003_171817|690x388](upload://aNzWYtrt96yfGwz3SiJ0ASdyz99.jpeg) 

A quick email to Dexter and I was able to swap the V5 for some Crimson Red V4 mounts (which match the colour scheme). 

@captainjez I see red, I see red, I see red! 

![20181105_195337_001|281x500](upload://dYkcmB2Oi3uF6eFFNWDr62UzfTB.jpeg) 

As soon as I roughly put everything together to see how it would go, I knew I would need to use a riser. Luckily I had the 1/4-1/2 inch wedge riser, which worked but I needed longer hardware.
![20181105_223002|281x500](upload://ayv34hzKZ7G9udWPflLSnr19ouu.jpeg) 

After putting the wedge in, the enclosure was still going to be too close to the motors. Pushing down on the wheels I could see that the motors was going to hit the enclosure on tight turns. 
![20181107_192620|690x388](upload://1wLzM8qObfRTRxeMiDG0BKFQk2b.jpeg) 

So I bought some mini-logo .25" and .5" risers some the skate shop near work. The .25" seem to work nicely, but I'll have to wait till the enclosure is mounted to be 100% sure. 
I bought new hardware on Friday just incase I need to use the .5" risers. 

@sender do we have the same floor? 
![20181125_175641|690x388](upload://jVBkShOZ4ZRvmNRRAESeWouuDoh.jpeg) 

So the wood inserts from Alan that came with the enclosure are for mounting through the top, so I'm in the process of buying some wood inserts to mount straight into the bottom of the board. 

I've also bought some m5 washers and bolts to mount the enclosure to the deck. 
![20181123_111321|281x500](upload://ixnCmicKaMigPNpRWjaqy7lP6gJ.jpeg) ![20181125_165826|281x500](upload://kwkNmchYnehgcszVTU3Cx90HgNM.jpeg) 

I finished the battery, not the prettiest job with the BMS wires. I had the BMS mounted one way initially, but ended up deciding to mount it at the very front of the board, so had to cut and extend a bunch of the BMS wires. I just need to heat shrink it and I have some neoprene foam to insulate the top of bottom of the enclosure. 
![20181026_201503|690x388](upload://5FNNgHcLh3UFb9vKY2t6hEIHnbV.jpeg) 

I sent the legend Brad @alphamail from Riptide a PM with my build info and what I wanted to do, and he recommended some bushings for me to try out. I ordered through the site and have them all ready to go / play around with different combinations. 
![20181119_175934|690x388](upload://zgi0xCF1mTpewocFlLoStfpJJg2.jpeg) 

Looking forward to that Unity being shipping, hopefully by the end of the month, so I can get everything firmly together and get on the road.

**ENCLOSURE MOUNTING [spoiler]FAILURE[/spoiler] TIME!!**

Bought a bunch of M5 stainless steel wood inserts to mount my enclosure! 
![20181130_183618|281x500](upload://z1L7nJ5tO48Cr1EISuKSRN3sy5N.jpeg) 

Played around with the washer set up and chatted to the lads about the right amount of inserts to use and settled with 5 a side. 
![20181201_113924|690x388](upload://oV1OB02AaozVq4ItS4u8skfBypb.jpeg) 
![20181201_123205|690x388](upload://i4zgkH8IM0KvOonjojU2hdaPg7Y.jpeg) 

Read every enclosure mounting thread I could... Lined everything up. Got the four corner bolts in place.
Kept checking my work, everything was looking perfect. 

![20181201_172842|281x500](upload://9qCLyjHQqOpUXDTrqHDnNEKa71K.jpeg) 
![20181201_165805|281x500](upload://8TriSuzaGcWvk00hoZxTUer26gL.jpeg) 

And then bam! After I did the last six middle bolts the enclosure somehow ended up slightly to one side. There is still a gap between the enclosure and the edge of the board, but when you're going for perfection, it being off centre is a bit of a let down. But, you learn and for my first deck and the angles of the @eboosted enclosure, it could have gone a lot worse. 

![20181201_183529|281x500](upload://kESbKGcgOqJjqULXNhJWioXk92Y.jpeg) 

All angles of my board will now be as follows :smiley: 

![20181201_190237|690x388](upload://m1uGx6QSsq0vhdhlSc2Fr8HyttJ.jpeg)

**The Dangers of Trusting "Mates / Friends" - Use Trusted Sellers & Use PayPal** 

This probably almost justifies having it's own topic, but let's hopefully assume the skateboard community isn't filled with dishonest people who don't give a second thought about lying straight to your face. It's a long boring read so feel free to skip to the pictures :slight_smile: 

I haven't been as active on the forum as late, partially because of work, partially being involved in a long drawn out process of being lied to, and basically scammed out a unity. 

It all started in late May 2018. Someone who I considered a close friend and crucial member of intimate skateboard community sold me two Focboxs. This was the beginning and the foundation of my build. I had spent months researching the forum without an account and I finally had the building blocks to commit and start the build. 

I paid $350.00, transferred from my account into his account. I have proof of purchase, there's never been dispute of me having paid the money. 

Over the next two months, I had decided I would try build an EVO for my first build, which in my mind was probably a more complex first build. I started ordering parts. This is when Enertion released new that they were releasing the unity. I thought, this is great, it's going to streamline and simplify my build.

I told my 'mate' and he was all over it! He said that through his 'new electric skateboard shop' (that never seemed to eventuate), he was going to order a few. This didn't seem unusual as he had over 10 focboxs that he was selling. 

I was pretty content on keeping on focboxs until one day he called me up and said he had order 20 Unity units. Buying in this quantity and in pre-sale had reduced the price significantly. Quick math, he basically was saying he had just ordered $7000 AUD worth of Unity Units. My first mistake was not thinking twice that this was a ridiculously large amount. But why would I have any reason to doubt him? This was someone I would skate with weekly, go and grab beers, take his daughter out skating with us etc. Furthermore, he showed me an invoice on his phone for 20 Unitys. I know now that this was most probably a quote. 

He then propositioned me to swap my 2 Focboxs for a unity when it arrived. He said he needed to replace one for our other friend, and needed one himself. I didn't have an issue with this at all. I delivered them to his house and everything was sweet. 

_Side Note: In the interim of Enterion starting to post updates of the Unity coming out. Another member of the community wasn't happy with a product that 'old mate' had sold him. During this process I endlessly defended him to the end of the earth and always had his back._ 

When the Enterion updates started I was stoked. They were boxed and ready to go. You may have seen my posts about 20 Unitys coming to Perth, endless banter with @onloop, and just high spirits. I sent my 'mate' these updates, he was playing along the whole time that the Unity was still a thing! 

5 December 2018 comes around and in the Enterion newsletter the photo of the all boxed Unitys comes out! I send him a screenshot and he replies 'yeah I know, I saw that last night!' 

11 December, I ask for an update. He said he hadn't heard anything. 
12 and 13 December, I ask several times for an order number. This is where I knew I had been made to look like a [spoiler]fucking[/spoiler] idiot. He went off at me advising that the order number was not going to speed anything up etc etc. 

_This made me really suss that something wasn't right. I was able to confirm that low and behold, nobody by his name had order a unity and guess what, there was no quantity of 20 unitys ordered in the whole of Australia._  

Two days later I went to his house. I didn't bring up the issue, I just ensured I had all my skateboard parts and got my battery shrink wrapped. As I was leaving he said 'I'll see you next week', I replied why, he stated 'your unity will be here'. I knew at this point he was full of shit, but I had been trying my hardest not to knock his head off, so I just smiled and drove off. 

He hasn't replied to my messages since. Which have all been pleasant. I've asked him to refund my money, which hasn't occurred. I haven't been rude or distasteful, because I'm not a shit bloke. 

I basically had a my board ready to go since November without any Vescs to power it. I had made a 12s5p so the enclosure was already tight, and the whole plan was to get the small unity to fit in there. To top it off my car got stolen :sob:

This whole situation just put a dampener on finishing the build or even riding my other board at all. 

The best thing about this forum is the actual real mates you make. @dareno told me to stop being a little bitch and get on with my build and @skunk sent me his Unity to finish my build, and told me just to pay him when I could afford it. 

There's a whole bunch of blokes on here that know who they are that are legends. I just hope one day I can be sitting in their local bars with their friendly bartenders, sharing a frothy. 

You think I'm going to re-read this to make sure it makes sense? You thought wrong. 

Enjoy the photos - These are from my test runs. 
My top speed so far is 58km or 36mph. 
I'm still tinkering - But hopefully done soon!

Well lookey what we have here.  A little bitch with a proper first build.  Looks spot on.  Well done that man.  
There are no extradition laws between WA and QLD mate so next time I'm over that way I'll burn his house down.:sunglasses:

I've never heard that before and have no idea what it means. But it's absolutely what I'm calling @Skunk from now on 😂.
