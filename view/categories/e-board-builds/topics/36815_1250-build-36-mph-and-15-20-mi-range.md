After starting off with a koowheel, then going to an Evolve BGT, I decided to go the infamous DIY route. I built a single motor 6474 190kv 10s lipo build earlier this summer and the brakes/torque just werenâ€™t there. Ya it went 28-31mph but the brakes were awful and in the end dual motors/vescs run 10x more effiecient. 

TB 6374 190kv motor $120 ( x2 ) = $240
TB 12s4p battery (included charger, on off, voltage reader ,enclosure and is a xt90 plug) $450 
TB VESC 4.12 = $99 (x2) = $200
TB 218mm trucks = $60 
TB motor mount pulley kit 16/36 abec $99 (x2) $200 
Deck ( Method longboard deck ) cut, sanded, stained and ployunrathane the outside. = $65 
Wheels = Abec 11 97mm = $100 or clones $28
Nano remote = $25
Male to male service = $3
VESC canbus =$2
Vesc connector = $7 
Hardware for deck and bolts for enclosure = $20
Shred lights = $40

After discounts and if you get clones instead of abecs you can keep this build within $1250-1300 which is crazy for the specs

This board goes around 42mph. Super windy ride today but this dual 6374 12s4p thing is a beast compared to my evolve.

How do those VESCâ€™s do at 12s , you have to limit the erpm limit ?

I run 12s on my TB vescs, dual 190kv 6355's using only autodetect to configure. I don't trust them in foc but in bldc they rip.

Yes only bldc for me. I blew one in FOC about a week ago but I was being a dumb ass. Tried smoothing out MBS wheels Kaly style which doesnâ€™t work on 12s. Iâ€™m going to run hybrid soon

can you take some pictures of the enclosure? How is the 12s4p running for you? Planning to get one too but still unsure.

Have you tried censored BLDC? I have a build similar to yours, but on TB vesc and one Ollin Vesc. I tried running sensored BLDC and it was a lot louder than unsensored, but only on the TB vesc, the Ollin board vesc had no increase in noise. Wondering if it's unique to mine or typical of all TB vesc

I have my dual TB running on hybrid and I agree it is quite a bit louder than it was unsensored.  Idk why

My build which is similar to yours, I topped out at 35mph. Different brand motor/ESC but I limited erpm to 60k.  Also unknown to me at the time my remote was only giving 93% at full throttle.  I'm using maytech 6374 190kv and dual focbox.  So maybe further testing is required to see if I can find another mph or two

I actually never ended up running hybrid. Iâ€™ve got my board running great. Did this recently <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/e/6e1bf7d5ae318634b016d6f98cbcd23bbba0febf.jpg" width="690" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/e/0eeff00a99693a2c93f4408b32f14655bc3f7ba8.jpg" width="230" height="500">

You should be able to get 38-39 easily with a 12s dual 6374 190kv. How much do you weigh? What wheels? Bearings?
```

## \#13 Posted by: E1Allen Posted at: 2017-11-28T17:41:05.688Z Reads: 401

Probably 185 with all the gear I was wearing. 97mm wheels. 16/36 gearing. Ceramic bearings.

Ya thatâ€™s weird, Iâ€™m 200lbs and I donâ€™t even have ceramic bearings. I just have some abec 9â€™s. I have the same hearing as well with 12mm belts. Whatâ€™s your vesc settings?

60k ERPM limit.. but now I'm not sure I hit a remote limit or the ERPM limit

Look at the data where I hit 35, it just kind of flat lines.

46.5V on a 190kV motor is ~61,850 ERPM.  You've limited it to 60k, which is why you're maxing out at 93%

Iâ€™m honstly just running motor max at 50 then changed the ramp and startup boost. Going over 50 is just death. What size wheels, ratio, bldc?

Damn! I have motor max at 90 and I also changed the start up boost and ramp lol. I have 15:36 gearing and 100 mm wheels on bldc. I also have idlers maybe the extra friction and my gear ratio are slowing me down

Hey @Mattmccrary8, Nice build!

How has it held up so far? Any issues with the Torqueboards components? I'm looking to build something with Torqueboards parts too.

Also, if you were to build it again are there any components you would have chosen differently?

Thanks.

For this build I would get focboxâ€™s. Then I havenâ€™t noticed much of a difference in my 6374 and 6355 setups so Iâ€™d probably run 6355 motors to get more range
```

---
## \#24 Posted by: gmurad Posted at: 2018-03-28T00:49:22.078Z Reads: 244

```
Since this is a dual motor setup would that mean 2 x $213.82 = $427.64 just for the controllers? That's a steep price.

I'm 228 lbs, so I was thinking 6374 vs 6355 would help with the extra torque.

Yes it would, but you can get focboxes for ~$150. A dual 6374 setup is not cheap at all

Male to male service = $3

I like the fact that you involved male prostitution in your build. I don't think enough people make use of this resource, and it can really set the final product apart form the rest. I'm curious how you got that deal though.

I know @DavidBanner has them in stock, and think the price is somewhere around $150. Thats also the price most people around here sell them for.
