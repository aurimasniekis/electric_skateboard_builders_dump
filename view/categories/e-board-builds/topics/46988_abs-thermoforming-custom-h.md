Thanks to all that have helped me, get my skate caddy running.
I own  Thermoforming business, mostly make Gold Prospecting Equipment, out of heavy, 1/8 ABS.
Get great details, with my machine, do small orders and prototypes on it. Have access to the big boy, if I ever sell enough to justify using it. My parts shown show the sharp edges, great definition and strength.
I will be looking into some mold designs.
If you have a special piece in mind, get in touch.
Good chance, I can help you out, if you are willing to help design your covers.! Can make about anything,
if you can dream it.

This was before I added pneumatic cylinders to my machine, took a lot of work out of building them.
Parts are more consistent too!

Have not tried, but I think it will with proper heat settings, I have 4 zones with about 16000watts of heat, and 100 gallon vacuum tank and 2 stage pump, pulls to 28 inches of vacuum.

My roots in boarding run deep. This was my old Skatepark in Duncan SC. My sons and I built it all.
I first nailed a skate cut in half on a 2x4 in about 1968 or so, LOL,

Nice!! I just checked it out. Seems like it's a passion of yours. 

With equipment like yours, you could have a nice little business making and selling enclosures. Or maybe you could be the first to make an all plastic deck with built in enclosure.. like a penny board deck.
