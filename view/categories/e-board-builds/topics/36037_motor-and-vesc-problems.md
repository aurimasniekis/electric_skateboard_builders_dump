 I have  a TORQUE ESC VESC but when I turn on the skateboard, the full power doesn't arrive to the motor. I run with two 4S batteries and my motor is an Alien power 5065 270kv 

How i can solve the problem?

Take screenshots of all your BLDC tool configuration and post them here. Check the range and throw of your transmitter and the corresponding settings in BLDC tool.
