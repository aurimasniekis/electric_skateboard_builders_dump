Hello everyone,
I have been working on this board for about a year now. I have been browsing around this forum for a few months and decided that I would put together an ongoing build log. I have just burned out my fourth Propdrive 500kv motor. This and the battery are the only things that haven't been upgraded during the duration. Here are the parts that I have settled upon:
- $60 Hobbyking X-Car Beast 150a esc
- $50 (sale) Multirotor 4s 16 ah battery
- $20 Propdrive 500kv motor (Big mistake)
- $25 97mm Flywheel clones (Ebay)
- Chain drive 8/35
- Traxxas TQi remote (Had it spare in my shop)
- Homemade 23x9 inch deck

I am in need of some recommendations for a new motor and a 6s lipo battery. I am willing to spend up to about $110 for a new battery and motor combined. Any suggestions?

Could sell you a way better motor 260kv sk3 and brand new with a keyed shaft

If I were you, I'd would dump the chain and go for a 12---32 or 12---36 belt pulley drive with a 63 ,74 motor if single drive at about 190 kv and run it on at least an 8s battery with a vesc.

What is the problem with chain drive? I started out using 9mm wide belts (Yes, I know I need to do something wider) and they just kept snapping. I have since had zero problems with the chain drive. It has been quiet reliable and inexpensive, less than converting to wider belts. I am planning on doing a $1100 eMTB build with dual 6355 motors some time this summer so I don't have the money to go all out on this as well. Just looking for something to do the job in and around school.

@willpark16 How much would that be? I have looked into the sk3 motors. They look good and a keyed shaft would be nice.

I'd like 60 if possible but might be  able to go lower

Your Biggest issue is the motor you are choosing is wrong.  500kv ...max a motor should be used is like 270 
Kv....

You need to find a motor between 190-245kv

This will end your needing a new motor every so often.  Plus you'll probably go faster even though the kv is much lower...you were killing those motors

Would $60 include shipping? I am located in Seattle, Washington. Also, is it a 5065?

On 6s, what would you recommend for gearing with a 245kv 6374 motor?

Depends what you are trying to achieve ... torque or top speed ... always a trade off.... but in ur case go for torque to reduce the chance of burning motors like marshmallows at a campfire

Is 6s enough to run a 6374 motor? 12-32 seems like it would work quite well.
