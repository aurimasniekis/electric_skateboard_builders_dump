Hi all,
I've decided to make an eboard after a bit of reading and Youtubing.
I am planning on ending up with a duel belt driven board but due to cost I'm starting wit a single motor to start with. 
So lets get down to it,
I have;
1 x Z-Flex long board deck with risers (to be modified when time allows.

In the mail;
1 x TURNIGY AERODRIVE SK3 - 6374-192KV
2 x 218mm Torque Board trucks
1 x new Torque Board motor mount in red
14 and 40 teath pulleys from Torque Boards 12mm
4 pack of 280mm belts from Torque Board 
90mm red wheels with bearings of Ebay

Still to get/decide on;
FOCBOX - mainly because it looks reliable/easy/AUSSIE
10S5P battery, enclosure and charger from DIYeskate
Controller - can I get the meepo one without their other stuff?
Bluetooth for the VESC apps
Off road wheels to add riding options in the future

Thats it for now although I will upgrade to duel 6374s at some time in the future for torque and braking, I'm 115kg, but for now this qill do me I think.

Any improvements or stuff that will not work together?
Any help will be appreciated.

Dude it looks like a cool build the only thing I would say is maybe look at the Turnigy skateboard motor simply because it has sensors versus the Aero Drive, might be smoother

The Turnigy sk3 "6374" is not sensored and isn't 6374, so be sure to check the actual dimensions

I can't recommend an unsensored motor

The sk3 63's are really 59mm

The other dimension is the one that causes problems.  I think they're 59mm diameter by 86mm long or 5986

But it's unsensored.  So.... yeah

Do yo have a link to a motor that would be better on Hobby king? I could not find a specific skateboard motor, only the hub motor kits.

I could probably exchange it.

Allot of the stuff I've read said that most people go sensorless. Is the general consensus to go sensored these days for smooth power delivery?

Sensors get you moving from a stop.  Once you're rolling it's the same.  Without sensors, you have to kick-push then throttle.

However, they also add one more thing that can fail.  Overall, I recommend them

I' in Australia and have already got the motor on the way so it would be easier to exchange I guess.

If the motor is already on the way, use that one unless it doesn't fit.  If you're using a single motor it should fit and on the TB 218 trucks two of them should fit even but not on some other trucks

For the controller, you have a big decision to make.  Do you want to control the throttle and brakes with your index finger or with your thumb?  It's personal preference.

To be hosest i could go with either and get use to it, and then probably feel weird with anything else.

I like the idea of having the three speed settings so I can cruise while sitting down with my four year old son ( only on quiet back streets.)

I would probably like to be able to start without pushing in some circumstances. What would you suggest that is not crazy priced if I had to go international?

Cheers mate,  probably a bit small.

I might stick with having to push start for a while and upgrade to two 6374 sensored motors when I upgrade.

Unless I decide to thow my earth moneys at someone.🤔

I also use a 192kv SK3, and honestly it's not a big deal having to slightly push to get going. You only need a very small push and then just apply throttle to taste. Esk8ing will feel pretty awkward to start with but just ride a lot and you'll get used to it faster than you expect :slight_smile:

EDIT: I'm 110kg and even a single SK3 on 6S is pretty fast. You'll have no trouble on 10S :P

The Turnigy SK3 motor is as big as you're gonna get for a 6374 motor. ![59553D6E-296D-46B5-BB1E-07FFA07847C9-306-00000043834AF253|666x500](upload://pGgm2H6zG2JCShuz5ZP9EQjx8JN.jpeg)

Since it's using those 'diagonal clamps' that the other TB compatible mounts use, I'm going to guess yes. Probably will take some filing to make sure there are 4 points of contact.

So I got some packages. 

I think this will work for the alignment of the belt.
With the bigger wheels there is some wheel bite so I'm going to have to do some mods to the board where I have marked with pencil.
I think it looks a little goofey with the wheels sticking out like this but I'll probably just get use to it.

Ive also bought one of the photon remotes. With alll of the features it will keep me tinkering for a while.

I just have to wait for some more earth monies, so I can get the battery and Focbox.

If you ever plan on dual I’d suggest flipping that motor pulley around so you can move the mound closer to the wheel pulley :wink:

I was thinking about that, but the motor shaft  is about 4mm too short for the pulley. If I flip the pulley the locking screws sit half off the end of the shaft, so if I can find a pulley like the Enertion ones with only a small area for the locking screws then it will work beter.

I have gotten rid of the Torqueboard pulley in favour of the Enertion 36T slip ons with some spares.
I know I'll loose some torque but probably not too much going from 40T to 36T.

Ive ordered a Focbox and am still waiting for the Photon remote.

I'm also tossing up between the 10s3p or the 10s5p with the respective enclosure from Diyeboard. 
Do you guys have any thoughts on those two batteries, apart from the range differences?

Well, I've been as busy as a cat trying to bury a sh!t in concrete.😁

I've sanded the paint from the bottom of the deck.
I also milled some wheel wells, there not perfect but what do you expect for a first time by hand with a dremel.

Some more mucking around in the garage.

I traced the wood grain with a marker rather than put a graphic on, I like how it sort of looks like a map.

I made a houso sliding glove. I tried using hot glue gun sticks with a heat gun but the velcro just peels off so I had to do some arts and craft stitching. I got the pucks from a plastic place for $5.

A couple of updates.

I repositioned the motor mount with around 1mm of clearance between the pulley and the mount.
![20180316_211152|374x500](upload://z6DZXKwUtSU6e55TgHQ2pPcBLH0.jpg)

I cut a flat spot in the shaft and mounted the motor pulley with just under 1mm clearance. Is that too close?
![20180316_211208|374x500](upload://oU10kwuUdIOJLWkZURj22pkBaEc.jpg)

With the new 36T enertion pulley the 280mm belt is too long, I'm guessing that a 265mm belt would be a better fit?
Or maybe 250?

![20180316_211233|374x500](upload://gVvLyozQ6557bsrSvS9RXbWEuKY.jpg)

I also swopped the fan screws for some M2.5 10mm screws but had to cut a few mm of the end.
