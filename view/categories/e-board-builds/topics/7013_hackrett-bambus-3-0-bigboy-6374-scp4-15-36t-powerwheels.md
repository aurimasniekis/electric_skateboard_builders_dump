Hi guys, I want to share with you the 3.0 Bambus Deck from Hackbrett, I will use it for my build.

I will post more pictures step by step. Now I'm going to add the grip!

I've already sent an email about it, I'm waiting for a reply. 

I'm also waiting the SPACE pro4 and 1 motor pulley from Enertion, Maybe they will send the 2nd truck with the other parts?

I had fun only by costumizing my Vesc, I wanted an heat sink on it and I've created one from a graphics card. I have bad tools for the moment, but it was funny! 
What do you think about heat sink on vesc? Is It necessary for you?

Oh yes, this board is completed.

And wow, I've reached 38km/h and was not the maximum because of the end of the street.
