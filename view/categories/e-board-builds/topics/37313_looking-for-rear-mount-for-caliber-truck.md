I'm Planning of next build for next yr, with new avenue rkp truck.
but I can't source back mount other than the torque board.(and they don't sell it as a set)
And do you think 15mm belt / dual 6355 motor will fit?
Leave comment if know any thanks.

For our trucks 180mm Dual 6355 15mm won't fit. You would have to use 12mm.

Using our 218mm trucks. You could fit Dual 6374 15mm belts.

Lucky for you I only stock 12mm belts with my mounts, hehe. Currently doing the V2 clamp update if you're interested.

I'm running 9mm belts on my dual 6355 and I've never had any slip or problems. You only really need 15mm for powerful singles. With dual, the stress is spread out across two belts.

We have a new fixed reverse mount setup which will have a support bar + support bracket and will be compatible with our 6x2 pneumatics we're releasing in the near future. FYI. But if the current mount is too much for you.. It might not be in your price range.

Yes my mount can be mounted in reverse. The holes for it are symmetrical so either side has the same adjustability
