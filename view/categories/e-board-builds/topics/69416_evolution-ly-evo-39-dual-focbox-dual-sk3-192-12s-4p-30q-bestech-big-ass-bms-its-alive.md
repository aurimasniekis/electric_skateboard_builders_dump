Wasn't going to do a thread on this build because its nothing new or indeed special but its just so pretty I had to share it oh and to thank the people responsible for making it.
All I'm doing is assembling it.
It started as a battery upgrade for my existing dual 6374 carbon and evolved from there hence the name.
In looking for a way of mounting my controllers above the deck because of the great big battery I stumbled across @sk8l8r awesome clone evo build and things changed.   That deck that enclosure oh lordy!  That was me finished.  I just had to get me one of those.  Couldn't go the falcon though just in case I couldn't fit everything in and end up back at square one so went with the full size evo.

Just sitting there looking all gorgeous.
Then the enclosure
 ![IMG_0995|375x500](upload://cNW3mWfY0r3OUCCI9MCuhlFl03k.jpeg) 
Ignore the one on the left thats for later.

Then I had a massive motor malfunction with both my sk8 which were originally earmarked for this build and had to go for something else and after much deliberation I went with the old faithful sk3's
I'm not keen on sensors so not an issue for me and they seem reliable so hey ho off we go.
Oh and hk delivers in 3 days.....3DAYS!!!

![IMG_1007|666x500](upload://OWfGfYnIKvYFvpZt8paJzjQ9Lj.jpeg) 
Drive train was an issue due to flex on the reverse TB mounts with big heavy motors so I hacked a cross member set up and incorporated some idlers
If anyone is interested in that process then shout.

![IMG_1008|666x500](upload://27mAM6zc9W4pv21KRr9GthSNW5f.jpeg) 
Originally wanted dual braces and idlers but when I looked the belt was too close in the centre so until I source some smaller bearings it will stay with one for now.
![IMG_1009|666x500](upload://rylb5VNoVvZ5ti54Z5ZoqPGVgvQ.jpeg) 
Just not sure about that clearance.
![IMG_0997|375x500](upload://zGcA8lWJeH5XY75DFJ9XM019eDc.jpeg) 
It all fits just.
![IMG_1020|375x500](upload://dXEho06vQLvzw35T6gvblJcJqSe.jpeg) 
Got the nut serts in after some scary drilling into my baby
Went with m6 big ass inserts and man that deck is hard.  Broke a few before I got it all done
![IMG_1021|375x500](upload://4bRlmtYjfpGHfuSMFXrE4dhOfLy.jpeg) 
This basically where its at right now just some wiring and aesthetics and we are go.
Just making up my mind about whether to go deck mount or enclosure.
Keep you posted on progress

Big thanks to
@Colson003 for the deck and x thingys 
@Eboosted for that beautiful enclosure 
@TinnieSinker for the battery
@torqueboards for the drive train
@CarlCollins for replacing my fried focboxes (and the hour long phone call )
@Deckoz and @sk8l8r for the inspiration  
@akhlut for the x thingys :roll_eyes: sorry man! 

everyone else that I have stalked and harassed all over this wonderful community

damn this is pretty, what problems did you have with your sk8? im looking to get 2 6374's @ 190kv  to Australia. are they worth the extra like $30 compared to sk3's?

mate to honest they look almost identical under the can except for the sensor pcb.  Seems like an updated design is all so should be as reliable.  I think that mine were just a bad luck thing and hk would have changed them for me had i been bothered to send them back.
one threw a hall sensor error up and the other had a catastrophic rear bearing failure.  They were great up till then though.  I have heard of similar issues with the sk3 a few months back but hk being hk will have addressed it by now.  They still work but just sensorless.

bagged up the motors for the flat spot shaft work and ran out of get up and go.
Should be up and running for testing in the am.  
@Eboosted man can that loctite  hold a pulley without set screws and keys and flat spots?  rather just use that if it can. 
Been playing with wedges too to get the deck where it was designed to be
![IMG_1027|666x500](upload://5edqLXjoXHXNPQtoCQO46urS3Rx.jpeg) 
@Cobber
 apparently the deck was designed with randal 35 degree baseplates so these 15 should get it there is it worth doing?   Oh and I'm assuming they are right.  i'm lowering the angle of the hanger.

I'd deffo wedge a EVO Dareno. I couldn't imagine riding one on 50's without. How fast are trying to go?

Loctite works like a champ on motor pulleys, you just need to heat them to brake the loctite to get the pully off. TBH it makes a stronger union than a set screw :muscle:

think it will still hit 60ks with the gearing at 15/36 because I really want it to do that going back up.  I rely on gravity for the downhill bits

What a nice build! Let me ask you a question, what is the black piece highlighted in the picture?...it seems a plastic protector...is it 3d printed?...i would be interested to know more to protect my battery.

I think I distinctly stated that you were to ignore that one.  Its for later on.  :wink:

Man they are the fine work of the creator of this fine forum because that my friend is an enertion 10s 4p 30q pack without the wrap.  They are a plastic battery cell holder but not 3d printed I'm afraid.  Them there would be mass produced.  Keep looking though because someone somewhere has made some trust me.

Yes, use Loctite 680 no grub screws or keyways, but the pulley must slide in not loose and not tight, just perfect

Its so close now after a frenzied night and morning session.  My workshop looks like a bomb went off in there.
![IMG_1030|375x500](upload://nTE3dhuTqsxoqGu60PHNpAvmvNS.jpeg) 
this was without a doubt the scariest part of the build so far :sweat:
Getting the meter in and straight because beautiful as it is the enclosure does not have a straight line in it anywhere to measure from so eyeballing was the only way.  
Taped up for the charge port and switch.
![IMG_1034|375x500](upload://13H4BGeHABwIl8zvuOTdUN4cAi7.jpeg) 
back to the drive to get some netting on (I know using a lighter for shrink tube is ghetto af)
![IMG_1036|375x500](upload://glbMIYPuOoLk9grJ9uALqaZ3Uk4.jpeg) 
Final connections outside the board and doing the lock shrinks to avoid those disconnected bullets.
(loving those idlers though locks the mounts so well too)
![IMG_1037|375x500](upload://949Zbjw3JBtM2x5fRw9BFv0kNQD.jpeg) 
Loving the way the grommetts look but on the next i won't use those usb's they are too huge and look like nipples.  They are waterproof though and that was the thinking behind it  Still reminds me of the underside of a pregnant dog though.
![IMG_1039|375x500](upload://dXKjiaaWTtCClSQ9oBErOLSptqm.jpeg) 
Some silicon in the grommetts for a bit more protection and a cable tie to lock them in.
![IMG_1041|375x500](upload://u7wPtVc2heNr529OKCvRXIikaUF.jpeg) 
Next one is going to be a teeny tiny little charge only bms though.  That is a big bitch.
![IMG_1044|375x500](upload://7I8IlK2kJ4G9OIPESytZB2CL8oZ.jpeg) 
Getting some foam in there to keep it all snug.  Bit worried about the bms getting too warm but it has to be locked down tight.
![IMG_1045|375x500](upload://3IpBTqsAjESWz6MuOxo3yBQrQ32.jpeg) 
Battery is velcro'd down to the enclosure so it shouldn't move laterally but I'm going to foam all down the sides once I've configured the ppm as I have to get to the cabling.  The phase wiring needs locking with shrink but again without sensors I need to be able to swap if we are running the wrong way round which is inevitable.  Sorry about the last pic btw I was shaking with the thought of hooking it all up and something going bang.  All thats left to do is programming and get some new hardware for the truck wedges.  I'll probably run without the x thingys for now though as I'm over going bloody shopping.
Most satisfying build so far by a country mile this one because of the wonderful designing that made it possible.  I've created something beautiful by standing on the shoulders of better men :laughing:

Beautiful build.
I would personally put at least some capton tape over that BMS. Too many exposed connections were you could get a short.
I have capton + heat shrink over mine and the only thing that overheats are my motors.
That is with 30-40C temperatures outside

Thanks man!  yeah was concerning me a bit so I put some shrink over it and then some foam to isolate it from the focboxes and keep it locked in place.  I'll keep and eye on it regards heat.

And here she is in all her lovely evo glory.  Can't ride yet though due to shit skate shops in my area.  they sell the wedge risers but not the hardware needed to fit them.:face_with_raised_eyebrow:
Manana.  
Testing will commence first thing and I'll grab a gopro and take you all for a spin.

Thanks for reading and again for all the positive comments and encouragement.

@sk8l8r the reverse mounts do look good but note to self.  Set up your mounts after you have wedged the rear truck.  Got it all where I wanted it and then chucked the wedge on and had to strip it all down and re position.  Silly man.  
@Eboosted  all done now man and theres all the rest of the pics.  Just waiting for the hardware to open so I can bolt the trucks up and away we go. 
@taz Not a lover of full face lids on esk8 due to hearing things coming.  I do use my bike full face if I'm being stupid though.  Got a good certified open face that I use regularly.

Open face are great until this happens

If I am to ride faster than 30-35km/h I always grab the full face lid.

wow lucky escape.  Yeah man like I said I grab my shoei full face when I'm going to be going fast or testing a new build just like later on.  Bike jacket with kevlar goes on too just in case, but when I am just cruising around I like to hear the idiots in cages coming.  Been longboarding and skating all my life so street facing is not an unexpected phenomenon and kind of learned how to fall too.  My worst crashes in esk8 have been due to silly drivers pulling out and one even nudged me going past and put me in a front yard.  Risks and rewards though imo.  If it wasn't dangerous it would not so much bloody fun.  Glad you weren't too badly hurt there man and thanks for the advice. :sunglasses:

Hey mate thanks real pleased with how it turned out!  Man with a dual build you need two.  One for each vesc if you run split ppm.  Even with canbus you would still need to be able to do each motor detection seperately.  I'm not entirely sure about the can bus set up though because I don't run it but this will be getting a bluetooth adapter and can bus in the future so I can update from my phone. Then the holes for the usb's will get some shred light chucked in there.
Sorry I can't be more help but have a scoot about with the search function and you can get a definite answer.

First ride was a lesson.  A lesson in riding a true DH deck.   Was wobbling all over the place because I rode it like a flat thing.  I've been riding boards in different activities all my life and needed to understand the evo before it revealed itself to me and wow did it reveal itself.  The best board I've ever ridden by a country mile.  Lock your back foot in and solid as a rock.   what a beast!

Been running for 3 days now and I'm getting more and more used to it.  Kind of have to meditate a little to calm myself before a ride to stay relaxed because thats the key to this power.  Chill and enjoy.  Man its insanely fast even on my fairly conservative settings.  Perfect cruiser on the normal maytech riding mode and an animal on the full setting. Still have to do some more bushing tests and its time for a strip down as its been 3 days.  See whats rattled loose.
@Skunk  have to wait for my son to get back from overseas (hes got the gopro)

Hey man, Yeah I wanted to keep the edge free of holes for water ingress etc so got a couple of cable gland nut grommets.  They were locally sourced from an electronic shop over here but are pretty generic.  In their true form though they are too big and stuck out a mile so I cut the cable gland section off and was left with a threaded tube.  Then I heat shrunk the cable covering and pulled the whole thing into the tube and filled it with silicon.  Used a couple of zip ties to stop the cables moving in and out and seems to be working out so far.  If you have room in the enclosure you can reverse them and use the gland nut to tighten them up but not an option for me because of that giant bms.
