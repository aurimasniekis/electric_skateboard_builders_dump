I think you have to get new eac too.   If you are getting new esc you should just get 2 fsesc 4.12 for $100 and rc remote for $20.  At the end you have a DIY board and not a wowgo.

then their is no point in getting the tb 6355, the esc is actually the bottleneck, not the motors :stuck_out_tongue:

Are you saying the focbox unity isn't good enough?

no im saying there is no reason to get better motors when you have a cheap esc

in fact, your declaration with the dual 6355 will probably be even slower as your wowgo esc is designed for hub motors

Ooooh I see!  No I am using a belt drive esc from dicky ho.  I will be switching it out once I get the cash. But I just wanted something to tide me over in the time being so I went with a cheap esc which is all I could afford at the time.
