Hey guys.. Here's something I've been working on.. first prototype wasn't "solid" enough so going to have to change a few things on it and do more testing.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/d/bdf4c3e589bee986267682f581d6286a6530fee8.jpg" width="690" height="229">

Please forgive the crooked motor mounts this isn't the final photo. I originally tried to make it universal that way only one motor mount would be produced but looks like we'll need to do a left hand/right hand option :cry:.

I've always wanted a hybrid setup. Instead of re-inventing the wheel Trampa has a great set of options and colors! So I built it off Trampa. MBS are harder to get a hold of and building a high performance setup you might as well go with high quality components.

**Trampa Street & Urban Carver**

Basically, it's a TRAMPA Street Carver & Urban Carver setup - universal and interchangeable. Swap the wheels..

However, there is one issue. Trampa suggests the difference from the Street & Urban is for the 7" pneumatics the truck hangers are flipped to allow for more lean due to the larger wheel size so if you were to switch or swap the setup from Street Wheels to Pneumatics the hanger would have to flip. But I'm pretty sure you can have it on one side and it'll be fine. Haven't tested that yet though.

**Mechanical Kit Setup**

I'm enjoying the Support Bar + Support Bracket setups like on the Trampa MTB Setup. It's rock solid with the bar + brackets. Trampa MTB Setup has square trucks so it makes life much easier when making a solid mount for it. The Street Carver Trucks got some elegant curves so harder to make a solid "universal" motor mount.

This setup will fit Dual 6374 motors with 20mm wide belts for both 83mm/90mm Flywheels and 7" Pneumatics TRAMPA. The 20mm Drive Wheel and Motor Pulleys will be interchangeable with the TORQUEBOARDS Trampa MTB Kit as well.

**Battery Setup**

Simple setup would be to use an S3 T5500 case or similar which will bolt to the center that way you can build a much bigger battery pack Ex. 10S13P.  Inside dimensions - 9.37â€³ long 7.34â€³ wide 6.08â€³ deep

**What do you guys think? Would this be something you'd like to ride/build? Any suggestions.**

I personally love my trampa urban Carver with 7inch pneumatics more than any of my other boards. For me it boils down to these four as my biggest positives: 
-it takes all the road vibrations away making it an ideal long distance Carver
-you can go anywhere with dual drive (it's wicked fun on the beach)
-drifting is fun 
-no foot bindings to hassle with; just get on and ride like a normal board 

I guess my 2 cons would be my current mount, and using car esc's instead of the vesc. I made the dual rear mount myself in order to keep the build under $1,000, but it has a little bit of vertical play(belt is staying aligned fine, but I can hear it rattling up and down when I'm flying over rough terrain), and won't last forever with how I'm riding.  

Also, do you plan on making a mounting kit for the urban Carver? I know you mentioned it's a little more difficult with the hanger, but whether it is you or @Kaly, I think people building urban carvers would like another mounting option; especially since the full sized emtb mounts are sold by multiple people in all different versions while the urban carvers have next to nothing.  

You are definitely going to like it!

@cmatson - It's mostly difficult with making a universal mount for mounting w/ the hanger in the "street carver" position and the "urban carver position" since they're flipped and I'd like a one mount fits all but doubt it.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/b/db8bfa8cb9eb706f81a16c98dea9919c56a61eaf.jpg" width="690" height="218">

Same truck on both setups but street carver has the "nice" looking side and the urban carver has the backside of the hanger.. it's flipped.

The photo above is the first prototype. I think Kaly has just the motor mount. I actually enjoy the support bar + support bracket with the motor mount to provide extra durability and so it's rock solid.

I definitely like the idea of the street/urban carver though. Literally, the hills out here now (since I moved to TX) are mostly grass hills at parks and less actual "uphill" riding like in SF. So finding a hilly area is hard out here - gotta go pneumatics :slight_smile: and climb the grassy areas.

But yeah, can't wait to ride it.. and the Trampa MTB Setup.

@barajabali - lol I know.. I was thinking about it like uh.. 37V 32,500mah hahah.. on a longboard that's something like 74 miles range. I suppose you can put that on a street carver..leg's would fall off before I finished the pack.

ya, seems like you'd need to design an upside-down "T" shape so it would be reversible. 

This was the hanger shape I used for my mounts, so you'd almost have to just overlay on on top the other so it can work from either directions.

Hi, we have two brackets and two carbon panels for the Trampa carver. The two different brackets are used for the two different mounting positions of the hanger (SC and UC bracket = Street Carve and Urban Carve)
BOTH CARBON PANELS FIT BOTH BRACKETS! One carbon panel is short the other one longer. You can use the long panel for the interchangeable street and urban setup, while the short one only fits the street setup. Its like Lego....
You can easily keep the hanger in the Urban Carve position when using 90mm wheels.
The only issue is less ground clearance.
It really depends on your terrain.

Forgot to say that: We have moulds being made for a pneumatic 6" tire. It will fit the Hypa and Superstar hubs. Low profile high PSI, low roll resistance technology.
The solid 5" PU tire will also fit our hubs. In future you can ride 83mm, 90mm, 125mm PU +  6" and 7" pneumatic tires. We will offer some more different tire treads for the 7" range this year.

So the Trampa Carver will have tons of wheel options coming up!

We currently make the moulds. Things don't happen over night, especially if you want to assure the best quality possible. We just made some protos in ultra high rebound 74a. Very prommissing....
Using the same hub its your choice: 5"PU, 6" Pneumatic or 7" Pneumatic. The Hanger always stays in Urban Carve position.

We will soon come up with this radical design. Its the ultimate machine under your feet.

You will be able to upgrade our current Carvers. Please don't send us any requests for this Product. We will make it available ASAP and will get back to you.

@Randyc1: just an illusion. We will assure that the Carver will have tons of wheel options.

We will offer three different 7" pneumatic tires, a 6" pneumatic tire, the 125mm Urethane tire in different hardnesses and the regular 83 and 90mm street wheels. This way the carver will become the most versatile board you can imagine.
The battery compartment is made from the same material as the deck, super strong and really really protective - Not just an ABS plastic cover to keep the dirt and moisture away.

Looks amazing, count me in for one of these when you're ready - checks all the boxes of what I was looking for and haven't so far managed to put together myself :) 
(Drop deck + small pneumatics, or those 5" PU - reckon that's just what you need for a commuter board in the UK.. Some nice builds like that posted on here, but those type of wheels aren't so easy to get hold of, most that I've seen have machined their own custom ones..)

There is no difference between the trucks! Urban and Street Trucks are the same Trucks. The only difference is the way they are put together (hanger reversed or in MTB position). This board uses the trucks with hangers in MTB position (non reversed). Its not a big job to change the hanger oriantation.

@whitepony The holes are a nice feature but they will always clash with the demand for wide battery boxes. Our battery enclosures are nearly as wide as the deck, so the holes are not what you want. A handle is also not what you want. The Flex and vibrations would kill it sooner than later + it looks funny IMHO. Boards also tend to hit a curb once a while and the handles would snap in that case. 
I will try to offer a longboard with a "holy" shape not clashing with the battery enclosure. 
We also made a slim battery enclosure ( one row of cellls) for short distance boards. This would work in combination with the holes in the deck.

Is it nessesary to go that Big on a Urethane Street tire (125mm) ?

Or is it to compensate for reversed Urban Hanger ??

I would think 100mm would be more than enough for a smooth ride, without raising board height more than nessesary ?

If you want to use our hubs, 125 is the minimum. You still want some meat on top of the hub. Thin Urethane makes your ride a bit bumpy. 
You can use any wheel you like on our Carvers. You can even ride with the "Urban Carve hanger position" and use 83mm wheel. It all depends on your terrain. The 125mm wheels fly over all the cracks in the pavement. I like them + they give your Board that "low profile tire look". This is a serious machine to attack the URBAN environment - not a toy board.
The low profile 6" pneumatics will also be aded to the range this year. 
All we want to do is: Provide a lot of choices for you guys, so that you can make your dream come true + try out differnet things.

You're so right Frank! And I've spent too much money for cheap things because of saving money, that's lost money! For example i have a Kheo Bazik mountainboard, the hubs wobble like hell! It took me hours to fit a sprocket! 

Also i have all together now for my second electric longboard build BUT i have a problem now. I saw the urban/street carver and fell in love :heart_eyes: I stopped my buid because this is exactly what i need, top quality!

So @trampa i would like to order an electric urban carver and have 2 questions about it:
I would slightly prefer 6" wheels or different tyres. Is it about a few weeks or a couple of months until you release them? If it's later that year i think i go with the 7" for now.
Second is about the deck, i have 74kg and like flex, so i think the 14-ply is alright for me. I just wonder if it's too flexy at higher speed. But i don't like stiff decks, i need flex. It's hard to find out.

Hi @rich, You can pick up the 14 Ply, that's perfect. If you ad a battery enclosure it will stiffen up the board a bit.
The 7" are fantastic. The 6" will take a while to make. We are talking months. You can swap them later,  when your 7" tires are worn out. Pick a deck without holes if you plan to stick your batteries underneath the board.

## \#50 Posted by: trampa Posted at: 2017-02-11T23:22:07.076Z Reads: 399

To be able to use the HS11 Deck you need to use the wide trucks to prevent wheel bite. The street carve mounts work best with the street carve trucks. Theoretically you could use the street carve motor mounts on a wide MTB truck. In that case you need to CNC the edges of the hanger body. Maybe filing the Hanger body down, so that the edges are nice and square would also work. 

The Carveboard Deck is the result of a lot of testing. Its shape was developed to assure clearance towards the wheels and the ground. I would go for the carveboard deck!
The HS11 Deck would sit lower towards the ground and in consequence it could touch the ground on extreme leans.

You can CNC the material but it tends to melt when it gets to hot. Your mill bit won't like the fibers and will suffer. You are not the first to ad CNC work to our decks. It's proven to work.

Hi @CluelessSurvivor, using the urethane wheels on a MTB will require to use a Carveboard Mount. Its possible but you would need to file nice and clean edges to the square hanger body. Pulleys for the 5" Urethane wheels will be available in 2017.

Would the mountainboard now perform as a carveboard, or mountain and carve trucks have incompatible baseplates?

The Baseplates are semi compatable. The Vertigo MTB baseplate has no inner spring position just like the infinity MTB baseplate.
The Infinity MTB baseplate has no cutout, so its quite easy to drill the two missing holes for the inner spring position. All you need is a drill and a M8 thread cutter + some skill. The Vertigo MTB baseplate can't be upgraded since the cutout is to big. If you don't need the inner spring position, you can use MTB baseplates with carve hangers. 

If you own a Holy Pro MTB deck, your nose cutout will be in the same shape as the Vertigo MTB baseplate. There is no flesh for drilling the spring adjuster holes you need for the inner spring position! I have not tried to mount carveboard trucks to a holy pro deck. We made the carveboard deck for a reason.

Ok I got it ðŸ˜‰. I don't doubt you spend months of planning before entering a new product into the market, so probably you already thought about this: it would be really cool if you could start selling one hybrid mountain/street board that could be easily converted (as easy as swapping one hanger).
Afterall it is just a matter of few more grams on the baseplate.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/7/67d9ff96812af8f68aa4c2df5ac4d8c02d1bf94c.png" width="301" height="500">

We fought about it two years back. Its possible on the infinity range. Truth is: Most people don't convert their boards. The urban carver is really what you want in that case.
Trucks sit to far up the nose on the Holy Pro. Your deck could catch the ground on extreme leans. This is the reason for the creation of the carve deck range.

Yea most of your customers would rather have 2 boards instead of converting. But in the world of eskating it is not that doable to have â‚¬xpensive electronics, batteries and motors on 2 separate boards. I would personally prefer to spend 5 minutes swapping hangers and invest the money to motorize a single deck.
Anyways I ll let you know if the mod will work out.

@fedestanco - Just use the Urban Carver style setup and keep the trucks mounted in that way and swap between the 90mm/7" Urban wheels and the future wheels which Trampa will have in the future.

You'll just need to swap wheels, belts. You'll get less lean when in the 90mm street wheel setup but that's the only way I think it would work if you want it to be a true hybrid.

Thanks for the ideas @torqueboards, although I was fancying about having a board that could perform 100% as well as a MTB, and after changing a piece or 2,  could ride as well as a street carver on the asphalt; no halfways, the best in each environment.

I must say, this is the first time Im exited about a commercial non DIY product in a long time! hopefully it becomes available before autumn 2017, I could see this becoming my bad weather autumn+ board.

combination of the carve board with the hub + urethane wheels / alternative pneumatics once leaves and gravel is on the streets, the nicely fitting and hopefully splash resistant enclosure with the stealthy low maintenance esk8 or nowind direct drive gear mmhmm nom nom nom!

@trampa any feeling when this might become available - urethane hubs & enclosure for trampa carvers?

also an absolute killer feature would be mud/splashguards on the wheels. not the kind of lame wheel shields, but something trampa'esque stylish! :smiley:

These panels come to custom length and need some extra work your end. We left the edges longer, so you can adopt them to your Board. Same sturdy Trampa Material... The End Bungs are not yet available. 3D Printing them is an option, Styrofoam or other foam materials would also do the job...

This is long overdue. I love my Pneumatic wheels but got a flat for the third time. I noticed how much an improvement my ABEC 97's was over the Evolve 83mm wheels, so really cannot wait for the 125mm wheels.

Wheels in that pic is absolutely great! Another problem I have is that I need a flexible battery compartment so I would not need to split into two small boxes and by "Gummie" box I assume it is flexible enough to go on a Loaded Vanguard board.

Larger 125mm wheels plus a more flexible board would be the grail for me and you are answering my prayers for 2017.

Hi Brad, its defenately flexible enough to go on the underside of a random Longboard. The Box will not split since it is fiber reinforced in 4-5 layers. With regards to punctures: I don't have these issues to much. It can happen, just like it can happen on a bike. Bikes all have pneumatics and its prooven to work. We will reinforce the 6" tire against punctures, which will ad to the price but will give you more confidence in the reliability.

The Trampa Hub is to wide to fit onto a standard caliber II. Width of the Hub ( outer side Bearing to outer side bearing) is roughly 34mm. 22650 is to big. Open Cross section is roughly 150 * 25mm. You can offset the Box from the Deck.

@Randyc1: We slit the box to ad the flex. Please look at the image of the Carver I posted. You will need to do that anyway to get the box bend into shape.

I'm looking for a street carver with wide hangers as the build posted by yourself on the previous post with the yellow stickies. That's amazing! 

That way I could mount the AT wheels in the future and have an e-MTB ready for offroading. 

I chose the ultimate trucks as I don't like the truck width found on urban carver mini trucks too much. I like the look and stance of the wide 16" trucks on street and MTB applications a lot. 

However, I'm not 100% if this setup would be detrimental for carving under street use with Abec 11 97mm wheels. I'm hoping it would ride awesome. But if you tell thus this setup is not good then let me know if you would suggest to stick with the 12.5" street carver mini trucks 

I'm traveling to USA next weekend but will only stay until Saturday, so I'd like to place the order for the street carver deck, trucks and bearings, hope you could make it ASAP to get them parts on time.

It will carve just fine! The axle pins are pretty long (53mm). Mounting our MTB hubs with 8,7or 6" pneumatics is no problem. I never mounted Stickies with our pulleys and motor mounts to that truck. I need to check that! 

You would need to ad the holes for the inner spring position to the hanger. Easy job, using the baseplate as template. I'll post an image and check the ability to mount the streetwheels with pulley system and motor mounts.

Hello Frank!

So I am currently using ABEC 11 flywheels on my eBoard and wanted to move to your pneumatic wheels (8 inches hypa).
While browsing I noticed that your wheels have like the same looking core as mine. I use an adapter to fit the bigger pulley to the wheel itself. Now I wanted to know if this adapter also fits to your wheels.
The adapter: http://aliendrivesystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/abewc-hub-only-2.jpg

@trampa Is this calculator correct??

I see 33 km/h in 12s with 15t motor pulley and the 66t hypa/superstar slave pulley.

That is very slow  and would drop below 30 km/h when battery is at around 30/40%, are you going to make smaller 46t pulleys? Maybe I'm missing something?

We are pressing the paddel down as hard as we can. I'll post some protos to Nowind for testing as soon as we have them.

@torqueboards are you still making urban carver mounts that fit 6374s? Or just the MTB  ones?

@trampa Sorry for bringing up an old post; I'm looking to do a similar build;  how do I have a custom cart setup so I can order a board built like this?  I'm wanting to electrify it as well, so I was looking for a street carve deck in 14 ply, with the upper base plate and ultimate hangers so I can eventually swap between stickies and pneumatics.

i know the hangers are reversible for the street or urban option but i cant get my head around why, does it effect the steering/response/height. sorry for not understanding just want to get clear on how they work as i'm looking at making a board up 

cheers

If you ride street wheels you need to reverse the hanger, so that you gain ground clearance. Otherwise the lowest portion of the hanger sits to close to the ground for an average ride on roads with potholes etc.

You can reverse the hanger if you want to switch to pneumatics later. Wheel base gats wider in regular position and a bit narrower in reversed ( street wheel) position.
