hey,guys, i've been thinking about one issue, the flexibility of the deck is always limited especially when ride over bumps on the road，it's not comfortable for me, so i start to find a solution to get better shock absorption, since there is no place for me to assemble a spring on the truck, or between the deck and truck, so i finally decide to remove the boardside bushing and change with a short Spring ring. and guess what ? it's really much more comfortable riding on the road even with bumps but same time i also found another issue with this refit work, the steering and stable are not so good as before. it's weak and too easy get oversteer, this is not safe for higher speed during the riding, but i do like the comfortable feeling, so i changed to use stronger and larger diameter spring rings. i already tested two yellow and blue springs with 20mm*20mm (length and diameter) it's not good enough i will continue to test /red/brown springs with 25mm*25mm. to find the best solution, and post here.
if you guys have any idea welcome to share and discuss here, thanks!

Horrible idea. No damping--->speed wobble galore

true.

@G-Motionboard that's a terrible idea for a litany of reasons, not the least of which bud is it's a serious hazard to your safety.  

The spring can't gain purchase on the washer with any consistency (it can move).

Here's the best board feel build I know of, for the money.  I can't remember who typed this out first here on our forum yet they nailed it.  Good hunting.

thanks, man, yes you are right, no damping even i only changed the boardside bushing,  i just wanna try and check what it will be.

appreciate! once i finish my test i'm sure to try some more suitable bushing and also try some more flexibility deck.

Eh, no real suspension dampening, but that may not be a problem.
But there's still steering dampening from the roadside bushing.

And there's still friction dampening from the pivot and bushing as well.

I think this is a great experiment.

great thanks! your link brings me a lot of useful information. expect bad shock absorption on bumps road, we also need care about the speed wobble on higher speed, and there are also some people discussing and trying to solving this issue. so we can say in fact it's about shock absorption on vertical direction between the truck and deck, and eliminate speed wobble on horizontal direction. now it's more interesting!

No problems, but I may as well tell you that as an engineer(or sales) in a Chinese eskate factory we are typically not very interested in the typical product suite there is no doubt sitting in the background.

Also creating threads as questions wherein they are really vehicles for product placement will be frowned upon, especially if you start creating lots of threads asking ‘what does anyone's think of this?’

As for you springs, read the thread I linked, basically you are going to get flamed today, weatherman says wear asbestos

really appreciate about your advice, i got your idea, and more important thing is i learned a lot of things from the thread of your link, and i have a new idea now which maybe works much better since i realize the key point of this issue. i will try to test my new idea asap.

Ok I’ll bite, how can a spring that size provide damping for a typical man-sized man and not this guy?![image|236x300](upload://imytbekkd52ksnP8KEBfAjUiSHR.jpeg)

Please incorporate the stabilizers, it seems the site that @skateboardstabilizer created is now up for grabs, so a total sprung solution could be possible

i'm afraid no, the idea of skateboardstabilizer maybe works on solving the issue of speed wobble, but sure not works for shock absorption.

What is the spring rate of your spring?

Have you factored in this equation for the typical baseplate angles in use?
ACF=COS∠A°

```
the Yellow(TF) one is 50~58% test result: too soft
the Blue(TL) one is 40~48% test result: too soft
the Red(TM) one is 30~38% test result: good for shock absorption on bumps road, but easy got speed wobble, it means no problem with lower speed riding but when ride by higher speed, it's dangerous cause of the truck will be not stable enough.
and next one is Green(TH) but i can't assemble it now since the boardside bushing is just 20mm(length) and the Spring is 25mm(length) and i can't press it to fi with the screw bolt, i can do this with yellow/blue/even red springs but too hard with this, so i need cut if shorter or get a longer screw bolt to try. but i already give up this now, i need try a new way.

I just don’t understand how you can find the space to fit a spring with a viable spring rate(?) that has compression left in it with an adult on board.

 In my experience the thickness of the spring profile would need to be as thick as a pencil, that’s not what I’m seeing ^

Here is a spring rate table, % is not a valid figure for spring rate, maybe that is something specific to the application those springs were originated produced for

Who cares! Let the guy put a spring on his board and ride. If it works then hooray for him. If it doesnt work, he'll go back to the drawing board. Science and equations aren't needed and they make noobs think way too much.

Because those springs can't work and we are talking about safety given it's a vital suspension component & this is a product advert thread, for all those reasons I care

Springs works if you only change the boardside bushing and ride with lower speed less than 20km/h, it's not a difficult work, you can try it, then you will find the difference. but i admit it's not safe for higher speed, so we need to continue find a better solution.

That's not gonna fly for 60% of people here.

If really in the early stages of product design and openly admitting it may not work & not just trying to hawk springs then this is the right place to do it.

But there will be a lot of resistance (dad joke intended)

yes, agreed, most time i also ride the board over 20km/h, anyway, this little test is just for my own board improvement at this moment, im not going to make it on any product design at least not this moment. however in my opinion skateboard with electric already got something difference with the traditional skateboards, people won't ride normal skateboard on bumps roads because their wheels don't have enough power and if they force the board to ride over it, people will be 100%fall off, but this is not a issue for them because they can just pick it up and carry it easy, but e-board rider would like ride over the roads even with bumps because they have power and they don't want to carry a heavy board to walk, also normal skateboard don't have a speed over 20mph or even 30mph so they don't the problem of speed wobble, but e-skateboard have, what i want to say is the all the design for normal sakteboard are ok, but for electric skateboard we still have room for improvement. if we back to the design principles of the skateboard truck and think more about it. we will learn and realize more things.

So I think the biggest problem you're going to have is that a spring still needs to provide the same support as a bottom bushing, so its going to need to have the a similar stiffness, otherwise it won't push into the top bushing enough for it to do its job.

The only suspension benefit therefore is going to be a better energy return, and possibly just a very slight increase in suspension travel due to a more linear progression in stiffness than bushing compression.
But you're not going to change the suspension travel drastically over what bushings can do.

Even if its not providing an noticeably improved shock absorption and ride comfort, that doesn't mean its failing in suspensions other role of keeping the wheels in contact with the ground, which in longboards often only requires only very tiny amounts of travel, but may benefit from higher rebound.

Also I do see it as something that maybe can retain the hanger a little bit better. A bushing can compress side to side in the bushing seat allowing for slop in the hanger, but a spring is really only compressible along its length, and can support side to side loading.

@G-Motionboard I applaud you for the attempt, Good idea even if it didn't work out.  Keep thinking.  Most people aren't trying new ideas, minor changes and a rehash of the same old thing.  So good on you.

and my new idea is combining the bottom bushing with Spring together, i need the support from the bottom bushing and also want to absorb the shacking because what we are riding is a electric skateboard, we need that for better experience. even if i fail, i still learn a lot of things and on the other hand, i also have other alternatives.
like customized high-elastic bottom bushing same time with softer wheels.
