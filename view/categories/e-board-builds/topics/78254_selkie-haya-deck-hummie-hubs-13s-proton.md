Taking this to a build thread

**Selkies**  (also spelled  *silkies* ,  *sylkies* ,  *selchies* ) or  **Selkie folk**  ([Scots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language):  *selkie fowk* ) meaning " **Seal Folk** "[[a]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selkie#cite_note-1) are mythological beings capable of [therianthropy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therianthropy), changing from [seal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped) to human form by shedding their skin.

I was ruminating on battery config on @bevilacqua GB thread but that‚Äôs no good for fleshing things out, here is better.

While I was threatening to get together a compression pack with cell level fusing I went through several iterations of some cell holders...all sucked for one reason or another. The total height to work with is just slightly over 20mm and width wise not much better. I was aware of @agniusm 2s4p packs which lend themselves very nicely if you leave off the cover and make a plane cut bringing it down to just under 17mm, the cells will sit proud of that by about 2mm but should be ok with a little protection on top maybe 1mm silicone sheet. You can see it here without the plane cut

I printed in ABS+ at 101% which wasn‚Äôt enough for my printer/filament so printing another version at 102% with the cut now. An order for cell tabs enough to build 12s4p is in now, less than ‚Ç¨30 delivered with the WINTERSALE coupon, thanks dude

If I‚Äôm feeling cheeky I may even run out an extra 4p pack to make 13s

In other news some Riptide bushings/pivot cups on the way from sickboards (along with some surfrodz stuff for something else)![image|666x500](upload://6aURSQ8aqEscy0gPW6n7xXbvsmH.jpeg)

It‚Äôs a heretical print in ABS for which I no doubt will take a lot of flak given no enclosure and no ventilation, normal room temp 19c, I opened a window later and will stay out

Please take good pics and explain before you seal it all up in there.  I‚Äôm doing the same.  Looking into using a solid compressor instead of the Poron foam though w imbedded contacts. Silicone solid for such a thing needs be custom molded and can‚Äôt pour the good stuff at home so using Poron too likely

The balance wires are a concern, grounding any of them out against the aluminum deck would be a disaster. 
My solution was to sugru them into position![image|666x500](upload://abECTrP5L0ckyG5xdtgMY1rfR45.jpeg)

Everyone does it differently but I‚Äôd skip the kapton tape between all the cells facing the same way and instead put a complete wrapping or maybe something more abrasion resistant between the groups of four cells. The ends of the cell especially.  If the four facing the same way break through the sleeve and touch it‚Äôs no problem but if different groups of four were to contact then likely a fire.
You know.

I do this on my decks and put 1/8 and have even done 1/4 inch sponge neoprene from amazon under my grasp just like the pushin cushion and it does wonders for your feet and gives you the ability to ride so much longer without getting that foot ache fatigue. Only works with certain decks I feel but I do it on any board that I can. Highly recommend on builds you travel longer distances with.

I‚Äôd say so from what Jansen said, this is really thin closed cell foam in the cheap mat I got, about 3mm uncompressed. 

I‚Äôm still working it to get happy with the fitment especially around the ends, there‚Äôs an assortment of silicone sheet thickness on the way

The printer runs a boden volcano, not good for flex, so scissors to trim up the stringing

You can combine the bms with a balance board. I have a 13S laying around that I could mail you. You would need to solder the balance wires to the connector of the BMS/PCB. Staked over it should take the same space

The 16A ones are tiny, but JST-PH.

There are 2 wire (common charge/discharge) or 3 wire versions. Get the 2 wire if bypassing discharge.

Cheap. Waterproof.

EDIT if your bms doesn't balance, the balance wires are just for cell over and under voltage protection?

where you get it?  I got them before but cant find the 13s version anymore.  


curious how having one with having so many more connections, what happens when a wire breaks and maybe even shorts the cell and damages it and then you don't know and charge it.  I guess glue it well or something.  Its nice to be able to touch the cells while charging or a temp sensor on all of them could be send to the vesc w Bluetooth right?!  maybe hopefully possibly yes

So I was going about switching the rear baseplate of the Hummie drive from the Paris 50deg to a 35deg Randall and could not get a line-up.

It turns out the Randall only have old school pattern which is really jank as you can see, hoping that @drangboards can help me out there when they get more PNL stock.

http://randal.com/comp-and-dh-35-base-plate/

Or....
http://downhill254.com/redrilling-randal-comp-luge-baseplate/

Still working this design, need to bring up the wing 3.8mm to meet the base of the deck, otherwise just about there. 

The beauty of these 83mm hubs is a low wheelbite coefficient,.or something.

Take a look, there's a 5.5mm charge port, 5 X 5mm LEDs, in translucent red to maximise rear lighting, the possibility is that the entire unit may glow a little from the LEDs, if not then Red increases speed 14% anyways.

The rear hub to come off again, looking at either dewedging 3deg with the Rayne bamboo angle or a 7mm flat hard plastic riser from Independent, as luck would have it the last bolt decided to seize and even round the nut, so it will be punished, but not by the Dremel which can‚Äôt reach but the old fashioned way![image|666x500](upload://sDh5jm2FWMYiBZizkrj2m69zXur.jpeg)

[/quote]

I've had so much trouble with galling with S/S bolts and nuts... Feels like 20% seize when removing, and have to cut them off. A dab of oil when installing seems to help a bit.

I use one of these as the executioner

Because of the frequency of the problem I've considered switching to normal non-rust-proof steel for either the nut or the bolt or both.
