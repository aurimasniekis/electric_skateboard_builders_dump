Hello 

This built is the result of a discussion i had with the evolve carbon GT guys on their tread on this forum as a result i thought that we need it to build a "hot swap" board to have the urethane wheels and the pneumatics on the same build and had to be something pleasing to the eye as well. 

After exploring what to use I decided on the street carver from @trampa since the architecture of this board is perfect for the objective in mind and is really beutifull thing to look at.

The main problem I encounter was the cross section of the trucks, not the more simple shape to find an anchor point

 <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/d/ad0ef73e4b3175ca190b9ebb929f1974563739ca.JPG" width="690" height="389">  

And the flexibility of the deck was sabotaging my goal of having a slick beautiful build, because I was going to have to mount the battery on top. But being hardheaded like most here I decided that was not too much of a problem. 

So first step was to find a solution to the battery issue. That resulted to be extremely hard to tackle since every approach send me back to the square box on top of the back truck 😡  
So I leave it alone, I had to sit on that. 

Then the actual first step was the motor mounting system inspire by the big amount of motor mount design in this forum I settle in making it a 2 piece assembly that allows for the motor plate to be able to move in order to accommodate the different diameters of wheels intended to be use on this setup. 

Something I wanted to achieve was to have the minimum distance from motor to pulley on the 2 configuration in order to keep the design as compact as posible.

I played around with few different design and ended on this one 
Here with the urethane clones

Here with trampa wheels

to keep the mounts as compact as posible I designed a wheel pulley 62T-5M-15W with mounting holes for the Superstar wheel HUB. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/e/fe1a12866f510b4b5899685fdd5dc720043e4739.JPG" width="690" height="388">

This pulley size allows a minimum distance for the motor plate when the urethane wheel are in use.

And reliability when the pneumatics are in use. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/d/dd329852d8136190b8ceccbdbd7b6aafdcbc12f2.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Next was the issue with the wheels pulley for the urethane, i do not like the screws at all on the wheels. getting that thing center with the axel has been a headache 🤕 every time I have tried. 
The Solution design a slap 👋 in pulley like enertion and others have but with clearance to fit the trampa mini trucks, this has been my solution so far.

A bottom view form fusion 360.

This pulleys are 40T-5M-15W that works very reliable on my vanguard build with the MBS 100mm wheels.

The pulley fit the 97 mm ABEC11 flywheels and the 97 mm Clones flywheels but the ones with the thick walks and fit perfectly the trampa stickys wheels just awaiting for them to start selling the 90mm wheels. 

I like to use 5M HTD 15mm wide belts for all my builds because I think are easy to source and more reliable than the 12 mm belts. besides do not produce an excessive amount of drag helping extend the battery range. 

Some motors choices 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/c/ac185f3efa15070f0fa1fa7eb17d0f4bf18e32c8.JPG" width="690" height="388">

At the end decided to go with the 6355 motor 230Kv because the 50mm motor do not perform so well with the big pneumatics wheels.

Next step is to machine the mounts from aluminum, for this I use my X-carve which in order to reliable cut the 1/4-1/2 in aluminum had to be stiffened thanks to the guys at inventables forum I got to do with one or 2 headaches alone the way but it works pretty good 😊 

Milling process

Now to fit it onto the board.

Latter my daughter suggested that the round motor plate she was not feeling it 😑 so I got back to drawing boards and come up with this ones. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/0/905811bad3ac6f7f978762a77247b68a722fdc95.JPG" width="690" height="388">

Once the mount phase was finish them had to go back to the flexibility and battery issue. With plenty of time to think about this I decided to go with a sectional approach to the battery assembly and the enclosure as well. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/e/8e3bc27958be457ad7e402d5d5cc8144382993de.JPG" width="690" height="388">

The structure of the battery is in 4 sections that are connected via high discharge flat wire to beach the gap of the enclosure. 

The enclosure is made out off 1/8 in ABS plastic vacuum formed to give the shape of the curvature of the deck

  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/a/7ad0f18f01f8bf4c0b2158eb63ca663eae7ec750.JPG" width="666" height="500">

The main issue with this battery design is that the deck is small and the dimension of the enclosure have a tight fit. But if done with care can fit perfectly.

 <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/9/f9d5dfdae0644cb34fa8e9106231abb2db8ceaaf.JPG" width="690" height="388">

Just the corners need to be trimmed. 
To protect the battery I use 300L 3M double sided tape on the perimeter of the enclosure and clear plastic to make it waterproof and on the joint gaps I use triple layer tape to make it water tight as well. 

Then use a layer of abrasion resistant plastic sheet to use as a barrier between the deck and the battery to prevent the friction from damaging the water seal. 

At the end the battery works flawlessly. This enclosure is designed for a 12S-4P battery but the VESC capacitors bank  have to be modified here I went with a 10S 4P in the enclosure.

For a next build for a client I am going with the 12S-4P. That is in progress. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/1/f1ec91491d65f8fbeb496d78b650bba77cff2a19.JPG" width="666" height="500">

After a few headaches this is the result

could I get your milling settings and preferred bits?? because your pieces came out great!! 

I made these mounts for my Urban carver (same board as yours), but had a couple cuttings issues; still trying to figure out the best combination of bit speed and milling speed to prevent the bit from heating up to fast and getting ruined.

You need to remove the chips from the work piece because that is what damage the bits. 

I'll send it to you when I get home.

@Kaly That is some mighty fine work you've done there. Such a beautiful, clean look. I'd take that over an Evolve any day. I'm really liking the whole cross skating 2 in 1 platform idea. The more builds I see, the more I want a Trampa. Hadn't really considered the Urban Carver until now. This project is really something special though, especially building around the flex like that. 

Keep us posted on how it performs in the long run. Can't wait to see some videos! :thumbsup:

@Kaly First off, WELL DONE, sir! Those are some awesome mounts! 
  
@cmatson I am also interested in your milling method... 
Bit? 
rates on xcarve?
spindle speed? 
Material?  

Highly impressive build! Keep up the really great work!

```
Can't remember the feed rates (since I wasn't happy with the result, I didn't bother to write them down), but I want to say I was at around 20,000rpm.

For the bit I used a 2 flute 1/4 inch aluminum bit for most of the cutting, and a 3 flute aluminum 1/8 inch bit for the more detailed stuff. 

Material was 1/2 inch 6061 series aluminum, which in hindsight was kinda overkill.. I think @Kaly's solution was much better to have a thick base and then a thinner plate that the motor mounts onto, but I (at the time) wanted it to be all one piece.

haha @Kaly  knows way more about the aluminum cutting than me, so I'm taking some notes :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Hello guys 
I'm back from vacations, super fun under the Dominican Sun ☀️ Some pics.

Now tha everybody is happy I get to go back to the sweatshop :slight_smile:

Tomorrow the weather is going to be sunny I'll make a video for the flexibility of the board with the sectional battery enclosure and how the board rides. 

@Mrmoonlight the inserts are m4

@Garrett42 I am in talks with a local metal shop to produce a batch of mount to sell but that will take a few weeks to be in production mean while I can machine a few with the xcarve next week after I resolve some leveling issues with the machine.

Could make a video showing the flex from the side? I plan on making something similar on the future but not sure how much clearance I will have from the enclosures, since I plan to go off-road sometimes on pneumatics

@Randyc1 
The ride is nice and stable the truck is 12.5 in wide and it carve like a charm.

The Trucks are the mini vertigo @trampa trucks you can get them [Here](http://www.trampaboards.com/mini-vertigo-street-carve-trucks--9525mm-hollow-steel-axles-p-12177.html) i am using the trampa Carve bearing  [here](http://www.trampaboards.com/carveboard-bearing--r6-2rs-abec-7--9525mm-x-22225mm-x-714mm--white-x-1-p-12095.html) this ones fit a normal skateboard wheel and the trampa 9.525 axel.

@Pedrodemio i recorded the flex but next time will do it with a tripod so can be more clear. if you are planning on pneumatics there will be more than enough clearance.   

@Riako
The flex on the board and the flywheels make the ride so smooth 
Finally have something that is easy on my knees :smile:    ( old basketball injury)

 To bad they don't have a 8mm axle, those Trampa bearing must use Smaller Ball Bearing to fit conventional Wheels.   Trampa Wheels must use Bigger Bearings  ?

Man, this is a really clean build.  I'd love to build a Trampa next.  I live in Las Vegas which is really dusty and rocky.  I gotta give you props on those motor mounts. Honestly, I liked both the angular and circular design.  Kudos from an aspiring builder! :+1:

@unik the motor mounts have variable distance from 85.00 mm to  101.00 mm to handle the pneumatics as the urethane wheels.

For a 90 mm center to center distance with 66T / 14T you definitely will need to use the belt tensioner.
you can check the distance [here](https://sdp-si.com/eStore/CenterDistanceDesigner).
one thing you will like to have in mind is the diameter of the motor vs the C to C distance because if you are too close to the truck the motor can hit the kingpin. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/c/2cc5c3550b1b9e418a860b83b6ef327631885fc8.jpg" width="592" height="404">

Hi there 
Super exited here :grin:

Today I received some mounts samples and aluminum motor pulleys and all terrain wheels too 

The AT wheels are HTD 5M-62T  for 15mm belt. 
The motor pulley is HTD 5M-16T for 15mm belt. 

I am trying to negotiate a price with the machine shop that take this thing to the least expensive side if things. 

Some pics now

@Kaly when possible could you check whats the consumption (Wh/Km or Wh/mi) on pneumatics? doing some sketch's here i may have found a way to put up to 10S10P with the electronics  in the middle section by laying the cells side by side rotated 90° , but it will depend on the consumption, i'm aiming on 60-70Km of range, more than that is dead weight (or range is never enough? :grinning:)

the street carve and the urban carve trucks are the same trucks just assemble in reverse.
The problem with the urban configuration is that you will not be able to run urethane wheels due to the shape of the hanger, because it will hit the floor with the urethane.

Just beware that too bearings damage the belt by flexing it too much, i was using 13mm bearings as tensioner and wasted a lot of belts until i realized this was the problem, going to try 19mm on the next weeks , that is the diameter of the my motor pulley and hopefully will work

Thank you for the advice, I'll be using 16mm bearings for the tensioner, my reasoning for the belt tensioner is as follows: 

As of now for the urethane configuration 40T/16T the tensioner is not needed because the Center to Center distance allows for proper belt grip on to the pulley. The same goes for the AT setup with 62T/16T.  

The belt tensioner will be useful for the different sizes of urethane and pneumatics wheels Trampa is planning to sell in the future, This way we are future proof :stuck_out_tongue: and the distance of the motor plate of mount can be reduce, so not to have the motors sticking out that far from the wheel, because that will damage the look of the whole set up. :tired_face:

## \#83 Posted by: Kaly Posted at: 2017-02-08T16:32:08.723Z Reads: 398

```
The coasting is the reason for the 230 Kv. 
 At higher kv the drag is minimum and if you take advantage of coasting properly the battery range can be increase and I willl take that every day. 

I am one of the guys that really prefer carving and coasting so the motor with lower Kv motors just kill the fun for me. 

Unless you ride in a area with a lots of hills then the lower Kv motors are a necessity in order not to overload the battery and ESC.

I think you will not like the idler then, from my experience they add a ton of drag. The best coasting experience i had was with 3M belts and no idler, unfortunately they can handle very low torque when using small pulley

I think this is pretty obvious.. @Kaly was just smart enough to point this out and make good reasoning.. I have observed this myself.. when I try to turn my 192kv motor.. there is quite a resistance to overcome by hand..

So yeah, kind of cool that @Kaly pointed this out.. as this does make  a difference, I believe.

Cant really discuss about the idler pulleys part in creating resistance.. I just know that tight belt is better than loose one.. so it's just something you gotta use...for a variety of reasons

You don't have to take it from me , You can test this for yourself :wink: 

install lower Kv motor and push your board around the neighborhood a couple of times then do the same with a set of high Kv motors on the board and let me know how it goes. 

@Pedrodemio 
you are right I don't use the idlers unless it is a last resource, but at this stage of production the cost of implementation of the anchor threaded hole is so inexpensive that will be a crime if I did not include this, even if is just for future use, IMHO I think is better to have the option and not need it than to need it and do not have it.

Does it really come that close to the tire? Ive got 15mm belt and I could fit 2 x 8mm bearings onto the screw + there were some more additional screws/washers on top of these..

I think this could be a problem for 25mm wide belts.. but not 155mm :slight_smile:
Though, unless your belt is really close to the wheel itself.. because of the sprocket being just a few mm off the tire.. so who knows actually..

On the trampa i don't know, but in my case i'm fitting dual motors on 195mm trucks, with 15mm belts and an additional bearing inside the motor mount, so i had to squeeze each milimeter that i could

As my design stands i had a 2mm clearance from belt to wheel, 1,5mm from belt to motor mount and 5 mm between the motors, so any larger wheel and the idler screw will colide with the wheel

I also took this approach so there is less gaps to little rocks enter the system 

Since the Trampa truck is wider you can put the belt farther from booth wheel and mount

ok, thanks, i think i'll do a 10s4p. I already have a bms and charger for 10s and 20 VTC5 18650 cells yet. I started to build a lightweight longboard with 10s2p for easy carrying but i saw the urban/street carver and had to order it yesterday. Who cares about lightweight :joy:

I have a question about regenerative braking in combnination with bms and 18650 cells, hope you can help me.
I use Sony VTC5 cells with 2600 maH. the max charge rate is 4A, that means 16A with 4p.
Is this really the maximum, 8A per motor on twin setup? What's your experience with regen. braking settings on vesc?
I used Lipo before with 50A charge rate, so no problem.

Second, i have a bms with different charging/discharging ports. I think i need a bms which uses the same port for charging and discharging to use regenerative braking, am i right?
I think for now i use it without regenerative braking until i have the correct bms.

## \#109 Posted by: Kaly Posted at: 2017-02-10T00:22:29.466Z Reads: 387

Well theoretically the braking with that type of BMS is a little compromise because the vesc will overload with the energy coming back and will release the brakes, but in practice many people are using those bms without much problems. in my personal expirience i have not try the bms with different ports so i can't tell you for sure.

My opinion about ''suggested'' battery range 
---
@rich I would definately go for bigger capacity pack, if I were you.. Lower cost might be appealing at first.. but once you start building it will be a lot harder to upgrade your pack later on.. of, course, you will be able to install additional parallel packs. but then again - more space / planning needed to fit them!

Personally, I think a ''good distance'' for these ''light commuter vehicles'' would be / is - **'15km / 9.3 miles'.** 

I've got a board which is able to **do about 8km** **(5miles).**. and there have been so many times when I would have rode more, If the battery allowed lol

Also, better capacity does not come alone for the range alone.. you can charge at faster rates while doing ''less harm'' to the batteries, which means you can more quickly ''pump back'' valuable Ah/Wh energy into your battery.. 

On top of that.. if you are from the ''preserver'' type of people, who like to be gentle with the batteries, you will consider the option to charge them only till 4.00-4.10v max, which again decreases the usable capacity a little bit but not too much (at least in my case).

--

So yeah, I personally think that **''minimum'' suggested emtb battery life range shold be in 12km / 7miles range.**. 15km/9.3miles is even better.. with some ''margin'' on top of that, you never know when after you have rode your board a little, that you might need to use it again.. but oh no.. you have'nt charged it yet enough to go riding further :smiley:

I hope you got my point here.. :D personal experience.. so if you dont plan on go further distances with your board, you can throw my opinion in garbage :D

--
[Edit] I decided to do some theoretical calc for your battery, probably should finally find a calc, which does this for me :D by itself

----
**Distance with maximum capacity sqeezed for 10S 3P VTC 5 pack**
 _**(not very likely in real life, as the discharge rates wont be low + at lower temp than 23C is a bit lower)**_

**270 Wh** (3.6v x 10 x 7.5 Ah)
16.88 KM maximum (at 16Wh/km) ** 
15 KM _(9.32miles)_ (at 18 Wh / km) 
13.5 KM (at 20 Wh / km)

**More realistic calculation:**
253.8 Wh (3.6v x 10 x 7.05 Ah) / 2.35 ah usable per cell
at 16Wh = ~ 15.88 Km
at 18Wh =  14 Km (8.7miles)
at 20Wh =  12,7 Km

---
**16 Wh/km** - ( _@whitepony achieved something like 15wh/km with his older evolve, so I assume this is pretty close to what you can get)_ 
**18 Wh/km** - What I have somewhat achived with lower speed but having big wheels (9inch vs 7 inch ones)
**20Wh/km** - Fast / harsh riding.. lots of acceleration, higher speed)

--

Im personally having 192Wh battery.. Im not using all of it.. since I leave out on high / low range on my battery.. it also gets pretty useless below 3.45v anyway..

So basically, it looks like you will get a pretty good/decent distance anyways..

Sorry about my long rant lol.. I just try to improve my ''battery mathematics'' with doing all this WH / consumtion thing math..

So with **4P 10S, batt, you should probably, get something like 20Km (12.4miles) distance.**. which would be awesome by the way!

--

Personally, I think, someone should come up with _some numbers for 7inch wheels_.. have not seen much data there..

Plus, if you got dual, I think that changes the math a bit, too..

Wow, some nice infos! I think i'lll go for 10s4p and order a bms with charging/discharging on the same port. But i'm worried about that i only can use 16A max. regen. braking in total (4A max charge per cell). That's not much. With Lipos i used 40A.

I thought the rolling resistance is less than mtb because of having no offroad profile and higher pressure. I use 9" wheels on my mtb, too. But i'll know the difference in rolling resistance soon.

I need a min. range of 16km. when it's like you said about 20km with single drive (4p) what do you think it is with dual drive?

With my first elongboard i had a range about 42km, so nice! I used Lipos 10s1p 10Ah, but too heavy und bulky. 
Your Li-ion Pack delivers less power below 3,45V?
That's like Lipo!

You can use more for the regen as that is not constant charging but only "on" for short periods of time. Regen is actually not charging your battery in a significant way - there are way too many losses.

Dual drive give less range but you'll have more power and what's best better brake. 

About the about the capacity there is not that much once you go below 3.3V but it's better to set things up for 3.0 V discharge to account for voltage sag.

@ElskerShadow What wheels? We are talking here about 7inch pneumatics

Im not saying my estimates are way correct. Just tried to predict at where it might be. I personally havent got less than 17wh/km with 2.5bar pumped 9inch a bit wobbly (shamelessly) tires.

And im not even going 25-30kph all the time.. average usually is around 15-17kph now (if i can believe gps app + wattmeter)

Vesc app (vesc itself) would be best for precise data logging. Too bad there's not much info about mountainboard energy consumtion.

All I know is this:

@Nowind got something like 40Wh / km but by going really wild and perhaps even 4wd setup(?)

@NerijusM quoted smth like 22 wh/km for dual drive vesc setup (8inch wheels, i think)

@mountainboardlover69 got 22-27wh/km for his huge tired brushed motor lead acid batt board

@whitepony qouted smth like 15wh/km for older gen (not gt) AT setup with hard pumped tires.

@lowGuido seems to get about 11wh/km for his 5inch narrow non-pneumatic setup

Hi everyone 

There has been a development with the combination of the MBS wheels and the Vertigo truck.

The hanger develop a fatigue fracture, Currently i am evaluating the cause and the multiple factors that are acting on this fracture.

Normally the fractures or failures due to material fatigue are a combination of multiple factors and not an easy task to determine the main contributing factor. In most of the cases is a **CHICKEN AND EGG** type of problem combination.

On a sweet and sour **LUCKY** break, my other board after inspecting it, i found that is developing a similar fracture on the exact location and the same angle of fracture of the broken one. With this at least i will be able to monitor and evaluate what is the mechanism for this fracture.

For now just one thing is clear, the combination of MBS wheels, vertigo trucks and New York City streets is not a good one. 

i'll keep you guys update as things develop.
For now Pneumatics Baby :smiling_imp::smiling_imp::smiling_imp:

Questions:
Where is the fracture occuring?
Do you think it's limited to the vertigo trucks? - I'm running the fully body/non cutout Infinity
Is it affecting both hanger on the board or only on end of the board.

in the end, wheels being pointless or not, a truck shouldnt die from fatigue by just riding it with the wheels of your choice. thats something trampa has to check out! Im a little uneasy too, because I thought the vertigo was the most stable version :worried:

Yes, that point of view has a lot more sense. 

I've been using the MBS on crappy roads with US$ 40 caliber trucks for more than 6 months and they never died from fatige not even a single crack, why would it fail on a US$ 200 set of trucks? It doesn't make any sense besides a flaw in design

Hi Guys, the Vertigos never failed in more than 10 years. Since 2013 I ride street wheels of all kinds, never having any issues. Currently I build up a board using the very first set of carve trucks ever made (from 2013). These had been in a demo fleet and saw some serious mileage.
Carve trucks are wider than regular trucks and feature a complete different design. So don't compare them to longboard trucks. Vibrations are never a good thing, since they kill everything, especially your electronics, solder joints and battery nickle strips. I think the knobbles cause a vibration that resonate in the hanger and finally split it.

The design of the wheel is also conical due to the de-moulding issue. So they have very little contact patch. I don't know the rebound of them, all I know is that we use super high rebound urethane, which makes the ride smooth and dampens most vibrations. I agree with @whitepony: These wheels give the impression you could go off road with them and ride on terrible surfaces. For off road and trails you need much bigger wheels and they should be pneumatics. You buy in this false impression with a terrible performance on the road and off the road. There is a reason why longboards wheels look like they look and why of road boards are on big pneumatics. 

Its like all season tires: Not good in the winter, not good in the summer. You can't squeeze the best of both worlds in one product. But you can sell the impression that it works.

yeah, same here. I'm pushing the Vertigos  for two years now with some 12S in the woods, hard terrain, city and ledges riding, they really take this huge amount of stress, for miles and miles. I just need to get some new wheels as mine are starting to show some serious signs of wear and they are now getting unbalanced but this is more something that's on my side.

[/quote]

This is a fair point to make, but like with almost all devices and system in the market, there are limitations for each application.

Here we have encounter a limitation on the design and it does not make the design any less effective. Just it will have to be declare as a known issue. 

An analogy could be that of a knee or an elbow. 
They can rotate along it's longitudinal axis, they can bend almost 180 degrees on one direction but it is well know and really painful if you even dare to try to bend it on the opposite direction, this does not make that articulation design any less. 

Coming back to the vertigo truck, the hangers can take impact very well and are one of the more robust trucks in the market, of this I have plenty of experience from my kite landboarding days. 

On the MBS wheels. 
I have use them for a year and half, even with their low rebound urethane there have not be any adverse effects due to vibrations, this is mainly because of the way the RKP truck is constructed. 

The impacts from the road are transmitted from the hanger via bushings on the kingpin and a bushing in the pivot cup. 

This urethane/metal transition interface mitigate any adverse vibrations. That is why we can get away by using low rebound urethane like the MBS. 

Check this illustration 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/f/efbcd5c350d19746e01f82a99469ef84fc8b931b.JPG" width="380" height="307">

Anyway, so far this combination can be avoid, just we will get better urethane wheels and I will not have the tank looks of the MBS :cry: unless ABEC11 can provide some of those 107mm electric flywheels :grin:

I'll keep you posted.

[/quote]

At the moment this is the initial factor since this never occurred while using pneumatics or 97mm abec11 flywheels that provide a proper dampening of the vibrations. 

Like I said before I'll investigate and try to get to the source of the issue, because I am always riding with my guy and that's my number one priority.

My point of view is no matter what wheel or terrain I'm riding into, if a $20 truck on MBS wheel hasn't cracked on anyone ever, a Vertigo truck should not crack either and I expect it to be much more resistant. 

If there is an improvement to be made on the truck then just develop it, maybe V2 with reinforced point,  but do not blame the wheels competitor.

I don't understand why there is so much hate from people that have not tried MBS wheels before. Useless? Worse on road? They look like toys? The dampening between abecs and MBS is pretty similar. The people that have MBS wheels seem to like them, including me. @kaly I could be wrong, but you seem to like them as well.

First ever made Trampa Carve Truck Prototype from 2013, still alive despite being sent out to ride centres and personal use for a long time. The inner spring position is drilled straight through the slim bit of the original MTB cutout pattern + counter sunk. I just ripped it apart to see if any cracks can be seen. NO CRACKS!

As Kaly stated, this truck follows a complete different design philosophy and uses springs instead of a urethane bushing. Heavy vibrations of a certain (maybe unlucky chosen) frequency may resonate through the hanger into the springs and back. Do not use these knobby urethane tires with this kind of truck design! End of the Story. 

We design our stuff predominantly to work with our parts and I do not design things to outlast any combination of parts available today and in future. That is simply not possible. And I will not change our design because someone starts selling a wheel I personally don't believe in at all. I have the feeling people buy it because of the look and believing the story you could take your street board off road, using street size wheels with some knobbles on.  

We do not try to sell a story but rather a perfect working product - horses for courses. 100mm knobby tires are not part of our product universe - and will never ever be.  You will see other brands copying this design - not us.

Its always a combination of different factors causing a problem. 
**A+B+C+D = Has to work perfectly** is not always given. Many products are inter compatible today because industry standards exist. We have no real standards in our industry and combining stuff means experimenting. This is why forums like this one exist and the same troubles can be avoided if you inform yourself. I wrote a PM to @halifax21 to warn him, so he does not go through the same mishap. 

DO NOT USE THESE WHEELS IN COMBINATION WITH OUR TRUCKS! 

IF YOU WANT TO GO OFF ROAD, GET YOURSELF SOME REAL OFF ROAD WHEELS (PNEUMATICS).

TRY TO AVOID VIBRATIONS - YOUR ELECTRONICS AND ANY OTHER PART OF YOUR BOARD + YOUR BONES, KNEES AND MUSCLES WILL BE VERY VERY THANKFUL!

@Kaly, try to put some 1.5mm rubber pad under the lower spring retainers. Ride them vibrators again and we will see.
I'm always thinking how to solve issues...  This simple tweak could resolve your matter. 
You could also try to drop some rubber in between your truck and deck to keep vibrations away from the electronics.

The beauty about stuff failing is finding simple tweaks to prevent stuff to fail in future.

i doubt they'll be an issue. the only issue i've had with those wheels is breking traction a little too easily around curves at speed, but i think tat's just because i'm used to Kegels. ABECS break traction even easier but i guess i expect it.

Will leave this here:

https://youtu.be/BNMnehwwh9E

It is video @E-Boarding published in video thread, I hope he does not mind :D

He actually convinced me just from video materials alone that these wheels are somewhat worthy for light off-roading.

Thought it can be seen that wheels do spin out from time to time..
 
Otherwise the wheels itself did convince me from all the videos / pictures I saw, that they are a reliable ''cross-breed'' wheels, offering relaively big size, while not being pneumatics.

--

So yeh, quite a bit of ''shock'' to find out they always does not work out that well..

I had heard about the pimples being a bit annoying and making a vibration on their own, just didnt know they might destroy certain trucks this way..

--

From picture @Kaly posted, it can be seen that contact patch with road is very in the middle (shape of the wheel).. maybe this makes the wheels to 'act' as railroad wheels, taking up some of the vibrations harshly..

@whitepony  Well, to be honest this was the only real video I had seen where these wheels were applied to such terrain and it seemed impressive that they managed to do somewhat fine!

Of course there was a bit of struggle riding as it could be seen in video but I dont really have any reference point on how regular flat profile urethane wheels act on such terrain.

Some sticks could be seen on his path and I think he even managef to roll over one while also dealing with the many leaves (leafs) there were

So the width in the MBS wheels and the pneumatics is totally different. I wonder how he compensated for that. If you look in the pictures there is a big gap that these wheels leave behind and that can be a problem. In the picture the wheels are on infinity urban carver of course i haven't used the board in this set up yet but im now going to finish the build (hopefully soon) and then try it myself.

Hi @longhairedboy, Kaly split his hanger in half, which is an issue. **But it never occurred using any other wheel in all the years we make the street carver.** The Vertigo Truck never had any issues, being used for kite, MTB and street. Our Equipment is usually being battered harder than any other gear you will find out there. People really take things to the very edge, and that is what we design our gear to outlast. The Video below shows what I'm talking about - minute 2.04 onward will give an impression. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok_nrTPoQyQ

If a 6mm aircraft alloy, T6 heat treated, splits in half, there is a bad resonance caused by the knobbles, you can't deny that. Regular street wheels don't send that frequency towards the hanger. I think a simple tweak, as described above, will solve the matter (rubber pad below lower spring retainer). My guess is: Knobbles cause springs to resonate in a certain frequency and they then send the vibrations back onto the hanger base. After millions of little shocks the alloy will get cracks. This is a unique thing that happened only in combination with this special wheel! The street carver is not a new product and its proven to perform fantastic using slick wheels or pneumatics (as offered by us).  

I can see more problems occurring, using knobbly wheels. If 6mm high grade alloy cracks, nickel strips and solder joins, PCBs and the like will also suffer. I'm not a big fan of parts causing vibrations. That's my point. So extra care needs to be taken (rubber pads, regular checks for cracks). 

Might be that others use the wheel for a while now, not having seen any issues. That does not mean that no issues will occur in the next couple of months/miles. If you would have asked Kaly last Friday he would have said: No problems!
On Sunday he changed his opinion (-;

Things last till they finally brake... Please check your gear on a regular basis.

So before any disappointment or accidents happens I rather say: Do not use these wheels in combination with our trucks. This combination seams to cause an issue. 
If you can't withstand, its your risk and please take extra care. 
Take extra care, regardless of the equipment you ride. We have seen an issue and it might happen again.

Frank

I still fail to understand why it's the wheels fault. I have very sensitive feet and MBS give the least amount of foot strain on par with 97mm abecs. I can't use 90mm abecs or kegels because my feet hurt to much. The nubs create barely any noticable vibration and they flatten out after couple of miles. I would blame the bad roads(everything is bad roads for urethane lol) +urethane combo and lack of vibration dampening (bushings) in trampa truck. The shape of the wheel actually help if there is cracks in the road, they can deform instead of uncontrolled steering like square wheels.

Myabe! I ride 83a to send as many vibrations as possible ( crash test dummy....) and Berlin is not famous for good roads.
I haven't seen any split trucks so far and we sell the product since 2013. Sometimes its not a matter of the vibration but a matter of a certain frequency that causes resonance. Since the wheel has knobbles it will cause a certain vibration at a certain frequency, which might be no issue for your feet but maybe for the truck. Since we have seen a split hanger, using these wheels, and we haven't seen anything like that in all the years, my conclusion is: take extra care until we know more.

I'm not sure how trampa trucks work, but longboard trucks have bushings and pivot cups for extra vibration dampening (and support pin sometimes). I guess with air filled tires vibration is no issue. I also ride through back alleys where it's literally painful to ride just to see what will fail if anything, it's usually screws backing out. I am curious to see if it is a design limitation of truck or actually the wheels. I think it's to early to throw MBS wheels under the bus.

Its about A+B+C+D that might be an issue. Its not about A or B or C or D being an issue. 
I would simply take extra care and ad some rubber in between the lower spring retainer and the Hanger + a rubber pad in between the deck and the truck when riding these wheels. I would also have a close look once a while. 
But I can't say this combo works great! I can say we had zero issues in the past using our wheels. ZERO!
There are quite a few boards out there, so problems would have been known till now.

I have spacers for it but where you put the spacers can have alot to do with the vibration and the whole breaking of the hanger. Atleast thats my opinion.

As you can see is a curved fracture, this are cause by a resonance wave, the source of this wave is the question to answer. 
 Have in mind that resonance waves have even taken down bridges, planes and broken other type of equipment. 

In my opinion and this is not trying to put anybody product down, the small contact patch does not allows for proper propagation of the impact wave through the mass of the urethane, the wave transfer with all its intensity onto the hanger and there is where it dissipates all its energy. 

It is like taking a punch, by pulling back the smallest distance you take away the a big amount of impact force. 

The normal RKP does this via the bushing on the kingpin and cup, so even using any type of wheel this mechanism dissipate the wave. 

The Trampa truck design is different. 
It can take more blunt abuse than the normal RKP. 

But when using urethane, needs to have a big contact patch of the wheels, to help with the dissipation of the shock waves into the mass of the urethane. 

I'll try to get a set of this wheels to a lathe, then we will tested once more, meanwhile I have a set of 97mm abec11 and pneumatics too.

If I may interject into this conversation, I have the MBS wheels on my @longhairedboy board for quite some time and have probably put at least 500 or more miles on them, I can totally see the issues @Kaly had for his board. These wheels were wonderful at the beginning, but after a while they deteriorate greatly. I actually felt vibration more the more mileage i put on these wheels. 

Another big concern I have with the deterioration is grip factor. They become less grippy the more stress you put on them. A few weeks ago, the board slip right under my foot and I fell forward onto my knees while I was trying to accelerate from standing position, something which has never happened on my Abec11 97mm before. I think these wheels works wonderfully for the first 250 miles or so when use on roads but after they deteriorated, where the center dimples are almost even due to stress, you should switch them out for another sets. Personally, i have 3 boards with diff wheels configuration and I can tell you that the pneumatics can really take a punch and is probably the best bang for your bucks when you use it for city full of cracks and potholes like NYC.

Hi @Nate, thats what I mean, you think everything is perfect until the part splits. 
Having had no issues for 800 miles doesn't mean your board will be fine at mile 900.

Google "broken longboard truck" and you will see: Nothing is lasting for forever. 

Vibrations are your enemy No.1. Try to avoid them, by riding top spec urethane and tweaking your equipment relative to the road conditions: horses for courses! 

The difference in the wheel urethane is substantial. 
In skateboard language dampening is called "rebound". Some urethane has 40% dampening, others 80%
Making a 70 to 80% "rebound" wheel costs more than twice than making a cheap 40% one.
The difference in your ride is astronomic. Twice the dampening = 10 times the comfort.
If you ever tried in line skates, you know the difference between good and bad wheel sets.
the first thing you realize riding good wheels is: silence 
Noise = is sound waves emitted from vibrating parts.

I don't know what urethane the MBS wheel is made of, I don't own a set, so you guys have to judge the quality.
All I can say is: We use the top spec urethane and had ZERO issues in all the years we sell the board.

@Note: So the resonance just chose another spot to chew in. I prefer cracks to happen and grow, so you can see the issue before things split. Aircrafts get markings on tiny cracks and then they monitor if the crack extends. When it grows you ground the plane and change the part. 

Frank

Ps.: @Ebosted: One night we rode down the park trails, using the 90mm urethane street wheels. Great fun, great drifts...
To be honest: The lads had some pints down and thrashed the s....t out of the gear. Cleaning the board the next day was no fun..... You can take your board down these trails using any 90mm street wheels. It's not healthy for you or your equipment. A small stick or stone can make you fall of your board!

Those are genuine caliber IIs. No fractures in the trucks at all. Also i did receive your email and you should be getting a full report on your board tonight. I took it out on the road last night, i forget how powerful that thing is with those dual 6374 SK3s. 

About the MBS wheels: I've got a set that have lasted about a year of very hard abuse, including smashing into curbs on occasion, running over train tracks regularly, and of course dirt roads and typical terrible sidewalks. they're finally showing their age with cracks and small chunks. 

I have no complaints with those wheels. They're actually very good all around wheels for street and i guess what you could call sub-street. The only thing they can't handle is loose dirt. They'll bog down pretty quick. And if you ride them on the street long enough they'll wear down to a smoother contact patch improving grip and reducing traction breaks. 

I'm used to riding around on Kegels which are basically the complete opposite of wheels like the MBS ones and even ABEC11s. my orange kegels don't break traction on curves unless the road is slimey or wet.

Thank you for the honest report on the usage of these wheels with your trucks. Staying in front of issues like this is how they should be handled, and i appreciate that from you. 

ITs an interesting situation indeed and i suspect that not only the knobbiness is at play, but also the total width of those giant spring trucks you're using. Funny thing about resonance is it tends to amplify over a longer resonator, which i believe could be contributing to your issue as well. Vibration damping will definitely help and i think you've laid out some good advice for mitigation and resolution. 

I discovered something similar was happening in my battery packs so i switched to a double layer - half length cell format which makes the whole pack stronger, but that was happening no matter what wheels where being used. Using softer wheels will help also, which is odd to me because the MBS wheels are already soft at  78a i beleive. The flywheel clones i typically use are also in that approximate durometer. 

My experience with these wheels  is as follows: On 180mm caliber II trucks they're awesome and don't seem to be causing any issues. I typically use LUXE risers which are not the softest, but do allow color matching and also easy modification for wire management, so no real damping there. Bushings don't seem to make much difference with vibration, i've tried a few different durometers and barrel-cone combinations.  Using silicone sealant as a "liquid gasket" on the boxes has helped a lot. 

Vibration is always an issue. 99% of the problems i've had to resolve are due to vibrations and the effects it has. I've destroyed boxes and had to completely change how they're made. I've had to change how i solder joints. I've had to change how i stack my cells. I've had to change how i mount my ESCs and even where and how i mount the receiver. 

but to lighten the mood a little, here's why its worth it...

@longhairedboy very nice shots you got there! Cool thing you shared them!

In comparison, I do think the pimples / shape of the wheels help when going on grass or not so good terrain.. heck, @longhairedboy even went down the hill with loose rocks and ''survived'' more or less..

Would be cool to see someone else doing the same ''stunts'' with 'regular' abec / longboard wheels, to see how they perform and can they ''climb' up a grassy hill like that..

To summarize all this, there are 4 options to fix this issue:

1. Flatten the MBS pimples on a lathe (unconfirmed fix)
2. Add a rubber ring between the spring retainers and the deck (unconfirmed fix)
3. Use Abec 11 97mm 75A flywheels (impossible to get them ATM)
4. Use ABEC 11 107mm 74A electric flywheels (impossible to get them ATM)

I've heard the ABEC 11 is going to have their flywheels at last back in stock in a couple of weeks but couldn't find the information online anywhere, hope that's true.

@Eboosted: Or use 90 mm Stickies, back in stock in a couple of days.

@Randyc1: the axles sit 46mm deep in, pressed in and glued. 15 Years without any issues....
The hanger is basically a trimmed version of the MTB hangers, which are a lot wider and have a lot wider axle shafts (+16mm). I ride the wide Ultimate MTB Trucks with street wheels, having ZERO issues. 
http://www.trampaboards.com/the-ultimate-titanium-truck--white-range-with-titanium-axles--kingpin--super-light-p-11148.html. 
I use the Street Carve Baseplate and ad the inner sping position on the Hanger myself.

@OKP: I did also convert the Infinity to have inner spring positions. Lush Board and 8" compatible:
Downside: I had to get the axle pins out and lathe them down for street wheel use (you don't want to do that unless you have access to a workshop with a press and the like).

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/4/c42b1a7caa9183c706efdbedac5fc071c59aa664.jpg" width="690" height="458">

With regards to wheel softness: **Its not the softness, its the dampening characteristics that play a role.** A soft wheel can still have low dampening! To kill vibrations you need the best dampening (rebound), not softness.

I think a rubber washer under the spring retainers will help a lot, since it will kill the vibrations in the exact spot where the problem occurred. Hard vibrations can't travel up the springs and back, which was the problem in my eyes (resonating springs, caused by the wheels frequency emissions). Dampas will also prevent that.
When using regular quality slick wheels there is no issue, since no resonance will occur. We sold tons of Street Carvers (since 2013) and had ZERO issues. Customers usually come back to us if something fails. Zero returns till today. This is why I can tell you there is something funny with the knobbled wheel... 
The knobbles seam to cause a resonance in the springs. The location of the crack shows that pretty clear. We never ever had a split hanger with a crack in that special location. 
This is why I'm quite optimistic that a simple rubber washer will solve the matter. Kaly will find that out for us.

@Randyc1: Try them vibrators and in case your hanger slits, we will ship new ones. Since this hanger is forged from a special high grade aircraft alloy + heat treated, you will not see a sudden fail of the product but rather a slowly growing crack. There is no danger when you inspect you truck once a while! Forging is expensive - you can find forged Longboard hangers for a good amount of $. 
Casted Trucks would fail suddenly (brittle aluminium). You can bend a vertigo hanger (e.g. on a machine) without splitting it apart. Casted handers don't bend, they split. The most common locations are the corners of the Baseplate or the pivot cone or the pivot cup housing and the Kingpin. In some cases your truck comes apart all of a sudden without any warning. Ever piece of equipment will fail one day! Its only a matter of time... Kingpins are being bent slightly all the time (left right left right left right left right left right). After thousands of those movements they simply split.

My point is: Kill any vibrations as good as you can! Go down to the root of the problem! The root is a quality wheel since this is the point where vibrations have their origin!  If you fail to do that, you will get issues sooner than later. You can try to handle the vibrations but its better to eliminate them in the first place. There are so many requests for cheap clone wheels here.... DON'T try to save your money on this piece of gear! Its a critical part and will cause problems if not well made! Saving 40$ on wheels will cause many problems - expensive and time consuming to solve. 

The other issue I see about using "Urethane off road wheels" is that people are encouraged to go off road and ride on bad surfaces (that can be ridden with any other Urethane wheel). 
That will put extra strain on your board and some parts (designed for street use) will not like it (dirt vibrations impacts). The chance to get stuck on an obstacle like a stick or a stone is very high and you will fall of your board like a canon ball. A Board that stops rolling all of a sudden is dangerous! You can see that happening in the first video posted several times: https://youtu.be/BNMnehwwh9E
Pneumatic 6 - 7" is the bare minimum if you want to go off road. Nice videos we see there but nothing you couldn't do with a regular 90mm Urethane wheel ( and nothing you should do). Thx @okp  for showing this. Its still dangerous! The wheel is to small to roll over certain obstacles you expect in such an environment.

I just found a great looking alternative... remember that company that tried to get kickstart founding for a leaning skateboard? Its called Pramash Boards, and their product its called Lean Board. Here are the tires they used for the project. 

https://www.pramash.com/leantruckswheels

They are called Lean Wheels and had this distinctive soft rounded profile that I like. According to them: "they are big 108 mm wheels which allow it to go faster and easily go over any terrain, giving it a smooth ride. These wheels are good for long distance push. The wheels have the exact same 8 millimeter bearings as the regular wheel bearings so you can use these wheels on any other trucks. They are so smooth that you can turn your ride into a magic carpet".

They are a bit pricey. $ 129 US dollars for a set of four. Right now the wheels are out of stock but you can join the waiting list for the next batch that will come later at an undisclosed date. They come in three different durometers (colors): soft greens for good grip (75a - 80a), excellent for cruising; medium blacks for intermediate (80a - 85a); and hard reds for great slide (85a - 90a), excellent for freeride.

I don't think he will, I won't personally  do it  myself. 

He is selling his products at very reasonable price, why don't you buy him a set? I consider a lack of touch to ask for his own personal design in the name of the community

because shipping is crazy expensive to EU and I own 3d printer.

But if that's the case I will design my own and share them anyhow over here.

the 3d Printed pulley i designed  will not work properly and it will brake. 
you need aluminum ones.
i have 40T aluminum insert pulleys with bearing for $25.00 ea and the shipping should not be that expensive

Hey, I'm sorry if I'm posting this in the wrong spot, but I'm also in NYC and would like to purchase one of your custom boards. How can I contact you to initiate this order. FYI, I was refereed through the Evolve Forum where I first saw your boards and components. Thanks, John

Would you happen to know how long it takes to get one together and "out the door"? Is it a long process for lets say a basic street setup?

I apologize in advance because I didn't read this long thread, so being lazy and just asking these.

I recently found out about Kaly NYC and his builds.  So there is a one month wait time?  Is that really a month...or longer?

Also what is his warranty?  Why is there so little info out there, he doesn't have a website or what he offers exactly.  What are the specs of his boards, what motors does he use, what ESC, wheels, mounts, gearing ratios, remote, etc etc?

Just send him an email he will get in touch....

He is always working to get 2 out the door by the weekend, lol... I have a Street / Urban Carve here, had it a few weeks and FREAKING LOVE IT !!!

I've had a few minor issues (I bought one of his prototypes) and hes on top of them and happy to help out.

If you search his build thread he offers the Kaly.NYC Street / Urban Carve, motors. battery enclosure, battery packs, controllers, custom builds.. hell I bought my latest ABEC 97s from him about a week ago because nobody had them local to me (just outside Philadelphia).

Hope it helps !

There's plenty of info if you look at his profile and read through the threads he's started. And he's been trying to get his website up and running but he's been too busy with customer builds to do so, so it's still under construction, but his prices and some of the stuff he's selling is in post #77 in this thread.

However, you'd have to email him for a quote on a custom build.

[quote="Kaly, post:77, topic:15363, full:true"]

Yeah, as people are chiming in, this guy is awesome but too busy building for customers to get a proper website/shop up and running, probably more of a fall/winter things not primetime summer.  Anyway, his custom builds are sick but line out the door to get one I expect lol.  Only eSk8 builder I know that had Shaquille O'Neal ride his deck (without breaking it w/325 lbs & size 22 shoes btw) For now, will require some work to research.

They come from the UK, they are part of the Flex Revolution esk8 project. But there is a catch, the price is somewhat $59....but the shipment to the US cost $79 !! So its an unreal proposition. Too expensive.
