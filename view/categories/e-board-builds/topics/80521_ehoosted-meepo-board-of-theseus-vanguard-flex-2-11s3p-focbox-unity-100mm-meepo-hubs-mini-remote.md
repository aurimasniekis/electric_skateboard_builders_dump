Introducing my &ldquo;Board of Theseus&rdquo; aka the eHoosted board. First allow me to explain the names. The ship of Theseus is a metaphysical thought experiment that asks: does an object that has had all of its components replaced remain fundamentally the same object? Ever since I received my Meepo 1.0 in October 2017, no original part remains. So what is this board? To me is will forever be my first board, a Meepo. eHoosted is a conjunction of &ldquo;hub&rdquo; and &ldquo;eBoosted&rdquo; which are the gorgeous enclosures used. These two aspects, I believe are the defining features of my build. 

![finishedeHoosted|375x500](upload://MwG1V0UX1VOOQjQ7e9NSvefqkQ.jpeg) ![IMG_20190110_173030|375x500](upload://jCHHUk18ivnreGkdqo59faIs5Hc.jpeg) 

Back in 2017, I was hooked not on just riding but understanding, maintaining, and improving this original inception of a budget board. I was fortunate enough to be introduced to eboarding with a side by side of boosted v1 and v2 by a good friend. However, I knew that the Meepo would not be of the same caliber (in quality or comfort) as those boards. So I began my journey of tinkering, testing, and modifying to satiate my thirst for DIY&rsquo;ing and performance. It has been a blast.

So now I&rsquo;ve ended up with the eHoosted which doesn&rsquo;t ride at all like the 1.0. I sought out the following improvements:

* Better range and less voltage sag
* Higher top speed
* Better comfort
* Better control
* Better stability

Some of these were really easy, like swapping bushings, bearings, trucks, hangars and purchasing new remotes, ESC&rsquo;s, and hubs. Others were more challenging such as crafting my own 10s4p battery enclosure for a parallel conversion, deck swapping, and eventually building my own battery. Simply put the eHoosted is the culmination of all these improvements and more to come. (hopefully a FocBox Unity and TB DD) ;)

eHoosted parts list:

* Loaded Vanguard (flex 2, 42&rdquo;) BLEM
* Allure Snow Mountain longboard griptape
* eBoosted Vanguard enclosures (Sony VTC version)
  * #10-24 brass wood inserts (x10)
  * #10-24 ⅞ pan head hex screws (x10)
  * #10 nylon washers (x20)
  * ⅛ neoprene sheet with adhesive
* DIY 11s3p Samsung 30q battery pack w/Bestech BMS (discharge bypassed)
* Meepo esc V2.0
* DIYeboard RC7 remote
* 90mm Meepo 1.5 hub motors + front wheels
* Caliber II 50˚ front truck (Midnight Satin Red)
  * Orange Otang nipple boardside, yellow venom cone roadside
* Meepo Shredder rear truck
  * Stock bushings
* Zealous bearings
* Loaded 1.5&rdquo; panhead, hex bolts
  * Fender washers (x8)
* Flatland3d bash guards (Fresh green, rounder, 2x)
* Sector 9 ⅛&rdquo; shock pads (2x)
* Shredlights (standard brackets)
* Grin tech &ldquo;Cycle Satiator&rdquo; charger

There have been a lot of intermediate versions between the 1.0 and the eHoosted which means a lot of time, effort, and money has gone into this project but in my opinion the knowledge and experience gained has been worth it. Thank you Kieran, for your inspiration to pursue a hobby and gain PEV expertise and thank you friend for letting me cruise around with you on your V1 BB. I will never forget that feeling and stupid grin. I&rsquo;ll never stop feeling like Marty McFly on a hoverboard. Welcome to the future and ride safe :slight_smile:

Rubber grommets and a small drilling error. I over widened the power button hole and had to use a grommet but hey more waterproofing!

Installed the battery meter. Made a mistake with the drill but some sharpie did the trick!

![IMG_20190106_132815|375x500](upload://c6lb2F7CwYu9kHzCXee2uFTRjoT.jpeg) 
Had to move my BMS out of the pack to make it fit. I ordered way too big of a BMS (especially for discharge bypass..) but I made it work.

![IMG_20190106_171452|375x500](upload://1Nzt8loxwBYKPNAeLY26dPW5aI5.jpeg) 
All tucked in nicely! As you can see the v2 ESC was still intact here.

![IMG_20181230_160916|375x500](upload://aJ5udlq0F4B0YAQ3vqSyxZI9FLC.jpeg)
Modifying the Meepo hubs with mr-30 connectors and (over) shortening the phase wires. 

![IMG_20190109_153622|375x500](upload://iBDNGz0y0duc3zy3x5iP56CsonO.jpeg) 
So I made a dumb mistake and blew up my V2 ESC so I went in the closet to find my V1 and do some modifications. Interestingly enough, the V1 esc has 2 63V rated capacitors and the V2 has 4 smaller 50V rated ones. So for the time being I am limited to ~22mph :roll_eyes: and some even more finicky  acceleration. This esc is from October 2017! I have a new one coming as I am waiting on the Focbox unity to be in stock rather than pre-order and for enertion to release their new remote. I could have waited till February for a Unity but I have had good experience with the V2 meepo esc... plus I like the remote so what can I say.. I like the company. I know it's inferior. 

**SPECS**

_Pretending I didn't blow up my v2 esc..._

Top Speed: 26mph 
Range:   ~ 14 miles (Max throttle, flat, ≤ 10mph wind, 150lbs) 
Comfort: The vanguard flex 2 is wayyy nicer than the meepo v2 deck although the NLS seems to have narrowed that gap. The authentic caliber II's and rear shredder truck are notable improvements from the V1 hardware. The bottle neck is still the hubs but I love how they are silent!

Future upgrades (likely in order): The new meepo 100mm "beast motors" should be coming out on their site soon which should allow me to hit 30mph. A VESC (preferably a Unity). A Direct Drive (leaning towards TB's although Carvon's were what got me interested in it). I think I'll stay at 11s for a while as the pack is quite new. 

Thank you all for reading and for your knowledge and advice! If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask, I will try my best to answer them.

If you wanna stay stealthy lookin, id go for raptor hubs. yeah its a harder ride but it looks like normal wheels ya no. If you don't care go for tb's direct drive with their new 110mm wheels you'll definitely hit the 30mph mark

cool build man.  Changed the title for you.  Was a minor spelling error.  

I have a focpo.  Its basically a meepo with focboxes in case you couldn't work that out for yourself.  Definitely upgrade the esc as soon as you can.  It makes the thing a completely different animal.  
Torquey little devils those hubs once you dump the bottle neck esc. 
Good luck with the progression.

Once that focbox unity gets a little more mature and hopefully some more remote options come out I am all over it. Or I could settle with a Flipsky 4.20 Plus once some more reviews trickle in.

Nice I really like this!
Did you actually tested that you get a higher topspeed with the 11S battery?

I have seen a video that he connected a 12S battery and the esc only worked when the voltage was below 50V so 11S should be fine!

Never seen somebody else testing this so that cool!

So my testing yielded quite odd results. When I initially tested 12s on the v2 esc it was with a 12s4p 30q pack and I hit 32mph. Voltage was 47.6 I believe and I had absolutely no brakes. I tested the HVC and it seemed to be 48V so 12s was a no go. 

According to the Esk8 Calculator 10s is 25mph and 11s is 27.5mph. I have recorded 27mph. These are 8 month old Meepo 1.5 motors so I am impressed given that the magnets tend to thermally degrade on these smaller, cheap hub motors. 

I do want to get some 100mm Meepo NLS motors which are more powerful than these motors and the calc says I should be able to hit 30mph. 

The main advantage of 11s over the 10s is less sag since the starting voltage is higher. It has been worth it so far and ESC was doing fine till I blew it up thanks to a soldering a connector on backwards... rookie mistake :man_facepalming:

Thats awesome, when you got the 12S battery have you ridden it more (so on a lower battery voltage) that the brakes came back?
If the 11S battery works fine I'm going to do a new build also with the ownboard esc and hubs and I would also like to make a 11S pack :smile:
Just a little more speed would be perfect.

At the moment I got a 10S4P 30Q pack with the ownboard esc and hubs and it works just so good without any issues.
Max speed for me is 25mph so that's the same.
![IMG_20180814_132406|375x500](upload://jOBrhI0XQj3D2fasEJVzkOhcpVv.jpeg) 
I have checked the voltages with the bluetooth bms app and I saw that the esc will lower the amps when the battery voltage goes below 32V so that's very healthy for the batteries because it won't go below that 3,2V / cell which is great.

When you got a 11S, the esc will also lower amps when going below 32V but that means the voltage / cell will be (32/11) 2.9V per cell.

So just keep in mind that the cutoff is much lower.
I should use a good bms to protect every cell to not go below 2.8V.

> Thats awesome, when you got the 12S battery have you ridden it more (so on a lower battery voltage) that the brakes came back?

Yeah once the voltage dropped below 47 I started getting some weak braking back. At 46 it returned to normal but between 47 and 46 it would randomly engage full braking power as I slowed down. With 11s the full charge, no brakes period is longer but that's normal especially with higher capacity battery packs.

I haven't tested the hobbywing esc with other voltages but the capacitors are rated for 50V (I think) so you should be good. Depends on the programmed HVC. 

I have my BMS discharge bypassed with a voltage meter and a cycle satiator charger. No issues for the past couple months. Just have to be a little more vigilant with these esc's.

When I'm going to build my new board I will test it first with my power supply and put 46V on the esc, just to see if there any speed difference.
I'm so excited to try this on 11S :smile: 

I saw 2 video's who tried a 12S battery:
The first one says the topspeed didn't increase a lot so I tought maybe that esc reduces the speed to 40kmh.

And the second video seems to give better results

I got a new v2 esc installed, working great. Got thrown off the board so I'm currently sitting in bed recovering.   Board was 2 feet from going into a lake but no damage so I consider myself lucky. A spine protector might be a worthy investment... on an unrelated note I pulled the trigger on a FOCBOX Unity.

Unity won't come in till :man_shrugging:. So v2 @11S. Simply put I rode outside of my skill level since I had not ridden in a month **and** basically overhauled the ride characteristics from the deck swap. Might have hit a rock I'm not sure I remember the events correctly from the adrenaline rush. Had to continue the ride 5 more miles (at a much slower speed)! Always. Wear. A. Helmet. 

It was a lovely 62˚F and went for a cruise :slight_smile: Appreciate the concern, feeling much better. I'm fortunate enough to ride off these kind of falls but I ordered a spine/back protector because this is the second rough fall where I streeted my back.

Had a parallel group go bad and the battery meter shorted out coincidentally. The new meter came with a plastic backing which should prevent a short from happening again. Took the extra time to replace the BMS with a smaller one as well as clean up the wiring. Really liking how it turned out and made sure to use extra insulating foam this time around. BMS model is a Bestech D127. Cheers fellas hopefully the next update is about the FOCbox Unity conversion and not a broken piece of board or body.  

EDIT: Well it turns out the BMS was faulty so I found out you can wire a D140 12s as an 11s and to be honest I much happier with this because I know the D140 is a reliable charge only BMS.

I replaced the 1.5 meepo hubs with the newest 100mm NLS hubs and matching front wheels. Acceleration and top speed felt on par or better. Braking strength had a noticeable increase which I liked. Felt ever so slightly more stable/confident with the larger wheels. Meepo v2 ESC and 11s3p samsung 30q battery.

The same esc before and after the 90 to 100mm motor swaps? 
I'm looking to do the same but wasn't sure if my the new larger motors would be "chuggy" on the old esc.
Did you experience rough starts? and is braking nice and smooth?

Same V2 ESC. Keep in mind I have an 11s3p battery so my top speed is going to be slightly higher. Smooth starts and strong brakes. Of course the V2 ESC is to blame for braking and acceleration but I'm pretty satisfied with the ride. I have a Unity on the way. 

I would recommend the 100mm wheels of you want a very slight comfort increase and a moderate stability increase. Very pleased and they run quiet.

Shoulder healing up well. I was able to install the Unity and go for a test ride. The guided setup was very intuitive and the process was easy. I've never used a VESC or programmable ESC before.

I paired the Unity with a mini remote and the 100mm Meepo hub motors. I am blown away by the level of control and power this ESC offers. Motor min/max = 50amps; battery min/max = 16/45amps. I also have the speed limited via erpm for 24mph. Not trying to reinjure myself at 30mph through my own stupidity. 

Here's some differences from the old ESC I noted:

- No brake hold
- Much stronger acceleration
- Much smoother acceleration 
- Much smoother braking
- Wide power band (it has kick throughout all speeds not just sub 10mph)
- Somehow it's even quieter than the old esc (both FOC with sensors)

Very happy with the FOCBOX Unity. I was pleasantly surprised by the mini remote's performance as I've never used a trigger remote before. Might pick up a Flipsky VX1 in the summer but this mini remote gave a damn good first impression. I am so happy that I have endless customization options and so much data to look at. Unfortunately, the pragmatic part of me knows I will not be riding often for another few months. 

Lastly, one more shout-out to @Eboosted for helping me get a replacement enclosure after the wreck and to @b264 for the countless times he recommended the mini remote.

Currently doing PT because of the accident. Still have a ways to go.

Anyways, something happened to my battery and I have decided to make a new one soon. I have been looking through threads about cell options and can't seem to decide between 18650 and 21700. 

My setup is:

- 10s4p eBoosted Enclosure
- 11s3p 30q battery
- Focbox Unity 
- 100mm 540w Meepo hubs

I would greatly appreciate any input about which cells to use and what format (XsYp config and 21700 vs 18650).

How many amps are you pushing to the hubs? I just got a pair of 100mm NLS hubs and was pretty surprised at how thin the wires are. I'm thinking 12S would be be better than increasing the amperage. I am going to open them up and see how hard it would be to resolder thicker lead wires to them.

I used to push 45 Batt and 50 Motor, bumped it up with 50 Batt and 60 Motor and shorted one of the hubs. 

I just finished my 10s4p and have it set to 30 Batt and 35 Motor. I don't think I would set it much higher than that. I definitely plan on tinkering with it but I'm pretty happy with this setup. Unity can obviously handle a lot more but the hubs are the limiting factor here. 

I haven't ever opened up the hubs to the point where I could see the PCB so if you do please document the process :slight_smile:

Will do my best, haven't internally modified a motor before so I'm not really sure what I'm in for but, may as well give it a look when I'm swapping from the 90mm PU's to the 100mm ones. 
Do you know where the short occurred?

Unfortunately, I do not. Someone with more expertise would have to chime in and guess whether it is more likely that the wire coating melted or the heat from the core caused the solder to melt (if that's even possible). I suppose I kinda answered myself there haha.

If I had to guess, replacing the wires with some quality 14 gauge would allow you to bump up the motor amps without risk of a short but the extra heat will certainly degrade the magnets. At least you can replace the sleeves with fresh magnets!

Hey just wanted to let you know that I went on a 7 mile ride with the 30 Batt and 35 Motor config and the motors were pretty hot. There are no temperature sensors but I could only touch them for a less than a quarter of a second. I am 150lbs and this was flat ground doing up to 29mph. I don't think I'll be changing the settings to be more powerful than this but I might play around with a lower batt max and a higher motor max. 

This 10s4p 30q is amazing! I did 7 miles with 75% battery remaining on the Enertion App.

Niceee, gonna have to put the hub tear down on standby for now. I got a couple of batter orders in I need to fulfill first. And make myself a 12S2P 30Q pack for this, my flipsky VESC is taking quite some time to get here tho...

However I have been mathing it out and I'm going to start with 25A motor continuous on 12S to see what the heat is like. Meepo apparently doesn't care if heat damages the motors since they believe you only see small losses in power over a long period of time and they're more concerned with the riding experience. I'm going to be a little more cautious than this but we'll see lol

Hello. Nice build. I am awaiting delivery of an NLS Pro myself and was considering upgrading it as well. 
Is the Unity still a big upgrade from the Pro's HW Esc? 
What type of performance gains do you get from upgrading the ESC and pushing more amps? 

Thanks in advance.

Hi, thank you for looking at my board and for your question!

> What type of performance gains do you get from upgrading the ESC and pushing more amps?

Simple put it's more powerful, so more torque and faster acceleration. The NLS Pro HW ESC is rated for 1080W while I run my setup at 1500W so about a third more power. You can go higher but the motors are the bottleneck for me and I don't want to short out another motor.

I upgraded from the V2 ESC so I also had a top speed increase of about 3-4 mph. On the new NLS Pro the top speed seems to be "unlocked" or "not limited" so I don't know how much improvement you would see there. I also wanted a smoother throttle profile but the HW ESC is pretty good in that regard.

Thanks for your response. Very informative.
How noticeable is the 40% increase in power? Does it translate into significant more torque? I assume there is some diminishing returns going on.
Trying to find out if I think it is worthwhile to swap.

The way I have it set up it has equal startup torque to a Boosted V2+ (rider @ 200lbs and me @ 150lbs) and pulls much harder up to 29mph so that's all I have as a reference. I don't think swapping from the HW ESC would be as noticeable as swapping from a V2/V3 ESC but you could definitely squeeze out some more power especially if you had the ER battery. 

If you seek significant midrange torque improvement you will get it through a VESC swap but I haven't had a chance to try an NLS Pro so I don't know how good it is. Personally, I don't think it would be worth it at least until your warranty expires. 

Current (and likely final) setup is 10s4p 30q @1800W and its loads more fun that my old board or the BB V2. Any more power I think risks overheating the motors.

Thanks for your insight. 
You could always reach out to Carvlabs and ask them about how much power is safe before you risk overheating. I know they put heat sensors into the Meepo hubs, so they should have a lot more knowledge. Although 1800W sounds like it is plenty.

Never thought about that, I'll check out their stats. Always happy to help :slight_smile:
