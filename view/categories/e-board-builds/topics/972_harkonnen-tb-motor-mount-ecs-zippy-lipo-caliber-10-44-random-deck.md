If you mean why torqueboards is in most of those names it's because he owns the company and that's his username on ES and here

is that a 9mm or 15mm wide belt? make sure that the belt is 100% on that wheel pulley, picture isnt doing it 100% justice but it looks like the belt is just slightly off of that wheel pulley. Also I had the 12T to 36T setup, let me know how fast that belt starts to slip on that KV motor you have, very interested!!!

And that right there is why my mounts aren't that thick. 15mm belts/pulleys push the mounts off of the square surface.

i just flipped the mount so the cuff is in the wheel. 

really wish i could get the mount to sit right but any further and the cuff is on the hanger, oh well.

about 1mm of hang on the belt 14mm on is more then enough.... now where is that new deck been practicing my drawing so i can put a smexy harkonnen II on it.

With just a bit more effort you can get all of the belt on there. A nice even pull on the belt will help ensure that it will last longer. Especially when you go to adjust it some when it stretches over time. 

Also it looks like you may want to ensure that you are account for the flex of the board and the motor isnt going to rub on the board. It will kill your rolling resistance.

Do you have enough room on the motor shaft to move your pulley out a little? That may center up the belt.

board doesnt really flex so no issue and the belt is pretty much touching the wheel so i cant get it on further with out rubbing on the wheel.

Give it a test and see how much wear and tear you suffer. I have learned to always have ample backups on hand. I am at a bar right now looking at a torn belt.... I knew riding through the hood was gonna cause problems, damned bottles on the road...

Anyway, Ya did good on figuring out how to fix the first bit of troubles you had. I feel like you'll get the rest figured/found out and fixed even faster hahaha Good luck!!

why dont you just file away some of the arch on the truck so the adapter fits better. or file a notch in the adapter to fit into the arch. thats what i would do.

Im in the process of a new build and im using 10 in caliber trucks. with 2 of DIY's mounts and as you can see im gonna have ample room for 2 9mm belts. but if i was in your situation i would just take 5 minutes and file some aluminum away

i just flipped the adapter. its the 1cm cuff of aluminum that causes the problem and in all of TB's pics of the mount the cuff goes on the inside but fits on the outside.

and im using bigger belts then you 15mm to your 9mm.

oh yea that adapter is kinda annoying. its not exactly reversible i dont think. it works both ways but it works better when theyre facing the way that they are in my pic because the gaps in the adapter halves dont line up when you flip it the other way. 

Seems like you got it all figured anyway. looks really good so far

I hear ya, snowed for a couple days and they threw the sand out everywhere, now the snow is gone but the sand is still left.
I'm not quite confident enough to ride on sandy roads, so gotta wait for them to clean it up :stuck_out_tongue:

Mind if I ask what motors those are? If they're the ones I'm waiting on from one of our supplier friends here I'm even more anxious to get them as that setup looks killer! I ordered two 6355 245's. My only concern is that my wheels (Spectra Bombers) are dished on both sides and thus I lose a certain amount of hangar length. Got my fingers crossed that with the motors almost touching each other they will allow me enough room. Anyone know of a way to extend the axle on Caliber II's? I got my wheel pulleys yesterday. 50 tooth XL's 5mm pitch 11mm width dual flange. So 9 mm belts I figure. Not sure what belt length yet as I haven't selected the motor pulleys. Am waiting for the motors to arrive as I'm not even sure what the shaft diameter is. Looking at 14 tooth XL. Is there a calculator for belt length. I have Phychotiller's earlier version mounts with only a few millimeters of adjustment. Hopefully a standard length belt will be available.

I believe those are the same ones I ordered delta. What is the shaft diameter? Is there a keyway or flat spot? Not sure what gear type to order. Took my board to a skate shop last week and had the owner push ride it to tell me if the setup was decent. He said he liked the way it felt even without having smooth wheels but said with the studs moving his foot around on the deck was challenging but for my intended use thought they would be beneficial.
