Hi guys my name is Godfrey from South Africa.I started my build early august its a diy deck.lost my pics cant show you the process how it was built..sorry for that.i should have researched before buying electronics as you can see i bought a motor with a high kv and esc is for rc plane would have been better off with rc car esc.i realised after making modification on them so cant send em back.excuse my english.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/ec03fbdaecda906b383e332a787b9e71706d2b10.jpg" width="281" height="500"> 
 here it is...batteries are built inside the deck<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/fb2282d2999e8d84c5d78491229b003a0b1a47af.jpg" width="281" height="500">
Its super thin less than 13mm and it weighs less than 5kg.i think bear trucks are heavy it could weigh less.It can take a rider with 80kg weight.dont know to what weight its gona break.2nd one would be stronger. i built this one on low budget.by the way its built with carbon fibre <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/4496affa2b30f2c78ef8c66c25a0148dc037257d.jpg" width="690" height="388">

COOL BUILD! i love seeing new ideas.

I was also thinking about making a motor mount completely from CF also...

It's possible to make trucks with molded CF too.

I've always wanted a belt cover.They look awesome on the Boosted Board. Maybe you could make a tutorial for the belt cover and for your next deck with inbuilt batteries. Good job!

Nice work especially the last picture you posted :) can't wait to see more. I have done one full carbon and I know how challenging it can be. If you can show us all the process of building of the last and the new board it's always good to see new ideas :slight_smile:

For your truck/motor mount is made with layers of carbon and then Cnc process or it made an other way?
