My First build Project.. Upgrading MBS Colt to Electric 2wd Mountainboard. I have an MBS Colt mountain board with brakes, 7' off-road wheels. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/a/bacb25130921334085a97b9a86a7b887b30978f7.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/e/ce5635e93e0b5dbcf5f169b40b9bc79634696a55.jpg" width="690" height="388"> I am on a budget. I would like to follow the principle of recycle, reuse, re-purpose, using what i have here first before i buy more.. waste noT want not. I will update this post as i progress.

Nice board! I was looking at this same exact model a few days ago!

I really like the graphics of it and also the short lenght. 

Keep us updated, then!

Would also love to see from where u gonna get your mounts from :)

Dipping things in color infused liquid / glue.. 

Search on ebay.. it is.possible to get some pre made kits   / designs there.

Hydro dipping might be the other word

You won't need that brake.
Good luck with your build, keep hitting that search button.

You can use more 'paragrahps' to make it easly readable..

For different parts / sections of text you can use this line:

---


You get it by typing '---' in a empty row.

You can also make titles using the '---'  (in case there different topics to discuss in one reply). To make a title just insert '---'' under the text without any extra space / paragraph.

Wont be much help with vesc''s ;) idea itself isnt bad.. (about video chat / voice conversation about eboards ;) )

you can look up scram boards for the mount.. maybe they even offer vesc.. but you have search on the forum for feedback..

I've built only 1 board so far more or less so wont be much help anyways related to different parts which I havent tested yet myself..

I think, perhaps, @psychotiller can do some sort of consultation as he is doing builds for customers, I think..

Wish you luck on your ''journey'' of eboard building ;)

if you are the designer type (u seem like it a bit) then I would highly suggest to add these 100usd or more on top of your expenses and just get ready made mount.. without tools, expertise and all that, might be a pain and a hassle to do it yourself + end result wont look as good which is important for you, I think..

If youre into more expensive stuff.. you might look up ''@trampa mounts'' / @Nowind.. perhaps @unik  offered mounts.. I believe @Idea might also have some.. though - they are mainly made for matrix / spring trucks etc I think.. so it might need some modification to fit regular - round - skate trucks.

I'm interested in the 2 Vesc's. Do they have a Connector for Motor Controller sync, a usb for Programing, what else do i need, you mentioned; "bldc_tool'd"? Can you tell me any more about them.. I am working on my first build and am wondering about programing, braking, etc.

BLDC Tool is just the companion software also made by Vedder (the V in VESC: Vedder Electronic Speed Controller). It's used to change all of the settings relating to how the VESC draws power, controls the motors, communicates with other things (like the remote or another VESC). It's free and runs on Mac, Linux, and Widows.

I think I can safely say that as a community, we do not currently trust any of the VESCs on eBay. As for the other links, the only one I recognize is psychotiller (he's a respected member around here, though it looks like he's just reselling a maytech VESC, which I don't personally trust yet). To my knowledge @chaka makes the most durable VESC around, though you'll pay a bit more for the quality. I've also heard decent things about the VESCs that @torqueboards at , though you loose out on a bit of warranty and possibly some quality (though nowhere near as bad as what I'd imagine those from eBay are)

If you are looking for a good dual motor mount for MTB, have a look at what @Idea makes. I am sure he can try to adapt the mount to fit on your trucks (currently made for Trampa/Matrix trucks I think).
There is a thread on the forum on it.

The Mattrix are MBS trucks but not sure they are the ones mounted on the Colt.
After it will depend on the diameter of the axle, but he can adjust the mount if you give him the dimensions.

I also have an extra set of MBS Brakes if needed but i felt one pair on the motorless wheels was probably good enough and save or sell the other brakes for a second build.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/b/cba90d8eca1479dd44bc7b5a1d38d392517754f3.jpg" width="690" height="388">Also see the way the angle of the trucks angles the brakes up and inward rather then back behind the board and wheels..

The ATS 12 are not bad, but with protrusion coming out of the axle it may prove difficult to fix any motor mount.
Unless you find a way to use the hole in it, but I have never seen a set up of this kind. You could set a new precedent!

Just check out my build: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/lightweight-mbs-pro-90-dual-vesc-sensored-c6364-belt-drive-nrf/17143

I used a MBS Core 94 board, which has the same ATS 12 trucks. Don't try to fix your motormount at the brake mount, this will get very weak and complicated. Find someone with a lathe, turn the truck down to a full diameter and clamp your mount around this.

Next i am waiting on the Vesc 6.0, And how can i get on a list to buy that? Also i am feeling like finding a direct drive for my 2-4 Mbs approx. 7' wheels or a geardrive that fits my two motors also looking for 2 motors and motormounts to fit my trucks And motors that won't overheat or some type of cooling which i also need to buy and remote. I like the tiny hand held throttles. I am on a tight budget so i am searching for good deals and then hope to order one piece at a time unless i find package deals. Considering the two possibilities of a direct drive system if it even exists for my size tires or a gear drive with no belt. Affordability will change my mind if the quality is competitive. Hoping for suggests and or links to purchase. Any thoughts on what fits my board best? Maybe i should just go to my friends metal smith workshop and get him to cut out the mounts to fit idk.

lol did not read all of it.. but u basically have to decide for one option.. vesc 6 will definately be a lot more expensive than the VESC 4 costs now.. plus.. u still dont know how soon it is going to come up for wider public (at least im not sure yet..)

On a side note - if you got money just buy some kit from @Nowind or maybe @esk8 also offers some for sale now.. (havent really checked into these but yeah..

if you plan to do offroading with belt drive.. closed type system might be the answer yes..(the same as you get for direct drive, the same for belt, so that belt and cogs does not get as dirty as they could without protection)

Vesc 6. Ask @trampa personally, not sure havent you @Journ 'missed the train' already,

Cant offer.direct.links for.remote.

Just.look.up 'mini remote'  it is mentioned on the forum ;)

2nd option - benchwheel remote (seems to.be.good also.but.i.think.it.had.thumb control)

[quote="trampa, post:275, topic:3813, full:true"]
There is some room left since we increased the Beta batch due to min order quantities.So anyone who is still wanting to get in please PM me your name and mail + quantity ( 1 or 2).I'll drop you on the list and send you a mail later this week.

IT is still possible to get vesc 6.. but yeh be prepared to pay a bit more for something that's new and seems it might be way more reliable than vesc 4 was :) (so good for mountainboard I assume)

Garbage. Those are old RC batteries, either NiMH or even worse, NiCad. Not to mention they're only 1200mAh (we're dealing with batteries closer to 5000 or 10,000 mAh)

You'd have to have at least 4 or so of those end to end to get the voltage I'd recommend (26V or about 6s for Lithium Polymer or Lithium Ion) and to get any sort of range you're looking at probably 4 side by side. Basically to match under $100 for 2 lithium batteries (2x 6s, 5000mAh zippy packs) you'd need 16 of those packs. And that's not even getting into how much current they can actually supply.

Good that you made it working! What esc did you end up using?

Nice solution with the mbs trucks made for brakes.. let's hope it stays that way and nothing breaks apart :slight_smile:

What speed/ range do you get out of this setyp anyways? Maybe shed some more technical details in non-video format, if you can ;)

Still like your deck with the cosmos.. as in the beginning, though I think you said at one point u would better want to make something custom anyways hah

vesc x seems to work out fine. check @Duffman posts, he has some ''reinforced'' vesc's as they are now..

Sleeping lion FVT 120 12s escs still seem to need some tuning and the right software to run properly..

If vesc X seems to work somewhat fine up to 40-45A constant, I think with 10s system U should be somewhat covered.. dunno how well it would work for other voltages.. but just bear in mind that 40A per vesc at 36v nominal, would yield about  1440w per motor.

Ok, it is not the 2-2.5kw maximum you might get out of turnigy's.. but I think 2.9kw would still be quite okay for climbing hills at moderate speed..

That video is someone in Denmarks build but i wanted to reference the video cuz he did a good job utilizing the holes on the MBS trucks. I am actually thinking about a different design.....

oh I see :D yeh I somewhat thought that something is not totally right in the video :D and how the heck (in what time) you did manage to design all the parts and make it all work..

though, thanks for sharing.. good luck figuring out the best setup then..
