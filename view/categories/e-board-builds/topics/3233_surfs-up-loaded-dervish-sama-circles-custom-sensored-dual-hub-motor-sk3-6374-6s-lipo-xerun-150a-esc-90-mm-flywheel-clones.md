Hello eSk8!

Inspired by the build on ES by Stielz I decided to build my own:

Whoa couple things? 6s hub motors isn't it too slow? 
Did you swap out the original bearings on the sk3 for something that can handle load? Also I'd put a bevel on that enclosure so it doesn't catch on something tall and throw you off.

Post some videos super cool build!

Edit: nvm about the slow comment

Too slow? (Theoretical) top speed for that setup has gotta be well north of 50mph, even with only 6S. Low end torque is probably lacking but not speed.

nice motors. you are probably going to want to upgrade those bearings to some skate bearings though, those little bearings wont handle the pavement too long.

also I'm not sure why people are so surprised that you can turn an SK3 into a hub motor, Carvon has been doing it for years now..

When I first started making my first board, I first considered making my own hub motors like this but out of a tacon 160. I stop myself from doing it though cause I though I would need bigger and more durable bearings and also questioned myself on how I would attach the outside of the motor to the urethane of my wheels. I concluded that I would need to make a new motor encasing which I would need a cnc machine. I though it would be too expensive and not worth the effort so I didnt do it. Did you get bigger bearings? and How did you attach the outside of the motor to the wheel? 

Also here is the link to Stielz post where he made his hubs https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=68181 scroll down.

I used the original bearings. I think the big bearing should be no problem, however it may better to use some bigger bearings for the outside bearings. E.g. 688 bearings. 

The urethane is tight fitted around the can.  I still need to add some glue . So far the wheels don't move much but one of them moves a bit when it gets warm.
I think I will add the glue on one side, so that I can replace the wheel when it is worn out.

I actually removed the bearing tube. The small bearings inside the stator are only used to center the stator. I used JB weld to glue the stator to the axle and aluminum. 

Indeed, removing the stator is not possible. I hope they last :slight_smile: 

Thx for the tip

The idea of the amount of material taken off of those trucks scares me. Hopefully the stator tube and bearings can handle the bending load. I'd mostly be worried about the centre side bearing. Think you'll be replacing that a lot. Otherwise, super cool build! Nice DIY skills and innovations.

The bit size was indeed smaller than the can. To press it on the can, I first put the thane in hot water to make it a bit more elastic.

For coring I used a hole saw for metal with a pilot drill for alignment. The pilot drill goes into the skatebearings. I sprayed water to keep the dust away and cool the saw. The bearings dont like the water, so if you want to reuse them you need to take them apart and dry them.

Solder the 3x 5V together and solder the 3x 0V together. Then you have 5 wires coming from the sensors. Connect these to the vesc. See:

Thanks so much for sharing these hall sensors. I modified the first motor over the weekend and after braking 3 of them and finding out that i soldered one sensor the wrong way it finally worked.

Is there a tip rom you to hold the sensors in position while you solder them and glue them in. I tried to use a bit of glue to hold them in position so that i can solder them. But it didn't work very well.

BTW i could find out that one of my hall sensors were wrong by the help of this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efYFOHnXh0E
2 sensors mesaured 3,6V and one only 0,6V. So i checked it again and found my wrongly soldered wires.

Yes, soldering is a pain. Ordering some extra to practice is a good idea. I soldered them on the bench before putting them in between the slots. I think I used double sided tape to fixate them on the table. I tested them separetely with a 9 volt battery and a magnet.

Hello Peter, 

Do you have any tips how to remove the bearings and tube inside the SK3 motor tube?
Is it the same technique you use when pulling out bearings out of wheels? 
Do you need to heat the stator ? 

I don't manage to get them out. I'm thinking of just leaving them in and put epoxy in it when putting them on the axle.

After a lot of waiting and vacation. I finished mine! under load it makes a humming sound but free rolling and at cruise speed you don't hear a thing. (bldc) 
It's even more silent than my carvon v2 in foc (probably because my bearings are getting a little bit old)

Anyway, Thanks Peter for this amazing tutorial. 

(atm it's on a cheap chinese board. Going to be placed on a different one after further testing)

Hey guys! 
I was super inspired by your guys builds and I just doing this build myself.  If anyone who's done this build before or know the specifics I would really like some input.  Really appreciate the help!

Questions:
- What are the ways you know of or have tried to connect the stator to the axle?
- Is the 'axle' thats in the SK3 removable or do you have to drill it out?  Any other tricks to get the bearing into the end of the motor?

Axle in the motor is removable.   You just gotta give it some extra love ;)

Just wondering did you use a lathe to core out the wheels?

@pat.speed I used a 2 1/4 inch hole saw with a 5/16th inch drill bit that i put inside the bearing

Ahh good idea, Iâ€™ll see if I can find a hole saw with a 8mm drill bit and 59mm outer hole

@pat.speed

You might be able to find them cheaper somewhere else but here is what I used:

Dear Peter.

I'm a new member of ESK8. I'd like to connect a sensor motor to my Xerun XR8 ESC (I've been had XR8 ESC already)

But I can not identify the wiring of sensor cable on XR8 (all six wires are black) 

I saw that you installed hall sensor to the motor and connect to your XR8 ESC. So can you help me to identify the wiring of sensor cable on XR8.

Thank you
```
