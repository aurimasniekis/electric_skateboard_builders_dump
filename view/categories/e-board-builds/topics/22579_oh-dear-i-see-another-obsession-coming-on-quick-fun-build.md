OK, so I am an overweight guy push'n 50 who thought it would be fun to skateboard with my 12yo son.
Bless his heart, he bought me a $45 longboard from K-Mart  so I could ride with him.
Never been on a skate board in my life, but after a few bruises, I started having fun. 
Being a lazy arse, I figured that the only way I could keep up with him is by cheating !
I ordered some cheap crap from E-bay, cracked the shitz trying to make it work and bought some better stuff  from enertion.
Today, I slapped the bits together and it managed to drag my fat arse down the road with a big smile on my face !

*K-Mart longboard (Australia) deck and trucks
*Bones bearing
*Cheap ebay motor N5065 320Kv (KV too high in hindsight)
*Cheap ebay motor mount (With dremel mods and lots of epoxy ! )
*enertion VESC
*enertion 12mm pulley kit
*enertion wheels
*Puffy old 6s, 5000mha LiPo 
*Old wiring loom from my ebike
* 2.4Ghz remote from old RC car
