Hello Guys,
I've recently been hard at work with my most recent builds (see other: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/carbon-stealth-bomber-dual-hubs-dual-vesc-10s3p-18650-freebord-bindings/8657) 

I am also working on this board. The Juggernaut. Named that way because of the massive power this thing has. 
It is a dual diagonal setup using my 6378 motors (not yet in. Going to be using a single 192 KV SK3 for now)
It will (probably) have an 18/36 gearing and it will run at 10S. The battery is a custom made li-ion pack, 10S3P.
The enclosure is a Psychotiller custom. The trucks are caliber II stained green. Wheels are 90mm flywheel clones. I will be using Enertion pulleys. The motor mount is currently undecided, but I will most likely be using a custom mount.

As for lights, I am using LED strip lights from hobbyking that can be controlled by a standard RC remote. I am also using shed lights as headlights. A little expensive, but the luxury is nice.

Current Pictures:

Yeah did you get it last Friday? And did you notice it came from NYC (28th st) and wrapped in paper bags. That was because I opened it accidentally.

That green looks SHARP man!  curious how you like the headlights too.  I keep thinking i'll do similar, but haven't yet.

You guys should meetup and ride!  NYC looks like a great city to esk8 in.

Look forward to seeing this rolling and done - keep up the good work.
