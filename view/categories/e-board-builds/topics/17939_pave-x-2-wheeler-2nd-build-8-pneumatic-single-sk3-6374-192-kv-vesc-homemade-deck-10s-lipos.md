Hello esk8ters.

I bumped into [Vertigo's caster board](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=76328) (Endless 
Sphere) a while back and thought that it looked like a very cool project.  Not so sure how well this thing is going to perform but that's part of what makes it interesting, I guess.  Also wanted to get into machining aluminum so this seemed like a good project for that. Did not want to deal with custom battery pack so will be using lipos.  Wanted to keep the cost down so decided to go with a wood deck although I really like Vertigo's design with the carbon fiber and custom battery. Keeping the gearing / voltage the same as [my other rig](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/diy-cherry-stick-trampa-infinity-trucks-8-slickline-wheels-ollin-vescs-dual-sk3-6374-149-kv-scramboard-motor-mounts-and-pulleys/4805) since I'm happy with it.  Hats off to Vertigo for his excellent engineering work and for posting his designs. 

----------

Some of the design work in F360:

Decided battery compartment looked too much like a toaster so changed the design. ( I did make the mold and vacuum formed it, however. I learned I needed to make something with more draft angle so that I could remove it from the mold.)  (Shout out to Spencer Bracamontes at GrabCad for the wheel assembly.)

Different battery compartment design:

There is plenty of room for two 5.0 Ah lipos plus some wiring/connectors in the case above.  I'll be making the mold out of wood on the CNC then forming it with a [vacuum forming machine](http://formechinc.com/product/300xq/) using ABS plastic. I'll be 3D printing a skirt that will fit under the case which will be connected to the deck. Not sure how to fasten case to it yet. Maybe some thumb screws.  New to vacuum forming so we'll see how that goes.

From bits to atoms.  Starting to cut things.

The center channel will allow for power cables to reach VESC which will fit into rectangular pocket.  Wiring and receiver should fit here too.

Motor mount detail.

Have very little room to work on the 12" X 12" alu plate so fixturing is quite a puzzle.  Still trying to deal with chip weld since I don't have a mister/cooler.

Very crowded work area trying to get all the 0.5" thickness parts onto one plate.

Some early parts.  Tested the  bushing and seems to fit well.

These parts came out pretty good.  Just some light sanding needed.  

More to come...

Spent a lot of time on the CNC yesterday. Got most of the parts cut out.  Been using more oil to keep tool cooler and prevent chip welding. That seems to be working pretty well.  Here are some pics:

Decided to first create some channels (of profiles) so I could load them up with oil. Use compressed air to keep chips out of way of cutting tool.

Just realized a few minutes ago that I put the pocket for the motor mount on the wrong side. :dizzy_face:  I'm all out of 1/2 inch aluminum stock. :crying_cat_face: I think I have a solution using some 0.25" stock that I have.  Back to CAD.

Okay. So I think the solution to putting the pocket on the wrong side of the motor mount came out okay. Would have preferred to have done it right, in the first place, but hey...  Ended up taking all the material out of the motor void and then creating a part using .25 inch alu with tabs that sits into the void.

This is what it should have looked like from the the get-go.  I guess on the upside, if I ever decide to use a motor with a different hole pattern, I can swap out the plate. This way, it's kind of modular.

Next, need to clean up the parts and see how they fit together.

Wow.. really nice work.. keep it up and post the following result! I think in some way this is way better than 4 or 3 wheeled boards.. Less weight, less Tire wear.. better maneuvurability (possibly).

At least the ''original'' project author said it is quite good at low speed + stays stable at high speeds :slight_smile:

There was this weird name called eboard which also used 2 wheels.. Though the front was like ''caster'' wheel.. will go to look it up now :)

I'm so hyped that actually right now am sketching my caster board project. I also found 60t 25H sprocket that would go nicely with trampa hypa hubs. It's actually pretty simple desing to bring it to life, I was wondering last week or so what can I do with the spare parts, electric scooter or mono drive longboard were options, but THIS looks even simpler in my head. 
I'm keeping my fingers crossed for OPs build and hopefully in some time I will show mine :D

Thanks for link to the two wheeler.  Had not seen that one before.

Yeah, I think two wheels has some advantages over three or four like you mention above, but not sure how it actually performs. Wondering if it will have the same precise feeling of a trucked board.  Would be nice it it doesn't get wobbly at high speeds.  We'll see...

Hi.  Thanks.
I'm using the Laguna IQ HHC.  I agree; it's the perfect size for this kind of thing.  I think being smaller also helps make it a little stiffer, so better with aluminum.  Not as good as a Tormach, I'm sure, for metals, but a good all-rounder for woods/plastics and metals.

Got the motor mount assembly completed and all connected together.  Feels like it's going to be pretty sturdy. Lots of attachment points to deck. The pocket you see will hold the VESC and hopefully the receiver too. Planning on covering this whole area in 1/8" alu sheeting.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/1/a106dde05cd68ba3793ff5a86982ee7e6fe4cb6a.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Been thinking of adding a foot grab in front in order to be able to lift front of board when needed (bumps, curbs, fashion poodles...)  Any thoughts on this?  Wondering if it's just going to be painful if (when) I need to jump off the board fast. I've seen something similar on other boards.  Also wanted to make it dual use as a handle. Seems like a pretty good place to pick up the board. 

Also will be 3D printing an air scoop that should help ram air onto the motor.  But really, doing it just because it looks cool. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:  Thoughts on the foot lift appreciated.

That looks really cool. Can't wait to see how this turns out. As far as the foot grab, how about just using a pair of the freebord bindings? The one you're proposing looks really nice integrated into the board though. I think you would just need it to be sloped a bit like a shoe so it's more ergonomic.

Been working on the drive train assembly.  

Here you can see how the VESC fits into the pocket.

Got the struts connected to the deck.  The struts will  be sheeted over, covering this area. Not sure if I'm going to use ABS plastic or aluminum.  The motor was longer than I had calculated in the CAD drawings so I had to remove a small pocket in the side of strut so that the end of the motor would not rub on the strut.

Wish I had a longer belt. Had to remove a little material from strut axle channel in order to move the wheel forward a couple mils so that the belt wouldn't be too tight.  Am using a 490mm belt. Could not find a 495 or 500 in the right width.

Had to make a spacer to move the wheel gear out to the side more, otherwise the wheel would not have been centered. 1/4 inch alu did the job.

Need to make some spacers to place on axle to keep wheel centered. Also still need to drill holes for the clamp-down bolts needed to hold the rear axle in place.

Been connecting many of the alu pieces together with hardware. Lots of measuring, drilling and tapping.

Here's the front assembly. Still waiting for the correct size shoulder bolts. The ones I ordered before were a little short. Some of the bushings seem a little tight around the shoulder bolts I do have. Not sure of the best way to create a little more room in there.  Tried drilling one out and adding some oil. Better but not great. Seems like this assembly needs to be very low friction but maybe not...<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/b/9b7289c76132cd306792f18b96fe6c97f14bd520.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Coming along nicely! So it happens that I finished almost every part of mine build yesterday, I will post a thread tonight :D All that's left for me is to bead blast aluminium parts and get them anodised black.

@bill_f As for the front assembly, I leave my tight, bushings will wear out after time, and consider that roughly 40 kg force will be making whole thing to turn, a little friction won't be a problem in this case, I think that it also may help at high speeds. Just one more thing, You put those bushings and front linkages opposite than they're supposed to I think. The shoulder of those bushings should be facing inwards, to create a low friction surface, I left mine protruding 1mm above surface of linkages, I noticed vertigo did the same in his build.

Thanks for the tips.  Yeah, I'm trying to figure out the frictional forces on this assembly. Since I still don't have the shoulder bolts, can't get real feedback yet.  But what you said makes sense. I didn't notice the direction of the bushings in Vertigo's build. I'll also move them out maybe half a mil, like you suggested. I don't have a lot of room in there but I can always make more space if needed.
Interested in seeing what you have designed and built!

I can comment on how that board (edit: YiiBoard) preforms (mine is being shipped right now, but I got to test drive one back in Dec), You can see by the specs it's by no means a fast board. For me though it was all about speed, I could tell that the faster I went the more stable it was, but it was also extremely stable at low speed. There is a bit of balancing you have to do, and I found it awkward that the board doesn't fight when you bank it (no bushings obviously). What I noticed though is that while the board is pretty high (and makes it difficult to get up on before you set off) that height helps it to be stable, at low speed if I wobbled too much during a tight turn, I had enough clearance to keep from bottoming out. This allowed me to stay on the board and apply more throttle to pull myself out of a turn that would have likely stopped me. Much like a motorcycle or dirtbike, the act of adding power helps to self right the vehicle and keep from falling over. The guy who had been ridding it for several months said I was quicker than anyone to pick it up. He thinks it maybe due to my background in skateboarding / natural balance, I think it's because I was afraid to be aggressive on the throttle. 

I think it has a lot to do though with the fact that the wheel is behind the caster, (unlike on a bike where the "caster" is more behind the wheel) that when you add more speed it wants to pull the wheel straight. So with this really cool design I don't know if your "caster" would work the same way, or if it would work more like a bike / scooter.

Hi. Had to wait for some shoulder bolts to arrive from China.  Made some progress on the steering mechanism.  Drilling and tapping holes is going pretty slow.  Haven't been able to get the shoulder blocks totally perpendicular so needed to do some modifying of bolts so that there is smooth travel.  Need to create holes for shoulder bolts on front struts next, which should be interesting since they are at 15 degrees.  Probably will create some kind of jig out of MDF to hold things perpendicular although haven't had much luck with the jig I made for the CNC for the other parts (the small blocks that connect to the front axle).

How's the riding coming along? Is it getting easier? Any modifications?
After watching your video, I'm a little afraid to get on this thing. :cold_sweat:

Nope, no modifications yet, I kinda manage to ride it straight and do slight carving just for now. You can see in my thread I picked up parts from anodizing and put all of this together. 

Starting to ride on this thing is the hardest part, from there it should get easier and easier as You gain speed, my advice, don't be afraid to go fast :wink: and obviously wear full protection.

**Vacuum Forming**

(Getting close to riding this thing. Just need to do some soldering to connect VESC and pwr, and final adjustments.)

Going with my second design for battery enclosure. First one looked too much like a granny toaster. 

The toaster with plastic (that I had to cut in order to get off mold)
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/2/124ed87d2dd6a6fa5df985d3abaa26c5f3ffa041.jpg" width="666" height="500">

</br>
Rendering below shows what I was going for.  3d printed a hoop that connects to board. Enclosure sits on top of it, holding it in place. Still not sure how to secure it. Maybe magnets. Maybe a vertical bolt. Don't want any rattle, and with heavy batts, needs to be pretty secure.

</br>
Had to make mold first.  Here you see the mold with the roughing passes done. Learned after making the toaster that I needed more draft angle so that plastic could be easily removed from mold. This one worked well.

</br>
One of the biggest challenges seems to be how to cut the part from the excess plastic.  I decided to use the CNC to cut it off. Worked OK.  Should have offset the cut a mil or two beyond the original shape. Came out nice and even on bottom though (planar), which is the main thing I wanted.

Final part showing 3d printed hoop skirt which will be attached to deck. Fit is good. Pyramidal shape means enclosure gets tighter as it's pushed down.  Used 4 mm ABS for enclosure. Feels nice and solid.

Glad to see You make progress in this build! I was really curious how it was going. Can't wait to hear what You have to say about riding it :D 

Did you use normal vacuum cleaner to form enclosures? I must say You nailed it :clap:

Slowly coming along.  If I get my butt in gear I might have it ridable in a couple days although I see rain in the forecast. 
I used a formech vacuum former (300 XQ).  Took a few tries to get the plastic at the right temp, but after that, it's pretty easy.  I like the final product compared to 3d printing but it's time consuming making the mold.  Thinking of putting the same batt case on my other ride (which has been taking a lot of my time as I try to figure out the weak motor issue). I see you've been having ESC issues with your 4-wheeler as well.

Thanks man.  Yeah, the CNC is a pretty useful thing to have around.  Adds a new dimension to vacuum forming.
Love what you're doing with your custom enclosures.  Makes the final build look really polished and pro.

**Ridden**!

Finally got things together and was able to test this thing out.  It's an interesting ride, for sure.  Not as precise as a four-wheeler (or bike, for that matter) but fun nonetheless.  It's "fun" as in, "this is challenging" kind of way--but not impossible or frustrating. Kind of like when you started to learn to ride a two wheeler. It got a little easier as time went by. Did not go too fast but not too slow either. Did not have my full road rash gear.  As @squad mentioned, it does get more stable at speed although it's not too bad at slow speeds either, imo.  Started out holding onto something then pushing off. Later was able to push off and get going unassisted.   Was able to make gentle turns, the kind of stuff you would have to do to stay on city roads while avoiding pedestrians. Once I get padded up, will make this thing go faster.

Some photos.  Still have a few things to do like add grip tape, CB Radio, etc.

First, some glamour shots. Ignore the bird crap and misplaced electrical tape.

Covered up with ABS enclosure.  Need to make channel in deck a little wider to accommodate both wires from batts. although it fits.

The whole mess. Will be milling something from Alu. for the top that accepts a Ny-Loc nut. This set-up stayed on well with regular nut and hand tightening. Want to add an off/on switch on top or side of this case. A voltmeter here could be nice too.

Ride vidz coming soon. Thanks for your interest.
 Would be great if more people got into this 2 wheel thing and played with different configs. I think this has some potential.

The new hubs and tires arrived a couple days ago. Figured I should take some pics before they get all scuffed up. 
Having fun riding this thing.

How heavy is it by the way?

I assume this thing should be way less heavy than 4wheeled / 3 wheeled boards :) + doesnt have a handle bar like scooters has.. 5kg?

Maybe it also needs some springs.. or bushings for the steering.. :D

Have you learnt to control it better now?

Haven't weighed it yet but it's significantly lighter than my other board.  The struts and steering mech are aluminum so not too heavy. 
The steering is getting easier with practice. It's pretty precise but definitely different than a skateboard. The challenge makes it pretty fun to ride.

mh 9kg is still quite a bit.. I assume the middle section is pretty heavy..

Single drive mountainboard with 6inch wheels and ~400wh / 36cell battery weights 10.2kg or so..

Without battery it was about 8.2kg

With the heavier 9''inch wheels it is about 11.8 kg or so I think, wheels alone weight 2kg almost I think :D

Some raw ride footage from ride no. 6. Got about 50 kilometers on it now. Tried to show the steering assembly in action by Jobying the Gopro to my leg. Max speed about 31 kph. Just realized watching the video that I lost my air scoop. Need to print a new one and find a better way fasten it. It was only on with some hot glue.  More video on the way.

Sounds fun.. I both like and dislike the motor/vesc produces when speed is higher.. :D

Looks like u got some pretty good speed there :slight_smile:

On a side note.. would u prefer if the steering mechanism ''was slower'' or it is good as it is?

I kind of like the steering as it is, probably just 'cause I'm used to it now.  Not sure if by slower you mean tighter (more friction) or maybe a different geometry that is less responsive.  It's definitely functional and will probably improve as my riding gets better over time.

After riding it quite a bit, doesn't seem like it's necessary.  Haven't been jumping off curves with it. :grimacing:  I find it's hard to reposition feet once you get moving.  Maybe with more practice...
