Please get a different remote. The winning remote is a disaster waiting to happen

I had used that remote for over a year in my previous build (which I haven’t posted up here )and I haven’t encountered any problem. Hopefully there won’t be in the future too.

Ok well just be careful and try to stay away from tram lines because they have been known to cause drop outs

the winning v2 is supposed to be pretty good. Im with you tho, I recommend the mini remote from @JLabs. Rock solid from my testing

Yeah I've never heard of a drop out with the mini remote except for when the batteries are flat

Love to see how the hangers for the Jacob DD turn out. Personally doing a very similar conversion with my own set of Jacobs, and the good thing about this motor is that you can easily bore the stator hole out to 12mm. Replace the shitty grub screws with stakes that go right through the stator and into the axle. Hardest part is honestly machining the hanger piece that holds the 12mm axle.

Thanks for the advice
Might want to get a new one tbh

So did you bore the black core in the hub?
I was going to make a connector but but then I decided to use the internal 8mm axle instead. How did you secure the motor?

I deleted the photos, but I really don't recommend using a 8mm axle. Talked with @fliess and he's pretty steadfast about using 12mm DD axles.

8mm on this side:

12mm on the other side:

Edit: You can see how the grub screw holes aren't holding up too well.

The area between the copper and the bearing. Literally stake a screw right through. And while you're at it, might as well add some halls. Jacobs don't fair well with take off on BLDC..

I will add halls detector :D thanks for your suggestion 
I still don't have my motor now so i am still not sure how the two grub screws works

```
The grub screws basically "lock" the stators to the hanger. They're too small and easily sheer the holes they sit in, so I'm of the opinion that grub screws and inadequate for hub motors. Thus staking is much better.

Better then grub screws. https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/f/3fa74e638b1b9dc99b5065126d5f135ac32e180d.JPG

Sad news
The mechanical part of the drive cannot be made to school reasons. But the project can still continues if I can get a carvon be or exo, as it is not a school project but a personal project.
I'm thinking of carvon speeddrive R, speeddrive xl or carvon exo, though I believe carvon be group buy is now ended.
Hopefully there are someone selling them

Wtf man I have this exact same deck at home haha so you did fold it and top mount electronics ?

Yep. Was looking for a micro drop deck but I don't want to destroy a perfectly good deck should I ever fail. Top mount battery was to deal with the low tolerance between the deck and the ground.

True it is pretty low ! How do you deal with the flex ? There's good amount right in the middle !

I added in extra mdf between the boards so to remain the flex. Locks was installed on both sides of the board to ensure it wouldn't fold up in the middle of the ride. The battery also serves as a weight the counteract the upward force that the folding up mechanism handles drying the ride. I installed the focbox below the board behind the curve as it isn't taking that much space.

Update:
Uni is busy but I spent a bit of time to get it together. Not enough time to tighten everything up for a long run but it's now good for a few miles![IMG_20190908_012555_640|255x500](upload://t4FUqzaqQKwpDcWa99bX53C78O9.jpeg)

```
can you please send a picture of how you mounted the ESC? I have a similar build done, but without the folding mechanism. I mounted the esc on top of the back trucks, but I'm not happy with that.
Also how hard was it to mold the kydex to the battery?
