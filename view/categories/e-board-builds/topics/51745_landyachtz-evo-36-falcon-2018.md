I’ve seen quite a few Evo builds but now in 2018 Landyachtz released a shorter version of it. Post up your build pics and thoughts about this board :) 

I still haven’t received mine so I can’t find out how big enclosure I can have on this. Anyone have theirs and can do some measuring/take some pics?

Wow I really like the red bottom, I already feel like the evo is a bit small I wonder how these feel lol. I can spread out my feet more on my other decks cause of then not being a drop down.

yea well im rather large im 6'6" and i wear size 16 mens shoes (US) i can tuck but its takes some getting used to on the Evo i generally have a wider stance on other boards. My tuck was better on my Raptor but my Raptor is not as fast or as stable as my evo

we love the Falcon with Paris 180s, Purple Nipples, SAN-O bearings in Big Zigs.  

idk if I'd prefer the Falcon over the legacy model for esk8 (the point is portability)

ours arrived two weeks ago.  I'll try to take pics of the 'after' :slight_smile:

Would be great if you could post measurements here so more can enjoy :) I imported the picture to fusion and took out some measurements after scaling it on lenght. It’s nof accurate but it’s something. I’ll upload that later when I get home if you don’t beat me to it :D

DISCLAIMER, this is made by importing a picture to fusion 360 calibrating it for the 914mm lenght and doing a rough sketch on top of that.. Hopefully someone with the board can do some proper measuring as this is NOT accurate. 

![evofalcon|690x395](upload://b3X2GZgkyaH8jjA4wZcqatuDacY.png)

I then made a sketch of the enclosure on eskating.eu with 12s4P and two vesc6 to testfit. No clue if I can stack the cells that good but it looks like plenty of space there for a receiver, a bms, switch and some wires? I'm new to this so just tell me I'm stupid and that I missed something :D

Double stacking them on a drop like this may be too close to the ground for comfort. Unless of course you use six shooters or other pneumatics.

I have double stack on my Evo and it's quite low but with 107s never had problems other than those short tall speed bumps. I did jump a curb at 20mph by accident by the time I noticed there was a curb it was too late I had to commit and my board was fine no scraping and I didn't fall lmao.

I'ver often thought an ideal esk8 race deck could be a community-designed "Evo" of our own.

Specifically, designing a 38" longneck (designed for 107s) with a 10 in.-wide "Evo-esque" floorpan, and halve the drop to create a little headroom for an integrated enclosure.

Doesn't need to be narrow, since nobody is pushing.

Open-source design on the deck and enclosure, naturally.

...perhaps do a limited run with @treenutter :slight_smile:

Is it to optimistic trying to fit 12S4P on the falcon? I ordered 50 cells from Nkon but I still haven't pulled the trigger on BMS so I could go 10S still. Would just be awesome to have that extra umpf :D

How I've been riding it: Landyachtz Falcon wearing flat black Paris trucks, Riptide Sports reds and "rare" NOS Abec 11 BigZigs 75mm 83a in Reflex Lemon, with Zealous bearings.

I have a detailed drawing over the board and will make a negative mould for the battery pack and 3d print it. I just need some help from you more experienced guys with what space I need around things. VESC6 cases will be machined to fit inside the enclosure and I might have to make a dual mount that's stacking them a bit. I've never done this before but the plan is to 3d print a negative mold and use fiberglass/carbon fiber and make a enclosure around this. Prolly need to add something to the 3d print before I add epoxy but I'm sure this is covered on the forum somewhere before so will search some for it. Initial thought is to make something that goes almost all the way back to the trucks and covers some of the riser and is thick enough to fit a single layer of batteries. 

-Should I work for not stacking cells on top of eachother? 
-How much room do I need around the cells for packing? 5mm? 
-How much space is needed on the side of the cells for wires and such?

Edit: I think we  can fit 12S4P but it won't be with much space left :D trucks/wheels from grabcad and vesc case from @stewii ^^ 
![Enclosure v7|690x393](upload://138TebHEx0AFUVL6QfvbSWboRAu.jpg)

Edit: There should be place for it including batteries. The tray is 27mm deep from the deck and 3mm thick here. It's just a rough first design. Will try to improve it before 3d printing a "negative" for moulding.

I think the final mold negative model is done. Not much space left but since I'm going to use carbon fiber on top of this mold I get additional 3mm on side/bottom. Height inside is 27mm. It's a bit more room on the edges left on this last model as I had to give more than 10mm to put screws on ^^ Hope anyone can chime in if I did something stupid here else I'm going to start 3d printing the form tomorrow so I can start fabricating one to test. I got 2 square meters of carbon fiber sheet (200gr/m2) that I think I will use to make it. How many layers is needed?

I'll buy a prototype from you, check the fit if you'd like.

It's funny, but I keep going back to the Falcon over my Icarus.  The Falcon is very fast and very forgiving which allows for weird stuff like this lol

![+E%9SgWbQ1G9jQuT0wwUGQ|500x500](upload://fUEUc9n5vBPXFgvkLDs4sADo1S1.jpg)

LEAN board wheels from pramash.com are surprisingly fast and even better with Avenue trucks (Paris pictured here) - the rounded shape of these 101MM wheels means they don't bite on Avenue 180s, so one can keep the slim, push-friendly width of the Falcon.

Its a little strange going from the Evo to Evo Falcon, the size difference is minimal but enough to make you change your stance.  

The biggest thing for me was after trying 2 drop-through decks I can actually carve decently on this without either killing my feet or scrubbing the motors,  I doubt I'll do a drop through again.  I've got a loaded tan tien if anyone is interested.

Depending on wheel choice and setup you can put the deck in 3 different positions in respect to the height above ground, in total allowing to shift the deck 30mm up or down.
You can fit our 83mm and 90mm urethane wheels, Gummies and pneumatics, using the same motor mount, deck and truck. All you need is a different belt and slave pulley for the wheel. The conversion from street wheels to pneumatics can be done within 10 minutes.

To come up next.....

They can be flexy or quite stiff, depending on Plys and battery box length.
Our current test board has 14 Ply and can carry 85KG riders with a bit of flex.
14, 15 and 16 Ply will be available to get started.

This is a 41.  I'm in love with the evo as well.  I was just thinking on the 36 falcon for the next.

Not enough space :/  Have .5 in riser, will it need more?

this little beast ships to @psychotiller mañana (sound of angels singing) for professional tuning.

W concave in the rear isn't necessary considering the deck is a split-angle setup. Naturally speaking, it's going to be very rare for you to send the board sideways. In terms of features, the EVO is indeed "outdated" versus the newer decks out there. The Talon comes with a front and rear downturn and upturn tail respectively. This makes kicking  up the deck much easier. Carryability is also improved as a direct result of the downturned nose. The Talon's width from front to rear does not taper as significantly as the EVO. This gives a generous foot platform that's just that much more comfortable to stand on for casual stanced riding. The radial concave decreases its height down the length of the board giving you a very even directional stance for your feet. On the EVO where your rear foot feels somewhat too centerset on the deck, the Talon's progressive concave allows your rear foot to comfortably hang off the edge more easily.. translating to easier modulation of your weight in a turn. Is the EVO to be respected? Of course, it's still a legend of a deck. However I do firmly believe there are better offerings out there now...

You can always throw in scrap griptape if you wanted to up the amount of W concave. however going off of your pics, your rear foot is still really close to the center. Actually it looks like your rear foot can use more width in the rear of the deck... I can't really tell you how to ride, since everyone has their own preference. However a wider rear like in the case of the Talon DOES help your stance in this case. Griptape off the edge is meant to solve the original issue of having a too aggressive concave that makes it hard to grip your rear foot when you hang off the edge. As I said in my previous comment, the Talon's rear concave **decreases when nearing the end of the deck**, making it much easier for you foot to hang off the edge of the deck whilst still having adequate contact with the griptape.

My model is done. Board is still in customs so maybe sometime next week... I have a few questions for the epoxy process tho. I would like to use carbon fiber to make this eventually so vacuum would be preferred. I do have a vacuum pump that I use for re gassing air condition systems on car so I was wondering if I could use this? I also bought some plastic bags for vacuuming food but will I be able to get these off after the epoxy has cured? What should I use on the 3d print so the epoxy doesn't stick to bad?

Render in the link below. I'm hoping for 48 cells in 12S4P config but I don't have the bms or vescs yet so hard to know. I'm considering making a dual vesc 6 case for the escapes and trying to stack them to save space but I need them here to measure and design the case. Haven't decideded if I'm gonna mold it inside or outside this 3d printed case. If I do it outside there will be more space obviously but it's allready quite deep at 25mm inside of it..

The deck arrived today. Looks really great :D The fit on the printed enclosure isn't to bad either but I'm considering cutting of the "brim" of the print and moulding the enclosure onto the deck for  a perfect fit. Is that the common way to do it? How many layers of 200gr/1m2 carbon fiber does it need to hold up?

Depends on the thickness of your cloth.

But with fiberglass, 5-6 layers of heavy cloth. Honestly if you are going to give your hand a try at carbon, I would just do the outer layer as carbon, and glass behind it. If you've never glassed before, there will be mistakes and waste :) best to keep the cost down until you get your catalyst/resin mixes right, and don't end up with something flimsy(to much resin) or to brittle(to little resin).

Good point! I did buy fiberglass since I’m sure I’m going to F....up so will follow your advice. The carbon fiber is 200gr/1m2 thickness. I’m going to use west system epoxy for the job since I have a can of it from carbon fiber work on a RC sailer. It’s brown ish like you can see from the 3D print that I coated with one layer of epoxy. I’m not sure if this will show once it’s in with the carbon fiber but for the first attempt it’s function above looks and then I can make a second one where I learn from some of my mistakes. I also think this is to thick at 27mm so might have to do a thinner for later anyways.


Oh I mix resin with a kitchen weight so the mix is according to west systems spec. I’ve done this on previous work and it’s pretty accurate.

I made my first attempt at making an enclosure today. I suspect this shape isn’t the easiest to start with lol :p I have done 3 layers of 300gr/m2 fiberglass coated with west systems epoxy between the layers and then 2 layers of 200gr/m2 on top. I put on the layers wet-wet and was supposed to have another layer of carbon fiber on top but I ran out of epoxy. This will be a total of 900gram/m2 fiberglass + 400gram/m2 carbon fiber or 1300gram/m2 thickness total. Is this gonna be solid enough or do I need more layers?

@Minim, very nice work dude on enclosure! However, I still do not understand, why people prefer fiberglass enclosures to let's say from Kydex :confused: I just love this material, it handles any abuse, you can slide with it over curbstones, it's much more elastic, handles minus temperatures.

I do see only 1 reason why fiberglass could be preferred - it's easier to make enclosure of any shape with it.
Sorry for off-topic, but maybe you can shed a light for me :-)

Thnx!

I’ve never heard of kydex tbh. I only saw that many where doing the enclosures in fiberglass/carbon fiber and figures that I’d try that as a first build. I never saw anyone mentioned how thick it had to be tho so maybe this is to brittle. The epoxy is solid stuff but as you say it’s prone to breaking. Only time will tell I guess. Will look further into kydex :)

Resin is mixed 1:5 by weight so I hope it’s good. That’s how I always mix it for when I build carbon RC-sailers and I’ve found it to be the most simple way. Some pictures here. It sure needs some cleanup and since I ran out of epoxy it could do with one more layer on top for the looks of it on the outside. Will gently sand it and put on another coat once my order of epoxy arrives.

Finally home from a business trip and able to do some more work on the landy. Nobody else building theirs? I cut the case clean today and sanded/grinded the inside to clean it up after moulding. I applied west system epoxy + 404 high density filler so it was thick enough to fill dents and pockets inside so it's flat and nice. It feels kinda thin so I'm tempted to do a last layer of carbon fiber on the outside before coating the top. It's just so much work that goes to waste if it cracks when I'm done building.. 

Vesc6 (escape) is in route for next week and so is the BMS. I will try to mill vesc6 alu cases tomorrow so I'm ready for when it arrives.

Yeah, there's about 5 build threads on the Evo Falcon.  I personally have 2.  I don't get any flex, I'm 185 lbs.  I still wouldn't cut any of the deck away.  On an Evo you have room to make it up as its long, but on the falcon your feet are much closer together so more weight is directed towards the center.  I know 3 inches doesn't sound like much but it makes a difference.

Had a test drive with the board on Friday. I’m impressed by the power but it was really sluggish and unresponsive on the control. When I went on the brakes it was about 1sec delay before it started breaking. 

I have fixed the escapes to the deck with 8xm3 screws and the battery sits with Velcro + one band fixed with 2xm5 screws. I have to figure out a way to get the motor cables out of the enclose and it’s ready for some proper testing.

Followed your advice and it looks way more solid now. I will let the epoxy cure for 24 hours before I put load on it. I used the "crimp" tool in addition to get a good squeeze. 

On a slightly other topic. I have 12S4P samsung 30q and they have a fast charge of 4A so tota of 16A. Should I then keep at or below -8A battery amps for braking? That sounds very very low. I have set it to 40A batmax (80 total) for the positive side.

Well it depends on how you like your brakes.  You are only braking in short bursts.  You could inch that up if you feel your brakes are too weak for your liking. I have mine a -12 each.

I have them set at -20 each now and it feels weak :blush: Will turn them further down so I don't ruin my battery. I didn't test it much outside yet since my enclosure isn't fitted so will experiment some more. I don't think the breaks can be strong enough so I just want to set it as high as possible without breaking the battery.

Wow I didn't expect heat to be this big of an issue. These thermal images is taken 15-20minutes after the ride when I got home. Outside temperature was 16°C. I did some hills and some pulls but nothing big. Was going slowly in max 40km/h or so since it was the first test run and it was only 4-5km ride total. I was hoping to ride a full battery but when the motor was to hot to touch I stopped riding. I think I have to design a new truck with larger surface area and maybe a duct system to get air flowing over the motor sides. I was running 60motor amps and 40bat amps pr vesc.

if you're going to design a new truck. why not move the motors inward and extend the axles. this way you can have a carvon type set up.

the cans are the same size as the carvon v4 sd. 70x70mm

That’s kinda complicated to do tho. Not sure how I can get them enough in to allow for wheels on the outside. Maybe something to consider for later tho. 

I was thinking of milling just the hanger tomorrow and reuse the axles from the raptor. Hope they are standard metric threads so I have the proper tap for them. With more alu and slightly deeper cooling fins I might gain some more cooling. The truck actually got almost as hot as the motor so the transfer works great. Just got to get rid of all that heat somehow. 

Is this a problem for big outrunners on belt also or is it a hub thing?

Bummer.. If it doesn’t work with the custom truck I might have to go belt then. 

I’m kinda disappointed with the torque/acceleration also. They are really powerfull at speed from like 15km/h and up but from standstill or if starting in a hill it feels slow like Inboard. I haven’t ridden the Inboard in a year tho so I might recall wrong but I kinda hand higher expectations of the raptor hubs. I have never tried a belt system but from what people say 6374 are pretty snappy.

Thanks. I have a lot to learn when it comes to optimizing paths in Fusion 360. Have you seen any good videos on YouTube on this subject? All I’ve learned off cnc comes from there (not a machinist by trade). 

The stock is 120x100x30mm cut from a 100x30mm bar I had around. The truck is 117.6x80x30 so it’s not that much larger than stock. Should I cut it even more down?

True but I have this benchtop saw that’s really crappy and hard to cut with. Way faster to mill off 20mm than cut it on this saw :D In a proper shop with a good saw it’s prolly another story.

Funny. I also watch that guy a lot on YouTube. I really like how he explains stuff. 

I practice as often as I can but everything takes so much more time when I don’t even know the basics.. Projects like these are perfect where dimensions doesn’t matter a lot and there is a lot of setups. I will prolly have to do 5 setups for this part.

Lol. This is really complex to me but prolly not to someone that works with cnc. This thing is a beast compared to the original one. Time will tell if it cools better. Most complex part I've machined before with 6 repositionings due to my machine center only having 3 axis. Everything including tapping is done with the cnc. The slot for the motor cable became really bad since I sacrificed doing two more operations to get it perfect.. All good for a prototype.

Is the talon actually that much better?  Looking at my evo build and the way it's shaped, it's almost built exactly for what I want out of an esk8 board.   The rear allows for a larger truck 218mm, and large motors, the front is slimmer and allows for a caliber truck for agile front steering.

The stability in the back and steering up front that it tends to naturally fits this setup so so well.

I'm listening! :D If you see anything I could Improve I'd be happy to try to change it. These things can eat more current if I can cool them I think. I'm already thinking that the best is prolly to go with straight fins all the way and maybe drill holes so air can flow through and cool over a larger surface area. Maybe I even could increase the area towards the motor more. 

Todays test is kinda not a good comparison against yesterday. I was driving at the same spot but I was driving a lot harder than two days ago. I consumed 58Wh vs 89Wh so it indicates harder use today. I also went more uphill and more time at 100% throttle and hit 51km/h compared to low 40 smt the other day. 

So for the pictures. I brought the camera to take pictures straight after a hard pull. I did register 63.5°C at the motors right after a hard pull uphill for 1km (that was third time going up/down the same hill). Yesterday I could not hold my hand on the truck after two rounds but today it was no problem to hold it there on the third but it did indeed get warm and especially when I was not riding so air could cool it down. I forgot to bring tape so the last picture of a cold truck is lying due to reflections on the bare aluminium. I also noticed that the temp of the truck increased quickly when I stopped.

Need more testing but it looks good. I doubt I will ride it any harder than I did today and I think them motor internals can handle more. What I didn't like the other day was that the truck got to hot to touch in just two pulls up that 1km stretch. I do notice that I'm WAY off topic here with all this raptor truck mumbo jumbo so I'm going to create another thread for that. Sorry for messing up the landy thread. 

The deck is amazing tho. I had 50km/h on it stable today and that's with bad trucks/bushings. Can't wait to see how this behaves if I can get better gear on it.

I can see a few things you could improve mate:

1. I think you will need to ovalize the space around the bushing seat so when the hanger leans it does not make contact with the bushing.

2. Similarly, do the shoulders of the hanger (board side) near the pivot contact the base plate? You might need a bit more clearance than you think. Under load/compression the hanger may migrate further towards the base plate than un-loaded.

those things are sorted in the later versions. You are correct  that it did get to cramped around the bushing and it did hit  the baseplate on flex. The last one I did has improvement on both those problems. You c an spot the fixes on this wider version (it does have other issues tho as marked in read...)

you could also potentially build a smaller, lighter board that could easily fit on a backpack with a small enough battery to take on flights.  

I know what you mean about not seeing much use out of a larger board.  Unless you specifically set aside time for joyrides or have a meetup esk8 group in your area, OR live along paved roads to work it's hard using it as an actual commute vehicle

That would make more sense but I need the battery size since I'm a heavy rider and it's already on the edge to beeing slow as it is (uphill especially). I work from home or travel by car/airplane at work so no commuting that makes any sense and it's 13-14km to the store so then I'd rather take the car. It's mostly for fun rides and there's been way to little time for that. If I rebuilt it as a kickbike I suspect it would be more used at/around home and by other than me since it's more stable. 

I also had a fun trip last week where it suddenly gave 100% throttle while I was cruising. It threw me off but I managed to stay on my feet. Board went straight into a construction fense and stopped. Good thing there was no pedestrians or cars around because this rocket would have done some serious damage. Won't ride it until I can figure out what that was about.

Ahhh i gotcha.  I'm a fairly light guy -> 175lbs.  so I didn't consider that.  And ya, I know what you mean about the commuting situation.  I just moved, but before there was no chance for me using my board for commuting.  Just not the right environment for it.  

Also know what you mean about too little time for fun rides.  Before move my board was relegated to dog-walking machine for about a month while I was prepping for move.  

Ya, yikes.  I had some issues with my remote at first that resulted in a similar scary situation.  

An E-bike is a totally viable option.  You could also put a bigger battery on it.

If you do end up selling stuff and piecing it out, and you don't have a use for the deck or enclosure anymore i'd totally pick them up from you

Anyone know what could have caused my board to give full throttle trying to throw me off? I was cruising and playing with giving throttle on/off to max a bit if I recall correctly and suddenly it gave full throttle and stuck there. When it was stuck at full throttle I tried braking with the remote but no response at all. I have setup failsafe so that when I loose contact with the remote or turn it off it gives no throttle so the motor freeroll/stops. I don't feel safe using it again when I can't find any errors or wrong setup anywhere and still had this issue. It will for sure happen again when timing is the worst and send the heavy board full throttle into someones legs or a car..

check your receiver cable, I've seen that happen when the cable is coming loose from the RX or ESC. Hot gluing the connectors in place usually solves the problem if the cable is ok.
you should be able to replicate this on the bench by wiggling the receiver cable and/or connectors to see if that is ithe problem

hey i was wondering if I could get the 3D printing files for your home made enclosere. it looks realy good, and will see if a 10s 5p will fit in it. btw any tips on print settings would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards
Leon
