I already have a N5065 270kv motor with a max of 8S (29.6V) using  70mm wheels with 48 tooth wheel gear and 16 tooth motor gear and I plan to buy a Maytech Vesc but I'm unsure on what to do about batteries . I will be using 18650 batteries but what is the highest cell rating i can use ?. the Maytech Vesc can go upto 12s but is limited by the 8s limit of the motor. so is the maximum I can use 8s?
I have been looking around for an answer on here and people keep talking about a "chart" for the Vesc but I am unable to find any kind of "chart". I just dont want to go buy a battary pack thats way to "high" and burn out the Vesc or motor
I want to go as FAST AS POSSIBLE with the stuff i have/going to get . as I have made a programmable transmitter and receiver and will limit the speed threw the transmitter code. I just want to be able to go faster if i wanted to without having to buy new stuff/ batteries .

With that motor, you're stuck at 8s. If you want more power, you'll need a bigger motor to handle a more powerful battery pack.

In terms of speed, that's mainly affected by your gearing - wheel size, pulley size, etc, unless you change your motor or battery.

what if i was to limit the vesc? could I put on 12s pack with the same motor but limit the speed as if using a 8s ? or is the voltage the problem ? because then i could make a 12s battary and when I have the money for a new motor i could just swap it out and de restrict the vesc ??

I've heard of people doing that, but I'm not sure how safe and/or effective it is - I've never tried. One thing I would be worried about is if you're going down a hill, you may accidentally overspeed the motor and damage the vesc.

I'm also not sure I'd trust a Maytech vesc at 12s. The most I'd personally run on one of those is 10s.

I'd also recommend going to [www.calc.esk8.today](http://www.calc.esk8.today) and experiment with your numbers, see what you come up with.

Just rewire the motor and you'll get a lower kv, then you can run 12s.
