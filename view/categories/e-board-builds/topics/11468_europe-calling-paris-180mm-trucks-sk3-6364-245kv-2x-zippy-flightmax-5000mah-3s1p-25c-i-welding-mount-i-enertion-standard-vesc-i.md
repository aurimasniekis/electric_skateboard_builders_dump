Hi guys, 

I saw this awesome video how to build your eskate for 450 dollars... Well it turned out to be significantly more with shipping, but what the heck, I can just feel the breeze in my hair. I do need a bit of help to get there. 

I also got a pulley system from enertion, a FS-GT2B from ebay and a bit of a cheap cruiser deck(103cm) that looked ok.

So far only the trucks and wheels have arrived and unfortunately I screwed up by not noticing they were round (truck bars). Soo I guess I ll weld them to the mount that I will make myself.
Electronics will be a bit of a problem since I dont have much experience except basic soldering and 3d printing skills. 
I will 3D print the enclosure after everything arrives. 

My main questions at the moment are:
1. Was there someone with a project like this one so I can copy :D?
2.Exact mount dimensions?
3. I see a lot of you are using fuses, do I need one for the VESC?
4. Where can I get a good/cheap battery meter? 
5. Did someone make STL files for the enclosure so I can print it?
6. Is there something I am missing for the build?!

For everything that I am missing and is of a decent price to order in Europe please let me know so I can aquire it.

You should try and get caliber trucks if you dont have a welder

I decided to make a mount myself (a lot of people did it with basic tools) and then have someone weld it to the trucks.

 I dunno if this is a legit way to go? 

Thanks for the thingiverse page, I ll definitely use this. What about the fuse and battery meters?

Thank you very much! I just bought it... How about the fuse though, will I burn my enertion VESC without one?

Any suggestion on these motor mounts?

I got an SK3 and enertion pulley system with 180 paris trucks and 83mm wheels. Where can I find a sketch and correct dimensions on how to make my own mount?
