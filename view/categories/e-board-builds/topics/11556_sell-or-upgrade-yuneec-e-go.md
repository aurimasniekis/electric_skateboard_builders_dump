Hi.
I buyed a Yuneec E-GO. I was really happy with it at the start, but now it seems to be a bit too slow for me. Im not sure what i should do. Try selling it, and build my own Electric skateboard, or upgrade the E-GO (if it's possible). I'm most on the first thing (selling it), But i don't have to money to build the most expensive board. But don't want to build a board that fails after 1-2 months. Anyway, could you leave some links to parts for a Diy (Deck, Motor, ESC, and so on) and suggestions. I guess my budget is about 550-600$. I'm sure it would help me a lot.
Thanks:)

Just sell it. I think they go for around $400-500 on eBay. If you modify it, no one will buy it later. DIY from scratch whip be much easier.

Yeah that should be good. Just get a VESC instead. I'm not sure if @JLabs has any more motors from the group buy but they would save you a bit and get you an already keyed motor. With the SK3 you will have to do a bit of modding.

If you were to buy the mechanical kit and motor from DIYElectricSkateboards as well as your ESC, you would qualify for free shipping and then you could spring for a VESC.
