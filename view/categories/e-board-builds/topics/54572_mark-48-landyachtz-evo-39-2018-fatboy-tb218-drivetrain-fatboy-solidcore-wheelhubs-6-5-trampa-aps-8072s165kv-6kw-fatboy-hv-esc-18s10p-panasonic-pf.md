After playing with Trampas I think I am just fighting with windmills with those problems... So I starting making normal Longboard build with AT wheels using our 1:3 gear drive.

### Mechanics

I will need a really big help on this build as I have zero understanding about normal trucks and etc. I will be using Landyachtz Evo 39" deck (I like its form and I see it was proven as a good base for @mmaner @Deckoz) So I will going to get TB218 trucks don't know about the front as I saw that @Deckoz uses the different one I am interested how different width works out. Also if it is going to work with pneumatic wheels. I can modify ET of the wheel but still have no idea about this. Also all pivot cups, barrels and wedges... So that's all regarding mechanics.

### Electronics

I will reuse everything mostly from Trampa build, dual Focboxes in our dual finned case, nano-x remote, HM-10 Bluetooth module (thinking of getting metr maybe as `esk8 vesc` app has so many flaws regarding staying on and recording) I am still working on esc/bms but I should use them later on this build.

### Enclosure

I still don't know what I am going to do I need to fit 8 packs somewhere have no idea if it going to fit underdeck right now I will just put them on top of the deck like I always do

### Parts:

* 39" Landyachtz Evo '18 Skate and Explore
* 218 Torqueboard Trucks
* FatBoy TB218 Drive Train 
* 4 x FatBoy Solid Core WheelHub with custom ET for TB218 and drivetrain
* 4 x 6.5" Trampa tires
* 2 x APS 8072S 165kv 6kW
* 2 x FatBoy HV ESC
* CNC machined X for front trucks yet to design
* 180 x Panasonic PF in 18S10P configuration

So if anyone has any suggestion which cups/wedges and etc to use on trucks and etc I will be really thankful.

There's a few things to bring up the quality, I'll edit with suggestions I came across

DIY hanger plugs. What these do is cause the hanger to rotate in a more accurate axis around the kingpin. A good thing, more precision.

Bushings -
Alphamail: 'TB218’s come with 90a cones / barrels'.

Select type of bushings for style and your weight, discussed by alphamail in several posts to this thread

Dewedging -
You can direct swap the torqueboards baseplate for Caliber baseplates which gives you the option to run a 44deg rear and a 50deg front. I'd suggest buying an entire single 10" truck in one angle and just the baseplate from the other angle(e.g. 44 truck & 50 plate), that way you have not only the option to run a dewedged rear but also to run a normal length front hanger which would aid turning radius, others have tried that and ran up to the speeds you are suggesting without wobble. If you like that you have a spare 218 for the next build or a very desirable sellable item.

https://www.sickboards.nl/en/reversed-kingpin/6101-caliber-ii-forty-four-10-trucks.html?search_query=Caliber+truck&results=17

@Deckoz has done the following with the evo

...a Randal baseplate is another option 35deg but it's not as accurate a fit as the Caliber and probably of no interest with an Evo deck, Im waiting on new pivot cups by riptide for my Randal plates to try to mesh with a tipped deck

In fact there an entire thread you should consume for angles

I weight ~83kg. I do commute long distance ~13km one way fast depends on traffic but like avg max speed is like 30-40km depends how board feels if I feel stable maybe I would go faster as there roads are basically straight no cars just bicycles... I do not do quick turns, but I do a lot of slow almost instant 90 degree turns now I need to rotate my board (two way big roads crossings has the islands where you need to walk from one side to another.

So my build... With TB218 before the raked surfrodz in the front. Was setup as

TB Hangar, 44 Caliber Baseples, 6 degree dewedge on 89a boardside barrel, 86a roadside barrel, precision cups top and bottom. For 53 degrees up front.

Evo +15, truck +44, -6 wedge =53°

Rear TB hangar, 50 Baseplate, 89a barrel top and bottom precision cups, 1/2" riser. For 35° rear

Evo -15, truck +50 = 35°

With the surfrodz up front its, Evo+15, 50, -6 = 59° +3mm rake. 

I weigh 130lb...

My buddy pshaw runs 50 Baseplate all around, just riser, for 65/35, with 95b/93r barrel and cups in rear, and 93b/90r up front. And weighs 200lb

Sand it first, you wanna rough up all the be painting surface.  

Buy high temp epoxy in whatever color you want then...

Tape the axles
Bend a coat hanger hold the hanger by the axles where you taped
Hang it up in a dust free and wind free location. 
Spray multiple light coats.

And if that doesn't **feel** right for **you**, you can switch to a 218 on the front as well.

If it does, you have a spare 218 for the next build (disease).

Enertion do this essentially & some folks who have posted builds, so it's a real possibility

The problem is that my batteries are not 18650 but lipo packs... I would need like 35mm height inside... Plus what  length and width inside your enclosure? Don't know yet clearance from ground so hard to imagine as I don't have neither board or anything to compare.

Ah, this one was made with 25mm internal.
The risers on my build are 12mm, the wheels are 97mm and the clearance as it sits is 55mm.
I do have an enclosure I made for the LY 9two5 which is 40mm internal which I've used with lipos.
It may fit this deck. Internal sizes 545mm 145mm 40mm

You can insert paddings, I have a lot of spare motorbike protectors for elbows/knees/back made from this stuff. I recommend this type of padding if you ever have an accident it feels very soft &flexible but the propertychanges should a force impact it it hardens at teh point of the force...best amour there is.

https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ozkQbdfOIyCC6wU/giphy.gif

So yeah the only problem it took awhile to figure out which truck is 44 and which is 50 :D from side they look similar

Bushings came only in two pieces so thanks god I could buy other for the end. I also ordered some amazon 70mm longboard wheels to feel the deck... It's amazing.

The only shitty thing I discovered that Caliber paints are really easy to scratch so the color don't last long I guess...

P.S. I am going away from LiPo as 8 x 6S would cost a fortune and will go for PF 12S15P something like that, will be building individual balancer for each P group and somehow will need to make a case :)

It will be like 3 rows of 5 groups consisting of 6 cells in two floors :)

Will be getting 3kW power supply with adjustable CC/CV and charging it with it :) But biggest cons of letting go lipo is charging rate :cry: I could charge lipos like 5C without problem 18650 max 1C

But I guess with that kind of range it shouldn't be a problem.

Also I will try to fit 2 x 8072S at 165kv first maybe if I grow titanium balls and then I will switch to 250kv :D

I am going to use CC/CV 3kW power supply to charge it, wll use our Sparky switch modified to work on both charging switching and load switching. Also separate P group balancing (Balancer per 12S1P) interconnects to main BMS mcu via I2C :)  Wanted to use some advance level Balancer IC with isolation and etc but their are not available for consumers and requires NDA

P.S. I am going to charger somewhere in 1C range

I am thinking of using this module:

https://www.4dsystems.com.au/downloads/microOLED/uOLED-128-G2/Docs/uOLED-128-G2-Datasheet-REV1.pdf

Regarding simple vesc hookup I think you would need arduino to split between vesc and bluetooth module or you can use uart on slave but this is custom controller so you would need to make another processor to connect to vesc and show what you want ;)

I’d almost recommend going for an [e-ink display](https://www.waveshare.com/1.54inch-e-Paper-Module.htm). The refresh rate is certainly an issue, but in direct daylight you won’t see much on an oled display. Even reading simple stuff like a battery progress bar takes a lot more of my focus than it really should while hooning around.

So I calculated enclosure requirements, and I think I should fit into 600 x 210 x (50-60) mm space it means either fancy bottom mounting with a lip or mounting enclosure to the side of the deck... Evo is 20mm thick so put in m5 bolts wouldn't be much of a problem I guess. Maybe someone already tried to drill into side of deck and mount something? Or maybe something like rail mounting like there is thick L profile to witch on inside enclosure is attached and then from the top of deck bolts screw into it as I will have some spacing between cells and deck... Still haven't thought about it much. Biggest concern of this kind of mounting is water resistance...

Red hued carbon fibre made by the master of esk8 enclosures, that was an ironman tribute on a flexible deck but I'm sure something for the evo could be done with a lot more cell space.

Done some work on picking up parts for electronics, will be using of the shelf DC/DC converters as they have >90% efficiency and calibrated and etc, which I wouldn't be able to reach without decent tools and etc (Trying to not waste energy on heat and etc) 

I created a heatsink plate for 3.3V/5V/12V DC/DC converters and also Charge/Discharge/PreCharge mosfets (Same as in FatBoy Sparky AS Switch)

![image|690x440](upload://u62IVpZghH3KlhUcT5AmXykooPH.jpg)

Those 3 modules can deliver total 1.5kW of power I amazed how efficient and small they are

### Next hardware work:

* A bit over complicated USB hub with each port 3.3V/5V power switching so I could disable OLED/RGB strips/GPS and other devices from consuming power in sleep mode in which only main board + modem will run.

* Speed control module which will take in PPM / nRF24 / BLE and will control ESC with protections if something happens like lost signal or etc it will slow down this will mission critical so not many other peripherals will be running inside it. I also think they will be independent 

* Programmable USB RGBW strip controller / Light Controller

* USB to OLED screen module

* Main BMS controller with MOSFET switching logic, I2C (to connect balance boards), USB to connect 

### Software Side:

Will be running something like ElasticSearch/MySQL/InfluxDB combo for storing data.

Each ride will be automatically logged every parameter, GPS, Battery, ESC's, 10-DOF.

BMS will store each 12S1P packs voltages, current consumptions, temperatures and etc, then 1 current sensor for peripherals, 1 for ESC's, 1 for charging.

My modular balancing will provide insight into each battery pack modules voltages and current equalization and also let me calculate battery current capacity based on coulomb instead of voltage. Also tracking each cell health and they behavior while charging.

All these variables will be visible in web dashboard with graphs and etc.

Here are some examples of what I imagine to be able to visualize based on all these parameters:

![image|666x500](upload://9JdpxCX6cKah2nzJdrTOjKze0up.jpg)

![image|640x480](upload://kunE6z2M6BpRVvv3AAAQJMDNdma.jpg)

![image|690x444](upload://9UTqVoAjIsB5nCPPUGYQOiDwIb9.jpg)

As my ESC projects are still undergoing and at first I will be using FocBoxes I decided start working on HTML5 based VESC-Tool which communicates to VESC via WebSockets in my case each VESC will be connected to USB to the main computer and will have its data stream available via WebSocket for web tool to let me configure each VESC and etc. (Will be working on Mobile phones too) For this stuff I am also working on ESP32 based BLE/WiFi module. (Maybe one module for two VESC)

This is just dev board end result will be similar to existing HM-10 board ;)

![image|374x500](upload://oG1XBwvoGMmv6WBLeTB0fQsMAwL.jpg)

Also thanks to @b264 for real nickel strip rolls for my battery pack :stuck_out_tongue:

So a small update with big changes in the spec of the build. As I am finishing work with my High Voltage ESC I figured out that I would like to use it on this project so to show off/test out high voltage capabilities I am switching to 18S10P configuration so I needed to redesign the PCB for 18S1P group balancing with extra sensors and etc.

![image|690x315](upload://ptPDV3flm2XJbooAmoCLKRumSKL.jpg)

The board is based on new 4th generation LTC6813 chip (Multicell Battery Monitor Ic), onboard there will be 6 NTC based temperature sensors, bi-directional current sensor, eeprom. The boards will interconnect via I2C to main BMS board. I will need 10 of these boards that's why I choose I2C to be easily able connect all of them in chain.

Also as I am going to 18S I guess I will use APS 8072S 165kv motors with new 1:3(4/5) all aluminium gear drive anodized in red...

Yes, 18S is maximum described voltage but if you crazy and don't care about the parts you could do maybe 19S but some IC will be next to their limits. Yes, they will be available to buy but first I will try them on my board and with few people if everything is alright then it will be available to buy, but I will need to finish my firmware which is at the moment pretty scarce on features... 

Higher than 18S is hard to make as for e.g. Bidrectional current sense IC max common voltage is like 80V I could make bidirection from two unidirection IC which can go even higher but then I will need to double everything and space/cost not efficient. Plus who the hell needs more than 18S on longboard :D

This is already crazy stuff...

8570RPM /  75.6v = 113kv - 18s

Since APS does custom kv, you could request a kv as close to this as possible.

Using those formulas @chaka came up with is how we determine that 170kv is the ideal for 12s, 200kv for 10s, etc...

One thing I am curious about is whether you're supposed to calculate this figuring your battery fully charged or discharged (Li-on 4.2 fully charged and 3.6 discharged). If you figure these using the discharged amount, 12s would be 198kv, which incidentally enough, is the highest kv you can run 12s before its erpm goes above 60,000 erpm... 

Also, with 18s and 165kv your erpm would be 87,318.   Obviously the VESC 4.12 Couldn't go over 60k, and I heard the VESC 6 could go up to 100k, just curious if that worries you at all or have you got it all figured out??

Very excited to see this ESC come along!  I've really been looking a lot into electric powered surf boards and similar things like that and I think those are the perfect application for an ESC that can run such high voltage since you have to run a decent sized prop very fast with a ton of resistance, so I think in that application, an ESC like this is a great idea!

Hope you have Better luck with that motor, than me and a Friend. We are both running the motor on vesc 6 and escape
The noise is comming from the motor itself. Not loose magnets or anything else. Just a badly designed motor i'm afraid.

Don't worry bro its really actual topic for me if this is happening. I think from your last videos looks like windings are loose and from vibration they make that sound. Did you tried to contact APS?

No not yet.... but we sure will. But i have cut the motor wires and soldered on bullets connecters, and JST PH for the sensors, so i dont think he will take them back. Thats why i want to find the problem :slight_smile:

I am limited to length of motors because of TB218 hanger size 84mm is already a problem so thought that 8072 would be perfect fit. Maybe making custom hanger for like TB250 :D but that would be way to wide :D

Based on what @Eboosted said in another thread, I started thinking about this noise... it sounds like a shitty guitar, or similar stringed instrument. What he said to describe the noise really got in my head, and when I took my problem motor apart for the millionth time, what I saw was confirmation of Eb's statement (which I don't recall precisely). What I saw was a motor with light dust on virtually all the windings except for certain spots, which were perfectly clean. I grabbed a toothpick, and sure as shit the clean windings were loose!! Makes sense that the ones that shake, also dust themselves off, lol. I wish I had photos of this, but oh well. 

Anyway, an oral-syringe and some epoxy, plenty of paper towels, a couple q-tips and toothpicks may be all you need to fix or muffle the twang. 

On a side note it appears that low quality motors, which might have loose windings, will likely have other deficiencies as well. Loose magnets, bad bearings, etc. 

Point is, although I am a firm believer in that EVERYTHING-mechanical can be fixed, sometimes it's just too frustrating/time consuming.

Edit: I meant to reply to @Silverline but whatever.

@Kug3lis @Silverline about the bearings, the metal shields are, in my experience, insufficient for such a dirty application as skateboard motors. What you want is a CONTACT rubber/neoprene shield. Most bearings do not have contact-shields, and although the majority of the high precision bearings have really tight shields, there is still a teeny gap. My thoughts are that if you're gonna spend the money for replacement bearings, you may as well get the right ones! If you can find 6800-2rsc, at abec 3+ for a reasonable price go with those!! Also, there's a EMQ designation: electric motor quality. These are sound tested for vibration tolerances. I could try to find a link if you're interested. 

Cheers

Also worked on new FatBoy Mini Sparky Switch which will implement new pre-charge circuit I was discussing with @fedestanco in his switch topic It will limit all inrush current to 50A@100V and 25A@50V. Will feature all the features of his bigger brother but will be a lot smaller with 40A, 80A, 120A versions available to buy.

Very nice. Why dont you use a shittier mosfet for the precharge instead of a directfet? If I followed your explaination correctly during precharge the high power resistor will keep currents low dissipating a bunch of power by itself.

Finally after working 4 days on VESC communication protocols, I finally reached some kind of milestone. I have finally made protocol parser, packet parser and also implemented multiplexer so that multiple connections could communicate with single VESC without collision and etc. For e.g. as I will be collecting live data, WebSocket for browser based VESC tool, tcp socket for desktop VESC tool.

Here is example one VESC connected through MUX to 2 x VESC Tools both running Real Time Data and left one using keyboard to control motor both tools communicate with VESC and receive information.
