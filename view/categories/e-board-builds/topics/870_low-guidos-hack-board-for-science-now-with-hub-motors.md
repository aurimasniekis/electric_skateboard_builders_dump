So I have been doing a lot of testing of different parts, mainly transmitters and ESC's. That sort of thing. I decided that I should make a "hack" board.
Just a board that isnt pretty and can easily swap component's on and off of without any fuss.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/0e3f900a5626f3025677548f473fb15549e62cc9.jpg" width="281" height="500">
So what i have done is plastered the bottom of the deck in velcro so that I can move things around however I feel. I know velcro isnt going to hold real good for any long period, but it will do for the purpose of testing.

As you can see its currently setup with a 6S zippy 8000 battery, HK150 xcar ESC, a wiiceiver with nyko kama and the motor is a SK3 280kv. But I have a VESC in the wings along with some other things.

Well. Part of the reason its on there is because I'm going to test it. Havent had a ride yet.

But, I have hundreds of km's on the older version of the HK 150A.

Not only do they have soft power buttons that I hate.
But they are louder than any other ESC i have tested under brakes, and here is the best part.. if anything strange happens during your skate the ESC goes into shutdown.  But not a nice soft shut down but a im gonna lock up the wheels and street your face kinda way. Not good.

I believe the expression was *street your face*.

Unless you're riding in your living room.
Come to think of it, I've seen @longhairedboy do that as well 😀

Street Your Face, or SYF for short, is in fact the technical steez-itific term as adopted by this community for unintentionally face planting due to unexpected rapid acceleration (faster or slower) of your personal electric rocket stick. 

I'm adding this to the forum glossary now.

I had bought a couple of those esc's for my robot before discovering the vesc.

During our initial testing, we quickly discovered that we saw absolutly no start up torq difference while being sensored and un-sensored. Made us highly dought the sensor was actually being used. We contacted Toro about this issue but never got a straight answer.

Long story short, we canned these chineseries and opted for the vesc.

@lowGuido you have inspirted me. I think i'm going to throw together a box for Scarlet that's not quite so thin and sexy but instead tall enough to try different things out.  Line the bottom with velcro and just stick whatever i want in there to test to it and leave enough room in there for one of those gargatuan 20Ah multirotor lipos. 

i wonder if it would be worth it to figure out some kind of data logger.

Well I have been testing a fair bit with these:

Quanam Tx/Rx
Red unknown Tx
Enertion ESC 4.10 batch 1
HK X-car beast 150A 

I did another decent run with the Quanam. and you know what.. Its alright. I don't like the lack of perpetual steez, but its rideable. I even squeezed the trigger down fully for some 37km/h action on the long straights.
the red one I ditched. I couldn't get the thing to bind with its receiver so I chucked it. (aint no body got time for that)

I also just recently received these 2 VESC from @chaka that Im planning to set up with a dual hub motor drive as soon as my hub motors arrive from @jacobbloy or @Hummie (I pre ordered both for science)  

<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/01795766d62c24ea047c50c83afa801fdf32fade.jpg'>

I once again bit the bullet and ordered a pair of nyko kama chucks for $110  I don't like having to pay so much but its the price I pay for steez. waiting for them to arrive so I can break one open and VESC the receiver.

meanwhile the stack slowly grows in the corner of my room.
still plenty to play with.

Fantastic!!

I guess for 110 the nunchucks are wiicwiver or something. The one I tried without hardwiring the tongle was awful.   Don't know what you read but whenever I read about someone getting one I have to say that.  

aint nobody got time for that is about the only news I have heard.


And now I've read the thread..id been sucked in by mention of my name.  I was alerted!  What a site. I like the Velcro. And I didnt like the sounds with the  hobbywing150 especially the brakes.   You will like the sounds to come.  the vesc is everything I could want.

I practice my anti-SYF in my head on the bus..finishing motor rewind and waiting for vescs

@Hummie  that $110 does not include wiiceiver! 
thats just the price of the chucks and shipping!

oh yeah I have tested the VESC brakes are nice and quiet.
for what its worth I'm almost certain that the noise in the car ESC brakes is a noise that is "programmed in" to make you RC cars brakes sound more car like with a squeal.
boat and plane ESC's don't have it.

I like that you ordered both sets of hubz and two identical vescs: for science!

This should help a lot of people out because right now is seems like the way to go is either @Hummie or @jacobbloy, but there is really no good comparisons of the two.. especially since they are both technically 'pre orders' at the moment. 

I personally back hummie

That's not crazy shipping to Australia or something at that cost?! Those things are like 13$ on Amazon I'm almost sure.  I've one I don't want. I'll give it to you for...50$.


Speaking of Velcro and batteries. I haven't found anything to convince me occasional ricocheting rocks are damaging the batteries and I like using the Velcro and then I only ever use the same batteries and charge them attached. Velcro is permanent for me ... Until I pot and stick (24) 18650s to the board with the 70 duro clear rubber I have waiting

I'm actually pretty happy with $110 for the pair! 

seriously we get screwed over postage here and most of our local shops don't sell anything useful.

Testers are all over your house 

Excited we're getting the motors!  

Almost done rewinding (LRK terminated wye).  This is it done really.   I get to test them first and see how this weird winding feels and sounds and maybe change what we're getting.  Windings they'll do last.  This should have a much lower kv and want to see how that feels.  And there will be a mismatch with the other 100kv

Have to see if I can figure the kv out on the bldc tool. If you know please tell 

This cool tool I just got.  Measures inductance. Electromagnetism. 
Ok I'm done jumping in your already exciting thread. But both you guys are getting these and thought you might like to see

I too was looking for the nyko kama nunchuck, but couldnt find any here in Aus (did you go amazon or something?) 

Anyway, I found [these][1] on eBay from Italy, which were just under $30 including shipping :D 

Its almost exactly the same size as the regular nunchuck, and so far it performs really well! Next time you need some try it!

It is working fine with my diy wiiciever. The recieving dongle actually looks identical to the kamas, so its probably based on it. I prefer it as its much slimmer, but I havent had it long enough to see how the battery life is.

Do it! I think alot of aussies will want one

Awesome @lowGuido ! I like that you removed the original wires on the Kama receiver and completely replaced them. That's what I would do if I could do it over again. I didn't have a small enough soldering tip back then!

I'll closely watch your experience with the native implementation of nuhchuck with VESC. Despite many efforts to correct it I still had occasional dropouts. I've stopped using the Nunchuck and went back to GT2B for now.

 $500 delivered! go and get Fire trucked. I can buy them individually for $50 each.

You can change the code in wiiceiver.  But i dont think the hobby ESC have a feedback loop for speed sensing. You could probably program it up for sensored motor. It is definitely possible but would require an extra bit of programming and fiddling around.

nice.  i dont understand it though...if youre on cruise control how does dragging your foot stop it...and how does going up a hill not stop it?

wish someone would integrate stress sensors on the trucks.  those can be super accurate (they use them to reveal the wattage produced by a cyclist through the cranks).  they're small.  one on each truck would be awesome.  just lean forward or backwards for throttle or brake.  done before but not with enough explanation for me to do it.

As you drag your foot the motor is disengaged so you are just coasting. Then when you go up hill the motor accelerates to keep you at the same speed.
Simmilarly when going down a hill the motor will brake to slow you down.

yup. hard wired. the wiiceivers should never even be sold with socket connectors. using a nunchuck without hard wiring is equivalent to this:

```
did you watch the video?
basically the way it works is that you kick yourself to the desired speed and then the board keeps going that speed.
want to slow down? then you coast to the slower speed and continue at that speed.
want to stop? take your foot off the board and drag.

the obvious downside is that you will never be able to get to the top speed of a regular remote board (unless you start on big hill)
upsides include: no transmitter, no droppouts, longer battery life, cheaper build cost.

I did it just to show it could be done. y'know, for science.

I forgot you posted a video, but I watched it now. That is sweet! Your explanation was still very informative cause I would still be wondering how you would slow down or stop. Seems like you'd need some kind of leash or proximity kill switch in case you fall off at speed.

As soon as your foot leaves the board it would stop driving anyway.  It is automatically a kill switch. If you had a lot of momentum it might still roll a bit, but that's what you would expect from any skateboard motor or not.

To speak about the nunchuck being unreliable :  maybe i just have an old version of it I had to remove my 2 triple A batteries and swap out with some huge 18650 batteries so that it doesnt die in 15 minutes of use. lol but other than that as long as it hasa strong battery in it its okay.  

Also I switched on my old board and it does have cruise control! BUT it only works if youre on the throttle, meaning it doesnt have rpm sensing.  I want to try it on a sensored motor and see if it works.

there is something wrong if your nunchuck runs out of batteries alot. My regular AA's last for weeks!
also the code for perpetual steez doesn't have any feedback loop as far as im aware, so even with sensored motors you would probably need to alter the code and electronics to make it cruise control.

**cruise control** senses the speed and alters the throttle up and down automatically to hold the same speed.
**Perpetual steez** just holds the throttle in one place.

@trbt555 Yes it is a regular wired nunchuck, not a wireless one.

@Michaelinvegas there is no reason you couldn't have a receiver wired on as well. you could use a DPDT switch on the data and clock to toggle between push assist and wireless. not a bad idea..

It really does cut down the production time a bit not having to fabricate the motor mounts, and line up belts etc.
I'm yet to see any real downside to the hubs yet. most of the little niggles are actually VESC quirks.

So yesterday I did some test runs. And all was good until I broke a phase wire on one of the motors..

So I also did a test run on a single hub motor.
Results were good. I mean Id probably be happy enough with just one motor. The top speed was identical only the acceleration wasn't as hard. No huge loss.. I havent tried any major hills yet.. I have been so busy with other stuff.

So then this morning I did this:

just an update on the ol hack. its now sporting dual @jacobbloy hub motors off twin @chaka VESC's  in push assist mode.
its a load of fun!
for those who were paying attention I accidently cross threadded a grub screw and had to tap out the thread to an M3.5 thread that I couldn't get grubcrews for so I had to improvise my own. 
Also you can see my offset is the same on the front and rear now with the truck mods i made.

Yeah i found some m3.5 machine screws at a fasteners store and cut them down and ground the head down.
Its not pretty but it works.

If I hadnt been in such a hurry to try them out i wouldnt have had a problem with the original screws. Its just that i loctited them on and then had to take them off to shorten the hanger and then put them back on again. The whole on again off again thing was what stripped it. And as a result i also ended up breaking  a wire. 

Lesson learned tho. Dont rush. And make sure everything is right before you loctite.

Throw glue in hole.  2 part high heat epoxy.  Best if u heat it before mixing the two so they become thin. Screw in the axle.  Last time I did it it worked this way because the glue was thin.  At worst you'll have to goop it on the axle and do the best u can.  Careful not to get it on the bearing

I'm looking at various hubs from quite some time, and for ultra-top speed  4WD set up, they seem like the best option (and they were used to beat electric longboard speed record, for the very same reason). Recently I met a guy in Cracow, testing such 4WD hub set-up. I had quick chat with him, he makes custom decks, and with his homies wants to break guiness world record record, to get in the spot light. The hubs the board used didn't seem like anything else I've seen on the market though (and he told me they were custom made by alien from UK).

I'm super curious what will be the result of this challenge :)

Im still running 6S on my test rig. I will eventually finish my 12S setup and i'll try them out on that too. But I feel that the results of that are predictable. Both motors will obviously be faster. Each should improve equally. It won't really change my results.

the carveon hubs are like 149kv arn't they? based off the SK3 6374.
now I have never ridden them, but I have ridden my fair share of SK3's.

based off my knowledge I think I can make a fairly educated guess on how the carveon would compare.

Im gonna say the carveon will be a lot faster on top speed, but will lack the hill climbing and take off grunt that Jacobs or hummis have.

I finally had my popcorn and cola. Great videos, it seems that I already could create a conclusion for my own. Jacob motor is similar to what I have at this moment with 24 stators inside. Not sure which one do alot better (I think Jacob could overperform) but in general I dont have torque issue in low or high speed. The hub motor that I have also dont have those wiggly magnet rotation.

@laurnts it could be that there is more poles inside that makes it smoother.. as i said I don't actually know why it does it or of its good or bad, just an observation I made.

I noticed the Tacon 160 245kv was "notchier" than my 245kv SK3 when turned by hand, but the Tacon 160 seems to have gained a reputation as the torque monster, so go figure. 

Also, very nice, and long awaited review. Kind of scared me with the 24.1 kmh top speed screenshot until I realized you were only on 6s. Theoretically, top speed should be close to double that on 12s I assume. I hope.

@appelton for 6S max yes. I'm not sure if i made it clear in the video, but I put both boards full throttle and rode them at full throttle for the remainder of the video.
of course 6S is probably the smallest voltage you would even consider using on an e-board so I guess you could say that it would be the "lowest top speed"

cool comparison, would be interested in long term experience and efficiency too - I know hummie did a lot of experimenting with stator/magnets and airgap which might be the reason you can feel every single magnet in there. also I couldnt really tell a big difference in acceleration from the video even though the hummies are smaller = less torque by default.

also Im really curious about how the urethane feels, especially when you carve hard? jacobs thin urethane vs. hummies thicker should make a comfort difference - on the other hand jacobs wheels are much larger, so that might just counteract the urethane meat amount?

love the purple anodizing job on hummies though, they look super hot :heart_eyes:

could be a vesc thing. vescs under high current tend to get hot enough that they go into their soft power down mode. i got the same behavior on longer inclines on my tesseract before I switched to a different gearing.

Can't really change your gearing with a hub though. All you can do for top speed aside from adding voltage is increase the wheel size. Higher top speed at the expense of torque.

I dont think it can climb that long at 35 degree. I believe I said it could climb about 30 to 32 degree with 60kgs weight. It can do 110kg at 30 degree but will heat up after 50meter. All climb at quiet steep degree require kick push just not to get backward.

It could climb but heating up also at same time. If you really wanna climb hill like that you should go with satelite. Hub can do really well, i am very impressed. But its still for mostly flat ground, high speed and short climbs with momentum.

So, if I'm not mistaken, Jacob's hubs are 70kv, while Hummie's hubs are 90kv. Any thoughts on why Jacob's were faster than Hummie's? Seems to me that all other things created equal, Hummie's should be faster, or similar at worst.

Hummies are a 57mm stator, jacobs a 63mm, don't know for sure but would imagine they are close to the same width. This coupled with a lower kv would make jacobs have more torque and likely faster.

Love the design of hummies hubmotors, aside from not having a set screw, but for simplicities sake, jacobs hubmotors are definitely a win in my books. (and because he was willing to make a bigger urethane mold for me :smiley:) 

All in all think once they both have their designs polished off and out of the beta testing stage we are going to see some great reviews coming from hubmotor riders on both ends.

Well that's because you're an elitist prick. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: 
I like my rubbers a little big for the smoother ride and added clearance. Plus, on 6s, it allows me to cheat a little to get a bit higher top speed without changing my gearing. And if they were 90mm, it would be easier to compare the performance differences with Carvons.

Yeah FOC is not something I have even tried to be honest.  I have a lot of tests to do. And not a lot of time. Im actually in the middle of moving house at the moment.
Carvons are always going to be faster.  The kv makes sure of that. But I can only assume that the hill climbing abilities of the lower kv hubs would be better.  Hey if someone wants to swing me a pair of carvons i'll head to head all 3.

The ones I sell are 80mm same shape as kegel.  They are smaller motors than Jacob sells 

90kv 

I'm riding them in FOC and 12s in the video I recently posted.  They're very quiet and I have no trouble hitting 27mph. 12s and FOC..that's the way to ride
them. 

A speed comparison on 12s will be different and I think gives enough power for them to get to their max speed with the 90kv. I think with the smaller motors I'm selling 6s isn't enough power. 

So far I don't feel this review/comparison tells much.  6s bldc program riding on the sidewalk for a day...  We need a review after a thousand miles of 12s seep hills and abuse.  I can tell you how it's going to go already...and that's why I'm getting them made in all steel with pressed bearings. The peak power is there for even the smaller ones I'm selling but both motors aren't built strong enough using an aluminum shaft

I've had similar experiences with 80,90,and 100kv where the higher kv is slower on a hill. The lower the kv the more inductance per amp so if I have my vesc set to a 60amp limit the 100kv won't get enough amps to make the inductance to make it up as fast. If I increase the amp limit on the vesc now the 90 or 100kv will take more amps and will go up as fast (bit less efficiently since the no-load speed is a bit further from what speed be doing).
