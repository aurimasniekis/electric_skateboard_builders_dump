Hi Guys!

Relatively new guy here, been reading and researching for a good few months now and finally started buying parts...

I've been mountiainboarding for around 13 years, competing in UK comps for the last 10 years (mainly BoarderX racing but I also dabble in a bit of freestlye now and again) so I already have a decent mountainboard; Trampa HolyPro.
I also founded a competitive mountainboarding team known as the NEAT Boarders (North East All Terrain Boarders) which is now one of the bigger UK teams. (Founded in North East England, but now an international team).
I was thinking of getting an extra complete mountainboard for going electric, but then started thinking how and when I'd use it; my main uses will be to get to and from drone flying spots, and to and from mountainboarding spots. I can easily carry drone gear whilst riding, but maybe not so much with carrying a 2nd mountainboard!
So, I want to make a detachable electric system that I can remove when I want to ride the hills/tracks/jumps of local mountainboarding spots. (Similar concept to @janpom's plans, build thread here; https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/velcro-board-mbs-core-94-idea-ats-mounts-single-sk3-149kv-12s-lipo-escape/49909?u=andybigd)

So for the purposes of this thread I've named my setup the NEAT Board, which in this circumstance will stand for **N**onpermanent **E**lectric **A**ll **T**errain Boad. I also hope to make it as neat as possible ;)

Parts:
- Trampa HolyPro
  - 17 ply deck
  - Vertigo Baseplates
  - Infinity Hangers
  - Superstar Hubs + Primo Alpha Tyres
  - MBS F5 Bindings + Heelstraps
- AlienPowerSystem 6384 Sensored 170kV motors (x2)
- E-Toxx Dual Direct Drive
- 12S 11.6 Ah 25C (4x Zippy Compact 6S 5800mAh 25C - 2P then 2S)
- ESCapes (x2)
- Explorer 2209 Case

Batteries & ESCs & Rx etc will all be in the one central case, which will be easily removable from the deck.
Direct Drive + Motors will be bought with a new Hanger, so I can swap out the whole hanger to an un-powered one.

I've already got the motors, batteries, Tx/Rx, cables & connectors on order, and signed up to the ESCape group buy. I just need to speak to @nowind and sort out an order for the Direct Drive.
I was contemplating the FatBoy Inner Gear Direct Drive (beautifully simple design @ a great price), but a completely sealed drivetrain with the ability to change wheels without deflating tyres is just too perfect of a design not to get.

So...
I'm immensely looking forward to starting this build and will most likely have many questions when it comes to ESC software setup.

Here's the concept;

I always recommend a vesc derivative.

Like the "Motors" in your test hook up concept board :grin:
Yeah thats true if you go with the regular Direct Drive,
 you can change Wheels with extra Hubadapters easy front front to back.
Or dismount them for whatever... or carry a spare tire with you without the need of a pump.

By next week i should have all back in stock... just PM or email me.

Nice Easter Weekend

Yeah I forgot to list that, I already have a decent one. I'll be charging as 4x 6S batteries in parallel using my trusty iSDT SC-620. It can put out 500W and is tiny, simple, easy to use and was very reasonably priced. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
Here it is in my drone field charging setup;

Well after 3 recommendations for the GT2B over the quanum I think I'm gonna have to get one!
The quanum just seemed nice and compact in comparison, was hoping it might be modifiable too but it doesn't look like it. Anyone know if the GT2B is modifiable to maybe shrink it down in size?

I can't believe I've done this much research and got this far without properly looking into the remote options! The GT2B mods look awesome! Just done a lot of reading up on the options and I will definitely go down this route. Sparkle or Mad Munkey though? I can't decide. I may just print both and see what i prefer the feel of. I also have some other ideas for the remote to go with future board upgrades so I may work on my own case at some point...

So a couple of extra boring bits and bobs turned up:
(XT90s, Anti Sparks, Battery Meter, Lipo Safe Bag)

![20180424_192449|690x387](upload://iMtjtUtBtq5fVI7zeeSlZA1NcuY.jpg)

![20180424_192534|690x387](upload://8UZEVTtS8p8yfWgjQgOEXX3SuC3.jpg)


And the bag fits in the box. (Almost like it was made for it!):

![20180424_192702|690x387](upload://3u6j0ta1hsJ43AGeOZLpQ6uNV3I.jpg)

Still space for the ESCapes at the back but I'm going to have to be neat to get it all in.

Battery prep...

Covered it with sticky back neoprene;
![20180426_213434|690x387](upload://jWUsF9q7XaTs8JsNsOBGAaxLTBL.jpg)

Shrunk the lipo bag to size using some trusty black duct tape;

Here's the modded bag compared to standard;
![20180426_104439|690x387](upload://faCPO1ln5d5t4ReZm5tm50cUG0v.jpg)![20180426_104424|690x387](upload://cLVroizKwp8AybNdaHZxlEWhyb3.jpg)

And here's the space it gives me in the box;
![20180425_115001|690x387](upload://pb7oSMWal0wxxMTbHgUcl1n98uG.jpg)![20180426_111130|690x387](upload://2NBU6zDRunHGahUPylIKSo8Liyc.jpg)
(The box has 95mm internal height, that measurement was to the highest point of the batteries before the neoprene was added. So with the foam it gets clamped perfectly by the lid).

![20180619_075719|690x387](upload://39Hl57wbsKsXuJElINyeF4F7Ya3.jpg)

Spent most of last night just looking at parts trying to decide where to fit things and how to connect it all up. I'm extremely indecisive when it comes to things like this as I want it to be perfect from the start.
Few more bits and bobs have been ordered (connectors, wires, wire mesh etc.) but I'll get there...

Be careful with those anti-fire backs, pouches and etc, after some time fiberglass (insides are made from fiberglass) gets broken into microscopic pieces and if you work with cables or connectors inside you get your hands full of them so annoying.

Thanks for the heads up!
Though essentially it will become part of the battery with 2x 6S power and balance leads coming out the bag. Will only need to take the bag out the box to charge (until I build a charge port into the box) and will rarely need to get in and out the bag once built.

Depending on the terrain, you may find that vescs in an enclosure will start thermal throttling. With mountain boards they truly begin to shine with heatsinks exposed to air.

I personally had no idea mine were overheating until I installed them externally with a good dual enclosure out of alu...so in case you start slowing down for no apparent reason, that will be it.

Yeah this is my biggest concern actually.
I have thought about this and read mixed reports on enclosed Vs. exposed VESCs, but I do have a solution in mind to heatsink them to the outside of the case should I need to.
I do want to push this setup to its limits to see what it's capable of so only testing will tell. And I'll have the Metr app to log data so I'll be able to see if I have any issues...

Soldered T-Joints will be covered in liquid electrical tape, then secured to the platicard separator and ESC housings with hot glue.

The T-Joints look interesting and dangerous at the same time, hope there is enough space/isolation between aluminium housing and solder joints. The plasticcard separator is a good idea, does it fit after soldering?

I'm planning to strap the power of 10 horses to my feet with a box of explosive batteries between my legs and it's soldered T-Joints that look dangerous :crazy_face::laughing::rofl:
But I'm confident in the isolation. Liquid electrical tape covers the joints nicely, and they'll be well protected from vibrations once hot glued.

Speaking of dangers, I've got the fuse sorted out now.
I'm using 200A 58V Midi Fuses, soldered some 5.5mm Bullets to resemble the blade fuse style, and coated the exposed ends in liquid electrical tape.

So the only other thing I've found time to do this week is sort out my home charging station.
Found another spare flight case at work (same as my drone field charging chase).
Got a 24V 25A (600W) power supply plummed into my ISDT SC-620 with parallel XT90 & 6S balance leads, so I should be able to use it at full whack to charge a 23.2Ah 6S battery @ 20A (just shy of 1C)

Few more bits n bobs done...

Rx, Aux Switch & 12v BEC all wired up;
(Hard wired the Rx as I had no room for connectors!)
![20180801_234434|690x387](upload://zcFDwGh0ciCZ1wmvSggC3n7ZpvR.jpg)

Canbus cable made and installed along with the Metr Pro Module;
![20180801_234455|690x387](upload://qQIklv6NxxoNBFpGR9vRTMjqFyy.jpg)

Pretty much everything all wired up ready to install into the box;
![20180801_235107|690x387](upload://vj2PdDEjQFVgLmJyyVdrwSdWYYR.jpg)


Remaining wiring jobs to do list;
* Connect my surprise auxiliary accessory to the Aux Switch
* Wire up the 2 switches from the BEC
  - Switch 1 to full length 2 core cable for rear lights
  - Switch 2 to the underbox lighting
* Direct Solder full length Phase Wires to the ESCs
* Wire the sensor plugs onto full length 6 core cable
* Solder connectors onto tail end of all motor wires (to fit APS motor)
  (I'll mount the box and trucks to deck first to get the cable routing and lengths figured out)
* Mount rear lights and wire up with connectors
* Make a Spare Fuse & Spare Loop Key
```

So for mounting my box, I've gone down the solid, indestructible and super secure route...

Bring out the steel and the welder!
(I may remake these in Ali in the future to shed some grams)
But I'll add some weight saving holes to these for now before painting and fitting them.

Shown on a deck drilling template;

Hole centres are pretty accurate;
![20180802_213058|690x387](upload://mOphk3uzD6W79wJkhu11ct9AhzB.jpg)

M6 Countersunk bolts (same size as the binding bolts) go through the deck and hold the box down via these 'Grommet Mounts'. (Bolts will be cut down to length).
![20180803_080056|690x387](upload://kae39LVHBZa3UwQfKlr3mrLo3LD.jpg)

Vibration dampened, will allow for flex, easy to mount and detach box and it is ridiculously solid and secure! May be overkill, but I'm an Industrial Engineer so that's what I usually do!
Nice bonus is that I can carry the whole board with the box's carry handle if I want :smile:
Might get a shoulder strap for the box too.

Thanks! There does seem to be a bit of a never ending list, but I can see the light...

Box is quick and easy enough to detach. Just 4 Allen screws, with no nuts on the other side to hold, they just wind straight in and out. And you just put them back in the Grommet Mounts after removal to keep them safe.
Strength and security came first, detach-ability second.

Holy crapsticks is it fun to ride with power on tap!

Didn't quite meet my Saturday target, but 11pm Sunday night I got to have my first test run round the block. Set it up at half of max power for now (40A) and it still has scary amounts of power. Runs beautifully. Big thanks to @Nowind and @stewii for providing such awesome products to power this beast. Can't wait to truly start testing it out...

Inside the box has turned out super NEAT!;

![20180806_082451|690x387](upload://dbPy865HLTl1gZh3tkHUs9bkKBs.jpg)

The spaced off perspex cover works a treat to give a perfect fit for the battery, keep the wires & connectors protected, and keeps visibility of all the status LEDs on components (even when the battery is in).

To get it running ASAP, I left out some of the non-essential features for now.
I fitted a plug in between Rx and BEC as I've not fitted the BEC for now, but it's plug and play ready.

So from my previous wiring jobs list, the remaining items to get to the planned final product are as follows;

* Connect my surprise auxiliary accessory to the Aux Switch
* Wire up the 2 switches from the BEC
  - Switch 1 to full length 2 core cable for rear lights (cable is in ready)
  - Switch 2 to the underbox lighting (wiring is all ready)
* Mount rear lights and wire up with connectors

Other items I didn't previously list but plan to do;

* Make plates to cover the large HolyPro holes above the baseplates.
  - These will be used for a front light mount, and rear cable tie-down.
* Fit Wire Mesh Cable Cover over the 2 main cable assemblies from Box - Motors.
* Epoxy in the loop key plug (It's just blutacked in at the minute).
* Make a spare wheel mount for the top of the box.
* Make some 'storage brackets' on the top of the box to mount the hanger/drive assembly to for storage purposes when not mounted on the board.

Then that's it!

Lights are my priority so I can get around in the evenings safely. Hoping I can do this tonight...

Done 2 stupid things though...

1. I hadn't yet actually got my Metr module paired to my phone. So I went to test it all today and I needed the pin to pair didn't I?! Which of course is on the back of the module which I've buried deep into my box, securely stuck to the ESC with sticky-back-foam, and hiding behind my perspex cover. :angry:
That was an annoying stupid faff to sort out!

2. Quanum remote is working fine, but then I dropped it on the floor causing batteries to eject.
Battery tray would no longer stay clipped in properly which I found was due to a broken plastic lever.
Damn!
So I thought why not, I'll give it a bash, and I remade this tiny fiddly little thing in Aluminium:

You did tell me it had problems yes, but I thought you said binding issues? It bound fine for me and is working fine so far so I'm not as worried as you want me to be. What can go so wrong with this remote to cause safety issues? Any more details on specific problems you've had and how it's risked your safety?

But anyway I've already bought the gt2 ready to do the mod. Just been focused on getting the board itself working 1st and the quanum is just a stop gap til I print a case for the gt2. I don't intend to use it for long, but I am going to use it for now.

Actually I haven't tested a failsafe scenario yet so I'm gonna go see what happens...
(This is always a part of any normal RC setup).
I'm assuming (and hoping) that upon lost connection the Rx goes into failsafe with a neutral throttle. If so then I see this as a very safe failure and if that's the worst that happens then I'm happy to keep using the quanum (even though I won't be for long).

Failsafe does work as thought so that's good. Glad you raised this again actualy otherwise I would probably have forgot to check the failsafe scenario at all!

Soooo.....

I gave it its first proper thrashing last night :grinning:
Holy bejesus its bloody awesome!!! :star_struck:
Went up and down the coast (plenty of nice wide paths and open grassy areas to explore round Whitley Bay - perfect eATB territory) for about 45 mins - 1 hour, pushed speeds of 25mph ish but didn't dare go any faster in just shorts and T-shirt (and obviously a helmet).
Power's good, brakes are good. Its all good!
Plus riding my mountainboard almost non-stop for nearly an hour... What a novelty!
Got more mileage on my wheels in just that one ride than all the riding I've done all year to date!

Though the one big bummer that had me actually quite annoyed; my Metr app failed to save the recording!!! :face_with_symbols_over_mouth:
It was working fine for the 1st 15/20mins as I had a quick chill on a bench and checked the app. Carried on riding then checked it again when nearly back home... Nothing!
I feel really gutted that I missed out on the record of my 1st ever proper ride. I can't get that back now. :sleepy:
Route would've looked awesome, I was doing plenty of testing on the way (heavy stop start test, hill climbs, pushing for speed) as I also really wanted to evaluate the date.

To test it again, it did actually record the last leg of my journey home (from noticing the failed recording).
So I do have a tiny bit of data;
https://metr.at/r/9ZF7C

@rpasichnyk?... any idea why it might have failed to save my record? Any common causes for this?
I was stopped for 10mins or so at one point, but I don't have the auto timer on.
Is it worth putting the auto record function on so it creates multiple records between any stops/rests?
I was really hoping to record and keep a log of every ride on this board and I also want the total All Time stats to be correct...

This^^^

Got me thinking...
There's been a lot of talk going around about how long parts are lasting, mainly tyres and kingpin bushings.
It now makes a hell of a lot of sense.
Mountainboards were never designed to see this much mileage!
As unpowered mountainboards, they only get used in short bursts really, and definiately won't be racking up anywhere close to the distances that powered mountainboards are starting to see.
So it's completely no surprise that @rich can get through bushings as quick as he does.
Also, the weight of the duel drive on that rear hanger... landing jumps is putting a lot more strain on these bushings than on an unpowered setup. I got some air last night and I could practically feel those bushings being crushed on landing.
The future of eATB needs some proper truck R&D...
But for now, bushings checks will be part of all pre-ride checks.

That's a valid point. All my problems (and real fun) started with jumping :thinking:

On a perfect truck kingpin bushings last much longer, my hanger is not in best condition and recently I found out that the kingpin bolt is a bit bent, too. Furthermore one hole on the hanger is bigger and the bushing has play. All together leads to ridiculous fast killing of bushings.

IMO the fastest check is to push down the deck at tip (or tail) with both hands. If there is no play or rattle they are fine.

BEC and 2 switches on the box are all wired up.
Damn it was a squeeze to get it all in there, but it's in, and it all works.
And the box lid still opens and closes nicely without trapping any wires.

Had a cracking night out on the board last night; 1st use as an actual form of transport to visit a friend the other side of Newcastle.
Used the Metro for parts of the journey and rode the rest.
Will post more details later and tell a little story (had some great positive encounters along the way) but for now here's an overview of the stats;

So...

Leg 1 of the journey, Metro from mine to the north side of town and ride down to my mates house. Nice mix of cycle paths and road riding, cutting through a couple of hospital roads and riding through the middle of the town moor.
https://metr.at/r/ko8aI
From the last traffic lights down the hill to my mates house (07:19:25 PM onward), a man in a big hippy van with musical horns followed my down and caught up with me outside my mates door - he thought it was awesome so had to come have a chat.
Said he couldn't keep up! :rofl::stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
Said his son loved all things skateboarding so wanted to know what it was, bought/built, how much etc.
Nice guy, nice chat.
He showed me his horn so I showed him mine!
Positive encounter No. 1!


Leg 2. Same route back to the same metro station. May have accidentally gone the wrong way round a one way system around the 1st hospital but oh well.
My sticky GoPro mount for front headlight fell off at one point so was just holding it in my front hand for the rest of the way. Nothing particularly exciting happed, just a nice cruise back.
https://metr.at/r/vK9Pq

Leg 3. Knowing I had plenty more battery life left, I got off the Metro early to ride the coast back home. This was my favourite, most fun leg of the journey as I had clear roads and nice wide smooth promenades to ride. Bit of a glitch at the start of the recording as GPS location must've been playing catch-up.
https://metr.at/r/Ve0Di
And had 3 positive encounters here!...
1. The 1st big straight road (10:05:50 PM to 10:08:40 PM) is a 40mph limit where I was riding the road at around 30mph. Saw that a car had come up behind me so let off to allow them to pass if they wanted. They didn't want. But they kept a very respectable safe distance and continued to follow me. You can see at 10:07:21 where I cut up onto a cycle path (after indicating to the car I was going to do so), but they didn't zoom past, it was a middle aged woman who slowly passed with a very intrigued look and a smile on her face. She then flashed me her hazards to say thanks as she sped up to 40 and on her way. Your most welcome love!

2. Coming down the promenade up to Spanish City, weaving up through the pedestrianized area, they're was a couple of young teenagers hanging out, and one had left a skateboard abandoned upside down in the middle of the path... So I just had to didn't I!... Speed up and ollie it before casually cruising off on my way to cheers of "Wow!" and "That's awesome!" :sunglasses:

3. Further up the promenade at the top of the hill (around 10:12:30 PM) there was a small group of longboarders sitting on there boards (all sorts of board including one of those massive surfboard style longboards). Slowed down a bit to say hi as I passed, and got responses of "Yeah Powered!" and "Whoop Whoop"s so I floored it away to show off the raw power of the board.

So yeah, absolutely great nights riding. And as well as these 4 stand-out encounters I had plenty of thumbs up and amazed looks from all sorts of people. The North East is generally a very friendly place :hugs:

After going out on the board nearly every night last week (Sunday - Thursday), I didn't get a chance to go out on the weekend, so finally got out again Tuesday night for a cruise along the coast...
Only night I got to ride this week.
And what a f*#@ing nightmare of a crappy night I had !!!
One of those times you usually get early into any new hobby that really tests your commitment to the cause...
Where everything that can go wrong does go wrong, and where one thing going wrong leads to more things going wrong.
Where the weak and uncommitted give up and change their minds and sell out of the hobby.
Not me though.
After finally getting over what a bad mood it put me in, I put this down to teething issues, will learn from them, and rebuild and improve to reduce the risk of the same issues happening again.

First sign of issues was immediately when setting off... it just wouldn't go. Rolled down the drive but basically stopped itself when applying power.
Quick investigation showed one wheel had mysteriously switched direction.
Switched it in the Metr app, thought little of it and got on my way.
Then a gently cruise turned into me thrashing around a mown field learning to drift and jumping off rolling features and mounds.
That's when things went bad... On landing a jump, I stripped a main gear in the drive!!!
Had no choice but to walk the 2 mile home carrying the heavy end of the board as that one wheel had completely locked up.
Didn't have a bag on me so strapped my helmet to a binding to make carrying easier and keep it from rattling around on things and scratching the paint.
Then I went and dropped the board out of my hand whilst stepping off a curb causing it to flip and land upside down directly on the top of my brand new RuRoc scratching it all to f*** :face_with_symbols_over_mouth::face_with_symbols_over_mouth::face_with_symbols_over_mouth:
And i think this may have snapped my headlight off because I can't find it anywhere. Pretty sure I lost it.
So yeah, knackered after a long walk home with pumped out forearms and pretty pissed off.
Could've cried when I scratched my helmet, I've been so careful with it and usually have the helmet bag with me to keep it nice.

But @Nowind being the excellent guy he is, he sent me out a new gear straight away no questions asked.

And I've now pinpointed my issues to a sensor cable having become disconnected.
Probably explains why it spontaneously decided to switch directions and who knows what it could've been doing when jumping around and pushing the power which probably led to the gear failure.

Lessons learned;

1. Make sure all connectors are properly secured. I'll be individually taping them before wrapping with the cable braid.
2. Take my bag with me on all rides - I would have had tools (with which I could've removed the damaged gear and limped home on one motor) and I would've had my helmet bag with me to keep that safe.
3. If I'm going to thrash around learning new things and testing the limits of the board, do it closer to home.
4. If somethings not quite right or out of the norm, do a thorough check before going out on a ride.

Having the board out of action for the week did have the one good advantage of giving me time to work on more of the planned features...

Got the baseplate top-plates made and fitted, along with M6 hardware throughout.
Never actually noticed that I've always had these baseplates fitted with 4x M5s, even though 2 holes are for M6.
So to improve strength and make things uniform I made it M6 throughout by dril ling out the bottom 2 holes on the baseplates.
You may also notice that I've shifted the baseplates and re-drilled the deck to make the wheelbase a bit longer.

![20180816_080337|690x387](upload://7Bzod5pEuVHVhUrknH8h9sKMPoN.jpg)

Front plate has a GoPro mount for my light (and/or for a GoPro).
![20180816_174428|690x387](upload://dhFWrThjyDNL8iKx5FBLHooAUJL.jpg)

Rear plate has tie-down points for my cables with padding to protect the cables from rubbing.

And I bought a nice little hard-shell case for a tool and spares kit;
![20180816_193443|690x387](upload://so41Uno1qFy22kh5xUcgnzoGCe1.jpg)

Has an elasticated pouch on one side, perfect for keeping spares;
![20180816_193455|690x387](upload://zTR1MBkpvgM4STuROKeblUQ0sVA.jpg)

And a tray in the other side to keep my tools together;

Everything one could need for any emergency field repair;
![20180816_193611|690x387](upload://q4otwc4g0vePx8nbTMsbHiVJ7zV.jpg)
Spares of nearly every nut and bolt found on the board, including a spare kingpin and bushings.
Spare Inner Tube
Spare Loop Key, Fuse and batteries for the remote.
And tools to cover everything.

I feel your pain i haven't even rode my board yet and its causing me problems "comp95 deck warped causing the board to banana to the right" i had a little inner tantrum about it last night with the feck it all off what was i thinking thoughts popping up in my angry head, but im in to deep in now, so i spent 3 hours jumping on/stressing the naked deck to see if i could get it to lay flat or flatter at least, it kinda worked but i don't think i should use it now other than for fabrication/setup practice.... :disappointed:

Battle scars. You're riding a rugged mountain board. I honestly would be suspicious of mtb riders without a single scratch on their gear. It's not about the looks, it's about the fun.

Forget about the scratches, the dirt, the optics and go out and have fun. Also forget about fragile but cool looking mounts for gopro, lights etc. That shit should be functional and survive crashes.

My opinion/two cents anyway. :laughing:

Yeah I know, everything new has to get scratched and damaged at some point, it just sucked that it was from something as stupid as dropping my board out my hand.

Anyways, I'm over that now, board is rebuilt and I'm excited to get back on it...

Couple of final touches added;

Spare Wheel Mount;
Made from an old axle from a bent vertigo hanger.
This allows me to carry a spare wheel with bearings and spacers as well as a spare wheel nut.
![20180821_184617|690x387](upload://3JEsDZxQnw5uj0yALYeCNjp2GZ4.jpg)

Machined up a little ally block which fits onto the spare wheel;

![20180821_190328|690x387](upload://5waUF6LfSI8hb9DD27VTiA2yapA.jpg)

Which provides a mounting point for the rear hanger to keep everything together when not on the board;

Thanks!
It's a nice and neat little package.
Easy to carry.
Sits well on its back as it rests on the wheels.
Also acts as a good test stand, can power up and spin the wheels if desired.

From unpowered to powered in 10mins.

Which distance you choose between your deck and our battery box?
IÂ´m in process to design my top mount battery box and not sure how much it should be to get a max flexibility of the deck without to damage the pack.
