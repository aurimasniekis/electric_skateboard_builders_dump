Thanks @bigben, even though we make the same products, we both share a very good vibe between us, I feel we are like brothers. 

This should the spirit of this community!

I heard is @Eboosted and @bigben were going to meet in neutral international waters somewhere in the Atantic to duke it out for Fiberglass Supremacy.

Probably just a rumor though...
