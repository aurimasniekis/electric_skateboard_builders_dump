Since I got into eSk8s I have always wanted a Trampa board, but didn't want the inconvenience of an extremely heavy board since I usually commute to work.

My first Trampa was a street carver, I liked it very much, it rode and looked ok, but there were some things that kept it from being the perfect board. I didn't like the narrow hangers, the height/stance of the board and the square shaped deck, on the other hand when it was converted to urban carver with 7" wheels it looks weird and narrow. Unfortunately, months later it cought fire due a short on the VESC compartment, possibly caused by bullet connector shorting with the body of the charger.

Thanks to all support from the community after my Street Carver went into smoke, specialy from Atilla from @esk8 who shipped ne 2 antispark switches for free!! and support from @trampa to get a new board I was able to resurect The Phoenix.

I love the look of this deck, it's just beautiful, the sbelt line at the center makes it even sexier:

I recycled 30Q batteries from an old project from a friend that couldn't fly with them to Europe, so he sold them to me, they were pretty bad external shape, so I decided to change their isolation vynil.

Spotted weld them:

Packs were out of ballance:

So I decided to ballance them manually discharging them:

Worked on an enclosure design for the HS11/Hollypro deck from  Trampa:
[img]https://i.imgur.com/xaTw01s.jpg[/img]

This was the final result, pretty flexible enclosure with plenty of space between pockets and deck to be able to run 12AGW wires, I used ruber hasket to seal the perimeter of enclosure.

Used fish paper between the packs in order to have an extra layer of protection:

Welded all packs with dual 12AWG wires:

Got some @goldenHusky antispark switches even though I burned 3 mosfets already, they are holding good on my Darth Maul. As he does no sell the on/off switches along with the antispark I got some 19mm ones that are holding pretty good:
[img]https://i.imgur.com/kayYO60.jpg[/img]

I've heard that it's pretty difficult to ride a Trampa MTB with Ultimate MTB trucks, so I purchased the carver base plate which has inner and outter position for springs and drilled the deck and hanger to accomodate inner position for the front trucks:
[img]https://i.imgur.com/xzMAQQG.jpg[/img]

Here is the final VESC compartment, printed the VESC6 enclosure from thingyverse
[img]https://i.imgur.com/iXEwgAX.jpg[/img]

I got the motors from Alien Power Systems 6374S 170KV, they look quality, however I got two designs on each can, one has lines around the can, the other one is smooth, they look weird when looking closely.
[img]https://i.imgur.com/F5Cio7n.jpg[/img]

The motors also come with 10mm shafts, the pulleys are pretty difficult to get, so I took them to the lathe and machined them to 8mm
[img]https://i.imgur.com/nygnwUK.jpg[/img]

This time I went ahead and not used grub screws or keyways just straigh Loctite 620 and it's working pretty good so far, I'm just worried on the possible scenario that I need to remove them, hope they come out fast.

I used 62T drive wheels from @kaly that I had laying around, so I went with 13T motor pullies fro sdp-si.com, I also purchased 12T and 14T in case I need more speed or more torque in the future. I used 375x15  belts, I might need to get the 370 as the motors are hiting the crossbars.

Battery capacity tester installed on the nose for easy reading while riding:

Motor Max 80A
Motor Min -60
Battery Max 40A
Battery Min -20A

Finally I got the meylan rear light which looks amazing.

Ready for a test ride, I'll inform tomorrow how this thing eats the streets and potholes:

I'm waiting for the set of ABEC11 107mm flywheels, those will also be installed when I need more range and crazy acceleration in a ligher package.

I won't use bindings on this build.

Hey man!

I mounted the carver base plate and used a 5mm drill bit through the theaded inner hole, if you align it right there will be no damage to the threads, after the drill bit went through the deck I removed the base plate and use a 6mm drill bit to increase the diameter and allow easy mounting of the spring adjuster.

I ordered my steel motor pulleys there....all custom made, Pap√°. Got them in less than 20 days (I'm in California) while the rest of the esk8 world turned blue waiting for their focboxes and other enchilada from down under during two months. Mines (2) were just $38 bucks shipment included. Pure steel. Solid like a rock.

Get in their website, sign in for an [E-Account](https://eskating.eu/my-account/), become a costumer and start ordering your steel pulleys there. You wont regret it. Choose **Width** (9mm, 12mm or 15mm wide belt); **Bore** (8mm or 10mm wide shaft); **Teeth** (12T, 14T, 15T, 16T, 18T or 20T); **Set Screws** (1xM4, 2xM4 or 1xM5 screws); **Overhang** (with, or without the overhang lip).

Don't waste your time searching the entire planet for these impossible (cheap unicorns) motor pulleys that almost always come from China, are made of aluminum and their teeth wear down after a couple hundred miles.

Beautiful by the way, and glad you got a Trampa resurrection!

Should be less than 165mm wide and 71 long. 

I would love to get my hands on this enclosure for my 4wd direct drive board. I would need 2 focbox enclosures though instead of 1. So fitting the battery might be a bit hard. It has to be a 12s battery but It'll prob feed from my battery backpack so it doesnt need to be huge. 

We will be in touch as to not  hijack this amazing build thread

I got the 170kv motors, 13T motor, 62T wheel pullies, on 12S I should be getting 60km/hr, 54km/hr weighted, the board pulls pretty good from a dead start, maybe even harder than my Darth Maul on Abecs 11 107mm

All in all I'm pretty impresssed with this board, the torque is amazing, final speed it more than enough, the VESC6 have not failed once and I feel pretty safe so far.

There is some rattling on the board even though I adjusted everything, for some reason it seems the bearings have too much play against the wheel hubs, I used teflon tape on the bearings and it's better now but there is still notieable rattling, I'll open the ebclosure today to add more padding on the battery and electronics.

I'm getting a lot of battery sag, so some cells might have some lower capacity than others, may need to replace some of those.

Well I just arrived to my destination from the first hard test ride, 10 miles away from work, this board is the best one I ever had hands down, I didn't have to stop or slow down anywhere, just went through all potholes and service roads I found on my way, no more choosing my route to get good paths, the sidewalk lines are non existent, everything was smooth as butter, I'm impressed.

The board turns/steers as much as my 218mm @torqueboards calibers with riptide bushings thanks to the modification on the front trucks to allow the inner spring position, the rears are on the outside position to avoid woobles and works perfect, it's much more stable than the urban/street carver I had before, the deck, at 16ply is still flexible but it doesn't go all the wat down, so it's great to absorb impacts and it's easy on your knees, as soon as you are on speed the turning is much more touchy but stable.

The acceleration is impressive, these 6474s seem to be more powerful at only 80A motor max and 40A battery max, maybe the ESCapes are more efficient, max speed was 53-57km/hr, enough for this board, I pushed it pretty hard on asphalt, grass and bad rodes.

However, not everything went smooth, almost 1km away from my destination I started to get cutouts, went to check faults and got this:

[img]https://i.imgur.com/eRXF4iJ.png[/img]

I kept on riding but the cutouts got worse:

[img]https://i.imgur.com/Z9ArEoe.png[/img]

I thought these ESCapes where going to be the solution, I still hope there are some small issues that could be easily fixed but I guess I'm going to have to replace the DRV, I wonder if it's still the sam,e DRV8302 found on the 4.12v hardware.

Commuting on this board must be marvelous, does the HS11 deck has less curvature? Comparing with your old board it looks so, but may be the angle of the photo

And this data is for one or both VESC? Especially the consumption

Edit: Looked again on TRAMPA website, actually the HS11 has more curvature, 35mm vs 25

As your temps are 60c and I believe the software is configured to thermal limit at 45C.

I think you need the aluminum housings...3printed housings probably not cutting it...

Very cool build, man! Great enclosure and I like the idea of adding inner holes on the front hanger.

@Pedrodemio you are right and wrong :sunglasses:
The curvature is 1cm more on HolyPro/HS11 deck but the tip and tail is longer, the trucks are mounted on a higher position. Therefore the Deck is lower to the ground with 8" wheels than the urban carver with 7" wheels.

Yes, I was runing with no heat sink. Nevertheless the temps never reached more than 70C though.

I just set up everything to run on BLDC and it has been working OK si far, so a burnt fet might not be the cause of the issue, unless a burnt fet causes ocasional cutouts and DRV faults.

I'd like to send you the ESCape but going all the way back to UK is going to be a PIA, i would rather get support from you to try to narrow down the cause of the issue and test/change electronic components

Thanks, that‚Äôs explain it, then the HS11 looks way better and has more space for batteries underside.

Does the Urba/Street carver trucks work with it since it is a few mm wider? Gummies plus @Nowind geared drive and as much battery as possible would be the ultimate board for me

I don't think so, only the baseplate in combination with modified ATB hanger like @Eboosted did. Without bindings it would be hard to turn with all springs in outer position.

```
I'm using the carver baseplate with atb ultimate hangers, the original Ultimate baseplates have a big hole inside it which won't allow drilling to the inner position.

The turning is pretty much like any other board, maybe 5% less, at high speeds is a bit nervous but totally controllable.

There's no way I'm going back to urethane, at least until this new-board-hype lasts üòé

You guys really need to check on the HS11/HollyPro deck, is longer but fully convertible to EMTB and in a few days I'll confirm the fitment of the 107mm flywheels, the sbelt line of it makes it look sweet, on other decks 8" wheels look extremely tall, less control at high speeds and ugly, on this one the stance is just perfect

Thanks, now it‚Äôs clear, keep us updated on how long theses tires last

On the Flywheel topic, I thought all the full size hangers was 12mm axle, but there is also 10mm which works fines with normal wheels, so no problem, it‚Äôs getting confusing

Yeah, this was very confusing for me also, I have to reread everything on Trampa website like 10 times, all information is there but there is much that is overwelming, until finally I got it right.

There are three ATB (All Terrain Board) truck options:
Infinity (12mm)
Vertigo (12mm)
Ultimate (9.525mm)

You need to go with Ultimate 9.525mm in order to be able to use ABECs, you can also run 8" Superstar wheels which come in 12mm hubs with these bearing conversion spacers:

You doesnt use bearings in that case.. Trampa has some 22x9,525x8 bearing Who you can use with flywheels and the ultimate mtb hangar

If you have the ULTIMATE TRUCKS - 9.525MM TITANIUM AXLE

![image|690x303](upload://jxih8xrDwCid1eThhOMCAQNTOys.jpg)

And the ABEC 11, 107mm flywheels, then you just need to bur R6-2Z or R6-2RS bearings and you won't have the need to use any spacers at all:

https://www.amazon.com/Kart-Shielded-Bearing-R6ZZ-Miniature/dp/B002BBIQU2/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1515861522&sr=8-9&keywords=r6-2z

Howeverm the bearings will go in the hub with a lot of force and are very difficult to remove.

If anyone has a trick to remove them, please post the solution here :wink: )

The downside it‚Äôs more expensive, for less money I could buy a Gummie carver with money to spare compared to buying the HS11 deck and all the pieces to make the truck, maybe frank could make a combo that would be cheaper with the carver baseplate and the √∫ltima ATB Hanger @trampa

Small video from my commute on the Phoenix.

There were parts where I couldn't go more than 10MPH on the the Darth Maul to avoid beating up the board and electronics, even on ABECs 107mm, now I just go full throttle, this board is a game changer, very stable at high speeds and with the front truck mod the radius is ridiculously small.

I'd rather keep the superstar hubs with pneumatics and a second set of flywheels with 36T pulleys for range and crazy acceleration.

The Gummies gave too thin urethane, so I'm pretty sure they will transfer too much vibrations, however if Abec 11 decide to mass produce a 125mm wheel I'll jump on it.

I saw your enclosure with Samsung 30q cells. Do you have the same enclosure for sanyo 20700b‚Äôs? :slight_smile:

For the urban carver deck yes, I have a 20700 cells enclosure, you can fit a 12S3P

Any chance for 12s4p? I am looking for minimum 12s4p. I will run dual 6284 motors.

I don't think there is enough space for 12s4p 20700 cells

Can you measure these sizes?

Is there a possibility that you remake the enclosure above and use some space for the esc part?

There is not much difference between the sanyo and 30q

The difference seems to be small when you compare two cells 1.9mm between both, but if you compare 8 cells that go in parallel then the difference is 15.2mm, almost 1 more cell.

On the other hand you will need to increase the length of the pocket, giving you too little space between p-groups and even less space for the electronics

Thnx for your answer. I have seen this topic from @Idea  https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/enclosures-for-trampa-hs11-and-35-holypro/68260?u=pjotr47

It looks that it is possible to fit. I like the fiberglass look of your enclosure and go try to make a Sanyo enclosure for myself at home.

Cool, thank you! Planing to build a board like yours. Asking if you have built in a BMS or is not enough space in the enclosure for VESC and BMS @12S4P  Cant see it on the pics... :slight_smile:

I took the BMS out like a 2 years ago, never had cell drift fortunately
