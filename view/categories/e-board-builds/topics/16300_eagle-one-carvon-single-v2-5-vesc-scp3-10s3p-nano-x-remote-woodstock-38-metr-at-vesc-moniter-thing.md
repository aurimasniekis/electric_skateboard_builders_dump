Hey everyone!

I finally got around to getting all the parts for my first electric skateboard; the EAGLE ONE. 

**Motor**: I used the Carvon v2.5 hub motor. It has good power, relatively cheap, came with matching trucks and wheels, and best and most importantly, was in stock.

**Battery**: After several months of debating, I finally decided to go with the SPACE Cell Pro 3 from enertion. When looking at batteries from hobbyking, first I ran into the charging in parallel, running in series issue. Then the maintence, such as over charging, undercharging, etc. I decided on a balance charger to fix this. Then was convinced for a BMS. After that, I found out there are many BMS doubters, so I didn't know what to do. I also had to get a voltage meter and an anti spark system. In the end, the price was about the same as the space cell. But what really ended up convincing me was the idea of a warranty, or someone to blame, not if, when I screw up :slight_smile:

**ESC**: I went with the VESC for the reliability. I got it from carvon, trying to stay on the cheaper side. Jerry, from carvon, also sets up the VESC for you, so that's another plus!

**Deck**: Much like the VESC, I went with the cheaper option for the deck. Originally, it was going to be the [34" Quest Rorshack Bamboo Longboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008EZNXHA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1), but the wheel base was too small. I liked this board since it was a smaller board, so I went with the slightly longer [Woodstock Chieftain 38 Inch Longboard Deck 2016](http://www.wiredsport.com/woodstock-chieftain-38-inch-longboard-deck-2016.html#horizontalTab5). Wheelbase is plenty long and deck is nice and firm because the SCP3 doesn't like flex too much...

**Remote**: For the remote, I went with the Nano-x. It looked cool, like it would really fit my hand. This was before the whole binding incident happened, and I'm hoping this won't affect me. Anyway, it came with the SPC3 in a package deal. I have high hopes for it!

**Enclosure**: I used the space cell's enclosure because it came with the space cell. Has plenty of room for more internal components, provides decent protection against the elements, and was a great deal!

**VESC Moniter Thingy**: About a month ago, for the first time I saw a VESC monitor that connects to your phone, and I instantly got it. A few things to note, I know there were a few others before this one, but this was the first one I saw. It is also the only one currently with iPhone and Apple Watch support. So back to it, the metr.at thing just plugs into the VESC, and I think I will have to change a few settings around the BAM! I can see some stats on my phone! Really useful!

Anyway, I have a few parts in already, pictures of them below, and should get the rest of the parts in the next few weeks, so stay tuned!

Hey,

Looks like a really great build.  My build, which I am also in the process of getting the parts for is very similar. I went with the same motor but with Abec 11 wheels.  The battery was also a difficult choice for me, but i ended up deciding to build my own 12s1p battery using A123 26650 cells. I also got the VESC from Jerry, but instead got the remote from diyelectricskateboards because with shipping it was quite a bit cheaper.  They seem similar though. The 'VESC Moniter Thingy' looks really cool.  Do you know of anyway I could buy it?  I still haven't decided on my deck but I was looking at 38 inch ones.  Going to definitely check this deck out.

Looks like an awesome build overall and thanks for sharing.

@spaso Yeah, I would definitely make my own battery pack if I had a spot welder. Maybe for the next build...  if you want to get the VESC Moniter thing, you can buy a transmitter [here](metr.at) and here is the [thread](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/configuration-and-telemetry-for-vesc-ios-android/13483?u=esrapp21) about it, you can read through it to learn about the set up, that's what I did. The deck should be arriving on Saturday, I got it on amazon. I'll get back to you with an opinion on it!

@Esrapp21 I'm building it with a soldering iron but yeah a spot welder would make it much easier.  
Thanks for the transmitter.
I'll be definitely looking forward for you opinion on the deck.

Good Luck!

My latest build is somewhat similar. I did a Carvon v2.5, Generic wheels, Space Cell3, Ollins VESC. Different deck and I went with the Benchwheel remote. It's an awesome setup. My Spacecell enclosure cracked. Enertion offered to replace it at no charge (just shipping), but I ended up switching to the Master Cho carbon fiber enclosure instead. The Carbon Fiber is more durable and it looks sweet albeit costing twice as much. Only thing I would recommend is swapping out the bushings that come with the Funbox trucks for double barrels. Makes for a more stable ride.  

Hit me up if you run into any snags.

Hey @Mrmoonlight,

Just saw pictures of your build on the Master Cho thread. It looks really sick.  Should I just contact Master Cho if I'm interested in his enclosure?  It looks amazing.  Also, your deck looks really nice. How do you like it so far?

Thanks

Ok, so...

The deck is very stiff, no flex at all. It has a pretty decent concave. The main thing though is that it is really heavy. But other than that, it is really the perfect size for me.

Ok, so this is a little off topic, but I got the tracking number for the Carvon order right before Presidents' Day weekend. So I figured there wouldn't be any business day work going on until Tuesday. It was shipped usps priority, so that means 1-3 days I think. But ever since I got the code, it hasn't changed from "Shipping label created, usps awaiting item". Does this mean Carvon still has it? Or does it mean it must have gotten lost in the mail? I emailed Jerry the other day but he hasn't gotten back to me.

One of two scenarios:

2) USPS picked it up but didn't scan it/barcode didn't work/etc

:fearful: wow!  You have a quality receipe here!  You'll be happy you got the 38" deck with a larger wheel base.  I went from a 38" to a small deck and smaller wheel base.  I can say I feel much safer when going at high speeds with the one that had the larger wheel base.  Thanks for sharing the thread on the VESC monitor, this is my first time hearing about it.  Good luck with the build and please do keep your thread updated :calling:

Hey @Esrapp21 ,
Looks like your build is coming along great.  I also have most of my parts, just waiting for the motor from Jerry.
If it says, "shipping label created, usps awaiting item," it probably means they haven't shipped it yet.  I had the same issue and contacted Jerry, and he said his assistant forgot to ship it out.  His customer service was actually great and he gave me an extra set of wheels for free.
Looking forward for everything to arrive and putting it together!
Nick

Yeah, he does have great customer service. I did the same exact thing and reached out to him, and he said it was miss postaged, so it went out the next day. But I didn't get an extra set of wheels... :expressionless:

Ok, so after a bit of research I changed motor max to 80 and batt max to 30. I was wondering which setting I could adjust for more gradual acceleration. It seems from when I press the throttle barely and full power, it doesn't make a difference. I haven't gotten a chance to ride it yet, this is just info from my VESC monitor thing, so the riding resistance might play a role in the varying speeds. Will post update in a few days, but in the mean time, gradual acceleration setting?

When you're just bench testing the throttle is more like an on off switch.  But when you're riding and there's weight on the board the throttle will be more gradual

Ok, so an update:
First ride on my board (and any esk8 ever):
That was the coolest thing in the world. It went plenty fast, and was awesome. I forgot to record the VESC monitor thing, but the board is charging and hopefully I can get one more ride in today. One concern: there was a good amount of speed wobbles. And fix for that?

Tighten your trucks, get harder bushings, spread your stance. Any of those help.

I tightened my trucks, probably a little too much, and widened my stance and it is much better. I will upload my VESC Moniter file later. Over the weekend I'll ride a lot more and give a more comprehensive review of the board.

Good to know.  If you still get wobble try some harder bushings.  Any skate shop will have them.

## \#33 Posted by: Mrmoonlight Posted at: 2017-03-03T20:54:35.300Z Reads: 136

```
You shouldn't have any issues with speed wobbles with the stock Carvon setup once you tighten the trucks down. You want to make sure that when you are standing on your deck, you have a smooth level of increasing resistance from center to lean vs. a loose pivot part way followed by resistance from your bushings. The tighter your bushings are, the more stable you will be. When you're first getting used to your board, more resistance is better. I've been skating for decades and whenever I get a new deck, I still keep my bushings extra tight until the board starts to feel natural. Once you get used to your board and having a motor on it, you'll be able to loosen up your trucks quite a bit and still feel very stable. 

If you want more stability combined with a good turning radius, I recommend double barrel bushings. It will help keep your trucks centered.

Ok, so I'm going to do the Schuylkill loop, which is about 9 miles. I'm pretty sure the board can make it that far, but what are some tips to maximize range?
```

---
## \#35 Posted by: Mrmoonlight Posted at: 2017-03-05T17:08:17.109Z Reads: 123

```
9 miles should be no prob. I can do that with hills and still have 40% - 60% battery life left. If you want to increase range, give a couple pushes when starting from a stop and make sure you start up hills with a fair amount of speed. If you hit a down hill grade, tuck and let gravity take over. Avoid rough pavement.

With a little pushing here and there when starting off and going up Long up hills, I've gotten 30miles out of a charge.

Basically the same as yours. I think the only major difference is the Benchwheel Remote and Ollin VESC. 

If I'm not trying to save any on battery power, I generally have around 25%+ left in my battery pack after 9 or so miles. Lots of stops and starts, rough streets, powering up steeper grades...

Today I was riding on pretty flat ground at around 15 mph and started to lose control. I instinctively started the breaks, but ended up flying, then sliding on the ground. I was whereing [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00E9RP1KY/ref=sr_ph_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1488936731&sr=sr-1&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&keywords=Speed+and+Strength+SS700+Solid+Speed) helmet and it pretty much saved me from a concussion. Just a reminder that even going slow on a flat road subjects you to injury.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/0/60ffdebfe38c044b2a077c398cc7a1cfec8a3227.JPG" width="666" height="500">

@NAF it depends. When pumping it to it’s max, or when on super hilly terrain, it seems to get around 12 miles. But in a moderate cruise it can go 16-17 miles. Keep in mind I’m light (only about 115 lbs), so this may vary.
