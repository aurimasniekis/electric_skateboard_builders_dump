Haven’t hit top speed yet but in theory this should hit 27MPH. These PsychoHubs are really balanced at high speeds even with the trucks fairly loose. The tires handle pretty well in the dirt. I have plenty of clearance and I can interchange the wheels with 97mm flywheel clones.
I'll try to get a video as soon as I can.

Really Nice build!

Do you have a close up pics of the drive train?
I'm working on a very similar setup
Did you have to put 10mm bearings in the psychohubs?
Also how did you fill in the drop through holes?
I assume you got the 177mm axel trucks.
What's the total length of widest part of the axel tip to tip? 
Sorry for all the questions

Awesome @mccloed! Do you use all of the space in the custom enclosure to fit the battery, VESC, and (I assume) a BMS? Also, why did you select TKP vs RKP?

Looks great! You're running FOC? How many miles have you put on it so far?  I'm thinking about doing a build with pneumatic wheels as well.

Did you have to put 10mm bearings in the psychohubs? Yup. Got the 10mm axles.
Also how did you fill in the drop through holes? I 3d printed a plug from thingiverse.
I assume you got the 177mm axel trucks. Correct.
What's the total length of widest part of the axel tip to tip? I'll get a measurement for ya.

Yup. Pretty much used most of the space. This board is only 38" long. I chose the TKP's because they carve a little better than reverse king pin trucks. This is especially good for off road, in my opinion.

Yup. Using FOC. I've only put about 10 miles on it, so far. But the first three were pretty hard miles on dirt and grass to test the strength of this set up.

Does that mean that the total truck width is even narrower than a standard caliber 2 (180mm) ? Do you have any issues with wheel bite?

No wheel bite. I added 30mm to each side. So, total hanger length of 237mm.

@nmagz3, I plan on using it on packed dirt and grass. Worked great last week in AZ on the side of the road. Went into some small rocks and it went one way and I went the other.:smile:

Thanks @mccloed How do you add 30mm to each side? Is that with a product from Surfrodz?

Thanks so much for posting those pics!

Do you have some sort of spacers between the wheel pulley mad the hub?
And did you have to drill out the hubs to fit 10mm bearings or are the outside diameter the same as standard 8mm skate bearings?

Also thanks for all the links in your first post it really makes it easy to research gear.

Hey @Bender, they are 3/4" standoffs and an extra bolt to space the pulley out a little. The bearings are specific 10mm bearings and are the same diameter as 8mm bearings. These came with the surfrodz.

Are you sure there are enough screws holding that enclosure on? :joy:

You have to add 30mm spacers to each side and get 80mm long hardware. The longest surfrodz come with is 70mm.

Nope. I need to add 50 more like this guy I know. :unamused:

As long as you order the 177mm hangers with 10mm axles you're good. Because you'll end up getting longer axles and 30mm spacers elsewhere anyways.

@psychotiller @mccloed awesome thx but I'm still a little confused; These are 177mm surfrodz with an added surfrodz 10mm axle. Where do the 30mm spacers come from?

You can get the spacers from surfrodz but they come in 10mm sections. I sourced 30mm long spacers from aluminumspacers.com
