I was wonder to create a new and improved products to help the DIY Electric Skateboard community.
If you have any suggestions, please feel free to comment on our post that way we are more aware of what you would prefer to use.
will likely to make it as below:
40″ Aluminum CNC Deck
We are working on new 40″ Aluminum CNC Deck.
Enclosure will be Built-in the deck.
This setup will fit a 10S4P battery pack.
Choose to use either
Belt Drive
Hub Motors

how do you think of it everyone,any ideas?
http://www.diyeboard.com/foldable-elect ... p-434.html

the problem should be weight control, can 10kgs acceptable?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/7/276670e7fafe60797c3a20461d7daf50c1f3c3e8.jpg" width="500" height="500">

Hub motors I think would be best if you are folding it are those links in the middle gonna lock once unfolded? Be prepared to feel a lot of vibration that metal deck is going to shake your spine it might not be so good for your electronics either, also u will want to add a heatshrink on the outside so it doesn't become an oven in there

I agree, I also prefer hubs for simple and compact shape.
i think better put it flex, so vibration won't too much.
about heat sink i will put it down buit in the deck enclosure.
should that work well?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/d/5d83d1d0bb61281526c445902948b7d9c0a79916.jpg" width="500" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/e/3eb8041b3f29404b6fccdf4237f71ef8c845b54e.jpg" width="500" height="500">

this is sick! I love it! you might want to make the main deck where you stand on wood to save weight - it might add to the aesthetic as well. You could join the wood and the hinge with a nice cnc block of aluminum on those last hinge pieces. Great work

and thks you gus guide me the improvement, it make sense, i will try to make it similar as linky but in a better iron solid look.

Funky design.  I realise that you have probably over engineered your prototype on purpose, but I reckon the thickness of the deck (over the trucks) could be half of what it is currently. Is it 10mm thick at the moment?

Why have you gone with a compound hinge in the middle when you could have used a simpler style hinge?

Looks amazing. Have you ridden it at all yet? I ask because the hinge would worry me a bit. In case I'm misunderstanding: is it the case that the hinge allows the board to collapse inwards, but the links cannot go past the point where the board is flat by dint of the shape of the links - i.e. they are compressively held at that zero angle? And, if that is the case are you locking it in that position when you are riding, or could the board still fold up (if say the road spontaneously disappeared)?

I'd just worry about longer potholes or the like - if the front of the board folded down that would in turn change the angle of attack into the rising edge of the hole and you might find exiting holes rather like hitting a brick wall. An analogy: hard suspension cars can force the wheels down into holes very quickly and thus on the exit the force is against the front face of the tyre and the jolt is high. On soft (or slow) suspension cars the wheels are less inclined to be pushed into a hole and tend to ride over more of them. I'd worry that with the weight of the front foot the front of the board my flop into a hole and on the exit of that hole break your ankle - or in a less extreme circumstance: vibrate your electronics to hell as you go over any slightly uneven roads.

But I could be wrong! I used to teach mech eng at a uni specializing in automotive suspension systems so can be a bit obsessive - it might well be that you have configured it to lock flat somehow, or I could just be completely wrong and the floppiness might be a total non-issue!

I'm guessing, just by looking at this design in the photos, there's no way this deck can be 'clicked' or held in it's folded out flat state? Therefore I think @dannyboy 's worry may be founded. What you don't want is to hit a big bump or a pothole, and for the board to suddenly 'jackknife' vertically on you, flinging you forward. 

I like how you've reduced the amount of links towards the middle of the bend, but . . . . If you didn't do that, and kept them at a consistent width, what you could do is build a loop hole/tunnel on to each outside edge of the outside links that would enable you to slide an aluminium rod through to keep the board fully outstretched and in it's flat state. This would also add strength. They could be spring loaded and only come out yay far so that they don't come off and get lost etc.

Just a thought....

If you hit a normal pothole on a board, your going to eat asphalt anyways. I agree it should not be able to flex inward when riding, but nothing in es8 is ever going to go over potholes. (maybe trampas)

```
Further to my own 'non-issue' comment - I may well be worrying about nothing. In the same sense that bees happily fly about and yet their aerodynamics seem to simple minded humans to be utterly inefficient. I also am absolutely convinced that skateboards cannot work and yet they do - I genuinely cannot conceive of how the bearings hold up so well considering the forces involved in what is a largely undamped system. As for mounting hub motors... the bearings in that case can be bigger, but the stator<->magnet clearance; how the blazes do they not foul when the wheels hit bumps!??! But they do actually bear up very well somehow so my worries about your auto-collapsing board may not be a problem.

If it does work, I insist you go to massive lengths to film yourself, or rather the board, entering a pothole at high speed (both the film speed & your speed) so that I can see how it behaves.

I like darkkevind's sliding pin idea to lock it - would look amazing too, like a safe in a bank full of sliding bolts.

Am impossibly jealous of your access to the Alu and the CNC by the way. I cannot imagine how much it costs to prototype things like that - worth it if you can afford it, as it really is stunning to look at.

hope my photos can somehow inspire us to move forward.

yes, that's always what I want to do, see photo I designed is with concave, but in reality cnc can't do much in cancaving, and also aluminum materials selection, not much option on market, and if thinner also make the board not much solid if too much pressure on it.

Depending on the thickness of the aluminium, you could put a couple of slight bends along the profile of the deck where I have indicated with red lines, (for example 25 degree bends) in the deck to simulate the concave profile and increase strength.  I have done it with 3mm aluminium on my deck and it has worked well.

The longitudinal profile would look like this:

Surely a bender could do this in a controlled way after milling? If stress cracks were an issue then annealing before bending and post bending harden would involve a high temp with a water quench followed by a lower temp, I am not conversant with the process but I think it is possible

The bends could be added after cnc cuts are made and can be added easily with a sheet metal brake.

i gotta be honest. Never in my 5 years of using a skate/longboard as my primary form of transportation did I ever wish it could fold in half. I applaud the innovation though for sure. One thing to keep in mind though is something I learned with a few other engineering projects of mine that I thought would be good products is that the people that could afford my product were not the people that would actually benefit from it. I could be wrong, but from personal experience when I was in a point in my life where I didnt not have the space at home/work for a normal/small skateboard/longboard, I also did not have the money to spend on an electric skateboard. Now that I am making plenty of money to afford a nice electric skateboard, I do not need to be so concious of the space it takes up. You are also adding steps into the routine of riding a board and also adding several potentional points of failure with such an intricate joint. 

Please dont take this in a negative way, I just dont want your idea to end up like my idea to make smart autonomous blinds that only shaded the areas of your window where direct sunlight was hitting to optimize natural airflow and cooling in conjunction with  windows that would open and closed based on whether or not someone was approaching your accessible windows. Sounds sick, works awesome, however I realized before that the people who could afford this most likely had air conditioning.

You're pretty much right there, although I can see two types of potential customers this could benefit.

1. Student. Pro: can fit in their locker. Con: Absolutely won't be able to afford this board unless mummy or daddy pay for it.

2. City commuter. Pro: will fit in back pack whilst on train/subway (if journey's too long for e-board). Alternatively for the last mile, say if a city worker doesn't want to pay inner city parking prices. Probably can afford it. Con: Will probably still be in the pricey side

Hi,

I really like what I see on your website! Lots of new bits and bobs that I haven't seen before that have caught my attention. I am definately signing up for your newsletter and will be checking your website periodically :slight_smile: 

Just a quick question, at the beginning of this thread you mentioned you were looking to offer the foldable deck on its own and it should be able to house a 10s4p battery. Did you change your mind or is the deck only option still available, since I cannot find any deck only options on your website.

Thanks, Armin

mant tks to your post here, we much appreciate your attention to us.

Unfortunately the diyeboard story came to an abrupt end after a disagreement led to them feeling compelled to posting credit card details on this very forum, they got a bit of a ban for that.

Also they had some issues with telling the complete truth along the way, like most mass produced Chinese esk8 producers or if you like resellers the parts quality was questionable
