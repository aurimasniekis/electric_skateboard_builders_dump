Hey Guys.

For those who seen my thread on the Evolve Bamboo GTX All Terrain and how I canceled my order to build my own mountainboard - this is the thread were I will document my progress.

So basically the Idea is a Trampa Board with the following setup:
1 x VERTIGO Mountainboard Deck with CNC lite 12mm HOLLOW Axle Trucks 
     - .
: 35Âº HOLYPRO Deck Shape 
     - .
: 16ply 35Âº HOLY PRO MTB - Stiff 
     - .
: WHITE Powdercoated with Blue logo VERTIGO Baseplate 
     - GREEN DAMPA's - 75a Firm Steering
     - Powder Coated BLUE Springs
     - .
: Please fit 5 Spoke SUPERSTAR Hubs 
     - .
: White Gloss Blue Logo Rim 
     - .
: BLUE Anodised Spokes 
     - .
: 8 Inch BLUE Primo ALPHA Tyres 
     - .
: BLUE ATB Bearings - 12mm Axles 
     - .
: RATCHET Style Bindings please 
     - White Strap with Blue Foam Footstraps 
     - WHITE with BLUE logo L-Brackets 
     - BLUE Powder Coated Ratchet Buckles 
     - .
: Heel Straps with BLUE Ratchets

From the Motor side I decided to go for 2x 6374 150KV from BioBoards.

I will use a FOCBOX Unity (once shipped) to drive those puppies.

My Battery Setup is a 12S4P (for now).
I designed the battery holders myself and printed them out on my 3D Printer - this gives stability and makes it a overall nice package.
Range is not my main focus - I want to see which range I can get on a 12S4P and later on if needed I will upgrade the parallel pair if the range is incredibly bad.
I use a 12S (80A-100A) BMS on this battery pack.

To round things of I decided to get a E-Toxx mini direct drive with helical gear setup.

Here are some photos for the start - will update them once there are news - and once again thanks for convincing me to cancel my Evolve Order and go DIY. I already have some experience from my other ESK8 Longboard Projects so this should be fun.

good decision!
do you have some pictures from the battery inside?
IÂ´m interested how you connected the packs with each other.
Are those taps on the cells the stock taps you can order them with, or you welded them on by your own?

Hey andy

I order them with the Tags from nkon.nl
every row of my holder has 8 batteries and there is a total of 6 rows (8x6 = 48 cells = 12s4p).
I connected 4 of them in parallel and then connected to the next pair of 4.
So it means each row has 2 parallel pairs.
For connecting the parallel pairs I used a thicker wire because the tag only would not have a desirable amp rating by itself.

So I just soldered the parallel pairs together with the tags. If you have a soldering iron that can get hot enough and you sand the tags a bit then it will hold up quite well.


Just don't want to invest in a spotwelder that I only use once every 2 years.

Have a good day

Connected the BMS and tested the app.. looks good so far. Now waiting for the motors, direct drive and focbox to be shipped.![20190329_140859|281x500](upload://mjzvzhen9R9Qg8EAEmcpQdUz7Kt.jpeg) ![Screenshot_20190329-140838_xiaoxiang|281x500](upload://wTMj92e2e37YviyG9t0yZ4iseSZ.jpeg)

Yes - it's also skilled :stuck_out_tongue:
I kinda like the approach with the bluetooth module and the app - it's really a good app as I use the same type on my longboard for over a year and it's flawless.

I would kill for a charge only BMS with bluetooth that is also small.
The vesc takes care of the current and total voltage and if a p group has a problem I could get a notification on my phone.
Unfortunately the only one I know that fits these parameters is this one but I don't know how reliable it is.

I have that one, but use only as external charge and to monitor the cell voltage.
What if you wire up balance wires out of the enclosure and use a lipo alarm instead?
You can still use this one for charge and monitoring and while driving you will get a notification if one cell goes bad.

![20190329_170808|690x388](upload://gse4OyYtAZbuMWX3fqduIHXTJKD.jpeg)

Is a Anti Spark Switch recommended on a mountainboard or should I just go for a wired Loop Key ?

I also would like to experiment with 63V Capacitors in parallel in a similar fashion to this PCB
(the pcb shown is a rectifier filter - however just to show that the plan is to have loads of caps on one pcb in parallel)

![image|411x285](upload://OCtLyRWzi60jNTKCRvQK4YCMa8.jpeg) 

50x pcs low esr 63V Caps have to help voltage sag.. just not sure if its worth my time.
Of course I would fuse this separate PCB in case any of those caps decides to short out.

Yes I am glad that people made me aware of the fact that the evolve gtx is only a good board for people who can't build a DIY Board.

Honestly I had to take a lot more money into my hand now for this project but the outcome will be no comparison for sure and it will be my custom own :star_struck:

Yes - I used some thick wire as well as the tags themselves. According to my calculation it should be good for 120A.

I have yet to decide if I will use the BMS for Discharge or only Charge operation but this will be shown in a comparison test I guess.

Maybe blue motor wire sleeves in the future? ;)

I wish jenso would offer more colour options for the gear drives, it would open up alot of options for crazy looking builds

Yes blue wire sleeves would have been nice - however I could nit find any - so next option would have been white - however white would look dirty after a couple of rides so I decided to go for the middle ground which is grey.
However If a matching blue sleeve will find it's way to me I might change it in the next revision

Actually it's white - but my main focus was the blue/white color scheme... However it's impossible to have the same blue shade everywhere - as well as the exact same snow white so for some parts I have to make a compromise.

So only thing left is the unity focbox and the anti spark switch. However Enertion might only ship it sometime in May and shipping from Australia takes quite a while. Well enough time for other details in the meantime :slight_smile:

Maybe it just looks like in the picture, but do you stand on the board with not inflated tires?
If yes, take care you can damage the inner tube like that. If you inflate them thsn just on the day when you want to drive first time and you directly have a flat tire, that sucks.

When doing the E-Toxx assembly you have to open up the hubs/tires - I just didn't have a pump to fill them up again :) I won't ride it before I get my Unity Focbox so I have another 2-3 months :open_mouth:

Get this pump. It is small enough to carry it with you.

You never know what you hit on the road.
If you donâ€™t take care during assembly you can also cut the inner tube with the hub parts etc. Million was to get a flat tire.

Still thinking about if my 80A (continous) BMS is good enough or if I should only use the BMS for Charging... Any thoughts ?

BMS is for 12S 80A (continous) and 160A Overcurrent protected.

I don't have data from my Trampa but in my Evo with 2x 6374 Maytech motors I have never drawn 80A according to metr . My max battery draw has been around 70-75A and that only lasted seconds. Motor amps on the other hand are another story. Whatever I set the maximum, I reach.

My guess is you will be fine.

Great.. thought so as well.. with my current Longboard Project I can barely hit 35A with one 6384 Motor so I figured the 80A BMS should be good for 2x 6374.

Some pictures.
I put some grip tape underneath the enclosure and strapped it down with two straps.. seems quite stable.

Also put some loctite on my pretty loose bearings, wonder if all Trampa boards have this problem?

Trying to slim down the enclosure.. can fit battery and anti spark switch into one enclosure and will make a separate one for the focbox

Prepared all the cables for the smaller vesc case that should arrive next week. Quite happy with the overall size reduction even though it makes wiring and fitting quite a task, but since I have some extra time until the focbox unity gets shipped I am just fine with that.

I use the same case/box for my tail mounted Escapes its a bit smaller than the 206 ultrabox and way cheaper.

Thanks... your build looks sick as hell too !
Cool to see others used the same case.

I kinda came to the conclusion there is no logical way around two separate boxes if you want to have a nice clean compact build.

I used the mount that was included with the lights.. With some bending I was able to fit it on the trucks.
Not sure about how stable they are once I get going with the board - but this has to be tested :slight_smile:

Small update. Got my focbox case and installed the wires already. Have to go on a business trip and will hopefully get the focbox when returning and finishing this thing up.
