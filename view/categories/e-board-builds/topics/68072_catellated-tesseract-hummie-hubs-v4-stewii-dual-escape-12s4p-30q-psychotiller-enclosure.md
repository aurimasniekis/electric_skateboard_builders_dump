This all started with a chinese hub motor board. It did the job, but it left me wanting more. More power, more speed, more fun. So I began my descent into madness(the forum)...

I had a few requirements in mind:
* Hub motors: I love the stealthy feel of having the motors built into the wheels. I do understand the downsides of this approach, and honestly if @Hummie didn't make these I would've went with conventional satellite motors.
* Kicktail: On a college campus, would be nice if I could kick up the nose for the some quick direction changes.
* Relatively Short: The vanguard clone my meepo board came with is all the downsides of the vanguard design without any of the upsides. Even so, I mostly felt it was a bit too long.

This all started with the purchase of dual Escapes by @stewii. I initially bought 2 pcbs and had attempted to solder my own together to save a quick buck, but the process was neither quick nor cheap. After spending far too many hours getting the first once soldered and cleaned up and programmed and tested, I found out the second one was completely borked. Something was shorting the 5v to ground, and even after removing all the components between 5v and gnd, it was still shorted. I gave up and ordered a dual. 

With the purchasing process started, I took the opportunity to hop on @Hummie's hub train and ordered a set. With that in mind, I chose a 12s battery to maximize that speed, since I wouldn't be able to change gearing ratios like on a satellite drive train. There's a long story where I tried to separate some multistar lipos to make a flat pack, but somehow the solder didn't melt??? So I ended up buying 30q's from imr and spot welding a 12s4p pack. (If anyone wants 4s 16Ah multistar batteries for like, $50, hmu)

Got the hookup with the Sunko cuz a friend of mine is in a club that regularly makes 15kwh batteries. The Sunko was meh, but it seems to have done the job, will update in the event of problems I guess...

Now that @psychotiller enclosure there is the lorimer burst, and it's supposed to be 23.5 inches long and it is definitely not 23.5 inches long. I cut off the cable routing piece at the end in order to bring it down to size a bit. Also in order to make the enclosure fit better, I hit it with a heat gun and hand formed it to match the wheel wells better. The result is pretty ok, hopefully it doesn't result in any stress fracturing.

There also wasn't enough depth in the enclosure thanks to the wonderful concave, so I double layered the foam to increase the available space inside. But even with that, the wiring of the bms to vescs was so tight, I didn't even remember to get a photo of it before roughly trying to squeeze everything inside. I'd rather not open up the enclosure just to take a photo of it.

Also thanks to @Winfly for "shipping" the hubs to me, got them way sooner than I expected.

Build is "done" in the sense I'll be riding it with Baesk8 tomorrow (first group ride :open_mouth: such excite), but there is still plenty to change and fix.

* Hook up the switch to 5v from a vesc to make it light up when the board is on
* Finish cutting up that foam, looks kind of ridiculous with it extending so much past the end of the enclosure
* Get more screws to mount the Escape enclosure completely
* Figure out how to cable manage the phase wires, there's no space inside the enclosure, trust me.
* Install countersunk washers (ordered, just haven't arrived yet)
* more to come(?)....

That's a beautiful build!
The Cantellated Tesseract is one of the sexiest decks out there. For me 36 inch is just the sweet spot. I ride a 39 inch deck at the moment and don't use the whole length of the board, I am 6 foot tall. My board has a Kicktail too but because of the length I always have to step back to make use of it.

i have the greased up bearings, not the fancy japanese ones. It just cogs if i try to get going from a standstill. It's also really hard to push, all that grease holds the board from moving on a slight incline.

This tesseract was the deck that I wanted to my previous build, but too expensive here

Superb build with the hubs

About the whine, if you haven’t changed yet, increase the switching frequency on the FOC tab from 20 KHz to 30 KHz and they will be dead quiet

And about the cogging, if the bearings are not spinning free, try to keep the motors spinning for a few minutes and then do the detection again to loosen it up

Also, are you giving enough throttle? It may seem counterintuitive, but if you don’t give enough throttle it will cog not matter what

PHEW went 22 miles on it today and damn is it a blast. Rode around SF with @Winfly and others, these motors at 12s are absolutely amazing, anytime you need acceleration, you got it. going up a hill and want to go up faster? you got it. I get a bit wobbly cranking it, but I just need more miles on it. 

https://metr.at/r/QNVZL

@Pedrodemio I'm at 30KHz and it's definitely quiet, forgot just how loud boosted boards are... Also yeah I get you with the throttle, but the acceleration is so strong I get thrown once the motor stops cogging. More practice is needed

@Saturn_Corp Honestly, pretty not bad. I've never personally had a belt driven setup so I can't really say how different it is.

Nice ride, the consumption a bit high, but by looking you are riding at 35 km/h most of the time

About the start, you can play with the Openloop ERPM, double it , halve it and see what works best

My bet would be in increase it, also you can try

*rant start*

So I've got a firefly from https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/for-sale-firefly-esk8-remotes-and-parts-kits-no-longer-accepting-requests/56558?u=deltazeta about 1-2 months ago and initially I was pretty happy with it. Everything seemed to be working, felt pretty ok in the hand, I was pleased. But I was able to test it and use it until now.

This thing is trash.

The 3d print quality is incredibly low, layers are delaminating and entire strips of plastic have fallen off the sides of the casing. Attempting to smooth the surface with XTC-3D basically wasted the stuff since the print would literally suck up the epoxy into the print instead of letting it sit on top. The screws strip out the holes so now they're just there for decoration, oh wait, no they fell out and now the casing is just held together with duct tape. 

The electronics are anxiety-inducing. I dropped the remote after arriving in SF and the crystal from the arduino literally fell right off the board. The thing is supposed to be soldered on, what even. After precariously duct taping the thing back on, I found out the remote would disconnect if I even placed my hand over the area with the rf transceiver. :scream: And then the solution to this was to flip the pcb over??? I can only guess as to why that worked, maybe the interference from power delivery is not as bad when its closer together??? And the straw that broke the camel's back, the reason I'm ranting here is the deadman's switch had a wire come off just randomly while I was using it. When's the next wire going to remove itself and cause my death?

*rant end*

Honestly I don't blame either Seethebridges or Solidgeek, love the design and even being able to use a remote with such a appealing design, I just wish it worked more reliably :pensive:

@Pedrodemio @Sn4pz yeah the wheels are so greased up and resistant that I can leave my board on a decent incline and it doesn't go anywhere.

@dougpage I've tested it to up to 33mph, so its likely around 80kv, @Hummie probably knows best, but i think that's a great range to be around. If you want my advice, get the fancy japanese bearings, feels much better.

I've had similar observations but have yet to actually test or use it yet. The prints are noticeably lower quality with uneven surfaces. I dropped it once and felt liek something came loose and the deadman switch started to feel abit off with inconsistent throw. 

Opened it up and tried to align everything properly before putting it back together which took me a longer time than expected. Still not sure if its because of the casing but I do plan on ordering a couple of cases which should provide better durability.

The screws do feel like they aren't really doing anything in holding the case together but I'm giving the benefit of the doubt to @SeeTheBridges because He's had alot going on for him that time. cost me quite abit so I still want to get a good experience at the very least from the components. Shell or casing can more easily be replaced or upgraded.

its probably not just the grease in the bearings and you should give it to me to make sure the bearings aren't being compressed.  i think one of @Winfly's motors also has a bearing  compressed.  i didn't know what i was doing and those were some of the first put together.

I guess either balance leads shorted from vibration tearing insulation, or your cells in between from vibration made contact or just too high current I don't know if your metr records are 2x or just single motor but if its single motor 40A bat (80A total) is bit too much to handle for 4P 30Q

So as I was carrying my board from class, smoke started leaking out the sides of the enclosure. I tossed the board to the ground and took a step back, but 30s to 1min later, the board erupted in fire. Kept burning for a while until someone found a fire extinguisher.

@Kug3lis I agree, must have been something shorting the batteries together, tried to pack too must in too little space.  

@Hummie Honestly, these motors are rock solid, the bushings melted off, the urethane got a bit drippy, but the motors still feel like when i got em so the windings and bearings must be not bad. Pretty good heat test if you ask me :stuck_out_tongue:. Hopefully I can come by to get these fixed up, I don't feel like giving up yet

do you remember if the balance leads crossed each other?

the side of the pack where the balance leads were, was that side boardside or roadside?

last question, was the battery just lying inside the enclosure or did you mount it to the deck?

sorry about your board.

Do you have any additional pics of the battery build? Cant say I see anything crazy wrong. Though the balance leads look kind of haphazardly placed and not isolated from the cells. 

And this below always scared the shit out of me on 18650 builds, if that little corner gets pushed in it could go under the insulation and short out. 

![image|690x359](upload://aeC0xEOT2kukfqzO7U5bMTi6yA4.jpeg) 

I think this reinforces the idea that 18650 packs **can** be more dangerous than lipo, just due to there being many more ways to short a pack. And ironic since you originally planned to run lipo. :weary: :cold_sweat:  The reason you couldnt solder it is that the tabs are aluminum and you need special aluminum solder.

Kepton tape keeps the heat inside so you might want to use non flamable foam strips.. but best is to build with space and mind to put enough insulation.. also understand that there might be also slight flex.. so don't make all super stiff if you have room

Its definitely possible. I thought I covered them with electrical tape, but could've been a victim of vibrations.

I could believe it. I had hoped the fish paper would be enough for that.

I'm really sorry to see your board catching fire, it was a really nice looking board, I've been there and all you think is "it could have happened in my house, I'm glad it didn't" , but if you posted this on the forur, you might bee looking for answerrs on why this happened, so allow me to give you a couple of suggestions not only for you but for anyone looking to improve the safety of they packs:

1. These nickel strip ends where rubbing on the circled spots:

![image|666x500](upload://nrBPjpOv16mAgV9d3vYY5FBY6wT.jpeg) 

They are really sharp and very easy to get in contact with the negative pole.

Here is another error:

You should ALWAYS the corners like this:

2. When you make a battery array as shown in your pictures, there will be a big leverage against the borders of the battery, negative pole, when ever the board flexes to the bottom or top, I always suggest to connect P-Groups with silicone wire, it will give you much more play on daily vibrations

3. You MUST always isolate balance leads from cells, if they rub you will have fire sooner or later.

4. You should ALWAYS use fish paper between P-Groups when mounting them in parallel and then stick groups together with silicone, hot glue or heat shrink so they don't move and rub against each other, otherwise heat shrink and/or the original cell wrap will wear and cause a short.

i just think that if the balance wires would be short,
wouldn´t it just burn them out and good?
I once shorted one blance wire, and it just burnded down in a millisecond without 
to damage the cell.
but for sure the burned wires could burn holes in the cell isolation and start a big short there too.

Balance leads shorting could be one of the issues but my vote is for the sharp nickel strips rubbing against negative, second cause p-Groups rubbing against each other

kapton won't do much to stop abrasion - I use a combination of fishpaper stuck to 2mm foam for isolation

That’s a shame, such a cool board

My bet is also on the sharp nickel, in a traditional build that wouldn’t be a problem, but with a folding layout like yours it get pushed into the cell 

A balance wire short can result in a fire, but since they are thin the chance is bigger to just melt right away acting like a fuse

Personally I will be probably using plastic sheets of like 1mm in between to isolate
[/quote]

one layer of Bubblewrap on each side works too. it takes some space, but its awesome dampening :smirk:

It would be nice to have a thin plastic design (like Raptor 2?) to protect everything (main cables/leads/etc). Anyone have this design for flat packs ? 10s4p/12s4p?

You used the balance leads that came with the bms, right? I think 24awg? And not silicone? I would think they'd self fuse before wrecking stuff...

Since we are all here to check battery fault, now got me scared. I am going to make a 12s3p. I made this diagram, @Eboosted Could you please check it if it sound good for you?
![BatteryDiagram12s3p|690x341](upload://dp3ZOC76aeeE6JLX3cPrU2MDjFR.jpeg) 
I have to follow this distribution because I do not have a lot of space. basically the last two P groups are on a second layer. I would have few questions:
1- I will use 10x0.15mm nickel strip, 1 is enough for the P group or better use 2 since I am going to connect the them in series with only the wires?
2- For series connections do you think 12awg or 2 16awg is enough or better on 12 paird with one 16awg. If I check only 12awg is rated for 41A, while 16awg for 21A.
Isolation rings on the positive side and fish paper under the balance leads. Between parallel group I will use fish paper and also on top to separate it from the second layer. P groups glued together. Kapton tape on both of the sides of each 6 parallel group and foam in the middle to keep the two cell lines isolated.Then I will heat shrink the two layers separately and place the bms externally.
I won't use the cell fuse method because I do not have enough space in height to do it or maybe I can check it better later when I get all the parts. 
The enclosure is covered by foam around the battery and the battery is secured to the desk.
What do you think about the diagram and the plan? Thanks a lot to everyone that wants to contribute.
I uploaded here the pptx in case someone want to correct it or use it for is purpose :grin:

vibration Is the #1 battery killer, just having it sealed is not enough. 
There are many products available that will help reduce the impact vibration has. 
There are many ways to build a battery, and many have shared good advice and technical information. 
Just remember to be safe and understand what can happen in hopes of being prepared if it does.

No that would be the plan for my new battery. I wanted to ask before build it.

Do you know a good material that can withstand the vibrations and keep everything safe?

I bought a cheap thin cutting board from the dollar store. Cut it and put between my P groups. Works great so far, along with fish paper and Kapton tape of course.

vibration I don’t think is a problem and u can vibrate all day but if ur constantly flexing it will strain the nickel connections and they need have some flex points with maybe silicone wire as shown or even a good fold point in the solid conductor, and maybe the foam for the vibration is more detrimental than helpful by pushing potentially sharp edges into cell casings

I use NESE modules and this is my way of dealing with flex and vibration. The downside is that I need a 7.5" wide enclosure to fit everything. And no one seems to have it :sob:
