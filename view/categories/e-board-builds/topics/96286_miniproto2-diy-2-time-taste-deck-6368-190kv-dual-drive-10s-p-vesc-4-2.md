Okay i have decided to build a board with Belt Drives.
Nothing new so far.. ðŸ˜‹
For me not just riding gives me enjoyment more building the Product. 
So im still processing in Composites, Mechanics and Electronics. 

So far i have made a Glassfiber mold and the case for the battery tray from Carbon Fiber.

Very nice battery tray there, going to be wanting to do something similar soon. How do you get the corners so neat? Just lay a single sheet and it forms OK, or do you cut and fold around?

Well i would use Vacuum pump if you got the Mold already. Or better infusion technology..  Yeah i would cut the Fiber a bit. 
Im planning to do a small series of Carbon-Glas Fiber trays for sale.
