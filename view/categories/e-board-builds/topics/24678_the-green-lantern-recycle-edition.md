Okay, so I owned a Yuneec E-Go 2 for about a year and just recently died on me, well the ecu burn out.
So I figured I'll build my first E-Board.

What I did was recycle every working part of the Yuneec E-Go 2 and I am going to use it in order to make my e-boar. So here is what I have so far.

Parts:

Board = Yuneec E-Go 2 I sprayed painted it Green :D
Trunks from the Yuneec sprayed painted White :D
Wheels = Yuneec wheels I believe they are 83mm
Remote = Yuneec remote, but I dont know if I will actually be able to use it. Need some help there
Motor  = I need some help here I need a motor that can do At least 20 Mp! no less  :D and I would love to use the Yuneec Motor encase which its really nice, so the motor has to fit in there, I'll upload pictures of the enclosure.
Vesc & esc = Dont know what route to take would love some recomendations
Battery = I need something that would give me some good range about 7 to 15 Miles would be ideal. Im about 160 pounds.

Motor Enclosure that I would like to use : <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/1/01a117599380e713ecabe35d78ca7115ee2f7934.JPG" width="690" height="460">

Remote Control:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/7/279616c3c321a680e346718351467a4108bbf3b8.JPG" width="333" height="500">

Board Yuneec Will look better after I apply some more paint :D : <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/7/97a70de908b07af798cc4171e49f996723f4a3ed.JPG" width="690" height="460">

Is something wrong with the current motor?
If there is nothing wrong with it you can probably just up the voltage of the batteries to get desired speed. It would be really helpful if you knew the kv of the existing motor.

```
you'll have a 10s system soooooo
 10 x 4.2 x 7 x 0.95 x (motor kv) = (not over 60,000)
 
Max kv = 200
I'd recommend a 6364 190kv motor (make sure it is 14 poles not 18)

Okay so I ended up buying these batteries 2X Zippy 5000mAh 3S 11.1V 20C 30C Lipo Battery Pack Flightmax HXT 4mm Bullet Plane: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/2/f2ec4a2a2bc39c27298056dec39487f2ace889ad.jpg" width="500" height="366">

And this VESC: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/9/599b34640f1632d8f767e3f74fb676dce444884d.jpg" width="666" height="500">
3-12 cell lipo (8v-60v)
5v 1.5A output for reciever and any other small electronics
DC brushed motors work!
Sensored and sensorless PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN USING SENSORLESS/FOC CONTROL, AS INCORRECT SETTINGS MAY DAMAGE THE PRODUCT
Can monitor motor RPM (great for RC cars!)
Can be controlled with : PPM signal (RC reciever/transmitter), analog, UART, I2C(Wii-nunchuck), USB or CAN‚Äêbus. 
protection against High/Low Input/Output Voltage AND Current
When these limits are hit a soft back off strategy is used to save the VESC

Will I have any issues with this Vesc??
