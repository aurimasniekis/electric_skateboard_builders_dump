I designed a 3d printed ESC enclosure to fit my cheap dual ESC perfectly (it's not quite done yet) I haven't printed yet (at work today unfortunately) but this is the last piece I need to complete my build so hopefully I'll print it tonight (shoutout if you recognize the character on the lid) ![Screenshot_2019-04-07-11-51-51~2|501x500](upload://fuU1o7SGHPFHo7l6ZUvQDfKLLFb.png)
