Hey guys !

After my initial Ownboard W1S conversion build failed (sort of :laughing:) I began looking for more parts to build a total DIY build :+1:

And here I present to you my own Foosted build :sunny: 

- Vanguard Clone deck
- Flipsky 6354 motors
- VESC 4.2 + loop key
- Samsung 30Q 10s3p 9.0ah battery kit from Ownboard
- Ownboard W2 ESC + battery enclosure (plastic)
- Caliber 2 Trucks
- @Boardnamics 63mm mounts with idler
- Orangatang Nipples Bushing (Purple)
- 97mm 78a Flywheel Clones
- Flipsky VX1 remote
- Crappy grip tape :smile:

Ever since I saw the Foosted build from @SkateMetric, I always wanted to build one myself but unfortunately the shipping from loaded for their Caguama wheels and Vanguard deck is pretty expensive from where I am located, so I opted for slightly less premium parts from China.

I still own my Onwboard W1S but man, this belt driven board is much nicer to ride and also the Vanguard clone albeit not the same as the real deal, it does performs much better than the generic Chinese deck used by Ownboard :slight_smile: 

97mm wheel + the Vanguard clone reduces the on the road vibrations a **WHOLE** lot and riding over cobblestone + visually impaired guidelines on pathway is never the same :blush:

Overall I am really satisfied with this build and I really hope the stuffs won't breakdown so soon :sweat_smile::sweat_smile::sweat_smile:

Feel free to ask me anything about the build and I will share my knowledge with you :love_you_gesture:

Love seeing inspired builders from prebuilt boards. I had a meepo V1 that is now an entirely DIY board where I also went for the boosted clone look.

The ESC isn't from Ownboard, I use the Flipsky 4.20 Dual VESC :slight_smile:

As for the enclosures, I just engage them in Taobao and ask if they sell it, and they do :slight_smile:

Got them before the W2 official launch too :+1:

Thanks @Meeep :smiley: appreciate that :+1:

My initial plan was to only convert the W1S to a belt driven one (that was way before the new W2 is a thing) but things didn't turn out to be in my favor so I opted for DIY :smiley:

Oh hello, I'm planning to order parts from taobao to build my first board. Could you provide me some link to buy motor mount ? I'm gonna using the caliber trucks but could not find any mounts in pair at taobao, just single one :frowning:

Yeap, that's the new W2 battery :slight_smile: range has been pretty good for my first range test :smiley:

Got to ride around 15 km with 55% battery left :open_mouth:

So you get the W2 battery and enclosures directly from them? Is it plastic or metal like their previous cases?

Edit: oops nvm saw you wrote plastic

Yea got them direct from Ownboard's taobao store :slight_smile:
Enclosure is plastic but they do flex a little, should be able to take some knocks :+1:

I got mine for USD$ 290 from them, they don't have a listing on the newer parts as they're not active in Taobao :neutral_face:

Yea bro, just ask and they can customise the order :+1:

In Taobao you can message the seller, and it's more flexible too so there's that :slight_smile:

I just got the enclosures alone, thought of buying the ESC together but worried that it won't work for the Flipsky motors so I decided to go with vesc instead :wink:

Thanks! I have a unity but was thinking of swapping to the W2 ESC because it’s giving me problems.

You mean the unity is giving you issues?
I've always only heard praises about the unity, what's wrong with yours?

I don’t know if it’s faulty or if my settings are wrong or what’s going on. It’s just not smooth. It’s jerky and threw me off yesterday fully dislocating my arm from my shoulder.

That's odd, I am running VESC and the acceleration and deceleration is as smooth as my W1S's Hobbywing ESC (which was used in the W2 as well) :thinking:

Unity is base on the VESC as well right?

That’s what I wanted. I had a W1S and sold it to make this DIY board. It’s way too much torque and jerks when it’s starting or increasing speed which is dangerous. Like if I’m coasting and want to start going again it almost throws me off my board

I still have my W1S and I rode it once in a while, other than the motor sound and the flexy deck, not much of a different there is with my DIY board to be honest :slight_smile: 

I am using 28 for motor max/min and 22 for batt max/min, the rest are all default  during setup on VESC tool :+1:

Oh yeah I had 60 for my motor min/max so maybe I just need to turn it down

That's the default value, so just tone it down to <30 amp and it should be ok :slight_smile:
