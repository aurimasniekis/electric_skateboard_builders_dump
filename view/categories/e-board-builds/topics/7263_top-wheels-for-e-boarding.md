I'm currenly looking into a few wheels:

* [Orangatang kegel 80mm 80/83a](https://www.sickboards.nl/en/wheels/4737-orangatang-kegel-80mm-wheels.html)
* [Abec11 Flywheels 83mm wheels 75a, 78a, 81a]((https://www.sickboards.nl/en/downhill-wheels/34-abec11-flywheels-83-mm-wheels.html))
* [Enertion power wheels 83mm 80a](https://eu.electric-skateboard.market/product/enertion-power-wheels/) 

Do you have experiance with one of these ? Please tell us what you found was good/bad about them.
If you have some other wheels, feel free to inform us about them too.

Regards :wink: !

The Orangatang kegel is a fine wheel. Rides pretty smoothly.

I personally felt like the enertion power wheel is too hard of a duro. Sometimes, I felt like questioning "Am I riding my normal board or a long board?", cause the road vibrations go right through them to your board and thus your feet.

The Abec 11 on the other hand is a dream wheel. I felt like I was riding on clouds lol. It's upper smooth and nice to ride.

Wishing* my Raptor came with the softer Abec's (or if this had been an option at checkout). Which density Flywheels are you using/do you recommend, the 75a/78a/81a's?

78a seems pretty low, what is the lowest duro meter you'll go ? 
Cause I'd think that a lower durometer = less stability on higher speeds ? (or more since you'll glide better over pebbles etc?)

those have thicker spokes which wont work with most abec pulleys unless you file it down. Compare to the real deal.

usually your pulley will determine your wheel (if you have a pulley already).

I typically prefer the Abec Flywheel and clones - simply for flexibility.  Able to run 76-83-90-97 all w/ the same wheel gear!

I have both the clone 83's on GF's board, and ran the legit flywheel 97's.  I feel like the clones are a bit harder duro, but not by much.  Breaking them in they ride great.  I have some kegels too and should have some gears for them to try and compare.  

Duro is only part of the equation - size of wheels makes a huge difference depending on the surfaces you plan to skate (super smooth or rough/cracks/beat-to-crap roads).  Good shock pads or risers and setting up with correct bushings (for your weight) all help!

GL!

90mm 78A Flywheels. Definitely the "real deal". Can't beat em'

80/83mm wheels are fine for shorter rides and shorter pavement, but if you ride for hours and have a little more varied terrain, I rec going with 90's. They damp the vibrations a little more and can handle little rocks and bumps better. Expansion joints too.

Yea 90's seem to be ideal for what I want, but I like the contact patch of the 83mm evolves too much to give them up.

I ride 80a kegels and think that they could be much smoother, but i think i´m the only one with that opinion because i´m too spoiled of my 77a Cult Traction Beams <3 which i used before i turned my board into an esk8.

@elkick offers [these blankwheels](http://www.hellray.de/shop/#!/Blank-Wheels-83mm-78A-4-Stück-rot/p/62013093/category=19261571) in his Germany based shop but they are currently out of stock and shipping is € 8,50 extra but still cheaper than flywheels though. Maybe he can tell you, if they will be restocked soon.

agree with @Nordle - bigger is better.  The only downside is weight.  Those 97's are heavy suckers...  I have a set of the 107mm electric flywheels i'm trying to see if i can squeeze onto my next build... they are massive and heavy!

but on 97's rolling over cracks, bumps, small children, potholes, etc... so nice and smooth!  ;)

gear down!  bigger wheels will give you more top speed and less low-end torque.  So gear down on your motor 13/14t and largest pulley you can find for your wheel (i'm going to try DIYes 40t offering).

GL!

The Evolve GT runs great with plenty of torque on 97mm's and a 32T pulley. I'm not sure how they do it, but I'm willing to bet it isn't good for the battery!

Yeah, i'm *eventually* going to get a 100mm wheel for my Marbel - with 32t gear and 50mm motor...  probably won't get anywhere fast to start, but once rolling it'll be nice for rougher rides!

I just ordered these through ebay: ABEC 11 83mm 75a Flywheels. I heard they're one of the more popular options and in 75a are nice and soft. They're also what Enertion uses "clones" of on their Raptors builds. These ones are the originals:
