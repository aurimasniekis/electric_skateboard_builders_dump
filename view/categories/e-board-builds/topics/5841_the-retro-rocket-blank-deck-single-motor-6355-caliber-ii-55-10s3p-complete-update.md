Hello Everyone, 

This built is now complete, but I still want to make a recap about the process, 

1- Choosing the right Deck. 
 
At first, I wasn't really sure about the style I was looking for. So I found a pretty nice web site who where selling wholesale blank deck, ( http://www.skateshred.com/index.php/wholesale-blank-longboard-decks.html ), and I decide to bought 3 deck to see what will be my best option.

At first, I have fall in love with the DropTrough and did my best to set it up right. I use some Original 83mm Flywheels and 55 Caliber II (purple satin for the style), and original gripe tape Job.

But when I finally receive the Motor Mount, I realize that they are to short and it would be pretty hard to put the motor in back of the deck. And because I had already fabricate the Fiberglas enclosure, I was left with only one choice, The KickTail, and I think that maybe for the best.

2- The Enclosure 

Like I said previously, I have choose to make my own Fiberglas enclosure, for the pleasure to get my hand dirty, and try something completely new to me.

I'm still not 100% satisfy with the final product, and will probably work on a new version over the next weeks. The new design, will probably get a bit more height, for clearance, and also more angle and curve to be more stylish.

3- Battery And Electronics 

I don't have a lot to say about the battery, other than it's a modify pack from DiyElectricSkateboard ( In fact I have only use the cell from the pack), with a custom hightech BMS, that can use a momentary switch. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a6f4c8ea5a185d024a53469f5b6f6a01d7f49843.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/1555532eb99211c875e90303a628c74795f2d588.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/cf9d739cfa17e1090dc18033c7ace54cc25efd4e.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f9b990ccf88559f6d8e32892b4aeac5c2cb5d197.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f33b2147616083860e48ae6f1653fad8ec8f7dc9.jpg" width="375" height="500">

The Battery display is the same that plenty of people use ( http://www.ebay.ca/itm/12V-24v-36V-48V-Lead-acid-Lithium-Indicator-Battery-capacity-Tester-volt-meter-/172018886570?hash=item280d1fe7aa:g:np0AAOSwcBhWYWik ), but with a different package ( http://www.ebay.ca/itm/12v-24V-36v-48v-Acid-lead-indicator-Lithium-Battery-capacity-digital-voltmeter-/181965846894?hash=item2a5e02796e:g:UKUAAOSwSHZWc-bq ), that is easier to mount without any screw.

and the other electronic are VESC VESC VESC VESC VESC VESC nothing else to say.

4- Mechanic, most of the parts in this section will change over the next week, I'm still waiting on for some part to upgrade everything.

The Motor is a 6355 230kv from DiyElectricSkateboard, it working pretty fine, for a motor with a missing part on one of the magnet. And I know in some picture you see a 5065 170kv (again from TorqueBoard), but I burn it in the first 10km, so Now it the 6355. 

The Belt is a 265mm (9mm wide), and the pulley are 15T 36T. I din't have many choice for the gear ratio, because the motor mount from Psychotiller was a bit to short for the 265mm belt, and I have to shift everything to make it work with the only belt size I had.

5- In conclusion some picture of the not so final product.

What brand of BMS is it that uses a momentary switch?

The bms is the beta version of the bms in my build, still work in progress and to be production ready.

@Namasaki Like @Blasto said, this is still a prototype, so it has no brand on it, for now... @kyo Like a regular switch, it the BMS who does the magic. :tophat::sparkles:

Do you not have to balance those batteries?

A "battery management system" it balances the batteries for you. Like a balance charger but easier in a sense. Look it up on google.

Yes, @jrpwit and @PLEB  the BMS is use to balance the battery, and **protecting** the VESC from direct current of the battery (because it's not a cheap chinese product). And on this particular model, also give the opportunity to use a momentary switch and 12v output.
