Alright lads time to rebuild this fucker that snapped on me

I have no money for 2 boards (carve + speed) so this will be a carve + speed board (40+) using evolve trucks. I have been building/repairing/riding other people's board for months now and I haven't really gotten to rebuilding my broken board. But that changes now, as of now there's no board that I ride daily that can make me feel uncomfortable at top speed and full throttle. So I'm going to build one that can hopefully not make me full throttle my whole trip to school. Shoutout to my NYC guys who want to race all the time!

Its called a meepo v3 because its weak and it has nearly no power.

Parts list:
Hummie wood and carbon deck (Thanks @Hummie )
13s6p
Sixshooters (the one and only @psychotiller 
2x Flipsky 6.6
Old beatened up evolve trucks (Someone send me new ones so this board can look nice :wink:)
Dual 6374s 192kv (@scepterr) Hopefully he comes back someday 
Doublestack enclosure from the man (@bigben)
Custom cnced motor mounts by my not so secret santa/santee from 2017 @JohnA
16/60 gearing (for now)
Some rave lights, thanks @ju_mpe_r for creating synchronized lighting

Pics will come later on, wasn't even going to make a build log but why not right?

Haha yeah, I loved that deck, the hummie deck is a lot more flexy than the kiss of death on evolve trucks.

You still around? We should ride sometime :smile:
