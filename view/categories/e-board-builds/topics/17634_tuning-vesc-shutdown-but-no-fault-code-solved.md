Well guys the motor arrived last night. It kinda sucks having such a beautiful thing just sitting on the table awaiting its companions. If everything goes as planned, all parts will be in house a week from today. The only part I haven't received a shipping notice for is the VESC from @chaka. Hopefully soon!

Wiring looks good. But I'm assuming you'll cut it all to length when you're soldering on the right connections?

I had the exact same setup on V1 of my first board. After one test ride I ordered two more of those batteries. Really needed that extra range.

Everything has finally arrived and the board is together. I made a few test runs today and was happy to finally be riding. However, I have a few concerns. 

6S (2x5000mAh 30-40c Lipo)
VESC
245 kv Tacon 160 63mm

Concerns:
1) Batteries at full charge and the range was about 3 Miles.
2) Acceleration was pleasant but with any hill the board would struggle greatly.
3) Braking above 12mph was nearly impossible and felt as if no brakes were present.


Current VESC settings:

Current Limits
Motor Max: 45A
Motor Min (regen): -40A
Batt Max: 40
Batt Min (regen): -12
Absolute Max: 130A

Voltage Limits
Min input Voltage: 8.0V
Max input Voltage: 40.0V
Batt cutoff start: 21.0V
Batt cutoff end: 19.8V

Any ideas or opinions on VESC settings?

Yea the motors are different indeed. Although I'm not quite sure if that matters. There will be a different torque and topspeed I suppose but dunno if the vesc parameters change when you change the motor. I believe only the motor detection part changes not the bldc tab.

```
if you change out the old motor to a new motor of the same model and type, you'll only need to run motor detection. 

If you change it out to a completely different motor, you'll want to tweak your settings more than that based on how it feels when you street test. 

A 5Ah 6S is only going to give you about 5-7 miles max, its barely more watt hours than an airplane freindly boosted (99wh) and if you're going fun speed, expect less than that.

I certainly don't want to change motors as this whole setup now has only about 7 miles on it. If the low range is all I can expect for this battery setup I am willing to add additional batteries. I would like to add to my current setup considering the money invested in what I currently have. What would you suggest?

You could double your range by going 6S 4P with two additional lipos if you can squeeze them onto your board. That would probably be the least expensive option. 10+ miles is a fun ride.

## \#22 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2017-03-14T13:06:38.308Z Reads: 149

you can do a few things to increase speed: 

- you could increase your voltage, which would require more lipos in series, a different BMS, possibly the same ESC depending on how far you go
- you could fiddle with your pulley ratios and find either bigger motor pulleys or smaller wheels pulleys or both, 
- get taller wheels
- get higher KV motors. At 6S you can run up to 270-300kv no problem. I ran NTM prop drive 270KVs for a long time. Great motors if you can find them. 
- some combination of all of the above

This is what I just rode with my setup, 2x3s 5000 mAh, and the vesc just hit the soft stop for voltage so I have maybe another 1/2 mile before I hit the hard stop.

Rode the board to work and back today so the upgrade to 8000mAh batteries certainly helped! I am happy with the range but would like a little more torque. Losing some top speed is fine being I currently max out at 21mph but rarely hit 19mph as it is. Would a gearing change help accomplish this?

You can get smaller diameter wheels. Going from 90mm to 83mm will drop 2 mph. You can also change to a 14T Drive gear or a 40T slave pulley. This would give you ~18 mph.  All options will give you more torque. @SolidSurfer sells some 14T gears and probably the cheapest option.

Can go 83mm to 76mm which will also drop 2 mph. 14T Drive gear and 40T slave pulley still stands. Oh forgot to mention you can do any combination of these for even more torque. Doing all three at once will drop your speed to ~15mph.

go 10s.
you can up your motor amps much more too and it gives way more low speed torque and acceleration at slower speeds.  i dont think anyone will balk if you do...160!!!  so they say on the vesc maker's forum.  

I've got a tacon160 without bearings you can have for 20$.  never used just sits here.  took it apart and lost the bearings.  also have a motor mount that goes with it I'll give you for 20 that's permanently attached to the hanger.  I'll post pics

the mount is the last one I have and maybe that 's a long shot that you'd want it but the motor is scratch-free and just has wax on it....designed the mount around the motor and cast it on.  mount still needs to be drilled and requires an exact belt and pulley combo.  Motor is as good as new just needs to be cleaned and the bearings and the tiny set screw for the shaft.  20 for either.  mount needs some sanding and smoothing too and it'd look nice

@flywithgriff. You don't need to change anything. 
Are your vesc settings still the same as above? If so all you need is to increase motor amps max from 45 to 75-80. That will give you more torque on the low end without sacrificing speed or spending $$

## \#44 Posted by: PXSS Posted at: 2017-04-04T03:12:18.031Z Reads: 125

```
Changing the max motor amps won't burn anything. 
The limit is the maximum amount of RMS cyrrent that goes into your motor. 

Your maximum battery power is:
40A * 22.2V = 888W

You can get this at full speed since your motor limit is higher than your battery limit. But lets say at 50% max rpm, you get:

22.2V * 0.5 * 45A = 499.5W
Voltage * (rpm/max rpm) * max motor amps = motor power

If your speed is even lower your max power is lowered even more. So to get more torque on the low end you need to increase motor amps. 

You should still be safe though, as you're not exceeding any battery or esc limits. The only thing to be careful with is the stupid amounts of acceleration you can get playing with this setting. You should also have enough buffer between it and absolute current for any transients

E: @flywithgriff if you make any of the changes suggested by others, your board will still be sluggish up hills since it's limited in software not hardware...

## \#60 Posted by: PXSS Posted at: 2017-04-30T03:17:40.607Z Reads: 74

Low end torque is motor max not battery max. So you need to bump that higher.
I would increase it in steps of 5-10A and see what you like. Again, I would not go past 120A

As far as brakes go, same thing. At low speeds, you need to adjust motor min and at high speeds battery min.
Your battery can handle up to 5C charge according to the specs but I would limit it to 3C at most...
That translates to 24A, which is a lot imo. Same as above, start at 12 and slowly increase it to 15, 18, 21, 24 until you get to where you like.

Same thing with motor min, you can go as low as -120 but I like mine at -60, play with it and see what feels good for you

It felt much better, both take off and brakes! But about 300 yds into the ride and after braking down a short hill the brakes seemed to get less effective and when I throttled again it as well seemed much less. I again got on the brakes for about 3 seconds and it just quit all together. I let it sit for a minute and it started right back up but still subdued before stopping again. I left the board powered on and plugged it into BLDC but don't see any errors.

if you could log what's happening maybe even you're overheating, but that would be strange considering it didnt happen before.   I can't think of anything else.  and all you did was up the motor amps?

dropped motor min and batt min. Only noticed decreased braking. However, same issue as last time. Decreased performance and then cut out.

Where is the command window for checking fault?

Terminal tab almost all the way to the right. 

Lets try to determine what created the fault. Set your brake settings back to what they were and leave the torque stuff high. 

If no issues then increase your battery min. If no issues then increase you motor min. 

This way we can pinpoint to where the issue is

Reduced some settings and it took longer to stop working but brakes back to the original barely braking. I hit the soft shutdown and it took a little longer but still shut down completely.  Maybe the 97's are just to much to sustain?

OK! Much better finally. Board still seemed to hit a soft shutoff. After cruising a few hundred feet and using the brakes it seemed as if each time i applied throttle it was much less significant than the beginning of the ride. Im fully aware of the sensation of torque in relation to current speed and i am positive this is not the case.

When you go to larger wheels you're changing gear ratio. You want get the most reduction I would say for 97mm you want 15/40 minimum or 14/40. If you want to increase speed you should increase voltage.

What is your current setup? Wheels/pulleys/kv/voltage/top speed

97mm, 15/36, 245kv, 6s2p, top speed unknown yet.

board seems to perform the same as it did with the 16/36 on 83mm which im ok with but have to solve the shut down issue.

If you weren't having issues with 83mm 16/36, 15/40 on 97mm might help. If you had issues before it may be the voltage is to low and kv to high for a vesc.

I had zero problems with the 83mm set up. Just needed more torque. I'm perfectly ok with a top speed of 18mph if it means low end torque and a bit better hill climbing. Would one of your 40T help?

It will help with torque. Im not sure if it will solve your problems completely, but it should be very similar to how it was with 83mm wheels and 16l36

Was your board charged? Were you able to get it to shut off again?
I'm thinking you might be hitting your low voltage cutoff as you hit throttle again and again

Can you post a screenshot of the realtime tab

The problem started while the board was fully charged.  I have gotten it to shut down each test ride, but cannot get a fault to come up on BLDC. Forgive my ignorance of the realtime tab but what exactly are you asking for?

COULD MY VESC BE SHUTTING DOWN BECAUSE MY BATTERY WIRES ARE TOO LONG??

My build has separate enclosures and the 10 AWG cables are about 20" long. Could this be a problem with overheating?

Is everything shutting down or the vesc just had a red light flashing... if the vesc and everything shut down. You problem probably something else than the vesc... actually I belive it most likely to be tour E-switch.

It's never a sudden shutdown. It always starts strong and then performance decreases like I'm hitting a soft shutdown and if I keep riding I get a shutdown. When that happens if I just stop for about 5 seconds the board come right back to life and cycles again.

I'm trying to figure why I would be getting a shutdown but not having a fault code on the vesc. The only thing that I have changed as far as my setup that was working fine is as follows.

83mm wheels up to 97mm wheels
Motor gear from 16 down to 15
Battery wires extended to 20"
Replaced motor wires with 10 AWG

There 3 reason you will have no faults on a vesc, first when the vesc shutdown for low voltage, second when the maximum input voltage is way over the, third when there is no faults... so if you don't have any fault problem is somewhere else...

That certainly makes sense!  

If the batteries are being drained at a rate that is to high would that not explain the decreased power that eventually shuts the vesc off? Would it make sense that the batteries become unstrained when the vesc shuts down which allows them to basically reset for another run?

UPDATE:

I have just plugged up my board for charging and the cells are at 3.7v. I have put less than a mile and a half range on the packs since full charge. With the power problems and such a short range on an entire battery cycle would it be safe to say amp draw could be my problem?

Amp draw could definitely be a problem - but it may also be the efficiency of your system. How tight is your belt? How well aligned is your system? I redid an old mountainboard recently and had to switch to street wheels for testing bc the large rubber wheels with a slight wobble in the gear got me 2 miles of range out of battery packs that normally push 8 or 9 on the drivetrain

Everything is lines up pretty well. The belt might be a tad bit on the tight side as well but nothing crazy. Im really thinking its the 97mm wheels that are killing me. Im charging the board right now and will be testing the setup with the 83mm to see what happens.

I did, still had shut down problems. I have changed it to a 15/36 with 83mm wheels and it is performing much better. This is the exact setup I was running before I extended the battery wires and had zero problems. I'm not sure if I'm now experiencing a voltage sag/ low power problem or what the downfall is but I do know it's caused by the lengthened wires from the battery to the VESC. I rode several miles this weekend and only had an issue while running full throttle for an extended period of time. As long as I ride around half power and don't brake too aggressively I have no issues.
