Hi! I am very interested in getting a custom electronic board. Just wondering if theres anyone that provides services for making a custom board, preferably in Australia? I am not very confident in myself to make a board from scratch to be honest, any help is much appreciated. Thanks!

@longhairedboy makes amazing boards (owning one of his creations is on my bucket list) but I'm unsure if he still won't do international shipping. Perhaps he can answer if international shipping is worth the hassle.

You can get what you want. Check out his site:

Psychotiller is another great name on the ESK8 Hall of Fame.

my advice: buy a 2nd hand custom board and learn about it. As soon as all the parts look familiar to you and you spend a few days reading this forum you will be able to make your own very easily. Just by taking care of maintenance and small repairs you will learn a lot. If you have cash enough a lhb or psychotiller's are a great choice of course.

I will ship over seas but i cannot honor my warranty when i do. It generally costs a few hundred dollars to ship those kinds of watt hours over seas when you don't do the volume to have a nice DHL contract. 

So because i can't honor my warranty i generally allow it to be believed that i won't do it. Because i prefer not to be in a situation where i can't fix one of my own boards, and i'd rather not have anyone else in there but me, despite using the same tech basically everyone in the DIY community has available to them. 

Enertion, ArcBoards and a few other people network and get DIYers and skate shops to fix thier boards over seas. Maybe i'll do that one day but the shipping will still be a fuckton. It cost $400 to ship a 650 watt hour board to the UK the last time i did it, and i'm about to ship one to Austrailia in the next couple of weeks. Neither of those boards will i ever see again and that bothers me.

I'm from Sydney, Australia and have some experience in building DIY boards (I have two DIY builds and one modified evolve bamboo gt). I'm no pro but it is just takes time to read up from other geniuses here and other youtube videos. 

The important thing to do when living in Australia, so far from the suppliers is really be sure about your setup. The last thing you want to do is buy way more parts then you need to or buy things you don't need. So figure out exactly what you want eg. (single or dual, commuter or weekend warrior, distance needs, etc) As much as you want everything! You don't always need it.

@shong96 check them out. Yes, the both make complete custom esk8s. Pls read through both websites before you ask further questions (i.e. is the board stiff?, do they make batteries?)... all of that info is on their websites :slight_smile:

why not just get a Raptor 2? easy enough to move the whole system onto a different deck.

Not really a huge fan of the hub motors to be honest. Maintenance and replacing those urethane tires might be a bitch.

battery packs. I kinda know what type of set up I'm after. Do you know how to make a battery pack? Planning to go for a 10s4p pack

Honestly I'm contemplating buying a evolve bamboo GTX. Doesn't require the hassle of building everything. But just worried about the battery sag and overall quality of the board. Do you know any other good alternatives other than boosted?

You've just described a Metroboard, or a mb on a custom deck that you send them

Yeah I agree with @Mikenopolis. You will get best of both worlds with the Raptor 2. A kickass quick prebuilt. With the ability to tweak and DIY if you choose so. 
Evolve Bamboo and GTX are great boards. I have done around 1000km on mine and love it. Plus the local aussie supplier (as are enertion) for all your support questions and spare parts makes it super convenient. The truth is all boards have battery sag and there will be the odd lemon board. But overall so much better than the real cheap esk8s coming out from other brands.

I'm eying the raptor 2 as well. But just worried about the hub motor. How often do I need to replace those urathane wheels?

I'm not going to be a crazy enthusiast with these I reckon. Will probably just use these boards for transport around Melbourne.

I have a Boosted. You might be disappointed in it once you try a diy, Raptor 1/2, Evolve. Itâ€™s a good board but itâ€™s  amazing how short 7 miles becomes when having fun. 

Iâ€™m sure someone here will take those Raptor 2 hubs and give you a belt drive to swap on quick and even guide you into making it work. DIY is pretty simple if you want to get into it

Yea. Agreed. Wouldn't want to be charging the board twice a day. I'm considering getting a DIY kit from . Looks pretty decent. Takes out all the confusion from the build since everything is included. Except a on off switch. I guess I could get one from antisparm heaven and just install it between the battery and vesc. You think it's a good idea?

You'll have to set the correct settings and do motor detection on the VESC before using it. It's not that hard though, there are good guides out there.
