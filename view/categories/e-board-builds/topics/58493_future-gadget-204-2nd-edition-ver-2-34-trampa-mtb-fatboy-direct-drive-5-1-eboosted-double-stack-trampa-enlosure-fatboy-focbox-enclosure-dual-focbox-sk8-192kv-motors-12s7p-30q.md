First build! Coming from a boosted, I wanted to get tires and bindings so I feel more "secure" especially on the roads of NYC. I could get a Kaly but I figured if I'm spending that much money I could instead invest in learning how to build one. Plus when you DIY, "you are the warrranty."

Let me know if I'm doing/about to do any rookie mistakes!

**Current State**

Custom grip tape job while I wait for other parts. I wanted to differentiate myself from the usual hexagon grip tape patterns I see on the Kaly's here in NYC.

Trying to see how much of the grip tape my bindings + battery box will cover. Sadly a lot. Seriously thinking of switching to bottom mount.

Focbox case arrived so I mounted them. Goes well with the subtle red on my wheel hubs. Maybe I should have gotten red bearings and/or red spokes too?

![20180608_044509|281x500](upload://5aINKv7uYnn2WFjtffPN6Ar1bLq.jpg)
Because of slight variations on trampa's manufacturing, one side of the axle is slightly fatter than the other so the drive baseplate doesn't go all the way in. Notice in the picture that there isn't enough space for another bearing, let alone the nut. I had to use a hammer to forcefully slide the baseplate in.

![20180610_233958|690x388](upload://1UUD3jvND7D7l74QIgTIhh8yQ18.jpg)
Got the direct drive and motors. Really need to do something about that sk8 blue. Anyone have ideas on how to tone it down/black it out without affecting heat dispersion?

@never4getf150forums I'm considering that, but I'm afraid of removing too much material and damaging the shell. Also weight differences might occur and could potentially affect the motors rotational stability. That or I'm just worrying too much

@JonathanLau1983 that's the easiest and safest solution for sure. It's more controlled compared to using spray paint, and it dries quickly.

I can’t quote you on the price. But it’s comparable to other offerings. But the hanger is a part of the kit (I believe). So you’re not paying more. Also, the precision hanger ensures an exact fit, which is something you can’t get on a cast hanger.

So for anyone unfamiliar with direct drives and Trampa hangers, a few pieces of information:

1. Trampa's components aren't always "to spec". Parts coming from Trampa can be a few microns thicker or thinner, hence things like the notorious wheel wobble caused by hubs not seating the bearings flush. This is the root cause of the whole hangar fiasco.
2. There are three vendors of direct drives (so far). Kaly (Kaly drive?), Kug3lis (FatBoy drive) and NoWind(Etoxx drive).
3. To deal with the manufacturing variations, each vendor has their own solution: Kaly drives come with his own CNC'd hangar (not from trampa) by default, etoxx drives have the option to send in your existing trampa hangar for machining or buy one from them to go with your drive, FatBoy drives come "as is" and it's up to you to fit them on your hangar (any of you correct me if I'm wrong, this is me speaking from my own and other's experience)

tl;dr trampa hangers are a pain so drive vendors/users have to deal with them

The ATB 5:1 drives are self fit no machining and not sure if 3DServisas will offer them again @Kug3lis

They also offer a mini 3:1 drive where you send in a hanger, tbh probably the best route

This is the reason for a 100% CNC made hanger. 

 The original hanger is made of cast aluminum and has a lot of imperfections, that makes it hard to properly align a belt drive and much less Gear Drive. 

Also the fabrication is inconsistent causing all original hangers to be different which makes it really hard to install a precision device on the it. 

But more important is that the cast aluminum tent to brake under normal conditions if use in the back position, where is subject to big stress and that is just unacceptable. 

Maybe this will clear it up.

Update: Just finished a working remote! Hooked it up to a receiver with a servo attached to it (which works out since ppm control on an esc is essentially servo control) and it works! I'm probably going to make a new one though since I did a lot of mistakes on this first attempt, most notably messing up the threading on the screw nearest the palm and forgetting to replace the resistor on the charge board so it doesn't charge the battery at 1 amp (too much current for the lipo). Plus now that I have a better idea of where components are and how they're connected I can do a better job at cable management.

Hi everyone,

Got my batteries in and I'm starting to figure out how to put the electronics together. This is where I need some help from the community.

I'm using @Eboosted's double stack enclosure and I'll be fitting my 12s8p along with the BMS inside it. Focboxes are externally mounted.

General layout is as follows:

 ![20180625_153256|690x388](upload://78Fjcxn2VfKjS00hah0qmqakbed.jpg)

Series connections will be done using two 12awg wires. Balance connectors (not drawn) will be in the middle.

A column of batteries from that layout would look like this:

![20180625_131448|690x388](upload://S2cJLaxr8UShKVuGJjGzVpulxv.jpg) 

If this were the column of batteries nearest the BMS, the left 8p group would be the 1st cell in the series and the right 8p group would be the 12th cell.

I plan on using a bus bar (probably a charging PCB) + nickel strips for each 4p side of a cell and add a layer of silicone between the two 4p layers like so:

![20180625_132327|690x388](upload://e4A3SLyZn61pCIlktSCZpB4BjVC.jpg)

Now here's where I need feedback. I have to ideas on how to connect the two 4p packs into an 8p pack:

![20180625_132049|690x388](upload://vhSGhTRUEXtKYV3TUbA4gt0efm.jpg)

The first idea is to wrap the exposed strips and terminals with an insulating layer (kapton, fish, or both) then connect the top and bottom bus bars with two flat wires. This preserves the flexibility of the nickel strip + bus bar combination in that when a single cell in a pack goes bad, I can just remove that cell and its nickel strip from the bus bar and replace it with a new one. No need to ruin the existing welds on the other cells.

![20180625_132206|690x388](upload://ohqlqqZX5pHKvX7vxtV54W750Ye.jpg)

The second idea is keeping it simple and just welding each cell from one layer to the corresponding one at the bottom. I feel like this has less points of failure, but when once cell ends up being bad I'll have to replace both that and the one it's attached to from the other layer.

So yeah. Any help is welcome. Also tell me if I'm doing anything wrong.
```

Edit: I like doubling up on .15 nickel strips for parallel connections. Then a single .2mm on each cell to connect to the pcb

So I rethought how I'd do my batteries. Instead of pcb's on the top and bottom of the enclosure I might do a sole bus bar with bent nickel strips separated by a film of kapton / fish paper. Each series cell will be connected from bus bar to bus bar using two 12awg wires. Any issues with this design? Vibrations? Current draw of 8p on a single bus bar? Temps?

Hey all,

I've been enjoying riding this thing too much that I've put off on updating my build thread. Anyway, here are the updates:

My original plan was to do a 12s8p top mount but @Eboosted just released a double stack version of his HS11 enclosure so that finally swayed me to do bottom mount. 

![20180711_210647|281x500](upload://gpKpGmMNF8XIHrBRaQ5t4YuTSXf.jpg)

The biggest problem I faced with this setup was the 150 amp bms that I already had. I figured if I cut off the heat sink a bit the pcb might still fit. 

![20180711_213709|690x388](upload://vHP08dvH8GTbl7rKayXx88qVbeq.jpg)

Battery building time. First I built the 4p packs

![20180715_215521|690x388](upload://ev6kVxkfskjJW5VjZXSTLzN5KMa.jpg)

I got a hold of some pcb's from @Kaly 

![20180719_212307|281x500](upload://bVg2mXdvMUiuA5kotAPL0wjdfz.jpg)

Test fitted them out on one of the 4p packs. I also took this time to build my 8p packs. I used Dow Corning 795 industrial strength silicone to bond two 4p packs as using silicone over hot glue helps with vibration dampening. At first I was skeptical when I was advised to use silicone, but shit is no joke, it's used to hold glass windows. 

![20180720_045933|690x388](upload://eRH9wd1PGCOlBgQYBdO6E2xqwnh.jpg)

If you saw my previous updates, I was trying to figure out how to build my 8p packs. Ended up being lazy and went the simple route. 

![20180721_204231|690x388](upload://G9945llSOTW1T6MMNwfXECun2b.jpg)

![20180721_204239|690x388](upload://kYE9IBCsdlv11zLKO1ZgC5bi2wq.jpg)

![20180721_204251|690x388](upload://a5ivv4xzMz9hxdtAuVRTbmjTJGu.jpg)

Test fitted them out on the enclosure then I hit my first snag. I've posted about this on his enclosure thread, but the imperfection within the inside walls of the enclosure ended up pushing my cells inward

![20180722_001948|690x388](upload://uucvEHCtpGRoGnHetZkD4SzovgX.jpg)

Ended up having to dremel a few mm to flatten the walls

![20180807_193700|690x388](upload://cVtGapv6mqnQe2ggg5hH2WVW5Nu.jpg)

I used some flat braided wire to make the series connections. I was debating on using this over two 12 gage wires but ended up with this for simplicity. 

![20180804_001350|281x500](upload://x0rn8jK8tgbOZl35UrEud1nR07B.jpg)

Now the balance cables. I used the channel on the side to route all of my balance cables. Looks cleaner that way plus it won't have the enclosure pressing against it compared to having them run on top of the cells.

Enclosure time. I was originally going to use @Kug3lis's top mounted dual focbox enclosure but he just released his evolve style bottom mount cooling plate, and me being myself jumped to try out the newest shiniest thing. 

![20180726_135953|690x388](upload://jKJJwsMyIqya6VGVXvucxsf7jqq.jpg)

To make the hole for the cooling plate, I took a piece of plastic (the more rigid ones, think uniqlo underwear packaging) and traced an outline that I then taped on the enclosure. 

![20180806_083238|690x388](upload://xduKq5rCln8Y9Hi9fP7uHEs5IJG.jpg)

After dremel-ing the hole I used sand paper to get a nice fit. 

![20180807_205804|690x388](upload://h6Vn0Xyv0UR8qwrVTOn52ldlkuL.jpg)

Once more, I used some silicone to glue the cooling plate in place. 

![20180807_220006|281x500](upload://aZYFmQm0kRvIjDgGnFFqARnggES.jpg)

Also, waterproofing. 

![20180808_002836|690x388](upload://gon27nxfuwiwY5GkV2guBJEvJnu.jpg)

Came out really clean

![20180807_215254|690x388](upload://qiVzzupSFsEvzn1IhWmeUFWE3in.jpg)

More waterproofing. 

![20180808_012412|690x388](upload://mGp2GRv3iXAFv5xqsupfVBsNhbV.jpg)

![20180808_012447|690x388](upload://jfJavNLSmOoiFjtEhMCYjyfSihV.jpg)

For the focbox wires, I used some rubber grommets.

![20180811_212716|690x388](upload://cJpnfBIEkmGLrLrGShcEeFyBnof.jpg)

To make sure the phase wires don't push in all the way when I insert the bullet connectors, I cut of some heat shrink off of the bullet connector, inserted the bullet connector through the grommet, and heat shrinked it again on the outside 

![20180816_001717|690x388](upload://sIulAnUMqDulvnka41RpkccVcF0.jpg)

![20180811_220645|690x388](upload://53KxGMbyg9SaRfRNxK50NRPidQQ.jpg)

Also a few parts got changed along the way. I bought a used @Kaly direct drive and a smaller 60 amp bms

Oh you might also be wondering why I have a stealth in the last picture even though I'm building a DIY and I already have an existing v2. Well I won it for free a few weeks back from the boosted summer showdown contest.

That's it! Thanks to everyone who made this build possible: @ARetardedPillow, @Kug3lis, @Kaly, @Eboosted, @Nate

Yeah, coming from a boosted, my body is not ready yet for this speed and acceleration. I was getting anxious when I was hitting the 30mph mark:

![20180901_030614|360x334](upload://1t5l1kfOD97LOPgOoroiN6Qjpxp.gif)

But damn, that was what, 70% duty cycle at 30mph? This thing can go so much faster if I had the balls to push it. In time, I guess. Plus I need to do something about the speed wobbles. Time to put on the dampas.

I think they're called x pin circular connectors (where x is the number of pins) but I'm not entirely sure. @kaly was the one who modified these cables so he might have a better answer for you.

DON'T DO 16 INSERTS PER SIDE.

Maybe swap out the motors for something more efficient. I was hoping to get at least 50 miles.

Use the dual escape instead of the dual focbox so I can push more amps. The escape has beefier hardware. They both come with the evolve style heat sink but my escape came in way too late.

Get precision hubs like the 3dservisas one or the six shooters. Trampa hubs wobble like a corgi butt. 

Get non ratchet bindings. It's easy to push in and mess up your bindings tightness when you lean the board against a wall. 

Instead of passing through the wires of the actual focbox, just use extensions so I can take the focboxes out of the enclosure without having to redoing the shrink wrap on the bullet connectors. Granted I don't really need to remove my focboxes that frequently.

Forgo the whole PCB thing and just use one wide nickel strip to weld together the 8p packs. Again makes things easier.

Do charge only from the start. 

Go 13s :wink:

What do you think of the upcoming Unity? A possibility or would it be better off going to VESC 6.6 dual or ESCape Dual?

I thought the same about the waterproofing thing but ultimately that many inserts is too excessive. 8 per side is plenty sufficient.

I haven't been following the unity development that much so I don't know what to expect from it, but just on hardware alone I would have gone with the escapes over the focboxes if I had the chance.

The Sk8's are fairly power hungry as mentioned by the previous owner of the ones I'm using currently. And with my 25wh/mi power usage I can agree. I have no experience with other motors of the same size (6374) but I'd like to believe that the smaller motors consume less energy than the bigger ones. They may not be as powerful, but I'm starting to think that I'd trade range for power.

I wish I can measure for you but I left the US for a 1 month vacation so I won't get you that info until after January. To give you an idea though it's a few mm lower than the hangar. So if you have an emtb already and your hangar gets dinged up from the road pretty bad maybe a double stack is too low for you. For me though it's been fine.

@neiru37 Yeah clearance, that would be also an interesting thing for me :).

I'm just preparing a very similar build, a double stacked enclosure from @eboosted is already on my house. 
However, this would be my first trampa eboard so I'm wondering about choosing a correct layers number. Could you suggest something ? I thought about 17ply because I don't want to damage an enclosure during flex. I weight ~80kg
