Hello

My name is Tom, I live in Poland and I like to design and build various inventions. :)
I would like to present your project Mountainboard with electric drive.
My English is poor, so I'll write a little, but instead will be a lot of pictures.

Cool looking board.. hate to say but I think your mount somewhat competes with the E-toxx mounts, in terms of looks and general construction.. 

I really like that ''roll cage'' look on this mount....
Im not sure how durable that PTGE is.. but I assume it is quite strong.. :)

## \#4 Posted by: Idea Posted at: 2016-12-07T08:47:54.890Z Reads: 650

It is similar, but a different design and construction. 
In addition, I used different materials and different processing technology than E-toxx.
My motor holder is made of stainless steel laser-cut and cross bar made of PETG printed on a 3D printer. My solution is a low-budget :)
Motor Holder made exclusively from PETG is not as durable as hybrid PETG and stainless steel.

The next version of the motor holder will be even more durable, PETG will be even less

I think you could 100% start selling these mounts at some point in time! They look awesome.. so if u have a couple of 3d printers in your workshop.. to keep busy all day printing motor brackets / braces.. then go on! :D 

---
Can you tell a bit more (with website links perhaps? ) about this PETG ?

This is what I found so far:
> PETG filament has the reputation of combining the benefits of ABS (stronger, temperature resistant, more durable) and PLA (easy to print) in one material.
> The layer adhesion is usually excellent.
> You can expect less trouble with warping or shrinking of your prints.
Source: https://all3dp.com/petg-filament-3d-printing/

So, I assume it is somewhere in between PLA (weaker) and ABS (stronger)  - in terms of strongness / durability.

---

Im also interested - what thickness of steel you have for the motor plate ? Im asking because Im having about the same thickness steel plate but I have not seen with my eyes.. does it bend or not.. perhaps you can comment on this..

--

If you dont understand some part of what im saying / asking, then you can tell! I will try to write the words in more simple way.

It is stainless steel with a thickness of 3mm. It is very rigid, hard to bend it.
Petg is a material highly resistant to impact. With PET perform are bottles of carbonated drinks.
PETG IS stronger than PLA or ABS, more like Nylon

Stainless steel and PETG I use for several months also motorholder for longboard.

Mud guards / fenders. Similar like bicycles have!

They should be mountable on the axles.. and not be in the way for the board when you turn..

---
This is not very nice looking but I think you will get the idea.. just need to mount them on an axle:

http://www.ebay.com/itm/Mini-Bike-Chopper-GoKart-MOTORCYCLE-Chrome-Fender-for-14-18-TALL-Tires/131471643583?_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851&_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIC.MBE%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D39107%26meid%3D0d9a4dfa8c724bdd8b132d6108371c03%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D161655875237

I think your clothes probably got dirty too.. at least mine gets.. when riding in wet conditions :D

That's really good idea, I think it would work great in central-European climate. Only problem in making those fenders universal would be that there are different kind of drivetrains out there and it would have to be mounted from threaded end of the axle.
```

## \#14 Posted by: Okami Posted at: 2016-12-10T22:41:57.578Z Reads: 475

Mh what's your idea about the place where to mount them?

In my opinion they should be mounted similar like motor's ar mounted.. I do agree, though, that for the drive wheel / s it is going to be harder to mount them.. unless the fender is mounted to the motor mount itself in a way.
```

## \#15 Posted by: squad Posted at: 2016-12-10T23:25:05.097Z Reads: 485

```
If "drop in" universal solution would be a priority I would see this as a monolithic piece with washer shaped mounting sufrace, that would go on the axle, between nut and outer bearing  then it would go up as a solid or lightened triangle shaped sideplate, it would protrude from outer side of the wheel to make clereance for inner tube valve (mounting washer part would be a vertex of this triangle), and then this sideplate would curve over wheel on top, to create a fender. I hope I wrote my idea clear enough.

@squad Got your idea about the mounting point. That does seem convenient to mount directly on axle.. 

I think we should sketch something up and come to some sort of design.for others to implement, try out or test.. 

Sort of like open source mountainboard fender project - design :D

--
I'd like to ride in wet road conditions but it is annoying that the feet get really wet, especially the front sides as they are sticking outside of board a little.. 

I can imagine that it would be possible to protect just the feet.. with some sort of guards.. but that would not solve the problem of water splashing everywhere else..if the protection / guards is for feet only.

From what you said I can imagine something like this:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/d/ed1099eefb238d4a3c3fc5a754a094cb807a0c58.jpg" width="690" height="478">


Of course it is a rather crude example as it is hard to make the curve in 2d workspace, but I hope that I got the mounting idea correct.. The curve and bend around the wheel could be modified / adjusted as needed.

I agree about the look similar to lunar vehicle.
Im sure that with some time spent designing and 3d printing it could be made into something good looking.

The first versions will of course look crude and not so attractive but the idea would be to use the fenders only when it is wet.

---

On the technical side of things - I wonder will it be enough to hold the fender just in with one mount point - wont the vibration be strong enough to shake the fender around too much.. though, only real life prototype / fender can probably prove how it would work..

----

Inspiration taken from this:

After driving 240 km consumption is low. I'm surprised, because the belt transmission operates in harsh environments.

I know what you think, the older version of the firmware has very sharp brakes.

In October I discussed many hours on skype with engineer Favourite Electronics.
I have [ESC 120A 12S (for aircraft)](http://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/zUkAAOSwu4BVklv1/s-l1600.jpg) and I wanted to use them in Mountainboard.

Engineer modified firmware according to my guidelines.
I was a tester :) , I checked various versions of the firmware received from the engineer Favourite Electronics.

Oct. 25 was created firmware-based Car80A120A_150728 (my favorite so I suggested his porting).
Car80A120A_150728 an older firmware with [ESC 120A 6S (for cars)](http://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/sZMAAOSwx2dYEmjn/s-l1600.jpg)).

Now I have excellent brakes and acceleration in my ESC 120A 12S (aircraft)

I spoke in December of Favourite Electronics and rumored [new ESC](http://www.szfvt.com/en/proshow-105-3-54-54-100-16-3.html)  for skateboard also improved brakes.

Hi Tom,
where did you buy the ESC? Are you happy with them?
Did you make the metallic enclosures or were they supplied by the vendor?

I did not remember the speed and range you gave at the beginning of the thread. That is very impressive with 8S. That could make me reconsider my build, where I intended to go with 10S. But if you buy Lipos you do not find many 5S to put in series, it's very often 4 or 6S. Do you confirm the speed and range you gave earlier (by experience)?
Thanks

I do not have aluminum casing. 
The firmware for skateboard is flashing me manufacturer, I sent esc to China.

Later I bought ESC FVT 120A 12S "Sleep Lion" in aluminum housing.
Unfortunately, the new ESC is bad for mountainboard, 

I made a movies comparing the older ESC type (which one I use) and the new ESC FVT Sleep Lion.

I reported the problem to the producer but this time he ignored me, so in a few days I will post on the forum videos showing the problem.

@Onester
"Sleep Lion" has a delay, so it is not suitable for Mountainboard. Mountainboard needs full power without delay, especially in difficult terrain.
The problem is also "take off", "Sleep Lion" has a small torque at startup.

I posted 4 videos showing the problem

1. Acceleration - "Sleep Lion 120A 12S"
https://youtu.be/adR-AoVFE0I

2. Acceleration - "FVT 120A 12S for plane, Firmware ported from the car version"
https://youtu.be/d2ww5g_CDyk

3. Start - "Sleep Lion 120A 12S" -  Low torque
https://youtu.be/om4OSAx_sWo

4.  Start - "FVT 120A 12S for plane, Firmware ported from the car version" - Good torque

In theory I am a beta tester.

The Dual ESC I bought was one of the first copies.

In my opinion, Favorite Electronics has good ESC but they have quality control problems.
The advantage is that they want to improve their products.

Hi ,
I'm Yann , new in this forum but not new in electric mountainboard builds.
I m tryinng different esc to get the best which will work perfectly on 12s lipo, sensored mode.
I got some Maytech 12s120a esc and twin 120a12s favourite from fvt.
I saw You get very good results with different cars firmware but it s difficult to know which firmware for which esc and where can we download it .
I m in contact with maytech and fvt to modify firmware and fix differents bugs as mentioned:
-Spin forward few ms after releasing breakes ( sensored mode)
-"electrical juice feedback "to power supply when braking in sensorless mode.

If you can tell me more about which firmware is the more reliable for you and where can i find it, it will be so goodüëçüëç

With fvt and maytech, it s hard to know who designed thise esc, who manufactures them and who is writting firmware and upgrades.
Each company is telling same thing about and i only got partial answers to my requests about firmware ( when they answer me....)

@jeorghe

That's true ... this mountainboard had many versions of motor mounts. 
Every next one is better, so it's Evolution :stuck_out_tongue:

Over the weekend I did the first real test, the ESCs are not as noisy as I thought and your motors holder  is perfect . :+1:

Maybe I have to add cooling fans ...

Two questions.
Is the ESC and the Software that you mentioned still the best or have you found a better combination?
What do you think about the "Alien Power System" ESC:s?
This is the best tread so far, Keep up the good work!

I still use old FVT 12S 120A with modified firmware.

![image|500x500](upload://a3K0iA3PwWOZMWagliCP5QzW8DL.jpg)

I thought that they would break down, therefore a year ago I bought as the FVT Sleep Lion reserve and additionally Ezrun Max 6, but old FVT are indestructible.

I know that VESC 6 is excellent, but FVT is a good cheap alternative if you can buy a tested ESC
The Favorite Electronics CO., LTD. has poor quality control and you can buy a faulty new ESC that will break down when you plug in the power supply (I've had 2 such cases from 20 purchased esc)

The only thing you have to get used to are brakes that are not as perfect as in VESC (have different characteristics),  but they inhibit effectively  :D

I did not use the Alien Power System ESC so I can not rate it

I also use FVT Sleep with lipo 10S and dual sensored Turnigy SK3 149KV motor and , as say Idea, is a very good controller for the price .
Also the brake work fine and you need to use high timing for best results.
Also some  capacitors on the middle of  power line is raccomanded for a nice smooth behaviour  ...

I bought on ebay. Later I got in touch with Favorite Electronics what., LTD. and firmware in the version Skateboard version flashing for me the producer (I sent ESC to China :)  )

When I received ESC from the producer with the new firmware it turned out that the brakes were dramatically (there was no smooth braking, the wheels blocked.) in addition, the start was delayed

That's when my cooperation with Favorite Electronics started, as a result of a short after 2 weeks I received a firmware with properly functioning brakes and a dynamic start. 

Later, the same firmware version went to ESC with the Maytech logo and in Sleep Lion  :D

So I have my small contribution to the development of firmware for skateboards. 
I did not modify the fiormware, I'm not a programmer, but I sent my comments and I did tests for Favorite Electronics

The truth is that the current firmware "Sleep Lion" is a modified firmware from the early version of ESC for the car :P
![image|500x500](upload://rUF9yYPHAJt4Gkl0DAK0MN6iXw.jpg)

After several attempts to modify the skateboard version, I asked the engineer to porting the firmware from this ESC

I have the alienpowersystem equivalent of the sleeping lion esc (http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/esc/alien-120a-2-12s-v4-factory-esc-hv/). It has the same programing software as the sleeping lion. I'm just, wondering what settings you are using because I have some issues with the timing of the motor.

Thanks!

Hello!
@Idea
I've been trying out the FVT 120A 5-12S ESC a little now. I've started with "Soft" acceleration, and 40% throttle limit in the software, so it is not so fast right now. However, I have a problem with it shutting off.

I am in sensorless, so when starting from standstill, the motors are "jiggeling" before start. Sometimes it dies then. It also dies when coming to steep hills.
It also dies if I brake hard, and then tries to accelerate afterwords.

The funny thing is that i have [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01BV3O79O/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) power analyzer between the battery and the ESC, and this also blacks out when this happens. I've tested without the poweranalyzer also, so that is not the problem.

Since the power analzer also blacks out, I am thinking that the ESC is sending big voltage spikes back to the battery, and in the proces turns itself off. I was thinking that bigger capacitors would fix it, but i would probably ruin the ESC if i started with this.

Do you, or anyone else have any experience with this?

Sorry for the long post.
Best regards.

I use 2 esc FTV 120A with a couple of 6374 SK3 149KV.
I had some problems like you at the beginning.
I can suggest you to set an high timing for the motors, it is very useful.
I had also the problem about hard braking.
You need to set brake at 100% and then limit the transmitter trigger (brake direction) mechanically or use dual rate if have it in the transmiter.
In this way I had no problems . 
Sorry for my english ...
