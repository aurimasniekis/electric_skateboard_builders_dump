Just got some of my parts for my first build. I am not sure if I will be able to use these motor mounts as I can‚Äôt get them to fit any other way. I could flip top plate and it would sit ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù but then the truck itself would be backwards. And I realize that the black trucks are different than the silver truck. Would I be able to make these work or just need to find some different mounts?![image|375x500](upload://eSWZ6LpjuDGl50nwAYR5O8BggpY.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://wDM2pZmCa6Gc26KHsz8L14vAUs0.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://p48qmoXLSUBBVeVpuIhjej5bhDL.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://jXpmPZJdthWkpYthnyhVJ3tJgQZ.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://pnVIlplPUvljwnCMjCF0918PZWt.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://eKbPtrxJa2K511GhNJ57UndWinS.jpeg)

are you trying to use the full atb mounts on the carver trucks?

See I couldn‚Äôt find these mounts anywhere so didn‚Äôt know what they were! I think the black ones are vertigo trucks from the trampa website but didn‚Äôt find the silver yet. I‚Äôm going to assume these mounts won‚Äôt work for the trucks from reading your comment though üò¢

Those mounts look like they are for the Carver mount with the hanger reversed/flipped for a shorter wheelbase, for use with smaller wheels...

well, the ATB mounts won't fit the carver trucks and vice versa. where did you buy these? maybe you can get some better help on the newer improved forum.

Those fit if the hanger is reversed(usually for thane) but will work fine for pneumatics.  it turns the same, is just a bit higher off the ground.

You can also swap out to the wider hangers and they will fit those too.
