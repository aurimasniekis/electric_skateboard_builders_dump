I am looking for a set of pulleys that will mount on MBS Hubs. Prefer 60T-72T and 15mm wide. I am in the US and would prefer to get them from the US to save on shipping and time.

Do they fit the same? I'm currently running Evolve wheels and pulleys.

Apparently Evolve Sells a bolt in pulley that fits MBS hubs.

The one I have is designed for the MBS RS2, I can't say for certain whether it's the same as the one you've linked above, I bought it before they came out w their G2 stuff. I can DM you a pic.

The link above, that's a plastic/ABS printed one.  If you want aluminum version of that at a reasonable price, I think @Kaly is your best bet.  His 62T pulley + 16T drive pulley and belt are $50. So may just the 62T pulley is about the same price as the evolve one but in aluminum.

@flywithgriff Hey did you end up buying the wheel pulley from evolve? And if you did was it 15mm width? And 5m pitch?
