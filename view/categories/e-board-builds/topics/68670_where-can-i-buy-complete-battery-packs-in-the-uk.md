I don't have a spot welder or the experience to make a pack, but I want to change my 10S5P Pack from diyeboards with poor quality cells into a 10s5p/10s6p 30Q or Sanyo pack. I may end up also needing a new enclosure for this, but would really rather not drill new holes into my evo. 

Thanks for any help :)

Looks like they sell lipos and they're a bit overpriced. I've seen 12S4P 30Q Used Lion packs sell for less than their Lipos, dispite the large disparities in the possible number of cycles on the packs. I could also most likely make a pack like that myself, considering its usually a little-no solider experience with just attaching a BMS

Yeah you right. They just have lipos.
Thought they make LiIon packs too.
Remember one guy was speaking about it...
So than just ignore my answer ðŸ˜œ

the li-ion packs are called 'Alien Power Pack' on the APS website:

I brought a 8S4P from APS a while back and it was a good battery pack.

@Acido is making custom packs for EU people I think.

I don't think that would fit an evo very well

Quite correct its made for the hummie deck which has a cut out and is too shallow for an evo let alone the wrong shape.  If you want an evo enclosure

 there can be only one

@bigben makes a killer Evo enclosure and he's based in the UK. Something to consider.

Hi, new to DIY, have ordered a Focbox Unity and a Loaded Vanguard, could you price a 10s4p with 80A BMS, deliver to London? What dimensions?

Cheers

Hey, he can do one shipped to us for about Â£313, which is a good deal IMO. I will probably be purchasing and if you're looking for a pack you might want to too!
