Hey all! I'm pretty new here so give me some grace if i don't know what I'm talking about:sweat_smile:
Now to get straight into it I have here a custom deck I made myself, it ain't perfect in any way (cause its my first) but I think it'll work for me now. I got the Cal II 44° RKP Longboard Trucks and they look damn dope to me on that board (not currently attached). Soooooo I'm looking to make into a electric skateboard, I've been researching a crap load that last few weeks and I'm quite overwhelmed tbh. Originally I was going to go all Mboard stuff but then I decided to do a quick search on here and found that they aren't the most reliable, so then I went on to see if I could find what I was looking for and there is a crap load of stuff out there and I'm not quite sure which is the best for me!?
So I just wanted share with ya'll my custom board and ask: I already have the board, trucks and wheels, can I do a decent build for around $500-$600? I want to do a single belt driven motor cause that will suit my needs plenty for now. Thanks to all that have read this far cause it's kinda long:joy: And thanks for any help!

Add mounts from @Boardnamics
Maybe use a flipsky plus vesc

@Boardnamics motor mount 25$, for motors get a 6374  buildkitboard from @JLabs 140$, get a single vesc from @torqueboards 85$,and a battery you can get from @thisguyhere or @psychotiller 250-350, depending on how much range you want. it totals to about 500-600$

There’s a lot of more motors you can choose from but a 6374 is a good option, preferably 150-190kv for a single drive

Yup that's what I was originally gonna go for (190kv 6374) I just didn't know a decent place to get em. Along with that I wanted a VESC but also was overwhelmed by how many different kinds there are

You can get a flipsky 4.12 vesc on aliexpress for only $50 which is half the price of the @torqueboards one and if you'd like i could build you a battery for the cost of the cells and bms +$50-$75 for labor.
I used @Boardnamics mounts in this relatively cheap drivetrain i built in this YouTube video

Remember to include the costs of an enclosure and your belt drive system.
Again psychotiller has some nice enclosures which you can bundle up if you purchase a battery from him.
Those look like ABEC cores? so a pulley system like this one from torqueboard should be something you should research into.
https:///products/36t-abec-pulley-combo-kit
There are cheaper versions such as 3D printed versions from DIY vendors but this is good start point if you are looking at purchasing from torqueboards. I assume you know what specifications you want from your board but just in case use the links below to calculate your whole setup.

Do yourself a favor and get some m4 assorted screws and xt60s, and some bullet connectors before you do anything, buy them on aliexpress. They're cheap but takes a while to ship.

And also a soldering iron if you don't have one already

Quick little update for ya'll if you're still curious, @M.Hboards is hooking me up with a 10s3p battery, the VESC from aliexpress (above) and a @Boardnamics mount too, along with a bunch of other misc hardware. Probably gonna go with the @torqueboards nano remote and still gonna go with the BKB 6374 motor. Getting excited to build this thing! Oh and I attached the trucks to the board :ok_hand:t3:

I decided to go with the motor off the back due to the enclosure and my board being a weird size, that shouldn’t present any problems right?

Looks like both your pulleys would support 15mm wide belts but you are using 12mm, is that right?

Depending on your weight you might get some belt skipping, specially on a single motor build, if you don't that's great but if you do 15mm belts would be the next thing to do.

There ya are folks! It’s temporary but it works great for now, absolutely love this thing, thank you to everyone who gave me advice and helped me through my first build🙏🏼 Big shoutout to @M.Hboards for the battery and for helping me out through a lot of it!
I totally would have done a video but it has been rainy weather today sadly

Sorry guys, been super busy lately with work and stuff, the board is (technically) not really finished cause I haven’t gotten my enclosure yet from @psychotiller, I’ve messaged him multiple times and no replies yet sooo might just try to build myself one, but the few time I’ve gotten to ride the board it’s been doing absolutely amazing! Love it so much and can’t wait to officially finish it, hopefully soon ish.![image|375x500](upload://tm227lzEGMprdCD3b0jyuwxSi4d.jpeg)

I've also messaged @psychotiller around a month ago since I bought something from him and haven't heard anything. It seems he's busy, but I think we deserve at least an update.

He is very very busy, DM him on Instagram and you should get a faster response...

@DEEIF Either he blocked me or he deleted his account. Neither of which bodes well.

EDIT: I signed in with a different account and found him. He blocked my other account. Not cool at all.

Finally got my enclosure, its pretty cool, only thing is, my board (it being homemade) is not really suited for an enclosure so I’m on hunt to find a deck now 😂 I’ll let y’all know how it goes

You have some pics of the new enclosure laying on top of the board? You may be able to use some neoprene foam to make the enclosure fit your deck.

Yeah that's going to be hard to get that to fit. maybe do a diy fiberglass enclosure.
