Hello. I'm not sure how to start a thread, it's my first time on the site. I am looking to build my first electric longboard. I am 6'1 weigh 220lbs. I am looking to build a longboard using the Bustin Nomad 36 inch. Other than that I don't know what parts would go with this board to achieve 25 mph with a charge of at least 20 miles. All tips and advice is appreciated. Would also appreciated someone letting me know how to start my own thread. Thanks in advance. .<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/a/9a715f68ec68b120842222b110780fa53a83dca9.jpg" width="243" height="500">

Welcome to esk8 builders. The most important rule is: READ A LOT BEFORE MAKING A THREAD.
Second rule:USE SEARCH FUNCTION.
Only after you have a specific idea of parts, you can make a thread because there are tons already made, so just read.

You can use that calculator to have an idea of parts to use to reach a certain speed and range : http://calc.esk8.today/

As a newbie, the easiest option to buy parts is to buy a kit from https://

As the others said, a lot of posts exist on this forum and you should be able to find a lot of info here.
