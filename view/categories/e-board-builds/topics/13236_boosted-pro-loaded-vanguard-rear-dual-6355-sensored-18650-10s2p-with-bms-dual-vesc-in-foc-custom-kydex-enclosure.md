@torqueboards I beleive that you shipped an incorrect kit. The washer is correct, but the drive wheel is not. Please let me know how to return/ get a replacement unit.

I will try to bring back the VESC once I get back from thanksgiving break.

Yes. I have the second motor, mount, and gears but I blew one of my 2 VESCS from switching to FOC without resetting... So I am fixing that first.

Also, as far as enclosures go, I am planing on making a KYDEX enclosure. I am at Georgia Tech, so I have access to a CNC machine which I will likely use to make a mold for the KYDEX cast. We also have a proper vacuum forming machine, so I plan to use that.

I will upload my solidworks files once I finish them. (Probably in a week or two since I am currently home for thanksgiving break.)

Update:

I am looking to upgrade/ switch my BMS to the BesTech 10S BMS with e-switch as it should make for a cleaner overall design.

This BMS: http://www.bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D223V1.html

I have already contacted BesTech, but there are minimum order quantities. If anyone wants one, let me know **before** **Wednesday Nov 30, 2016**

I have attached the data sheet below that was sent to me.

Hello Tim!

I'm building a very similar board, I'm using a dual 6355 motors with 13/36 pulley kit and I'm building a 10S4P battery for long rides.

I'm using this custom fiberglass VESC's enclosure. I had one 3D printed (@emancarrillo) and now I made it one with fiberglass.

Please let me now if you are interested in getting one.

Hello,

Very nice case. I have already bought Kydex sheets, so I will attempt making one soon, but I will let you know if that fails.

I am currently waiting for my burned out VESC to finish the RMA process but will get back to building after that.

Also, **What does your layout look like on the inside of your enclosure and how did you route cables from your battery?** I am planning on 3D printing a holder for the dual VESCs similar to this one by @Blasto: [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1904475](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1904475)

I also have 2 6800uf 63v (really large) capacitors that I will use to replace the stock VESC capacitors to avoid any issues with running wires across the board.

I grooved the vanguard with a DREMEL, I have 2 lines which I can run the cables through.
Check Eboosted's post, we are building pretty much the same setup, you'll see how the lines are made.

@fraannk , yes, I can make bigger sizes, actually, I'm doing the battery enclosure (10S4P) son

Does anyone (@MarioGC maybe??) Have experience running dual vesc foc on the 6355 motors? I'm on a college campus, so silence would be great.

I will be updating this thread once my parts arrive and when I start building again.

Thanks @MarioGC. I got FOC working on my newer 4.12 vesc and my modded 4.10 vesc.

It seems my problem with it previously was because I had a 4.10 vesc from @torqueboards. After adding the c26 capacitor I haven't had any issues.

My experience with FOC was really nice at low load, almost silent, feels crazy. But on high load it cutted out, I almost fried my DRV chip.

[img]http://i.imgur.com/3OPGsTz.png[/img]

I won't recomend FOC to anyone with a regular VESC, maybe a VESC-X or any direct FET with upgraded capacitors.

Fortunately, the error went away on it's own and the VESC is still working, I'm back at BLDC mode

Update: I'm currently working on my cases, but in the meantime, here are some pics of the battery packs. (A friend is helping me cad them)

The first image is the battery pack that is going on my board. The other 2 packs are ones I built for my friends that are also building battery packs. 

All 3 packs are 10s2p packs made from Samsung 25r cells with a BesTech 10s 80A BMS. 

Here are some images.

Each one is equivalent to 10 of the small one that come with the vesc. This solves all the overboard wire problems.

Thank you! I bought some locally instead, it was the "Nichicon 6800uF 63V 105C". After inspecting the data sheets they seem to be the same, except that these are rated for a little higher temperature(shouldn't be an issue though). 

I only bought them because I'll have them here on monday opposed to the other ones which would take about a month.

I originally wanted to use the e switch, but after seeing that it turned on the vescs while charging I just bridged the e switch pins so that's it's always on and then put in a separate on off switch to turn on the board. 

Haven't had any issues with the actual BMS Charing. It keeps the cells nicely balanced. 

Hope that helps @egzplicit

**Update: Crash and new battery.**

After riding the board for a while I got quite confident in riding it and one of the times I was riding without a helmet I crashed hard going about 25mph and ended up with 5 staples in my head. (Nov. 10) [Photo](https://photos.app.goo.gl/cXYbDpbH6FPcXSGn2) Needless to say I always wear a helmet now (often full face)

After that I didn't really ride my board for a while because I was a bit scared or it and because the battery had broken in the crash. (The solder connections broke due to impact)

Then for Christmas I got myself a proper [battery spot welder](http://geni.us/lTAGn) determined to build a new better battery pack that wouldn't cause more issues going forward.

This time I decided to get a much [smaller BMS](http://geni.us/twc1r11) that I use for charging only (discharge limits set in vescs) which let me fit a 10s3p battery in the space that previously had only a 10s2p battery.

The geometric configuration of the cells was a bit weird because the case had been previously designed for a smaller battery, but it did end up barely fitting.

That is all for now. I am still planning on doing a proper build video on the whole process if I end up building another one of these with a friend, but school is taking priority at the moment.

With that, here is another picture of my completed board:
(Not sure why the image is flipped...)

Glad to hear you're OK! What kind of range did you get on yout 10S2P setup?

Why no fishpaper?

6-7 miles of range riding on fairly hilly ground.

Mostly bc I didn't have any around. And the Samsung 25r cells have the plastic insert on the top that I didn't feel it was necessary.

The real question is: can you go up Freshman Hill on it?

Easily. I can accelerate going up it.

But did you still feel enough power from the 10s2p pack? Any cutouts or something ?

What are those White things on the enclosures?

Seems to be metal plates to spread the load more evenly. It's actually a good idea to avoid having cracks in the enclosure where the screws go in.

The white things are 1/4" aluminum plates that I cut on a waterjet. 

The cases were 3d printed on one of my school's research printers.

10s2p was fine with power delivery. Never had a problem with it. 

Just ended up making a 10s3p pack because I had more room in the case from switching to a smaller BMS and I was rebuilding the battery anyway.
