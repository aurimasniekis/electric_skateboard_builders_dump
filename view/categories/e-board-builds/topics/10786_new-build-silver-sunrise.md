I've gotten a lot good ideas from this forum and have always shared mine for other e- builders. My new build took about 40 hrs. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/e/ae4b921a9428b313a2344f1e1ffdf329c3828cbd.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/1/6127c0c8d299f386ffb2c669d81c8976d8f0090f.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/1/21a82d6d8b3d20791d4a2db3011dd55ea17a41ec.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/b/6bf80cd4e230a5c0f4ae977a51ae53ee079ca71b.jpeg" width="500" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/1/f109db8872d2ff39ad68465c6076b59aa46c0895.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/9/29b32830e81ef7caf95c1005aa72684a6f5f77f1.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/0/f0e1d3763b67c7138bf95d0f2eee14b0fa73b55e.jpeg" width="375" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/a/ba89bba00e76fbd43ff824c87f35d46eefa9822c.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/2/72a3d7459d932eace83ea6cd08dac8797d88d731.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/1/61c60d73c82ff6d37061091964f2be322c02f9e5.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/b/8b7fd6dc25dcdb2fd83056fd74d802e8276bc00a.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/c/1c16eb9648c9e8a04bc66181f7aa41fcb2325c0f.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/7/87d2a2c4c26f4363ebf8228eef29f305adadf449.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/f/9f47aa1312bb3cd206085a160b3b73af9f69d10d.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/0/00a931929889814159eb5dd90055885a75ca58f9.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/1/a1a1ee5aae2744418dd56ce98b5eb4ffe24d7d02.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/6/869e408672fc9d566371c92dd236fd60257330e4.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/9/b9a6b6978c595f33c342443d970710f97850b38f.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/5/a541a3b90fbf9b123ffb26f9c33141f7845ded01.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/1/a1ee78b0807990848b2839ea4b8c8066219fe013.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/4/44b184fc20df298cabca96625445567290642439.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/a/2aa52f7ce33e58c46008618a84529ef2d4f74e76.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/9/d9cd19b8f5df49444d9d6eefdda444a63235075d.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/c/5c341cf4c46ec5beefd5f60ff58579fe031b4d82.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/1/f1d138552af5ee9689e76530f43c93c3fa74cec5.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/9/194991c9585b2ba2b3d483963dbbfac40f69af40.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/f/9f672f8fcc51093a24d4205214812e68194af6b6.jpeg" width="375" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/1/d13d7d3a43556f6b803858e4abcc52f6eb1980ab.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/c/1cc1b80c74b7f2fd0e8ee63cc0167d44eecff97d.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/d/cd8d29aa05c8b382ce629b3f35a8a361e51ec09a.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

Really excellent board! A lot of hard work put into it from what it looks like! @michaelcpg had the same idea of two decks being attached together.

This is why I wanted to share. Get ideas and share ideas alike. The material and two boards were only about $100. I got the covers for free. Routed out grooves for wires. It took awhile the build but was worth it not to mention fun

Just standard wood glue. I also clamped,screwed,and bolted down the truck holes to get the final press of the two decks. In my surprise the deck has no flex and is strong as hell. I cut out a lot of material

I haven't weighed it yet but not quite done. I'm building a soft start switch and maybe adding a led light later. I cut chases in between the layers for future wiring.

How did you deal with routing out for the covers to be recessed? Seems the concave would be troublesome? Did you lower it in small increments? 

Thanks

Amazing build @Glenn ! What is the laminate the laminate on the bottom of the deck, to give it that smooth silver appearance?  It looks like plastic but maybe it's just extremely good-looking painted wood?

The paint job was done by a friend who owns his own paint booth. He did an excellent job. The cover plate were hard to do and were  done with a router by hand. I just slowly cut them out until the plates were flush. I made my own 8s3p battery pack, with my own motor mount, enertion's vesc, sk3 213kv motor, bms and working on making my own soft switch. I spent a lot of time planning and cutting out channels for wiring and future. It's a little to high and might change the motor mount to rear mount later so I can lower deck a little bit. thanks for all the compliments

Holy shit! That turned out really nice. That deck is one of my favorite build shapes too!

This will inspire many future builds I'm sure.
