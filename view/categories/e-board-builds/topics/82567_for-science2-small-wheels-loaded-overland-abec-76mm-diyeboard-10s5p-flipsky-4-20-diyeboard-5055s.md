**Assertions**
- 76mm ABEC 11s provide a better quality of ride **for a long term skateboarder** than china hubs
- see how much abuse some diye trucks can take with smalls wheels (so far I've broken 2 sets (110mm and 97mm) 
- can I fit a flipsky 4.20 in the 5p diye enc (yes!) 

everything started with some seriously discounted small ABECs around BF, wanted to try smaller wheels for along time but didn't want to risk spending much 
![image|374x500](upload://u0qmSdh6jYRzGptOPNI4mLRRJXz.jpeg) 

they were really cheap so got both 75a &  78a, 
https://www.skates.co.uk/abec-11-flywheels-76mm-longboard-wheels-x4.html

random pulley fits pretty well 
![image|558x500](upload://3UaexcZw51JR6NWpwUcb6tlrXWy.jpeg) 

resulting in the first eskate so far that actually looks in scale!
![image|690x422](upload://ucSMafZBukUK4aaC779hgX371rj.jpeg) 

not much clearance at all 
![image|690x364](upload://vFcxb3lY1Ns6GzmsJnZyySqIOUz.jpeg) 

damage after one ride
![image|529x434](upload://iKGieLxdyC1VqwfkETZmaZU91HZ.jpeg) 

a few rides... getting some real damage to both mounts and the pulley wheels give too much and i feel it hit things as i ride 
![image|690x333](upload://nP29GA4sCtAQNw8V9eOt2Qn6VZM.jpeg) 

turns out I think the wheels are just a little too soft, need to try my harder set  - pulleys got shattered or ground down due to sticking out too much  
![image|671x500](upload://uaIdtsc1VpbV59Ds9z3yQoQ4mVa.jpeg) 

fixed with a little snapping bits off getto mod, really ugly but its an experiment 
![image|467x316](upload://q22lJcpwXbyqWzzRDE4y8juyBDh.jpeg) 

much cleaner, hope the belts don't suffer!
![image|690x319](upload://ossEJ4ZDATszCp4qnPG2gLwQhjS.jpeg) 

also  dedcied to add some wax - turns out this helped  :wink: 
![image|690x475](upload://eQHFWQe8TqFxNa5Ef1aCqlLg3Ou.jpeg) 

this next one is after lots of riding - most damage I've done to one of these so far - one thing to note the motors never get hit, the belts also seem to not take much damage (surprising!)
![image|690x350](upload://rWQkbOydH1hpEs4oQMYnaZFLBQM.jpeg)  


**Findings**
- Ride Quality : much better than expected way superior to 90mm china meepo style hubs (mind you they have 20mm thane vs 5mm on hubs) 
- Extra Torque: even using the diye 2.1 ESC was stunning vs my same setup with 97mm
- Sound: I've missed the sound of a skateboard, riding up behind people was totally different they really hear you coming! 
-  Roll: contentment to simply roll, I've come closest to almost pushing on this board as I almost forgot it was electric
- Grind Mounts: (while they are still in one piece at least) seem perfect for this low profile clearance these take serious constant hits and grinds, its gotten to the point where I purposely grind on stuff there's one manhole cover, I've stated doing 50/50 on - totally never expect that 
-Weight: massive difference to 97mm I can throw this board around with its 50cells like its not electric 

.... I'm totally in love with small wheels :grinning:

a quick test ride 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk9R7YQOdyc

next time using the harder compound and wide metal @torqueboards pulleys  
![image|628x500](upload://59l8hRvpWv9tuX8HfobOcFExzmb.jpeg) 

I like how out of scale this pulley looks! :smile: 
![image|431x500](upload://h8oJZFoDmQvhIISxf6q3mjOXSZw.jpeg)  

so I thought I'll try some @dickyho mounts see how they clear... oh dear worse than diye ones :frowning: 
![image|690x419](upload://JMoEzku0EkXHbaavFI2krov1b1.jpeg)  

gave up on these mounts at this point
![image|690x468](upload://u7ohQgXhId1jjt5SWqPV8XO8pwg.jpeg)

I have some perfect TB pulleys to use but I need mounts with good clearance - any suggestions?

I've been doing something similar, working on a method of using ABEC Centrax wheels with 32t pulleys.  I miss the feeling of low center of gravity and road feel you get form smaller wheels.  Most traditional skate wheels are harder to ride powered, IMHO, as they dont roll over debris at speed as well as larger wheels but it's still fun and a great board to have in the arsenal.  Good luck.

I've spent my analogue skating years riding on bad surfaces, so this setup for me is so nostalgic I have to consider the terrain in a completely different way - I can ride the same style as my 97s but if I ride this like its analogue the fun factor is through the roof!

This board ollies as well as my 80's powell deck with 10s2p - I would never recommend this for a commuter or even a second board, but for something I thought would be a horrible ride has made me smile so much more than expected :)

EDIT: I have had a couple of close calls at speed when a stone or whatever gets stuck and lifts one wheel off the ground for a bit

almost forgot, I started to think about proper grinds with this board, started to wonder if I applied some spray on thane to the blue highlighted bits on my motors I could actually use it for some powered grinds (at least at a skatepark), I did find some spray that apparently covered did up to 2cm but can't find the link now

I won't be able to show the whole build but I'll be sure to post the adapters once they come off the mill. <80mm wheels are the future of fast eskate imo. 

Looking forward to hearing @sk8l8r impressions of smaller wheels.

they've blown me away! I expected almost nothing from them, but I want to get some serious torque into these 76s see and see what they can do with non-junk parts :) 

I've not had many chances to ride recently but the times I have gotten out I've pickup up my 76mm build over the 97mm EVERY time so far , looking forward to making a proper build with smalls :)

EDIT: oh yea lower center of gravity really made a difference, in that test ride those trucks are almost totally loose I couldn't ride my 97s that fast and with that loose trucks (I use no real risers but I did use a few mm rubber thing due to overland silly texture)

This is basically one of my pro rider friends set up..I'm trying to inspire the Toronto Ontario DH boys they laugh at most of the stuff built.. hopefully @chaka and @okp hook us up ..did you ever find a enclosure to fit this outlaw?

a little update on the abuse these diye trucks are taking, lots of diye haters out there not going to like this but they are holding up incredibly well :grin:

these are taking hits all the time, I'm grinding them on some places for fun now and they are still in one piece 

are these not the most damaged and in one piece diye trucks anyone has seen lol

It hasn't yet, the wheels are so soft it's difficult to drill the wheel straight. I'm looking at other methods but it's spring so may be awhile.
