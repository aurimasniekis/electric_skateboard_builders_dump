So this is what I have just now. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/5a36b6dcbd4c83f35914856deb27ea895f4f30c9.jpeg" width="375" height="500"> 

And was a very cheap inexpensive start to get me going. Using lipo and a very cheap deck which is twisted and doesn't ride nice. So now it's time to build a better deck and change to li-ion with bms and more similar charging system. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/c/6c81f029905b8843ac0c570ec86fbd99d1990953.png" width="690" height="387">

This will be my new deck hand built here in the uk. I have requested that it's made into a drop through as that my preferred look. Once it's here I will be adding some more wood on the lower part of the deck and will be in closed and all smoothed in then wrapped in carbon fiber weave and epoxied over the top to give a smooth gloss finish. The rest of the board should stay same spec wise as motor and esc are doing well. Batteries should be with me over next week or so and deck should be about two weeks as needs to be made. More pictures to come and can't wait to get it looking spot on.

So some small update batteries should be here next few days as have landed in the uk. The deck will be started mid week but the person making it for me which he has said will supply me with all the pictures as he goes along. Have been research some carboning methods and one of the cheaper option is to skinning kit as for one off product not much point in going down the vacuum bag route. Here is a demo video by the place I will be getting the kit from.

Yea I'm planing on making a rectangle frame out of ply soak if in water and then clamp it to the board to take its shape then sand it so it blends into the board  once that's done screw/bond it to deck then wrap in carbon like the vid. Then make a latching lid on the bottom with everything in it.

So have now glued my batteries together. Now it's time to spot weld them but what's the best route to do it here is two pic of the two option I think but what best as don't want to short in any way. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/a/ca405564375a856a78f1ab6957b97a714e1c4efc.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/d/1d00feb476ce964db2622f5268adc689e6a6d2ed.JPG" width="375" height="500">

I'd put some Copper braid or something else on the outside connections to reinforce them. Some people do it, some people don't, might be better though for higher amps.

EDIT: Yeah I would do 4 strips for the inner connections

Yea think I might see if can get some more but don't see the need for the copper as people like @barajabali doesn't use it in his. But then also I think two could be enough to join two as only one joining the our side is enough.

Hopefully @barajabali can comment - but once you get your spot welder going again - maybe add a few more welds to a few of those?  

As i understand it (not a professional) surface area of the weld is important for current capacity?  Someone clarify if i'm waay off base.  Understand that your welder died, but perhaps add a few when you get it going again.

Moving quickly!  Are those HG2's?  I got some from a reputable place nearby for my pack, but they were $$$!  Not trusting everything to balance on it's own i've charged them once now to make sure they are all at the same voltage - next it spot welding!

Yea hope he can comment. Yea getting a new switch tomorrow to finish of the out side and make sure there's enough contact. Yea they are hg2 from gearbest but until i discharge and rechrage to confirm the capacity everything els matches up to genuine ones and at $112 for 24 made them cheapest delivered to the uk for me.

@2-alex-2 @sl33py

I always double up with nickel strip at the very minimum.  Sometimes there will be 3 or 4 layers of nickel strip ( not layers stacked on top of eachother but layers next to eachother) I weld each nickel strip individually 4 - 5 times ( so that 8-10 connections) and then i weld the other layers on top 2-3 times.

Ok so my battery is built and ready for my BMW to arrive. And I was wondering how I could wire a second led to indicate low voltage. 

This is the bms (yes I'm aware it's 5a but won't be using bms for discharge)
https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/321790634514 

I also have one of these after my vadder soft switch.

I also have the esc voltage cut of in place but my though with this is it won't tell me if one cell drops lower than the others. I know a lot of people say li ion is much better balanced but what I was wondering is if I was to install a led between bms and my soft switch. So what would happen is if the bms picked up a low cell the led would go of but board still operates 100% as the bms is only 5a

So have now got the enclosure all mounted up and griptape on the deck. Also got some holes drilled for charger and main switch. Know I have that done I will now start to add more of a curved edge to the enclosure. Once that's done one coat of carbon fibre weave over out side should finish it off nicely.

I actually haven't wired it in yet as it was faulty so I'm not using BMW just now. When I get time to order up a new one will be wired up battery to B-/B+ and all the balance leads to correct cells. Then charger to P-/P+ I wasn't going to discharge through the bms as it's only a 5amp

So ordered up a set of the dual pivot kits to see if can get a bit more ground clearance and then see if enough room for some 6" mtb wheels and tyres.

Realised that the double pivot would not work unless I use either evolve trucks or gullwing so back to the drawing board to what I can do to keep it drop through and get longer wheel base and height to get some small mtb wheels on.
