How are the battery packs running? Was going to make a 12s2p for my cruising board but didn't know if it was worth trying to use the recycled cells.

They are good I used aluminum bars for the series connections in the pack squishing the + and -s together then the same idea but with copper bars with 10 awg wire soldered to it for the actual connection out of the pack.

I stripped a lot of length to maximize the contact of the wire to my bars

I've only ruined 1 and it was from being squished between the flaps at the bottom of the box during shipping. And even then it was only when I started putting 12s voltage that it puffed. Other than that I went through my 42 and tested the internal of all them and they're all pretty much "new"

I will say this though unless your a trained electrician or are loaded up on insurance and don't care you shouldn't play with these cells a single one will kill you. The can output almost 350amps on dead short

I will say I am neither a trained electrician nor are loaded up on home insurance so a build using these will be a pipe dream for a while.

Did you think of including a bit of height to your enclosure so the wired connectors dont start bending or breaking off?

Ya it's got enough room and I used kapton tape and electrical tape to protect from rubbing( kapton first then electrical tape on top for the black matching) thought that would be more than enough to protect from rubbing

I was re alinging my sprockets last night and I stripped the end of my truck un bolting it. My own fault but I am aware of crossthreading and always take precautions to prevent it and considering it went on fine then the removal is when I had all the resistance:( now I have to buy a new truck from trampa. Ugh live and learn. But super upset I can't ride and now putting all my batteries to storage is taking forever

I would take the hanger to a mechanic, it is a simple fix, no need to buy or wait that much time....Use Loctite just in case...But I would not spend time and money in a new hanger...

Go to Canadian tire and buy a tap and die set. Then rethread the end and enjoy riding again
