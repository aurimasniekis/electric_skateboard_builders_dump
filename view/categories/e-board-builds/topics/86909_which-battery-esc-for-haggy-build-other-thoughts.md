Hello friends,

I've been wanting an electric skateboard for ages and after a lot of research I simply can't bring myself to pull the trigger on anything prebuilt, so here I am!

## Board goals
- AT wheels for riding on grassy fields, shitty sidewalks etc
- Would LOVE to be able to ride on firm sand coast lines
- 20km range
- Not super fussed on speed but maybe 20km/h would be fun

_Essentially I just want a Bamboo Evolve GTX but with a decent battery and ESC so I don't die_

## Budget, weights, etc
- Aprox. $1800 AUD ($1200 USD) for the complete setup
- I weigh 75kg
- Live in Sydney Aus if that makes any difference to sourcing parts

## Thoughts so far
So I seem to find new parts and brands every day, it's all a bit overwhelming. However, I have stumbled across Haggyboard who do a drive system package which has the motors, wheels, trucks, gears and pulleys... I had originally intended on purchasing parts separately but his package seems fairly spot on for what I'm after.  
Otherwise, I was looking at getting a pair of [Flipsky 6354 motors](https://flipsky.net/collections/e-skateboard/products/6354-190kv-2450w-2)  with their [dual VESC](https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/dual-fsesc6-6-based-upon-vesc6-with-aluminum-heatsink).  
I'm also aware of Alien Power System and there are these dudes in Sydney, [Voltation](https://www.voltation.net/) who stock their stuff which would be pretty easy to get for me. 

### Anyway...
So ultimately what I'm asking (apart from general thoughts on the above) is what battery and ESC should I go for?  
I see the Focbox Unity get thrown around a lot as the "holy grail of ESC's" but then I also see a lot of people ragging on Enertion so I'm getting mixed signals on that.  
As for the battery, I was looking at Samsung 30q's... there's a dude in Aus that makes packs; [Marsen](https://marsen.com.au/products/battery-packs/marsen-energy-36v-12000mah-gt-electric-skateboard-battery-upgrade/)   
What about the [alien power system batteries](https://www.voltation.net/product-page/alien-power-pack-10s-10000mah)? Are they any good?

This post ended being a bit more general than I intended... but anyway, thanks in advance for any advice for my first build!!

These are rock solid I run them myself, you can use them with @Ackmaniac 's firmware. If you need ESC'S quick grab them. If I had the money I would!
