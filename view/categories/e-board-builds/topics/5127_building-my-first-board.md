At first glance it looks okay to me.

I haven't done much research on lipos or their chargers since my charging situation is totally different (as I'm doing an 18650 build with a BMS), so I can't guide you there, sorry.

You may need some wire depending on how you're planning on mounting everything and if you need to go longer than the wires that come with the battery, VESC, and/or motor. XT60s or 90s (your choice, and there's many other options as well) would probably also be needed in that case.

Something to think about is maybe an anti-spark connector or even switch for when you plug in your batteries.

thank you, i have orderd all that now. only problem i have left is that it costs me 200 dollars to get 2x5s lipos and a charger beacause of shipping. Is 18650 a cheaper option?
