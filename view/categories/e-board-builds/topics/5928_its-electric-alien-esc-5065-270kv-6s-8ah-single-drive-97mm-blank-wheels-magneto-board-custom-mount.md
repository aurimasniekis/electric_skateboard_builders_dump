Hey! Great forum - helped alot :)
I'm from Latvia and this is my first e-board build.
My goal was to build affordable board to see if this hobby is for me.

Here are parts and prices including shipping:

* 5065 270kv **motor** and 120A 7s **ESC** from Alienpowersystem (**138** eur)
* 8ah 6s multistar **battery**, Quanum Pistol Grip Tx & Rx, Lipo charge bag, cell checker, HobyKing (**95** eur)
* Magneto freeride **longboard** from e-bay (**55** eur)
* 97mm blank **wheels**, HungryHills (**75** eur)
* 15 mm M5 **belt**, 40T wheel **pulley** and 14T motor pulley from local shop (**32** eur)
* Custom mount (**3** eur)
* Welding and metal work (**30** eur)

**total: ~ 427 eur**

Board is wide, has long weel base and nice "w" concave, 97a bushings, no-name trucks.

Both pulleys are steel, so the 40T weights about 300 grams. I was worried that it could bend trucks, but haven't had an issue yet - at least it will last like forever.

Motor mount made my self with drill, metal jigsaw and file. Looks quite ugly but works fine. New alien closed body motors have different screw position so i had to mount it with just two bolts - still haven't gone loose (previously had older gen motor which i ruined because of my ignorance).

Top speed is around 27 km/h - enough to pass most cyclists. I ride without protective gear so got to stay safe. Already fell two times and it wasn't fun. First time i was going too fast in a corner and second time got sudden power cut (has happened only once) when doing full throttle acceleration which caused uncontrollable speed wobble. After that I installed harder bushing and made them tight.

Motor does get hot after full throttle ride, but not uncomfortably hot. Some time later i will test it with 16t pulley.

I usualy keep batery cells in range from 3.7v to 4.15v which gives about 12 km.

Overall i'm happy with the results - really fun first e-board. I have never seen another e-board here in Riga so i got a lot of attention.

Some time later i plan to install led lights and maybe on-deck ammeter/voltmeter.

Oh, forgot that it's 5070, but the length is same as 5065. So far it runs great - let's hope closed body will increase longevity.

I like how you mounted the esc where it will get plenty of air to keep it cool.
I also just ordered 2 of AP's new 6355 HEV motors along with 10mm pulleys.
So does yours stay pretty cool or does it get kinda hot when riding?
Being closed will help keep the dirt out but might also keep the heat in.

Previously i used older gen open design alien motor and it did get as warm as the new one - quite hot, but not uncomfortable to touch. Larger motor should dissipate heat better.

Here are some recent upgrades i've made:
 - Smaller box
 - Led lights
 - External charging ports

To power leds i used [step down converter](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/291692573003?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT) and for slimmer box had to split lipo pack. External charging ports are much more convenient :thumbsup:

Hey!
I'm building a very similar setup. Blew out my first motor because it was 500kv and I didn't know what I was doing, but in a few days a new 270kv motor will arrive and it should work perfectly this time. 
I'm wondering about the remote you're using. I'm using the exact same one, but had some weird issues with it. When configuring throttle range, the instructions told me to turn the throttle trim to 100%, calibrate everything and then it should work. What ended up happening though is that I'd spin up the motor, let it spin down to a stop but then it would shake back and forth slightly until I'd click the throttle forward a bit and back to neutral (apply slight brake). 
Do you have any similar issues or ways of fixing it?
Thanks!
```

hmm, I think throttle trim should be in default position (middle). In my instruction manual there was't anything about trim. But, yea, i have seen similar behavior when 100% trim.

They can overcome obstacles much better than standard 70mm but have little bit reduced handling. Can't complain otherwise.

Few weeks ago i got into nasty accident, car pulled in front of me while i was going full throttle. Most impact went to knees, i did front flip and luckily landed without head injury as i wasn't wearing any protection. Was hard to walk for more than a week, but no broken bones and now i'm fully recovered.

Deck got broken in to half, damaged two battery cells, and destroyed enclosure - everything else was still usable.

Now i have 7s battery and it is noticeably faster (~35 km/h).

Take a look at this [calculator](http://toddy616.blogspot.com/2013/07/electric-skateboard-calculator.html).
30 mph is too much for single 50 mm setup. They are designed for up to 8s battery so its limiting factor.
VESC provides much more configuration options but is harder to setup.

## \#26 Posted by: Janis Posted at: 2017-06-08T13:56:49.057Z Reads: 156

Some popular 63XX motor with appropriate kv would do. (5065 means 50 diameter & 65 length)

These specs in theory would give 30 mph for 90mm wheels:
10s battery
220 kv motor
16t & 36t pulleys

You would also need stable deck with tight trucks for that speed.

I suggest you to do some more research, read guides/tutorials/build threads.

Those batteries are way too small and not enough discharge amps.
When looking for battery you should consider three main key points: capacity, max continuous discharge and size (enough clearance under board) .

The motor is fine but you could find better quality one from some eskate part vendor.

Here are some pictures from latest rebuild.
I'm back to 6s (zippy 30c 8ah) because wanted more range and convenient charging. (7s setup din't have bms)
Enclosure box is thicker but still lot of clearance.
I find best to mound esc outside for better cooling.
For switch i use 40a household circuit barker from hardware store.
Charging and balancing ports are out side so there is no need to open enclosure.
48t 3d printed wheel pulley gives 26km/h speed, which is quite slow, but system is running barely warm and quiet.

They seems to be reliable. If esc is overheating it will cut the power. It happened, when at beginning i put it inside the enclosure. Since last rebuild it takes quite long time to pair with remote after power up (40 sec.) - not sure why..

For charger I'm now using standard imax b6. For 7s setup i had 7s laptop style charger. Charged up to ~4.1 per cell and then if needed plugged 3s and 4s separately to  imaxb6 for balance charging.
