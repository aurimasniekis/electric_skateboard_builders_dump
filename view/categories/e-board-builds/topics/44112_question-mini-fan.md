This should be the right direction.

Usually, PC fans gets air in when the sticker of the brand company/fan information is facing down.

Also the fan usually has an arrow pointing in the direction the will "flow" when you connect the fan

Fans usually blow in the direction of the sticker side. Depends on the brand tho. If you want to cool a plate you must point the air flow towards the metal or the heatsinks. If you have a battery inside that box you may prefer to take the hot air out. What is inside that box? What's the weather like in your area?  Maybe you don't really need that fan.
Batteries actually work much better when they are warm. If they get too hot 50°+ for example it can damage the cells. Depending on your use you need that fan.... or not.

If I was cooling a PC I would ensure I have one fan in and one fan out to maximize the air flow

It depends on which way the fan spins when you apply power.
