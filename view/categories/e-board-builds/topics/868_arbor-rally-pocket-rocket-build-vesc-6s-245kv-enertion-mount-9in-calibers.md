Basically I've always liked this deck when looking at it online, but never bought it because it looked too small for an eboard...

Well, turns out my local skate shot had one (and all boards were $20 off :smile: ) and after seeing it in person, I could tell it was actually mroe possible than I thought!

All the parts in this build are left over from past projects except the VESC and the Deck itself, so that's how I'm justifying it's existence to my wallet. 

The parts:
Arbor Rally
Caliber 9" trucks
Abec flywheels
Enertion CF motor mount
turnigy 245kv SK3
Enertion VESC
2x 1800mah 6s lipos (parallel)
GT2B 2.4ghz remote

just some size comparisons- I also really like the wood used on the rally

First major step was modifying the hanger so that I could fit the enertion mount: just a bit of dremeling

so the next big step is the enclosure.. On my last build, I used wood to match the deck. This time, I wanted to try something new, so I decided to use fiberglass. I made one earlier attempt, and it went quite well. This is my second version, and I think it is looking pretty good so far. It still needs some fine tuning, but the general shape is what I was going for.

Still in progress, so I'd love to hear anyone's suggestions!

Also, I realize the two small batteries will give me a really short range, but this build is mostly parts I had on hand, so I didn't want to order anymore lipos.

**Next update!**

Everything is wired up, and done except for the detail work. It still needs some touching up with the fiberglass, and a coat of paint. 

Here's how the enclosure turned out after the first layer of fiberglass: 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/df93fbf3527e7316f2ce3a16142091e3858d489a.jpg" width="690" height="388">
the smaller case was V1 of my fiberglassing attempts. 

After taking it off, I beefed up the corners and top of the case with a second layer of fiberglass and resin.

Next, I wired up the two 6s batteries in parallel:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/d13d4854ec8ade2fd9b9b930540bc1300f0e0111.jpg" width="500" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c5ecda4fc23530b0c708fef2b0d30652407f5d50.jpg" width="500" height="500">

I also drilled some holes for the VESC 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/3/3e663e8d54e786a2ac0ab20aea8ab7efa35cd346.jpg" width="500" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/86f3e6a2a697448eb9465f7d3211da93317e5fa5.jpg" width="500" height="500">
Soldered up the bullet connectors to connect the motor. Ran through the BLDC tool with almost no troubles (had to mess around with the com ports a little) 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/0f4c57f849e99bbde6a23f9f229919c5b249ffb2.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/0ec0226e17e781ba53d0101db901add4645aa378.jpg" width="690" height="388">

So right now here's where I'm at:
my on/off switch is just that bullet connector hanging out the side... I've ordered some anti-spark xt90's to make a loop key, but this is what I got for now.

charging xt90 is on the far side, and the balancing port the close side: I have ordered some 9pin plugs that will have both the balancing and charging wires hooked up to them so that it is one simple plug for charging. 

I also got some spray paint that is apparently supposed to be like truck bed liner, so we will see how that goes..

before the paint, I will clean up the edges of the fiberglass box, and do some light sanding. I just need to get a better mask before I go that far.

I'm really liking the feel of this tiny cruiser so far :smile:
for being a heck of a lot less expensive than my daily driver, it really is a sweet board.

Nice use of smaller trucks and fiberglass skills. Great setup! Gotta have a single motor that's lightweight nowadays!

Nice! simple and clean!
I'm curious about charging in parallel though. Isn't there a possibility of over charge or over discharge issues due to different cell resistances of the two batteries?

## \#8 Posted by: cmatson Posted at: 2016-01-04T02:01:56.573Z Reads: 260

```
yes, because you are technically balancing a parallel of two cells.

I bought both of the batteries at the same time, and both have had the same amount of cycles- I think with the cutoff set at 3.3volts per cell, and by charging to 4.15volts per cell the lipos will be just fine. 

There are a lot of people who charge their lipos in parallel with no problems, so I will see how this goes!

Awesome! Good idea charging and discharging before the limits. Im thinking about charging my lipos in para. also but unfortunately I have 2 cells that seam to have less capacity. I may just solve all this with a new 8s 10amp charger and a bms. we'll see

looking good. I like the charge plug that you speak of with the balance built in. pics please.

also I gotta ask. why use two 6S 1800 in parallel when you could use two 3S in series and have a much lower profile?

Pretty much what @lox897 said. 

I had those two batteries left over from a science project, and didn't really want to buy another set of lipos. In the future I'm definitely using two 3s batteries.

Hell yes! I can smell the bondo from here. This is going to be a sweet build and it looks like its going to be fun as hell to ride, even with the shorter range. 

You'll probably still be able to get 5 or 6 miles out of it though which will be fun for tearing around parking lots and bike trails.

Thanks!

I think I'll be able to maximize the range since I'm keeping the trucks relatively looks, and don't see myself doing any speed runs on this thing...

It's just the perfect little cruising/carving board :smile:

@lowGuido Sorry for the late response- I'll be using a pair of these guys:

I'm quite happy with this truck bed liner spray paint stuff: it hides a lot of imperfections, and gives it a hardier look.

It's almost like the look of @psychotiller's ABS enclosures..

(that little black square sticking out is th balancing port taped up.. I made the mistake of permanently attaching the charging port before painting... so the batteries were left inside the case)

And now, some near finished photos!!!! I'm loving the thing already!!

Definitely- 

The only downside is that you will need to make your own flatspot, but that isn't a huge deal.

With Lipo's parallel charging seems to be the most practical IMO. NO sense in charging multiple packs separately it doesn't make a difference in the long run it seems.

Been charging in parallel for a few a few years now. Packs seem to last longer.

The difference in cells seem to be by running the packs really low. Lower than 3.4v. My cut off is about 3.6v. Max charge I charge to 4.15v. I enjoy swapping packs personally. I just charge once the beginning of the week and use multiple packs.

Also don't keep the "low alarm voltage" units on the balance wires for long periods of time. They will specifically use power from only one cell and that will lower that "one cell". Do it too long and it's unrecoverable unless you charge that 1 cell specifically.

For this guy, I don't have any way to monitor battery levels besides just "feeling" when I get low. 

On my other Lipo board I use this simple volt meter from @longhairedboy : http://longhairedboy.com/shop/electrical-system/volt-meters-for-6s-8s/

Its basically the same one that Enertion was selling with its original 6S power pack a couple years ago. Except mine are red LEDs instead of blue. They're dead easy to use, but definitely no frills.

Do your voltage meters work on 8s? It looks like it says it does in the link but on your site it say 6s, 7s.

unfortunately they only go up to 30 volts, so 7S is the limit. I'm eventually going to find some much better ones when things calm down. I've had to stop scattering myself all over the place and just focus on my decks and boxes. Boxes for my decks are happening soon.

Good point @torqueboards I never thought about whether the lipo alarms were draining a single cell or the whole pack. Do you think that is it enough power drain to worry about if I just connect them during riding time (my longest rides are about an hour)? I figure that the balance charging I do would correct any small imbalance caused by the alarms.

This makes a coulometer seem much more attractive.

@treenutter - You'll be fine just as long as you keep them on while riding. As you said, they will balance out. But once you turn off your setup and put it aside. You'll need to remove those lipo alarms.
