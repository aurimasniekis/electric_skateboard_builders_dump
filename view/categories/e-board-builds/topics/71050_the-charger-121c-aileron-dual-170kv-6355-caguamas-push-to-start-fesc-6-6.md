Hope ya'll like it!
Notice that the render is slightly different cause I might be swapping it to the [Aortal Gear Drive](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-aortal-gear-drive-63xx-50-caliber-ll-compatible-90-to-107mm-wheels/67496) when I'm done fine tuning them.


Will be testing this out today :D (When it stops raining..)

I thought the carbon deck would make it way lighter, I guess the Caguamas and 6355 motors adds back, my build weight exactly that with same battery but 5055 motors and kegels

A board like that with a small battery and duas hubs or single belt would be amazing for short rides

The dual 6355 drive with the trucks and wheels are already 3kg heavy haha

Thanks! Hehe those are 85mm wheels! :smiley: The maytech motors took less than 24hours to arrive, insane.

Yeah, loved that the vanguard enclosure fits the deck perfectly, pretty amazing. the 10S4P enclosure by Alan fits the deck too :smiley:

Am using @torqueboards 16:36T pullies. There are a ton of kegel-cored pulleys. maybe @JLabs pullies? I have a set of them in a flywheel core (they come in a kegel core too) and those pulleys feel really premium.

Just finished a semi-range test today, did approx **31km** with the batts at 37.6V (3.76V/cell) after the ride - Figured a good estimate was a max range of 40 to 50km depending on how low I would want to drain the batteries to.

Also hit a max speed of **45.2kmh**, but I didn't max out the throttle yet.. I'm guessing the max speed would be 48kmh, which is scary fast for a 19" wheelbase - This leads me to believe that maytech did pass me 200kv motors instead of the requested 170kv. Oh well - guess i'll test it out tomorrow :smiley:

Well, i only weigh 72kgs :stuck_out_tongue:

Wh/km highly depends on the terrain, hillgrades and speed i'm going at for the ride. Occasional bursts at 45kmh and riding at 20kmh most of the time, I get about  6 to 8 wh/km.

Amp draw at crusing at 15kmh is only about 0.7A per batt. = 1.4A total.

Latest updates with the build:

* Glass Fritszz!
* Repainted eboosted enclosure.
* Popocas!
* Changed to a FatBoy 100A antispark!
* Changed motor pulley covers from FDMed-PETG to MJFed-Nylon PA12 Covers.
* Changed to my AVIO long remote!
* Changed bushings to 93A krank boardside 87A krank roadside with flat washers and added riot plugs!

Looks the same, but different!

Sorry but I can't give you the exact dimensions because I'm just far too lazy to remove the enclosure and measure it, plus it's basically silicon-ed shut on the enclosure.

Essentially, it's a double stacked (staggered) of 30 cells (30Qs) , with 15 cells staggered top of the other 15.

For this build, no. I implemented it on another build of mine:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-bouncer-loaded-vanguard-flex-2-42-evolve-f1-107-8s10ah-dual-focbox-dual-5055s-270kv-eboosted-enclosures-caliber-ii-50deg/62326/19

It was using the crappy Diyeboards dual motor kit before. Compared to that, my range increased by approximately 30% after swapping to my GD.
