Hello guys, 
I am building and electric kick scooter using a VESC 4.12, a 149KV Turnigy Motor and a 8S or 12S LiPO battery setup.


<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/e619deb5c0c84eaf3be93f92c0ef12fb764fabb6.JPG" width="666" height="500">

For controlling the scooter I am using two electric throttles for e-bikes (commons from ebay) and I have written a custom app using vedder's tutorial which works smoothly for the moment (I have written only the throttle, while the second control will serve for electric braking).

As I am not expert with poles and ERPM I would like to get some advice on how to configure limits for this scooter. It has a wheel with a 200mm diameter and 5:1 gearing. 

Any advices on limits, current limits and other critical information before connecting the batteries would be much much appreciated. 

For the batteries I planned to use a 12S configuration but I blew very easily my previously used vesc  so I would go for 8S at least for starters.

Of course in parallel I will try to understand on my own ERPM & limits configuration.

Thanks

And ingenious way of using a styrofoam plate as a deck for the scooter....should dampen the vibrations lol

There's a guy called beetbocks on the ES forum who is building these as well. Might be worth checking his builds out.

Well this is a draft, I plan to make aluminum deck but from casted aluminum, let's just not focus on the deck right now :slight_smile:

If I have a motor with that is 149KV

but the Calculated KV: 840.96 rpm/volt

when using detection from BLDC_tool, what does this mean?

I went through a lot of the documentation but..

Is this a good back emf plot? I assume not.

Sadly the guy hasn't been on the forum in 3 years I don't think he will send the app.
