[My original DIY Electric Mini Cruiser Skateboard](http://runplayback.com/how-i-built-a-diy-eboard) still holds up quite nicely even after 6 months of hard riding and natural wear and tear. But as with all things DIY, parts can always be upgraded. I think I've hit the next phase of DIY where I'm able to port certain parts into new builds and experiment with different configurations because I've accumulated extras. One key feature that I wanted to improve upon was weight, so once again, I researched the right combination of components to make an already awesome commute even better. I've nicknamed this build - the A2ESK8 Mini Cruiser.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7a84d061c732e58299e180610a868ca60a66f9c3.jpg" width="690" height="388">

30" Hi5ber Ion 30 Carbon Fiber Deck
Carvon V2 Single Hub Motor
ABEC11 90mm Flywheels
Custom 12s1p LiFePO4 Battery
Custom ABS Enclosure
Ollin Board Co. VESC
Kaly 2.4ghz Nano Remote

Dialing in the VESC settings is critical for creating a safe and fun mini cruiser, especially after seeing a few friends get hurt. My original build was capable of hitting 31 mph but the sweet spot for a board this small is around 15-18 mph - more than enough for carving through a dense city filled with intersections and pedestrians. Also, the 12s LiFePO4 battery delivers a stronger punch than my 10s lithium ion with a more stable discharge and minimal voltage sag. As much as I enjoy releasing the full power and speed from a DIY eboard, there's something quite satisfying about taming a mini cruiser eboard that has the ability to hurl you but won't because you're keeping it on a leash. But I digress - for all you beefy, power hungry dudes who only like riding face rockets, this build probably isn't for you. But for anyone else - [you can read my full, comprehensive breakdown article of this build here](http://runplayback.com/why-i-built-a-carbon-fiber-electric-skateboard-mini-cruiser). Also, check out this little test video that we did on the campus of Eastern Michigan University - the perfect board for campus cruising.

Haven't done a range test yet but I'm a lightweight 130 lbs and ride mostly on flats in a dense city so range will be fine for my needs. I'm having tons of fun riding this in the city because it's nearly silent on FOC mode and the ultralight 30" carbon fiber is very responsive to carving.

Did the nose guard come with the deck or did you attach it separately? Do you have any link to it if that is the case?

Awesome looking build!  Not to mention another great write up on your blog as well. I have to admit the benefits of lifepo4 are very enticing, I am surprised they're not used more in the diy scene. How did you go about selecting the BMS for your pack?  Wish I could see this in person!

The nose guard comes with the deck as well as the tail guard. It appears to be some kind of edge trim similar to this

https://www.trimlok.com/prod/Build-Your-Edge-Trim/Edge-Trims/All-Product-Categories_107/Edge-Trim-Product-Builder_87.aspx

I modded it slightly with a tail guard that I mounted on top as a footstop. It allows me to pop the board up a little easier because the kicktail is very mild.

@CRABOLSKY I'm still testing LiFePO4 but it just seems to be more efficient at discharging, although its a bit more bulkier than 18650 cells. The BMS was a generic from Alibaba but I just got the Bestech one that @treenutter recommended which is a lot more robust. I plan to install it soon because it's really well made.

http://www.bestechpower.com/384v12spcmbmspcbforlifepo4batterypack/products-2465.html

@whitepony weighs in at about 10lbs. I fluctuate between 125-130 lbs so range/power is hardly an issue for me especially on FOC/hub combo. The downtown in my city is pretty dense as well with pretty crappy streets so there aren't a lot of places to hit full throttle.

This is an awesome build!

Question:  I'm in process of building my own board and I'm curious about the anti-spark/on-off switch setup.  Am I right in saying that the anti-spark is a permanent connection on your system and then the on-off switch on the side of the enclosure does exactly that - completes the circuit?  Thanks in advance. :)

OK thanks.  I'm going to be using a standard 2x 3s LiPo setup, so I'm not sure I should be using a 12v switch rather than an Anti-Spark to complete my basic circuit - i.e. I won't have a BMS.

@Bender @FlashNova I probably should have weighed it before I built it but overall weight is about 10lbs with everything on it. Heavy duty option is for the vicious grip tape I believe. There was a special when I ordered it so the heavy duty came free. I've been eye'ing a Hi5ber deck for awhile and while it's definitely a premium price, it's totally worth it. They seem to have a deck for many different styles.

Just a quick update - I wanted more stability at higher speeds similar to my Spud deck so I increased the Hi5ber Ion 30 wheelbase to 20" by pushing out the trucks which I think enhances the profile. Also replaced the original generic voltage display with a better generic voltage display. :)

Just made some finishing touches on the 12s1p LiFePO4 battery pack: added some heat shrink around the cells and BMS, some neoprene foam on the outer tabs, added some hotglue to dampen the vibrations between the switch joints and some polyolefin heat shrink on the VESC. Also made a 1/16th ABS cover lined with 1/8" neoprene for some additional cushioning. Now I feel 100% confident riding this thing through rough terrain.

Hi
Now that you have tried this battery chemistry, how do you compare it to other battery cells like samsung 25R in the Space cell, in regards to the discharge current of each battery chemistry ?

I'll need to do more riding on it to give a better assessment, but just off the top of my head, it seems to have a more efficient discharge especially from standstill to full throttle. Feels a little smoother and the voltage sag isn't as dramatic as the 25R. Maybe I'm not riding it as hard but it doesn't seem to heat up as much either. I'm building a 12s2p battery next.

some questions here..

1- with this kind of battery (LiFePO4) is true that you can discharge the cells to zero without any damage or is like lipos?

2- with your setup how long the battery lasts?

i'm want to put a BMS on my esk8 and this thread is very helpful :)

You can't discharge below 2v with these cells or you will damage their capacity. Not sure where you found that. I cut mine off at 2.5v to be safe. They don't have much capacity after that anyways. 

Just for reference, I get about 5 miles with pack. I have a 6364 SK3 Instead. 180lb...

1 - yup that's right I would not discharge the cells to zero, it may not catch on fire but it will definitely degrade the capacity of the pack.

2 - i get under 10 miles on my pack - that's mainly riding on flats and my weight (130 lbs)
