Am I right to think that this is a bit low for a continuous rate? The FOCbox and the vesc 6 can do 50 and 60 respectively...?

If the heat dissipation is sufficient, a continuous current of 50a is also possible.

Very clean looking!
My main question is how it'll compare to something like the new mini fsesc 4.20? That's almost as small, and it can now also handle 12s and has a continuous 50a rate.

"Super mini" is no joke.

I like this.  I like this a lot.

But I also run very conservative settings, like battery max at 30A, et cetera

The only issue I see is those switches, once they have conformal coating brushed all over them (for waterproofing), they probably won't work anymore.

Always is a hard word, depends alot on the application. Electrolytic and MLCC's have different pros and cons where cost plays a big part. Technically you could use all MLCC's but it'll be alot more expensive to have caps that actually hold the promised capacitance (lets say for 60V and above). The trade off is to use both. Some MLCC that have alot lower ESR(filters higher frequencies alot better than the former)  and some Electrolytic that are alot cheaper and provides a much needed buffer for the ripplecurrents.

After all, the volume is small and the heat dissipation area is small.  If you attach it to a metal surface, you can get more continuous current.  Secondly, 1400w power is enough for ordinary electric skateboards. Usually, there is no need for continuous high current on the electric skateboard.

100 amp constant
[/quote]

You are talking down "chinese controllers" and expecting something different from this one? Where do you think it is made? This also seems to be pretty cheap.

I'm highly suspect of using a bank of ceramic capacitors in parallel to handle the high frequency switching from the battery. Ceramic capacitors have a low ESR for a relatively low amount of capacitance. That is why several dozen appear to be in use. But these are much much more likely to resonate with the input inductance and cause voltage transients double the input voltage.

They claim to have been tested, and I suppose it is possible to design a board with careful attention to this specification, but I can't imagine it increases the power threshold of the system, only reduces it.

I could be wrong but I think you really need electrolytic (benefit from) capacitors for filtering this amount of current switched at a high frequency.

I'm not good at technical parts of VESC yet, but can't we just set 100Amps limit and the temperature limit for 80°C and just safe to know what Amps continuous it can handle? This would be most visual test for the maximum load within the working temperature.

Or even in this case it can be blown up?

The software can help set limits, but this being new hardware it is yet to see what it is really capable of.

Based on the demos, they have only showed it running on a test bench. If they did an uphill test like evolve likes to do on the world steepest road, and showed live results from that... We would have something to go on.

You might set the limit to 100A and have it blow up at 75A because of transients introduced because of the balance capacitors. Or there could be some other flaw in the design. Or maybe it works perfectly, but it's highly suspect. I'm just saying that if what the manufacturer says is true, what they have done is extremely difficult and requires very good engineering design, better than what enertion has designed on the Focbox, which as best as I can tell is the best designed VESC based device out there except maybe the brand new 6.6 hardware from trampa.

And that is my real concern here, is if this is a copy paste type design the engineer may have looked at it and said "capacitor is a capacitor, we can put a bunch of small ceramic ones together". My guess someone more experienced already told them it was a bad idea, but they ran the tests a few dozen times and nothing blew up so they went ahead with the design.

The general feel of the company is that they saw a market, came in swooped up some free open source designs and are presenting it as a game changer.

You've got to ask why is nobody else using the ceramic capacitor? It is cheaper to do, so if there was a performance advantage other people would also be doing it.

where is it higher? the max draw is fairly small. 
The BoM for a VESC6 is 85-90 USD. If you dont use directFETs and skip the imu etc, abit less. 
So someone picking up cheap componenets stock and making motorcontrollers of it in china and slapping a price of 135 USD on it? Thers profit margins in there. Sure it will never be as good as the original VESC6, but thats not the intetion of the mini.

I went and did a little bit of research on this to back my ideas up, and I guess this is more OK than I thought. It is actually more expensive to do it this way as long as they are using capacitors that are rated for like 400 to 600v I guess it should be fine as long as they are using equivalent values that are correctly matched to the impedance.

Yes, again, I wrote exactly this like 40 posts up. 
I doubt the caps are above 100V tho. Maybe 4.7-10uF per cap tops if they're at that voltage rating. 
 
Impedance matching isn't super hard to calculate if you know half of what you're doing designing PCBs. However, Its always the real world performance that will show any disadvantages to the design. It will require testing before you can validate anything. 

I intend to use the minis i ordered at maybe 8S and I will still be using one or two ripple caps. For this application It will probably be fine.

Unfortunately for us, most likely we won't find out max performance, since if the maximum power is 1500W at 48V, which means 32 Amps max.

@Drom  People put 5-6kw through this motor... :-)


Okay......
Unfortunately, as some predicted (@linsus) I have problems with the x-esc :-( 
The moment i go over 50 amp in the vesc tool (motor amps or bat amps) The vesc just shuts down when applying a good amount of throttle from stand still :-/ My absolut max, is set at default (150 amps)

As mentioned above... I use this vesc with a e-bike hub wheel on 12s, in sensored FOC mode. I had problems with motor detection, but after i raised the "I" to 10 Amps.... and reduced the Erpms to 200, the detection was succeeded. I use a hand throttle, so the vesc is set up in ADC mode and only "Current"

I was hoping for a high current vesc, instead i got a low current vesc :stuck_out_tongue: 

I have 5 pcs 1000uF 63v low esr panasonic Caps. lying around. Could this maybe be a fix @linsus ??
I have contacted @YUTW123 But i do not have high hopes :-(

Btw. i have no fault / faults in the Terminal.... but given that the vesc just shuts down (reboots) the faults also got deleted right ??

Try the Caps, should help with the ripplecurrents atleast. Parallell em over DC input. 
Otherwise I'd try 10S and maybe you can reduce the spiking abit which is probably what is causing your situation. Regardless. I doubt you'll be able to draw 100+ amps if you're having trouble at 50A already. 
You might experience bit better performance if you avoid gunning the throttle. Then again, you'd probably never reach the currents you want with that kind of operation..

I doubt simply adding capacitors will solve this. It is probably due the mosfets and their design. Or some other design bug in the system. This was my concern with a manufacturer making claims that don't make sense when you compare them to what is already on the market.

Darn thought the XESC was going to be good. I'm glad I had my apprehensions about buying it. 
I'm thinking a UNITY at $199 is a much better deal, with my target of 80A.

Isn't a Unity a similar size to a pair of x-ESCs with the case?

So to conclude, the XESC 6.6 has an issue/flaw by design. It isn't capable to delive more than ~45A, which is pretty devastating considering size, wheight and cost. <-So a no go.

I purchased the "Super mini Makerx ESC" from them and got it on the last week. I didn't tested it yet because I'm a bit bussy lately. And I also had difficulties to get a test setup with telementry (metr pro) running because I missed/forgot that they use different (smaller) connectors (I think/hope that these are JST-ZH 1.5mm connectors we will see when mine arrive).
 
Anyway I made some pictures for a quick closer look (maybe an review when I got everything running) on the -in my opinion- more interesting **"MakerX mini FOC"**.

A nice touch, (I guess) they use some kind of routing packaging service for shipping to Germany, this way the package slipped through customs. I didn't had to paid tax or VAT for this one:wink: just the 135$ with quite fast (6 days) free shipping.

The ESC came well packaged in the small box whith proper antistatic foam+shelding bag. As silverline said about the 6.6 single the casing is an all aluminum nicely sandblasted and anodised (I love that kind of finish). It is also well labeled (It strongly remids of stewii's ESCape labling which, just so good tp read and such a clean look)

![image|515x387](upload://mZHWLwx4uxezTjgpokLjzrUgT6J.jpeg)   

It came with these accessories: 3 matching bullets for the motor wiring, a female XT60 for BAT to match the presoldered ESC, connectors with 5 cm of cable for PPM(3 pin)  and hall(6 pin) [? at leastI guess that] and also the usual cheap micro usb to usb-A.
![image|513x384](upload://xkL810rTDgb1vMsYWyomMmsRKkQ.jpeg) 

And now just as a comparison and to get a feel for the tiny size (I don't had a banana for scale and forgot to make a picture with something well known like a 18650) a Flipsky FSESC 6.6 (the one with housing and pushbutton Antispark)
Anyway the "mini FOC is really cute" . I didn't made a picture but I also weight the mini FOC with plugs, cable and it's heatsink housing **the mini FOC weighs just 86 g and is really small**.

![image|515x384](upload://b2EYqywimK68q5kZMoAINqOUloh.jpeg) 

Now the internals, they don't look bad even the small resistors are well soldered (even though some joints would be a bit happier with a tiny bit more flux, but we all know there is never enough flux). The curcuit board is well cleaned but not conformal coated (something I will add once it proves to meet my expectations in testing) 
*please curse me for making a picture in horizontal mode and sorry for the distortion

![image|311x419](upload://Aar5uBmNMfHaHrwY7IFyHi7Y6XE.jpeg)![image|311x418](upload://zyYF1pe9VAnX9ywNTYigREyfw1E.jpeg)

The heatsink/casing was thermal padded on both sides on expected heat sources, the compression overall OK but I think they should try to accommodate thinner thermal pads for better conductivity (thermal pads are not really well conductors after all)

Now a quick glance on the connectors, they are marked on the board when possible (it is on the casing anyway) but mostly not because it's so tight on the board. As I said these are not the usuall JST-PH 2.0 mm but instead something smaller, I think and hope it's a JST-ZH connector type 1.5 mm but it could also be a GH (1.25 mm) or SH (1.0 mm) I'm not really sure the time will tell (when my connectors arrive).

I have to admit that this ESC isn't planed to be used on an esk8 but on a reasonable sized ebike hub motor instead. It is reserved for my nicely looking NSU, just as a sweet everyday commuter. To get caught with an ilegal DIY ebike is way less likely than with an esk8 after all in germany (I will keep and ride my boards, calm down, just commuting will be with this one)

Did you really think the performance would be as good as a genuine vesc? Even the unity has had issues shutting down under high load of late. 

You can never believe the marketing claims of esc vendors without extensive lab and field testing to back up the claims. 

I think the only vescs that didn’t have this shutdown issue is genuine vesc 6 or clone or the old focbox.

Sorry you had a bad experience though. If only the performance was as good as the looks.

Thats why I buy a genuine vesc 6 now. 

But i was hoping that the x-esc would not just rebooting the moment i set it higher than 50amp in the GUI.

We are very sorry about your ESC and we will arrange a refund for you as soon as possible.  
and  You don't need to send the esc back.

You want to say that you will return the money to anyone who can't get 100A with maker-x 6.6? Doesn't it look like a bubble?

Please show that this is possible at all, because for now it looks like trying to sell as much as possible.

Got two MakerX mini FOC's for a dual hubmotor setup. Will test it in the next coming days. Arduino nano for comparison.
