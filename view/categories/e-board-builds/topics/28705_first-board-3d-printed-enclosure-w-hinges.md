Before the summer starts, I have an idea of building my first electric longboard before the fall semester. My goals are to learn more about electronics and wiring as well as have a cool transportation around campus. Fast forward couple months of research and help, I created this longboard.

Specs: 6 compact zippy batteries, 3 in series and 2 in parallel so 9s with torqueboard motor 190 kV 6355. I have NOT go full speed with this thing since I'm 120 lbs and have ZERO experience longboarding but all I can tell you is this thing is fast. 
Also in this summer I wanted to learn about 3d printing so I got myself an ANET A8 clone from gearbest. I has been the best decision I've made in a long time. Anyway I printed some enclosure and hinges and screw it on to the longboard. I want my batteries to lay flat instead of stacking on each other like I have on the picture but my parallel connect isn't long enough. **SO if you got to this part, I have a few questions for you.**

* Where can I find a reliable BMS for this 9s2p battery that I have?

* What charging port and charger do you recommend? 

My plan for right now is to make charging easier and also make my longboard waterproof.

I am interested to see what the longboard looks like, however the images haven't shown up!

Don't use photobucket as a host, either upload the pictures directly or use another service like imgur

You can share the designs 3d?

The black one is the reversible hinge but I can't seem to find it on thingiverse. I have the file though.

Nice lookin enclosure! I have been working on something similar

Did you print it upside down with the flat end on the bed   \ ____/ ?
or with support material like /-------\    ?

i printed it flat end on the bed \_____/. No support. If you have the file for motor cover and pulley cover please let me know. I like this enclosure because it breaks up in parts so it fits my 3d printer as well as allow the flex on the longboard.
