Today I start my build thread for my 6th build ! 

I wanted for a long time a convertible AT/Street board because we have the worst roads in Paris and I go very often in the coutry side with my girlfriend and I really want to go with her when she ride her horses ! 
It will be as well the last Belt drive board I ever build for me I think. I wan’t insane perf for good and the rest of the time i ll be on my hubs.

Expected specs : 
Battery : depends on Wich cells I choose ( konion, VTC6, 30Q please help me guys ! ) 
Speed : will use a classic ratio of 15/32 expecting 45 km/ h top speed. I have not ordered motors pulley yet so I’ll be happy to have any kind of advice on ratio because some of you might know I ride only hubs. 

Now the first past have arrived today ( already had the focbox and wheels ) next parts i wait for is dual mounts from UNIK , one more 6374 motor, figure out what battery i wan’t and build it.

You’ll have the chance to try it once the rain leave the country and the build is finished ! 
Yeah I tought for real I would go at one of their group ride and smoke them haha 

I am still really unsure of what cells I should choose for 4P 
Like 30Q are cheap and great but performance and capacity of VTC6 or konion could be really great

If someone reading this has a dead evolve ESC willing to give it to me so i can salvage the heatsink :slight_smile:

Super taff !!!

I won't, for sure, be using Evolve parts when I'll build my hybrid (Street/AT) esk8 but you did and still do a good job with this build. Hope to see it for real in Paris one day "once the rain leave the country" (if it really happens !!! :( )

That’s exactly what I tought first but in the end AT parts are just so expensive. The only way you can build a solid AT board for less than 1,5 k is evolve unfortunately
This will be a board that can compete with Kaly’s builds but for half the price

Curious how you do it with the motor cables, hopefully you don't screw it up. Use proper cable sleeves!

Are these motors sensored or not? I'll have a similar setup very soon (bit larger motors though). I got some 16T and 18T motor pulleys which I will combine with a 36 wheel pulley on 100 mm wheels using 15 mm belts and idlers.

It will be easy AF just gonna buy some sleeves for the cables and open a bit more the existing holes.
They are sensored and sealed.

I´m building a very similar board. With a 15/32 you will be flying with those motors. Remember that the evolve trucks aren´t the best for high speeds. I have the 15/38 with more than enough top speed.

What KV will your motors be?
If it´s a 190kv =
15/32 theoretical speed is 49+mph - 80 km/h :rocket::boom:
15/38 theoretical speed is 41+ mph - 67 km/h

Besides with a 38t wheel pulley you´ll have better torque.

@Powadangaboards @Kit @FredrikHems
I called them because they refused when I asked by mail. 
I lied and said I bought a GTX second hand and a car went over it and destroyed the deck the trucks and I acted really angry and disappointed and willing to ride asap. 
Then he said no problem tell me what you need. 
It was not available on their website you have to contact them to have those specific parts

@Flaco I will have 190 kv so i ll definitely use 38 teeth then 
I don’t need that much speed i never go above 60 km/h and i could use the extra torque with 107 mm

Yeah I plan on doing the same, I've been wanting a GTX but after already buying a CGT I feel that the price is not worth the product. I will like to do the same, and am now creating a parts list to follow through. What BMS are you using?

I feel like the Evolve ESC would be easier to use, do you think the FOCBOX is overall better?

The thing is, is that I am modding my CGT to have a better battery pack. I will eventually get the R2 for my CGT, leaving me with a free R1. I could save money by buying the Evolve ESC for the GTX build, but Im not sure if it is worth it. 

As for the BMS, I honestly have no clue what to use to replace the Evolve one.

30Q is the best cell out there at the moment if you take the overall picture.
VTC6 has some nice specs, but they lack hard when it comes to life cyles! They lose capacity really fast, making it worst than the 30Q at the same discharge rate. They are only worth for a race build for a couple of runs.

30Q!

I know that they retain 70% capacity at 300 cycles. So after 1- 2 years if you ride everyday you will still have about 70% of original left, not bad.

It's hard to say something about life cycles, because we're mostly charge them up to 4,2V and discharge them not all the way down and not with the maximum discharge rate.

Here is Mooch's test chart about just 50 cycles:

Heya Elsker, what makes the Focbox a better choice? Its $150 more than the evolve esc setup @ $370 total with shipping (Evolves ESC is at $200 total); I personally have had no issues with my CGT and I dig the R2 remote. Everyone says that Focbox is better, but why is that?

I've been on the phone for this week & last with a sales rep - they informed me I can purchase the part from them (though only over the phone).

As for the BMS...well, I can either use the one from my CGT (since I am building a 10s4p) or find a single BMS from a third party...most likely the latter since I was going to cut out the CGT BMS to use with the 10s4p I've made. Its been tough finding one so far though.

@Kit
If you want to use R2 remote, you need to use Evolve's ESC. There are no other choices.
In addition, you need to connect Evolve's BMS to Evolve's ESC.

@Lumaci
Although not listed on the Evolve website, their ESC can be purchase.
I have purchased it before.

[/quote]

Actually, credit where credit is due, the Evole ESC has an excellent braking curve.  Best brakes I've felt.  You can slam on the brakes at top speed and A) not get chucked off and B) stop soon

Not going into any other aspects of it though...

@b264  since you have a BGT, would you have the kindness to tell me wich screws are used for the enclosure ? I don’t have any. And it’s a special lenght i tried a few screws, that were too short or too long

How much was the total for these 3 parts Deck, Enclosure, and Trucks?

Why didn’t you order motors from them while your at it?

Did the motor mounts you ended up getting work like oem ones?

• I paid 400 for deck , dual trucks, enclosure ( trucks are really expensive 150 for both ) 
• because I wan’t larger, more powerfull motor. ( sleeker as well ) 
•yup, it’s like the OEM but way better quality. The only downside is no idler but i don’t mind. You just have to calculate the belt lenght you need in fonction of the number of teeth

I had 1 made in 6061 anodized black aluminium. It fit well but I paid €53 for it and thats too high. I tried with MANY manufacturers but that was the cheapest price. 

As @Toleg said, I had to cut these parts, which is why Ill design the heatsink so you can take the FOCBOX's apart. 

If there is intereset, I guess i could have these mass produced so price goes down, but since Im in Switzerland, shipping will be very expensive!

If you PM me your e-mail, I can send you the file.

Why not get a 6mm spacer to replace the stock gtx gasket? This slightly lowers the case, but it makes space for the bms, since there is already a 6mm routed area in the battery area on the deck. I actually was able to get my bms to fit in there...the 6mm of extra gasket allows for the 10s4p batteries to completely fill up the case & still attach cleanly to the deck, with room for the VESC's and BMS now. Wiring would be tight for the focs but doable. 

Here is a pic of the BMS in the routed area, without the 6mm gasket.

This is what mine looks like with 1/4"/6.35mm weatherstripping foam. I outlined the gasket by tracing the battery case; tbh it doesn't look clean since I cut with scissors, should've gone all the way with a xacto instead of the rounded corners. I left enough space for the BMS in the routed area and filled the rest of it with the foam, since the 10s4p height encompasses only the battery case. 

![20180513_200028|374x500](upload://HcV7vbadgX3zNrTmiVdNTR1yOy.jpg)

This is my 10s5p in a cut gen 3 batt. case.The 4p fits by taking up the space meant for the bms, length-wise; height-wise, the pack sits flush with this case & will not protrude into the routed area on the deck, as long as I have the extra 6mm gasket on there. Atm I only have my 5p to show in the above image; I cut the case to see if I could attach the extender I posted from earlier in the thread, to make this a 10s5p pack.

I purchased the foam from amazon [here.](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0774B97HZ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

I also know a couple of Evolve ambassadors from local group rides and am waiting for them to sell me their dying/soon to be dead stock batt. packs, for the BMS; I could get one as well for you if you'd like @ElskerShadow .

@pjotr47 made my battery pack, and they are killer! For the BMS, I think you could use this one:

http://bestechpower.com/444v12spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCB-D345.html

It's from a known source, has an on/off switch, 60a is plenty enough for a 3p battery and it's available for 12s. Also, Pjotr has 1 in stock, so if you are not wanting to make your own, he could help out with the battery and BMS because Bestech have a MOQ of 2!

Or as @Kit it suggested, just get a some foam/rubber sheets and raise the enclosure.

Due to the low profile enclosure I guess you can only go with a flat diagram. Mine 10s3p takes around 34-35 once wrapped. 12s3p is goos but I will be afraid of voltage sag with a 12s, maybe would be a nice spot. Or use a small bms only for charge to gain the space you need.

Sounds, good. Also in my build the bms was a pain in the ass. Once you get at 10s, with decent discard they became huge. Next time I will go for a micro bms, charge only. I see most of the powerfull builds are equipped with charge only bms.

PS: Sorry to go off topic one second, but your wish became true. THe meepo style hubs are now with replaceable wheels.

Sure, I always thought a discharge bms will hep to keep the cells balanced but if they are quality cells it shouldn't be a problem. You can alway find a bms with bluetooth so you can check the cells in series. then if you can use a small bms you would have enough space for a 4p.

On the forum someone used some micro bms, but if I remember correctly they were for 12 or 13s. Otherwise one of the http://bestechpower.com/407v11spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/ will od the job. They can b rather small. I do not know how much deep is your enclosure, becusae they will take roughly 8mm in height and maybe you can place it on top.

If you need a micro bms you could use @Deckoz’s micro bms from his evo build. I think it’s for 13s but you can just drop the last 3 leads and it will function like a 10s bms.

Bullet instead X90, definitly a good idea ! will do that too.
I've found a .stl to add more height, but i want the slimest case as possible.

but i strongly recommend that you keep the balance wire in your pack, event you didn't use a BMS.
You'll have to check sometimes if you have no drift on your cells.

Yeah don't worry it's anticipated! I will check voltage drift every 200 km
Shouldn't be any issues with quality cells

I 3D printed a extra distance on the hatch,  so I got extra storage underneath my focboxes to fit a BMS there. + I added some rubber around my enclosure since I wanted to avoid routing the deck.( I have the normal bamboo GT deck. )  

its so nice to ride on :heart_eyes:

Sweet clone. 
I’ve had a carbon GT for two years and rode the hell out of it. The battery got to the point it would barely get 5 miles before 50% drain. Prismatic cells just don’t have the cycle life.  So after about 4 months of it laying around I had some extra cells from battery builds and I replaced the flat pack with Samsung 30q.  
I also replaced the motors ( very worn ) and with the extra space the 10s4p cell pack left fit in a 3s light kit stand alone 12.4v pack ( Samsung of course )
Rides like a new board. I haven’t tested the range yet. Did do a test run of 4 miles on full charge at the end 97% capacity and no sag. Granted the volt sag will come later in the ride regardless. As long as I still use the stock bms and esc unit. 
But for a revamp not bad on the pocket book.

Actualy even if you would have replaced the battery on day one you would have no sag and same amazing range :)
EVOLVE is clearly a scam in some way, they charge so much money for Chinese bad quality part

Yea, I totally agree on the scam part. They really did something cool and of course went cheep and high price. Even their replacement parts are sky high. I carry the exact same motors for 85 and they sell for 190. 
The remake of the sidewinder truck ( gul wing). Innovative  but could be priced better.  
It’s truly one way they have gotten so big so fast. 
That’s why I love the diy community. Getting into this stuff and really bringing it for the end user not the end profit.

You can either mill down the deck to gain space or if it's enough there is this nice model on thingiverse Evolve Bamboo GT Enclosure Riser found on #Thingiverse https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2965134

With the 80A BMS the riser needs to be 15 mm high or so which I would like to avoid.

Yeah splitting the BMS or using the smaller 60 A BMS from the Enertion spacecell could be another option. Don’t have a mill therefore not possible to recess the thing into the deck.

I will not use a BMS there's definitely not enough space in the end. I actually like to have a push button.But I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing. If the battery is properly checked after everything should be fine 
 I have yet to try XT90s ! How it is ? It's like a loop key but without the spark ?
I am eager for integrated antispark...

Focbox or unity will do well with your size. Your limited on your battery size with a carbon GT. A GTX you can add a printed riser and go big on the battery. 
10s5p

Without a spacer, 10s4p with a small BMS plus VESCs for Unity. You'll need to get creative with space and you'll need to remove a bit of timber from the deck where the VESCs will sit.
