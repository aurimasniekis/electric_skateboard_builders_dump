The one to rule them all - after my last build with 99wh batteries meant for air travel was quite weak, it left me with a hunger for more, so now I'm going all out. Normally I'd be on quite a strict budget, but recently I took on a new weekend job so $$ shouldn't be as much of a concern. Ideally this will be my last board for a long time, my daily driver and one that I can take to college so I am sparing nothing here. Starting off - I'm using the very first deck that I got off a cheap build on amazon. The brand is "White Wave", sorta generic, but for $40 it somehow manages to still be the most comfortable thing I've ridden. 

Here's the parts list so far:
-100mm green MBS wheels
-@Treenutter custom drop-deck
-Caliber II clone trucks
-192Kv SK3
-Torqueboards mount and 16/36 gears

Still to get:
-12s (ideally 5p) battery (Samsung 30Q cells? so 15,000 mah) - 
-enclosure - probably something stealthy from @psychotiller
-ESC - 12s esc? VESC? Idk... 

A few pictures to start off:

I 3d printed a modified version of @FLATLINEcustoms topmount covers to fit the first deck and they look fantastic after a bit of sanding and light dremel work. Blue and green don't exactly match, but I can always paint it later. Definitely props to him for designing such ingenious plugs, although it'll be interesting trying to get LED's/Loop key working on one side while the voltage meter is doing its thing on the other side... anyone know how long wires should get before heat issues?

EDIT: Deck has been changed to an @Treenutter custom drop-deck. Should be better than the flexy one I was planning to use previously

thats a ridiculously large battery. back then i made a 10S6P battery for my evolve carbon, giving me 50km range on pneumatics, ie close to 100km on sk8wheels. you just cant ride that long!

the perfect size imo is around 40cells with skatewheels. gives you 30-50km range depending on throttle.

if you still want to go for that monster: with so many cells you can easily use the cheaper sanyo ga for even more capacity!

@whitepony @Namasaki @Titoxd10001 
My reasoning for the crazy battery is that I have had really small batteries in the past and been disappointed with the range and speed at times. With my new system on this board since it's really stable I figured SPEED is #1 priority (looking ~35mph), closely followed by a range of 25-30 miles. I don't know exactly what battery would get me that but my SK3 has been good with about 90% efficiency in the past. What configuration/cells would you recommend for something that gets me this? This is also looking to be my first time building a battery, however I do have some friends who specialize in this area to help me with the process

It depends a lot on riding style I would say, also rider weight and gearing. I have similar setup with MBS wheels, 190kv motors, 15/40 gearing, but with 11s4p 25r cells I get about 16 mile range before I feel the low voltage kicking in. I'm a heavier rider and drive pretty aggressively though. I would probably go with 12s5p with 30q cells next time for 20+ mile range and less stress on individual cells. A big con of a bigger battery of course is weight.

@anorak234 what kind of range you looking for?

I would say go with 12s5p with 30q cells. That's already a heavy battery but 8p is way too much. How do you plan to make the battery flexible?

I know the deck is a challenge - but I just love this thing. It's the most comfortable ride ever, even compared to my friend's vanguard. For the flexible battery, I was thinking maybe I could spot weld all of the parallel groups, and then use 3d printed sleds and solder the groups in series with flexible wire and add the balancing cables. Something like @Ackmaniac's build 
 
And here's my diagram (blue is balancing cable) and the file I designed for the 18650 sleds:

To save space, the packs would be built so that it's all in 2 layers

It seems too flexy, you might split your enclosure for this set up. I had about the same flex as yours. I ended up adding 2 layers of GF 200g/m2 on top  of the board and 2 layers 200g/m2 unidirectional CF, and 4 layers of Twill weave 200g/m2 CF on bottom of the board. It's 2 layers of GF and 6 layers of CF in total. Only now it seems stiff enough. I'm 93kg.

I have been riding the exact same deck and was originally running a one piece enclosure with no problems. Put your feet in their riding location and see how much the board flexes by jumping but not letting your feet leave the board... sounds kinda crazy but this is far more accurate in relation to ride flex versus using it like a trampoline.

Ok so to solve the problem of flex I decided to purchase an @Treenutter custom deck. Thanks for the offer @flywithgriff but I think I'm going to keep my white wave deck, as it's the first one I ever owned.  Also wondering... since my 12s ESC never arrived, I'm thinking of maybe getting a VESC which I've never tried out before due to the high price and rate of failure. How well would a VESC hold up in BDLC with my 190kv motor + 100mm wheels + 16:36 ratio?
```

## \#16 Posted by: t0m_r1dd1e Posted at: 2017-05-11T16:53:58.043Z Reads: 410

```
VESC is the way to go. And if this is your end all board, why not go dual drive? I'm running dual drive 12s4p with VESCs in BLDC and it's beastly. You sure you're going to have clearance to stack your battery? I'm using a Never Summer double drop and I had to bottom-mount my trucks to get clearance just for my single-layer battery. (PS my deck is about as flexy as your first one looked and I built my battery in sections like you were talking about, works perfect).
With wheels that big, you're looking at a 35mph top speed on 12s. I'd drop your motor pulley down to like 14 teeth for more torque, especially if you're sticking with single drive.

@t0m_r1dd1e thanks for the suggestions! My reasoning for 1 wheel drive is that the system I have has been flawless from the beginning with my 6374, and I won't be climbing many hills. Also, if I do drop the pulley down to 14t how much of a difference does that make with the reliability of the VESC? This thing should be a speed demon... I'm hoping to max out unless it's bad for whatever ESC I use.

```
Running a smaller motor pulley will mean that it will take less amps to get the same amount of acceleration, so it would be better for the VESC I guess. I wouldn't worry about reliability too much though. I haven't really heard of VESCs randomly dying in BLDC mode. I haven't had any issues with two of them after 400 or so miles. I have my ERPM limit set to 58000, so no chance of over-driving frying my DRV chip. 

Also, check out this calculator if you haven't seen it. Super useful: http://calc.esk8.it/

```
I've seen the calculator - the problem I found with it is that it calculates using nominal voltage, not charged voltage. With my current plan the calculator shows 57K in max ERPMs, however I know realistically it will be more than that. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the VESC can only handle 60K? You mentioned that you could limit ERPM on the VESC, is that something where if I'm bombing a hill it will be able to handle automatically?

Exactly. It will apply brakes (gently) so you don't go over whatever limit you set.

Ok so I know it's been a ridiculously long amount of time since I updated this thread, but I was in Germany for the summer and now that school has started it's always about time management. Anyways, the deck I ordered from @treenutter arrived and it looks amazing, I made a separate topic about it if you click here: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/best-deck-ever/31223

My BMS and charger arrived, and things are showing up ever so slowly. A Sunkko spot welder is also on the way, so maybe I can finally get this battery thing dealt with. No longer worried about making it flexible with the new deck. 

I also took the liberty of designing a **3d-printable trailer-hitch** that utilizes the riser area of the deck, so that I can tow my trailer (work in progress) on weekend camping trips with the board.

I will post the stl file for public use if the initial trials are successful. 

Finally, despite @treenutter's statement that my Shuggah deck was not compatible with pneumatics, I may have broken the rules. A combination of my terrible ability to follow directions and determination to have a hybrid board that can be switched in minutes have made this dream finally come true...

@anorak234 I love it when I'm wrong! So glad you took the time to experiment with this! Did you need to use big risers to get enough clearance? I hadn't even considered skikes when I tested this deck with pneumies, so glad they fit. How're you gonna grip it? What enclosure will you use? Awesome build!

I'm using angles half inch to 1/16 inch risers, that helps a little. I was going to do a custom grip but my local skate shop has this one guy that does clear grip like you've never seen before - almost everyone here has given up on gripping there own boards üòÇ. For the enclosure, I'll probably go the @psychotiller route as he's the only one still taking custom orders in any shape and I've had good experiences with his enclosures in the past. Under NO circumstances will I be drilling this board through... I'll go with @Jinra's steel rivet idea

Look at threaded inserts, they work well and look great as they don't go all the way through the deck.  I've actually started using wide thread sheet metal screws, usually 1/2 inch as they snug up well, make a very small hole, are zinc oxide coated so blend into the enclosure well, and a drop of wood glue makes them virtually unmovable until you actually put a screw driver on them.

I'm hoping you could give some insight here. I'm looking at the shuggah deck and also the bludgeon deck. It's a toss up. Do you think there is enough room for a set of 50x150 six shooters using the shuggah deck?

Made some progress tonight - eBay batteries for testing. I‚Äôm still deciding if it‚Äôs best to use them in my final build or not...

I have 3 of them, which should provide a solid 60 amps in parallel but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs enough. Is it necessary to buy more? 
For those guys that use pneumatics, do you know how many amps you pull on easy terrain like grass and flat dirt? I‚Äôm not doing any serious off-road stuff with this board, so I‚Äôm only worried about normal tolerances and getting up my driveway for now.

Also on the note of pneumatics, I am looking for tubes for my 5‚Äù. They are from skike and look like this:

I‚Äôm willing to pay anyone a little extra if they could purchase some in Europe and ship it to me in order to avoid the hefty handling fee.

Final two notes - I have the torque boards 120amp ESC which runs exceptionally hot. Should I make a separate enclosure for it, or is there a way I could deal with the heat? Maybe I can split the 12 to 5V converter in parallel and use that for a fan?

Been riding for a while now. Got stopped by a cop who thought it was pretty cool, and a couple who thought I should sell them for a living... anyways right now I‚Äôm stopped for lunch at the Stoneridge mall (California Pizza Kitchen), letting the board cool down so that I can get some more speed later. Ended up hitting many more hills than expected, and my ESC still has the overheating problem. It doesn‚Äôt turn off - just decides to go 10 mph indefinitely. I guess that‚Äôs good for range...

Here are the results so far, I‚Äôll post the finished ride later. Idk if I‚Äôm even going to be able to finish, still got more than 40 volts on this thing:

Honestly, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve never seen it anywhere. I was breaking on a hill and suddenly my board went diagonal, like the board was angled and I barely kept my balance. The wheels weren‚Äôt straight, one of the bolts fell out, and I had to stop and carry my board up the hill to fetch it. When I picked up my board I saw what happened

No seriously though, I think these might really hurt somebody if I crash. Probably gonna get some covers to make the bolts look even more badass. Anyways I'll be moving these beautiful 6 inch pnuematics to the redember deck once I finish stickerbombing the enclosure (So far all I have is a settlers of Catan sticker and @psychotiller stickers XD) and dealing with a 12s @torqueboards ESC issue, as it tends to overheat and I am not about to cut a giant hole in my enclosure to solve the problem. Maybe recycling an old xbox heatsink would do the trick? 
![666_2|500x500](upload://c9QFI60sDkFg06gsLextBhlybLX.jpg)
It's freaking huge, but I have the space in my enclosure. More worried about the weight at this point, my board is quickly approaching 50 pounds.

Now that I have acquired two gopros and some accessories, I‚Äôll be making videos while riding the board. I also plan to make one on the cost of a board like this... I got rediculously lucky with timing on certain items as the entire setup didn‚Äôt cost that much:

Pneumatic wheels 
Enclosures - 85$
10S6P Batteries/Charger - 120$ shipped (eBay deal, cheap amazon charger hacked up to xt60)
Drivetrain/Motor Setup/trucks - 250$ (Torqueboards V3 Kit, with discount Code)
Deck - 110$
12S ESC - 75$ (used, got partial refund due to some problems)
Misc - 25$
Total = about 750$

Keep in mind, I could‚Äôve also saved money by not using the expensive deck, which would‚Äôve potentially kept the cost below 600$ (I would never do that though because this is one of the best decks I‚Äôve ever ridden)

P.S. - for new members, this price isn‚Äôt not realistic for 99% of boards, and I fully intend to spend more money and upgrade to things like Aluminum hubs and a FOCBOX later, so please don‚Äôt expect your first board to be like this. Also, this took a metric shit-ton of hours to complete the right way, the key is just to be patient and use your build thread to ask questions that the search bar can‚Äôt answer for you. Good luck, and I hope you enjoyed this build!

Just a little update... Startup and torque was a little lacking on a 10s 16:34T setup on 6‚Äù pnuemies, so i bought a 12t pulley. In order to avoid having to buy different size belts I just made a make-shift tensioner with the extra hole in my @torqueboards V3 mount.
Super great torque now!

I heart this build!  

In fact, I think your design, quite literally, represents state of the art for indie electric completes.  Seeing that all the major components are sourced from this community... simply stellar, my brother.

My only suggestion is to consider "what-if" those extended bolts deform after impact with a curb (fine, kerb ;) )

The first build I was also having overheating issues with TB 12s esc. My solution was installing a fan on top of the heat sink. Now no overheating issues. Another piece of advice is place a dime size amount of epoxy around the center of the fan. If this is not done, the fan blade will eventually come apart from all the vibration. ![GEDC0200 (640x428)|640x428](upload://fHtr2J0bEEmtIAeovq906CQuYWp.jpg)
