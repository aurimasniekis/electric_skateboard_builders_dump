Hello people!)

How can I mount this gear?
This gear fails in a wheel.

You will have to drill through your wheel to attach the gear. I would use a couple of big washers to make the gear stick out more.

Make sure the gear is center when it is drilled into the wheel. I had an issue where it wasn't perfectly centered and it causes tension issues in the belt if it's tight.
