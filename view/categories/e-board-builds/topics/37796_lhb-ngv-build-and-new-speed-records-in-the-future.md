By the way, red light makes it hotter, not faster. Orange  or blue light makes your board faster.
The addition of the sword gives it +5 strength but -2Hp

My question wasn't hub motors the best for top speed but the problem just the urethane how are you going to keep the urethane from coming off and wasn't NGV the team using like some expensive rollercoaster urethane
```

they are using the expensive roller coaster urethane NOW in reaction to the thane flying off in the video back THEN. So the expensive roller coster thane is a fix. 

We'll find out if it works.
