I know they are fairly low cost and cheap, but it's my first build so I'm going cheap just to get something that will work and so I can refine my ideas of building. If anyone has a good idea for a board and some better mounts/pulleys that would work with caliber II trucks, it would be appreciated to tell me.

Stay away from that pulley and mount kit. 

Hit up @dickyho for a budget mount, he can also probably get you a motor and esc.

I wouldn't buy anything esk8 from Walmart.  Ever. 

Diyeboard is banned from this site for bad business practices.

As stated, do not buy that ESC, because you dont want to be going really fast and have your board suddenly brake or just not respond at all to inputs.... then you better be wearing slide gloves.

Would hope to use either a metal or 3D printed container. Dont know what deck im getting yet, but I hoped it would have enough space. Would it be better to go for 2 3s's?

## \#10 Posted by: infiniteoffset Posted at: 2019-06-14T07:04:40.196Z Reads: 91

2x3S would use width of the board better. Space shouldn't be a problem, but height might be. I'm dealing with similar problem, I have 45mm high lipo. It should fit without a problem, but ground clearance will be reduced. I just hope it won't be a big problem once the board is assembled.

Since the battery width is not that big, you might plan to place some components next to it. That's what I was wondering as well. But it depends on size of the deck.

Yah, I was also hoping to leave some room to expand on another battery in parallel for longer drive time later on. 

Looked farther at Dickyho's page and came up with this stuff.

They might end up being slightly more than the 260kv set I listed above, but with a better kv and better esc. Would I need to use 10s with these or would 6s still work?
```

```
What do you mean by better kv? Kv doesnt determine the quality of the motor. You probably want to go with lower kv like 190kv since you are going single drive. Lower kv means more torque but less rotations per minute (rpm). With higher kv your rpm will be higher but you will sacrafice torque.
```

That is what I meant by better. The slightly lower KV would be better, atleast for my purposes since Im not going for speed and would prefer the torque.

**input battery Voltage: 6S/ 7S/ 10S LIPO.  (It Can not be for all voltage!! please choose which Voltage you need when making order )**

Unless you're like 90lb i wouldn't go single 50xx motors. (Even if you are i wouldn't) 

If going 50xx (5055-5065) gotta be dual. 

If you wanna go single get 60xx motors.  Preferably 6365-6374.

Yes. Imagine lever. The further you are the less force you need to achieve same torque. Bigger motor = bigger lever.

Few lines down in the same product description

[quote=""]
**How to change the input voltage.**

 please see the picture,there's a bridge marked as 6S, and a bridge marked 7S.  if the 6S bridge connected, then it is 6S version. if the 7S connected, then it is a 7S version.  if both disconnected, then it is a 10S version.

So as far as I understand it, you can modify it for different voltage, you just need to change bridges, you can't just connect different voltage.

You can get some components cheaper, but that's up to you. You won't save significant amount.

My friend, I am gonna write smt on the esc-motor part.. Its understandable to choose an esc + remote set but the power output of that circuit is low.. 10A.. 350W.. (This power level is only adequate for the hoverboard motors) Your outrunners will draw well above 1000W and that current level will burn your esc.. state of the art right now is the vescs.. If we investigate their minimum current supply level is 50A.. Besides, these kit-type circuits are not recommended.. Not by me, at least :)

Dickyho mounts are good quality. Dickyho is not manufacturing that ESC afaik, he is just selling it.

For some people that ESC is good enough

Did you ask the question to me ? :) I was talking about the esc in the question, that Dickyho store has both vesc type and kit type escs, one should investigate the output power of those circuits.. Then, after purchase, must be tested in real usage of course.. sometimes, in the field we cannot get the manufacturer specs out of the products you know..

The main difference between motors of the same kv but different size is heat displacement.

A single 60xx can handle that alot better

I decided to use ZOP 6S 8000mAh for my build, it cost $60 when using coupon "ZOPower2". Try to look at my build topic, there are links. Keep in mind that ZOP batteries are not high in C-rating, but since the capacity is so high, it shouldn't be a problem.

That Kinexsis is probable ok brand since horizonhobby sells it, but this particular one has been discounted so the ebay seller is selling old supplies. Old lipos perform worse. 

EDIT: That Kinnexsis is used battery. I would not buy used lipo, you never know what previous owner did with it.
