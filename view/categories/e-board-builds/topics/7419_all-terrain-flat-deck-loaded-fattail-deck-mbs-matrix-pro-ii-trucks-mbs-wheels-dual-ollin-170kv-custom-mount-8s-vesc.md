EDIT: Here are a couple of pics of the final build, turned out awesome :slight_smile:

I'm new here, Hi! I thought it might be interesting to share my first build as it goes. I live in rural New Zealand, so wanted a board that was good off-road, but more for a cruise by the river with my kids on their bikes, rather than a full on mountain-board. I've not done very much skating, so a lot of this is unfamiliar, but I surf and snowboard so can handle riding a board. And I've built and flown a bunch of quadcopters, the electrics are similar.

So when I looked into just buying an electric skateboard, the Evolve Bamboo GT was looking about right. Only problem is, it's not out yet, and they don't even ship to New Zealand. So screw em, I'll build my own! 

First up was deciding the deck/trucks/wheels, and I've just now got that all together. It's looking like this

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/1f8ae274a879fdf0e7b84d447d000a67eb524a76.JPG" width="666" height="500">

I went with MBS wheels and (Matrix ii pro) trucks, the options for offroad wheels and trucks are pretty limited as far as I could find, and these looked the best. The mountainboard trucks made things a bit tricky, mountainboards have a tilted deck where the trucks are mounted, and I hadn't considered how that would screw up turning with a flat deck. So I had to build some sort of wedge to rotate the trucks out by ~30-40 degrees.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/e73e365292d16d817619e9cc36e03d2acc8cd69d.JPG" width="666" height="500">

The simplest easiest thing I came up with was to use plywood. I got a half sheet of 12mm ply, cut it into a few smaller pieces, and glued it together with contact adhesive into a 6 thick 72mm brick. I then cut it diagonally with a hand saw which gave me the two wedges. I hand drilled holes for the trucks first, I needed to buy a few longer M5 bolts, and get a bit creative with the drilling. Then I drilled holes to mount to the deck, didn't worry about nuts for that, just drilled long 4.5mm holes and screwed the M5 bolts in.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/25a09c571b0ac54a02ec489d0b1f62ab5d8f115b.JPG" width="375" height="500">

I chose the loaded fattail deck because I liked the design and I thought the shape might work OK with the wheels. Not sure if that will turn out to be a good choice, but I do love the deck. It has loads of flex which I love, but it might snap? Dunno.

Next up (once I've had a bunch of fun just riding this thing down bumpy hills) is to build the motor mount. I plan to use ply for that too. I've already got pulleys and belts, that was hard for these big wheels! I eventually found a combo that seemed OK. It's all plastic, might wear quickly, belt isn't really what I wanted, but easy to work with, and in stock. 78T big pulley, 16T little, using a 9.5mm XL belt and I've got the emax GT 5345 170kv motors (EDIT/SPOILER I broke one of these later, went with Ollin 170kv motors instead), Enertion VESCS and will be going 8S LiPo, maybe 12S.

Any of this stuff might fail, and I'll no doubt end up making everything out of aluminium not plywood, like mostly everyone seems to, but for now I'm just enjoying giving it a go. Fun times!

I started work on attaching the pulleys today. The MBS hubs come with 5 M4x35 bolts connecting the two sides together, so longer hub bolts should work for attaching the pulleys. I drilled out the inner core of the pulleys, just large enough to avoid touching the trucks. Did it by drilling a bunch of small holes, some cutters and sandpaper. Then drilled the 5 bolt holes. Getting exact locations for the holes was a bit tricky with my limited expertise, and I knew I had to get this as perfect as possible.  I used digital calipers to measure everything up, and scrape the hole radius on.

My M4x50 bolts are too short, the bolt that's in there is only just screwed on at the other end, and the pulley is touching the wheel. I sort of knew that would be the case, 50mm was all I could find locally. I have some 60mm ones on order that should be perfect. I'm using a bunch of nuts as spacers between the pulley and hub, can't seem to find a source for 10-20mm M4 spacers.

I decided to tidy up the plywood wedges a little, round off the edges and give them a coat of varnish, mostly for water/damage protection.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/8307afea6f42cd0ad6291d1f7fb3093daf5f357a.JPG" width="666" height="500">

I've also been thinking a lot about the motor mounts, think I have a good design that will be strong enough just made with plywood, though I've ordered an aluminium bar, in case plywood doesn't work out. It turns out that the MBS Matrix trucks have an M8 threaded hole in them in a pretty perfect place to bolt on a motor mount, so that's going to be a huge help.

I'm a little worried about the XL belt/pulley thread still, haven't seen much on how that compares to HTD, they both have "5mm pitch" ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I took the board out for a ride down the paddocks yesterday without any electrics, and it's super fun, even in muddy damp cowpat covered grass. The two issues were lack of brakes, and having to walk back up the hill, and the motors will fix them both. Can't wait!

Started work on the motor mounts. The profile on these matrix pro trucks is crazy, but I think I have a snug enough fit, and that bolt should keep everything secure. This just might work.

First major screw up, I wanted to see if the pulley would fit OK, so I drilled out the hole to 7.5mm and banged it on to the 8mm motor shaft with a rubber hammer. Fits great, only problem is I can't get it off, and now I would need to drill too large a hole in the motor mount. The motor bolts would be too close to the shaft hole so it wouldn't be strong enough.

I might cut a slot from the end and slide it down.

Second major screw up, after getting that pulley off, I assembled a decent enough motor mount, attached the motor then started banging the pulley on with a rubber hammer again. I just needed it to go down another 2mm, but it wouldn't budge and I think I went to far and the motor bearings are shot. The motor now has quite a bit of play and makes some noise when I spin it.

Doh, a costly mistake. I now have a pair of 170kv 5065s on my way from Ollin Board Company. Should be a lot better than the emax motors anyway, and I won't make these mistakes again! 

I was gonna call this board the Barney Rubble, but I think Bamm Bamm might be more appropriate.

The drive chain is getting close to functional now. Love the Ollin Board Company motors design, lighter and smaller than the emax ones, I'm sure they'll be much better. My aluminium bar showed up too so I was able to make a much better motor mount. I'll keep the plywood part though. Had to cut that back a bit to give more space for the wheel pulley.

I apologize if all my replying to my own thread is annoying anyone, it just seems appropriate to keep a kind of public build journal here. Please tell me if you'd rather I keep it down!

So after tonight's work I have a powertrain, though probably not a usable one.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/4481add4bfbf39c69de3773350c890efe8eb6b26.JPG" width="666" height="500">

I have a couple of issues, one is that the tight belt is pulling/twisting everything towards the wheel, which is bending the plywood so the belt wants to slide up towards the wheel. I may have to totally ditch the ply for that reason, which I sort of knew but hoped I could get away with, you do definitely need a rigid motor mount.

The other issue is this:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/9/9dabb0eb4e539d523526a3ac0682a59aa43c6a64.JPG" width="666" height="500">

I hand drilled from the other side to enlarge the pulley bore, and got a horrifically off-center result. It's unusable in this state, when I twist the motor it oscillates strongly as it pulls uphill and downhill, so that's two motor pulleys I've ruined now.

So I am thinking I'll move to an aluminium motor pulley, and invest in a drill press. My inability to drill straight holes is causing me a bunch of problems.

I definitely learned my lesson with putting the motor pulley on though. This time I drilled a 1/32 inch hole, which gave me just under 8mm, and it was a nice tight fit, which could be easily pushed down with that pulley removal tool I now possess, no hammering involved.

So now I wait for new pulleys I guess. I assembled it in place just to check the motors weren't going to get in the way, and it's looking good.

Feeling way more positive after tonight's work! 

I went and bought myself a drill press today, and it has already transformed my life. Seriously, You need one.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/3/3692d9b67f632e8b7256afa72502c92a6f629b9f.JPG" width="666" height="500">

With it I was able to resurrect the motor pulley that was banged on too hard. I had somehow with pure clairvoyance bought 3 pulleys. That one with the diagonal hole is no good but I still have two not totally destroyed pulleys left for my dual motor plan. With the straight drilled pulley and the belt tensioned properly, things were looking pretty good, but I wasn't happy with the softness of the plywood mount. If I yanked on it, the plywood compressed and everything got loose. 

So the new drill was put to work on an aluminium based motor mount.  I drilled a bunch of holes in some of that 2 inch by 1/4 inch aluminium bar to try to once again make a hole the size of the MBS Matrix ii Pro truck.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/2d994078c0bcfdace1c2dc055547500149abe066.JPG" width="666" height="500">

With a file I enlarged that mess slowly, until eventually I got the truck to fit.

It's going to replace the plywood section on the right:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/aa5d4088751289d7d8a53f2fca430b6a4484f440.JPG" width="666" height="500">

It's actually not a bad fit, just a little wobble. But I'll need to figure out how to secure that properly to the truck. I'm thinking a simple right angle bracket will do the trick, so the next step is probably to find/create one.

I also ordered some new aluminium motor pulleys. Much the same as the plastic ones, but should help if things don't go well, or I destroy a motor pulley again : http://www.bbman.com/catalog/product/16XL037-6FA4

The RC controller I ordered right at the beginning of all of this is due to finally show up next week, so I'm hoping I can sort out all the issues, and this will all be ready to go by then....

I now have a motor mount that might be good enough to get moving!

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/3/38e46f693df912313802c37953f8dd7f5e690466.JPG" width="375" height="500">

I bought a couple of little zinc brackets to attach the mount to the truck. They might not be strong enough, there is a fair bit of flexibility in it all still. With a bit of force I can bend and twist to adjust where the belt sits. That's kind of good right now, but might not be so good when I'm riding. But the nuts and bolts are all a bit loose. It will help when I tighten and loctite everything.

It's feeling pretty smooth when I spin the wheel or motor. The belt is sitting a little off the wheel pulley, but there are a few things I could do to fix that if it continues to be a problem. The middle of the 3 aluminium plates is basically acting as a spacer to get the motor closer to the wheel, I could add another. Alternatively I could put the truck mount plate on the other side of the bracket, but there's a bunch of finicky filing involved in that. Or I could just add a bit more space between the wheel and the wheel pulley.

This is a sort of exploded view of the mount. I had to cut out a space for the truck bracket, decided that was a better option than losing the second bracket screw. Unfortunately it meant the bottom hole has no top edge, but that's OK, that plate isn't really structural.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/518699a3218f0e95218a707bbab9dbb3daba4cd0.JPG" width="666" height="500">

This is all much harder than it should be, mostly because I chose to use 8 inch all-terrain wheels, and the trucks that were designed for them. The MBS trucks are oddly shaped and no one makes/sells motor mounts for them. The bracket is unusually long because the belt is unusually long because the wheel pulley is unusually large, and that's all to create enough torque with these 8 inch wheels.

Loving the process though, this is the first time I've worked with aluminium in this way, I've only ever worked with wood and metal like this in a pretty limited way 20 years ago at school, so this is a sweet learning experience.

I shifted the mount to the other side of the bracket, and now it's lining up perfectly. I had to file out a slot for the bracket, but all up it was a pretty simple fix.

It also feels a bit tighter and more secure. So now I'm happy with this mount, I've started work on the other mount to match.

It's all feeling a bit rickety and loose to be honest. I think my choice of MBS trucks was a bad one, given the difficult profile of the trucks. However there are still plenty more things I could do to tighten everything up. For now though I'm done with all this drive train stuff. I'm going to do one last disassemble, liberally apply blue loctite, put it back together and get to work on the electronics.

At this point I also kind of wish I'd gone single motor for my first build. Doubling everything up when this is really just a prototype wasn't the best idea.

First step into the electronics has revealed that I need some thicker silicone wire. Mini-quadcopters are comparatively low on the amps, so I'm mostly using 16-20AWG there, and that's all I have on hand. My batteries will provide 240A if you believe the C rating, so it all comes down to the VESCs which should handle 50A-240A and the motors I'm not so sure on. http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/om5065-170kv says 2200 watts... that's roughly 85A at 8S x 2 = 170A max.

Anyway, that means I should have 8 AWG from the battery to be super safe, and in fact the 4S 8000mah batteries ship with that, but from what I've seen/read/experienced I'm going for 12AWG from the battery to the ESCs and 16 beyond there. I doubt I can find 12AWG silicone wire within a 4 hour drive, so am now stuck waiting for delivery.

In the mean time I cleaned up my bench, and get to lay everything out and plan ahead. It''l look something like this, but with lots of bright blue ugly velcro and a tangle of wires:

All that is left is to stick everything to the board somehow. I'm so eager to get going that it'll be all velcro and duct tape to start with. I'm so super excited, even just getting the motors spinning finally was an awesome moment.

Hi @dinodave,

Your AT build looks like it is coming along well.

I do have one concern - your motor mounts.  Considering they are so long, are you going to put some sort of bracing between them so they don't flex?

To fix this, I reckon you could get away with a length of all thread bolt between the middle of your mounts to keep them 90 degrees to the rear axle, secured with nuts like shown in the diagram below.  Will probably need to locktite the nuts.

First ride was a huge success! Was super impressed with how it handles gravel, both up and down fairly steep gradients.

I just had a couple of failures. I had hot glued the canbus connectors in place, but one of them was glued in place disconnected already! So that was a quick fix. Then at the end one of my batteries fell off, so I can say that Velcro alone is not enough to hold your batteries! Will strap em in for next time.

So, really good fun, still lots to learn and tweaks to make, but I'm super stoked.

Definitely on gravel, without the connector initially it was effectively a single motor setup, and one wheel just span in the gravel even with no load.

I went dual for extra torque as well as traction, and it feels like the right choice. We have a steep gravel drive I want to be able to ride up and down.

No belt skipping, though everything was pretty low speed. I didn't see any issues at all really, but yeah, need to head out and find some more space to push the acceleration/braking a bit more. It was able to accelerate me up a fairly steep hill from near stand still though, so that's not bad!

These trucks feel super firm, making it hard to turn. Not sure if that's just me expecting to be able to carve it up like a surf board or perhaps something particular to mountainboard trucks. I've ordered some of the softer yellow shock blocks to mellow them out a bit, hopefully that helps loosen up the turns.

I guess it's also possible I need to mount the trucks to the board at more of an angle.

I just remembered that the Matrix trucks have adjustment screws, so gave them a twist to reduce the stiffness a bunch, sweet! Looking forward to giving that a go tomorrow.

A couple more pics, I've added a strap for the batteries, took the buckle off a quadcopter battery velcro strap, and secured it and the other side with some bits of bracket I got at the hardware store and bent into shape:

I don't like drilling into the board, but I think it was necessary here.

And finally a tiny little 3 second clip of my first ride looking all uncoordinated and slow. The kids love it, and I feel confident enough that it won't fire off at them, but I think it will be quite a while before I trust it enough for them to try riding.

Another option (that i've used) is to secure the velcro strap under the sticky velcro pad the batteries secure to.  I'd also recommend the uber strong velcro ([3m Dual lock](https://www.amazon.com/3M-Dual-Lock-Reclosable-Fastener/dp/B007OXK1AK) is my preferred) vs the fuzzy kind which just can't hold as well.

Here's a decent'ish picture of the smaller velcro straps as backup to the dual lock velcro under batteries:

Cool thanks :) I did think of the under the sticky Velcro thing, but didn't have any straps long enough. I think I will order some of that 3M stuff, looks like quality, thanks.

You have the exact same batteries, how are you finding them? What sort of range are you getting?

Cool - glad to steer you towards another solution that may work for you.  You are obviously figuring it out on your own!  Necessity is the mother of invention!

Range on those - tough to say since my GF rides it 95% of the time.  And she goes about 8mph tops...  So i run mine down doing circles (or laps) around her and she's always got most left...  After i re-gear (12 or 15mm wide) i'll do a distance run and let you know.  It won't even be close since you are using those big ass AT wheels though...

I'd guestimate on her setup the usual 10Wh = 1km.  So (V x AH =Wh) 29.6v x 8Ah = 236.8Ah/10 = 23.7km/14.7mi

It's a single motor 63mm 200kv - xx/36t gear (not sure of motor gear - been a over a year). on 83mm fly clones.  She loves it and doesn't want me to change it at all.  I'm still going to.  So i can ride it and not skip (on 9mm belt now w/ printed wheel gear).

Took it to the park today, had a go around some grassy fields and concrete paths. Was good fun but unfortunately didn't last long, as I'd loosened the grub screws too much and the shock blocks were falling out! Doh!

Then fixed that and went up and down my terribly potholed and corrugated gravel drive. Not the best place to learn. Found it easier going up than down, as I could stop without the wheels sliding out.

So the 2x 9mm wide XL 5.08mm pitch belts have never skipped, that worked out great :slight_smile:

Also, I haven't yet added the threaded rod to connect the mounts, and I'm not sure if it's needed. The mounts definitely flex, but that feels OK somehow. I think it makes the drive train a bit more forgiving of things like my slightly off center motor pulley holes.

This is feeling like a great success. Looking forward to the softer shocks so I can turn easier, but this is pretty much exceeding all my expectations.

Good session today with a few shortish rides over an hour or so, until the batteries were mostly discharged. I went around paths, packed dirt, clumpy and long grass, and over concrete/gutters etc. got it up to around 30kph I think, though that was when a helmet didn't feel like enough safety gear. 

But man, what a rush. Some of the most enjoyable parts were riding over really bumpy terrain at speed, or transitioning between quite different terrain types, trying to hang on.

Anyway, the board is just fantastic. No major issues. The mounts were a little loose by the end, pretty much just due to the bolts that go into the trucks through the brackets. There is no nut there and not enough thread in the truck, loctite isn't enough. So I plan to drill right through the other side of the truck and use longer bolts with nylock nuts on the other side. Should sort it.

I also got some dropping of connection for fractions of a second on the Winning remote. It only occurred in one location, where I was near to a road with lots of fast flowing traffic. Disconcerting when it happens.

These trucks seem to be hollow, so I will definitely be weakening them, but hopefully not too much. Definitely concerns me a little too though, but I really don't want to weld or epoxy, as I'll probably modify the mounts at some point.

I sort of figure if MBS are happy drilling one 8mm hole in these trucks, another one might be OK... Hopefully![quote="treenutter, post:44, topic:7419"]

Those Lipos are so high off the ground, I just don't think it's an actual issue, unless I start doing jumps or rail slides. I'll keep an eye on the ESCs for any dust issues, but this is the way I roll. Don't fix it until it breaks!

Ha, so I went for another ride today, this time in quite a different setting: a small-scale dirt BMX track.

My original goal was to build a board I could cruise along flat paths with, and this board fullfills that goal pretty well, but wow, there is a whole new level of fun this board could reach with a few tweaks! So sorry if you thought that was the end of my monologue, I have some modifications to make :slight_smile:

On the lipo/esc protection front, I now agree that a case is going to be necessary for true off-roading on really bumpy terrain. I started to fear for the safety of the electronics when riding over steep crests/ridges. I'm still going to put that off for now though.

But my main problem right now is that the mounts move too much. I got slipping on a belt today because the mount moved enough that the belt got too loose. That's just not good enough.

I think the off-centre wheel pulley centre holes are the trigger. They cause an oscillation that tightens and loosens the pressure on the belt every motor turn. This tightening action puts pressure on the mount and bends the motor outwards towards the belt/wheel. It then loosens again and at certain speeds the oscillations get in some sort of resonance and the whole mount wobbles back and forth, I estimate by about 10-20mm at the motor end.

This gets worse as the ride goes on, because all this movement loosens the bolt holding the mount to the truck, and yeah. OK for about 15 minutes, then it needs sorting out with a spanner or I'm getting belt skipping and poorer performance.

So the first fix will be the aluminium motor pulleys I have on order that already have an 8mm bore, and will hopefully sort out those oscillations. The next fix I think will be thicker aluminium on the mounts, and an improved mount design I'm yet to fully devise. Shorter belts resulting in shorter mounts, but with a belt tensioner to keep enough motor pulley teeth engaged is also an option.

On a positive note, I also rode a couple of km along a river bank and back today, just carving back and forth at a moderate speed, wind in my face.... This is the shit.

My new aluminium motor pulleys showed up today, and they are fantastic! I ended up with [these XL 16t pulleys](http://shop.sdp-si.com/catalog/product/?id=A%206A%203M16DF09508) from SDP, as B&B manufacturing messed me around too much with shipping.

The new pulleys are absolutely perfect. 8mm bore and two grub screws that fit right into the Orlin motor keyway so I can just slide em on and tighten for a perfect fit.

With that, all my wobble issues are gone!

But I thought I would also get rid of the effect where the belts twist the mounts outwards at the motors by about 5mm, and went ahead with @baxter's suggestion (thanks!), with two M8 sized threaded rods to connect them. It was a bit of a trick getting all the nuts tightened, but that will help keep everything tighter.

I took it for a quick test ride, and these two changes have made a massive difference. In high torque situations it's finding traction a lot easier without that motor pulley wobble. And at higher speeds it's quieter and more stable. I went full throttle up a steep hill at low speed, and heavy braking down hill, and there was no belt skipping.

I also found out that the reason I was getting belt skipping last time was mostly caused by one of the motors going offline. My canbus connection had come loose. I've now soldered wires to the pins directly, those JST connectors weren't good enough.

This is my crazy method for getting those plastic pulleys off... at least that is behind me now.

Lesson learned: get aluminium motor pulleys, and unless you have some serious precision drilling equipment/skill, get them with the correct bore size pre-drilled.

The purpose of the long mounts/belts is to engage more teeth on these XL belts. Seems to work as I don't get any slipping :)

I guess you should have tried making sure your pulleys were well centered and maybe adding some rods :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: 

This setup should keep me going for some time, but in all honesty, I do agree, I don't really like how far out they are, it looks a bit shit and won't be as stable when I get more confidence and start going for airs and stuff. Am looking into wider belts/HTD pulleys so I can get a more stable/compact setup.

@lowGuido No lie man, I actually thought of this build of yours when I was originally typing that statement! Also, I like seeing that I'm not the only one here still using Dean's Ultra connectors :)

Since @dinodave is riding off road, a flying rock, stick, or any other piece of debris could puncture the casing. We all know what happens next! LiPos are great and seemingly very sturdy _until_  something hits them or they are damaged. I fear for anyone who has a punctured LiPo and doesn't know it!

I'm just going from the dozens of quadcopter crashes I've had with these LiPos, unprotected on-board. Direct hits at high speed into rocks/trees/everything, and my carbon fiber frames got dinged up or an arm broken, propellors disintegrated, screws snapped, motor shafts bent, but never a battery explosion. I did bang one up enough that I decided to discharge it and dispose of it, but seriously, they need a sharp thing delivered with force. I don't think even a loose nail flying at 50km/h is a threat.

On the extremely unlikely chance I do hit something very sharp that is sticking out of the ground more than 5 inches at just the right angle and it manages to puncture a battery, I'll jump off when I see the flames and enjoy the show ;)

Something that is a serious threat which I think hasn't been talked about enough in this community is explosions while charging. That I'm very careful about, always double checking cell voltages and balance charging every time. If you over-charge a cell you're going to have a bad time.

UGH! man I don't know what my problem is with drilling straight holes. I use a hole punch, line everything up perfectly, tripple check, then I press down and actually see the drill bit bend out sideways and go off in its own direction as I slowly press down. Not sure if it's my drill press or the drill bits or what, but something is broken! Time for a bunch of googling.

Anyway, I was having a major problem with my plywood truck wedges, the screws coming down through the deck were working their way back out. They had come out almost 1cm the past couple of rides, so it's only a matter of time before the whole wheel axle falls off while riding!

That aint ideal, so I got to work a couple of days ago making aluminium truck wedges. I have some 1/4 inch by 2 inch aluminium bars and some 1/2 inch by 2 inch bars. I would use two 1/4 inch thin plates, top and bottom to spread the load on the deck and trucks, and two 1/2 inch thick plates on the sides, so I could comfortably drill 5mm holes in them edgeways. 

So I actually drew this out first. It was a very good idea, my first 2 designs would have failed. But this was looking pretty good:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/3/03212660f0b0ef5ffd7ddf3ec25cd0c00539b55b.JPG" width="666" height="500">

The front (left in that pic) screw that comes down through the deck has to go into a threaded hole in the side plates, which I don't really like, but I don't know if there is a way I could secure a nylock nut there, given it is one of the last screws to go in. 

Luckily tapping went very smoothly. I have read a few horror stories about that, but I used the drill press, winded the tap down slowly and everything worked out great there.

The top and bottom plates were relatively easy too (would have been even easier if my drill press would behave). But the wedges were a bit tricky, I got out protractors and stuff I haven't seen in 20 years to try to figure it all out. I cut the 1/2inch thick aluminium with a hacksaw, that wasn't as bad as anticipated. the wedge that needed cutting out was done by drilling a bunch of holes, cutting down to the holes on either side with a hacksaw, then using a hammer/wrench to knock out the waste, files to tidy it up.

It sucked having to make two of them though. And I am yet to make a whole nother set of these damn things for the rear truck.

Anyway. The one truck mount that was coming loose is now looking pretty solid. Tomorrow I'll probably wake up with a renewed enthusiasm to work on the other one. But for now... What a pain in the ass that was. I hope I can ride this board OK with different angles and heights front and back, I'm dying to get out there again!

Here's how it looks pretty much done:

I completed the other mount. Much easier than the first, my drill press issues were just a combination of small errors, issues with clamping properly, my hole punch was too sharp, and wasn't creating big enough round enough holes, and I wasn't taking enough time to triple check everything was lined up correctly.

I might end up replacing the drive train if these belts wear out too fast, otherwise I'm probably going to go all in and make a 4WD build next. 

Either way, it's been a blast, and I'm super happy with how this board performs as a first build. I'm calling this done for now, am working on a better ride video, learning how to ride better. Thanks everyone for your suggestions and feedback along the way.

Hey anyone know where too get tires that go to higher speeds with these? Mine wobble around 15mph

My pulley is balanced too it is actually my back wheels that wobble. Front wheel drive a/t board

I haven't even built my mountainboard yet, but I can already tell how our of balance the wheels are. Could you just get some stick on weights that they use for auto wheels? That's what I'm going to try.

Hmm, I haven't noticed any problems with wheel wobble at those speeds, maybe I just got lucky. They're definitely not well balanced, but it doesn't seem to be a problem for me.

Had my first major failure with the motor mounts, both of the zinc brackets cracked and fell apart. It is still ridable, but the mounts are now jiggling all over the place, not ideal!

I also have had plenty of belt skipping while braking heavily, and have decided it's time to go with 15mm HTD pulleys, with shorter belts and new mounts.

I ordered a set of [72t](http://shop.sdp-si.com/catalog/product/?id=A_6A25M072NF1512) and [17t](http://shop.sdp-si.com/catalog/product/?id=A_6A25M017DF1508) aluminium pulleys, with [84t belts](http://shop.sdp-si.com/catalog/product/?id=A_6R25M084150) from sdp-si.

Those big aluminium pulleys are beautiful. Shame I had to destroy them! Used a hole saw in the drill press to cut out the inner part. Was a bit worried, but it was OK. Just took it slow, and make sure you remove the grub screws first, they worked their way out and caused trouble.

I measured up the radius of the MBS hub screws again, and calculated where all the holes needed to be. Have learned a few things since the last try! I used [this calculator](http://www.had2know.com/academics/pentagon-measurement-calculator.html) to figure out the lengths between points and used digital calipers to mark them.

Fitting nicely. Next up is the new mounts.

Just to follow up, I got the mounts done, and it's working great. I actually did a [separate thread](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/designing-new-mbs-matrix-motor-mount/10899?u=dinodave) detailing the mount design/build.

I ended up having to replace the M4 bolts I had used to fit the pulleys to the wheels with longer ones, which was kind of a nasty job, but necessary to pad the wheel pulley out further and make sure the motor pulley didn't rub against the wheel.

It's a lot better with the new belts. There is less flex/give in the whole drive train, so everything feels tighter, and more responsive. There is no belt skipping while braking with the belts much looser than before, so I think it actually rolls more freely now, should be more efficient.

I'll probably round off the mounts to fit the motor profile to make them look nicer and a bit safer.

Here's a couple of pics of the new mounts.

Here's a video I forgot to post in this thread of the build in action, however it is with the old belts/pulleys/mounts.

Any updates?

 Really nice build log.. with lots of photos and comments.. I like that

Seems like you have gone through a lot.. while making it possible ;)

--

I have not posted my build pictures yet.. still quite a lot of things to improve (from visual side).. though Im already looking into building a more compact deck / board.. the one I've got now is just a monster.. :D it is about 42.5'' in lenght, +/- the motor mount, 

got to measure the original lenght of the board.

So - looking at your somewhat compact board was a treat to me.. though.. looks like I'll have to make some sort of wedges too.. if the stock ones does not fit the new deck I''ll get.

Hi, nothing new to share really. I've still been enjoying riding it, and haven't had any more technical issues. My problem right now is that it's still currently drying out after I accidentally rode through a pretty horrific pile of cow shit, and got it splattered all over the underside! Maybe a case for the ESCs/batteries isn't such a bad idea after all, just to make cleaning easier.

I'm finding the lack of torque with the new pulleys a little annoying too. 17:72 is really not as good a fit as 16:78. I even went up to 2x5S batteries but found it didn't make enough difference. The top speed is mental now too, I haven't had the guts to go full throttle on the flat yet.

I'll probably try a new build next year with some Trampa trucks/wheels, but for now this is going great.

I am working on a mountain board too but with single drive only,   The problem that I am running into is with the xl belt and pully system.  XL 10mm wide is causing the gears to slip.    I might Chang it to dual drive.  Can you post a picture of the motor mount.   

I might change the gear and belt system to htd5m with 12 to 15mm wide.

It may be your belt tension is too low. Those gears are massive and engage a whole lot of area and presumably teeth, seems odd it would slip unless it's under a lot of load.

The  tension isn't pretty good.  My problem might be I am using 10mm (037)LX belts.  My motor pulley is only 12 mm wide. i am having trouble finding XL belt the fit my motor pulley. The next XL belt size is 050 (14mm?) I think.

I had belt slipping quite a bit with the XL belts quite a few times, and that was with dual motor. I said it way back in this thread somewhere, but with 16t motor pulleys I am glad I went with the super long 116t belts, it looks like yours are a lot shorter. It's all about the area engaged on the motor pulley. More teeth, wider, longer belts, or a belt tensioner will all help.

Also your wheel pulleys look quite small, that won't help. You want the biggest motor/wheel pulley ratio you can get (while still engaging plenty of teeth on the motor pulley) to provide as much torque as you can on these kind of builds.

Honestly though with a single motor I don't think you have a chance of driving a mountainboard wheel with a single XL belt. You either need to go with HTD 12-15mm wide or dual motor, and I ended up with both. Good luck!

I would say you need a tensioner / idler pulley! Your wheel sprocket does look quite small.. have you tried to calculate how much teeth in mesh do you have?

I think it was critical not to have less than 5 teeth for motor pulley to be in contact with the belt..  

That's the reason why I also chose quite a long belt.. because the calculator said there wont be enough contact between the pulleys.. My belt is a bit loose and it does skip when I try to brake hard.. no problems for acceleration, though!

Ive got 95T belt for 15/65 pulley system (4.33) ratio)

85T would have been better in terms of lenght but then the idler pulley would be even more welcome probably.

@dinodave, could you please post an updated parts list for your build? Yours is very much like what I'd like to do!
Can you give a rough cost estimate?
