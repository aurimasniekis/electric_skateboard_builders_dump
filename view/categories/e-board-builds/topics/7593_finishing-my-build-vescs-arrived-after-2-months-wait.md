Continuing the discussion from [Board rebuild / New member](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/board-rebuild-new-member/5903/12):

Finally VESCs arrived after 2 months of waiting. 
VESCs are bigger then my expectation and my housing can't fit. So I did some operation to my VESC housing. Aligned both VESCs together side by side and cable tie the wires into position.

Using some silicon to seal up the wires gaps to prevent water splash and dust.

Using some soft porons, I seal up all the opening gaps.

Finally,  BLDC tuning done. (NOT PERFECT YET,  am experiencing some minor motor clocking during the standstill acceleration. Anyone can help me ?????? )

Does it happen when you push start? Could be the traction control when starting from standstill...

Only when standstill acceleration will have motor clocking. 

A smooth acceleration if I push start it. Maybe i try to switch off my traction control and test it.... Will feedback!!!

what motor mount is that? and what size motors you using?. Looks like your motor is mounted onto some paris trucks, how did you manage this?
