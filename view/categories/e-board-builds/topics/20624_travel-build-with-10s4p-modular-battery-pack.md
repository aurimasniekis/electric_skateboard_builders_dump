MY PARTS FOR THE BUILD:

**1.Modular 10s4p batteries with printed enclosures.** 

Each battery is 86WH - The whole total amount of wh after joining them togheter is 420WH. The batteries that were used is LG HG2. Each pack has 8 cells.

**2. For the drive I will be using CARVON 2.5 SINGLE HUB. I expect the range to be around 25MILES.**

**3. VESC - AXLE VESC.**

**4. JET SPUD  - For the deck I want to use 34.5 JET POTATO.**

**5. ENCLOSURE**
And now the worst part ..ENCLOSURE ....I need to find enclosure that can fit around 38mm-40mm of height because the last battery pack is pretty huge due to the LED button that I am using. I pray to god that maybe @psychotiller could help here with some of his great enclosures.

Very nice build.  Couldn't you print an enclosure or maybe just end pieces?  If you go the end piece your just get a couple of pieces of ABS and us a heat gun to bend the edges and lips around a 2x4 or any flat edge.

The problem is that I now have moved to California. I have no tools whatsoever...like not even a drill :slight_smile:  I just need to find some kind of enclosure that could fit all the components. In the future I want to modify all the packs so they could be a little slimmer in height. I think I can get all of them to be around 25mm of height. Now the problem is that the biggest pack has 38mm of height because of the LED button that I am using.

That's right..I just put all the information about each pack, so guys at the airport know how much WH each pack has. 
According to airlines you can bring 4 spares and 1 in the device. That's why I am using 5 packs in total.

How did you do the labels?  Those look really professional. 

Maybe another member here is nearby and can help with tools? Where you at?

You dont work for LG?
And I'm guessing there isn't such a thing as an LED studio lighting kit that these belong to?
And they're purely used for your e-board

hehehe ..well actually you could possibly use it as a power source for LED ..but .you know :) but anyway all the other information on the sticker are totally correct. I've made the stickers to look nice ..you know all the battery enclosures are black ..so these nice BLUE stickers give them additional SAFE tone to it.

I love what you've done with the pack. Its very cool. 

There's some issues with that sticker though. LG is unrelated. You cannot legally use their name or logo on your packs.

LG/Samsung/Panasonic/Sony are pretty strict about who is an Authorized Battery Assembler and can use their name/logo. If for whatever reason you ever have issues with these batteries in a flight or airport you could also face legal charges from LG for using their name on a product that isn't made by them. 
On top of that you also lie regarding the use of the battery. 

If you ever have any issues while traveling with these packs there will be serious consequences not only for you but the e-skate community as a whole. Having your pack pretend to be something it isn't doesn't help...

I suggest you redesign the sticker and take out the LG chem logo. Maybe add a line that says something along the lines of "Assembled with LG Chem Cells"
If you're not comfortable stating their actual use, dont add anything at all. 

My best guess is that you intended these packs to be deceiving. That'll get you in trouble at airports fast and the last thing we need is more regulations as to what we can and cant bring onboard...

This is meant to be constructive so please do not take it the wrong way.

Good to know ..I'll take their logo down and print new ones. Well truth be told these power packs can be used to power anything you like pretty much so it 's not like they can't do that. All of the packs were made according to flight regulations so they strictly fit into airlines guidelines. I'll take down logo and 'll put GENERAL PURPOSE POWER PACK LINE which they are.

Just for the clean record...the logos are gone ! :slight_smile:

Maybe not as nicely packed yet but I also followed the idea about ''airplane safe'' batteries..

These are consisting of 6cells each, with maximum wh rating of about 66Wh per module.

6 modules in total (for 6s pack)

---

@NAF Where did you get the info about that 4 packs + 1 in device?

I heard that some airplanes does not specify how many packs can you carry, if they are below 100wh mark.. if they are 160wh or below, then only 2 are allowed..

From what i ve noticed every airline has different requirements when it comes to number of batteries. I am mostly flying with British Airways and they clearly specify that when it comes to batteries under 100wh you can take four spare batteries and you can have one battery in the device. But I also have seen that other airlines let you take unlimited number of batteries under 100wh unless they are not for sale :) which means resonable number for personal use.

Also lots of airlines allow taking 1-2 batteries from 100wh to 160wh but airlines approval is required which can be real pain in the butt.

I am making a change ..instead of JET POTATO 34.5 " I've ordered 36" inch version. There is a difference in the concave..a I've noticed that 34.5" concave might be a little bit weird and uncomfortable for e-skate rides.

Be careful, my friend.  I want to take my board on flights as much as you do, but if you get caught, you'll be charged with intentionally deceiving the airline and FAA as well as endangering the lives of passengers.  You'll likely go to jail.  If not, then serious fines and bans.  Printing your own labels and laminating them onto homemade Li Ion batteries and attempting to board can be looked at as terrorist intentions.  Sorry for the downer, but it's that serious.

[/quote]

No one is deceiving anyone here.  All the specs printed on the labels is exactly what these packs are. No more no less.  Airlines give you specific requirements when it comes to battery packs. These packs strictly follow their guidelines, and are much more safe than some shitty lipos from china that people bring for their drones every day.

You're welcome for giving you advanced warning.  You might as well smuggle a homemade gun in your carry-on with a fake license.  Good luck if you want to take your battery packs on a passenger plane.  If you get caught, you'll probably fk it up for everyone as well.  Read up on UN 38.3.

I am not interested in shipping my batteries anywhere in the world, and that's what the UN 38.3 regulations were made for. 
The only document I care about is the one from FAA that tells you what you can take as a carry on luggage on a plane.

I understand where you are coming from, but there are different regulations for what can be shipped by airlines in a checked luggage and what you can take as a passenger as a carry on for your own personal use.

The pdf you posted is a brief summary of this gigantic regulation book: https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=bba5ad06518b529c94e1d67a3270196b&ty=HTML&h=L&r=SECTION&n=49y2.1.1.3.12.1.25.5

"...portable electronic devices (e.g., watches, calculating machines, cameras, cellular phones, laptop and notebook computers, camcorders, medical devices etc.) containing dry cells or dry batteries (including lithium cells or batteries) and spare dry cells or batteries for these devices, when **carried by passengers or crew members** for personal use. Portable electronic devices powered by lithium batteries may be carried in either checked or carry-on baggage. Spare lithium batteries must be carried in carry-on baggage only. Each installed or spare lithium battery must be of a type proven to meet the requirements of each test in the **UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Part III, Sub-section 38.3** and each spare lithium battery must be individually protected so as to prevent short circuits ...."

UN manual of tests and criteria... Can be found here http://www.batteryuniversity.eu/?dFHASH=4a213d37242bdcad8e7300e202e7caa4

Actually there are several companies that can do the tests for you and I believe they do not cost 15k. I will email http://www.batteryuniversity.eu/Tests/UN-383/EN_index_1108.html asking a quotation for battery tests and wil let you know.

Law is very clear about this topic: all batteries must be OF A TYPE that passed the tests. "Of a type" means that not every single battery must be tested. Instead ,as @PXSS said, you have to prove to be able to mantain a quality standard throughout your production process by sending them quite a lot of SAMPLES.

In reality this will happen:
Out of 1 000 000 airplane trips you make, 999 999 times you will have a smooth and undisturbed flight.
The reason regulations exists are for the 1 airplane trip when something unfortunate happens. This time airline company will blame you. You will have some backup if you did the tests. You will be fucked if you skipped those tests.

What would make this guys pack more problematic to take on plane than something I make myself?  Because he sells it? (Don't know if he has plans to do that).  I assume if I solder or weld a couple cells together it's not an issue getting on a plane as they let me on with my lipos plugged together.

Every company that sells something with spot welded Li-ion cells inside surely isn't subject to testing. No?

So none of us can legally fly with our homemade Li-ion packs If we solder a cell to another?  We would have to break down the pack to individual cells regardless of however they were connected by us?


We need a compression pack for flying that we can dismantle then

Yup.  Welcome to my WTF moment.  Can't take it on passenger or commercial flights.  Period.  Getting it confiscated is one thing, but fabricating your own labels and trying to get it on-board could result in a life changing situation.  Ak.
Ship it to your destination by ground ahead of time.

Compression pack is where it's at!  Then we can have a battery any size and tear it down for flight.

@Hummie
Correct! Either break it down or have it certified.

The likes of boosted, enertion and big eboard brands get away with shipping internationally since their packages come from china where regulations are pretty much non existent. Once they get to the EU or US then they must be shipped by ground
