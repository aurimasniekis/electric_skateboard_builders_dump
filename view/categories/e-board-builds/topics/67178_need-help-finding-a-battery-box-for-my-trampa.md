Get the BW500 Case! Cheap, good and fits up to a 10s8p with a small BMS on top.

I bought peli 1150 for the battery. It looks and is high quality and durable. 
But I really have no idea how I'm gonna mount it. And I wish it was a bit more streamlined.

Two bolts in the middle and/or velcron tape should hold the box pretty good, no?

Bolts yes. Velcro hell no! Maybe velcro underneath for vibration noise but foam weatherstripping is better

I had both of ideas, but I was not sure. With the flex on mind it becomes a bit tricky. Velcro sound good but I'm afraid it will fall:(. So 2 bolts in the middle souns like a plan.

There was one guy with i clamps type solution but I cant remember who it was :(

Clamps don't allow for flex tho unless they're in the center. Still a hell no to velcro! These batteries are heavy

If you use bolts than put some washers or neoprene between your board and the case. Will give everything a bit a room if the board flex

I thought the same before...
But 7kg for a area of 5x10cm ...ðŸ¤”
I donâ€™t think your batteries are more heavy, and I guess you would not only use a 5x10cm piece.

![20180906_124019|281x500](upload://7t3gBEGhCklpuBL6y8KT9412832.jpg)I'm using cnc body panel mounts for drift cars with 5mm o rings of different lenghts. Like 6.00 for a set of 4 on ebay. This way it can handle the vibrations and big hits. They are attached to the top deck with L brackets. ![20180906_123738|690x388](upload://5EUr0MkPWmWG4RP4mM6Kba5FwUQ.jpg)![20180906_123912|281x500](upload://r6p8fe12MPTCg7tCxRAmXKPqC0V.jpg)

My words. I think I read somewhere, maybe @rich said, that he carry the whole deck included  batteries on the handle of the velcroned box without issues
