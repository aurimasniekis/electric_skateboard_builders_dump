Hey

Started making this a little over a year ago, it's been largely finished for 5 months and has been working great!

6374, 12S3P (Basen IMR 26650), Nylon X printed inner drive train and spur, herringbone gear design, PETG motor mount, modular PETG battery enclosure and electronics enclosure.

More details to follow...

Very nice build. Do you have pics of the drive?

Yes the drive seems interesting ! You printed it in nylon ? Will it holds ?

Nylon X (carbon fiber).  Its been holding well so far.

Here's the tinkercad I used during design here: [Trampa MTB Parts](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/456o8GXYy2M-trampa-mtb)

The gearbox:

Use these at your own risk!  These designs were printed using high quality filament, on a perfectly calibrated printer.

Thanks for sharing this I‚Äôm intrigued, intrigued and coincidentally waiting on a delivery of carbon fiber PETG 

Being able to tailor the hanger mount is massive

Great Man!
thx so much for sharing this!!!
is there a way to include this into my tinkercad library?
or can i just download the full design?
i want to ungroup some parts so that i can download them seperately.

You could export each part directly from tinkercad probably...footwork

Is your motor gear 3D printed as well? 

I've done nylon herringbone and spur motor gears (wheel gears all in PETG) but had issues with the grub screws loosening due to the slight flexibility in the Nylon. I've always used m4 nuts inserted, flush with the flat faces of the motor shaft inside the motor gears and grub screws secured via loctite to the nylon/nut. Even then, they eventually loosen. 

Have you had these issues? Do you use stronger or more rigid nylon? Edit: ah I see, nylon X... strong, rigid... Do you bond the motor gear to the shaft with glue or something? Grub screws? Keyway?

Besides the grub screws thing, especially with keyway, they held up great as long as they were sufficiently enclosed from the elements, never misaligned (herringbone), and keyway kept them turning even with loose grub screws.

I'd love to revisit the 3D printed gear drives at some point.

Can you tell tge gearing ratio on this?

[quote="alexwdunn, post:4, topic:85452"]
Nylon X
[/quote]

just for info
I changed the gears from helical to stright cause straight metal gears are cheaper than helical ones
in my case the gear ratio is 52:12 
Im going to print this with taulman 910 alloy, keep you up to date if it worked

Herringbone gears used intentionally for strength, maximum surface contact between meshing gears acheived in this configuration.  A desirable property for 3d printed gearbox... YMMV if altering the design.

did you also use the 3d printed motor pulley or did you use a metal one? if you use a metal one would it be possible to tell which one you used?
Link maybe??
THX very much

It's 3d printed.  No metal gears were used.

Cool nice work man keep you up to date if its working for me too
I also redesigned your design to test it for a geared direct drive system i wanna buildüò¨üëç![PNG|281x499](upload://zzEvALCqHPSElGJxBXJ3lHZUGKE.jpeg) 


The motor pulley will be metal in my case

Did you drilled holes into the trampa truck for fixation?

```
No, used existing holes in hanger.

The additional holes in the gearbox are intended to add bolts which "clamp" the hanger - they significantly reduce vibration on the mount when in use.

Prototyping looks good so far with gearing ratio of 12:32
Lets see if this will fit onto the trampa ultimate trucks with a dual 6374 setup
Keep ya up to date

Made some test fittings on my new trampa ultimate truck and 107 flywheels
Looks real good so far ground clearance isnt much at the moment but ill cut the gearing housing the get at least 1cm ground clearance

Gearing is 12/30 btw and the motor pulley will be steel

Hi banjaxxed, thank you for sharing the files on tinkercad library! It¬¥s only possible to download the complete parts on tinkercad - not to download it part for part. I also want to print it for my mountainboard but unfortunately i see some problems on the pinion and on the bigger gear wheel as well.

![gearing-all|690x377](upload://1YHC8pyuok9GjBOZwaIDIK8LZ8t.jpeg) 

I exported it with FreeCad and wanted to edit it with Sketchup. Did I do something wrong?
Or could someone please give me a hint how to export it without this big gaps in the gears? I am a beginner in 3D printing so its not as easy to fix this.

Thanks!
