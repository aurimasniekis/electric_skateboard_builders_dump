Hello Everyone,

Here it is, the first, and for all hope not the last one, using a dual setup of the NEW VESC-X. 

And for all the FOC fans out there... It is tested and now only run in FOC mode, because is so F******* nice cruising around like a ninja on crack.

The motor

As you can read in the tittle, I've choose to use Hummie Hubs, to get a slim and clean design... Also I wanted to test them personally. Well, they are working really great, especially in FOC were they are silent as a ghost hauling at the moon. (Ghost don't exist, so they are really silent).

The Battery

The battery is a simple hand made 10S4P, with a custom BMS.... Who's using a [spoiler]momentary[/spoiler] switch.  :wink:

Laying out the cell, so I wouldn't make a big and sad fire.

Testing the end result...

The VESC

The new form factor is really a major step, specially for using the space cell, it give more room for clean dual setup electronic. Also it provide more stability, I've been using them for quite a while in my old single 6355 setup without any problem, I've burn more motor than VESC at this point... 

(This is my first try of laying out the BMS and VESC)

(And the End result, and I've also made my own split XT connector)

These are the aluminum one, I strongly suggest the steel one... but I didn't really monitor the HUBS, because the purpose of this this build was to test the new VESC-X in FOC mode. Also, it was one of my first build using hubs and I really like it, the overall design look nicer and it more stealth. But the draw back, is the heat, that why I suggest to go for the steal one.

Very sweet build..    I do belive hub motors will be very much more popular in the near future. Even more so now the VESC-X can handle running them more reliably and keeping heat low.

I hope you have soldered all the missed parts like the C44/C49 ceramic capacitors/ the Tantals/ the Oscillator etc afterwards. :grin:

> well, for someone who need the altium file, you're pretty spot on... It's the beta I was working on, when I made this post....

Is that a compliment or an insult? :sunglasses::joy:
Do you think someone who doesn't see this needs the Altium/BOM files to check his theory about the so called "upgraded components"?

I can see it coming..the hubs will roast before the vesc shuts down from over-temp. No surprise. Little motors.  But the ride is nice. Those ones I sent u are with unsealed smaller bearings with retaining fluid, getting them off to replace them is a lot of work so try to clean and maintain them however u can especially if u cook them over 200f it will lose the oil. The big is pretty covered but the little isn't.

Here is another Video we made yesterday, the sound you can here is from the setup that you cannot see, but I you're interest It is a Single Enertion Big Boy (6374), also with a VESC-X in FOC mode...

Little Update today... It's raining outside and the local skateshop has season end sale. So why not change the deck for a better one (from Restless)... and lower it

Nice deck though. It looks  like the enclosure fits pretty good too.

Seems more of a test of the motor speed on 12s, as the escs and motor both don't have time to heat up.
Awesome neighborhood for commuting by board

@JohnnyMeduse @onloop does the vesc-x comes with bullet connector or you'll have to soldier it on your own? Does 12s posts higher fault/failure probability as mentioned by some members in this forum? Are there any link of videos to show on how to setup the vesc-x?

I don"t think the Vesc-X come with bullet connector, you need to solder your. 12S setup work just fine and the setup is almost the same as the regular vesc, except it use a micro usb.

Not as much as before, but it's still working. They only issue is that the hubs aren't powerful enough and I've had to walk some hill on my commute. Also since I've got a Raptor2, I refer this board as a beginner board... :wink:
