Sooo finally got everything together and finished my build. After a year of gathering parts, moving cross country... the joy the fun...

Specs:
Dual 260kv motor: The only ones I could pickup at the time... 
10S8P 18650 cells battery.
MBS wheels
GT2B remote
Obviously 2 VESCx's
16/35 gears, 15mm wide.
on a landyachtz board.

First impressions so far... way wayyy too fun! 

Pulls really well. Both Vescs set to: motor max 75a, batt max at 35a, motor regen at -65 for some intense stopping lol.

I'm around 215lbs, so pulling me up a 13% slope is doable, but just just. I'd probably need the 190kv motor's to have more torque. Anyone 190lbs and under could easily easily use these motors up most steep roads i'm sure.

Next will be to test the distance.

Hows the watertight-ness of this? It looks kinda slack in the middle
