I am looking at building a board to use on my local golf course.  Reason for building my own is I don't want to spend 5k+ on a Golf Board or Golf Skate Caddy.  The course is somewhat hilly so I'm going to need something with a enough power and torque to get me up the hills and around the course. Range I'm needing per charge would be 12-17 miles and as far as speed 10-15 mph is plenty.  I would like to keep the build under $1000.  I am a complete novice to eboards so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

What sort of wheels u predict would be good? Ive seen that wider / bigger wheels would be better not to dig into the terrain

Can search around for various builds, but basically if you have the same diameter and length motor and a lower kv value (rpm per volt) then you typically get higher torque.  Since you're not looking for top end would basically suggest getting a relatively low kv motor.  Like @Okami said too bigger wheels will work a lot better in grass and the like, you may also want to just throw some big risers (plastic/rubber between the trucks and the deck) on there to give yourself more ground clearance for the components hanging off the board.

Discussion here where the OP listed their parts and discussion below about things that are missing and what you should expect for costs.  Long story short under $1000 is no problem if you spend $500 on electronics (getting mostly the good stuff) and a couple hundred on the deck and other skateboard hardware and you'll be good.  My single motor build ended up costing me around $600 if we don't count the extra ESCs I fried waiting for the VESC.

Once you have your wheels picked out that will guide you on the pulley types available to some degree and then can choose the voltage and kv for the motor that makes sense for the speed you want

With the extra budget you could also go with a prebuilt battery with a good BMS if you don't have a LiPo charger already and don't want to have to deal with the larger safety considerations with LiPo packs compared with the 18650 based packs (I've seen them both burn but the LiPo foil packs are more sensitive to puncture than 18650 cells among other differences)

You have to use inflatable tires to not be destroying the green.

Yeah, you'd NEVER use it on the Green. If you mean the fairway, I don't know. My course is pretty hard on the fairway. Unless there was a recent deluge, my 97's would fare pretty well on the cart paths as well as the fairways, without any damage. Not  sure they'd allow it, but it'd be fun!

I would think using something like mini tank treads would be easier on the grass and allow more traction when starting from standstill.

Probably not the cheapest way, but could be worth looking into. I’ll ask my suppliers if they have seen anything along the lines of tank treads or something similar.

 I imagine you won’t need to be going 30 mph on a golf course (even though I can’t think of any other place that I would be more tempted to push top speed, still it would probably be frowned upon). 

If you need a source for some extremely low KV motors, let me know. I’d be happy to help.

Edit: Sorry, I didn’t realize how old this post was. Anyways my offer still stands if anyone is interested in low kv motors, and I’ll still ask around for treads cuz i’m curious now. Hopefully the OP completed his Golf Board by now. If so, throw up some pics please.   :slight_smile:

What I'm worried about now after further investigation is should It be 4 wheel drive? and should I use chain drive or gear drive? I think belt drive would be too flimsy. This has to scoot up hills with me 180lbs plus a bag with clubs and that is 30lbs and any additional lbs from drinks and gear. So 220lbs

belts would be a good solution for you, and dual 6374 rear drive would be pleeeenty for you and your gear. I think youre heavily underestimating the motors weve got ;)

A trampa board isnt exactly cheap though, so DIY would probably be the solution for you.... just make sure to minimize final cost by doing your research and making sure your parts are compatible

I haven’t built one yet. I just got the ok from my course to use one. They had to check on insurance and with board members if it would be ok. I’m thinking it will be a good winter project for me. It looks like yours is coming along well. What have you used for your build?

Nice idea for a build and a nice way to save some money while learning some new stuff.

I worked on a golf course for a couple seasons(maintaining the greens, bunkers, fairways etc...) so tire wise I would not recommend any tires with big knobs on them because of the possibility of them spinning and leaving a great big brown grass-less line. If you look at all the tires used by golf kart and machinery you'll see that almost all the tires are tread less or if there is thread they are not knobby. Here's a pic of a mower used to cut rough and fairways (presently in the rough cutting config).
![fairway_machine|690x492](upload://jCAj1fERxalZDia6e31gQDRrwFr.jpg)

IMO the best option for tires for your application would be hand cart wheels/tires they have a little bit of thread so you dont spin every where. They can be run at relatively low psi (helps with traction) and they are cheap too. The only problem I foresee using those would be the need to adapt the hub to fit traditional trucks. Another option would be running 8" mbs roadie tires. They have a bit less tread but I think they would work just fine and there is a lot of support out there for mbs hubs.
If you want to go the cheap easy route I'd get a used mountain board and work from there. Check your local classified they come up from time to time at really low prices.

Here's a pic of the roadie tire.
![mbs%20roadie%20tire|500x500](upload://tfonMIq2YIEAplsfZJT6ZTQadxv.jpg)

To respect the budget and speed dual 6354 or something in that size would work. FOCBOX for esc is a must because of the ability to run FOC in a reliable way. This will greatly help you to not spin all the time with smooth controlled acceleration. Low KV motors and big gearing ratio would help to with smooth start and hill climbing capabilities. Battery wise cheapest is Hobby Lipo, sexiest but also more expensive Li-Ion pack. For the battery once your choice of motor and gearing is done it'll dictate the number of cells in series requires for your desired top speed. Keep everything as simple as possible it'll keep the price down.

 I don't know your experience as a builder but for a 1000$ maybe look to grab a used build for sale it would save you time and a lot of money. An old MBS board build or a street boar with sixshooters would work. The best would be a trampa build but those have usually a big price tag attached to them.:money_with_wings: 

Good luck with your build hope I helped a bit! 

Best regards.

I made the handle bar. This one pictured is steel pipe. Bottom is a pipe flange to mount to board. vertical bar is threaded into flange. The tee is from hardware store. (SteelTek 1-1/4-in x 90-Degree Silver Galvanized Steel Structural Pipe Fitting Short Tee) Then I just used short pieces of aluminum to grips with hockey tape. I later added $5 hand grips.

I have changed the board. See pictures / update at bottom of thread.

Updated my previous board. Had a new carbon fiber board made. Its a bit longer. Also, replaced steel bar with carbon fiber handle bar. I put on hand grips, cell phone holder, also using "bag boy" parts for my bag holder from a push cart. I'm working a wired throttle to mount on the handle bar and changing out batteries for lithium ion, currently lead acid.

Belts are fine. Motor & battery setup are key. I'm 225 and board is 45 and I can do 20 mph. It's the length of time of the ride for me that gets me. I can do 9 holes no problem. 18 can't do. My batteries currently are lead acid, (heavy/no real holding capacity). Mine has plenty of power to go over hills, etc. I'm working on (2) 10s8p for real extended rides.

A problem I have found is mud flaps. Fine if you are off road boarding, bring the mudd. Want to play golf at 730 am when the ground is wet or heavy dew, then prepared to get soaked without mudd guards. I have made templates, but have printed my guards yet. So I use it mainly in the afternoon when its dry.

Other options looking into, phone charger, bottle/beer holder. A great place to accessories is Clic Gear. Add and remove options for golf.

Nice macncheese I actually own a clicgear 8.0 4wheel version and I love it. Another thing that would help is a umbrella holder too I've found having that shade can be crucial on super sunny hot days.

If you're only against the pre-built route because a Golfboard or Golf Skate Caddy costs  $5K+, check out this eBay link for used Golf Skate Caddy's for ~$1k+. It seems like maybe the seller is a golf course or someone who is trying to sell off a bunch of these, and they look like the best, cheapest pre-built option available.

That looks awesome, how does it go? I have been thinking of cheap alternatives to buying a cart and this popped into mind. Where do you shop for all the parts? Would it be possible to make a 4wd one for wet conditions? 
I am completely new to electric skateboards so I have alot of research to do but if you could point me in the right direction ie where you shop or even a parts list to for that board, that would be a huge help. Anything on it that you would change? How does it handle a set of clubs hanging off that front?
