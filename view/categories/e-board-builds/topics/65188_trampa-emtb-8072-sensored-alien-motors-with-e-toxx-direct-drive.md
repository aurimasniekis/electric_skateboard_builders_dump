First I just wanna thank whoever created this awesome site and for all the people who contribute their knowledge and ideas!! I'm starting my very first build and would like to share my experience with everyone here and hopefully help the next guy in line wanting to take on the very challenge of building their first board!!
 I've read and read and read a lot and still have so many questions! lol. Digging into the electronics of this has been the most challenging for me, just with the different options, connections, gauges, etc. Im getting a little older so its getting slightly harder to digest all this information at once so re-reading and watching videos is key for me! So lets go over the game plan and parts list I have or is on the way so far and maybe someone may see some design flaws or challenges I may experience and can help me before I get too ahead of myself lol. 
The idea and goals:
- To have good torque 
- But to also be able to limit it and expand it as my skill level increases 
- Be able to go long distances when needed (30+ miles) 
- Be able to jump so top battery placement is a must 
- Go fast when needed (30+ mph) 

Parts purchased:
- Trampa MTB 
- E-toxx 80mm Direct drive 1:5 gear ratio
- Alien 8072 sensored motors at 250kv 
- 2x Flipsky Fsvesc 6.6 no hw limit firmware 
- 12s8p 30Q battery pack 
- 10awg silicone wire, 5.5 gold bullet connectors, heat shrink, etc 

Jens is working on my hanger as we speak, board and VESC's  are  already in, motors be in Monday, spot welder, batteries and accessories within a week or two! 
First challenge is to see how Im going to mount the Flipsky Vescs to the board! They are already in their own little aluminum case with anitspark switch but I'll have to build a little holder for them probably out of aluminum. Thinking of adding a fan to the enclosure just to ensure things stay cool. Anyone have any good ideas of a good VESC holder for Trampa boards? It's hard to do right now cause I have no clue where the motors and Drives will sit after installation.

That's it so far, I feel like I'm on the right path to meet all my goals. Anyone see anything that stands out that could be a problem?

Well i need to read slower. Missed the "top" word in that sentence. :upside_down_face:

I personally dont like top mounted batterys as it look really ugly with a big box on top of your board.
Have you seen the enclosure that @Eboosted makes. I have just received mine and its awesome.

Yes I love the look of it but for my riding style its not functional. With Jumps your board is going to flex to the ground sometimes and landing on your battery pack is a big no no lol. Thats why the aggressive MTB riders have their battery boxes on top! Also I hate to be limited to a 5p configuration for now

Go lipo if you want that ‚Äúkick‚Äù. I‚Äôm using 8085 top mounted with 12S lipo pack with fvt esc, that punch by the motor on every acceleration will scare the shit out of you. You won‚Äôt want to go back to any other ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù set up if you‚Äôre a torque junky.

Oh man you have any videos?  I was going lipo at first but decided for a longer lasting battery. Still going to get ~150 amps so its still going to provide a proper punch I believe!

```
No, i never take any video when i ride, kind of difficult as i'm not used to the wheelies. 

It really depends on which esc you go with. I couldn't replicate the same "kick" on vesc because the FVT esc pulls a lot of amps on initial acceleration that the 150amps bms will kick in and cut power for half a sec, which was enough to stop the momentum of the acceleration. So my solution was to ditch the bms and only use it to charge. I use lipo alarm to check voltage levels instead and supply the esc with as much "juice" as it wants. 

But ya, lipos are not good for longevity but they do provide the punch you're looking for. My thinking is this, if you're gonna build a proper torque machine, might as well go all out and leave no stone unturned.

Just a rough mockup for now. I wanna bring them lower but I'll have to wait until your awesome drives come in so I know where I can build them. I have some aluminum plate for the final product! I may put a slight cavity on the front to hold receiver and bluetooth module.

[/quote]


Question about fuse.  If my battery has the max capacity of 160 amps, those Amps will be split into two Flipsky Vescs that can handle 150A Burst each, according to them. BMS is rated 150 amps as well. So what size fuze should I get and where should I put it?  Thanks

## \#34 Posted by: ZmasteR Posted at: 2018-08-21T03:22:47.474Z Reads: 205

```
I would advise to take advice from more skilled people around here.
For me a 120A on the main PSU line did the trick so far.
But you can put one on each ESCsince they're supposed to handle this amount of current. To be checked that said.
```

## \#35 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2018-08-21T05:01:03.901Z Reads: 222

```
If you use a bms and a fuse you go double safety. If you choose the fuse to 150a I guess your bms will cut off before the fuse burn.
Usually the fuse can handle the marked amps for constant current. Make sure that you get the right fuse to your voltage. Most car fuses 32V but there also 58V which would fit better for a 12s setup.

When going for a fuse be sure to check the graphs at the manufacturers site, they show for how long what ammount of amps the fuses can take. For example, some can take the rated amps for 60s before melting, others can take rated amps for 0.1s before melting :slight_smile:

@Silverline  @DK-Odense in the videos that sounds just like a resonance to me. With a bigger diameter bell resonance effects will be more pronounced. And I bet that the bell was not dynamically balanced. Then if you add the magnets at a slightest offset it will make matters worse. But it did not sound too bad at all, I think it should be usable if it is not shaking too much.
Or is there something more I dont see?

Edit: I saw the vibration on the last video from DK-Odense...... that sucks. Looks like the whole bell is violently vibrating.

@Risewithin Those motors look insane, jeebus. I am very interested to see how FlipSkys work out for you. And that battery... lawd almighty.. This build probably costs like 2x more than  my car :D

Yep - When the stutter/vibration kicked in at a certain level of RPM there was a loss in power, and you felt this very much riding your board. If the board was running smooth i could live with the sound, but there was a massive loss in power.

The Leopard copper fillment is really high, also the design is very sexy IMO.

Thanks @Andy87 and @xilw3r for the fuse info!! 

@DK-Odense oh man that‚Äôs terrible and has me severely worried. How long ago was that? Did you ever find the cause? Looks like the bell bowed at at its resonant frequency which makes sense with the loss of power due to the magnets being pulled away not making great contact. 

@AlienPowerSystem do you guys know what caused this or a solution? 

@Nowind hey brother will that drive system work with the leopards? Looks like I may have to switch if these Alien motors don‚Äôt work right.

About 3 months ago.

We tried with different vescs and different setup/motor detection parameters. We ended up concluding that this motor just did'nt fitted for this type of task. Bruno from aps was super cool about it, and just said that we could send it back and we figure something out.

I have two 80100 running without probs, so it is not a "80 mm" problem.

Hey mate ! Massive beast coming here :yum:
Just to report (what I could, and if it could help a bit), the noize doesn't sound that bad on some video here ... I mean its a "standard" from APS motor no ?
The RSPEC got a special noize too at some rpm ?
I admit that here it's worse ... your problem 3 vid is a bit scary.

Did you think guys this could come from the under-sizing bearing and all inside stator-rotor configuration make like 63xx motor?
Opposite to the 8085/100 who got huge bearing inside and weight a lot more (I have dissected mine for a project not used yet, that what scared me a bit since this. And got an 8085 not set yet), it looks getting [bigger/better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoEGcTtR-Q) quality and strongest conception ... (IMO at 1st looking in hand). As bearing and also 10mm shaft against 12... for example.
Did the high kV could be an issue on a big motor like this ?..
refound some old vid of my APS 63xx, sound a little bit like you :

Cool setup anyway ! :smiley: I will follow this crazy big toy setup !!

12s8p?  Nice!  I am no expert on building batteries having only built one myself so far but it seems to me that by using only 2 layers of 8mm x .15 nickel you are limited to only about 40 amps max capacity in your series connections which is not nearly enough for what those motors will draw or what that pack could produce.  But maybe you know something I don't?...

I don‚Äôt know a lot about batteries myself. From what I understand from reading replies from some battery guys in here is that the parallel connections don‚Äôt have to be so robust. The series connections is where it‚Äôs needed most. We‚Äôll see though. If things get hotter than I‚Äôd like or the motors don‚Äôt het the acceleration desired I‚Äôll try adding some copper wire to the parallel connections to see if it makes a difference

I guess you don't understand what I am saying.  Your parallel connections would be more than adequate if it was only handling parallel current but because you don't have direct cell to cell series connections it must also handle series current and is therefore insufficient.

Oh I see you think the distance bereeen the series connections are too far apart and probably not enough causing the voltage to travel down to each connection before crossing.

Since all he's talking about is nickel strips how do you figure out how much copper wire do you need? These are 1/2' strips about 1mm thick

added two more strips of copper. Thats gotta be plenty lol

Two strips of that size should be enough to handle the total current between each series group but the issue is, like you mentioned, because you have the copper soldered near each end of each series group, the current produced from the cells in the middle of each series group first have to run through a lot of thin nickel strip to reach the copper  at the end which isn't ideal. 

I would recommend soldering another two evenly spaced copper strips to each series group in between the two copper strips you've currently got soldered. This would mean that the current from each series group cell only has to travel across a couple cm of nickel strip at most to reach a copper strip.

Another thing, be VERY careful with the sharp edges of the nickel strips on the positive sides of the cells. 

If one of the sharp edges of one of those strips pierces or scratches through the insulation around the positive cell terminals, you're going to get a short and a battery of that size that's closely packed together like that could very quickly start a runaway effect which will result in the whole pack going up in flames...

Ideally you should be rounding the corners of the strips so they can't come in contact with the negative part on the cells positive side. Would also really recommend using insulation paper rings as well. Unfortunately a little bit difficult to do at this point.

No worries, again, just be careful you don't get any bits of metal that you're rounding off end up falling in between the positive and negative points and shorting something :stuck_out_tongue:

Liquid electrical tape sounds like a good idea, you'll want to leave a small gap somewhere though so that if the worst case does happen, you're not completely blocking the cells from venting

 Same issues with mine. Its very aggravating when the owner knows about these issues and still sells and ships these faulty motors around the world. After days of trying to get ahold of Bruno @AlienPowerSystem I cannot seem to get any answers. He has replied a couple times and he's tried to send me more 8072's  ( a new design) but I cannot waste anymore time on a faulty motor so I suggested the 8085 which people have had good luck with. Now theres no communication at all and Im tired of sitting here having my time wasted. Does anyone out there know how to get Bruno to respond and try to resolve this issue as fast as possible?  @Silverline @DK-Odense

Ok just about all done. Still waiting for BMS  and I ordered it on August 13th. Bruno from @AlienPowerSystem instructed me through the motor noise issue and there was a loose screw on the casing. All motor noise is gone and running very well now. So even though we had some issues with the 8072 early on I can say their customer service was excellent and I'll probably order some 250kv motors in the future due to these maxing out at 30mph, yes I want to faster. The torque on these are absolutely insane and I love it! The Drives from @Nowind are top notch and working well. I highly recommend his drives as not only the quality of them were great but he's also a great guy who will take his time to answer your questions and get you on the right path. Also so far the Flipsky Fsesc's are doing great handling the 80mm motors and big battery. According to the Bluetooth app Xmatic from @twan they are running ~30 degree Celsius cruising and ~35 degree running somewhat hard.

@Kug3lis I noticed the same thing when going from 170kv 6374 to 200kv 6384 motors as well, have also noticed my FocBoxes start thermal throttling much quicker. 

Currently I have each FocBox set to 40A battery/ 80A motor. Wondering how much much of a difference pushing the max current settings up a bit is likely to make.
