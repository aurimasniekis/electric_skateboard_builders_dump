Nice!  Look forward to seeing the build.  How are you controlling the RGB underglow - which kit?

What size wheels will it fit without risers - 83 the largest?

Very nice looking board. 

I love those Madrid downhill boards too! In fact, have a Madrid Kraken that needs to be finished. 

Looking forward to seeing your Trapstar built. Not much interested in the LED stuff though, that's for you US guys :innocent:

Hills in Vegas are multi story parking garages. Lol

Nice deck. I didn't know anyone used Formica on boards. You could even throw some straps on the bare deck, get a buddy with an ATV and a tow rope, and do some desert sandboarding. I still want to try that.

nice setup, i have that motor on 12s with a vesc and 97mm wheels. tops out at 24mph on 14/36t, 12-15 miles on 5.2ah.

I would say bigger wheels were better, i had 83s for a while but 97s ride nicer. might try kegels next. there for another build but....
