Hi guys here is my build so far. Using evolve trucks and AT wheels. Was hoping to use their mounts but went to a 63 motor. Was hoping to use 2x Turnigy SK8 6364 but they wont fit. Vesc is a Focbox and so far a 10S2P battery 30Q cells. Will be upgrading battery to 10s4p in the future. Using a simple anti spark I made with details found here. The enclosure I designed in Fusion 360 but it is more as a mould for the ABS one I will be vacumforming.  Firefly remote but still trying to get the telemetry working but atleast I can ride it as is.  I designed a custom motor mount, looks like crap but works lol. Anyway could not have done it without everything I have learnt here and still learning. Cheers to everyone.

Nice work on the your first build, looks clean. 

Your deck is backwards :exploding_head: unless your going front wheel drive? The wide area is for more front foot leverage. 

Will you be adding grip tape?

Yeah I tried it both ways but preferred the extra support on my back foot. Haven't decided on the grip tape design.

No I seem to prefer to have it thicker in the arse area lol. But it might change as I get into it.

You will prefer it the other way round eventually trust me.  You need the leverage on your front foot for control.  Especially when you get up to speed.  Nice build man!
