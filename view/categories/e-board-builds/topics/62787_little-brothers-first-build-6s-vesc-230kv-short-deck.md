First topic in a while... For those that missed me, I've still been building boards just haven't had the time to get on the forum now that I'm in college. Anyways, it was my little brother's birthday so I drive home for a weekend during this summer semester and the one thing he wanted was an eboard; so we built a board together!

Toned down all the settings on the VESC and only went with a 6s setup given his age. 

Here are some pics from the process! He's loving it!
