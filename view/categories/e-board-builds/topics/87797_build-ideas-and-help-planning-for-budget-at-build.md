Hello everyone! Very new here (to the point that I only just got permission to make my own posts haha). Initially posted a simpler version of this in the noob-help thread, but I think it was a bit too complex a topic for there really.

I'm justifying this build because I suffer from anxiety, and giving myself a hands-on project that will get me outside more often is kinda 'doctors orders'. 

SHOPPING LIST: (Incomplete)

Deck: 33" of compact canadian maple. The Restless Mantis. 

![Restless%20Board|663x500](upload://q6JOyJVYJy6n0Z5ftmA7TmSE4XR.jpeg) 

Wheels: Either Bergmeisters or DickyHo pneumatics.

Trucks: Unknown. Haggy trucks, or DickyHo trucks, unless I can find a decent third option that it compatible with a motor mount that I can source inexpensively!

Motor: Dual motors. Either [Maytech – 6374 170KV Sensored], or the Haggy 190kv motors (if I end up with a full kit). 

ESC: Originally I wanted a Unity, but it seems if I wait for that then I have to pretty much write off being able to actually rife this board this summer. And as I'm in england, that would probably mean not getting to ride the board until sometime next year lol. So currently going to be a Flipsky 6.6 dual, or a 4.2 dual. 

BMS: [Bestech 10s with switch](http://www.bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D596.html)

Casing - So the enclosure is a work in progress, but I'm currently modelling a variation of NESE modules for the batteries.

Check out @dickyho. He has an AT setup for sale that I am very much a fan of. All you will need is motors, a battery, esc and enclosure. The motor mounts, tires, bearings and trucns are all included. Pulleys too...   converted to Pounds, the setup was about 135 pounds or 177 dollars shipped

you have so much research to do. Also, your budget for a true all terrain isnt too crazy, but if youre expecting a luxury performance beast youre not going to get it.

You shouldnt bother with sixshooters if youre on a budget, instead go for some trampa wheels as paired with their tires, 7 inch or up. 

Your motors are fine, as well as your esc

Your battery is where you can follow the lipo path or the li ion path, and either is acceptable. youll need more money for a li ion pack to be comparable to the high output of a lipo pack, but im building a 12s7p pack of samsung 30qs and its going to be a monster. 

Your drive train is also another expensive aspect of an all terrain board, a gear drive seems to be out of your budget, and a belt drive is ok, but be prepared to buy alot of belts if you actually AT with it

Im building a board like this and its going to cost upward of 2500USD when its done, the price just keeps going up and up the more luxury and safety features I add to it, as well as increase my power and ride comfort... its all a trade for money :P 

good luck bro

an example of a good stripped down AT build is something like what @nowind has, a little 12s lipo pouch, a rock sold drive train and a flexy/ok at high speed trampa build. 

For something that is crazy decked out, you can look at something like @rich, who has a great AT/Street Trampa build

Quick answers from quickly reading your post:

1) longboard with pneumatics are a great combo

2) sealed pulley motor is a great way to get going. Gear boxes are new and less maintenance but more expensive until one comes out at an affordable price (on the horizon, not naming names)

3) no. Built it diy. It will be way better and you'll save more money in the long run.

Suggestions:

Wheels - Look into bergmeister wheels and pulley setup. @riverside.rider is a great guy and the product quality and customer service is unparalleled.

Motors - maytech sealed 6374 are highly recommended

Esc - focbox is great but not made anymore. Flipsky isn't bad. 

Charger should come with your battery. Use high c rated lipos or Samsung 30q lithium ion cells from a reliable retailer here. 

Enclosure - check out @bigben 

 Good luck man!

P. S. Haggy setup is @riverside.rider too.

Wanting to ride on the beach in think sand wil be your biggest obstacle.  
Hard packed sand isn't a big deal.
@Bobby is right,  if your om a strict budget it doesn't get much cheaper than the @dickyho kit.
Although i really like @riverside.rider 145mm pneumatic tires. They are just a bit more.  Unsure  of your budget. 
Maybe add a flipsky vesc (try and find a plus)

I would recommend dickyho, haven't used it myself but

 1. I have a AT board myself with same/similar tires that go on 6shooters and to me dickyho seems at par. I would have gotten dickyho instead if they were available back then

2. He stands by what he sells. You won't be disappointed.

I also use flipsky 6.6 that I had gotten for cheap during black Friday and I have no complaints. My motors are sealed and upgraded 6374 motors from flipsky. I have ridden a bit more than 400km on this setup and everything seems to be working great. 

I don't do crazy AT, but ride on grass on fields.

"Luxury performance beast" isn't what I'm aiming for haha. I'm pretty much just wanting a longboard with a motor that moves me along! 

I did notice this from a store in the EU (which is good enough as it means no import problems) - [eSkating](https://eskating.eu/product/electric-skateboard-3550-watts-conversion-kit-by-eskating/) - Which  comes with the motor I was looking at as well as a 10s2p samsung battery that I'd heard was decent as well. May look into sourcing the parts seperately and see if it works out much cheaper. 

But yeh, I'm looking to end up with something tidy, and which will get me along reliably. I'd rather configure it to give me decent torque and braking for all terrains, and leave the top speed at something below-average. I'd rather have fun carving along, than racing anywhere. (Kinda hoped a lot of the expensive modifications were for people wanting high-powered top-speed machines!)

Local beach is mostly fairly medium packed sand, to harder packed where the tide lines are. I'd avoid anything too deep and loose. 
I can stretch the budget maybe for the right things, I'll take a look at the riverside rider options, as those tires sound like a good bet.

I would argue to get the most out of your board, get a battery that's 10s3p or greater, preferable 30q, and you'll have at least a 10 miles range, worst case :slight_smile:


Chain drive might be an option? Use a high ratios to get high torque and low speed like you said

No idea how it performs in the sand though

really appreciate the reply, I've had so many helpful replies so fast I really didn't expect it haha!

is there a bergmeister setup that includes motor mounts etc like the dickyho ones? Just cos the motor mounts seem to be expensive if bought seperately (unless I'm just looking in the wrong places). Trying to look through riverside's stuff but it seems to be from last year

Ahh, he seems to be USA based (EDIT - Taiwan, apparently) :( looks like his shipping is free if I order enough, but I'd have to pay import fees etc so I'd have to add 25% on top of everything. Might still be worth it if it's cheap/good enough, but no returns or anything either.
Edit - Not USA, but still import fees which make it tricky. I'm looking anyway though as those wheels are pretty nice :)

Chain drive was something I considered, but would that not mean I'd have to get specific sprocketing for the motor and wheel, so the dickyho option wouldn't work for me? I'm yet to find a cheap/decent option that mentions chain, they all seem to be either belt or hub (and I don't think hubs would work for the wheels I want)

I mean I just went by the website lol, USA/Taiwan/Singapore is all the same as far as the pricing is concerned, if it's not in the EU then I would have to pay 25% in taxes to customs. 

Unless you mean research on the build, then I'm already way ahead of you. But a lot of the research I've done has mostly been telling me things I -shouldn't- get. I'm asking here to see if there's any like... good budget options. (researching for 'budget' options is a minefield, as a lot of it is either out of date or scams or overpriced).

Unless you’re sub 10st, even 8” on sand is iffy. Bergmeisters on pure sand have no chance

You’ll be wanting a 8” wheel setup minimum

Sorry for slow replies to people, turns out as a noobie I can only send 15 messages/replies per day, and I'd hit my limit :(

8" wheels hits the problem of needing to use different trucks (i assume, because of axel diameter and length), which also would mean none of the pulley kits working. I'm not set up to fabricate my own stuff. Unless there's such a thing as an adapter sleeve to make the wheels fit... but even then there's probably not enough width to fit them? 
I'd pretty much have to go full mountain board at that point? Unless I'm missing some obvious easy solution.

You will need a full scale MTB to handle grass, sand, trails etc. Anything else is not doing the trick on the long run. As soon as you go off road, you want a proper off road setup.

@trampa  Are there any MTB compatible drive kits though? All the builds I've found on here that use MTB 12mm trucks and wheels, all seem to have also used 3D printed and CNC machined parts to mount everything, which I unfortunately don't have access to. 

I may just have to limit my movement to places bergmeisters can handle.

Yeah just joking around. The nice thing about DIY is you can put stuff together and identify the weak links as you go. Unfortunately you have to be willing to learn and tolerate some stuff breaking/buying upgrades along the way. 

Or you can spend the big bucks and usually get good stuff. Can't speak to much as I have limited mountain board experience, but the focbox unity (I'm 100% biased) is a beast and will deliver enough power/reliability to last :smile:

@idea makes great MTB mounts

trampa does everything, if you have the skrilla

MBS boards arent really any more cheap or expensive than a trampa board, it comes down to rider preference and maybe the current deal (remember MBS has a perma discount for forum members...  cant remember it.... use the search function x) )

If you mean the decks, that's not the issue, the decks are pretty similar in price to longboards it seems. All the actual wheels and trucks etc are all similar too. The problem is the mounting for the motors/pulleys etc, which is already very hard to source in the UK even for the 'standard' 8mm sizings. 

I didn't know about @Idea  though, so I'll take a look / send him a message and find out what my options are.

I mean you can buy anything online, but then you have to add 25% on top of the cost, plus a pretty big chunk for shipping usually... maybe more accurate to say "hard to source for reasonable price". If money is no object, then anything is easy to buy!

@skunk thanks, I'll take a look at boardnamics too! Though he seems to be in San Diego which may make it a bit cost-prohibitive... does depend though, worth an ask for sure! 

Thanks everyone for the pointers. Once I've figured out what's possible with the wheels, then I can pick myself a deck to fit.

Budget esk8 street boards are totally possible.
But budget mtb...... that's kinda hard. Especially if you want range and enough torque to handle sand.
You're going to have to get over the whole paying shipping thing.

If you really don't want to deal with that.
Save and watch for used parts locally.

And @moon is right.

I was in same boat, this is the short version of what i did. If you want long range its going to cost.

£40 secondhand RKB All Terrain Mountain off ebay. 

RS components have flange clamps 373-7626 that fit the trucks for adding whatever motor mount i designed.

RS components for loads of other bits and bobs, timing belts, pulleys, retaining compound, caps.

* £130 2 x hobbyking vescs
* £130 2 x hobbeyking sk3s
* £65   2 x 6S1P 5000mah 30C (sale)
* £20 gt2b 

Gear ration 5.33, 12s, max speed 35mph. Acceleration (Hard to stay on) range 8 miles

I have a 3d printer, so printed both enclosures, 80 teeth pulleys, even the motor mounts. I later enhanced everything, heatsinks, active cooling, added caps, sensored the motors, battery meter, light bluetooth etc.

Next mod is to extend range to well past 30 miles, 84 samsung 30q batteries. £256, ouch.

IF you wanted to go the MTB route. And I take it you’re in the UK ?

A quality MTB can be done but above your budget still

Motors 2x maytec 6374 £190 (could only find 170kv at a decent price in the UK, you want lower Kv)

Deck, ultimate trucks, wheels, bindings. He’d accept £300
https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F223453294132

https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F113615740315

£60 2x pulleys (could find cheaper, maybe)
https://www.trampaboards.com/66-tooth-slave-pulley--fits-15mm-belts-to-superstar-hypa--primo-wheels-on-urban-motor-mounts-p-13572.html

£8 2x belts
 https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F262643290762

Vescs I will leave up to you other than say don’t buy cheap

Battery £200 cells £50 spotwelder £15 nickel strip

Misc £50

Box/boxes £50

Charger £30

Total £1016 plus shipping vescs and safety gear. Maybe cheaper if you cherry pick the bargains and wait for more.

Careful learning and a good bit of effort required. But you’ll not have any shit parts and will have a board that will last. And you’d get half your money back if you took care of it and chose to sell. 

GL with whatever you go with

Thanks I'll take a look through that :) though I think you might have missed out on the motors haha. (Edit: I see you added in some motors! Same ones as I have bookmarked in fact. You think I'd want lower than 170kv?)

The MTB option seems to be good for more use cases, but also is turning out a lot more expensive. Though I haven't fully priced up the longboard setup yet either, so it's going to come down to how much of a difference there actually is.

Yeh I hear what you're saying, and the beach is very local, but at the end of the day if I'm going to be on roads/parks/dirt for 95% of the time and only rarely near any sand, then the mountainboad setup would likely be massively overkill! So yeh I have to think about how much I'd actually want to go on the sand, and if it's not very often then I can rethink my plans. 

The attraction of the mountain board build though is that I can pretty much go anywhere. With the right wheels choice (even gummies are an option) it wouldn't even be an issue to stick to roads with it.

Edit: I don't think I've seen any sealed decent motors lower than 170kv, those maytecs were the best I'd seen (so far)

So I may have an alternative option in progress, though it involves some testing and research so for the moment I'm going to move on to figuring out the bits that neither of our lists covered haha. 

So I've been playing around with [calc.esk8.it](http://calc.esk8.it/#{%22batt-type-lipo%22:1,%22batt-cells%22:7,%22motor-kv%22:190,%22system-efficiency%22:85,%22motor-pulley-teeth%22:15,%22wheel-pulley-teeth%22:60,%22wheel-size%22:150}|). I do love me some maths :slight_smile:
 
So at this point my motor will either be a 170kv or a 190kv. (These are what I'm using for my plans for a couple reasons, I may recalculate in future if I do find a different option). 

For a VESC, the current (haha electricity puns) option is the [Focbox Unity](https://www.enertionboards.com/focbox-speed-controller/focbox-unity-dual-motor-foc-controller-esc/). It's an expensive option, but it's also dual-motor ready and comes decently protected which saves some headaches. It's one of those areas where cutting corners might cause big problems, so not sure it's worth doing (though I'm looking for used ones on the off-chance). 

Batteries... probably li-ion, depending on whether I can find a decent lipo package. Currently looking at either a 10s2p or a 7s3p layout. Was going to be 8s2p/8s3p, but I found somewhere where I can get a deal on a pre-packaged set, but they go from 7s to 10s. I could maybe jump up to a 10s3p, but it's a lot of extra weight for range I probably wont use. 
On the plus side, this will give me a BMS, charging socket and charger, power switch and an LCD screen. 
EDIT: Dammit. Prices were without VAT. Might have to find another option. AlienPowerSystems has some I may look at. Job for another day. 

Is there any major issues I'm going to have going with a 7s3p over a 10s2p? I know it'll have a lower top speed (not a problem), will there be other issues with a dual motor setup?

Nothing bad with 7s, but better go with 10s. 
Also chose the 170kV version for your motor.
You can have a look for this lipos
https://hobbyking.com/de_de/turnigy-battery-heavy-duty-5000mah-6s-60c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html

Those are 6s, but they also have 4s etc so that you can build up your 10s config.
I run this lipos in a 1P only and so far very happy with them. Range will be around 10km so you might need one more set to get the range you want.

I may have to, as the rebuilds I had found with bms/charging/lcd/switch all wired in ended up over £300 for a 10s2p. Looking into the diy option with  Lipos. Will need a good enclosure though to keep it safe and tidy.

If you go top mount battery that is all no problem.
You can just use a lunch box or print you something nice. Get a good balance charger and just take the lipos out of the box for charging.

If you speak about 10s2p i hope you speak about lipos as well. A 10s2p with LiIon wouldn’t give you the discharge current you will need.

Oh, no, I was talking lion. Samsung 30Q. It was a battery pack that’s been used by a lot of people, I didn’t realise it would be an issue.

You can get the 10s2p pack from that cheep site I wouldn’t recommend to buy anyway.
10s2p 30q would give you 40a max discharge or 20a per motor. That might be ok for a hub street board or something with a single drive but definitely not for a all terrain.
Sure it will work somehow but the voltage sag will be that big that you can’t climp any mountain as soon as you come below 85% of your battery.
If you want to go low p than use high C (40-60c) rated lipos. With LiIon 18650 cells don’t go below 4p.
Good night 😅

i would say a 2 p is only good for flat roads on a comutet street board have a look at some of the videos out there with telemetry pulling 45a+ from the battery is normal on a hill (if less than a 10s this will increase the amps used even more). A Q30 3p is rated to 45a by Samsung but in real world testing we happily run it at 60a. That makes 3p 18650 your bare minimum in my opinion.

The main problem you have is brakes. Q30 are rated to 4a charge rating so a dule motor set up on a 2p and you will have 4a battry regen per motor to stop. You brakes will most likely cut out after a few seconds and free wheel on a AT board. You can set higher settings to batt recharge but your exseeding manufactures max ratings at your own risk.

The people who build AT boards and use 18650 seem to normally use 5p-8p and that will eat up your entire budget for just the battery pack alone. 

Lipos have better discharge and charge ratings if you pick the right ones and at a cheaper price. Down side is the battery life cycle is shooter and the chemistry is a bit more flammable (all battery’s are dangerous and flammable some more so than otheres)

Ones you do the research I’m purity sure you go down the LiPo rout. it’s some thing you can easily upgrade later down the line ones you built up exsperiance and fined out what you think limits your build the most and what to change if it’s more voltage speed or more amps/WH for range or other parts. 

My advise is take a serous look at lipos for your build and make a chose on your requirements of what your think is most important. 

Ps when looking at other builds also consider the total price of there build and were thay spent there monny just because there using unity’s, 4p10s Q30 and maytech motors I bet most of them builds are over £1000 double your budget. Unity are the new thing and advatised 2nd hand for more than new because people want them now. so I can’t see you getting one cheeped any time soon. Look at the flipsky good budget esc people will be upgrading from them to unity’s so I’d exspect some good bargains to be had second hand there to consider.

Do you have access to a 3d printer?

Printing pulleys in petg could save some money short term. Also you could print angled risers and avoid using an ATB deck, light sand use you could definitely go without bindings which saves some more

There is zero doubt that you’re looking at a lipo battery

As darkie02 says, If you doing MTB you will need a lot of 18650s in parallel or it will be very underwhelming, they will run hotter and their lifespan will be shorter. for example im building 7p. Stick to lipo if you are on a budget.

Also you dont need a BMS with 18650s, you could just make  2 x 6s packs, and charge them with a hobby balance charger. As i plan to do, i like to keep an eye on my batteries.

A 3D printer makes everything easier, something like a CR10. You might want to consider buying one first and stretching out your build time and finances over more time. I printed motor mounts, pulleys, controller, enclosures, quick swappable lipo housings, might even print some new wheels, foot holders are on my list too.

The weird issue I found myself in yesterday was that LiPo batteries were far more expensive, and everywhere I found them in bundles would only ever do 8s1p / 10s1p / 12s1p etc for huge amounts. I realise today that I'm just an idiot. The reason they're expensive is cos they have much higher C and mah ratings! So they're not direct comparisons to the liIon setups. In my defence, I was very tired when I was researching lol. 

On the bright side this means the AlienPowerSystems packs are much more reasonably priced than I thought. Unfortunately the option is to either go with a 10s4p setup with 10C per cell (which I think means 40C?) with LiIon batteries, or their LiPo packs seem to be 10s1p 10000mah, but only 35C (which you guys are saying isn't enough). I guess APS mainly tailors for normal usage. 

Trying to find a source for the Turnigy packs, but they seem out of stock / discontinued. Would a 6s and a 4s together to make a 10s1p 60C be enough? (in power, i mean, not speed). Or would I need to get 4 packs for 10s2p?

C-rating is connected to your capacity.
The higher the capacity the lower the c-rating can be for the same theoretical discharge....
But well...c rating is bullshit as there is no real norm how to measure that.
For LiIon have a look on the data sheet of the cell you want to use better. 30q - 15-20a discharge. Forget about c rating.
With lipos it’s similar. You can just hope that the higher c-rating gives you better packs, buuuut in this case better use what other people recommend you out of good experience.

I linked you some good and cheap lipo cells.
You can get them on hobbyking.
And yes you can use one 6s and one 4s. Just take care they have the same capacity and the same c-rating.
If you want better lipos than that, go with the graphen lipos from hobbyking as well.

Hi yeh, those Turnigy ones are the ones I've had in mind for LiPo's for a while, but they're what I mean when I say 'out of stock or discontinued'. Hobbyking doesn't have any 6s in stock, and other stores have them listed as discontinued. Amazon seem to have a couple for more money, but the seller is hobbyking apparently so I'm not sure that's an accurate listing lol. 

I've sent a couple pm's to people in the UK who apparently have a lot of battery building experience, so I'm going to get some info about what's recomended and the best way to get a pack built and wired up, and then I'll report back when I figure out the option. Also looking on the used forum in case someone is already selling what I need!

It’s not a big deal to wire up a bms.
Just depend on the bms you choose. If you need help with it, just post what you choose and we can help you with wiring everything up.
If you don’t know yet, you have two options: to get a bms for charge only or charge and discharge. Both have advantages and disadvantages. If you look for a good bms than google for bestech. They make some good ones.

One thing to consider with bms and lipos is that you should minimize the time the packs are fully charged. Best would be about 3.8v per cell when ever you don’t use the packs. So best to drain your pack till that voltage round about and only charge it up befor you go for the next ride. Don’t let the pack sit for 2 or more days fully charged. That can pretty fast damage your packs.

Hello again everyone, I'm back armed with much learned information.. which has mostly led to even more confusion! Huzzah!

I hit some constraints in my build when I realised that when I transport it it will need to fit in the boot of my car. This gives me a max board size of 36" (maybe ending up with a 33"). So I'm cutting back on the 'all terrain' and making a slightly more sensible somewhat-compact build (still using bergmeisters or similar). 

So
1) I'm still concerned by batteries. I would certainly still want decent consistent braking, which I believe is based on the max-charge rating of the battery? Which is quite low for li-ions. It seems I'll be needing 4s or 5s to get reliable braking with li-ions, meaning I'd probably end up with something like 8s4p or 8s5p. (I could up it to 10s, but I believe that only gets me additional speed, and I doubt I'd even go over 15mph anyway (8s should get me to 20mph, according to loaded calculations). 

With Li-Po, I can get a higher braking ability (that is, if the way I'm working it out is correct, the search on this forum has been very vague on the braking front, I honestly don't think people on here use their brakes much :P) even with a 1p battery setup. Which means I could go for something like an 8s2p and all I would lose out on is range (but it seems like I'd have enough for my purposes). And if I plan my space I could probably increase to an 8s3p in the future. 

*Actually, because lipo packs are quite a lot thicker than liion, and my board is small, it's possible I'd have to go with 3s packs instead of 4s (because the 3s are thinner). So 9s2p would be the easier config. Unless I have enough room for a bunch of 2s packs, but I'm pretty sure using 2s will limit me to 10s1p.*

Does this sound about right? Or is dropping from a 10s losing me more than I am thinking? I've been told a couple times that 10s should be my minimum, but I've not been given any actual reason why that would be haha, and the only difference the maths is giving me is top speed. (and some range). 

Basically need sanity checks on this. I've ALSO been told that I should totally avoid lipo because it's dangerous and liion is much more reliable. And this is from people who are quite highly respected on this forum, so I'm really wary of throwing my eggs into the explosive lipo basket. I had a great offer on a 10s5p battery setup with BMS and everything all thrown in, but unfortunately I don't think it will fit on the board :frowning: 


Thats the long part out of the way. The shorter one:

2) I still need to figure out a BMS and a VESC. I know all the different types now, and I even know the differences between some of them. But the Dual VESCs like the Unity and Flipsky are very expensive and/or not available until some unknown date. I could get two single-motor VESCs, but I've had some trouble finding one that didn't seem like a knock off. Much the same with BMS... the two I've found from each end of the spectrum is either Bestech (good but expensive) and the Dickyho BMS (waterproof and cheap and... reliable? maybe?)

Have been scouring the used parts forum, so hopefully something will pop up.

Originally it was a tongue in cheek "£500", which I think I wrote somewhere but I don't know where. But I also did say I knew that wasn't going to happen lol. 
Budget is as cheap as I can, while still being decently reliable and nice to ride. I'm using it as a project piece, teaching myself some new skills etc. Hence I am planning to build a remote from parts instead of buying a premade. I also bought myself a 3D printer recently, and this will be my first big project to involve it. (Things like a custom NESE module, enclosure prototyping, etc)
So budget is... I mean as cheap as I can get it. I'm happy to sacrifice speed, as I'll barely ever go faster than like 15mph anyway (if that), but reliability and safety (brakes and battery wise) are more important. I'll call it £800 to put a fairly realistic figure on it.

EDIT: 
ALSO! I just read your name... I think I just read like 100 pages of a thread with you in it, where you had customised someones NESE module variation! Winfly maybe? Your version was really nice as I recall, I think I sent a request for google drive access to nab your schematic haha. (if that was you)

Winfly did mention he may release his designs, but only after he'd recouped some of his R&D spendings (which is perfectly valid, as he spent a lot of time and effort on coming up with a slimline alternative to the NESE). But before I go too far down that road I need to be sure I'm actually better off with Li-Ions in my build.

Personally I don't think lipo is more dangerous than lion in esk8 application. Both have their plus and minus on safety. 

When your building a lion pack there is way more ways it can short it self out and make a fire then just a few lipo packs hooked up with XT plugs. **So lion requires much higher battery building skills before it can be considered safe in this application.** 

Lions explode like mini rockets if they ever get into thermal run away. :scream: while lipo "only" shoots foot long flames out the side but generally stays in one spot. 

Both will burn up if over charged, lions should be a bit more graceful at this. 

If you beat an individual cell with a hammer lions are better at this kind of abuse. But that is just single cell not a large multi cell pack. 

There is 3 main ways to make lipo catch fire. 1. over charge 2. physically penetrate with something conductive 3. over discharge/current into thermal run away. But I don't think that would be possible in an esk8 unless you used a way way undersized lipo. 

For lion the main thing I have seen is thermal run away while ridding the board, probably cause by short circuit from pack construction error / heavy vibration environment of an esk8.

Let's get back to this post.
There is nothing bad at all with 8s. 
The only argument I could imagine is, the higher the voltage the lower the current, buut than again the higher the voltage, the faster you drive which means you need more power, which result in higher current draw again.

Don’t worry about the braking current. I would more worry about the voltage sag if you use a LiIon pack below 3p.
If you brake you don’t brake for 1h constantly. 
If we look at a 30q cell the fast charge rating is 4a per cell for a full charge cycle. If you brake for 20sec that current can be slightly higher without to damage the cell. 
Also consider that some of your brake energy is used producing heat and magnetic fields.
If you want to go as low as possible I would recommend you to have a look at the Sony vtc5a cells. They 25a cells (rated in the data sheet even at 35a) and a 8s3p or 4p would be ok.
Just don’t expect super power and endless range.

If you want a budget remote and happy with trigger style, than get a gt2b and print your own case like the sparkle. That’s 25€ + the filament and 1hour for getting all together.

If you want to go budget vesc than have a look at the hw4.12 vescs. I think people have found the Flipsky 4.12 on eBay for 50€. I would than definitely add one of the full enclosed heat sinks on them to get a good performance out.
Something like this
https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/aluminium-case-fsvesc
You can get those for sure also on eBay for cheaper.

While you're right that they're probably both pro and con in safety aspects, I've just gone through some calculations and for a roughly equivalent battery setup between the two, for the size / weight / price of the battery, liion seems to come out ahead. Lipo has much higher discharge and charge rates (but apparently I don't need any higher charge rate for safe braking?) but they seem to be overkill, and the liion gives the same speed and greater range.

Considering I have space and weight restrictions, (and limited budget) liion seems to come out ahead. As long as 8s4p is enough power. (even 10s4p might fit, but 10s5p I think will be too much)

I had looked into other cell types, but the 30q seemed universally recommended as the best option.
I had seen those older vescs on ebay but wasn't sure if they were worth risking. Hasn't there been a lot of updates to the software since then? I assume 4.12 was old compared to 4.2 and 6.6, but I was assuming it referred to software versioning and maybe it doesn't.

I think off-road might be overstating things, I'm talking grassy parks and gravel mostly, not mountain trails and corn fields. Though maybe I need more discharge even for that, I honestly don't know as I'm unable to test until I build aha.

Edit: I mean the full mtb builds (that don't use lipo) seem to use somewhere between 10s4p and 12s5p, which either has the same 60c discharge rate or is slightly higher at 75. Lipo is the only way to get a big boost to 200+, but that doesn't seem to be a requirement going from the build logs..

The 30q is recommend as they have a high capacity and a high discharge. For a 4p plus pack they outstanding the best 18650 cells for esk8 for now. 
As soon as you go 3p or less or 5p and more there are other cells which may fit better or are cheaper.
That’s why I would rather recommend the vtc5a for a 3p pack if you can accept the 500mAh less capacity per cell. If I remember right the price for 30q and vtc5a on nkon should be pretty similar.

About the vesc, you mixed something up between hardware and software.
You can run also the newest vesc sw on a hw4.12 based vesc.
Sure there have been made some improvements from the 4.12 hw to the 6.x hardware and I‘d rather would go with a hw 6.x based vesc than a 4.12 if I have the choice, but it doesn’t mean that the 4.12 is a bad vesc version. Especially not if you on a budget.
I wouldn’t recommend to buy any 4.20 vescs. The once you get for now have pretty much faults. So as you can see, not every new hardware version need to be an improvement.

For the record I think lion is better due to range and cycle life. But it usually cost more and is more difficult to build a quality / safe pack then lipo.  

Unless you need super high amp draw then lipo wins in most cases. Which is popular  for heavy off road or race boards. 

Lipo is usually cheaper depending on your sources and easy to make a parallel pack.

Lipo would only seem to be cheaper if I got for something like a 9s2p setup with the cheaper 30C or 45C (non graphene) packs. Which I'm told may suffer from bad sag, along with its pretty short range.

These packs end up at around 2.5kg total, vs 1.5kg for an 8s4p liion setup. Theyre a little cheaper but not enough to make up for the weight/performance.

I plan to use nese modules if I go liion, which I hope will improve the chances of making something safe.

I use 12s1p 5Ah of the heavy duty hobby king lipos. That’s 70€ per 6s pack or 140€ per battery. Those are 60c and sag is pretty low.
The range is average with 12-15km but well for that price not that bad I think.

Interesting... when I suggested using a 12s1p LiPo setup I was pretty much told it wouldn't work at all. Mostly if I ever needed to actually go up a hill, or use the brake. I did wonder how that worked, considering it still had loads more discharge than liion ever would, but I just assumed I didn't know enough about how batteries worked.

Pretty much everything from 6s to 12s works.
Some even ride 13s on vescs. Sure if you run on the limits of components than the possibility that something fail is higher, but that’s your own decision. With some cheap vescs like the Flipsky 4.20 and dual 4.20 it’s for now not really recommend to use 12s. But 10s isn’t bad at all either.

Ah no sorry, I didn't mean that 12s1p wouldn't work because of too much voltage. I meant I was told it wouldn't work because of being too weak in amps and suffering from too much sag. (just repeating what I was told, I was surprised myself as it should have more available amps than liion).

The 12s1p seems to work out the same weight, and £30 cheaper, than an 8s4p liion. The liion has a lot more range, while the lipo has huge discharge and charge rates. 
Thing is, nobody seems to have weighed in with how much discharge and charge is actually -needed-. I thought a VESC had a limit on the max voltage it could handle, so wouldn't 250A be totally unecessary? If the VESC can only handle 60A at a time, then wouldn't the 60A and extended range of a lion pack be more efficient? (I really don't know, these things don't seem to be part of the equations on this forum lol)

What actually is the number of amps charge rate required for consistent reliable braking on an eboard? It would seem like a figure everyone on here should know off by heart, but instead it seems like nobody has ever worked it out. It certainly hasn't been obviously written in any of the noob guides (I seriously doubt I've missed it in all my reading).

Liion 8s4p gets 12A, LiPo 12s1p gets 25A. Which would imply that LiPo would be more reliable for brakes. Except if braking only ever needs 6A or something, then it's completely irrelevant because both packs will handle it easily. 

**did some more research before finishing writing this post** 
After further research, it seems braking with -8A on battery and -50A on motor should work decently? So again, LiPo seems to add excessive charge rates that are never used, at the expense of range? 

Dont get me wrong, I'd prefer to use a LiPo 12s1p if it worked out giving more torque and braking ability like it implies by the ratings, but it seems to limitations are in the VESC (and also the ability to actually stay standing on the board). 

Plus, I won't be using the board every day, it's likely it wont be used for a few days or mostly be used at weekends. And it seems LiPo will require much more supervision and being discharged for safe storage and only charged on the day of use. And being charged and stored in explosion/fire proof bags or ammo boxes, apparently. Which is fairly scary. 

Honestly surprised there doesn't exist a battery that doesn't burn down your house just by being charged lol.

You will average draw 25-35A from the battery.
On peaks a bit more, but if you don’t live in a super hilly area or go crazy off-road, you will probably never hit 80A. A 4p 30q in this case is totally enough. If you build a off-road only board I would definitely go higher in the p-count to hold the voltage sag down.
Don’t get confused by the c-rating of the lipos. If you take a bit less of the half max discharge you calculate, you will get a realistic value from good packs. 60c 5Ah you can draw maybe 100-150A max from. 300A would probably melt down your 10awg wires anyway 😅
I see you doing a good work in researching and you right, if you just drive from time to time, get the LiIon pack. They damage way slower fully charged like lipos. You can store your board ready to go. With lipos you have to set them into a low voltage level each time you not going to use your board for some longer time.

Haha yeh, I always massively research / overthink / overplan / overengineer any project I work on. This is why I usually end up spending more than I need to, and taking longer than I should, but usually I do end up with a pretty decent end result so it's not all bad :slight_smile:

The area I live in is actually very flat in general. From my window there is a single hill, and it's a landmark because for miles around it it's all flat land. But then I also live near a place called cheddar gorge, which is an area with flat land, followed by a long sweeping/winding somewhat steep climb, followed by more flat land. 

However much more common will be riding over short grassy areas like parks, as there's a lot of those around. 

So, going back to the original question, but assuming the use of Li-Ion for the moment - Would I be better off with S or P for the 'light terrain' use? Assume I can only fit 40 cells on my little board, so it would be 8s5p vs 10s4p. 

I -believe- the 8s5p gets me more consistent power/torque on the hills/terrain, as well as less potential braking issues, while the 10s would get me a higher top speed... and that's all?

1:4 gearing is where I'm going (15/60T), and I was looking at the Maytech 170kv motors. I was also recommended the cheap motors from Dickyho, but I'm currently waiting to hear back from him about whether he has access to a sealed motor. May be overkill but it seems for around here sealed motors might be less likely to get damaged. (I suppose I could come up with some kind of motor shroud though to protect from grit/sand etc...)

EDIT:
However one great side effect of todays discussion is that it is now decided that 4p will work for me. Which means I can start looking into and prototyping 4p battery enclosures. 

So as far as VESC's go, was the best bet to pick up two 4.12's from ebay or similar? 

Also for BMS, is the Dickyho waterproof BMS any good? Or is it required to get a Bestech for safety?

I have the sealed maytechs 6374 and they hold up pretty strong so far. If you decide to go that way, keep in mind they are a bit longer than usual 6374.

Regarding vesc, well you on a budget, so I think it’s clear for you that you can’t get everything you want.
If you get a Flipsky 4.12 or similar you will be limited to 35A max per vesc. After that they get hot pretty fast. Adding a heat sink can add some amps on top, but also add some extra moneys.
Next step would be a Flipsky 4.20 plus. Should be good for 10s without cut outs. After that you could go up Flipsky dual 6.6 or focbox, focbox unity, but that might be out of your budget.

Focbox Unity current price isn't that bad, unfortunately it also doesn't exist and probably won't exist for several months. 

Flipsky Dual would be my next bet potentially. But again you're right it's not too cheap. 

Correct me if I'm wrong though (which I very well might be), but isn't the VESC amp max based on battery amps discharge, and not the motor amps? And as the peak discharge of my pack would be 76A, then 35A per VESC ends up being about right? Not much headroom, but I'd probably find a heatsink version.

Your conclusion is right. The rating is based on the bat amps, not the motor amps. That’s why I said a hw 4.12 based vesc wouldn’t be that bad if you on a budget and anyhow don’t plan to hit it too hard. But well it’s never bad to run things somewhere in the middle of there capabilities than on the top or low limit. Oversizing in this case isn‘t that bad. 
@shaman is working on a improved version of the hw 4.12 for a good price which could be an alternative for you as well.

Dispite what some say lithium ion 18650 cells are nearly always safer. Nearly all have a current interupt device (CID), thermal fuse (PTC) and safety pressure vent on each cell! In fact if i understand the spec sheet correctly, you can short circuit a Samsung 30q, and it wont go bang. Within 20secs its current and voltage will drop to nil and its peak temp will only reach 100c.I dont think the same can be said for most Lipos. You can also individually cell fuse them, though theres debate on the benefits of doing so.

Also the advantage of running higher voltage is less current draw, my average current average is only 15a (Battery) on my mountainboard with 12s. Everything runs cooler. I think the consensus here is to stick to 10s max though.

https://batterybro.com/blogs/18650-wholesale-battery-reviews/18306003-battery-safety-101-anatomy-ptc-vs-pcb-vs-cid
https://eu.nkon.nl/sk/k/30q.pdf  (See the short circuit page)

I should add that when you put them in series and the voltage is over 30v the CID can arc when activated and the PTC destroyed if activated, im guessing this is why tesla fuse there cells. This research doesn't seem to come up in forums.

[quote="Andy87, post:80, topic:87797"]
The 30q is recommend as they have a high capacity and a high discharge. For a 4p plus pack they outstanding the best 18650 cells for esk8 for now. As soon as you go 3p or less or 5p and more there are other cells which may fit better or are cheaper. That’s why I would rather recommend the vtc5a for a 3p pack if you can accept the 500mAh less capacity per cell. If I remember right the price for 30q and vtc5a on nkon should be pretty similar.
[/quote]

I know this was a while back, but since then I've gotten a bunch of my plans in place, and am at the point where I need to actually order some cells!

You're right that 30Q and VTC5a are basically the same price now. Probably going to be fitting a 10s4p pack to my board. So would there be any benefit going for the VTC5a cells? I know I lose a little range, but don't I also gain better braking and discharge? Though there's only so much braking I could use before I get thrown off the board, so if the 30Q is already more than adequate at 4p then I guess I'll go for them.

For an all terrain like you plan the 30q should be fine. With vtc5a you might have a bit less voltage sag, means you could still blast when you below 40% battery, but that’s just what I would expect from the specs I can get out of both cells. I don’t have a 30q pack, so unfortunately I can’t really compair real life performance.

And don’t worry about braking. You will have good brakes with either of them.

The flap covering the drop-through? I hadn't gotten around to finishing the holes, but the idea was that it would be part decorative, part truck-riser, and part securing for the enclosure as it would have 4x bolts running through it. 

It would mean that that section of enclosure could only be removed if the trucks were also unbolted, but I was going to try and design things so that the battery modules could be removed from the open end if needed, so that section of enclosure wouldn't ever -need- to be removed. 

Also trying to figure out how I want to bolt the stuff to the deck. I don't want to have bolts going straight into the wood, as if I ever need to remove and replace components it might weaken the inserts and split the wood. Not sure. Was thinking of having permanently bolted-in mounting brackets, and then having the batteries etc bolted to those brackets. Might be unnecessary though. Also considering using the rubber vibration mounts, or just thick rubber washers. 

Oh and the edge goes thin because it looks nice in the graphic haha. I may round it off a little so it doesn't end up as a razor-thin edge.

So I'm down to the last two components. 

VESC - Probably going to get one of the newly updated Flipsky 4.20 Duals. Seems they're (meant) to have fixed any capacitor issues now. The 6.6 would be better, but probably hugely unecessary for my needs, and not worth the extra $100. (or at least this is my thinking, by all means someone chime in with an alternative, especially if it's cheaper!)

Remote - I want to have a fancy one, with the LED screen and all. Considering making myself a Firefly Nano. But in the short term, I should probably get a pre-made one so that I at least have something reliable for testing with. All the usual options though, I'm struggling to find for sale in the UK (at least under the names given on this site). Closest options are things like the Flipsky one for $50. Any thoughts/suggestions?
