Hi, well In was looking for an eBike but due to legality in Ireland, I was just clicking about until well yes I thought of eMTB

...and found out that in fact it was 'a thing' already and maturing quickly, and well I think it's more stealthy and possibly more full than one of those Vector eBike thingamijigy's, it will make it's habitat on the beach and surrounding environs.

So I'm joining the gold-rush, more meat for the newbie grinder, can I have some constructive help on componentry?

Mixed reports on Alien, but  - dual VESC to twin 6374 kv190, to be precise looking at this motor since will be in beach environment
http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/alien-6374-hev-outrunner-brushless-motor-200kv-3300w/
**Alternatives?**

Also ordered are 70 X Samsung INR18650-30Q 3000mAh - 15A, going to run them S107P for now.
Will increase to S12/P12 in time, **I have read that S12 can be too much for the VESCs?**

Will pack the 18650s together with a kit from India, slightly modified with brass/copper
https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=87434

It's an international collaboration -
VESCs from Taiwan - ordered from Vanda
Trampa MTB from UK - working on this
18650s from Holland - shipped
Custom motor mount from Poland, from your very own member @Idea 
**Charger?**

Considering a Tiny BMS from Lithuania **any better priced well-designed alternative to consider?**
...And cunning battery assembly made in India

Not everything is made in China anymore! I will soon have a 3D printer so who knows maybe something can be made in Ireland besides Guiness :four_leaf_clover:

I'll update the thread as I can

a Trampa emtb being stealthier than an ebike? I doubt that. From a legality point of view the eMTB is just as illegal if not more (there are at least some rules out there for ebikes).

Thanks for your input, I'm comparing to for instance a Vector steel framed based eBike with full susp. huge battery capacity, big-ass fat tires, huge speed and distance that I would only be tempted to use on the road, milk? sure back in 5...

I'm aware of the laws governing ebikes in Ireland; no power by a throttle, only assistance to pedal, 25 km/h - 250w limit, well that's is of no interest at all; a good spicy curry and my arse could provide more assistance, so stealth as meaning off-road.

It's not that I want to break the law, I just want to enjoy some eFun without annoying anyone else, I will be doing it when there are little or no people around in fairly deserted costal areas & maybe some back hills, I'm not looking for any attention whatsoever, I think the guards (police) are lenient if you use your common sense and play it like that.

I still think a bike is better for what you want. Why not build one yourself? The parts are basically the same. Mountainboards still need some rather smooth surfaces compared to a bike.

Ok I'm probably done with the buying of ancillary VESC H/W - stop me when I'm doing something dumbass-ish

I'll use some **5W/mK  thermal pad** to mount some mosfet heatsinks I had lying around.
And yes I do have a 1mm dicke...

Also I wanna put them somewhere dry, safe and lightweight and well, cool, so picked up this, if it doesn;t work out I'll have a killer sandwich box.

HIGHLANDER  SUR005  Water Resistant Aluminium Survival Tin
dimensions: 14 x 9.5 x 3.5cm, I have some grommets and some single-sided sticky foam padding to make it comfortable.

VESC PCB size: slightly less than 40mm x 60mm. How they will fit we will have to see

**Would you use fans?**  Remember I will be close to the Atlantic throwing up a lot of salty spray close by, I was thinking air-tight is better

Now that's a good point! 

But I should mention have sheets of leftover foam padding from a Shorai Lipo battery I bought for a Motorbike some time ago, I think they should insulate ok. The alum box weights 100gm which is another consideration, I did not think it was significantly heavier than a plastic box.

I agree I should be very careful about that, I may overkill and plasticoat spray the inside first or sumthing.

On the battery front I'm not sure what's available the choices are limitless, given the weld-free kit I'll be using LXW should be about 23X16(ish) with S10P7 config.

I will probably change the batter array format at some stage, but the MTN board I'm looking at has a width in the center of 23cm, I am talking with those who have the battery cap kit to find out how tall the cells are with the caps on, probably want more space for a BMS as well.

**edit:** The cells will be ~90mm in height with caps.

A case around  30cm X 23 and probably around 10cm tall would be ballpark

Nice that you are planning to join eMtb team :slight_smile:

Would suggest going dual and having powerful enough battery if there are hills nearby or u want to feel insane acceleration

So far ive experienced that rocky paths / trails are tolerable, definately not nicest to ride on but also not as good as just dirt trails with tree roots and sticks on the road.

Havent tried it on hard sand yet but it might be manageable if wheels dont sink in sand.

Happy building! Looks like u know enough from electronics side and check @ nowind and @ duffman builds, if u want some inspiration

Thanks for the welcome Okami,

Yeah there is plenty of pebbles and packed sand on the beach :slight_smile: slammed by the Atlantic all day and all night will do that

In the back hills there are some good trails too I think. I am looking after retro modding an older trampa with 8" wheels. Down the road I think a primo 9" with mud plugger may be what is really good for sand at least that's what trampa say, I'm pretty sure I've seen a pulley option on trampa for primos...

I'm about 75kg so I hope I'm not a sinker

I have stumbled across those builders, cooll I will  thread search

Cheers

mh im using primo strikers *9inch* but mud pluggers could be more aggresive (more suited for sand then)

With sinking.. I mean all sorts of tires sink in sand, if sand is too soft.. im actually not super knowing on what you need for getting through sand, maybe 'caterpillar''is the only option haha for soft terrain..

but yeh for sand your relatively little weight might help with 'blasting through' some softer patches of sand with more ease.

I compare sand with super loose rocks now.. I had some at dirt track I visited for only about 20minutes and when trying to go through loose rocks the tires just sank into the rocks and it were quite hard to steer or control the board itself..

This is something to think about.. but as said, hard surfaces will always be better than soft ones.. and once you build yours, you should have no problems with exploring each terrain and how it feels and how good your board can get through it..

Cheers!

I hope they work! primo tires are also wider than the 8", otherwise I will have to choose where I go carefully, there is grass and commonage to explore too, not all sand.

the 8" tired are 50mm & 9" primo tires are 62mm afaik

Catapillar? It's not so far-fetched

yeh, if youre good with mechanics maybe one day we would see something like that for mountainboards haha!

I actually saw today that some chinese are now kinda offering to attach hub motored trucks to the front or back of regular longboard, to make it a 'powered one.. at least it looked that way lol

this would give you 6 wheels to work with, and then it might be possible to attach caterpillar chains onto the 'back wheels'·. while keeping the front ones for steering and yes maybe even adding a sled lol :D

For softer sand get some air out of tires. Softer wheels go over softer sand, harder wheels will stick in to the sand. Kite boarders use soft wheels, i mean use the minimum psi as you can use that wheel not getting off hub. I have tried kiteboarding on beach with 2.5 bar in wheels they was just o.k. on hard sand but terrible in softer sand. Then i have tried 1bar or even less, i can't rememmmber, and it was just perfect. Soft wheels was rollind over sand like fat caterpillar. But of corse it works in middle soft\hard sand, on super soft and deep sand just walk😉

@ninja  Thanks for the tip! Hadnt really thought about this.. I knew offroad trucks use softer tires but didnt think it might help that much when going on soft sand :slight_smile:

If I ever come this situation I might try :D

Though for now I think I will stay out of sandy places as I usually hate how sand gets everywhere and needs to be cleaned out afterwards.

Hey thanks Ninja, yeah I figured out that hard surfaces you go to 50psi (limit for hypa) and then some more for top speed, so the opposite would apply,

This is the main reason that I was thinking about the primo hub with 9" tires which are also wider thanks

I seem to have a lot of PayPal notifications at the moment 😇

For the 18650 pack assembly I ordered -
* 100 X brass bolts
* 100 brass nut's
* 1m copper bar
* 1m tinned copper braid (to bypass the resistance of the supplied S/S parts in the VRUZEND kit

Not too sure on commercial options for a battery housing, I saw a couple and was a bit meh about them.
Any ones I liked from other builds ran towards something just picked up like a fishing tackle box. My requirements are pretty; simple weatherproof if not waterproof, lightweight, easy/quick to open and close.
I considered an ammo box, but too heavy and too conductive(see the valid comments on my VESC housing choice above), then I started looking at some specialist scuba cases which tend to have an equalisation valve built in, these again are still quite heavy although made of plastic and tend towards a very thick wall which makes them bulky given inner dimensions. I even looked at some sniper scope boxes ex-MOD(ministry of defence) and while that is pretty uber in iteslf those also ran into the problem above.

The closest to what I want that I could find is an external gang housing for keeping electrics dry in the garden, IPX rating, strong, plastic and big bonus has rubber ports for allowing cables in<->out without modification, like so
http://cpc.farnell.com/pro-elec/p2804b/outdoor-enclosure-with-4-gang/dp/PL10806

My caps means that a series 10 array will be 24cm long, I only wanted to spend a limited amount on the cells so I can only go 7 parallel, this is a good fit, problem is it weighs 1.5kg still too heavy :frowning:

Any suggestions on this?

@banjaxxed 
You could try to make 2 packs out of that.. Dunno what power capacity you need and what cells you gonna use.

Ive even seen now ebikers use 3 seperate packs. One in triangle (frame), one under the seat (smallest) and one even in backpack (biggest)

Sounds good, 

 I'll fill it up with the 70 cells I've bought along with a BMS and Vedder power switch and led power button. It will be a little roomy in there but not much

Then I'll almost certainly get another 10 in there making it s10p8, after that I could look at another one sittng on top  which I think I can easily stack and connect given the glands (sealed ports), I can double capacity that way.

Also the one I linked is not too heavy, dumbass forgot they also include a free 4 Gang 2m extension socket which must be almost 1kg

mh but I do understand your point now..

If you use 20A discharge cells and split the whole pack in 2 sides, then you get only about 4P setup with 10S..



Which would be around 36v x 80 A = 2880 W.. So about 1400w per motor does not sound bad but probably does not offer the 'full potential' motors or esc are capable of.

With your 10s 8p, you should probably achieve the desired 5700W or close to that, so each motor can pull at least 2.350 w or so, which I think is pretty decent and close to the limit anyways to what turnigy usually claims.

If i remember correctly turnigy could output about 60-70A at 36v that would be 2160 - 2520 W.
So exactly what you can get from your batteries more or less.. Though not sure how often you would see such power demand but still :) Extra cooling also might be necessary if you do plan to conquer the hills but that is just a subjective remark I got when I pushed 42A constant through 6374 sized motor and it got quite a bit hot but probably not near the limit.

Hehe, no I meant that I would add an entirely new battery case and more cells, an all day no recharge solution

hah okay.. 1.5kg doesnt sound a lot. I think my battery is at 2kg now, even if it has 36cells..

~45g x 36 = 1.620kg

add wires, foam, tape.. it might get close to 2kg easly (with box especially)

--

For 70 cells.. you might be looking at something like 3-4kg of battery weight I think.

will probably feel a lot more heavy.. and not as 'smooth' and silky in steering compared to snowboard.. but it is manageable and should still give lots of adrenaline, if youre after that :D while riding just on normal terrain and not on snow or water/air.

U will find out how each terrain feels and when you can and when cannot go fast :smiley:

A side comment I wanted to make:

You will find out that some of the trails /walking paths suck only because you got 4 wheels and 2 wheels might go on grass while 2 go on nice dirt patch of road

Ps. I made a noob move here by ordering cables that are too long.

The quality of the cabling on these VESC is very good /silicone sheathing, I just wish I has asked for the same 5.5mm bullet connectors but within inch from the PCB.
 **Reason:** I want to be able to disconnect the VESCs from the motors. Then on the other side of the bullet connectors I will pass each of the phase wires through an IPX68 M12 gland (3mm-6mm cables afaik) to the outside world, et voila a level of water protection, on the other side a Y connector also ordered too frigging long duh, using XT90 connector, again wish I has them close to the PCB. There is two VESCs, so 4 cables exiting the other side, again through glands I have just enough of them.


I will trim the cables that are attached to the motors back down to the last inch and I guess I am going to solder and shrink wap there. some 10AWG wire back to the 5.5 gold plated bullet connectors inside the enclosure

Will have to think about VESC enclosure again, although size could probably work if you were bloody minded enough with some extreme realignment of the connectors and PWM, risking a short seems a bit daft.

you should think about a capacitor upgrade. The one you got is from one of the earlier Vesc-Versions, which killed a lot of DRVs. So it´s safer to add a few caps in parallel to get rid of these problems. Also try to keep your motor wires as short as possible, these are huuuuuuuuge :smiley:

Here's another enclosure, I like it but in order to get a 10s fit I'd need the cells closer together, this will only fit a 9s5p Vruzend pack. Note the dinky compass in the lid. I wanted to use 12mm pure nickel strips which is the reason the nickel looks mashed in. The series connections are 2mm silver plated copper wire

That will work just fine. If you want the holes, make sure they are symmetric! 2 hours is realistic for the job. Two layers of masking tape on the deck helps to prevent markings from the high saw.

Yes chef, I plan to pay extra, extra attention to the holes and I will not be chaging any sizes as I'm sure there is some physics at play there in terms of adverse affect on pop and perhaps even risk of braking if you get too rad.

Will be using suggested tooling, more to follow, I just need to simmer it on the stove for a while to get tooling an work on the template/masking and of course family.

No griptape, this one had nice Trampa pads, I have some similar material myself that I was planning to use for tank grips on a motorbike but I have extra, we'll see

Hey @trampa what degree is used to make the holes oblong? There is probably calculus to arrive at that from the length but man the math arggh

Will be using a pillar press drill with the board on an angled plate, lucky I still have my protrator from skooldays!

Drill them straight and round! We use a waterjet for cutting.

And onto painters tape, there are small slits to allow markings of drill holes to be transferred as well as the holey holes

There's only really one way to make sure you have the markings in the right place

Thanks Frank, I'll take it handy, note I have a real Holeyif it all goes Pete Tong. Toying with the idea of putting it on a little compound table but it's too big and heavy probably

After multiple enclosure hassles for this pack I think I have alighted on the right one which fed into the build name

Scratch that, I pulled apart the pack as I had concerns about that he home made a springs breaking through the anode protection rings.

Pack will be in a typical ATB case and 12d6p, very tidy it is too. BMS will live in the case as well and will be a DieBieMS.![IMG_8930|666x500](upload://7CPIJsEP3A5xvAs3kuUySwALKX9.JPG)

It’s 2019, hat much further along? Practically zilch, I found a little time today to cut the deck. I’m leaving it like this and not channeling out the bits at the top of the truck.

Apart from that everything changes
3DServisas v2 5:1 drive, FatBoy 9” wheels, MBS F5 straps and an Idea undertray with a 12s4p of Sanyo 21700B, a DieBieMS and hopefully a Unity (grumble).  Motors just what I have which is a pair of APS 6380s 190kv. Completely underpowered, as its wrong kv for the wrong pack, will address that as needs be

Was that the 35 long which you cut down? I decided to move my truck holes down too, felt they were too high up.
I've got a jig on Thingiverse if you're interested.

Thanks mate, yeah I stole your jig and printed it already but iirc it's for the diddy mini trampa basepate?

Actually nah they have the same holes apart fro the inner spring position on the mini.

I'm all good thanks. The deck I have uses the outer forward holes which I'll use since this gives more strength, I'll use your template to drill the rear ones though, for some reason they are not there...it's an old deck

Yeah I'm using the old school hole pattern, should've really used the wider top holes but the boards finished now and I can't be arsed :smiley:
