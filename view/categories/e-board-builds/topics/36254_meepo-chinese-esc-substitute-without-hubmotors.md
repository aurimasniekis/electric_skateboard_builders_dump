Got one for a belt transmission. Works really well, no heat, really responsive, cheap remote but still good.

Hi, im new to this forum, but i have been using one for about two months on a diy built board. 
2x3s lipos powering it. 
Dual 90mm hub motors<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/7/f7d72e22ab1f099a7bd41869821c6462a7bbb85b.jpg" width="281" height="500">

So far no problems,  brakes good acceleration is smooth. For the price and ease of use. I have no complaints. 
180lbs rider mostly flat roads.
16mph on 6s lipos
About 9 mile range
I have another coming in a few days to build a single brushless motor setup.

My setup is 
90mm hub motors also from the same ebay seller
2x 3s batteries 5200 mah each wired in series with xt60 connectors
Enclosure was made from a brownie baking pan which i purchased from amazon. Works great. 12x7x1.5 deep.
And a brok volt meter also purchased from amazon.  
Ill try to upload more pictures,  but since im a new user. I could only upload 2 today?

I think riptide uses the dual substitute board with these motors: https://www.ebay.com/itm/DIY-dual-1500W-electric-longboard-drive-kit-83MM-wheel-7-trucks-CNC-mounts-/322549102279?hash=item4b196cb6c7:g:I0UAAOSwbtVZOttQ

no, I am in china too.  I will charge you 8us for the switch, included shipping.  but if you will buy other things from me, then I can put it along in the parcel.  that will only cause 2 us for the switch.  

here are my ebay shops.

I am using one of these escs too. I just finished setting it up the other day. I am running it with 6s lipos and the chain drive kit from eBay. It runs really well. I hit 39km/h earlier when my batteries were nearly flat. 

Here is my build thread:

hi,

I'm new to making electric longboards, and I was wondering for this ESC, a spark plug or loop key is required.
Also, if it is required, how do I use the plug/key when I am charging the batteries and also when I want to ride?

Thank you
```

you do not need a loop key. The esc comes with a power switch. I would recommend using some anti spark protection the "usual way", because you may get a spark.

Thanks for the reply.

What is the "usual way"?
I was under the impression that loop keys basically serve the same purpose as anti spark switches?
Sorry if this is completely nonsense.. I have no experience with this topic.

Also, can you explain to me how to use the loop key and or anti spark switch when it comes to charging the batteries and also when I want to turn on the longboard for a ride? Is there a special sequence of operations especially because there's a momentary switch on the ESC itself?

I also have another general question. If you have a BMS, does that mean you don't need a balance charger? Does the BMS allow for you to balance charge the batteries without the need of a balance charger? If so, what happens if the BMS doesn't have a overcharge protection? Do you have to manually check when the batteries are full and disconnect the power supply?

You do not need to use an anti spark switch, or a loop key. A loop key, is a shorted anti-spark xt90 plug, which completes a circuit to turn on. When I say use an anti spark the regular way, i do not mean and anti spark switch. I mean the anti spark plug a loop key is made off, but you do not use it as a loop key, instead you just wire it between the battery and esc. The anti spark i am refering to is this https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt90-s-anti-spark-connector-2pairs-bag.html. 

https://i.ytimg.com/vi/94FEjXYkgyY/maxresdefault.jpg

Use the anti spark key like the picture i found on the internet, and connect the wires on one side to the battery, and the other to your esc. This is the way anti spark plugs were originally supposed to be used. Anti-spark switches are completely different. There is plenty of info on this in the forum, so please look around a bit more.
