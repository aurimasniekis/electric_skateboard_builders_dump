So, here's the deal. I'm getting a little tired of dealing with my bulging Zippy lipo packs and I'm planning to build a 10s2p pack out of 26650 li-ion cells.
There Basen brand 30 continuous amp rated and 4500mah
I was getting 12 mile range with my Zippy 5000mah packs so I hope that I can keep this new pack small and simple and still get around 10mile range.
gonna use a bms from BesTech 80a cont and i'm gonna put a 40a inline fuse on the output.
I will be spot welding the cells together with pure nickel strips .15mm thick. 
Any advise or tips from the community would be appreciated.

According to this tester, the cell actually runs about 25A continuous, so it might be safer to go 2P.

Thanks for the link bro.
The guy said the 25a cont was (estimated).
I emailed The Basen company about this and they say that this battery is rated 30a continuous.

Namasaki,

I looked into getting a BMS and a charger from SuPower but the shipping was almost as much as the parts, did you find that too?

Really interested in this project. I'd like to have Li-ion batteries but don't want such a huge pack as we normally see to get a high enough discharge rate.

Keep us posted!

Update:
Gonna do a 10s2p pack instead of previous plan.
Same batteries so the pack will be 9000mah. maybe 20 mile range on flat ground.
And opted for the 2a charger mostly because its easier on the batteries and I can just charge overnight.
Same bms but for 10s/60a. Gonna put a 40a inline fuse on the bms.
This is my plan for the cell configuration:
I am going to weld cells together with strips and connect the to halves with a jumper wire.

So it will look more like this:

Just saw this thread. 

Congrats on the Basen buy.  I've been using a 10s1p setup with these for about a month now with zero complaints.  

And I too soldered cells together and compared to 18650s, they can take a lot more heat and abuse from the iron before heating up.

I'm getting about 9-10 miles out of my single motor setup.

The other one I was looking at welds up to .3 mm
I think in the specs they where recommending a 60amp breaker!
State side seller but there english was terrible so they may have misrepresented the data.
They did say that it might not be suitable for home use.
The one you got only welds up to .13mm thick and if it poped a 15a breaker then maybe they're right about this one needing 60a

From what I read in the specs on these batteries, It appears that they can be run down to 2.5 volts!
That would mean a lot more run time than Lipos.
Is that really safe for them. And would running them that low shorten their life.
If its not good, then what is a good safe low voltage for these cells?

## \#34 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2016-06-24T06:31:52.456Z Reads: 579

18650 cells are also rated to go down to 2.5v. I know 25R's are tested from 4.2 to 2.5v over 250 cycles. You generally cut off at 3.2-3.3ish for longevity.

Example: In this case 3.2v is 0% http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/fb95302d91aa992329d1d0ccb21f626ae71fc139.png

I see its 2.9. 
And the batteries are rated 2.5
So I guess in a pinch, you could run it till it stops and it wouldn't damage the batteries. Right?
I ran my Lipos till my board slowed down and stopped just one time and they where ruined!

Yes, it will keep you in the totally safe range.
it will cut your power way before you get near anywhere dangerous for the battery.
Bms are nice, they save you money in new batteries^^

If you would run your cells under 2,5 they would be ruined like your lipos;) For the lipos it is just a bit higher you should have connected a lipo bms or a voltage buzzer, or set a generous low voltage cutoff in your esc.
You should maybe read this: [voltage sag](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=27208)

The problem I'm finding is that the Basen imr 26650 cells are 26.7 mm dia.

Do you have any from battery space ? If yes, could you measure the id of the battery hole ?

What's the point of the plastic cases for the cells? If ur spot welding then why not just glue the cells together?  U could always cut them out again. Thinner. Easy. Maybe glue them with flexible rubber.

The point, or the reason I wanted to use them is that they hold the cell together nice and straight making the assembly and welding much easier. Like a weld jig. Also adding structural strength to the pack without having to glue them together. The wall thickness of the spacers is very minimal so they really don't impact size enough to worry about it.

I started planning my 25R pack with black plasitic holders in mind, but the further I got into it the more I realized that hot glue was a more practical solution. It's actually easier IMO. If you lay everything out flat, You should have enough time before the glue sets up to be able to move the battys around until they are pretty damn near perfect. If you are soldering direct to the cells, then there is also the chance that those plastic things can warp or melt.

But the plastic cell holders are supposed to be vibration proof etc and actually give some rigidity to the pack of cells in case the board flexes.

Man that totally sucks!! I got my 18650 batteries in a box with a bunch of 2per pack boxes inside. Took forever to unpack. That is unacceptable packaging you got there!! Hopefully, they are making things right with you. I've been planning another order, but I don't want to experience the rage that I get when my packages come in screwed up. LOL I know what it's like to wait for parts only to get them in unusable condition or incomplete order. Sucks...

D: Scary! I was just going to order from them. Did you complain yet? How does that even happen? I think it is illegal to ship batteries with certain carriers, maybe USPS found them to be batteries and discarded them?

They used the flimsy usps flat rate priority envelope. 
It had a lithium warning sticker on it and description of the batteries. 
The seam if the envelope was partially open and all the batteries where gone. I wonder if they fell out or where stolen. 
Anyway, shipping batteries in an envelope is just plain stupid. 
It was too late to call them when I got home but I will send an email and call them Monday morning. 
I will keep you posted as to their response.

Nope 9$ a pop for the M. B
7.50 for the older model......

they are lifepo4 chem- less prone to explode, fire death and mayhem, while being lower V and lower energy density, and longer life ( like 1.5 -2x li ion) 
So long terms, if you know how build a battery, make one with longer life, safer chem. and higher voltage than the space cell for the same cost.....

Ok, sounds more reasonable. On the website it said $20 but did not show quantity.
So, I think those cells are a little smaller than the ones I got. The holders are 26mm hole id.
The 26650's are suppose to be 26mm dia. but the Basen imr cells are 26.7mm including the shrink wrap.
26.4mm bare.

Just a quick noob question, why did you make your battery like this?(Your diagram top)

You don't have serial connections going top and  bottom like in the space cell.(Kinda like the diagram on the bottom)

Are there any pros/cons to doing it either way or does it not matter?

This is my first battery build so I'm not sure if I'm doing it the best way or not. I want to keep it thin and short. 1" thick, under 12" long and under 6" wide
Not including the bms. 
Also I want the main power wires coming from the same end of the pack. 
The diagram you uploaded has them coming from opposite ends. 
This is probably not an important factor but it was my preference.

Got cells from Lion wholesale today. 
Funny but they're a little different than the ones I got from eBay. 
Both have authenticity sticker and same print. 
Positive terminal is different and diameter is different. 
LW on left, eBay on right. LW fits spacers. One might be an older version?
I might be crazy but I ordered more from LW to make sure my pack has perfectly matched cells. 
Gonna set the 12 from eBay aside. Prob post them on the eboard market.

You send an email to:

request to buy and full model number and specify 10s 80a
I also included a link to the product page to be sure
After a couple days they will give your email to someone who speaks english and they will be your contact.
First they send you a quote for the item, after you accept the quote, they request your shipping info.
Once they have that, they will send you an invoice with total including shipping and you have to pay the paypal fee if you use paypal. The invoice will also have their paypal email address for payment.
their lead time is 5-7 days

P.S. When you order from BesTech. Be sure to read through the parameters on the spec sheet that they send you.
They will set the over current protection at 240a. You can request them to lower it at the factory.
I'm having mine set at 120a and will be using a fuse to protect the batteries.

vs
**BASEN 26650 in_10s3p_**would give you 90A - 500WH 13500Mah.   
**BASEN 26650 in_12s2p_**would give you 60A - 400WH 13500Mah.   

Both 10s3p and 12s2p seem like a good option for powering dual hubs.

There only about 1/4" larger than 18650 cells and you can get by with half as many so it's just a little thicker and takes up less deck space.

Your thread has me contemplating swapping a Yuneec 7S3P 18650 pack (batteries are 2900mAh) for a 8S2P using these batteries. That will give me the little boost I need to keep the E-go interesting without messing up the aesthetics or reducing range.

with a bms you don't  know the voltages of cells and I bet there's a lot of packs that would be capable of more watt hours if people knew what voltages they had and could pick out duds and replace them.

[quote="scrant, post:20, topic:4973, full:true"]
Just saw this thread. 

Congrats on the Basen buy.  I've been using a 10s1p setup with these for about a month now with zero complaints.  

And I too soldered cells together and compared to 18650s, they can take a lot more heat and abuse from the iron before heating up.

I'm getting about 9-10 miles out of my single motor setup.
[/quote]

Do you notice any significant voltage sag using a 10s1p setup with these cells?  If not, then this is very intriguing since you could build a 10s1p pack for like $100.  The only downside'd be the relatively low capacity of the pack (4500 mah), but at 166.5 WH, it's still better than boosted's original boards at 99 WH.

Do you think these cells are high quality enough to use without a BMS?
[/quote]

I think these are quality cells but I really can't say for sure because I haven't been able to use them yet.
My experience with HK Lipos is that they never drain evenly so I would use dual low voltage alarms, one for each pack to avoid over discharging any cells. And I would use a balance charger to avoid over charging any cells.
It is my understanding that the BMS keeps cells balanced during discharge as well as charging. Just plug in the charger to the external charge port and walk away.
Doing 10s or 12s with Lipos and a balance charger is a hassle.
Using a BMS with a simple plug in charger is a luxury.
One other thing, anytime you charge Lipos, your suppose to remove them from the board and put them in fire safe bag.
And when your done riding, take them out of the board and store them in a fire safe bag.
And keep an eye on them while charging.
I keep all my Lipos in fire safe bags and inside a fire proof safe.

[quote="Eboostin, post:162, topic:4973"]
Are there any threads on building a pack without a BMS? I imagine it's fairly straightforward but more along the lines of best practices as there are probably a few differences vs a BMS configured set up.
[/quote]

I havent used a BMS in a while now with my liion packs. I think it is sort of risky unless you know very well what you are doing. a few things help getting away with that:

* quality cells
* know exactly whats bad for liion chemistries and avoid it
* leave enough headroom when you are charging/discharging

the last thing is quite important incase serial packs ARE actually drifing. if you dont max the voltage/cell  (4.2V), then a little drift in a serial pack wont do much harm. another nice side-effect of not going up to the manufacturers max, is an increased lifetime of your battery.

taking a look at typical discharge curves, here of the LG 18650HG2, you can see that charging beyond 4V/cell isnt actually overly useful anyway:
https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/hg2_dicharge_test_1.jpg?6864291642866621798

on a sidenote, I made a battery just yesterday and without BMS cables, its really quickly done: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/carbon-jet-spud-freebord-bindings-single-vesc-10s3p-lg-hg2/5805/76?u=whitepony

Another option is to use a lower amp bms and wire it for charging only. This way you could use a much smaller bms and still balance your cells every cycle. 
You would still need to be careful when discharging that you don't go below 20%.

I dont want to spam the same thing over and over, but imo you should have at least a look at these current values for the nickel strips - these are evaluated for the typical nickel strip length of connecting 2 cells, so about 30mm. using longer strips makes things even worse, since heat losses just scale linearly with length.

https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=68005

for your strips: 10A load acceptable, 15A poor, ie lots of heat!

I would add a few more nickel strip layers or help out with copper!

Funny, I thought nickel strips would be better than wire. 
Seens like everyone who is building batteries is using strips successfully. 
At least I didn't go more than 4 cells on any strip. 
Putting the cells in parallel first and then in series. 
Also making the balance wiring simple and straight forward.

you can build batteries in various ways, it all comes down to how you design the serial connections. they are a problem in the typical flat layout that we see here for most boards.

I wouldnt run it like that, but not many think that way ... either because they dont know better or because they dont care (waste energy into heat that kills your cells or might just fail eventually). guess you can get away with it because in most skateboard applications you have these rare burst moments and rest of the time people just cruise along with constant speed and fairly low currents (depends on speed of course).

guess you really CAN get away with it - most people dont seem to run their boards very fast - if you cruise around with 30kph, you probably only need around 350watt, ie with a 10S battery you pull quite exactly 10A current which is still ok with a single strip. the initial acceleration burst will dissipate eventually.

people who plan on pushing for more should put more thought into their battery though! for me it varies a lot - sometimes I feel relaxed and just carve along with 25kph, sometimes I run constant full throttle 45kph with constant braking/accelerating. my lg hg2 10S4P battery is getting to 40-45degree celsius with that kind of treatment!

with twice the Fet's and heat sinks.

You crimp them with crimping plyers just like automotive connectors.

I can imagine that you can loose the cap for the charging plug while riding :joy: it is nice but we have to deal with too much vibration.

dont't mind the meter at 100% and the led still red, it your BMS working and balancing the cell. (This process may take some Time depending on the bms you've bought). Always wait for the Green light. (This mean the bms don't need current anymore, so it is safe to go)

I bought it on Ebay.  It's fairly small and fit the connector on my charger perfectly.
It also came with the switch but I couldn't use it because it's a momentary switch.

What I wanted was 
Dependability, which I was willing to sacrifice speed for. 
To be able to grab and go anytime and not have to put batteries in and out every time. 
Ground clearance for speed bumps and dips. 
And, an overall cleaner looking build. 
I would have gone with a smaller battery but I wanted to over build for amp draw. 
The range is just an added benefit.

So, one other new thing I did on this total build makeover is that I sealed the enclosure by putting self adhesive weather striping on the flange of the enclosure. Mostly to keep dirt and moisture out. While hoping that there would not be excess heat trapped inside.
On my test ride today at the beach front board walk I noticed a hugh reduction of noise from the board. I mean it was very quite like FOC quite.
I'm thinking that the full enclosure with foam seal is not only keeping the noise of the Esc's in but also eliminating any vibration noise that would otherwise echo through the enclosure.

Good results !! I wonder what could I get with Single Carvon Hub on a 12s2p setup. @Namasaki just to let you know - Mooch did final tests for BASEN and he finally rated it at exactly 23A which is still great. What is interesting is that Mooch have recently lowered LG HG2 - to 18a . It's rumored that LG's quality in recent months has dropped a little bit, both in capacity and discharge rate.

It's a [insert indecipherable Chinese characters here] model and it really works well. I got it through ebay from a guy in chacago.

Can you post a link for the mooch test for Basen ?
There is some trade off going from Lipo to Lion. 
More weight
Higher internal resistance(less efficient)
Voltage sag may be same or more, I'm not sure
IMO,
These Basens are good for a long range/moderate power setup. 
The A123 lifepo cells will be best for moderate range/high power setup.

To order from these guys you send them an email with your request and they will assign a customer service rep who will be your contact throughout the purchase process. 
Their shipping is fast and reasonable unlike Supower.
The amp and voltage limits are adjustable at the factory. They will email you a spec sheet. Then you respond with acceptance or tell what changes you want. There communication is very good.

**This video explains the procedure:**
https://youtu.be/py_LKc1Zt7w
After completing the mod, program the mod by holding the Kdn button, turn on power and release the Kdn button.
Now you are in program mode and can select the battery type and cell count by pressing the Kup button. Next press the momentary switch that was added to enter the meter functions program mode. Now press the Kup button to cycle through to F5 then press the momentary switch that was added and turn off power. When power is turned back on the meter will display voltage and the bar graph showing battery level.

About the loop key,
To cut power from the Vesc and receiver while charging?
Sounds like a good idea. 
I mentioned in another post that I believe this BMS keeps the pack balanced during discharge as well as charge. 
I want to test the theory before claiming it as fact and will be doing that shortly. 
That would be a huge benefit if it does, especially for Lipos.

That is my understanding too. I believe it does keep the cells balanced during discharge. The loop key was needed to isolate the battery and bms, from the vesc. I didn't like how everything was active while charging. 

About balanced discharge:
We put 17miles on this build (8s5p) and we still had 42% left. Also, No voltage sag the whole ride. Sensored FOC might be the ticket!!!

The voltage being accurate isn't the only calculation to get accurate state of charge readings. It is fine for DIY but different batteries have different voltage curves. These volt meters read battery capacity as a linear line. It will be a little off from the curve that batteries discharge at.

The voltage sag on the basen 10s2p was too much for my tastes. Since I do lots of hills.
going up this a 10% grade, it would sag 30-40%. Didn't have the meter mod then.
It was ok on flat ground with excellent range. Just no bueno for hills.
So now i'm back to Lipos.
Check out my 10s1p Lipo build capable of 300a continuous.
Voltage sag with this pack on the same hill is only around 10% or less ½-1v
This Lipo build was so much easier to do than Li-ions and because of the reduced voltage drop, less amps are pulled from the battery making it go farther with less mah. I haven't done a full on flat ground distance test yet but I will soon and I'm expecting to be impressed.

Check the thread about mixing li ion and lipo (best of both worlds)
Lipos are probably going to give you the most current as laptop cells are quite weak in terms of max current they can deliver. 

You would need quite a huge pack for laptop grade li ion cells to offer somewhat good punch. Ebike builders put around 20cells in parallel to make for a 20A or so discharge.

--
Id say you need at least 20A to get something decentu.
Try to find some info on how to determine discharge rate of batteries, then you will find out how much would be the optimum. Also consider that lipo ratings usually seem to be overrated, so it is wise to downgrade it - eg 25c as 15c or so

Besides that - nice to see someone experimenting. Id say you need at lesst 5cells parallel, so 30cells, to get somewhat mild results. Could work way better if you do make it possible to run them in parallel / in conjuction with lipos. This would make you one of the first ones who have done it, as I have not seen anyone here who have done it before. Only speculation on how it might work or how it should be done.

I know that the general conclusion from that discussion was that it is not very wise nor effective, since the high discharge cells should be in greater number than the low discarge ones and some other key elements.

Although, I would love to see some sort of real life proof or evidence on how bad is it really.

There was a similar topic about uneven kv motors (with varying opinions about it).. and my conclusion is that while you have not tried it personally or seen some evidence, speculation and opinions vary greatly upon is it effective or not and what could happen.

Well, 3-4 km looks like a vast improvement for me!

Can you tell the exact combo of your batteries?

How much in parallel do you have the li ions and how much lipos? And also their capacity of course..

Do you have ''smart charger''? How do you charge your lipo / li ion cells? The charger should show how much AH (or mAh) it puts out - charges into the cells.

Besides - perhaps this should be moved to another topic, are there any moderators here?

If those are HG2s like they look they shouldnt be 4500mah but 3000mah... I'm new to this forum but I use 18650s every day for vaping, I could be wrong however because there are more than one kind of brown battery out there of that I'm sure... But I would promise you if you ever find a battery that is 4500mah that it is a low amp rated battery less than 10A and should not be used for high amp applications! I wouldn't risk using the batteries you tested... ... But what do I know? Can you tell me where I could post questions as a first day member regarding compatibility of parts I've been researching?

I would suggest that you start reading at the beginning of this thread. 

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/diy-battery-pack-using-basen-26650-hi-drain-li-ion-cells/4973

Then go to this catagory and check out all the Esk8 builds to get some ideas for your first Esk8 build.

@Namasaki  
Yes I indeed was confused from not reading from the beginning of the post. Also what I said may have been irrelevant in the first place, batteries in parallel for the pack have the rating of the battery used and the number that are parallel (i.e. a 20a battery in 12s4p 20a×4= 80a for the entire pack) I was really tired I stayed up 48+ hours researching esk8 lol I apologize. Thank you for your advice, sometime after I commented here the site allowed me to make my first post and a few members were able to confirm that I was going in the right direction and alert me that one of the parts I'd chosen is out of manufacture and suggest an alternative. Thank you for your understanding of my conjecture and have a blessed new year!!!

If the out of production part your speaking of is the Bestech 10s HCX-D223V1, there is an update on that situation here:

Thank @Namasaki. Does anyone know what F1-F7 stands for in the new version? In the updated version its not in manual and im unsure if f1-f6 is still the same order as older version? Thx

Yep - it kinda 'falls' out if you use it like to cut-melt plastic or something. It also broke in two on me so I duct-taped it together

Continuing the discussion from [Diy battery pack using Basen 26650 hi drain Li-ion cells](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/diy-battery-pack-using-basen-26650-hi-drain-li-ion-cells/4973/338):

HI all, those battery's were crap cheep copies ,I have changed my battery setup for Samsung 30Q  
Li ions 8s 2p X2 just tried it and was skating for at least an hour, the built in voltmeter was showing full up to the end when I checked them they were at 25 volts a bit low even for li ions maybe too low .what's the lowest in can go with them ...hope I haven't f####ed them.next time I'll set the esc at 26v

Ya, unfortunately the Basens turned out to be a bust. Very saggy.
I just went back to Lipos and using them still.

As @Sebike is suggesting, you most likely don't have the meter set for the correct number of cells.

I think you're right but it came with no instructions, theres two buttons on the back one does nothing and the other just flips from battery full symbol to volts.I've tried different combinations but no change so I have left it on in volts mode .any ideas from you would be great.

Hold the button that does nothing while turning your board on and the meter should enter settings mode

I gave it a try and it comes up with a P a F and a L  
The P must be pack but what's the F and L

After looking at other voltmeters on eBay I have been able to get a better idea of how it works the P is lead acid the L is lithium so I'm tinkering with it setting it to L and then to 8s I think a problem may be occuring because I have two 8s 2p in parallel and maybe I should set it to 8s 4p what do you think?

You only set it according the number of cells in series. Parallel doesn't matter to the meter.
It only reads voltage and divides it by the number of cells in series.

Hi namasaki when I set the battery indicator to 8s it shows only 30%charged but the voltmeter shows 28volts thats more like 98%charged

8s liion fully charged should be 33.6 volts. Unless you’re using lifepo4

Hello Community, My name is Chase I need to replace a Boosted V1 battery it only gets about 2mi at this point. I am torn between just replacing with the same old A123 2665s 3s4p orrrrr adventuring to use these Basens, and hope for a brighter tomorrow. Anyway, please shed some wisdom on what I should replace my Boosted V1 pack with. Thanks

I believe you best bet is to replace your old cells with new cells of the same type. A123 are good cells and the rest of your system is designed to work with them.

As already said you have to stick with the same chemistry of battery, the bms on boosted boards is made for a123 cells or lifepo4 I think. Normal 18650 Li-ion cells will not work
