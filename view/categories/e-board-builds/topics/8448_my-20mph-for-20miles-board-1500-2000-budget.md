Any reason you aren't going hub motor?

I am not going to going with a hub motor in this build because I live in a relatively hilly area and dual motors on a boost on pro mode would get me up a hill at a medium pace and from my understanding if I want to go up hills hubs are not the way to go. Thanks for asking this question.

I remember seeing a vid where dual carvon hubs on 12s could climb hills no problem.

but 6355s would be pretty much unstoppable. like a boosted dual +++++++ :heart_eyes:

I would add a anitspark switch for completeness. $50. so you have a nice power button like boosted.

and then youll need an enclousre, I think [psychotiller](http://psychotiller.com/products/shop) is the closest option.

Hey is perfect time to order that other random crap if you don't have it already....and bone up on the solder skillz if its been a minute ... YouTube never hurts (unless you're shopping for a Chinese clone eboard)

Sorry I do not follow completely with what you are saying all the parts I am buying are plug and play.

HUMMM... Bullet connectors will match?

Not even heat shrink?
 
Thread locker? 

Do you know how you will be attaching everything to the board? Bolts, screws? 

Will this be a solderless build?

My battery to anti-spark switch to VESC all required re-soldering as the ends were reversed. Hope it doesn't happen to you...

Looks like an awesome build otherwise.

Hi @chris.hunt. I've just ordered my parts from diy too. We're building a pretty similar board except I went 190kv and gt2b. Should be plug and play too but I'm wondering if I need to solder the receiver to the Vesc to ensure no drops outs. The rest should be secure plugging it in, right? 5.5 bullets on motors and xt90 on battery.

I got my drive train today but the battery didn't ship as they are backordered. Ordered Sunday received saturday.

I'm going to try to find a bright usb light and keep it simple with the USB ports on the battery.

Agree 100% on diy's service. Great experience so far. Anyway I'll keep an eye on this since I'll probably hit the same bumps.

I don't have mine soldered and haven't had any dropouts for the past 2 weeks. I'm using the Winning Remote though

Probably connects to the VESC using the same fitting I would assume?

If you mean the servo wire then yes it should be the same for all Vesc to RX.

Don't be surprised if you need to do a little soldering...even supposed plug and play kits often require some modification to fit your board the way you want. That said, don't be intimidated by it. I'm not particularly handy and I picked it quickly, I'm certain you can too. Definitely pick up some red loc-tight, some heat shrink, Velcro w/ double sided adhesive (great for securing VESC and receiver), and hot glue gun. If you need any help, just shout. 

@Spek I've never used the gt2b but usually I just hot glue the receiver wire on the VESC.

What gearing did you choose? If you geared it low, be careful...your board will be a torque monster, takes a bit longer to get used to. I just bought the same motor for my current build. Will you be using the sensors? Here's a pic, actually really like what I see so far. Key slot and dual flat spots on shaft gives you lots of motor pulley options. It's also long enough for a 15mm pulley which is nice for a mono drive board.
