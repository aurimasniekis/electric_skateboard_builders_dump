The link to your parts list doesn't work.
Series will double the voltage of the batteries.
Parallel will double the capacity.
Range is equal to Voltage times capacity divided by load.
Just hook them up in series to have both speed and range

Thank you very much for replying!

I think the link will work if you make sure to not copy the parentheses and paste it into a new link. If not, please reply again. Also, Michaelinvegas put the spreadsheet up as well. About the series vs parallel, thank you very much for clearing that up. I will go for a series adapter then.

Thanks again,
Ethan
