I am deciding the components of the engine drive, and I have doubts about the type of chain to use, I have two option to use, chains type 05B (8 x 3.0 mm) or 06B (9,525 x 5,72 mm)

These are the specifications of each one:

**05B**

**06B**

Which is the most used for mountainboard? I have searched this info in forums and can not find it.

Thank you

If you ask me, I would just go with belts. Or if you have the budget... direct gears from @Nowind

I notice that I do not have much space, because I want to take advantage of some screws that the truck has to fix the motor mount. Also after asking in several places, I think the chain is much more economical.

On the other hand, most of the time I will offroad.

I show you a first version of my scheme so you can see the space I'm talking about

I don't know the numbers but you should be able to fit a 15 mm belt no? 
Either way, yes chain is usually always cheaper but if you don't get thick enough chain it will break. They are loud, have pretty heavy rolling resistance and are pretty dangerous. 

They are more economical but I think there is a reason for it

I understood that the belts have more rolling resistance.

Just to give my pov :) In my side, and after experience, chain got less resistance when carving or in downhill (when you do no use the motor, you got a really good freerolling/freewheel).
But yes more noizy ! Dangerous ? Don't know that...
Is passe from iso 4B to 6B, all good. This time I can't break it by hand :blush:

(got a ligthweight 36T and heavy 42T from 9 to 11T motor to play with ratio)

Good choice man

Can you explain this to me better? I can not understand what you want to tell me, my English is limited.
What means lightweight 36t and heavy 42t?

I was thinking about getting a 50t and 8-10-12t for play with ratio

Thanks for sharing your experience!

:smile: mine too, I'm frensh guy speaking franglish ... many hard times.
Just to informe you, cause iso 6B start to be Big ! And the motor sprocket to (just show some possibilities)
50T ! In iso 5 yes
Got a new never used 50T kit from e-toxx with the heavy version of the iso 5B chaine, with 10T (and more) for motor and around 2m of chain if you're interessed by (now I'm using 06B version)
like this :slight_smile:

I have a distributor in Spain with very good price, like 15€ plate an 1-2 € motor sprocket. But they only work since 05B.

What I am looking for is to get an idea of the real size of a 04B-05B chain, I can not find a comparative photo.

yes, for sure, but once it breaks under your finguer, you think for more :blush:
05B are good compromise imo, but prefer iso 06B and follow the good old abacus  !

EDIT : Ho you're on little urethan wheel ! Its cool to see that !! Yes for this iso4 is lot more appropriate ;)

This chain is NEVER breaking. If you could break it with your bare hands or even your whole weight, I'll give you my board!

But keep your board bro, looks really cool.
It's why I go 5B kit from e-toxx, but don't try and upgrade again for bigger 06B (but for e-mtb no esk8) this is why.

In any case, for me the best rest DD by etoxx  :smile:

This is what my board looks like now... and no, it makes no difference at all except, with a mountain board, you don't want shitty little stones and mud getting in to your belt! With a chain, it just crushes them or things like mud doesn't bother them...

I passed on chain drive when I worked out how small the diameters are and I couldn't get the reduction I wanted with the pitch I wanted and that the chain is so close to the ground maintenance will suck! a dirt bike fares better... chains are great if they are spotless... need to be kept shiny, I prefer a hp wax over oil ;)

Tried those first in my eMTB they stretch fast as hell and the chain started to look like crap after less than 100 km, I went with #25H (or some producers call it #25HD) chain, it's twice as durable as 04B (6x2,8mm).

Pitch is almost like 04B  (6.3somethig) but chain plates are almost twice as thick, it’s used in mimoto and mopeds mostly. Because of small pitch you can have more teeth engaged thus less wear on them compared to larger pitches.

will upgrade again to ISO-06 ... LOL
Hard riding on MTB will kill the 04 fast... the 05 later... hope 06 is last upgrade :relaxed:

How much distance do you leave between the plate and sprocket? 17mm in my setup,It will be enough?

would you know roughly the price for shipping to AU? i sent him an email earlier about making a customised order since im after 8 sets for my 2 builds but im curious to what the shipping will be. and if its just chain i might be able to buy it from my country and save on shipping weight as that could play a huge factor.

thanks, im actually not sure how much each wheel will use. would you know roughly the length that would be needed for 2 wheels.  9/42T and 11/35T or would it be safe to get 1m length per board as a spare? 500mm per wheel setup, then i can shorten them to length correctly?

Consider purchasing from UNIK, E-TOXX and Overion.

The specific chain is called ISO 06B British Standard roller, or, ISO 06B Metric roller

At mentioned in your other thread mate any decent local bearing and power transmission shops should be able to get you the chain no worries

You haven't bothered to update your profile with your location so harder to show which one is closer, but for example here is an Aussie mob
https://www.statewidebearings.com.au/products/power-transmission/roller-chain-conveyor-chain/

and what do you know, they have the chain, it's 06B-1 would be my guess

thank you. i normally dont like to put my location around the net, had some issues with identity theft in the past. though any store in australia should eb able to ship at a relatively low price, but yes i am picking up 16 kits from Overion + a few extras so i do support them, just shipping is a huge killer.

Since this is fairly commented about chains and sprockets I thought I would come back and ask if I made a mistake with my purchase. I picked up the 10/35 06b from over ion to fit on my 6.5' urban tyres from Trampa but I ordered an undermount enclosure I worry it will sit too low to the ground so I got a set of 200mm Mbs which are on at the moment. I asked around Facebook and they say 10/35 is wrong ratio could I get some suggestions on how I could fix this or if I'm worried s out nothing?

10/35 seems fine for 200 mm wheels. I am doing 10/42 for 200mm and while it gives great torque the sprocket and chain occasionally scrapes the ground if the tires are a bit deflated and I hit something like a slight curb. 

You have dual drive right? if so 35t will be ok. Give it a test ride and see if you need more torque, if you do then you will need bigger sprockets. Have you messed around with the calculator? https://calc.3dservisas.eu/
