So here's the situation. When I flew back up to the Bay Area, the Southwest airline stopped me and disallowed me from carrying my Banshee on the plane. I tried to explain to them I removed the battery... but they didn't care. Whatever, fuck them.

The good news is that I had just enough spare parts to build a 'temporary board' that will last me for the month. After that, I'll likely sell it and recuperate what I spent on all those spare parts.

So what do I currently have?

Thanks to my secret santa... I'm now an owner of a set of 90mm TB hub motors. Talk about the perfect gift for the occasion.

Also paid my favorite viewing spot at San Francisco another visit:

While I was there, I also picked up a battery pack from my boy Jinra:

Pleasure doing business with ya.

Had my friend in San Diego send my other spare parts by mail... so if all goes well, I should have an assembled board by the end of this weekend. Stay tuned for how things turn out!

It's a 10S4P 25r battery pack. Should be good enough for a 20ish mile range build.

What happened to your board, did they confiscate it?

Damn. I won't be able to make it to IKEA this weekend to buy a battery enclosure. That's okay, I'm going ahead and buildin  a state-of-the-art cardboard enclosure for myself. Just y'all watch.

Just trying to compensate for crappy roads in general. I'm super curious to see how well the avenue truck will do in terms of vibration handling. I'll still be running the gifted paris truck in the rear.

not much, from what I can tell. tried psycho's just pushing and I felt zero difference. also, its a spring with no dampening so I can imagine in a hard turn once compressed, it'll rebound as hard as it compresses.

Added a folding lid to make this enclosure a little easier to mount and water seal. Enclosure is mounted with industrial double sided tape.

If I had to sell the enclosure, I'd charge about 35$ give or take, given it takes me a good 2 hours to properly build.

Dude well done with the creativity and resourcefulness. The duct tape will surely hold up to serious punishment and keep everything nice and sealed....i need to try this sometime for a testing enclosure

The electronics are all wired up now, but now I'm having problems with trying to flash the firmware. The current firmware on the VESCs is 2.18, and I'm trying to flash them to the ackmaniac 2.54 firmware but with no luck. The VESCs will refuse to connect until I pull their power and try to reconnect then. Once I do that, I'm greated with the firmware still being read as '2.18'. Anybody has an idea what's the issue?

Update. So I managed to update one of my VESCs using the regular VESC tool. However the second VESC won't update. Every time I try to, I get this.

Are you using the same USB cable as the first one? Seems like it's just not making a connection.

Yep. Using the same USB cable. The connection is solid, but that's the thing.... the tool treats the connection like something got pulled out mid flash.

Huzzah, turns out I was right about the boot loader being faulty... perhaps from my own negligence. Re flashed the boot loader with an STLink and loaded the newest Ackmaniac firmware on... no problem.

I'll get pictures when I can. I'm not using this as my permanent solution (though it very well could be if I wanted to)... so I'm just using some double sided industrial tape and ductape around the center portion to hold the enclosure tight on.

Well! The board is finished (mostly).

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/b/abe31dd04782546d317abb14c6d52951d350f62e.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/2/32055a137843f69286af813653a6feae7e43f537.JPG" width="666" height="500">

The cardboard enclosure is holding up like a champ. For those wondering... the duct tape in the middle is simply for making sure the enclosure doesn't fall off (in the event that the double sided tape stops adhering between the deck and enclosure). If I really wanted to... I could bolt the enclosure to the board and be done with it. Hell, this enclosure would be perfect for bolting to these kinds of curvy decks, since the cardboard will bend to the contours. However  I want to sell this in the near future... so the future buyer will likely want something a little nicer than an enclosure made of cardboard.

And merry Christmas to everybody! If my secret santa didn't send me these hub motors, I wouldn't have been able to made this build the way it is now.

Highlight of the night is when I caught a gnarly manhole and fell at 20mph, but we don't talk about that. 

Also selling the board now for about 1200$... which is roughly the BOM price of all the components used. Someone here buy it quickly so then I can do another build!
