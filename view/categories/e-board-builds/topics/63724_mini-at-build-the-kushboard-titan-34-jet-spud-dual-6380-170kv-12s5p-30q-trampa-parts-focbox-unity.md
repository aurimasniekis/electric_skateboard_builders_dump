Hey guys,

This year has been filled with a lot of new experience and knowledge, as i started build my very first build, a 6355 dual drive in February, and a 6374 single drive in June. 

Now, i'm currently scouting for potential parts for an AT build... maybe next year, or later this year. I've spent too much! :disappointed_relieved:

Now here's the funny part. I'm not using a MTB deck that has the angles required for pneumatic trucks, i'm actually using [this deck](https://www.sickboards.nl/en/longboards/11493-jet-potato-rocker-345-deck-only.html). Yep, it's going to be a Mini AT board. Figured it'll look cute, and also taking inspiration from @mmaner and his Spud AT. 

So the next issue is the angle. Just plopping a spring truck on there would mean there's 0 degree for turning, so that's when this [angled riser by Okp](https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/hybrid-riser-35-trampa/) comes into play. Currently there's 6 on interest including me, and we need 4 more. So if you're interested... https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/poll-unik-35-risers-who-wants-them/47874

Okay, so let's say everything is dandy and i get the deck and angled riser sorted out, which trucks should i go for? I'm thing either Trampa or MBS. 

Trampa has the [Infinity Trucks](https://www.trampaboards.com/infinity-trucks--solid-hanger-body-with-12mm-solid-axles--mega-strong-p-11151.html), the [Ultimate](https://www.trampaboards.com/the-ultimate-titanium-truck--black-anodised-hanger-with-anodised-baseplate-titanium-axles--kingpin-p-12298.html), and the [Vertigo Trucks](https://www.trampaboards.com/vertigo-truck--12mm-hollowed--hardened-steel-axles-with-anodised-baseplate-p-11150.html).
 MBS has the [Matrix Pro](https://www.mbs.com/parts/12042-mbs-pro-matrix-truck-black-1) and the [Matrix II Pro](https://www.mbs.com/parts/12202-mbs-matrix-ii-pro-truck-system-1) that has a rubber bushing as compared to the spring trucks. I've tried the Matrix II on a Lacroix but i did not like the turning as much. Perhaps i'm not used to the Lacroix board. I might choose the Vertigo Trucks as they are lighter than the Infinity by 200g, but that may change in the future. 

Now, the wheels. An 8" wheel on this deck would probably be an overkill and be too much of a monster truck to be called an esk8 :joy: so i'm thinking of around 7", or Trampa's new [6.5" wheels](https://www.trampaboards.com/custom-superstar-with-65-inch-urban-treads-p-24912.html)

If i were to go the MBS route, i'd have the flexibility to choose various colors as they have a wider range, these [hubs](https://www.mbs.com/parts/13044-mbs-twistar-hub-set-set-of-4) are calling out for me. Or perhaps there are other vendors out there that sell wheels with good options, let me know!

As for the motor mounts, i'm currently keeping my eye out for these ones. https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mountain-board-motor-mounts-for-sale/44546/213

With that, I think i'll go for Torqueboards 6374 or 6380 motors, still undecided. The Potato deck is basically a longer version of the Jet Spud, so @Eboosted's [Double Stack Spud enclosure](https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/jet-spud-29-ds/) should fit nicely. Enclosure can fit a 12s6p. Holy shit... I might not go that high but that'll be decided in future. Cells will probably be 30Q. 

For the VESC, i can wait since this project will start later this year or next year, so if the [Focbox Unity](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/focbox-unity-dual-motor/52706) comes out then, i'll probably use that. If not, the [VESC 6](http://www.trampaboards.com/vesc-6-complete--vedder-electronic-speed-controller-trampa-exclusive-p-24166.html) or [ESCape](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/escape-group-buy-professional-pcb-assembly/49720) are good options too. 

So yea, these are my possible parts selection. Do help me decide which would you prefer and why, or if there's a better option, let me know! Thanks for reading, hopefully my bank gets a bit fuller quickly so i can start building this damn thing!

Nice choices so far I think!

Building something along those lines as well. Not quite ETMB material as I won't be going with the spring/shock suspension but rather standard longboard trucks and bushings. You could opt for gear drive and @kug3lis, @nowind and @kaly are your best bets there hands down at the moment. I'm going for a @hummie deck myself so seeing someone planning an AT build around a smaller deck is interesting to see.

I do plan on going 6.5" as well as anything over 7" is indeed overkill and would be alot heavier especially if you go through with 12s6p and Torqueboards 6380 lol(I'm going 12s4p on 6374 to make it abit more manageable)
solid choices with the ESCs. I don't really read anything bad about the Vesc 6 so far but I do plan on going for the Flipsky FSESC 6.6 based of the Vesc6 though I don't know how it performs for EMTB uses which I think should be taken into consideration.

Honestly if I had it to go over if use surf rodz tkp adjustable base plates and 110mm access and call it a day. 

Look at @Sender's lacroix build and you can see how the adjustable base plates will give you 30+ degrees of adjustability on the rise and 110mm access maker it plenty wide.

Springs only for better turning radius or yellow dampas. If you don't use bindings it's harder to turn with dampas but without you'll get speed wobbles at higher speeds. So it's all about your desired average top speed.

I'm not sure if i will need bindings yet. I don't think i'll do heavy off roading other than grass or on unpaved roads. If only the soft ones were green dampers.. i wanted to go for a black and green look for the whole board

Quick question, what teeth pulley would be good for, let's say a 7" tyre? I'll probably use 16T for my motor pulley and since the motors are 170kv torque should be ok.

They have the adjustable TKPs still on the site.  I dunno about the adjustable base plate RKPs.

I have both, and man I like em.  Though they are really only worth the price (they cost as much as a full set of trucks by themselves) in very specific applications as once you get them where yoy want them, they will stay there

Okay, woah.

I think i might have found the ideal motor mount for the Vertigo trucks.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/motormounts-kits-for-trampa-e-mtb/15502/345
@Idea makes some pretty quality looking mounts, and two things i'm looking for in motor mounts is aesthetics, and idlers. Well in this case, Idler. Feast your eyes.

![8317de18ace16289710c26812f7e09ddfc823656_1_666x500|666x500](upload://yxqUZsa2UBeYjNmMersf6ygKbt7.jpg)![image|666x500](upload://6myI3syYF6LNjMHPoyuNXUWzyND.jpg) 

I think i will get these mounts, and here's what i calculated using my supposed specs. 
12s battery
170kv motors
6.5" tyres
16/66T pulley

![111|690x452](upload://61fD3WMDGs4o5es3j4tpoUCh3U1.jpg)

Since the motors are 170kv i don't think torque will be an issue, but if i do want to get more torque in the future i could get a 14T pulley. But is a 66T pulley good? Should i get a 72? If any AT builders have any advice to give, please let me know!

Side by side with my Jet Spud single drive, a 29" beside a 34.5"
![38855450_252998115339692_4480440695559028736_n|690x385](upload://uUGgH9dqKoIYMcp5PK0snR7cMZO.jpg)

Unfortunately the yellow can be seen, even with an enclosure over it, plus the wheel wells look bad, so i plan to sand it and have it bare, and paint a coat of matte black paint over it. More to follow tomorrow. 

Nonetheless the deck feels really nice! A longer Jet Spud, for high speeds!
I noticed the deck has a very gentle W profile, but not too much difference compared to the 29" spud.

Ugly and rough wheel wells, time to do some cosmetics!
![20180810_235219|690x388](upload://zElDOIsuQH9uvSGADt8idLLzlVT.jpg)

As a woodworker by trade, i had a card scraper, the steel is the same steel used to make table saw blades, so it'll hold an edge well and i used it to scrape majority of the paint off. It makes the surface smooth so i can sand from 200 grit than a really low grit like 80. It also minimizes the amount of dust if i were to tackle it with a low grit and sand.
![20180811_083651|690x388](upload://wkC5UOLChH2bhqvnF5y8w4CUaYb.jpg)

For the middle, since there's a gentle W concave, i used a steel ruler and held both ends and used the middle to scrape. It works..!
![20180811_091527|690x388](upload://1i97IOGCWI7DrWa13tg3cnDigcE.jpg)

After awhile.. with some sanding with the orbital sander up to 400 grit
![20180811_102151|690x388](upload://eI2TxZ959iQ8c4ifQ5VRFFkJTfj.jpg)

Time to paint! I used a flat black paint which is both a primer and paint, so no need for a base primer.![20180811_104405|690x388](upload://sSxEseKWUd62zXVAY7YbFswjsgG.jpg)

First coats were light, and progressively moderate coats, more coats on the bottom of the deck.![20180811_104608|690x388](upload://716eVNzTRukwrDwj7qHbzn2BLsG.jpg)

Oh yea.![20180811_110721|690x388](upload://bGWrkLBeJH8mWvhDssZX0ZKWRyW.jpg)

Wheel wells are blended out better, smooth, and any sharp edges were rounded out. ![20180811_193532|690x388](upload://e2Sm6RIs1f3W5TdNpgrqmpwOhIU.jpg)![20180811_234207|690x388](upload://eqomft4vihJfYPflTPcXM6j5FeR.jpg)![20180811_234151|690x388](upload://kiIkGXm5lBQ1TEOClWilGqeU2vs.jpg)

I'll spray a few coats of 2K satin clear coat tomorrow. It's gonna be offroad so might as well go for a hard and durable finish right?!

Was doing some maintainence on my single drive Spud so i thought i'd try the enclosure on the Potato deck.


Aw..![zcx|690x388](upload://rqIFKHopDge36ns5keTEYSr3Vx7.jpg)

Perhaps the fiberglass enclosure can be heat formed with enough temperature to bend down slightly? Other than that the rest looks fine, just that both ends arch up a bit. 

@Eboosted are your enclosures too strong to heat form? :rofl:

Here's the deck with the enclosure. I tried heat forming the enclosure to fit the gaps on the deck but it wouldn't budge. I fear heating it too much might crack or deform the fiberglass so i'll leave it as it is for now. I might do some fiberglass work of my own to add fiberglass material where the gap is to accommodate.

I like the idea of the standoffs to space out the pulley from the hub.

Battery is done! A local battery builder who makes them for scooters and bikes got a 12s5p 30Q with a 120A BMS. That's huge haha
![20181112_155248|281x500](upload://r3WFLFDKeX9yMgq4G8UXXHejcCH.jpeg) 

Organized the cables. And the battery connector is strategically placed on the right as the Focbox Unity's connector will meet nicely when bent up.
![20181112_210138|281x500](upload://vzIpmWIGYTR17tGFGY5HcvaJTNU.jpeg) 

Duct taped the enclosure to the board, slapped two griptapes hanging around and went downstairs for a test ride. 
Settings are 70/40/40/10. Should i increase my battery current? I think i can inch it up a bit more.

Wow pneumatics are a really different feeling. Unlike decks which dip down like the Lacroix and Trampa decks, this one feels very much like.... an Evolve? Due to the deck being higher up, which i prefer actually. Turning is not as well as my urethane boards with Calibers, but because i'm using the angled riser, i can technically add wedges to the front and back right? @Kug3lis have you tried wedging on your Landyachtz previously? I think if i wedge the front, and dewedge the rear, it might make turning better.

![46426372_2169796893274483_1744412701121052672_n|690x388](upload://n3mf2GmowxeD1NwBFdZhJKR0AHc.jpeg) 

Went for a test ride with a few friends. Went for about a 25km ride. Used about 40% of the battery, sweet.
![20181113_203950|281x500](upload://yY1dk398M2lfAyp8EaXnsQDh0jG.jpeg) ![20181113_213420|281x500](upload://bldetHgF4uRmylwUFfox6IxujVB.jpeg) ![20181113_211045|690x388](upload://5u8NEItXPZFSGEgt3r0qRBLmiC0.jpeg)

Here comes the Kush.
 ![20181113_201454|281x500](upload://zGFeyQGFEtXXMhXXeQQGIcEu9l5.jpeg) ![20181113_204328|281x500](upload://sJKayZU2BbpmOj2hRJ499LxAack.jpeg) 

Ok, due to the deck's curvature being different than a Jet Spud, there is some gap in the front and back of the enclosure. I tried heat forming but it didn't help much. ![20181113_014307|690x388](upload://5DDjYtmGDIHroPhekvczVEvPKdU.jpeg) ![20181113_014301|690x388](upload://napG8IN4vJYCJ1lFfSy3pWPgMcN.jpeg) 

Fiberglass time! I'll add extra material where the gaps are and will make them as thick as the enclosure itself, then trim accordingly. ![20181114_230840|690x388](upload://jC7t9DdzROERpb1DboV6dELyQXm.jpeg) 

Size comparison with a Lacroix.
![20181117_163716|281x500](upload://fjSfK8cGnJgko5gMLaHcRCSBBOM.jpeg) 

So yea, i'll finish up the enclosure, get it nice and flushed with the deck, paint it and bolt it on, settle the electronics and call it done! Should be within next week.

Well this is the first one I've ever done. I had zero knowledge coming into this. So I made up my mind on what I was going to build and then changed it about 50 more times.

I'm actually trying to press my own deck right now, so thats what is wasting time. But I have a raptor 2 to get in some rides before winter fully hits us here!

After 6 hours everyday over a span of 4 days, i got it nicely flushed with the deck and started to drill the holes and add inserts.![20181122_081343|690x388](upload://13sxYYDflBsIiwSMrFdtaoLpWbn.jpeg)

Extended the power switch, It's currently a temporary flipsky antispark. When the unity arrives in December hopefully, i'll use that switch instead and extend it out too.
![20181123_113419|281x500](upload://8Y9Qk9FxmcYzbnjOw1CYahNWsWj.jpeg)

![20181123_165431|690x388](upload://8iQPHBW7muYyEVisiPaWCsVFsvO.jpeg)

So to round up, these are the final parts i ended up using
Jet Potato 34" deck
Trampa Infinity trucks
Trampa wheels w/ Urban Threads
@Kug3lis's custom 50A dampas and 35 deg angled risers
@Idea's ver 7.2 belt drive system
@torqueboards's 6380 170kv motors
@Eboosted's DS Spud enclosure but modded
Flipsky dual 6.6 and AS switch, eventually will be swapped to a Unity
12s5p 30Q battery with 120A BMS
a lil of that devil's cabbage that helped with the making of this build.
Currently mini remote but will be swapped to @Wajdi's Photon remote once i get the new receiver.
Already painted it with automotive paint for that bling. ![20181121_235035|690x388](upload://rJkpLhIXTVvQOK3mgiC7VubiHIB.jpeg)     

So yea, final verdict. It honestly feels kinda like an Evolve, but MUCH more stable and carves like a dream due to the soft dampas. I might consider wedging the front and dewedging the rear for a split angle. 

Also, this is my third build but first pneumatic experience, this is amazing. This road that my board is on, is NOTHING, ok maybe i felt it a little bit but WOW.![46512243_187304248884445_4638841902639087616_n|690x388](upload://ic9kMSSI2G3YfBWX428BqvxWzN3.jpeg)

Thanks Alan! Really wanted to use your enclosure and would be a waste due to the gaps, so i figured i'll add material on there instead to flush it to the deck. Partly my bad for thinking that this deck is a longer version of the spud.

So much space! Should've gone for a smaller BMS and more cells..![20181223_033033|281x500](upload://jf6WMQ3UJYT5QomttBIztMuc7CQ.jpeg) 

Unity settings are at 80,-80,80,-20, using the [Avio Mini remote mod](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-avio-mini-remote-mod/72074/105).
![20190208_160034|690x388](upload://ek4w8ZByw4q0ICkHnXgxMi094gx.jpeg)

New receiver for the Photon remote came recently, so i swapped to that. Accel and brake was a bit jumpy so i bumped down settings to 60,-50,80,-12. Perhaps its due to it being a thumbstick remote that i'm not used to yet. But i like it so far! ![20190215_201227|690x388](upload://bxfBMP1i4ncG5rO7X94QmcRBxRy.jpeg)

Bldc motors are inherently waterproof.  Water won't cause them to short, unless the enamel layer of the wires has been damaged.

The bearings in them aren't waterproof though, they'll corrode, like most bearings, when exposed to the elements.
