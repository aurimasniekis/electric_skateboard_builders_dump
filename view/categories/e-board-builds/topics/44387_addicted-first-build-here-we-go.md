Although I am new to the world of electronic skateboards, I have done a lot of reading and watched hours of YT clips. Joining this forum was a massive step in the right direction with so many very knowledgeable people who seem more than happy to give advice. When I first began thinking of building my own board, my initial ideas are far different to where I am now (thanks mainly to this forum) and I am just about to hit the 'BUY NOW' button on a few items to get me started. I figured I would throw up my ideas here and try to open a discussion on whether this is the 'right' choice or whether there are alternatives that I haven't yet considered. 

Firstly, the environment that I will be riding is not your 'standard' urban environment. I live in a very remote part of Australia (Arnhemland) and there are no real 'roads' up here. Most of the surfaces are either just dirt tracks (gravel, dirt, sand (not too deep), etc). This led me to the idea of building a Mountainboard with tyres (tires) that would be suitable to the area I want to ride. I also wanted a board that will be easy to turn as most of the tracks can be pretty tight. I am not aiming to build a board with crazy fast speed, and I would rather compromise speed for torque and longer battery life.
So, with all of this in mind, here is what I have so far as my 'parts list'.
**Trampa Urban Carver board with the Vertigo trucks and 7" wheels (this is put together as a package from Trampa)
**E-Toxx Mini Direct Drive drivetrain. I have chosen this as it is a 'sealed' unit and I think will be better suited to my environment in comparison to a belt drive option.
**2 Dark Matter motors 6374 190Kv
**Dual Focbox
**Enertion Nano-X controller
These parts have all been ordered and I am awaiting their arrival.

Apart from the above, I am still undecided on a few other items like the battery, battery tray and BMS. In my ideal world, I would want the batteries situated under the deck and I have seen some awesome custom builds with low profile, flexible battery trays (like the one on the build that whitepony did), but I can't seem to find anything like this available to purchase. I'm also undecided on battery choice at the moment. I do know that I want 10s4p, but not sure whether I go with LiPo or Li-ion. I'm also on the fence in regards to a BMS and have read that some people don't use them where others do.

Anyway, that's about it for now. Keen to get some feedback on the above and can't wait to get this built and start riding.

Regarding the batteries would look at what range you want to get then use some of the calculators to get a rough idea of what size in terms of Wh you need.  10S with 190kv should be good (10\*4.2V\*190kv = 7980 rpm, 60000 erpm /7 pole pairs = 8,571motor rpm so you're under that limit which is good for the DRV safety on the VESC4 based hardware).

In very rough terms 10Wh = 1km so if you want to go 30km between charges you need 30\*10=300Wh.  Most 18650 cells are in the 2500-3000mAh or 2.5-3Ah range and at 10S nominal voltage being 3.7V you have about 3Ah\*3.7V= 11.1Wh per cell, so can take your total Wh you want for range divide by 11.1 and get the number of cells you need in total to be carrying that much energy.  If you go with lipo can just take the Ah on the battery and multiply by 3.7V\*number of cells and get the total Wh.  Example 10S 5Ah (5x2S 5Ah linked in series) then you have 10S\*3.7V\*5Ah = 185Wh

I'm one of the anti-BMS people but I mostly worry about people buying cheap ones with bad instructions and wiring things wrong... also you're effectively strapping your charge circuitry to your board which is basically like a vibration test table.  Basic engineering stuff, less parts = less parts breaking.

That said if you go 18650 and are spot welding your own pack together etc. then I don't see it as a lot more effort to also put a BMS on there for easy charging.

Wow - some great info/advice there - thank you very much. 
One reason I am leaning more towards LiPo is that I have experience with this chemistry (flying UAV's) and I have all the charge gear. 
When it comes to  the 18650 batteries, one big hurdle is that I don't have a spot welder and don't really want to fork out for something that I may only use once. I know that I can purchase these battery packs already made up, which is something I am considering.
Decisions, decisions........

No problem fixed the \* in my post apparently need to escape them now with \

Also on the batteries the 3 or 4P is usually used on 18650 based ones because the max discharge/IR on the cells is such that you can't pull 40A+ from a single cell (usually more like 15-20A per cell), and the more you distribute that amp draw across cells the better (putting them in parallel does this).

With LiPo you have to just look around to see what's good, there is a C rating on the batteries for calculating max draw do C rating * Ah capacity = max discharge in amps, example 40C\*5Ah = 200A the higher that max discharge the better you want it to be well above whatever you will ever actually draw when driving the motor(s) (also manufacturer C rating can't always be trusted).  I also had a charger and some experience with them and also no spot welder or experience with that so stuck with LiPo.

Could also consider using the N.E.S.E for the 18650s if you have the room, no spot welding required.

So, just to ensure I am on the right track here, if I go with the above packs for my battery power, then, do I need a BMS? For charging, I am happy to  just remove the packs to charge them. Just need a way of being able to easily split the packs to balance charge them individually.

Well the choice is either BMS and you don't have to take them out, simple connection for charging/more portable charger or no BMS and using a balance charger
Either works

Okay, I'm in a bit of a bind here, regarding batteries and charging. For batteries, I only want to have a 10s setup. I reckon I'd put myself in hospital with 12s, especially after watching some of the YT videos with 12s boards - that's some crazy shit right there.
So, if I settle on 10s LiPo, then I am best to get 5 X 2s packs. Obviously, the higher the C rating, the better. This leaves me with two possible choices, so far.
This one:https://www.smc-racing.net/index.php?route=product/product&path=67_152&product_id=126

or, this one:http://www.store.revolectrix.com/Products/Blend435-SILVER-Label-70C-GOPACKS/Revolectrix-5800mAh-2S-LiPO-70C-Silver-Label-GP-KO-JST-XH-Balance-Connector

At this stage, I am leaning towards the Revolectrix battery as I know and trust their stuff after using it for many years flying UAV's.

That aside, then I am left with a decision on BMS. This is all new to me, and there is a lot of info on this forum about BMS, but my brain is in overload with all the info I have taken on board so far. Not even beer is helping!!!
So, if you were to recommend a BMS for my current setup, what would it be and why?
```

```
If going BMS there's another decision to be made, use the BMS for charge and discharge or just charge, I recommend charge only BMS and let the vesc handle limiting. Either the Bestech D140 or D190 are good charge only BMS, the 140 does 10A, 190 does 15A
```

## \#17 Posted by: ArnhemAnt Posted at: 2018-01-23T06:38:02.862Z Reads: 190

So, if I understand you correctly, I can set up the dual Focbox to handle limiting/discharge?

This Focbox thing is another evil demon that I need to learn to understand.

## \#18 Posted by: louwii Posted at: 2018-01-23T07:24:59.040Z Reads: 195

```
Yep the Focbox, or VESC in general, have settings to limit the discharge of your battery. You can also limit the amps sent to the motor.
And you can even set a voltage limit for the battery, so you don't discharge it too much.
Very intelligent those things, when programmed properly !

You want to be able to move those parts around, change them and it would cost much more to replace if one thing breaks on combined ESC/bms

There are things in the works that offer communication between ESC and bms but they're still discrete components

I'm thinking back to the 'old days' with flight controllers and multi rotors/UAV's. The flight controller was the brains and it was the link between all other components (ESC's, motors, etc, etc). I don't see why something like this isn't yet available for this application.
Who knows, maybe I am way off track, but it makes sense to me.
The main controller would be where all the necessary settings are made and all other components plug into this and get their programming from this. To save weight and space, this should even be able to be achieved via bluetooth config.
I'm sure this is possible. it just needs the right people to make it happen - and I'm not one of them.

It's easier on copters because it's much lower wattage application, putting more things together is simpler, and as far as i can recall none have built-in charging which would be the BMS....so still none have integrated BMS with esc
The vesc/focbox has pretty much all the same functionality and more compared to copter esc

Update. After a lot of "to and fro' I have learnt that many places that stock and sell batteries and battery enclosures will not ship to Australia (or overseas). I have also decided to move away from LiPo and go with 18650 type batteries instead. I found a setup on DIYboards that includes the batteries, enclosure and BMS and they can ship to Australia. Not the ideal kind of enclosure that I wanted, but I am hoping it will be sufficient.

[This](http://www.diyeboard.com/10s5p-360wh-18650-battery-power-kit-with-bmscharger-enclosure-p-572.html) is what I ordered.
Please tell me it is going to work!!!!

As for mounting options, I really want to keep it under the deck. At this stage, I will be trying to mount it towards the rear, just in front of the rear trucks. The main flex in the board will be in the middle so I want to keep the enclosure away from that. I really don't want to mount anything on the top deck (except my feet).

I think your ok flex wise considering it's pretty short but the height might be an issue for road clearance
Also the bms on those are pretty low amperage discharge, I would consider bypassing if you experience lack of power

What do you mean about low amperage discharge for the bms? Does this mean that the motors won't get the full range of power due to restrictions from the bms?

Yes the BMS limits the full potential of the batteries versus the focbox
That pack is Max 50A discharge and the BMS is likely 30A
I would confirm the specs with @diyeboard though, they got a ton of options and *I think* I have that right but maybe it's changed

Even if it was just 30A from the BMS, what effect would this have on the Dark Matter motors? I presume it would restrict their top speed? How much difference are we talking?
I'm happy to take a drop in speed (providing it's not too much) as I am not after a speed machine.

For such a bad roads city why didn't you go with a HS11 or Holly pro deck, they are way more stable at mid/high speeds on bad roads, you should also consider the Primo Alpha 8" or the Innova Mud pluggers instead of the 7" narrow tyres which I personally don't like.

They say hindsight is 20/20 vision. @Eboosted, I wish I would have known this prior to ordering.....
I opted for the Urban Carver primarily because it had the smaller trucks which, if I understand correctly, make it easier to manoeuvre compared to the other Trampa trucks. I don't want a board for speed. Manoeuvrability is my priority.When placing the order, there was no option to choose 8" rims or tyres (tires) with this board. 7" was the only option I had, and therefore, the Innova Inline tyres were the only option I had. 
I considered getting some 'spare' 8" hubs and Mud Plugger tyres but ended dumping them from my cart as I wasn't sure if they would work on this build (if they aren't an option when ordering, then maybe they don't fit??)- Plus, the price was getting scary as it was. I now know that I could have used the 8" with this setup.

Are you trying to make me envious?? LOL. 
Looks like I'm jumping back on the Tramp site and ordering a full set of the 8" hubs and Mud Plugger tyres.
I'm fine with my selection of the deck and trucks. Overall, the difference is about 115mm in overall length, yet the wheelbase looks the same. I guess a small deck and mini trucks will allow me to turn a lot tighter, which I am good with.

Anyone want to buy a full set of brand new 7" hubs?

I made a modification on my ultimate hangers and my turning radio is ridiculous small, I mean it's crazy compared to even a regular longboard truck and fun to ride. The stability is also pretty nice up to 55km/hr you feel extremely safe and in control. 

Checj the modification  on my thread:

I'm sorry to raise doubts on your build, but I thought you might be open to suggestions/improvements, I'm so happy with the ride quality that I want everyone to get the same benefits and enjoy this board as much as I do.

You're not raising doubts man. In fact, I'm glad you have pointed all this out as it may help others in the future.

I guess a skateboard is just like a boat (I come from a fishing background). No matter what boat you have, it's always a compromise - you'll never get everything you want in the one package. Although, it looks like you are a lot closer to this than I am.

Figured I'd better provide a few updates and I've finally got some time up my sleeve. Since my last post, a fair bit of the gear has arrived and I now have something resembling an E-MTB. The only things I am still waiting on are the enclosure (from @Eboosted) and then a battery pack. 
I have to say that this forum has been a HUGE inspiration to me and I have learnt so much in such a short time - just from reading posts/threads and watching what other members have been doing. This 'hobby' is changing so fast that I'm sure what we are doing right now will be outdated in far less than a year from now.
Massive thanks to the following (Shit, I hope I remember everyone......)
@scepterr for the Dark Matter motors and other bits and pieces.
@Nowind for the 'sexy as fuck' mini direct drive. If you only knew how many nights I sat just staring at these, while enjoying a few cold ales.......
@trampa for a pretty cool deck and trucks. One of the better options, particularly for off-road, which is my ONLY intention with this build.
@stewii for providing me (and the rest of us) with a fantastic alternative to the current market options with the ESCape. Stewii has also provided me with a lot of assistance along the way, with my myriad of 'stupid' questions, as has @Nowind.

I'd also like to send a big thanks to @DanSkates and @Cobber for the PM's - you guys have helped me a lot and I'd love to be at the level you two are at in both your riding and your understanding, and the fact that you are both pioneering some pretty cool shit right now.
Oh, and to @gbutcher for getting me into this mess right from the start. Gaz, because of you, I now have yet another addiction. 

Anyway, as they say, "pictures, or it didn't happen"

The "Arnhemlander" E-MTB as it currently stands. Note that the front trucks are the Mini's, whilst the rear trucks are the 'standard'. This is because I needed wider hangers for the dual E-Toxx drive system. I'm going to stick with this current configuration and just see how it rides.

Check this out! I took this shot to highlight just how compact the drive system is. viewed from the side, with the 8" tyres, you can't even see the drive system. I like that a LOT.

Thank you @stewii

Ground clearance looks pretty good. Hmmmm, better go mop the floor when I finish posting this!!

Another angle showing how compact the drive system is. Did I mention just how much I LOVE this??

Apart from the enclosure and battery/BMS the only other thing I'll probably change is to ditch the Superstars (don't like the bearing 'fit' and the balancing) and go with the hubs that @Kug3lis is making. Just waiting to hear back from him on pricing and availability.

I have some of kugies hubs coming, they are not perfectly balanced though, so you will still need to counter the valve stem weight somehow (I use ABC ceramic balance beads).

I have some gravity decks that I run different width axles on, 10mm wider front. It is crazy how different the bushings feel, and changes in stuff like wheel lift...  

crazy sugestion but, don't be afraid to try fwd with your set up ;)

Interesting. I had never considered that. I'll keep the drive on the rear for now, but it may be worth playing with swapping it over to the front too... This would put the wider trucks on the front and the narrow (mini's) on the rear.

Yep. I can't wait to see the enclosure. One of the very last pieces of this E-MTB puzzle.

@Nowind for the â€˜sexy as fuckâ€™ mini direct drive. If you only knew how many nights I sat just staring at these, while enjoying a few cold alesâ€¦

It's funny how you can fall in love with these machines.  I frequently crack a beer, turn on the lights in my workshop, look at my board and spin the wheels!  My wife thinks I'm crazy - I'll make sure she knows there's plenty more crazy people out there too :rofl:

I've had full on rain here the last 2 days and it's killed me not to ride my board.  I'm actually setting my alarm for sunrise so I can ride first thing in the morning!

This is a very interesting and unique build. I like the combination of trucks, stability plus easy steering. Man your riding boots really made my day :rofl: but I don't think it's a good idea.

This ain't crazy, that's normal.....
Hope you turn on the vescs before you spin the rear wheels. My build took some time because I had to play with the parts before assembling it :grin:

My riding boots have served me well for the past 47 years just as they are. I'm sure they'll continue to do the same, regardless of what I do.

@Eboosted enclosure arrived in the post today - yeehaa. 

Not sure yet whether I'll have the ESCapes in the enclosure or not. My main aim is to get a 12s4p with BMS in there.

I really hope you won't fall at high speed. Then you'll reconsider. 

Had a crash _with_ vans on Sunday and my foot is smashed. Kinda wish I had worn boots...

Thanks man. I don't plan on high speed. My goal is to ride on bush tracks, which will be slow going.

Bush tracks, high torque for the ride in and to drag all those barra back out? Want to see some footage man. CU in the NT ðŸ˜‚ are you based in Darwin?

You're almost spot on mate. Might also try to drag a few buff out of the scrub while I am at it. All the more reason to upgrade to those Helical gears that @Nowind now has - this will give me 'stealth mode'. 

Not based in Darwin - I don't like cities. I'm based out in the real country - Arnhemland. Nothin' but bush out here mate.
