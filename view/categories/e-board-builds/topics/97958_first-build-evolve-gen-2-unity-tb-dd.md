Hello!
Live in sweden 29y old.
I have been skateboarding since last summer.. So quite new in the hobby xD
Fairly good at electronik but a total noob when it comes to skatboarding.

So my first board was a bambo gt and it was amazing the first months..
But when my skill grew and i wanted to go faster the battery sag and range was 
terrible.

So i bought an evolve carbon "gen 2" used for 350 euros last year...
I like the board so now i wanted to upgrade it.

After much reading, I managed to select some parts:

Deck: Evolve carbon gen 2

Esc: Foc box Unity

Motors: So i orderd the TB DD 75kv not sure if the will fit.

Wheels: I got the airless rubber wheels and Tb 110mm

Battery: Bought some cheap 18650 hg-2 from ali-express as its my first time i made a 10s 5p so i can put it in my bambo later.

Put fishpaper between the flexible parts off the battery.

You think it will rub through the plastic of the cell? Or is is it some other reason?

Yeps. I had a battery pack for repair where on some places. It was really close to a short circuit.

they may be 3000mah but only at lower discharge rates,

Nice, wanted to build a 12s but im having a hard time finding a small charge only bms... The once i can find are ether sold out or is for lifepo4. I have a big 12s bms but its bigger than the unity and i dont wanna waste space in the board.

I've got the same deck and I'm just waiting for my unities to complete a 4WD DD build with elofty motors (so maybe I'll get the Unities in 2022...)

Quite curious about the enclosure - did you make it yourself? Is there any heatsink embedded, like in the original one? Do you have enough height in there to fit the unity? 

Great looking board btw!

Cool! how does the elofty feel? Was thinking of buying elofty but went for the TB... Yeah I made it, more like  a test (first time).
Yes it's pretty tight fit but it works :stuck_out_tongue: I want to make it a little bigger cause I can't fit the charge  port and start button on the side ... I didn't know that I needed a heatsink but maybe should look into it..

So i have set the unity: battery 80a brake 35a and motor 80a...
Have very little voltage sag and the battery don't even get hot...
I don't really need more power but does the battery setting "block" the motor setting? So it only can pull 40a per motor? Or how does it work?
```

80a battery is pretty insane.
most have it to ~40a?

battery amp does not "block" motor amps.
It usually is more evident in slow speeds (start from a dead stop/slowly doing up a steep hill):
Since the motors are going slow, they draw (for example) 20v from the VESC.  But need 80a because you are going up a steep hill.  20v * 80a = 1600w

The VESC takes that power form the battery 1600w / 42v (from battery) = 38a draw from battery.

That's a simple one motor example, but you get the idea

Thanks for the answer, so i should lower the battery amp and not the motor amp? 

My battery should be able to handle 5x20a so isn't 80a on the safe side?

And if  I put it at battery 40a and my motors want more amp wouldn't the battery setting block that from happening?

Hi, can anyone tell me if i can fit a Bamboo GTX battery in to a Gen 2 Carbon enclosure? I cant find any threads on this ?

Not really sure but I think the gtx battery is a bit thicker than the carbon gen 2 but ita a easy fix with a rubber gasket or a 3d printer.

It can fit but you need a gasket between the lid and deck

Okay, so after using this board a lot today somthing went wrong, my range went from super long to 20 km after a full charge i took the train home and opend the battery and i see that maybe 10 of my welds on the negative side was off so i started pulling a little harder and almost all of them are off now... The positive side wont come of without ripping the nickel so that side is good what have i done wrong?
