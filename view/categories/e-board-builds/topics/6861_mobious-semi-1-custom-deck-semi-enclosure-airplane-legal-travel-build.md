For the last couple of weeks I have been working on a multitude of designs with other members of Mobious.  (http://mobiousboards.weebly.com/) 
We have come up with 5 optimized designs, all of which are made specifically for electric longboards. This build is documenting the 27" cruiser design that we are currently working on. It will likely be put up for sale on the Esk8 market when finished (https://electric-skateboard.market/)
Here are the first pictures of the extra stiff, semi-enclosure cruising deck!

I don't know what ESC we will be using yet, hoping for a VESC but those take forever to ship. Maybe an FVT will suffice, those have held up well for me in the past. Any suggestions?

Can you guys just make a more traditional design? I'm afraid of the board impaling someone's ankles if it ever gets loose.

@popopopop You mean rounding the edges a bit? We plan on doing that with farther sanding, not trying to make a Razor ðŸ˜‚

ERGH. One problem after another!! 
1) Typical budget difficulties. With everything I wanted for this it would cost well over 900$ and I just don't have that kind of money right now
2) Battery idea also fell through, so much for lithium ion
Ended up deciding to use this for myself to see what changes need to be made in the future. It'll fit 6s2p 4500mah Li-ion with a BMS, but I have decided to use my two existing lipos and also reuse an older belt drive motor setup instead of a hub. This means that the only new parts I really need are: 
1) 6s ESC, as small as possible (thinking about @oriol360's 3-12s ESC because it uses a heat sink)
2) push on/off switch
3) controller

-I ordered an enclosure from @psychotiller and will use that unless plans change 
-deck is ready for staining and polyurethane, pictures soon to come

That Deck Looks Very nice!
What are the dimensions of the cut out?
 I would love to see if my battery fits in to and I could get a very low profile enclosure.

Inside area is 7.25 inches long, 7 inches wide, and 0.4 inches tall. Obviously height isn't a problem because the enclosure will add to that. The one I ordered is an extra half inch tall, this allows me to fit LiPo batteries and a short ESC no problem, idk about li-ion. The ordered enclosure also has a little extra area for wires as well

Enclosure came!! It looks and feels incredible, @psychotiller did an amazing job.

However, I fucked up. Measured with one of my batteries and determined that I needed 0.5 inches interior enclosure height for it to work. It does. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/27c5660f6ff09796fecf86afb9959e74aeead248.jpeg" width="500" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/1fd814dbfd378fda9affb2ffa65163fa5da742ca.jpeg" width="500" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/9/9277bace44760128d938e266bc1d7a3ecefd65f9.jpeg" width="500" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/87f47c8b04c4065a16054322cabe8cb3184490b4.jpeg" width="500" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/b0fb051f41fbc6a6d65d40ea10c84dad8e3a7fc2.jpeg" width="500" height="500">
The other battery (picture above) is a different story though, coming in at an eighth of an inch thicker. The enclosure is a beautiful piece of work, came exactly as I ordered. My mistake was the dumbest thing too...

Measure twice, cut once. 
I measured 3 times, did it wrong every time.

Anyways, I'm thinking of using some kind of insulation or rubber to add the extra 1/8 inch. If that gets too expensive, a new battery is only $25. Not too bad. Any suggestions that might be cheaper?

A rubber gasket would be easy enough. Or I could make an abs gasket out of scrap for you. It could be a perfect fit that way.

Thanks for the suggestions everyone, I took the family boat in for maintenance today and found some insulation padding that I suspected had been there for a while. Took it home, tried it out, and this could not have gone better! I will actually apply everything once the board is stained and drilled.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/d03b61a47e6cc6e8d8e47df69b266f68eea121d5.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f4b82bdafa2c46a45db97a28ff36dc65048e2d64.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/012ff7ad780a73f1f802f9680c99c1b045cad381.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f4460eb86166a0f006473448b4cb93cc1247ca3f.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

Bindings and risers have arrived! ESC is on its way. This thing is finally coming together. One of my lipos went bad, whatever. I'm done with those things. Anyways here's a few pictures

Yes, the deck is flat. I'm currently working on a press that will hopefully change this in future decks, but for now I'm just using inserts in my shoes to not get sore

Ordered the charging adapter as well, and @oriol360 was kind enough to throw in a charging cord bracelet, looks and feels really nice. The quality and the soldering job on the ESC as well as the adapter is just great, beyond anything I could do. I spent months talking with oriole, figuring out what I was going to get and if it would work before I ordered.  Huge thanks for the help and the quality behind every one of these items.

It's actually pretty great. The angled risers help a lot with the wheelbase and I have the bindings to chip in as well. Here's what it looks like

Charging adapter arrived from MiamiElectricBoards and it works perfectly. Voltage meter and on/off ports are glued, I decided not to glue the banana ports because they need to be able to move around a bit. Now the only remaining challenge is getting everything to fit in there. After that I'm done.

@willpark16 First run today!! Went really well actually. I rode about 3 miles and the voltage went from 24.4 to 22.8 by the time I was done. At that rate I'd get around 5 miles I think (quick math), but I'd expect realistically around 4.5 miles. Best part is I have the second battery if I ever need to get my range up, but this is meant to be more of a last mile solution anyways. 
Three things I need to do: 
1) Change height of the bindings, they're slightly too low
2) Secure the ESC and wiring inside the board better - way to much rattling
3) Invest in a camera - iPhone 5 just doesn't cut it anymore. Any suggestions?
