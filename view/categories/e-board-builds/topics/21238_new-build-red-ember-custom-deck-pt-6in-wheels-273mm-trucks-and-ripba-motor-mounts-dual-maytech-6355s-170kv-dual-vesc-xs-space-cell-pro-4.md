I am also doing a build with one of the redemberboards.com decks (thanks @treenutter) and @psychotiller 6in AT wheels & RIPBA mounts. I am using Paris 195's instead.  with I almost posted a pic of parts today, but figure I'll wait until I actually get all my parts in.  Good luck, I look forward to seeing how it performs and looks.

@Crushkrew  Looks like you will get to the finish line before I even start the race...That will be **_one_** of the baddest boards to hit FLL streets! 

Watch out Riverwalk!

It will be fun to test out our boards, they are same but different as wise chinese man once say...

@Crushkrew @mmaner
340 belts.

You just need to loosen the motor bolts enough to be able to slide the motor while putting the wheel and belt on. Then pull the motor away from the wheel pulley until the belt is tight and tighten the front motor mount screw. Then take the wheel off, tighten the rest of the motor screws and then put the wheel and belt back on. You shouldn't have to readjust the belt tension again after that first time if you get it right..<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/c/6cc17577018d6a24522fde3d7ad02733fd4a91e9.jpg" width="282" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/7/c7e6fc2aba36b75f2825b2984bf5c0643c56c017.jpg" width="689" height="390"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/b/1b0cbe63d8cb8655cd76faf332f401624c398805.jpg" width="282" height="500">

You may want to remove the outside flange on the motor pulley too. It makes more room and makes for faster wheel/belt maintenance.

I used black zinc coated allen head screws to mount the motor to the motor plate.  The coating was "grabbing" the inside wall of the slot.  It took me a little while to figure that out.  Once I used a wire brush on the threaded body of the screw it was like butter, no worries.

How do you remove the flange?  Pry? Or do you have to grind it off?  Thx

I just use a pair of wires cutters. Grab the flange and bend it a little all the way around. It'll just fall off

Okay so I had to rethink the graphics I had in mind when I saw how nice the Driftwood stain came out on the Red Ember board... So in the vein of an old  whiskey barrel here she is... did a weathered semi flat to give it the old school feel

And she gets her name .....
Old Number 7... 

I'll spray the Lucid grip tomorrow...<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/9/99312c5e2b0b3beebb90a6fb0874b76615d50965.jpg" width="375" height="500">

It's pretty cool stuff...just don't use the pump bottle it comes with...it splatters...I used the aresol sprayer they sell for a couple bux...works great....

You just lay down a couple light coats then salt shaker the glass dust on then lay down a couple more...let it dry for a bit then repeat....I did that 3 times to build up the grip....

So I got some miles on this build and I gotta say the combo of the @treenutter Caldera board; @psychotiller motors & 6 shooters; @yummyblobs @onloop vrsc-xs; spacecell 4; and GT trux is just awesome....Old No 7 just eats up any terrain and really just rides like butter...no more worrying about cracks or twigs or rough areas...she just glides right over....exceeded my expectations...thanks to all the members that helped along the way... @mmaner and @treenutter and @psychotiller....lovin it

Hell yeah man I got inspired by your build! I just picked up a set of @psychotiller wheels for a similar build!

Beautiful build. I'm 100% going to have him build my deck. 

How many miles do you thing this bad boy is going to go?

@Crushkrew How have the Maytech motors been holding up? I am about to buy one for my single wheel drive board.
