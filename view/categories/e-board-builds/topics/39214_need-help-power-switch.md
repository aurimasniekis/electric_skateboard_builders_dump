Hi Guys! I just bought an enclosure today and it will be drilled closed to my deck, obviously, and the only way to turn it on would be using a power switch. I saw power switches like this, products/on-off-power-switch-electric-skateboard1 , but I just cant fit that in my budget. Are their any cheaper alternatives?

The simplest and cheapest method is to use an xt90 anti spark loop key

Loop key is not only the cheapest and simplest, it is also the most reliable.
