Hi,

I just got some new belts and pulleys to help with belt slipping and now I am having trouble of the pulley on the motor slipped with the two set grub screws. There is a keyway on the pulley but I don't have a way to mill a keyway onto the motor shaft.

Any solutions or advice would be appreciated.

Cover the motor completely with tape or a bag then grind or dremel a flat spot on the shaft.
If you do a search there should be some in depth descriptions. You just want to stop the metal fillings going into the motors magnets!

i had this issue as well. i just covered the inside of my motor pulley in thread lock, slipped it on, tightened the screws and waited a day. it never moved again

I might try this. I was thinking about it but I didn't have access to a dremel at all but I could maybe as a local shop

That sounds sketchy and unreliable... but maybe i'll try that if I get desperate

Are you guys using stainless steel grub screws? I think mine is just steel and kinda stripping out the allen key on it

Stainless will be softer than proper machine grub screws.
Filing or grinding a flat spot is very reliable if you do it right.

Jenso (NoWind) doesn't even use grub screws (I'm not either) and he is known for destroying things, all he uses is loctite...

bit of a trick removing them though, i'll see if I can find it

It does come off eventually, heat build up from belt friction will burn the loctite, It happened to me twice.

I think if your drivetrain is getting that hot from slipping on the pulley or maybe also from conducting heat from your motor you might have another problem that needs attention?

 in the mid sunny summer day it does get super hot and if u ride long enough it will starts to slip out miss align the belt and belt get shreded. unless u torch the pulley to pressure fit on gear and then loctight, just dap of glue will slip out. gear is less of an issue but the belt is really easy to heat up

I am super careful with mine, I use a key way with locktite in it, 2 blue loctited set screws and a c-clip

Edit: Itâ€™s never, ever coming off ðŸ˜‚

Can't contribute much since I've just built my board 3 days ago but loctite 648 is holding well so far, doesn't wiggle at all. Then again I live in a place that doesn't get hot at all so.... :confused:

personally I didnt use 648 stuff. It sounds pemenent. and if permenent how will u remove later?
but normal superglues will melt around 80-90degree c and tho it doesnt completely melt, it will missalign belt, due to tension

but 648 is no different flash point on this is 93c. melt point is lower.

Keyway and two grub screws(with red loc tite) is the way to go. I like to grind a small flat spot on the motor shaft, and then grind the keyway down to the perfect thickness so that you can "press" it in there. I sand the keyway down with a piece of sand paper until its the right thickness, then set the pulley on the shaft with a spacer behind it so it stays where I want it and lightly tap in the keyway. The keyway will take a lot of load off of those tiny till grub screws.

Use  LOCTITE 641 then, its easier to remove. Google 3m retaining compound, there are many different grades.
