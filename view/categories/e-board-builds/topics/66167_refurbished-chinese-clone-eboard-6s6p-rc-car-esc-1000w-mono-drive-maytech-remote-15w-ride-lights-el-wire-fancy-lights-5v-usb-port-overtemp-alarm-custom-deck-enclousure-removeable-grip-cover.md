Hi

A gift for my niece, little lady she is. 
Took long time with this bastard, but it was kinda exploration for me, like Colombous: any place you land counts. 
Lots of trial, error and citizen science trying out some ideas. Don't like this type of setups. The 'ladder' type is imho much better after optimization
