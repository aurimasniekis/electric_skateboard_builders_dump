im getting a deal through a friend to buy some lifepo4 at a $1 each so i figured dam ill grab 200. im currently on a project right now with another lined up after so this will be after that. not sure what to do with these cells other than use it on an e-board. super fresh to this thing. not sure how to go about it, been doing a bit of reading and should i go all out with 4 motor 12s12p. sounds lots of fun but how should i get to that? buy each part individually or is it possible to use an existing model hopefully without battery and build my own pack.

should i get more batteries, what else should i build?

Do a bit more reading, look for other people's builds and think about parts, come back to here when you've got more of an idea about what you're getting into

Also what lipos did you get?

Finding an enclosure and deck to fit 12s12p and two dual or 4 single vesc is going to be a challenge. What are the dimensions of the lipos?

If you can get batteries super cheap I would always ask myself, where they coming from and are the legit or if used, whatâ€™s there conditions.

Nothing more annoying than having shitty cells in your board. Or letâ€™s say worst case, nothing more shitty than lightening up your whole build because somebody sold you fake cells.

If you want motors to handle that power this is a good start, a group buy for custom MayTech 6880 motors (top notch quality) is open

Power: 3.3V (nominal voltage) * 12 (series count) * 50A (continuous amps) * 12 (parallel count) = 23,760W (5,960W per motor)

Range: 3.3V (nominal voltage) * 12 (series count) * 2.5 (capacity) * 12 (parallel count) /  18Wh/mi (generous efficiency) = 66mi on a single charge

I see this is going through the last comments.
Just because your battery can output 1000000A it does not mean you need to use this. Your battery will just supply what you ask for. No need for special motors or what not ever.

My recommendation if our want something insane without regard for cost is get 4 of the 6880 and the helical drives that are going to be out soon for the drive

Do a 13s battery to max out the voltage on the motors and ESC and 5p for the amp discharge

You'll get about 30mi on it but at least you could carry it, battery will be 11lbs and maybe another 20lbs for the rest of the board

The 6880 has same ratings than other 6374 motors. Itâ€™s not a better motor regarding this point.

But it will last longer at max power if that's important to him, he said he wanted hella performance and I'd assume he's gonna want to go all out of he's putting this much into it

ur suggestions looks like an optimal setup which is awsome, tnx much, but also i believe i read that its best not to drain your batts at high c as it effects its life. wouldnt it be good idea to add some more for "p" for this case, not necessarily for performance but just battery longevity?

Then add another cell or two per parallel pack to account for a loss to discharge and capacity, so 6p or 7p to support 4 65A motors

Yes, but itâ€™s not maxing something out. You can go 14s lifepo4 to have similar max voltage to 12s LiIon

Actually 12s li-ion and 14s LiFePO4 are 50.4V at full charge, so yeah 14s would be the best 12s equivalent

Not too hard to do. 12s12p dual here but I still have room for 2 more vesc's. Wheelbase is about 24 inches.

I dont have the link, but depending on your stance and board. You could do a top and bottom mount battery. I saw a EMTB doing that for the same reason. So like two seperate 14s6-7p lifopo4,one top box and one bottom enclosure each going to dual can focboxs(or 2 unity's)... buuut it would be heavy AF lol. Youll get killer range and maintained power bc of the split load btw 4 motors/vesc/batteries and probably like NO sag bc ur weight... I have 12s8p 30q dual Trampa Mtb and the sag bc my weight is sadðŸ˜­ I weigh 270lbs. What everybody else is saying and im pretty sure you want. Maintaned power, performance, range... if monies no issue I wouldve too.... but tbh what everyone is saying about legit batteries is true. I wasted a couple hundred on fake 30q cells. Had to re order and wait for legit cells and pay more againXD.

As a long time rider and an owner of a 4wd build also one of the heaviest riders here i would suggest that 4wd 12s anything is not ok for a bigginer even if you can build it properly. Its hard to handle the power, id suggest build 2 2wd boards that way you always have a back up board when one need maintenence or one breaks, its also nice to have another board so friends can ride with you.

Clearance is not too bad, the belly pan is about 1/2 inch higher than the truck hangers so anything the trucks clear will be clear of the enclosure. The belly pan is an aluminum panel bent to fit.

I will be adding a 3rd motor to the front truck for added stability. :sweat_smile:  

@Battosaii I think a first time builder can build a fairly user friendly 4wd build if they keep the top speed in check. My main concern is the high voltage power mains since they can give you a good burn if you are not careful.

I dunno i dont see the point of 4wd if you are going to be using conservative settings. Its alot of added complexity and weight and points of failure to not really use it to its potential seems pointless

Building 2 dual drive boards would be alot more practical for a begginer.

## \#45 Posted by: chaka Posted at: 2019-04-16T00:32:37.778Z Reads: 49

Efficiency is what stands out for me. A 4wd with a gear drive or direct has proven to be more efficient than a single drive or dual.  Why not stage the build and start testing with a dual but leave room for an extra set of motors?

I was also lucky enough to ride a @psychotiller 4wd at bako and it was very user friendly! way more predictable than I remember from my first single drive. Going with quad also has the upside of running motor controllers at half the norm and this greatly reduces the likelihood of malfunctions due to high currents ect...
