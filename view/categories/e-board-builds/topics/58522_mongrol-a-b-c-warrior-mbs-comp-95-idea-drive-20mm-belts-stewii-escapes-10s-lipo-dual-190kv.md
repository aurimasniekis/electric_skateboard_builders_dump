So i managed to buy a old MBS Comp 95 dirt cheap "£65" but in very good condition! it has been sitting about doing nothing for a few years, needs love and though not a Trampa its perfect for my first build. 

![comp%2095|375x500](upload://9I8XPO2w7cdF2NgEyf5A0hXABK6.JPG)

The horrible Twistar hubs are being replaced with im thinking red Rockstars pros "on sale cheaper than Rockstars ATM"

Also deffo purchasing spare top trucks, bearings, tubes, tires.

I dont have the board in my hands yet as my friend picked up for me in Cornwall and is bringing it to me in south east Kent next time he's over my way early July sometime.

When i'm happy with the board and after buying safety gear helmet/pads, probably by the end of july il start the build in earnest, ie Motor Mounts, Motors, Esc, Remote, Battery.

I'm doing the exact same thing as you at this very moment. Keep posting pics. Are you doing lipos in a box on TOP? Mbs eu is having an awesome sale right now on the aluminium pro wheels

At this time plans are yes @biggdaddyhawk lipos top mounted 8s/10s depending on Escs, Max6 8s first choice "easy option" but if i can get on @stewii 's next Escape run :wink:  il go 10s maybe, im keeping this option open as those Escapes are almost the same price as the max6 but far better in terms of options and aesthetics imo.

So battery it will be top mounted but like Crazy RCs board on youtube il use a camo pouch that il reinforce .

Not sure what you mean by "like a mountain street tramp" so il just say yes!! exactly like that.... :crazy_face: 

So i've been thinking about naming the board/build and it came to me last night, because of the red and yellow gaudiness im going to end up with and my obsession with 2000AD comics.

spare top trucks and new Rockstar hubs turned up today..... Happy Days :smile: 

![myhub|666x500](upload://3V26JetWCn8Xlq5FZe0Q7SCmeSB.jpg)

First problem... So i haven't got spacers that go in between the bearings of each hub, going to have find an solution, anyone with links or details on correct spacers, or am i not needing them???

By way i mean these tube things in the centre around the axle path of the two hub parts...

Your red hubs are of a new type

I know a lot of people will tell you you need spacers however the MBS rock star wheel hub has a lip that holds the bearing in place (inner lip) They also have a very tight fit for the bearings in my case I needed to heat up the wheel/hub and cool down the bearing (freezer) to bang them in place (rubber mallet). If you have not yet seated the bearings I suggest from experience to seat bearings before you bolt the wheel together and inflate.

Good luck they are real nice wheels,

Kevin

I'll be going for torque over speed on gearing, at this time i cant remember the ratio il post info later.

I have got the Trucks turning up today or tomorrow so il be trying to get the wheels on and balanced by the end of the week then, i can take my measurements and order the mounts/pulleys/belts, also at this time im not completely sure what mount to get, as Tom has a few options.

After getting the mount system i will choose motors escs remotes then buy lipos chargers in that order, i may wait for cyber monday for some bits, my maximum build time is near or after this Christmas as i'm in no rush and want to get it correct the first time.

I ordered a 72t wheel gear from evolve website that fits rockstar rims. Not exactly sure why it's spaced off the rim so far but I guess it will work. Also the gear has a slight angle towards the rim I'm guessing to help keep the belt on. For $30.00 each i will see how they hold up.

Good and the bad....

So to my dismay the deck is slightly warped :face_with_raised_eyebrow: i will buy a replacement, but ive been stressing the deck and have reduced the warp for now to about 3-4mm from 8mm so i will continue to use this deck until such a time i find/buy a suitable replacement.

Anyway good news my Triple 8 bumsavers have arrived (sorry no pictures :blush:  )and ive just ordered my second to last bit of protection....

Jus found some chunky washers that i didnt know i had!!... I have placed them under the rubber mounts for now may change if the esc box ends up to high!!! but for now they give a bit more damping squishiness and will help keeping the water out of the fixings, going to put some liquid tape around the bottom of each one as well probz.

So i need some esc settings advice... @Andy87  @Riako @b264  anyone... 
Ive powered up both escs ive connected 2 x receivers to one remote, but im yet to run anything, i am watching as many videos as i can to familiarise with the software and setup process.

My setup
2x 6s 8000ah 15/30c 
2x Escape esc's 
2x 168kv 2x motors, no sensors.
2x receivers one remote.

I want to set it up with about 50/60% of what it could do, so i get somewhere around the 20mph top speed mark, with that in mind whats the settings that best suit, thanks in advance....

edit... also want to know about setting a failsafe for remote connection failure, and any other advice on pitfalls i maybe unaware of would be super cool.... :sunglasses:

Even if you lower your max values in the vesc you will reach your geared top speed. It just will take longer.
If you want to limit your top speed you need to limit your max erpm or use an app with which you can setup your max speed.

By the way, how you like the motor mounts?
I‘m thinking of getting one set of them too.
But not sure yet if the clearance is enough on the back.

Thx!

You can, but not by settings the max amp values to the half.
It’s like a car with 100HP which you restrict to 60HP. You still reach the 120km/h just once it’s faster with more torque and once it takes longer.
Sure if you set the values so low that it would take like 5km till reach your top speed you als will not ever drive that fast.

To half your theoretical top speed you need to calculate the max erpm you would reach with your actual gearing and than set your max erpm limit to half of it in both vescs.
You can use this calculator to get your numbers

Thanks, i wish i had built a Trampa but timing on having the money when a good secondhand one was for sale was bad, i actually don't like the overall look of my board at the mo (kinda looks like its from the 80's) thinking about taking the red anodising off the spare set of hubs i have to cut down on the color overload... :blush: 

I suppose i should i say its not turning out how i thought it would, i still love it its just not what i would do if i had a second go at it, which would be get the MBS birds and upgrade the back hanger to a metal one, best advice i can give is if you do start a build is....

Don't have a budget :smile:

```
It’s not that difficult as soon as you understand the logic behind.
Basically you have three parts you need to look at first and find there max and min values.
That’s 
1. your battery max constant current for charge and discharge 
2. the max constant current your vesc can handle
3. the max constant current your motor can handle 

With the first two points you set your battery max and min values according to the weakest point.
So let’s say your escapes can handle 60-80A constant and your battery can handle 80-100A constant, I would set the batt max value to 40A in each esc. Why 40 and not 80A? Because your escs are connected parallel so you need to half the max value of your battery output.
For the motor max value, you have sk3 motors, look up the specs, they should be rated to 60-80A something like this. So a good staring point would be to set the motor max at 60A.

Let’s jump to the motor and bat min values.
What you need to know
In general they regulate how strong your breaks are.
Motor min is dominant at low speed.
Batt min is dominant at high speed.
The more far the values from 0 the stronger the breaks (-40a is stronger break than -20).
If you look at your battery with 8Ah you can charge them with 1C so 8A that would make a batt min of -4A per vesc. As you don’t break a full charge cycle, but usually only like 10-20sec max I think (and that’s only my opinion) it’s ok to set the batt min value to -10 to -12A per esc.
For the motor min I would start with -55A.
Take your board for a spin and look how it feels and in case you not happy just adjust the values.
Let the batt min values how they are and adjust the motor min values to -60 till -80A if the breaks too weak, or to -50 to -40 if they to strong.

Long text but I hope it’s understandable and helps you out 😅

i will have more questions no doubt and unfortunately :blush:  but il leave you be for now, take the rest of the day off you hansom bastard... 

Im off to do some motor detection.....  and software revision...

Some more precise/full system details...

each Escape 80a -120a burst.

each Motor max load 70a, max power 2400w. 

Batteries 8000ah 15c/30c with a max charge of 5c (not 1c ,does this make a difference?also what amps is best to charge them at?)
bat pack combined 120a - peak 240a i think!!

so, settings in order would be

BLDC.

MOTOR.
Motor current max. 60a
Motor current max break. -60a

BATTERY
Battery current max.30a < unsure on this one
Battery max regen. -10a

then click next :blush:

Looks good!
Start with it, there is still some head room on your bat max value but I would change it only if you not happy or want more power 😅
The settings you chose are save 👌

Charging current, the lower the better (if the lipos rated 5c than theoretically 40a 😂🤦‍♂️)
4-8a should be fine.

Done, i've set bat max on 40a, so the (set soft voltage limits) section now, 
Currently reads..

Battery voltage cut off start 40.80 v

Battery voltage cut off end  37.2 v

What if any changes are required?

## \#63 Posted by: Andy87 Posted at: 2019-01-14T11:37:06.596Z Reads: 64

That’s the standard values probably.
3.1V per cell is too low for your lipos.
3.7V cut of start and 3.5V cut off end per cell should be fine.
So 44,4V and 42V.

look that your motors can spin freely.
than push the play button.
make sure the result is valid and than press apply.
only after apply press next step

Andy is the man, thanks for the community once again mate ;) :+1: 

From my xp with Graphene, they prefer to stay at 3.7v, so I set 3.7v/cell for cuttoff start and 3.6v for cut off end (I think they should be more than 1v difference but I don't remember since when/where/and if what I say is true :sweat_smile: and ride like this during more than a year).
I charge at 1C so 8A for you it's good, you can rush it with 1.5/2c when you need to ride quick, but 1c is fine and more long-life for your lipo I suppose.
(but don't go down to 3.6v/cell with your Graphene, I do it once and it's the only on time I see them pop a little micro bit. Since I ride around 1000km at motor max70A min-70, motor batt max70 min-25 wo any problem)

Thanks @Riako  im in the ppm settings at the mo, but il adjust the settings as you suggest when im out of the ppm section, i charged the batteries at 4a... it took fecking ages...lol

So as said im in the ppm bit now... is it select no reverse with break apply?

no, just push your trigger once totally to the front and totally to the back.
than push apply and you will see the red bar will be centered.
it means your remote is than calibrated to the vesc.

I have a CAN cable but i also had two receivers, i went with dual binding to one remote because of the redundancy factor as in, if one esc blows its just one esc, hopefully.

Super cheap £2.99 light (headlamp) i stumbled across in a pound shop, used the super duper strong 3M Velcro to attach, the light will probz break at some point should be an easy fix if it does tho.,but it il do for now. 

I may buy one more so if i want i can use that one as a headlamp or spare.
Here's what it looks like.

Mostly all headlamps are cheap i looked at lots online the really good ones tho are stupidly pricey, rock climbing and cave diving ones ie hard wearing, totally waterproof and rechargeable would be nice but for me not really needed as, i don't intend to ride at night much or on the road at all, this (the one i got)  is just incase i get caught out in the dark.

So im just waiting on my bigger bat box (last one to small) and wheel balancing putty to arrive, then i can balance my wheels, loctite my motors and pulleys, thats it apart from a few changes i will make later such as new bindings, new eggshocks, and second batt pack.

Tho i might (if my new bat box is big enough) buy two more of the 6s 8000ah Graphenes so my batt is doubled to 16000ah

Are you happy with it so far? How did you manage to balance out the wheel?  My Wheels are wobbling because of the valve + my new tube is losing air even if there is no hole.

You can buy a set of 5g weights for rc cars or usual cares and just glue as much as you need of them on the opposite of the valve. Should balance out the wheel pretty good.

Love/Hate..  Done in total 120 miles, i had my first proper off a few weeks back, hit a patch of sand while riding (15-20mph) along a seawall, (lost a fingernail and some knuckle skin but board ok :slight_smile: ) ::

Build wise shes a needy b!tch and has many issues i have to solve, im waiting on shim washers/speed rings i also want the new metal top trucks, and new wheels, also really need to upgrade my motor bolts and esc enclosure.. apart from that and thats not all its finished LOL

Balancing... like @Andy87 said get the sticky backed lead weights, i also used black tack to cover (waterproof) the lead weights as that sticky bit on the back is not that sticky, and the black tack helps with sticking and balancing (no cutting small bits of lead or lose weights).

Thats good to hear (except the accident)

I'm almost ready to go (After almost 5 Months of building it)  But Ineed to order a new deck and stumbled upon the same deck you have.
EDIT : it's the MBS Comp 95 Birds deck
 Do you recommend it? I weigh about 95kg and i'm going to ride with mbs matrix 2 trucks, 8" tires, dual 6374's.
