Next to Thanos build, I need something for those days that you want just more. At least that is the plan :grin:
My main aim is always to make something stealth, belt drive, gear drive are really good...I know it's me but i can not drive something electric that make more noise than my car. It's a my thing but I need something different. I have been using hub motors and last year moved to direct drive. After the first DD made (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mad-fury-mad-hubs-direct-drive-conversion/83423), I immediately wanted to make another one. the rest of the story is known nad if you missed you can find it here :smile:
 (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mad-storm-the-attempt-to-create-the-most-powerful-direct-drive-lol/85962). 
So let's get started...

Idea:

![image|690x388](upload://igLgDH9BNSi2v9brSPXq2JToCpz.jpeg) 

Parts:

* **BullyDeck** @rey8801 Oh my dears how much time for designing and make it happen. It was a pain :rofl: but what to say, I dream it for long time a drop down deck fully integrated...stealthy AF!

* **MAD Storm DD**  @rey8801 Freshly finished. I hope that will give me back half of the time I spent making them

* **Popoca 90mm** Simply because I love low ride and popoca is the best 90mm wheels I have used so far. I will probably experiment different wheels in the future though.

* **12s4p 30Q** Gonna use NESE approach @agniusm, with modified modules from @mishrasubhransu 

* **FOCbox Unity**




Where I am now...
Making the battery. Still waiting the final bms. It's gonna be tiny or no way I can fit it.

Why don't you put your VESC perpendicular to have all modules the same? Looks enough space will be left

Because the central wall is there to give supports. If I remove it then the whole deck loose integrity. Put it perpendicular would helps a lot for sure but not possible without making the deck thicker.

You have lost a lot of that strength with the cutouts on that ridge.

If it were me, I would lose the central ridge and make the whole cutout narrower.

Otherwise awesome job as always. :ok_hand:

I thought about it but I would have 6-7mm left on top of the deck

Maybe it's not understandable from the picture but the lateral walls are really thick. Like 30 x 30mm. I think they are rather strong. I will see it when it's done. From the itial test the deck was fine but until I stress it properly I can not be sure about it.

What if you bolt on CF flatbar to stiffen it up?

That would probably work, but I am ok with having the 2 chambers. It's a bit more planing in making the battery but for the rest is the same.
