Hey peep, I am looking for build an electric skate board with 35mph+ and range of 30miles+. If you had 2,000 to drop on the board what components would you use and if you could build your own batteries what batteries would you use. Drop links and let the madness happen.

Where do you live?  Hills or flats?  Smooth or rough roads?  

What kind of deck do you like?

(and what @TarzanHBK said)

In Los angeles and I travel from West Hollywood to Santa monica. There are some 15% grades and sometimes I hit 30% grade but thats a specific hill that I tend to walk after half way to save battery.

You are going to need a shitload of batteries.

Since your budget is pretty big, I would go with Samsung 30q cells, with a 10S5P configuration (540Wh, ~33 miles based on my previous experience with range/watt hour). You could, of course, go with 10S6Pand get more range, but at the cost of a bulkier and heavier board.

For motors, use dual 6374s, I'd go with the ones from DIY electric skateboard or similar, I've had SK3s fall apart on me.

You're going to need to go with a 10s5p battery. Go 30q's if possible.
Also, with that size pack you are going to need clearance which means you'll need 107mm wheels or bigger. Look for abec 11 flywheels.

18650 are tiny! 
they pack so much energy!

its not hard to overwhelm the motor or even the vesc with the current 18650 are capable of !

It will be a nice build!

good luck!

If you have a road board already and 2k burning a hole in your pocket why not go all terrain!

Should be fine with 97mm wheels the evolve gtx has a massive battery pack you just need a longer board to accommodate.

If you arrange your cells in a triangular form like I did, you should have plenty of clearance under the deck. Here's a 10S4P pack I made (which is going to get another layer of shrink wrap before going into my next build). It measures 8"x5.5"x1.4". I'm running 83mm wheels with a custom enclosure, and have plenty of clearance under the deck. If you make a 10S5P pack the same way, it should come out only 10"-11" long!

Trampa Urban Carver. Can accomodate a massive battery and you can switch between all terrain and street, @barajabali is using a 12S5P battery on his trampa. Look up Kalys builds for inspiration.

Or just wait for the carvon v3's to be released and you can switch from eurothane to pneumatic wheels like an F1 pit stop!!

you can do that with evolve or just about any diy as long as you have the right wheel sprockets and the board can fit tyres

Do you have a link to any pneumatic wheels that fit flywheel pulleys?

```
youll want to have different pulleys for the different wheels, to keep the same speed and torque as flywheels youll need more teeth on the pneumatics pulleys, if you have an rpm of 8000, a motor pulley of 15 teeth, a flywheel pulley with 36 teeth and you put that on 200mm pneumatics your top speed will be 127km/h ish, but you wont have anywhere near enough torque to get you to even 40km/h. But anyway https://www.evolveskateboards.com.au/collections/accessories/products/gt-at-kit?variant=28314759945 this is an easy conversion kit, id still recommend just getting something like these and using trampas wheels, diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torque-trampa-dual-motor-mount-kit/

So I wonder how well the pneumatic wheels will work on the carvon v3 as there is no pulley as such with teeth just the flywheel style through the wheels built in from the motor.

ahhh, hub motors are a completely different story, by the looks of it I'm pretty sure theyre the only ones who will have pneumatics with flywheel cores, but yeah with hub motors theres very little customization you can do, can always try casting your own but building a furnace and making a mould for the wheels is tedious and will probably break your budget

found these great 6" Aluminum alloy for regular size trucks. Check this dude out. His setup is legit for quick interchanging wheels.
