Since this is my first post I think it's only proper that I introduce myself to this incredible community because without you guys I would have never even considered a DIY esk8 setup. 

I'm Jason and I've been a non esk8 rider for roughly 10 years, long boards specifically. (Did this just turn into an AA meeting? :sweat_smile:
I tend to ride a park near my house in Houston, TX round trip roughly 8-10 miles and have probably maxed out at 15-20 mph on some of the hills in Austin on my trusty Landyachtz drop carve. It was my first complete non esk8 setup that I sinked some 400 bucks into including some ceramics. I was hooked and never looked back. Been riding for years but I'm starting to feel it on my knees and when the summer is in swing +90 degree temps are brutal on my stamina. So the idea of going esk8 has been lingering in my head since early 2014. I'll be honest before I found this forum and really started reading about esk8 I was almost convinced I was going to buy a v2 used boosted board. I'm happy to say that thanks to many of the excellent posts and community I've found at esk8 I was easily swayed to take a crack at my first DIY. 

My budget is under **$1800 USD** but I'm a firm believer in buying quality once and keeping it maintained. Also if I can save money that's a bonus. So now that I've said hello let me get to the culmination of all my research. Mind you I didn't sign up on this forum for a solid month or so even though I was reading through much of that time.  

I still have my first **Landyachtz Drop Carve 40** setup laying around and although I've not used it for some time she's still a really nice ride (I take good care of my stuff). I decided to name this setup Koi because there's two koi fish on the bottom of the deck. I know i'm clever as hell right? :relieved:
I thought since it's a 40 inch board (ample for a beefy esk8 setup) and my first board ever, it would make a lot of sense and sentimental value to me that this deck became my first esk8 base to work from. I'm also not sure if I'll be able to run it drop through or top mount yet but I would like to get it back to its glory days when it was a drop through.

![Drop%20Carve%2037|375x500](upload://Aq68d77kPBQhX8nSA4qMLaE3US6.jpeg) 

(She's a bamboo core pressed in a medium flex fiberglass)

**_EDIT 05/07/19_** Decided to get the **Haya HB92 V2** after finding some structural cracks in my Landy that I wouldn't feel safe riding at 30 mph. Still going to use the koi design to mock up something amazing with @sender on the Haya. This is going to simplify the setup process exponentially :+1:t3:

![logo%203|690x499](upload://cZ3Z9zzJdv4sqrzQz4VNvsMsllY.jpg) 
(Shout out to @bevilacqua for the quality board she's a beauty)

So I weigh about 170 lbs and 5'10 and I wanted something powerful enough to push me up to **30 mph** or so and could handle some **10-15% hills** on occasion when I visit Austin. I realize I'm going to be tweaking about the speeds over 20 mph on my first few rides as an esk8 board but I'm used to bombing garages pretty fast and taking some hefty sidewalk cracks along the way. I'll build up to top speed as I become comfortable on the board again and will always be wearing a helmet. I plan on using this first setup 3-4 times a weeks when the weather permits. 

So I'll lay out my planned list of parts to buy and **I'd love to know your thoughts**. I'd also like some help making sure **I'm not missing some things in my build** which I'm quite sure is at least a few cable connectors. 

**AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS POST I'LL LAY OUT AN ITEMIZED LIST**. I plan on updating this post with pictures as I acquire and start to build this beauty. 

We got the **BOARD** out of the way so I'll start with what I think is the most important piece of hardware,  the **Battery**. From what I've learned the **30q batteries** are where it's at in terms of quality and efficient discharge. Since this is my first build I'm not even going to try to go the DIY route for batteries as I'm not experienced enough in coupling batteries together yet. So far I think the **DIY 12s4p battery** is what I'm probably looking for but I'm not really excited about the battery meter and power switch being exposed at the bottom of the housing for weather seal concerns and scuffs. **Are there some other recommendations you guys have for a battery of this size running 30q or equal quality?**
![12S4P|690x459](upload://yMh5S0b2B4i9Xsx8eTYwkcmR1WM.jpeg) 

(**UPDATE 05/07/19** Will be getting a custom 12S4P to fit the Haya)

Next the **MOTOR**. After doing a lot of research I was convinced I wanted Hub motors similar to the raptor 2.1s because I didn't feel I needed insane torque and I really liked the idea of less moving parts and not worrying about quite as much maintenance on belts and keeping motor mounts tight. Sadly I was not excited about thinner urethane wheels and was also concerned about the abuse these kind of motors could actually handle at 1000+ miles of use. Then I got into direct drives and it seemed to be the answer to all my needs but there just wasn't that many of them out there yet. Finally the **Torqueboards Direct Drive System** was announced and now that I've read about how much people are enjoying them on this forum I'm sold on this as my dual motor setup. This setup comes with;

**- 2x TORQUE D-DRIVE MOTORS FOR A DUAL DIRECT DRIVE MOTOR DRIVE TRAIN**

**- 1x FRONT &amp; REAR PRECISION CNC TRUCKS w/ 50D BASE PLATES**

**- 2x TRUCK RISERS**

**- 1X BOLT HARDWARE SET**

![Torqueboard%20DD|690x459](upload://dBnDV27TUqNvkk2Ke3ag32F69Ci.jpeg) 
**(I'll be getting the 75KV Motors with the 110mm Wheels from TB)**

Now to the **ESC**. Since I would be dealing with dual motors and it's my first setup I was feeling a bit overwhelmed in this department. I wanted to have a dual VESC running and I also really wanted the ability to tweak my setup via Bluetooth or some kind of app so that I wouldn't need to open my enclosure all the time. That's why I decided on the **Focbox Unity**. It really feels like this is a no brainier for ease of use and setup not to mention it cuts down on extra wires and comes in a sleek housing.
![image|498x500](upload://l0nu2DEhoZOWoIeoekjVHPLtYC5.jpg)

(This thing is just sick. **LONG LIVE ESK8!**)

Now for the **REMOTE* I felt there wasn't as much quality stuff out there considering products like the Focbox and to save some money using a coupon code on DIY when buying the DDs I was probably just going to get the **Torqueboards 2.4GHZ Nano**. I'm completely open to cheaper and more durable ones but this was probably the piece of hardware I did the least of my research on **so send me your thoughts**. Don't need my remote dropping signal in the middle of a ride so that I can attempt to slip n slide on some concrete. 
![5334B8F5-8A31-41AA-9349-E2C1E027B710|690x459](upload://zykHzuGpwtRPvBk1ITAAVis3MVt.jpeg) 

Finally on to **CABLES**. I'll need **2 esc sensor wire adapters** as the Unity is **2mm** 

![TB%20Sensor%20Wire%20Adapter|690x460](upload://adu5SZn8kcEMPFF1oqqCnQCnxxt.jpeg) 
(Planning on getting them from DIY when I buy the DD system from them)

Also If I end up getting the **12s4p battery from DIY** I know it's connector is **xt90** so I will need a **xt90 to xt60** adapter for the Unity

![xt90%20to%20xt60%20Adapter|690x460](upload://b63bxHdxlGBgNV9JqDRTMhceVpk.jpeg) 

(Also this may be a newbie question but **which end will be male and which will be female?** And do you guys **recommend a specific adapter** or will a hobby shop one do the job?) 

I know the Motor Cables on the TB DD are **5.5mm** bullet connectors while the Focbox has **3.5mm** (**UPDATE 05/05/19 @BigZwatt is selling me some adapters he has lying around straight MVP status**)

![5%20Bullet%20Adapter|666x500](upload://7bbXiivlXcBaCwGbVqJ1u9TCDj.jpeg)  

Lastly I'll ask you guys about **ENCLOSURES**. So if I get the **12s4p battery** it will come with it's own enclosure and from the dimensions and talking to the guys at DIY my unity should fit in here as well? But if you guys had other **battery recommendations** I'd like to also know what enclosures you would recommend with those other batteries. (**UPDATE 05/05/19 Going to see if @psychotiller can hook me up with a custom battery and enclosure** :pray:t3:) 

**_EDIT 05/7/19_** Won't need an enclosure with the Haya but still planning to have psychotiller moch me up a batter for it.)

So with all that said **what other cables do I need** and am I missing anything else in my build? What tips do you guys have on mounting the enclosure to the board including anything from weatherproofing to heat sync for the unity? **What do you guys think of the build idea?** Long post but I thought I'd do it proper and be as thorough as possible after I've learned so damn much from you all. The sooner you guys can help me the better because I want to be on the next order batch for the **TB DDs** setup knowing full well I may not have everything delivered until late summer or so.

Is that battery single stacked cells? From memory the dropcarve doesn't have a lot of space so a single stacked 10s4p may take up the entire available space?
Edit, skip that. I see that the battery is double stacked so should be good.

I wouldn't go with DD because there is no way to change the gearing for speed/torque.

So this leaves you to: Surfrodz TKP for carving, RKP for speed, With Bergemeister wheels.

Or a complete drive train from @riverside.rider Timo. The shipping is crazy fast and QC is top notch.

Or get upcoming @moon drives, gear drives for SR TKP.

I get why I can't change the gearing on a DD but do you think that would be something I'd hate? Keep in mind this is my first setup in esk8 and from what I have learned these DDs hit all the sweet spots for me. This was the only part I am feeling set on but I did ask for recommendations so please don't take any offense. I'm not very heavy and Houston is pretty flat in most areas. Doesn't the Focbox have an efficient auto detect system that sets the proper voltage for these motors? I was under the impression I could modify my speeds that way in the Focbox app.

Also urethane is never as comfortable as pneumatics so consider that.

If something breaks on DD, most likely the whole drive train will have to be sent to the seller. If something brakes on belt/gear drive, just change the broken part

This is true and I had the same philosophy of thinking when it came to the Unity but I felt the pros of the unity really outweighed the cons. As far as gear drives I'd have to go back to doing some research as I had settled on the DDs from TB :thinking:

I really like urethane.  I think you have a good plan and you have obviously been reading.


I do like the idea of the unity+DD.  Such an easy setup procedure.

I wouldn't worry about the gearing and all of that as you can manipulate that a bit with motor controller settings, and based off what you said, I think you will be more than pleased with what the DD will give you.

I tend to lean toward 12s these days.  Build a board you can grow into, not one that merely meets your needs today.  You will want MORE very quickly.


With regard to batteries, that must be chosen in tandem with the enclosure to ensure proper fitment.  Enclosure wise, I bet @psychotiller has a selection you could work with.  While you are at at, get him to make you a custom pack to fit in said enclosure. 


Look forward to seeing your progress!

 These were my thoughts exactly it's practically plug and play with a little fiddling and a little bit of mounting for the enclosure.  Really appreciate your feedback and I already know @psychotiller makes some amazing stuff it's all over the forums. I'll hit him up to see what he thinks!

With the focbox Unity, if you change the bullet connectors to match your direct drive connectors you will void the warranty. 

Edit, nevermind you said it comes with adapters.

## \#17 Posted by: DJase Posted at: 2019-05-05T03:42:23.833Z Reads: 217

Now I'm almost certain that the unity doesn't come with the 3.5mm to 5.5mm bullet adapters. I wasn't able to confirm it through the post I'm going to link and starting with this post it seems highly unlikely:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/focbox-unity-support-setup-troubleshooting/77861
and this one:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/focbox-3-5mm-bullet-connector-to-5-5mm-motor-connector/51033/15

 I wanted to see what people were doing for adapters as changing the 3.5 bullet cables on the unity to 5.5 does void the warranty. Some people seem to not care and do the conversion anyway or are making adapters. I'm not sure what to do as I was trying to avoid soldering and definitely don't want to void the warranty which I'm planning to purchase . If anyone makes short 3.5 to 5.5mm cables that would be perfect or even just the bullet connectors themselves in adapter form. I guess if i have to bust out my old soldering gun I can, this is a DIY after all :poop:

I did close to 18 months of stealing info and not contributing a damn thing :joy:
You have a good plan there and some very well thought out choices for a first toe in the water.  @Sender said it best so no more to add but adaptors for 3.5 to 5mm are an easy thing and there is a thread about it.  The 3.5 and 5 actually fit inside one another so soldering is a breeze.
Good luck and keep us all posted on progress.

@DJase just want to throw my two cents in. I love that you are going with DD, Because it's my absolute favorite, but only once I design my own eventually. I do believe rt now that they are way to expensive for what they are atm. Not modular or easy to work on. But if you go with the DDs why not go with double everything and make it a nice 4x4. You'll climb anything and the feel of all wheels rolling underneath your feet is a smooth one. Gotta love the landyach too. My favorite decks. But also haya has a beautiful integrated deck you could try out maybe.

Took my old drop carve out today just to get a feel for the board again. She still cruises but I'm excited to run it drop through again. I need to take measurements to see if it will have clearance for the DDs and enclosure. When I switched to my higher quality setup I run now I switched the drop carve to top mount just for something different. My girl actually got the deck for my birthday 4 or so years ago. She's a keeper. 

![image|374x500](upload://sskmLDl8NuFPG46p0Jj2Pqs0hpR.jpeg) 

BTW I've actually had the 40 inch and not the 37 this whole time :upside_down_face: so I guess more real estate for parts haha.

I know you were already thinking it but no I do not have an obsession with koi fish my girl just had no idea what to get me when she bought it. It turned into a really smooth setup though.

So I was inspecting my old Landy after removing the old grip tape and noticed a pretty sizable crack developing from top to bottom of the board near the front base plate mounts inwards towards the body. This has me reconsidering using this board knowing the abuse it will eventually go through and has already gone through over the years. So i'm considering some other boards without pushing my budget too hard. 

That being said I'm looking at the Haya HB92 and seriously considering putting myself on the second round pre orders. It would be extremely nice to have a board like this and make my setup even cleaner and I really love the design kudos to @bevilacqua. You already know I'll be letting @sender get his hands on it for somethign really special if I go this route (still going with a Koi theme). So my questions are;

- How is the ride feel on these board? maybe @sofu can chime in. 
- How concave is the design, does it keep you locked in well? I'll be going with a glass frit on top. 
- How about custom batteries for this? I did some research on the NESE system but not sure about a 12S design but I love that Idea no solder packs amazing! I thought hey I can do that lol
- Lastly since I'll be putting the TB DDs on here with the 110 thane wheels do you guys think I'll have any wheelbite concerns? 
 As always really appreciate the collective imput from you guys. I'm DOING THE DAMN THING!

It's a stiff deck that's relatively wide. You can set it up nicely topmounting it with nice downhill trucks. I expect it would ride similarly to the recurve. Personally now that I've ridden my build for a while I wouldn't necessarily do brackets if I were to do it over again. It looks great but the ride feel is not so good imo...

But if you go with the DDs why not go with double everything and make it a nice 4x4

Totally agreed. I just love 4x4 so I'm always going to suggest it. And I know I could build a 4x4 for less than $1800 maybe not with the DDs and the focbox. but definitely could be done with $1800.

Good research and list, given your experience with thane a beefy DD from TB with 110s make lots of sense. You can adapt to pnummie if your knees demand it, although I believe those big thane wheels are cushions

The only other option which may have been a more like for like is the Hummie drive option with 83mm, they are sold out at the moment but I think there are one or two sets for sale here in the market sub, worth considering as they are jewels and may suit an analog skater the best

The Hummie hubs feels like regular skating.  It really is a different type of experience. When I am on my lacroix with gear drives, it feels and sounds like a raw and powerful machine, on the hummies it just feels like skating with no need to push.


Both are awesome and definitely have a place, but someone wanting a more "traditional skating experience " will get nothing better than Hummie Hubs.

The hummies are the only hubs I had considered because it seemed to be the only hubz that could handle the heat issue with large stators but I just couldn't get over the thin thane as I have been a thane king forever. I've never been on 110mm maybe the smaller popcappas in the past but I've also never been above 25 mph on a board so I welcome the extra thane. I've now officially spent more on this setup than my first car.......worth

Oh and when I spoke to a DIY rep before buying they informed of the revisions for batch 2 of the DDs

- Added an additional cir-clip for the big bearing.
- Motor Temperatures work now due to a fix on the internal hall sensor pcb.
- New DDR Trucks removed part of it due to cir-clip needing extra room.
- Axles now have a 12mm shoulder, 25mm length + 11mm thread (just in-case)
- All Trucks and Truck parts switched to [6061](tel:6061)-T6 Aluminum vs [7075](tel:7075).

Not sure if this was common knowledge because I haven't read it on the forums but all welcome additions as the only problems I have really read from people were bearing fit issues due to filing or QC control on a few when assembled. 

Also I suspect they went with the weaker 6061 Aluminum because of higher heat transfer at 170 W/m-K to 130 W/m-K on 7075 Aluminum. It's also cheaper. good call IMO

Nice one! You will love it! :+1:

Heat transfer looks good on the first batch 7075 DDs though. A few minutes after a ride my hanger is hotter than the motor cans.

I have the DD @75kv @110mm @12s, the Unity and the same remote. DD is awesome, Unity great aside a small bug (full throttle at standstill leads to cutouts, they looking into it), remote looks and feels like crap but its ultra reliable and a good choice for a first build imo.

I'm guessing (all estimates from pictures) the brackets add ~5" to the wheelbase each and the deck has around 32" originally. So it becomes ~42" wheelbase? For my height and weight that might work well.

**Edit:** I think it might work well because I love my 42" loaded vanguard, but just realized that's not 42" wheelbase (that's deck length), the wheelbase is 35" and I use Caliber IIs there. 42" wheelbase + super wide trucks and deck might not be ideal. I guess I will find out soon :smiley:

Well I'm just paper talking here. 30T is rated 35A continuous so it's better. VTC6 is 15A continuous, 30A burst on paper. Don't forgot there's also 40T that does 20-25A continuous. 
So if you are going to long hill climb on a 2p config, probably 30T or 40T. On a 3p you can probably do with VTC6 and 30Qs.

You can search up batterymooch test results for better accurate info.

That size + 3mm since the V2 design has a deeper Truck-recess. Stefan designed it for his 105mm rubber wheels. 

Try to quick-print a few with +- 2-3 mm height to select the one that fits you best. I would suggest printing the final one in Flexible TPU to add some dampening.

I'm lifting the rough outline of the koi from my old board with a transparent adhesive like vinyl that I can trace over in sharpie. I'll then take this to a scanner where I'll have the full sized file to take over to photo shop. I also started on a logo but everything is in rough concept still.
