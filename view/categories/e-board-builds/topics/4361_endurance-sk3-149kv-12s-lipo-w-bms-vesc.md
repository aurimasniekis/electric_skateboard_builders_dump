Better start this now then later. I've been waiting to have the build finished to post this, but it's taking much much **MUCH** longer than expected. Let this serve as a build log.

**Parts:**

[Spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vQ3o2GKBRS66HIwjSpkVhf9Ht6CfUAMcillX_qowKd0/edit?usp=sharing)

**Design:**
I have drawn up multiple variants, all that will contribute to the final design:

**Wiring:**

Also, I should mention that everything here (along with more detailed explanations) are on [my blog.](http://diyelectriclongboard.blogspot.com/)

**Calculations:**
[Included in spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vQ3o2GKBRS66HIwjSpkVhf9Ht6CfUAMcillX_qowKd0/edit?usp=sharing)

**Current Status:**
I'm waiting for on a VESC.

**Comment with suggestions/questions!**

2 things. DIY doesn't have Paris truck options for the mount you linked. And, you might want to get a wider belt if you're running single motor. 9mm may snap when hard accelerating or braking.

Looks very nice! I have a few questions on the topic of enclosures:
1) what abs sheet do you use? (thickness)
2) how long do you keep it in the oven and at what temperature?
Thanks!

What happened that caused this? 
Do you have a multimeter? Clean the BMS using alcohol  and test the leads of the FET with a multimeter...

Do not plug your battery whitout testing the FET.... it is also very important to clean the carbonization, it can be conductive and short other things....

Clumsiness caused a short.
I have a multimeter, and I tested the output and got a reading. I also tested the MOSFETs around the short area and they don't seem to be broken. I cleaned everything.

Edit: BMS Still works great.

@link5505 great video and setup!  Sorry to hear/see the short - what happened to cause it?

Do you mind sharing more detail on the BMS you used here?  There are several similar i've seen on eBay and curious which you found works well!  

Fingers crossed it works perfectly still.

Thanks man!  That's the exact BMS i was looking at.

That charger is *beefy*!  i thought a lot of folks were charging w/ laptop sized power supplies and barrel plug connection (vs the XLR you have).  Besides higher amps to charge more quickly - any particular reason to go with such a big power supply?

where are you located?  i might have a spare VESC you could borrow if needed.

Vacuum formed the enclosure and spent 4 hours sanding/dremeling it to (somewhat) perfection. I've been coating it in black plastidip every once in awhile. I would take a picture but my dad would shoot me if I turned off the alarm system and went into the garage right now. Tomorrow.

It looks decent, but there is some uneven surfaces because of the vacuum forming. You can see where my dad messed up in the video.
I sanded it to hell and back and dremeled a lot. It's not perfect but certainly gets the job done. I've been coating it with plastidip once every hour.

I have not endorse any product or vendor.
 ( not that I have anything against any vendor ), I think that the vendors should have a review feature so the customer can put their opinion on the products and services on their site and not do it unilaterally.

I'm having an odd phenomenon with my BMS/LiPos, if anyone could help that would be great.

6 of the 12 cells are stuck at 3.8v, while the rest charged to 4.2v just fine. What could be the cause of this?

I will probably just open up the pack and desolder and balance them individually, but it would be nice to know why the BMS isn't balancing them.

Motor and motor regen are a bit high. You may want to drop it down to 60 and go up if you need it. That high of a regen might make the brakes a bit too strong. Try 50-60 first and adjust as needed.

Battery cut off start I'd recommend 3.3v per cell (39.6v). Right now you have it at 3.5v per cell. This is important since your voltage will sag while riding which might cause it to trip the cut off. I end the cut off at 3.2v per cell.

You didn't accommodate for the max current ramp glitch. Default value is .04, but you have to input .004 and write config. After writing the glitch will multiply it by 10x and make it the default of .04. You have to do this EVERY time you write config in the motor config tab. This isn't a problem in @elkick's BLDC tool.

Any pics of your app config tab?

You can use PID speed control or duty cycle, though I don't recommend it. PID will set the motor to a target eRPM depending on throttle position. However, that means if you let go and coast, it'll slow you down to match neutral speed (0). Duty cycle is voltage control, and is what most hobby ESCs use, I haven't tried it myself though.

Sorry I meant I don't recommend PID for the reason I gave. I'm not sure about duty cycle, but a lot of people run that since they use regular hobby ESCs.

Vedder himself said he uses current because it feels more natural, and I like the feel of it myself. I imagine it gives you the best response when accelerating and braking. Since you're controlling current, you can send a command to release a lot of current for more rapid acceleration by just throttling higher. With duty cycle, the command you send is not to increase current, but to increase voltage and current will be supplied on variable load. I believe this will lead to more sluggish acceleration and braking response, but like I said, haven't used it myself.

I don't have any heatshrink that fit the hangar so I just wrapped it in electrical tape.. not holding up very well.

I'll try red loctite on the big screws aswell.

Another problem I'm having is that the motor tension comes loose way too easily. I've tightened all 4 screws very tightly with loctite, which was a mistake because I ended up stripping one of the screws. I managed to get it out when the mount was hot after riding.

I want to add a permanent tension, is it even possible?

be careful with red loctite. You may end up stripping it if you want to remove and and getting it stuck in there. I use blue loctite and everything's super solid. Using a similar grub screw to yours (came with enertion mount) and I just blue loctited and torqued it up. Make sure you leave it for a day and don't ride it to cure.

I've also added 2xM6 set screws on the clamp. For the motor mount clamp, you could use an M5 Lock Nut as well.

Unfortunately, there's only 2 bolt holes for the motor mount. Tried tons of ways to fix the clamp so that way I could at least get 3 bolt holes in but no go :frowning: Should be perfectly fine though. Both parts are made in 7075 Aluminum.

I've been experiencing a few cutouts here in there, I'm thinking it is the receiver because it is right next to the VESC. I ordered some ferrite rings, gonna see if they solve the problem.

If virtual reality is something gamers need to do atleast once, esk8 is something all skateboards and longboards need to do aswell.

I just went on a 30 minute night ride, and boy, this board is exhillerating. I haven't had this much fun in awhile.

Funny thing, I rode by some kids and they yelled, "BOOSTED BOARD!!!" and I just shook my head... little do they know...

I went 7.48 miles and still have 56% battery left. Amazing.

For my Enertion mount, I relied too much on my grub screw and it became loose and wobbly on both mounts. Luckily, nothing fell off so I loosened the grub screw a bit and really torqued down the main bigger screws; like **really** torqued them down. Both mounts have been as solid as rock so far.

PS. it should go without saying that I applied loctite every time.

Yes it will still spark inside the switch and eventually fail from an acculation of carbon, when i say fail i mean not work anymore. Or heat up and melt.

But that migth take some time to happen, i'm sure it will work for a while.

[quote="mason, post:183, topic:4361, full:true"]

That won't work, the switch is a one stage connection. The xt90 for example is a 2 stage connection, first stage is with a series resistor for changing the caps and the second stage is the bulk connection that shorts out the resistor

I haven't used a switch like that.. It should work though.

I tell you what someone needs to design, a resistor that diminishes over time to 0 ohms so that when you first plug it in it resists enough to not spark but then after a few moments goes 0 ohm and allows plenty current...

Right, but an inductor will resist the inrush of current at first. The resistance then decays to very low (DCR). Granted it will probably be a very short decay time (depending on the inductance value) but isn't that what is desired? Just long enough to prevent sparking?

Hi Guys,

Don't worry, it's not rust. It's a copper coating that's showing.
The motor casings are usually chromed and in order for the chrome to stick well, a copper layer is etched on to the drum first.

That said, you do seem to be grounding out a lot judging by all that scuffing to the motor and mount too.

Guess you've been doing some grinds or whatever they're called :slight_smile:

I would have waited to expand my budget. By cheaping out on many parts towards the beginning of this project, it sent me towards a downwards spiral of debt. Go with higher quality and trusted parts, rather than trying to save a few bucks.

I hated every second of dealing with LiPo batteries, and they are what have caused the death of this board. Go Li-Ion for the long run.

I should have invested in better quality tools to build. For example, my soldering iron. Also, LEARN how to use your tools before you screw up like I did in a few instances.
