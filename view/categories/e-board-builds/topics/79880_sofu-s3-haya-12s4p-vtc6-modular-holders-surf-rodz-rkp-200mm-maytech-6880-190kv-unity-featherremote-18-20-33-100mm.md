Hi guys, first time doing a build thread for one of my builds. I've done a couple builds before but nothing really worth documenting, so here goes the first one hopefully worth documenting...

Parts list:

* HAYA from @bevilacqua sold to me by @uigiroux
* 12s4p VTC6 pack made using @Winfly's modular cell holders, customized for HAYA by the man himself
* Surf Rodz rkp 200mm
* Boa 100mm white
* G|Bomb SDF and DD
* Mounts from @marcmt88
* Press fit truck mounts from @lrdesigns
* FOCbox Unity from @onloop, @Deodand, & co
* Bestech d140 BMS
* FeatherRemote with advanced receiver from @StefanMe
* Bright white and red 12v LED strip lights from some generic Amazon brand

Got almost all the parts I'm going to use, so here are some pictures:

Yeah vtc5a all the way if you need hight discharge cells.
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/sony-vtc6-for-3-5-a-piece/75732/26?u=andy87

The vtc6 has a capacity loss of around 10% after 50 charge cycles.

I have read that too but I think the biggest variant of that test and real world application is you will never and should never draw 15A continuous for that long especially when you have 4+p. And drawing to 2.5V and 80C is insane.  If you are at that battery voltage and temperature you should consider double stacking your battery. But I will still say that 30Q does retain more capacity just not as much at 5-6% in that test in 50 cycles. Many of us use, 3.3/3v cutoff or 3/2.8v cutoff. So I wouldn't be concern about the capacity difference that much unless that's your only board and you ride everyday til it dries.


Bought those VTC6 from the jehu sale $700 for 200 unwrapped and unused cells. I got a bunch so if anyone wants some and don't wanna get 200pop, I can sell them to you.

That’s true. Just wanted to point out that the extra price for the vtc6 (if you buy them regular) over cells like 30q is in my eyes not worth it to pay. As @sofu choose them because it’s more cheap to get for her, I think there is nothing to say about the choice.

I routed it exactly as you see there in the last pic. I have a modified boosted riser between the gbomb bracket and deck in the back. It's got built in cable routing, just had to cut a bit more for more phase wires allowance.

> 47" as of right now… :grimacing: Hopefully it’ll have a unique ride feel!

This build is looking good. :ok_hand: Is in my ballpark! You, Q.v. Huynh and me, are the only ones in this forum (that I'm aware off) attempting mounting bracket builds. I like that type of reasoning. You find a good all-in 1  integrated enclosure deck yourself with 0° horizontal mounting holes, add some nice mounting brackets of your liking, some good old fatty wheels and a couple trucks to play them along with the brackets and wish all comes nice and easy with the feel and ride, hopefully.

The idea is to gain some real estate with the brackets extending the wheel base under your feet with the trucks positioned further ahead & back getting a sizable longboard out of a compact short deck. LDP world coming to Esk8!!

Make sure those G | Bomb brackets are the right choice, remember the trucks like to behave differently under those. Normally, depending on the angle, the truck swivel incredibly side to side, thus the pumping. They may become incredibly lose and not suitable for our needs. So, lots of trial and testing with those.

Q.v. Huynh's own bracketed Predator Banshee... :point_down:

![FB_IMG_1541662526736|375x500](upload://oZO0NMFwt7kg6AS03hRdK9QW4oA.jpeg) 

![FB_IMG_1541662511498|375x500](upload://xyASYan2XIt410xXJYYFB96wJr4.jpeg)

My own @257 custom made brackets... :point_down:

![IMG_20180928_165731|281x500](upload://cwQVA6g1wmyjKU0qnWMszUE8GPQ.jpeg)

In our case, we opted for 0° horizontal brackets instead your typical LDP bent angled brackets. Angled brackets are more for pumping so theres some risk there. Testing is the key. Is an unexplored territory.

The cells are shrink wrapped with thick heatshrink, it's just transparent. The wires are also spaced by the holders which have wire routes to run them through, so I think it should be ok...

Is a great idea. The Haya and the Predator Banshee are two of the most ideal candidates for this type of build. Both come with integrated enclosures (a plus) and 0° horizontal mounting holes to install those brackets. I'm still not sure which deck I'll have. If I don't get the custom made [1166 Longboards](https://www.1166longboards.com) LDP deck by 2019 first semester then will go with a custom carbon LDP [Cobo Boards](https://www.facebook.com/coboboards/) or a [Predator Banshee](https://ridepredator.com/shop/predator-banshee-beta-model/).

That looks really good. 

I notice you have the idlers on the bottom. You might want to mount them on top for when you are braking the belt will have the load on the top. 

The rear base plate is slightly off center too. 

And for skatan sakes woman cut them mount screws down on your build. It would look a lot better.

Great feedback! I actually have dual idlers now and realigned the back so it's all good! You're right about the screws, I overshot to begin with cause when I was buying them at the hardware store I didn't know how long I needed. I'll go get new screws sometime, it's only a block away after all

This ballance wire looked like it might get pinched by the screw heads, or are they flush with the orange plastic?

I'm going to try to wait it out for a while and see if maybe just maybe they'll show up sometime between now and the end of the month.  I really want to build my HAYA with some G-Bombs as well.

Nice build so far but I fear the 12S4P pack will be underwhelming for the 6380 motors. I am doing a dual 6384 setup with a custom made 12s3p lipo pack which will provide enough juice from the start till the very last end.

They're 6880 motors not 6380 as well. There's tons of power! I get wheelspin taking off from a dead stop, and I'm scared to go above 30 even though it's now geared for 50something mph...

Mounts fit pretty well, though no matter how much I tighten down the axle with the spacers to press it in, I can't get rid of the gap between the truck and the inside of the mount... Maybe I need to go buy a rubber mallet after all... I do have a spacer between the pulley and mount. One red one (the one that comes with the surfrodz). Using evolve's 33t kegel pulley.

It's pretty durable stuff, especially for protecting the places you won't be standing on all the time. It's used on car wheels and even on whole cars. Best part is that it stays put until you want to remove it, then it peels off completely clean like a big rubber sticker. Prep work and building up a thick enough layer are key to this stuff lasting a long time.

Hmm, maybe the axle is bottoming out before it pushes all the way in? You can check by putting the axle on with no spacers, measure the exposed axle, then your spaces need to be 5 to 8mm longer than that to get full compression.

If not, I would not worry about it, so long as they are tight on the hanger.

That's a good point that I didn't think of when I bought it, though this looks a lot less "metaly" than the stainless steel one. I think I would still get the stainless steel one if I were to do it over again...

Yeah you're right if you just pull both straight, but nylon can withstand 1000x more bends than steel, just take piece of it, wiggle back and forth, you'll make the strands break fairly soon, repeat with nylon, you probably will spend hours and nothing...

But ok ok, you want shiny, steel sleeve is fine xD

If you're using steel sheaths but you need to move wires you can glue tiny craft neodymium magnets into the deck and the sheaths will stay there unless moved, but don't do it to sensor wires.  We use it for robotics occasionally

I thought these 6880's have the same stator as 6374's, its just they have an extra large front side bearing and sealed case which makes them more durable?

@sofu how do they feel compared to other 6374's ?
```

## \#187 Posted by: sofu Posted at: 2019-01-22T06:50:11.540Z Reads: 439

I think it's hard to give an informed opinion because i haven't tried both motors on the same setup so there're too many factors that vary, but comparing Kaly 6374 vs Maytech 6880, 6880 is definitely stronger. They're also super quiet on my focbox unity, but that may be because the switching frequency is different than vesc6 default. Again, there're too many factors different for me to make a direct comparison... But if I had to pick I'd go for the 6880s
```

---
## \#188 Posted by: lrdesigns Posted at: 2019-01-22T06:55:14.518Z Reads: 432

I would assume the big front bearing makes them run smoother than most motors and therefore quieter. If the can has a good balance they should have zero vibration.

It’s pretty awesome I really love it. I was gonna buy one then asked @Winfly offhandedly if he wanted one and he said yes so that’s why we’re both rocking them right now 😆 originally I saw @Aeroquiv rocking it on his ollin and really liked it so I considered getting it

@Jc06505n you have to take the Bluetooth module off if you want to use the internal tx/rx.

I connected Metr to the external uart port, and the tx and Rx of feather to the internal TX Rx pairs. counting from the top left on the “internal” header, pin 7/14 are rx/tx, 10/11 are rx/tx

You will need to ask for the firmware, unsure if he will be willing to let you try it but... 🤷🏻‍♀️

Hey @sofu, so I'm arriving at the conclusion that I will need these g-bomb brackets on my incoming HAYA build because otherwise it doesn't look like the deck can clear wheels easily. Even at 90mm there are reports of wheelbite on full turn. I plan to use larger wheels.

Instead of getting a deep drop for the rear and the super duper fork for the front do you think 2 x super duper fork would work? They are 13 degrees so I was thinking to match them with the 35 degrees RKP Surfrodz and that would make it similar (48 degrees) to running 50 degrees Surfrodz. I wonder if you thought about this and if you think this would work. Thanks!

I have the DDR bracket and DDS bracket on hand and I have dickyho long and short mounts on order. I did a mock up of the mounts on the brackets with some paper and it looks like both mounts should fit but clearance is tight. I ordered some Gbomb riser pads as well if it doesn't have enough clearance. I will update you with pics when the mounts arrive if you like. I believe that the bracket that @sofu has are the SDR not the DDS.
