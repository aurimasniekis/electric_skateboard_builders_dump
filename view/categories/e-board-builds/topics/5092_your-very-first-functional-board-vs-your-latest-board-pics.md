So the title says it all everyone post your very first functioning Eboard in they're roughest of forms. I'm talking like when they first started working before you cleaned them up and made them pretty. We all obviously had design flaws in our first designs but that's part of this so post your first rideable Eboard. 

Along with that post your most recent board with all the bells and whistles to show us how far you've come in personal design! 

If your first Eboard looks like something out of a playboy magazine we all know you're lying.

I'll start, I obviously made it look a lot nicer after proof of concept! I started eboarding almost 2 years ago.

Damn, that first one was rough looking. Lol. But you clean up real nice!

@barajabali I guess I'm gonna have to work on finishing up the latest pretty versions. I've been experimenting and tinkering so much that they don't look a whole lot better than when I started, at least in their current states. But, I do have two ugly boards instead of one now. Does that count? :smile:

Not so fast... i'm STILL paying on credit card debt for that shit. I went through 4 flier clone ESCs in that loud and obnoxious metal box, a dozen high amp switches, god knows how many screws rattled out, two sets of motors, and had to wait two months while Hong Kong searched my lipo pack for smuggled birds. Ask @onloop how many times i emailed him back in 2014. He'll probably just stare off into space as he recalls what a wretched customer i was. How else could i have forced him into an alliance? I tormented the man until he caved. 

You guys know i have a day job, right? and a toddler? There's no trump here man. Just dedication. I guess my marketing strategy worked lol

Certainly meant no disrespect with the Trump comment. It was more to say that your first build looked like a million bucks. It had nothing to do with the fact that it looks somewhat presentable, and fancy on the outside, but is really all fucked up inside and a mess of faulty components. :laughing:

But back on topic, here is my first complete...

my very first board was a dual rear topspeed with shrink-tube enclosure, that was attached to the board with rubber tubes:

shortly after I made a proper enclosure from 2mm carbon sheets

then i build my tesseract with the same kind of enclosure:

finally started vacuum bagging and routing into the boards to end up with a really solid looking tesseract and vanguard:

```
The power, even with only 4S and 19/30 gearing was good (average top speed on flat 21 km/h. so not fast). The only bad thing about the SK3 is that I don't really think that it's bearings are really made for ground use, as it's an airplane motor. it has 5 bearings in total and the axle ones are really tiny, so they are not probably made for high amplitude, high frequency vibrations that are present when running on older asphalt. That particular SK3 in the pictures has racked up more then 1000 km and the bearings are pretty much dead. They are also pretty annoying to switch out for new ones, which can be bought from HobbyKing as a replacement set for ~17 euros.

I am planning to test AlienPowerSystem's 6355 130 kV sensored motor, as it seems to be just a much more neat package overall. Bearings are bigger and are more easily changeable. Overall construction makes more sense for esk8 use. I have already ordered the motor and their motor mounting parts, so I can move away from the 3D-printed design. Price wise it's also at the same level as the SK3.

I also want to test ollinboards' motor, so I can then do some educated choices between future motor suppliers.

Same size, but mine was the 130 kV one (you corrected it).

If you're going for a single motor setup, you might as well go with the 6374 size. And then depending on your planned battery voltage, gearing and wheel size, choose between different kV options to get your speed in the ballpark.

The shopowner is Bruno,

Really great guy and has a very good support service. Will take 3-4 days probably to get to you. (i'm from Belgium) 
Would recommend. 
Think the 130 Kv is better, 240 kv is a little bit too much for 10s with vesc.
I think 170-190Kv would be good aswell.

I posted here some time ago just the picture of my first board, but now I have picture of the second version, which is already a year old, dead and disassembled to give place to the third version

In this first version I fell pretty bad two time due to receiver disconnecting due to vibrations and no protection whatsoever from the road 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/2/f2cc07fdb592b300b61c411068c4e8599ae880e3.JPG" width="333" height="500">

And now my second baby that died when I accidentally shorted it just when I had found out what was wrong using a scope borrowed from teacher, which I almost killed together with the board 

In these pictures she was still using some cheap wheels that have been upgraded to kegels later and a HTD 3M belt that only gave me headache, but the low drag was amazing

And just a sneak peek on what's to come, almost all parts ready to assemble

Your designs are very interesting to say the least

I pre first "build" was just swapping over and just taping cheap Acton Blink board parts to a Penny Longboard to get a feel of a long esk8. I was hooked at the smoothness of an electic longboard after that.

Thanks to Enertion's one stop shop at the time I put together my official first built that was a blast to ride. That board has been sold for parts with the exception of the battery cells (turned into a 10s3p by Barajabali) and that CF deck.

I was able to get my hands on a cheap broken Raptor 1 and fixed it. Loved the deck/enclosure so much that I got another Raptor deck for my current build which will be with the Carvon V3s. So sadly I will just look like I have a off the shelf Boosted and two Raptors on my wall. No Franken Board here

First very low budget proof of concept (actually at the really beginning the board was just a piece of scrap wood)

My first board in its first rideable state:
![image|375x500](upload://54FDrIgKSe9K586MgMnMWIVRMG2.jpeg)
I fiberglassed the enclosure and it was a 12s4p battery with a single 6374 13/40 ratio on 97s
Now my latest:
![image|374x500](upload://pfwn5SvNZbkrWramMRPjizObkOX.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://dSrsu3PA2rSgufbJy00iAn5aaEx.jpeg)
Since my first build turned into a dual 6374, I wanted something a bit more portable. Vac formed abs enclosure I made, 12s2p on a single 6374 14/40 ratio on 97s

Damn, this thread just restored my confidence in my builds (no offense intended) I'm just happy to see other people taking the long road instead of having a $2000 perfect first build.

I'll be back next week when my latest and greatest is operational, with comparison photos to my early projects of course.
