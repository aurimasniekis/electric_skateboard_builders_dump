So for the past couple of months now I have been doing my research trying to figure out the best setup for me. I live in the on a campus with a lot of hills so right off the back wanted to go with a pully system rather than hub motors because of the more tork, however, I still wanted to have both of my back wheels powered. So instead of two vesc, motors, and everything else. I would just have a one vesc, one motor but two pulleys and gear sets on each of the back wheels the motor I was thinking of using is the alien power C8085 sensored Outrunner brushless motor 250KV 6000W ( Here is the link as well  http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/c8085-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-250kv-6000w/) as for the rest of the build I am going to use a Vesc and a 10s2p li-ion battery that I will be making myself to keep the price down. 

As for my board setup, I am running a 36in bamboo deck with caliber2 44 degree trucks and 80mm orangutang wheels with risers. 

Anyway I think my main question is do u guys think this setup will work and if so where do you think I could find two 80mm motor mounts?

thanks for the help in advance.

How are you gonna bake?  A 10s2p will not give very many amps, therefore sag will be a big deal.

So you will drive both wheels with 1 motor?
edit: Oh I had not seen that motor before, stupid question
btw you know that this is a huge motor? 80mm diameter, think about the ground clearance, I should go for bigger wheels (90mm-...)

Yeah, 10s2p isn't even half of what that motor wants. You're gonna end up with the equivalent of a solid rear axle, no diff, so you're gonna have some weird turning effects. I think you could get away with a 6374 or 6384 and still have more than enough power if you went with a 10s3p or larger.

```
what about rotational difference when turning?

if i'm not mistaken carvon did something with one motor driving two wheels but there's slip to account for rotational difference.

at best one of the wheels in your solid axle rear drive will drag, at worst motor shaft will brake.

You would be better off using a 190kv-200kv 6374 motor with a 10s4p or 5p pack, a 1024p made with Samsung 30Q's should be more than sufficient to give you decent hill climbing ability.

yea i can climb some big ass hills around here with a mono 6374, just use lower gearing (16/36T) with smaller wheels (83 or 90mm) and you should be fine.  back it up with a 10s or 12s, minimum 4p pack. probably wont go full speed up hills but you'll make it up.

only thing is there are very short, intermittent loss in traction, especially on steeper descent.

what you're proposing seems overly complicated with many points of failure.

Take note that a VESC is only rated for about 60A and a max voltage of 12S. With one vesc you will get 60*12*3,7=2600 watts of continuous power. With a larger motor you might still get more torque but you wont get any more power out of it...

If you were to use the dual drive idea you would probably need a differential of some sort to be able to turn around in less than 5 miles...

Those are the same and Yes, that will do nicely. The power ratings on these motors are always best taken with a few pinches of salt anyway, there's no standardized testing method that I know of that they use to determine the maximum output; I think a lot of the numbers came out of someone's ass.

## \#34 Posted by: MysticalDork Posted at: 2017-09-30T05:05:20.792Z Reads: 245

No, that's the nominal voltage, or the average. 18650 batteries have a maximum voltage of 4.2v when fully charged and a minimum voltage of between 2.5 and 3v when fully discharged. Generally when calculating speed etc, you should use the 3.7v number because that's what the board will be running at most of the time, but when the batteries are freshly charged, the voltage is 4.2, and you have to use that number for motor selection because that's the highest number the motor will see.

To have decent turning while accelerating you would need to use one way bearings in the drive Wheels, hence no brakes. It's all been covered here...

This has been discussed before, and I had the idea to use a 0Â° baseplate in the rear (1 motor powering both rear wheels).  With RKP geometry on a 0Â° plate, the truck will lean but does not produce any turn.  I understand the need for a differential in cars, but they have an axle length measured in feet;  a skateboard axle is so much shorter that the difference in speed between the inside and outside rear wheels would probably be negligible on a 0Â° baseplate.  Because once again, it's all lean and no turn.  A 50Â°/0Â° setup still turns because the rear tracks the front, much like a racecar

However I was basically called an idiot and told it would never work.  Because "physics". _Like I'm sure high school physics was very challenging for you, but I have a Master's degree in engineering and still think it might work._ Who's knows? Maybe I really am idiot :joy:  My coworker and some people on here sure thought so!

I am still undecided on how well it would work...

yeah there is some funky physics involved with skateboard motion and turning, not all of it is intuitive. On most other 4 wheel vehicles the outside wheels generate most grip. On a skateboard you can lift the outside wheels off the ground...

## \#43 Posted by: PXSS Posted at: 2017-10-21T04:27:35.900Z Reads: 206

No, it wouldn't. Think about the turning radius wrt the axle length. A car's average turn radius / width is ~3.25 (my fiat can do 2.85, my friends buick park ave can do 3.25, my f150 does 3.69 at worst (according to google)) . That would be equal to less than 3ft turn radius on a board with 10in wide trucks... I dont know about you, but I definitely cannot make a 3ft u turn on a longboard...

A longboard with a fairly short wheelbase of 23.5in, and a 45deg truck angle has a turning radius of 6ft at 10deg of lean.

## \#50 Posted by: Jellybean Posted at: 2017-10-21T21:06:42.026Z Reads: 187

```
It would be exactly like driving with a welded diff. When turning the outside wheel will go its normal path but the inside wheel will hop. This is because of extra energy built up on the from it not spinning. Both wheel get the same amount of energy since they are physically connected, but only the outside wheel can put the energy to the ground smoothly. The inside wheel isn't as smooth because it has the same energy to deliver, but is restricted by traction. The inside wheel axle will bend slightly until it can release the energy as a slip or hop. 

In my opinion it won't be noticeable because you'll never turn as sharp as a car with a welded diff, like @PXSS said. The wheels will probably balance themselves out every time you hit a rock or the road is a little rougher. The hopping will probably only feel like you ran over a small rock at the very most, it shouldn't be too noticeable/obvious.

The regular turn radius of a board is 7ft. 
The car equivalent would be a 50ft turn radius!
100ft to make a u-turn... Plus urethane wheels gave a lot less traction than car tires. It would not be noticeable at all...

5m radius U-turn, 30cm (0.3m) truck width, 90mm (0.09m) wheels, 'locked diff'.

Inner wheel distance = 5 * pi = 15.71m
Outer wheel distance = (5 + 0.3) * pi = 16.65m
Difference = 0.94m = 0.94 / (2 * pi * 0.09/2) rev = 3.32 revolutions (over whole turn)

OR, for every 1m the inside wheel travels the outside wheel must travel 1.06m. 

It doesn't sound too bad in my unqualified opinion. I mean it's not like a car that has a similar turning radius, but much larger track width whereby the outer wheel might have to cover double the distance. But if that was the case why do RC cars have differentials.

THe only advice I can give after shredding 3 buggy diffs is dont use stainless steel.  Use something harder and more resistant ti friction damage.  Steel at a minimum.  Maybe seal the diff and pack with lithium grease?

Not too sure what you are implying.  I know a 0Â° rear works fine on a typical skateboard.. I have a few setups like that.  I just don't know how well it would work with one motor powering both rear wheels on a zero degree plate.  Specifically is the turning radius of the inside rear wheel different from the outside rear wheel?  If it is different, is it significant enough to make a difference on a 0Â° rear?   Probably not

The physics get a little tricky.  With a normal setup, the outside wheels spin faster than the inside ones in a turn.  But on a zero degree plate, the rear does not actually turn.. it only leans.  So maybe the rear wheels are effectively pivoting instead?

An interesting test would be to mount a dual rear drive setup on a 0Â° plate. Then run bluetooth telemetry on both  VESC's and compare RPMs of the left/right wheel during turns

Well... At 45 degrees, you have an even amount of turn to lean. Really the important part is the turn. The more lean, and less turn you have...the less the wheels pivot as well. The closer the wheels stay to on track like a car, the greater the difference in speed between the inside and outside wheel. 

Where as when you have a truck with turn, it points into the turn, making the difference between the inner and outer wheels less...

If single motor doesn't feel right in the 40-60degree baseplate range. It will even more noticeable the inner outer difference the lower your baseplate angles...(higher 70-90 not realistic)

Maybe a torsion truck would help, seems like they turn more than they lean so they would point into the turn more? Might feel weird though and I don't know how it would be with one on the back only

Has anyone actually tried this? Would be nice to hear from someone who actually had a go. I'm going to have a go, I think it could work, I don't think a diff is required due to the short track and no Ackerman, plus the out side wheel is unloaded during a turn and will be able to spin, + it works fine in a go kart!

Itâ€™s been done but I donâ€™t know what happened to it.

So I had a couple of hours in the work shop today, made a proof of concept.
Got to say solid rear axel works fine, I reduced the truck angle and the track, I have more grip in acceleration and breaking and it feels better in cornering especially when on power.
Really happy, if I can make it light enough it makes for a good dual light weight simple set up.

Yes, i know a builder in France who only use this for quad build. Those are real rockets. For having tried it, you donâ€™t feel any difference. But i donâ€™t think he is on this forum.![image|666x500](upload://3PlWKdBeKD6ga5nZhkOptaiIJ8F.jpeg)

thx for share @hiboute ! I doesn't know this new build :blush: I like every picture he post on esk8 (is that right the Lyonnais rider ?)

So are people saying most quad bikes and go carts that have locked rear axles can not turn a corner? Go look on YouTube and join the flat earth society! Not the most efficient way of turning but I can see more advantages better grip much better brakes. the negs wheels dragging on turns wereing out quicker larger turning radius.

All comes down to personal choice what you want to compromise on cost wight grip reliability.  Thereâ€™s no right answer hear as long as it works for you.
