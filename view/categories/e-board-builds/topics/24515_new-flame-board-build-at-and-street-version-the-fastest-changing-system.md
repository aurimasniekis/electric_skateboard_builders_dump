```
I became a Flame Board and want build to a electric AT Board with Gearbox.
I have build the Gearbox about over 2 years ago.
In first time i using the Gearbox on MOBO :confounded:
Afte a time i have testing a Trampa Board and i think 
that the Gearbox was better with a Trampa.
But i read in some topic that the trucks can break.
Then i read from Flame Boards!
There was a little MTB producer in Germany, and the Decks and trucks
was handmade in Germany.
the advantage is by the Flame trucks, that wen the axis from the Wheels
was breaking or crooked, you must not by a new truck, you just have to change the bolt
one witch was the Wheel mounted.
The system convinced me very much
And then I started to build.

I have considered how I get the Gearbox on the truck.
Building an adapter for the truck was too big
It does not work because of the Motor.
So i think i build the adapter for the bolt, but then i must make the bolt bigger 
so i must make the truck smaller.

```
The bolt was out 7075 Aluminium, and i think it was better i make the new adapter
out one peaces.
So i buy a rod Aluminium 7075 30mm and milling a new and longer bolt adapter.

By the original bolts was the wheel axle out the same Aluminium.
So i think it was better when the axle was out stainless steel.
So i milling one stainless steel axle for the Aluminium bolt.

```
Where I finished with the new adapter the idea came to me
What if I do the same but with 8mm axis for street wheels 
But for that I need for the front axle also a bolt with 8mm axle.
I have the 12mm axis cut off and make a new axle of stainless steel in 8mm
And inserted into the bolts
So i have an adapter for street wheels on the same system.
I can change the bolt with two screws wit the wheels what was mounted
on the bolts.

For the first test i must make a truck shorter, so that was the same with the front trucks,
this test i make in first with a raw truck.

The Trucks works not with steel spring and dampas 
there was rubber bucks mounted.
You became 3 sizes to the trucks, so you can change witch hardness you want.
The Quality from the trucks was very high and robust.
When you look, trampa trucks cost per pieces 75 GB pound that was 100.-€ x2 = 200.-€
then you must pay 3% Paypal and 20.-€ shipping so you are by trampa by 226.-€
and in last time you hear often that the trucks from trampa breaks.
So you buy the truck from Flame you can make from one truck two systems.
We working on this, thats the modified trucks cost the same price.
The material cost for the new bolts was not more higher than the original bolts,
And the working cost was a little bit higher, because the milling machine must
working longer time but thats not much higher.
And when you brake the axis from the bolts you can buy a new bolt for ca. 25.-€
and not a new truck

Sorry i forget,
when you want the springs by trampa in color than thats cost 5 pound extra.
and the dampas cost extra too when you buy 3 hardness you must pay.
The original Springs in steel was after one season rusty.

When i think that a evolve board cost 2250.-€ and you must pay 50% from Paypal fee 
and i don't know how mutch was the shipping but i think round about 2300.-€
Then you became for this a Board what have small motors without enough power.
and too small trucks for AT no foot links and not the range what they write.
I hope I can make with this one cheaper system with more power and every buddy
that wants have can build this system under his MTB board.

How are you going to prevent the motor mounts from slipping from the trucks? I know you will use just a bolt to hold it but according to my experience that's never enough

The street version have 90mm Wheels wheel pulley have 36 T and the motor pulley have 14T
The Battery what i want build was a sanyo 20700 cells and 10S/5P wit 37V and 21,25 Ah.
With the street version was that enough for max speed 55Kmh 
By one average speed from 30Kmh have you a range i think so 60Km.

The bolts are hold by two screws
and can not slip out.
And the Gearbox was fixed on the bolt so have the screws nothing pressure.
