I've been interested in building an ESK8 for years and just started to look into it. I've been digging for nearly 3 months now and have begun to compile and edit parts lists on several sites. I've only purchased a deck so far. Then I discovered this forum and got hooked. I've scoured for info for about a week on here before I finally buckled down and made a profile. I have since scrapped all my previous parts lists and have started a new list. Hoping to get some good input and perspective on the pros and cons of what I personally am looking for in my build. I would like to build a dual belt or chain setup that's fast but more focused on range and torque. All terrain is a huge plus. I have a modest budget but am willing to make exceptions for reliability so none of these parts are final. Trying to pull off a Black and Blue color scheme and maybe add LED's at some point. Any recommendations are extremely appreciated. Especially on conflicting, undesirable, and undecided parts.

Deck: https://www.amazon.com/Moose-School-Skateboard-Deck-Black/dp/B003FVBZL4/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_3?keywords=MOOSE+Skateboards+OLD+SCHOOL+10+x+33+black&amp;qid=1556515177&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3-fkmrnull
Might opt for something longer with less truck interference.

Trucks: https://www.amazon.com/Caliber-Forty-Four-Satin-Blue-Trucks/dp/B00M6RWP12/ref=sr_1_17?keywords=ten+inch+trucks&amp;qid=1556515270&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-17

Motors: https://www.ebay.com/itm/C6374-efficience-brushless-motor-170KV-for-electric-skateboard-longboard-US-SHIP/323400358951?hash=item4b4c29dc27:g:c0gAAOSw2KRbh15a

Battery: http://www.diyeboard.com/10s3p-18650-lithium-battery-pack-10s-36v-6ah-with-charger-p-631.html

Undecided:
ESC/ VESC, Remote, Enclosure, Mount, Belt/Chain, Wheels

Would love to see your thoughts. Much love in advance! Help me get this baby built :star_struck:

When making a build I,(or at least I try to) look at what battery and drivetrains will fit the deck that I've chosen. I build my own enclosures so I don't encounter the problem that some people have. Which is choosing a deck then compromising on a shonky enclosure. So finding a deck with suitable enclosure is another thing to aim for. 
DIYeboard have a shocking reputation at least on this forum, have a read and make your own decisions.
Those motors are possibly untested by the masses, have a look for flipsky motors. There are good and bad ones I believe but some of the sizes have proven to be acceptable. Hobbyking motors are always a good option. To mount bigger motors on the caliber trucks you can always go each motor facing opposite directions or dual diagonal.

These are also great little motors.

If you are looking toward some cheap flipsky motors look here first
Those eBay ones tend to not be great

Https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/any-reviews-or-insight-on-flipsky-motors/68080/189

CALIBER trucks are small so you can only fit 6355 max as normal bigger than that you will need to go for diagonal

Diyeboard donâ€™t have a great reputation and the batteries being used there are not Samsungâ€™s or any of the good brands meaning you get really bad volatage sag and they use a cheap bms meaning the batteries break easily (@Tinp123 sells good legit batteries for cheap)

Also if you said your budget it would be easier to help

ay bru just wanna let you know that this pack will sag real bad. if you want 3p you'd be better investing in 30q's or go with lipos at a similar or higher capacity

for your esc, go for a vesc. I've heard you can get ones on ebay for as low as $50.

go with the mini remote on ebay

@Boardnamics for the motor mount, with belts.

and any Flywheel you like with either abec or kegel cores ðŸ˜Š

Your trucks wont fit dual 6374. I would recomend some 190kv 6455's they have tons of torque and more than enough for a begineer. Dual 6374 is enough to power a full size offroad build. 

For the remote, try the mini remote (trigger style) its super cheap and the trigger has alot of travel making it easier to control that other remotes.

Motor mounts should be from @boardnamics if you want good quality at a super cheap price point.

I personally use this pulley kit. It comes with everything you need for gearing, including some belts.https://m.banggood.com/15mm-Wide-Belts-DIY-ABEC-Flywheel-Pulley-Kit-265mm-255mm-p-1222305.html?rmmds=search

For wheels, you can get the generic flywheel clones and save $70

Last thing: dont buy a battery or really anything else from diyeboard. He scams people and often never ships the item. Those batteries are poorly built and will give you crap performance. Get a 10s4p minimum for dual motor. 

If you want, i can build you a 10s4p pack with genuine vtc5 cells. Its built much better and safer than anything diyeboard sells

Although new to esk8s Ive been skating for years and am used to pretty high speeds I was looking for something affordable in the 190-200kv range, thanks. As for battery packs I appreciate it, but now that I see how many people are successfully building their own, I'm considering investing in a spot welder to build my own packs as well. After reading a bit more on the company I see that diyeboard's infamous rep precedes them. Thanks for the heads up!

not super familiar with the terms sag or 30q. I have heard that VESC is the way to go, would I need two or are dual vesc's available? thanks for your help.

30Q is short for Samsung INR18650-30Q, the preferred cell for esk8 packs. There are dual ESCs available from several sources -  Enertion, Flipsky and others.

Hey mate! Dual Vescs are a thing. Flipsky and Enertion both have options. Other companies have them, too, but they're the popular ones. The Focbox Unity is what everyone will recommend, so if it's in your budget, you'll never need another vesc after buying this (that's at least the idea).

Voltage sag is when a high amount of current is being requested from the batteries by the speed controller/motors. The voltage of the batteries will drop or 'sag' to compensate for the high current. This means your motors will perform suboptimally. Samsung 30Q's are good quality batteries that are less inclined to experience this sag as they're far more capable of dealing with the high current demands of your motors and speed controller.

I agree! This is the main reason why I haven't really purchased anything yet. I wanna be sure its all good the first time haha. I figured those ebay motors were questionable lol. I've seen mixed reviews of both hobbyking and flipsky motors to tho. I would like to go with the side by side setup. As I said none of my parts are final. Any suggestions on larger trucks.  I might even change it up and just go the mountain board route :slight_smile:

If you're wanting to build your own pack, depending on where you're located, https://www.18650batterystore.com or https://ru.nkon.nl are both good options. If you're not wanting to build your own, plenty of guys on the forums that build custom packs. Traverse to the Sale threads on here and there's a thread of reputable sellers to choose from :slight_smile:

EDIT: regarding battery options, Samsung 30Q and Sony VTC6's are solid options that give you optimal balance of discharge rate and capacity. :slight_smile:

Be prepared for the high setup cost to build a pack, in the end it could easily cost substantially more to build one than to have bought it. Of you find thats the case and you dont want to build one, just lmk.

There are more than enough people on the forum offering battery building service. It's way less of a hasle to buy one, than to make one. You can easily spend as much on the tools as on the complete battery pack. And I personally would not go lower than a 4p pack for a dual drive.

Honestly this is a HUUUUUGE deal that will get gobbled up quickly. If I were building a deck from scratch, I would build it like this. In fact, I have almost the same build in progress because it is such a wonderful setup. I know you are a DIY guy but this is a really well done DIY board for almost exactly what it would cost to make it yourself (time and extra random connectors, fasteners, cables, bolts, etc are already included). I'd jump if you want a board quick and haven't invested a bunch of money in parts that may or may not be compatible yet.

Welcome my friend and good luck with the build.  A first build can be a frustrating exercise but with the right advice it can be a bit less painful.  
As @bigben stated its best to choose the deck and enclosure and then go from there with regards to batteries etc.  As you are stateside then I would suggest a pack from @barajabali as he is a very respected battery guy.  The battery is the heart of the board and as such should be a quality item using cells that are tried and tested by the community and while I applaud full diy, building a battery is probably a task best suited to an expert.
As for drive trains? well I would be thinking along the lines of a manufacturers kit.  You get parts that work together out of the box and while this might seem like an easy option it gives you a working knowledge of components without the hassle of trying to blend different parts into one functioning board.  Have a look at these options;

Once you become a customer of any of these great suppliers you will then have access to help that you will definitely need during the process and theres always us too.

I have 8 focboxes so really don't need a unity yet......

One thing I don't do though in any build is attach any kind of external accessories to the esc.  Period.  I can kill a vesc by looking at it the wrong way so nothing extra for me.  I keep it simple, stupid, safe.  The less to go wrong the less likely I am to impersonate superman on my next ride.
