He's launching a Kickstarter for his board soon. I presume the answer is no though... do you even know how you would implement them?

Yes I'm looking to build my own. For a lot less than  $2000. But I cant source the front steering Brackets. I'm an engineer by trade but out the game at the moment. So have no CNC machine to work on.
