Not to sure how to wire these since I‚Äôm always buying vendors anti spark switches, but I believe 2 wires will be connected for on/off and the other 2 are for the led switch

You need to find out the pinout from the ESC first. 12v C NO ground in some order. Then wire 12v, and ground to the corresponding + and - of the button. And NO ( normally open) and C ( common) there should be very tiny print next to the leads on the plastic.
