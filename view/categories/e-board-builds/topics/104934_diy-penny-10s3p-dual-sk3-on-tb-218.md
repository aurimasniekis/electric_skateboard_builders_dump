After 1 year of thinking about the best eboard  for power ,speed and portability i finally find my build

First i will build my own deck 
![Screenshot_20191225-141707|250x500](upload://7DLSnqyYAMozlcTzCZZZqMQeW8W.jpeg) 
The deck will have an open trap like in this picture to fit the 10s3p (samsung 25r) from my old acton blink quatro , and will be wrap in carbonfiber and fiber resin 

Option 1 -I will install torque board 218mm truck  with dual dickyhoe cnc reverse mount ![s-l300|300x157](upload://4BBmxOL1FTrCkqsucIQ1WsXHIXG.jpeg)   
 for my dual sk3 6374 motors + chains gear from alliexpress ![download%20(1)|144x144](upload://sMWsfQNZ12YURDMJ3e7VugcehtJ.jpeg)  ![18181|565x414](upload://2R0Tg9VEVBnbhM5lVT6RpGWxZI2.jpeg) 

Option 2 : dual hub motors from my acton blink quatro ![3ekonh54tylz|690x431](upload://quORDO5MRPmsrK0ObqdYbUvPbky.jpeg) 

All build on my fsesc6.6 ![download|299x168](upload://8TzW33f82YOnX5KQox112atXwuO.jpeg) 

I will need your help for the maximum setup i can put on my fsesc 6.6 for max setting with sk3 and acton hub motors

So the sk3s are 100% better then the hubs but those aliexpress chain drives are shocking and will snap super quickly

You can buy @dickyho  mounts and a cheap 15t motor pulley and then get someone to 3d print he wheel pulley for you

The battery also produces low amps and has a small capacity so would only use that battery if 100% necessary
