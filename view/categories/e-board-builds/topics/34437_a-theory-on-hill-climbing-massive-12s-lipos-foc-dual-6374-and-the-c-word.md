In it's current state of evolution, my build is fairly intense. It's built for hard, wide-open-throttle uphill acceleration, and aggressive downhill braking. Do I ride it that way? Yes, sometimes. Mostly, however , I use it mostly for running my big handsome dog Louie:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/4/f43623d3cf6f7d8a9211df082b3b52bdb3e5f1b3.jpg" width="666" height="500">
Specs:
Dual 6374mm motors on 15mm belts 
Dual FOCBOX controllers
Abec 11 97s 
Dual Gens Tattu 4s 22Ah25c lipos in 8s (651.2Wh)
Dual TB reverse mounts with added idler pulleys. 
TB 218mm hangers on caliber ii 50 deg. baseplates

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/0/30ade685438c738afe997f9e0efbbd4da59b20fb.jpg" width="666" height="500">

So what's the deal with the massive batteries? Just think about that 25c rating on a 22Ah pack. Can I pull 550 Amps continuous? Of course not. That would vaporize everything. What I CAN do, is pull pretty heavy current with almost negligible voltage sag. Pretty intense range too. No matter how hard and far I've ridden, I can't even put a dent in them. 

That being said, the obvious theme of this build is overkill. I wanted to create a vehicle more than capable of anything I put it through, and so far, SOOO good. 

The best performance enhancing addition I've made is the addition of an Idler-pulley to my @torqueboards reverse mounts ($5total cost), which I documented here: [http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/my-obsession-with-idler-pulleys/30191](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/my-obsession-with-idler-pulleys/30191)

The next step in refinement of this project is going to be the addition of a BMS with communication, so I can measure the actual power related metrics. Maybe even add another battery for 12s...

Hey Pat, your build is looking better all the time.
I can surely vouch for this beastly setup. I have seen it fly up some really steep hills.
Adding another one of those batteries for 12s would make it insane but I'm not sure the Focbox would handle 12s in FOC mode. You might have to switch to BLDC.
How's your plans for an enclosure going?

I'm curious as to how many more amps the FOC box will handle in FOC at 12S as well. I can vouch for it up to 40A and 149KV. I've been running 12 FOC with sensors in the FOC box for about 4 months now.

If you want to make an enclosure of fiberglass, I think I have some cloth left over from when I used to do my own surfboard repairs, you would just need to get some resin and catalyst.
Epoxy resin would be best because it is more flexible than Polyester resin and less prone to cracking.
I prefer the molded abs enclosures myself.
Psychotiller could prob set you up with something that would fit.
Runplayback used to make some really nice heavy duty abs enclosures. Don't know if he's still into that or not.

Here's a question Ive been confused about for a while: Does C rating effect torque? Will a higher C rating give me that little boost I need when goin uphills? I'm using 25c lipos and was looking at going to 40-45c

A higher C rating will decrease voltage sag during heavy loading like going up hills.
Higher voltage seems to increase torque.
Higher motor max setting in bldc tool will increase torque.
Running large motors like 6374s increases torque over smaller motors like 6355s

In my experience, polyester resins are more flexible than epoxy which is much harder. 
If you look at epoxy surfboards they are known for their stiffness.
Either would be good for an enclosure though. If you want any pointers when you make one, drop me a line and I will try to help out.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/3/c3ae4031211140743bccb8964f74e0d469e11d16.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/a/faa787d5194bfaa26ca62d7799ea7be54c3b5e3a.JPG" width="666" height="500">

[/quote]

What I did is mix some  polyester resin in a cup and some epoxy resin in a cup.
After they cured, I removed the resin samples and tested them.
The polyester resin sample was hard and brittle and would not bend but just broke.
The epoxy resin sample did not feel as hard as the poly and I was able to bend it some before breaking it.
I owned many surfboards over the years, polyester and epoxy and what I have noticed is that the polyester boards get cracks and dings much easier than the epoxy boards.
Fact is that epoxy resin is 35% stronger than polyester resin.
The difference in stiffness of epoxy surfboards and fiberglass surfboards is due to the different core used.
An epoxy surfboard uses a  polystyrene core which is stiff
A Fiberglass surfboard uses  a polyurethane core which is more flexible.
https://www.surfworld.ie/blogs/news/57003653-difference-between-epoxy-and-pu-fiberglass-surfboards

So if you want your enclosure to be 35% stronger, use epoxy resin.
Besides epoxy resin doesn't set as fast or get hot like polyester resin so it is much easier to work with.
I know that you can mix polyester resin to cook slower but knowing how much catalyst to add can be tricky.
With epoxy resin you simply follow the recipe on the bottle 2:1 for the resins I have used and it cooks perfectly every time.

I get ya. Epoxy is definitely stronger, but in this application I'm finding fibreglass perfect.
 I've been running my polyester fibreglass enclosure for quite a while now. I even used a single layer version originally with no splitting or cracking. I now use a mixture of 2-3 layers depending.
@Namasaki I'd love to send you an enclosure for your lips packs if I could work out some reasonable shipping. Kind of giving back for your good lipo work!

I was considering switching them out to XT150, but yeah, I've been eyeing these connectors and I'll probably just feed my connector hording problem.

Is the antispark part on the battery side? As in, can I get away with buying just 7mm bullets, if such things exist? From photos of AS150 it looks like it's on the male part, so 50% chance?

I wonder if these are real... $1.70 per set, doesn't say Amass in the listing...

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/F11415-AS150-Battery-Terminal-Plug-Group-No-Resistance-TL2913-for-RC-Helicopter-FS/32735356575.html

Ah hell looks like Tarot and Amass might be somehow related. At $1.70/set it's cheaper than XT150. I'll stock up...

EDIT looks like above are not complete set -- aliexpress has listings for each of the types of connector.

AS150 sparking plug / one pair TL2911
AS150 ESC end plug / band resistance TL2912
AS150 battery terminal plug group / no resistance TL2913 

Can't find them cheaper than $5/set

https://www.amazon.com/Cheerwing%C2%AE-Amass-Anti-Spark-Connector-Bettery/dp/B00PLHRDCA/

Going with the ebay. Hope the links help someone.

As for the batteries, quick googling tells me Gens Tattu is perhaps industrial application. They say full capacity for 200 cycles, then reduced capacity for 400 more cycles. If we're charging twice a month, that's 24 cycles a year. And if we charge to 4.1v/cell these will probably last forever. Weirdly it says 1C max charge, but that's 22amps, which seems like a lot but also not so much? Lol the scale is confusing.

They're not cheap but they're worth it. The ability to connect your batteries in series and then disconnect and put them on the charger is awesome. The batteries do not come with the anti spark connector. In my configuration I have three sets. One set connects the batteries to the controllers, and two sets connect the batteries to the charger. Since you're going to be running three batteries you'll probably need four.

The plastic Shield has a coupling that prevents cross polarization to some extent. It took me a little while to figure out which one is for which connector male / female.

Another point of consideration for my decision to go with these is the cycle lifetime of Lipo batteries. My theory is that by never needing to operate them outside of the 4.1-3.7 V/c range, they'll last much longer than lower capacity packs for the same amount of riding. 

Seems logical, am I wrong?

As for charging, I use the EV Peak CQ3 100Wx4 hobby charger. It can do 10A per channel max, so it's not the fastest. I sorta regret not spending a little more for higher quality, mostly because it doesn't read SOH (to the best of my knowledge). When I become rich and famous, or win the lottery, I'd like to get a Graupner Poleron, but I think the smarter option is a massive BMS. For now, however, the $150 charger is fine. those AS-Bullets make it super easy to connect to charge and wire back to series. I think you'll like them!!

haha $150 charger is the cheap one. Crazy hobby!

I've only really looked at hyperion/icharger/revolectrix, and ended up with a pair of refurb PL8s and a GT1200. And a small pile of those HP DPS-1200FB, some with the ground lift mod to do series 24v DC. In theory I can independently charge all 3 packs at full 1C. The trick is finding a good 12s or 14s (if A123) charger...

Have you seen the Dual PowerLab 8 is on blowout? I honestly have no idea how it compares to the Graupner, but it would be sweet for your 2 packs.

http://www.usastore.revolectrix.com/Products_2/Cellpro-Dual-PowerLab_2/Cellpro-Dual-PowerLab_660

The HP supplies can put out 900w on 120v. Really small, and really high spec, I think they were like $800 new? Around $30 on ebay.

Gonna take a close look at the chargers you mentioned. So different!

If I do a serious build with these packs. I'm probably gonna attempt some kind of mechanical series/parallel lockout port like this

Hey @PatRocks, so I'm curious to know your thoughts on these 20Ah lipos from HK (these are multistar) though they're 10C, that's still 200A continuous discharge (though undoubtedly this is lower in practice) . Would it be wise to purchase 3 of these to achieve long range, high power and good life (keeping at 4.1-3.7V)? I ask because these ones are super cheap compared to new gens tattu but I'm hoping would give similar benefits. 

Lipos can be found here (https://hobbyking.com/en_us/multistar-high-capacity-4s-20000mah-multi-rotor-lipo-pack.html)

Personally, I would never waste the money on multi-star batteries. They have a pretty bad reputation for quality, and although they claim high capacity for a low price, you'd be better off with a higher-rated lower capacity pack for the same cost

As far as the gens go, there are alternative options. Plenty of reputable manufacturers out there, and to be honest, 22 amp hour pack is overkill for almost anybody. Check out @Namasaki 's Hi Power 10s lipo with BMS thread

Granted they're overkill, but I do admire the options it provides. I've sunk about 900 miles into my board since building it in May and one of my first world problems is capacity. I see about 10 miles worth of road per charge.

I'll explore other reputable brands and see how much capacity I can get for small-ish form factor (read fits under 40" board).

I can't seem to find Namasaki's post, do you have a link handy? Otherwise I'll hone my search skills lol.

Update on the packs.

Didn't have time for a full cycle test, but one swollen pack has IRs not so close together and 1 cell that seems weak. Other swollen pack looks okay so far.

Seller's super cool and sending out 2 more packs. Not sure what to do with the swollen ones, don't wanna burn the house down trying to use free old packs! Can't imagine how big a fire these guys would make.

Pat you sent me down a rabbit hole :slight_smile:

Teh internets says Revolectrix Powerlab IR measurements are not as accurate/consistent as iCharger. iCharger is surprisingly accurate.

The only accurate way to measure is to do an equivalent series resistance (ESR) measurement, using "4 wire Kelvin method", at some standard temperature and standard state of charge, as IR fluctuates greatly.

The best way to measure is using Wayne Giles ESR meter. Wayne is apparently a retired EE and RC hobbiest. I think he used to sell them in small batches, but now they're widely available via hobbyking even. The device also calculates what a realistic max C rate is for the measured IR, but that's just plugging numbers into some formula.

https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2809470-Wayne-Giles-ESR-Meter-is-back-in-production

http://www.progressiverc.com/universal-esr-analysis-meter.html

Revolectrix put the circuit into a device that can measure 6s simultaneous. A bit cheaper, and circuit's probably not quite as good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHtZ_FCCmx0

Gonna try to get my hands on the Revo unit, as it looks like a nice cell voltage checker as well. Revolectrix products are usually very high precision and very well calibrated.

Oh almost forgot, the Powerlab chargers measure IR only when charging, and it varies quite a bit during charge. I charged 2 packs to full, and noted the IR at the end.

pack#1 (bulging, weak cell#4)
3.1 mohm
2.2 mohm
2.5 mohm
2.2 mohm

pack#2
1.3 mohm
1.3 mohm
1.6 mohm
1.3 mohm

These seem very low to me, but the absolute numbers coming off my charger don't really mean anything, except to establish a reference for comparisons. Will update when I get the honesty meter in.

My concern with the esr-meter is that it says "up to 12Ah packs" do you think that is an actual limit? I almost bought one a while ago, but couldn't find any information about the capacity max of the device.

specs look nice, especially the low IR and the discharge graph at (18c, that's 396 amps wow can't believe the wires and contacts held up). But most spec sheets look nice. For a high power dual vesc4 setup, theoretical continuous from batteries would be 2 x 60a, not even 5C.

If I were you I'd look for expected cycle life and owner testimonials.

TBH if there wasn't such a good deal for the used ones, I'd not have pulled the trigger.

Yeah I can definitely see it going that way. right now my main pack is 12s2p A123, but they're four 6s1p electrically, with XT60s and balance leads, and big XT150 joining the packs. Every time I open the enclosure I'm looking at those wires coming together, then separating again for the vescs.

I see 2 downsides -- charging, and telemetry via ackmaniac's phone app. I don't want 4 chargers or 4 phones :astonished:

The babysteps for me is probably independent front and rear.

I realize now this is really a sick hobby. The cool parts are so scarce you're forced to horde up a pile of parts. And things break. And so many screws... WTF I have like 6 kinds of loctite, and I keep upgrading my hex and torx stuff. Need a long one to reach there, and some to carry with me when the loctite gives.

I did a cycle test on the one original non-puffed pack, 20006mah in, 18561mah out. That's 84% of 22000mah. Sooo, borderline, but tons of life left for a skateboard, and I still think good deal for the $120. The Powerlab is showing amazing IR in the range of 1mohm. I'll get the rest of the packs tested eventually. Might have to rig up a hair dryer as resistive load. Babysitting for 4 hours is a bit much.

Nice work, thank you for your contribution to this topic!! Were your original puffed packs hard case? All the ones ive received have aluminum shields under the plastic...

That IR measurement is very reassuring. Their company claims that that is an attainable standard for them, it's pretty sweet that the testing confirms it. 

Dude, how many of those did you buy? Are there any left??

Fyi @deucesdown - last night I switched out all of the connectors on my batteries so the anti Spark connector is on the battery. Simplifies everything

Bought 3, 2 were bad, seller sent replacements but didn't want the bad ones back. All the packs are the same, I think just like yours. There's some kind of plate. It's just bulging out a bit.

The AS150 connectors, one of my batteries had the antispark end. Reading instructions and watching youtube videos, the intended application is antispark at the esc (and I guess the charger). As you said, the connectors are sweeeeet. I think there's a AN150 without antispark, but hard to find. Bit overkill though maybe? Been reading the giant Graphene thread at rcgroups.com, sounds like the connector tabs and other internals of a lipo pack are probably not able to handle 150A.

@patrocks remember @flywithgriff in your idler thread? He sold me most of his powertrain (thanks man!) Trucks, mounts, idlers, motors. Somehow I'm dangerously close to cloning your build. I'm pondering the 12s vs 190kv motor question.

4 phones? Maybe use separate bluetooth modules on each vesc, then u can just switch between them on the app to look at battery voltage or what not. Or just clone your App and use multi window to view front and rear axle specs on screen simultaneously 😉.

Is there a reason you cant charge 4 batteries with one charger? I assume you can just make a 4 way split adaptor and plug them all in unless there is a large voltage differential between packs.

For the app, one of the things I look for is fault codes if something blips. Canbus is nice for that. You've blown a bunch of transceivers trying to hook up 4 vesc on canbus? Honestly I'd almost prefer pure serial data logging to something like a RPI onboard, and have it auto post process and upload via wifi. Maybe some day I'll take a crack at it.

Have you tried cloning and splitscreening the app? Lol 4 way clone and build a mini tablet into the deck ftw.

I was mostly kidding about the 4 phones and chargers. At the most ideal extreme we balance charge everything at 1p, perhaps to 4.1v/cell to extend life (another reason I haven't tried BMS). At the other extreme, bulk parallel charge.

Be VERYx10e1000 careful. ITs stupid easy to ruin an entire everything when doing this. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bag9S9DlAlw/?taken-by=longhairedboy

Desoldering the tabs from the PCBs will be extremely difficult. ITs going to take torch surgery to keep the solder hot while you bend the tabs up and then try to slip them through the notches on the PCB. If you have a rework station with a heat gun that may do it. A ftat wide tip on a high heat solder gun may do it too. I don't have that particular item but after this experience i will be aquiring it. 

The cell tabs are crimped to copper core tabs, but the cell tabs themselves are not solderable. And if you cut it down that far you won't have enough to crimp anyway. Ruined. 

Ultimately what i ended up doing was something interesting. I took a brand new exacto blade and doomed it to cutting copper. i razored the tab out of the pcb right at the hole, as close as humanly possible to the opposide side of the solder joint to get as much copper as possible. 

What that did was leave a long, thin edge of copper that i was able to flux and tin, then solder directly to a tinned length of 16 guage superworm wire with which i could  then work when trying to tie these up in series. 

it took me all goddamned day to do this. Its slow, tedious, difficult, and gives you plenty of oppportunity to ruin a $200+ "smart" lipo pack. 

I then ran it through the balancing side of one of my typical BMSs and bypassed discharge to let the ESCs handle the LVC.

they're only as long as they are in the pic for convenience. They were much, much shorter lengths than that when the final pack was assembled. less than a quarter inch between tabs. And the jumpers between the two 6S sides were actually 10 gauge because they were a few inches long, and 10 awg throughout the rest of the board as well.

Okay, so I am starting a new phase of evolution in my build: CAPACITORS!!!!

Everything I've read suggests that adding additional capacitors inline between batteries and esc's is good. Not only for smoothing ripple current, or current spikes, improving r/f signal clarity, and extending esc lifetimes, but also for supplying more power on demand!! So I'm giving it a go.

I found a ridiculously high performance cap pack from EMPERFORMANCE for $55 on ebay. At 23.5 Farads, and an operating voltage of 50V, I think I have a good candidate 😆

At this point, the only thing I'm not sure of, is if a capacitor will add to the performance capabilities

Update: Capacitors are in. No noticeable change in performance (as I predicted), however, it seems it may be a little more crisp in responsiveness... maybe placebo effect 😅. 
After thinking about it all day at work (when I should have been working lol), I don't think this cap-pack will make a noticeable difference in "power-on-demand" because the capabilities of my batteries are so insane already: 22Ah 25c.
I think that the main benefit I will take from the CP is longer fbox life, and better remote reception (maybe). I feel as though the configuration that would benefit the most from adding a huge capacitor bank ( 23.5 Capitol-Farads) is one with limited amp-delivery.
More to follow soon...

Just a preliminary test: batteries charged to 3.85-V/c. This data is from 1 of 2 independent controllers (servo-splitter). Depending on the accuracy of the information from the vesc monitor, I'm looking at what may be 69.8 amps from the batteries, and around 1.5 volts of sag! Looks good to me...

So, after due consideration, I have decided to venture into the 12s Realm. What this means is 976.2 Watt hours, and I'm both excited and nervous.

The packs I will be using have different amounts of Cycles on them, so to keep that all balanced I will be implementing a best tech BMS. Soon after I have this working, I plan to venture into resin infusion carbon fiber for an enclosure!! At the very least this will be interesting

AMASS do a XT150 & a AS150, the latter have a larger bullet ratted to higher current...

I got some german cap banks on a pcb with a couple solder buckets on them. I think of them like insurance for my speed controllers and consistent Rx voltage to help limit the chance of a brown out. 
While I enjoy going fast I don't enjoy crashing. So anything I can do... I do. 
& In a round about way the more battery you have the more ampacity you have, so you have more capacity for positive inductive current spikes and they are the ones that kill electronics.

Those poor little BMS  with 50ma balancing capacity ain't gonna make a dent in your huge lipos. I think. Maybe weeks to correct any significant out of balance? Don't stop checking on the packs post-bms-installation.

12s will blow up your skirt for sure. Increasing voltage increases the ability to deliver amps. Everything gets more intense.

I keep just reading and fantasizing. I gotta do more building...

Well, the Hcx-D223V1 has 126mAh balance current, so maybe a little better. I don't think the cells will drift **_too_** far out of balance, but I want to have consistent management to reign in the drift. 

@Cobber what's the farad count on those caps? I couldn't agree more about them being an insurance policy. There's no discernible downside to having them IMO. Maybe the space they occupy..? Lol that's going to be an issue for me soon

I'm a commute boarder, and a bunch of commuter board projects have jumped the line. Don't want to clutter this thread with unrelated non-overkill stuff.

Gonna study up (again) on the caps, but to be honest, I'm more interested in the high current PCBs and solder buckets. :slight_smile:  One of the things I've been thinking about forever is how to do a bus bar for B+ and B-, so I can make everything modular, at least in the mule board.

Went out for a "midnight" (2am) run last night for some stress testing. Charged to 3.85 Volts/cell, the 12S config just **RIPS**. Like holy-f*ck it's unreal. I can't even top it out because it's too scary lol. 

Initially, it appears that at the higher voltage, I draw 5 or 6 less batt Amps per vesc on the same 20%incline run (Hill st. San Diego). Makes sense though, now that I think about it. Same Watts at higher volts = less current. Pretty interesting. 

The sweetest thing about the AS150 connectors, which I use for all battery side connections, is the modularity of the pack. Takes about 5min to go 8s to 12s or back to 8 (not sure I'll ever go back tho).

The thing is up to 31lbs now, HAHAHA

So i have some data. Dual 6374 190kv 18/36 on 107mm.  Batteries are 8ah 25-50c on 12s.  I did have some voltage sag towards the end at top speed but I guess one important thing to note while climbing this hill was the temps which were increasing quick.  It's dual FOCBOX mounted on an aluminum plate with heat transfer paste not enclosed yet so exposed to the wind.  For sure your batteries can handle the amps but the ESC will be your limiting factor I think.
Data is per FocBox.
Currently speed wobbles is the limiting factor.

Update:  I did something really negligent a couple weeks ago. I left my board powered on for a day or two, and went out for a hard ride without checking my battery voltage. Started hitting my battery cutoff about a mile away from home, and when I got back I had 2 cells at about 2.86 volts. After freaking out for a few minutes I got my s*** together, and attempted to balance them back to good standing. At first I was having trouble balancing them, but they're actually back in line with each other. I thought I had ruined about $1,200 worth of batteries, but for now they seem okay.

Additionally, I decided to transplant all of the mechanical and electrical items on to another deck which was donated to me by @Namasaki . The flat deck, vs the drop deck that I was using seems to accommodate this gigantic 12s configuration fairly well while the other deck is in the shop for an overhaul.

All at the same time, I have ventured into experimenting with vacuum resin infusion. My goal is to make brackets to hold the batteries to the deck so I can get rid of these straps. It is my hope that the carbon fiber brackets will prove strong enough to prevent the vibration that these huge batteries create when I hit large bumps.

This thing is definitely radical, yet it behaves as if it were an extension of my soul. I still haven't been anywhere near full speed, it's just too scary. When I switch back to the drop deck it will be more stable at speed.

Update time!!!
After spending a lot of time and money on my recent side project  (carbon fiber infusion), I am once again at a happy resting place in my build!
 
As you may know, I have some pretty heavy batteries. Until recently, they were mounted on the deck with some Velcro straps. The straps were never going to be capable of truly securing the packs, but they worked. They did however interfere with my foot placement, so I set out to eliminate them. The only thing that seemed strong enough to support the batteries was carbon fiber. 

After numerous (like 12) failed attempts at the resin infusion process, I got it right! ![20180308_124911|666x500](upload://kOqzCGwKXmd6Yn4TNmDzcG4QQ3v.jpg)![20180312_123016|666x500](upload://xJqOIVyhpFWbcf5TP5bUyNrGqP.jpg)
After some trimming and drilling, I have support!!
![20180414_230327|374x500](upload://HaesYh1L91RPAMCMKnL5v9gOEa.jpg)

The ride quality is completely different without the batteries bouncing against the deck (lol). Just feels so much more solid. 

Also, I finally decided to shell out the cash for a set of the F1 107's. I'm speechless. So big, so beautiful, so good. I just drive over everything, not a care in the world.

I'm waiting for @JLabs to provide his 44t pulley in a 15mm width too. Not that I need anymore torque, but I do want more 😎. I can't wait  (ahem)

Cheers everyone!

@deucesdown I just bought a Wayne Giles esr meter!! After some thought, I caved in. Since the packs I'm running are probably at around 50 cycles now, I just gotta know how they're holding up. 

I've been running these batteries between 4.1v/c max. and 3.6v/c min. for about a year (except for that one fateful night). The drift across that range is around +/- 0.2 volts per cell, with most of the cells inline. Very excited to see the actual IR values after a year of use!! Should have the unit by next Friday 😆

So I ordered the Wayne Giles esr meter, and received it yesterday and started testing my packs. I'm surprised to see such low IR readings on batteries that I've used every day for a year now! Each cell is reading between 1.2-1.8 miliohms, with the average being around 1.4! I'm pretty astonished to see this, but need to take the brackets off and remeasure the cells without compression. 

Initially, it appears that these packs still have significant remaining useful life! They've spent their entire lives between 4.1-and 3.6 v/c, with a few exceptions, and I am very pleased with the value ($) I've gotten from them. 

This data seems consistent with my original theory about the advantages of high capacity batteries and their longevity in terms of minimal charge cycles necessary for daily use. Pretty sweet! I'm going to update this thread in a day or two when I have the uncompressed measurements for these cells.

Cheers!

Some interesting data from the esr meter! My batteries are showing some pretty good numbers, as I mentioned above. The total pack ESR is measuring at 39.9mOhmms (12.9+13.2+13.8). Checking the formula R*A=V against real world data from ackmaniac's app shows surprisingly accurate numbers!! The formula above predicts voltage drop for a specific amount of current drawn. So for a 50Amp load, (0.0399 × 50A = 1.995V ) I should see a voltage drop of 1.995V across the pack. 
Some FOCBOX data from a Hill climb test: ![Screenshot_20180706-042104_ESC%20Monitor|281x500](upload://8K0AGfnCDhDbxFqHPuPeI4TPNQU.jpg)
So according to the formula, at 56.3Amps, I should see a voltage drop of 2.25. According to the app data, at 56.3A the pack is dropping 2.4V!! Pretty damn close to theoretical! I'm very impressed with this level of accuracy, seriously. 

I'm still blown away by the endurance of my batteries. And the ESR meter has proven to be a TREMENDOUSLY valuable tool. As @deucesdown said in a PM conversation, it's great to be able to health-check the explosive devices, lol. 

I have acquired a set of 4 Turnigy graphene 6Ah 6s "65c" packs, which I'll probably wait to use for the next build. The preliminary ESR meter readings show very exciting results, even before the break-in process is completed. For a 6s2p test, these are reading 11.7mOhms! Little things are going to be savage at 12s2p😎

One of the features of the Giles esr meter is that for a lipo pack w/capacity <10Ah, it will measure the "true C rating". As lipo C-rating is one of the most controversial things in history, it's great to have a no-bullshit appraisal of the figure. This meter rates the true C rating as the max current that a pack can safely sustain throughout the pack's charge, without overheating or compromising the pack's health/longevity. This meter is showing the 6s graphene packs capable of between 180 and 195 sustained Amps per cell. That's about 31 true-C vs 65C claimed, but still pretty damn intense, right?? I'm gonna start a thread specifically about this information when I get time and data, but for now these are preliminary results only.

TL? DR? If you are running Lipos, get an ESR meter! Thanks for reading

Update time! A couple days ago, I was careless with my remote and sent my board into a garage door at full throttle. Broke my deck, but fortunately that was all. Valuable safety lesson.
![20181204_211852|690x388](upload://wRenlXbFpSxZ9O5lALISEabwPra.jpeg) 

So, my second build project will be sidelined for a while. Meanwhile, I couldn't stand not having a ride, so I made some moves and finished my original deck. A friend of mine does electric wood burning, so I asked him to help me decorate! Sanded, and stained it, polyurethane and glass grip (thanks @longhairedboy and many others!). Pretty great looking board in my opinion:
![20181208_131015|690x388](upload://mWBjElwzFnBUbUo3TsgtxUbLCLu.jpeg) ![20181209_053627|281x500](upload://XdoVbKvSYuSP1vMm8gkJ2bPNSY.jpeg) 
Transplanted all the hardware over last night! 

A massive improvement I made came from (finally) reading the @Alphamail bushing setup thread. Ordered some kranks, machined washers and angled risers from Muirskate, and pivot cups!! Can't believe how much of a difference they have made. 
Setup is all barrels, (bs/rs format ) front- 90/87 cupped washer roadside on surfrodz 45 rkp. Rear is dewedged 7° to 37, 218 hanger cal44 baseplate. 90bs 93rs-cupped. 
Totally different animal. Thanks Brad!! Your thread has changed everything for me! 

Batteries seem to be holding up pretty well still! Probably going to test them later tonight to be sure, but last test showed normal IR drift from cell to cell. 

Anyway, it sucked to lose the old Madrid deck, but the loss pushed me to improve my setup in many ways. The glass/poly grip is truly an amazing feel. Super easy too, great looking results for a first try 😎
