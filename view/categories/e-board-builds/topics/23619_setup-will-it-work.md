Hi guys

Ive been doing some reserch in here.

I want to build my own esk8...

i am on a budget and considering parts:

im considering the SK3 213kv
i understand that a 6S battery pack would do for this motor, is that correct?
Im considering the X-Car 150, is it any good?

They have a 120a but its not in stock...

Im not a heavy guy and im considering it for easy comuting in the city.
I Don't need to go 30Mph

Thanks!
Elad

all of that *should* work fine.

Since the x-car 150 is 70'ish $ - i might suggest spending an extra 15-20$ and getting VESC.  it will let you run >6s!  Better braking, and more configurable.

If you get the x-car - don't forget to get a programming card!  They have a simple one and LCD one.  The LCD version is ~16$ more. Again - you're now at VESC costs (or super close).  But w/ the x-car you are limited to 6s or less.  Where the VESC is up to 12s (w/ your motor chosen i'd go 8-10s max to avoid 60k ERPM issue).

I have used the X-car on at least 5 builds now and I have never seen one fail. they are solid as a rock so long as you don't need more than 6S.

thank you for your advise.
This is exactly my dilema...
Originally i thought of buying an even cheaper ESC but i shouldnt be cheap on a device like this (the whole esk8 should be good, no one wants to get hurt for just a few bucks..)

And now that im approching VESC figures im considering it.
@lowGuido have you try the VESC?

If you are building a new budget setup, will you take the vesc or esc?

```
I would only use VESC if i needed more than 6S.
If you only need 6S then the xcar is sufficient. 
Everyone here raves about VESC but they aren't that special.

Also i dont know where everyone is getting their VESC'S from but round here they are $200 or more. Xcar is $70

My two pennies (only talking about streetboards):
Car ESC for 6s boards - much more power. (running a xcar 150A too)
More than 6s - nicer to get a Vesc
