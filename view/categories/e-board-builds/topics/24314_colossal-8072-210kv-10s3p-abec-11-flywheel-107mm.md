Just thought I'd share my latest build. I wanted to build something that was a little from the norm. The build consists of 36" Jet Potato board, 8072 - 220kv motor, Ebay modified pulleys 40:24 ratio, Psychotiller trucks and enclosure, group buy 10s3p battery, Abec 11 107mm, Drok voltage display, TB 12s esc, custom motor mount, and HK-GT2B Master Cho mod. The only thing missing is to still apply grip tape and make a tail guard. Board weighs 22.3lbs.
 
Haven't rode the board yet. Somewhat scared of what this board can do.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/1/51e3f465ad6fa1f92b6949b8fb42de2e7c63815d.jpg" width="640" height="428"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/c/cc3d2ed31999bb3ddf3a76d8b1ad4983049da2db.jpg" width="640" height="428"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/8/98d6ee6ce623fdc4b52428affb753db0dd971c8d.jpg" width="640" height="428"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/3/534ca0a67566967605e611baefe09cd119ba34e1.jpg" width="640" height="428"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/b/8b390d156a099270cb64cdf19d7a9d8be42cfbc0.jpg" width="640" height="428"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/2/c258f5bbfe42b5ea9c8df3324a7e1614f7206264.jpg" width="640" height="428">

that's AWESOME!  What pulleys did you use and modify?  I have a set of E-Flywheels and only gear i know is the 3d printed gears.  Would love 15mm gear option in aluminum.

Ride this beast and let us know!

I have to admit having access to a drill press is essential for modifying the pulley. The pulleys I used you can find on ebay. Just type in htd 5m. There's really only one that I found on ebay that you can really use and that's the 40t one.  With the pulley you'll have to enlarge the center bore (for bearing removal) and drill / tap for mounting.  And obviously a spacer will be needed to take up the off set of these wheels to mount this pulley. I made mine from aluminum stock. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/3/130f115159964cc4f115f1ae165a3042293b5851.jpg" width="640" height="428">

Perhaps in the future :smiley:. Would need more real estate for 12s. The specs on this motor on 12s would produce 4200w.
