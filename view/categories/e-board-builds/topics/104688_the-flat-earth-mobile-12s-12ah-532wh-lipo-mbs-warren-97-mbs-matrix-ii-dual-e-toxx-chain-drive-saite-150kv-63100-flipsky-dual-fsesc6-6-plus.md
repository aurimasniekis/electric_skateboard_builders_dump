Hi all,

I wanted to share my build. This is the first custom board I have built and my first time experimenting with a project like this; much of the inspiration has come from previous builds posted on these forums so I figured I would contribute and put mine out there as well!

The battery enclosure is a waterproof electrical junction box that has been plasti-dipped on the exterior/interior. I made two holes in the side of the box and used two cable gland joints to pass the wires through towards the rear of the board. The box is padded with foam that is glued to the inside and then the LiPos are wired in series to get 12S/12Ah. XT90 connectors were used to link the custom wiring to the battery set up and I wired a battery capacity tester over the batteries in series to get a rough idea of remaining battery life.

I put the junction box in the center of the board and drilled holes dead in the middle of the board to mount the box by the very center to make sure board flex was not going to be a problem. I put foam padding underneath the junction box to try and dampen vibration and make the contact between the board and the box more uniform.

The FSESC was mounted in another plasti-dipped junction box using velcro to secure it on top of a foam pad in the junction box. The battery power wires also force it down so hopefully it does not come loose. I am a bit worried about thermals since the heatsink of the FSESC is not directly mated to any metal/conductor and there is no airflow in the junction box.

I will see how hot the setup gets and possibly add fans for forced air cooling. The FSESC has a built in anti-spark switch which I housed inside another 1" cable gland joint and rigged it coming out the exterior of the junction box for a nice"on/off" switch.

![20191211_200217-min](https://esk8-news-objects.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/original/3X/0/5/0558aa7d973f8b87318c537e93d1278f1f5e443a.jpeg)

Another two 1" cable gland joints are used on the back of the junction box the thread out the motor power/sensor wires from the box. This junction box was raised off the back of the board using rubber door stoppers that are velcroed to the board and then further secured using screws/nuts through the deck. This was to prevent vibration and angle to junction box away from the motors.

The motors are mounted using the e-toxx dual chain drive kit in 8-40 gearing. The motors were ordered custom from alibaba to get the 150kV. I used a mixture of braided sleeving, heat shrink tubing, and wire looms to cover/waterproof the wires throughout the rig and prevent them from being damaged. The whole electrical system is sealed and the connectors are filled with silicon to waterproof the wire inlets so this should be very weatherproof. I have mounted a go-pro mount on the front of the board which accepts a wide variety of battery powered LED lights. I had good luck finding a lot of compatible lights marketed as “underwater go pro LED”.

Hope this helps future builders!

It was roughly in the $2000 USD range. Perhaps even more. A quick calculation:

Batteries: $220
ESC: $280
Motors: $200
Complete Board: $500
9" back tires: $100
Motor Mounts: $360
Batteries Chargers: $60
Battery Enclosure: $40
ESC Enclosure: $25
Wiring/Sheathing: $30
Headlight: $35
Remote: $90
 
And other miscellaneous stuff for a few hundred, plus some of the assembly tools, plus tax. Brings it to over $2000 USD.

Range: Gets about 12 miles on fully charged 12s 12Ah LiPo. I was not just cruising and I was revving and carving the entire time. I probably could get more range by just consistently going a medium speed. Top speed is right around 30mph, which is what the calculator would suggest as well. I got it up to 29, see my first long test ride below.

Upgraded to 9" wheels on the motor side and added final motor bracket as well as removed the rubber risers and mounted back enclosure flat against tail of board:
