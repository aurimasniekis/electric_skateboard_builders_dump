 I have been riding my esk8 for a while on this [deck](https://www.amazon.com/SCSK8-Bamboo-kicktail-Longboard-Skateboard/dp/B004URTVBI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1460509970&sr=8-1&keywords=longboard+deck+only). It has served me well but the deck has absolutely no flex. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/a/7a07d62877db779427f5034a921eb5e6d6579449.JPG" width="690" height="481">

I recently purchased a Loaded Vanguard flex 3, so I need to do a split enclosure setup to account for its flex. I already have a perfect case for my Vesc and my receiver, but I have had a lot of trouble trying to find the perfect plastic box for my batteries.

I want to use plastic boxes instead of making a custom enclosure out of fiberglass because I will need to be able to easily open it after every ride to recharge my batteries. 

I am using 4,  3S 5Ah lipos, wired together to make one 6S 10Ah battery. The minimum size box I can use to fit everything is a 5.5" x 6.5" x 2.5"
The maximum size (that I could fit on the vanguard) is about 7" x 8.5" x 4" Ideally I'd like for the box to be as small as possible though.

I have spent hours searching the internet, so far I have found a few boxes that could work but are slightly too big

**If anyone has any recommendations on boxes or where I could look online, I will greatly appreciate it! I am trying to make this board last for a while!**

If you can spring it, I would go with any of the reputable enclosure makers on the forum, or grab a few sheets of kydex and start watching videos
