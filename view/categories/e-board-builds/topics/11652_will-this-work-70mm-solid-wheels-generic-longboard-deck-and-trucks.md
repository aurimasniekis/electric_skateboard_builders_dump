I measures the motors KV to be something around 270. Its 63mm diameter.  It gave me like 50Km/hr top speed with a direct friction drive on another vehicle I will not talk about here.  I think it's in Delta, so I can change it to Wye to get around 160 Kv.

This esc is good to 6s but I have a VESC coming in soon. 

Doesn't look like the motor mounts Ive seen around will fit my trucks... I have a router that I will cut some custom mount, if possible. 

Im heavy, like 100 kg and will not climb much, 40Km would be nice.  Single drive for lower cost. 15mm belt I guess? 

Batteries are not an issue, I can assemble pretty much any voltage with all the Lipos I have lying around here. 

Really worried about the VESC dying on me... I want to keep it safe. I've read stuff 1000 times and am not confident on what to do not to destroy the DRV.

I think you didn't understand @ScottyB , if I mount the trucks on the underside I will have a bit more clearance for the batteries and motor. Not????? of course at the expense of stability.

I have a board with drop through trucks and they are designed like that. If you want more clearance I would recommend topmount trucks (trucks like on skateboards). Just make sure you get longboard trucks because my friend made the mistake of buying skate board trucks for his longboard before.

I think what I wrote is a bit misleading. The motor was used as friction drive on a different vehicle, actually it had a 50 mm regular skateboard wheel attached to it driving a big wheel. It would equal to having  50mm wheels with a 1:1 gearing. On 6s with an 80amp ESC on BLheli the thing just screamed... dangerous because of no brakes though... LOL

For sure, or else how would someone be able to get them in there :open_mouth: Thanks for the replies. :wink: @torqueboards has already hooked me up with a VESC now am really excited to get this thing ready.  There is a great place to ride here in Rio on the olympic boulevard. Long stretches and no cars.

The ride along Rio sounds awesome and really jealous!  

That board looks like it's got some miles!  A quick re-grip and i'm sure it's ready for a lot more.  I would keep an eye around the mounts as i see some cracks - also being a heavy guy make sure it's not stressed and may fail on you at speed (that would suck).

If you are able to make your own mounts - this will be pretty straight forward for you.

Clearance for the motor mount likely will mean you need to move your trucks to bottom mount under the deck.  Even if everything else clears the clamp portion of the mount usually sits right where it's in the way.  It'll depend on your trucks for sure and not being there it may not, but i bet it will be tight or hit at lean.  

I would suggest Aluminum vs Fiberglass for the motor mount portion of your mount.  Aluminum will be stronger, and conduct heat from the motor (acts as heatsink) helping it cool a bit more.  Enertion uses a carbonfiber mount on one of theirs, but it's also pretty beefy (and doesn't aid in cooling).  I'm not sure GF/FG is up to the job strength-wise.

Especially the thin sections at the clamp/rotate side - those thin interior walls i would be *very* suspicious of and imagine they are an early failure point of GF.

Wheels - you'll have to drill through the eurothane to mount your wheel gear.  Being only 70mm they are a bit small so you will have less ground clearance under the belt/gear.  You can run a lower tooth wheel gear to help clear - but this will also equal less torque/start-up speed and acceleration, and poor hill performance.  Maybe not an issue on the flats in Rio - but the hills will be a problem - especially for a bigger guy.

The duro of those wheels at 80 is going to be hard - so a lot of bump/vibration will be transfered.  Not a huge deal, but on long rides you may feel it and be tougher to ride for longer distances/time.  Especially if riding on rougher roads.  Bigger and softer always helps, but if you are trying to stay within a budget, or just use what you have vs ordering something new - i think it'll work for the first try.  You may upgrade later to get it to ride better, softer, etc.

If you have some fabrication skills and can work with epoxy (assuming so since you talk about making GF mount) - take a look at whitepony, okp, and others who recess the batteries into the bottom of the board.  18650 cells are only 19mm(ish - vary a bit) - so really can be a great option.  But you'll need to reinforce and protect them (like any battery really).  

Look forward to pics of the project - and pics of your ride through Rio!

Best of luck!

wow @sl33py thx for pointing me in the right direction. 

yes, it has some miles LOL, the hills are incredible... but getting old for that sh17. 

while I have already pulled all the grip, might as well give it some glass both sides, since im putting the trucks on the underside, I'll cover up the mount holes before, giving it some extra beef... great you touched on this point. 

yeah the board is on the rough side for my regular streets,  are softer wheels less efficient? not that I care really.
I wont fool myself, hill climbing in Rio is gonna take 2 motors for sure. 

I would love to make the mount all aluminum, but Id have to buy 2 different gauges cause I dont want to cut too much. Got 10mm alu on my way already for the grip. The motor has been run hard with GF mount and had no issues. I don't fabricate the GF, I buy 2 and 3 mm boards and cut them up on the router, piece of cake ( wait for wheel pulley ;) ) 

Ive found these wheels locally that I can think of later:

there like 90 bucks here. I didnt find any chinese wheels with spokes/holes locally. :frowning: 

will it help to freeze the wheels before drilling? or nvr mind??

i have soooooo many lipos at home... bunch of 3s 2200 bunch of 4s 3300, a pair of 6s 10.000. and another 6s 12.000 haha. all used in good condition.

With the help of mr @JuniorPotato93 for the design  I routed the wheel pulley out of 3 x 3mm GF plates.   faster than printing and way more resistant.

Motor detection works well hurray. Using my handy 24v headlight lamp current limiter with integrated switch, I have saved MANY electronics with this little device, I always use it to power up things the first time, case something goes wrong ( I have the bad habit to solder stuff with reverse polarity LOL ). 


noticed also it doesnt play a tune during startup like all other ESCs  :disappointed:  was expecting something cool like star wars

Aaaaaand the VESC is history.

IDK how... I rode it for some 10 min the other day NP. Today while pushing the board unpowered ( just a couple of meters ) I felt the brakes kick in.. not good. IDK if this is the cause but... I dint read anything about pushing the board.

Sine I dont have a car RC controller, wired ADC to some handheld nunckuck.

when I powered it... motor no go. oh my.

Pretty sure the pushing board upowered did the trick, so I would definitely advise against it.

I read a post on here about pushing while switched off. And some said yes you could kill the vesc. If you have the vesc switched on and pushing it should be fine as long as the battery isn't full as the regen braking will transfer the power back to the battery. Unsure on what part blows but someone on here may be able to tell you what may have gone.

Using a Caslte Creations Phoenix 80 HV esc. Man I miss the VESC... it's really night and day difference. can't live w/o it. 

Check out my anti spark solution while the xt90S doesn't arrive. :slight_smile:

Also, while remote doesn;t arrive,  running wired nunchuck with custom arduino sketch I wrote to get cruise control. Works pretty well. Brakes when the cord is pulled or let go off the button.

Got some miles on the board today. It's riding very nicely and tomorrow I will do a 3K commute to meet a friend at a gas station to drive to our drone testing facility. 

Very happy with the build. I'm spoiled, I really NEED my vesc back. The DRV's should be arriving next week sometime.  Other than that, she rides nicely with plenty of torque and pretty good hill climbing ability... I wouldn't imagine needing a twin motor for now... but that might change with time. 

Thank you all for the tips and help.
