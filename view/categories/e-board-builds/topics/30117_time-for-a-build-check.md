I don't think your battery of 5ah will get you 20mile range . Having fast and long distance board doesn't come cheap :(

```
so are you doing a 5s build? because to get 10,000mah you will have to put them in parallel.(long range slow top speed). and if you put them in series it is only 5000mah.(faster speed shorter range) if i were u buy a battery for @oriol360 12s2p it is $200 but is worth it it comes with a charger and everything u need because it is only like $50 more.

Well you should probably read up more on series and parallel you will only get like 10 miles from those batteries

Also the switch that you picked will blow out because it is rated for 5v-12v

Because the batteries are to powerful as in to high of a voltage

You could have just let it stay way in the backlog... It already died, and you resurrect it 9 months later just to ask for it to be deleted?
