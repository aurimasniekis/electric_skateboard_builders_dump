Greetings from Ireland,

Just want to post my first diy eskate built. I bought most of the parts over the last year and finally finished it. If you have questions I'm more than happy to answer them. I printed the pulleys in PETG with a gearing of 15-40, the motor pulley is still holding up fine but I'm ordered already a metal one just to be on the save side.
