**Please suggest a name too... I just can't decide, lol**

It's been a while since I first started talking about this build, but now that I *finally* have all the parts, here's the finished product! :wink: 

I meant to start this thread in the beginning of the build, and document the process, but I just got lazy...

**The partz:**
Arbor James Kelly Pro Model 
Abec 11 flywheels
Caliber II "raw" trucks
Space Cell
VESC
Enertion Motor mount
Enertion 190kv 6355
GT2B remote

First, check out my "how to take apart a space cell and void your warranty" here: 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/space-cell-opened-up/510
That was how I removed the display, charging port, and power button and built them into the case- it's a relatively easily mod for those who want to take their build even further with flush mounted buttons and stuff.

**Step 1- deck!**

basically chose it because if you haven't figured it out by now, I like wood :grin:

**Step 2- hacking + enertion stuff**

hacking the space cell, as seen in the thread above

mount: http://www.enertionboards.com/diy-electric-skateboard-kits/enertion-single-motor-mount-kit/

**step- VESC**
getting a VESC from @chaka, who I highly recommend doing business with

*Now here is where the fun begins...* 

I just want to say right off the bat that *I did not make this wood case*- I know a carpenter quite well, and he is a woodworking genius. Long story short, after showing him the project I was embarking on, he offered to build the box that I specified. He also said he was up for doing more in the future so this might be my source of boxes on coming projects.. that is, until I buy an X-carve that I want so much :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: 

Here is what he made for me (I am so grateful because I don't think I could have pulled off something this good!)

from there, I laid out the components, and got to work making sure everything fit

Then to stain the top lid. I stained it maple, which is what I thought would be closest to the arbor deck. I obviously don't have the same wood, and the grain is much less intense, but the color is as close as it can get.

this picture is a couple minutes after the first coat of stain. I ended up doing two. I then sealed it with a couple coats of polyurethane, and light sanding between coats.

**Now just some final product photos!** I want to put a logo on the top of the enclosure at some point, but I just don't know what it'll be...

I will switch over to the new CF motor mount and re-route the wires around the back of the truck once I'm done with my science fair solar eboard- Won first place with it, and am moving on for those who were wondering about that too..

If you have any questions just post'em up! I'm really loving the two tone wood theme :smile:

Looks nice! Is there any protection on the lighter wood? Or is it raw?

Yep, the lighter wood got the same protection- the whole enclosure is sealed, but I can open it by unscrewing the maple lid.

I wish arbor put their signature clear grip and wood top, but for al their downhill boards it's just some standard griptape: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/10582b1904ea401b6bb1e2ea04d1d911b418cd53.jpg" width="666" height="500">

@cmatson that grip tape is terrible. It's covered in a grid of pinholes and never wants to let go of bubbles. I'm totally tossing it and using liquid from now on because my deck art doesn't come through well enough.

Well ... the cheapest way is to smash a glass bottle up and mix it in with some polyurethane varnish. *edit* please be really careful doing this though... getting some in your eye or your hands really sucks.

Also @cmatson i just re-read the thread and realized i totally missed where you said you were moving up in the science fair. Congratulations bro!

Also, a thread about how to smash the bottle leftovers from all of that delicious real sugar Coca-cola from Mexico into grip for your beautiful diy boards is coming soon.

Here's a pic of what that grip tape does. Its crap. The top of that board is black with red art. Not grey with a grid of white dots.

Yep, @lox897 is right.

I took apart an enertion space cell, and that's how I got the voltage display, power button, etc all mounted up. 

Also, you'll have to forgive me but I won't get any diagrams posted up until tomorrow... right now I'm on a 10 hour car ride home after spending Christmas with some family.

There is a thread about it here

Merry Christmas and happy holidays then! :smile: hope you had a good one
i just saw that link of all the pictures you took when taking the cell apart
its great, but still a bit messy for me :) i will try to understand from the picture how the build works.
but if you will have a diagram in the future would be much easier for me and for the rest
thanks again for all the info!
