So this is my second build and parts are starting to arrive, I thought I'd do a build thread to try and help others looking for an affordable diy option.




So far I have gotten the esc and 97mm clones. Both of these parts I ordered form @dickyho and have arrived form China within 2 weeks. Now that is just amazing service, the parts were also very well packaged and I am very happy with the quality and price. Thanks Dicky :+1: 

I also sanded down and wrapped the bottom of the cheap eBay deck in carbon fibre vinyl, it looks great and costs less than $3

Parts List:
2 x 3s 5000mah lipos into diy swappable battery pack - $55

Turnigy Skateboard trucks (idk the quality just thought I'd give them a try because they have a square hanger) - $45

2 x 6354 195kV Keda motors - $110

Dual Ebay Esc - $85

97mm 78a flywheel clones - $60

Cheap eBay deck (sanded and wrapped) - already had

Homemade 3mm steel motor mounts  ~$20

eBay chain drive kits - $31

Battery Medic (Hobby King) - $15

Misc ~ $50 - 60

Total - $500ish

(All costs are in Australian dollars)

I'll keep this updated when more parts arrive

Last night I had a go at building the swappable battery enclosure. It has turned out rather well.

All I need to do now is sand it down and wrap it in carbon fibre to match the deck

Looks pretty good ! I might do quite the same shape but with aluminium, I fear that wood isn't resistant enough. I've seen a picture of a screw or nail that got all the way into the enclosure, happened while riding. I don't want that to happen to my battery enclosure.

You can get rid of most air bubbles by making a tiny hole with a sharp end of a blade (to allow air to escape) and then pressing on the bubble. I did this on mine and I remove all bubbles.

Everything seems to work fine, the brakes on the esc at high speeds are very hard but hopefully my 2:1 gear ratio helps to reduce the force a little. I will be making the motor mount arm out of some 3.2mm steel this afternoon and using a bit of wood for the mounting piece just to test. I will go and get some scrap Alu later in the week. So far so good üòÜ

If you want to wire it in parallel all positives connect together and all negatives connect together. The balance leads can also be connected together using an adapter from HobbyKing or soldering them

Everything seems to work fine it hadit's first test ride today and the esc kept beeping at me for some reason ( I guess, low voltage?) I'll charge it up in the morning and see how it goes

I finished the mounts for now, I spent about a day and a half filing, using a hacksaw and drilling them all by hand. Later in the week I will get some paint and file them smooth and round then paint them black

Here's a picture of the mounts, they clamp on really tight to the square HobbyKing truck hangers. They have three slots in the side that the bolts from the mounting arm bolt onto, this also give an adjustable angle

Thats all for now, I will try and update again soon with some specs like speed, range and ride quality

So here's my review of this board. It's f*ing fast. I hit 47km/h today on some nice smooth roads. The board is more or less finished and just needs a few little appearance upgrades (ie finish the carbon wrap, paint the mounts and sand n grip the top of the deck. Apart from that the board is in its final form


This is a list of parts I would recommend:

Keda motors, not the most powerful motors but great bang for ya buck. I have tried both the 6364 and 6356. Both are great deals and have plenty of power for me to ride 97mm wheels on a 2:1 ratio and still climb hills.



Next up is the Dual esc. It definitely isn't he smoothest esc in terms of acceleration and brakes but once you get used to it, it's awesome. The power of the acceleration from standstill to full throttle in fast mode is crazy. I don't have a heat sink on mine and it hasn't overheated in the 4 rides I've gone on, although I don't have many hills where I live


97mm wheels from @dickyho, these wheels are the size they are claimed to be but not too sure about the duro? They are fine for me and have helped a lot with the rough roads and getting some extra top speed. I can't complain at all with these wheels as they cost me $60 and arrived in less than a week


3s 5000mah lipos 30c, decent batteries as usual, great for the price 


Last of all the HobbyKing trucks. Now I know lots of people don't like these trucks but for people that weigh less than 140lbs like myself I think they are very good for the price, although I haven't tried any other trucks apart from clones. They have a good turning radius and and a stable at higher speeds too. The only thing I dislike is the bushings make a squeaking noise which is a pita.


Things I don't recommend:

Making your enclosures out of wood and holding it together with hot glueüòÇ Doesn't go well


The chain drive kit from eBay. It is an OK set for the price but it has its problems. Doesn't fit flywheels with out lots of modifications, only one grub screw on the motor pulley and the chain is a little bit short. Apart from that it works rather, well with no slip 


The last thing I wouldn't recommend is the IMAX B6 charger. It's a great charger and works well but it takes a long time to charge 6s lipos. Just over two hours to charge 5000mah lipo packs. If you don't mind charge time get it, if you want it done fast DON'T

Here are some pictures of the final product

Guys I need some help, my motor mount keep coming loose. The mount arm is joined to the clamp piece by three m4 bolts. I have already loctited and double nylon nutted the sh!t out of them. The little pieces of sh!t just keep coming loose, not loose that they will fall off or anything, but after my ride tonight when I got home there is a little bit of wiggle on one of the mounts (does it really matter much?) any one got better ideas?

Ps: I can't weld them, arm is steel, clamp is alu. Well I don't think I can atleast

Some updates to the enclosure:

Oh and something else I don't reccommend is building your enclosure from wood and sticking it together with hot glue. Just buy a plant pot saucer like I did for $4. Oh I almost forgot I added a heat sink to the esc as well, it didn't need it but I though it might just be a good idea

I also added some lights to the board because I like to ride at night when there isn't as many cars and it's nice and cool

How did you go about sticking the vinyl down? Did it adhere well to the board or did you need to use some other sort of adhesive?

Yeah your right it is very low to the ground, maybe 1" clearance. I wanted to move it up more but I am unable to due to one of the bolts not being able to slide back further. It's kinda hard to explain what I mean but that was as high as I could get it. Also even if I could get it any higher I would only be able to by about 1cm and then it would hit the base plate.


@faithfulpuppy, yeah I could try that but I would also like to be able to get it back apart

Yes, I have a board with this motor and I can easily do 40Km/h and I get about 15-20Km range depending on how I ride. You would need a bigger battery though maybe 10s4p, you would need to work it out

Does the 10s influence the range a lot, or could I also use 6s or 8s? Or would I then not be able to hit the 15/20mph

## \#49 Posted by: pat.speed Posted at: 2018-07-01T10:41:19.358Z Reads: 95

```
It all depends, range is based on Wh which is nominal voltage times Ah. For example my battery is 10s and 5Ah so 36x5= 180Wh and the general rule is about 10Wh per Km but that depends how fast you ride.

To work out the speed use this calculator
