Hey guys! I'm a first time e-board builder and I just wanted some input and advice on my build so far. At this point my components are: 

Motor: diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/motor-6374-190kv-3150w/
Pulley system: http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/12mm-wide-pulley-drive-hub-kit/
Wheels: http://www.enertionboards.com/buy-build-your-own-electric-skateboard-parts/83mm-enertion-power-wheels/
Controller: http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/nano-x-enertion-2-4ghz-controller/
Batteries: (2x) https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-8000mah-3s1p-30c-lipo-pack.html
VESC: diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/

My only concerns are compatibility and optimization of parts, and whether or not it will be powerful enough to go around town and even uphill for any extended period of time. Any feedback or help would be greatly appreciated!
