I would like to see if there would be interested in a competition on ESk8 to develop and build a custom board for **$500 dollar prize** that I will place in escrow prior to start of competition. 

Rules and voting for the winning board would be developed by the ESk8 community‚Ä¶my initial idea is  materials must be less than $1,000 or maybe $1,500. The community votes on top 3 build concepts that would be in the final build-off. The board that wins I would have an option to purchase for the material cost + prize money. I think this could be interesting. What do you think? I am open to your ideas on budget or prize amount or overall competition concepts? Who is the the **best DIY Builder** as voted by the forum?

Are you up to the challenge?

Thanks,
Kevin

I think this is the [esk8.builders](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders) forum

Sure, I'm up for the challenge. Sub - $1500

One Lehner outrunner. 
Motor mount. DIYed and 3d printed.
Deck. Just some spare wood.
Trucks. 3d printed. 
Bushings. I'd use my old ripped caliber stock bushings. Can't find any other use of them anyways. If they don't fit, I'd just 3d print bushings. 
Remote. I'll just have an on and off stitch. No signal drop outs. 
Batteries. Going with the old AAs because availability and wouldn't need charger. 
ESC. Soon enough someone will put one up for grabs in the freebie thread. 
Risers. Please advise. Don't want wheelbite! 
Wheels, bearings, wires, connectors also from the freebie thread. I love that thread!
Edit, almost forgot to add springs because of new tech and no more wobbles! 

Total cost ; 

Lehner motor 1225 usd
3d printing filament 10 usd
Skateboard stabilizer springs. 200 usd
Batteries 20 usd
(If you guys offer free) shipping 0 usd

All comes down to 1455 usd

Good luck, guys! 

(PM me on where to send the 500 usd!)

I see what you have done.  But I think if we were to have a skateboard build-off we have some really good opportunities to give back to some family members who lost loved ones recently (Derek and Randy).  

What does that look like? To me it looks like a competition build off with a raffle.  In addition to this forum there are multiple FB groups with thousands of members.  While few will drop big dollars on a custom board, plenty would spend a few dollars on a raffle ticket or two for a good cause.

The pro builders do this every day, take $1000-1500 materials and with love and labour turn about another 1k off it. So I doubt they want to jump into this 'competition', it would be a net loss.

And then there are the duct tape people, they want in this competition.

You're probably best waiting for a nice board to come up for sale, they go from time to time. With a budget of ‚Ç¨1500 you could get a really nice esk8

Allen,

I like where you are going with this and would be interested in hearing your ideas for build-off raffle to give back to the lost members of this community.  How would you structure the competition? I also would suggest that all monies be held be trusted member or admin of the forum as I am not looking to benefit in anyway other than to see what this community can do...

This competition should be about creativity and innovation and duct tape is always welcome as it is a staple in my opinion...

I was also thinking all builds must be documented from start to finish so the community could see the process as it happens and weight in on ways to make improvements. This should not be about taking an already built board and submitting it.

i probably wouldn't enter since i literally do this professionally and this is something that i think should be left to talented enthusiasts. 

Also i'd be fool if started thinking i was the best builder out there. There are people i find all the time that i have plenty to learn from, and i do. Got to stay real and remember where you come from.

I am trained in the art of taping valuable exposed electronics to the bottomside of the board with nothing more than Home Depot-sourced adhesives. I have set off countless redflags at the TSA line at the airport. It is not just a skill, but a lifestyle.

You see this board I built here?

Some may call it "cleaner", but I call it boring.

eSk8 Community,

The new concept behind this competition is not about the guys that do this professionally everyday it is about the small guy in his home shop with a big idea. I have received many messages from the professional builders that are very supportive and would like to see the creativity of this community expressed in a build.  Yes maybe there is some duct tape but maybe also there is an application of new material technologies or new electronics or new designs.  I see everyone going to the same sources however these all started with an idea and a passion to find a way to make them possible. Who is excited about demonstrating some creativity and innovation?  as I am one looking to see it!!

Well I have quite a few simple but significant ideas I want to put at play for my boards. I'm down for a competition judged solely on innovation rather than precision.

That is what I am thinking....we are a large body to of cutting edge DIY enthusiast...I am not meaning any offense to the professional builders in this community however we and they are still plagued with adoption / adaption of products to meet the eSK8 needs...Motors, truck hangers, board deck design, power sources etc, I would like to see the creativity of this community take products to the next level...
Just my thoughts,

Kevin

My bet would be on @longhairedboy and if he abstained like he said...then either @whitepony or @okp. That said, there are several really talented enthusiasts on this forum. I‚Äôd be willing to kick down $10 - $20 just to see what they come up with.

The three I mentioned are simply the three I‚Äôve stolen ideas from most often. Of those three, @whitepony is only one that doesn‚Äôt get paid to build boards. He just builds top notch boards for his own use and enjoyment, but I totally agree, the more the merrier. 

Like I said before, I‚Äôd love to see what people can come up with and would be willing to back my curiosity with a small donation towards the winners prize.

Are there rules for custom parts for ex. Carbon fiber, fiber glass, CNCed parts?

Also there should be awards such as Duct tape master, most innovative, most extreme looking, etc.

@ksfacinelli I don't see the skin in the game here to initiate something like this.

If you're a whale and buying for a mid-life crisis or 'personnel of the month'  then go ahead and commission the dream board off of the many good builders on the forum for $2500+, but expect to pay what you should pay.

If you're done any reading you know who they are & know what they are capable and the style of their work. As a work commisioner you have signoff on the ongoing build as you would expect

If you've come in here and expect folks to plough money into a build which may not be sold at all & if they are lucky to win then they get $500 for labour ,it simply won't come about as you expect, nor should it

You may get offered already some already built buttboards for this 'inducement'.

In essence, stop being cheap, you're better than that probably

I'd be down for judging. OR being on a panel of judges of professional or industry builders. 

Honestly i don't think anyone who builds professionally should participate because then it will just be harder for me to poach talent later.
