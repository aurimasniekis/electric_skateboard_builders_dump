This is a build i'm starting today. This is separate from my 10S build that will be coming soon, which was the result of our recent group buy on cells. 

I was approached by a man with money and asked to build the most powerful board i can. This will be it. The turnaround will be three to four weeks, so GAME ON!

**Deck** 
LHB Scarlet Black Metal Edition deck with machine cut wire channels (@cmatson will be doing my channels for cold hard cash). I'm going to be using West System 105/207 resin on these channels for a glass clear potting. Inside the channels i'll be using a red velvet fabric wet out with resin on the floor and walls of the channel, red wires, and polished solder points, then filling it over with resin, sanding smooth and polishing to a glass finish. The rest of the deck will be stained black, not painted. Red nebula background under the black LHB logo. Crushed glass grip on top to let everything show through. It's going to be the most gorgeous fucking deck on the planet. 

**Power System** 
12S4P using Samsung INR18650-25R 2500mah cells for a total of around 430 watt hours, which should provide over 25 miles of range based on my personal experience with higher watt hour packs. My 6S 350 gets me 20 miles within safe discharge range. This one should still be cruising with a bag of skittles at the 20 mile mark. 

Onboard BMS for simple charging, going to try and find a nice 4 or 5 amp charger so its not slow as christmas but also not filling the cells too fast. Opinions on this are welcome of course. Higher amp dedicated chargers cost more, and are often equipped with fans making them noisy, but i don't want a terribly slow charge either. BMS will have soft switch functionality, but if it acts stupid like some of them do i might end up getting one from DIY anyway. 

**Drive System**
Ollin Vescs, Enertion motors, mounts and pulleys, but i reserve the right to use my newly acquired Evolve pulleys which are a 33 tooth HTD-5M and come in black, but will have to be modified for a 9mm belt drive system. This also means modified Caliber II trucks which i just made a video about. Most likely i'll be using the black out trucks if i can't find a black silk finish. I swear i saw some of those. So some of that extra 12S torque will go into that slightly smaller pulley than the 36T i usually use, so we should see some more top end. 

**Box**
Since I'm ordering the West 105/207 for the extra luxurious wiring channels, i'm going to use it on the box too because i would be a fool not to. I'll most likely do a three layer box with two layers of fiberglass weave and possibly either a dyed GF layer or even a CF layer on the outside, i haven't decided yet. 


I'll be posting as i get it done, most likely to instagram first and then here. Get ready for some glorious esk8 porn!

**update**
customer wanted matching wheels so i gave him $40 bucks back and got him some clones which i think ride better than those hard ass abecs.

My plan is to get an 80 amp continuous bms and limit the current in the vescs to 80 amps or maybe even 75 and see how it goes. its a 4P using 25Rs which have a stated sustained 20Amp discharge each with a 100amp burst each, so i'm limiting at the vesc and allowing the BMS a little breathing room while getting the most out of the cells without going out of spec. 

That's my hope anyway.

@longhairedboy this is awesome thanks for sharing the process from start to finish! I love that you and @cmatson are teaming up! 

I've gotta say that I'm similarly side-eyed about the Bestech BMS on\off switch. So I'll follow with anticipation as you get it sorted out. 

Also, if you really want to treat this customer, give him a modded GT2B... the ebay enclosure I just used is beautiful and comes in black.

Set that bms to 90 amps, still lower than the cells can handle during burst currents but high enough not to trigger under heavy acceleration.

didn't get finished sanding last night, but i did get a glimpse of what the layout will look like. 

was laying out the cells for my 10S4P pack for another build on this deck to see what 12S4P looks like on a 27" wheelbase. Here it is:

https://www.instagram.com/p/BEcojSIBBvt/?taken-by=longhairedboy

So this deck can take 12S4P in a single layer of 18650 cells with 2 rows of 24 if the VESCs and BMS float over them towards the back by the phase lead terminals, which means a nice thin box can still be had. And since its 9 ply i can probably make a nice flat spot for the cells without adding any flex.

I guess we'll find out. He's got a few of them already, and i believe he's also waiting on a Raptor, so maybe he's a pro. I sure hope so. I'd hate to hand him the keys and watch him tree his face. 

I have found that a lot of people just have no idea what to expect from a boutique high performance esk8 like mine or Jason's, even after they've ridden some of the more decent commercial options. They toss out speeds like 25mph because boosted or whoever tops out at that, and really have no idea what 25mph feels like because they've never really topped the board out completely or never actually achieved that speed because of their weight or what-have-you, and don't yet know that 25mph is actually pretty damned fast on a board and that when you start approaching 30 on flats things can get scary. They have no idea what face peeling acceleration feels like when riding 10S or 12S and despite thinking they have a basis of comparison, they really don't. 

We like to compare it to downhill skating a lot because of the speeds we achieve and the methods we employ such as larger wheels and flatter, thicker decks and of course the gear we wear is similar if not the exactly same. But its not really like downhill when you can accelerate way faster than gravity would let you, hit the brakes any time you want, and accelerate out of turns like a race car. 

 If he's never ridden a Raptor or anyone's DIY board before, he's going to shit his leathers on a tuned 12S like this one. 

One of these days i'm going to build one so powerful that the customer has to destroy it because the world isn't ready yet, but i think @chaka  might be closer to that than I am. That crazy 12s6p power plant he's got buried in his deck is just ludicrous.

Purchasing of parts has started happening. Hit up amazon for most of the hardware. 83mm Flywheel clones, 184mm Caliber Balck Out 50s, Bones reds bearings, red 0.5" shock risers, red 1.5" bolts. 

Also picked up some stuff for now and later, got some West Systems 105/207 coming, 50ft of 12awg superworm, 30 feet of 10awg superworm, 1 billion craft popscicle type sticks for mixing shit in souffl√© cups, and some SMD led light strips on reels and a 30watt LED driver for workspace lighting as i am also building a second bench this weekend on top of everything else.

Got a BMS and a 4Amp 12S ebike charger from batterysupports along with a decent 12S BMS

Just ordered the VESCs and a power switch and the cells are next on the list.

Hi LHB, 
First of all congrads on your work. I'm really looking fwd to see your masterpiece comming along.
I have a quick question. Do the caliber II 50 need any modification (like the one you have demonstrated in your video) in order to accomodate the enertion motor mount and the new enertion nylon wheel puley with flywheels?

yes. I forget off the top of my head how many millimeters it is of aluminum that you need to take off, but i think i mention it in my thread i posted with the video. IT will be slightly different for Enertion pulleys than Evolve pulleys thoough so you'll need to measure it. @onloop may be able to tell you since he had the hangers modified for them. Also, if you ever decide to do that, pay attention to how i remove the chunk of aluminum after "feeling" my way to the steel with the cutting wheel. It will save you some time and effort. 

I ordered the enertion 9mm pulleys for this build, but i may still modify my Evolve pulleys simply because they're black. I haven't decided yet. If i can find a way to cleanly remove about 6 or 7mm of belt surface from each of them while leaving a polished look, I'll do it. 

Also i just ordered 2 yards of carbon fiber, twill weave, because i feel like my experience with glass fiber cloth and polyester resin (that means Bondo) has taught me enough to do this with CF and have a clean result. 99% of this shit is technique, and usually moving into better materials makes using those techniques easier, so i should actually get better results than i have been. West 207 is a slower hardener, which means more working time which is a great thing, but it also means curing to full strength is going to take several days and not just several hours, which for my impatient ass will be an irritant, but not really a bad thing.

I just ordered a roll of 85mm heat shrink, which will be one cell wide. My plan is to heat shrink each row of cells separately, bond them at the ends, then heat shrink the whole pack with some 150mm tube if it arrives here on time. If not i'll just have two rows joined by a short 10awg wire. the 85mm tube was available in the US but the 150mm tube is only available form hong kong on ebay at a ridiculously low price, but it will likely take 10 years to get here. 

Of course i spent the time to find and purchase the RED shrink tubing because it will add 20% additional performance to the pack, basically making it a 12S5P equivalent.

Got some things done this weekend as a few of the more basic items arrived in the mail. Trucks, bearings, hardware, and wheels all showed up Saturday and I had some Evolve pulleys sitting around waiting for something so i thought i would get the drive wheels set up.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BEjhwnBhBpF/?taken-by=longhairedboy

I chopped the eveolve pulleys down to 9mm using a carbide tipped 10" chop saw. I put the pulley into one of my old flywheels and used a belt to mark the width in red pain pen all around the belt surface. Then i set up a fence on my chop saw and slowly went through it like butter. No melting, so no irreular edges. IT came out looking factory. 
  
https://www.instagram.com/p/BEl-RWtBBiT/?taken-by=longhairedboy

Then i did that trick i do with the caliber II hanger and my dremel. I took 18mm of aluminum off of each side of the hanger. This took me about an hour and if you do this, use the larger reinforced cutting wheels, not the smaller ones that shatter every 5 minutes. 
https://www.instagram.com/p/BEma1cXBBrH/?taken-by=longhairedboy

after taking off that aluminum you have to sand the axle a little because of the different texture on it that's inside the hanger. The bearings won't quite slip over it, so you have to sand it down a bit. 

Also, the teeth of the hub that fit into the spokes of the wheel are very precisely made for ABEC 11 Flywheels, not clones. I had to use the cutting wheel again to shave down the sides of the teeth so that i could press these guys into the wheel. Even after doing that though, they're tight and took a bit of force to get in there so they're nice and snug. The final result is rather stunning:

Also this weekend I finished shaping the deck and drilled for trucks:

I hereby present the Conical Guide to Esk8 Color Palettes:

**Red:** Fastest Color available. Increases speed by 20-30%

**Black:** The Roughest Color: Black increases torque by up to 40%, and improves stick, acorn, and squirrel-crushing ability 

**Orange:** Provides the deepest carving action, 15% more surfy

**Green:** The smoothest color; green is silent and mellow, reduces speed by 10% and noise by 25%

**Blue:** Rock-solid and reliable, adds 35% more to lifespan of any component

Thanks bro. I spent almost a year developing my press and process. I've got it down to about 2 total hours of labor per deck at this point. Gluing and tossing in the press is about 20 minutes, cutting, sanding and drilling truck holes is about an hour and a half-ish. There's a few of these Scarlets in the wild now, and the reports i've received back is that they're just as tough and take as much or more abuse as factory decks.  

I built the first press...
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/so-i-pressed-a-deck-this-weekend/359

and then i built the one i'm using now because the first one broke:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/monster-clamp-ii-building-a-new-deck-press-because-i-broke-the-other-one/568

Including the cost of the mold and enough veneer for 10 7ply or even 9ply decks, this can be done for less than a grand. I spent a tad more than that because i was in uncharted territory building my own press instead of buying one for $5000, so i wasted some veneer and obviously an entire press's worth of wood and hardware when it exploded making my first successful deck pressing.

makes room on the hanger for those press-in pulleys that have their own bearings. The trucks on the Raptors have been modified at the factory for the Raptor's injection molded pulleys, and Evolve did something similar with theirs. If you want to use either one of those pulleys on regular caliber ii trucks, you have to take off some aluminum.

MOAR CELLS
the 18650's for the 12S build arrived, this time in high performance glossy boxes instead of the regular old not glossy ones. lol

AND SUPERWORM!
I love this shit. I got like 80 feet of this shit between the 10awg and 12awg total. Best wire ever.

and finally.. this came in the mail...

so i can't wait to see what these wire channels are going to look like with this gorgeous clear resin filling them. Also going to be building the boxes with this stuff until i run out, then i expect i'll buy more if i can't get somebody locally to start building my boxes for me. I don't think i can fab my own boxes forever, so i may have to settle on a design that can do up to 12S4P and then use it for 10S builds too.

Did some of this last night:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BEw076CBBrh/?taken-by=longhairedboy

so i could make these:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BEw66PihBlL/?taken-by=longhairedboy

i numbered the balance points on the cells and soldered in some balance leads. i used a paint pen to add on number of dots to the leads in two locations so i would know which was which. Those are 8mm strips, i didn't think that the 4mm strips the welder came with would be good enough to channel all that power Hail Skatan.

then I shrink tubed them:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BExIukIhBu1/?taken-by=longhairedboy

the paint dots on the leads worked out. I can clearly see which is 1 and which is 12. I still have to solder in the big wire jumper between groups 6 and 7 and also solder in the mains and fasten them down. I ordered a roll of that wide shrink tube but its probably not going to be here on time, so there's going to be some taping. 

As soon as the BMS and VESCs arrive i can start making a form for the box. For now the plan is the make it very thin until it gets toward then end of the pack, then i'll have it ramp up in space so that the BMS and VESCs can have some room. 

I'm not sure where the fuel guage is going yet. I sort of want to put it over the front truck so you can look down and see it.

did some more digging. Looks like people are saying i need at least 10mm on there. things i had read before said 8 would be fine. I'm also seeing more and more about people using 15mm like was just mentioned here. 

I think i'm just going to open the packs back up and add another layer of that 8mm nickel to share the load to be safe, that should be effectively the same as having used 16mm from the start. I'll have to redo my balance leads but whatever. I don't want to take any chances. 

I love how one day you look something up and see one thing, then the next you see something else.

i'm planning on joining the two packs with 10awg superworm, the same thing i'm making the mains leads with, and i'm definitely doubling up that nickel tonight. I may even solder along the edges of the two strips to join them better after i get the second ones on.

Gorgeous and quality build LHB - as usual.  I always get a laugh on your posts and some serious dedication building this!  Shop is looking great - congrats!  

Those SMD LED's are awesome!  I just did some over a workbench in my office as well.  The new 5630's claim 25 lumens per LED - about twice as bright as the last ones i got.

I've found soldering before mounting is helpful, but i have done it upside down before i learned...

LOL i'd have to tear them down completely to strip the anodize. I'm not that brave. I know they come apart pretty easy but i wouldn't want to introduce any additional chances for failure by doing so, at least not without trying it out first on my rat board. I have no idea what greased lightning would do to the magnet glue or epoxy or whatever is holding them in the can. 

So i guess i'll just have to take the performance hit and explain to the customer that this board could be faster, but there's blue on the motors slowing him down a little.

minor delay this weekend. Went up to o @cmatson 's robot carving cave this weekend and got some beutiful wire channels dug out of the top and was all excited about it. I got home and set the deck down flat and noticed it was warped.  It was twisted counter clockwise by about 2mm (measured from one edge of the nose, i didn't get the protractor out and see what degree it was exactly) across the entire length of the deck. 

So i threw it away because the customer deserves better than that kind of bullshit. I almost threw it through the garage door in a fit of rage but i decided having a hole in my garage door is probably a bad idea since that's where my shop is.  I have another blank fresh out of the press laying in the house flat on the floor with no twist. I'm going to let it cure for a few days in the air conditioning and see if that has anything to do with it. I'm sure the spike in heat and humidity play a role here and something i did with my 7 plies was leave them in the house for a while and i have had zero warpage on those. I didn't do that with this one because i just wasn't thinking about it, i basically cut it right away and left it out in the garage while i was working on other parts of the build. I won't be doing that again.

@longhairedboy this is helpful for me, I've been trying to sort out which sized nickel (or copper wire) to us to connect the cells. The internet offers, uh, conflicting opinions about this. I'm going to go with 15mm nickel, but I can't seem to find 15mm anywhere.

No. Color makes absolutely no difference in performance whatsoever. Its just a running gag i started years ago and a few people on here have followed along playfully. 

You have no idea how hard it was for me to do the responsible thing and not explain to you in some dry, knowledgable tone how it would make a difference using plenty of big words and confusing language that would have you googling phrases like "400-440 terahertz band" and "red shifting" and "spectral wave distortion" in order to confuse you into stumbling around in my own personal amusement park of humerous mis-information. Don't let anyone tell you i don't exude self control in every moment of my being. I would do just about anything for this community, including behave myself and not be an epic level troll.

@longhairedboy for clarity here, are we talking about pure nickel strips that are **0.1mm** vs **0.15mm** in thickness, or 10mm to 15mm in width. I can find 10mm wide, 0.15mm thick, but that's most robust I'm seeing in any of the regular places.

About nickel strips:

5mm x 0,15mm - 7-8A

yes. I'm talking about 0.15mm pure nickel strips. I couldn't find 15mm widths either. Then @cmatson and i were looking at his torn down space cell this past weekend when i went up there and saw it was using 8mm as well. So does the 60Amp version of the space cell i have on my bench. 

I think until i can find 15mm width of the 0.15mm thickness in the good stuff, i'm just going to double it up like i did on the last two packs i spot welded. The rest of the rig is set up to shut off above 80amps so those cells will never see their burst capacity without triggering limitations, and rarely see their designed continuous capacity of 80amps total across the 4P. They should stay cool and cozy no matter what. 

And even when i do find a reel of 15mm nickel i'll probably still double it up just because.

We need to remember we are only pushing current through short segments so 8mm likely has plenty of headroom on these packs. I use brass busbars because I isolate every cell with a fuse wire and the cell casings no longer share the load like they do in a conventional pack.

when you say cell, do you mean the whole P group or the individual 18650s themselves?

yeah i build my packs in a string now. I line them up, glue them together, then tack the strips on, then solder the balance leads in, then shrink wrap the while thing. I kind of thought what you are saying about the short runs between cells and the caps sharing load was the case all along, but i'm glad to hear you say it. I'm still jumping my individual 6S packs into a 12S with 10awg wire though, and i think i'm going to continue using dual layers of nickel just to make myself feel better as well as create a structurally stronger pack.

I will post a build thread one of these days with my tesla style packs. Basically every cell in a parallel group is individual fused to a brass busbar using nickel coated copper wire. The gauge depends on what type of cells you are using and overall system output. It is extremely time consuming  a bit more expensive and adds zero performance gain so it is a tough call to make when all it does is add a level of redundancy to the already internally fused cells.

I should read around here more often - these forums here are much better organized compared to ES and I like the user name tags - was seeing mine pop up in my user profile, pretty cool! :sunny: 

anyway, about that serial connection thing: yes, the resistance of a connection scales linearly with its length, but the outer serial connections are quite long connections. I think its not very consequent to use for example 10AWG main battery connections with 5mm bullet connectors and single 8mm serial nickel strips that are supposed to carry all the current the battery has to deliver. remember: every serial connection carries the same total current, so youll always have "amount of serial connections" times your losses!

when I used the copper reinforcements on my 10S4P and 10S6P batteries, they were made to carry the exact same currents all the other elements of the chain have to carry. didnt want to have a bottle neck at the source already. in the end, too small internal battery connections will lead to unnecessary heat and heat means you wasted energy that couldve been used for your motor.

interesting test might be: use one of those 8mm nickel strips of about 10cm length between your battery and your VESC, then go to 60A+ load and see what happens to the strip (not asking to provoke, Im really asking cause I dont know how the strip will take it)! 
joule heating is proportional to the resistance of the strip and to the squared current. sadly I dont have nickel strips around right now, otherwise I wouldve measured the resistance to get an idea of the voltage you loose (U = R*I, with I = 60A and R the measured resistance, you know what voltage you lose on the strip. and you loose it on every of the 11 serial connections, so take the measured resistance * 11!). at the same time you can calculate your average losses with I^2 * R * t!

maybe its just insignificant, maybe it becomes more significant under heat, maybe its heating up to unhealthy amounts, who knows - in any way it would be interesting to know. ;)

Finished the deck this weekend, so here's the pictorial.

Hand brushed some red stain into the wire channels after cleaning them up:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BFHz7GVhBvM/?taken-by=longhairedboy

found a 17/64th drill bit at lowes.. LOL didn't think they'd have one. Anyway, that lets me tap in the bullets for a super tight fit instead of having to epoxy them and watch them get crooked when the solder heats up the epoxy:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BFH0LiGBBv3/?taken-by=longhairedboy

added in the wiring and glued down the wires with some epoxy and some clamps:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BFH08JVhBhp/?taken-by=longhairedboy

After filling it in with some of that wonderful West System 105/207, letting it harden for about 18 hours, and then sanding it down, i began the detail staining around the channels, careful not to get it on the epoxy:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BFJffh9BBle/?taken-by=longhairedboy

The staining turned out well, nice and flat like i like it:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BFJ01vqhBhL/?taken-by=longhairedboy

I like the stain flat because once the grip is on and locked in with urethane, it really makes the board POP:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BFKBJEmhBgw/?taken-by=longhairedboy

These pics don't do it justice. Even with the video its hard to take it all in. The clear urethane and the clear glass grit on top of the clear wiring channels and flat red backed gloss black logo.... i'm really happy with it. 

I'm starting on the boxes this week, then on to tuning the vescs and getting everything running and tested. I'm seriously earning this guy's money, so my prices might have to go up soon. Just the consumables on this build were more than expected, nevermind the time. I was having too much fun doing it to keep exact track of my hours, but i'm probably over 20 hours into it so far. I'll get faster and better at it though, so i try to keep that in mind. I'm essentially building prototypes still, despite having the Scarlet framework to work within, so every time the process will shift a little until i finally settle in to what will become standards.

moar board porn:

fabbed a few boxes over the last few days. Two of them are good, one of them was too long and caused me to have to rework the mold to be slightly shorter. So after reworking it, i got two good boxes that will hold the 48cell packs i make and all the other innards. 

pics! because it happened!

So some background on my boxes: yes i do a hand laying technique that does not involve a female (reverse) mold, i instead use a plug (male) mold and i don't use a vacuum bag setup. This is how I have always done it because up until now i was never making the same box twice. Now that i've settled on a design, it makes more sense to do one of two things: make a female mold using the male form PLUS an existing box to get the thickness correct and have a flange, which will involve taking the time to not only make the box absolutely perfect so that the mold will be, but also doing it right and figuring out a vac bag setup.... or getting somebody else to make them. I'm not 100% sure which way i want to go. When i'm making the boxes now, doing it the way i have been, it makes me want to get somebody else to do it. 

Several people online have wondered why i have built my boxes this way this whole time. Now you know. Eseentially im'm still building and selling prototypes. That's sort of my model, after all.

so i got the rivet nuts epoxied in, sanded them smooth with the deck and re-touched the stain around them. Also, rivet nuts are GOLD so who wants that? black paint pen to the rescue!

tossed a couple of 1" foam strips in the bottom of the box to keep the battery pack and everything on it a little more insulated from vibration:

how 'bout that fuel guage? dremel surgery FTW. I got the rectangle cut out so tight the volt meter just snapped into the hole and stayed there before i even sealed it in with hot glue.

everything's in the box now. Charging port, switch and fuel guage, battery packs, VESCs, BMS, and all the trimmings. Now all that's left is to do some minor cable management and then set up the VESCs.

So the foam had to come out from the bottom due to the height of things and the phase leads not wanting to bunch under the deck in a nice curley fashion. Whatevs.

the vescs are probably just there for the foto and usually in the back cavity behind the liion cells?

I would really avoid direct contact of vesc mosfets and battery. liion chemistry is most comfortable in the 10-30¬∞C region and very sensitive to everything outside that comfort zone. exposed to 80-100¬∞C mosfets, these few cells in direct contact with the vesc should age much faster than the rest of the pack!

You're in my head aren't you? I swear I've been thinking about doing exactly that ever since I realized how clear it really is. The grip would scatter the light beautifully. not much room left in the box though, so the led/el controller would have to be tiny, but it could totally work. I like the el idea because it's a more even distribution of light.

THe problem with one piece motorcycle race suits is that they are cut very aggressively for a crouching position on a motorcycle.  Getting downhill specific leathers are better because they are more comfortable in a non tuck position.  NJK makes custom leathers which work out great, and overall it will cost less than the motorcycle armor you posted from revzilla.  But if you want to spend less, there is topgearleathers which are motorcycle armored suits for less than $300.. so those can be a start.  Definitely better than just jeans and pads.

I was kinda teasing in a sense but really it's just going that fast opens up a whole new world of danger. I know you probably won't use it all routinely but after seeing the results of that one crash on a BB I just hope that's the worst you ever see. I have no interest in going more than 30mph on any board in my lifetime lol (at least for now :) ) 

I need a board to have fun on crowded city streets and to get to work...don't wanna have to wear leathers to work and change lol I will be wearing elbow and knee pads from now on though. My legs are already scraped up from other incidents and re-opening wounds would suck

i don't want to wear leathers either, for the most part my fun speed is 15-20mph and i'm happy to just cruise around barefoot with my hair flowing at lower speeds because it feels just as good as trying to top out while all suited up to the point where you can't even feel the breeze, you just hear the dull reverberations of your shirt flapping through the helmet. ITs like being in a car, which isn't what i want. 

i priced some proper downhill leathers a while back, they have some nice ones where you can pick your colors and even have patches made for the back, and they take all your measurements and it fits like a glove. Maybe one day i'll do that specifically for speed and range testing, but i'm too broke right now for an $800+ suit.

His customer service is excellent and buying experience was great!  Plus you get to see your board being built step by step.  I'll do an unboxing when I get it.  And after some riding I'll post a detailed video review.  Keep an eye out for a new thread in the next 1-2 weeks.

Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.  And of course LHB is pretty good at getting back to you so you can ask him directly as well.

Die cut vinyl decals. I had them made by diecutstickers.com. I thought about silk screening, printing on rice paper, and all of those types of things but vinyl stays put, doesn't smudge, and takes the clear coat and grip i use over it and also is completely opaque so i can use it on any background color i want and it always shows up. Except black, it doesn't show up well on black because the decal itself is black.

Just an update,

I did the typical boring unboxing video that's still in my camera, I'll get around to putting it together and posting it this weekend in another thread.  

First impressions: This beast looks even better in person!  It is a pretty hefty solid piece of wood.  I feel like it would do some major damage if it ran it into a wall or something like that.  The fit and finish is excellent for a board that was built in a garage.  I think I prefer the crushed glass grip tape to normal grip tape.  I talked about this briefly in my unboxing.  

I can't really take it out properly till next week, but I couldn't help get on the board and try it inside the house.  This is never a good idea, but I was being careful.  So on carpet apparently the VESC doesn't like to go from a stand still.  It would stutter when I tried to make it go and not move at all, it wasn't a pleasant sound and I got worried.  But LHB informed me that carpet and starting from a stand still will make it do that, perfectly normal.  Next test will be a slow speed (under 24 mph I'd say) so I don't have to put leathers and a full face helmet on.  Per @longhairedboy instructions, when starting from a dead stop it's best to give it full throttle...back off, then adjust speed.  Also it's always good to give a kick before throttle, so in my testing on the street I will be doing a kick push and then giving throttle.  

I don't know why...but I have a feeling this board may scare me a bit.  More to come...

Fear is a healthy and reasonable response to my boards. 25mph is fast but that board will treat you right. Its very stable at speed, especially once you get the trucks tightened to your liking. Just promise me you'll always wear a helmet even when you're just derping.

Update #2: Even though I'm working today and the next 2 days and barely have any time, I took the board out today.

@longhairedboy built a hell of a board, it is beautifully insane!   But at the same time the acceleration curve is well tuned.  From a kick push start it won't knock you on your ass if you manage the throttle carefully, but it picks up speed if you really want it to.  From my brief 5 min test run so far, I LOVE IT.  If this keeps up for the rest of the testing next week, I might have to start finding things around my place to sell so I can get another board from him!  

And yes this board is terrifying.  More so than a downhill run, because one wrong tap on that joystick at speed and the board can fly out from under you...Killer acceleration.  The steez remote has kind of shabby build quality, the joystick requires almost no force to push forward...so I have to be very careful when I have gloves on, cuz the torque on this board is pretty crazy and pushing that joystick forward accidentally at the wrong time will end up in major damage to my body.  It's weird because when I had the boosted I did not feel scared at all going full throttle and max speed, I could slam the throttle to max at anytime and handle it no issues.  But this board...I'm cruising at a mild 22ish and I'm constantly thinking about being careful with the joystick and not making a wrong move.  

I made like a 10 second cell phone video, just to put something up.  It's a crappy quality, noob style vertical orientation video...so don't mind that.  Proper videos next week.  It's not a fast run, don't think i got above 25 mph in this. 

P.S.  If you don't see a new thread next week with my videos, I died while testing this board's limits.

Nice! Glad you put something up, as something is better than nothing. Was wondering if you were being conservative with the throttle. I would jam that shit down :p then again like you I am just remembering how easy it was to do that with boosted. Even then I was felt like I took off like a slug... Can't wait to see the new videos.
```

## \#144 Posted by: Photorph Posted at: 2016-06-10T23:53:08.415Z Reads: 381

I was conservative with the throttle.  The boosted is a joke...  I just walked in from another 5 min test run.  I was cruising at 26 mph which is like 6 mph faster than the top speed of boosted.  I hit 30 mph before I had to slow down, that's the fastest I've been on a longboard (on flat ground).

In contrast to going downhill, I feel safer going downhill at 40mph because i have a drop down top mount deck... the roads I go on are more predictable and smoother, and there is no sudden acceleration, just gradual increase.  So going 26 mph even on this board kept me at my toes...and when I hit 30 mph for a bit, I was worried.  I was wearing only gloves and a helmet which I'm never doing again.  I need to use leathers.  What scares me the most are the cracks in the crappy Michigan roads.  

Sorry to say this, but there is no way evolve GT can even touch this board in terms of raw speed and performance.  I don't think there is any board that can.... except maybe Chaka's builds.  I'll be honest in my reviews and if there are negatives I will point them out, for example I can already say that the board is huge and heavy.  Not a problem because I'll never need to carry it due to the range on it. I'm also wondering about the enclosure that's holding the electronics and how that will hold up long term.  The enclosure on the boosted felt much sturdier.  Braking i'll have to do more tests on, because for how fast this board goes...I'm wondering if they are powerful enough.  I've been braking way ahead of time, and using foot brake as well.  But I realize not everyone who buys E-boards can foot brake at high speeds so I'll evaluate stopping using just the boards brakes later.  I'll learn more as I ride more.  

But overall he seriously delivered the most amazing board.  I'm actually mad at boosted that I paid them $1500 for such crap performance and range when I could have just spent a bit more to get this board which is like 10x better than boosted in terms of range/performance.

I feel like if people knew about his boards, he can outsell the big companies.  @longhairedboy when you're rich and famous someday from selling boards, just remember I was one of your first customers.

I wouldn't expect the GT to touch a VESC driven 12s board with huge motors lol I know for sure the GT will be more punchy than Boosted, which will be enough for me in most cases. 25-26mph cruising will be a reality for me which is faster than I'd be comfortable with most of the time. The raptor will be more for thrills and quick errands.

Felt the same as soon as I discovered DIY.. Boosted made you pay for their customer service, not the board : p if it lasted as long as the new one with the extended bat will maybeee it would've been worth it but at 4 miles you can't justify it. Nonetheless it trained me for these boards.

I believe he will gain popularity and see more orders if you put out those videos. One thing I hope to see is that the experience remains the same and that he will have a team that can make things roll smoothly so he can focus on that. Seems Jason has his "squad" together now. I think by this time next year we will be seeing a whole different market :D hopefully chaka will have more of his decks out there as well as LHB, and maybe even an MTB or hub motor board from Enertion. Exciting times.

@Photorph I was channeling the powers of darkness into this xcarve I've been trying to assemble for the last 8 hours when I decided to stop and check the boards. 

I really appreciate the kind words, and I'm thrilled that you're enjoying yourself! That helmet looks sick. I think I need one now. 

That box should last you a long while. The one I made for my personal ride has taken a beating and it's only got a few scratches. I'm in talks with a local company who I think will be able to start making them for me, so i should have even better and stronger boxes soon and quicker build times to boot. 

How do you like that deck's super soft w-cave ish profile?

The mild W concave on the deck is definitely noticeably and I really like it. I still won't be able to slide this beast but I don't need to do that on an electric board anyway.  I always prefer a W concave so I'm glad you have those on your board.

How much does the wire channels affect the strength of the board? I am thinking of carving a 1m line down the middle to insert led strip as a battery display. Will also fill it in with resin. Thanks for the insperation.

if you fill it with a good strong resin it won't leave you with a weaker board, it might even give you a stronger one. My wire channels are 5-6mm deep depending on where you are in the concave. 

Something i'm planning to do on a recent commission is inlay some EL wire on top, which will likely require a 3mm x 3mm channel in the shape of a circuit trace. Customer wants a 100mm AT build that looks like it came out of the movie TRON. Hard to argue with that. Guess i'm going to need a good BEC.

Ok, that makes more sense now. How's the launch torque on that 18/36 ratio? I would imagine its not much of a rocket off the line but starts to kick in higher up.

Unbelievable build LHB. I really appreciate your comments about safety and the degree of caution these machines warrant as well. Very impressive and inspirational thread.

I'd like to report back on this build. 

The current owner of this board is still riding it around like a boss. He contacted me last night because his volt meter went out but i managed to help him figure out the problem by not responding to his email at all because i was watching the new Transformers movie, which forced him to take a look at it himself as the desire to meddle in Skatan's business often overpowers us. He's still happy with it. 

One of the wires came loose so he re-attached it. Crisis averted. You can all rest easy now. 

I should probably ask to have it sent in just to give it a check up.

except then it stopped working because something shorted the eswitch, probably some silly shit going on in there,  and he had to send it in anyway but now its fine. 

ITs still awesome.
