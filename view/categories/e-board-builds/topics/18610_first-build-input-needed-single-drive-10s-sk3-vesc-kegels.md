Hello, I have been browsing the forum for about a month gathering information and I finally decided to start my build.  But before I start I will need some help from all of you.  I have a fairly good idea of what I need, but not completely sure when it comes to compatibility.  What i want out of my board is at least a 10 mile (16 km) range and be able to reach a top speed between 20-30 Mph(32 kph).  I live in a relatively flat area, so I don't have to worry about hills.  I want to keep this build under $700, and I am confident I can do it. Since you probably have more important things to do I'll cut to the chase, this is what I had in mind.

Motor: Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 6374 168 kv

I plan on building the deck and motor mount to keep costs low. For charging I plan  on using a laptop charging port and compatible charger, although have not looked into the charging side of thing yet. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Great choice of motor. the SK3s are pretty solid!

If you're looking at that BMS, I think you mean 3x of those 4s cells in series. Other than that, I think you'll be fine. On the loose guess of 10Wh/km I think you'll be able to hit your 10 mile range goal (assuming my math is correct...) The only commentary I'd offer is maybe consider doing an 8s2p pack with those cells (instead of a 12s1p). I think you're electronics will be a bit happier (I tend to shy away from 12s, personal opinion), and with the addition in parallel, I think you'll get even better range.

Everything else looks pretty good. Well done!

looks like a good start, but with that budget I think you can do a nice 10s3p or 4p 18650 pack. then get a 190kv 6355 to keep the board light.

you can get 20mph with 8s 190kv, so 10s will be a nice 25ish..

Yeah, I now plan on making a 10s3p build from samsung 25Rs. Pretty much will be an enertion spacecell pro3, but will cost only $120! (Not including the bms and all the wiring) I still have to figure out how I will make the charging system, but I plan on starting my build soon. Thank you for the advice.
