Welcome,

This is the build log for my first electric skateboard. I know there was another one but I took a completely different approach once I bought a crapload of parts from @cliofreak 

To introduce myself first, my name is Flim. And in my spare time, I love to hang out with friends and do all kinds of activities! I got hooked onto e-boards when my friend bought a Meepo. I got to ride it a couple times and I soon decided I wanted one myself. I could have bought one (I mean come on the backfire ranger x1 looks freakin awesome especially for the price). But I eventually decided I wanted to build one myself. 

So here it is, may I introduce you to The Reborn. Well, why this name lol. the boards uses a lot of used parts, thus the name 'The Reborn'.

Why the chosen parts?
Mostly because of the grande la grande buy from Cliofreak. I was originally planning to just go lipos and cheap motor, esc and stuff. But this deal was too tempting to pass :joy:. So I went with it. To not waste the great components I already had, I decided to go all out, stretch my budget as far as my pocket could go and get other decent parts too. 

What I currently have:
Longboard:
- 90mm Flywheel clones + 80mm Slickrevolution
- Caliber 2 trucks and bushings
- Osprey deck (Stiff) + Fibreglass enclosure (Benclosures) with pre-drilled holes and hardware/gasket, including 10s LCD screen bonded in place

Electronics:
- FOCBox
- G2TB remote and transmitter
- 10s4p Sanyo NCR18650GA
- 6473 Alienpowersystems motor 200 KV
- NEED 10s BMS I think 40/50 amps will do.

Alienware motor mount, clamp, and pulleys.

I got my battery yesterday. Still need to test it out.


I also managed to put together the drive train for the first time. However my wheel pulley keeps coming loose, so I need to find a way to let that stick.

Pictures will soon follow!

It's supposed to just slide in and it does, but it came loose 2 times today when I rode with it. 
So I guess I'll get a small bolt to hold the wheel and pulley together

Nothing. That's why I need to put in a bolt.
I don't know how the previous owner did this, he didn't include this bolt.
Of the 3 holes 2 of them have broken bolts in them unfortunately.

itd be better to have a retainer on the other side and then use nuts and bolts rather than just threading into the wheel

For the BMS I just used a â€˜charge onlyâ€™ system. Cheap eBay job. Generic 10s BMS. 
Re the pulley, the bolts on the AlienPowerSystem pulley sheared off and although I was tempted to drill out and rethread the wee legs of the pulley, I didnâ€™t bother because it stayed in place fine when belt was tight. I mentioned that in my original sale. You could try putting electrical tape or heat shrink around the legs to ensure a tighter fit. Iâ€™d not drill into the wheel.

You didn't have any problems with charge only? No drifting cells?

I had two packs fail on me on two different occasions. I swapped out the bms both times as all signs on here pointed to bad bms. However, I used the same cheap bms the 2nd time and it failed again. I know a bunch of guys on here that use charge only. Iâ€™d say, donâ€™t cheap out on bms from my experience although charge only is quite common.

Tbh, thereâ€™s a chance I damaged them both during installation as Iâ€™ve just recently learned about the importance of connecting B- main wire first, then connect the balance wires. Well, Iâ€™ve discovered that info while building my 14s eBike.

need some advice on the bms guys

Iâ€™ve already decided to use bms for both charge and discharge.

So I can buy a bestech bms with e-switch, or just a bms and a anti spark switch. For the second option I would go with:
https://www.ebay.nl/itm/37V-42V-10S-45A-Li-ion-Battery-Protection-Board-BMS-PCB-System-Over-Charge-Disch/162844447523
And 
http://electricskateboard.repair/index.php?id_product=36&controller=product

And for the first, I have been waiting for someone to sell me a bestech bms but so far no luck. I donâ€™t want to buy 2.

Update:


Bms and charger just arrived.

Now thereâ€™s a prolem. My bms cÃ¢bles are too wide, they donâ€™t fit in the bms
