Finally! That what I said. There is always a first time and I won't forget the feelings of building mine own first Esk8. I approciated this amazing world last year with a Koowheel. A cheap pre-built board that I really enjoyed until it broke after 2 months. Since then I kept thinking about the next board, whether another pre-built or follow the DIY way. I am not new to build stuff, but I didn't know anything about bulding an Esk8. I like at first eskating bacause it gives me the snowboard feeling and I don't have to push :joy: ! Luckily I sticked to the DIY solution. So my needs were short, silent, decent range and power, and most important COOL! :sunglasses:. Budget 500 Euro (little spoiler I went slightly above but not that much). I started reading the forum and soon realized that all the knowledge needed were there, so no excuse anymore...
 Phase 1: Planning

![IMG_20180415_214546|690x388](upload://sahYR8vbQzXsxIYlMkCvLcbmfvi.jpg)


Parts:
- Custom made spot welder. For friends called the Frankenstein spot welder. Wood, trasformer, arduino e patience. Not astetic but functional!

 Next time I will opt for the wood insert, since witht the t-nut if the deck is not really flat you will notice a bump under the grip tape. I milled down but still visible.

I don't have the picture but at the end I created a 3-4mm hole for the whole enclosure. All the electronics is velcro attached to the board (Velcro from hobbyking, really stong one and thinner than the 3M one).

And final result...

The ony thinkg I will probably chage is the enclosure, either I re-print it a bit bigger (too tight fit) and I had problem during the printing (100 hours in total) of clogged nozzle so some parts are not strong as the rest. I am thinking about Kydex. If someone has experience please share your tricks!

Overall I am really happy with how it turned out. My previous Koowheel in fast mode has the same torque of this one in slow mode :smirk: I am surprise about this hub motor nad the ride with Vesc is way smoother than with ESC. I am still adjusting the trucks but top speed around 40km/h (ackmaniac app, I will post screenshot later), super fine for me, on such short board. The real surprise is the torque that it's really strong, I set the accelaration curve at -22% to be more gentle but on the steepest hill in my city it bit the street. I can stand on it in max accelleration.

If you read it till here, hey thx for your time! For any question...I am here.
Ciao ciao...

EDIT: After request I added the STL files.

That is a surprisingly good looking build, especially for a first build.  

If you have access to a vacuum former you could use your existing enclosure to for a new one giving you a bit more real estate since your existing outside dimensions will become your inside dimensions.

No problem. I would have bought your enclosure and saved me a lot of sleepless nights but my stuff couldn't fit inside. Not with double esc and BMS with heatsink. Too bulky stuff. Anyhow I find your enclosure the best one for the Jet Spud so I took inspiration.

Since I know someone can be interested in knowing how these hub motors perform I will leave my 3 days review :wink: I am using the boar every day for my commute, around 10km a day. As I said I come from a Koowheel which for me was already at point as commute board in terms of power. Concerning the current set up the first thing I noticed is the torque. At whatever speed you are you get the kick if you push the throttle. That's way I made a more gentle throttle curve otherwise really hard for me stand on it. I usually use it in the slow mode (nano X remote) which I think use 85% of the throttle making it predictable and safer. Of course I also tested out the full performance and here the result 

![chrome|281x500](upload://xtc40Ff3sF9oHG4Z2XF56UavDQK.png)

I used my fitbit to clocked the speed ecc... Because it has a way better GPS than my phone (higher sample frequency). As you can see top speed of 39km/h in what I see was on a slightly incline. I don't think my setup can go faster because it really pushes continuously until that speed and then easy cruise there. So it seems like to reach the ERPM limit. I can't speak about durability yet but so far (except for the shining silver parts :smirk:) I am happy with them. I also use the ackmaniac's app but I can't find the right magnet numbers and calculate the speed correctly, for the moment the closer I can get is with 18 magnets. Although I see that the motor doesn't draw to much, I never reach the max watt set (usually half of it is enough to reach top speed at full duty). For questions, just write :grin:

Edit: forgot to say that I weight around 83-84kg because I had the backpack with all the stuff for work and training.

Nice build, congratulation. I’m about to built similiar setup with spud deck and diy hub, and i notice that the rear truck bolt holes on the spud deck didn’t fit the truck bolt holes on the diy hub. Did you drill another new holes?, since i haven’t built them yet i was wondering did you drill the new holes more to the front (means more short space for the enclosure or to the back of the deck. i could drill them in between the existing holes on the deck but it would be too close to eachother and i’m afraid it will weakened them.

With DIY hub di you mean diyeboard? In my case l had 3 pre drilled hole pairs that allowed me to place the rear truck in 2 different configurations, shorter (you will get a bit more kicktail) and longer (more space for enclosure and more stable). I didn't have to drill any additional holes. I went for the more stable configurations but in that case the last pair of hole in not on the same level than the other, that's why I made the rear riser to follow the deck shape.

I got the spud deck from bkb (where did you get yours?) And the bolt holes on the deck seems had different range configuration with my other board. Yes i got diyeboard hub, but they’re fit just fine with my other board holes. Hmm it seems my spud deck comes with different configuration holes. I’ll take picture when i got home.

If you check my first post you can see my part list. Anyhow yes I think you got one with a slightly different configuration. Not a big deal. You can make new holes and if the are far enough from the previous one than just leave them otherwise you can close them up with sand and epoxy, resin or whatever you have at home.

Haha nice, i also paint that silver things to black, but its made from aloy, i dont think the black paint would last.

Please update how the ride so far will you 😊

Yeh I saw the video too. I hope they won't but we'll see it. Up to now I really enjoy it. For my commute use is really the perfect size, fast enought, nice tourque and great range. I know that they are made of aluminium and paint is not the best. In the past for my motrbike I went with powder coating and anodization. I also saw cheap kit that should work pretty well but you have to know that you will use it for multiple projects otherwise is not worth it. To paint the plate I use two coats of primer and 6 of jet black. I am sure that if you sratch hard you will leave signs but yeh I hope it won't happen. Who designed this thing probably finished the patience once there :smirk:
Is your black paint lasting?

Ok! Finally I finished the fiberglass enclosure. First time. Learnt a lot, which is always nice. I didn't get the super smooth surface because I run out of resin and I didn't have the gel coat. I can always decide to recoat it afterwards (if I find the time and the patience). I used my old 3D printed enclosure, cut out the edges, wrapped, than resin, fiberglass, remove bubbles...check and repeat several times. Peel ply, breeder and vacuum bag (ghetto style @ninja). It came out really strong and at that time I understood how long it would take to sand it. Few hours and 2 arms gone later I cleaned up the enclosure and sanded it down as best I could until wet sanding. Made the holes for the electronics and hardware. Closed the old holes with resin to remove the bump on the top of the board. Drilled the new holes, this time went for wood threaded insert M4 x 8mm. Big thanks to @Sebike who sent them to me for free, allowing me to continue because the one I ordered were still on the way. Final steps, repaint the board, and the enclosure with first primer (filler one for the enclosure) and then Matt black. Now a sequence of pictures that tell more than the words...

Thanks! I checked your build really nice. Moreover since you made even the board! That is on a next level. Yeh the final super smooth finish is not that difficult if you have additional epoxy or polyester resin, or even better a gel coat. It takes time but it's feasible. How does the board run?

The board runs great even with one single 6355-motor and belts. With dual setup and a bit more batteries in parallell it would really master the hills well and also break a bit better. But it is alot of fun as it is and running for 20 kms+. I love the small form factor - easy to pick up, take on bus if needed etc.

What about yours?

I had a pre-built longboard last year, and I love it, although it had worse specs than this one. The only thing it really sucked was the size. It couldn't fit almost anywhere, that's way I went for a short board. Protability and silent motors were a must for this build. I habe been using it for the past month and a half and It's amazing. The hubmotors surprised me for the enjoyable torque and easy to reach 40km/h top speed. Although I like the possiblity to play with gears of belt drive system, but I don't like the noise.

Because I used the 3d one as mold for the fiberglass enclosure. So I gained room. Which is good because the previous one was a bit smaller. Mainly due to the BMS being too big. Otherwise a 10s3p with 2 vescs fit perfectly in the original one.

Since has been a while...wanted to try out 12s, so got 2 Flipsky 6.6, few more cells for 12s3p 30Q battery, bestech 12s D140 and some accessories :kissing:...

Ok, Thanks to this fantastic community I got them work fine. I still have a weird behaviour on bench test, but it doesn't affect the ride so far. I will look into it later on.
Here the first short ride this morning (90Kg geared with backpack for the gym ecc), plus some telemetry, a dark video from yesterday trying to find a sweet spotting for the brakes ecc...
I know these motors well, I can say that at 12s they are a new motors. I guess is for every motor, but it's nice to try them at 10s and then 12s. Believe no way you have to come back. Even with a small battery like mine 12s3p is totally worth it. Unfortunatelly I am using them in FOC and not BLDC as in the past because with the new Flipsky VESC 6.6 I have too much rattling at the beginning which makes the ride more uncomfortable. So yes FOC does removes 2-3 kmh of top speed but overall way better feeling. Plus the Popoca wheels in front are a blast. Really feel the difference.

https://youtu.be/9e3FvLftF2A

Here a bit of telemetry data https://www.dropbox.com/s/zbsxn1yym6lv13a/2018-10-25_10-01-47_Avenger_X_esc_Data.csv?dl=0
Load them here and you can see everything https://gct-hp.de/VDLA/

Screenshot of the results
![vescmonitor|281x500](upload://3GpCLZpyDuSMnqpcFidvPxUKWbp.png)

One thing to mention is that this Flipsky 6.6 has a bad volt sensor, which is stupid to save money on a volt sensor that is fundamental on a VESC. Anyhow in my  case is about 1.3V lower than the real one.

yes already -10A did the trick. -11A is ok. I also increase to -60A motor min. I check during the ride and never went lower than -10A total from 2 vescs, so -5A each. I do not know why doesn't work when you set it at -6A direclty. Probably there is something that makes this VESCs working different compare to the other. On thing to mention they run coller than the 4.12 I had. Like 10 degree less. It's also colder outside but I think still less heat then the previous ones.

Yeh maybe they have some soft limits to prevent overcurrent issues. So basically better to increase it so that you do not occur into that limit easily. Thanks for the help! The weird behaviour on bench test is still there but you don't feel it while riding. Boh!

It’s getting colder huh. 

Yeah I remember that sound of those hubs. They run nice on 12s with 42kph max. 
But I just got them carvon sdr afterwards and then the torque drives after that so I didn’t get to try them for very long. 

Also wasn’t very confident yet when I tried them cause I had only just gotten out of the hospital from the shoulder break. 

Are you going to keep thos setup and give a full review after a month or a few weeks of riding?

When I tried it they did get very hot but it was also a very hot summer at the time.

Since I am working on the DD conversion of the MAD hubs, for the moment I keep them and I will use every day, except rainy days. I use the board as commuter, so no problem to test them. This evening I will make another video and telemetry on the way back to home. To me the best thing about the hubs is the torque, linear and at 12s constant up to top speed, and the heat dissipation. I actually think that they are pretty efficient for the power they have. Do not know why but if I check the telemetry data they really use way less current than other motors and still provide nice performance. Indeed I get a longer range using them. I will check the temperature more often, but this morning they were barely warm. It's also 15 degree in the morning, so that helps for sure. I got a x-ray temp meter so I can do it in a more appropriate way.

Ok here the evening ride to home. Sorry for my stupid thumb but with backpack and gym back, holding the phone and the remote was a bit sketchy. You can also appreciate the end of the video where the policeman stopped me because I didn't have the light. He had totally right, I changed the backpack this morning and forget to install it. That was the time when the torch from the phone saves your ass :laughing: It's funny since usually I have front and rear light and no one cares about me. Today I was without and full of police in the city.
Anyhow new top speed 44kmh. When the battery voltage is at 50.4V the vesc reads about 48.2V, so depends on the charge level the error increase. For the rest all fine. The motor at the end of the ride were 38.9^C on  the outer CAN. I had to slow down the last part because of traffic and :policeman: I also recorded a hill climb but was a mess so I will do it again with the light. Anyhow since they are 65Kv the hill climbing capability is really good.

To be honest didn't keep track of it. I used to experiments a lot of DIY parts I make. The first version with 10s3p battery, Maytech vesc, and classic meepo hubs was around 500 Euro. It was a good board. Now with unity, 12s3p battery, MAD Fury DD a bit more for sure :grin:

Well if you scroll up the first enclosure had the logo and captain America shield on the battery :laughing: then tried to replicate with fiber glass but didn't work out well so dropped the idea.

The rest of the Avenger will sit on a shelf. Proud of all the kms machined together.
