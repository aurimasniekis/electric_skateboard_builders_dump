Here's the second installment of this build. I hope someone takes something away from this. I realize my components are a little out dated. It has taken my so long to get around to this project. I've got two children, a house that needs updating and I started a new job....hence the name: "Lazy Dad" Electric skateboard. Let me know what y'all think and if you have any questions. Thanks!
