Hello,

I've wanted to DIY an electric longboard for a really long time and now I want to start realise that desire. I will have access to both a CNC and a 3dprinter, which I intend to use to build enclosure and possibly other parts. However, **I need help choosing individual parts such as specific motor model, belt, pulley and other electronics.** I have read the very helpful guides and my understanding of how an electric longboard works is at the very least fundamental but I lack experience in selecting parts as well as what brands are the best. **TL;DR at the end**

**The end goal:** Is to make an electric longboard suited for street use that has a moderate top speed, is somewhat reliable and has a decent range. Realistically somewhere of a max speed around 40km/h, can endure some shitty weather and aybe around 15km range?

The budget is flexible. Meaning, that while i definitely don't have unlimited funds I don't want to limit myself and cheap out on parts but with that said I still want to build it low budget. As a max letâ€™s say (375 euro). This includes trucks, battery, esc, motor, pulley and etc. It does NOT include Wheels as I already have Orangutang kegels and also the deck, since Iâ€™ll be making that myself.

* I live in Sweden which implies that ordering parts outside of the EU will get hit with heavy additional taxes (25%) plus (relatively) insane handling fees if the packages goes through national shipping company. This means that I want to order as many parts from EU stores.

* I would like to order everything if possible from hobbyking.com from EU warehouses.

* I already own the wheels I have Orange Kegel 80mm. I've seen people 3dprint a pulley for it and it seems like a good idea: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1733997

* I already own most tools needed to realize this project but I don't have a spot welder, therefore will buying an already made battery be more value?

* I want a single motor setup.

* Being able to brake is important.

* I will 3dprint an enclosure.

* I weigh 76kg but realistically when using the board I will be 80kg.

**TL;DR** : Help me pick a parts list from as few EU vendors as possible. The longboard should be able to go roughly 40km/h, be able to handle some light water splashes and have 15km range. I need this:

* Motor

* Trucks

* Mechanical parts for belt drivetrain
a. (Pulleys) &amp; belts
b. Motor Mount

* ESC

* Battery

* Remote

Also please tell me if Iâ€™m being unrealistic about requirements or budget (or those two in relation to each other). Thank you for any help.

It's the ever lasting struggle of buy it nice or buy it twice.

Flat out, the budget is unrealistic unless you want junk that will fail you quickly. A quality 10s battery in the 2p to 5p range will easily run you $150-400 usd.

The controller will be around $100. Search and find recommended ones with vesc compatibility. If you don't know what vesc is, learn up!

Motor will be another ~$100.

Check out @dickyho mounts, they're very reasonable.

Caliber trucks seem commonly used, check what the motor mount is compatible with.

Remote will run you $50-150 depending on quality and features.

There are many threads here that have lots of this info listed. Search the major terms I mentioned and then ask any questions after you have attained all the knowledges.

Good luck!  ðŸ¤ž

Welcome.
But your budget is very low for quality you want.
- premium motor Maytech 6369 less than 200kv
-budget motor KEDA 6364 190kv
- Focbox or at least flipsky 4.12
- remote mini trigger from eBay
- trucks Caliber 2 or E-Caliber
-drive train  and battery depend on the vendor you choose from below

@e.board_solutions
@fottaz eskating.eu
@DavidBanner   street wing

Or at least you could get 
https://wowgoboard.com/products/wowgo-at-board-battery-pack-sanyo-36v-14ah-free-shipping

Remember you need safety: full face helmet from sickboards, Tsg knee pads, tsg elbow pads, armoured hoodie, etc. That's at least 300 more...

Hi, Thanks for the upfront feedback @Grozniy and @venom121212  
I'll definitely take in to consideration, I know the buy it nice or buy it twice all to well when entering new hobbies. Maybe a more realistic approach would be to not include the trucks cost in the budget does that seem more feasible? The budget mention is only for parts mentioned I've separate budget for deckbuilding as well as safetygear, so no need to worry.
As for the individual components.

This kit seems like a very good deal: http://www.diyeboard.com/electric-skateboard-battery-esc-power-kit-10s5p-10ah-360wh-p-526.html 

Which would be 290 USD for ESC, Battery, remote and enclosure.
Then all I would need to be is purchase motor, with its pulley, as well as belt and motor mount. I'll check out dickyho for sure. 
I don't need the best electric longboard there is, not even close. I probably don't even want to go extreme speeds on it considering the risk. As of right now I just want a board that I can commute with to an extent as well as have fun with.

Using the ND calculatorhttps://norde.cc/calculator.php With 15km flat travel 5km incline (10%) at speed 40km/h then that would lead me to needing a 9664mAh battery which the one I linked to is?

Thanks for the help guys.

Also used stuff pops up often at good prices.  That's probably the best way to build a quality ride at a reduced price. 
After you have a rough idea what you're looking for you should post a WTB thread and keep an eye on the marketplace.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/noob-question-thread-ask-your-questions-here/9559/1344?u=skunk

Replace Ebay esc with flipsky 4.12
Maybe get a mount from @Boardnamics if you can't find something more local.
Find battery appropriate for the range you desire.
*you already have wheels so ignore the abec part.
A slightly lower kv motor will provide better brakes  btw 150-170kv

The part I'm most confused about is the ESC. I don't need the best alien-grade technology we have. Is this one sufficient: https://eskating.eu/product/electric-skateboard-speed-controller-maytech-based-upon-the-vesc/ ???

I suppose this is the motor mount you mentioned: https://www.ebay.com/itm/CNC-motor-mount-for-50-63-motors-for-DIY-eskate-electric-skateboard/302775190943?hash=item467ecec59f:m:ms88LUPN6Vhpnpo8YRvLyng&var=601716797807

Ok guys, this is great: just the kind of help I wanted. I'm still unsure on what gear ratio I should go with.  So far we've got:
* The motor mount: https://boardnamics.com/product/motor-mount-for-electric-skateboard-v2-0-w-idler-gear/ it lands on 34 usd with shipping and it includes a belt as well as a belt tensioner.
* Battery: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-3s1p-40c.html 2x 64 euro
* Motor: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-213kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html This isn't waterproof at all right? And covering it would hinder its heat dissipating capacity which isn't a good idea, maybe another motor? 71 euro
* Trucks: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NY3Q5Q8/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=AQ5JN7IFU4T3S&psc=1 65 USD
* ESC: https://eskating.eu/product/electric-skateboard-speed-controller-maytech-based-upon-the-vesc/ 100 euro :cry:
* As for remote I'll have to look more. I know there are some cheaper options that can be 3dprinted, I know I have an RC car remote that looks like this already at home somewhere, maybe I can gut that. ![](https://img.tttcdn.com/product/original/p/gu1/R/RM318/RM318-2-70ef.jpg)

total cost (as of now): 360 USD

In short it's your battery management.
It makes sure the cells are charged evenly.

Okay, I understand. These are almost the same battery except that the last one has a third connector, which is used to connect to a BMS I presume. Does the first one not require a bms or is it the other way around?

I would recommend getting 2 5s 5000mAh lipos from hobbyking to increase your range because with 6s 5000mAh you probably won't get the 15km you want

i have a super cheap budget board ive built for 2 friends and mself now. its has fantastic power, plenty of speed, and reliable parts

**deck:** generic whatever you can find ($40-50)

**motor mounts**: boardnamics sliding mounts ($35~)

**wheels**: 90mm abec flywheel clones (amazon for $25)

**belts and pulleys**:   https://www.banggood.com/15mm-Wide-Belts-DIY-ABEC-Flywheel-Pulley-Kit-265mm-255mm-p-1222305.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN  ($18.50 x2)

****flipsky dual vesc 4 single and dual 6355** **: about $300 including shipping

trucks are caliber 10"
batteries are a personal preference, on 8s it works fine for anyone not after anything over 25mph, but 10s is better if you can afford it. lipos are cheap and i personally vouch for the turnigy 5000mah (x)cell count 20c. you still need various other components ofc, but this is the bulk of the cost in this list.

Yes, that's a solid plan and as it looks right now my build will be similar. The main difference are the wheels, I already have kegels.

lol, I've reached maximum post count for the day. Thanks for all the help everyone. I now have a much more clear plan. The only thing to work out is Battery, which one and type, as well as charger.

You have already gotten a lot of good info I will give my take on it. Iâ€™ve built a lot of budget boards as Iâ€™m a student with little income. However over the time Iâ€™ve found the best deals that compromise performance with price.

Motor - Keda 6364 or dual 6356 (written on hobbyking as 5663) $45 or less

Trucks - itâ€™s your choice really but caliber 2 are the easiest as they arenâ€™t round meaning the mount wonâ€™t slip, they also match the motor mounts. Another option are hobbyking trucks that I use, but I would swap out the bushings and pivot cups as they are very cheap $30-60 idk how much genuine calibers cost lol

Mounts - depends on trucks, either get boardnamics/ dickyho mounts for cheap or make your own from scrap aluminium and steel plate cust me $4 for some aluminium. All the tools needed are a drill, file and hacksaw. $35 or free

Pulleys can be bought on eBay or 3D printer easily. $10 if printed

Esc - flipsky 4.12, super cheap about $50

Remote control - mini remote, honestly the best remote. Itâ€™s super reliable, tough and cheap. Can be bought from most esk8 stores or eBay for $18

Battery - There are two options here depending on what you want to spend. The first is lipos, they are cheap and work well however require more looking after and donâ€™t provide much capacity for there size. Go with 10s as itâ€™s much better than 6s trust me I started where you are now. ($70) doesnâ€™t include bms

The other option is a 10s2p battery from a prebuilt esk8 company, these batteries can be bought from forum members all ready to go for about $120 (including bms) however make sure to get one for esk8 not those cheap ones out of hover boards. The good ones are either 6ah or 8.4ah.

Bms - only needed if you donâ€™t get the pre built battery a cheap one is $10 on eBay but it means you need to monitor your battery while riding regularly. The cheap ones must be bypassed for charge only as they canâ€™t handle the power of an esk8

A more expensive one can handle more power thus can run the power through it meaning it will monitor the discharge. You still need to check either way if using lipos as they cutoff before most bms modules do. $10- 80

Charger - an easy option is a 42v 2a charger will take about 3h to charge a 5ah battery but is very cheap around $15.

Enclosure - cheap enclosure can be made yourself easily from sheet aluminium, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve used and itâ€™s worked well a small sheet big enough for my deck was $15 or another option are plant potters and they actually look reasonably appealing. 

Finally thereâ€™s a bunch of stuff you will need like connectors, wire, heat shrink, cable sheathing and voltage meters. This will probably run you around another $50

So the total for the single 6364 with the premade battery is going to run you about $410. This will give you a range of about 20km riding on flat roads with a speed of about 20-25km/h and about 12-15 when going faster or on lots of hills. Top speed should be about 40-50km/h depending on the gear ratio Iâ€™d opt for 2.4-2.7:1 (the lower the more speed the higher the more torque) this is the better option and yes it will cost a bit more but will be considerably better and more reliable as well as lasting more battery cycles as itâ€™s li-ion and charging is all monitored by the bms. The only limiting factor with this battery is the max amps which depend on the cells used.


The other option is the single with lipos and a charge only bms, this should be around $370. The speed will be the same but range will be a few kms shorter, battery monitoring will be needed when approaching lower voltages. You also will not get as many charges from your battery before you need to replace it and you will need to do the wiring of the bms and batteries which can be a big issue for beginners.

Anyway thatâ€™s just my thoughts, Iâ€™ve used most of these parts except for the premade battery which I built my own instead and the mounts I mount I make myself instead of buying them. 

Good luck I hope this can help, if you need any links just lmk and Iâ€™ll get you some.

Lol, I didnâ€™t realise it was that long lol, itâ€™s not been proof read so mind the mistakes I just canâ€™t be arsed ðŸ˜‚

Hi,

Last update on the remote, I swear :sweat_smile:![20190311_151021|435x500](upload://k6F8dfILNVKhgJnfI3F4LWXdgYb.jpeg) 

I've gutted it completely alongside with the reciever. Looks like I'll be potentially saving 70-100 USD. It runs  on the same Servo motor connector others that I've seen do and on 2.4GHZ.

As for the batteries I've educated myself further on the "to BMS or not to BMS" question and as of right now I'm leaning towards no BMS and instead buy a charger that maintains the correct voltage. However I'll also be adding something similar to this: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingtm-lipo-voltage-checker-2s-8s.html Which while not perfect will give me an indication on the state of the battery while riding. Apparently you can configure it to warn you when approaching a critical condition.

**As usual any inputs** (especially on battery; if I should go 2x 3s 5000mAH 40c or anything different) **are very much appreciated.** Also I don't know if the batteries are supposed to be wired in series, doubling voltage or in parallel giving more mAh?

I used a calculator and got this: https://calc.3dservisas.eu/?NY6xDsIgGITfhdkYoFCNK22cNCQmdrcMmEhK0tH47v53tNt3x_HBV71CVhf1eddFHSTcJXTH_uQlreEhyVhiFHSkgInWmmFAMm09YGNbT6sRrHB0ACx9u1cjWkuK-5Aqx2OaPJEi-OccNtOcR6GzJj4h4q0SNlOh3GBa4oLSEdF636asMU7TusvS9Ya2J054DD9MfMyr3x8= 
I'm unsure about the results and, I don't know if that's going to be the final gear ratio (2:1). The estimated range is 10km at an avg speed of 30km/h. Doubling the amount of packs, (2 times parallel, 2x series.) which would be 4 total 3s5000mAh might be a better option but it's naturally twice as expensive. Perhaps another battery setup would be suitable.
```
