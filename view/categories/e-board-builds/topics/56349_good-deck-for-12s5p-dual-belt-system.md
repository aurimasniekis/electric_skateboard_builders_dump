I was gonna get the 12s5p battery of eskating.eu and still dont really know a good deck that will fit the battery/esc nicely. Was thinking about the http://landyachtz.com/us/boards/line-launch/ten-two-four-skull but i dont really know if the bottom side is to bend for the enclosure to fit snugly. 

Any suggestions?
