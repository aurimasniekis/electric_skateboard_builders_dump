What sort of range did you have in mind? Using [http://calc.esk8.today](http://calc.esk8.today) shows you'll get around 6miles assuming you're going for 6s1p?

Good idea i had no idea that was how the range on the board worked. I was looking for around 12-20 I know I will Probobly not use that much range but it would be nice to have. Thanks

I should really go for the hobbyking motormount instead of the ebay mount.
I got the ebay mount and it broke after a month then I got a new one and again it broke.
I got the hobbyking mount and it's so much better and very cheap! Fits perfectly on the sk3 motor.

For the pulley kit I should buy these, they fit on flywheel clones: https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com.au%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F182618936000

Hey bud, how are you getting on with your build? I'd like to join you in building my first board - perhaps we can di it together? What does your parts list look like so far?

cheers

Sure, I would sugest what I have on my first post as most of your parts, I would go with the hobbyking motor mount and a gear train kit instead of my motor mount and gear train kit from ebay. I would also get a larger battery if you want more power from your motor, and more range to rude your board.

Using a small low amp charger on large batteries just takes time.

yeah your better off spending more money with the charger as E1Allen said it takes time and depending on what power adapter you get it could take even more time.

Heyy bud, cheers for the info.

i already have a great longbaord with trucks etc - can i resue this or do i need to start fro scratch do you reckon?

You can definitely use your own board. If your trucks are a weird shape you might need to cut them or file them to fit a motor mount but you can definitely reuse your old board. That is one of the cool parts of making a board yourself

If you get the Hobbyking mount you probably donâ€™t even need to sand them it will fit just about all trucks, so yeah, your good.

If you've got decent enough trucks you can make your own mount and weld it/have it welded to the trucks. I did mine with a drill press and some files, and had it welded by a local guy in his garage. Cost me $15 for the sheet metal and $30 for the weld.

I'll Try to break down charging a little better.  

I believe this is your charger
[$20 Blue charger](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/imax-b6-ac-dc-charger-5a-50w-with-us-plug-copy.html)

Yes, this charger does not require a power supply.  It will charge your batteries as is.

Its a 50W charger up to 5A.  But its not always 5A.  50W is how much power it has to output max. So you take 50W divide by battery voltage. Yours are 3S batteries so up to 4.2V per cell 4.2x3=12.6V.  50/12.6=3.96A  So basically 4A when your battery is almost fully charged is the most you will get. Compared to a discharged battery 50/9.9=5.05A

Each battery is 5000mah 3s.  So lets say you discharged 4000mah from your battery  4000mah=4Ah.  That means your charger could charge each battery in about one hour at roughly 4.5A


One good thing is those batteries have a 1C charge rate of 5A(5000mah/1000=5) which is basically what your charger can handle.  Although your batteries have a max charge rate of 2C which is 10A, your charger can't handle it.

So with a larger charger you could do both batteries at the same time and up to a 2C charge rate.

Thanks glad I didn't have to write it up this time :slight_smile:

For reference I use a keenstone it's 80W they sell a slightly upgraded version for the same price now and it's been good to me.  I can charge a 5S at 3.5-3.6A before it starts to overheat.  With 5Ah batteries (two 5S I charge separately and join in series with a loopkey) it takes about 1hr 20min if fully depleted usually I recharge around 10-20% mark so takes around an hour per 5S.

One other thing to mention with a 245kv motor and at 42V fully charged you'd have a motor rpm of 10290 which with a 14 pole (7 pole pair) motor (think this is one) will be 7*10290 = 72,030erpm which is above the 60,000 limit where the DRV can blow out, would search the forum for threads on drv8302 failure and erpm limit.

Hmm just see 2x 5S in the original post did a miss a side conversation?  Anyhow yeah if it's lower voltage then might be fine with the 245 but just something to be aware of.

No, I should have really thought more about the parts before buying them. I plan on upgrading it a ton throughout the next few years so it will be top tier.
