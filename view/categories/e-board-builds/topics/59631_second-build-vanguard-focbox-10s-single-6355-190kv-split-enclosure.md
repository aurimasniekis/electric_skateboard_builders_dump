I want to know if it is possible to route those wires such as @whitepony
I don't want a broken board over time :sweat_smile:

as you can see from the picture, i laminated the routed areas with a layer of fiberglas to be safe! using the board since 3 years nearly daily now (around 20km/day), never failed me yet after using nowinds extreme ronin mount!

I have done this too, without the fiberglass even. It works great, never had a problem!

I know... is 60amp con. maybe thinking of 80A but that is to high for the cells. I have much space under the BMS and don't know to do something with it

Why don't you use a BMS for charging only and install a 10s4p?

I don’t trust myself with discharging. I want to have a BMS that check each groups off cells voltage. And off the weight. I have a 10s4p pack and don’t want to till that weight when walking. 

I am also building a pack that can do charging while driving. So if I want a large range, I can take that with me

@Eboosted 
I saw that you are using a 10s4p pack in your build. Does your housing fit perfectly on your board? When I insert my 10s4p pack into the housing, the housing rises a few millimeters

When i place my 10s3p pack in the enclosure, I have the same problem :confused:

It seems the issue is the Flex 2, the flex 3 has just a small gap that closes with the bolts. Try fitting the 10s3p and install the securing screws.
