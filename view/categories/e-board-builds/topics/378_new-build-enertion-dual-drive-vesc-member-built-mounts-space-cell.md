Hello folks, my name is Al, and I just ordered a bunch of parts from the boys down under (enertion) for my first build.  I ordered 2x6355s, 2xVESCs, 2x36Tdrivehubs, a set of wheels, 2x14Tpulleys and belts.

I'll be making my own aluminum mounts and welding them to the trucks, as well as making my own enclosure (really cool right up on here on how to mold a plastic enclosure)

I'm looking forward to my first build.

A lot of great information on this board.
Thanks
BigAl...

hey @BigAl its really nice to have a new member on here prepared to document their build... build threads are the best way to educate others & also its great to look back to see what your first build was like... my 1st was a joke :sob:  ..

anyway look forward to your progress.

So this is the deck I'll be using for my build, I like the retro style boards.

I would like to install a meter to keep tabs on the battery, what do you guys suggest?

Is it as simple as just putting a cheap LED meter on the battery wires before the VESC?

Which meter do you guys suggest?  I'll be using dual 6S packs for the dual drive setup.

The voltage will be 22.2V at full charge, so am I correct in thinking anything near 17.76V (22.2x.8=17.76) is approaching the end of my ride?

One last question (we all know thats not true!) where do you put the switch to turn the board on/off?

Thanks
BigAl...

I just use a cheap lipo alarm as my gauge. 
cost about $2 and has that added bonus of beeping when you are out of juice.

@BigAl n order to make the "E-board Builds" category really easy to search & locate specific builds i am asking that you change your title to something descriptive that better expresses the makeup of your build.

Most of the new build threads tend to end up with a name such as 
**"new- noob - noobie - beginner - first - build - help - newb"** this becomes hard to keep track of.

I would like to see each build thread with a descriptive title, such as;
**Project Name | Deck Name | Trucks | Motor type | Mounting method | Voltage/Battery | ESC**

Example
**The Samurai | Custom Deck | Paris Trucks |  R-SPEC | Custom Mount | 10S | VESC**

it basically put me in debt, which is why i'm about to start selling boutique completes for cash money. Its like people who start doing drugs and then can't support their habit and so they start selling drugs. Except skateboards. 

These things are a drug and should be in the top most addictive list alongside nicotine, heroine, caffeine, and sugar.

so my next question is regarding the space cell.  when I unpacked the cell this weekend I turned it on and it indicated 76%.  obviously when I charge it, it will indicate 100%, so my question is, how long can I use it for?  to what percentage can I discharge it to without causing any damage to the cell?

Thanks guys

So I finally found some time to work on the EBoard

Those of you who mentioned that my board was probably to small were correct.  As a matter of fact the spacecell by itself didn't fit between the trucks.  So the hunt for a new deck began.  I finally decided on a Cindrich billet deck.

I really like this deck, I have a racecar background so I'm really diggin the billet aluminum.

Then I had to decide on some grip tape and I found this on ebay.

I welded the torqueboards mounts and made an aluminum crossmember to minimize the flexing.

So here is the enclosure.  I tried to do it using the vacuum process but it didn't work out so good.  My oven isn't large enough, so I ended up having to mold it manually.  I would heat it with a torch and my friends would form it to the buck.  It turned out pretty good, next one will be better.

Is this still the correct wiring for the latest VESC?  I know the new VESC has 7 pins but are the 1,2 and 4,5 pins still the ones to use with the Nyko Kama controller?  It seems from the latest schematic that the pins are 1,2,3,4.

Also, which VESC does it go connected to?  does it even matter, are one of the VESC considered the "master"?
this is all I need to get this thing going

Thanks
Al...

So I flipped the VESC over and it seems:

pin 1 is ADC2 which from what I've read is not connected to the Nyko
pin 2 is Rx which goes to the green wire on the Nyko
pin 3 is Tx which goes to the blue wire on the Nyko
pin 4 is ADC which goes to the black wire on the Nyko
Pin 5 is GND which goes to the red wire on the Nyko

So if I'm correct, we only use pins 2-5 on the P3

Can someone please confirm this for me

Ok @sgaana and @elkick thanks to both of you for your help.

this is where I stand at the moment.

Firmware 2.5 installed on both VESCs, canbus jumper installed, Nyko receiver installed like the picture above (blue LED blinking) (BTW thanks elkick).

Both VESCs have the blue and green LEDs lit.  One of them is also blinking RED.

I'm able to connect using the BLDC Tool, my problem is it doesn't respond to input from the Nyko.

Assuming the Nunchuk receiver is connected to the master VESC, you need to enable it twice: first in the general app tab and second in the side Nunchuk tab. After that, you need to klick "write config" and then "reboot" (reboot is important!).

The blue led on the receiver should stay on when connected with the transmitter, not blinking.

## \#44 Posted by: elkick Posted at: 2015-12-23T22:39:52.607Z Reads: 161

SLAVE VESC needs Controller ID „1“  and  „Send Status over CAN“ configured. Nothing else (except motor detection).

MASTER VESC has Controller ID "0", and app configuration like described. And connected receiver, motor detection done, etc.

I assume that you connected the can bus with the middle pins only (which would be correct)? 
Also, just check again that the cables to the Nunchuk receiver are connected in the right way. Powering off/on the VESCs sometimes help to reset things. And always make sure to klick reboot (after "write config") when changing values.

@elkick yes, those are all done.  All of a sudden everything shut off.  I don't know what happened but I suspect the battery just went below the allowable voltage.  I had not charged the battery from new.  So I have it charging now, hopefully with a full charge everything will turn back on.  Assuming it does, I'm going to reflash the firmware on the slave.  I read on another post that might be the issue.  Thanks again for all of your help!

I only once had this strange behavior as well, it was related to a power connector not being plugged in strong enough and the VESC didn't receive enough power (voltage). Also it might be an idea to check the battery for voltage supply at the end where the VESCs are connected: are all those soldering spots ok, connectors ok and all the cells providing the voltage they should?

So after a lot of help from @chaka and a new pair of VESCs from him, I was finally able to ride my project.  Chaka was invaluable in getting my project running.  The VESCs arrived with proper flexible wires, heat shrink pre-cut to accept the appropriate connectors, oh and most importantly *working*.  Once I began to install them I had a few questions and Chaka immediately called me with all the answers to my questions.

This is a proper vendor!  Never once did he complain because I had questions as a matter of fact he seemed to enjoy helping a fellow Eboarder.  Folks, if you want to buy Eboard parts or accessories and don't want to have to walk on egg shells with the vendor, do yourselves a favor and don't hesitate to contact @chaka!

The first ride was a bit scary, this thing is *POWERFUL*,  if you do more than crack the throttle you will be horizontal very quickly!  I adjusted the parameters on the BLDC Tool and it took on a much kinder personality on both the throttle and brake.  I'm sure I'll get more comfortable the more I ride it but even the short rides I did today brought me big smiles :grinning:

Nice to hear you getting it dialed in. Keep me posted on your settings, sounds like you are making it very user friendly!

OK update time.  with more help from @chaka, I'm really fine tuning this thing.  First I must mention that Dual Drives are unnecessary unless you live in a hilly town, I weigh a svelte 225lbs and this thing on default settings was scary.  After modifying the settings several times (each time reducing power and throttle aggressiveness) I've finally gotten the ole girl to behave.  I've reduced the motor max, the throttle ramp and Erpms all in an effort to tame her.  I'm really glad these VESCs are programable.

I can't stress enough the customer support I've gotten from @chaka, top notch!

Hi BigAl, I know it's been a while since you posted this, but I've been looking at how others have designed their motor mounts, as I've had some made recently, but might need to modify them slightly. The grooves that contain the bolts to attach your motor to the mount, are they sunken in order to avoid the belt rubbing against the bolts? What bolts did you use? How much did you sink them?

The mounts that I used came from product/welded-motor-mount-63mm-motor/  I just welded them to the trucks myself.  (thread title can be confusing, originally I was going to make them then I found these) Yes, the bolts are countersunk to avoid the belt.  The depth is the hight of the head on the bolt.  Unfortunately I'm out of town and can't measure the depth.  I think the bolt is an M4 bolt, not sure.
