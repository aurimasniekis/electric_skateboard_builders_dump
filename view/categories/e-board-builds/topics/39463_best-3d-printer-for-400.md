I am waiting on a tevo tornado from aliexpress now actually. Think they are on sale today for 368$ or similar. Many consider it as the best printer for under 400$

I did a little research and the Creality CR-10 keeps coming back as the winner for around $500 .  Preston (Press Reset youtuber) is a big 3d print guru and he recommends the CR-10 as well.

Yeah I would definitely recommend the Tevo Tornado or CR-10 both are great printers for sub $400 and the biggest print volume for that price as well. I have a Anet E10 and it's quite nice, but has a smaller build volume.

I bought a Monoprice Maker Select V2 for $254 on sale. It's normally $299, but it's a surprisingly great budget 3D printer if you don't have a ton of cash to blow. You can buy a lot of filament with the remaining cash if you got this one. Haven't tried the Tevo.

Spend a couple hundred more and get one of these kits. You won't regret it: 

https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/59-original-prusa-i3-mk2-kit.html

If you really can't squeeze out that extra $200(trust me its worth it). Try to find a used printrbot simple metal on craigslist or something.. My simple metal has been flawless. 

OR, I just got done building one of these bad boys(mine is in cnc config, but you can make a 3d printer):

The CR 10 great for the price, even better the CR 10S. However, it's still a chinese Printer and can have some problems once in a while. But after 2 months of fairly heavy use i never truly regretted my purchase.

I'm running a wanhao i3 with Marlin firmware. To tell you the truth, I've printed everything with it (motor mounts, pulleys, enclosure, etc.); from the softest materials (for dampening) to the hardest ones (PETG with CF). It's a workhorse ;)

Today, CR10 really is a tough deal to beat.

@Hummie I use a Teebot on my side, not widely known but based on same Prusa / Marlin / Reprap style structure and firmware. 

Main goodies : 

- it comes with heated aluminum bed
- E3D hot-end
- "direct drive" type feed (can't remember the other type which feeds into a tube) 
- print area is a 200x140x300mm approx 
- it is a suitcase so it actually folds if you need to take it with you

My pros and cons after  more than 2 years with it : 
Pros 
+ it takes it all filament wise, no stuck or anything ; for Nylon and PETG it has done great
+ heated bed for some materials is a must (still a layer of washable Helmer for Nylon needed, nothing  else for the rest) 
+ actually durable and is almost "Ready to print" 
+ regular performance IMO (no random issues) 

Cons
= it is a bit soft due to suitcase walls and 2x single rails on Z axis (would be solved with T pillar and 2x dual rails)
= cooling of the control unit is flawed from standard so I had to rethink it (caused errors during print after some time) 
= I'm a dumbass so never took time to set up nozzle correctly, it leaks a tiny bit
= it is **noisy** and will upset your wife

I was looking on the market but apart from a DLP SLA type printer like Duplicator i7 or better I realized I may be better off upgrading what I have.

I can't recommend enough trying HIPS and PETG for hard materials. Cheap quality parts strong and able to take hits. Nylon is hard to print correctly and softer material but it is also really hard to destroy. More like "it can tear not break" style.

If anybody has ideas to make it 40-43db max that'd be great, right now it would be around 50-60db when motors move  which is too much.

Necroposting is replying to old dead threads bringing them back to the top. :slight_smile:

I think walls block drafts and that can help maintain temperatures perhaps even better than a roof.

What a pain 3d printing is. I spent like 5 hours figuring out 1st layer for petg again -- for some reason my z height shifted about .2mm but not for all filament types. This is just to print a truck riser pad.Running a prusa so it's supposedly one of the easier ones. Sometimes I feel I've been enslaved by the thing.

I use a CR-10 now and it's been great, printed a 700mm enclosure. Will take pictures soon.. but before that I had monoprice and hictop printers that were great also.

Been 3D printing cases for a while now. Print most cases in PLA. They are usually like 20+ hr prints so PLA is pretty much a sure thing that it's not going to fail. Just monitor the first few layers.

Everything else I print with PETG. This is risers, gears, washers, and anything that takes less than 8 hour. 

Used to print in ABS but the smell was pretty intense since I print indoors. Slurry is the only thing that keeps those prints down.

Microcenter has very good prices on filaments and they haven't failed me yet 

Also I use Simplify3D or Cura as my slicer.

Does the CR-10 do auto/mesh bed leveling (where it probes around the bed before starting the print?) I've heard some of them (maybe was just early run of them) had some issues with the borosilicate glass being warped a bit.  Have been using a prusa i3 (v1) based kit for a few years and it's still been good to me but would be nice to have that extra build volume and the CR-10 seems reasonably priced.  I'm a bit hesitant since I heard about the warped bed thing and a buddy of mine bought another creality one (the ENDER) and has been nothing but trouble (controller board is not programmed and flashing over ICSP says it worked but then acts crazy like the clock rate is wrong or something).

PLA is definitely like cheat codes. But...  Do the enclosures hold up? Under mechanical/heat stress, and under UV exposure? Do you do anything to reinforce them?

I'm using a PLA one right now, I've had it since Oct 2017 and haven't had major issues with it.  I did design it poorly with regard to some places where it is under stress from making the batteries removable so those parts cracked but in general it has held up surprisingly well.  Originally I had planned to make a mold from the PLA print then pour resin into the mold to make solid plastic parts but after realizing how much silicone that was going to take and what a pain it would be to make the thin walls I decided screw it I'll use the original.  I added some filler used for rusty spots on cars to help smooth out the print and maybe added some strength but probably not much and added some white gloss spray paint on top of that to make it look nicer.

Since this thread has been revived: :stuck_out_tongue:

I sold my printrbot a couple months ago and bought a CR-10S, and a Prusa MK3. The CR-10s has been flawless. Cr-10s is a great printer for the money, and it's almost an unbeatable value. They Creality Ender-3 also came out recently, its under $200, and has been getting really good reviews in the facebook group. The ender-3 is essentially a smaller cr-10(except its 24v[good]).

The MK3 is awesome now, but I had some issues with it at first and prusa had to send me a replacement. The replacement has been flawless, and it prints beautifully. EDIT: I think the MK3 needs some time to get the bugs worked out before I can recommend it fully...

Get a cr-10/cr-10s, you wont regret it.

@deucesdown yeah enclosures hold up fine. Can't really bash it into a curb though... It's mostly to protect from dirt, rocks, water, etc.. I use silicon caulk to fill in gaps and I use Velcro to keep everything onto the board and the enclosure really just keeps it's pressed on to the Velcro. I'll paint or spray platidip on them also, not always though. 
I have had some enclosures break when I first started printing because they were supporting the weight of the battery and all the vibrations, and I was not using Velcro or double-sided tape for the components. They broke around the screws or layers would seperate cause I didn't have the write settings. Learned from my mistakes and have been all good since then.

@wafflejock only issue I've had was the heated bed stopped working a few days ago. Contacted support after 2 day back and forth and me sending a video of the issue they are sending me a new bed. Besides that Im really enjoying the printer. Glass did not come warped, leveling is manual but very easy after printing larger leveling knobs, and dimensions are very accurate when printing.

I recently switched to petg, its now my favorite filament. No warping at all, flexible and tough, no odour. Adheres to a bare mirror with ease, and pops right off when its cool. Should have tried it ages ago.

Prusa i3 clone acrylic frame paid $100 (new)👍 able to run PLA, PETG, ABS, NYLON, IGUS, HEMP, stainless steel, carbon fiber. No issues other than carbon fiber chewing the crap out of nozzles.  Been using for long time now almost none stop it seems 🤪

Some add ons could give your printer;
•Mosfet board or SSR
•ttl smoother (between steppers and driver board) helps if machine is skipping steps.
•24v heat bed
•autobed leveling

Also built one from scratch modeled like prusa i3.  Gave me way more knowledge of how it works and whats important to get right.

Currently digging the MPCNC as you can swap many tools in and out, laser, end mill, pen, hot end, sander, drag knife, router( instead of end mill), and can adjust work area by different size bars and belts, really sweet part is you can have multiples of anyone of the above mentioned tools running at same time simply by adding more gantries.


Edit; forgot to add TPU & TPE (my belt making material 😉)

Due to lack of space I run a CR-10 mini... It's a super easy printer to setup compared to my old rigidbot kit.

But the mini lacks a second Z motor, also CR-10s are Bowden driven so you might have problems if you need to do flexible prints..

Yeh but you know that it's not 100% carbon fiber or metal. Those are small particles that are fused inside PLA usually or ABS to give additional strength. To me it's more for advertisement. If you want strengh than either PETG, ABS or Nylon is the way to go.

They claim it is as strong as aircraft grade aluminium and 40% lighter. If that's true then you can even print mounts, pulleys and other motor accessory parts. The downside might be cost per part which could be more expensive vs CNC'ed aluminum.
From the website it looks like their target market is Aerospace and Biomedical, so the cost for filaments might be prohibitive for esk8 applications.

A friend of mine has one. 
800gr black onyx filament for ~290€ 
so about 35ct per gramm. So use your slicer and think about if it is worth. I think they even have a printing service where you can get your parts made. At least my friend had some parts tested before actually buying it.
It is really nice for small parts. Seen some jet impellers and bearing mounts. Things you usually mill from aluminium. So far they hold up nice.

But this is a little bit of topic since the printer it self is about 16000€, 800gr filament is within the price range of the topic :joy:
