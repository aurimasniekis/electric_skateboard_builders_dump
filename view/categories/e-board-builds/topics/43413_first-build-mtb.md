Hey guys, 

Just started my build.

Based on a mbs comp 95x board.

2x focbox,  with 190kv 6374s

I am waiting on pulleys and belts, but have started prototyping the motor mounts today! (only plywood so far :P)

Tom.

Looks nice, but I see a big problem in your design:

- You need to make it able to move the motor away from and back to the axis of the hanger or use a movable idler pulley, other ways you won't be able to have the exact belt tension.

Have a great time with modelling and the built it self :)

What Steve said - you need some way to adjust the belt tension, either by moving the motor, moving an idler pulley, or making the mount itself longer/shorter.

Oh yeah I know, I will cut slots in the final mounts, this was just to test :)

Another thing to consider is that the mount is a little close to the deck. The motor or the mount may hit the deck while cornering.

Yeah maybe, I would take out the 2 springs, so you can see at full movement

Motor mount mk2, clears the board ok.
