Hello, 

I am Eldert Zeinstra from the Netherlands and i am 21 years old I study engineering in Groningen. 
After considering for a while Danny Bokma and Ray Blokker persuade me to build a electric skateboard.
I though it was great fun to drive and also very useful in the city or at the campus.

I have absolutely no experience with skating or anything like it. 
But I do have a little experience with solar-boat racing where we also use brushless motor's and lithium polymer battery's hope this will help while building and designing :) 

The idea is to build a reliable hub motor that still has a lot of rubber to squeeze to provide a smooth ride.
The first components have arrived with the post :slight_smile: 
Now i have these parts i can start designing the aluminium hub.
when i have finished some solidworks drawings i wil show them to u.

some specs:
alienmotor 6355- kv60
abec11 clones from alibaba 90x52mm 
paris 190mm trucks.

Kind regards,

Today i have made the first drawings of the hub.
in my opinion it looks ok. 
Now I'm hoping for some critical comments :slight_smile:
Thank you.

I did a version very similar long ago.   If you're not planning to modify the wheel there's not much room.  I did it so the wheel wouldn't have to be cut/modified and Therefore used smaller bearings and they deteriorated quickly.  Also skate hangers aren't straight after they cast the aluminum around the axle and if the rotor is supported with bearings sitting on the axle yet the stator is far away they can misalign by too much.  It's super fun and look forward to seeing how you do it.  Maybe get the motors lever uses as they have a skirt bearing that allows a lot more room.   Expect to spend eons on a lathe and mill trying to get things precise with an imprecise skate axle though. Maybe I'm wrong and u have a better approach than what I did.

I used a tacon160

I think that when something is well thought out it mostly automatically looks good.
why do the people do not like it?

I do modify the wheel to fit the aluminium hub inside. but you are correct the motor is not really inside the wheel.
inline or direct drive motor is probably a better name:)

there was only one motor on the photo but I have 2 :grin: of course i will make it a dual drive. I hate asymmetric things

 can you post pics of the different parts separated?  specifically the connection between the rubber and the rotor looks difficult.  how to shape the wheel and connect it seems a lot of work.  if you do it with the other motors that cavon uses with the skirt bearing then you can have the rotor supported on both sides with a bearing and not be as vulnerable to bangs and more importantly you can be assured the stator and rotor will line up precisely .    Maybe you haven't seen on endless-sphere someone named stylz first used this motor with the skirt bearing and explained how to do it.

Really like this, i can't wait to hear how this motors work out.
You could pot windings, and leave the backside of the motor open, that would look sick :space_invader:

O nordle is excited and pulled out the upside down purple bug!  
The kv of those motors, are u going to reterminate them wye to drop the kv? I'm dying to convince someone to do it strand by strand with an led and little battery if you're up in the air about it. 

 I wonder how long this is going to take you.  I spent like 6 months doing it. 
 All these direct drive obsessed people are coming out of the woodwork in this thread.  I bet you all like to use one tool for everything too trying to make it work.  I say that because in retrospect taking a motor apart and then putting it back together is the harder more diy way 
This is a classic attempt. 
Beware of how skate axles aren't straight as I say though without a bearing on either side to keep it lined up with the rotor. To get the stator and rotor aligned because of this I ended up wrapping the stator in 2 layers of duct tape while epoxying it to the hanger, then sliding the rotor with its wheel and the supporting bearings on the axle on top of it.  This was so it would be positioned ok even though the axle is bent a bit. then when epoxy cured take the duct tape out and put the motor back together.  Not a bad way to fix the stator position though and my failure was tiny bearings

Here is a screenshot of the aluminium hub.
The center of the wheel needs to be machined out to diameter of 30 mm. then only a piece of the spokes remains. 
When everything is going as planned the aluminium hub will need a slight press to fit inside the wheel. 
The wheel will be secured by a 3 mm plate with 6 m3 bolts.

From the bearings to the outer ring of the motor the max distance is just over 40 mm. this shouldn't be a problem if the bearing aren't worn out right? 
Or do skate bearings normally have a lot more backlash than industrial bearings?
Of course everything needs to be aligned pretty well, but i don't think that this will be a problem.

Because you can't replace them with of the shelf wheels? or do you just don't like machining? haha
Yes they are not round en concentric with the steel shaft. i have to machine it to a bit smaller diameter so the adapter for the stator can slide over it.
i am not sure if it is a good idea to fix the stator with a press/lLoctite.
maybe its better to use a keyway and a smal bolt to secure it?
```

Only cause you can't replace with off the shelf wheels, but it's your personal hubmotor, if you're not going to sell them it doesn't matter anyways.

The epoxy/loctite probably will hold (i glued mine, however i'm not confident with my actual design). Keyway or bolt is more elegant.

btw, could you tell me stator size? 6355 is the bell i assume?

Yep, and the machining will probably cost like 10 minutes are so.

I always find it scary to glue parts that gets a dynamical load. there is always a change that it will suddenly break without any warning. Maybe i am just way to cautious.

diameter is 63 and its 30 mm long. no idea where the 55 stands for.

I'm assuming you're going to lathe down the hanger to slide the stator on.  You say there's 4cm distance between where the bearings sit and the beginning of the rotor.   then the rotor will  add more distance that needs to be aligned.   maybe spin the hanger on the lathe now to see just how much it is going to be off before you commit to a method.   if you glue the stator down you could adjust it's orientation in relation to the rotor a bit to get it aligned better.  .  I had planned to just lathe it down and slide and pin down the stator but the bent hanger was too much and resorted to aligning the stator by slightly over machining the hanger and filling the void with thick glue. Glue is super strong. .

Yes that's right. the bushing that is pressed inside the stator will have a sliding fit on the hanger.
I will leave some space for an additional bearing on that bushing. Don't know if i can cal it a skirt bearing?
So far is i now this hanger isn't that bend but i will check it before i lathe it down ;)

I have done some machining on the hubs yesterday. 
unfortunately the 4mm mill was vibrating caused a rough finish.

update!
The outer ring of the motor is been pressed in to the hub:)
It was a little bit difficult to measure the diameter of the outer ring because it wasn't perfectly round.
So i was a little bit nervous about the fit because it has to be in place perfectly instantly.
It was the intention to have a shrink fit of about 0.08 mm.

At work we have a hydraulic press with heating plates for curing carbon parts witch i used for pressing the parts together.
the hub was first cleaned and heated to 80 degrees Celsius to let it expand.
Also the edge of the outer ring is been sanded to get rid of the paint.

Luckily the fit was perfect:) it needed about 2 tons to get it in place.
I've used Locktite  603 to be sure it is secure for ever.

Now the only things that have to be done is drilling and threading the m3 holes for the carbon wheel attachment plate.

Thanks :D 
But the board isn't going anywhere at the moment. 
Today the hanger was modified on the lathe at school. 
It was a bit tricky to fasten in on the lathe because the shape of the hanger.
the most important was that the cylindrical part i had to lathe was concentric with the steel axle of the hanger.
With the collet in the lathe the steel axle is almost perfect lined out so this couldn't be better.
I had to be very careful because the tool was pointing out way too far.

In the first picture it is very clear to see how rough the dimensions of the cast hanger are.

Good evening!

I've spend some time on the lathe again :slight_smile:
This was the last structural part of the motors that had to be machined.
Again a very tight press fit between the bushing and the stator.
The stator had a diameter of 20.0mm so I made the bushing 20,05 mm.
The internal diameter of the bushing was 0.02 to big before pressing it in to the stator.
When it was pressed together the internal diameter was just about right.

To be honest I have no idea :blush:.
 When i calculate the speed without counting the losses, the speed should be 45 km/h.
It was my intention to reach 30 km/h.

I haven't weighed the complete board it yet. but i know that both wheels with motors weigh about 1,4 kg.
Do you know how much a set of motors with gears wheels and pulleys weight? 
Just to compare.

Today i visited Danny (JTAG) to work on my board in his mancave.
I have almost no experience with electronics and with setting up the vesc, so danny helped me with that today:)
it was very exiting to see the motor make its first spins.
first we tried testing with a 4s lipo battery because my own 12s battery pack isn't ready yet.
After a few indoor tests we concluded that a single motor running on 4s doesn't have enough power.
So we used a huge 12s 1.8 kw/h li-ion pack of Danny's electric scooter.
It runs very smooth and it makes almost no sound, so i am happy with that.
because its sensorless you need to give a hard push before it starts.
at speeds above lets say 10 km/h it begins to run good.
I am designing a new back plate for the motor that includes holders for 3 hall sensors. next week i can use the new 3d printer of my university to print these new plates :slight_smile:

Testing with one motor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc6VkNiB0SE
motor is getting warm quite fast when accelerating from stand still and low speed driving once i drive 20 km/h it is fine. the top speed is arround 30 km/h but acceleration isn't very impressive at 25 A .

after an evening soldering with Danny finely both controllers are working :D 
the way back from the train station to my home was also the first dual motor test of the board because the buses where not riding anymore at 2 am.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60iQeSd0S0g

at new asphalt roads it just unbelievable how quit it is. you only hear the wheels rolling.
with dual motors it has enough torque to pull me up the tiny hills we have in Holland. at a nice flat road the top speed is about 38 km/h

I haven't done much to this project past few months because of the rainy weather in the Netherlands. 
When i was testing I didn't have a BMS and i forget to unconnect the battery wires. When i came home again the voltage was near zero :( 
so the first battery pack is destroyed.
I have ordered a chinese 12s bms and a new set of battery's. I only have to connect them.
Because the deck had more flex then i expected I made a 3D printed battery holder that can bend without bending the lipo cells.

I think he's talking about the can wobbling out of alignment on the inside (away from the wheel), because there is no bearing on that side. Seems like you've solved that with a very solid press-fit into the back of the motor & the extended axle to absorb ground forces without motor can wobble, but it's still a question in many people's minds about durability.

no i mean the casing of the magnets, since the bearings are on the wheels but at two side of the stator, which might cause the ring casing to move

maybe if the glue comes loose or something. but when you have a regular motor that would also give problems. 
the outer ring of the motor is pressed with about 2 tons on a press preheated at 80 degree with one of the strongest loctite's. I don't think that its going to move unless it gets hit by a rock or something. 
Only way to get to know if its going to come lose is testing :slight_smile:

I have pulled everything apart to make it ready for the season:)
Because i didn't trust the smal hex bolt for the fixation of the stator, I mounted it with loctite for a almost permanent fit.
the steel outer ring was a little bit oval witch result in variation in air gap between the stator and rotor. 
I didn't like it so i made a reinforcement ring to force it to the round shape it has to be. 
Now i only have to redesign the cap on the back side of the motor, this cap has to be in two pieces now when the stator is permanently mounted. 
They turn super smooth:)

After some riding time i think its know the time to show some results. 
the last few weeks i used my board almost every day riding 10 km in Groningen.
Yesterday i made a trip of 15,6 km. 
I started with 50,3 volt in the battery and after the trip the voltage was 44 volt.
After another 7 km the battery was at 38 volt and had to conventionally skate to home.

The outer rings of the motor's are getting some serious punishment from stones etc.

Yup, i still have to make a 3 d printed cap including hall sensors. 
all the dust and moist that can come in which will always do, can come out easily this way. 
Every time the motors are a little bit dirty i blow them out with compressed air.
However some small stones or debris could possibly destroy the magnets i guess. 
So i have to be a little bit careful on gravel paths :stuck_out_tongue:

The most people doesn't even notice that I am on a esk8. 
Only when I am accelerating up a small hill they realize there is something special underneath my board.
when I have to pas a police I just slow down and normal skate till i am out of sight. 
Because of the hub motors it rolls almost just like a normal non electric board.

Thank you!
No I am still riding it without the covers. I am in the UK for an internship right now and the British roads are really demolishing my board:sob: The enclosure begins to tear apart and there are some serious dents in the aluminium ring on the outside of the motor. So I am now planning to upgrade my board with some pneumatic tires and belt drives. Or maybe even some big ass hub motors.
Riding in London was quite scary in the beginning but after some time I really had a great time. I met a guy in Hyde park on a boosted board, we switched boards and had a great ride together!

I´d like to copy your design and wonder if you are ready to share your 2D drawings for the hub incl. the dimensions.
