Thanks for checking it out! And thanks again to everybody who helped me throughout the entire build process from parts selection to configuration. Thanks also to all the members who posted their processes, results, and links, I wouldn't have pulled off half the cool stuff without all the info I found here.

Awesome thanks. I think I am going to go with a 14/60. Loaded speed still will only be about 26 but it will still have solid torque (I think). Plus I can always change out the pulley later 

Purchased the trucks and some FocBoxes to use until the ESCape's are ready. Will probably stick with the 10S5P on the way until my bank account recovers enough to switch it back to the other board and upgrade this build to 12s4p

Still on the hunt for the right motors

Ok I've ordered everything but the enclosure, remote + receiver.

The enclosure I am going with @psychotiller Cohron Split. Instead of waiting for the battery, can I just get the max size that will fit nicely on a Rayne Vendetta 39? That way it should look nice and even rather than having it be closer to the back trucks or centered on the deck with space on top and bottom. If anyone knows what size that is it would save me some time and I could order today :slight_smile:

I need a remote+receiver. What can I have delivered in California in the next couple weeks that is awesome? Nano X? Mini? (the Photon is on hold until I recover from this splurging, but I would like something nice for <$100) 

Anyway thanks for any help!

Escape has hardware 6.1. Build originally intended for 12S4P and I felt the escapes would handle that build with less risk of blowing anything. Still plan on changing the pack but on indefinite hold at least until I finish this build and recover monetarily

Although I purchased mounts pulleys wheels for 90mm as well I will more than like ride the 6" tires more frequently of the two

Man that is a perfect fit! Hey I read somewhere you can do custom cutouts?

Seconds before checking back on this thread I finished checkout and bought that Dual ESC Case with Fins lol. Do you have an enclosure that will fit the 10s5p, with the Focboxs inside the heatsink case witrh a cutout so the fins are sticking out?

No worries man.

I might need something just a tad longer to account for the extra 1/2" added by the cooling case.

I think I am going to order the Altar Wedge in that case, that should fit my Vendetta 39 pretty well, right?

Alright guys all that's left is a remote+receiver. We knocked out just about everything else today lol

But now that I went all splurge happy I want it to be even more perfect (for me).. so I think I need to do away with my through-board hardware and pick up the hardware to countersink it under the deck. 

Oh and some wire sleeves for the motor wires, still need to order those

So I updated the vesc firmware, flipped an inner tube around, assembled my drivetrain and threw it all on my deck for adjustment.

![27|345x194](upload://6dhM4eXyzp95myCj7M0XV00kER8.jpg)

Oh the 6" drop through blues lol. 

I really wanted to use the drop through to keep myself as low to the ground as possible, but unfortunately if I carve hard I get wheel bite. I already have dropthrough backing frames on the way (was going to use them under the deck between the wood and hardware) so when they come in I will just have to top mount the sonuvabitch :confused:

![45|690x388](upload://dWDHZKXE0fI13ei0vw1n8TNbmi0.jpg)

Not a big deal though I knew this was going to be a possibility. I don't really want to shave the deck cause I love the deck as is lol

Top mounted if I carve deep as I can I still get a little wheel bite in the rear. Should I just bite the bullet and shave the corners off? I have some 1/2" risers in the garage I can use, but damn ANOTHER 1/2" higher lol

I also thought about drilling new truck holes a little further outward, but I can't because the inward side hardware had nowhere to go to due to the center hole of the drop-through

Your only solution would be TKP trucks. That would give you an extra 1"+ of wheelbase. (the hanger is on the other side of the kingpin)

Or cut those wheel wells out.

Thanks man. I think I'm going to try trimming out the wheel wells. If I went the new trucks route I'd probably have to replace some other stuff as well.

Is there an TKP baseplate that works with the TB 218mm hanger? (that might be a dumb question but I honestly don't know)

## \#31 Posted by: Colson003 Posted at: 2018-04-13T06:48:05.548Z Reads: 187

Trimming and/or stiffer bushings would be your best bet. Like using a riptide fatcone boardside to make the turn progressively harder. 

No, there aren’t any TKP baseplates to fit RKP trucks.

It just has the stock TB bushings in there right now as I'm still assembling. I have Orangatang Yellows on my other boards to switch to this one so I'll give it a try thanks

Can I turn the rear truck around? maybe wedge it to get the angle to 0+? 

I've never done that on any longboard in my life cause I never needed to, just wondering before I start grinding away at the deck

ENCLOSURE, BATTERY, RIPTIDE BACKING MOUNTS Delivered!

Will pick this build back up when I get back from Anaheim this weekend

Also, my 10" griptape just arrived, so on Monday I will lasercut my griptape for this build. Already came in over the weekend to test all my settings and setup my jig. All I need to do is cut out a piece, send the artwrk to the laser and press go everything else is ready

Quick update. Waiting on remote and vesc housing to complete the build. When the housing shows up I can size the cutout and finish attaching the enclosure.

To get rid of wheel bite and still use drop through I routed and sanded the deck. 

![20180416_161141|690x388](upload://RgM3BB8htk1BQICXJ5fCdL5dNp.jpg)![20180416_160838|690x388](upload://oEXQJVBtfDOA88p5d30j9mDO0mc.jpg)![20180416_204512|690x388](upload://mj8w6q9iBDDGw4MY7ZKmdH06yuL.jpg)

Changed to drop through, using some sweet backing plates from Riptide. They are even based in my hometown so shipping was lightning quick + I got a cool note lol. I switched to reverse mount and made some adjustments. Then I got most of the grip tape applied! I accidentally put it on upside down but that's ok I like it. Once I f it up I'll replace with a wholly new design every time anyway lol

![20180417_002306|281x500](upload://6CoN5bdZkbLMgAVNSiVUZluzxIV.jpg)

Hoping to have my housing in the next two days, as well as a temporary remote/Bluetooth module until the photon shows up

@DeathCookies Thanks man! I had my heart set on drop through form the beginning so I'm glad I changed it back too. With the big 6" tires I was already so high off the ground it just made sense :D 

@mmaner  Thanks man! I still need to work out a better transfer process. I ended up foregoing the transfer tape completely last night. I just laid it on the board, picked out the pieces I wanted to stick, peeled, and put back in like a big stencil. Was easy but really time consuming with so many pieces. I should have done a video for the stencil peel it was really satisfying to see the image appear

@lazerusrm Oh no your Photon was DoA?? That's rough man, I've been pining or one since before I bought my first part for this build. I did buy a temporary/backup remote and bluetooth module from Build Kit Boards sale which already got shipped out. Just in case :D

Now THAT is the million dollar question lol. I'm still experimenting with different transfer options. There has got to be an easier way than what I did for this first one, but I got tired of experimenting and wanted to see it on there!

For this specific one I did it manually. Once I lasercut the sheet I laid it on top of the board, then pulled a piece without moving the rest of the sheet, peeled the adhesive backing, and put right back on the board. Basically I used the sheet itself as a stencil. It was very easy to line up accurately, however with so many small pieces it was very time consuming

I think for my other board I will do a nice big pattern, then make an actual stencil out of cardstock or something. Doing it through the tape as a stencil works fine too.

```
you could also use something like vinyl tape as a transfer medium. Typical transfer tape wouldn't work well with grip, but if you make your own with something gummier, like generic low quality duct tape (i wouldn't use Gorilla tape!) or something akin to Gaff tape, that would work well i imagine because the glue from grip tape is stronger than the crap vinyl tape when applied to what is essentially a sandy surface.
```

Thanks for the input I will give some cheap duct tape a try!

So far I have tried regular transfer tape and hot pink vinyl lol. The transfer tape did not work at all and even the vinyl's adhesive wasn't strong enough to hold the grip while I peeled the grip. It worked in some areas but did not hold strong enough for others. However that pink vinyl was the last of my vinyl stock and is at least 5 years old, so the adhesive might have degraded over time. 

I'd love to find an option that works well, because intricate full sheets are much more doable when you can transfer the whole design at once.

I feel pretty confident that the colored "duck tape" at Wal-Mart in the craft section would totally work if you simply laid it in strips across the rough side. Its probably sticky enough to stay on the grip but weak enough to be removed.

Perfect! I'll see if I can pick up some on lunch, I still have some scraps of 10" and a full sheet of 9" to test with 

Would anybody happen to know a good source for 10" wide sheets that come flat, not rolled? I have used both flat sheets and a rolled sheet and the flat was 10x easier to get good equal focusing across the sheet. The rolled stuff likes to raise in sections while it cuts

keep us posted! i want to know if this works because if it does i may try to kiss some grip from the glue/paper side on the x-carve after taping the front side. Also they have laser cutter mods for the x-carve which i want to try also, hopefully later this year. I want to get into custom MOB grip cutting as an option.

[/quote]

if you can't find any, try this: roll out a section grip side down. Peel the backing down almost all the way length wise, then reapply as you hold it flat. For example, use your right hand to hold the backing up while using your left hand to creep across and press the backing down while keeping it flat simultaneously. It worked for me a couple of times.

Another option is the 12" squares MOB sells.

MOB tape laser cuts beautifully! I've tried MOB, Black Diamond, and Jessup so far all gave clean crisp results running at high speed. Make sure you have fume extraction setup or you will be choking on that chlorine gas, which is also bad for machine components. The 3w mod may not work for this application but it might. I would stick to at least a 30w CO2 or comparable strength laser. For this design I used 80% Speed 100% power on a 60w CO2 laser, and while you can't up the power you can always drop down the speed. 1/8" birch ply is around 15speed/100power on a 60w, so if you can confirm your laser will cut veneers or thin wood it should be fine.

Thanks for the tip on the rolled grip, I can see how it would work with the backing holding the tape into its new shape. Will give it a try if I can't find any full sheets. I've been eyeing that big roll of Jessup on Amazon for a week now lol

Came back to the office after my girls went to bed. (the mother is one of the girls don't freak out they're not alone lol)

@mmaner Thanks to the wonderful idea from @longhairedboy, I believe we have a workable solution for transfer the design.
  
The Mrs. picked me up some black Duck (brand) Tape from Wally World. Get ready for too many pictures.

![Bailee Grip Tape|690x230](upload://f9AOXatBXrn9ReQXJCWMjLhF3dJ.jpg)

Should looks like this. I had to make sure to leave tape enough to cover the battery channels that are in the deck. The longer of her two boards is actually the spare BF2 deck from a deck swap

Sorry for the super lengthy picture post. It kinda started as a step by step of how I did it but damn is that some scrollin'

Some pictures got flipped and some you need to enlarge to see all of it (Like what final tape is projected to look like. The 10 minute artwork that is my daughters tape finished while I typed this beast, so I'm going to tape it and clean up my office and head home

BUILD UPDATE

Had a couple connectors come in, so I made an adapter for my battery and soldered 5.5mm bullets on my FOCBoxes so they'd match my motors. I also installed the motor keys which came in

Update o clock. Updated the firmware on both vescs again, configured them, setup an hm-10 receiver and connected to acks app.

Because I had to trim my deck I'll be modifying the enclosure a bit to get a perfect fit. Bought a heat gun for some minor bending, and will cut out part of the back to fit the fins of the heat sink enclosure through. Received all inset hardware/washers, but cant measure hole placement until I've modified the enclosure. Just waiting on the 3dservisas enclosure which is currently floating around usps

Still waiting on photon to be shipped, received a mini in the meantime. Noticed i needed to grab rechargeable AAs so I just bought some. Plugged all 4 in to charge and 3 fucking inches away on the counter I spot a small pile of rechargeable AAs lol dammit

Am thinking about making a firefly, it looks awesome too

Daughters grip tape had too many fine lines, so we peeled it and painted the top of the deck hot pink. Will do a new tape for her this week when I get more full sheets

@trancejunkiexxl pm me your shipping address I should have big enough scraps to make you one :)

Build Update!

Everything came in yesterday! Installed the grommets for the enclosure, went to program the remote, could not find my ppm servo cable. Went home it wasnt there either, but my girls saw me (and my wife had today off so her bedtime wasn't early like normal) so I was "trapped" there lol

Came in today and I finally found the cable! I had thrown it with the parts I wont be using cause I decided to go can instead of split y, then changed last minute to can w/ split y just in case with both set to PPM+UART

![53|690x388](upload://21lX8eVsTweDiFKyF8cTdnunORJ.jpg)

Ran motor detection on both escs seperately, linked everything back up via can and setup the mini remote I have while I wait for Photon/Firefly

Everything works beautifully and it is actually quieter than I'd imagined.

As soon as I get off work I will swap the battery pack for a wooden "battery", slap it on the deck and deform it with a heat gun. Then it's time to mark and place all my pilot holes for the hardware, install the inset screws, make cutouts for charge/power/heatsink, and it will finally be rideable!!! (i'd say done but lets face it I probably won't last a week before I start tinkering again)

When you deform your enclosure with the heat gun do you have a specific technique to hold it in place while you heat? Do you strap it down to the board using something that can stand up to the heat? (flat nylon webbing, bungee cord, velcro strapping,...?)

I use painters tape. Most of the bending will be done on the outside edges at the end, so put the enclosure where you want it and tape the crap out of it in the center of the enclosure.

First I made a wooden "battery" out of scrap. Then I positioned the enclosure and started heating her up. Then I did the things I started typing above lol clamped and moved. It was honestly super easy. I only made one bad scuff mark when I was checking the softness 

Pro-tip, use a block or straightedge to press down your edges, these temps are too hot for mortal fingers lol

Man I should have picked up some welding gloves lol, I just touched some hot plastic too (while cutting, deforming is over) would have helped then. Or if I could have patiently waited 10 seconds for that piece of melted plastic to cool. Just sized and did the housing cutout. All inserts are done (except final two once the electronics have been placed in there to make sure. About to do the charge/power ports. If I can get this all assembled I can test it under load. All that's left after assembly is neoprene foam. I'll toss some marine silicone sealant in any gaps before I head home and call it a night

Had the drill turned up to high and it got squirrely on me. Hows that for f-ing it up in the 4th quarter

Oh well. On Friday I'll disassemble again, use some high heat JB Weld to fill any cracks, then seal it with marine silicone and do the foam.

As for right now.... wellll I need to take it apart again. I didn't notice during detection but one of my motors is going the wrong way lol. Guess I need to swap the phase wires and run detection again

Neoprene foam showed up! Also, a roll of 3m dual lock I don't remember ordering. Must have been the same night I ordered the foam, awake too late amazoning in bed lol

So today I will add the foam and trim the bit of overhang on the back of the enclosure, probably add some dual lock to the inside of the enclosure for the battery, cause last night I took off everything and while moving my board the battery fell right out of the enclosure and scared the shit out of me. Thought I broke everything, but we're good lol

All I have left after that is to jb weld any large opening, seal with the silicone, and replace the cable sleeve with the smaller size I have on the way. Also, probably should pick up a hot knife to cut this sleeving correctly cause last nights is already fraying a bit

The nut is there still it's in the picture. It melted out around it the outer shield and main outer ring came out while rolling. I found out it had melted the inside too when I took the wheel off.

I didn't overtighten it or anything I know better than that

When I say loose I mean with no axle, putting the bearing in and turning the wheel upside down the bearing would fall out. It wasn't tight in its wheel core seat like normal wheels

My replacement hub came yesterday, installed easily and spins true. I also replaced all the idler bearings with Neil Ceramics as during disassembly I found 2 more of the stock bearings had started falling apart. My board no longer sounds like a sword continuously unsheathing, although that did match the theme nicely it was causing breakdowns and generating a lot of heat.

The other hub, the one that wasn't damaged by the seized bearing, has not spun true since day one. I've completely disassembled and re-assembled it but it still has a wobble. Last night so the wobble wouldn't cause rubbing on the idler/mount I added a 3rd speed ring. That was one too many lol, Lost a nut around a turn, bearing and spacer popped out and wheel rolled into someones fence. I ran it out so I didn't get hurt, couldn't find the bearing or the spacer so me and my daughter went back this morning and FOUND THEM! Woo!

So today's mission is to make the original left driven wheel spin true. Wish me luck. Right now I'm thinking some 400 grit sandpaper on a flat glass worktop, a little rubbing then lay down baby powder to look for inconsistencies. 

If anyone has any better suggestions for truing it let me know. Not only did I almost just replace the whole damn set with aluminum ones (and be out another $300+), I started learning Fusion 360 cause my boss is interested in buying me a small cnc. So I am exploring as many options as I can lol

Before I start sanding down the hub pieces I wanted to be sure those pieces are the issue. I have been searching and it could be that the tire itself is not true? (turns out it wasn't, was typing this while I was re-assembling)

Anyway I disassembled, used calipers to measure each plastic spacer to make sure one wasn't damaged/wrong size, and they all checked out fine. So I disassembled the one that spins true for sure, and mounted the untrue tire/tube/pulley on it. 

'Lo and behold. the problem is the hub. The original hub, not the replacement, and not the one damaged by the bearing seizure.

By doing this I have confirmed the issue to not be pulley/tire/bearing. It 100% has to be one of the two hub halves. I am REALLY hoping it's the outer half, because if so I can just use the spare outer half from the other original hub that has the damaged inner bearing seat

:frowning:

That's not to say all the wheels came badly, to summarize the only actual issues I had with the kit are ; bearings needed to be replaced, one driven wheel hub not true, and the left front hub arrived assembled backwards (got two front rights, but was easy to reassemble correctly once figured out)

If I'd have replaced the bearings before even stepping on it the only REAL problem would be the untrue rear hub. So overall I'm still happy with the quality, provided I can find a way to true this hub. If it turns out it's the outer half I'll be stoked. And the mounts have been working great, Loctite is awesome

I've narrowed the problem down to this one half. I think this may be a weak part of this design, check out the small amount of material used for the bolts to hold the pulley on. I wonder if those small screw holes are absorbing all the force being given to the pulley when engaged, because you see a slight bend where along where the bolt sits

Ok new hub for the wobbly side on its on way :D 

I'm not ready to give up on these hubs yet dammit! lol 

Man this build is almost right where I originally planned it. The Photon remote got tracking info (not shipped just yet though), the neoprene is in place and shaved to match the board.

I think all that's left is stuff I thought of after the fact. Shortening the motor wires and adding new 5.5mm bullets so there's less to bunch up, replacing the cable sleeve with a narrower version and this time use a hot knife to cut it lol, and put the headlights on if my buddy gets around to finishing the bracket to mount them on top of the front baseplate.

Man there really is no end to tinkering on these lol. Every time I change something I see something else I want different. 

Currently updating the build thread, taking and uploading new photos. I changed the remote to the Firefly at the last minute. Had an issue while I was programming the focboxs and accidentally fried both CAN chips. So I removed the chips, removed the HM-10 from the slave vesc, and am currently running in split ppm on two masters.

Have ordered replacement chips and a rework station to upgrade from the butane setup I'd been using. When the chips arrive I'll throw them back on and move back to CAN connection so I can have my bluetooth functionality back.

Just received my 107mm Superflys today! Probably won't have time today but I definitely want to give them a run this weekend their so soft and bouncy!
