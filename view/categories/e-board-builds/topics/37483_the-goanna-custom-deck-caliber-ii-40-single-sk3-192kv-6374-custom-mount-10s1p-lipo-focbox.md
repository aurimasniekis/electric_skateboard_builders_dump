Hi everyone,
This is my first post and first build. I've been reading for a while now but have finally got a parts list together and was just looking for a few opinions before I shell out and buy parts. 
Also please note that I live in Australia so postage has affected my decisions but am still open to any suggestions.

Here's what I have so far (All prices are in AUD):
https://www.dropbox.com/s/z8f03g5mc4jy06q/Electric%20Skate.xlsx?dl=0

Is this controller any good/ worth the money? If not what should I get instead?

At this stage I'm planning to run my batteries in series to get a total of 37V and 5Ah.
From what I understand I will also need a BMS if I want to be able to charge my lipos without taking them out of the board each time - what one would you recommend?

What gearing would you go for with these specs?

Also, is there anything else major I am missing?

Thanks, Hamish

You could save some cash by going to caliber clones for trucks. You could opt for a GT2B remote instead of a nano-x and save $100 (and maybe doing a mod for it later).

You wont need a BMS if you put the balance wire plugs through the enclosure wall.

maybe its the exchange rate but prices seem crazy high there.
caliber2s are only $30 on amz us.
for remote the mini remote from ebay is < $20.

aside from that watch out for cheap quality drive kits on ebay..

Ahh yes, I might get one of them instead.
But I would still need one if I didn't want to charge each battery one at a time?

Yeah that's the thing about living in Australia :cry: 
Also all the one's for around $30 don't ship to Aus so by the time I've got a mail forwarding service I figure I might as well buy from a seller here and just pay the extra. 
With the drive kit I might end up either making my own gears and then just needing a belt or I might just spend the extra on postage and get brand name stuff. 
Has anyone had any bad experiences with these ebay ones or just stay away as a rule of thumb?

This is ALMOST the same build that I'm thinking of doing. I went with 2 of these to get my 10s1p:

[https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-battery-nano-tech-5000mah-5s-35-70c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-battery-nano-tech-5000mah-5s-35-70c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html)

I'll get another two in the future to get my range up.

Good luck with your build Hamish!

Thanks! Good luck to you as well.
I was looking at them but decided on mine just for easier balancing and slightly slightly smaller size

Do the rest of the parts look ok?

Yes it looks fine.  

But don't forget about the cost of wire, connectors, a switch or loop key, a device to charge your batteries, maybe a fuse, and tools to put it all together. These may be inexpensive, but unless you have them already they may delay your build.
