Planning on a first build, going with mostly pre-built parts.

This is what I have in mind.  Would this produce a dependable board I could use on a daily basis?  Climb hills?

Are there sources for parts that I may be missing?  Parts recommendations?

Also looked at psychotiller, and love the motor mount but would prefer to get it in a kit.
