HI guys, finally i decided to build my very first eboard, after 3 months of lurking into this awesome community. Yeah. i did my homework, so many things to learn. Parts are on the way, well most of them. Here is the list

-Board: Never Summer El Jefe (inspired by @scrant ) (on the way)
-Mechanical: TB single motor kit: trucks, wheels, motor mount, belt â€¦ (on the way)
-Electronic: 

    1. VESC from Enertion.(ordered)
    2. Enertion R-spec big boy 6372 190kv.(ordered)
    3. Space cell pro 4 (10s4p)(initially).
    4. Controller: Nyko kama(maybe upgrade later due to some reported dropouts)

The battery is a tricky part. Due to aviation regulation, they donâ€™t ship to where i live(Vietnam). So I am back to old school: DIY. I have 3 options and some questions in mind, PLEASE help me with this one.

    1. Li-on 12s4p Samsung 25R with BMS.
    2. Li-on 10s5p Samsung 25R with BMS.
    3. 2x6s 12000mah lipo to make 12s battery(or 2x5s makes 10s). Tear it down, make it slimmer.

Of course, the battery will have with a meter.
Questions:

1. With spec like that, should my board go with 10s or 12s? There are a lot of posts saying 12s is a bit too much for the VESC, that it will burn drv chip but there are also many boards use 12s with no problem ex: @longhairedboy , @lowGuido  â€¦

2. Can lipo battery use BMS? I ask this because I saw noone here doing it. 
How can i charge the battery? I mean with what voltage? According to what i learnt : if 10s then 42v 2a, if 12s then 50.4 2a (4a for fast charger) Is this correct? Are there any cheaper alternative? 

3. How can I choose amp(current) for BMS ?

All help and suggestion are appreciated. 
Pic will coming soon.

1. 190kv with 12S is probably too much. Go with 10S. @chaka can confirm ERPM calculations.

2. Yes you can use a bms with lipo. Charge with the voltage that your batteries will be when fully charged. 4.2x10=42v for 10s.

3. Charge at 1C for quickest charge. So if you have a 12ah battery, charge at 12amps for quickest charge. Not many 12amp chargers so you could do .25c 3amps and that would take about 4 hours.

Yup to my understanding you can do 12s on a 190kv motor cause you are just below 60k erpm as long as the cells are at 3.7 volts. However if the cells are 4.2 volts you will have above 60k which my damage the drv chip. I had a similar problem designing my board cause I was planning to go 12s with a 245 kv motor. This would for sure damage the current version of the vesc cause that is far past 60k erpm even if the cells are at 3.7 volts (44.4*245*7=76146). For now I am going with 9s even though it will still exceed 60 erpm if the cells are at 4.2 volts. I should technique be going 8s but I plan to by easy on the throttle when my batteries are fully charged and also I will set the max erpm on the vesc to 5500 erpm just to be safe. 

For you 10s would be safest which is a reason enertion uses 10s. Maybe @chaka would shed some light cause he's the man.

Check or this thread about choosing the right kv for the current versions of the vesc. Chaka explains a lot of this in it but the erpm should be a problem anymore when the v6 vesc comes out :slight_smile:

All my boards are running 12S4Ps samsung cells with BMSs with VESC and dual Enertion R-SPEC 190KV 6355s. They get warm but they fly. No problems with them so far, but i use Ollin VESCs so maybe that's why. I have yet to run a single 6372 onthat though. I suspect plenty of warmth there too. 

you can use a BMS with any cell pack that has balance leads. You just have to make sure the BMS is specced for the right cell count and cell voltage/chemistry. I would choose the BMSs current based on the continuous rating of the cell pack, not the burst rating. For example my sammy packs have a continuous rating of 80amps so i use 80amp or less BMSs so that the cells never get uncomfortable.

@torqueboards
The bearings are sticky when i hold between my fingers. Then i spin it, it doesnt spin freely at all. I mean it turns but then quickly stop.
Is this a problem? They are supposed  to spin freely right?

@onloop : one of ur employees said that the VESC would come with xt90 , the one i got came with xt60. Not a big deal, i can replace it with xt90, the thing is that i was live chatting with him on the  enertion website, he went to the vesc and took a look came back, confirmed that it was xt90. Maybe this is from the old batch ???

@onloop, @EnertionSupport, I got my VESC, trying  to configure, and I don't want to burn it b/c i know nothing ab VESC setup, there are lot of burn VESC due to wrong configs.. My question: Do you have some kind of GOOD and SAFE vesc configuration for R-spec 6372 motor that i can follow. I want to ride it for some time before doing my own tweak.

Can i use a laptop-like charger to for the motor detection with the vesc? I mean to use it to power the vesc for motor detection. 

The charger is 19v 4a

While waiting for bms and the battery itself, im gonna do the motor detection. After asking and reading around, finally have enough confidence to do it, but i ran to a post that the op has a quite serious incident while doing motor detection( broke his thumb nail) so i decide to make a motor stand

How I solder bullet connectors....

I clip a piece of solder and stick it inside the bullet connector enough so that I can insert the wire then hit it a tiny blow torch and let melt then hit the outside with my regular soldering iron ... The silicone sheathing get toasted around the wire a little but some shrink and it's perfect ðŸ˜‰

OP also keep in mind if you charge with the fastest charging it will make the lifespan of you getting the full charge less over time. If you charge at a lower speed it is basically trickle charging which preserves your battery life.

Today i did a test_run with Fiberglass, bc this is the first time i worked with fiberglass. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/4/547f37aad56f023f22d89573cec72e38cfe476ac.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Oh men, this is hard as hell. Take a lot of work.
I could not smooth out the conners, edges. Any advices for me on this ? @longhairedboy @whitepony 

Is this the right kind if fiberglass ?

It always creates some bubbles on top. I think this is bc the pattern of fiberglass.

yea, without vacuum its really hard to do a sharp edged enclosure. i tried once and failed too :confused:

you can use some wooden planks wrapped in cling film to press the fibers into the corners and make them stay there. basically some frame around your enclosure!

I had a good outcome using fiberglass matt first then using the weave after. I let the matt get really tacky before I layed the weave on top. I also routed the corners of the wood mold to be round so there wouldn't be any bubbles. There is too much tension on sharp corners when you fold it over otherwise without using a vacuum like whitepony said. His way with the frame will work good too if you try again. 

Pics for reference.

@whitepony @i2oadsweepei2

Thanks guys.  Appreciate it. I dont have a vaccum. So i will try to round up the edge and use the matt then weave.

I use alumium foil( idealy lead foil, but couldnt find one) to grap around the phase wires to stop partly the electric magnetic field created by he wires. This field would jam the receiver signal.
