# TB motor mounts pulley covers (3D print?)

Does anyone provide motor pulley covers for TB motor mounts? I see the mounts have holes pre-drilled to accept a cover but couldn't find anything on their site.  Would I need to design and get someone to 3D print some for me or are they already available?

The design isn't perfect, and will only work for up to 90mm wheels i think, but it do work. Shoulnt take many minutes if you have some experience with cad tho.
Ps; The design isn't mine.

Just promise me that you'll return with pictures if you print it :stuck_out_tongue:

By the way, the file doesn't have the Mk. 3 printing on the top.

You're right. I didn't notice but the cube I created was a bit inside the pulley which made it look shorter.

You'll see more of this if people start using Metroboard press in pulleys...  On torqueboard trucks.. with Torqueboard 6374s that have 40mm shafts...

@Apolo 

![1520904913643824894655|375x500](upload://k9zZzVGNKpGYFZcN6dz5FLKunl5.jpg)

Regardless if someone uses TB mounts and TB6374 on TB trucks. There will need to be a hole or clearance for the 40mm motor shaft (10mm is 10mm, 30mm is 8mm totalling 40mm from seat to shaft tip, motor mount is 8mm thick so 32 mm of shaft exposed)

First key is use a socket. Not an Allen ot twist handle

![1520907715003595881222|375x500](upload://47w4xhXFRxX9o6QZEGj1b97VoG6.jpg)

I push the mount flush against the truck in this direction to give no room to move as it's already as far back as it can go if I run into something

![1520907808375345635898|666x500](upload://tRhTVfS69Z4ZyqszNixPC4aK68u.jpg)

I tighten it into place. Then back one out at a time and apply loctite and torque it to final position.

They won't move if you use a socket. Handled hex drives, Allen's, and screw drivers with hex inserts just won't give enough leverage to create the torque for the set screw teeth to bite.

@ShutterShock I drilled a very shallow little hole just a hair under the diameter of the insert screw. When I torque the screw in, it'll drive it's chamfered end into the drilled hole and that shit will never move. Of course, loctite 243

Not really too sure, I just picked up a screw, sliced it with my pliers and it fit perfectly. 
But I have a strong feeling it's an M3x12mm.
12mm because the motor mount is 8mm, and my cover has 3mm thick walls.

When i messure my board (axle) it seems like you would need to have depth of at least 30mm to clear the axle?
Can anyone confirm before i send this for printing?

I run the same setup with 80mm kegels. I used the 80mm version. The axle runs very close to the top of the cover so I had to dremel out a small channel. 

If you're using 3D hubs, I'd go the safe route and use the Deckoz deluxe with the cutout for the axle

Fitted now! 
Thanks @Apolo 

Just to let you know the cover needs to be shorter to fit 90mm wheels.
I had to dremel away around 1-2mm in order to get it to clear the wheel.
