Hey guys! So I have been lurking these forums for a month now and have had a Meepo v2 with the tesla battery for 3 weeks. I absolutely love it but I already know I want more. I was prepared to drop 2k on a board but nothing I could find prebuilt can give me what I wanted, which is why I just went with a meepo for the time being. My goal now is to slowly piece together a true high speed cruiser with good range.
Here is the parts list I have whipped up so far. 
Deck: Hi5ber Jalapeno ---$300---
https://www.hi5ber.com/jalapeno
Battery: 12s4p samsung 30g w/ 4A charger and enclosure ---$545---
https:///products/electric-skateboard-battery-epower-pack-12s4p
Drivetrain: Torque D Drive 90kv ---$750---
https:///products/torqueboards-direct-drive-motor-kit?variant=12960752795671
ESC: FOXBOX Unity ---$250---
https://www.enertionboards.com/focbox-speed-controller/focbox-unity-dual-motor-foc-controller-esc/
Controller: Hoyt Puck ---$190---
https://hoyt-st.myshopify.com/products/speed-puck-remote-control-and-receiver
For a grand total of $2040!!! Ouch. Although I am prepared to spend that much I want to make sure I do it right the first time. 
I am looking to hit 40mph (although I really just want to be able to hit 35 with mild effort) and have a range of 20 miles give or take. Should that be possible with this setup? Any advice or criticism is welcomed. 
Thank you for you time, Patrick.

You'll have to learn trigger discipline to achieve 20miles on a charge, but you should be able to get at least 15 miles at 15wh/km ezpz

Looks like a great build, and  Imho the piece de resistance will be your deck.

Thank you! My only concern is getting the enclosure on a CF deck. I was planning on using a self tapping thread set with JB weld to hold it in but I am worried about drilling into CF. Not sure how it handles it compared to wood.

Hmm well my average while riding fast was 18-20 miles I could get 30 miles out of my TB 12s4p with trigger discipline with my dual 6374 build. But maybe the direct drive 1:1 ratio will affect range.

Btw @ApexMONSTER you got your self a real good build going on those are all quality parts you will not be disappointed.

I just did a quick range estimate, 432 wh- 40km /5x3 - 24 miles

That's assuming 10wh/km, and although I don't know what the impact of the dds are, I figure it's slightly higher ðŸ¤·

That's only if the deck and enclosure is CF if the enclosure is not CF then there should not be a problem. CF blocks radio signals.

Nice parts collection.  Going to be a great build.  I especially like the deck choice.  Only thing I would change is the remote.  If you are going all out with the spending then choose something a bit better than the nano x.  Its not a great choice at all.
https://forum./t/esk8-remotes-garbage-or-greatness/33

Have a read here for some different options lovingly compiled by our very own @mmaner
Personally I use the maytech and the benchwheel and both are infinitely better than the nano in any of its incarnations.  If you are used to the meepo remote then the benchwheel is probably the closest option and the cheapest.  Good luck with the build and keep us updated.

Thank you! What awesome feedback, I can already tell I'm gonna love this community! This is the kind of info I need. I know about the issues with CF and radio signal so the plastic enclosure should be fine. If needed I'll think about routing it out the side of the enclosure or something. The only thing I am really uncertain about is how you guys mount these enclosures on the deck. Self Tapping threads seems to be the go to method but on a CF deck is it just gonna crack and be brittle or will it drill like wood?

this is the way most of us do the mounting but with carbon/fibreglass I would be using some epoxy on the inserts.  Not much but enough to really get them solid.

I'm not sure about the TB DD but most motors will have a hall sensor cable that does not directly plug into the ESC so you may need an adaptor. Cheapest I've found was from Flipsky but took about a month to get here from china. TB sells them they are pricy but you can get them in days.

Why do people dislike the nano x? I've tried both, and love them equally (nano x used to get stuck, but seems to have fixed itself). I'm now using the APS remote because it's bigger (I have big hands), and my little brother has my nano x.

Edit: My ideal remote would be a slightly bigger nano x; the APS has too many buttons and switches for my liking :stuck_out_tongue: (also doesn't fit in your pocket)

[/quote]

Its very much a personal thing to be honest but if you have never used anything else then the nano would probably be ok.  I find the throttle throw too short and the curve too snatchy.  Once you try a better option then you won't turn back.  If the form factor of the nano is what you like then the benchwheel is so much better.  Much longer wheel travel and just smoother all round. 
As I said though, it really is what you get used to.  I feel like I harp on about this far too much but the remote in my opinion should be one of the most researched and tested items on anyones build list and no amount of money is too much for the security of knowing you have complete control.

Doubt you'll get plug and play joy unfortunately.  Just doesn't happen lol.  Phase wiring connectors will most likely be different between the unity and the drives but simple to sort out.  Cross that bridge when you come to it my friend.  Word of advice though, change the motor connectors not the unities to avoid any warranty issues with enertion or make some adaptors.
Plenty of threads on here that cover all that.  Happy reading.

Good to know. I do low voltage by trade so swapping connectors shouldn't be much of an issue. Thanks again for all the quick help guys! My tax return is gonna hit around the same time as my bday (late April) and I always get a little cash (30 years old and my family still spoils me) so I think ill start ordering goodies then. Want to hold off for any innovations that might come. I got my Meepo to get me around and it does the job brilliantly so I am in no rush to drop 2k but god damn I want that Jalapeno deck in my life already!

I've got 2 meepos.  Great cheap option for a pre built.  One of them is running twin focboxes and an arbor drop through deck.  My favourite shopping trolley.  The other is for noobs and the kids.  Can't beat them for value for money.  I will say though you will not believe the increase in torque and speed once you get that 12s set up.  @Battosaii and I have very similar builds due to me blatantly copying his first version before he went mental and chucked another set of motors on it.  Very fast is what you get with 12s regardless of the drive system.  Hope you're ready lol

I can't say for sure, but I would assume that the the DD have 5.5 bullets, where the unity only has 3.5 

Dexter has used 5.5s consistently for the last forever, I don't see why he would change it this time around ðŸ¤·ðŸ¤·

Fortunately, if you're no good at soldering like I am, it's relatively easy. Just heat up the 5.5, melt the solder into it, and press the 3.5 mm right into it. Test it to ensure the connection won't break when you give a decent tug on it, and it should be fine.

Nice build. 

I think both front and rear trucks are 50deg. _"Both front and rear truck as well as our 50 Degree Baseplate."_

If your going over 25mph I would dewedge the rear truck with an angled base plate. To prevent the risk of speed wobbles and stay safe. 

You can make or buy one, start at -5 deg and see how it goes. If you really want to go 40mph -10 deg might be better.

The signal will only be a real problem if the receiver is fully enclosed inside a carbon box, hence forming a Farraday-cage. My Vescs and receiver sit inside an Aluminium box (same problem usually) but I have added several holes (mostly towards the wooden deck to prevent this.

OK so I am buying all the connectors I need to connect the FOCBOX Unity to the Torque boards DD kit. I was wondering if making small jumpers with the necessary adapters would work instead of soldering it in so its not permanent and I don't risk voiding either warranties. I know I need 5.5mm female to 3.5 mm male I am just not sure if making a jumper will have a big effect on my resistance or power output or w/e you wanna call it lol. I am no electrical engineer.

A little update while I wait an eternity for the Direct Drive kit and the FOCBOX unity...
After receiving all my goodies and looking at how people made these adapters, im surprised no one has done them like this.

So instead of cutting that half off like the guy in my previous post did, I took a drill bit and wallowed out the 5.5mm side so the 3.5 slides right in with perfect tolerance. I then heated up the whole unit and pooled solder into the little hole until it was full. It looks much better than the ones I have seen done before.

She has practically no flex at all. I don't like flexy boards. I know they are more comfortable but to me you lose a ton of control. I skateboard so I am just used to a stiff deck.

completely independently I made some adapters for my TB DDs as well this morning. Mine didn't need drilling out though and the supplied 3.5mm male bullets just slid straight in. Like you used a mini clamp and heated the female 5.5mm bullet up with a solder iron, made a pool of solder and just slotted them together. 15 min job inc 2x layers of heatshrink :-)

Marked holes and taped edge off to apply weather stripping on the board. I decided to just use skate hardware and drill through the board because the battery is bigger than the case so no matter what I do it seems the case is gonna be doing some lifting... The carbon fiber drills really well. The bits grab really easily so be careful and make sure your aiming right. I ended up having to wallow out the case holes a bit to make it fit after i ran the hardware though the board. All the screw holes got countersunk a little bit so let the screws sit nearly flush in the board. I didn't want to go too crazy counter sinking them because I am always nervous about losing structural rigidity. But now it comes off easily and with any skate tool!!!

My custom light setup. 1 7/8" rubber lined P-clamps and two Sofirn SP 32A. I wrapped 2 layers of electrical tape around the ends of the 18650 Li-Ion cells to keep them from vibrating in the flashlight. They are crazy bright! 1800 lumens each on turbo and should stay lit for 4 hours on turbo mode. I don't know how reliable this will end up being because people have told me they don't last but how many of them thought of the tape idea? Who knows, only time will tell.

She looks good in her new home next to her older sister!

So now I am just waiting for the Unity (as are so many other people....) and she will be up and running!!! I am currently looking for some good protective gear. 
I don't really wear shit on the Exway but this thing is no joke. Probably gonna have to get the full face helm and some armor. Any suggestions would help immensely, just keep in mind I live in FL so I need the COOLEST, BREATHABLE armor. I wont wear the gear if I am miserable every time I go ride...

I needed adapters for the motor sensors. Once they come in I should be ready for final setup. 

My last concern is that the Bluetooth chip that came with my Hoyt St controller does not fit the Bluetooth port on the Unity but I might not need it.

What sensor adapter?  I'll need one too, as I'm doing a Zenith build with TB DDs and a Unity.  

Thanks!

Hey, how did you end up connecting the Hoyt puck to the Unity, also do you have to calibrate it every time?
