After seeing @onloop's latest video I have inspiration to start this build thread :wink:
 
This is going to be my second build after Helectric ( http://www.pimio.fi/helectric/ ). This time I start thread before finishing the build. 

Goal is to make a ***fast*** DH-board (UH-board?) for bendy forrest roads.

Components I have:
-VESC from Enertion
-VESC from @chaka
-CarvOn v2 dual hubz. Sexy black/orange combination 
-3D printed BadWolf v2 case and GT2B-mod

Enertio-VESC on the left and chaka-VESC on the right

CarvOn V2 waiting for the winter to end



Parts that I have to get:
-Deck: Custom made DH deck from baltic birch. Made in Finland
-Battery 10S? 12S? 18650? LiPo?

The biggest question mark is the battery. I really appreciate the convenience of pre made packs like SPACE cell and @torqueboards has a 12S pack with BMS, power switch and display. But im not sure how much my setups is going to draw from the battery and the torques pack is rated 30A constant. At 12S 30A should be enough for hub motors, right? Im not that heavy (68kg) but I really need the power to climb long hills.  

Any experience how much CarvOns draw from the battery at 12S or 10S?
And if I have dual VESCs do I have to configure both VESCs or just put them in canbus and configure the master one?

Cheers everyone!

Really dig those dual Carvons with the orange, just ordered some as well! I have a Carvon Single + Space Cell and getting good results with my optimized settings. This probably doesn't apply to a dual setup but happy to help if you need some stats.

Does it matter that the caps for each are different values (at least it looks like it since @chaka 's vesc has taller caps)?

Thanks mate! How much amps does your solo hub motor draw from your space cell on normal use? And is it easy to use the varavon birdycam lite when cruising with the board?

Good question, I guess I measure the amps in BLDC tool? Birdycam Lite is just right for cruising. I had the original Birdycam but it was a little too heavy. The Ronin M is a little too big for cruising as well.

No it doesn't matter if the caps have different values. They will both end up in parallel over the supply wires so their capacitance will be added up.

Looking a lot like my build, just started a similar thread, and not gaining much traction on figuring out a battery solution either, which is my biggest hurdle at the moment. Let me know what you end up figuring out. Do you know for sure that torque already has a 12s pack produced? I am looking for an all in one 12s solution ideally, so if that's the case I will buy that sucker straightaway and let you know how it goes as soon as I get my VESC's and my remote shipped!

And this is the state of the build now. I have couple of lunch boxes from IKEA (from the homeland of the VESC) as a project boxes before I figure out better enclosure system. 

I think I have to trim down the cables if I want to use FOC<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/10910435be776e0db49871c23872203264250f33.jpeg" width="374" height="500">

Thanks! 
What I understand is that the cables should not be longer than 20cm when using the FOC. Something to do with the inductance and/or too small capacitors

This isn't true. I can run FOC without any faults with much longer cables than 20cm. This is on version 4.12 with the extra capasitance on C18.  I saw @elkick post awhile ago and could not replicate the same issues he was experiencing.

Sweet board looking board, looks like it is going to be a lot of fun!

You are right, after the C18 mod (I implemented that at the first week of Feb) the fault was gone. Still, I think the quality of wires and caps (!) matters  when using long battery cables.

Went for the first ride. Started inside a ice hockey rink (minus the ice of course) in a case of a runaway. First tried the Nyko Kama but it felt unnatural (fell once because weird twitch!) and changed to GT2B with Badwolf. I think there is too much interferience and I ride goofy while holding the controller in the right hand, like @RunPlayBack. 

After switching to GT2B and fine tuning the settings, this setup feels like snowboarding in a concrete butter üòé 

And finally the Winter is turning to the Spring.

Congrats. How many amps can you pull from those batteries per motor?

It seems the space cells 15 amps per motor did not cut it for my dual carvons, and blew a vesc out on a 2+ mile long slight uphill. They really need as many amps as you can get them, which with the vesc, would be 50 per motor.

The speed is incredible. I was able to hit 30 mph constantly with plenty of room for more speed. Super smooth riding too. I am going to adventually do some research to see if its possible to sensor these motors. I think that wiuld make agood difference in acceleration.

Cool thanks for sharing. Here's my settings based on the Space Cell + Carvon Dual. Space Cell has optimized values like the Bat Max: 15.00 A for a total of 30.00 A across both VESC's. Your startup boost feels a little too high. I have mine set at 0.040 and always kick push. I might be wrong but I think setting it too high isn't healthy for the VESC, someone correct me if this isn't true. You should try FOC, especially if you ride it in crowded areas, super stealthy and quiet.

Motor Max: 70.00 A
Motor Min: -60.00 A
Bat Max: 15.00 A
Batt Min: -12.00 A
Absolute Max: 130.00 A

Min input voltage: 8.00 V
Max input voltage: 57.00 V
Battery cut off start: 35.20 V
Battery cut off end: 33.20 V

Startup Boost: 0.040
```

No problemo, thanks for tips!  I'll try with lower startup boost next, and cut the length of the cables and if that does not work I think I have to add the extra capacitor to the C18

https://youtu.be/zcSVMu4F998 

Did a distance test run with the Bouncer. I had already used the board for 3km before this so the starting voltage was 4.0V per cell. After 11.5km it was 3.8V per cell and when the soft cut-off started at 17.10km it was 3.24V per cell. I had set the cut-off at 3.3V but there was really steep hill at the end so I think that messes it up. I forgot to press continue on my watch when I continued after the 11km mark so the data is missing 1km.

So with 12S 6000mAh, dual Carvon V2 at fairly flat ground with 68kg rider I would say this setup can do 20km with one charge. Have to do next test with fully charged battery and with no breaks.

Thanks @broshi ! 

The acceleration is OK when starting from a stand still. It is slower than a mono 6374 geared setup but after it is going something like 15km/h it lights up the turbo booster rockets and and it just keeps accelerating to something like 70km/h. I have not tested how long it keeps accelerating because I dont want to die.

Friend of mine who is a speed junkie DH-boarder had a go on my board. And he still had throttle left on the remote, the bouncer deck is too flexy for higher speeds so lets see how fast it goes with stiffer deck :wink:  

@Tekninentuki the 70km/h mark is not too far!

Hi @STREETSURFER sorry for late reply, I have had serious voltage sag with the nanos for couple of times so I cannot fully recommend them.

Hey @Haimindo!

Really enjoyed your build and videos, please keep up the good work!

I have one question though: When you ordered the Carvons V2 way back, did you have to deal with import taxes and customs into the EU or are they shipping from a EU Warehouse like Enertion is? I am living in Europe myself (Germany) and while researching parts find it difficult to find out where stuff is shipped from. Taxes can be hefty when importing into Germany and I would love to avoid that.

Would really appreciate your input. 

Thanks!

Not even enertion has a european warehouse. They ship SOME things from a european distributor but most still comes from overseas and import duties have to be paid. So: you'll most probably have to pay.

Thanks mate! I paid shit ton (24%) of import taxes when I got my carvons, but thats the price you have to pay for premium product from states. Maybe in the future they will have warehouse in Europe too

Yeah, got it out neatly with the jaw puller. :slight_smile: I bought it from general car hardware store ( www.motonet.fi)  for 10‚Ç¨. The Carvons are really precision machined and everything is tightly together so the jaw puller was THE tool for the job :+1:

I found a similar jaw puller and it worked like magic. The problem now is that it doesn't really work the same way when you want to put the stator back in. Do you have another, bigger jaw puller?
