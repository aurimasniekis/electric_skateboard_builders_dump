(updated list)
Hello everyone, my bike recently broke down, and I need a new transport. I have always wanted to build a E board, but now the winter is over and the sun is on its way (and i have some money) i want to build one now. 

I already have a list over all my parts, but as anyone else, I would love too hear from you guys what you think about my selection of parts. 
If it was your build, would you change anything

Will you buy two of that Batteries and put them in series? If not, your skate will as fast as a normal skateboard, because 5s is a low voltage, 6s is the minimum and with that motor I think you would be wasting power...

Look, you bought a 6374 motor, 63mm diameter and 74mm length! Another thing, why are you buying a 150$ Vesc when you can buy one for less??

You'd still need alot of parts to finish your build.

1. Charger. (I'd recommend a high-powered one. Personally using a turnigy 300W) High power chargers basically mean you can charge your board much faster. I charge mine (0% to 80-90%) in about 30mins.
2. Deck (Think you missed out the most important part of your electric **SKATEBOARD**
3. Some sort of lipo alarm or battery indicator/ volt meter to tell battery voltage.
(VESCs do not check invidual voltages of batteries. If any cell drops below 2.9V while the rest are at 3.3V, your VESC will still continue functioning, further damaging your lipo cells.)
4. Some connectors. (you have to hook your battery up in series/parallel) and need to make it adaptable to your VESC's connection.) (Also, the motor you purchased comes with 4.0mm bullet connectors, i'm not sure what connectors your VESC comes with, but you MAY need to change this)
5. Some 12 or 14AWG wires (some wire extensions **may** be needed.)
6. ESC + Battery enclosure. (You need something to hold everything together. Most of the people here use Kydex enclosures. If you have access to a 3d printer, you can design and 3d print one out.)

Additional comments:
**2x Turnigy 4000mAh 5S 30C Lipo Pack. 41 Dollars (I was looking at the 5000mAh batteri, but its like 62 dollars, is it worth the money?**
It ultimately depends on the distance you want for your electric skateboard. It's basically a trade off between weight and distance.

**Im new to this and dont know if im just stupid, but i have a options between a 50 or 63 mm motor of the kit. what should i choose?**
You bought a 63mm diameter motor, so go with the 63mm motor bracket.

**All parts are 497 Dollars, I am really happy for my price, but I am willing to raise it with about 100 dollars, so if you know any part that would make my build better, or work :stuck_out_tongue: it would be great**
You'd soon realise that all the parts mentioned above adds up to your total cost of the skateboard. :D

Thank you soooo much for taking your time. I know there is a lot of small things I am missing, but I did not want to right a book, therefor are the only the main things (parts) I wanted help with.

I will now take the advise you came with and search some more, until I have a complete set.

I know there is no board, but I already got one, and I think it will do :-) 

English is not my main language, therefor I may have some trouble explaining exactly what I mean :-P

And again thanks, this is why I choose this site for help

Electric skateboard kit. 200 Dollars 

I used the same kit but instead I bought the $106 motor mount and pulley system then bought https://www.amazon.com/Orangatang-Kegel-Orange-Longboard-Wheels/dp/B01418H79I/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1491523001&sr=8-2&keywords=Kegel+wheels  hear for $55 and Redz https://www.amazon.com/Bones-Bearings-Spacers-Washers-Speed/dp/B01GBJC0CY/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1491523068&sr=8-7&keywords=Caliber+trucks For $14 and last caliber trucks which come in many colors for around $40 and you only end up spending a extra $15 dollars for more high quality and in my opinion better looking parts 

Also if I were you I would buy the gt2b it is a very reliable remote.
