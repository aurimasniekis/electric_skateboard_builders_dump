So I was about to make a build thread for my board when I realized **I don't even have a name picked out** :face_vomiting:

[Here is my board](https://www.mbs.com/boards/10101-mbs-colt-90-mountainboard-constellation)

Help me my creative brethren! Also open to new suggestions... but only good ones.

Were you even eligible at the time Venom? I know I wasn't at the cutoff date. I was still too nooby.
