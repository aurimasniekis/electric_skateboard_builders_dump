Whats the final weight for your board? 

Looks freakin sweet.. I wonder when someone is going to step up the game and start producing such boards in higher volumes (slim profile, gummie or 6.5in tires, lots of power) :)

I don't see the point in these configurations at all, it's like buying Northface gear and never going hiking or buying an SUV and never using it on dirt...or driving a Subaru and never doing donuts in the snow...there's some really really really high tech modern kick ass skateboards out there that have never been turned into an electric and you guys go and put slicks on a dirt bike already..why..it makes no sense...

That's sick ! Great build man. It does make a lot of sense to me. The point is diversity and trying new things, riding new models with different platforms, finding new feelings, exploring new things. If the world was lead by several de facto single standards that "would" makes 100% sense to few so called gurus... following straight lines, that would be really sad. Embrace diversity, mix setups and ride them hard - that's where my pleasure comes from. Either follow the so called guru lessons makers or define your own path. I'll always promote second option.

Have a blast on your board and ride it like there's no tomorrow.

Sometimes its more form than function.  This setup looks badass!  I have a Trampa deck/trucks that hopefully will one day look like this after I do my first build and save up more $$.  The boxes on top of the deck and the rear just look ugly but its for true Mountainboard riding and it has it's purpose.

I can go with that...but you won't catch me doing it, lol...to me function is sexy as hell..what I see there is a deck with more suspension travel than anything it will ever be used on...if you drop off a loading dock and do something sick with it, ok, maybe...but that's not how they are used..those trucks and deck are fish out of water to me, I cannot see anything stylish or sexy when it's glaring at me like that..

This is where I see that type of setup being sexy

@squishy654 , that's street/urban carver and not a MTB.
The urban environment is full of potholes, cracks, tram tracks, curbs, parks with hard pack surfaces etc. Usually the ares with Formula 1 grade tarmac are limited. This setup can take you anywhere, while regular longboards with PU wheels are limited in where they can go. You obviously haven't ridden one of those boards and judge the abilities by looking at the board. If you ever get the chance to ride one, take it!

You absolutely hit the nail on the head Frank. I have a trampa setup with pneumatic tires. All the streets, bike ways and sidewalks are bumpy, have potholes and generally crappy compared to places like Florida or California. I live in southern Ontario, Canada and winters ruin asphalt. I started with PU wheels and a rigid deck like the majority of people and my feet would be numb in 5 minutes. Now with the trampa, I can ride for a full hour before any fatigue. It's the perfect board for the places I ride.

I just think AT eskates are for offroading...and eskates with urethane are good for the street...they exist for certain purposes and when you use a design for a purpose other than what it's used for it should make some sense...I just don't get the point of these boards, other than a glamor shot or two..

what problem is being solved? What is it specializing in? What is the primary purpose or gap is it filling? Hence...it has no point...there's logic in my opinion. I don't think it comes from a evil place of just wanting to be mean, but if you wish to make it into that, feel free...have at it...

I'm talking about the configuration or pattern of putting street wheels on high end AT eskates. I also think pneumatic tires on any skateboards not shredding dirt is weird too, so what...lol

Dude it's not about the exact words you said. It's just that you came into this thread only to state what you dislike and what you feel is wrong about his board. I mean, yeah, everyone is allowed to have their opinion and stuff but it's not really contributing to anything. You're commenting on an already finished board for which Juvaknin sure had his reasons to build it that way. 
It comes down to "If you can't say something nice, don't say nothin' at all." We're here to help and motivate each other, not to only tell other people what we don't like about their creations.

Great you just found out that Urban carvers are not your thing, but only that. " not YOUR thing". May by its his thing ?!

I also don't get the crime of putting ketchup on pasta, but hey some like it.
I also don't quite get how people use "logic" as a word as the reasoning (?!) for an opinion :face_with_raised_eyebrow: That always confused the shit out of me since logic is an earnest attempt to distinguish good reasoning from bad reasoning. So by actual logic your Opinion/reasoning is individual in its scope and accuracy, meaning only applicable to you. And therefore bad reasoning since it is to no use to anyone except you ?

I have 10s6p dual drive Vanguard build and have recently just finished a Trampa build as well which was designed primarily for off road initially. I've found that I almost never use my Vanguard now. 

Sure, the Trampa is heavier and bulkier but I feel much more confident on it on the road and having 8" tires instead of urethane wheels just makes it so much nicer not having to worry about rough roads, riding up driveway curbs or over big cracks etc.

The Trampa certainly wouldn't make much sense if I was just doing short trips around town but my daily commute consists of a 7.5km ride each way on a mixture of footpaths and roads with fairly heavy traffic and I just find the Trampa a more comfortable and enjoyable experience in general.
