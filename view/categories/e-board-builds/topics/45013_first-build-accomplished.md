So here's my first build tell me what everyone thinks

Heres  the range & speed( I rode the board for about 3miles before I started using the app so maybe about 10miles total it'll last)

I tried uploading a video from recording on my phone but apparently won't let me unless it's on some sort of other format. 
I wanna thanks the website here it had a lot of information that I need. Also wanna thank to everyone that replied back to me. You people are awesome üëèüèΩ

You can't upload videos directly to the forum but you can post your videos on Youtube or other sites and then post a link here.

what specs are those lipo's? Nice build. Can you get over bumps without scraping the case?

9S1P 5000mah 25c 166wh. 5mah is tiny :joy: You have 21wh/mile efficiency which is relatively low. I have avg 15wh/mile cruising at 15mph. And I am 110lb. Wonder where the energy went. :thinking:

It was my first build, didn't know to much about batteries at the time(I'm still trying to figure it out) 
I should of went with something like (2) 5s 8000mah right ? Better range and even more faster ?

Can't tell from the pics, make sure receiver and vesc are secured and not rattling around

For speed use 2 x 6s in series for 12s. For VESC reliability, use 10s just like you said. wh(watt-hour) is ah(amp-hour) times voltage. Higher the wh, the more range.

```
9s?  You mean 12s? 6-10s is absolutely fine. 10s is optimal for VESC. 12s is where you should stop. I use 13s due to technical reasons and I occasionally get VESC shut-off's regen-breaking when battery is fully charged.

He's on 9s now
@MannyM0E  9s is completely fine, I used 9s for months cause that was the most I could fit, it's only a couple mph diff at the top end compared to 10s

You're missing the meaning of "pushing the limit"
You havent exceeded the limits of a 10s4p for instance, you're not exceeding anything by just having a 13s battery plugged in üòõ

10s4p 30q gets you almost 3kw...so..
![Screenshot_20180130-023930__01|690x350](upload://jQBD6byGucjgZIv8awsZwqgmp7P.jpg)
8s4p gets you 2.3kw
![Screenshot_20180130-024004__01|690x283](upload://rzo6Ab9e1W381AJki5EkW8tb7QO.jpg)

Like I said youre not exceeding the limits of lower voltages...so how does going higher make sense

@ZackoryCramer I'm all for pursuing and exceeding limits(safely) but does getting a Ferrari to go faster than a Honda Civic when you've only gone 20mph in the Honda make sense?

## \#20 Posted by: pennyboard Posted at: 2018-01-30T08:19:58.552Z Reads: 129

```
What motor are you using? Also, I think the limit of your power comes from having only 2 in parallel, the battery can only deliver about 40 Amps in that config. If you want 2+ kw, the safer thing to do would be to run 12s4p or even 12s6p and it'll get you there.

Yes, that's why I said I am planning on using 13s4p, an upgrade from 13s2p. I am using a TB 6374 190kv geared at 20/36.

## \#22 Posted by: pennyboard Posted at: 2018-01-30T08:30:13.835Z Reads: 116

```
Why do you have it geared so high? That's set to a top speed of like 45 mph. Have you ever hit that?

I don't think a 6374 really has enough power on its own to hit 45 mph in a reasonable scenario.

And yeah wack gearing, that's why you're not maxing out wattage

```
My max wattage with 2p is 1.6kw. I wanted to reach more than 2kw(pushing the 2p limit) which could be done with 4p. And why would a high gearing not max out wattage. Ive never gone more than 30mph.

## \#25 Posted by: scepterr Posted at: 2018-01-30T08:42:05.623Z Reads: 117

Exactly, youre geared for speed but not using it, thus not maxing wattage

Fast acceleration= higher wattage
You can achieve high speed using low wattage

Faster speed by physics mean higher wattage. P=F*V^2 When you said you can achieve high speed with ‚Äúlow wattage‚Äù, what is that relative to? Couldn‚Äôt be that of the lower speeds. üöÖüöÇ

Seriously though, power is (f x d)/t, so in this case that's œÑŒ∏/t, so if you have really small torque your wattage can still be really low on a high speed system if you accelerate slowly

## \#35 Posted by: pennyboard Posted at: 2018-01-30T19:13:42.113Z Reads: 84

Okay, there's 2 things you need to consider. First is the power output to the motor. Second is the power output at the wheels. Power through the motor is determined strictly through wattage. I'm assuming by you saying that you want more "power" in your board, you want faster acceleration and better hill climbing. This is dependent on torque, this is the rotational force to get your wheels moving. More torque is better acceleration and hill climbing. 

By having it geared so high, you are sacrificing torque for high top speed, but if you aren't riding anywhere near that top speed, (and I don't think its even possible to hit 45 mph with 1 6374), then you're basically not using the only reason someone would have to put a larger pulley on the motor. Basically you're not using the power the motor is putting out to its full extent. 

Try swapping the 20T motor pulley for a 13T or 15T (depending on top speed preferences), and see what happens. I guarantee it'll feel like a completely different board.

if you can‚Äôt get traction then sounds to me like you already have too much power

you‚Äôre definitely doing it wrong... @wafflejock is only like 115lbs and has never complained about traction issues

Umm not much of a video but here's a short clip.
Was actually omw home from work which was my goal for this board. When I got home I still had 57% left üòÅ My job is about 5miles away from my house

Also spray some that plastic dip on my closer

Here's a video. My motor only does this only on a complete stop. If I were to kick and push it'll clog for a bit then the motor will kick in. About to try and see if it's my sensore wire since I'm running sensors/hybrid. Let me know what everyone thinks

Did you find out about yet what caused this?

I‚Äôd try moving the trim button on your remote to almost neutral, checking the receiver position for interference with motor phase wires, and a reset of the vesc settings.
