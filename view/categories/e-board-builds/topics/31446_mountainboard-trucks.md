sesrch ebay.. ive got a few (3) complete boards/decks for about 40-45 eur a piece, if not even cheaper, search for some boards in your region, ebay has useful 'watch' function which sends new listings to your email.

Otherwise you need to buy them seperate and probably the most decent / quality ones would be from trampa
