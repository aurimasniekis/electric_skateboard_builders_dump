Hello, I've been working on a new Trampa Mountainboard project, but now I am stuck at a point where I don't know where to get good enclosures. 
My enclosure of choice would be this one https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/trampa-hs11-holypro-35-for-20700-21700-cells/ but with shipping, at $183 with shipping to France, it's damn expensive.
Does anyone in the EU makes enclosures like this for sanyo cells?

just top mount maybe.
 
yes it looks not that good, but it´s super practical.

Andy ☝️☝️ is right, from what I’ve learned for an eMTB you will want it top mounted. I thought it wouldn’t be bad but I’ve got quite a few scratches in the bottom of my deck already (300ish miles) but am super happy the battery is up top without a mark on it!
