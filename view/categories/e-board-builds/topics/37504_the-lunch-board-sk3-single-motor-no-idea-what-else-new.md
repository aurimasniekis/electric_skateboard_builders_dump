Hello all! 

So, I'm quite aware people are most likely tired of answering questions, but here me out. I've tried to read a lot of the guides here and "Best motors" threads and so on. 

So, I am thinking of building a Board, but sorta have no idea where to start. I have done some research though. (Not much apparently if I keep getting stuck but ignore that part XD ) SK3's 190 KV's seem to be in a good range for me price+ torque due to a giant hill out here in the US ofA in which I live. So, I have my motor down, and Ive been thinking of some ZIPPY Compact 5000mAh 3S 25C Lipo Packs in parallel for a 6s set up. But besides that I don't really know what to get. I have seen the list of commonly used parts  In the other thread but cant seem to find any of them for some reason. 

( NOTE I will once I have everything figured out parts wise, Ill try and regularly update this thread, Would just like some advice from an amazing community! and wont try and gunk up the forums with multiple threads by keeping it on here, hence the 

My experience: I have never really done anything of this scale ( Or lack thereof) I have been in FRC competitions so I can learn and am very willing to learn. But I have really no idea where to start. 

To consider: I have read the False economy post here, and Im quite aware of what can happen in case i buy crappy parts. But, Im trying to get the cheapest quality board possible. I have access to a 3d printer but really no experience in it. I plan to use it to try and print out a enclosure and use some weather stripping to make it water proof. 

Specifications + Ideals: Slightly water proof. 25 MPH TOP SPEED. 5-6 Miles of range ( I mean if I can get more ill take it but Ill most likely be riding in about that per day ) Under 500$ I weigh 185 Pounds ( 83 KG ) Fit in my locker. 

Under 500 Dollars: I Know thats the kicker, if I had 1000$ dollars, this would easy from my understanding. I like the VESC Idea, but from what I see its 150$ US which is a bit out of my price range assuming I can get an ESC for 60$ which will still allow the board to go. 

Ill be updating this post in a bit, but I must go because Ive actually been typing this out in class. ( High school senior) 

Best Regards 

Arthur

Please ask questions, I might not be able to get to them within the hour, but they should be responded to by the end of the day.

For the record, I have seen Low Guides, was just wondering if there have been any revelations or changes in hardware.

First off, two 3s batteries in parallel will not give you a 6s battery. Two 3s batteries in series will.

Secondly, 190kv at 6s is pretty slow, use 245kv or higher if you want to go 25mph. You can use the Esk8 calculator (just Google it) to calculate your topspeed

Third, the VESC is not $160. The ollinboards VESC might be but you can get a lower quality or cheaper VESC too. Even focboxes (enertion's upgraded VESC that run FOC really well) regularly can be had for under $130. If you're really Penny-pinching, you can buy a torqueboards VESC for $100 or a maytech VESC for $100, or you can email maytech and get one for $70 (I've never done this so I don't in now the specifics but I know you can do it pretty reliably). The VESC is super worth it.

$500 is unlikely to work out, but if you're committed to hitting that price point, grab the hobbyking motormount to go with your motor. You can the rest of your drivetrain off eBay (I can put links to specific kits here in a bit but I'm also in class right now(HS junior)) and that'll leave you enough money for some trucks and wheels. The other "cheap" option is to go full ebay for the drivetrain, but the motor mounts on eBay generally only fit 50mm motors which limits your options

Getting something that fits in your locker, if it's anything like mine, will be extremely difficult and you'll essentially be limited to a penny board. You don't want to be going 25mph on a penny board.

Not to sure how to tag, but thanks guys! Especially faithfulpuppy! And yeah I figured the 500$ would be hard but I actually have caught news of a interview so fingers crossed for that! 

As for the parrelel thing puppy, your 100% correct sorry about that. And thanks for the tips on where to find the Vesc and sorts! 

( as a senior we have double stack lockers so i think I should be good as long as it's the size of a boosted board. )

Lastly, is the 6s a good call? Or would a 10s be better (ignore money for a second)

Tag by typing "@" then the username of the person you want to tag

Good shit on the double lockers, that should totally fit just about anything. 6s will definitely be cheaper to start, and AFAIK there isn't a huge performance difference between 12s and 6s on lipos because current isn't as much of a limiting factor. I'm not sure though so maybe someone else can answer that better.

So update everyone, I'm working Now! Which in turn lends itself to many things like more money! I'm still looking for a board fairly cheaply, but I am looking more for price to performance. Rather than anything.

Thats My Link to the current build and I would love feedback! I know some stuff is missing but I would love some suggestions on stuff!
