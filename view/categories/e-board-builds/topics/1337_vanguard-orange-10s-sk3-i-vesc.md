Hello all! Greetings from Finland! 

In this winter I have been building myself a longboard. I have learned so much about electric longboards while reading this awesome forum. The board is not ready yet. I have to build the battery and do the wiring.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/899da8e8c9f1f1eaab5a3408403130599c9b25f6.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Here is link to the pictures: http://imgur.com/a/raxga

I started this project few months ago. I started gathering parts slowly peace by peace. There was a lot of thinking where I should buy each part because there is not really enough suppliers in Europe.
-Motor, wiring and connectors from hobbyking.
-Motor mount from aliendrivesystems
-Vesc from Elkick, Recommended if you live in Europe! (I added heatshink to protect it)
-Nunchuck

I made the enclosures by using my diy vacuum box. I used 3mm thick ABS. It worked really well. After molding I got rid off the excess plastic.

I attached the enclosures by using wood inserts. They seem like holding pretty well.

I have lipo charger capable of 6s charging. Using BMS will take too much space and I'm going to balance my pack by using balancing charger. I have to make two holes for the balancing ports. I build the two batteries by using diagram in the pictures. So it is 5s2p x2 connected in series. Battery is almost ready. Only thing what it is missing is heat shrink. 

About the wires which goes to battery to the Vesc I am using 10 AWG wire where in the battery end is XT60 series connector and in the other end XT90 anti-spark connector. Using this method allows me to charge the board without making extra holes for charging port and I don't have to worry any sparks when I connect power to the board.

I will update this project when I make any kind of progress :smile:

And good news to all diy builders from Europe! I noticed that there is not much sellers who sell motor pulleys or those who sell are setting the price pretty high!  In month or so I can provide aluminium 13t, 14t, 15t HTD5M pulleys to you with 9mm belt width. The price will be 20€ per set including all three sizes or 10€ per pulley plus 6€ shipping to Europe. I will notice you when I get these pulleys!

I bought them from ebay: http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/M6-M8-E-Nut-Wood-Insert-Interface-Screws-Hexagonal-Socket-Nut-Fixing-Furniture-/190954008273?var=&hash=item2c75beeed1:m:mgasbZRPWPLzeazfk_S4fqw

Inside the insert is hole for M6 bolt

The Vanguard is only about 10mm thick and 10mm were shortest inserts that I could found. So they are not completely screwed in to the board but they hold enclosures firmly.

Thanks! First I thought that I use lipos but there is few problems with them:
-Wires. There is a lot of them if you are using for example 4x 3s lipos.
-If you are using only two lipos for example 2x 5s they are too thick.
-Also some lipos tend to swell 

I went with 18650 cells because I can build a pack with the size I want. They are safer and wiring is not such a hassle. Plus they are only 18mm thick!

Your kydex enclosures are awesome !

What thickness Kydex did you use ?

And the little Lip where the bolts go in serves a special purpose?
```

## \#12 Posted by: Dunkirk Posted at: 2016-02-14T08:25:02.982Z Reads: 710

Actually it is ABS not kydex. It is 3mm thick and I think it is just good because the enclosures needed to be bended to match the shape of concave.

The lip is there because the length of wood inserts are 10mm and the Vanguad is 10mm thick. I didn't want to screw them through the board.

Really nice build! I'm interested in setting up the same battery on my build and was wondering how it is all wired. Specifically where do you connect the balancing leads to the batteries and why are there 6 balancing leads for 5 pairs of batteries on each row? Is one just connected to the ground wire? Any pics before you wrapped it? And lastly what kind of real world speed/distance are you getting?

Thank you! Here is the picture of wiring<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c362a68be033dc4556222869a1f856f3d65f1695.png" width="487" height="211">

There is 6 wires in JST connector because 5 of the leads balance the cells and one negative (the red wire)

Sorry, I forgot to take any pictures during assembly, but I hope that the picture helps! 

I have tested the board in parking garage and with gearing ratio of 14/36 I think it will max 40kmh. I will post real results when I am able to ride outside. Battery is 185Wh so theoretically the range will be 18,5km with one charge.

@Haick @JLabs   There is two separate batteries (5s2p). As you see in the pictures there is two black xt60 connectors. I plug the batteries in series when I'm riding and when charging I connect them in parallel :smiley:
I would charge 40€ per enclosure.
If you want to save some money I can sell enclosures 25€ per peace uncut, so you get rid off the excess plastic.


@xalitust Sorry I forgot to take any pics during the assembly. It is possible to do that with soldering iron but there is a huge risk that you harm your sells, so I do not recommend doing so. I bet that in your city is some kind of battery store that can do welding for you.

There are 20 cells total, but he's grouping every 2 cells together in parallel, so it's a 10s battery after hooking each separate battery in series (5s2p + 5s2p = 10s2p).

I managed to travel 14km with full charge to 34V. In my opinion it is pretty good range with me weighing 95kg. 

Only problem with this pack is that the voltage sag is so big. So I can't limit the battery cut off. I have to monitor the battery voltage manually. I'm now building two 5s3p pack to deal with this problem. It is going to have same specs than original Space cell.

Hey Dunkirk,

I think you did a really nice job on choosing the components of your e-skateboard. Vengaurd deck, kegel weels, 10s and vesc also will be the parts of my choice. However I want to stick to a dual rear drive chain. Right now I am searching for a motor that will fit between the wheels. Since your use the 184mm calibers and the kegels wheels I have a question about the measurements of your board.
What is the distance between both back wheels, if you loosen the nuts to a maximum? Technically you could just fill up the space between the inner bearing and the hanger with washers or sth. similar. 
Depending on your answers I will choose the motors. They will have a length of probabably 45mm- 55 mm. Also I want to use at least a 12mm wide HTD 5M belt for tourque transmission, instead of a 9mm one due to a higher durability.

Greetings from Germany

Thanks! 
If you are going to use dual rear there is no need to use 12mm belts. Two 9mm belts will give you more than enough grip.
 There is 5mm free space in the both ends of Calibers so if you want to do some adjustments I suggest that you go with wider trucks. However calibers will hold two 6355 motors with 9mm belt.

No they are not Sanyo cells. They are LG HE2 20A cells. Now when using those two 5s3p batteries there is no more voltage sag. I have limited battery max to 30A so I am only pulling 10A per cell. I also made a new enclosure for them:

So back home i will made the custom board, i allready have the trucks from the days when i was skating , the only thing what i'm gonna buy is pulley and motor controller from Enertion 

I dont know what is better, one motor : Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-192kv Brushless Outrunner Motor,
or should i take two motors? i dont know how the motors react on my weight :D i have arround 100KG

i was always using the 18650 batteries by panasonic for my portable speaker and gopro gimbal like this:
http://www.amazon.com/NCR18650B-Rechargeable-Li-ion-Battery-Panasonic/dp/B00C26OWGS?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00

and i they are working pretty good ,or do you recommend those LG-s from your project?

In one project i have found that guy was using controller and receiver from nintendo wii.
Which controller and receiver do you using ???

And the final question about battery setup.
I want to have board thin as possible so the 18650 battery solution is good but do you have any updates for that so i can build battery pack with only one row?

tnx
```

@Haimindo Yes that would be nice! I'll contact you if I am coming to Helsinki :sunglasses:

@joniee I weight 95kg and there is no problem with 6374 size motor. It got plenty of power. There is no need for two motors. 

Those panasonic batteries have too low discharge rate. You should go with higher discharge batteries for example those LGs.

There were severe problems with wii controller so I switched to gt2b. I recommend any 2.4Ghz system

With 18650 cells you can build any shape of battery. No problem with only one row.

At 10s with 15/36t pulley, 83mm wheels and without factoring the motor/setup efficency is 40km/h, I've seen you're considering this motor and your desired spee is 30km/h so at 6s without bigger wheels/different pulleys it will not reach 30kmh. I suggest you to put your data in the [calculator](http://toddy616.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/electric-skateboard-calculator.html) and check  :)

Hmm, at 8s it will theoretically reach 32km/h.. Should I just convince my self to go 10s and a 168kv, instead of 8s 245kv? What do you think? :)

## \#54 Posted by: makevoid Posted at: 2016-05-17T15:05:21.513Z Reads: 527

```
it depends really if you plan to can or plan to get bigger wheels, different gears, higher voltage setup in the future with the lower kv motor or the contrary with the other motor, also consider that you can always limit the max speed (rpm) if you use a configurable ESC like the VESC but you can never increase the torque via settings, only by changing gearing or/and by putting smaller wheels, but if you are not a heavy rider it shouldn't be a problem. Also higher voltage should help with the overall system efficiency so maybe you can try with lower kv but 10s? maybe wait for other suggestions

Okay. There is approximately 6-7km/h difference between 8s 245kv and 10s 168kv. I'm not a heavy rider, really not sure if I'll wait on HK to restock the 245.... it takes so long

If I bought the deck and an enertion motor, wheels and trucks kit, What battery, esc or vesc, controller and charger would I need and all the wiring and connectors and stuff???

Sounds good! 

Yes you need some connectors like xt90s and xt60. Any kind of connectors will work but they have to handle the current that you are running through them.

Then the wiring. 10-12AWG wire will be best. 
I use standard 6s [charger](http://yellowrcshop.nl/Hype-X-Treme-Charger-Dual-Power-80W-X7-Plus.html).

I recommend going with two lipos, 5s or 6s. Capacity is up to you depending range you want. 
Any controller which uses 2.4GHz frequency will work. I have found that wii controller is not reliable and when reading threads where people fall of their boards often the reason is unreliable controller, like wii nunchuck.

Also you need heat shrink and good soldering iron.

HTH!

For example the charger that I use is only capable of charging 6A. If you go with two 5Ah 5s lipos you can charge them safely at 10A when charging them in parallel. 

But there is no harm done at charging batteries at lower current.

Little update to my charging system. I'm still charging my batteries in parallel and discharging them in series. I use little loop key to hook by batteries in series. When charging I take the key off and connect charger to that connector. Another charging connector goes to the main power cable.

Heloo @Dunkirk, first of all, awesome build, I carefully read all the thread and learnt every detail, I was just wondering about the weight of your board, how much is it in total?

I see that having 30 LG HE2 batteries gives you 277.5Wh for 1,44kg (at 48g per cell), pretty good right?

I'm thinking of building maybe a 6s4p, that'd give me a max discharge rate of 80A right? And how do I determine what my motor will draw?

Thanks, see you!!
```

---
## \#81 Posted by: Dunkirk Posted at: 2016-08-07T11:25:13.211Z Reads: 399

Thanks!

80A sounds decent at 6s configuration. It really depends what sort of esc and motor you are using. It would be good if you could limit the amp draw from the battery for example using esc that has that limiting capability. 

Your motor will draw different amps in different situations. When cruising at flats the basic esk8 motors will draw under 10A. I bet that the max amps (50A-70A) you will be drawing when going hills or accelerate hard. 

You can always go higher voltage to lower your amps!

10A, that's low haha, I have the mamba monster 2 and the sk3 245kv. The mamba says it can continually draw up to 120A, so I don't know, that's probably way too much.

Btw, how's that beauty going? Do you use it all the time?

Max amp draw of mamba is 120A. There is not a such thing as too much amp rating for ESC. 

Your board will performance good with 6s4p battery Mamba 2 and 245kv motor :slight_smile:

Why did you go to 192kv? Was 168kv not cutting it? 

Can you compare the two please? I am trying to decide between the two.
```

---
## \#85 Posted by: Dunkirk Posted at: 2016-08-15T04:45:03.512Z Reads: 384

Well there is two reasons why I upgraded to 192kv motor. First I wanted more speed, it is not much but something. (Of cource I could done that with gearing) There is really not a noticeable difference in torque between those two.

The main reason why changed the motor is because I am building a 12s board and 168kv would be more suitable with it.

So I would say go with the 192kv if you are running max 10s, and above that go with 168kv.

The idea is that you connect the batteries (2 times 5S2P) in parallel when charging (so a 5S4P pack) and then connect them in series (10S2P) when discharging, this way they balance each other before charging (this is called parallel charging if you want to look more into this) and you can charge with a 5S charger.

Hi man i come back with another question.

1.How important is your battery upgrade to 5s3p ?? and what is rlly the difference between that and  5s2p ( except the extra capacity) if you can explain this would be awesome.

2.Also could you give some updates on what remote control are you using ? or what would be nice to have? i read a lot of post where pll say they lost connection and stuff like that.. I will use a vesc from electricboards.com and im still not sure what will be the best remote.

3.And what type of transmission belt should i use.. i saw the rubber ones break from time to time.. is there a better alternative ??

Thank you for your help

.1 More cells you put in parallel less stress is put on a single cell. 2P configuration wasn't enough to give me     the range what I needed. The pack was draining fast.

.2 I am using GT2B with Badwolf mod. Any quality 2.4GHz transmitter works fine.

.3 If you are running dual motors 9mm belt is enough. Single I would go for 12-15mm. The quality belts will last. I am still using my first 15mm belt and I have been using it for two months now. And still no sign of wearing.

What? I get the feeling you have no idea what the image shows. What you are describing is standard charging in a series configuration (connect in series, then take bat1 ground and bat2 pos to the charger). This can be done when you have a suitable charger.
The image shows how you can charge two batteries in parallel that are usually connected in series.
This is necessary when your charger is only 6S and you want to ride 12S (2x6S in series) for example.
Clear now?

Hello, im having some problems with the battery. I.m not sure if 10s3p will give enough Amps for the motor. Can you give me some feedback how is for you ? i mean ill use the 190kv motor from enertion and im not sure how many Amps will use. 

Im thinking to use same 18650 batteries 10s3p ->60A but again will this be enough for the motor ? i dont want to force the mottor or batteries or burn something.

The motors are similar so i dont think is a problem if i compare them. I would like to know about what distance you can use it with this setup. 

Thank you.

10s3p is enough but it is not a bad idea to add one p more if you have room to do that. I suggest that you use LG's HE4 cells. They are almost the same as HE2 but they do not sag as much:) 

But answer to your question: You will be good with 10s3p pack and Enertion motor. Actually the original space cell used HE2 cells in 10s3p confiquration. 

I am getting about +-15km of range with 3p pack. But no problem to empty the battery in 10km, but that really needs an effort :grin:

Yes I know, waiting is killing :older_woman:
 
HE4 cells cost about 40e per extra p, so it is really not that much. Do not solder your battery, cells take damage from heat. I suggest that you go to you local battery store and they will weld the battery for you. Price is somewhere in the range of 10-20euros. 

There is so many options to charge your battery. Look different build threads and deside what serves your preferences :slight_smile:

What thickness plastic do you use for the enclosures, and what is your heating element for vacuum forming them? Wooden molds right? What range are you getting with your 10s3p?

Thanks!

@overint Go ahead, you will get a great board! 

@markyoe I am using 2mm ABS. It is strong enough but the key is not to attach anything directly to the enclosure. Everything inside the enclosures are attached to the board. I am getting about 25km range. And yes, i am using wooden molds and oven

Hey (if you would) how much would you charge for your old battery pack? Even if you're not going to sell it how much did it cost to make?

That is for posting about your build! I am making two 6s4p so I can use my hobby charger with similar charging to yours. It was a HUGE help!
