Here's my take on it... Roughly based on Frank's take on it ;)

Messy beginnings.

Baercoil inserts are designed to use in rethreading damaged internal threads in metal structures, by first enlarging the hole, than threading it with a threading tool, and then inserting the coil into the freshly threaded enlarged hole to make it the same size as it was before with the appropriately sized coil. If inserted into a not previously threaded hole, and just a drilled one, the spaces between coil's internal thread's leads have smaller spacing than the leads on the external thread of a screw of corresponding size and as in the case of having it inserted into a hole drilled in carbon, you end up pulling the coil upwards every time you try to screw in a screw. Even when epoxied from the receiving end of the coil.

Since the board's gonna hopefully be a long-term companion of mine I decided to install and de-install the enclosure ten times and see how the coils perform... well, the didn't.

If longevity is what you're after, make sure to use solid steel inserts.

My deck is 15ply as well and my inserts were 10mm M4 too, so those of yours there should be just right. The diameter of my insets minus the thread was 6mm, and to screw them in without problems I had to drill 7mm holes (did try 6mm holes at first but the carbon proved to be to hard a material for the insert's thread to penetrate without breaking the insert's hexagonal recess for the allen key - that's even more true for a split thread like yours).

Why didn't you thread the hole in the Deck with the Baercoil thread cutter? This works just fine. I use a bit of Epoxi and screw in the coil. The Baercoild cutter cuts a special thread, slightly different to M6.

To be absolutely honest it never occurred to me to thread a hole in anything else than solid metal. Still, knowing how many times I'll prbbly be taking off and reinstalling the enclosure back on and knowing the carbon's pliability - especially after my recent experience with it - I would never be able to completely trust a product claimed by its very producer to be made especially for use with metal. These wood insert I've tried, on the other hand, seem to work perfectly - especially since carbon is in this regard much more like wood, rather than like metal.

We thread our board and even use M screws without inserts. It's not carbon! Our decks are made from a completely different material that we weave and mould ourselves. Carbon would be way to stiff.
The Bearcoil inserts work a treat if you thread the deck.

You could, but you can't use Loctite! You could also use screws meant to be screwed into plastic.
I use the Bearcoil / Recoil inserts for perfection. When you ride an urban carve, vibrations do not occur, so that is a big bonus.

Oh, well... too late now anyways ;P I've got few more holes left to do though, so I'll give a try going insertless and keep you guys posted on how it turned out. Still, I'm quite sceptical as to how it'd hold up against multiple screw removal and an extended period of time. We'll see.

Hey, guys! I'd love your expertise here! I've put the charging port and a voltmeter on the top of the deck and I'd also love to do the same with my spark plug. But this'll extend one of the wires between the battery and the motor controllers significantly. And here's where a crucial questions sorta naturally arises: Can one of the wires be made this long? Or will this cause... unforeseen consequences? ;)

Just make sure to use wire being thick enough. AWG 12 to AWG 10. Usually it's best to keep everything as short as possible. Maybe you find a better solution for the loop key position.

@longhairedboy So as I gather and to make it absolutely clear the potential inter-battery-vesc wire length difference issue should be of no concern, right?

Since we sell our bullet proof decks, not a single customer managed to brake one. 16 years without any deck failing!
No chance that a tiny cutout will affect the decks performance.

you should try to keep them the same length but unless you're running FOC, no it really doesn't matter.

i hear that the length of battery to ESC cables makes a difference, as does the length of phase leads to the motor. I forget the length requirements but it has to do with timing. It makes sense if you think about it. By the time the motor reaches its position and the ESC is able to detect that position and then do something based on that information, the motor may have already moved out of the position that the ESC calculated for and then do something based on bad information.

It sure did take me a while since the last update - it's cuz I've had a little version of me made up of half of my DNA in the meantime, u see.

And so finally here's the continuation of me making this mindbogglingly time-consuming - and hopefully eventually equally as awesome - piece of an electric skateboard.

I've made an ignition socket :stuck_out_tongue: I've epoxied it into a piece of aluminium and also sealed the small opening right in the middle of it to prevent water ingress.

And here's how I've mounted the Enertion's VESCs and the BMS to the tufnol spine thing. The BMS is on two 2mm layers of neoprene, and screwed onto the tufnol with some rubber washers to remove vibration. I'll stick into a heat-shrink sleeve later.

I've also made a spot-welder with a microwave transformer but it turned out to burn holes in the test cells I was trying it out on, and I neither have the time nor patience to make an arduino time switch that would limit the current flow to 500 milliseconds, and so just today I've finally sent my 18650s to some pro Polish electric bike builder to weld them cells for me.

Stuck some neoprene strips as cushioning for the batteries.

Excellent work!  I am making the same enclosure.  I had made a severe boo-boo using a circular saw trying to cut the slits on in the enclosure.  Don't know how I am going to fix that.  Dremel with diamond cutting wheel seems to have the best cutting power against the enclosure which is some carbon fiber enforced plastic.  It is tricky to work with, I don't like saws and high-speed cutting causes chunks to fly.

EDIT: I did find most of the parts on Amazon (phenolic sheet = tufnol), l profile from stanley, neoprene 1/2" x 1/8, etc. No luck with silicone membrane maybe Ebay will have. The m4 10mm screw inserts from Ebay UK to get the right zinc coated ones.

What thickness of tufnol did you use? 2mm or 3mm?

Do you think those slits are butchered? Good to use a sand attachment and hopefully smooth them out. But the gaps will be there due to the circular saw :frowning:

Thanks a lot, man! :)

I wouldn't worry much about the size of the slits on your enclosure - I can't seem to find the pics now but I'm pretty sure @nowind had slits of similar width. I'm planning to use a silicone mat between the entire enclosure and the components to water- and dustproof it - and in your case this way the size of those slits there are irrelevant, cause the components will get the impact protection they need and are gonna be waterproof regardless of the slit size. The only thing I'd worry about would be the possibility of a diminished life expectancy of the enclosure due to cracking?? But I'm guessing here. I'd be great if @trampa could have his say on your particular case - he's the manufacturer and an expert on everything regarding Trampa products.

And about the availability off the products: here in Poland I've also had to look pretty hard and long to find the stuff I needed, hence the very gradual nature of my updates ;) **Nothing** was found in any one place locally and most of it I've had to order either from China or from the some Polish sellers online. So don't get discouraged and I'm sure you'll find what you need :)

And on top of all of that, you've got VESC sixes!!! They are like a god level of diy esk8 making! I'm just saying. I'd love to afford them... maybe in the future tho ;)

Best of luck, bro!!

Thank you. I didn't know @Nowind had a build with the enclosure. Well i did manage to find a lot of items on Amazon. Only thing left is the silicone (for a reasonable price).

VESC6 yes we will see how it performs... i was 95% about to go FOCBOX but i keep hearing of software firmware issues with the new vesc tool.

Cant wait to see your build closer to finally done. These take a long time due to the very specialized parts. I wish Trampa had the enclosure and a parts kit. 

I found a cheap xt90 plug cover on hobby king.

True that!, if Trampa offered all of it on their website, that would make things tenfold easier. But prbbly for a price ;) And having the electronic components purchased from China makes it really pretty darn cheap. I only had to wait a bit for the delivery (the bit being 2 months in some cases, tho ;P).

And thanks for the silicone covers and wishes of quick fruition of the project!, it's a desire most certainly shared ;)

Edit: I've just noticed, you've got nowind's sealed gearboxes as well! Shit, bro! This is gonna be one heck of a beauty, this Trampa of yours! I do envy you as hell! :) and gonna go down the same way once I manage to gather enough funds for a next one... which will prbbly be in like 2 decades xD

I've been soldering shit since primary school, srysly. But the complete, DAMNED lack of experience working with live wires shows in the most rage-inspiring, depression-exacerbating, disheartening ways... FUUUUUUUCK!

The thing is... I've fried one of my VESCs while wiring the setup, by having the negative cable of the battery already connected to the VESC and accidentally shorting these three pins with a positive battery wire:

Wut do nao? I've done lots of SMD soldering so do you recon it'd be better to just order a spare yellow capacitor and resolder it? You think it's the only thing fried? Or maybe the chip above the fried cap and DVR may be done for as well?

Right now I've contacted @fottaz and he very kindly said he'd try to fix it for me if he can, but do you guys recon it's worth the hassle? Or is it beyond repair and I should just buy a new one?

I can relate to that statement soooooooo much :smiley:

BTW evolve gt 7" tyres fit, too, they are 50mm wide.

Care to tell me where to get those? ;) Any non-Evolve, discount sellers? ;)

Best shopping experience I've had for ages - and I'm not overexaggerating - this guy's customer service is pure gold. If you're in the EU look no further than https://eskating.eu

They have more rubber and seem durable
I don't know about any cheap 7" tyre on the market, but you can find 8". Actually I'm gonna test some cheap (like 50% price of the original ones) tyres on my MTB but the tyres feel like toys compared to the genuine and were made for wheelchairs :laughing:.

Thanks for the reminder, man! I sure am... hence:

I had to wait for literal ages for Enertion to get a grip on their FOC-Box supply, but a week after @fottaz has gotten them I had one at my place along with a nano-x Bluetooth controller. I decided to go down the Nano-x way cuz my GT2B went literally haywire and just refused to bond no matter what. Too bad I had ported it into the 3D printed casing, voiding the warranty, before testing it.

Anyways, BIEDA board is already riding and almost completely finished now :)

The Trampa's enclosure, cut to 62cm length, was just about perfectly enough to accommodate the 12s4p battery, BMS, two VESCs and all the wiring... with some 1,5mm clearance on each end ;)

![_MG_0370|690x460](upload://7xuewU1mCv3jhsGw28y26pejv2t.JPG)

The only problem with it was that I just felt the battery, after having put it into all those layers of heat-shrink (4, if I remember correctly) and padding is being squeezed between the board and the enclosure a tad too much, and so I added rising Tufnol planks between the board and the enclosure where they are attached to one another with screws. I'm gonna replace the Tufnol planks with rubber stripes when I manage to find some ;)

To save up on space and increase wire-connections reliability I decided to go completely plug-less and solder everything inside solid. The only places where I've used bullet plugs are on the external motor-wires. I also went 100% 10 AWG: including having removed all the stock VESC wiring and replaced it with 10 AWG silicone cables. And so all the main power wiring is done with those 10 AWG ones - from the battery, through the BMS, all the way to the motors. The balance wires are done with 22 AWG wires, and the charging wire with 12 AWG - the amperage on these doesn't really require anything bigger.

![IMG_0091|690x460](upload://znKrYwOXPQzX0OoqCgpRpxb82CY.JPG)

Come to think of it, the 10 AWG is also an overkill in most cases... but hell, I never had any sense of moderation anyway ;P

The only thing left to do now is to apply some fresh grip tape, heat shrink all the external motor wire's bullet connectors and put the silicone sheet between the enclosure and electronics to waterproof it, and the project will be officially finished.

The riding experience is overall beyond words - the quality of Trampa's products is impeccable, rides are just mesmerising - it's only now that I actually get what everyone online was raving about so damn much - and addictive as hell - I just wanna sesh every few hours... I really could go on, everything about it is just superb.

BUT! What I didn't know prior to starting to build it, is:
- you gotta learn a ton to get it built, which takes time, and lots of it!!,
- you gotta actually build it, which - with no prior experience in the process - takes a lot of trial, error and correction, and also sheer thinking, coming up with original ideas and learning, and hence also takes a shitton of time!!,
- and at last, and most importantly - and I do know it's just my fault not having properly assessed the costs before starting, yadda, yadda, etc. - it is just crazy pricey!!!,

I'll still be posting some finishing touches, so stay tuned for that, and thanks for sticking with me this whole time, the project was a hell of a ride (pun intended :P) and it was really nice being able to share it with the community - especially given your awesome support :)

Personal note: It's obviously totally subjective, and I'm saying that from my perspective only. Mortgage, a newborn to take care of, full-time job, university, and an East European income are not supporting factors with this kinda build - both time and money are precious commodities to me, and should I've known how much of both the project will have consumed I probably wouldn't have started it in the first place... but hell... It was probably still worth it anyway :P

I've got a small update on some of the finishing touches on the project:

First and foremost: the freshly gripped deck!
![IMG_1869|690x460](upload://3gGJMRU8axWukZrIIIXK2iIqn84.jpeg) 

I exchanged the tufnol rising pads with an extra thick rubber seal.
![IMG_1860|690x460](upload://nAtvjikScVwxg7B2OhFeJCuxcKU.jpeg)

Finally made it splashproof with the 1mm thick silicone mat!
![IMG_1861|690x460](upload://uyoCNwR6jtjQFv5wkMY3miBTSFR.jpeg)

Srewed it all together properly.
![IMG_1865|690x460](upload://xLspvuBui6ltvB9d7jgh4HTbkgy.jpeg)

![IMG_1866|690x460](upload://29T6CmTYpqXbWpLl8Hgv5WLf6w.jpeg)

Added insulation on the exit wires with shrink sleeves, electrical tape and Sugru (Sugru on the central charging wires).
![IMG_1863|690x460](upload://mSmx1zWm9eDaEv1hamLU6FgvMMb.jpeg)

Also some Sugru to cover the voltmeter wires.

![IMG_1864|690x460](upload://aYqEfrETny3bjARiRD48kZ267xG.jpeg)

The whole charging gear + the remote.
