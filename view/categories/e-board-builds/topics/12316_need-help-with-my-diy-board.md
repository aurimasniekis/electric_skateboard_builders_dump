Hi! I'm a 16 year old in an Engineering II class. For my next project I want to make my first electric skateboard but I have little to no knowledge about motors, batteries, etc. From all my reading I have a list of parts and a list of questions.

I would like a board with more range than torque since my neighborhood is really flat. I do have access to a 3D printer if that could come in handy. I weigh about 140 pounds (63 kg) and hope my board goes around 25-30 mph (40-48 kph).

Thank you for your help!

QUESTIONS-

Is it possible to print the motor mount, motor pulley, and wheel pulley? Is it worth it?

If I want to make a custom deck, what is the best material to use and what board style?

What's the best way to figuring out what size everything should by in a drive train?

If you guys have any suggestions or can help me with the specs for my drive train it would be greatly appreciated. I don't know a lot so simplicity is awesome. :wink:

Hey I just built my first board and have a couple of 3d printers so I decided to print the engine mount and wheel pulley on it.  Turned out pretty good.  A guy named Matt Carl on thingiverse has the designs I used.  Check it out:

Matt's build: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1753981

My build: http://www.thingiverse.com/make:264311

I may end up going with different trucks and mount later but for now this working pretty good!

Good luck!

I'd print the wheel pulley but not the mount or motor pulley. I don't think they will last long.

Canadian Maple or Bamboo, anything that doesn't have a drop

There is a calculator of belt size on the bbman website. 16/36 gearing is common

What's the budget for this build?  If you want lots of range you may need more batteries than 5000mah 3s batteries in Series

I have some extra money saved up. Do you have any recommendations on better batteries?

If you go with these batteries you may need to change your motor to a 190kv or below
If you live in the US @barajabali can build one to your specifications
