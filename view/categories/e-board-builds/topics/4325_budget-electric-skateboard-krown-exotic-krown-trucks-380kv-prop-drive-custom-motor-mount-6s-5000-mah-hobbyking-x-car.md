Nice work @Mikee! You can get rid of the straps for your enclosure with some 2-ton epoxy. Scuff the bottom of the board with sandpaper, scuff the contact point of the box, dump a glob of the epoxy on the board and let it dry and cure. I have a similar enclosure and once I mounted it it's never fallen off.
