Hi! Sorry if this is the wrong section of the forum but I thought it was both mechanical and electric. But it also concerns the whole thing because I'm not sure about a few things. I'm also new to the forums and have a very basic knowledge of the engineering behind a lot of it. 

So these are the base components at the moment. 
(Unfortunately I can't link all the parts)

Longboard:
Krown Krex 2 Bamboo (41 inches long) with 83mm wheels

Charger:
IMAX B6AC V2 Professional Balance Charger Discharger

ESC:

Batteries: (In parallel)
2x http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__15521__Turnigy_5000mAh_4S1P_14_8v_20C_Hardcase_Pack.html

Now to the motor, I would either be using a 400kv @ 1820watt or a 600kv @1030Watts. My question is whether or not the 600kv motor will have the needed torque with the 14.8V 4S 20C batteries I would be using. 

I calculated a gear ratio of 1:3.33 @ 8,800 RPM on the 600kv motor with a top speed of 25 MPH.

Obviously this isn't a full build and I'm missing a few parts, but purely to start with, I'm curious whether I can use this 600kv motor and the batteries in parallel or if I would need more voltage. Also, what kind of range I would be getting with this setup is a complete unknown to me. Electrical engineering is not really my area of expertise, haha. 

Thanks for reading and any advice/criticism is much appreciated.

First, you will need no less than 22.2v or 6s. 
That is the bare minimum. And it's a rather weak option. Your best bet would be a hi voltage Esc and use your 4s batteries in series for 8s system. 
Second, even 400kv is too high. 
You'd be better off with something below  250 KV 
Oh, and it's best to use an Esc designed for E-boards but if you must use an RC Esc, then use a car Esc. 
Don't try to use a boat or plane Esc

This should be required reading
