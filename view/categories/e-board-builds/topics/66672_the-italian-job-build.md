Your bms is for a 10s pack. Your pack is 9s. Everything else looks great. 
It's not hard to work on the shaft just go slow. When working on the shaft of the motor make sure you cover the motor so the metal isn't pulled into the motor by the magnet. 
I love the name :slight_smile:

Sorry, I was wrong it looks you can use a 10s on a 9s.

For the wheels maybe someone else can help you out on that one.

Hi! Nice to see someone from Italy too. I recently gevw a lot of advice to a guy that wants to build a single drive board without spend a fortune. All stuffs from AliExpress, Flipsky, hobbyKing (there is a discount code in the thread, like hobbyKing10). Maybe you can go through and compare with what you have and what we said. In your list I don't really like the 80mm wheels, they will give you really short clearance from the ground. Plus the motor mount is not great the one from hobbyKing.

Read it carefully and you will find all the links you need. Ask in case of doubts. There is listed all the parts to save money and have good stuff. Of course you can go always higher. Good luck :wink:

if your bms is only 16a you will need to bypass the bms. this current rating isn't enough.
Also, this bms would be just fine:

Try the sk8 motors.  Work with the pulleys and keys etc.  I run mine without sensors and he VESC and they are fine.

Means to wire the bms charge only.   Look up bms wiring on the forum for help.  I canâ€™t link anything right now.   Computer is being a bitch.

Motor shaft is pretty easy to grind away with a Dremel metal cutting disc but can do it by hand as well with a file if you have enough patience... The Dremel is much faster.

just make sure to cover the motor to prevent any filings being pulled into the motor with the magnets
