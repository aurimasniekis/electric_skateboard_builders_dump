What's the smallest deck + trucks you could use with a 6" to 7" pneumatic tires that won't cause wheel or shoe bite?

Is there a "Mini AT" build out there that I can get inspiration from?


Thanks!

yeah, that's my board. I sold it early 2017 to a french rider.

@Darklinks : you can get my parts, works ultra fine and compact.

Risers...to make the trucks work with the deck, need a minimum if 30 degrees.
