Those are the MBS 100mm, I'll be sticking with them for now. 
The weight difference with cf deck is shocking, had to dial down throttle to compensate lol
Can't say I'm missing the kick tail too much, this one has a very minor tail, enough for what I need which is turning the board without bending down

It came with the bumper on the front and rear, quite durable, steel lined. I'm thinking of wrapping entire edge and integrating an el strip into it.

Wow so I've been missing out apparently, riding with bindings is amazing, being able to push forward or up and backwards instead of down with your leading foot makes sharp cornering way easier

Looks amazing. Do you think you would have been able to fit a longer battery on there? Do you think the deck flex would have been an issue with the enclosure covering too much of the bottom?

It could deff fit a longer enclosure, just the only options I had are 13" and 23, 23 would be too long,18-19 could fit. 
The deck does not flex, at all

Do you think 23 would have fit if the motors faced backwards? I noticed that Jinra made a hi5ber board with a 26 in wheelbase that had a pretty long battery enclosure.

He actually had the 23, yes outward it would deff work and I would go with his deck if using **that** 23. The issue on the zenith more than the space is the taper at the center of the deck, the enclosure would overhang like 3-4"

Outward facing motors make things easier to fit overall but preclude any possibility of stealth, or standing your board up unless on pnuematic lol

Also keep in mind I'm keeping my vescs external, it's only the battery in the enclosure

@scepterr  Here's a cheaper way to go...It's a little on the shorter side, but there's enough in one sheet for roughly 3 decks or easily used for other stuff like beefing up protection gear or even putting some in your shoes for even more dampening. Stuff absorbs 90% of impact energy at high strain rates.

I‚Äôd use the overtaker but the deck is grey and won‚Äôt blend as well with the carbon fiber enclosure. Not to mention I like your deck design more. How short does the deck get at its shortest width? I‚Äôve seen pictures of tapered enclosures that mastercho makes. He may be  able to make a tapered 23 inch enclosure compatible with the zenith deck.

What do you think about the python with the mastercho enclosure. It‚Äôs the same width as the wider part of your board. If yours didn‚Äôt shorten in the middle and stayed at 7.5 inches wide all the way down, would it work well with the mastercho 23 inch?

A few tips for the those getting the shrink braid. 
If shrunk 100% it does stiffen up but still flexible, so if you want extra flexibility get a smaller size so you don't have to shrink completely for snug fit. 
An interesting feature I found is you can make fixed angles and shapes by shrinking one side more than another, so you can have a flexible fixed angle, I'll take some pics of that tomorrow to better explain.
