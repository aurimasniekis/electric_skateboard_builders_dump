Hey guys,
I soon want to start to build my own electric skateboard.

I wanted to ask you guys what you think of:
https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/WINboard-36V-800W-electric-skateboard-brushless_60606388657.html?spm=a2700.7724838.0.0.IJHGLS10

Because I was thinking about doing my board with dual hub motors and because the 360 bucks for the enertion dual hub motor would be a lot of money for me I would like to know if you guys think this might be a good cheap alternative or if it is too cheap (quality wise)?
Thanks for any suggestions!
