The goal:
~10 mi range
Enough torque to climb 25% grade hills bearing a 97 kg rider
<12 lbs
Convenient and polished enough to be a legitimate commuter tool

Description --- Unit Price --- Lbs --- Qty
Misc deck --- 60 --- 4.1 --- 1 --- DIY hollow board coming to save another 1 lb
Nano-tech 5s1p --- 4Ah --- 59 --- 1.2 --- 2 --- By far the most current and energy dense, 0.7 lb lighter than Zippy LiPo
12s 60A ebay --- 10 --- 0.15 --- 1
Flipsky 6.6 --- 111 --- 0.17 --- 1
Misc Switch --- 5 --- 0.03 --- 1
GT2B --- 26 --- 0 --- 1
SK3 6374 192 Kv --- 86 --- 1.91 --- 1 --- Numbers say it’s enough, time to build and test
Dickyho mount --- 19 --- 0.25 --- 1
15mm 16T Pulley --- 8 --- 0.1 --- 1
15x300mm Belt --- 4 --- 0.1 --- 1
40T Printed Pulley --- 0 --- 0.2 --- 1
Zombie Hawg 76mm --- 52 --- 1.5 --- 1 --- 0.5 lb lighter than 83mm flywheels
Misc Bearings --- 0 --- 0.2 --- 1
Caliber 9" --- 32.26 --- 2.0 --- 1 --- 0.25 lb lighter than 10"
Total --- $531 --- 13.2 lb

Starting to buy parts now, will be a few weeks at least
Not quite at the goal weight yet, but think I can get there with the new deck eventually.

How did this turn out? Did you hit your weight goal?
I’d love to see your zombie hawgs pulley. I have a set I’m hoping to use.

I should post the evolution of this build at some point. I hit 13 lbs using 3d printed enclosures and zombie hawgs, but had traction issues when climbing hills with poor road quality. I've moved towards Ahmyo Akasha, and reconfigured to FWD to try to improve traction.

I'm also using chain-drive, so it's less a pulley, more a spacer. If you're still interested, I can post up some pics.

I’d like to see it. FWD and chain drive on urethane are a bit unique for this space. Sounds cool
