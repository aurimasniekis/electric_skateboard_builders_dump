So my name's Ben, On the interwebs I'm InitialDriveGTR. I've got about 20 years of experience building electronics and designing systems by my self. I saw the boosted board a while back and I knew then and there I was hooked. It took me a while to get to a point with other projects before I was comfortable diverting funds into a longboard. I've got about 15 minutes of experience riding any kind of board of wheels prior three weeks ago when I slapped together this baby from amazoned parts and diyelectricskateboard. 

Stats are pretty basic with a Torque VESC and 190KV 6355 (already killed both a motor and ESC but they may be revived). I strapped ALL my drone batteries on the bottom in an 8S 32AH configuration. My burst discharge should be in the ballpark of 300A which should be adequate for now. 

Not quite sure how to post pictures yet....

Right now from what I can tell the only controls for these things are Nintendo controllers and RC car transmitters with the wheel removed.... 

I'd like to introduce the new control system I'm starting to develop called LCS. Longboard Control Surface is what I envision true fluid integration between the rider and the board. I believe the more efficiently a body can interact with a machine the better the experience to the operator. 

I work in the heavy industrial/military sector and I work on lots of very dangerous systems with incredibly complex controls networks. The idea of rolling down a hill and getting thrown off the board is unnverving and shall be dealt with in my typical manner.

The pictures should give you the gist of how things will work in terms of what the rider is responsible for. Four flex sensors in heat shrink attached to the fingahz. I shall post more as this develops over the next few weeks.

Oh man and here I was naively hoping no one would have done this idea before I get to it :) 

props man, that just seems like the most logical (or better yet.. organic?) way to have a board controlled, even if with a relatively  steep learning curve.

Exactly, it will certainly take getting used to, but I'm confident it will be a very efficient method of control once implemented correctly. 

A large part of my job is making sure safety systems for industrial equipment act as they should, and esk8 should be no exception. The ability to detect a panic stop from a rider is critical

Looking forward to that, how do you plan to implement the controls? Gesture based? left finger flex control acceleration, right finger brake with priority over acceleration, something like that?

Gestures complicate things beyond what I'm looking for. 

Arming - holding your hand like in this pic for some set period of time without having any sensor reading go out tolerance will enable output from the microcontroller to the VESC. If either the ring or pinky finger relax past a threshold, throttle will be disabled but braking will still be possible and the system will be disarmed once the board stops.

![20180520_140650|374x500](upload://ydtcz8KKFXGIuzY0BffvoAEgwoA.jpg)

Throttle will be BOTH the pointer and index fingers moving together with an allowable tolerance in deflection between the two fingers to allow for transition into braking control.

![20180520_140657|374x500](upload://6nwtxNa4Bqms6zQhJPTz50CYbH.jpg)

Braking will be the deflection between the pointer and index finger. As deflection increases between the two fingers, braking force will increase accordingly.

Cool, I'll watch your progress. But not something I'd be trying. 

Finger Combinations in oh shit moments will be forgotten. And oh shit hand flat emergency stop, needs to be easily controlled by the rider to manipulate braking force.

Think this is actually less safe. I suggest you spend a bit more time riding then 15 minutes and get used to commuting, before you delve your time into something that will likely end in decreased safety.

Please keep in mind this is all prototype. I still have a ton of work to do before anything is operable at a level I'm comfortable sharing. I'm thinking an arduino may not be best suited for what I'm looking to do in terms of data throughput so the platform may change. 

I got the e-ink displays up and running and pushed a custom graphic. The arduino only has enough RAM to write graphics in chunks and that poses a problem as the display takes about 15 seconds to update the whole screen whereas a 32bit system can push the graphic in one shot.

Fresh Lesson!

So a few weeks ago I was being stupid again and dismantled my first 6355. Putting it back together I managed to snap the casing down on the inside of my hand. That was a fun 45 seconds whacking a motor trying to get it to release my hand. And then another 10 minutes of fun and lots of pain. LESSON LEARNED.

![20180602_141807|375x500](upload://aWfqcrJjW6iON9gXqpHyHiZGOjG.jpg)

An hour of rumaging through parts yielded this thing:

![20180602_133826|375x500](upload://CzWglCYY3Zp3x7uaPKp2OKapDo.jpg)

![20180602_134209|666x500](upload://1R2i2nILI8PIDmwQD8KPvYf8xWt.jpg)

I can now safely assemble my motors without hurting myself and also smacking the magnets off the hub.

Managed to revive the first ESC/Motor pair I purchased and converted to a dual motor setup.

The first ESC I got from Torqueboards decided to wipe its memory for some reason after the first day of trials. Not sure why, my only thought is behavior typical of chinese knockoff semiconductors but I don't know torqueboards manufacturing process whether it be internal or outsourced. Long story short, got mad at Vedder for not running the boot pins to jumpers instead of hardwiring them as he did, had the boot1 pin snap off, and at this point I already had another ESC in the mail. This guy went to the side while I waited for the need for both working ESCs and for the 3 genuine ST uC samples to come in the mail.

![20180504_191322|374x500](upload://khK1vPLJXqS0PIf62ylVMhjNw2O.jpg)

A bit of hotwork and the ESC is back up and operational. Linked over CAN, must say I love the board even more. Must say NOT having the board shoot out from under me when I lift up the drivewheel is magical.

I was thinking aboot this last night. I think it would be wise to implement redundant radios (two sets of trancievers transmitting the same data, if both recieved data packets are different, fault the system) but yes the PPM input will be wired through a NC relay to a standard reciever input. The board installed electronics will have to drive the relay to switch the VESC PPM input over to uC control.

Just to be clear, under no circumstances will the board ever just STOP.

I see no reason for everything BUT throttle being disabled in the event of anything that might cause you to get knocked off the board. 

AGAIN 

E-STOP != INSTANTANIOUS STOP OF BOARD
E-STOP = NO THROTTLE

So I made a platform change, and will do so again soon I think. Moving to the ESP8266 allows me to specialize the system a bit more. Instead of using onboard ADCs, I'm using MCP3204 12 bit ADCs. You really won't find this chip much in the commercial world as onboard ADCs can do quite a lot these days. 

The MCP3204 is rated for 100,000 samples per second (100ksps) while an arduino nano can only do about 9.6ksps. Being 12-bit, it can measure 4096 points. 

Pairing this with the ESP8266s HSPI port is giving me some very clean sensor feedback. I still need to tweak the circuitry to set VRef up correctly but that should be quick to get right.

![20180614_195929|374x500](upload://dqUlD7MjYBuepqV0kut63lYiDaK.jpg)


The scope is decoding the SPI bus to verify signal transmission is clean. It's not. But it works for now. The power supply is is set to 16.8V to simulate a fully charged 4S, and feeds a Castle 10A BEC  set at 5.0V. The logic analyzer is checking proper initialization of the display, ADC, and NRF radio. Then of course checking for signal strength at 2.420Ghz with the spectrum analyzer

Welpp managed to hit my goal with minutes to spare.

Both ESP8266s are online, linked to each other over the NRF modules. The E-INK display, NRF module and MCP3204 are all happily sharing the SPI bus.

Next steps are to solder everything together, and develop the runtime code for both side of the LCS.

Started combining the hardware into a common board. Both sides of the interface will have two 4CH ADCs, E-INK display and radio. 

![20180619_181025|374x500](upload://enOBUU2vQzMnR54U4CaCcCk9voJ.jpg)

![20180619_181037|374x500](upload://wJnJxSXvrq6AjeyzUVNXQziHAvJ.jpg)

All boards will be mounted to the underside of the polycarbonate panel as such:

![20180619_181056|375x500](upload://wfJgf6JUpRxm6VDgL2GfjIhNxnN.jpg)

Eventually I may seal the edges of the panel to the board but if I'm going to change decks I'll wait as I would like to locate the E-INK display forward of the front truck mounting. 

Long term, I'll integrate the final control system for both halves of the LCS into a single surface mounted board for mass production.

A little off topic but I found this dinosaur today rummaging through a bin.  

Edit forgot pics of the board...

This board provided an electrical interface to the PLC system I have installed on my 1998 540i Sport. The PLC manages the BMWs electrical systems through three ISO 9141 drivers and a PIC18F4550 (and 2550) in addition to driving an inverted graphics library for a 512x32px VFD used as a HUD...

This one I made by hand a few months ago. I like building circuits on Veroboard before drafting an actual board as it saves a lot of time and money dealing with Fab houses...

So the dedicated boards for both halves of the LCS system are built and operational. Some minor ground issues (helps to connect both halves of the circuits grounds) but everything seems to be working as it should.

Phew, busy weekend with LCS. I feel its a good time for an update.

I had the idea to stick a 1/8" 4 flute square endmill into my dremel. YEAH. Not the best but it will get covered so IDGAF. 

![20180622_200151|374x500](upload://k2goC3W2B82DIGyKoRjk00o8Nd4.jpg)

![20180623_161406|374x500](upload://A6RdaCookimzhecbuWPa4ukzVMT.jpg)

But enough of the hand milling. Cosmetic parts I CNC on my robut J3. This is the GPS/EINK Cover plate:

![VideoCapture_20180624-164232|281x500](upload://cij6Sx6OG5o5MKpUBe2BfMhbmby.jpg)

And this is the electronics enclosure:

![VideoCapture_20180624-164349|281x500](upload://tmUxTeK3FgKWEEMgpkAg65YntOK.jpg)

Throw itall together:

![20180623_175430|374x500](upload://rMDApoeTYqBYIkxvgX9S45c8MBw.jpg)

Add Grip Tape (FRESH LESSON: USE GLOVES TO APPLY OTHERWISE YOU WILL SCRATCH OFF YOUR FINGERPRINTS)

![20180623_191217|374x500](upload://sjzNqftq6RWwkzBXVwywuFXHYUv.jpg)

OPERATIONAL (MINUS the VESCs for now)

![20180624_163653_040|374x500](upload://xrUO6GU6cjySXXPZbsGyXH277n7.jpg)

Oh and the glove is now at a point where I'm comfortable with its mechanical integrity:

My old man used to work with one of the founders wayyyy back in the early 2000's when A123 was getting started, before they went bankrupt. Having personally seen their E-bike and what their technology could do, they have always been the best in my mind. 

While these cells only have 1.1AH, their safety is industry leading. They pass crush, nail penetration, external shorting and over discharge tests. My experience in the heavy industrial manufacturing and DoD systems has taught me the importance of safety over performance. 

The idea of my board somehow rolling under an 18-wheeler with a trailer load of JP5 and exploding scares the shit out of me.

I'll be building the packs into either 10S10P or 8S12P I'm thinking unless there be reason to go otherwise.

Hmmm interesting they do seem like pretty interesting cells. It'd be interesting to see some more investigation into battery pack failures. As even 30Q's are pretty safe on their own https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://eu.nkon.nl/sk/k/30q.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwi6-LSk5PTbAhXk6YMKHVLtA4MQFjAAegQIABAB&usg=AOvVaw279pV66YaEwoyM-XVvSkL-

Passing all the same crush test short circuit and the like. 

Do do good testing on pack design and what is causing people's boards to catch fire would require destroying thousands of dollars of perfectly good cells. And I sure as hell can't afford that lol. 


That being said thank you for snowing me these cells they'd be perfect for like a sailboat battery bank!

Argggggg I hate work sometimes. Like the past 6 months. Probably the next 2 years. But oh well.

So first & foremost, this past 4th of July (MURICA!!! HAPPY BDAY <333) I was out riding in my usual spot around 2200. I'm coming up over this slight hill at about 25mph and I see an old woman and her equally old dog making their way across the street. I start getting on the brakes expecting her to make her way across by time I get there. NOPE. I start REALLY getting on the brakes and the back end of the board starts fishtailing, and I'm about 25 feet away. So I dump the board, and this poor woman almost loses it apologizing and thanking me for taking the spill... 

![20180704_225612|374x500](upload://wjEdc2575Vmsnb5n4NzhPc4s2cJ.jpg)

So right now the original VESC I repaired failed again, this time a DRV related error. New VESC comes in tomorrow, and in the mean time I've been getting some battery work done:

One pack is complete. Have yet to charge it up though. 
For cells that are isolated from the main grouping of cells for that stage of the series loop, I applied a secondary layer of 8mm strip on top of the base layer.

So I've been posting mostly to the picz no wordz thread but time for an update to LCS.

I got the 4.2" E-INK display electrically operational:

![20180811_213015|666x500](upload://lZMPWoVoJObKgEHZJ80gSTySOrd.jpg)

I decided for now, especially considering I may mass produce this system, that it would be wise to design a generic housing for the electronics:

![20180813_000823|374x500](upload://iBdkArDrr1EIQ1hNsk0TPikQyYN.jpg)

This one didn't fit a single electrical component without modification, but it did bolt up to the truck mounting perfectly... Updating the design gave me this:

![20180813_191346|374x500](upload://u6uERutA7kKh6bSpvnb8aA4fDUg.jpg)

It's been a while since any major update to LCS. That said, I have been doing a ton of work developing the software and electronics to make it reliable and usable as a control surface to my longboard. For now,  until I have the time to take a proper video of the system working, this will have to suffice.

![20180829_190510|666x500](upload://p8KFvTp9UqQp6CmQGNcc8egvIGU.jpg)

Some of the new software features include storing configuration data such as finger offsets on the SD card, data logging of speed and gps location, automatic wireless syncronization of parameters between the board and glove system to name a few.
