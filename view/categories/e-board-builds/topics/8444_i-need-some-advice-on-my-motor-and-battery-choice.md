Hello my name is Jouke.
i'm kinda new to this electric skateboard thing but i would like to build one. I have searched a lott of forums and have red a lott of topics but i still have some questions.

Some information that might help with answering the questions: i'm planning on using the vesc i'm planning on using this board http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/carbon-fiber-electric-skateboard-deck/ and these trucks wheels belts etc, http://www.enertionboards.com/diy-electric-skateboard-kits/mono-drive-mechanical-kit

Question 1, The motor. I'm still not sure what kind of motor i should buy I weigh 73 kg (161 pounds) I live in a really really flat area (The Netherlands) and I would like to go at least 35kmph (22mph) top speed (can be more, I dont mind) I would like to have some torque (doesn't have to be insane but i would like to have atleast some :wink: ). and I would like to buy a second motor later on and mount it on there as well so i have a dual drive instead of a single. So the motor length would need to be something close to 55 mm. I hope you have enough information to recommend me a good motor. :grin:

Question 2, the battery, I also don't really know what battery I should buy. Because  i'm going to buy this board http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/carbon-fiber-electric-skateboard-deck/ but two 6s batteries wired in series (so i have 12s) will not fit in there because the hight of the space in the board is only 28 mm. So i'm asking you what should I do with my battery problem. It has to fit in the board it has to atleast have 12s and it has to drive me more than 14 km (9miles)

I hope you guys can help me. 
thanks for reading.

That deck works best with the space cell battery, but it sounds like you want a raptor. 1 motor sounds like enough for your needs. I'd allocate the funds to batteries over 2 motors.

I think the space cell battery is way overpriced. 320 euros plus shipping costs and import fee's. 

I was thinking about making my own battery pack with 30 Samsung 25R Cells in the same configuration as the space cell.  3 parallel groups of 10 cells in series.  You would get the same specs as the space cell for 160 euros plus shipping and import fee's. 

Is that a good idea ore just straight up stupid?

Thanks for the quick reply btw I really appreciate it.

I don't think it's so overpriced, consider the price of a bms, charger, wires etc, up to you though.

That's true,  I haven't thought about that. Chargers are not cheap  

Do you have a recommendation for a good motor that fits everything?

Ollin, DIY electric skateboard have cheap and good motors. Enertion's motors are expensive IMO. HobbyKing SK3s are great as well.

Do you know if this motor will work for the expectations I had in mind diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/electric-skateboard-motor-5055-190kv/

On the bottom on the page it said it can run on 6s battery. So I thought if I put two 3s batteries in series it would work to its fullest potential.  Right?

Definitely get a 215-245kv motor. On 6s, 190kv = 23kmh at 15/36 gearing.

Also, don't get a 50mm motor for single drive. Get this bad boy: http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__18128__Turnigy_Aerodrive_SK3_6364_245kv_Brushless_Outrunner_Motor.html

Thanks! 
Great,  now I only have to find a solution to my battery problem. I don't really want to spend 330 euros plus shipping and import fee's for a battery

If you your decent at soldering you can look into some 18650 batteries. They are a much reliable option.

How do you charge them if you have 10 in series and 3 groups in parallel?
