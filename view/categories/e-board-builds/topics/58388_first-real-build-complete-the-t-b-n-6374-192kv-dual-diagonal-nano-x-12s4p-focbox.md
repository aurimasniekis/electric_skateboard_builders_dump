So this is my first real attempt, Inspired by you folks here on this forum. I call it the TBN... Thrifty but Nifty!!!!  I got about 95% of my build used thanks to you members and some offer up postings. @JohnnyMeduse  hooked up with the  Foc Boxes, , @theviith  with the motors,) @ethel  with wheels and mounts(still being delivered via ups), @Mattmccrary8  with the 12s4p and @chris.hunt  my nano-x(not shown). Got some riptide pivot cups via @squishy654  advice, the calibers and bushings on the cheap through Lui,from what was once muir skate and finally @johnny_261  for the pulley kits (in route through USPS...  still searching offer up or facebook for a deck! I will try to stay updated on this journey!!!!![image|375x500](upload://u5RNF2u3QugFEhv70JpO0Jgp4Xx.jpeg) 1st edit: corrected grammar and most errors
