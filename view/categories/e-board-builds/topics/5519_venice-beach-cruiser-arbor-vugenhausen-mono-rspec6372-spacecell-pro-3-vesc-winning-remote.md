I'm new to this forum but I've been gobbling up information on here over the past several weeks and I'm ready to start compiling the parts for my first build. 

First, a little about my aspirations for this build. I live in SoCal, near da beach and this board will really mostly be for fun and getting around Venice Beach and Santa Monica. There are a few hills in Santa Monica specifically and I'd like to be able to get up them without issue (weight ~180lbs) but the area is mostly flat.  I'm editing this top post as I go and adding links as I purchase & identify items I want for my own sanity and tracking.

**My main goals for this build are:**
-Easy Cruising and effortless carving (I've been snowboarding for 15 years) 
-Reliability
~15 Mile Range (down to beach, cruise along water, and back)
-Safe battery chemistry (thus the Li-Ion)
-20mph top speed
-mellow hill climb abilities

**Here's the gear list**
-Arbor Vugenhausen **(purchased)** https://goo.gl/cCOLNk
-Raw Metal Caliber 2s  **(purchased)** https://goo.gl/ntESDF
-Kegels 80mm w/Bones REDs  **(purchased)** https://goo.gl/4O6FHD

**_-Mono Drive-train-_**
-Enertion R-Spec 6372 190kv **(purchased)** http://goo.gl/atROyd 
-Enertion Motor Mount **(purchased)** http://goo.gl/IaVYtl
-Enertion VESC Platinum **(purchased)**
-SpaceCell 10s3p **(purchased)** http://goo.gl/M22I7d
- @JuniorPotato93 Designed, 3D Printed 36T pulley 12mm
  @onloop 15t 12mm motor pulley and 12mm belts **(purchased)** http://goo.gl/Nx6We7
-@torqueboards 2.4ghz Nano Remote Controller **(purchased)**  diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-2-4ghz-nano-remote-controller/

Should be just what I need:

Thanks to all who helped along the way. Now we wait for parts.

Cheers!

The only thing I'm unclear about-- If I go dual motors- will Dual VESCs fit inside of the SpaceCell Enclosure with out heat concerns? Or am I going to need an additional enclosure?

You should ask @EnertionSupport or @onloop abt this

Not speaking for enertion here, but on the pro3 you will have enough space for a dual setup, it's designed for that purpose. You'll even have space at the front of the enclosure where the 10 extra cells of the pro4 would have

Omgg another Santa Monica guy! Just as a heads up it may be up to at least a month till you get a vesc, I ordered one from Chaka a few weeks ago and was told two weeks then, just emailed them yesterday and was once again told two weeks. Let me know if you want some orange 90mm wheels, I'm thinking I'm going to convert to 83mm wheels if I can get these 90's off my hands.

hey Mike- thanks for the offer. I've gotta stick to 80mm as that's the same size as the Hummies. Once i get my shit together i'm def going to be looking for other riders in my hood to meet up with and compare notes!

Hell yeah! I'll contact you as soon as my build is all put together so you can check it out. I've been experimenting with wheels sizes and think you'll do great with 83mm, 90mm may theoretically mean a higher top speed but thats also a higher amp draw and less range, plus I've noticed it takes more effort to push 90mm than 83. If you see a guy riding around the beach today with big orange wheels in the front and tiny black wheels in the back, thats me!

a dual VESC will also be able to fit in the pro4, so don't worry about room. 

I'd only be concerned about wheelbase + the space cell pro enclosure length.

Thanks for the word on the SpaceCell @cmatson 

I checked out the measurements and the deck i'm considering has a 23.5" max wheel base whilst the space cell is 22" long. should be alright IF i stick to the hub motors.

Still trying to quantify if that is the right move or not.

For anyone wondering-- @Hummie messaged me directly and answered some of my above questions specifically as they pertain to his Hubs. Putting them in thread here for the benefit of the community:

Regarding Kv ratings of the hubs:**90kv or 80kv on 10s** is good. Depends how fast u want to go. I like the 90 on 12s as they will do 28mph... I responded that i wanted to cap at around 21mph, he recommended 80Kv for me.

Regarding Outer Wheel Size of Hubmotors- 80mm -- same a Orangatang Kegels 80mm 

Regarding truck size: "I'm only selling them with the Paris 195 truck set as on the site Steelhubs.com"

Regarding Hill Climbing: "I don't know the number incline I do but on 60 amp to the motor u can see how it does on my video. I just changed it to 70 and crushed the new evolve gt last night."

_^^this makes we worry that with the 40amp fuse on the SPACECELL I'm going to have different results -- can anyone add some color to this?_

you"ll be fine running them on less than 70 amps.. the tests I did with Jason was with a space cell capped at 40amps, and the hubs had no problems- neither did jacobs.

Dope-- I understand that you and Jason are going to post your results soon but I'm really antsy in my pantsys about ordering a few parts over the next week before I leave on a 3 week work trip. 

What kind of top-speed are you seeing on those hummies w/VESC and that 10s3p battery of yours capped at 40a? Are you running the 80kv or 90kv? All-steels or version 1 of the hubs? Any idea what kind of average mileage you're seeing with that config on a full charge?

or-- maybe @Hummie can supply the RPM of those suckers?
 
Sorry if these are all stupid questions (and maybe theres a calculator that I can plug numbers into but I havent found one yet). 

Thanks man.

```
we got about 23mph top speed on hummie's with 10s3p- don't know if they are 80 or 90kv, but I'm going to assume 80.

these were version ones (so the aluminum ones, apoxied to an arsenal truck) and they were running fine- after a long 10+ mile ride, the hubz weren't more than 35-40 degrees celsius (roughly 90-100f), and that was going 75% throttle and up most of the time on shitty sidewalks. no play in the motor yet, everything is still rock solid which is a definite positive after than ride.

at the end of the ride (video here so you can see what kinda roads we were dealing with: https://youtu.be/Kvu-eFgkrAw) I put some teaser test footage in.

mileage is yet to be determined, but it is definitely less than my single drive Rspec (that's to be expected though). it  depends a lot on how you ride it, because during our long ride I didn't actually waste that much battery, but during the hill tests, acceleration tests, and laps, the space cell was heavily drained even though the distance was much shorter.

not stupid questions dude!!

Little update here. I went down to the Arbor flagship store on Venice Beach tonight to roll around on the Backlash. This is the board in the flesh:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/3/363872847046126921bb2aa7fcc5fef9f5368b16.jpg" width="666" height="500">

I dig it, but damn, those maple 9ply decks are heavy as hell! Then, just to confuse matters, I road around on another model, the VÜGENHAUSEN. I think i changed my mind. So sick:

Nice thing is both of these completes had a pair of Caliber IIs on them and that's the truck I'm leaning towards at this moment (as I'm still unsure about HUBs for my first build). Pretty awesome feel on this deck. Anyhow-- further down the rabbit hole I go....

I totally have the Backlash! I bought it second hand from my friend who is sponsored by arbor; he's a downhill guy. the concave is amazing, though I sawed off all of the excess wood past the trucks, leaving me with a 30" board. I would go with the second board if I had the choice.

I think the decision should boil down to whether or not you want a kick- 

I like having one, but don't find myself using it much. But, for simple things like swinging your board around using one foot when you are just standing around is a really nice plus. 

lastly, the James kelly pro model has a kick, but also less wood than the backlash, so it's a hair lighter.

yea the kick was the reason I was gravitating toward the backlash initially but i messed around on that other deck and that little bit of tip past the truck does give you a little bit of leverage to pivot the board a little- I'm thinking it may be okay.

Today was a good day. I took the plunge and held my own feet to the fire with this build. I bought a complete analog setup to push around so I can really start jonesing for moar powa.
https://cdn.meme.am/instances/64375973.jpg

I ultimately decided on the following foundation to build upon:
-Arbor Vugenhausen (purchased) https://goo.gl/cCOLNk
-Raw Metal Caliber 2s (purchased) https://goo.gl/ntESDF
-Kegels 80mm w/Bones REDs (purchased) https://goo.gl/4O6FHD

After doing more reading, I decided that I probably shouldn't go down the dual-hubmotor road for my first build. @hummie seems like he's improving his design every day so I'm going to wait until my second build (or an update to this one down the road) to take that plunge.

I updated the top post and modified the title to reflect my changes. In other news-- anyone have any idea what length belt I need??

minor update. got some parts this week after being away for a while:

what's everyone's opinion on mounting the SCP3 with threaded inserts with epoxy/glue as opposed to drilling thru the deck. Unfortunately the deck I bought came gripped. :expressionless: https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=node%3D16410701&field-keywords=wood&rh=n%3A16410701%2Ck%3Awood

Plan is to head to the HWstore this weekend and the pieces I need. I also plan to grab some degreaser and remove the powder coating from the motor mounts per LHB's blog so they match the raw trucks.

I'm also thinking about sanding and staining the deck so the bottom looks like the newer model year:

and then trying to find a vinyl that I can accent the SCP3 with to match it: http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/architectural-markets/home/product-catalog/~/Architectural-Finishes/Architectural-Finishes/?N=2885+8702914+8706918+3294857497&rt=c3&Nrpp=15&Nrpp=60

and down the road re-gripping with the OEM sheet (that one^^^) to tie the arbor thing all together.

still waiting on power and brains for this thing as of this moment. these projects should keep me busy until they turn up.

mine was done via drilling through the deck and mine came with grip tape alread on there. however I drilled mine slightly smaller than needed hammered them in a bit then I used the bolts (without the SCP3) to bolt through the board until it pulled the inserts into the deck snuggly. this meant that there's a bit of excess grip under the lip of the insert

Tapped the pulley. Had to file down a couple bulges after a couple screw ups (my fault- impatience). @JuniorPotato93 The screw pegs broke clear off on all 5. I was careful as all hell especially on the last couple, no luck. I went on without them, I think there is plenty of threading without them.

I've seen them break as well. There's enough thread in the pulley to hold these on. Especially with 5 bolts.  The real purpose of the studs with the trough holes was to allow a flat surface to start the tapping for the threads. They probably don't provide much extra strength in terms of clamping force against the wheel. I could eliminate these and just reduce it to amount of material used and reduce print time marginally.
```

```
With regards to the screw bulges, the material closest to the inside is thin but that's a limitation of the truck hangers. I too had one tapped hole bulge on me. I think it may be due to material, chips from tapping, being stuck in there and pushed as the screw passes through.  I used a compressor to blow out the rest of the holes and those turned out okay.  With the lock nuts version, that's not an issue as the bolt will pass right through.  Your print looks good though.  It's still kinda weird to see something I worked on out in the real world but I'm glad it's helping people with their boards! :grinning:

Does your bulge/screw knock on the hanger at all? Mine does. Haven't had a moment to look at what exactly it is yet as the motor mount is blocking it. Will have a look when I return from Vegas.

Yeah i have noticed that even with as much even torquing the pulley messy not sit 100% true to the centred of the wheel. One of mine fits pretty much dead center and doesn't touch even though when you spin it you can see the runout I'd slightly off.  The second is slightly off  when there's no force on the board but once I stand on it and roll around the knocking was not there.  But also these have a very tight tolerance around the truck hanger.  There's not a whole lot of room to work with with an unmodified calibre hanger and the kegel core.

hey mike- thanks for the offer- I've got a lot going on this week and next so maybe down the road. Hopefully by the time I'm not so busy I'll have my SpaceCell and VESC.

Hey gang. I'm assembling the drive train today. I'm questioning if mounting the 6372 rspec with the motors wires out the back is the right way to go. The entry point into the motor is scary close to the mount. Does that seem right??

also- i begining to understand why so many people around here use 1/2" risers. :confused: theres no where for the wires to go under the motor with 1/4" and the motor is going to hit the deck under heavy turning. looks like im going back to the skate shop today

wires back is the right way to go. You can kind of adjust the angle on the mount though you may end up with the CF plate hitting the trucks. In my case I shaved off a 1mm of my trucks to make room for the CF plate and angled it more down toward the ground. I use 5/16" risers myself.

10-4. I think my situation is slightly diff with the 63mm motor tho. either way- i know this is the prescribed method so im going with it for now until someone tells me im an idiot. 

I went down the the Arbor store, got some stiffer bushings and 1/2' risers. mounting those up now. 

Also notice that my damn BMS on the spacecell is also now set to a different mode and not showing percentage. I'm going to peel that back and push some buttons.

Weird one. Just took the motor out of the box and permanently mounted it to the calibers.. It appears that my pulley is either not a perfect circle or the motor shaft is bent. There's a slight wobble when the motor spins. anyone seen this before? Its not super distinct but you can see it in this video. Ideas @EnertionSupport ? I've logged a case as well. Thanks!

I just assembled my drivetrain with the 6372 rspec over the weekend. No power to the motor yet but when spinning the motor by hand, the pulley on mine goes perfectly round. Not sure what that will do to your belt over time.

the motor shaft looks like it's not moving up/down, so i'm guessing the gear as well.  If you remove the gear - spin the motor again and look for up/down or side/side play which would mean a bent motor shaft.  Likely just the gear is slightly off center when drilled out for 8mm.

GL!

I had somewhat of a tough time getting my pulley on as well. I thought it'd go on a little easier than it did. I sat the motor on the flat side with the shaft pointing up and put all of my weight down on the pulley. Only then did it slide all the way down.

I have a good feeling I'll need a pulley removal tool if that pulley needs to come off or I re-use the mount for a different motor. I hear the 6372 rspec is a badass for mono drive anyways, so I don't see that happening anytime soon. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Thanks to everyone who suggested a few things about the pulley motor sitch. I'll have a closer look tonight when i get home.

In the mean-time. I **got** **my** ***VESC!*** (woohoo)
this one has the newly designed capacitor board. definitely tidy, also the whole hting is smaller than i realized (18650 battery for size comp):

I dig the new design but, the damn reciever connection is completely obstructed and dangerously close the the Negative lead:

@onloop, couldn't macrofab just as easily turn the board 180 like this before shrink wrap?

Anyhow, after much tinkering with different size heat shrink, i settled on the hoodrat solution (electrical tape) to shield the receiver connection from poking the leads. I soldiered up the bullets and can't flipping wait to plug this into my uneven-pulley-having drive train tonight!

Oh right-- I cut a nice chunk of the shrink wrap out where the MOSFETS are. Hoping to get ahead of any potential heat issues!

The board is assembled and this is the last piece. Hopefully the BLDC tool doesnt suck the life out of me tonight and I can  get my maiden voyage in before sunset! Stay tuned

You could consider bending the pins to 45 degree.

Or my preference is solder your receiver wire on direct.

The pulley teeth are what needs to be examined for concentricity. The flange can be slightly off and it won't be a problem.

If the teeth are not perfect will send a new one.

So jsut want to be sure I'm right here. Again, SCP3 and a R-Spec 6372 motor. Ran motor detection and got:
Detection results:

BEMF Coupling: 628.77

Detection results:

BEMF Coupling: 625.77

Detection results:

Just PPM. Make sure to set the min max pulsewidth settings and rebind if you adjust the throttle trim.

Startup boost is the minimum duty cycle essentially. I'd leave it alone unless you have startup problems in which .05 sounds like a good conservative max.

okay-- nerves have simmered. Beer and vape in hand.

Didnt periscope, but i caught the [shit-eating grin](https://www.dropbox.com/s/urwov7axd5pgvtb/2016-08-29%2019.28.08.mov) on my face within the first 5 minutes of riding:


No, i'm not wearing a helmet. I will. I was so pumped i ran outside with my goddamn workboots on. had to run back up. 

Second, i'm astounded at how fast this thing is. I weigh around 185 right now. The board is heavy as hell (not sure exactly how heavy but 9-ply maple is a lot of weight) I hit 24mph and there was still A TON LEFT to go. I pussed out. Maybe tomorrow I'll see how fast i can go:

The brakes were a bit weak. And honestly, that was probably a good thing for my first ride. I was stopping way earlier found myself coasting ALOT. 

I'm lucky enough to have a pretty good stretch of newly-paved road in the neighborhood. I did a little analysis and i find that about 17mph is perfect cruising for wide streets and long flowy carves. Probably slower than I would be going on snow, but same feeling. Amazing.


So anyhow, I guess my question for the community is-- what should I do to try and up by braking power a bit??

More to come for sure.. And i want to say thanks to everyone that helped along the way. @Jinra @sl33py @onloop @JuniorPotato93 @racidon @cmatson and anyone i may have forgotten.      You guys are awesome.

Up the motor min regen to 50/60 and dial it back as needed. Only the battery min regen dictates how much is going back into the battery. I'm using -90A (between 2 VESCs) on mine with -16A battery regen (10s4p)

In regards to what you think might be the motor moving side to side, did you put in the "grub" screws. I missed those on mine at first and it turned out the whole mount would move ever so slightly when torque was applied giving the illusion the motor was wobbly.
Best way to test if it's the mounting system and tighten your trucks so they won't move and push on the mount and see if it slightly moves side to side. 
If you can't tell check by applying a lot of force in one direction and rotate the wheel whilst doing so and see if the belt moves slightly over and pull in the other direction and rotate the wheel again.

They pulley was snug initially. Just pulled it apart to inspect and it seems that it is indeed just the flange @onloop so not to worry. My 12mm pulley actually doesn't have a grub screw hole @racidon but it seems to be alright. Only slight in-out movement. Not a ton.
