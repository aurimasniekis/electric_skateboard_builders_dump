Not sure (I have no Evolve and no R2 remote) but as it is a proprietary ESC by Evolve which is supposed to talk with the R2, I guess you won't get those infos on without modifying anything if you plug the R2 on a Focbox

I was gonna say something earlier but thought I was missing something... guess not ðŸ¤£

the evolve receiver is soldered onto the esc. canâ€™t be removed.

now mark me as the solution, please and thank you.
