Finally finished my first build. Its just a single drive (Racestar 5065) Will look at upgrading to a bigger 6374 motor and even spacing the wheels from the trucks to accommodate dual. The battery is amazing and I can not recommend it enough. Made by Shenzhen Matrix Battery Co., Ltd. Its 10s5p and I was looking at buying a welder and making my own but William (sales05@jzmatrix.com) came through with this battery at $220 USD using Samsung 30q cells. 
The Motor mount is from good old Boardnamics and its just a 50amp flipsky VESC. The gear system Is 3D printed by IdeaTB https://www.facebook.com/ideatb/ and fitted like a charm.
Used an old Clarinet case as the housing which works a treat if not being a little close to the ground and I had to reverse mount the motor heal side as I had a few rookie mistakes with belt drive. Attached are photos. Runs really well with the belt needing a little better alignment

All up the build cost $485 USD

Everything looks good except for the ground clearance 🤣

Also don't push that flipsky vesc too hard.

I agree with Alan :+1:

An upgrade to your enclosure not only improves looks, but will increase the safety of your components (from the ground, water, whatever else) if properly done

As long as you don't go over any speed bumps, you should be a-ok

You can push a vanda Vesc pretty hard and they aren't very expensive.

How can you tell if this is your first build? I thought diyeboard 10s5p was 'good' after a 10s2p meepo with bad cells.

I have seen worse. The only major flaw I see in that pack is the absence of fishpaper between p-groups.

There are a few other things I would have done differently but it seems like a decent pack for the money.

That isn't your battery, is it? Because if you count the number of cells, it's clearly just 15 times 2 which is 30, not 50...

## \#32 Posted by: Fraserrazor Posted at: 2019-05-15T19:42:28.369Z Reads: 92

```
The pictures of the battery opened and wrapped in shrink wrap appear to be two completely different batteries. @Rusins pointed out something blindingly obvious which is the open battery appears to be a 10s3p battery. Dimensions don't add up to scale either. The open battery shows a 232mm to 138mm (1.68:1) length to width ratio which does not correspond to the shrinkwrap battery which is clearly over a 2:1 ratio in terms of length to width. My guess is the battery you have does not have samsung 30Q cells but is a 10s5p config or it does have samsung 30Q cells but is in a 10s3p configuration with a fake section commonly found in misquoted chinese batteries where an empty chamber is covered in shrink wrap to make the battery seem larger.

Just my thoughts

Not... 40 cells is 180$ on Imr and if a company buys in bulk they can get cells below 3$

I can get 50 Q30s with shipping from nkon for 197.78usd
(Shipped to Ireland) 

And just get some copper wire and solder,
would be cheap and I wouldn't have to wait for Chinese stuff to arrive.

I can sorta see how they got $220 a pack

He said it was 50 cells

So it would be around 220$ just for the cells

Add a bms and work time??

Becuase they are mass produced and 1 in 1000 is a bomb. The corners are the positive side of the cells are not trimmed, the wiring is low gauge and non flexible, the power rocker is the lowest possible cost part available and it is all assembled by underage slaves.

So buy one, it'll probably work. If not it's only your board that will burn to a crisp and maybe your house 🤷‍♂️

That makes me suspect these batteries are great for anything except extreme vibration.  AKA: terrible for esk8.

Esk8 batteries have different requirements than almost any other battery, including ebike batteries.

That requirement is extreme unrelenting vibration that will destroy things in the most unpredictable ways.
