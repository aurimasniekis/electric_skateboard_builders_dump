Didn't really get a good look at this last night but I'm realizing these are Vertigo Trucks!!!!! Boom!!!! The board, bindings, wheels, and rubber were effectively free!!!!! Bwahahahahah!!!

Well as for plans of build 
Motors - 2x 6374
Mount- Stainless and printed Idea Special, 
Battery- just got myself a spot welder I will repair and then zap me together some cells.
Esc- lucky enough to be a beta tester for 2x 6.0 VESC.
Oh man oh man so stoked!!!!

If you can afford a trampa deck you will not go back, i really like the flex of the board :)

Real Dirt is the off road machine for now, planning on an urban Carver as well in future.
