These babies are sweet! 
So much grip and smooth riding and still very stable at 25mph.

Great to hear @Namasaki! Have you used any of the flywheel clones floating around? Do you like these better? They [make a 107mm version](http://www.sk8trip.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=FW10780Set&Category_Code=eflywheels) that I've wanted to try.

My favorite E-Board wheels. Bumps, cracks, rocks... they can take practically anything you throw at them.

Yes I have. 90mm and 97mm(blue)
I didn't care for the 97s but the 90s are very good imo.  There not as soft a urethane as the abec11's
But they still grip pretty well and they are very stable at speed. I've gone 30+ mph on the yellow wheels with my Carvon duals and it felt pretty solid.

I like 90mm Abec 11 Flywheels on my electric boards. 75's are what I'm riding now. I've tried the Orangutang orange Kegals and the 83mm Flywheels, but the 90's just handle the bumps and cracks a bit better without adding too much extra weight. I ride both the Abec 11 72mm and 77mm Freerides on my regular board. The 77mm's handle the rough streets a bit better, but the 72's get up to speed faster.

I have 90mm 78a Abec clones, but I find myself searching. Firstly, they're a bit big for my preferred length of deck (like 650mm wheelbase), which leads to a bit of instability at speed (I think). They are also too hard. I actually think they're closer to like 81a or so. The grip is good, but it makes for a bit of a stiff ride, and I feel everything. I'm going for some 83mm clones, unknown duro, which are hopefully going to be a bit nicer. One day I'll fork out for some real Abecs, a bit softer.

I haven't tried smaller than 90mm on me eboard. 
I've thought of trying 83s but I was told that larger wheels are more stable and roll over rocks better. 

Your right, the clones are harder than Abec's. And they are rather grueling on rough roads. 
They are more stable at high speed than the Abec's in my opinion. I've done 30+ mph on both using same deck, trucks and bushings. 
My wheelbase is 828.7 mm
I'm using  90a-96a bushings.
Bushing are tight in front and very tight in rear. 
Hard to turn at low speed. 
Easier to turn and stable at high speed.

I'm using the 83 mm Flywheels on my Raptor right now and they are gorgeous! The Enertion wheels are good but a bit too hard imo. (Check out Jasons privat Raptor)
I totally forgot how good the ABEC 11 urethane is, because I have used different HAWG wheels for sliding in the "old days".

In my opinion 83 mm is the best between ride height and comfort. 
You can go through cracks and potholes without scaring the shit out of you and have a small risk of wheelbite in tight turns.
I don't like huge rise pads and try to avoid them, because they give you speed wobbles.

Thanks for the tip about the riser pads. I first installed them to have enough motor to deck clearance without sacrificing ground clearance.  But I think I'm gonna have to loose them for stability sake.

If you are having minor problems with wheelbite, you can always file a small wheel well to give yourself more room. I personally prefer being a bit lower to the ground.

I think there just a clone.
There good though. A bit hard for there duro rating. 
I got som 97mm also but they where very wobbly.

Tarzan, how much work to get the Flywheels on your Raptor?  What pulleys did you use?
```

---
## \#19 Posted by: Tarzan Posted at: 2016-05-10T05:57:56.350Z Reads: 309

The old aluminum pulley from enertion.
You need a 7mm drill and maybe 15 min of work. Quite easy!

[quote="Tarzan, post:19, topic:2962"]
7mm drill
[/quote]

Jason suggests 6mm but I believe 6.5 or 7mm are ok as well if you don't overdrill. http://youtu.be/J40FfVTBxVc

Yes I know, but the Flywheels have a different rim shape.
I tried 6 mm and the bolts do not line up with the holes in the pulley.
6,5 mm are working but you need some strong force to get the bolts in.
7 mm are still not perfect but it is much easier to line holes and screws up.

I have drilled around the spokes because it isn't working when you drill two holes in one "rim hole".
If you do it in one hole the space between the screws is to narrow.

been using the 90mm 75A on all my builds - kegels are hard as a rock in comparison. I think its because they have much less meat around the stiff core compared to the 90mm abecs.

I tried a few wheels in the past and, even though I dont like the look of the flywheels that much, I still always come back to them. they hold up forever and ever and offer great grip on shitty roads and overall a superplush ride. :blush:

@Lizardking0069 
I don't think there would be a big difference in weight between 75a and 81a 
279g per wheel 
1116g for a set (2.46lb)

I messaged a seller and they said 75a is being discontinued and 78a will be the lowest duro

That's what they told me but I bought from another place and now they're out of stock. The ones available might be the last. I haven't messaged abec directly though.

Shipping to AUS is a bit pricey though:

Canada Post Small Packet Air - $75
