Nice build, great job on the battery pack.  Let me know how you like the aluminum deck, I am building one now.

Nice grooves for the wheels. I assume you made them yourself. Is it for wet roads ?

The aluminum deck works well. Acts like a spring/dampening board as what I have expected.

The grooves should work well on wet roads but it picks up so much water that it was the worst design decision I made. I probably could increase the width of the channels to prevent the issue but cannot guarantee it will pick up water.
