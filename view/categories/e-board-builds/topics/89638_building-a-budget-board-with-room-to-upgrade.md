# Building A Budget Board, With Room To Upgrade

```
I am looking to start a build, inspired by al you guys. I'm pretty broke right now, so I would like it to start around $350ish and leave room for a future upgrade. Possibly starting with half battery power and doubling it later or adding a second motor? I want to not skimp out on the base parts that are needed in a higher quality build but im definitely willing to sacrifice some elements.

Deck: I have an old longboard thats 1080mm, with 230 mm wide trucks, using those would save me nearly $100, so thats a start, would the rest of this build work with those specs?

Wheels / Bearings:
 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012WNIU8G?m=A2DQMI7AS28KLN&amp;ref_=v_sp_detail_page

Maybe ill splurge on some Orangatangs depending on my budget at the end of this.

ESC / Remote: Need recommendations, or a VESC? Depending on the cost

C6374 Motor:

Batteries: This is my biggest complication,

https://eu.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/samsung-inr-18650-30q-3000mah.html

Something like this, but I would get half the amount now and could I later add more for more power / range? Im not experienced much in batteries definitely open to suggestions, I would like to keep it cheap now and later on upgrade it? I am willing to solder them together if it reduces cost.


Mount / Belts: https://www.ebay.com/itm/DIY-electric-skateboard-parts-pulleys-and-motor-mount-kit-for-83-90-97MM-wheels/323277743059

Which one do you guys think is better?

Antispark - recommendations?

For case / enclosure Im going to try and find 3d printable enclosures or just use sandwich boxes.

Any help / recommendations is awesome. Im doing my best to learn as much as I can but its a big topic and I love having such a helpful community like this.

hello fellow forum member.
welcome to your new addiction :smiley:

a budget of 350 dollars is on the low side. You're going to end up spending more money anyway.

To give you good advice I need to know in what environment you live in, what you need the board to do etc.

I would get a Vesc, single motor from dicky and drive train from dicky too. 
batteries probably lipos since they're cheap. 
Don't get an anti spark, it's waste of money. use anti spark loopkey instead 


Most likely you won't be able to use your longboard truck.

Pacific northwest, wet, which is an issue. Relatively flat, no crazy hills, so I can sacrifice some torque for speed. I am also not above giving a few pushes to start off, especially if i plan on upgrading to another motor later which would give more torque.

Board is for minor transportation / pleasure. Nothing more then a few miles, and I know if I keep it cheap ill be lucky to get that.
```

Okay

I would suggest. 

Use the old longboard 
Get Paris clones from dicky 
used Vesc from forum members here
full drive train + motor from dicky. Wheels from dicky (have not tested them, I just say this cause it's better to get everything from 1 place) 
batteries: Probably 10s lipos (wait for hobbyking sale) to be on the safe side. I mean 12 is cool and definitely fun but... I heard it can be unreliable especially with a cheap Vesc. 

and I think that was it

make sure to order all the small things on Ali, very cheap but the shipping times are crazy... üò¢üòÇ

happy building!

dont use that shit mount from amazon, get a @Boardnamics or a @dickyho mount, both are good

and for antispark get a loop key, its the cheapest option at around 5$ and it wont fail

I have 2 questions I am embarrassed to ask, both show how new I am.

In every build tutorial I've watched, they haven't had a single drive train, is it a separate install with the belt motor? I used to repair RC's so I should have a better idea about this :confused:

Also you keep saying Dickys, I haven't been able to find a website called Dicky's selling skate parts?

What kind of battery would I need for this? This seems like a good deal for trucks motor belt / pulley and wheels.

Tho the motor is small, but does it make up for it being 2 of them?

Agreed, just go 10S from the start. 

Also, I wouldn't solder cells themselves so if your looking to DIY, look into spot welding. I got the MinispotA, which is great if you're working relatively slow, and $60 ain't bad, but take into account the battery, charger, your looking at $110 shipped for everything. Then battery supplies... Even then, I feel like a spot welder with all the supplies you need, cells, etc still comes out to be as expensive if not cheaper than buying a quality pack pre-made. After the initial materials and welder investment, building additional batteries yourself is significantly cheaper. But **do your research**. Lots of little safety things to take into account if your trying to build your own battery.

I know you never should. I've done it on my 12S3P pack tho' since I've done a lot of soldering before and knew I could make it quick. It didn't hurt the cells much at all, but it took a LOT of preparation and flux to make it that quick. 

I would use a spot welder next time though!

If you have to do it, keep a piece of COLD aluminum nearby to press on the cells and suck the heat out of the end.  And don't short the cells doing it.  And don't reuse the same piece unless it's cold again.

;-)

But don't solder to cells at all.

Batteries:
Open to suggestions, I have a spot welder so I need batteries, nickel, as well as the wrappings? Fishtape / kapton tape to be insulated and put together? And on top of that, there's a ton of topics in this sub about this, what would you recommend as an in depth guide to a first time spot welding DIY battery job?

25R batteries?

I'd steer clear personally. 30Q have more capacity and can output 20A just fine, like the 25Rs, but 25Rs sag a lot. Under 20A load per cell, my 10S4P pack sags like 8-9v on average. 

My next build I'm going with VTC5a, similar capacity to 25R, and they are rated for 35A or 25A depending on who's testing them, and at 20A per cell the sag is super minimal. [And they are super cheap on nkon right now.](https://ru.nkon.nl/sony-us18650vtc5a-flat-top.html)

But, 30Q is pretty much the standard, I'd recommend those over 25R for sure.

Yep, 10S2P. And 70 battery amps with those cells is super respectable for 2P... Just don't expect a crap ton of range with a 2P config.

If you go 30Q, that would be 40 battery amps for 10S2P, but you will get better range. If you want range over torque, go 30Q... If you want torque over range, VTC5A. [There's also these, better than VTC5A even, ](https://www.imrbatteries.com/oem-p26a-18650-2600mah-25a-battery/?mc_cid=bc1976dcbf&mc_eid=e052873e92) and they were on sale for $1.99 a piece!

Double those range numbers for 4P. You can see torque ratings in there, I'd mess around with it for a bit till you settle on what you think you want out of this build. Those numbers are fairly conservative too, probably closer to charging up hills, stopping constantly and accelerating a lot under full power. You can hypermile and double your range easy, but on low power settings, crawling around, etc.

And if you are still confused about series vs parallel, [this article is pretty good.](https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/serial_and_parallel_battery_configurations)

Hypermile, basically ride really easy, tuck in an aerodynamic stance, try to Regen as much power when it makes sense, limit max power output... Just trying all the things to get the absolute maximum range out of your battery as possible.

so if I have dual 5065's and a 10s4p, what would you think my torque / speed / range would be? The calculator doesnt seem to have a setting for dual motors. And does two motors compensate for the fact that the motors are smaller 5065's? Sorry for my bad understanding, complex topic.

Always good to meet other builders in the area, there's a small but growing number of us in Portland. Hit us up, I'm amidst a few builds during the rainy week
