Thought i'd put up my build as well, the more the merrier right?
So the basic features are your standard dual rear drive, space cell powered r-spec machine, nothing really out of the ordinary.

Mounted both VESCs to a sheet so they won't move around.

Got all the components except for some JST connectors for the nunchuck and canbus connections, doubt they'll arrive before the snow hits, seeing as it's started in sothern and northern Sweden last night. Blah

So until they arrive i'm working on the enclosure, making it from sheets of polystyrene.

Cut a path for the motor wires through a riser pad to get them running between the truck and board.

Preliminary fitting of the lid, so far so good.
Gonna be painted green to match the trucks.
Might paint the motor mounts green as well, but will have to see how it looks before.

Cool idea running the wires that way. Are they snug in there? Or they got a little play?

They're snug, what's left of the riser pad got compressed when i tightened the bolts.
Will propably make a new riser out of some more rigid material in the future, but for proof of concept it works for now.
Made sure there's enough play on the cables so as to not get pulled on too much in a tight turn, so should't be a problem.

Actually the VESC with the USB Port with the **Blue Dot** on it is factory programmed as the master. So in BLDC tool you can connect to the slave VESC, via canbus, and setup the configuration parameters for the slave without ever connecting usb to it.

ALSO, it's actually already programmed with the R-SPEC motor parameters... technically that last batch of enertion VESC was plug & play with R-SPEC motors.

So in theory once you connect the two CANbus wires to the slave VESC you will never need access to that 2nd USB port.

No problems with that, one is set higher than the other as to not block the usb port., worst case i just loosen 3 nuts and bring it up a bit further.

Yea, i've read that, so i bent the pins up and hotglued everything that moved, so should't run into that.
And the vescs are mounted with 3 bolts each onto a board, so they won't move anywhere either.

Got the sheets from a local craftsshop, they also had some thin metal sheets, but to bend metal requires tools i don't have.
For the plastic sheets i just use a heatgun at low heat and use a little throw-together rig to get straight bends.
I can post up some pics later today for anyone that's interested.

I used some rubber bushings for silencing harddrives i had left over from a PC build for setting the height. Used some M3 screws as mounting poles.

Awesome! Very clever boring out the truck risers. That's almost as effective and way less time consuming than my way of doing it which involves dremels, fumes, and occasional swearing. Not that i mind swearing. 

This gives me a great idea for a product, actually... and i really wish i didn't suck so hard at CAD.

Thanks @Iceni it's great to see a visual of how this is done. [Does this][1] look like the stuff you found at your local shop? If so, I'm impressed that you're able to get it to 350F with a heat gun! 

Could you comment on the thickness that you used?

Seems like, i use 2mm thick sheets for the parts closest to the board, 1.5mm for the lid.
Not sure what that equates to in inches though.

The heatgun i use can go all the way up to around 600'c, which is around 1100'f
It has variable temperature from 80'c to 600, which is nice. And pretty expensive. But well worth it.

Yeah i was about to say I have a DeWalt heat gun from a local store that will melt your face off. I've used it to bend all kinds of things, peel paint off of walls in single wall-sized sheets, dry fresh paint on a board, heat shrink tubing,  and it will set things on fire when turned up all the way. Damned hot is what i would say since I don't know how hot it actually gets.

Mounted them on a piece of scrap plastic sheet i had left from making the enclosure.
The vesc has 4 mounting holes in the pcb, though i only used 3 of them, since one is located under the PCM connector.
The screws i used are regular M3 machinescrews, about 3 cm long, could use 2.5cm longscrews and still have enough clearance to access both usb ports.
And some rubber grommets to adjust height and making sure i don't short anything out when screwing on the nuts, noticed that the motor lead mounts would get shorted if i just screwed them on withough insulation.

After a bit of prodding around with my trusty multimeter i found two pins on one of the big chips that was bridged together by some stray solder.
Took a knife to it and lo and behold, it now works the way it should!

Not sure if all four pins on the canbus should be used, the guide says to connect the two middle ones, but doesn't say not to use the other two. If they shouldn't be connected, could someone please let me know?

For the nunchuck connector i used a breakout board so i won't need to disassemble the wireless dongle for testing.
Though it doesn't seem to work with the MadCatz Z-chuk, so i had to solder the wires directly to the dongle anyway, which didn't work either, so i guess it just isn't compatible.
The status led on the dongle only gives off a reeeeally dim blinking.
Tried with a wired nunchuck as well, no dice.
So another question: Anyone tried a wired one before?

DO NOT connect 5v and GND because that is likely to cause ground loops which can reset and/or kill the VESCs. Just use the middle ones only for the CAN bus connection.

Frankly I've been seeing too many pictures of shoddy quality VESC assemblies.

Yes, from enertion.
Though from what i've seen, enertion has been good about trying to get them fixed if something is broken.
And I guess i was lucky it was as simple as a solderbridge that just needed cutting, hopefully it didn't cause any permanent damage.

While fiddling with the cover i found out the bends i made were too brittle and would propably break.
So used some aluminium brackets i had from an old project.
The frame is a single length of aluminium, just cut pieces of one side to make two 90' bends, so it should be sturdy enough.

Glued the plates to the inside of the brackets, will put a few bolts or rivets when the glue has hardened.

So i got a rivet tool earlier today and finished up most of the case, decided to scrap the formed plastic altogether and go for aluminium sides on both the base and the cover.

The cover will be mounted on hinges so it'll be just two locking screws at the other end propably.
Might use a rod through the whole case though.

The plan was to paint it metallic green, but that was before the alu sides, now i'm not so sure.. Might keep the alu look and just put a coat of black on the plastic part, as it is now it's not the prettiest when looking at it close up.

Nothing special, just some basic hinges from the hardwarestore, did have to cut one side of them in half and drill a few new holes in them, but otherwise just your standard cheap-o hinges.

Hmm, why didn't I think of that? That might have actually been easier :stuck_out_tongue:
Still, the hinge is working really well, working on the locking screws on the other side atm, waiting for some epoxy to harden.
Two screws to hold the lid closed isn't so bad after all.

Small update, did some final touches on the enclosure, drilled holes for the charging port, power switch and battery indicator.
Added a rubber seal over the hole for the powerbutton.
Still need to find a good way to seal up the charging port, might make a plug out of oogoo.
And the last thing to add is a transparent sheet over the battery indicator.

Oh, and cover up the holes left over from when i cut off like half of the transmitter.
Did i mention i bought a 2.4ghz transmitter? :stuck_out_tongue:
Not quite as slim as the gt2b, but good enough.

Can put up some more when i've sanded down the edges and fixed the powebutton, as it is now it's not exactly the best solution.

Did integrate a rechargeble battery with charging circuit into the case too, no idea what the batterylife ends up at.

Controller is all done, changed the power button from a push-button to a slide switch.

Managed to make the edges pretty smooth with some plastic putty andsandpaper.
Covered it all up with a coat of matte black paint.

The pcb holding all the knobs on the top was really wide, so decided to just keep most of the case intact.

Never took a before photo, but found one on the store i bought it from:

Funny story, I just got a note from the postal service today saying i had a package to collect that arrived on December 15, so now i have a nyko kama as well as the modded 2.4GHz controller.
GG Well played Postnord..

Did a quick benchtest and it works without a hitch.
Now to wait for the damn snow to go away so i can do some real testing..

@Iceni the Nunchuck w VESC is my favorite controller setup so far; keep a close eye on it at first for dropouts and make sure the wiring and signal are solid before you take it up to max speed.

Will make the wiring bulletproof and keep an eye out when the time comes.

Until then i might make some minor cosmetic changes to the enclosure just to keep me ocupied.
Gonna switch out the black plastic sheets on the lid to a single one, it bugs me that they're not completely in line :P

Working on version two of the enclosure atm.
Cracked open the space cell to move the chargeport, powerbutton and display to another spot.
Need to get some extra wire to extend the charging leads.
Will propably get a water resistant powerswitch as well. Not sure if the original is.
And propably another chargeport as well.

Quick draft of the layout.
Button, charge port and display will end up on the short side facing backward to keep the bottom of the case clean.

First shakedown run ended with three things to fix:
-Loose screw on one motor mount.
-Loose set screw on one motor pulley.
-One loose ESC, no big deal, pretty cramped in the box so it couldn't move around even if it wanted to.

And another thing I found out when I tried to charge it was that I soldered the negative charge lead to the wrong pin on the plug, oops.

I'm thinking I need to buy a new bottle of thread locker.. The one I have is going on 10 years now.

I let it drip dry over night, then just dabbed it with a paper towel to get the leftover blobs off.

And it's been drying all day today as well, was still semi wet in the morning, I'll give you an update when I get home.

Went for a run to get some food, and that damn motor mount shook loose, again!
Guess I'll have to clean it out more thoroughly this time.

So after a run of about 9km (5.5 miles) everything held up nicely, finally!
Only thing is that there seems to be a problem with one of the motors, but that's for another thread.
And i'm gonna switch out the nunchuck to my modded rc controller, since i'm riding rightfoot forward and holding the controller in my right hand the signal drops as soon as i put my body between it and the reciever.

Apart from that, maaan, this thing is awesome!

Love your enclosure! Very clean build man..I want to do something similar, that would fit a 12s pack @ 18.25 x 6 x 1, plus two VESC's. Trying to get an idea of how big it needs to be, and figure out what deck I will need to buy in turn. Would a pack that size still fit this enclosure with the two vesc's?

My enclosure is a pretty tight fit as is with the components I have.
To fit your planned battery it needs to be around 2.5" longer.
If you plan to use the same layout inside it needs to be around 25" long minimum.
And the distance between the trucks would need to be around 34" with a traditional belt drive.
Maybe a couple inches shorter if you forego the hinge mechanism in the front.

Great, thanks for the info! I will be using dual hub motors so I should have a little less space taken up by those, though I don't know exactly how much. Just looking for a rough idea so I can buy the proper deck once Psychotiller comes up with an enclosure for me.

Not yet, but I've sealed it as good as I can, so until I can test it I'd say it's puddle proof at least.
And I've waterproofed the electronics with CorrosionX, so even if it takes in some water it shouldn't really matter. Hopefully.

You should if you plan to run it in wet conditions.

Damn..I was just mentioning in my thread how wet it can get here and how I want to ride every day. Ordering a can now! That should help. I also plan to do a similar encasement as you, but with a custom enclosure from Psychotiller. I was thinking of laying down a thin sheet of rubber (neoprene?) and then monthing everything to that, cutting the edge to sit perfectly inside the case and then cutting a small channel for a gasket around that to seal in the flats of the enclosure. I think with that setup and some of that spray I should be good. Did you just dip all your connections, or did you spray it right on everything lightly?

Oh yea, just read that as well :p
I just dropped the electronics in a can of it letting it soak for a few minutes.
I'd suggest doing it in a well ventilated room, preferably far away from where you live, it's gonna stink something awful :p
And it will take a few days for it dry enough to handle afterwards.
Don't necessarily have to dip the connectors, but people say it doesn't hurt.
Oh, and you'll never ever ever ever ever be able to glue something on to anything you've treated :p

Hot glue is incredibly useful for securing and connection.....I know many people use it to insulate/isolate VESC pins and soldered pieces. Sounds like with the electronics proofing you just want to double check that what you got is nailed down as solid as possible before taking it for the swim in the goo.

This is how i fasten my vescs, the bottom of the enclosure is sheets of polystyrene, which made it really easy to build the raised platforms.
Using scraps left over i just glued them together using smaller pieces between the plate and the bottom to get some room for the velcro to go under.
Polystyrene and glue for plastic models works really great, melts the parts together creating a permanent bond.

After that minor setback it's now back on the road with a freshly wound motor (and sore thumbs on my end)
Unfortunatly it's only gonna be a single motor for a while.
When the motor shorted out it seems to have damaged the vesc as well, is getting a drv error when trying to run the motor now.
Luckily the second vesc still works fine, so that's something.

Gotta find someone that can replace the dead chip in sweden.

Still, it runs fine enough on one motor, but i miss the crazy acceleration of the duals.

So after about a 5 mile testrun it didn't run as fast as i expected, so it got me thinking, never thought about the original wind being delta.
So after some more calculations it made a whole lot more sense.
I terminated my winding as star, so i's approx 140 kv instead of 240 as i thought, which seems to be correct according to my top speed test and using the gearing calculator.

Oh well, 30km/h is still good enough for getting to know the board properly.
WIth duals i should be able to switch to a bigger motor pulley without problems for a bit more speed.
