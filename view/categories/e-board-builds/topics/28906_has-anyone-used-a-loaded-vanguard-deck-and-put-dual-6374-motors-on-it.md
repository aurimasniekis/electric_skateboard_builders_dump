Space will be tight if you use regular caliber trucks with dual 6374s on the same truck. Best option is either getting the extended trucks from TorqueBoards or diagonally placing the motors

I've not actively looked on DIY's website, but the fact you can mount 2x 6374 motors is crazy, the power you'll have!!

With the 218mm trucks and 15mm pulleys and 6374 motors, does it fit?

I am thinking about making my board (in progress) dual rear 6374. I got the 218mm trucks.
