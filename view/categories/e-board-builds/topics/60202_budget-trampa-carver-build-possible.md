Hi Everyone,

I'm really considering going the DIY route for my second Eboard I've never DIYed before but have been browsing the forum and the Esk8 reddit so I know this will be a monumental task but I'm willing to give it a try. I know I want an E-MTB similar to a Kaly and to what alot of the other builders like @okp or @Nowind are making which are beautiful pieces of work. I unfortunately have a small budget and would like to know if this is possible and where I can even begin to realize this custom build of mine.

I know I want:

1. A customizable setup that I can switch wheel sizes 7"-9" depending on where I want to take the board.
2. A Belt drive that I can eventually switch to a gear drive system.
3. A 2 in 1 that I can go from the primary AT setup to a street setup that can do 97mm+ Street wheels or Gummies.
4. Decent water resistance. Enough to go through damp roads or small puddles.
5. Regenerative breaking


Thats more or less the things I would like to have. As for performance, I don't need the highest top speed or steepest hill climbing, just something that I can take and ride anywhere and have the best carving riding experience with. My largest constraint is my budget and would like to know if this is possible to achieve with $1000-$1500 the lower the better but without sacrificing safety of course in terms of the quality of components. I would love to share the experience of building an awesome board and be proud of the effort that you put in for it.

Edit:
Updated the title to better reflect the needs of the build.
Thank you for the feedback. Love this forum
Cheers!

So I am also planning a similar type of board, but some of the other items that are going to help dictate this are:

How far do you need/want to go?  Batteries are expensive but it is almost worse to run out when you are 2/3s through your run. Adequately size the system and that will help. 

Edit: Also, if you are TIGHT on a budget, you can also go LiPo over Lion.  They will likely sag, but they can save you ~200 on your build if you disconnect them each ride and balance charge them each time.  Look at some 6s1p's and wire them in series to get ya to 12s.

How fast?  KV and size of motors matter.  Getting 6383's are far more $$ than 6360's or however.  

Otherwise, I would stick to looking at the used market for boards, mounts, trucks, etc.  Also LaCoix (LaCroix?) sells their wheels at cost, that itself could save you $50-100.

IMO..
The only real way to save a few bucks is to get a bargain on a second hand "Trampa" or MBS" board, but still you will more than likely hit or go over that 1500 on a Trampa 18650 battery Gummies and pneumatics setup, unless you can get cheap/secondhand parts on the Esk8 marketplace or have some parts/tools/safety gear already.

What you want is quite top end so its going to be hard sticking to a budget but can be done.

Thanks for the input! Sadly, I don't have any parts/tools on hand at the moment :frowning: Do you mean just getting the board, batteries and wheels will already set me up for $1500+? I  could actually go for something less but at least have the core components to build on to get the full potential out of what I'd like to have.

Big Air wheels are expensive and if they're not there probably high maintenance.

A normal deck with some flex rubber risers high quailty bushings good big urathine wheels,
Would give a nice ride at your budget.

You see big air wheels, have downsides and unless your loaded it's just not worth it.

I see. I haven’t seen alot of posts about air wheel maintenance to be honest which is why it never occurred to me to consider it. Would 97mm or above help out with smoothening out a ride over really rough cement roads? Are there any pros on using airless types of tires as well?

Well cheap would be aluminum or 3d printer parts, and they ware out so, High maintenance. 
Or an unbalanced hub or something you need to keep adjusting, that's what was in my mind when i said it.


Air tyres are less efficient and you can run a flat.
But you don't have to worry about bumps so much, and it absorbs vibrations better.

Wow okay air tyres have a lot of other things to take ito consideration as well. I went straight for them because using 90mm street wheels on my roads still hurt alot and cause my feet to cramp up so I wanted to dampen the ride or reduce the vibrations as much as possible. Starting to have second thoughts about it given the amount of care and consideration when running pneumatics now

You should get used to the vibrations, Maybe @b264 could give some input.

what are your roads like?
and are you running basic 90mm abec clones?
do you have a rubber riser between your Trucks and deck?
are you running cheap Chinese trucks with stock bushings?

That’s unfortunate :( I don’t have a “workshop” that’s got similar tools that some builders use. I didn’t think the costing of just the basic equipment would already set me back a fair amount. 

Would it be possible to go with street wheels that can reduce road vibrations to a tolerable level? I’ve run 90mm street wheels with hubs on rough cement roads in my area and I can feel my feet cramping, my front foot first then eventually my back foot from the vibrations. It’s limiting my rides so much that I can’t really maximize the range of my board

Roads are rough cement. The kind with patches of the sediment/rock in the asphalt making it very uneven. Yes I believe they are basic 90mm clones. It’s my first eboard, Ownboard w1 cause I wanted to know if eboarding was something I would like before I spend on something more serious which leads me to my current dilemma  now haha

My board with a stiff 9ply deck with basic Chinese clone wheels,
Has less vibrations than a wowgo with a flexy deck, hubmotors make more vibrations.

I've upgraded my back wheels from a Chinese abec clone too these ones and my ride became even smoother.

I understand that pneumies are a nicer ride than Urethanes.
Unless you have a quality alternative to Trampa, It's going to cost to much for some.

I’ve been considering just doing this as well. Could you recommend a belt or similar that I can use to swap the hubs with so I can use those wheels? I know Ownboard is in the process of producing an AT motor hub though going DIY is going to be worth the experience even if I don’t build it from the ground up :

That’s true though I’m open to trying to DIY something in the future or get a custom complete build like from Kaly in the distant future and upgrade it from there. One of the reasons I’m open to getting DIY exposure even if its not a whole lot at the moment

Yeah. I’ll probably go back to this in a future build but maybe work around the Chinese board for now. Would replacing Hubs into a belt usually call for a need to change out the ESC as well? Do you have a build log for your 9ply Chinese board?

Good question - im currently debating an emtb as well. But i was really suprised at how much more expensive all the parts are 

I already have both vescs, both motors, and the battery cells and every price list i write down still comes out to well over $1000 (with new parts) 

Id wait for people to sell their used parts on here 

Btw, anyone have an hs11 deck they no longer want?????

Just need clearance for the tires.. Most downhill with the nose and tail portion of the deck ideally would be smaller. @treenutter decks will most definitely work. https://www.instagram.com/redemberboards/ and decks somewhat similar..

i usually throw the lists away before i start a spending spree but theyre usually something like: 

Hs11 trampa deck 

12s8p eboosted enclosure 

The direct drive options are sick but way expensive so i was thinking of using chains instead 

Dual 6374 motors 

Not 100% positive about the wheels or trucks yet but but if you want trampa ones your expenses go way up. There are probably other options out there but i dont know about them yet

Hardly any, prob about 50miles. This board was quite a long build and during that time I got a mountainboard and had that build done in a day. My plan was to have both but I’ve kind of seen sense a bit and now know I just need one, I got addicted yes. It’s all in great condition. I also have a 12s bms (bypassed discharge) and can throw nickel in the box too. All you would need is cells/battery pack. 

You can find second hand trampas. They just don’t come up very often. I keep my eye out for them and if I get any I shall let you know 👍🏻

Also search ‘scrub mountainboard’ and look for the similar square trucks, that could lead to a nice budget board.

That would be fantastic. Thanks for the help, I suppose what I really would want given the responses here and a few on the subreddit is more along the lines of an Urban assault setup that can go over gravel, grass and bad roads but not through forests or mountains. I see that they've got a Ultimate Urban Carver on the Trampa site but would not sure if that would be enough or already beyond what I really need for my use case.

I am not an expert in this matter but for me the difference between both are (although this is not always the case) difference in decks (carver = shorter and lighter but this is not always true) , due to the fact that the purpose is totally different , wheels , gearing and motor kv can also differ. Battery placement also differ , for emtb's most will put the battery on top of the deck for carver builds most use flexible battery enclosures attached on the underside of the deck. Also , most will use bindings on their mountainboards (for additional stability) which isn't the case (most of the time) on carver builds.These are the differences i can think of but more experienced forum members might provide you with a better answer.
```

## \#48 Posted by: atenner Posted at: 2018-06-28T16:57:43.588Z Reads: 85

As above ☝🏻

Biggest difference is the trucks and wheels. Smaller wheels are (usually) used on an urban carver. The carver comes with a narrower hanger on the trucks. 

If you want to go on gravel paths and on bumpy pavements only a carver or mountainboard will be ok. If you want to go more off-road like through forests etc a mountain board is the one. 

Ideally have a go on someone’s. For example I love having bindings but some people hate them.

Thanks for the info @mikedv and @atenner! Yes I think I think I've got a better idea of what i really need for my use case. I think I should've went with carver because they can be a bit different for me to tell apart at times. I don't see myself going through forests but giong up hills, be it grass or pavement is something I'd love to be able to do. Since @mikedv did mention differences in carvers being shorter and lighter does this still put the budget at around $2000+? 

I'd imagine still having a higher Kv motor since I won't need all to much torque on the surfaces I'll be going over on it. As for gearing I'm looking at a belt but I'd ultimately want to go for gear drive but defenitely a underside enclosure which may cost more? I've seen lots of great posts on @psychotiller enclosures. I myself am not concerned too much on bindings as I can always add these later on

For an urban carver what would the minimum I could go if I go with LiPos? Sk3's I hear are quite good for the price but I'm still unsure about what size and KV would best fit my needs. (going up hills,grass,gravel and rough pavement)
