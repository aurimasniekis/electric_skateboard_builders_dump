Hi everyone

So a little about me, I live in the UK and have been riding electric longboards since May this year.  I had an I wonder SK-D and I have to say it was a pretty reliable board, it used to get me 10 miles on a charge and I have used it to death since I got it.  I work away quite a lot and use it to get between whatever site I am working at and my hotel - I have often been seen riding with my rucksack on and my flightcase in my one hand and remote in the other! Anyways, the battery started bulging on that one so I decided to pull it apart and bin the Lipo, I was planning on recycling the rest but have had so many ideas about a DIY thanks to my friend @egzplicit building a monster recently and making me salivate at the thought that I decided to buy all new everything.

My initial thought was to build using my Loaded Icarus, then I changed my mind and was going to build a boosted clone with a vanguard but once I got the 218mm TB trucks in my hand I knew they would be too big for that so I have gone back to the Icarus idea, will be a 10S4P setup with some 6355's so should be a lot quicker than my old board and thus I will name it the Sicarus!

I have made a start, here is my Icarus

I have bought the enclosures from @Eboosted, they are great quality!

I have many other parts waiting as well, 3 fet antispark from @eLDoska and a bluetooth module (can't remember where from but works with the Metr IOS app)

I have 2 x Focbox and nano X still "awaiting fulfilment" from the cyber monday sale.  My pulleys should be here in the next 7-10 days but I still have to order the BMS (waiting to see if the group buy on here comes to anything) and I still need to order 40 Samsung 30Q's

The next stage is to work out how I seal the enclosures against the curvyness of the board, maybe some neoprene foam that will compress easy but is waterproof? I can sand the enclosures down slightly to help fit but I don't want to go too far as I believe 10S4P is tight as it is from what I have seen on here.

Oh I forgot to add, I also have these 110mm 85A Slick Revolution off road wheels, I think it looks nuts on them, would have to take the risers off though as its so high with these on ( I may even be able to run the board drop through on these too!)

I hope these ride soft enough, they are deffo harder than the flywheels

Either way, no point in adjusting any more until I get the pulleys as I know those motor mounts are going to need to move inwards so I will check clearance one I have them and decide whether I can run drop through or not, I do dearly hope I can.

a lot lower to ground in drop through but have to have the motors at the back so they do not hit anything.

What do you think? Are the motors too close to the ground?

On drop through with them facing forward they bite into the deck even on the angle they are like the pics above but facing inward.

I think I have the answer, and it involves the crimes of using a hacksaw and sandpaper....

So, after various tests and messing around I do not think I can run this drop through so have committed to going top mount.

I had a look at the enclosures I got from @Eboosted today.  They are made for a loaded vanguard so do not quite fit the complex curves of the Icarus

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/5/d5297d7bacd7808c4856f106285cbb2997e6ca12.JPG" width="666" height="500">

I taped some sandpaper to the underside of the deck and got rubbing the enclosures against where they will sit and after 20 mins or so...

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/9/b926158a46b6186c9545a4f59ef758bccf9c054b.JPG" width="666" height="500">

I didn't want to go too far as I know 10S4P is a squeeze in this enclosure.  I have ordered some adhesive backed neoprene sheet to make some gaskets which should take care of the gap.

Then it was a case of drilling the enclosures and getting them attached to the deck. This was a bit scary as this is a Â£180 deck!!!!.  It went well, but I used skateboard hardware screws so I am 2 short.  They have been ordered - I also need to cut these down as they are rather long.

And now it looks a bit like this

The build did come out clean with the enclosures. It's a shame, you weren't able to run drop through due to the motors. 

Looks great. PS, those MBS wheels shaved down...are ð. I'd suggest shaving them for that good stickyness

Rough Stuff... Either way... Shaved down they're wide and grippy... The treads don't lend themselves to much to road riding...but shaved make great big offset wheels for a wide stance and grip.

with those trucks, and those bushings, if you ever feel like they're kind of falling over when leaning, consider an insert bushing instead.

the insert fills an inherent gap between the kingpin and hangar. anyway, I was riding on the nipple bushings for a bit, then switched to blood orange insert barrel bushing and it's a huge improvement.

Following this closely - looks amazing! I'm planning to electrify my Icarus with a similar setup. 

I've bought some cork handle-bar tape to cover the enclosures to mimic the deck. Think I'll try to find an artist to copy the pattern and varnish as per the stock finish...

@Deckoz yeah it is a shame I can't run drop through.  Actually quite devastated by it but had two issues.  One is if you have the motors facing backwards they will touch the kick tails of the board.  I thought about chopping them down but I was worried about the structural integrity of the deck as it has a load of torsional strength.  As well as that I found the motors to be touching the baseplate of the truck.  With the TB mounts you do not get the option of adjusting the angle from straight back to 45 degrees up due to the design.  

@GrecoMan is correct, these are rough stuff wheels by a company called slick revolution based in the UK.  They feel like they are going to be pretty bad as they are to be honest, maybe I will shave them.  They just look really nice so they are on for now.

@Caleb1 hmm didn't want to divulge that yet but here it is - Â£1107.85.  That does not include the price of the deck and wheels as I already owned them.  I will give the real total at the end of the build.

@thisguyhere Thanks for the tip bro, I noticed these trucks want to turn easier so may have to invest in those

 @Grozniy Thanks man, aparently I have the ESC enclosure backwards but thats the way it fit best on the Icarus.  I have bought 5mm but it is available on ebay up to 15mm 

@Sibbo  Thanks man, yeah ts looking good if I may say so myself! Thats a great idea about the cork tape, will be interested to see how it ends up.

-------------------------

So I took everything apart 2 days ago and drilled the board for the large wires to be inlaid in between. Now I have to hold my hands up and say I have made my first mistake, I was rushing and never drilled accurate so when I gave it to my guy to chisel out he has done one slightly at an angle :( its not too bad as you won't see it but I am annoyed with myself.

So I need to find out what the best thing to fill these channels is on a flexible deck.  Anyone got any ideas?

@deckoz thanks for the suggestion mate.  I have been doing some research and I have found some flexible epoxy which I think will do the job just fine

So last night my 15mm pulley kit arrived from my friend @egzplicit.  We bought two sets from @johnny_261 so one for me and one for him.  I have to say the kit is excellent quality and I fitted it straight away.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/1/b1bab4a7975df2090934c9f63dfed9487001e9ad.jpg" width="690" height="460">

 Unfortunately the pulley is too long for the eskating.eu motor shafts so there is a bit of an overhang.  
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/4/246f55cb96b4381f81620f10b294ce708be77452.jpg" width="690" height="460">
I am not worried though as there are two grub screws holding it on and I will bond them on after fitting the woodruff key.

Looks good back on the ABEC's

Also my adhesive backed neoprene sheet (5mm) arrived so I can make the enclosure gaskets.

Next jobs are to make the gaskets, wire the channels when I get the board back on tuesday and fill them with epoxy.  Then I am onto wiring up the ESC enclosure which is a bit of an issue because Enertion look like they are never going to ship the FOCBOX's and Nano X I ordered **NEARLY 6 WEEKS AGO**  I also need to buy some washers as I need to space the wheel out 1mm or 2 to allow for the retaining lip on the motor pulley.

So I may come to a bit on an impasse shortly unless I buy yet more ESC's and remote and charge back my CC to Enertion.  Not sure what to do yet. I do not want to do the battery until last but I have ordered the BMS from @Acido in the group buy he just made.

Also does anyone know of anyone 3D printing motor pulley covers for the TB mounts? Would be great to get some

Looking good man

I only suggested silicon as it makes for easy removal, should you ever decide to turn the board back into an analog and restore it as the flex pattern breaks in over time.

Keep it up :)

Ok minor update.

I have purchased 2 more focbox because of this whole Enertion cyber monday fiasco.  Im really annoyed about it but I canât hang around anymore so have had to spend out again.  I will never order anything from Enertion again.  Thanks to my mate @egzplicit for offering to lend me his spare remote too - legend. 

I am also ordering 2 of those cool X plates from @akhlut as I want to dress the top side of the board and I am also working on a cool griptape design to tie the top in.

More coming soon.

That's correct however if you have a short or loose conexion the sparks would inmediately light up the fire on the foam, it won't combust by temperature but because of sparks.

Being that said, I'm using this foam again on my latest build, just try to avoid the use of bullet connectors in power lines, use XT60 or XT90 instead

I bought a harnes from UNIK to power both VESC's but it is too long and wired incorectly!!!

![IMG_3699|666x500](upload://Aq1veTd6U9QKxtUqmqsmOu2GlGg.JPG)

Not the best solder joints I have ever seen and would of been a nasty bang had I plugged it into a battery as it had a red wire going to a + on one plug and a negative on the other..... slow clap for UNIK!!!! I have made it a lot shorter and soldered it as it should be

At least both Focbox fit in the enclosure (just) I hope with the cables in the top it won't make it harder - the dual lock really adds height to the vesc's.... something else to think about

Got some more done on this last night, stayed late at work and cracked on.

After debating the best way to get the wires out of the ESC enclosure I decided to drill a series of holes, I will have to find a way to seal these up neatly, perhaps silicone sealant on the inside?
![E38A0B99-0837-4375-BA31-7882230D54E9|690x388](upload://3tOqJ9veYI6sExS3OzPsomnGakU.jpg)

I decided to take the plug off of the phase wires so I could route them through then reattach

![IMG_3710|666x500](upload://6Ldyq4P2BIqveeD5hkx7vy9IuzD.JPG)
![IMG_3711|666x500](upload://d7uvzrgjbYgFviDDPC8bPAlnjdl.JPG)

Then Extend the phase wires as they are too short and for some reason have tiny connetors on them

This is my plan for routing the wires

![IMG_3727|666x500](upload://pT0Y2OeFnfZD79AFmZscRttE3fc.JPG)

These will be inside nylon braid sleeves and I have ordered some of those X shaped plates from @akhlut that will tidy/hide these wires nicely!

Also my BMS and cells are here (forgot to take a picture of the cells!) Thanks to @Acido for sorting the BMS group buy out.

I snatched a couple of hours after work today to do a few things.  Got the Bluetooth module in, shortened the phase wires and got some nylon braid on them.  Also put the wires in the channels and a bit of silicone sealant right at both ends to stop the resin seeping through and I will put the resin in on Monday.

Next jobs are make a gasket and get the on/off switch and charge port on the battery enclosure the. part wire the BMS up and I am ready to go to my friends house to use the spot welder for the battery.

Canât wait to get on this bloody thing, seems like forever since I have been on a board.  The weather is crap at the moment anyways but I want to be ready for when it gets nice.

those bushings suck for those trucks.

i used to use the exact same setup, hard nipples.

swapped out to insert barrels and it's a huge improvement:

went with 89a front, 92a rear. 

used to get wobbles all the time above 25mph with the stock bushings, virtually gone now. 

still carvy but can't take sharp turns at slow speeds. good enough compromise for me.

![IMG_3890|666x500](upload://a1lmxjzVUpfUXT8D23NnvGOjJk3.JPG)

more progress too, I got the wires glassed in - as you can see I managed to burn through one of the wires unfortunately :frowning: I have to do a bit more so hoping to cover it and re sand or just put some electrical tape over it before I grip.  
![IMG_3847|666x500](upload://ciMvXk9RzzY2VCMR6RpNCemK8FL.JPG)![IMG_3845|666x500](upload://uldOvkE4taL4k7oUudMqVl17YVG.JPG)

Also started wiring up inside the battery enclosure

Firs a test fit of the 40 cells, unfortutunatley the switch is far too big so I have taken the back off and soldered directly onto the pins.
![IMG_3858|666x500](upload://rWP0zK9HxyVQ5B5Ow5aty82bLFI.JPG)![IMG_3857|666x500](upload://8FKUt0Mkel41mW86fxEi9uPcntH.JPG)

I have also removed the fuse from the antispark and bridged the gap - I will put this in line somewhere else. Don't worry the BMS and Antispark will be heat wrapped

 ![IMG_3862|666x500](upload://oGvXYqlwQhEOolSO9yCKIeHUnys.JPG)

I have also received the grip tape and am just waiting for my second set of x plates from @akhlut as I gave him the wrong size :rofl: once I have these and I have finished the resin I will get the top finished

And thats it, been very busy the last few weeks but I can sense the weather tuning and im itching to get out on this thing - hoping to do the last push in the next couple of weeks.

sweet, the inserts make a huge difference.

you can play around with the road side bushing to dial it in, stiff or carvy, whatever your need is.

on my dual 6374 it's 92a insert barrel bushing board side, 89a barrel road side.  it's stable at speed and compliant enough to be carvy low speed.

on my mono 34" it's 89a insert barrel board side, 89a cone road side.  since it's not a very fast board don't need as much support at speed but super carvy low speed without wobbling at speed.

Hoping for a good mix of carving and stability, I am not expecting too much carve with the longer trucks - do you find them to be ok?

Ok time to update this thread.

It is almost complete! I had a pretty gnarly March at work (27 days worked in a row) which stopped me from doing anything massive but I did manage to finish the top of the board.  I got some pulley covers printed and sent all the way from Israel to the UK. and they have been installed.   I have fixed everything down and thread locked all the usual bolts and I am now waiting for my battery to be finished which should be this week.  I also got some blood orange insert bushings and fitted them board side and they make a massive difference to the way the TB 218mm trucks feel 

Here are a few shots to show where I am, should have this finished very very soon and I can go ride it - feels crazy spending this much cash on something without knowing what the end outcome will feel like - hope it doesn't ride like shit!

I have an X plate for the back but just need to get some longer bolts as I have to space it out a bit to go over the wires.

There is this thing called pushing! I just removed the belts and had a little push around the warehouse after I fitted them before loctiting everything down

The trucks have this weird lean thing if you donât have insert bushings, its hard to explain but its kind like you lean over on it and then it goes a bit more on its own? With the insert bushings that has gone.  I think its because the bushing seats are massive on these trucks and therefore the truck isnât located in a fixed place.

This happened today, but as I went to power up ESCâs for the first time I had an accident and fried my antispark! So close yet so far, now I canât make the group ride this weekend.  Looks like the ESCâs are ok though - the 60A fuse went bang big time.

Lesson learned folks, double check your wiring.

Also weighed the board, 8.9KG - not bad for a 30 mile board

Lets just say I am an idiot, for a electronics engineer I fucked up pretty bad.  Cross wired the +ve and -ve to the ESCâs.  The antispark took it like a champ though and saved the ESCâs but the fets are dead.

I am an idiot but this is why we have fuses I suppose.

I have moved the motors more towards the board now after they were taking a beating, also noticed I needed to move the motors further out as the belts have stretched a bit

Had a great day today, a little 10 mile slow cruise (dam tourists in the way) and got to shake the board down a bit.

Hey @BigBrit

Hey man. So I wanted to catch up with you now that you've had your deck built a while.

On my vanguard  I milled the cables, and after a while the board broke in, and the flex was performing like a higher flex.

Anyway have you noticed the Icarus getting more flexy over time? I'm debating not milling wires into the deck, and using  flat cables like boosted v1 under some loaded pushin cushion with an Icarus regrip kit on top the pushin cushion.

Hey man, should check in on your build.  Havent been around on here much.

I have about 100 miles on mine now and so far it feels the same.  I think the fibreglass in this board is really strong and it will be fine, saying that 100 miles isnât too much.

I thought about getting the poron for my board but decided against.  I will tell you what though this deck makes an AMAZING eboard - you are gonna love it mate

Well @Deckoz coming back to this I can tell you that the board has not changed properties in well over 500 miles.  I say 500 because I gave up counting and it could be as much as 700 now.

Im now running Orangatang Caguamas which are really nice and go with the board so well

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJikizgg7Nc&t=1s

I am making some changes to the board soon, including some 3d printed goodies.  Currently the board is on the bench with a poorly motor.

you can see a small update about it, and a sneak peak at my next eboard project in this video.

Hey bro no worries.

My main take away is they both dampen the ride in different ways.  The ABEC's are a very bouncy wheel which works very well and it was my favourite wheel until I tried the caguamas.  The Cags are more of a deadening type wheel, they take shock and absorb it and I think that makes them feel more accurate when you ride.  I think the Cags are actually softer than the ABEC's despite having a harder Duro rating.  If Otang make those in a 97mm they will probably be the perfect wheel for me.

So I put some new motors on the board this week, from 6355 to 6365 as I burned one of the 55's out after 700 miles or so. Its looking so good on the underside, I'm really happy with it and riding it this year has been amazing.  I'm going to 3d print some bits and bobs for it next to tidy a few things up and maybe make some custom lights.
