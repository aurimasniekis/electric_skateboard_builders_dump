So @3DServisas (my father) decided that he wants a Trampa board. As @3DServisas is busy working I will be maintaining this project log for him.  So this project log will be I think the cleanest project I have ever seen as almost all components will be built from scratch.

Some key features:

* Trampa 35º Holy Pro Deck
* Trampa Vertigo Trucks
* FatBoy SS 1:5 Gear Drive
* 9"/8" Wheels with FatBoy Solid Wheel Hubs
* 12S 10P 30Q 30Ah 150A Battery pack with custom CNC machined enclosure integrated BMS, FatBoy Mini Sparky Switch, Battery Gauge and etc
* Smart Rear lights, RGB string lights, Front Lights
* 2 x Enertion FocBox with custom waterproof enclosure 
* Enertion Nano-X

I will be posting all the pictures I receive for this build here.

So some Trampa parts arrived today:

It's not compression, its just enclosure, everything will be welded in old school way :) Just to make sure that cells stays in place are isolated and water proof :) About availability I don't really yet know :)

And the black piece is a gasket for a transparent lid?

Ahh now I understood :) VESC6 uses same mosfets as focbox so not much different power capabilities :) About the arc I don't really know yet anything plus its bit too expensive..

Also on my focboxes I am running ±90A Bat and it holds up well :) ESK8 doesnt see much constant loads so you get those high currents for several seconds max :)

Well FocBox are not bullet proof, some simple rules don't run CAN and disconnect one focbox from power :) if you using CAN and Y splitter for XT connectors zip tie them together so that unintentionally you will never unplug them. Grab our heatsink for better cooling :) that's basically all.

As this is pure off road board it will be using 9" tires with our FatBoy wheel hubs. They are much wider and uses ETA offset to push wheel outside :drooling_face: @banjaxxed

Hey @Kug3lis awsesome build man ..your stuff is awesome man..great job...I'm looking into building a mini Trumpa gear drive and your the only bad man that has a kit for it .. and I was also wondering if you have more of those red cases for a mini kit...RED LOVE IT....and I live in Canada so I don't have a vertigo hanger yet..NOT EASY...and it very expenssive to ship back and forth from each other so I'm wondering if you have a easier way of me getting a hanger to you for the work to be done..maybe you have a new or used hanger I'll buy them..😉.. .im looking for the red and black mini truck..but any colour is fine as I can paint them..I was gonna ask you about doing the gear drive in red and couple days ago and love seeing this for your pops..

Hey @Frenchy regarding hanger you can buy from trampa and specify our address that way we will get them modify and ship it together for you :)

Regarding red casing it's possible but it would take some time to make ;) So if you interest head to shop buy 1:3 mini kit, I will send you address where to order hanger and will start making the enclosure from red plastic :)

So my father spending this evening reassembling the whole board from scratch and found some issues... @trampa again your order assembler missed a lot of stuff from order... Not a single washer was present in the whole kit, no speed rings for wheels, no washers for bindings mountings and a lot of other stuff.

Good thing he has a whole collection of mounting hardware so it wasn't an issue but it's not the first time this happens... I still want my black springs... I hate those red ones :anger: 

![image|375x500](upload://uX55Tx1ImFCafIB5MpRWS8yVgN.jpeg) 

Also, this is Trampa SuperStar brand new wheel hub which was never ridden. Did some measurements using precise CNC tools and results are shocking: wheel hub is not even round...

![Image result for welp meme](https://i.imgflip.com/1jgmlt.jpg)

Swapped to black FatBoy's hub and this is the difference :)

Yes, that's really annoying ...
Order a complete deck, and get no speedring, no spacer in the wheel (between bearing), got a wrong full set of screws in M6 !?!.. Or the deck need M5 one for the trucks to deck ... arg
You order white stuff they ship grey one just cause they didn't get the good color, didn't care about the customer choice ...
Yes, they ship super fast but ... I prefer to get the good order with all what I choose and in one shot.
But I guess all shop is the same, with little trouble due to the human being.

```
The tires themselves are unbalanced and probably the worst offenders when it comes to adding vibration to any mountain board.

Factors that have an influence on wobbles would be tire pressure and dumb luck (pressing the tire one way or another prior to full inflation has an impact on how balanced they are). I can inflate a tire and have a different result each single time on the same hub. Oh, and no single tire is identical. 

To keep it short, you'd have to post a comparison video with just the hubs for a fair comparison, though I don't doubt the inaccuracies you have measured.

? We are making them, just this is first set of wheel hubs. It's complicated as wheel hub is big and wider than normal wheel hubs. so modifications were made.

@Andy87 these hubs accept superstar based mountings so trampa/etoxx/FatBoy gear drives and pulleys would fit without issues. Rear wheels are the same ET and front will not need spacer :)

That wheel hub mounting side will be the same distance from side of wheel otherwise it would be too deep and no mount would reach out of  wheel. You can see difference in mount side and road side

EDIT: the difference is because this wheel hub is much wider than superstar one.

But please asks me when you guess to don't understand !! I'm not English, and I don't leave an English country, so don't hesitate to ask clarification about an order or custom thing that are important!
What do you don't understand ??

Ok, so it's not started and will not until some more times? GB will take even more.
You maybe got an idea if it's going to be before Xmas?
What is the estimated price of your 9" set ?

I will let you know what I could get in Frankia,..  I would like to know what you think guys :slight_smile: but I'm not confident, with the high cost here and time it will take for a set of 5 wheels ... Plus my 3D model isn't really ready.

So our motors with some problems arrived but now I can see that 80100 fits without issues but on this board only 8085 will go ;)

This board is for my father he is complete beginner so to give some breathing room I thought that 8085 would suffice as this will be full off road and rare on streets board ;)

I am chose 80100 just so that motors wouldn't overheat too much in summer ;) I would be running only half of its current capacity.

RPM are still depending on your motor KV but mostly its more torque and higher current ratings for e.g. 80100 can go up to 180A :) compared to 80A from 6384 :slight_smile:

Also not many drive trains even support 80mm motors

I see, so are there even ESC's (or VESC's) that can push this to its full current rating? I mean i would assume that this thing would be a monster if fully powered and mounted as you've done!

So after APS failed to fulfill their custom shaft order with just cutting of the shaft to dimension needed with angle grinder without taking them out of the motors we started modifying them for long term usage...

Machining shaft to 10mm from 12mm. Milling out the keyways, changing bearings to quality ones, changing hall sensor IC to quality ones which can withstand high temperature and coating everything to prevent water damage.

What did you use for this ? I mean, did you get a reference/product/brand to advise for that?
You coat everything, as the sensor wiring + pcb ? + copper wires of the stator a bit too? (like the 8085 on the left in the 3rd pic?)

Its problem with mostly all motors out in the market for esk8 ;) It's when motors heat up and then motor bell case is expanding and then because magnets are glued to surface it brakes off...

@Riako only sensor board using this stuff its up to 125 degrees

So was doing some playings with original motor bearings and all the motor big bearings (the one which supports bell) were having some hard time to spin..

So quick look under microscope and guess what I found? :D Chinese were glueing the bearings in and didn't even bother to cover bearings or etc  :) All bearings have exact spot glues inside them :D

It's a damaged nut that welded itself onto the axle when it was spun. We can swap hangers in such a case. In general: Stainless wants to be turned slow and use of anti seize paste is the best way to prevent such things from happening. 
The paste also prevents corrosion. 
Stainless nuts can bite themselves onto external threads, especially if you turn them fast, using a ratchet. It's a soft material that wants to be treated with care.

Everyone is on holidays right now

It's very convenient that over the last 6 months you've released a score of products in competition to Frank and all of a sudden everything you own with a Trampa sign on it is shit.

You're not trustworthy kugs. You're too emotionally invested and your own parts are not flawless.

@brenternet do you think we are doing it on purpose? It wasn't even outside just sitting waiting for free time to finish it. Also as you see in previous comments its already 3 people with the same issue so its not only us.

This is to be expected from time to time when you are using austenitic stainless steel hardware.
Sometimes you have an an axle that is at the top part and a nut at the lower part of the accepted tolerance.
Then if you make the mistake of going a little bit too fast using a nyloc nut you heat up the axle and nut which then seize together.
Solution?
Apply anti-seize or grease, go slow or better yet exchange the nut for a non stainless steel.
Using stainless steel hardware has its merits for use near sea environments as in the case of kiteboards but in a common esk8 application stainless sucks balls.
Just contact @Trampa and they will solve your problem.

@taz There was no seize or etc, just unbolted nut and it thread just crumbled. I just mentioned him, but no solution received so far. Just explanation to not an existing problem.

Well, I am not troll like you, I am here with issue not trying to make jokes like you always do. It's not like I can get hanger tomorrow and enjoy the board in the holiday period when I have time. It's not like my father has all the time to shit post and do whatever he wants in the meantime. It's small gap in between works where he can enjoy himself and etc and now its and issue and board is unrideable. After holidays back to works and what you will do go post some other shits aka zero sense of humour. 

Time is money you know...

If you want I can suspend all the order right now and go for the making troll post and etc will people be happy no?

So if you appreciate the stuff you get from him at least be supportive if you don't like stuff we make we can happily stop making it and just continue working on our main business as this is not our main income, just trying to provide for this community.

I'm just taking part by part what he posted about the build. it's the third in the list and the first of his design. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt as either way, at least it's his design. You can have other's make your parts, I don't see that as a problem. But it should be at least your own designs if your claiming "built from scratch"...

Very easily detectable really. As frank mentioned, it is indeed caused by damaged or imprecise nuts. I threw one away (new) immediately because out of all 8 I used with previous boards, this one could not be screwed on properly/had too much resistance. I don't recommend bolting these things on with force and thinking it may just be the new nylock causing issues.

Do the Fatboy hubs require a spacer in between the 2 bearings? Do you need speed rings because I don't have any thread space to fit any speed rings. Also what lubrication is needed for the gear drives?
