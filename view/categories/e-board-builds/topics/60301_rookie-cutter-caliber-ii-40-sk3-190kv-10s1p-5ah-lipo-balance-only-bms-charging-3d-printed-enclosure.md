Welcome to my Australian winter-time ESK8 project :snowflake: 

Designed to turn rookies (like myself) into a reasonable cookies :cookie:

Decorated in a safety orange and white colour scheme and built upon a 40.5" downhill longboard deck, Rookie Cutter is my first attempt at a fast and flexible cruiser.

Looks good, I live in Aus too and I can highly recommend either 97mm wheels or genuine flywheels. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s everywhere but the road where I live are pretty chunky and my 83mm wheels make my feet a bit sore after a while. If you donâ€™t already have them get 97mm at least

I found a lot of larger and genuine wheels to be fairly pricey at above the $130 locally, hence why I picked up a cheap pair with my trucks from Amazon US. How much did you pick yours up for?

I managed to get a set of 97mm clones on eBay for $60 from a forum member @dickyho

Yeah genuine wheels are bloody expensive, I think I might get a used set on here

Yep exactly the same here, Iâ€™ve heard they chunk a lot. Although thatâ€™s kinda good because used sets can be picked up on here for about $30

A clearer diagram of my balance only BMS charging setup. Took @Jinra 's advice on the matter and brought the LCD monitor electrically closer. Could someone help verify my diagram?

Fyi, that wheel pulley won't fit on Calibers without filing the hanger

The BMS to Battery - cable looks off to me. Where exactly does that go? What about the balance leads?

Didn't want to convolute the other wires with 10 balance wires so I've represented those connections with the ellipsis on each battery :grin:

you dont file so much as cut, but you'll have to cut off about 8mm from the hangar. I used a dremel.

I think that ID was around 2mm smaller than needed
Maybe you'll be better off with printing a pulley, buying from HK ( if you find them available :sweat_smile:), paying more and buying from forum members

You will have a hard time with that motor mount and the caliber trucks. The motor you bought also won't be very plug and play with that mount. I think you should chuck the turnigy mount and get one made for caliber trucks, it will save you a lot of headaches.

Last few cables and connectors have rolled in as well as my first mounting attempt:

Clearance was too close to the board so Iâ€™ve got some 14mm risers coming!
The pulleys fit perfectly after a little file, and came in a blazing red which is a happy surprise ðŸ˜Š

The entire circuit is charging and discharging correctly. Photos coming soon of that. Iâ€™ve filed down the motor mount to give the board additional clearance as well as clearway for the motors circlip to spin freely. I used a grinder to create grooves on the motors shaft for the motor pulley to grip to.

Bit of an update dump:

![image|375x500](upload://s4eCzHJtSj4aiE1iuQrT0wIlBEz.jpeg)
After trying to tighten the grubs I stripped the threads on the alloy motor pulley that came included in my cheap eBay kit. I promptly butchered the poor pulley in attempt to make things work, but to no avail.

![image|375x500](upload://ujGJeEvougIbBuoRxywIi1EfbAf.jpeg)
A quick order from RS components came through with a 15 tooth 5M 15mm wide timing pulley but had no grub holes and a 6mm bore. I drilled the bore out to 8mm but I was freshly out of grub and instead used this M? smothered in red locktite to secure the pulley.

![image|374x500](upload://2QvcqPVl48fjfFJodtXDuSTi4rg.jpeg)
I scaled an enclosure found on thingiverse and printed it in PETG at 0.2mm layer height. (Photo taken before cable management).

![image|666x500](upload://1rTPHh53sK3zUbMO7PgBFxn5fqW.jpeg)
The enclosure is attached via 8 M? bolts with nylon nuts.

![image|375x500](upload://vuYIcCeQG2WxXpX1nxNdkpIcsGs.jpeg)
Success!

Using @twan's VESC App for iOS I can monitor the charging progress of my board :heart_eyes:
