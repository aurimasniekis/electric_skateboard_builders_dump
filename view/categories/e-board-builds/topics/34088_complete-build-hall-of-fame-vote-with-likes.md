I don't know if another picture thread is necessary, especially one with not the build creator posting pics, most have their complete build in pics only thread.

I think this is a great idea, hall of fame for the cleanest and most powerful builds

I like the direct drive of it.. maybe there should be seperate thread for longboard builds? (As this one might go in category for mountainboards.. then we also have hybrids /urban carvers and pennyboards/cruisers :)

As of now i would nominate.. who ever made this board, attracted my attention when i first saw it (or the picture itself.is very nice)
