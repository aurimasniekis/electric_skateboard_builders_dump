I bought anti spark switch for my electrick skateboard (http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/rc-ev-accessories/electronics/alien-antispark-power-switch-2-14s-120amp-max/), I connected it just like on diagram from their webside and I doesn't work. Doesn't metter if the button is pushed in or not everything still works (motors are working), anyone know what's the problem? here are some photos that hopefully will make everything clear:

I used diagram above to connect switch

When they fail, typically the FETs fail closed (thx blasto) (completing the loop).  Most likely it is dead - i'd contact APS and get a replacement.

I've heard they aren't super robust, so i might look at one of the Vedder/Fechter switches as an upgrade.  I've also seen a neat triple direct-FET from @goldenHusky which is a nice option.

Hey, the shiny part of the plug on the switch is on the top

will I have to send back the one I have now? Because it will take long time(and money too) to send it from poland to GB (or something like that I don't remember)

Contact APS/Bruno - he is a good guy, but can be a bit slow to respond occasionally.  I bet he'll ship you one after basic troubleshooting to confirm it's dead.  Likely won't need the old switch back, but he'll let you know.

He is in GB.

GL!

Just a quick typo correction, "FETs tend to fail closed (completing the loop)"
