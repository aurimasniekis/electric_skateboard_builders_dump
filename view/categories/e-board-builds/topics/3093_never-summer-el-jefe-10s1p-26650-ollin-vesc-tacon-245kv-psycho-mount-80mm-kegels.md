I guess now is as time as any to start a build thread.

This has been an ongoing project since late January.  Due to various painful delays this board still resides on my kitchen table :cry:.   The parts are as follows:

* NS El Jefe Deck
* Caliber 2s
* Kegel Wheels
* Bones Reds Bearings
* 2x 5s1p 26650 Batteries in series
* OllinBoards VESC
* TB 14T Motor Pulley/36T Wheel pulley
* Tacon 245kv
* Psychotiller Mount (delayed)
* Custom Kydex Enclosure (Heat gun + time = ?)
* GT2B
* 10s BMS (eventually)
* XT90s on/off

I'm building this in hopes that I can commute the 3 miles one-way to work and back and do various other errands around town.  This would also save me from having to ride the shitty Washington DC Metro everyday (those unfamiliar please visit https://twitter.com/unsuckdcmetro for highlights).

Most of the heavy lifting has been done on this project.  I'm currently just waiting for a shim from psychotiller so that the mount can be fit securely.  After that, I should be able to throw some wires together and take my first test run.

Also I got some pyscho tiller mounts less than 5 miles on them. Powder coat black

@scrant I'm interested in seeing a Kydex enclosure I've often thought it would be a good material for esk8, but wondered if it is sturdy enough. Keep us posted!

@treenutter - I've tried Kydex. Kydex is pretty good if thick enough. Fairly similar to ABS just easier to heat up and mold. They use it for gun and knife holders.

Yeah the main enclosure i'm building is out of .118 kydex which feels like overkill.  I also have so .028 lying around to do a simple motor/belt debris shield later down the road.

I just installed the shim for my psycho mount.  I'm not entirely confident in this resolution but it's on there.

Now onto the next issue  - why a 255mm belt is too large.  Am I missing something here?

I have 5 different builds. 3 different belt sizes. Too many combinations of pulleys, and center to center distances to have 1 belt fit all of them.

That's why the center distance calculator is so important to all of us. 
In 5m, if you divide the length of the belt 255 by 5 you get the number of teeth.

I wasn't assuming any ol' belt length would work.  I went with the size you suggested for a 14t/36t setup in another thread.  

I figured there was enough adjustment on the mounts to accommodate.  Whoops.

Finally done!  I was able to get everything thrown together and working smoothly!

I placed everything into my wonky kydex enclosure and mounted it to the deck using a second set of skate hardware.  The initial idea was to use tnuts and epoxy them in for a cleaner look, but with one quick mistake with the drill - I was through the deck and looking at other options.  I also gave up on the psycho mount and went over to the tb v4 option.   I just couldn't get the psycho mount to have a good clamp on the hanger.  The width of the v4 mount of the truck is much wider and feels rock solid now that it's mounted. 

Also, I had a crazy simple idea to throw a volt meter onto a male charging plug as aneeded as-needed fuel guage.  I can leave it in and ride or just check it before and after my trip.

@kyo It is 8.5inches wide in the center of the board.  

I was surprised when I measured just now.  I wear a US 11 shoe and usually like riding wider boards and the El Jefe is plenty.  The concave is aggressive too.

Sorry @anorak234 .  No Diagrams.

I am using a 10s BMS so it was just a matter of wiring that up.  The female laptop plug's positive wire goes to the battery and the negative goes to the BMS.

I'm looking to build a second battery pack on 10S1P array with 26650 4200mAh, it should give me 37V * 4200 / 1000 = 155.4Whr, perfect for flying (Max permitted is 160whr)

What batteries did you use for your build? What was it's watt hour capacity? 

How many miles of range did you get with your battery?

The Basens would be 10S1P, 37V * 4.5A = 166Wh, I won't be allowed to fly with that battery pack.

Do you get any wheel bite with this setup? Do you think larger wheels would be possible with this deck?

I've never had any issues with wheel bite.  I don't see why you wouldn't be able to have a larger wheel.  You may need a taller riser to accommodate it.

Thanks for the response. How flexy is the deck? How does it ride? I really like the kicktail design with the wheel cut outs. Seems like a perfect hybrid board.

It's a pretty rigid deck and rides great.  I'm about to buy this year's model and switch everything over since it's gotten a little soft after 6 or 700 miles.

700 miles is pretty good range. :) :) :) What battery cells did you use, and did you use nickel strips or wire to connect them? Also, did you use your soldering iron on the batteries with no ill effects? I'm planning on building my own battery with 18650 cells but I thought I needed a spot welder...

I have soldered my last 4 battery packs with soldering iron and had no ill effects at all, at least not that I could at least detect myself. 

Nevertheless, i bought a spot welder and the process time is reduced immensely, can't go wrong with a spot welder, I bought an arduino from Endless sphere
