Let me introduce **Fliess** (**Flie√ü** auf Deutsch).<br />It can do what it was made for - riding fast, hard and long.<br /><br />Below is a short story in pictures of creating **Fliess1** and then evolution to **Fliess2**. The order is more or less chronological, so the actual result is at the very bottom. **Fliess3** doesn't necessarily have 3 motors.<br /><br />got a really good motor with crappy bearings though<br /><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1JcUDl-hhKw/WQe3bEejTmI/AAAAAAAAF7U/mmFcqCdoZnwgbvrugWKYFWi-rcX-OnJ0QCEw/s1600/IMG_2874.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br />trying to fit different size aluminium enclosures and still believing that it was a brilliant idea to do so :confused: <br /><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GQgqjiKb5zE/WQe3b46goQI/AAAAAAAAF7U/qSJuqO_Cm4QRuBzpxpzMbHRdcZXWYd4wQCEw/s1600/IMG_2890.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Pw_b_Qj_IFE/WQe3by7MfoI/AAAAAAAAF7U/karV3vmUnvE-GaUu1lHsAinQo3pF6vYCgCEw/s1600/IMG_2891.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-e01gjCs_DaU/WQe3cPIfrQI/AAAAAAAAF7U/yLyxHGso3bIzJfKk4NRyFGQWfwQGMK7KQCEw/s1600/IMG_2892.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b_w-k1eFlLM/WQe3cf1JsII/AAAAAAAAF7U/-9yzmM_uUtscUw3CbBc0-ii4zJs3ggfiACEw/s1600/IMG_2893.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br />41x accus and each perfectly 3.53V<br /><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bckRpihc69A/WQe3cQummTI/AAAAAAAAF7U/4MNF51nHENIU46Ba_7-v724zj1i3jXb4wCEw/s1600/IMG_2906.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zeomOax9-Js/WQe3cX6Os1I/AAAAAAAAF7U/Jtxn_B7UwY4y6-Vbw9oK60kXDexajqHAACEw/s1600/IMG_2908.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br />at the end very decent remote/receiver with minimum failures (of course, only after making sure that soldering is ok and antenna is properly placed)<br /><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Pg9ioa-9vfs/WQe3cvUT40I/AAAAAAAAF7U/Mjl0EWSwZa0IX5DbiKodNfYKwssUOJ7FgCEw/s1600/IMG_2910.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br />flex bamboo deck makes it more difficult to come up with a good enclosure, but it's worth it<br /><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-R-1u-xtX0PI/WQe3chJjZdI/AAAAAAAAF7U/ijOOjAgCklYSts4-kpgvmVrNXNl_c_xfACEw/s1600/IMG_2925.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZF8fOwZay5Q/WQe3c-vhNzI/AAAAAAAAF7U/2YyRQtJ9GaIjCwDb37Rt_q3mVhMQtvhYwCEw/s1600/IMG_2926.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I compare everything with my Evolve, since with it I learned how things should and, even more important, **should not** be<br /><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CjtjhSouqXc/WQe3c74IRvI/AAAAAAAAF7U/YYUdzfUH_YIX32YDnLpACCgs94bGKNvvgCEw/s1600/IMG_2931.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br />another batch of things came meanwhile from HobbyKing<br /><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8x9dAQnLdzs/WQe3dCwf8MI/AAAAAAAAF7U/xmDKakpm1IQyelR2khx4ysqp55pLs3_ugCEw/s1600/IMG_2933.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br />go for Turnigy silicone wires if you want a good ones<br /><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jzz8Deg16NU/WQe3dT09OeI/AAAAAAAAF7U/lWwRx6-Xo9ABOBZpSSJcpZLaClA7nmrOwCEw/s1600/IMG_2937.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cIUPA39-LfY/WQe3dkAuzyI/AAAAAAAAF7U/2hnovRcxKsst2oGL0tGAyOi0_FmMalIJwCEw/s1600/IMG_2943.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BG1i2khrs_A/WQe3dj9DoZI/AAAAAAAAFxI/PiBvYHMYJpAn-Rugi_nwKCS3wN0eje9tQCEw/s1600/IMG_2944.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I did even believe that suspended aluminium enclosure makes sense and ordered custom springs<br /><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dEqkYBTANzQ/WQe3d8WYUVI/AAAAAAAAFxM/BHx-GNhYWF04yaok9MQ8G_oQ00ajg8D2gCEw/s1600/IMG_2945.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-m-Qu-6yO5xU/WQe3eBJCYUI/AAAAAAAAF7U/29Fggjj7-WwCkTNudM0YaiFx83F1E70QgCEw/s1600/IMG_2953.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7875LZ2YRXo/WQe3eLvzlYI/AAAAAAAAFxQ/ZnyBUh9h-moRgQrlRV9z2afSHXSER9ayQCEw/s1600/IMG_2957.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PhPRJ65QQnA/WQe3eJ8XUZI/AAAAAAAAFxY/ALmohbJqNrkB5JhyGUF39X9r4s626SoDgCEw/s1600/IMG_2959.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RXcXssG_yWc/WQe3eXozqUI/AAAAAAAAFxc/x1RgYb3gegIoT5_UcYEDWXNRPLyBmx8aQCEw/s1600/IMG_2961.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DPTEHfRfhFw/WQe3eV8o05I/AAAAAAAAFxg/dGzbUrLxajUn2AOpZs7DqkhD1HAliCCbwCEw/s1600/IMG_2966.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0qEqNgAZp5I/WQe3ekNhygI/AAAAAAAAFxk/yV3uMrotPRU5WCEebSG8xffaJuXKr3EAQCEw/s1600/IMG_2967.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5KDvHXK35zw/WQe3e2LuuCI/AAAAAAAAFxs/A-7pbQk2jrAW0wUsanOE6uWXVZ86DQrjACEw/s1600/IMG_2975.JPG" alt="Image" /><br /><br />of course, I wanted to try both -

@fliess  What kind of electronic motor controller it is?

At first.. from the placement of caps I thought maybe you got vesc-x design and pcb.. but then when I saw coming out 6wires out of the esc and understanding it is for dual drive, I got it that this one is not vesc..

So can you shed some light on what motor controller is it?

---

Otherwise, very nice build log, lots of pictures..

I also wonder why did you go with belts in the end, if you said you liked chain better,. I assume with belt drive, there is less custom work :) and also the weight seemed to be a lot less with belt drive as chain drive's sprockets and chain itself were a bit heavy.

--

On what roads do you ride +60kph?

Crazy speed.. did you do downhill rides before you started eskateboarding?

It is VESC - he built a dual VESC on one PCB.  I saw above he had it marked as VESC 4.12:

I cannot remember what brand or who is working on it, but I do know that Mischo Erban rode it. He fell off once, due to hub wheel urethane getting stripped off.

At first I though, yeah nice build brother. But once I started scrolling down, it was like OMG! You took it very seriously, KUDOS for that!

BTW why did you ended up lowering the KV of the motors instead of just working with a more suitable pulley combination?

What pitch are these pulleys and why did you choose them at the begining instead a regular HTD5?

@Okami, if the chain was not that noisy, then I would most probably stick to it. Otherwise, there is no sense to use FOC from perspective of noise, because the chain is anyway louder.
We have very good roads in my area and after 11pm you are the king of the road :smile: My parents didn't tell me what is downhill when I was teenager, so I missed that part of my life. Maybe good that they didn't...

Maybe their carbon duals are much better than bamboo though. @whitepony's builds have actually inspired me at the beginning. So many thanks to him!
I am still not sure about hub motors. I don't want to compromise any small fraction of performance to anything else.

@Eboosted, these motors wanted exactly 8.5 turns, and only in this configuration they shown to be very efficient. It was rather experimental approach than theoretical. I still need more understanding how exactly the motor works. Moreover, the larger pulley the more reliable and less noisy system is. HTD3 pulleys are definitely not for performance. And thanks for watching :slight_smile:

@Okami, I definitely don't want to encourage anybody to go with such a speed, because electronic may always fail (we are assuming that the road is perfect and there is no one potential obstacle on rider's way). I was saying the same to myself every time I got another +5kmh. And then I got again and again some failures, like screaming motors or over current (I am of course talking only about FOC). So it became like a game against failures, because I wanted to get a board, which I can 100% trust (meaning that it cannot have any failures on 70A per motor in FOC regardless of how much I demand from it and how long).
In other words, all this is to show not how fast I can ride, but what are the possibilities of the board itself. Or how cool is @Vedder's VESC.

@Michael319, it seems we are talking about different things. I am not afraid about fitting the motor. Sure it is doable and have already been done by many people. I just want to have at least 23mm of clearance between the motors and ground (that is what I currently have on my 83mm wheels and drop through setup). Otherwise there is inevitable contact of the motors with some rocks, curbstones or uneven asphalt :disappointed:

@Michael319, before I start experimenting with direct drive, could you please share at least some experience in regards to performance? Of course, it is very subjective, because "super crazy fast and torquey" for someone could be nothing for someone else. I don't want to put some more attention to my build or so, but just for comparison. Currently I am super happy with performance and there is literally no one hill in my area which I cannot get on speed 40kmh+. This is very important, because it gives a feeling that you can everything and what you can improve is only your rider skills. I really don't want to lose in performance now. At the same time, direct drive looks very attractive. Don't know what to do... :confused:

My opinion hasn't changed that sudden braking isn't the worst. The worst is "full throttle" that you can not stop, so acceleration till your hardware limited top speed without a chance to stop that like you can see here: [https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-nunchuk-rf/588/82](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-nunchuk-rf/588/82) Worst feeling ever. Hope no one else will ever know that feeling.

Just want to tell you be carful at that speeds.

I run a 12s2p with a single carvon v2.5 on foc. So I am not at the top of the performance capability. But, with what I have I can reach 34mph easy, Ive maxed out at ~37-38 mph. With a 12s4p+ and 2-4 motors, it would possibly be one of the most powerful boards out there. Carvon v2.5s are crazy powerful, more powerful than any other direct drive including v3. With only one motor acceleration is good, but starting up isn't super strong,tl this could be because of foc mode and not the motor. Highly recommended for performance.

@hexakopter, I really appreciate that you care and share your bad experience with others.
Meanwhile I even tried to reduce the max speed just by disconnecting almost the half of my battery pack, i.e. 10s5p -> 6s5p. I know, there are more correct ways to do so :slight_smile: But I don't want to change my gear ratio, neither do it programmatically. And anyway I wanted to make this test before to check a theory on practice. Honestly, I was surprised about efficiency (any signs of overheating) and performance (just very enough torque for my area).

I have really forgot a feeling when you can just put a throttle to max, so needed some time to get accustomed :slight_smile: After Evolve I convinced myself that speed switch is useless and I would never need it, but now I wish to have it on Fliess (<50 and >50kmh).
