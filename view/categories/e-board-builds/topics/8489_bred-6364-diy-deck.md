Soooooooo
Finally I'm gonna build a board.
I got a 6364 neodym from eBay
My drivetrain ready 
Ordered a motor mount from esk8.de
A broken vesc xD
90amp hobby King boat ESC
6s 5000mah lipo from turnigy
Glass fiber and wood ordered to build a deck sth like a fake jet spud
I hope this is gonna go good.
I I also want to add leds later and freeboard bindings.

Everything sounds good except for the ESC... I would recommend a car ESC if you can't fix the VESC. The FVT 120A works with 6s, it has been proven to be quite reliable for the price.

I used the ESC before with my sk3 5055 and 6s but I'm gonna get the vesc fixed soon anyway :wink:

Maybe  Bred|6364|diy deck. ?
My wifi is too bad and I only got bad pictures right now because the board is at the house of a friend of mine...

Jup that's what I did

And 2unidirectional so there is no flex left

I finally finished the board!!!!!! I didn't make any more pictures of the process but see the result.  I bought an ads kit and build an Glassfibre enclosure. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/7/c7ef19d82b5fed7eef54f7d23fa599247cd0419f.jpg" width="690" height="388">
