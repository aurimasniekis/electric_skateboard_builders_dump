Just a classic Evolve rebuild.   Which just so happens to be my first real build from the info on this forum.  Thx guys for the info.  

Find an Evolve with no electronics or non working and gut it out and remove all the crappy Evolve electronics that could lead to your death.   (eBay in my case). Replace it with the best components in your own opinion.  Ride safe.
