Hey, this will be my first electric board build. I've been esk8ting for two years on my Boosted v2. However I need a way to include my daughter's and wife so I thought why not another board so I can have someone to ride with.  It's been about four years since I've touched a brushless motor and ESC (helicopters and foam wings), so I've had to ask some questions and do some reading to remember stuff. I'm also very much into motorcycles and dirtbiking or rather anything that moves with a motor...  I'm currently living on the North Shore of Oahu.  My roads are 90% flat and well paved until you find some roads heading up the mountains then it gets steep quick.

About the board. 
https://www.amazon.com/Jaseboards-bamboo-longboard-skateboard-complete/dp/B01KH51XD0

I picked up four boards when we moved to Hawaii. I have two of these. I've fit myself and three kids on one at the same time.  It's a big board with a little flex to it.  I should have plenty of space for stuff under the board.

Since this wasn't really a budget build I decided to go dual motor 12s.  I'm around 180lbs, but probably closer to 220lbs with all the motorcycle gear and board weight.

So on the 29th of October I went nuts online and ordered parts till my credit card company decided I had way to many PayPal purchases and put a hold on it till I called.

So the parts have slowly started rolling in this week. Enough for me to start the build till my batteries show up.

Current wheels are the black 83mm that come from diy kit. I've already ordered (I know their big) 107mm Abec flywheels.

Other bits include mini remote, higher duro barrel bushings for my weight. 16t or 18t motor pulleys. I'm sure I forgot some stuff.  BT telemetry, got that as well. I have two 12"x24" kydex sheets to make custom battery and electronics boxes.

Charger is a Protek640 6s/40a/1000w with a 750w power supply
https://www.amainhobbies.com/protek-rc-prodigy-640-high-power-lipo-life-dc-battery-charger-6s-40a-1000w-ptk-8512/p260578

Battery's... It will be for testing two large 5000mah plus 40c lipos.  I'll be using a wattmeter to determine my actual amp usage at various voltages to determine what type of 12s?p battery to make. Which will probably be 18650s

So questions so far. 
1.The motor wires. Only point forward if I don't want to completely bend them. Maybe deck risers or leave it forward?

2. How much space between the deck and the motors to account for turning?

3. Blue loctite okay? (Lots of vibrating parts)

4. I'll think of something... Connecting the FOCBOX together. Which plug does it share?

More pictures and questions to come as the rest of the parts come in and I have free time to build this. 

Yes, I'm aware this is a big and fast build. Yes I have safety gear for riding. I have four daughter's and a wife to tell me to be careful so don't waste your time on me.  😛

I am quite busy with work so if I have questions about the build I usually search for the answer but if it takes to long I'll just ask...  So far I've seen a lot of good information and already got some good help and I look forward to more.

Also, if it appears I have missed some sort of important parts let me know😬

Eric

The 3rd pic from the bottom look good for clearance. about 2cm is good unless you set your trucks looooose...

blue yes! red won't come off...

the yellow power plug is shared, you need a parrallel adapter and the bl/red/white is the signal will need a spliter unless you plan to use canbus. (i wouldn't)..


and you will not touch your boosted again after this.. :joy:

Agreed, your boosted will collect dust.

I'd recommend 16T over the 18T if you're looking to climb any of those steep hills you've got.

I'd corroborate with the blue, its very secure. 

What I did for motor bite was mount the motor where I thought would be good then had my wife check for clearance when I put all my weight into the lean. If I had ~0.5cm clear then I knew I was good to go. If you don't have enough ground clearance then I'd suggest a bigger angle and using risers.

Motor wires are JST 1.5mm.  FocBox is 2.0mm JST PH. Going to require cutting the sensor wire and swapping the connectors.

Does BLDC tool give you an option to reverse motor direction?  I plan to solder the motor wires to the vesc permanently. (Edit. It does not. You have to swap any two motor wires connected to the ESC.)

So I plugged in my metr.at module. It connected to my phone no issues. I believe I followed the settings from their page to adjust the BLDC tool. Either way it didn't show any parameters.  I probably messed something up in the settings but after four hours of sleep and 14 hours at work I gave up after one try...  More to come.  Tomorrow I'm going to properly attach the motor mounts and clean up the motor/ESC wires for the box.

Some more work done today.  Took some measurements and threw some loctite on all the threads. Added the half inch risers. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/e/8e96fbf264831e2324081abc5b0211b9c25a9016.JPG" width="375" height="500">

I have to put all my weight on the board edge while bouncing to get it to make contact. Fortunately it only hits the Motor mount.

For some reason one motor sits higher than the other but they are both sitting against the stops of each bracket.

I used a wimpy 3s battery to do the tests.  I can already tell on 12s this board is going to be insane.  Also 5" of clearance?? Crazy<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/0/5043fc2e9e3e9f4ce5942697a34141b37db60ea5.JPG" width="375" height="500">

I need to rewire the motor sensor wires. I soldered to close to the connector so it's not very flexible.  Better to just cut and do it over right.  The only thing I'm really waiting on now are the 97mm wheels and the lipos and wattmeter setup from my friend to get here.

I'm not getting signal to the other ESC. Only one wheel turning. Just white wire connected. Any ideas where I messed up?

You need ground to you second foxbox on your ppm wire. Otherwise it won't be able to determine the signal relative to ground and it'll just look like like noise to the foxbox. When you split ppm, connect all 3 wires to one foxbox, and connect the white and black only to the second one. 

And be sure to cover that solder joint on the white wire with some heat shrink or electrical tape. Have it exposed is asking for a short and remote failure

Well. I forgot it's veterans day. So the board is ready for testing.  I have everything sitting on top to include batteries because I haven't made the Kydex boxes to fit the underside yet. Plus at 48" I think I have room up top for everything at the moment.  

I guess the real tests will start happening Monday....

So, my batteries came on Sunday!! Yay postal service trying to play catch-up.

By the time I finished with the family at the beach, charged batteries, and setup the board it was dark. Perfect time for testing😬

Anyways. This huge board is super smooth on 97mm wheels. Still carves super nice. Turns like a cruise ship with high duro bushings though (97.5).  

So I threw on all my motorcycle gear and went outside.  So the controller was more touchy than my Boosted board. I wouldn't call it crazy but a different curve and totally manageable.  

I didn't bother going to the hill by the house. To dark.. it's basically a road that goes up a mountain. Not sure where to... 

So after I messed with some acceleration and braking I went out to the side street which is basically empty of cars all the time and freshly paved. Needless to say after two laps checking for anything out of the ordinary I squeezed the trigger till it wouldn't go any faster.  Apparently this is 35mph. 


So for never going over 22mph on a board. 35 felt fastish😁.  

So I must have hit RPM/kV max because the dead space in the trigger at top speed.

Either way when this board is finished it's going to be awesome.  

Still more to come.

How do I see motor temp? It's a sensored motor.

New bits and pieces arriving.  Evolve 107mm Abec 11s showed up. Took them out for a spin.  Very impressed.  I'm currently trying out 18/36 gears with these monster wheels. On level ground I can now give it full throttle without flying off the board.  So the TorqueBoards wheel kit fit fine. No issues with clearance.  Only problem/not problem is with 18/36 and my current belt length there is about one mm of clearance on the motor pulley from the huge wheel.  Easily fixed with a longer belt but I'm not sure I will keep the super tall gearing yet.  I really need to find some hills to drive to since where I live is 99 percent flat.  

My 18650 battery setup is still a work in progress. My friend building the pack just had shoulder surgery.

So I was able to pull 106 amps going uphill.  Currently my settings are 60 battery and 65 motor.  

I've had the belts start to move from what I believe is the wheel pulleys gradually moving closer to the center of the hub so I ordered some 15mm pulley sets to get the full 12mm of belt back on the wheel
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/a/ea9079d13ac235338b10b1fadb6ef9cb36159904.JPG" width="375" height="500">

My nano-x remote arrived and I got it all setup.  

I ordered threaded inserts because I want to keep the top of the board clean if possible.  Once the enclosure is mounted and done if they don't hold I'll go through the board I guess.

@Kug3lis made dual FOCBOX enclosures so I pre-ordered one of those as well.

My friend is ordering a spot welder hopefully soon so I can have a battery pack to finish this build😁😁😁. I'm ready to move on to a mountain board and a ebike.  

One of my 6s 8ah lipos basically lost a cell.  I finished a ride and it went down to .8v.... Yes under 1v.  I managed to trickle charge it back full but it slowly loses charge and maintains about 3.9v. If I take it easy now it drops voltage similar to the other cells.  If I get bored I'll remove and go 11s till my pack arrives.

I've been looking into some pneumis for the board as well.  I'm sure I'll own a set at some point.  

I keep thinking about how I'm going to manage the charging situation.  My intent is to use hobby charger but I want to have a nice enclosure that looks clean so I'm not sure what I'm going to do.  I like the idea of removing the entire battery enclosure like it's separate from the deck to make it more waterproof and allow it to flex with the board.  More to come I guess on that.  I am impressed with how smooth the large wheels ride.

Been kind of at a standstill for a while but I guess that gives me more time to research the next build.👍

So, I got these threaded inserts.  My intent is to keep the top of the deck clean.  I ordered 20.  They are 8mm long and my deck is 13mm.  So I can have them flush with the deck and not come through the other side.  Honestly they are smaller than I expected but I think with most of them used holding the heavy battery they should be fine.  

I'll be drilling a hole about the size minus threads then epoxy inside the hole before I screw the insert inside.  

Anyone have issues doing it this way or would have done it different?

Ordered one of these 15mm pulleys.... For my dual setup.  Oops.

How tight is tight enough on these six screws for the wheels?  Make it sit snug then blue loctite?  I had no issues with the 12mm ones but with the 107mm wheels you only get about 9mm of belt coverage![image|666x500](upload://zlOcoNNrSCLlP8Z8x1ErybNefij.jpg)

Depends on the mounts, for instance on the TB mount you can’t do that.

The other answer is longer belts and move the motor pulley away from the wheel

I do have room to flip the motor mounts. However if you look at the part circled if I flip the mount I will still have the same part of the motor pulley blocking the way.  

Realistically the longer belt option is what would work. I currently have room to have a longer belt.

The only thing bugging me is that when I originally mounted the wheel pulley and attached everything there was no real gap and the whole belt was covering the wheel pulley. Same on both sides.  

Whatever... Some 15mm pulleys and longer belts.  Gonna put that torque down.

I typically remove the outside collar on motor pulleys, makes belt maintenance a breeze and avoids the issue where the collar gets in the way of the wheel causing rubs.

Mine has some rubbing, just not from the collar. I'll have to measure what length I need when I get home. Longer belts will solve this.  107s are just a big ass wheel. So smooth though.

One 3s6p pack.  Three more to go.  Ran out of nickel strip.  

Plan on balance charging this beast.

Some updates. Ordered 15mm pulley sets.  Not a fan of tight belts or slipping belts so I just went wider. My other issue was the motor pulley contacting the wheels.  Longer belts solved that issue and I have the full 15mm contacting the wheel pulley.

Next I've been waiting for the CNC FocBox case to arrive and it has.  ![IMG_4125|375x500](upload://rPYww4R8VD8QtI457jxA2u88S66.JPG)![IMG_4128|375x500](upload://rUvmZkJ2zBgDQ8Eoxd4tAQYEtaN.JPG)

I did some testing and the temps rise slower and overall stay cooler. I'm going to start getting the shapes ready to build the enclosures next.  My batteries should be complete by Wednesday and I might have them Saturday so I can finish.

So.. 3s6p.  I'm hoping to install these batteries next week.  Should be plenty of juice.

Hey. About pulley tightness. I had a retainer ring/belt guard /flange but it was thin and weak. When I tightened the bolts, it bent. So I removed it, measured the ID and ordered a 2mm steel shim ring. It works for me. If you have the space, I would go with 3mm.

It's like incorporating that into the existing pulley would have worked. With the longer belts I was able to adjust the belts and get plenty of coverage without contacting the wheel.  Are you doing anything to retain the spacers in place other than tightening the pulley bolts around it?

It sits in a slot where the old one was. Perfect fit with a little  tlc

My dude where did you see 100 amp current draw on that ride of yours?

I saw 53~ from battery and ~56 into motors in the data. You do not add them up (if you did that, maybe I'm missing something?)

My Bluetooth module is only receiving data from one FocBox.  So double for combined data.

The board now has the juice.  I got a dual charger as well. 20a each channel so charging this board still won't take very long.  Some more testing to finish then shorten a bunch of wires before I call this board ready to go and build the enclosure.😁😁

Finally!!! The board is complete and 100% rideable.  Got around to changing the vesc settings to work with liion instead of lipos I was using to test.  I can tell you that .093 Kydex is a pain to mold corners, it's just to thick.

I have the CNC case exposed from @Kug3lis to keep things cool.  
Currently I have to remove the whole battery box to charge the batteries, but with 12s6p of 30q it's not a big deal every 30 plus miles.  I might consider cutting a hole in the box to reach the charge and balance wires.  It weighs about 26lbs according to my bathroom scale.   

Final steps will be to weather seal the case a little better. This thing is still a beast.
