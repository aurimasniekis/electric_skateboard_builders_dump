I've been lurking on the forum for a while now debating if I should bit the bullet and build my own board over getting a cheap Magneto. After an hour or so of playing with an excel document working out how much I can place into a budget I worked out I could get  a much better board for my budget of around £700-800 if I self-build rather than buy. 

I haven't decided on a deck. Originally I was going to use an old Penny Nickel deck I had lying around but the real estate between the trucks was too limiting to create a full on eSK8. Ideally I'll make the deck as short as possible because I intend to be able to take this board everywhere and that includes onto public transport, who incidentally never seem awfully keen to have a longboard  (even a regular one) as a passenger. 

I earned the money for this build by delivering papers but I'm fed up of cycling around so decided to make my work more fun by flying around on a eSK8 instead. I usually average about 15 MPH on my bike on the round and therefore decided to aim for about 25 MPH as a top speed just for that little bit of a thrill. I usually cycle about 2-3 miles but this can increase massively to about 5 or 6 depending on demand. Therefore ideally a range of 10 miles or more is an ideally safety margin for the build.

I decided on ordering most of my components from  just for ease and simplicity especially when paying tax and shipping to the UK. 

Hopefully the board will reach a loaded speed of around 30 MPH. 
I used this calculator to work out an estimate for speed based on components.

If anyone has any tips or advice I'd be willing to listen and I'll start ordering parts in as soon as I can afford to.

alright sounds good so far buuuuuut:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/choosing-the-right-motor-kv-for-the-vesc/3125

stay in the limits of the vesc.

230kv at 12s won´t work - you´ll have to hard adjust your max erpm at the vesc and that doesn´t feel good at all.

for a better experience for your needs go for 10s 3 or 4p - depends on how you adjust your budget.
and pick a 190kv motor.
then play a bit at the calculator to find your perfect gearing. like a 15/32.

you´ll then have a rocksolid build, fast as fk and good range if you pick the right battery type.

So from what I understand either a 12S battery pack with a 190 kv motor is ideal? If I dropped the battery down to a 10s I could continue to use the 230 kv?

Nah..still a bit too high; you'd scratch the limit.
If you like to use that motor, go down to 8 or 9s. Just look at @chaka s article.
But like i said, better aim for a lower kv motor and go for 10s ;)

 The most reliable controller I've found is the GT2b. About $25 too, so a bargain. 

Not the smallest controller to start,  but if you have access to a 3d printer (school/friend/3dhub), you can print the badwolf, mad Mikey, or Baby buffalo (thumb throttle).

Rock solid connection.  Not always the case w others.

I don't want to discourage you from doing or buying anything, but I've got a little story, so I got a winning remote, all excited to test it out and try it. I bound it, set it up and everything. It looked all good! So I stepped on the board and put on the throttle. I kid you not, it started shooting backwards (yes my motor wires were correct, it was not the wiring, I've used other remotes before that are fine.) after that, I turned off the remote and went to go turn off the board when suddenly it goes f#@&ing ballistic, and full throttles until it gets stopped by a barrier.

I almost died that day. Be safe. I don't use that remote anymore. Just something to think about. There are people who use the remote and it's fine for them. I bought that remote for $30 + shipping, I bought my 2.4ghz mini remote for half that. My favorite remote.

a single drop in my opinion is not reliable.  Not as bad as kama/wiiceiver obviously, but that drop when you need to brake or accelerate to avoid something...  

The spread spectrum hopping 2.4 on GT2b is ultra reliable.  Once you re-enclose in smaller form factor it's very pocketable.  Not too hard to do (i was able to...).

Honestly, I don't think it was a drop, I think it had to do with my ESC cutting out, but I'm not sure. MUCH better than the nano remote. I like the GT2B other than the size, I like the mods too. Some people aren't comfortable modding their own remote though.

In terms of alternatives the gt2b actually looks bad ass. But it's also I size of a brick and carrying that around through trains, buses etc. might get tiresome. However if it's in stock on hobby king it might be worth investing either as a spare or a bench test remote for later builds.

Understood.  I figure if i can do it others can too.  I did a walk-through quite a while back, in case it helps.  Specific to the badwolf v2.  It has pretty thin walls though, so i'd suggest the mad munkey or master cho if you like trigger.  baby buffalo if you like thumb.

Just a brief update. I'm still undecided on what deck to use. However if I used something like Carvon hub motors I could use one of my existing cruiser decks and save some money. The only issue I can see myself running into is fitting a pre-build battery under the board. I'd still rather avoid using LiPO so I can charge the board while I'm out and about. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
