Hey guys just thought i'd start a build thread for my EBoard i'm building for my year 12 major work in electronics.It has:
- SK3-6364 190kv
- 16/36 Gear ratio
- 10S 8000mah Zippy FlightMax's
- BatterySupports' 60A 10S BMS
- 8-58V Step Down Converter to 5V 3A to charge devices (eg remotes and phones)
- 4A Fast Charging (2x2A chargers in parallel)
- 100mm Abec Clones from TorqueBoards
- TorqueBoards Caliber Trucks i bought off a Mate
- Custom designed 3D Printed enclosure

(I will be attaching the enclosure to the board with fibreglass)

Here are some pics:

What does everyone think?

I was thinking about a usb port for charging my lights on the board (micro usb rechargable) and my phone if needed.  Can you provide more information on the step down and how this works. Looking good man!

hey man, so pretty much i ordered one of these:
https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com.au%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F141871702338
I then soldered an XT-90 connector to the end of it and connected it to the parallel adapter i made. This allows the vesc to still be used, as well as the usb step down. I also soldered a small SPST switch in series for just the down converter so that it doesn't always use power when my board is on.
Hope this helps ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
- Matt

Could you link the charger you're using? Does it have CC CV?

@TiMMaTTie I'm not sure what you mean by cc and cv but here's the link: 
 https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com.au%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F152636985195
2 of these in parallel result in a 4a charging speed, charging my 8ah battery's in 2hrs

What's the C rating? How is the torque?
```

## \#8 Posted by: mynamesmatt Posted at: 2018-07-17T03:26:19.077Z Reads: 134

```
the c ratings 30C constant and 40c peak so 240a constant (which is completely unnecessary as eboards rarely draw more than 35a) and 320a peak. Im yet to test the torque when my enclosures completed

Update on the board, I've connected the enclosure to the board after sanding and fibreglassing the board. I bolted the enclosure to the deck and then fibreglassed all 4 sides to make it flush with the deck. Also, i test connected the BMS and batteries and nothing went poof so we're fine. Also, I've pulled my volt testers apart and wired one up to connect to the battery.

Cool build! 

Is that deck what I think it is? How is it? How's the flex with your weight?

If you're from Australia and you think it's the kmart deck then you're completely right! Out of the box the deck had little to no flex at all. After I've done about 3 layers of fibreglass (with another 2 or 3 to come), attached the enclosure with nuts and bolts, there is pretty much no flex at all. For vibration dampening i 3d printed some 10mm risers in TPU (a flexible filament) which behave like a soft rubber. I also have 100mm Abec Clones and they are going to absorb alot of the shock

@mynamesmatt, how about this to dampen the vibrations?

@Grozniy yeah i saw that last week, looks like an awesome idea, might incorporate it under my grip tape

Update on the board, added a coat of black epoxy on one side of the board in a way that it levels itself over the bumps and whatnot. Also did some test fits of the components and everything looks great so far
Also used some acrylic and laser cut it to size to make a lid for the enclosure. (also etched a cool design in cause why not)

Another update. Coated the other side with epoxy and let to to set overnight and in the sun during the day. Chucked the trucks on the deck with the risers and measured that i still have a good 50mm of ground clearance which I'm pretty happy with. I then put only the anti spark loop key, the batteries, the vesc and the motor on to give it a quick test. It works AWESOME! only got it moving slowly because it was late at night but IT'S SO MUCH FUN!

After this project is submitted i will most likely invest in another vesc and 6364 and make it a diagonal dual motor board

well, update, the torque for a single motor board is pretty good. Id compare it to a BGT on 97mm's in fast mode. Its pretty strong. i'm running it at 42a battery amps and 65 motor amps so
