For those who have built their enclosure for their e-boards themselves how did you access the electronics? I just have a "lid" on top of the enclosure and planning on adding a door hinge on one side then I need some way of keeping the lid down. Does anyone have any great ideas on how to do this? all I can really think of is screwing it down then I can just unscrew it when needed but that means I will need a Philips head or flat head screwdriver.
does anyone have any good ideas? anything is welcome.

hope i explained it well.

Thanks!

for one build i use it to secure my lid, as screws eventually strip out of mounting positions. in another build i use it to keep it all my electronics on my board no issues. its industrial grade. again i dont put weight on the enclosure i try to keep everything fixed to the board

strong enough to hold your lid. I'm not sure what you're working with. Just the idea of magnets should spark some ideas.

they have the holes in a way where you can slide and lift the enclosure to remove it, so you just use screws but have easy removal

I tried snap on hinges. Can't say it's the best thing ever but works pretty well. 
Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhd67uX8Gu8). At the 23:33 he has the two bar bolted onto the board with the strap going underneath the bar and secure the batteries together. I think that's a neath idea. Put less stress on the enclosure if he decided to put on one.

Just an idea, but if there were something along the similar lines of a bicycle seat post clamp (without most of the circular clamp part), secured by something like a riv nut/nutsert, it might be a way to  conveniently open and close bottom facing enclosures.
