Hey just wanted to get some input, things look pretty tight, do you guys think it will be ok? Is my wheel to close to the idlers? ![20190406_215655|375x500](upload://tvdAB4vct8ULJQTEBgmZCkPAxfZ.jpeg) ![20190406_215641|375x500](upload://hPUoKyG7gSep8drXSTNvpoI1i3l.jpeg)

none of those components have any lateral play so you should be good. I would put a spacer in between the idler and mount though so the surface of the bearings touch the belt completely

The problem with putting a spacer there is that i would need a longer bolt and if it was any lo ger it would run into my wheel

in a perfect world you want the full surface area of the belt in contact with the idler.

otherwise your going to run into a warped belt...

what if you insert the bolt the other way along with getting a longer bolt? I'd assume the bolt head is thinner than the nut no?

Does that wheel pulley rub against the mount? Looks close

I had some noise on my ride today and I noticed it was my (3d printed) pulley just a bit too close to my mount. Just thought I'd mention it. Took me a bit to figure out where the noise was coming from

Dumb question....but since my motors are sensored, does it matter what irder i hook up the motor leads?

```
No as long as you do detection. Theres 3 sets of combinations that will make the motor spin one way and 3 sets that will make it spin the other. You can always change this in software as well

Better tight then loose, if there is a lot of resistance on the movement of the wheel, you got a problem
