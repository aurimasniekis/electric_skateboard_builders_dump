It can only handle 50a max, so it wonâ€™t be great if your thinking of dual drive

4 years ago I bought 10 mountainboards and this is the battery it came with.   Never had issues unit recently but granted I've been abusing it for a very long time.    If diye makes the same its worth a try.   Just saying I had almost 4 years of fun and lot of upgrades that tested the batteries limits.   Beware though a cutout of a battery at high speeds can be deadly.    If I was a cat I have 5 more lives.

what bushings are you using in those truck springs?

edit: duh, it's right in the title. How much do you weigh and would you go lighter or stiffer if you could?
