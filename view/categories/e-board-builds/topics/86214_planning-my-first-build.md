I posted this on reddit r/ElectricSkateboarding but didn't really get much response. 

Here is what I posted.

"I want to make/convert my longboard into an electric, what DIY kits would you guy's recommend?

* I am about 90 kg (200 lbs)
* I don't need much top speed I'd rather want torque.
* I want a decent ride time (out of each charge) though I don't really know what is considered decent :)
* I don't want to break the bank
* I have a 3D printer (if that helps lower the cost)
* I was thinking about using my RC car transmitter (unless that's not considered safe/good practice)
* I'll be using it on paved bike/walkpaths.

I think that lists up all my points, like I say I have a 3D printer but not sure how useful it will be in this project, if 3D printed motor mounts are strong enough etc."


I own an ebike and two batteries for it they are 36v 8.7 Ah pretty bulky but could be mounted on top of the board. I guess they could be run in parallel but was hoping one would be enough since they are pretty big L: 17 cm (7") W: 10 cm (4") H: 8 cm (3.1") Weight: 1.90 kg (4.2 lbs)
Also don't want to ruin them since they are used on my bike :slight_smile: 

What would you guy's recommend for a first build? I said on reddit that the budget was 300$ but that seems way too optimistic. I'd like to be able to start "small" and have the option to upgrade if I really get into the hobby.

Add a motor mount from @Boardnamics.
Maybe use a flipsky vesc instead of the hobby king.
Keep an eye on esk8 market  place. Used items pop up at great prices.
I probably have extra abec clones and pullys i could sell you cheap.
