Just finished my first build.

I wrecked my old Dual Plus V2 Boosted Board; & decided to repurpose the parts!

Specs: 
Deck; MBS Core 16 Mountainboard 

Trucks; MBS Matrix II

Hubs; back: Five Star MBS, front: Three Star stock

Motors; (2) V2 Dual+ Boosted motors

Wheels:
Stock MBS 8” pneumatic mountainboard tires.

Sprockets; (2)11 tooth #25 roller chain sprockets.
(2) 74 tooth rear drive sprockets.

#25 roller chain.

Motor mounts are made of miscellaneous hardware obatained from the local store; (2) L-Brackets fastened via (2) U-bolts to the axle.

1/4” threaded rod for horizontal support.

Stock MBS bearings.

Battery; Boosted Extended Range battery.

VESC; stock V2 Dual + 

Remote; stock Boosted remote.

Headlight; 1000 Lumen Milwaukee flood lamp with rechargeable battery.

Headlamp; 12000 Lumen offbrand from Amazon.

Performance:

Range:
So far the range is not very good; average of 4-5 miles on a charge.

Speed:
Top speed seems to Be about 24mph

Torque:
Seems about the same as the original V2 Boosted Board.

Many upgrades to come!
I.E - Homemade 10S16P battery, upgraded 6374 3300 watt 200kv motors.

New VESC coming.

LED Light strips

Any tips for centering the drive sprockets better are appreciated!

I’ve attached a short video of the first test ride.

Nice build. Did you mean to say 10s16p or 10s6p battery? Because 10s16p is a huge battery. People get 30+ miles of range on 12s8p, so that would give you some crazy range, but it would also be a massive battery. I love that you repurposed old boosted parts. Also, putting dual 6374s will give you so much power, and so much fun!

All 18650’s

4 runs of 10 cell packs on bottom; stacked 3 packs deep & 4 stacks of 10 cell packs on top of the board.

I love that you repurposed the boosted board but you may want to get bigger motors cause this baby motors looks so funny and may affect the performance of your board.

Working on That, one piece at a time; although, these motors are doing surprisingly well!

I just ordered some motors, batteries and a motor mount.

Probably just a typo but just in case. Those are the original matrix trucks not matrix 2 hopefully you ordered motor mounts for the Matrix not matrix 2.

Thanks for the info; another member corrected That and is making them for me.
