I have a friend willing to sell his BB in order to do DIY route, however he doesn't have the tools or time to do a new one by himself. He would like to purchase the parts himself or buy it directly from the builder if the price is right.

Here are the board specs he need:

- Loaded Vanguard
- Custom 10S4P Samsung 25R
- Divided enclosures as BB
- 2 6355 motors
- 2 VESC
- Caliber 50 trucks
- 100mm MTB wheels
- 13/36T pulley aluminum pulley kit
- Enertion remote
- Zealous bearings
- Antispark switch

I'd help him with the build but I live in Peru and he is currently in SOCAL.

Are there any thrustworthy builders around this area?,

i can do a bild like that ive never done mountain board wheels but i do have a 3d printer so i could vacuum form an enclsure, the battery can be done by @barajabali or me but I am really only accustomed to flat besides that I think I could do it, @psychotiller is in socal so maybe he could if not me?

My services are for hire, keep in mind I am in NORTH California. Shipping would end up being 1 or 2 day. He also can always reference my website for more details on One of the builds I provide.

Thanks for the mention, but this build isn't going to be that great with the parts listed. I'm out. Why not just keep the boosted?

Well I think this will be able to bigger hills with those 6355, I usually think that people make this build when they want the look of BB but don't want only BB Performance.

@Psycotiller If you suggest something better I'm all ears.

The Boosted would be in Peru so he wants to keep one in Peru and another with more power and range in SOCAL.

How do you fit a 10s4p with bms and HV switch into a split case like boosted has?
I have never ridden a booted board but I do ride a board with dual 6355's and 10s 
and judging from the boosted boards I've seen around, I don't think mine is that much faster.
Just a lot more range.
I think if you want a lot more power then you might need to consider a 12s battery.

@EBoosted - We could help too except for the pack. Bara can help with a custom pack.

Most of all our parts are plug and play. Seems like we have everything you've listed. We also just moved to Texas so no need to pay CA tax for your friend :)

@Namasaki

In this array you can fit a 10s4p on a loaded vanguard split enclosure.

Hey @barajabali he's definitely going to need a battery and I'm suggesting to buy it from you on the exact same array. 

Will keep you updated as soon as he pulls the trigger, BTW your battery is working perfectly!

I'm happy to help my friend! just let me know when and we can get going on it. 

That board is beautiful btw. I might want to get those STL files from you to make my own. I have a vangaurd deck laying around that i could use.   Do you own the files?

The boosted like enclosure was designed by @jackw

I designed the battery array in order to fit a 10S4P:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/DoSvr1x.jpg[/img]

I 3D printed myself locally:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/2apy4Ny.jpg[/img]
[img]http://i.imgur.com/bHt5lD1.jpg[/img]

...but later I found out I needed more capacity in order to make room for the XT90, wiring, battery display and switch

[img]http://i.imgur.com/vdv3p8F.jpg[/img]

So, I used the 3D print in order to create a completely new flexible fiberglass enclosure, with a slightly bigger capacity.

[img]http://i.imgur.com/ZToAbfO.jpg[/img]

I sent my design to @barajabali and asked to build me the pack. I told him exactly what I needed, he was very professional and after I sent him some sketchy pictures he understood the design perfectly, he also kept me informed with the progress:

[img]http://i.imgur.com/GH03EEK.jpg[/img]
[img]http://i.imgur.com/du7GLXF.jpg[/img]

Then I printed the VESC enclosure from the thingiverse public design:

[img]http://i.imgur.com/mSDhrwZ.jpg[/img]

...but again it was too small, two VESC didn't fit in there, so I had to make an enclosure myself in fiberglass again.
