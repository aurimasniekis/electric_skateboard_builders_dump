Hi, I run a build thread on endless-sphere ([url=click here to see]https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=79241[/url]) and decided to show my finished build also here. I started gathering parts for this build in December but did not have enough time to push it forward till easter, I spent them in my workshop and have done most of the work. 
Here are technical details of this build:
2x EMAX 5345 170 KV 63mm outrunner motors
2x Ollin board company VESC
Trampa long 35 with vertigo trucks, superstar wheels and ratchet bindings
Underwater Kinetics 206 Ultrabox and 309 Drybox
So lets start with the photos:

Bare board   :D

As You can see 4 5000 mAh 6S turnigy lipos fit nicely in 309 Drybox case.

The problem with the motors was that stator and rotor was held by this round piece of aluminium with set screw, I did not like the look of it, and it would interfere with motor mount not allowing to tension the chain properly so I decided to turn new shafts, with grooves for circlips.

Here You can see the shaft getting keyway milled, I don't trust small set screws enough ;)

And final product:
[img]/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/6ce53d711fb3f3940dde1c9b3544d8f0649f515c.jpg[/img]

Then I bored, keywayed, drilled and tapped sprockets to fit nicely on the motor shafts

After that I had to deal with how to fit all of this electronics and other stuff in this small 206 Ultrabox, it's easy to fit 2 VESCs in there, but 2x VESC + 4x 2200 uF caps + IXFN200 N07 MOSFET + 200A shunt for ampmeter circuitboard + 200A fuse + circuitboard mosfet switch for front LED light it's a bit more challenging, so I decided to mill aluminum mounting plate for all of this, which acts a radiator for VESCs lower mosfets.

And the last, most challenging part was to mill motor mounts, I had few attempts since January, but failed every time... until this weekend. I hope Jenso from E-TOXX does not mind my strong inspiration with his design, but... It's just the best solution for this task  :D 
Aluminum I used is 15mm thick 7075 grade, I guess it's strong enough  :P 

Here are photos from manual machining process in chronological order:

I'm not a machinist and the milling process took me about 20 hours...

I still have to mill 3 support braces for motor mounts.
Unfortunately I trashed 2 sprockets which I planned to use for rear wheels during machining, have ordered new ones, I need them to measure the lenght of support braces for motor mounts.

And here is front light, It's super bright and has long range, I made special mounting plate for it to not have to drill in the deck.

Oh, and I would forget, my friend wanted to have some fun with borrowed camera so he came to my workshop and interfered in my work, wanting me to do unnecessary things, to record them (burning titanium chips was not the part of eMTB build  :D )

Update, today I installed hall sensors and termistors in both motors, had to mill stator a little to fit SS411A sensors. They're spaced 120 degrees apart. Width of sensors is 4.05 mm and the milled gap is 4 mm wide, pretty tight fit, they're glued with epoxy and secured by kapton tape, termistors are glued with thermally conductive glue, nothing should get in rotors way.

Milled stator

Additional material from inside of sprockets was cut with jigsaw.
Here is milling process in few photos:

I'll bead blast sprockets and hot blue them to prevent from rusting (motor sprockets too).

Motor mounts finally finished! I milled support braces today, bead blasted everything and will give it to get anodized. Sprockets will be chemically hot blued (and be black as a result).

Managed to finish this beast today! It's AWESOME, love VESC and BLDC tool for programming, it's not so difficult as it looked at the beginning. Speed, power and handling, really impressive. As it was already dark when I was ready to test it, for now are only pics in artificial light, it does not show the beauty of this black anodized mounts. I'm really happy how it turned out, and I learned a lot!

And now of course some pics :P

Here is how I mounted battery case to the deck, I cut rubber spacers out of 5mm thick rubber, and made special treaded plates out of steel, protruding nut could damage battery. Rubber allows deck to flex and dampens vibrations.

I have to say, your builds are always so professional. I think it inspires everyone to make their boards look nicer. Not everyone has access to some of the tools you have but as long as we make our boards to the best we can with our tools at hand, esk8 builds will continue to look better and better. Good on you, continue making awesome boards.

what does it weigh?

SO what is the final battery configuration? 12S 10AH? so 440WH? 

what is the average power consumption on this beast?

Thanks! This thing is heavy, I don't have currently any weight to measure, as I'm in Cracow where I study, but I suppose it's arround 16 kg, I'll check that on weekend. Final battery configuration is 12S 10AH, so yeah, 440 Wh. Again, I didn't have chance yet to measure exactly power consumption, it's my first day with this beast :D

I have 3 sets of motor sprockets, right now with the 12 teeth sprocket arround 58 km/h, two other I have are 10 teeth and 14 teeth, but I'll have to change chain also for the larger one, there's not enough tension range. 14 teeth is calculated for 67 km/h, yeah, I'm nuts! :D I must say that with hall sensors the breakes are unbelievable, I had to break really hard during my second commute today and wheels stopped, lost traction and I crushed on asphalt. Climbing steep hill with sensors is also not a problem.

Ok I have first data, distance 13km of REALLY fast riding, 6000 mAh consumed (I charge packs as 4 6S connected in parallel, charger showed 12000 mAh, but on board they're connected in series by 2 of those 6S 5000 mAh bricks, so in 12S config it's 6000 mAh as I wrote).

@chaka Those motors are really nice, only thing I found as a problem was this piece holding the motor together, circlip works better and is smaller. I read at ES somewhere that one of users had a problem with those motors cogging, that's why I added hall sensors.

@MasterCho Aliexpress, this model was sold as capable of measuring current up to 500A, the shunt that came with it was HUGE, I replaced it with smaller 200A one, there is a lot of current/voltage versions of this. [url="click here"]http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Battery-Indicator-Tester-Battery-Voltage-Current-Power-Capacity-Charging-time-Digital-Monitor-Meter-Coulometer/32461792151.html[/url] 

Anyways, I was just playing arround and riding board forward and backward with no load in my flat when all of a sudden sometning blew up inside electronics case and smoke showed up. Inspection showed that my super high current rated (200A) mosfet IXFN200N07 blew up, VESCs and everything else look fine, even 200A fuse is intact. Damn, this scared me... I guess it's because of regen breaking, I left it as default at 20A...  :worried:

Is it your switch/in-rush controller that blew? If it was, I have some kicad files I have been working on for a mountainboard switch with 4 mosfets that uses EV grade fuses, the bolt on type. I plan on incorporating an sbec/ubec into the switch at a later date with a separate fuse for aux systems. I will be looking for testers once I get the gerbers sent to oshpark for fabrication.

@chaka Yup, my diy sparkless switch. I used 4 mosfets in my longboard, but I doubt It had regen breaking (flier ESC) and they're fine there, but wanted something more durable, able to disspat more heat and with bolt on connectors. So I've chosen this IXFN200N07 mosfet. I guess if I've turned off regen in BLDC tool it wouldn't happen, I would like to replace it with something in the same SOT227B package, as I have already all wiring and holes in my support plate redy for that. I'm analysing datasheet now, it looks like 2 source connection terminals blew up, I think that's regen breaking fault.
here's datasheet if anyone feels like could help.

Just quick thought: If I would connect diode capable of conducting this 20A (dual VESC so 40A regen) from drain back to source (opposite to normal conductance direction, which is from source to drain) of this mosfet this should prevent something like this from happening, as this current would bypass this mosfet and flow by diode, which would not conduct in normal conditions because would be placed opposite to conducting direction. If anyone is more familiar with electronics than me, some input would be welcome  :wink:

F*** it! I ordered the same mosfet and 40A diode. Gonna give it a try

Range is gonna be tremendous with that config, but I'm just not sure if would like to batteries under mountainboard deck. Clereance is what You want in Your E-MTB. Or You would have to protect batteries with some kind of super durable enclosure, there is only one "BUT", mountain boards are flexy, it makes building firm enclosure impossible as it would just simply break. Wish You very best, I'm just curious how are You gonna solve this.

is this the switch circuit you have? https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=40142&start=100

maybe @blasto might be able to answer the question about the diode for redirecting current around fets.

Something similiar, I used it in my boosted build and it works really well there, had not had any issues with it.  Here is the scheme of the circuit I used. It pretty much works for any N-channel mosfet, and this part of it is the only limitation. The other advantage of this circuit is that once latched state is sustained even if the switch connectors are not latched, so this circuit may use 2 momentary switches, one for turning it on, one for turning it off, or one latching with NO/NC/C  connectors.

I don't have any better ideas for now how to solve this issue except this solution with diode as a shunt to bypass mosfet if the current goes the other way than normally, seems logical to me :laughing: components should arrive today.

@squad The diode inside the body of your fet should be fine, it could handle up to 200A. Having an external one won't hurt, but i'm not sure if it would be useful.

Do you have a **zener** diode on the gate of your fet? if you are putting the battery voltage exceeding 30V on the gate, this could blow the fet after some time.

@blasto Yup, there is zener diode in the circuit, as seen on the scheme 10V one.  Then if the internal diode of the mosfet should handle current from the regen breaking, I'm starting to wonder, why would this fet blow up? I was testing driving direction change with nunchuck, and changing direction of motor rotation when the board was still rolling in the opposite one, in that exact moment it blew up... As You can see the terminals that blew up were both source, not the gate.

That fet only has around 500 watts of dissipation. Believe it or not, we use between 1000 to 1500 watts when accelerating hard.

@chaka Yup I know that, but the power it has to dissipate is the consequence of its internal resistance, which is 6 mili ohms, not so much, so this fet shouldn't even get hot. Surface mounted fets usually have less power dissipation like 300-400W. I mean that if the mosfet would have to dissipate this 500W it would mean 500W power loss in the circuit.

Wonder if a overvoltage cause this failure, especially during a direction change. I know i blew a fair amount of vescs during a direction change, had to brake first then change the direction. Not sure if the vesc is emplemented this way (well i know it's not when controlled by ppm)

The fet you got is obsolete (check the datasheet, not for new designs). Could opt for the 100v version

I already packed it in the envelope to send it to chaka, maybe he'll snap pic. Traces on board simply evaporated, first place is between mosfet source and shunt, near P4 pad. Second one between two mosfets drains, on the opposite side of the board. Ordered 2 new ones, and hope to get this one fixed, I'll probably install it in my longboard.

Update: I'm still waiting for 2 new VESCs from chaka, (the one damaged will be repaired by him) in the meantime I decided to solve the problem of scratched support brace, I designed new one and milled it out of 12mm thick 7075 aluminium. It just needs to get anodized New one has 2 casters on bearings, it acts as wheelie-bar in drag racing :D

The build is awesome! Just one thing about the max speed, unfortunately, the speed tracking because is GPS based, is not reliable when you invert direction, the GPS thinks that you traveled forward more than you actually did and then at the end of the inversion, when it re-picks the signal after the position adjustment you get increased lenght traveled, thus increased speed and that massive spike in the chart, I guess your max speed on flat and smooth ground is around 45km/h maybe? Which is still impressive for me considering that I freak out on flat ground at 30 km/h already :)

SO... recently I sorted out all problems, learned to replace drv chips on my VESCs (which failure causes 90% of vesc problems :D ) and now am just enjoying ride. Had some offroad fun today, it's really impressive how steep hills this board can handle. My passive VESC cooling system seems to work fine, idea is similiar to @chaka high output VESC. My observations show that with 12/60 gearing, with 10Ah 12S Lipo batteries, riding really hard, few hills here and there, I get roughly 20km range while discharging each cell from 4,18 V to 3,8-7V. I think that's really decent, pneumatics are not most energy efficient to get them rolling, they generate some serious rolling resistance compared to urethane longboard wheels. 

Here are some pics from my evening ride.

Nice that you are back on the road.

The air pressure on the tires affect the efficiency. You'll get better battery range by inflating the wheels at 55 psi almost at the maximum. because when disconnecting the air nozzle from the tire you'll lose a little air and that can make the difference. Give it a try. 

you can try 15mm pulleys and belt, the ride and range will improve a lot.

I already pumped those tires at 55 psi ;) As to belt drive... I don't see it perform as good as chaindrive in offroad boards, there is lots of debris, small rocks that may get between pulley and belt, and even get embedded in aluminium pulleys, I'll stick with chaindrive. With 2 swappable packs, a 45-50 km range is more than enough for me :D My charger shows that today, after riding 20km, I drew about 3500 mAh from each of four 6S 5Ah bricks I use as as single battery pack, so there was some juice left.
```

The swappable battery pack is nice. 

On The belt so far I'm liking them more each day, before I had that impression of the little rocks getting in the pulley but after using it for about 200km not even once I had something get in the drive system. 

Besides when you get a flat tire on the road is more easier to change the belt drive wheel, just unscrew one nut and swap the spare in, with the chain this was a long walk home or have to unscrew the motor in order to release the chain. 

Now days I just use the chain drive on specific occasions I know the terrain will be extreme. 

But that's just a preference, what I really like is seeing more people on eMTB, the ride is more smooth and not having to worry about cracks, sticks, rocks and others stuff on the way. To me this is more relaxing experience. 

Keep up the good work :slight_smile:

I have my chains connected by master link, so I can unclip it for wheel change. Anyway I'm really impressed by the terrain this board can deal with, it's simply awesome. Only downside of riding eMTB on a road is how fast tires wear out, after about 200 km, I see that about 50% of tread has worn out, and spares cost $$$ :D I'm ordering budget slicks and gonna give trampa primo alpha a shot.

Ok so I had another failure while ago, while jumping off a curb as a result of vibration short happened in one motor, and in consequence of that one VESC failed (burned traces on pcb... probably drv chip died first) ... I bought VESC circuit board from ebay and resoldered all components except drv chip, which I replaced with new one, will find out soon how this worked out. I tried to salvage motor by coating windings with epoxy, but it didn't help. New motor is on its way, I'll coat it with epoxy when it comes to me. I tried to disassemble motor to see if I'll be able to rewind it but couldn't get this alu bearing housing front cap out of stator... Here is result of coating windings with epoxy, I highly recommend it, vibration is a bitch...

Here are motors prepared for epoxy coating, I coated alu front caps with frekote, so epoxy wouldn't stick to it.

Today I received 2 fresh maytech electric skateboard 12S sensored ESCs, they look really nice and will be replacing VESCs in my EMTB.

 Chaka offered help at the beginning but then turned his back towards me and said he'll be not doing anymore business with me, so summing up he didn't repair any ollin VESC of mine. Funny thing is he even offered to replace the one that was fried but, obviously, didn't deliver. So myself as well as few (or maybe more?) people are on ollinboard company black list :joy::joy::joy:

This light has one big advantage, it can be supplied with 50V, from Your 12S, so no need to step down voltage or use additional pack, it's controlled via antispark switch I made, but You can as well use normal switch.

Blown is an understatement. This guy knows how to fry a pcb proper. Funny how he somehow forgot to mention all the previous repairs I did for him. I suggest you look into why you continue to short circuit the vesc before you blow more hardware. Your refusal to do so was why I discontinued service. If you would have at the very least humored me with the possibility that something else was wrong with your system I would have continued to repair your VESC's. 

This last repair you sent was the last straw though. You simply said the VESC was throwing fault codes.... When I received the VESC it would not even power on due to a short and some vaporised traces.:expressionless:

Get your system in order and I will be happy to help you once again but I can't keep sending VESC's to their death.

yea, there are resins that can take the heat. I used some air grade resin once that, after tempering, was robust up to 120degree, otherwise only to 60!

think wires are usually coated with some enamel. hm, Ill read up on that later tonight :)

Nice ! 
I'll recommend to get 2 fan and put them on top of the heat sink, there is a chance of them getting damage by over heating. This are the best ESC for eMTB you'll find once you take care of the over heating issue.

First thing that came to my mind was: "Too bad they're not anodized black".
Did you check their temp after a ride? I think you should really consider modifying the case for proper heat dissipation.

I have not rode board with these ESCs yet, waiting for remote, I'll check how is the temp inside, if it'll get to hot maybe I'll cut holes in the lid and mount there custom alu radiators, they will be sitting on top of both ESCs when box is closed. There's no room for fans, every last bit of space is occupied by wires and stuff. I would like to avoid simply making holes in this waterproof box as it would compromise this main feature of it :D

Boosted and Evolve both use radiators seal-fixed through the outer shell, which makes fans unnecessary and also there's more space inside, where radiators could have been. But yeah, their cases are not designed to be opened often.
Happy riding!

Not yet, waiting is killing me, yellow man from aliexpress chose possibly slowest way to ship it, lao post, it will probably take 3 weeks for it to arrive, and last update from "tracking" (it's hard to call it that way as there is no updates) is from 19th... By hot how hot exactly do You mean @barajabali? I really don't want to cut holes in the  enclosure, only possible way I see it is to mount custom milled radiators in the lid, and they sit on top of ESCs and dissipate heat. 

I paid 320$ with shipping for two and 15$ for programming wire

@barajabali I have thought through what You said, and to prevent ESCs overheating I came up with a little bit different solution than I initially planned ;) ESCs radiators are really close to the lid of the case, so I milled holes in the lid and I'm going to mount there two 40mm 3W fans, ESC SBEC is able to provide 12V 5A so one of them is going to power up fans, the other one receiver. I'm going to seal this gap between lid and radiator with one sided foam tape, so no debris/water can get inside. Here's how it looks for now.

Hi, thanks! I bought those switches on elfa.se, they are in eu and sell to every eu country. Those are latching vandal-proof switches, this is the "key word" while searching those. Keep in mind, that those switches are connected to anti-spark switches and only "logic" really low current flows through them, main current flows through roboust mosfet in SOT-227 case.

@paragon I didn't have time lately, forgive my delay in reply. Those ESCs have some "punch" when compared to VESC, breaking is not as precise as in VESC+nunchuck, but that may be due to short nano remote thumbstick travel. I had problem with setting ESC and motor in sensored configuration, as I noticed that starting from stand still wasn't smooth as butter and it turned out one of my hall sensors was dead and gave constantly 5 V instead of 0 and 5, as magnetic poles change, this canfused ESC. I changed this faulty hall sensor and now both motors are in sensored mode, today I will see how it performs compared to sensorless operation.

Today I tested my set up in sensored mode, and this thing works like a dream! Starting from stand still in high grass or on a steep hill? -No problemo, no cogging, no hesitation, just pure power transferred directly to your wheels! I highly recommend those Maytech 12S 120A ESCs, and keep in mind that they reveal their true potential with sensored motors. In my personal opinion, current version of VESC, 4.XX is suitable rather for e-longboards than eMTBs, what You want in an eMTB is powerrr, and Your motor needs to get lots of current to deliver it, VESC simply can't output such current as this ESCs do. 

Everything about this eMTB is nearly perfect in my opinion, even temperature activated fans start working when ESCs get hot, and they provide necessary to cool them air circulation around radiator ribs, and they turn off when their work is done.
I find this board to be eye pleasing, aesthetic, this was my main goal from the beginning.
Lightbar with flood beam allows you to ride at night, and looks sick at the same time.

It's more a kind of a touring eMTB than Jenso racing-performance ones, I'm fine with it. Easy to change sprockets allow me to change gearing and achieve different top speed/torque ratios. I'm mostly using middle ones from my set, with 14/60 gearing, spare ones are 12/60 and 16/60, keyway on a shaft with circlips hold sprockets tight even if the gub screw is not tightened.

After months of struggling with this project I can finally say: "It's finished!"

Thanks for shematics. Looks like a relatively simple circuit. 

Did you use 12v or 5v fans? 

Does that change resistor values? Im not that good in circuit electronics, so I probably have lots of extra questions about it.

One extra question would be - how exactly did you find the ''sweet spot'' for turning on the fan? Did you just tried to feel the temperature by hand and then tried to set the fan to start at this temp or you used some other equipment?

Second question would be - do you have to use a specific type of temp sensor or it does not matter? 

I've seen temp probes on laptop batteries and also regular outdoor electronic temp devices, although have not tested their resistance and don't know are they all the same for use in such circuit.

----

On a side note:

A while ago I found such a device, not sure how reliable it is, although seems to work in some applications:

http://www.ebay.com/itm/Plastic-Bimetal-45-130-Temperature-Control-Switch-Thermostat-Normal-Open-Close-/231726225774?var=&hash=item35f3f5996e:m:mUQTJpUCxZdmCniYBTJ4tFg

Looks like it is meant for use with 12v, too.

------

Sorry about all the questions but perhaps someone can benefit from this ''side feature'' the same as I do.. if there rises a situation for temp controlled fan control :)

My ESCs BEC was supposed to give adjustable voltage in range of 5-12V but max voltage I can choose in settings is 8,4V, so this is my voltage, fans are rated for 12V, I didn't change anything in the circuit, it's exactly as in this scheme. 

I found desired potentiometer value by mounting thermistor on an aluminium sheet piece with use of thermal conductive paste, and then heated this sheet with heat gun to about 50 degrees celcius (measured by laser thermometer), then set potentiometer so it would start working at this temp.

This circuit is designed to work with 10Kohms NTC thermistors, so any of those would work just fine. My thermistor is glued by thermal conductive glue between ESCs radiator ribs.

Those bimetal switches might work fine in this application, but one thing that would bother me is thermal conductivity of its case, it might require to try few of different temp variants of those to find the right one.

@BoardSportsRN forget about maytech cuz their service sucks! contact Jenny from fvt directly. She will put you in touch with the engineer that can help you. 

@Nowind about calibration, better off using the GT2b so u can calibrate the trim in the remote. 
 
Other than that once you get the correct firmware on them, they r the best esc I ever used. I feel like I'm riding a dirt bike now. Very smooth acceleration and braking. And it pops wheelies even with a 15 65 gearing. The esc is powerful.

Hi, SO, my mountainboard was laying dead and useless in my garage for the past few months. I couldn't find reliable ESC for it that would support 12S voltage and sensored motors.

-VESC 4.10- failed, constant problems with DRV chip, couldn't deliver enough POWER for an eMTB.
-Maytech 12S ESC, they were decent when worked, had punch, but I was unable to dial breakes in, even with updated FVT firmware, and one of them failed after a while of using, without any obvious cause (on flat ground, with minimal load on motors, they were abused much harder and I bombed some seriously steep hills offroad on them few days prior to this)

So I was left with pretty much no options left, BUT, FINALLY, @trampa opened preorder for VESC 6 beta batch, this seemed like right option for me.

I'm currently waiting for two of brand new VESC's 6, and to use this time in the right manner I milled custom mount/heatsink for dual set up, also simplified my wiring, decided to dump antispark mosfet switch and use simple XT90 anti-spark loop key (my custom fet switch drained two of my lipo batteries when I left it plugged in for a month or so in my garage, that's where my caster board got it batteries from).

Here is how my electronics case looks from outside now, it's water tight and should provide nice passive cooling.

https://i.imgur.com/idmgEvG.jpg

Also You can see on this pic I upgraded my chains and sprockets to #25HD, 6x2,8mm chains couldn't stand abuse.

UPDATE, I made special loop key for my board, used AS 150 connectors (xt-90s seemed to small for dual mountainboard setup) they're 7mm in diameter, it should be more than enough. Pins housing is made out of aluminium, and they're screwed in then soldered together, actual loop is just to be able to pull it out. 

http://i.imgur.com/HPxaPwf.jpg

Special housing for female AS 150 connectors was also made by me.

Everything inside electronics case is ready for two VESCs 6

This build is like bottomless pit :D I stopped counting after buying board, first VESCs 4.10, motors etc. It's rather impossible to count every spent $ right now, there's a part of me that doesn't like to know that anyway :unamused: (it's probably a few grand with all additional expenses like shipping, broken endmills etc.) There were some mistakes that could be avoided. HOPEFULLY, with VESC 6 I will have a robust, powerfull sensored 12S setup.

Thank you for the reply yeah I would love to tinker around and build my own board but I really​ don't want to spend no more then 800$ and I am impatient and I just wanna ride an AT E board like now :( 
I found this board on Amazon so I'm probably just going to buy it.

I believe it's really difficult to build no compromise board in this cost range. In the beginning of my eboards journey I thought: "yeah, of course it will be cheaper if I do it myself", but now I have no illusions, in most cases it WILL be more expensive than pre build board :D

I agree with Squad. DiY can be expensive in this hobby.  If you go the diy route, you're not buying parts that are massed produced so they are not so inexpensive. (They are produced in large batches, most likely, with various degrees of quality control.)  Also, all the other stuff like tools, consumables, fasteners, etc. really adds up.  But for most  that go the diy route it's really about enjoying the creation process and building something that is customized to your liking.

Mate the most expensive is to buy twice (-;
Your budget is so small, too small for a nice MTB
I would save some more money before i buy something like in the amazon link.

Go with a used Trampa, get @Idea ´s mounts, some SK3 Motors and Hobbywing ESC, Hobbyking Lipo ... just my 2 cents

I built an eMTB because i wanted something rock solid, would not break and handle almost any terrain. You can't cheap out on a board that is going to be up and down jump, kerbs, offroading etc. You will spend more time repairing that riding. 

Spend the money knowing you have something that is not going to fail at 20mph while siding through a forest. Its going to hurt hitting a tree that fast.

Hi, so the VESCs SIX arrived some time ago and yesterday I finally was able to mount them in my board. You know, exams and my broken forearm :joy: 

VESC tool seems like really user friendly environment, set up was really easy and quite intuitive. Finally NTC 10K thermistors I installed in my motors at the beginning of this build have purpose because VESC SIX monitors motor temp. 

Thanks to sketch Frank @trampa sent to beta users I prepared everything earlier and VESCs installation was piece of cake, I only had to bore top cover pcb holes to fit M5 screws. For now I have my motors set up in sensored FOC and precision of rpm control is superb. 

Unfortunately I won't be able to give it a test ride for few more weeks because I still have plaster cast on my forearm and wrist, since my casterboard crash.

As You can see below everything in my electronics box is packed tight :sunglasses: and VESCs should run cool because they're sitting on top of huge passive colled radiator.

This is going to be FUN, can't wait to give it a test ride :grin:

Oh man, it's really difficult to put certain price tag on this build, there was many of R&D trials, broken end mills and so on. I'm not able to give You total cost because I didn't keep track of it and as You could see in this build log not every solution worked flawlessly as it was supposed to, so there's lots of wasted money. In my case doing something full DIY does not mean to cut corners and reduce costs, I want to achieve pleasing result, functionally and aesthetically, which ends up costing more than any available solutions.

I used 10K NTC thermistors glued with heat conducting glue between stator ribs. AFAIK VESC 4.XX didn't support external temp sensors, maybe that will change with the newest version of VESC Tool and firmware upgrade from Ben for 4.XX VESCs.

I just had a chance to ride my board in pretty rough terrain today, and must say it finally became what I wanted it to be from the beginning. If VESC SIX would be arround when I stared this build I'd probably save some money even despite of its price. Ultimate eMTB controller, precise and powerful. This board gives me now feeling of safety, brakes are so smooth, not comparable to anything else on the market. @rpasichnyk Bluetooth module allowed me to log my ride, great app with great support 👍🏻 

https://metr.at/r/fc348

After the run me and the board were all covered in mud so I decided to test how well thought my design was and hosed it all down. Stainless hardware and watertight enclosures performed flawlessly.

Board after ride.

Today was another day of hard abuse, I tried some pretty hardcore uphill off-road at the beginning of this log but it was to wet and wheels didn't have enough grip, managed to throw few over current faults. Then I bombed the same path from the opposite side.

Brakes and acceleration are just how you want them to be, they can be really smooth if you gradually pushy the throttle but You can also do wheelie or burn rubber if you smash the lever really fast, same goes for brakes. And all of this was after default settings set with wizards. There is so much possibilities with VESC tool that you can have it set just the way you want.

@Riako I would record something if only I had some handy cam other than my iPhone, unfortunately I don't 😒

I was wondering the width. I have the same type Trampa @squad does, I measured the width about 2-3 inches down from the tip and it looks about 7 - inch wide.  Not sure.

I thought this from Amazon would do (it has a range of 12-24V):

https://www.amazon.com/OLS-Ultra-Slim-Single-1530lm-Waterproof/dp/B06XHV7GLP/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1506254345&sr=8-8&keywords=led+light+bar+7+inch&refinements=p_72%3A2661618011 

And just solder on an XT60 connector or what not to the end of the light. If it works great! I just need to give away the other light.

I ordered it from ovovs (Chinese producer) they list it on AliExpress, it's supposed to generate 18W, I use it with step down converter, at 12V (it can take up to 24 if I recall correctly). It was super cheap, like 10$, paid twice as much for shipping. The one from amazon looks just like it, but If you contact ovovs directly you can choose if you want flood beam or more focused one (I chose flood and it works perfectly for me). Factory brackets were to short for me (nose of the board was in the way)  I had to make new ones by myself.

I'll post some sick ridelogs and photos tonight, VESC SIX and my trampa got some real hardcore testing.

Allright so here is my ride log, I triggered over dozen of overcurrent faults, it was pretty rough uphill terrain, wheels struggled for grip and VESCs got quite warm.

My VESCs settings are: 
Motor current max 90A
Motor current max brake -80A
Absolute maximum current 150A
Battery current max 80A
Battery current max regen -60A

Motors are running in sensored FOC (FW 3.29), any suggestions what to adjust to avoid overcurrent faults (@trampa) ?

So here is the ridelog

https://metr.at/r/nZEM8

And now few pics from the trail, they show how my board gradually got covered in thicker and thicker mud layer.

Benjamin compiled a "High Current Sampling" mode which can be activated... 
I think you have to use the "No limit" FW ... after this you can set the Absolute Max Higher... up to 190A...
maybe that helps 

Also did you use some positive Ramping Time ? 
Set mine to "0" that gives me also more OverCurrents ...

Connect next time to Vesc-Tool and check for the Fault Codes...

My positive ramping time is 0,9s, default. Overcurrents happened when I tried to apply throttle and jumped the board a bit front in hope the wheels would find grip and I'd start rolling uphill. So the wheels were spinning midair and overecurrents happened on landing. I'll check out high current sampling mode, I see in my ridelogs battery current never exceeded 40A, and motorcurrent also stayed below 90A, so this is probably some glitch... 

Connecting to VESC tool to gather mode detailed data might be problematic, I only had this problem in kinda extreme uphill area, I doubt I could make it happen with my mac connected by usb cable :D 

@Riako Thanks! Terrain was really crazy, I took my girlfriend jeeping on that trail later that day, we almost got stuck in mud a little bit further than I reached by my trampa, but grand cherokee managed to overcome this difficulties. Today I left lots of mud on carwash floor :sunglasses:

Update from saturday, Me and Tom met again to ride some offroad trails this time. I honestly must say it was the best ride on an eMTB I had since finished this board, rough hilly terrain (but lots of dirt tracks, so we could hit throttle and have fun).

Small update, kingpin bushings on my trampa wore off and I had to replace them, I decided to turn new ones on my lathe out of phosphor bronze, it's self lubricating material which in my opinion should outperform plastic bushings.

I turned them on my manual lathe so it took some time to get them accurate. Only install was pain in the A$$ I made them a bit oversized and literally had to hammer those in place (plastic bushings are more forgiving in matter of tolerances). I must say I didn't have much chance to test those in long term performance, only had like one ride, no noticeable difference for me tho. 

Maybe @Nowind can add something more? I bet he also has more production capabilities than I do :D

Funny mine come out with some serious oversize too :joy:
I´m missing long therm expierences, but i´m looking forward to a good result...
Going now with special sintered bronze material... 

The question is how to handle the different flange thicknesses ???
Trampa offers them in 3 sizes from 1-1.5-2mm i guess..
If a potential customer dont know the needet size he will have to order all variantes or get maybe a not fitting bushing...
i would need 5€ per piece... would be okay if they hold up IMO, for me its not the price of the original parts but changing them on the driven Truck is a PITA and cost some time

Did you have an great Idea or a medium good Idea Brothers ? :grin:

@Cobber  
@DanSkates

you could to the distribution for Australia :sunglasses: 

its not that problem for me to do a batch but how we handle the differnt sizes

Your build is so well finished, congrats mate. Any chance you can provide me with the measurements for your motor mounts, braces and the "wheelie bar" (another brilliant idea btw)?

Cheers

Thanks! 🙏 I’m unable to help for this moment, I’m away from home and don’t have access to my computer where I have sketches (last semester and final exams,you know...). However I think they may not be much of a help for you, every dimension is determined by transmission you’re going to use. For example, my crossbraces would be to long for a belt drive, or even larger chain size set up (there would be not enough space between wheel and motor mounting plate). When You plan to do it all Yourself it’s simply the best to have all components of the drivetrain in hand and measure them, and start from there. Good luck
