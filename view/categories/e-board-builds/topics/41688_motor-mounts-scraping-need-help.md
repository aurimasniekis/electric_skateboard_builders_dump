I just got my awesome motor mounts in from @psychotiller today, and I cannot find a position where the end of the board either won't scrape the outside of the motor casing, or where the motor mount won't scrape the ground on small bumps. If anyone has run into this before, or has an idea on how to fix it, any help would be appreciated. Thanks!!

I just found a set of 107mm 74a Flywheels on eBay, so those will give me an extra 1cm, but I'm not sure that's going to be enough

The TKPS are lower than most tkp trucks on the market. Which gives you 3 choices.

1. Top mount that deck and raise the mounts up.
2. Figure out a way to plate the cutout and move your truck mount holes to the end of that deck, and then raise those motor mounts up!
3. Cut the tail end of that deck off. And raise those motor mounts up!

The third choice is my favorite if you have enough clearance under there for your enclosure.

@onepunchboard I'll look into those, I already have those Flywheels on order though

@psychotiller  These trucks are awesome by the way, and they feel great. I might have to switch to tighter bushings, but they're good for now. I was looking at the deck and it looks like I could cut the end off diagonally, which would let me get about 1cm more clearance. Right now I have almost exactly 1cm of clearance, so between those 1cm larger wheels, and cutting the end of the deck off I should triple my clearance. 

Does anyone know what the average clearance of these boards is? Also on an unrelated note do you know of a good enclosure that's about 24in x 7.5in x  or so? I need to fit a 10s5p pack as well as 2 FOCBOXes and a BMS

Yeah lol I just saw it, okay haha, so last dumb question, will the "signature low pro 24" fit all of that? I mean a measured everything out and it should be good. I just want to make sure I buy the right one.

you could flip the mount arm around so that the rounded edge is facing up and the pointed edge is facing down?

@pixelsilva are you trying to get a hold of @psychotiller? I think @psychotiller said he had to go make some more imaginary enclosures for that @ThermalM16 guy since @scepterr pointed out he makes flat plastic into shaped plastic

I thought about that, but the bottom of it protects the motor housing to an extent, so that would make the motor take 100% of the beating

I do know a guy! If you are rocking a flat pack (No stacked cells or anything piggybacking the pack, the signature low pro will fit everything. Make sure you have the flat area to accommodate 24" length though. If not, I can make it the length you need...Ask LHB's Mom

Hey! Those motors are from AliExpress, I'm high class :laughing:, but those motors are just until I get the hang of not crashing and eating shit haha. Then I'm placing an order for 200 6365 Maytech motors so I can get my custom color scheme on them. I guess I'll just have to throw the extra 198 out since I doubt anyone would want them :joy:

Hey I met her when I went to @longhairedboy s house. She is such a nice lady.  He's actually making my batteries into a pack right now haha. But yeah the pack is 25x2 cells, so like 450mm long by 36mm wide, not accounting for the nickel plate in between cells. Here's my board and the dimensions. As you can see, the ends bend a little, so it kind of messes everything up.

I have a couple ideas for a solution.
1. Move the the base plate all the way back to the end of the drop through slot and re-drill the mounting holes.
2. Taper the bottom edge of the deck.

I would say top mount them with a 1/8‚Äù riser. It‚Äôll still be low but you‚Äôll be able to bring the motors up a bit. I love those trucks!üòç

I thought about that, but there is a cutout inbetween the screw holes, and the two screws closest to where your foot would be, would have nothing to screw in to. Here's what I'm talking about.

I already thought of that...Make a plate to mount to. (out of metal)

I did some work on my drop through deck with a belt sander. Worked great for making motor wells. Sorry for the crumby pics. It‚Äôs all I have. 

I also routed out the top of the deck so the truck would sit flush with the deck too. In the pics it‚Äôs still top mounted.

Hey nice trucks! I was thinking of cutting the ends off like this on mine. They only scrape when I lean hard into a turn on it. Here's what I mean.

@psychotiller okay I was just making sure, I like the knuckles enclosure the most but I didn't think it was big enough for all of that. I think I'll just go with your Signature Low Pro 24". That should do everything I need it to do. My main concern was waterproofing. How hard do you think it will be to seal that one to the bottom of the deck with those weird bends at the ends?

Why don't I just make the enclosure a little shorter than 24". Then you don't have to worry about the drops.23?

Yeah that would help some, but even at 23" it'll still be on them. If the plastic is flexible enough it might still work though. I have a neoprene foam gasket I was planning on lining the seams with, so that may help if it's not completely flush with the wood

I cut the corners off and it's doing much better now. I have about 15-20mm more clearance under those mounts and 107 SuperFlys on the way. Between everyone's suggestions, my superior technique with a wood saw and sandpaper, and these dope trucks for motivation, I managed to make it look good, so far as you stand about 10 feet away :joy:

They come with badass motor mounts and you can customize the colors a ton if you want to. These trucks feel far better than anything I‚Äôve ridden on so far!
