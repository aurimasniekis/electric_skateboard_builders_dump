I'm thinking of using a Landyachtz Wolf Shark, which is a Hollowtech board. Wondering if you guys know if it'll be able to hold an enclosure? 

Anyone with personal experience? A search doesn't bring up many topics

I wouldn't want to screw anything in to the hollow sections...

Too beautiful to damage it with screws.

Taking a look, some of the older wolfsharks don't seem to be hollowtech. Is it just the new ones?

Can't look at that deck without picturing 18650s crammed in all those holes

Well hollowtech is there, to make your board lighter and add some steez.
There is really nnno functional advantage of using a hollowtech, it is more expensive, makes mounting stuff harder and you will not benefit from a lighter deck anyway.

Well I did it anyway! It was a second hand board so i wasn't too worried as I got it for a good price. Full album [https://imgur.com/a/hMU1O](https://imgur.com/a/hMU1O)

Didn't seem to have any issues and no different compared to other decks. I looked through the holes and it seemed solid? But much googling shows that this 2015 Wolf Shark is indeed Hollowtech. Maybe i just got lucky and drilled through the wood. It feels rock solid still.

You can make an enclosure that would be mounted to the trucks screws...something similar to mellow boards drive kit...

someone needs to make an adjustable enclosure that grips the edges of decks, kinda like those car tablet holders, no holes needed

You Sr. are a genius. I had the same thought but never occurred to ask. But now that you mentioned, you are correct. Is so simple. Someone who come with an adjustable enclosure that grips to the edges. Simple thinking to and old annoying problem. Sometimes screwing a beautiful board maybe avoidable, besides destroying the looks also weakens its structural integrity.

One word. Vibration. Mmm vibration.

Elaborate. One word is not enough. What would vibration do to an enclosure held on with metal clasps along the edge of a deck?

Vibration is everywhere. No matter how you look at it, something, somehow needs to be attached to the dam deck. Screws or not, velcro or not, flex case or not, no matter how you look at it, you need to strap something to the board to hold the electronics and batteries. There is no way around vibration. Is like trying to avoid road drag with an automobile just because it has tires. There is no way around, simple. There will always be vibration on a deck.

Your going to secure a weighted battery and escs in an enclosure, by gripping/clamping pressure alone on a skateboard that vibrates on the road...

Glue it all up to the board  then no vibration and also no pressure on the enclosure

I'm liking the enclosure that snaps thru the drop thru holes on the board. Rubber ends and a hard tray in the middle.

The clamps could have rubber grip for dampening. we are not talking space science here. Solutions are not mind blowing. Simple as rubber padding.

It could work, but you would need the flange on the enclosure to lay perfectly over the outside edge and cross sections. You only want to screw through the solid sections.

The problem I see is variance in deck curvature along bottom and sides. Also a mechanism to lock the adjustable side grip tight would only be along the front and rear clasps so in essence the center is no supported in a lengthy enclosure.

Mellow drive already exists as a clean solution. No need to reinvent the wheel.

DIY is about reinventing the wheel mate. Otherwise we just all wait for industrial stuff and observe the world moving around us. The good thing of DIY builds is the freedom to choose parts and not get stuck with something that people have designed but much more.. be flexible. I'm not sure you can fit some 90mm wheels on a Mellow drive and wheels are a big part of the skateboarding/longboarding feeling.

Ok let me rephase. Mellow drive way of securing the enclosure is a tested and proven way... now just to build the enclosure :sweat_smile:

Belt drive version of mellow would be awesome

it is farily robust.

Uses pre-cured fiberglass on top and bottom. Rode one, felt hardly different, only carying around was lighter.

It feels just like a normal skateboard deck. I wouldn't even have known it was hollow. Even drilling it wasn't any different.

I'm using a 2015 Wolf Shark so it may be different from the above designs.

@bigben I'll do more photos this weekend if others are interested. So far i've finalised my set up:

Arcboards enclosure, battery (9s2p), vesc running FOC, remote
TB 6374
TB motor mount and TB rear truck (it fit the motor mount much better than original Calibers)
Caliber II front truck 
16/36 gear ratio
83mm flywheels


Waiting for some proper Abec 11 to come in but this is more or less my final setup.

Sound so like a tidy setup. 
I was interested because I’d seen one for sale and wondered how it looked and rode. 
I’m always interested to see how new builds look!

not a bad build. That arcboards sled is easy to transfer to another deck, too. I put one on a regular trick deck not too long ago.

I have an Arcboard Penny that I am trying to mod. Did you use the Arcboard's battery and VESC to run FOC and the new motor?

Thanks!

Running eboosteds all purpose enclosure.
Board is light (in comparison of course) and doesnt vibrate the bones in your feet so much.
No problem with mounting in the hollow bits at all. 
Only trouble I have had is with that occursed solid state switches....

Sorry, i dont come the forums often. It runs great and is my preferred choice due to lower noise and startup smoothness, esp for single motor drives
