hi guys

how did i end up having dual 6374 motors on one truck? because i used the double kingpin truck from evolve
there are obviously pros and cons for this build
i was afraid that it wouldnt work so i tried searching to see if anyone did this setup, and only saw this other guy did it with a mountain board
but i wanted a bamboo deck for small flexs that are more comfy for ride
as you can see from the photos, my cutting skills aint any good, so it looks like crap so far, might give it some black painting on after
but the cool part is that there are still quite a bit of space in between the two 6374  motors... might try to squeeze in the 107mm wheels since i got plenty of power from dual 6374 motors
since the enertion pulley barring actually pushes the wheels out a bit, i had to cut in a bit of the axle to make it fit the 97mm flywheels using the enertion pulley system
the two motors arent exactly balanced... would this affect the result when riding? should  i go back and grind more to make them more parallel?
now to the cons of the enertion truck, dual kingpin means there are two kingpins resulting an easier turn, and its wide so it kind of have a stabilizing effect, but that second kingpin blocks me from making the motors facing inside it would be stuck in between the two motors, so if anyone want to try this setup, the two huge motors would have to be set in the back outwards
setting up the vesc x and nano remote tmr with help of  Luke through teamviewer (thanks man)
and guys since this is my first build, yes FIRST build, so i would love to get feed backs and suggestions to make it a better board~

my biggest problem right now is using the space cell pro 4 on a bamboo deck, although the flex is the least flex of the bhangra longboard, its still pretty flexy, idk if i would dmg the battery TWT

The material supporting each axel is there for a reason. Typically companies build for tolerance and might slightly overbuild but slightly. To me it looks like you took out quite a bit of material.

You can take off the truck arm and turn it into a normal Kingpin truck if you want to! Personally, I enjoy the double kingpin trucks but if you prefer having only one, its possible and you still have the width you need.

The Evolve double king pin trucks are too carvy, I'm not sure if this is a good idea for 6374 motors, additionally if you've taken such big amount of material, used no proper tools and the think wobbles it makes me feel even more uneasy.

Wider truck will increase the turning radius? And the double kingpin reduce the turning radius because of easy for carving? 

Would this truck easy to get speed wooble? 

U going to use 6374 motor? Because in photo i saw that motor is 6355 from enertion? 

I have same idea with you before you post this out.

Tbh I don't think it will affect that much as evolve axle itself is rather thin even without filing.
Of course it depends on real usage.
Black paint might actually make the system more unstable imo
Btw I guess u r the guy from tw forum? I might just bring up the same question I asked earlier: will the kicktail hit the two motor?  I'm planning on doing something similar so I would like look for some opinion too

Well speed wobble is a delicate subject, since everyone comming from freeriding/downhill will tell you something different than esk8 poeple :). If you were to get speed wobbels it is mayby if even 40% your set up and 60% YOU that is causing it. There was once a very nice write up from a downhill professional wayy back, if you are intrested i could find it for you. Basically on the back go with barrel bushing, excellent stability and in front go with what you like. 
I personally use "venom 81a" on top, they are not high rebound just basic regular formula and on the bottom I use 88a randall stock bushings. My favourite set up for freeriding and esk8. Pretty stable and still easy to turn with. Also the back trucks can be very tight and adjust the front trucks to your liking. Now if you ride and you get speed wobbles try to move your front foot right on top of the trucks and put about 80% of your weight on it. your backfoot should bee on your toes, so you can deliver you weight forward. I you still get speed wobbels go to a local longboard shop, asks If they ride downhill/freeride, If they say yes, ask him to make your wobbels go away. He will quickly loock at your bushings and truck set up and then ask you HOW you ride. An experienced rider won't get speed wobbles with the shittiest set up :slight_smile: . Different trucks, harder set up only prolongs the speed you will get the wobbels. Anyway I rambeld on for to long .

TLDR:

1. Bushings venom 81a" on top /  88a randall stock bushings bottom
2. Trucks, back trucks tight, front truck to your liking
3. >60% of the problem is YOU, position yourself properly 
3.1 Feet = DONT do a 90degre angle ever. Put your feet as straight as possible. (turning takes practise that way since you need to use your weight distribution properly rather than you flexing your feet.
3.2 80% of your weight needs to be on the front foot when you want to go faster.
```

thank for your advice, 
i also notice that skater will lean forward, i had try it, quite effective, board will more stable. 
i not an experience skater, facing the wobble i have to train more on the post on the board.  

and i may try other rate of bushing and tight up abit on the rear truck. 
but for cruising i like loose truck carving on the pathway with low speed. 

any where, i gain something from you~~ thanks.

Wait, what do you mean by "don't do a 90 degree angle"? I have my toes pointing 90 degrees to the direction I am moving, are you saying my feet should be pointing towards the front of the board - like when I'm walking?

@VikasG  well yes. If you just chill and coast on 10-15 mph do what ever you want. Aftert that it is not only a qeustion of how to ride properly but has a lot to do with safety. I am writing a "guide of sorts" atm with video as well. Will try to clear alot of stuff up.

To your qeustion again. The propblem with the foot placement you are having is that your back leg has a work overload. Most of your weight will be on your back foot. SInce it is angeld the way you do it, it is also responsable for turning as well as balance. Would something happen that you would loose controll of your backfoot, even just for a second you loose controle of truning, balance and 80% of your weight. 
Try to picture this:
Your stance is according to the path ahead. (consistent of 5 postitions) So you prepare yourself according to the next few meters ahead properly. So for straight, left turn smooth, left trun hard, right turn smooth right turn hard. So you change your foot placcement, you shift your weight and move your arm and hips accordingly. What this does is allow you to set yourself up in a way that you are best prepared to take the next difficulty but most importantly puts you in the best position to react properly to most things that could happen (a hit, rough pavement, wet spot, car coming, unexpected slide, loss of traction etc.) Meaning its not only the way which allows you to go faster but also a lot safer. I myself had a severe accident and also saw so many happen dutue my hobby/sport. So as we tend to go faster and faster, we really need to educate riders what that brings with them.

My favourite explenation of a pro rider I was fortunate to ride with once:" You cannot change the street before you to your liking, you have to change yourself to adapt to it".

hey guys!
i only tried it indoor to test out if the motors are okay
im a tesseract freestyle boarder who is looking for a way to cruise over 15km with buddies at bike lanes, thats one of my reasons for making this board, i wanna have fun with friends while being able to do some dancing on the board
then again, you would ask, why two 6374 if just to cruise
cuz there are hills around my university, and cuz i weight 105kg, and love to have a drone on my back and so travelling around with camera gears i weight like 110+
and since its my first build, i saw some friends who spent the basics, and wanna upgrade batteries, or motors, and so i decided why not just save up two more months and just get the top notch one lol...
i will be going on a ride this sunday to test out this bad boy
will share the details with u guys about the experience

and the dual kingpin, yeah they are pretty sensitive, so i tightened all four pins
and to balance that, i also got bigger wheels (adds a bit of grip), bigger trucks (more stable), and a really long longboard (extra stable)
but again its all theory right now, we will see how the final experience would be like

Well, bad news
It seems like one of the motors I recieved from enertion has problem...
I never ran motors before so I thought it was normal, until I tried to program them through BLDC...
One motor ran smoothly while the other one seem to stuck on something.... Makes this huge noise, my friend told me this isnt normal...

Ok, I think its the vesc x problem, because I tried cross switching the motors to the other vesc x and turns out the same vesc x output motors have that problem... I tried to make both vesc x same writing, didnt fix it, tried to rewrite to its original setting, still broken motor control....

That's not a problem. 

You need to wire the sensors and set them up with motor detection with the BLDC tool.

All motors have the same problem if you run them sensor less

i don think ernertion motor come with hall sensor. @Eboosted 
@KenTw using without hall sensor. 

There is a weird sound from the problem motor. Did you manage contact Enertion? 
is there any stuck or not smooth while you spinning the motor by hand?

no, they only have the wires with bullet connectors
but im sure they are fine cuz both motors works perfectly fine with the vesc x that i think is working....
i tried motor A with vesc A & B, and so did motor B with vesc A & B
vesc A always worked out fine with the motor, while vesc B's motor, no matter A or B, always have this problem...
that is the reason why i think the problem is the vesc itself, not the motor

could it be possible that one of your belts is slightly tighter on one wheel than the other (more friction)

But if the vesc is able to detect the motor parameters, there should not be a problem.

These are my evolve hangers on sidewinder trucks. 
I'm using 5065 racerstar motors. That's a 6374 motor balanced on top. There should be 5mm or so in between them. The Evolve motor plates would need a little working on too.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/1/3189e95332c755060f41c7289c62779331acaced.JPG" width="375" height="500">

Mate!
I bought two “front trucks”
Not one front and one rear....
The rear truck itself has motor plates
Those are meant to fit the original 5065 motors from evolve!
It is wide enough if the motor plates are set a bit more out, but they are sealed dead, so if you want to fit them on the super wide truck you need to purchase two front trucks, and DIY the motor holders yourself to the size that fits you.
And trust me, there are a HUGE chinch of space for you to work on these trucks, but it does mean that you might need to grind the trucks to your favor. After all, this is DIY, you would need more than just basic assembly.
Hope this helps!

i used the motors from enertion
but i think the ones you have would work even with the extra 10mm on each sides
did u see the original post i had? those were the insanely huge 6374 motors
and then look at the gap in between them.... there is like at least 20mm extra
maybe even 40mm!?
the evolve truck is 330? or 300mm, way longer than then 218mm truck above
but it would need special works on it due to the special shape it has

i am out this weekend, ill take a picture for you for my mounting, but trust me, there is a huge space, it definitely fits dual 6374, and will have a lot of extra space too!

I have a single sk3 6374 setup right now and the motor is just over the middle around half an inch (I hate the imperial system) im using a little extra space bc of the way im mounting the motor pulley rn and Ill change it once i get new motor pulleys, and im using evolve wheel pulleys if that makes a difference
