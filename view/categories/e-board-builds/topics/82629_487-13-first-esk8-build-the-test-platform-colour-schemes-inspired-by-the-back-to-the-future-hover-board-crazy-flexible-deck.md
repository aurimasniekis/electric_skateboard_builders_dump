hello everyone! im brand new to the world of electric skateboards, i come from FPV drone racing/ freestyle and there it a lot of crossover from that hobby to this one electronics wise, so i thought i would have a go at building an electric skateboard. really enjoyed the build and learnt a lot! not quite finished as im still waiting for the belt and small pulley to arrive. 
really pleased with how cheaply i managed to build this setup. was expecting to spent a fair bit more to have a working board. below is what i spent. 

Â£168.22 electronics eg, motor and wiring
Â£138.99 vesc  
Â£25.20 board 
Â£49.99 wheels 
Â£7 + Â£20.90 pulleys 
Â£24.88 tx/rx 
Â£5.95 Grip tape
Â£46 Trucks 

Â£487.13 total 

once i know how far one set of lipos will take me. i plan to make multiple battery cases that i can swap when im out on the board. as the ultimate goal is to eventually build a board for long distance so im going to be using this as like a test platform (hence the name) to get some data and make modifications to, to eventually help me build the long diffidence setup i have been thinking about since i started this project. i like making things when i have some sort of long term goal for the project to push towards. 

here is some photos showing what i have done so far.

glad you like it, know its not to everyone's taste but i build my drones in garish colours too so wanted this reflect that. but so far it seems to be getting a better response than i expected, which is always nice

For that price this will be more than sufficient! Well done bro and awesome colour scheme i like it.
Just a tip, id get to designing a box for a small 10s setup as you'll get sick of 6s very soon ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Absolutely awesome! I love the attention to detail! You almost never see that on someone's first build!  I remember I was wayyy to busy just trying to make it work to ever care what my first build looked like.

update:

i have been ripping around for a week or so. and LOVING IT! noticed the board was very unstable at high speed so added so harder bushes. much much better now. board is doing 18mph with room for more as my VESC settings are very consecutive. it also has absolutely no problem getting up even the steepest hill.   even from a standing start. very happy chap. 
here is some photos of it out in the wild. and my voltages after returning from a 10 mile trip! i still had battery left! couldn't believe it!
im currently running a 16 48 tooth setup i have an 18 tooth front pulley i could try. who knows how fast it could go then :) 
also just drilled the deck and countersunk stainless bolts into it so secure the enclosures now that its basically finished. also added neoprene around the top edges of the enclosures to replace the Velcro i was using to make them vertically 100% waterproof. 

next job, build a better remote control with some telemetry
