I am mounting dual FOCBOX on the tail of my MTB inside of a case. I have searched the build threads but haven't seen anything I like. From what I have read the FOCBOX is right at 2.5" wide and just over 1" Tall. I plan to mount a vent opening int he lid of the box in case I need airflow for cooling. This will be an on-road build so complete watertight is not an issue.

This one seems price effective and plenty of room.

I want to do the same on my trampa board but mount them to the tail on the outside and just use the segmented battery enclosure the whitepony built with it to use the whole thing just for batteries. All I have found is a mount not an enclosure which would be awesome if someone had a waterproof enclosure for dual focbox setup
