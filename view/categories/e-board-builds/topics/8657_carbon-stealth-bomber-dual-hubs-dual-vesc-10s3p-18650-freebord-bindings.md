Based after @whitepony's gorgeous Carbon Jet Spud, I decided to build my own. For those looking for more, much more beautiful photos, check out his build. (linked below)
 
So, I'm gonna skip past most of the routing I did, since @whitepony did it better, mine ended up with a bunch of bumps and imperfections in it. (It was very ugly) 

I basically just routed a slot in the bottom of the board.

Skipping straight to the vacuum bagging, this is my first attempt. I laid down the bottom layer of vacuum bag material, then the board, then unidirectional CF, then two sheets of 2x2 CF twill, then peel ply, then breather material. I was too anxious and didn't have connectors for the hoses, so I just inserted them from the side and used gum tape to seal them in. Then, seal everything up and VACUUM!

This is as far as it has gotten so far, the vacuum is still working.

Nice! I hope to have mine going soon as well, what hubs are you using with the freeboard bindings?? Can hubs take the beating??

I'll be using both Hummie and Jacob hubs, I'll use whichever is best. Hummie will be here first, Jacob will be here in a month or two (or more)

Really I don't have any experience with hubs so if they can't take it I'll move to belt driven.

oh, nice!! :grinning:

is the breather soaked so much that it became transparent? my breather/soaker material is very thick, more like felt! 

looking forward to the results, vacuum bagging is a lot like xmas as a kid - waiting 24hours and then finally the big moment with unwrapping :smile:

I actually used a different kind of breather material, it's actually a kind of mesh . I didn't use soaker, we'll see how it turns out.

Ok... So I got a little anxious and ripped it open early. It looks pretty decent.

The bumps in the enclosure were expected because of the poor routing job, but since they will be on the inside, I can live with it.

Also interesting how the matte carbon side is the side everyone sees, I guess one side of the CF fabric is matte black and the other glossy (?)
Someone with more experience may be able to confirm. May also have to do just with the peel ply.

Ok, quick update. Enertion pulley is HTD5, I do not have a corresponding HTD5 Belt or pulley for my motor. Ordered. Now it's time to wait. Tomorrow I will start work on the enclosure hopefully. Need to go to the store and buy foam or wood or something-- recommendations welcome.
Also going to be routing the motor wires LHB style most likely, but we'll see. It's a lot of effort to set up the X-Carve for LHB routing. Kinda seems easier to just leave it in the open... Ugh I'm tired. It's 12:35 here and about time for me to go to bed. Will continue in the morning.

the carbon texture roadside seems to stem from your breather material (photo resolution isnt very good, hard to say). Im using a thin bleeder film with a tiny hole pattern directly on the last layer of carbon (like a small 1mm hole every 2cm), which gives the surface a nice flat look. 
ontop of that film I got the breather & soaker material - the pressure evacuates excess resin through the tiny holes of the thin bleeder film and it is then caught by the thick soaking film to leave me with minimum amount of resin in the carbon layer (thats the point of bleeder & soaker).

next time you really should be more patient with the routing, it looks like you worked with a chainsaw :laughing:

do the router "guidance" trick with straight pieces of wood or metal, that you clamp to your board. one of the enclosure sides is not parallel to the boards edge - these are things that can easily be avoided with careful measuring, drawing and a router guidance:

http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/spud_freeboard_4.jpg

another thing: when you evacuate, make sure that there are no creases or folds on any layer that touches the carbon, because it will ALWAYS show and is hard to "repair" properly. that top vacuum foil/bag layer with the large fold along the whole length of the board couldve been easily straightened out before curing!

anyway, I love that youre doing this, doing the full thing with routing, carbon, motor wires requires a lot of work and patience (if you feel like you rush something, step back, take a deep breath and TAKE YOUR TIME!). Im very impressed by what you are achieving at your age. :grinning: :thumbsup:

p.s.: I would mount the pulley otherway round - the closer the belt runs to the motor, the lesser the stress on the motor bearings. also reduces lateral force on the motor mount!

Haha, thanks! And yeah, the routing was a mess...


Definitely should have spent a little bit more time with it, but I decided that I could live with it as long as it was hidden by the enclosure, and luckily the crease in the bag didn't result in any marks on the deck but I see what you are saying. I already tried flipping the pulley around, doesn't fit. Set screw holes don't make contact with the shaft. That being said the motor mount setup isn't complete in this photo (not even using the pulley or belt pictured) I just put the pulley in the photo to get an idea of what it will look like, but this pulley isn't even HTD. I moreover, I wanted to mount the motor mount and test fit the motor.

Ok next up. The enclosure (more resin infusion @whitepony)

This time, I took more time to try to get rid of as many wrinkles in the bag and everything.
For the enclosure mold I just used two pieces of wood stacked, then covered them in stretch wrap. I also covered the board. I didn't know if that would be enough so I sprayed mold release on them both (I have no idea if this will help or even harm the board, but I figured I'd rather try then ruin the deck.

Pictures!!

ONWARDS! Demolding time. I had much difficulty getting out the wooden block, but I ripped it all open, and this is what it looks like:

Ugh, I do not like these holes in the corners. Very annoying. Anyone have any suggestions on how to patch them?

Furthermore, somehow the resin got through the stretch wrap covering I had. Also very annoying. Messed up the bottom of the deck. I sanded it ALOT, but it kinda blended the carbon fiber look together. ARGH. Well, I'll just have to live with it.

Tell me if anyone has ideas on how to patch the holes in the side.

You can fill those holes by giving the whole thing a couple coats of epoxy. Check my build. I did it just to make it shiny, but it did a great job at hiding a lot of imperfections.

Air bubbles are unavoidable when adding additional coats of epoxy. You can get rid of them by color sanding it, and then adding a layer of clear coat if you want to make it to look professional.

Ok. No progress today. I streaked myself on the asphalt today. Temporarily unable to move well. Gonna play it easy for now. Updates to come when I decide what power supply I am going to buy. Probably the 10S 5Ah E-bike one from Supower. May need a different connector, though. I like theirs, but at the same time, it's too big for my taste.

awh, been there recently, crash at 40kph because of a large patch of suprise gravel :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

its a good first try but you should be more patient and take a step back more often. the mounting holes look very random right now and you switched the carbon diagonal texture pattern board->enclosure which makes the enclosure much more obvious & visible.

for rounded edges, there are router bits! check this out to learn something about your router: http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/tools/reviews/g1135/10-router-bits-every-diyer-should-own/

Updates! So I went ahead and epoxied the deck. I also epoxied the enclosure. Then I epoxied it again, and again. I also have gone ahead and spray painted the deck orange. I had a couple issues with streaks in the epoxy on the enclosure. Didn't have the issue on the deck interestingly.

if you route deeper you will want more reinforcement. It's a very stiff board in general, so with it, the board doesn't feel very different.

The weight of the CF isn't really a factor, just the price (and thickness?).

Progress! Ok, so I got to work on the battery, and it looks really good! It's a 10S3P battery, with a BMS. It's an 18650 pack which I spot welded together. Feel free to ask any questions, I soldered the BMS wires to the pack and it looks like it's fairly good.

UGH FML.
The enclosure is a little small, probably off by about 1-2cm. I can make it work, MAYBE, if not, may have to go a single motor 6355 motor. The thing which is causing me issues is the wiring, takes up too much space... Not to mention I need to fit a BMS in the battery still, and it hasn't been heatshrunk.

Bummer! It looks so close :frowning:

What did you use to spot weld your pack? Off the shelf or DIY spot welder?

Off the shelf s#!tty spot welder. Like $110 on Ebay - just the black one.

:::UPDATES:::
So ALOT has happened since the last update, most importantly, the battery... so I had a minor issue

**See:** 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/liion-cells-reading-0-6v/9609

TL;DR - I thought I had a battery issue but it turned out to be the multimeter, charged the pack, then BMS of the pack wasn't letting the pack properly discharge, but I've fixed it and now it works. Still waiting on supower BMS -- 1 month later. :cry:

In other news, the VESC seems to be working a lot better now that I have (mostly - 80%) charged the pack, getting a lot more speed and throttle, so that's good.

I still need to find a spot where to mount the charge port and the LCD, as well as the on/off switch, but so far, so good! I have done a couple tests and it does seem to work pretty well!! I'm super excited and will post more soon. Videos to come!

That's all for now folks. Will update when LCD, and ports have been mounted.

Aside from stability what else can you do with the free board mounts ? Does it make jumping curbs easier ? Board looks great.

You'd be surprised how helpful bindings can be. Up until now, I have used full bindings on my other board, but I wanted to try the freebord ones. They're not only useful for carving and stability (which is very useful and has saved my ass a few times.) They are a lot of fun! I use them on my old board for jumping (either for fun or over potholes) and it's just crazy fun! It came out looking really good I agree, super happy with it!

Sweet.  I've been lusting those bindings for some time.  I might just pick up pair.  Thanks.
