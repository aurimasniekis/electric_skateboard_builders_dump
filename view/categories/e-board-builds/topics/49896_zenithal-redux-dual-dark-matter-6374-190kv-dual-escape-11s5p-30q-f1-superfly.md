No idea, haven't weighed it yet, feels hefty, though it could just be that I'm not used to 55 cells, the whole thing feels very solid, not a single rattle
The enclosure is 8lbs, motors 4lbs, wheels 4lbs, don't know deck, trucks
The deck is likely the lightest part...lol

@Sender neutral take longer to cure. But anyway acetyl shouldnt degrade the glass of the enclosure or PVC on batteries.  Just leave the enclosure open to air for a few days before bolting it to the board so that all of the silicone can cure and the gasses don't rest on things like the terminals/focboxes etc...

Yeah it's great, a bit bouncy, holds like cement. 
My trick for removing something siliconed in, is fishing line, get it underneath whatever is siliconed and with a sawing motion drag it across and underneath the siliconed object, out in seconds, 0 damage

Do you like the grip tape? I have 3 sheets of the same stuff in honeycomb, but Im not too psyched on it, especially since they are in those small squares so you have to waste a bit and still not get a ton of coverage for it to.... "mesh" right with the other sheets... don't know if I worded that correctly.

Yeah I like it, very grippy, I got the 40ish inch long sheets so meshing wasnt an issue. It solves a number of concerns for me, I wanted to see as much carbon as possible and still have good grip, and hide the inserts üòâ
Wait what inserts.....ü§´

I know you have your adjustable charger. But this might be aight for a secondary (at work) charger. Hard to find 11s bricks... well hard for me at least. But this thing might be a bit too hot at 6a.

Getting some protective gear for the summer and the fact that I'm getting too comfortable doing 30-40 and tend to go over 40mph when possible. My protection till now has been pretty bare minimum, tsg pass,gloves, and just layers torso and legs. Ok for the winter but definitely not spring/summer.  

So here's what I got so far, will be getting several colors/style of these jeans
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QGU93F6/
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XBPSWGT/
The pads are pretty quick to insert and remove so you can wear the jeans all day and just add pads when riding, also it still has the Kevlar lining around the knees and ass/hip without the pads
Jeans with knee/shin and hip padding installed
