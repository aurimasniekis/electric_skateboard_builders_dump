First, I'll get straight to the point. I want an electric longboard that can go **20mph top speed** (can be less) but what I'm really focus on is the range. I want the **range to be as long as possible so 20-30 miles.**
I'm myself is a little guy, 5'7 and 120 lbs. The reason I'm doing this because I'm an electrical engineer and I want to really learn hands on the skills that I need for my major and career. This is my first major and expensive project. 

I've been doing a lot of reading and watching YouTube videos for the last two weeks and made up a list of materials that I need. **I REALLY APPRECIATE IT IF YOU GUYS CAN GUIDE ME AND HELP ME LOWER THE COST.** 

Deck

Wheels

Screws

Now, the drivetrain...

Motor mount

Motor
Originally I want to buy it off Maytech but the guy convince me to buy it at DIY.

The Maytech one that I originally wanted to buy because it has the highest power to weight ratio I believe.

36T ABEC Pulley Combo Kit - 16T Motor pulley and **I don't know how long should the belt be.**

Now the expensive part...

VESC with male to male connector since the guy works there told me to get it.

Battery

I'll probably get two for the range that I want.

Remote control with the receiver

I think I got everything down. Again I REALLY REALLY appreciate it if you can point me to better options. Goal is somewhere from 15-20 mph with LONG range. Thank you for reading!

So with all those components, you're looking at a top speed of around 18 mph. That's mostly because your battery is only 6s. Buying a pre-maid 6s battery is going to add a lot of cost to the build, especially because you'll only get about 14 miles range out of that battery. 

You said you're an electrical engineer, why not build a battery? It will give you a lot hands on experience and let you really understand the process better. You can get lipos or li-on batteries and a bms for less than the price of that battery, and build the battery as big as you want to get the speed and range that you want.

Also, you mentioned not knowing what size belt to get? go with the 265mm, it's pretty standard and should fit the gearing you have well.

Pulley from @Titoxd10001 and motor mount from @Shogu12 will save some money and defenly try to build your own battery.

For 6S, we recommend 260KV and/or you can increase your pulley size if you want higher top speed and use our 6355 190KV.

6S with 260KV is about 22-24mph or 6S using 190KV and 18T/36T. But I'd only use 190KV if you plan on upgrading to 10S/12S in the future.

if you want long range then you want to get as big a battery as you can afford. the more Wh's the better the range.
and personally if you are only going to go 6S I dont see a reason to get VESC, you can get by with an ESC half the price.

Better by remote from ali to save A couple bucks, and as already mentioned buy the kit here ont the forum and mount from @Shogu12

I heard of other people buying samsung batteries and connect them in series. Do you recommend this method? and Do you know any tutorials on how to create an 10s or 12s.

I think I'm planning to make 10s or 12s by myself like pennyboard suggest. But at the moment I need to do more research. I appreciate your insight.

18650 Samsum batteries get expensive, but will last longer. There is a thread about it here https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/battery-knowledge-base-wip-rough-draft/21915/59

## \#10 Posted by: gee Posted at: 2017-06-01T21:08:26.384Z Reads: 53

```
So I have this question. Does 10s or 12s means fast and more range? And let's say a board is capable of hitting 30 mph but I only cruise about 18 mph then would it mean that I can extend the range?

```
Short answer - yes
a longer answer involves looking at gear ratio's, torque and ride style. The fact of the matter is, you will not ride a  10S the same way you ride a 12S

```
When you say riding style with 10s is different than 12s, what do you mean? The obvious reason I could think of is the speed, 10s would have less speed and range and 12s would be greater speed and range. I have come across and couple of speed calculator but none of those can calculate the range. And the Center distance is still kind of blurry to me.

Well if you do a 10S you will have a different Gear ratio than a 12S most likely. This will mean more torque. So you'll probably ride the 12S harder than the 10S
