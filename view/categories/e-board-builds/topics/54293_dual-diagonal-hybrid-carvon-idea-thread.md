I recently built a dual diagonal and I love riding it. It's got me thinking now that I would like to swap the front belt drive motor for a single carvon v2. I guess i need to figure out how to get as closely as possible speed/power rating? Has anyone tried this with a hub/direct drive? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Oh yeah the current specs are 
10s3p space cell 3
Dual diagonal 140kv racerstar style motors
Dual vescs (old ones idk which?)
97mm clones
15:36 gearing I'm almost positive.
```
