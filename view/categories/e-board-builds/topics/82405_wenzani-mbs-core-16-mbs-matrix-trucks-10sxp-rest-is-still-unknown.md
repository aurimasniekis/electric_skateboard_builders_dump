Okay, I bought an MBS Core mountain board many years ago. Now I want to convert it to an electric sidewalk surfboard to commute to work (13km one way). Though I live in the city, it‚Äôs still Africa and the road is not smooth, has no shoulder and there is not much sidewalk either, almost off road.
The wheels are the 5-star nylons from MBS and not running true, rest is stiil in good condition. I would like to get the MBS Rockstars Pro they seem quite afordable and there is no way I would be able to machine something similar locally. I have a few ideas where to start but is a complete rookie with what to choose. Helical drive train seems cool but is complicated and more expensive than a belt drive system, chain seems fine as well. For the motor, batteries and controller I have no idea. Would need advice, please.

MBS Rockstars Pro
[/quote]

Don‚Äôt get them. They have big quality issues with this hubs. Some people here couldn‚Äôt even fit the bearings inside.

If you decide to go with belt or chain drive you can have a look in @idea thread, he sell some nice motor mounts for mbs trucks.

Belts are a pain with electric mountain boards as, depending on your use, they can easily snap on you...no one wants to walk with a heavy board back home. Chain is a lot more durable and the only long-term maintenance would be replacing the sprockets after they were down but a bit of chain lubrication will prevent this from happening for a quite some time. Disadvantage of chain is it is a lot louder than belt systems which is sometimes a problem for some people.

Geared systems are the future but you're right in thinking there expensive but remember there's still gonna be high costs sourcing reliable and durable motor mounts so maybe keep an eye out in the forum as i know some vendors are working away at their own versions of geared-drives so the price should in theory go down

Much more expensive but look to be a nice wheel, the mbs 5star make sense to build within a tight budget, order you tires and tubes at the same time.

You will have to decide on which way to go after that - gear drives or belt pulleys.

Gear drives are expensive typically and most only mate to one particular bolt pattern, Trampa Superstar being the predominant pattern, so bear that on mind if you pick up mbs wheels.

@moon is going to make a 4.4 drive which should support mbs wheels

See here
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/modular-all-terrain-gear-drive-lacroix-surfrodz-trampa-mbs-and-surfrodz/82165?u=banjaxxed

If you can eat the cost $635 delivered and it's very reasonable for a complete drive train, then you could skip buying the wheel and get on this group buy

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-avio-at-gear-drive-kit-pre-orders-now-available/77886?u=banjaxxed

This direction could be best if you are in a city as the build would be lighter than a ful on 8" build yet still be able to deal with rough surfaces, probably no safaris

Wow the AVIO system looks beautiful. Unfortunately I am on a very tight budget and will mostly source parts locally. Regarding this Avio system, is there a reason why they didn't choose helical gears? Is there actually a preference for helical gears above spur in sk8-board application or is the noise of spur gears not really bothering?

I already have complete 8" (obviously pneumatic) wheels I only need hubs (maybe I'll need a spare wheel for on my way to work... hehehe) that are a bit stronger and not wobbly. The heat of a brake disc is the other reason why Nylon hubs will not last. But that is if brake discs will be used - it seems the motor is used to brake and the re-charge the battery a little bit? Is that true? Does it brake hard enough?

Sounds good, yeah they would work good.

In fairness you could still use the Haggy wheels by themselves, the price is very good to include quality tires/tubes.

Then print your pulleys, buy your belts, motors, motor pulleys(should be metal). You'll have to find a motor mount compatible with your trucks or make them.

Are you keeping the trucks you have? what are they?

Hmmm... that‚Äôs true the helical is quite more expensive. Looking at the complete drivetrain; it needs to be closed and sealed tightly to keep grime out and the lubricant in. That makes it more expensive... and an optimal drivetrain.

If you are going to run pulleys with belts then your options for motor mounts are from vendors on here
@Idea
@okp 
@marcmt88  
@Nowind
@Rithblu 
etc 

Those are MBS Matrix I trucks afaik.
You should be able to find a wheel pulley that is compatible on thingiverse i.e.
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3387057

Check first to make sure it is compatible with the wheel hole spacing before printing. Don't try to use PLA, use Nylon, PETG or similar tough filament, better still buy a pair that are made from POM.

Alternatively you can chain drive them.

But given this is to be done on super-tight budget, check here
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/15-20-boardnamics-caliber-motor-mounts/73643/253?u=banjaxxed

Also check here and search in general, good luck

Dude! So many thanks for you input! 

What I'm planning to do is design and build the motor mounts... sitting on the southern part of the world (with weak currency and idiotic import duties) does not help if I'm going to import parts on an extremely tight budget. I have decided on a belt drive option. 

Thus for a start and to save some time I would need some CAD (or drawing) of the MBS Rockstar hubs (I saw a drawing somewhere) or at least the side with hub's PCD and a drawing of the mounting section on the trucks. I can measure the current hubs but I don't trust the wobbliness.

You welcome, more esk8 for Africa & no problem bruü§ò

You can get the hole pattern for the mounts by taking them from a design on thingiverse, grabcad.com is another good resource. Just compare with what your calipers tell you with the wheels 

In fact you may be able to find a mount already designed for those trucks, just need to search on them ‚Äòmbs mount‚Äô or ‚Äòmbs pulley‚Äô & of course ‚Äòmbs wheel‚Äô

Are you hand cutting or milling them?

Looking forward to a truely Zef build yeh!

Okay, after some... relatively more than just some reading and a bit of doodling I got to a point where I have parameters. I'm designing for range not speed.
![IMG_9774|375x500](upload://siKukzPa8bNWZEuhGcTlHgKd5eB.jpeg) 
Batteries: will be LiPo 10s(depending on cash)p. 
Motor: 225KV (will see what I can find but this is based on the theories of Vedder who wrote and did some awesome stuff on this forum)
Motor Mount: Got some CAD and drawings of the MBS trucks and Rockstar hubs still busy with designing but this is least of the problems.
Drive Train: Now this is where it gets interesting... I have chosen a belt drive system. I initially desired and designed for a maximum speed of 45km/h, which requires a gear ratio of 1:7.2. but with a 5m or 3m belt the slave wheel will be too big, resulting in poor ground clearance or to be totally unpractical. The hub of the Rockstars has an outside diameter of 105mm I do not want to exceed this by more than 10mm on the radius. So gear ratio is now 6.5 with GT3 belt, thus pulleys 20T:130T. Also Dont want to go smaller on the drive pulley to extend belt life, max speed is now around 50km/h.

Tomorrow I'll see what type of belt I can source in South Africa as so far I cannot find a GT belt but have sort off found a local supplier who can supply me with a HTD 3M belt which looks okay. Would have liked to use a 5M belt the pulleys seem to be too big for the board or I'll have to change the gear ratio.

What do you guys think? Does this make sense other ideas maybe?

Ok... after some more reading and pondering. My max speed is too high thus I figured the other solution is reducing the KV value of the motor. There is no use in sourcing a motor for an application that will never run at its optimum thus I got these 2 motor options **Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6364-213KV** and **Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6364-190KV** the one gives 51km/h and the other 45km/h (that is all theoretical now). I chose the drive train ratio to be 1:6. I want as much torque possible and not exceed the wheel hub diameter too far, with 19T:114T the PCD of the drive pulley is only 2mm higher than the wheel hub, I can live with that. A gear ratio of 1:6.5 is nice but the drive pulley becomes too big. Hopefulley tomorrow I'll be able to chat with a local belt supplier and maybe generate some CAD renders of the motor mount.

Hi Andy,
I guess I can go lower in KV. Though there are lots of information on ideal motor RPM and most "literature" I read so far points out that the efficiency is best at around 8000 RPM. If I go lower in KV keeping 50km/h as max speed the drive train ratio will be 4.3.... I feel that is a bit low and it will compromise torque...? Correct?
```

Honestly I never went so deep to look into the optimal rpm with a specific kV.
I would say my favorite sweet spot is 170kV
With a 15/72 gearing you would be around 48km/h with 8‚Äú or better to say 180mm wheels.
That gives you still a ok clearance and very good torque.
But your average loaded rpm is just at 6700.

If you want to go the high kV, high gearing way, than there is probably no way around a gear drive.
Like this from @Nowind with 1:6.25 gearing ratio

I would measured my wheel diameter and my 8‚Äú wheels not 200mm, more like 180, so top speed will be less for sure.

Why you want to go so high teeth with the motor pulley?

20T is what the belt manufacturer sugests for better belt life. That was actually part of my belt question... is the higher T-number on the motor gear really making a difference say if one would use 17T?

For htd5m most people on mtb use 14-16th max.
people use up to 18-20 th on street boards for the motor pulley.
Sure the more teeth have contact the better is the transmission, but for this you could also use idler which will guide your belt between both pulleys a bit down and with it more teeth have contact and you can run the belts more lose too.
So less stress on them.

I never used but just bought some 20mm belts not long ago too.
I would say it‚Äôs the same here, the wider the belt the more surface is involved and the better the power transfer. If you can, sure go with wider belts. I wanted to use even 25mm belts but couldn‚Äôt find a motor pulley which would fit without that I need to rework it.

Sorry, hope this will be the last one... still a few missing. If there is any other dimensions you think I missed please add them. Oh, yes... **what is the width of an assembled hub**?

Nice Mat !
Total hub W = 38mm
A = +88mm (88.2 /88.25 /88.3...)
B = 93mm
C = 4mm
D = 4mm (4.2/4.3mm)
;) thanks for sharing back !

Thanks. 
Ok, I'll load this up to Thingiverse or some site. Are the hubs bolt together with M4 or M5?

Busy designing my own wheel, sofar it seems I‚Äôll be able to manufacture a wheel for $16 USD. Pitty bearings are so expensive.
It is basicaly two discs AISI 304, 2mm with lasercut 3mm aluminum ‚Äúarms‚Äù forming the cylinder of the hub.

I read here on the forum that some say chain drive has better ground clearance.... But according to a roller chain sprocket‚Äôs geometery it‚Äôs actually worse than ‚Äòn belt drive system for a constand gearing ratio.
Say for instance I want a 1:5 drivetrain ratio with an M5 pully system one can easily achieve it with a quite standard and common 66:13T selection. But with a roller chain sprocket the smallest motor sprocket on a 05B chain and bore √ò10 is 9T (one gets smaller but bore becomes a problem and 04B chain seems to ne weak). Now to have a ratio of 1:5 the driven sprocket needs to be 45T this sprocket has a OD of 118mm compared to the pully‚Äôs √ò105mm. That is 7mm less ground clearance for the roller chain drive system... Wanted to use chain for its advantages with robustness, but it seems to be more impractical.

#Dimension HTD Pulley

I struggled so hard to find relatively proper documentaion regarding HTD pulley dimensions, all other information was only related to the belts itself and one needed to derive or guess dimensions. Here is an image link below.

Thanks. I like your values it seems more sensible than using belt dimensions. Do you cut your own pulleys?

Not really. Wouldn‚Äôt know how to fix the cut ends together.
If you need a belt length calculator, you can use this. Works well as min for the most common teeth counts.

Waiting for wheel assembly from suppliers... had loads of busy or public holidays in the last few weeks. In the mean time I designed a Scotts damper base plate mounting.

Lightly assembled the prototype hub and base plate. Will weld it probably next week, as parts fit quite sweet. Need to reduce the hub diameter to 91.5mm as it is a bitch assembling it.

![image|666x500](upload://wd862CABjshD9BoUwh4yhgJ5pmM.jpeg) I‚Äôm really impressed with how this wheel came out. The diameter of the bearing holes were specked at √ò28.05mm to have a proper bearing fit. It worked beautifully, a nice snug fit. The rim run true as gyro.

I forgot about the sprockets inside SolidWorks‚Äô toolbox... ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è So I used that and adjusted the tooth profile a bit too mesh better and have less chain slap (sprocket against the rollers during meshing), thus less noise. The drive sprocket is locally available of the shelf for something like 3USD and it could be quench hardened. It will be ISO 05B, 9T and the slave sprocket will be 42T, this one will be lasercut. Would have liked to have a better or larger reduction ratio but with the chain systems it is not possible unless one sacrifices ground clearance.

Think I‚Äôll turn the Scotts damper arround... the front looks like some kind of robot face. Hahahaha!

Really cool design work fella, love the Scotts, I have one from my trackday days sonewhere.

Was it easy to design & produce the mounting hardware for it

I‚Äôm thinking on the lightest settings on a Trampa truck just running springs. Does not seem to be yet a consensus over which end to place it on (as yet)

I had a massive speedwobble that ended up peeling off the end of one of my shoulder tendons last summer so maybe the rear could be the right end

Oh-shit! Sorry dude, that must have hurt! :O. I'm so busy at work and cannot get time to work on the project - I still need to weld the parts together, it's so frustrating!!!. The parts, all laser cut, seems to assemble very well and I do not foresee any issues on its functioning. What parts of the Scotts do you have or what do you need? I might be able to design something for you as I have all the dimensions of the Scotts and the necessary parts.

Thanks, that is a cool offer I have exactly the same one as yours with the mounting for an Aprilia RSVR.

The accident? It was pretty painful riding home afterwards for sure but the doc gave me some nice things to help sleep for a couple of days!

This year I don't plan on going that fast again (almost 60kph). Wobbles are not a problem when **not** nailing it i.e. keep below 50kph and all is good, for now that will be my way of dealing with it & hey  enjoy the ride & suck in the feels & scenery

Also you have enough on your plate with this build as well, the frustration is real! good luck

I'll maybe PM you down the road sometime, you could be the stabiliser parts producer! All the major truck shapes are on grabcad, let's talk when you are done with this one

Cheers
