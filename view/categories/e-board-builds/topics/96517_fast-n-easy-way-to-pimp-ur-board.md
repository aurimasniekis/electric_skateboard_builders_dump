As I said ugly. I only used things I had laying around like 1 yrs old spray cans and only 60 grid sand papper.  The texture is really nice but I think it's gonna be really dirty really quick. Placed a order for a new bigger enclosure to fitt my stuff properly.

I thinks it's better every way. I will fix shorter bolts and skip Phillips heads theyyy suuuuck.![IMG_20190613_121952|690x325](upload://nV52Wt15sHcaEdSubVBEpvmb33S.jpeg)

New enclosure and new grip to go.
