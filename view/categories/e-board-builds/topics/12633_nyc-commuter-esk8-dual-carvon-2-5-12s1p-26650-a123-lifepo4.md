First of all I owe this build to @cmatson and his Pocket Rocket build ([http://tinyurl.com/gorzymf](http://tinyurl.com/gorzymf)) and @RunPlayBack and his Jet Tomahawk Dual Carvon Build ([http://tinyurl.com/jzpbhv2](http://tinyurl.com/jzpbhv2))
Without their documentation I would have never attempted my this.

The goal was to create a stealthy small esk8 to take around my hood for errands and whatnot. Dependable hardware was a must. 

**Motors**

I used Paracord to sleeve the motor wires.
Since I weigh 185-195 depending on the week. @LEVer suggested I go with his dual hub. I actually purchased the v2.0 hubs first but I replaced them as soon as he announced the v2.5 with a lower kv for better acceleration. After a couple days with the dual hubs I think I could have gone with the single hub motors. These things are fast! I always ease up on the throttle and I don’t think I’ve come close to their full potential. I’m being very careful because of everyone horror stories posted here.

**Battery**

After seeing @RunPlayBack ’s A2ESK8 Old School Mini Cruiser
[http://tinyurl.com/jhhp2oj](http://tinyurl.com/jhhp2oj) and reading about the benefits of using a compact 12s1p LiFePO4 systemI decided to go with the same battery. At the time, the only place I knew to get one prebuilt was to get one through  Unfortunately, it was not yet ready to ship. I was warned it would take a few weeks to ship. Turns out it took  3 Months and 8 Days! It was so hard to see  my deck all setup without a battery all summer. I think they have it all worked out now but if you order one you should definitely check when they can ship it out before. I have yet to see how much range I get out of it. But I road it for a few miles and I didn’t feel any loss of power the whole time.

**Enclosure**

I went with Psycotiller. He made me a perfect enclosure for this build. (1.5in x 6.25in x 15.25in) with a .5” flange. This was perfect for my build. I think I may go back and have him remake it and just add a little more thickness. Things are definitely packed inside, I forgot to account for the concave of the board. Im afraid its adding some stress to the battery and vescs.

**Speed Controller**

Ollie Vescs 4.12. Firmware 2.18 Now I have to admit. I was too excited and just plugged in @RunPlayBack ’s vesc settings from [http://tinyurl.com/zcddhe4](http://tinyurl.com/zcddhe4) and it just worked. I will go back and fine-tune it soon. Im not using the can bus connector. More on that later. 

**Remote**

I have a nano, 2.4Ghz mini remote - Trigger Style, and a GT2B remote. I haven’t even tried the nano or mini remotes yet because of all the complaints here. I got the GT2B last and modded it. It was super easy and I haven’t had a problem with it yet. As for the receiver I used a y spitter (with the red wire cut on one end) to connect the receiver to the two vescs. @LEVer said this was better.

(please tell me if Im doing this wrong for a 12s1p battery)

Very tidy mate! Love the idea of using paracord outer for the motor wires, such a smart look and opens up so many aesthetic possibilities

@treenutter I used runplaybacks settings. It's totally controllable and feels great. I'm more worried about other issues like stuck throttle and unexpected braking.

@RunPlayBack Thanks! Yeah that would have been rad to meet you and get your feedback on my build. Next time hit me up!

Also 1 quick question. 
I used your settings from your dual carvon build running on 10s and my build is running 12s1p LiFePO4. 
Do I need to change my Bat Max: from 15.00 A to 20.00 A?
