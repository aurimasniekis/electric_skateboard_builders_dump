Hi Boarders,
                    Recently I was caught at school (I'm a high school physics teacher) contemplating building an electric longboard for a dancing commuter to work by the students.  Anyway it snowballed into a full on approved activity with a few other staff members wanting to build board as well. (this year we will run sessions on building a board, next year we may allow students to build, we need to work out any kinks). I have a plan and would love to get some feedback. Here is the plan

Purpose - Like to dance my way to work, but also need speed as I'm always running late. Will be using the build in High school physics (age 16-18 ) to introduce basic electric circuits, battery technologies, power calculations and motor winding.

* Board: Loaded Tarab (yes I know it is flexy but will engineer a solution) - its a sexy dancer

* Motors\truck - Possibly Hummies new Dual hub beasts (I've PM'd him about it)

* ESC - Dual VESC

* Battery - will recycle some 18650's with the class for fun - will probably end up replacing them with Sammy 30Q's at 10S4P maybe 10s3P

* BMS - Maybe one of those Bestech ones but I'm a model airplane flyer so I have a good high current balance charger that will do the job without BMS (Would like some running cell monitoring though)

There are a few challenges, I have looked a stiff boards but like the flexy ride and was thinking of putting batter packs near each truck, there is also a good mountain board solution on the forum I have seen to deal with board flex as well - some things to ponder over.

Anyway anyone with suggestions or comments on the gear above I'd love to hear them. I'll post more info as the project takes shape and then will document with photos.  I'll also be happy to post power point slides on any theory that I create if anyone is interested.

Thanks

Adam

Samsung 30Q's? :joy: 
Esk8's are not joke, I would be really careful presenting it in class. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: 
Good luck though :kissing_heart:

No charger will balance your battery pack unless you have some kind of independent individual pack charging capability,

def. go with Focbox or any HW6 Vesc (V6 or Escape/Bbox). 

Separated enclosures (boosted like) from @eboosted should work, but maybe you’ll need some risers on the tarab. 
Lastly I would pick the stiffer tarab, too soft is not stable at higher speeds.

Use a BMS, you won't be sorry.  Taking your skateboard apart to charge it is far, far less than ideal

Thanks Bevliacqua, I was thinking Flex 1 as with the weight of rider and batteries would be using 85+kg. Less flex would help on battery placement too.

If I ever did use a hobby charger I'd make proper ports with balance wires and such to charge externally. But generally I'd agree the BMS is simpler. Mostly because its less. Wires to plug in, not so much taking the board apart.

BMS + charger, plug in wait for magical green light

Hobby charger, plug in main lead, plug in balance, push buttons, hold buttons, hope you selected the right thing every time.

The general idea is that, if you don't know what cells to use for an electric skateboard, use Samsung 30Q from ru.nkon.nl

Even if you do research the specific cells for your particular purpose, it's an 80% chance the 30Q will the ones you will need anyway, possibly Samsung 35E or Panasonic PF or a few others but those two in particular are only good for super-long-range builds.

Using a hobby charger all but guarantees you won't be able to make it waterproof.

Hey Deckoz,
                     I have a multichem balancing battery charger just need to check if it can handle 10 to 12 cells.
Thanks

P.S I have some home brew kick ass speakers (still waiting for final embellishments) as well.

Thanks b264,
                     I have done a bit of research and came to the same conclusion on the 30q's as well.  Also here in OZ http://ru.nkon.nl/ from Europe still seems the cheapest place to buy cells.

Yes ZackoryCramer I agree,
I have done some preliminary assessment and decided that students will only help build the board in the first run of the program, not  build there own. As a former electronics eng I am am fully aware of electronics and battery risks, that coupled with teenagers wanting to ride the thing will be a challenge.

If you're trying to make the lightest board (per mile of range), regardless of cost or size or cycle count, then LG MJ1 have your back.

If you're trying to make the smallest possible board, I might just go for lithium polymer, though that has its own set of drawbacks, safety being a huge one.

If you're trying to make the most reliable (especially in cold weather) and longest-lasting (in cycle counts) then LiFePO4 is a better choice, but it will be real heavy and large compared to lithium-ion.

Samsung 30Q is best most of the time.  Just use 30Q.

@ZackoryCramer,
Thanks for the @ tip, much faster.  Yeah they are pretty motivated on wanting to have a go.  I'll risk asses how thats going to work then maybe govern the maximum continuous current to limit speed and get them to wear a full compliment of safety gear. The physics kids are the good and keen ones that are mostly behaved:face_with_raised_eyebrow:

One question - who will paid for it? We are talking about teenagers. So in this case you should go with a china esc, hub motor, lipos and a normal clear deck from skateshred. 

Okay mabe not lipos. In this case lions or lifepo with bms cause of little more of safetynes.

@b264 thanks I'll look up the MJ1's as I would like to keep the board lite but it will be a long dancer so its not hugely important.  I could convince myself to make a carbon fibre dancer but then maybe I've just watched one too many diy youtube videos?

People like you change the world for the better man, it might seem small but your esk8 could totally change a lot of kid's lives and inspire them to do something inventive or ambitious. If you want some parts knowledge hit up the esk8 master @mmaner, he is the go to for most people here and has tried most everything you can on a board... twice.😂😂

@dragopepper @Bensaida I'm paying boys its a low socio economic area a good portion of the kids cannot afford a $1k board -thats why we are building two as a group funded by myself and another teacher, we both plan to also use them to commute to work to help justify the expense on our end.

@eb1925 Thanks, I believe that if I can provide some basic skills on putting a project together the kids might have enough confidence to go it alone and tackle more ambitious projects or maybe just have a go at something.  I'll keep you guys posted when teaching begins in a month or so tell you how the kids responded.  The physics students are really keen to get into it.

@dragopepper If the program works well with the first batch of students I definitely think that we could run it using Chinese components and work out a low cost for students if the components are reliable enough.  This may involve system design that is underrated and very conservative and slower (good for safety).  In the first build myself and another teacher a paying for the stuff, I'm going to build a high end unit and the other teacher is building a budget unit.  If the budget unit works safely it could be an option.

@b264 I'll definitely look into the MJ1 batteries, I have plenty of lower amp lipo's that I use in my model planes but I'm concerned from a safety point with them and the way they are packaged. It would require more protection for the cells. I use life packs for receivers also in model planes they are fantastic but expensive and heavy as you suggest.  Thanks for suggestions

Not being able to push is **mainly** a myth propagated by marketing departments of cheap hub motor boards.  It is possible to make a belt drive that sucks to push but if it's done right it's not much different than a hub motor.

Use wide 15mm belts that are properly aligned and the correct tightness

@b264 didn't know that you could push a belt drive, now might be worth looking into as could be cheaper option.  I'll have a youtube and google search to see what i can find in that department. Thanks for the info

it you loosen the tension of the belt with an idler pulley and you allign it proppery it should be almost identical.

You can put batteries underneath the board with a flexy board. You just gotta know how to arrange the battery and solder it correctly which is as simple as any other battery build.

If you ask me, mountain board all the way.

@gee I was planning to to batteries under the board, i seen a mountain board build where they detailed this i’ll Go hunting for it but I d recall they bent around the nickel plate so it had room to flex between parallel packs or something to that effect.

@bevilacqua tension pulleys and the like seem more trouble? The board will be a cruiser dancer so I want to keep motors and other gear out of the way from kicks at the end of the board, then again it might be too heavey with motors and battery?

@bevilacqua decisions decisions, I guess are there any cheaper loaded Tarab equivalent boards or similar that are less painful on the wallet :moneybag: as the build cost is getting way up there? I’m 40 years old and haven’t purchased a board in 20 years so looking at the local shops sites and reviews online is not really helpful. Has anybody had a good dancing board they can recommend?

I saw some guy on YouTube he was trying to make a battery pack. I think he's trying to make 12s4p or something. Instead of solder the nickle strips all over, he solder the 4 batteries for parallel with nickle strips and use thick gauge wire to hook them in series. This allows it a little flex unlike most battery pack. I remember seeing Ebike from ebikeschool.com but I can't find the video.
