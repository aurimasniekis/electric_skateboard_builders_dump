Hi!
I was wondering if it's possible to use a 18650 20s bms on a 10s2p battery pack?

Why would you do that? It will be twice the size! 

But yes, it's possible.

yeah I know, it sounds strange but the truth is that I'm building a 10s2p battery pack for my board. Somehow I ordered a 20s bms instead of 10s. So I'm wondering how the wiring could be? Do I need to connect all the 20 wires to cells or use just 10 of them?

Just 10 of them. Wire them like as if it would have been a 10s BMS. So charge the 10s battery in parallel, not as 20 cells.
