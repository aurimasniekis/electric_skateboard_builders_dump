Hi guys. Been growing for over a month and a couple build parts list later I think I'm ready to take the plunge. Could use some feedback before I actually buy later today. As for the mounts if anyone has cheaper than TB alternative I'd rather get that and use original caliber trucks and avec 11 flywheels.

So looks good to me

-canbus can be had from TB
-I'd suggest the TB Nano remote over the enertion nanox, ergonomics are a lot better
-your battery doesn't have cell type listed. I would stick to known cells... Like 30q, 25r, vtc 5 or 6 etc
