Two months ago i embarked on the challenge of building my girlfriend an electrified scooter so she could ride with me. I did this while simultaneously building my first esk8 which has already been shared on this forum. Today, i completed that mission! Still have to do some finishing touches to seal off the motor and electronics but it runs! Started with a mongoose expo 12" scooter. Threw away everything but the central frame and built everything else from scratch as i built it with help from my works cnc machine and a coworker for a weld. Used a 10s 14ah ebike battery, 800 watt 36volt ebike controller, 800 watt brushed motor and a thumb throttle/power switch. Well, here it is 😎 i will add the early pics later<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/d/9dca21aa2cd8232070dc1355f98046b45a0e5c35.jpg" width="500" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/9/4988633cc1749d2ccf5de073f41c6809e5215059.jpg" width="500" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/d/9dca21aa2cd8232070dc1355f98046b45a0e5c35.jpg" width="500" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/7/678b6862be8901d4c2aee7568b32b7f935929305.jpg" width="500" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/0/901fa10bdfea5b740cff2d060d0e0a7c07343ce9.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/2/d2d50cc4133dd2a3c6af4a13d9d2f7cc368ea324.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/0/d045366ecd94d3d289678b70b218e2cc2a88347e.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/0/901fa10bdfea5b740cff2d060d0e0a7c07343ce9.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/0/101f145194e3ef51daab9378e7bc2b7bff26f3a3.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/0/d045366ecd94d3d289678b70b218e2cc2a88347e.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/9/79a50c28d61ce4d8ecb632f4a4535d7fa69d42b2.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/e/7e6b352ae4e2069497a9d96f7f5c0aa8ab64c1bd.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/c/dc56ca56e0d208120768a1ac75d58bab09f1adf9.jpg" width="690" height="388">[Uploading...]()

Looks good. I like the big wheels and that huge handle bar.

U should paint some flowers on top of the battery and the motor.. would look way more suited to the pink style it has :D otherwise the motor / battery thing makes this thing 'beasty''.. sort of like girlish ride crossed with some mean metal chopper type vehicle :D

How much did it end up costing? How fast does it go?

@Decdog, It costed around $700 roughly and i havent been able to do any speed tests. The weather here in Seattle isnt the best right now😑 also still need to finish covering the electronics and the motor and addressable leds underneath😁

Looks awesome! Yea i was gonna suggest covering the chain drive, but it seems y'all got that figured out already. Super cool.

Those handle bars are OUTRAGEOUS!  Where you get that bamboo ply from, looks so nice.

But what we all want to know is... can it pop a wheelie?

@lrdesigns, no wheelies capable unfortunately lol but the motor is surprisingly quiet. Update, ive covered the motor with custom cnc box and sealed electronics with tupperware and hot glue😁 <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/9/29a044f8a310777136286a4c1aba6339383ea650.jpg" width="281" height="500">  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/2/320f714736291971bc2dbc549b44f3ea14cec2b6.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/8/18e1c4a01ab9054bf940b49fd7176c446ec96717.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/b/db2e88ebc3a916fe3bb71feda637b0c4fdec1ce1.jpg" width="281" height="500">
