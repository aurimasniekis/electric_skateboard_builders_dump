Not sure if these Walmart lights will last but they work good![IMG_20190310_201749957|666x500](upload://4NgS62eRuf8WdK43scESkWbfxzY.jpeg) ![IMG_20190310_201741665|666x500](upload://fZzekKIpodEDjVqFwwPYi5ktuB0.jpeg) ![IMG_20190310_201806262|666x500](upload://nb29FvUldn913GfHZv9dxojydgl.jpeg) ![IMG_20190310_202106922|666x500](upload://uyRQbMz3z8aTn74hgCQyc6AONuG.jpeg)

Cool stuff! Are you referring to the white and red lights, or the RGB ones? Btw, there's a thread for all things lights, you might want to post there and have someone close this one. :slight_smile:

I'm referring to all of them because I bought them all from Walmart lol... but I wasn't really asking a question. I was just trying to show off my build I did on my wife's board

The bright light ropes are great. The plastic tubing comes off but they still work!!
