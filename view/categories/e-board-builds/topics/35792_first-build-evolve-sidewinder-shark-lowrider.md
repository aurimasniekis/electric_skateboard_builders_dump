I'm finally getting some stuff in the mail, nice seeing it all come together.  Got it mocked up so see how it would feel.  Couple things I'm still waiting for. Trying to figure out the rest.  No way I'd be comfortable riding with a battery under the board that low. Going to mount the motors out the back and batteries on top of the back truck somewhere.  

I'm getting these motors, any suggestions on mounts?

Got these batteries on the way.

I think All I'm missing is the VESC, is that right?  Any suggestions?  Have extra for sale? I'm on the lookout. 
I need a charger for the battery too.

you cant use that huge motor with that small wheels...maybe as rear drve
you cant use that small battery pack with 80a motor...
it will be hard to mont any serious pulley on these wheels...(i dont say impossible)

Yeah, those 80mm wheels are not going to work. Even if you do manange to fit pulleys to them, you're not going to have the clearance to use those 6374 motors.

And if you pull that off, Big IF, you're not going to have room under that board for any batteries. Especially configured the way they are. Even layed out flat, no clearance.

Anybody ever hear of a 10S20P battery?

That's too big, but I do plan on using at least 3 of these bricks together on this.  Going to build a case to mount on top of the back truck.  Just not sure on how to integrate a charging port or an on/off switch yet.  

@psychotiller They're actually 70mm wheels, biggest wheels shark offers right now.  Got this kit on the way.

You guys are right about the motors too, I'm looking around for 6355 now.

So even less clearance...Spend a little time thinking about what you enjoy about longboarding. If you want a board that's going to meet any of those likes realistically. There's a not so short list of things you're going to have to change.

I've never owned a longboard up until about a few weeks ago.  I'm building this board as a daily commuter on all paved roads.  Just experimenting to see how low I can really get it.  I don't like the high center of gravity on a raised deck.  If I start putting things together and find that something doesn't work, I'll just look around to see what I can find that does.

Putting it together one piece at a time as it comes in.  Here's my headlight.

This is going to be interesting how you attach the wheel pulley to the shark wheel! Clearance is another issue ...

Imma have to see that.  Please post photos in the photos-only thread when you get that built :-)

3d print an insert that fits the groove on one side and is flush on the other. Mount pulley to the flat side. 

Tough part will be modeling the grooved side to print in a 3d printer..

Fully support your need to ride low. Ask anyone, I hate risers and all those double decker type builds. Just trying to save you some headache. There are ways to do it, and ways not to. As it stands, your motor choice is going to be pretty close to the sames size as your wheels.

3D scan the wheel first, then 3D print a plastic part to see how it fits. Final version in aluminium? In the picture below it looks like as if there are holes in the wheel hub? At least three of these "holes" could be used to bolt the pulley onto the wheel like as shown in the image below.

Took this thing out for a ride and can't believe how much fun it is carving back and forth and riding so low.  This is about how much clearence I have from the deck to the wheel for the motor mount and pulleys.

I'm going with 4 of these packs to make a 10S8P pack.  

For science! I decided to go with this ESC. I'm not too worried about adjusting the ride much, if it works I'm happy.

Thinking about the enclosure to hold all of this, I like the idea of showing off what's inside one of these things.  Shaping this to fit and I'll mount to the top of the truck. Might have a little flex, I'll just add some support.

3D printing sounds ideal to fit something inside the wheel, unfortunately I don't have one.  I just found a washer that fits snug in the wheel from homedepot.  Can't see any holes through the wheel either.  Just going to try and drill straight through.

when you test you battery can you tell me how well it works. I want to do a 10s10p or a 10s8p battery out of them.
