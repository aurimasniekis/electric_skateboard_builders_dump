I'm a keen snowboarder,  Brit living in the French Alps for almost a decade now. Unfortunately I only bget to do this 4/5 months of the year and get massive withdrawal symptoms, until I discovered Electric Skateboards.

After 3 months of soaking in the a vast amount of knowledge, advice and and opinions on this forum I've started on my build. Before I get started a special shout out to @Nowind on hisawesome Mini Direct Drive and @Eboosted for the sleek enclosures he makes, and both for the build threads they have posted on here.

Anyway, here are the guts and all of the build.

Tramp HS11 Deck
Eboosted enclosure
Trampa 6.5" AT Superstar Wheels
ETOXX Mini Direct Drive Black edition
Trampa Vertigo Trucks, (Rear Hanger Machined by @Nowind  )
Dual APS Alien 6374 170KV motors
12S4P Battery using Sony Konion VTC
Dual VESC6 esc
Supower 12s 60A BMS
charger 2 amp, 12s, 50.4V
NANO-X hand controller 2.4Ghz
BT UART module

Photos of the build so far coming up......

I really pounded these APS 6374 170kv motors at 12s for months without any issues, they are amazing

Amazing build man, it's definitely the next generation Pho3nix, the grip tape, the direct drive and the battery boards are sick improvements! Can't wait to see it finished, you will love the ride

Hey guys, little advice needed on soldering 12 gauge wire. I have put the solder spots on my PCB holders, solder on the wire itself. When I come to soldering the wire to the solder spot on the board it is not holding. I‚Äôm a novice when it comes to soldering, but have watched a few tutorials so not sure what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I‚Äôve attached photos of solder I‚Äôm using, solder iron etc. A couple of connections have worked but it‚Äôs a real struggle?![image|375x500](upload://tGrU5HOnkB88uO6RrKv7OG9gVnU.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://kh3iBkACyauDyPmnCBxVoLF317E.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://x7AHR5rkGdvcX5jXFdGO0XzHHfM.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://n4kryHsVP4q0BR1c9RejylMSrD3.jpeg)

What power is the soldering iron? Doesn't look high enough, you need to be able to heat more of the surrounding metal to get the solder to flow and adhere better.

Hi Jonathan, The solder Iron can heat up to 400 degrees plus? Its not the best I'll admit and was quite cheap off of amazon

Do you think I should invest in a better quality soldering iron?

Would recommend getting some flux; as in the tub of brown gooey stuff. I know the solder has some small amount in it already, but I was amazed by what a liberal application of flux would do.

Flux is a good idea, and you may just need to hold the tip on it for longer.
You can usually tell when you've got a good solder job, it flows different to when you have a cold solder joint.

Those looks like they're designed to be mounted onto a PCB. Regular XT90 have semi circular ring coming out to solder to.

Guys, have 3 pins on my charge port. From my research the L shaped pin closest in the photo is for the negative wire. But can anyone advise which of the other 2 to connect the positive lead? And also is 22AWG wire sufficient to use? Cheers
```

That depends on your charger but most chargers have inside plus and outside minus, look at your charger it should be printed on the bottom (the sign in the top left corner of my pic). If it looks like that then the "L shaped" is plus (middle pin). On my charge ports (which look exactly the same as yours) the third pin has no connection. I use 6 of them with different chargers and the polarity is always as shown on the pic.

![dc2|690x425](upload://jcaiP8fg6k5zcpHMs98zFHQPwJ5.jpg)

But you could use a multimeter before connecting to get 100% sure. Plug your charger in the charge port and measure the voltage on the two pins. If there is a minus before on the display you have to swap plus and minus.

If you don't charge above 4-5A it should be enough.

Hey Rich, thanks for advice. I took the reading with the multimeter and got the minus reading so assume my charge port would be opposite to your photo? Checked the charger itself and didn‚Äôt have that diagram either.

Interesting, so when you measure it the opposite way (L shape is minus on multimeter) you get a voltage without the minus, right? If yes then this is the correct way to connect (like you said opposite to mine) and you are safe :grin:

Hey folks, attaching this diagram on wiring up an APS Alien motor HALL sensor. The motors I received came with 4 pin JST plug, which does not fit to the Vedder ESC 6 pin sensor port. So Bruno at Alien kindly sent this over to me. Probably not needed for the DIY gurus but thought it might come in handy to any novice builders out there.

Quick question guys. Battery is complete, BMS balance wires done. The negative lead to the B- on the BMS. Do I use the same size wire 22AWG as the balance leads or the thicker wire, like the positive and negative wires coming off the ends of the battery? 

more photos  of build  coming up tomorrow morning. cheers

COOL build! Just a tip, try to keep the wires from the battery to the esc as short as possible, long wires can induce higher voltage spikes when your on / off throttle and brakes which is hard on the esc. 

Good work on getting the soldering done with such a small iron, generally people use ones with more thermal mass or more power for the heavy wires. One way I find helps is to try to pre heat the wire before bringing the two parts together. Also pre tin both sides. 

You have lived in the the french alps for 10 years that is super cool, can I ask what kind of work you do there?

Motors are not that sensitive to voltage, they only don't like getting too hot which is mostly related to load and amps. So if your way over the suggested voltage you can reduce the load by using a lower gear ratio etc. So long as your not overheating them 12-14s for low kv motors is fine.
```

Cheers due.

Yeah tried to make as short as possible but was having issues with that crappy soldering iron so had a bit of leeway. Anyway, I've gotten rid of that soldering iron and invested in a more powerful one with great results and a lot easier to solder with. But like you said, tinning the wire ends helps massively. 

I've got everything in place. The battery is complete, bar the sparking mishap yesterday due to incorrect wiring on a port with 3 pins. Ive ordered a charge port with just the 2 pins this time to make doubly sure theres no cockup again even though I was pretty sure the wiring was correct after double and triple checking with various sources on here, so I suspect there was something wrong with the charge port itself.

Anyway, that arrives tomorrow, Today I am linking the motor sensor wires up to the my VESCS and should be ready to programme them tomorrow, fingers crossed. 

I won't be gunning it, more like to cruise and carve, like my pow days in the mountains. 

So I originally was working in finance across the border in Geneva, Switzerland. Next year I'm building a chalet to run as a business. üòÅ
