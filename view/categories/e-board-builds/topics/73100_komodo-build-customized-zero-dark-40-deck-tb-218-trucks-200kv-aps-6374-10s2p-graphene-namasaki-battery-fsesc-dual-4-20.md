Just stepped off the first ride on this thing and felt it's finally time to share the story thus far. 

First things first, I want to say that this online community is such a wealth of useful info and helpful people from all over the world, it just blows my mind seeing humanity united over a hobby(lifestyle really) like this. I want to thank everyone who's ever posted on here because you never know who will benefit from your smallest insights into this awesome hobby. I certainly found answers to questions I didn't know I had in almost every thread. 
I came to this forum with very limited if not zero electronics background and some minor skate experience and in less than a year came out with a crash course in electronics, rc, battery building.. everything esk8. 
That being said, I have to say I owe this build to @Namasaki. Without his thread on building a High powered 10s Lipo battery pack I probably never would have gained the confidence to actually buckle down and attempt something like this. 

**So thank you Namasaki you are a gentleman and a scholar** and I _love_ you :sparkling_heart:


Alright, mushy stuff out of the way let's get down to the components:

My goals for my first build have shifted and warped so many times for so many reasons it's hard to say what I initially set out to make. Honestly my first and only goal was to make a board that was fast and looked "cool as shit" because what else would be worth the effort. So I started buying parts that looked good like the MBS Pro 90, Maytech spring trucks, Evolve Pnuematics.. etc. Once I gathered enough parts to mentally piece things together I could see some glaring issues start to appear, so I switched from the initial MTB deck to the ZD40 to simplify the build and get me up and running sooner. 

So here's the final components used:

-Deck is a **Quest Zero Dark 40** hill bomber
I picked this because it's wide and looks "cool as shit" 
https://www.amazon.com/Quest-Skateboards-Downhill-Longboard-Skateboard/dp/B01H755BFE
Once I got my hands on it I stripped it down to bare wood, then stained and sealed it and repainted it with a big lizard because those are cool

![IMG_9050|375x500](upload://6EdMCC9ejEjs3zZEEAullOcRiHt.jpeg) 

-Trucks are TB 218mm's.. I feel like those are self explanatory. Swapped everything out with Riptide and the ride quality was drastically improved (I've since changed that bushing configuration to be more carve-friendly)
![IMG_0391|666x500](upload://wPxYTtqRTHgkHknek6kvH8ZzW6z.jpeg) 
-Angled risers ~85a
I needed a bit more distance between the trucks and the deck in order to fit the components for the volt meter, charge port and power switch which I knew I wanted to be top mounted through the drop thru slots. 
![IMG_0856|375x500](upload://urc3036y7xwMsLTzXoDzfMnZoII.jpeg) ![IMG_0865|666x500](upload://5Eqs03eu7OUrWS0GTkKUIOy5kJS.jpeg) ![IMG_0866|666x500](upload://pIkJUTOIJx1biDNDkXwdPLvQHdY.jpeg) 
The angles also help balance out the steering geometry since the deck has a bit of "droop" from end to end. Its Declined in the back(which makes it about level)
![IMG_9461|666x500](upload://yTqUV51G9lcNVopADs8rUMv2xpa.jpeg) 
and inclined in the front which adds to the already slightly inclined steering
![IMG_0936|666x500](upload://tBEpDwLjTbPZWLJIIqMGlBNddfF.jpeg)
I need to trim those bolts down.. 

-(Sigh) The wheels.. Slick Revolution 110mm 85a Rough as shit wheels.. 
@brenternet, you were right sir I now need some dental work and a new set of testicles after my first ride on the street. Holy shit are they stiff. Every little crack and pebble fires a shockwave through my brand new system, up into the deck, my knees, aforementioned man parts, teeth, eyeballs.. they even shook one of my @marcmt88 mounts loose and those things were _CRANKED_ on with properly cured loctite.
I wanted to love them but they are now temporary as I wait for a set of black MBS 100mm's to arrive. Unfortunately this also means I'll need a new set of wheel pulleys as the ones I got from banggood don't fit the MBS cores (surprise surprise) but, this also means if you're into the Rough Stuff wheels they DO fit quite nicely, which is why I kept them at first. I'm looking at @jlabs modular wheel pulleys now since they are cool as shit and will fit right in. 

-DIY Clamp plates (X-things)
So I loved the idea of the original x thing, from @akhlut I think? And decided to cut my own out of some scrap 3/16" aluminum plate I have
![IMG_9161|690x387](upload://phwK1WlJdwAraIyy3U0ymni33a8.jpg) ![IMG_9158|375x500](upload://2vGngi8GoPpKq9y1Ud2VxezzWaT.JPG) ![IMG_9178|666x500](upload://9tdzSWkTWw6yQnozpHAhD4vSVQo.jpeg) ![IMG_9338|666x500](upload://bsYxultmEko1MKyyatAu0wPX8Di.jpeg) ![IMG_9343|666x500](upload://zb7ESlA3muhGL6HOw0nMEoAyrQ8.JPG) ![IMG_9337|375x500](upload://k93IiNfyb06zMIuqHRcqbcin5as.JPG) 
I just used a cad template I drew up to guide my janky saber saw then smoothed them out on a grinder and drill pressed the hole sizes. The volt meter window was more of a pain since I could only remove so much with circular form of the drill bit and had to come back and hit it with some _force_ from a rectangular file :smirk:
![IMG_0937|375x500](upload://j7rd1WgSHGCHUAvik1u3kpFxzIO.jpeg) 
Also added a layer of 1/16" neoprene to add some cush between the plates and the deck 

-The battery 
![IMG_0940|666x500](upload://n55MxaXdJRLDf9TVzrKVqiOe82t.jpeg) 
HK Graphene 5000mah 2s2p 90c x5 wired into a powerful 10s2p brick of lighting under the gracious and thorough tutelage of the man @Namasaki 
I cannot express how happy I am that when I finally set down the soldering iron and took a step back, holding my breath and sweating profusely as I turned on the power with a stick from across the room, that this whole project didn't just explode into flames and sparks in my tiny studio apartment. The lights came on, and could breathe. I no joke paraded the board around like baby simba in front of my gf while she's trying to watch her shows. 
![IMG_0911|666x500](upload://9mMPUMGF5e0v50SEDsBPfKqN89Z.jpeg) ![IMG_0912|375x500](upload://yDm2UfsfcUPeEfGyAFKXR2S2IXS.jpeg)

-The VESC
So, amidst the recent flipsky hype I got myself a smaller than expected FSESC dual 4.20 instead of my original plan of 2 focbox's. After a fairly long wait to get it in hand, the negative reviews started pouring in.. this was very upsetting. I was ready to box it back up for the shelf and save it for a loaner build.. but then comes along another esk8 saint, mr. @mmaner with his review of the flipsky which proved, at least in the realm of 10s that they are reliable within certain parameters and actually performed halfway decently for their very accessible price point. So after seeing this I confidently picked it back up and continued onwards with the build. After a quick test ride (following the simba parade) with the settings at:

Motor current max: 30a
Motor current max brake: 30a
Battery current max: 50a
Battery current max regen: 40a

The results were adequate, but underwhelming due to the hills in my area. So I came back to the computer and bumped the settings up to:

Motor current max: 40a
Motor current max brake: 40a
Battery current max: 50a
Battery current max regen: 40a

This led to a much more impressive result (for me, a first time rider) 
I still need to mess with some throttle curves, but even with 40 amps this thing really picks up and moves. It's nowhere near powerful enough to start on and incline and accelerate, but it definitely packs enough juice to handle some steep ass hills in my area once it's moving. I am looking into Bluetooth modules and the metr app to log some data and actual speeds, but if I had to guesstimate I'd say today on my first "out in the world" ride I hit at least 30mph very quickly on level (and rough as shit) streets. Worth mentioning I have experienced no cut outs or faults at 40a and I pushed this thing pretty hard today with a couple full throttle starts and hard braking from ~20mph. (This is all in BLDC, haven't tried FOC yet) I may bump it up to 50a just to see what the cut outs are like (if it even will cut out) all in the name of science and higher speeds. 

All in all I freakin love this board and it has far surpassed my initial expectations. I still need to thermoform my enclosure, but I will continue to update this thread as I make more progress, and adjust settings to squeeze out as much power as possible from this little monster :smiling_imp:

Don't forget to tell them (very few ones) that is not any 'lizzard', Komodo actually reffers to the Komodo Dragon...a huge Iguana on steroids!!

Nope not a brand and there's no copyright as far as I know. It's just the name I've been using for this board and two others. I have no plans to start selling Komodo builds or anything, so if you have more legit plans in mind for it or just want to use the name it's cool with me. 

But ya know, don't come sue me for using the name in retrospect lol

![IMG_0998|666x500](upload://5Aq9uqktt4QebgnzLgZeIQ5JnNz.jpeg) 

I tried to charge the board for the first time today :slightly_smiling_face:
and the charge port shorted out :frowning_face:

Went to plug in my temporary 42v 2a charger and immediately got a nice POP and the board went dark 

Scared the shit out of me, but I disconnected the charger, turned off the switch, powered it on again and everything came back and is fully functioning. I checked my wiring over and over to confirm I had the correct polarity at the port and to the BMS and it all looks good. BMS has no signs of burns, although it seems to be warped under one of the heat sinks

![IMG_1002|375x500](upload://1YjSZqm5h2njfbe0gs7a0XReNXp.jpeg) ![IMG_1003|666x500](upload://yF5tmvjqxWBm01mjuTFNkUoWPoD.jpeg) ![IMG_1004|666x500](upload://6cpDudPiI4vghhsJ0MvsOCDOha8.jpeg) 

I noticed the warp when I installed it tho so that wasn't a recent change..

Something I did notice was the numbering of the poles on the charger..

![IMG_1006|375x500](upload://u09fPSMA0dhy1l6pm2OUXe4hRTE.jpeg) 

When I wired it up I went off of this diagram to determine polarity

![IMG_0851|549x249](upload://rvTREV94tGnFrixrj9bR2qT8ch1.png) 

I noticed the numbers didn't match up at all, so I tested the poles at the charger (which I should have done before shoving it into my board like an idiot) and whaddayaknow they're the freakin opposite :face_vomiting: 

![PNG|281x499](upload://2VerqPK512VY8uP7SFMofgpuJpU.jpeg) 

I assumed all 3 prong chargers like this would be standardized since they have that lock channel and can only be oriented one way, but apparently not.. That or the diagram I used was just 100% wrong from the start :upside_down_face:

So when my board popped and blacked out on me I assume that was the BMS saving my ass a lot of trouble and shutting things down before they burned.. and I know that crappy charger is toasted as it now makes all kinds of sounds and pretty colors other than green when it's plugged in.. but now I'm wondering should I be worried about my BMS being fried?? And should I replace that charge port since it arced? 

![IMG_1005|375x500](upload://3eHiFbTLwgAzKAChTRRntaSSVa4.jpeg) 

Im pretty sure things are ok, at least visually but I have a limited understanding of the circuitry of the BMS and didn't want to go probing around with the meter unless I knew what I was looking for..

![image|375x500](upload://9EThm8XXBCA89YcnrIBZVuo0mgq.jpeg) 

The board is fine, but when I checked it out the latching power switch was in the off position as if it had just clicked itself off while I was going full tilt.. not sure if it was from road vibration or maybe it only partially latched when I switched it on? No clue but it makes me nervous it might do it again next time it feels like ruining a nice ride

New wheels came in the other day

![image|375x500](upload://oOcKHusT9B4EDt0GLNMS3PNk7aC.jpeg) 

Got some nice 38t pulleys from @marcmt88 to go with them

I’ve only done a couple short rides to try them out but they are super smooth on the street. Also going from 36 to 38t has boosted acceleration and hill climbing power a decent amount

Got the same wheels (a couple sets, blacks & oranges); glad you mentioned about their performance, haven't used them yet. Also got one single @marcmt88 new acetal delrin 44T pulley to test with the blacks (I'm the test driver for @marcmt88 on that one). Think I'm ordering a second one because I got a second motor for that build, so is moving from single motor to a doble motor build.

Nice, they won’t disappoint you. Going from the 85a 110’s to the mbs 100’s is like going from wooden sandals to some cushy Nike’s. 

44t on 100mm should be some insane torque lol. The delrin is a surprisingly nice material for the pulleys too, it’ll be interesting to see how well it holds up to wear and tear

They feel pretty solid. @marcmt88 posted the mechanical and chemical properties of the Acetal Delrin and look like a formidable material with zero drawbacks. 

Yeah, with the 44T and the 100s will be torquey but the high 245kv Tacon Bigfoot motor will compensate for that.

Bigfoot motors you say.. interesting :thinking:

I’ve used some delrin parts before as bolts and speed loaders back in my paintballing days and they held up very well under constant abuse. It has a very low friction which is great, but also makes me wonder about belts slipping under heavy braking so I’ll have to do some testing on that and see if there’s any difference between that and my aluminum pulleys

Yeah, they are biggg and robust sensorless 6374 motors. Most forum members like them, a few like my friend @b264 don't like them; and they are not expensive, like $62 a piece.

So sad that the graphics will be hide under the enclosure. :disappointed_relieved: 

You can get the Tacon 16O Bigfoots at the same place I got my T-Max GT5335 motors (also big 6374 class).... [HobbyPartz](https://www.hobbypartz.com/nico.html). Sadly, they are not available for sale right now $63,74 (see how funny the played that price with the class type?). They are usually out of stock for long time. I recall they were available during summer.

These motors were originally intended to move RC airplanes, thats why the reason for the high Kvs. The Tacon 160 Bigfoot carries the lowest Kv of them all with 245Kv, thats why is a favorite among Esk8ers.

Nice I’ll keep an eye on that :+1:
That’s funny about the price lol. I wish the 6380’s were priced the same way..

And yeah I’d have to redo the graphic on the enclosure after it was done. That or use a split enclosure

Hopefully soon lol.. I ended up getting a psychotiller enclosure for black Friday so when that arrives I’ll do some minor modification to it and hopefully that’ll be the final step. If it ends up not fitting I’ll restart my thermoforming plan and work something out

Thats the Unicorn right there. I don't know of any other MBS Pro 90 which we could use for another Komodo, except one complete left, here in SF (asking price $ 400+). These boards are really becoming extinct.

Had a bit of a lazy streak thru the holidays 
( :tada: Happy New Year :tada: ), but I’m back at it now and this time with clothes on

![image|690x459](upload://o0nYHY0DIkZF0ee1vT4NCLh1uYD.jpeg) 
![image|690x459](upload://30NtLpTGufkku1Jfodu9HrrpJiI.jpeg) 

Got an awesome Argonaut enclosure from psychotiller and modified it a bit to fit the curves of the deck 

![image|666x500](upload://4Do3NVmMZxvsiR4Hucs2Ai5z5Lp.jpeg) ![image|690x459](upload://od4mJvriaTmVcAQHDrvYMM1FPdQ.jpeg) ![image|690x429](upload://tY9uNYLnwNpbW8fWbKztabm1ZHI.jpeg) 

I cut lines that formed angled tabs out of the front and back that allowed the sides to flex inwards creating a slight concave that matched the deck. This compromised the seal of the enclosure but I will be resealing it with some silicone to close the gaps. 

Also got to attempt threaded inserts for the first time

![image|666x500](upload://6LolJZAchg9O4kaZGw0PX4dX8OV.jpeg) 

They turned out pretty well but were tricky to get placed exactly where they were needed. 2 of the 14 inserts ended up being slightly off enough that I’ll have to adjust the enclosure a bit to get the threads to line up. It’s fine for now since I just want to ride the thing, but those two missing screws are going to haunt me viciously until I deal with it. 

Also I (mostly) covered the bottom of the deck with 1/16” neoprene to give the enclosure something to bite into. It will eventually be 100% neoprene on the bottom, but the first sections came out pretty rough looking so I may reconsider my approach before I finish it up

 ![image|690x459](upload://30NtLpTGufkku1Jfodu9HrrpJiI.jpeg) 


In other news I experienced the infamous cut outs of the dual fsesc 4.20 after changing my drivetrain from 15/36 on 110’s to 15/38 on 100’s. Not sure why but that small change must have put just enough extra strain on the hardware to throw a fault while climbing hills now. The settings were left unchanged so the only difference is the drivetrain. I’ve got my sights set on a Unity now, so hopefully I can get in on the next batch and remove the power bottleneck from the system

Well, two teeth difference by God knows how many revs (pulley turns) will certainly means some difference. from the 36T to the 38T you gain more torque and accelerated faster from 0. With the 110mm you stained more top speed but took longer to reach that... and reduced range. The 100mm gives you more range, no?

That’s true the faster acceleration might be causing it. I haven’t done any real range testing on it yet since I lacked an enclosure until now but I expect the smaller wheels would add a bit of range. I really need to find some better places to ride around San Diego because my immediate area is all dirt trails or rough streets full of angry or oblivious drivers
