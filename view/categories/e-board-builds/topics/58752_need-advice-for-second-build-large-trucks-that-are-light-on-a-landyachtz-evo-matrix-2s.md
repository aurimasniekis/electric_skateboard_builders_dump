Anyone have any thoughts on putting Matrix 2 trucks on a landyachtz evo?

I have a build with TB's 218mm trucks, but I'm trying to find ways to cut down on weight for a second build.  First is awesome, but the thing weighs approximately 30 freaking pounds.

So i'm looking for wider trucks to fit 63mm motors, but that aren't too heavy.

Don't quote me but I vaguely recall that the Matrix 2's are large but light (partially plastic)
