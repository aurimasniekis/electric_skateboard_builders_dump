Cheers, I like how it turned out as well. I had the board scanned by a local digital fabricator (shout out to Eric @ Lunarburn Studios https://www.ericwstephenson.com/), then I took the mesh body into solid works, leveled it, and started the long process of rebuilding it. There are some 60 splines criss-crossing it, done in half model and mirrored over. 

The cloud mesh is on the right, the parametric version is on the left. ![2018-11-01%2012_28_22-|690x388](upload://nneo1m5KieSxxezfUhovp4zFO2Y.jpeg)

I've found the convert Mesh to Body type tools have never been up to snuff. Plus they lock you in at your base geometry which makes root level geometry changes much tougher if you need to make them down the tree.

For me it worked fine, but my deck had a less complex geometry, the main issue with using the mesh directly is that often the coordinate system is not aligned with the mesh, so you have to figure out the new plane to base all of your new features

I love that deck, my enthusiasm has evolved quite Se, I'm more into mid size, kicktail, downhill decks, running 12s5p batteries, really soft 85mm Caguamas and surfrodz.

They're really the best of both worlds. I've only really ridden both a Loaded boosted and their mini, but something in between with a kick tail is where this project is going. 

There's quite simply no room for a 12S5P in this deck, is the advantage of the 5P over the 3P simply one of increased available amperage to the VESC?

The Rayne Darkside was one of the decks I was eyeing too! But I think it's a bit too similar to the Loaded Truncated Tesseract I already have... So I decided to give it a miss...

Yeah of course. They're basically jigs that in theory will let me follow the contours of the board with a router normal to the surfaces to be cut. The jigs shown are the ones for the perimeters cuts and I'll be building large number of removable 'bridge' sections in the jig for hogging out the majority of the middle of the battery area cavity. 

This is all a bit of a test though at the moment, if it fails I'll have to go through the trouble CNC routing the whole thing out but hopefully can avoid that for this build.

Hey yeah I took some inspiration from that guy @whitepony His builds are sicko. I'll be reinforcing the top and the bottom similar to how Whitepony did his but with vacuum bagged fiberglass. I'll be adding about 2.0-2.5mm on top of the deck, and the enclosure cover itself will be about 3mm and rigidly fixed to the board. That should hopefully give me enough structure.

A bit of an update. I got a little off schedule because of work things but the jigs are coming along smoothly. I did a test routing on some 2x6" scrap that went well, and I just prepped the deck and glassed three layers of 17oz biaxial on the top. By the end of next week the battery area should be hogged out and I can get working on glassing the enclosure cover.

12S3P A123 18650 LiFePo
[/quote]

I urge you to reconsider. The 26650 are almost miraculous, but the 18650 are meh. Plus with the lower voltage, might want to consider 14s or even 15s.

Go Sony VTC5A if you want high current with 3p 18650. Or 20700/21700.

Is the downside of the LiFePo 18650 just the lower top speed because of the voltage? They seem to have decent amperage specs. I like the reduced fire hazard safety factor on top of the low profile size.

A123 18650 actually doesn't have many upsides compared to IMR/INR chemistry 18650 like the samsung 30q or various sonys. A123 18650 are more expensive, have poor capacity and not impressive discharge capability in real life.

lifepo4 is generally thought to be safer, but these newer high power 18650 are pretty safe. I think most of the fires come from short circuits and resulting heat, not from cells venting with flame. A123 will happily give you a fire under those conditions too.

Plus BMS and charger selection will be a bit more limited.

Now you will use the purple section jigs to remove the bulk one slice at time?

And about the batteries, since you were planing to use the A123, take a look at Samsung 30T, 40T or Sony VTC6 21700 version

But as @deucesdown said, with 12S3P of 30Q you will have performance to spare

Yeah that's right. The purple bridges will get pulled one by one until all that bulk material is removed. It's crazy I spent 2 months building the board and jig files among other things, and the actual routing once the prints were done (over 200 hours of printing) will only have taken a handful of hours.

I'm 100% thinking of moving away from the LiFePo batteries probably to the Sony's.

## \#41 Posted by: Pedrodemio Posted at: 2019-03-10T04:38:15.680Z Reads: 179

How thick the board will be at the thickest section between the top of deck and the outside of the enclosure?

In my opinion LiFePo doesn’t make sense for or use case anymore, when boosted launched is was the only cell capable of producing enough power without getting too bulk and still producing an “ok” range, now with these high power and high capacity cells they are behind, only use case I can see is when cycle life up to the thousands is important and you need to charge quickly, with the 26650 from a123 you can charge them in 20min, discharge heavily and still arrive at 2000 cycles with useful capacity, for most folks that would be 5 years of daily cycling, by that time new tech will have come out and you will probably want them
```

## \#42 Posted by: walleywalker Posted at: 2019-03-10T04:44:12.743Z Reads: 178

```
That's a good point. I have a boosted clone on the back burner that I think I'll eventually use the bigger LiFePos in just because the energy density is still pretty good. 

On this build though once the material is hogged out, I'll have about 3.5mm of mostly fiberglass on top, then the battery cavity, then 3.5mm of fiberglass in the battery enclosure. Though I'm considering using carbon fiber for the enclosure because I've really removed a ton of material here and could use the extra strength. I only weigh about 165lbs, but I'm still crossing my fingers the board will be strong enough. If it's flexing I'll add more material on top.

Just be extra careful with the screw holes, ideally you have to make them clamp with enought pressure so that the friction is what holding everything in place, not the side of the holes or they will wear down over time

Mine is a junk yard if I do anything in there that lasts longer than an hour.

Maybe he can shed some real world experience on the subject.  Once he gets over the fact I didn't use the correct term twice.   LiFePo.

So here's the update. The jigs for hogging the center bit of bamboo out worked phenomenally - I actually had second thoughts as to whether they would be rigid enough but they held up great. 

I printed off a mold for the enclosure cover and it's currently laid up with 6 layers of 12oz carbon and 2 of 6oz S glass under vacuum. I'll post pictures of it demolded tomorrow.

That's a really nice board coming together. I love the darkside. I have the fortune in 34 inch and just everything feels right on this deck. I am curious to see how strong it will be after removing this much of material, if it works out well I will go the same route on my fortune.

I added 2mm of fiberglass across the entire top of the board before routing the battery area out from the same concern for strength. I should have used carbon cause it's pretty flexy. Because of that I did the enclosure case entirely out of carbon except for the shell layers. I think I'm going to grind away a bunch of the glass on top of the board and replace it with carbon for the added stiffness.

The Fortune is so stiff and the Bamboo core is thick, I guess it should handle this. Since the Darkside has the same Bamboo core with added stiffness from enclosure you should be good. Have you thought about putting one layer under your deck where the cutout is?

I have yeah, but it's got to be really thin like a 4-6 oz which isn't going to add much stiffness. I'll probably end up doing it more just to disguise some of the router artifacts.

Just like the hummie deck, the part of the deck which is surrounding the enclosure with a thicker layer might help a bit.

I think I’m going to grind away a bunch of the glass on top of the board and replace it with carbon for the added stiffness.

It would do far better at stiffening up the deck on the bottom.

I pulled about 9mm of bamboo out, carbon fiber easily has 3-4x the tensile strength of bamboo and I've got 3mm+ of it. It should be quite stiff comparatively once mechancially fastened to the deck.

But its strength isn't the same on the top versus if it was on the bottom , just saying.

Closure is done, the fit is really good, it'll take a little refilling and shaping at some of the edges but I'm otherwise really happy. 

I'm flying out of country for work for the next two weeks so won't make any progress till I'm back :-(

So I finally made some headway again, unfortunately it was re-work only. I had failed to pull all the corners out in my first vacuum bag attempt on the battery cover, so I took another crack at it with some slightly different bagging materials and the result was awesome and all of the corners got pulled so I shouldn't have any issues with fitting my batteries. 

I did a quick truck fit and I should be able to get away with just 1/8" risers which is great cause I want to keep the board as low profile as possible.

Graphics are done for the bottom of the board. The top will be a standard adhesive grip tape.

You guys were right, the board was too flexy with the fiberglass top. I had to take two steps back to get some forward momentum again but there is progress being made.

I've got about 3.5 - 4.0mm of 17oz carbon on the top now after sanding ALL of the glass off... What a nightmare. 

The enclosure is test bolted right now and the board is stiff as a rock!

The deck to enclosure transition is so clean.... 

Awesome! What do you plan to finish the bottom of the deck with? Paint or just clear coat on the wood?

Hey I'm happy to hear that! I spent lot of time just trying to make the transition as smooth as possible. So thank you!

I actually had the graphics printed in high resolution on a BoardLam 3oz cloth. I posted a low-rez version above but I'm going to vaccum bag it to the board once all the mechanical stuff and lighting is in place.
