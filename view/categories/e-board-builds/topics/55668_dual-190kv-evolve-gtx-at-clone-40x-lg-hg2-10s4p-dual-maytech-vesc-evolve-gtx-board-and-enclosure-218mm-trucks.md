Sounds like a fun one.

What materials will you be using for printing the pulleys/hubs ?

I will be using plain and simple ABS with 80% infill. I have great experience with my first board and a 36T wheel pulley, now over 100km on it and almost no sign of wear, it just needs to be printed in the right orientation

Are there really any orientation options when printing pulleys :) ?

You could print them standing up, that would just not make sense. But i found out that increasing the amount of perimiter layers would greatly increase durability.
