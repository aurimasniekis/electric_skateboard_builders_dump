So, I got stuck at the office late last night and most of the day today working on a server for the legal department. The restore went flawlessly, but restoring the file shares...not so much. 

To make a long story short, I got tired of baby sitting xxcopy so I built a board out of scraps, recycled parts, refurbishing projects, etc. Here's the result.

As you can see it only cost me a little over 100 bucks in new parts, and was fun to build. It's super low to the ground, it even scrubs if you carve too hard.  But it's a rocket, looks gnarley too, so that's a plus ü§ò.

So... If you sell it to me for $200 that's a good profit!

So you get to build boards while you're also getting paid to not build boards?! :open_mouth: I think I'm in the wrong business. That's one sweet dumpster fire of a build though.üî• Your leftovers look tastier than mine. I'd even be willing to pay more than $200 for that steaming pile. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Tell us about the $60 6354s. And you have an Evo in the junk pile?

I bought the 6354s from a forum member, a couple of weeks again, for no reason other than they were inexpensive. 

The Evo took a bad spill, we me too, but the Evo got the worst of it. I had sanded and painted it with the intention of building something with it but had no plans. This just sort if fell together üòÅ.

Thanks  It's actually pretty cool, I didn't expect it to be this much fun. The ultra low, ultra wide footprint makes it very stable and it's fast ü§ò.

I'm on day 97 with no days off... luckily it's salary per day,  but still no overtime.

Board looks great,  very jelly. Can't wait till I have a real build and can set this riptide on fire.

At first look I tough the voltage meter and power button on the middle would be weird, but it suits the deck really well, looks great

Thanks  It takes a little getting used too, having stuff on top, but it's not in the way and it's less likely to get scratched if it's on bottom.

I saw lots of board with the same controls on top of the front truck, but I think your solution looks better, I may steal the idea for my next build, but just a small 0,96" OLED display

How waterproof this is? The top is the portion that gets most water when the unexpected rain arrive

I'd like to know this as well. I get caught by light rain on campus sometime and I ended up frying my last power switch with a little water through the button. 

Been rocking a loop key with some hot glue dabbed on the bottom ever since (':

The volt meter is waterproof by itself, the hole the power switch is in is packed with hot glue. I don't know if the switch is waterproof, but I usually don't ride in the rain. I like to slide on purpose, I slide in the rain not on purpose and it sucks üòÅ.

It took about 2 hours for the assembly, I accidentally had almost everything ready to go in a 10 different boxes, so that took a couple of hours to get together and ready. 

Keep in mind I've built around 35 boards at this point so most problems I've run into and solved or got help from.peeps around here at some point and I've pretty much settled on the gear I like to ride so choices are pretty easy. 

It's like everything else in life, it's easy once you know how. If you need some help send me a PM or just post here, there's lots if oros around here. It's only failure if you give up.

Wow,  I get it though the more you build the bigger the spares department gets.  Is that a print for the battery meter?
Great job and very humbling to us mere mortals.

So true! That's why I'm working on my next build. You are extremely on par about the ease of the build the second, third, etc time around. 

Hopefully I can post up my next build soon and get some of the top dogs nod of approval!

This is a pic of my enclosure after 1 day of riding.  I have 5/8in clearance using the 90mm Popoca's.  I think it looks cool, so I'm gonna leave it :metal:.

Very nice build! 

maybe I'll do a lazarus build show you what dirty old junk  parts look like lol :slight_smile:

I must say one if things I enjoy most about my evo build on the wide trucks - stability is amazing,  made me think about @Kug3lis  240s differently :slight_smile:

It may not be Ripba, its the clamp type motor mount for TKP's that I got from you a couple of years ago.  Te original Surf Rodz TKP's that I got and used with the airless 6in wheels?

Hey man, awesome build.

I gots a question, in your spreadsheet what is "max usable kv" ?

Also. how is your hill climbing ability on this, I am interested in knowing how much of a voltage drop/ how many amps you pull when going up.

Yea its not relevant to my 225mm wheels, but still. My board sucks at hills. on 4P vtc6 even with 1:5.3 reduction, albeit a single motor.

That's the highest KV value you can use before going over the ERPM limit.  Hill climbing is okay, it's not spectacular but that's mostly because of the wheels that I used. Strictly speaking the Popocas are traditional street wheels, there are tons of fun to ride and as it's really low to the ground it feels like a longboard, but it's not really made for demanding terrain.
