planning on making some batteries.. i would like to not go bms at this time because of my skill level.. i have an extremely limited space to work with inside my board..

i want to do two 6s in series for a 12s.. my current batteries measurements are 8.75" in Long by 5.25" Wide. it is only tall enough for single battery.. i would like to emulate the same battery sans bms. it seems heavy enough that maybe more cells are present in parallel.. thanks for your time bros.

sure its going to suck and im going to break alot of stuff..  I really need some good guidance here as im not very technical.. I think im going to pick up a good charger next week =)

how does my diagram seem?. is it not enough parallel cells? Ive traced the enclosure and going to grab a dead battery so i can see what fits!!. I intend on using the entire cavity, and will use the dead battery to trace how many i can stuff in there.. I will upload a pic of the cavity of the composite board tonight.

50A 18650s sounds a bit fishy. Are you sure those cells are legit? Also it might be better to just buy [18650s like these](https://liionwholesale.com/collections/batteries/products/lg-hb4-18650-battery-genuine-tested-30a-continuous-1500mah-flat-top-wholesale-discount?variant=21765298308). It would be heavier but you'd get extra range and they're probably safer in terms of actually meeting specs (never heard of AWT, but then again I'm still fairly new to this). Your current pack kinda looks like it's 3 or 4P anyways (EDIT: assuming it's 18650s, kinda looks like lipos looking at it). Also if you plan on charging those batteries, I would definitely recommend using either a BMS or a balance charger, not doing so risks overcharging some of your cells which really is not a good thing. Anyways, best of luck, and make sure you're careful when handling those batteries, they can be pretty scary things

I guarantee you those cells are fake. The real manufactures (like Samsung and A123) haven't gotten 50A and 2600mAh from an 18650 cell yet; there's no way this off-brand has. And I'd personally recommend avoiding gearbest for lithium batteries. I've read way too many horror stories.

does this seem correct? 1500mAh seems low is that correct?

i need to make 2 packs.. i wont know know how many i can fit till i find a dead lipo for tracing.. that will be happening today though

That does look correct. That site, li-ion wholesale, is a very reputable reseller of genuine cells. If it's written on that site, I'd trust it. At 30A continuous discharge, you're not likely to break 2000mAh.

my current batteries are samsung 30Q "i believe", either way i get really long range the only issue i might have is with their ability to draw power on demand as my setup is prone to voltage sags when asking for too much power over a short interval..then again the symptom could point to something else, so i dont have any proof yet.

anyone actively monitor their voltage while riding?

Sony VTC4 seems legit

can i do all the series stuff over xt60 adapters? XD
my wiring looks weird lol i think i c a problem
i changed my wiring diagram, canz anyone look at it and tell me how jacked up i am XD

hey there will!! =) looking at my crappy battery sketch that would be 4 groups of 5?? does that sound right?  As far as the polarity or which comes first, would that happen to be series first? anybody know what the math is

the battery is very well packaged and from a really awesome vendor, i tried taking it apart already and didn't want to screw it up till i get new shrink wrap so i can put it in another wrapper.. heres what the site specs are

Nominal: 44.4v
6AH

Hey dudes! There is space for 20 cells. Thats at least what I traced for the caivity size. can someone inform me of the grouping once I get these vtc6 cells... can i hot glue them.. I really want to for some reason probably because i just bought a hot glue gun.. Here is what the battery is going in, I took it out to trace and i have to replace a dc pig tail that got fried last week when charging at an angle =/ Scary flash, I didn't like it at all... and i dont have space for xt90

https://ru.nkon.nl/sony-us18650vtc6.html

Another alternative that you could measure is 20700 cells instead of 18650 - they are larger but will be even better capacity and current wise.

BTW: according to the discharge curves the VTC6 seems to not be that much better than a 30Q. Better yes but I am not sure if you will notice much of a difference. The 30Q are already pretty good in terms of voltage sag

i could do longer cells but not taller, just measured its 3/4" tall inside. i couldnt prove it was voltage sag, as I was not actively monitoring i get cuttoffs though randomly under full load could very well be BLDC settings I never did the calcuations myself , and used suggestions

If you're buying from a reputable seller, I've seen very few 18650 duds. It's usually all or nothing (ie all fakes, or all fine). Many still do buy 1 or 2 extras and end up using them for something else, so it may still be worth it if you get bulk pricing

ITS HERE!!! XD

going to dig up some tutorials.. i noticed only the left side makes a clicking noise and timing them both to go "up" is rather difficult.. alright.. Cells are coming very soon... excited mine came with some nickle strips to get me going 12s here I come!! Where do I get the battery wrapping stuff I know I need at least to cover with tape first then the shrink wrap..  still havent decided which BMS but ive got some nice pics that might help clear this up.. I can't really use my right arm right now as I dislocated it in my fall this morning(worst feeling ever),  but once I heal up I should be able to ride.. If anyone has vesc suggestions that are affordable let me know.. im in the ~150 range..

That's not old enough to have any affect, I would check that all the cells in each P is welded, if not you could be getting proper voltage but less range and bad sag
Just check the voltage on each cells positive and neg terminal, not the nickel, if some are loose they'll have a different voltage from the rest

ya long ass time since i started this.. i feel the guilt trust me! Had school relocation, and a gauntlet of problems to overcome, even almost had to quit eskate.. but hey here it is, and im GOING to finish it..By the way that 12s2p blew the rear series connection, the cuttouts i had were from the focbox resetting most likely. it was crazy 2 c that i melted the dc pigtail but the cells are still good i think =)

So far, ive managed to build 2 packs each containing 6 series connections.. im still missing some information however, im emulating @stimm 12s4p build as closely as possible. i am aware from @b264 that ive made some mistakes, and hoping to rectify and share the information I get. i got some really good info from @Deckoz and should be able to finish all the welds by next week. my welder isnt performing well with 2 sheets of nickle, however i will have to do even more welds to account for that. after next week if all goes aaccording to plan i should be able to figure out the balance/phase wires and do my main terminals.

all tips, comments, and help is welcome here :rofl:

Got the left pack done. Probably should have charged the cells before hand so I can verify the pack voltage. But guess I'll let the bms sort that junk out.. might run out of nickel strips so I'll probably order some tomorrow, had to do a couple of additional passes with spot welder. The more I stare at my 12s2p the more similarity I c between them. Probably will just follow the balance lead orientation for that one. Need to figure out switch main leads and charge situation that will most likely be harder than the balance leads. More to come soon. 

Is it chill to bridge the 2 packs with xt90. Slightly concerned with connecting the two packs together so that's why I would like to use the xt90. I don't like sparks, and my chest already hurts 😑

I’m actually building a 12s4p with the same layout.

There will be no sparks making the serial connection. If you don’t short anything that is.

You should double up on the nickel on the series connection if you are using 0.15mm. Shouldn’t say should, but I am anyways 😀![image|666x500](upload://eBoWEEf4KTooBnmwMEmMIeBlSkl.jpeg)

Solder them directly to the nickel or solder it to a strip of nickel first and then weld it to the cells.

You should do some more reading I believe.

But from the pictures I've seen I don't see how they managed to solder it before welding. Will follow this thread so I can have a look at how you solve it :)

welds are not holding up, removing the kapton some are starting to peel off, postponed until i can get another welder :rage:  im throwin it in the garbage once i get something different. i will still solder the leads and keep reading, till i get this sorted

Got a welder on the way thanks to @Exiledd_Top should be shipped out Monday. I'm very close to a hobby shop so I'll grab a 3s next week. Both packs are done. I compared the voltages side by side and they are identical. This is good news, downside is my  420-5M-15 were not enough to length on tb218 with Marc mounts and the evolve at kit.. so waiting for belts yet again... 😴

Plan to follow this here. Looks like I need to figure out where to implement the eswitch. Also I will be moving away from the circular dc style charging plug as it was spark prone and slightly annoying. Having the arduino welder now, should make things easier, @Acido how u been 😀

@Deckoz u have experience with these units?😅

increase the number of pulses to like 3-4 and the thing to the right to 2-3 and lower the time to 2-4ms for welding to a battery and 5 for nickel to nickel
also charge the battery fully :)

The labeling makes it a little tough does this look better 🤣 lots of seconds and milliseconds floating around I probably need to charge it can't find charger gahh😐

So I'm concerned 3s source @20c is maybe just not good enough

Hey, so on 3s with .15mm nickel

Try

4.5-6A
X2 or X3
1.5ms between pulses

The last number(2.9s is the time it waits before auto welding) adjust that to your comfort.

Well sideways not up and down, and press down to make good contact.

Like:

A is the big number in the middle... When the A is flashing. It's really pulse length... And saying it's in auto mode...

So big number middle is how long the well is. Multiplier is how many times to do that weld,and Ms is how long between the welds...

I use two 4S 4500mAh 45c in parallel. Tried with 3S 6600mAh 50C but I didn’t get as consistent welds as with the 4S packs so I moved back to them.

It was not recommended but since it work better for me I stayed with it rather then buying higher quality/higher burst 3S batteries. The 4S i use in my RC truck :) I think you need a high C-rating for them to work. Recommended is around 4-5000mAh 50C if I’m not mistaken. What capacity is the pack you tried with?

20C what? A 2200mah 20c will output 44A and a 20C 12000mAh will give you 240A (that should be enough-ish in the lower end).

erroded tips mean more delays


![1527438236345314146907|281x500](upload://1oXQ40GmQbXqAPrhBhcAEW2dwN.jpg)

Some welds are good and others are like impact craters

Once I get the new tips maybe I can solder them to existing pen

I cut the tips down, unsure if the electrode surface needs to be rounded off ..😑

Just going to proceed. Most of the welds look pretty good. 🤣

![15274589878991866226727|281x500](upload://aDUyClTuBk1NQPEBFcgNw9896EX.jpg)

welds are better if you angle the electrodes a bit like 30 degrees

All new 30q cells, electrode surface degrade quick with 3x weld setting it seems.. I need to construct a new pen at least I took my current one apart. Not sure if rounded tips will help fix my inconsistency. I feel like I tried various degrees.. not very happy tho
