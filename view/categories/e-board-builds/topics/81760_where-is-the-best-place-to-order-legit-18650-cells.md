Looking to build a 12C4P pack. Currently using 4 X 3Cell 5000mah RC packs and wanting to build a 18650 pack with BMS.

where are you located? best place in NA is https://liionwholesale.com/ or you can buy 30q cells from @thisguyhere

What is the max amp rating that most people use for ESK8 packs? My ESC is 100A max and I usually run it at 60A peak.

Samsung 30q cells are the tits right now. they advertise 15A but people have comfortably drawn 20A from them.

[eu.nkon.nl](http://eu.nkon.nl) if you're in the EU, [ru.nkon.nl](http://ru.nkon.nl) outside the EU. Shipping is a little slower and more expensive, but the cells are cheaper. IMRbatteries sells 50 30Q cells for $211 incl.shipping to California. LiIonWholesale wants $224. Nkon wants $185.

There are a dozen different cells that are used in esk8, but by far the most common is the 30Q, because it's a great compromise between price, current and capacity. There are better cells, but not at that price point.

There are higher capacity cells, but you lose out on discharge current.

There are higher discharge cells, but you'll lose out on capacity.

There are cheaper cells, but the suck all around.

Thanks. I've been using Foil Cell Lipos for years with RC Heli's, but these single rolled cells are all new to me. Seems like there is a ton of BS and counterfeit stuff out there. 

 Maybe I'm better off just sticking with the RC style that I know inside and out or just buy a pre-built 10C pack.

There are pros and cons either way. Lipo pouch cells are prepackaged/wired and thus easier to work with if you're not comfortable with soldering/spot welding, and they have a higher power density, meaning for a given power output the pack can be smaller and lighter. 

They're a lot less energy dense though, so you'll get a lot more range from a pack of cylindrical cells than a similar sized lipo pack. 

Cylindrical cells tend to last more cycles, so for a board that you expect to see a lot of use, you might end up having to replace lipos a lot sooner than if you used cylindrical cells.

just make sure to not overheat the cells or else there will be damage.

thanks @b264

i get my cells from nkon / liionwholesale, they're legit.

but...not taking orders for a while, gotta get caught up with the orders i have now.

You can build your own spot welder. I am making my own for about $50 AUD. It uses a microwave transformer, spotwelder timing circuit and some welding tips clamped to the wire. Super easy and I should get some good welds. @Scream made one too, I’m copying him pretty much

60 A is a generic listening value, can anyone use this powerful power?
EVOLVE's GT mode is roughly 30A.
This is a numerical value confirmed with remote control.
Raptor2 's 97 mm reach 53km/h at 12A.
For me, I think 60A is tremendous power.

60-80 A discharge (and more) is very common on diy builds.

Everyone speaks 60~80A discharges as normal.
Is my riding technique significantly inferior?
Or am I misunderstanding something?
I could not handle 30A of Raptor 2.

Hmm that’s weird, I run 30 per motor on my dual board and it does have good acceleration but I could handle a little more. Are you talking per motor or total amps

Another thing I’ve noticed is that people used to riding low power production boards tend to full throttle from a standstill quite a bit, and then when they try a custom diy board they full throttle like they normally do and get sent flying. This happened to my friend when trying my board even after I told him to be gently on the throttle

That is the premise of Battery MAX of VESC. Motor MAX is 80A.
As you say, I want to know the difference in recognition between the production board and the DIY board.
I prefer a mild setup to tolerate trigger misoperation.
Still, for me, Battery MAX60A is too strong.

Raptor 2 is limited to 40A by a dedicated BLDC Tool.
The professional mode in Raptor2's dedicated BLDC tool was 26A.
It is a terrible acceleration even with 26A.
Voltage also drops greatly.
In the forum, the topic in the discharge current always feels like a different dimension.
In this forum, EVOLVE is a child's toy.

In this forum, Evolve's GT mode, 30A of Raptor 2 is slow setting?
Or am I misunderstanding something?
I want to know the truth.

I understood that it is an amp for uphill torque.
Since I run only on flatlands, I did not care about the uphill torque.

Another question.
Can anyone easily handle large discharge even in a flatlands?
Always skillfully manipulate large discharge settings considering uphill slope?
Is there sometimes throttle fully open on the flatlands?

```
You’re unlikely to see high discharge (above say, 30A) in normal riding conditions on the flat. I don’t know for sure, but (assuming flat terrain) I don’t think I’d be able to stay standing on my board in a scenario where the vesc was putting enough voltage into the motors to warrant drawing 80A continuous from the battery.

But remember, the max battery current is the absolute max. You wouldn’t set it to 20A just because you mostly pull less than 20A. You want to set it at the highest current that you might reasonably expect your setup to draw from the battery without breaking anything. A lot of people set it to 60A or 80A because their hardware is capable of it, and because they think they might pull that current, even if it’s just for a split second.

You wouldn’t want to be halfway up a hill, going a decent speed, hit a slightly steeper gradient and have your vesc just shut down on you - unless there was actually a danger that something was gonna burst into flames or melt or something.

Very persuasive explanation.
I could not understand it for me who only ran on flat ground.
