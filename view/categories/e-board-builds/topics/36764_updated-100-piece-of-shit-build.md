As the title says, I'm going to try to build a board using some parts I have, and with a $100 budget. I was inspired by @longhairedboy's penny board death stick to bring my first build back to life. (See picture)

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/a/0a2a4dcd4e0828b90754a589f5dc0191ad9028b9.jpg" width="690" height="347">

The difference is that this time, instead of using a VESC and high quality lipos, I'm going to do it as cheap as possible. I'm hoping that by building a board for cheap, all the new members that come here and say "I want to build a board on $150 or $250 budget" will see my post, and see that though it can be done, the result is shitty, and it's better to spend the money and do it right the first time. Also, it will be nice to have a board I can beat to shit and not care it blows up one day. 

So here are the parts I already have: 

High quality, custom CNC motor mount :joy:

Yes, those are zip-ties holding it onto the trucks. 

And 6372 192kv SK3 motor

I will also be using the 76mm flywheels seen in the original picture.

The parts I plan to buy are:
ESC ($43)
https://www.ebay.com/itm/302439713065?var=601271115890
Batteries ($36)
https://www.ebay.com/itm/172630688902
Gearing ($15)
https://www.banggood.com/Pulleys-And-Motor-Mount-DIY-Parts-Kit-For-839097MM-Wheels-p-1139648.html?rmmds=mywishlist


I figure that between the parts I plan to buy and parts I already have, the total cost for this build, assuming a motor off eBay or BangGood, making your own motor mount, and generic flywheels is about $160.
I plan update this post once I get the parts in and get the board built. I'll do a review on how good (or bad) it rides, and who knows, maybe this will turn out to be a half-way decent board for a cheap price. 
Let me know what you think of my part choices and make your predictions for how bad this board will perform :grin:

That mount is not going to work well. It's so far off from being square that the pulleys won't be parallel and the belt will never stay in place 

My advice is to spend your $100 on burritos and push your skateboard instead. You're going to get farther in the end

each pack is limited to 10a, so using one pack will only give you 10a continuous.  
I have 3 of these linked in parallel for 30a continuous, which IMO is a bare minimum

I beg to differ. I actually used this mount on my first board, as I mentioned. This POS mount worked nearly perfectly. I cruised on flats up to 25 mph and easily climbed hills with it. It may look like shit, but it does its job. :wink:

The belt tension must pull the mount back in, counteracting the force from the zipties 

I didn't mean to offend you, but a mount held on by plastic zipties while going 25mph seems super sketch.  Be careful out there, my friend

No offense taken. I agree with everything you said though. The belt tension does pull on the mount and it is super sketch, but I figure, what's the worst that can happen? The zip ties snap, the mount comes loose and belt becomes so lose that it has no effect on the board, in which case the board just becomes a regular penny board and I just ride out the momentum till it stops.

Why not use a $8 hobbyking mount? Way better and less sketch, still basically no budget impact.

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/motor-mount-5.html

If the goal is to make a cheap ass skateboard, might as well make the best cheapass skateboard. I feel like you could achieve decent reliability pretty easily for sub $300 (given that you have the board and the motor already)

I would, but it's currently out of stock/back ordered, so I plan to wait until their back in stock. Also, I think it's too wide, to fit on my truck and still have room for the wheel pulley. As it is, with this ¼ inch thick mount there's barely any room.

@paragon I think this is cheaper than lipos for what I get. I don't think I'd be able to get a 4400 mah 10s lipo for $35.

Update: 

Almost all of the parts finally came in. I soldered on larger bullet connectors to the phase wires of the ESC to fit the ones I already had on my motor. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/0/5000edfcb7c03aed16cb4067d514279135ccaa9d.jpg" width="593" height="500">

I took a short ride on it and so far it's exceeded my expectations. Obviously it's way slower than a dual drive or even most singles, but the start-up is smooth and the motor runs quiet. As far as I can tell, the battery is performing fine as well, seems to have no trouble delivering max amps the ESC calls for (which is about 30A burst).

For a first board or even a cruiser board, this battery-ESC combo seems to be a good budget option considering it comes in at under $80 for both and once you have them, all you need is a motor, a mount for it and some gearing.

I currently have it all strapped under the board in a cardboard box. Obviously I won't be riding it like this, this is just for testing purposes.

Thanks for the update. I've been pretty plesantly surprised with these cheap esc's + remote combos myself, that's a huge cut in the cost to access one of these boards. 

Honestly, I think this kinda goes to show how the market has progressed. It's not unrealistic for someone to make a very solid 10s2p + cheap ESC build for around $200 that's quite reliable, if not all that one might want for speed/torque.

Yeah I agree, and honestly, the board is Fun to ride. I can't quite describe it, but there's something to be said for zipping around on a really carvy cruiser that weighs less than 10 lbs, as opposed to a 20lb dual motor behemoth. 
I have a few more things I've got to finish before the board is really ready to ride, but the more I ride it, the happier I am that I built it.

Motor mounts that fit caliber, paris, TB 218mm, Bennett vector and surfrodz indeesz hex trucks.  They can be set up to run on 50xx or 63xx motors with wheel size from 80-107mm.  Dual idlers are used for belt tensioning and preventing from tooth skipping.

Update: So far this board has Far Exceeded My Expectations given that I only put $100 into it. It accelerates as fast as I'd want it to, with power to spare. (Keep in mind this is on a penny board so the maximum acceleration I could withstand before being through off the board is much less than on a longboard). Never the less I very impressed with the board. 
The pulley kit finally arrived and it's worked great so far. For $15 and a month of waiting, it's a great deal. 

I think this would make a great first board, and I'm planning to keep it and use it for when I just want to take a smaller board. 

The one problem I have is the shape of the battery. It is about 2.5" tall so it practically touches the ground when it's mounted underneath the board. I've come up with 2 solutions. Either mount it on top of the board like a lot of guys do with their Trampa builds, or disassemble it and remake it into a smaller pack using the cells. I think @GrecoMan has do that with this battery. How difficult and time consuming is it?

Skateboards will only last for like an hour or two with their batteries. Then they'll be out charging for another 1-3 hrs. I doubt much will break in that time frame. Maybe a handful of ESC faults will happen, but nothing catastrophically spectacular...

I wasn't saying have a 24 hour race. (I can't even imagine riding for 24 hours straight).

I'm simply saying the concept of everyone making a cheap board for fun and then competing would be fun.

IE: 100 yard race on boards under $200. Or road race on boards under $200

UPDATE: Confirming what we already know: Cheap Parts are Shit. So the battery has been randomly shutting off after less than a half a mile these past few weeks. I've been riding my other board, but I finally got time to look at this one and figure out the problem. 

It appears that the battery (10s2p of LG Lions with BMS) is dead. It sits at a nominal voltage of 36volts, measured with a DMM, and then turned on the ESC. Simply turning on the ESC (pulls less than 1Amp, and the voltage of the battery drops to 14 volts, measured on the DMM.) So basically the battery can't handle any load or it dies. Maybe I got bad cells or something cause I think @GrecoMan made a 10s6p pack out of these an I haven't heard of any problems. Either way I'd say avoid these unless you want to take your chances.

Yeah, I'm currently deciding what I want to do with this board, but if i revive it, I'll probably go with 5x2s lipos for 10s for about $70. 

I already had the flywheels and motor, but you could pick up a banggood motor for $40 and generic flywheels for $20 to keep it under $200. 

I actually was gifted a new deck and trucks this past christmas, so all the components are currently mounted on that. I also picked up a mount from @marcmt88 to fit the new trucks and remove the sketchiness factor. If I get new lipos this would actually be a pretty decent cruiser for under about $300.

![IMG_0359|666x500](upload://nT9HKt4esqS0maswl5C6ZzZbYUM.jpg)

I think it'd be really fun if a bunch of people did shit builds and then at the next performance day, we had a category of max budget: $200 or $300 boards.

I was thinking more of doing the normal performance day events (50m, 100m, and figure 8 or loop), just on crappy boards and see whose was best at that
