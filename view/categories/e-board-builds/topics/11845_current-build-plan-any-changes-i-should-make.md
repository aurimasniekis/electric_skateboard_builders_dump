Normally i dont hijack a thread but this time you asked. I assume he means the antispark kit

Looks like a solid build list.  

just to confirm the "street devil" trucks are caliber clones?  In order to fit the Enertion motor mount - not sure how much a clone varies from a caliber.

50 cells 18650 ?  what are you running 10s5p?  How will you charge?  if standard charger (two 5s packs) works i'd recommend the inexpensive/good-value iMax b6ACv2.  If you are going "plug and play" via BMS - i'll let one of those more knowledgeable comment w/ suggestions.

For your enclosure - i'd suggest looking at Kydex or GF/CF for weight savings.  There are a few folks here and elsewhere online that sell kydex enclosures.

Look forward to seeing the build - GL!

I belive so, im not so sure about the trucks though, i might change them.

Yes im building a 10S5P i will get a 36V li-on charger and use a vga plug as a balance connector. that way i wont need a bms since the VESC has a low voltage cutoff

if you are going with a lipo charger - i would suggest when you build your pack, you split it into two 5s packs vs one large 10s pack.  Nearly all basic lipo chargers will charge 1-6s.  Charging more than 6s requires a more expensive charger.  So you can use something like the iMax for parallel charging two 5s packs.

Now if your budget allows i'd also look at the iCharger variants - great chargers!  You'll need a DC power supply for most if not all of the high-end chargers.  This converts your wall voltage (120 or 240v depending on your location) to DC voltage (usually 12v - though some iChargers in particular like 24v).  A great inexpensive, but high output DC power supply is an old Server power supply.  A simple conversion lets you get 1 or 2 in series for 12/24v.  I have two for 24v 1500w - waaay overkill for what i need, but nice to have.  I have an older iCharger 306 (30amp 6s max).

HTH - GL!

I used aluminum for my enclosure on my newest build and it came out great!

You just need some insulation for sound.

here are some more
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/p29-jet-vesc-8s-10ah-lipo-slim-aluminum-enclosure-led-brake-turn-signals/11920

the noise not bad most of the time, I just spayed the inside of the enclosure with plasticdip to dampen sound and vibration more. I think i'll spray the deck also.

I also put a piece of foam between the battery and alu since the sheet is thin. still need to figure out how to blend the edge... or cut it shorter...
