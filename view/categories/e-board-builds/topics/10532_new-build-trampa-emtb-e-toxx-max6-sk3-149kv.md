Hi guys,

I just had my first ride today with this build.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/4/a4563c08b35b9e6aa6e586ed76e02b116f8988ee.JPG" width="666" height="500">

I managed to squeeze around 4km with 10A 6S battery. I think half was uphill.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/9/e97a016bbdf6f1242c16f48243b79186f6e1bd91.png" width="281" height="500">

The battery died pretty quickly, even the meter shows half voltage the esc's does not power the motors anymore.
(I have another 4 x 8A 4s battery dispatched to make a 8S2P setup) 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/a/ca35cff11a601db550392ce45a2974d5d623db56.JPG" width="375" height="500">

I went home to charge the battery with [this charger](http://www.modelsport.co.uk/overlander-ts80-80w-touch-screen-ac-dc-10amp-charger/rc-car-products/403658). It took 17minutes for fast charging with 3-4A current, even the display shows 749mAh capacity charged. Isn't this strange? Something must be wrong, is it way too fast.

Thanks @Nowind and @EssEnn for the help calibrating the ESC's

looks nice - its a trampa build - NOT gonna be cheap, so why the cheap battery? 
(HINT: use Li-ion...)

```
wait, is your voltage meter showing all your cells around 2v? 

you can't drain lipo cells below 3.2 (maybe 3.0 if you accidently push it) before ruining the battery permanently.. that is probably why it only charged 700mah or so.
```

Yeah I dont think that is right as what @cmatson just said. 

This Lipo's should charge to 4.2V max and 3.2 Minimum. Something is not right. 

I chose the same thing as you with batteries almost as I went Lipo as well although I got some Zippy flightmax's. For me it was about price and ease to replace. I can also carry more battery packs for a longer range. 

I see you are in the UK and London in fact. Fancy meeting up one day for a ride? I live in Windsor so I can come into London for a burn about hampsread heath some time! Also what app are you using to track your rides?

@ciocan great build! Like @cmatson said, if you drained your lipo cells this low you may have destroyed your battery, so proceed with caution. Does this ESC not have a low voltage alarm? It should have stopped you from going that low.

@ciocan If I'm understanding what you're saying, you charged your 6s battery up to 22.2v (3.7v/cell) and then stopped? If so, you've only begun the charging process and still have a ways to go. Your batteries should be charged up to a max of 25.2v (4.2v/cell), and discharged down to about 20-21v (3.3v-3.5v/cell), at minimum, for decent battery longevity.

@ciocan the values of the voltage on the pic are too low (-2 V) that battery may be compromised already, be careful with the lipo.

Hey Dude,

nice that you got the beast running.

The used Lipos are in 1P configuration not a good choice, i know they are cheap but thats all.
Now they are damaged for sure, be carefull with this pack! Would not use this anymore my friend.

If you wanna stay with Lipos i recomend this ones as 8S-2P config:
http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__73778__ZIPPY_Compact_6200mAh_4s_40c_Lipo_Pack_UK_Warehouse_.html

Many of my friends and me are using this Lipos for long times, just as the 6S ones.

If you wanna go with the 18650 stuff you should give @barajabali a call, heard more then one times that he is building very nice packs.

Keep on riding.

Thanks guys for the battery tips. It was rookie mistake, I had no idea that how it worked, I had the impression that can be fully discharged. On top of that, to squeeze more juice I deactivated the low battery warning from the ESC. Then it goes directly to the battery graveyard.

Ah dude, sorry to hear about the batteries. Here is another hint I figured out. When I got my batteries I first discharged them using the storage charge mode on my charger. This balanced discharged my batteries so they finished at the same voltage. I then did a full charge in balance mode so all the cells finished at 4.2v. 

Also reading up on lipo's, you should not leave them fully charged or discharged as this shortens the battery life. 

@ciocan I'd love to meet up for a ride that weekend, I iist need to double check I have the Saturday free but I think I do

Finally, I build the  LiIon battery back. 2 x 4s8p with a total of 8s8p, the max capacity for eZRUN MAX6.

I did not have access to a spot welder and I chose to solder with a copper wire. Total time around 4 hours.
Tip: I made the copper wires a bit curvy especially between the anodes. It will be way harder or never to make a short circuit in case of overheating.

I have to say that I'm impressed. I had two runs about 30 minutes each (around 12km in total) and still had 10-12% left. At some point I wished to be empty already and go home because I started to feel exhausted.

I totally recommend the G-Form body protections. They are not cheap but they are incredible. You can wear the elbow and knee protections under your clothes and barely feel them. And I had two hard falls directly on my knees and I did not feel a thing.

One thing I wished I had is the motor mounting to have enclosures for the belt system. All the grass and dirt is stuck between the parts because of the grass carving.

Man that was fast getting the packs together! How are you charging?

How hard was it to solder the packs together? Looks like you did a pretty good job there and I might have to build a pack by spring now. I get about 20-25 minutes of ride time with 10,000Mah which is fine as I start to get tired by then but I'd like a hours ride time so I can go exploring without having battery anxiety the whole  time.

If you don't want to worry about dirt and grass then you are going to want chain drive but it is more messy and a lot noisier.

Nice.
If i get it right you dont have secured the motorwires next to motors?!
What i mean is that these wires coming from the Turnigys are not flexible, if they are unsecured they move too much and can be damaged. You see the massive movement in your video as well.
You should ziptie them on the braces, that way that only the silicon ESC wires can move.
Hope you get me right.

Yeah grass and mud is not the Beltdrive best friends.

Keep on riding Bro.

Do you have a watt meter? Would be cool to find out how much an emtb ''hogs'' while riding on grass! I rode just on asphalt today, with 6s 192kv 9inch wheels, 4.33 ratio and it pulled around 60 amps / 1200watts (max). About 5-20A, when cruising (5kmh - ~20kmh)

@ciocan  

I use G.T. Power analyzer. There should be some on amazon. On ebay they are quite cheap. Around 15usd max. 

150A peak. Continous is about 70A or so (at least what description says)

There are multiple versions. Turnigy also makes some.
Though there was a test on youtube and they dont work that precisely in low wattage range ~50w

Cool! Nice to see one more eboard rider using it! 

I now wonder how much amps would one motor consume in your situation (terrain)..

Maybe when riding on grass it is more productive to have 2 motors instead of one! 

Does it also show average consumtion or such? I've seen your model but have not focused on the details and differences between the one I have.

Does not show average consumption, just what is displayed on screen.

It seems that is not working properly for totals.
It is setup for 100Ah (4x5x2 cells of 2.5A)
After 20 minutes of riding the display was 97% full but when I checked home with the balance charger it was 23%.
Something is wrong, I'll investigate more at next ride.

It seems that You didn't get Your battery capacity correctly, I guess 100Ah is wayyy to much for this battery case, it would have to be ten times bigger to accomodate such size of battery.

You have an 8p battery, if each cell is 2.5ah then your total ah is going to be 20ah. 23% is likely the accurate number.

@ciocan at what level do you intend to stop discharging cells?
Also - does your charger charges till 4.1 or 4.2v per cell?

I usually try to stop at around 3.5v per cell. My turnigy charger shows that about 10% capacity is left at this level. Though it only charges till 4.1v per cell in default config.. so 4.1v is 100% and not 4.2v.

Wrote a long reply to only find out you also got 80w charger.. that's why it takes so long to charge the cells for you, too. 

Have you considered buying a more powerful charger?

I think it is worth to consider chargers in 150w+ range, if you're usinh batteries larger than 8ah. 

I use ~62w for charging (out of 80w max it could offer) and it already takes around 3 hours to charge about 7ah into the pack or about 1ah in 25minutes (6s at 2.5A)
```

@Okami

4.1 is the charging voltage for li-ion on my charger. I charge them until around 4.05 and I discharge when riding around 5%.
(I made a mistake couple weeks back and I overcharge to 4.1 for 15minutes more because the cells were unbalanced and was .05 difference. Because of this, 3 series went unusable)

I have a dual balance charger with 2x100 watts. I can go up to 10A each row, and it will charge around 3 hours for 8p.
The average current input for 8p was around 7A. Now I have only 5p left and I charge with 5A.
```

## \#32 Posted by: Okami Posted at: 2016-11-26T17:23:57.027Z Reads: 105

```
Well, if you charge them as 4s or even 8S, I believe you cannot get 10A.. 
10A x 16v = 160w, and for 8s (4x 8 =32v).. the wattage would be 320w already..

So, it is better to look at watts rating of the charger, not the amp rating.. I believe you can charge 2s pack at 10amps.. as that would be around 80W...

It is safe ok for li ion to go till 4.2, so I think that is a safety margin they have made, to just charge till 4.1.. and it also of course, prolongs the life of li ions..
```
