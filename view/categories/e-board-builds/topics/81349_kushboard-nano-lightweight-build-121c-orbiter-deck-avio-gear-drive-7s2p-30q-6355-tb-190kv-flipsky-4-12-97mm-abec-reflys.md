I built a Jet Spud commuter board last year in June, and was just recently upgraded to 107mm wheels and a gear drive. It was a 10s3p with a 190kv 6374 single drive. Total weight of the board is around 10 kilos, and range was quite a lot, for a commuter board. 

![20181215_183717|690x388](upload://3LEQt328gTR3OQzy3oYYiY28Gd3.jpeg) 

This board is too heavy to carry around when i'm in a mall or in places where i have to carry it and walk. So hence, its time to build a lightweight Kushboard :star_struck:

The goal is to have a low powered board with a weight of maybe 4~6 kilos. I went with a 7s2p 30Q battery, so it's pretty tiny.

![20181124_221457|281x500](upload://vvGckjvzEgGLJcb8t3bGVV3PoT4.jpeg) 

For this build, i went with @nuttyjeff's Avio gear drive, and it involves cutting the hangar for it to fit the gear drive. ![20181205_185134|690x388](upload://kkNtmqTWtnQh6MdVf9FLJXlLLms.jpeg) ![20181205_190651|690x388](upload://eRFw9weHD1WYihJnxcs1pimsJE4.jpeg) ![20181205_212822|690x388](upload://l2R7LKjt0H1G83F7HO5YcoFtcDc.jpeg) 

Went to Jeff's place to set it up![20181224_202422|690x388](upload://v51fBbn4P2lLtBS7Xcai4BnYtDZ.jpeg)
I put way more grease when i was home.![20181224_205837|690x388](upload://2WtZeTSwzJi0bEjlIgdZst80Jj1.jpeg) 
![20181224_211148|690x388](upload://9SGRNcY7a60HMUHJ6yD2lNgtwb.jpeg) Set up with 97mm Abec Reflys. This was the smallest wheel size to use with this gear drive.![20181224_212058|690x388](upload://vc8gFl3s1buOHnd2Ge1qTOSheKn.jpeg)

Installed it to a 121c Orbiter Carbon fiber deck. Honestly i laughed a bit after installing both trucks because it looks so goofy haha![20181224_214005|690x388](upload://6wtCoae1OOEbVEQLxNQdMjoQG5c.jpeg) ![20181224_213904|690x388](upload://dKqRS9oICiOYsnynphZ7WKdktB2.jpeg)

Here's the insides, 7s2p 30Q battery, Flipsky 4.12 ESC, Lunacycle Antispark switch. Surprisingly with everything except the enclosure, it weighs right smack at 5 kilos. I figured it'll be 6 kilos from the 97mm abecs. ![20181224_230515|690x388](upload://bVVZAmH5c93AYrQ0g7Eh0Lc7DLP.jpeg) 

I'm not a tall dude, so something like this is nice for me. ![20181224_225509|690x388](upload://vlRax8xKQZwn8cUPfy3M6jYQ7zV.jpeg) 

Tiny! Not as small as a Penny. It's 25" in length.
![20181225_175127|281x500](upload://id0Vh0TNNfGtUoVKGBdiZlICeKN.jpeg) ![20181225_010144|281x500](upload://sebq25GevT3CiIlmV0idvZNL8k7.jpeg) 

Now comes a problem.. The battery is a bit too wide for the deck, and i did not want to go for a double stack. There's only about 10mm of space if the battery is in the middle, so the enclosure can't have a flange coming at the sides.![20181225_224847|690x388](upload://oV2m055QFqdzYYg6hFLrBS72Eci.jpeg) 

Thinking of an enclosure design. 
![20181226_094254|690x388](upload://aP6CCaq6jd0jTt5XUJeuzHmrlUw.jpeg) 

@nuttyjeff came through and helped me design an enclosure so that it fully utilizes the full width of the deck's space. Here's some CAD porn.
 ![2|467x500](upload://fUbY3jAIJTJFB1c3iq6KHUbONU3.jpeg) ![5|305x500](upload://gNc7uvCnBqzAVOrJDPqZIwpmngI.jpeg)

The enclosure will be sent in to be printed in Nylon. I was planning to have it printed in a cheaper filament and then mold it in fiberglass but just this time, i figured outsourcing it to get printed would be the better option.

Meanwhile, i had the bottom and sides glossed up.

One issue is that the side edges of the enclosure protrude out by about 2mm from the deck, so might have to heat form it a bit if its possible. If not i'll have to bust out the fiberglass body filler again haha

The middle will flex up a bit if i stand really near the edge of the kicktail. The flex is really minimal, so i think the enclosure will stiffen it up a bit.

Just right, enough space for a 4.12 ESC, 14 cells and an antispark.
![20190127_133121|690x388](upload://yjsDdAxClazzKd1R3Pa6k3m6G0T.jpeg) And of course i'll spray truck bed liner over this enclosure![20190127_212945|690x388](upload://t8GdoT8xhEGZFnQkk8N3KV5ZCrz.jpeg)

I'm seriously considering selling my Unity and 2x 170kv Maytechs 6374's to fund a near copy of this build... As much as I'd like to have my beast of a fuckin board, money is stupid tight for me and I am a pretty small dude in the first place...

Questions:

It looks like you could get a little bit more room out of the enclosure towards the rear trucks if you didn't mind that area being gasket sealed (to make things easy)

How much differently do you think the board would perform if using the Maytech 6374 170kv instead of the 6355? Like, obviously I get the jist of things, but I still don't have personal riding experience

If using the 6374, maybe using 30T batteries instead of 30q would be a better idea? Though, at the same time... This would definitely be a board I'd take when flying - as much as I hate the idea for esk8 purposes, maybe LiPo's might be a good idea?

A single 6355 on a small battery like this is ok for me. Not super strong, but it'll lug an average person up some hills I assume. A single 6374 on 30T will definitely be a lot better. I suggest a 6374 if you are not worried about weight.  I have not done a proper ride on this yet as I have the threads to cut and add gaskets and grip tape. I'll update the thread soon when it's done!

That seems like a lot of money for an enclosure, though I'm sure it'll last forever. 

Assuming one has access to the equipment, wouldn't making one out of aluminum sheet on a sheet bend be near as good? I know alum is about 2-3x heavier than most plastics, but the entire enclosure doesn't weigh too much to begin with

Honestly one could get away with using the smallest enclosure from eskating.eu but due to unplanned circumstances my battery pack layout was too wide for the deck. So getting an enclosure that fits everything, as well as fit in the area of the deck without protrusion was tricky, so i had to get Jeff to help model and then send it out to print.

Definitely inspiring me to make another small build. I’d either go with this deck or the hunnit from Hi5ber. I just know the dips on the bottom of the Hi5ber decks can be a bitch to match enclosures to. The rover that @nuttyjeff posted a pic of a while back is beautiful, but I don’t know how a wheelbase that short will suit me.  I usually ride around on the same wheelbase as the orbiter.

Anyways beautiful little board man. We need more little builds on this forum.

Overall, this is a cute little board to ride to work because i work nearby my place, and or to the mall to run errands etc because its light and small sized. Wished i could have gone 90mm with Popocas but the Avio gear drive could only accommodate 97mm wheels and above. That being said, clearance is not the best on 97mms. So only smooth roads are ok on this board. Any pebbly areas or construction sites is a no go.

Now for a range test and see what a 7s2p can do. Probably low powered, but i hope to get 20km range maybe?

What kind of clearance issues do you mean would have been better with 90s, wheelbite? Also, how wide is the deck in the middle where it’s smaller? I was thinking of trying an enclosure that’s 146mm wide and 312mm long.

Wow this exceeded my expectations. I was hoping to get at least 20km or so, but i was able to complete my usual skate route and went 22km, with a bit of juice to spare.

I weigh 70kg, and am going an average of 25km/h and occasional 30kms. Terrain was relatively smooth and a few small inclines. This was taken a couple mins after i finished. 
![20190310_135243|690x388](upload://8mkXAK2oRDu8NYLEfEwl7GVZC8m.jpeg) 

Turning is so easy because i have 85 and 80A bushings, and wedge/dewedged the board. Love it! One thing i have to be careful of is not to lean my weight to the back too much, it'll cause the front to lift.![20190310_134739|690x388](upload://2EKW1PuPHqPHD5M0sjh0oHpSAfE.jpeg)

I'm about to purchase this deck... Before I do, can I know how this worked out for you? I have CaliberII's but going for standard belt drive. How tall are you, for comfort reasons?

Additionally, How did you gloss up the bottom / sides? It looks amazing!

I’m also on the hinge of purchasing this deck. Looks like the coupe by @psychotiller will for nicely. Looks like if I build the battery to fit the enclosure it’ll take a 10s2p with a single motor. 

Had you had enough space for a lip on the enclosure, would you have just come down from the top with the mounting screws? Seems like this would be a little more secure since the deck is so thin you had to trim the inserts.

If Hi5ber would ever return my emails I’d be trying this setup out with the Hunnit.

I love it. Its 25 inches lengthwise so its not a very wide stance deck. I find myself standing right above the front truck and at the kicktail for max stability. If i lean back too much and my weight is on my rear foot, the board might do a wheelie and may or may not make you fall

I think the Coupe enclosure might not fit. Its a bit too long for this deck. The wheelbase is a bit short. I dont have the numbers but the 121cboards website should have it. Ill see if i can take some measurements of the deck tonight. Its about 200mm wide in the middle area so having an enclosure with a lip smaller than that is tricky, thats why i got Jeff to model a perfect one instead

According to their site the orbiter wheelbase is 15”. I emailed them and they said the center of the bottom of the deck where it’s shorter is 6.75” wide. 
The outer dimensions of the coupe are 12.5” by 6”.

You would know more than me if this won’t fit though. I’m just going by the numbers.

Yep it's a double stack, but it needs to be staggered than have the cells directly above each other

Before you order anything, ill check with @nuttyjeff because he has a friend's board with the coupe enclosure and hopefully one orbiter deck lying around.

Nice build!!! Looks really cool.

What is the final weight of your board?

When i weighed it last time, it was without the enclosure, at 5kg. With the enclosure i think its an additional 100g maybe? Ill weigh it again tonight

7s2p gives me 22km with a bit left on a single 6355. So for a commuter i'd say a single drive is good enough.

true... 

7s is a bit less for me. 10S is the minimum for me. Maybe its worth a try with 12S2P...

Just do 7s w/30T's. Will probably have to slightly modify depth of enclosure
