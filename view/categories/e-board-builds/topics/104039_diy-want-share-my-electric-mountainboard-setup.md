Hi guys.
Want to share my setup with you.
I bought a second hand mountainboard (Nexton) and build transmission and electronics. Platform for engines was made from several plywood layers. And I like this material. You don't need any special instruments and it easy to handle. For transmission I've used a bicycle chain and bicycle asterisks (the biggest one). The smallest asterisks I've made my self. It's not to hard, but needs to know a formula.  All electronics were placed in the plywood box. It easily can be disconnected from mountainboard and it's comfortable.

    Summary:
    ESC: HobbyKing® ™ X-Car Beast Series ESC 1:8 Scale 150A
    Motors: Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-192KV Brushless Outrunner 
    Battery: 4P3S x 4 (Liitokala 18650 2500mah 20A)
    Gear ratio 38 : 8
    Maximum speed I've rich 35 km/h

I satisfied by ESC, it allows to configure break and acceleration. I like motors, they are very powerful. 
There is only one thing I don't like - it's chain transmission. It has a set of disadvantages - very noisy (you can hear it in the video, I leave a sound). The biggest asterisks (on the wheels) some times cache stones. So I want to change on belt.
