Hello,

I'm about to start ordering the parts for my first build and was wondering if I could get a compatibility check to make sure that everything is going to work together.

Will I need to buy some extra connectors or will I be good with what the vendors send and it'll be pretty much and play?

You would need something for either a loop key or a switch. Are you using 1 or 2 motors.

I'm not really a speed demon so something around or less than 20 mph will be fine with me but I do commute back and forth from school a lot so I'm looking for a lot of range, maybe 10-15 miles would be good?

calc.esk8.today

You can use this to get a rough speed and range at roughly 18wh per mile.  So you just plug everything in and it gives you a pretty good idea of what your setup will do.  I use 83percent for motor efficiency. But according to your setup on 15/36 gearing would be 22mph and 10 miles.

Ohh ok. If that's the case, then I'll probably just get a bigger battery then. Maybe something like a 10s4p

That's a common/decent battery choice.  More continuous power,range, and less voltage sag

I'll go with that then. Thank you for the help!

Depends on the wiring. Check your VESC if it connects to your battery. Check motor wires connect to the VESC. That's about it. If they don't match you'll need to solder an adapter or change out connectors.

Will the vendors state what kind of connectors they are using on their product page?
