I have wanted to do this for years but finally with all that I learned on here I finally managed it. In fact we have two on the go. Single motor, vesc control hand laminated board in our own press. Just had our first test drive in the dark. One piece of advice that I missed was hc-06 is no good with iPhone apps. Got 2 spare now.![image|666x500](upload://aGuJt4V8bT703Tshgvcdi4mRLKp.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://paOPACb2rETAZu4pb42tzXDZKMs.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://c1UPPbBcZoMbHvyInZiUevg8eg9.jpeg)

You got any pictures of your build process? Congrats on getting it running!

Any plans for a second build?

You're in Dorset?  Word of advice if you see a silly man with a ridiculous beard on a hummie build with bergmeisters on it going as fast as he can at slow walking pace run because thats @brenternet and meeting him in here is bad enough.

Not really we might be on the second as it is the same build really. The fun bit was laminating the board. I looked at off the shelf designs but I wanted something that looked like a skateboard not a vision in carbon fibre. Just not my style.

Good to see you get the board together. I will give you a shout when I get over your way one day. @brenternet is in your town so if you need any wheels he is your man. I think he has picked up every variation of wheel available..

I have a lot of wheels it's true. I am also a full bore adult with a mortgage and children so please ignore these gentlemen and thier inflammatory comments.

I've actually seen a bunch of guys on the prom on  meepos and one chap on an evolve but I've never spoken to them because obviously we are the elite diy lords. 

There's a guy in Salisbury building his board @GingerSteve - he's proper ginger though, why can't people be normal?

on that remote you can unscrew the 'wheel' on it for less bulk considering you won't be using it.

Lol every time I see a electric board I meet them to see if I can find someone to ride with. Every time I realize it’s pointless. If they can’t easily go 25 MPH continuously for at least 10 miles then I honestly just don’t wanna ride with you...

Congratulations! Nice that you pressed your own deck, is it birch?

I wish we had time to tuck and roll when something goes wrong at high speed, happens so fast that we might get half an expletive out before we are reunited with our beloved asphalt.

Yep 1.2mm birch ply. Both boards have different thickness as still trying to work out that. Curve red in both directions and all done with bolts, wood and pva glue. Vacuum press would be nice I guess but you can spend more time learning new tools rather than get on with it.![image|666x500](upload://u73VfgVS3B7iqq20GQRcchcb20u.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://2J76D4f2eR4KfS54jL2fS9ZUipM.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://vPz4myrpFUGw68G6zrcsGguACyF.jpeg)

Nice, I like birch pintails. I would stay away from a vacuum press if you plan on doing anything with aggressive curves. They may work better at sea level but I can only use mine for epoxy and cloth laminates at 4500 ft.

Did the first 3 miles shake down. So what went down? Not me but some issues. The motor mount wanted to come loose easily solves with some thread lock. The bigger problem was an intermitted drive problem. Close investigation showed the phase wire connections(bananas)  coming loose and shorting together. I am now making some longer leads to introduce some slack. Great more soldering.

Cools stuff.  Tip.  Once you have the connections where you want them then shrink tube the whole connection together.  Stops them coming loose and they do come loose.

So full shake down complete.
1. Good advice wheel taken off remote.
2. Has already shrink sleeved the joints but the leads are too short.
3 extended leads.
4. Cleaned up sharp solder joints that bit through sleeve.
5. Moved enclosure as leads longer.
6. Soldered up correct BT module.
7 got xmatic working- brilliant.
8. Realised that my parallel and series had got the better of me on my design and that explained why the battery gauge was incorrect.
9. Lock tite on all screws bolts etc.
10 buy helmet.

Problems left to fix.
1. The motor mount( hobby king ) still comes loose and then the belt rubs the wheel?
2. What board to build next and where to store them.
3. Get more comfortable shoes vanns and vibration hurt my feet.

1.  What were you thinking?  What trucks?  @dickyho will fix you up or @Boardnamics for cheap.

2.  Get a storage shed you will need it or a very understanding wife like Brents.  Shes rare though, she has special needs training.

3.    Gazelles 4 life.  At a push  converse 1 stars.

Got caliber trucks so open to suggestions. The storage is in hand as my wife would like the dinning room table back. Who would have thought that soldering irons get so hot! The Twizy in the garage is going to be sharing the space.
As regards to understanding wife she knew I was special. Honeymoon california, me with tears of joy at Disney and then a long long drive to above san Fransisco to look at batteries and solar panels. Not the romantic trip she imagined.

Paper template, then go at it with a fine jigsaw. Take your time the crapper this stage the more sanding which is actually the worse bit I feel as you can never find the best angle of the dangle that stops the ply from tearing.
