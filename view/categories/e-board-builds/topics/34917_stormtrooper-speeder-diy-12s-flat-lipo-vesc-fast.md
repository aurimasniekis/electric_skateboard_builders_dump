Here's my first build I've been working on for a few months now. I've gone through so many changes already and I'm closing in the the final product. Set up is as follows.  
12s "flattened" lipos. (2 6s 8000mah Multistars) PAIN IN MY F@*#%NG A$$. But pulled it off. ðŸ˜Ž
TB VESC. 
TB single motor mech kit. 
16:36 gears. 
SK3 6364 190kv 
90mm wheels. 
Bones Reds. 
Skateshred Bamboo 40" deck. 
TB nano transmitter. 

I've hit 36mph on the mockup with this setup already and she had more to give. Had to back out of throttle because I value my life and and speed wobbles were brutal lol. Upgrades in the future will probably be; 

218mm TB trucks. 
TB 6374 motor. 
BETTER VESC IF I CAN FIND ONE WORTH BUYING. $100-$150 budget. Still reading and hunting for the best bet. 
Maybe dual one day. Just hesitant as components aren't cheap. More shit to break etc. 
Also still hunting for a better deck. I LOVE the Hi5ber Raptor but I hear horror stories with CF decks. So a little hesitant there as well. Another option is the Jet Killshot. Same kinda aesthetics as the Raptor. Similar body lines. Maple ply. Should be okay. Anyways I'm super stoked to finish her up! Lastly will be thermo molding a 12"x24" piece of kydex for the enclosure. That should be fun. Specs I'm looking at will be 18"x7"X1.5". I'll be shaping a wood male form and pressing the kydex on with some foam then finish up the hard corners with a block and a heat gun. Should be fairly straight forward. Also mounting with some threaded inserts and screws. Can't wait! Should be super low pro. Any feedback/suggestions are welcome! <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/6/264ae69aaecbac6a65a4fa04f4bf84a02ea2f12e.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/c/8cc6d54690930c61ececf74e14ff2ecf9866fd84.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/d/9d7e4c18d290a01734b566d0e99e900b95f8ebbe.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/6/66feee0a3f19121ef5a9bcbc77d497905c349c81.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/2/a2d7a1729ceff0c7d75cec2d0e1194d1516dafcf.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Haha i like the last pic :D
I used a planter tray for starters, maybe you can find something for your size until you get your kydex going.

I too soldered up some lipo cells, how did you do it in the end? I tried to cut the spot welded tabs without shorting out too much and then used aluminum based solder to prepare them and regular solder for the wires. Works ok i guess, hope it holds up long term :joy:
And it was a pain in the ass, did it outside on conrete so nothing would burn down :D

Also i think that you dont necessarily have to upgrade to a TB Motor unless something is shady with the SK3, you probably wont feel that much of a difference. As a second motor however its ok to go for 6374.

Thanks man!! Well on the multi stars every other tab was soldered. So simply de soldered those and had to cut the ones that were spot welded. Was left with VERY minimal working room but the flux paste I got worked like a charm and a precision soldering tip def helped! Used 18gauge jumpers between the cells and to extend the balance leads and 10g for the power wires. Worked out awesome and got some super strong, clean solder joints. Lots of practice as I work on all my own electric guitars as well lol. 

I was kinda thinking the same thing about the Tb motor. My only thing is, I'd feel better running the 6374 I'd have more torque on paper. But I agree that I'd probably not feel the difference. Another plus is that the sk3 advertises 10s max? I'm running 12s and I've had no problems though. Nothing evident. No overheating. The TB advertises handling up to 12s. So I suppose it's just some piece at mind.

Getting the kydex going tonight. This will be something new and I hope it goes all as planned. 
Also another reason for the TB motor is id eventually be able to run dual 6374. Also kinda pointless but I love their black motor cans. Super clean looking. Lol

Here's that top speed test. I did the test with the batteries strapped to the top of the deck with electric tape, my electrical, and mechanical setup on an MBS mtb, mtb trucks and my 90mm wheels. I had a friend weld the truck hanger all the way around to build up a bead then I grinded 3 flats so the tb clamp could mount. Super wide mean lookin stance but SO GODAMN shaky and sketchy hahaha not the smartest test I've performed. Moved everything back over to the bamboo deck and tb 180mm trucks. Can't wait to get riding again.

Well, since a motor is basically just a bunch of wires and magnets, it doen't really care about voltage too much. It's the current that generates the heat, and since you can limit that easily on the VESC you should be ok. There's really nothing one could to to make a motor handle higher voltages better than another, provided you don't overshoot on the amps. And as long you can stil touch it with bare hands for a few seconds everything is good.

As for torque, i myself would choose a lower kv motor since i don't want myself to get killed at your speeds but in the end it's up to you. No shame in running a 6364 and 6374 together in Dual Drive.

I also thought about Kydex in the beginning but since my board is budget oriented i left it out for now. I'd rather save money for a MTB :D
But nonetheless, Kydex seems so be pretty logical for those applications, i think it will get you a nice box.
