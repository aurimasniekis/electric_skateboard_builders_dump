I'm guessing it's probably recommended to use spring trucks on an all terrain build, but does it make a huge difference if i don't?

Thanks,
Cal

It's probably not required. But if you're building an all terrain board, you're most likely gonna use pneumatic wheels, and most pneumatic wheels use 12mm bearings so you'll need 12mm trucks and most 12mm trucks are spring trucks.

Ive got quite flexy mountainboard and im around 90kg / 190lbs. With skate trucks steering is quite stiff i would say. I have black dampas/rubber, trucks are made by scrub. Board is also scrub silver reef series 2. Lenght around 1.08m

Have not tried to adjust them yet. Though when accelerating if you are not careful you may catch a little wobble (got single drive, perhaps one wheel acceleration influences this). 

A friend of mine with mountainboars said that spring trucks reduces wobble risk at higher speeds.

I would also like to build a all terrain board and want to use it 50% onroad / 50% offroad. So I also would be interested in what advantages the springs have compared to a standard caliber or Paris truck. And if they are better in all terrain would they also be stable on the road at higher speeds.

If you use pneumatic wheels your Calibers will simply not  be wide enough. Another effect is the shape of the deck. A Mountainbaord has an angled nose section. This will bring down your foot into the pivot point of the truck. So its not alone the truck that is more stable, it's the entire geometry of the board effecting stability. Offroad boards are made the way they are because it's a complete different environment you ride in and things have to differ from standard longboard setups to cope with that fact. There is always a reason... For the use in both environments, we made the URBAN Carver.
We love to ride ride it in the Urban environment since most towns have shit pavement, cobble stones, potholes etc. 
No more problems with that any more . Just make sure you inflate the tires to 60+PSI.

Wow they look awesome. Definately would love to try one of these out! Too bad trampa is not where I live. As I would really love to seehow do these things turn ir real life.. for city use this is a must, i think.. as there are a lot of.sharp turms where I live and  general 90 degree turn is hard to do if the.distance is narrow in which you can start to turn your board! Would love to ride along with cars - no problems on such wide space of road..

This is how tight turns can be. The Trampa Carbeboards are called carve boards because they carve.

That's Jenso on an early proto he made last year. 
The Urban Carver turns nearly as extreme. You could still put the springs in outer position to get less steering.

Wow, thanks for the video! That's a really tight radius, in which this board can turn around !

I think if not for the few coming boards, then this is a must (carver type board) for some time in the future of ideal city use board..

  If it could only be possible to make others boards so ''turny'' while at the same time being able to maintain them stiff at higher velocity

With a little planning, you don't need to use channel trucks for an all terrain build. The only real reason to use channel trucks is if the trucks are going to be mounted on the angled nose and tail of a mountainboard deck. Width and wheelbite isn't even a concern with the options of Surfrodz trucks or 273mm RKP trucks.

I disagree on that. You can't say this is right or that is right. It really depends on the environment and what kind of board feeling you prefer. The spring trucks, mounted on an angled tip, have different characteristics all together. Foot sole near pivot point of truck, flex in the deck etc.
You may also want your battery to sit in a safe position when going off road. Hard impacts do happen! It all depends on personal preferences and the environment. 
Going off road you may also want bindings.
Anyway, the Urban Carver is a nice cross over board. This is not a pro con statement.

Could u make a comparison of how different decks (incl trucks) react? I assume.this might aid future board buyers, too!

For now it seems that spring trucks can be easier adjusted compared to skate trucks where u have to buy and replace the dampas/bushings.

The O.P. asked this question:
"Are spring trucks required for an all terrain build?"

It's also the title of the thread.  Wasn't offering a pro or con response or shooting from the hip. The answer is clearly no.

I was mountainboarding 16 years ago.

Can you make a mountainboard out of ''carver'' type board?

What would be the problems associated with using larger wheels?

Here, take a look at this video, the board has even a mechanism on how to make the wheel not stand out as far.. board is also veery bendy..

BTW can anyone comment on what makers a ''carver board'' a carver.. and how much is it different from the spring truck board ?

So far.. it seems that the ''tilt'' angle is just way larger.. Im not entirely sure can you measure it.. and is it documented anywhere.. also does it work with all decks or not?

---

EDIT:

Found very informative page about carvers:

http://www.carverskateboards.com/history-of-carver/

Though still reading and a simple to read comparison about carver trucks vs spring trucks would be great (other than the great turning radius of the carvers)

I read all of that ''carver skateboards'' story.. Also watched the video.. the amount of work involved in developing the carver trucks is just tremendious! ...

Now I need a skate shop with at least 3 different carver type boards.. the possibilities and options are almost endless there! Though - what are the final production models as of right now - im not sure, still have to find out that!

@BoardSportRN Im not sure why your posts are hidden so much.. even when they are not about evolve! But non the less.. Im thinking now more and more about how to make turny board.. I know that trampa has some good results with their urban carvers.. but unless I start an official production for selling them, im not sure can I easly go into trampa decks now.. I might soon get a ''noSno'' board and see what it is capable of, for off-road use!

Though, im still not sure where to fit my small 6'' pneumatic wheels (and how to do that).. so building of somewhat carving board is probably out of question for another 2 boards.. after that I could tackle this thing once more..

**Though, I can mention here the @DynamicLabs unique steering.. and I hope that one day something similar can be implemented for emtbs!**

Especially good one / interesting one is this type of steering:

These are called ''Lean'' boards.. you can search about them on the internet or see the topic I made here, on the forum:

For my lightweight raceboard I used MBS ATS12 skate trucks to save a few grams.

The ride feeling is very nice and they can be adjusted from very loose and carvy all the way to very stiff. The only downside is, that I cracked a baseplate / top truck after some hard jumping. 

So if you are just riding, you can definitely go with skate trucks. If you want a more robust board for stunts and jumping, you should go for channel trucks

You can see them in action i this video:

@Duffman Great video! How much speed do you think is needed to ''fly over'' / jump while riding over these little hills / bumps?

I estimate that you got close to 30kph and still didnt do a jump on these.. I see that you are slowing down on some.. buti im wondering what speed it takes to lift off the ground while riding over these..

I know that if the ''decline'' were sharper and not ''round'' you would get a jump anyways.. 

--

Sounds like these skate axles are not that great for heavy jumps.. I wonder how real mountainboard riders dont break every day.. if they are making jumps with them.. (or all of them probably use spring trucks then?)

Depends... 

If you jump more actively by pulling the board up, you don't need much speed. Between 20 and 30km/h you can control if you lift the board or not, by pressing or pulling the board. Beyond 30km/h you just start flying...

Under those race conditions you have to try to stay on the ground to be quick. Every jump forces you to rebalance after landing which cost precious 1/10th of a second. So you have to find the right speed and push down after every bump to drive the fastest lap times.


I CNCed some beefier top trucks for my broken ones, so let's see what will break next... :wink:
