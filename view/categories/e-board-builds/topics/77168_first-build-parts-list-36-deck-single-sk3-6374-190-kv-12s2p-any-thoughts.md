Hey Everyone, this is my first build parts list. I've been doing alot of research for the past few weeks so this is what I have come up with. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. 

Deck: 36" x 9.5" Downhill Deck - $44
Trucks: Caliber 2 Trucks 50°/Bearings - $50
Wheels: Flywheel Clones 90/83 - $27
Motor: Turnigy Aerodrive SK3-6374-192kv motor - $86
Motor Mount: Turnigy Motor Mount - $10
Pulley System: Complete 16T motor/36T wheel pulley - $40
VESC: Torque VESC BLDC - $102
Battery: 12s2p 18650 Battery 30Q - $330
Remote: Nano 2.4 Ghz Remote -$60

Total Cost: ~$754

I'm still not sure whether I should use the 83 or 90 flywheels.

Personally id go 90mm. And try and get real abecs but clones are okay if you really need to save the $60 difference.

Get mounts from @Boardnamics. Much better quality but for a very reasonable price

Maybe you can go for the Flipsky 4.12 vesc, I don't know if it is better then the torqueboards one but I have heard some stories about it, correct me if im wrong
the flipsky one can be picked up on ebay or aliexpress for around 45$

Yes and the con of Flipsky is that the company only excists for a short time and tb is already longer on the market

Just get the reputable TB vesc. Anything happens, you can always contact Dexter.
And go with @Boardnamics mount.
You can save 40 bucks by getting mini remote
