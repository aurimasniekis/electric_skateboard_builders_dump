Hi, I am a 16-year-old boy who wants to build his first electric longboard. I want to have a setup with one motor, but want two add a second one in the future. I would like to start out with a smaller motor, that makes it possible for me two not bye too new motors, but bye a second one like the first one. Which I could add. It would help a lot if anyone could help me with a parts list of what I would need. I have got about 575 dollars.

Hi, 

maybe you want to go through this thread i posted below,
make a list on your own and tell us what u got.

Then we can see if it could work.

Look through the builds category, you will find tons of info and parts lists.

yeah, that's a pretty good motor.  The KV being too high or low is also dependent on the voltage you're gonna be running, so keep that in mind.  In general, kv * number of cells * 4.2 * 7 should be less than 60,000, any higher and you risk frying your VESC

 My total budget is 575$. So I think about 90 $.  Should I spend more or is this a good price point.

If you have 575$, you should have enough to buy 2new motors, one new vesc and a new mounts and stuff

With that budget you should build single drive with bigger motor. Goog duals go up to 1000 dollars.

Ok so this is pretty much my upcoming build. So what you want for that budget is 2x 260ish kv 6355 motors or 5055 or any you want pretty much around that kv. Then you can get two Xcar Beast 120amp Esc for about $100. With that setup you can go with a 6s lipo and and hobby charger or small discharge only bms. The rest you can get from eBay like trucks, wheels, pulleys or chains and a deck you like. That is pretty much it. You can make your own mounts if you have the tools or buy some off someone here. The rest of the stuff is pretty small like connectors and stuff which you can find out yourself from reading on the forum

he does not have the budget for a dual at all!!!! (unless using one of those cheapo ebay escs).  1 6374 motor is within his budget but not much more

6374 is the shit forreal

He does so have enough for a dual build. My build is going to cost around $400 with dual motors and yes it will have the eBay esc but that is just to test and for an extra $100 I could use two reliable Xcar escs

 I am not sure what voltage I will be running,  but does anyone have any recommendations for a small and cheap cruising deck that could work.  I have a locker at school which I hoped it could fit in.  It is a regular size locker with two lockers on top of each other.

Hahaha thanks

 What would you guys recommend I only weigh 60 kg but I live in a  really hilly area 
 It would be best if it was from Hobby King

Ideal motor kv depends on wheel diameter and battery voltage. We need to know those before we can give a recommendation. A 6374 size motor should be a good size for you.

 I think of building my own battery so I am not sure what what voltage I will be running but I will probably run 83mm wheels
what are common voltages for batteries and what's the difference ?

## \#30 Posted by: MysticalDork Posted at: 2017-11-10T18:18:56.010Z Reads: 107

```
Common esk8 batteries are 6s (22.2v), 8s (29.6v), 10s (37v), and 12s (44.4v). Higher voltages allow more power, and require lower KV motors.
```

```
With electric circuits, power is volts times amps. Assuming your amps stay the same, higher voltage gives more power. 

If your power stays the same, more volts means less amps, which means you can use thinner wire, and generates less heat.

Hi, it has been a while, but I have bought this kit.
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-skateboard-conversation-kit-v2.html

I just wounderd what battery I shooed use and what charger.

I have also have this motor,

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-245kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html
 but this motor does not have the small cutout in the axel so I can not use the little bit to securely fasten the motor to the gear. Does anyone have any good ideas.

I also wonder if you can combined 2 battery's and charge as one, and if there is any way to charge lipos without taking the battery's out of the enclosure.

And what enclosure shooed I get, I wonder if I could buy a kydex sheet and form it.
If i do this how do I fasten the enclosure to the board in a nice way.

Sorry for spelling

But thanks for all of the amazing support. :-)

The Sk3 motor does not have a keyway, but the motor that comes with the Hobby King kit does have one. Have you received the kit? Or use green loctite on the Sk3 motor shaft. 

Try forming kydex, there's good info here and on youtube. Or look to psychotiller for a variety of sizes. It will depend on the battery you choose.

Hi guise. I have searched for a battery, and I found this.
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-battery-5000mah-5s-20c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html
 I think of buying 2. Will this work with this motor
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-245kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html
And this Kit(VESC)
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-skateboard-conversation-kit-v2.html

I also think of buying this charger. will it work? But it sess Power supply not included. What power supply do I need.
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/imax-b6-50w-5a-charger-discharger-1-6-cells-genuine.html

And this parallel board to charge booth battery's at the same time. Will this work?
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbyking-parallel-charging-board-for-6-packs-2-6s-xt60-ec5-t-connector.html

Will this all work.


Thanks for the help. :slight_smile:

1. You'll need two batteries to get a 10s because a 5s is to small to run an esk8
2. If you get those motors you'll need to set an erpm limit to 60k or you could burn your vesc
3. the conversion kit only incudes 1 vesc and only 1 pully (you need two for dual)
4. Idk about your charger because your battery will be a 10s, so it'll  only charge one battery at a time. I also don't know how that parallel charging board works. So I would ask someone about your charging setup.

I wouldnâ€™t be super sure a 10s would work though with a 125kv motor in the kit.

That's wrong, it will work. It's made for 10s.

I think of only using the motor not the 125 kv included in the kit.
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-245kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html
So is 2 of this battery's ok
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-battery-5000mah-5s-20c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html
And I do not understand the Erpm Thing. What does it stand for? Why limit to 60k? And do i program the VESC on my computer in some sort of VESC program.

I really struggle to fiend thinks do i just searched in the search bar or do I search on google.
