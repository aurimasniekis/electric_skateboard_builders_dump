This is my second build and hopefully it's going to be everything I wanted my first build to be! I've got a couple of weeks of work soon so hopefully all parts will have arrived and I'll be busy putting it all together.

**The goals for this board is:**

* Reliable.
* Stealthy-ish.
* Good range.
* Reasonbly easy to lug around university.
* Looking goooood!

I've read every thread here featuring "Boosted Clones" at least twice, so I think I've got a good grasp on what it takes to build a good one. But I'd love to get some input as well!

A lot of the parts are still en route, including the VESCs, hubmotores, trucks and wheels from diyelectricskateboards. The package have been stuck in Denmark for 10 days now, hoping DIYs support will help me get it moving soon.

**Partslist:**

* Loaded Vanguard flex 3.
* [DIY electrics dual hubmotor 75KV.](diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/electric-skateboard-hub-motor-dual/) 
* 2x DIY electrics VESCs. - With upgraded capacitors due to the extra length for wires. Design inspired by @jackw's build. 
* [Enclosures bought from](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/loaded-vanguard-and-never-summer-reaper-enclosures-for-sale/17137) @Eboosted - The quality is amazing!
* Nunchuck 2.4ghz and reciever bought from @rpn314 - Super stealthy!
* Risers designed by @jackw - They're gorgeous!
* Anti spark switch from ProtoBoards - Can't get it to work, not sure if broken. Does anyone know where the transistor goes?
* 5.5mm plugs, 12AWG cable, copper braided strands.
* 40x Samsung 25R that will be spotwelded to 10S4P.
* A cheap chinese 10S BMS that will be bypassed for charging.

**To be considered:** 

* FOC or not? Very tempted to try it out and stick with it.
* CAN bus or Y-config
* %-monitor for battery or not?
* Sanding the fish art on the board or leave it be? Leaning towards sanding.

I added some lining to keep the dust out. It gives a very good seal, might even be splash proof!

**Update #1**

Glued together the 18650's in pairs of 4 and made a mock up of how they'll fit in the enclosure. It's a tight fit but should be perfect!

Both the Nunchuck + receiver, some Loctite 243 & 270 and my spotwelder, that I had lent to a user here, came in the mail today! My order from Torqueboards should be here tomorrow, hopefully. 

The Loctite 243 will be used for smaller things, like the antenna on the receiver, and the 270(heat resistant) for the hub motors themselves.


Also, thank you @rpn314 for the screwdriver that goes with the nunchuck!

**Update #2** 

The chinese BMS and adaptors for the sensors on the hub drive came today. I missed the part in the description of the adapters where it said "10x" so intead of getting 2 in the mail, I got 20 of them. Oh well :smirk:

No joy on the package from diyelectrics. Should have been here yesterday but hopefully it'll get here before the weekend. At least I know it's in Sweden now!

I still need to read up on how to wire this BMS though. It looks pretty different from my 6S BMS which had P+, P-, B+ and B-.

It was all good till I saw that BMS....lol
Save your cells, your ESC and your limbs and just toss that BMS and get something reliable, or no BMS and just fuses and proper current limit on ESC 
If you're bypassing charging already all the BMS is doing is acting like a fuse.

How so? I'm bypassing FOR charging, so the BMS will not act as a fuse! It's just for charging. 

I'll make sure it works properly before "permanently" attaching it to the pack to make sure it's not a dud.

## \#16 Posted by: scepterr Posted at: 2017-08-18T09:24:45.490Z Reads: 618

```
Bypass for charging means you are not using BMS but plugging batteries directly into charger, correct?
And ESC is connected to output/discharge of BMS?
 If thats the case then the BMS will just act as a fuse on the output/discharge, meaning the only function it will perform is current limiting.

## \#17 Posted by: UniqueSnowflakeN27 Posted at: 2017-08-18T09:30:17.486Z Reads: 624

```
No, it means that the battery is connected to the BMS with positive, negative and all the balancing leads. But the discharge (positive and negative) is also hooked up directly to the VESC.

So the BMS tries to stop the current as soon as I hit the limit, but since the leads also goes to the VESC nothing happens. But you can still balance charge it :slight_smile:

What I'm doing is called "bypassing BMS for charging". You bypass the amp limit so the BMS is only for charging. If you search around om this forum you'll ser that's what people call it :slight_smile:

**Update #3**
 
Today was not a very eventful day :confused: I thought the hubs would get here but they're still stuck in transit...
 Got 2 grip tapes today at least, one "normal" and one "rough"! 

I'm going to attempt to make it two-tone(normal 2/3 and 1/3 rough of the way) like Boosted boards.

 Drilled some "holes" for the copper braid and took the bushings from the trucks that came with the board since the stock ones from DIY apparently sucks. So they'll get switched ASAP! 

I removed the grip tape but left the glas fiber since it was pretty hard to remove and I didn't want to risk destroying the deck with my orbital sander. So to make sure the glas fiber stays in place I gave it 3-4 coats of clear coating. This will get roughed up with sandpaper before applying the grip tape for proper adhesion.

I will chamfer the edges to the "holes" with a chisel to make it longer so there's a seamless transition. I also soldered and installed the 5.5mm connectors with 12AWG Turnigy wire on the 3D-printed risers. Looks neat and while the soldering job was good, it looks pretty bad when zoomed in! :sweat_smile:

**Update #4**

Wohoo! :grin: :grin: :grin: The package from Torqueboards arrived today!

This is what I got:

* Dual hubmotor kit 75KV.

* Spare urethane for hubs.

* 2x VESC

* CAN bus cable (won't be using it, but it's nice to have one just in case)

* XT-90 Y-splitter (won't be using it though)

* Cable for 2.4ghz reciver

I switched out the bushings because [I've heard they're shit](https://youtu.be/5P3ja8mnqyU?t=7m), but mine seemed OK though.

The VESC's looked nice as well, but I'll be removing all the wires and capacitors to make them fit my custom mount. But that's a week or two away, at least.

I'll be making a seperate, more in depth post about the hubs(not an update here) - but I'll give a quick rundown here as well.

First impressions:

* The urethane smells absolutely horrible. When I opened the box I almost vomited. The smell went away though.

* The urethane looks far from perfect. It has some creases, pictured below.

* They're heavy!

* Didn't look like in the pictures on their site. Looks like the locking ring is bigger on these - probably for the better.

* One grub screw was missing. Not a big deal though, I think I have some laying around.

* One of the tapped holes for the grub screw is tilted to an angle. Not a huge deal, but it won't make anything easier.

* You can definitely see that they're not a perfected product, but they still feel like they're good quality. 

* One motor is making a little more sound than the other one, hence the seperate post. 

I removed the front and back screws, cleaned them up & loctited them in place again.

Overall I'm glad they're here! Looks promising :slight_smile:

**Update #5** 

Bought some miscellaneous stuff as well.

The Vedder anti spark switch I bought from ProtoBoards seems defective, so I'll be using my old Torqueboards switch from my 6S build. But I still want a fuse so I'll be trying out the one pictured below. 

When I read up on fuses it seems the the amp rating is not all there is. The voltage they're rated for plays a big part. If they're not rated for the voltage they're used at they can arc and keep delivering, I think... :sweat_smile:

 The ones I bought doesn't have any voltage written on them and they look almost identical to the one that came with the ProtoBoards switch. 

I'll try and test one at a higher voltage/amp than my battery and see if it's adequate.

**Update #6** 

There was supposed to be only one update today, but I kinda screwed that up...

I'll be hiking in the Norwegian woods for a week, so I won't be active here.

[Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BMF4sPfRf4)  of a weird sound coming from one of the hubmotors(the video is loud) and [here's a not so interesting video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6hS0LvDc24) of me applying loctite to some screws.

Enjoy!

I hooked it up to an old RC ESC and when powering it on it twitched when counting the cells, so I'm hopeful :slight_smile:

**Update #7**

Finally mounted the enclosures on the board & soldered on the 5.5mm bullet connecters to the hubs!
 It looks like I'll be done with the battery this weekend and then we'll see if the odd hub motor works as it should or if I'll have to open it up again.

The M4 mounts are a little crooked when the screws are in, so I'll have to fix that. I also mounted the switch and charging port to the battery enclosure! The screws that hold the enclosures will be switched out with black, dome headed ones as they look nicer. The sensor wires will also get extended and put through the riser.

**Update #8**

Today was battery day, as is tomorrow! Yesterday I tidied up the VESC enclosure :grin:

I'm using 0.15mm by 8mm nickel strips. There's 2 layers, just to be sure. In my old 6S build I only used 1 layer and it held up just fine. So I'm sure this 10S pack won't have any issues with the welding. I'm using the same nickel strips on this build.

I'm being very careful about not soldering on anything directly on to the battery, instead I solder it on the nickel strip and then weld that to the pack. 

The small strips with solder on are going to get connected to balance leads and then shrink wrapped. I'm doing something similar for the positive and negative ends of the battery.

More pictures tomorrow!

**Update #9**

The battery is finished and the motor [I had to open up](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/torqueboards-75kv-hubmotors-making-odd-sound/31178) works better, I believe, than the other one. I also tested the shrink wrap on a small piece of the copper braid that will run down the board from the battery to the VESCs. 

I hooked everything up to my old VESC and ran it a little in sensorless BLDC in my living room. Even with only one motor it had plenty of power to push me around, so I'm very optimistic! [Here's a video of the opened motor's first test run.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LbiOh11bhU)

But since the board is concave, the battery is just a hair to thick at the moment. Not sure how I will remedy that since it already has minimum padding.

I tried two different ways to get good contact between the braid and the bullet/XT-90 connectors, pictured below. The one on the left is twisted and the one on the right is folded and then twisted. Turns out that makes a pretty big difference in contact area! Shouldn't make much of a difference though, as it shouldn't be the bottleneck.

**Update #10**

I set the battery, BMS and enclosure on paus since I'm not entirely sure on how to proceed since the battery is just a bit too big at the moment. So I went to work on the VESCs and it's enclosure, but I seem to have got stuck there as well! :expressionless:

It's a bit of a puzzle, really. Here's the steps:

1: I need to secure the hubs to the truck by drilling/filing some holes for the grub screws.

2: Then secure those and the end nut/cap with loctite.

3: Somehow thread on the mesh cable for the sensor wires, then solder them on to the extensions.

4: Redesign/remove the VESC-plate that will hold the upgraded capacitors and VESCs - because the motor cables takes up more space than I thought they would.

All this while still making sure I can easily remove/modify everything in the future :grimacing: It's going to be intersting to see how I get this shit done! I'm finally getting some time off now so hopefully I'll get it done in 2-3 weeks.

Still waiting for screws, charger and some other stuff.

**Update #11**

Today the chargers, charging plugs & the black M3 screws came in the mail! So I soldered the plugs to the chargers and then poured some epoxy into the black sleeve that goes over it, to strengthen it and make sure it stays in place.

I also counter sunk the holes so the screws would sit flush. It's not perfect yet, so I'll redo it eventually.

When I started drilling the holes for the grub screws in the truck I fucked up a wee bit. I drilled too deep :sweat_smile:
Drilled half way through the steel, so I won't be using those trucks! Instead I'll use those that came with the deck. The colour scheme is a little off but I'm not too bothered by that.

And after seeing @BoostedBuilder's pictures on his sanded Loaded Vanguard I got inspired and did the same to mine! Went over it very carefully with 120grit sandpaper on my orbital sander. I did go through the veneer where the VESC enclosure is though. But it was such a small spot that it won't effect it structurally :slight_smile: After that I went over it with 5 layers of clear laquer to seal it!

**Update #12**

Today I made the harness(?) that goes between the VESCs to the 2.4ghz reciever and temporarily soldered it to the reciever. I also tried using it but had no success - I'll revisit that tomorrow. 

Instead I hooked up my kama nunchuck, old VESC and the battery to mess around with it and try FOC. Using the quick "guide" made by @JohnnyMeduse [here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/10s-foc-why-should-i-do-it/27661/8) I had success! Took about 30 seconds and made it run very quiet. 

Buuuuuuuuuut I fucked up! [Video of that here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG4XvvkLFKw) As you can see in the first 3-4 seconds, it runs dead quiet! :smiley: But since I didn't expect the torque to be so massive I didn't bother securing the grub screws :grimacing: I've done the same tests using BLDC without a hiccup! Oh well, lesson learned. 

I also got a nice spark. Have to check the VESC if I fucked it up.... At least it was my spare one! :sweat_smile:

I did this test 2-3 times before I decided to film it, so it was pretty great timing actually! What I wanted to document though was the horrible screech that came when it reached top RPM. Absolutely horrible. My sister said she thought I was choking on something and came to check on me :joy:

Should probably limit the eRPM as well... Good thing I'm testing!

**Update #13**

Not too much has happened in the last few days. I did secure the hubs to the trucks with grub screws. I just drilled some small holes about 5mm deep for the screw to sit in. Then I loctited everything with 270, including the axle screw holding the hubmotor in place! I'll let that sit now for 2-3 days.

I did notice that the bullet connectors in the riser on the side which got ripped out has lost some friction and isn't sitting as well as it used too. 
Does anyone have any good tips on how to make sure they stay in place? :slight_smile: 

Hopefully I'll get around to making the reciever work in a day or two.

Here's a checklist on what's left to do:

* Get the reciever to work.

* Use the router to make a groove for the cables going over the deck.

* Solder the sensor connectors/adaptors in place.

* Somehow get the battery to fit.

* Connect the battery to the BMS and get the charging sorted.

* Griptape it.

* Add the capacitors the VESCs and mount them.

Hot glue is a favourite tool of mine (very easy to use, very strong when fully cooled if melted well during application, very easy to remove), though always not very pretty. You could also try to squeeze the female connectors so that they're smaller.

Also, is your VESC still alive? Poor little thing, having its motor ripped away so violently. Like a mother losing a child :'(

I joke, of course :P

**Update #14**

My enthusiasm for this project has started to drain just a wee bit, but I'm slowly making some progress.

Today I got started on the mounting plate for the VESCs. The attached VESC at the moment is my test VESC. Just wanted to make sure I've got the holes lined up properly. 

After drilling all the holes I put a sheet of kapton(meant for 3D-printing beds) tape on each side of the plate to make sure it doesn't short any of the VESCs. 

If anyone would be willing to confirm that my diagram for connecting the VESCs to the capacitors is correct I'd be very happy! As you can see in the chart below, the capacitors are "bypassed", allowing the VESCs to get power directly from the battery and not always from the capacitors.

Yesterday I also [tested FOC using the new VESC Tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bka49gULmk) and [BLDC, which was louder of course.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksmnQYjbnLQ) The cruise control didn't work on BLDC, instead it just started to stutter.

Don't worry about losing your enthusiasm! If you start to feel like you're spending all your free time on something that still needs a lot more work (I know the feeling), take a break from working on it. Clean up any mess you've made and go back to doing whatever you did previously in your free time (Overwatch anyone?). Then in a few days, decide that you're going to spend some more of your time on the project. You'll probably feel like it's the least fun thing you could possibly do, but just get in and start, and after a few minutes you'll be back in the groove and enjoying working on the board again.

That's what I do for big projects like this anyway ;)

You're doing a fantastic job so far and you've really inspired me to clean up my build a lot :D

**Update #15**

I followed @Clonkex's advice and took some time off from the project. Instead I began working on a "DIY button box" for helicopter/jets on Arma 3. Got the all the switches mounted and glued to the front panel, so now I just need to 3D-print the box. Turns out these things are very easy to do since you can just hook it up to a "zero delay USB encoder" and the computer will recognise it as a joystick - no coding required! :smiley: 

The board will have to wait another week and a half since I'm going to the Faroe Islands on Monday!

I built it myself. It's a cartesian printer where the build plate moves on the Y axis rather than the print head. Still gotta sort out what to use on the build plate though. I've printed a lot of stuff on that printer but I use blue painter's tape on the bed and prints stick waaaay too well. They're nearly impossible to get off and the tape usually becomes part of the print. My print head is too close to the bed, though, so it's probably squeezing the plastic into the tape :P

That's awesome :smiley: What material are you printing with?

I've got a Simple Metal with extended X-axis and heated bed. Thought I would need the heated bed since my prints had a tendency to warp in the corners. But when I upgraded the X-axis I got a sheet of Buildtak. 
And holy shiet, everything stick perfectly to it and more often than not they're easy enough to remove :slight_smile: It's also pretty neat to not have to apply tape everytime I'm going to print as well, I highly recommend it!

I also have a heated bed but that's an awesome suggestion about Buildtak, I totally forgot you could buy premade print surfaces like that. Already bought a sheet, very interested to try it! :D

Nice! Remember to sand it between every other print. I use 400grit and then grab a propyl alcohol tissue to make sure there's no dust :) Works great and is cheap in the long run!

**Update #16**

Back from the Faroe Islands but now I have to get up to speed in school! I won't be able to get back to building this week but I still wanted to make an update. So I figured I could post a parts list and prices since I have all the parts and have been getting some PM's about it. 

So here it goes! Prices does not include shipping, taxes or any other fees. Price listed is total, not per item. So "VESC x2 = 198USD" is the total cost, not per VESC.

* Loaded Vanguard.                              **$367 | 312€ | 3000SEK**

* Boosted style enclosures.                   **$142 | 121€ | 1161SEK**

* Dual hub motors from TorqueBoards. **$380 | 324€ | 3107SEK**

* 2x TorqueBoards VESC.                                **$198 | 168€ | 1679SEK**

* TorqueBoards Vedder style anti spark switch.        **$60 | 51€ | 491SEK**

* 40x Samsung 25R.         **$145 | 123€ | 1181SEK**

* Ebay BMS.              **$9 | 8€ | 79SEK**

* Wii Nunchuck and reciever.            **$44 | 37€ | 360SEK**

* Rough estimate of wires, connectors and misc.               **$61 | 52€ | 500SEK**

Total: **$1413 | 1203€ | 11558SEK**

The most worthwhile purchases here, without a doubt, are the enclosures from @Eboosted and remote/reciever from @rpn314. I know I've praised them before, but it has made this build so much easier I don't think I would have started if it weren't for those guys!

**Update #17**

For the past month I've barely had any spare time even though school is over. Finally, today I had some hours to spare! 

Recently a Swedish hobby/electronics store lowered their prices on one of their electric skateboard. Normally I wouldn't even consider it, but then I noticed that I could probably remove the electronics enclosure and trucks and transplant them to my Penny.

It took about one hour to complete it! Couldn't be happier :slight_smile: Now we'll see how long it lasts....

 I photographed the electronics to share with you as well! While the soldering/layout looks OK, the advertised 10km/6.2miles seems a little optimistic with that battery pack.

I hope to resume building my Boosted Clone soon. I'm going to San Francisco in a month, so hopefully it will be done by then, if I don't complete it by then I can't see me doing it before christmas!

Was it the hobbex esk8 :D ? Damn, I missed out on that one... I've had the same thing in mind for a while. While my DIY is super nice to ride, I sometimes just want to cruise to the grocery store or to the post office with a smaller sized board. 

Is that the nickel or the penny ? How'd you work around the flanges on the bottom ?

Yupp, that extra weight can really be off putting sometimes. This board will be my.... half last mile vehichle :joy: It's a Penny! Oh, I see how the pictures might be misleading now. There's actually a lid on it! If you look at the third picture you can see the reflections of two of the six screws holding the lid in place. 

Between the lid and the board there's some padding to distribute the pressure evenly and dampen the vibrations a bit.

**Update #18**

Finally got my thumb out of my ass and messed with the VESCs today! I removed all the wires and made sure everything fit before I start soldering again. The stand off risers has been secured with loctite, as will the VESCs once I have double checked that they're in working order and all hooked up.

It's going to be a tight fit in the enclosure, but totally doable! It was recommended that I secure the capacitors with hot glue to make sure they didn't vibrate against the aluminium plate, can't seem to find who said that, but thanks! It feels much more secure now :slight_smile: 

Tomorrow I'll solder it!

It was me :smile: 

I had a capacitor wear through its metal casing and it was just vibrating against a plastic housing. I was like what the hell. So now I try to tack everything down with hot glue and or have it wrapped in some dampening material. The micro vibrations from the road texture is like everything is attached to an orbital sander. 

Its looking real nice!

I have two questions regarding the capacitors:

1. Is it crucial to replace the VESC's stock capacitors with the x2 6800uF 63V capacitor?
2. Why did you chose this specific capacitor model? I saw that there are few other capacitors with the same specs but in much cheaper price. Is there any reason you went with this one?

Thanks!

Since the wires between the battery and VESC are longer than usual and I plan to run FOC I have to upgrade them. 

These are rated for high temps and are Still very cheap. I think each cost less than two dollars. That's nothing compared to what I've already spent.

**Update #19**

Fu*cking finally! I'm starting to get shit done again.

Today I laid the copper wire mesh and decided to just try and tape it to the deck like Boosted does and hope it holds. Turned out way better than I expected!
I then redrilled some of the holes where the inserts are in the deck since they were petruding quite a bit. After that I did what any sane man dreads to do - I applied the griptape. Even that went well! :grin:

I knew that there were probably going to be some small cracks between the two griptapes, so I took a sharpie and filled in it a bit before applying the "main" griptape. Worked out OK, though the copper shine a wee bit in one of the smaller cracks.:sweat_smile:

In the last three pictures below you can see the copper strands quite a lot, because I placed the light as to let them cast longer shadows.

[/quote]

**PRO TIP:**  Make sure the cuts are identical so the mating can completely close..  When placing multiple pieces of griptape next to each, to ensure a complete mating, use a heat gun on low heat to heat the seam and then push the seams together.  Let the seam cool and TEN trim the excess griptape.

**Update #20**

Today I came to a realization: I underestimated how bad the placement of the power button and charging port was :sweat_smile:

Even though it, in my mind, looks better to have them where they are rather than on the side it is clear now that they take up too much valuable space in the center. As it is now, I can not fit my current BMS. For now I will use it without one while I'm looking for a slimmer & smaller alternative. I still have the balance leads connected to each of the cell groups so checking the groups manually is still something I can do.

I also, without a BMS, tried out my charger. Nothing burned, so that's a relief! Here's small sample of how the charging went over time. It's a 2A charger on my 10S4P, which is about 10Ah. 


Starting voltage: **34.9V**

After 15minutes of charging: **35.5V**

After 45minutes of charging: **36.1V**

After 60minutes of charging: **36.6V**

Other than hooking up the battery I also put connectors on the copper braids that goes over the deck.

Are you planning to buy a more powerful charger or are you ok with 5hrs charge time? I mean you could just charge it overnight but some people prefer to be able to charge in only an hour or so. Totally up to you of course.

**Update #21**

IT'S ALIVE! :smiley:

So I put together the VESCs and soldered the positive and negative harnesses for it. Binding them together with small copper strand before soldering was oddly satisfying and really helped spread the heat evenly. At least it felt like it did.

I'm having some trouble with my NRF nunchuck that I bought so it's on the workbench currently. At the moment I'm using my old kama nunchuck and reciever. The board is set up in BLDC(CAN BUS) without the sensors since I've yet to hook them up. It runs a bit odd though, not sure what's wrong with my settings just yet. 

Here's some of the trouble I'm having:

* Both motors stutter when going slight uphill with(and without) cruise control. And I don't mean when going from a stand still.  Could be that I had them set at motor max 40A. I've since bumped that up to 50A but yet to try it out. But then again they do the same thing now on the bench so I'm not sure.

* If the board is at a stand still and I press the cruise control one motor(Slave VESC) starts to rev to top RPM. Nothing should actually happen if I press it without the throttle.

* When I throttle up just a wee bit the board keeps accelerating without me doing anything and it won't brake. It's as if the throttle is delayed, but I know it's not since it's only in the beginning that it is happening. Otherwise it's fine.

[Here's a video showing everything I just talked about.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VIo_ZMvpD4&feature=youtu.be) Any help on the matter would be very appreciated :slight_smile: I've read a lot about getting the right settings for VESCs and have done it before but this is my first setup with dual motors. Once I've got the sensors soldered and connected correctly I'll start using FOC.

```
I would suggest disconnecting the one VESC from its motor and from the receiver and/or canbus and taking it for a test run, the goal being to simplify the setup as much as possible to narrow down the source of the problem. If it runs without stuttering, try the other VESC. If they both work fine, I would check that they're both configured exactly the same. I'm no VESC expert but it might be worth re-running motor detection.

It also could be hitting the ERPM limit, depending on your voltage, motor KV and VESC settings.

Good tips! I didn’t think about narrowing it down using only one VESC/motor to test settings :slight_smile: Hahaha sometimes it feels like this thread is just a private conversation between us two :wink:

Uuuugh that's...  I have mixed feelings about that. On one hand it's way too much, on the other hand we have to give our own stores a shot. They can't possibly compete with something that doesn't have to pay tax.

This sucks. I live in Finland and we have same thing going on. Tou can’t order anything without 24% tax. And you just can’t get any of this awesome eskate stuff from Finland. Not even nice longboards or parts for them.

**Update #22**

It seems I blew my master VESC, in BLDC :thinking: My friend was on the board starting from a stand still. I'll probably look over my settings again and hook up the sensors before I start experimenting again.

 I've got one spare I could hook up. But I'm thinking I'd rather sell the two working 4.12 VESCs I've got and buy two FOCboxes instead... Those fit nicely in these enclosures apparently!

We'll see where I go from here.

Man that sucks. Does that photo show which bit blew? I can't see any issues. Unless you mean the little mark on the DRV, but that looks like either a soldering iron mishap or a bit of hot glue. Idk what they look like when they blow, though.

Yeah, it's actually that little mark! I hardly noticed it myself. Considering this is the biggest setback I've had in this build I think I'm doing better than most :sweat_smile: 

@themegak Thanks for the tip, but I think I'd rather sell it as is rather than trying to fix it.

Long time since the build was done. Hope you dont mind me asking some questions.
Have you testet the motors any bit. How are they holding so far? Do you feel they have enough torque?Do they get too warm? Would you prefer them?

Sorry for so many questions but i cant find long term usage review on them.

**Update #23**

So I've been pretty quiet for quite some time now! The thing is that I bought a house I'm currently renovating, so all of my freetime and money has been poured in to that :grin:

But now that summer is here I'm getting the itch to skate again, so I just ordered two focboxes from Unik. Sadly they seem to be on backorder which means it will probably take a while. In the meantime I'll try and fix my remote and keep on renovating!

I know that itch! I've been out of the esk8 scene for a few months now because I got too busy and ran low on spare money. In a couple of months I'll be working on a DIY OneWheel project I have in mind. I want to see how closely a hobbyist can replicate the quality, elegance, reliability and ease of use of the real OW.

I'm a little jealous of your summer, btw. It's winter here in Australia and it's not fun going out to start the car in -4°c :(

That month was a blast!:sunny::sunny::sunny:

OTOH they start hard-on implementing the tax on ALL the cheap stuff from China here in the Baltics as well. So far it has been 22€ max before tax his you, and the key on ordening expensive stuff from China is to use like TNT fast express which is like 50-70€, but that way they surely mark your shipment as 21.99€ and your total on ordering will be faster and cheaper still 

Love the clean look of this build!

**Update #24**

The focboxes came and I didn't waste much time getting them fitted in the case. Getting the power connected won't be too much of a hassle. I'm more worried about fixing the nunchuck I managed to neglect to the point of it not working anymore. Maybe I'll get to it this week :slight_smile: The wires from one of the foxboxes had to be longer as to not strain the solder too much.

Great photos of how you've mounted the Focboxes, I'll be following this closely as I'm doing the exact same thing... but I'm just a bit concerned about heat build up. Will the self-adhesive velcro be OK? Also are they just standard 5.5mm bullet connectors that you're using to take the phase wires out of the enclosure? Thanks :slight_smile:

When I was messing around with electric skateboards (on a hiatus at the moment due to lack of funds... motorcycles getting in the way and all that) I used self-adhesive velcro on the inside of a cardboard box. Cardbox is a terrible conductor of heat, and everything was tightly packed in. I had a focbox and a maytech vesc squished next to each other and they were completely fine. I'd be extremely surprised if you had overheating issues with that mounting system.

Interesting! I'll give velcro a go then. I think swapping the standard phase wires for thicker gauge wire is a great thing to do as well, better current transfer will help the mosfets out = less heat, I guess?

I believe @Clonkex persuaded you that velcro is OK, so I won't go into that ;) But I'm not using regular velcro. I'm using that "new" stuff that only has one side and it sticks to itself!

And yes, it's just regular 5.5mm bullet connectors.
