Well the time has come! I want to first thank you all for helping me get everything together to make sure I have the best parts for this setup. Here is where I'm at currently. 

-15ply Trampa Deck. 
-Trampa trucks. Vertigo front and Infinity rear (rear no cutouts due to cracking issues with these 
 wheels)
-Torque VESC x2
-12s4p 30Q cells
-Dual 6374 190kv BKB Motors
-Kaly Motor Mounts
-Kaly Battery Enclosure
-16/40t gears
-100mm MBS All Terrain Wheels
-Vedder Anti-spark / On off switch
-60A BMS 
-Metr Bluetooth Module

My goals were to have basically as much torque possible with still being able to achieve 30+mph. With these motors and this gearing I'm pretty confident I'll be there. 
 
Anyone that could provide tips and tricks I would greatly appreciate any insight. Right now there are a couple of questions I still have....

1) Remote. The options seem to be pretty crappy. If I want a reliable thumbwheel remote that you can just turn on without calibrating each and every time it seems I only have maybe one option and that is the benchwheel. I'm not super psyched about the aesthetics but oh well....

2) Waterproofing. I've seen talk of membranes, double sided tape, neoprene, etc. I want this to be as watertight as possible and I don't really understand the process to make it that way. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. 

I'll post pictures along the way and big shoutout to @Kaly and @Eboosted for primarily helping me out and answering my annoying questions :stuck_out_tongue:

The nano calibration really isn't all that bad. I really hated the idea of doing it at first but it takes so little time i barely notice anymore. Just a quick flick up and down and you're set. Technically you don't even have to calibrate but your brake and acceleration will be strong until you do. The ergonomics of the controller make it a pleasure to hold as well.

You can also get a GT2B and do the baby Buffalo mod on here, though it's a bit uglier than the benchwheel remote imo

For waterproofing, I use automotive weather seal around my enclosure. While it's not water"proof", I have ridden it in very wet (but not quite raining) weather. Think 100% humidity and drenched clothes. None of my electronics was damaged even though my battery isn't sealed in any kind of shrink wrap.

Maybe, but you'll need some kind of silicone seal around the enclosure which may make it difficult to take apart (keyword "may"). You'll also need to pick up ceramic bearings so they don't rust. There are a bunch of other parts that will probably rust when you subject them to water though such as skate hardware nuts and bolts, and trucks.

I'm not sure if the bearings Kaly is shipping are rust proof. I know these trampa trucks don't use standard 606 bearings. 

I wonder how succeptible the vertigo and infinity are to rust @trampa

The steel should be covered with some thin oil. We have the Titanium trucks (Ultimate) if you live close to the see. Kingpins are also available in Titanium
We also have stainless bearings.

Stuff coming in. Hoping to have this thing together by the end of the weekend :) 

Wondering the 8mm x 0.15 pure nickel strips will suffice for 12s4p setup.

Also trying to figure out a simple way to lathe these wheels down without a lathe haha. Burnout will work I suppose but man it's messy !

Coming along! Thanks for @kaly for the parts!!!


And now for more inevitable questions.... 

1) is the battery enclosure supposed to be centered perfectly on the deck? I didn't realize that the batt box isn't completely symmetrical front to back so for the two center joint to be right in the middle of the board the box won't be perfectly centered. 

2) for serial connections I was thinking about doing either 14awg or 10awg. I saw somewhere that you want them close to the center of the pack to make sure the parallel doesn't see full current (become part of series circuit). So would you suggest 2 in the middle like this?

Hello 

The enclosure will be 1/4 in offset, just fit it within the bottom of the deck, keep and eye on the end corners. 

On the serial connection you better use 4 pieces of 16awg for the connection it will be equivalent to 2 pieces of 12awg and will fit better.

Haha yeah it's a bit daunting. Although I doubled up on the nickel strips for the parralel connections, and did 4 wires on each series connection to make sure that in theory I should never have to open the front 3 sections. 

So the main compartment (rear section) is only 9 bolts, and I have the bluetooth module in there so can configure everything from my phone wirelessly :slight_smile:

Also you might notice that I threw the flywheels on there instead of the MBS wheels. I had a guy lined up with a mini lathe that could shave down my black wheels but then he got scared off because he said his lathe didn't have a ton of power. Apparently he uses dry ice to keep the wheels cold but his lathe heats them up too fast when taking off thane (thus not leaving a perfect surface). So until I find a solution there I think I'm just going to keep the flywheels on here...

Also @eboosted... did you end up leaving the springs in the inner setting or move them back to the outer setting? Damapas still in the back? Spring tension?

I used a lathe for my wheels, the surface finish wasn't perfect, but the wheel became pretty grabby.

I have my front springs on the inner setting and the rears on the outter, perfect combination for wobble free riding and coin turning

Interesting. I would've thought that the fronts in the center would be too loose at high speed. But I guess having the rears more firm at high speed makes more sense. Where are the springs dialed down to on both f and r?

So just some fidings from riding last night. 

I have ridden this with the springs in the outer position since I got it. First without dampas at all. At 185pounds with the 15ply deck I felt like it felt a little stiffer than what I'm typically used to (which is a boosted board)  so I guess that makes sense. If you want to go over 22ish safely you really don't want a super flex board so I was ok with that. I could do 30mph pretty comfortably with both spring in the outer settings and no dampas. 34mph was attainable got a bit uncomfortable. 

Then I added dampas to the back. I still can't tell if this just absorbs vibrations better or also stiffens everything up back there (given spring preload stays the same) @trampa can prob chime in here on this one. This made everything really stable. 30mph felt rock solid and I'm sure 34 would have too (didn't hit that speed because I limited motor watt to 1300 to avoid speed boost kick up top which almost has killed me :p). However it didn't carve worth a damn which I missed how I just could flow and carve so smoothly with my boosted board. 

Next I tried moving the front springs to the innermost settings. Holy crap what a diffence. I was able to carve even better than my other board. I could still hit 30mph but it was pretty sketchy even with the spring preload all the way tightened down. So here are my thoughts .....

I feel more than ever now is that you simply can't have the best of both worlds. If you want to bomb it at 30+mph you just will have to have a stiffer board, and it won't be as fun to ride at low speeds cruising and carving. I still am really wanting to find that sweet spot and I feel like it might be dampas in the front and back with front inner pos and back outer pos. If what I'm thinking is correct and the dampas add a bit of stiffness this will hopefully be a good middle ground. 

I'll report back and see what happens. 

Also I got the new hangar/mounts from @kaly and they haven't budged. Thanks so much dude I'll get you the others boxed up and shipped back to ya :) thanks for all your awesome support!

Try inner/inner, no dampas. Then try inner/outer no dampas, inner inner with dampas, etc. 
You will love the inner/inner for carving. Turns on a dime! I can still hit 35 km/h and that is enough for most paths and streets.

Outer front no dampa was JUSTTTT not enough turning, then inner front no dampa was JUSTTTT too much turning (even with spring cranked all the way down). My hopes are that inner with dampa up front it will make it just a bit firmer so I'll be in that sweet spot I need. I guess I just still don't have confirmation yet that dampas actually add stiffness (I know they soak up vibration). 

Also while I have you here, I'm getting a good bit of rattling around from the front truck that isn't there on the 4 or so other boards I've ridden. When I put my foot down on the front of the board where It turns upward it dampens those rattles and the noise goes away. Is there anything I can do to make it sound more solid when riding over cracks etc? I'm hoping it isn't just an innate characteristic of the board design (because you can't actually put your foot over the truck). I know it probably doesn't impact performance but I hate riding such a nice expensive board and it sounding like it is falling apart lol...

Are your nuts locked down? I don't experience any rattling on my boards.
Dampas ad a lot of stiffness in your suspension! I think you want to try the yellow ones first.

IMO you should only charge to 4.1 vs 4.2, you get a lot more cycles and that range isn't really usable capacity anyway

So I'm trying to lathe these MTB wheels. My friend has a mini lathe and he said something about using dry ice. Turns out he decided he didn't want to do my wheels because he thought even after frozen they would generate heat too fast and create a bad surface. 

Who here has done this? I don't want to mess them up :stuck_out_tongue:

If your battery is not charging 100% then you have one unbalanced pack, I've found all culprits of unbalanced cells are always bad solder jobs or broken nickel strips.

So when you charge it goes all the way to 50.4v instead of just under 50v when unplugged and at rest? 

I'll check everything but I have 4 serial connections per battery so I doubt that would be it. I suppose maybe it could be nickle strips. There really wouldn't be any way to check that wih a multimeter to see if a cell is loose because they are all in parallel correct? Only visual inspection would work here?

so I found that cell 1 is at 4.16v where the other 11 are at 4.09v. I discharged the one cell that was over voltage to match the rest. Charged all back up and the same result. It charged to 4.16 where the others were at 4.09v. 

Bad BMS maybe?

```
You have a connection problem between cells in one pack or between packs, one cell or pack must have reach critical low voltage, if you don't fix it you will increase the risk of exceeding the votage limit of the healthy packs.

On my Vanguard I've found one cell group had a loose connection, the whole pack went bad and it has 0.02v now, I'm in the painful process of replacing the pack.

I'm not going to use nickel strips ever on a flexible deck to connect packs, I'll use two 16AWG wires, better all around

```
I haven't been following the issue and my grasp on these topics is tenuous, at best (so, feel free to jump in if you think this is misinformation, etc), but to rebalance I would suggest charging to green... keep charging for a couple hours... then stop charging and let the pack sit (at least for a couple hour or overnight) and then retest.

On my e-bike, I only would charge up to 100% about once a month strictly for balancing purposes (otherwise, I'd keep it in the ~20% to 90% range) and that method was suggested to me years ago and it has always helped if packs were drifting.  My bike is at least a couple hundred cycles deep and I haven't noticed any significant reduction in range/performance.  It can take some time for BMS to do it's thing.

I'm not sure if that's the issue at play in this instance, but figured I'd throw it out there.  Good luck.

@JLabs Still having issues with the motor bell set screws slipping on the motor shaft at the bottom of the motor. I hope we can work out a solution here as this is really frustrating. 

@Eboosted thanks so much for the help. It ended up being a really hard to notice place where the nickle strip came loose on cell 1. Back to full charging to 100 percent again. Now just need to get motors as mine failed on me :/

I hope you have balanced the packs before putting them back in

I hooked an automotive lightbulb up to the cell that was just barely higher and got it right on point with the others then charged the pack as a whole to get it back to where it needed to be.
