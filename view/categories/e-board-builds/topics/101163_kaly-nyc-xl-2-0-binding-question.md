I‚Äôm just curious if anyone has any experience or words of wisdom regarding the addition of bindings to the kaly nyc xl 2.0. I know the addition of the wings/flaps to the deck helps lock the foot in. I‚Äôm also aware that the battery in the bottom mounted enclosure is not totally conducent to hard off road/AT trail riding. However I‚Äôm curious about adding bindings for light trail riding and improved maneuverability / carving. Ive been considering the freebord binding of course, as well as trampa and MBS and I‚Äôm leaning towards the MBS. Let me know what you guys think!

There was a guy over at ItsElectric Paris who had freeboard bindings on his. Seemed to work well.
Here's a video from his channel.

The decks are made from Wolverine's bones, so drilling requires some forethought and dedication.

I wouldn't think so, for someone who is skilled at that type of thing. 

Something to be mindful of is the battery pack and the mounting hardware of the bindings. My battery (12s7p) would have been too large, and rubbed against the mounting hardware. To fix this, the mounting hardware will be sunk into the deck.

Ah makes sense. I kind of figured it would require a little more than a simple drill hole. I haven‚Äôt received my board yet so it‚Äôs hard to access the challenges I‚Äôll face. 

Hahaha wolverine bone. Any adamantium I‚Äôll have to drill through as well? @DerelictRobot

All mountainboard decks I've come across have large, countersunk holes on the bottom of the deck so the hardware sits flush in the deck and doesn't short your battery out.

Nuts go on top side of deck.

I will be doing this with an MBS DW2 deck, mbs f5 bindings, and an hs11 bottom enclosure. Still going to put tape over the countersunk bolt heads to prevent scratching.

When you drop the enclosure you will find the motor wires are quite short I didn‚Äôt bother removing back truck but it will make drilling easier  , I was advised by a friend to put glue in the holes so as not to risk splitting the deck but I didn‚Äôt bother and it didn‚Äôt split apart from that it‚Äôs a piece of piss lol

Ya I‚Äôve briefly talked to him about it but I know he‚Äôs a busy dude and it‚Äôs not easy to get ahold of him. He basically said bindings aren‚Äôt needed and that was the extent of the convo. I trust his opinion, however, I really want a board with bindings for trail riding. Nothing mental that would warrant moving the battery to a box on top of the deck though.

Thanks for the advice!! That definitely helps. 

@venom121212 I‚Äôll definitely tape the hardware.

Well Yes Ernesto is correct , we don‚Äôt really need bindings , I rode for a bit without them and it‚Äôs perfectly rideable without them , its more of a personal preference thing . On a different subject though , if you are considering buying those kaly light holders , buy them before board is shipped and ask him if he will fit them because they are an absolute bastard to install without scratching the hell out of your trucks

How did you measure your drill holes? I see you marked them with orange. Did you place the bindings on the top of the deck where they felt good then drill down from top to bottom, then flip the deck for the counter sink?

Oh thanks for the heads up!! I was actually considering buying them at a later date. 

Ya I definitely think bindings are a personal preference with the new kaly decks. I‚Äôve been snowboarding since I was 4yr old, so having a board strapped to my feet isn‚Äôt a new sensation. However falling on asphalt or dirt while locked into a board is definitely a different story haha. Those freebords definitely have me curious. Do they handle the weight of the board well or are they a bit too flexy?

My deck had them drilled out.

I did do a rough diagram for someone though.

I had them on my kaly 1st gen aswell , and Yes I put them on the board where I thought they felt ‚Äúright‚Äù marked them with a felt tip (2 holes per binding ) and then removed the enclosure and drilled from top to bottom , you can adjust them (rotate them ) afterwards . They are not to ‚Äúfloppy‚Äù I would say to ride the board for a good many batteries before deciding to do this as you may feel that you don‚Äôt actually need them , I really like the full trampa bindings with heel straps too but are not at all practical for use in an urban environment , I also like the MBS full
Bindings too but have chosen to go with the freebord ones (twice now)
