```
Can I solder an xt60 and a two pin connector to the black and red wires and the gray one that’s coming from the battery pack and going inside the board?

I bought several extra v1 packs and I am curious if connectors would ruin anything.

My gut is telling me it’s gonna be ok but just wanted to double check and haven’t gotten a straight answer yet.
