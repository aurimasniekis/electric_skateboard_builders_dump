My E-MTB which I have updated a lot recently. Got the Trampa monster box -- it fits my (3) 6000mAh Graphene 4s batteries and (1) 4s 2650 mAh zippy compact to run the LED flood light.

I am pretty sure that I can also fit a ham sandwich in there.  

So here it is... trying to get the wire management sorted out still a little -- the VESC6 comes with just insanely long motor leads.  It's cool if your motors are very far away. Else you have to fold them or cut and re-solder shorter.

What else can I say? Not much except that even 8S is really OK for me but I did go 12s for science and its just crazy fast. Vesc6 are very smooth and this being my first to VESC from ESC... it has made esk8 fun for me.  The throttle curve and delay timing, etc just really are a world apart from Max6 ESC.

The final pic... added some white paint liner to the monster box "TRAMPA" lettering, cleanup of cables, etc:

Looking sexy af ! :smile:
Glad to see the 

I see on your first pic that you didn't protect the power leads of your VESC 6.
The case has sharp edges so you want to protect leads with a piece of heatshrink to avoid having them being hurt.
Mentioned that in the early beta stage, but it seams the rubber has not been done yet.

@trampa, any update about those rubbers ?

Thanks... eeew did not know that about the lead. So I have to find a heat shrink that can slip over that xt90 and slide it up to the box i guess?

Yes.
Or you may need to de-solder the XT90 to do that :confused:
Oh, and heatshrink your VESC XT90 as well.
I had an issue after jumping a lot with the board, one of them (the master one unluckily) disconnected by itself.

@lunasicc  -- I did.. re-did the wires!

@tomisdizzy - Got the wiring diagram and got it all set-up. Added some white liner to the logo. Thanks for coming thru and all the support.

What is your amp draw under load if you have measured it?  I'm planning on doing a dual 6374 build so I want to make sure the FOCboxes can handle 12s.  This will be long board, not mountain board. Also whats your riding weight?

Watt meter: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigytm-7in1-mega-meter-battery-checker-watt-meter-servo-tester.html
 Or
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-100a-60v-multi-function-watt-meter-w-temp-sensor.html

Not very expensive but by using it you can tell how much you are actually pulling to better determine proper battery use.

CREE -- 18watt off of Amazon.  I wired it to an on/off xt60 switch and then a 4s 2650mAh battery pack. It draws only 1.5 Amp of electricity so it lasts like hours and hours for just a single charge.

LED:

On/Off Switch:

Battery:

And that's how you answer a question ;) Booyah!!
