Watch this video for the battery. 
WHERE IS THE RECEIVER FOR YOUR REMOTE CONTROL?
You need male to male connector for that bro.

I'd suggest spending a little extra and going for a bigger motor. It doesn't cost much extra and you'll get better performance. I wouldn't recommend the 3D printed motor mount. Others have tried and they've failed on them only after a short amount of use.

For vesc configuration it's super easy. There's a step by step playlist on YouTube that you can watch which makes it very clear. Don't be daunted by the setup and configuration process, the complexity isn't far off from being plug and play ;)

As far as the battery goes if you want to do it yourself you'll need a spot welder. Otherwise @barajabali should be able to help with a prebuilt battery.

Well I don't have a bms but I'm pretty sure a 42v 2a power adapter should work. Just check with someone else to make sure
