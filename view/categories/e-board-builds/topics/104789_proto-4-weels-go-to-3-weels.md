![20191216_112640|615x500](upload://aD3G1SHpMQJVRTiMSoH79r3M2Em.jpeg) Hello everyone. I wanted to know if the community would be interested in this concept, which using a motor + wheel group would transform a 4 wheel at 3 wheel.  thanks.

Whatvdo you mean with transform? Is it reversible fron 3 to 4 again?
In any case, great design, I like the idea

yes, the idea would be to be able to change from one to the other.  I already use a fastening system for my board. and make a rear rear train including the vesc motor and the wheel which would be fixed to the board![20191016_164956|375x500](upload://tEYuQSTMi74sG5anZZsR1o0HRin.jpeg)

What about drive sensation? With two trucks I think you will able to carve faster than a 3 wheels.
Do you want to use the same kind of wheel for the rear in the 3 wheels mode?

8 or 9 inch, I have these two type of wheel.  the goal of this construction to come is to find the feeling of carve and not necessarily a crazy speed. I tested a simple assembly motor at and a 3200w 130kv does the trick very well, torque and correct speed.

really good job. I think to make the rear part in aluminum, for the transmission I still hesitate between hub and belt. The hub assembly is really clean.  but in belt I would have more option for my transmission ratio (pulley and pinion which can be changed easily)

I live it! The three-wheeled revolution begins!

@Gols It's worth playing with a geared design. You should do it. I'd like to hear more about your results.

@wireload That's a great design and very DIY accessible. Does the back bracket drag at all when you turn?

No, it drives better than I expected. I used basic hardware store 50mm x 5mm steel and welded it together. Also, I used softer bushings in the front to be able to turn easier and since it has a lot of inertia with 200 mm wheel at the back and 100 mm skateboard wheels in the front so it is stable when you ride it.

My three-wheelers are more efficient than my four wheel boards. I'm excited to see what kind of results you get. I prefer BLDC over FOC with the big motors. Also, I've been getting really good results from the 200mm 48v motor that I use on my roadsters. If you ever want to do a build with it, it's easy to find on ali-express.

I think to stay in 10s, because I have a 3200w motor in 130kv and a trailing vesc.  and transmission side I think to be in 72/15

I also bought mine from aliexpress. I picked the cheapest one just to try it out and did a concept from wood before doing this. I tried connecting hall sensors but I have different color of wires on my Flipsky VESC than on motor and one more wire is coming from motor. So the goal is to try and fix the sensors in the future since I'm driving sensorless now but it's still super smooth and quiet. I am a beginner in this and some refinement is planned :) 
I also find this replacement tire that could fit my motor so it would look the same as yours : https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32889320744.html?spm=a2g0o.detail.1000013.15.4a8c214cdT8lkm&gps-id=pcDetailBottomMoreThisSeller&scm=1007.13339.146401.0&scm_id=1007.13339.146401.0&scm-url=1007.13339.146401.0&pvid=e80a494a-cdfc-4178-b139-c38263fe8bda 

This is what first verison looked like:

@wireload This is awesome. Usually the wires for the hall are black to GND. Red to VIN/5V. The extra wire is for the temp. The other wires go to the phase sensors in no specific order. Sometimes the diagram is listed at the bottom of the Alibaba post from which you bought it. I hope that helps a little.

If you'de like to learn more about making your own skate decks so that you can bring your design to a hole new level check out www.roarockit.com.

Thank you for all the advice! I was moving to another country and it was hard to dedicate enough time for this so I will spend January to refine everything. The idea is to use it as a daily commute that is around 6 km each way of nice bike lines. 
I made skateboards from wood before, this was just a prof of concept for one week before cutting the bamboo longboard that I had. It's cool that you have EU website to buy from, I would love to try and build bamboo board myself!

Here's a ride-a-long on the 48v roadster. It can reach 30mph with ease and climb hills at around 25 mph.

I'm gong to make some decks for people to do DIY builds for both the roadster and MTN board after the new year. They'll be available on my website 3SK8esk8.com. 

@wireload What is the distance between your brackets? In other words, How much space do you need to mount your wheel?

I Saw some scooter DIY videos and they made it with two axles, as for the deck, I will just modify the one I have, reinforce it with steel and i think that would do the trick, my only concern is these motors usually have more torque than speed, so i don't know if it will be fast enough

The 48v 1000w motor that I have been using for my roadsters goes fast and has great acceleration. If also climbs like a champ. The problem is that it requires a 13s battery to optimize it. My burst current never exceeds 75A and my running current is right around 20A. My motor is rated for 30A, so it doesn't get overworked easily.
