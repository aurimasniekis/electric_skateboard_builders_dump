Hey guys,

I was wondering how would it be possible to make a slide on enclosure for my batteries. For my setup i must remove the batteries from the enclosure to charge them so i was wondering if there was a way to slide the enclosure on and off the bottom of the board but still be secure to not fall off and be vibration resistant.

I was thinking of different joint/hinge types but had no luck. Any suggestions?

does it just use normal screws? wouldn't it slide off if so?

i haven't gotten mine yet so i can't let you know for sure, but I would certainly hope not :expressionless:
maybe someone who has used it could chime in?

woa, that would really annoy me over time. what stops you from adding charging ports to your enclosure? :confused:

haven't researched it enough and want to keep my first build simple and then progressively make it better as i find weaknesses and areas that need improving. I don't mind unplugging th batteries i would just like to figure out a way to slide then enclosure on and off but still be safe and in place so it doesn't fall off

Be careful with a slide mechanism. If the ride can unscrew bolts then it can surly slide it open too if it doesn't have a good locking mechanism.

Im charging my board pretty much daily, since I commute 20km for about 200 days a year ... plus extra tours on the weekend, usually 2-4 charges per weekend. i can confidently say that I wouldnt use my board that often if I had to open an enclosure and take out my battery for charging every time. it sounds incredibly annoying and impractical. especially since my enclosures are usually packed very tightly with optimized supershort wires to avoid any "long battery cable" effects. brrr, just add a charge port :stuck_out_tongue:

yeah this is what i don't want to happen, which is why i was wondering if anyone knew the best way to go about this :) maybe with a joint of some kind or hinge?

yeah i totally understand that. I plan on having my battery in separate enclosures anyway as i have a loaded vanguard so i would just like to slide it off and plug them into the parallel charging board i got

im also not sure how often ill be riding the board so i don't mind taking it out of the enclosure, but if it gets to a point where it gets annoying, that will be my next board upgrade

I use M5 screws on my enclosure. 3 on each side. I bought and 5$ electrical screwdriver from Ikea and it opens up in seconds.

@Raf - You simply just use a bolt where the bolt head is exposed on the bigger portion of the hole cut outs on the flange of the enclosure. It does depend on the deck used as some decks might need the enclosure to be secured harder than other decks usually do to the concave. If this is the case, you will need to tighten the enclosure and you won't be able to undo it unless you back out the bolts a bit. So for this reason, it does depend on the deck.

@whitepony - There are no charging ports for this enclosure it's more meant to keep ESC & LiPo packs separate that way you can easily pop open the battery enclosure for the lipo packs. If your referring to the on/off switch port, different on/off switches have different cut out holes. I didn't include them that way you don't have unnecessary or unwanted holes. People would be forced to purchase my on/off switch if that was the case and/or have an empty hole. Most people should have a drill and/or a few drill bits and/or a file to widen the on/off switch hole.

**Lipo vs 18650 flat packs**
@whitepony - Your using a different battery pack this pack is for lipos, not 18650 packs. Before when flat packs weren't available. I'd have 3-4x sets of 2x3s or 2x6s packs and just swap packs. Charging those packs take 30mins to an hour. I'd have 20+ mile range swapping packs. They do get annoying when you do it too often + you do have to carry the additional packs in a backpack. I used 7-8" tablet covers on ebay for a few bucks to hold 2x packs. These enclosures make swapping the packs a bit easier.

However, the prices of 18650 flat packs are getting much cheaper. I'm selling a 6s4p pack for $260 which equals to about 10+ miles if not more and miamiboards is selling a 12s2p for around $280. So if you add up the costs for a lipo setup vs 18650 flat packs the prices are fairly a bit cheaper and more convenient since you have the plug in charging capability.

@Raf - If your costs for lipo add up to $260 or more.. I'd probably strongly consider an 18650 flat pack.

If he use li/ion battery than charging ports is logical to have, but if lipos: they are not safe, if something goes wrong, all esk8 will turn to ashes.

yeah I'm using lipos another reason why i will take them out so i can see if they are expanding or not

Im thinking of maybe using some metal car door clips. That way i could just rip off the enclosure and they're are pretty strong. This will also mean there would be no screws which would leave a clean stealth look (my project aim)

Maybe just try lock lunch box, something like this http://www.amazon.in/Lock-Seal-Lunch-Box-1000ml/dp/B00R67SEOY. Lock mechanism is strong, and if you need thinner box just cut off the bottom of it and screw it to board.

I'm going to custom make the enclosure so i will be able to add what i need to it (car clips if needed or bolt screw or other slide mechanism maybe a hinge and lock)

I may have something figured out. Ill add two neat hinges to the back

And a few metal car clips on the front to keep it clipped in and secure.

Anyone feel like this may not work or has issues? would the vibration cause it to open? car clips are pretty secure

What would you call that style of mounting? Like the little keyhole shaped things? I'm trying to make my own enclosure, and want to use this, but can't figure out what it's called.

Wow, alot of commute. This is why i am building myself a longbkard. I live in nyc and ride my bicycle 5-6 days a week to and from work. I do 10 miles avery time i ride. Bicycle is fun to ride but i just want another fun way to ride. And longboard is much faster. And you dont get tired. What setup do you use,Especially battery? What kind of wheels do yoy use and how long they last? And do you use belt of chain? Thaks in advance

* my allrounder is a single motor belt driven 10S4P vanguard flex 2 with 90mm abec 75A flywheels

* my favourite is a single motor belt driven 10S3P DIY bamboo deck with 80mm kegels/90mm stickies (sufficient battery for 20km commute, very light board, best ride)

* finally my fresh power setup is a dual motor direct drive 10S4P pneumatic wheel trampa

ive yet to replace urethane wheels from wear, they just last forever if you dont slide! even heavy carving does not really seem to affect the wheels!

Great setup, mate. I am building 8s3p batterg. Hopefully it will lust 10-15 miles on one charge. I mean, i am preatty sure it will. I have thise orange kegel wheels (not sure is i spelled it right). And i will have dual motor. My motors from alien power systems. Thanks for the info
