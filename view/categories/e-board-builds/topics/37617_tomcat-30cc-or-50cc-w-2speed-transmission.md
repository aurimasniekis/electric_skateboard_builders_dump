I want to eventually gear my board for 2 speed transmission connected to two wheels ( looking like I can only do one wheel unless motor is modified) with this motor or the 30cc version https://www.ebay.com/p/TOMCAT-G50cc-Gas-Giant-Airplanes-Brushless-Outrunner-180kv-Motor-Tc-g-8825-kv180/2162960030?iid=282090587473 <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/c/cc7101036fff56e319905c20aad74baa4eb1875b.jpg" width="690" height="388"> I want a world record top speed for mountain board through Guinness.. That's dreaming though ha.

Hi, I'm also interested in building a fast board.  Maybe not a world record yet haha, but still faster than what most want to build.  What 2 speed transmission were you thinking of using?  I'm playing with the idea of using a 2 speed with my board on an electric motor to increase initial takeoff torque.

The idea fell through but that motor is the one to use with a 4 to 1 ratio
