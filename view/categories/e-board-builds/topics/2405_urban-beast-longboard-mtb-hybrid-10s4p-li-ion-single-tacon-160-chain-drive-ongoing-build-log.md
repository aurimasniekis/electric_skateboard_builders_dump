Hello Guys,
Here I will document my next build, including the construction of a Li-Ion pack (with 18650 sleds).
I really liked the smoothness and versatility of the 8in pneumatics on my e-mtb, but I also like a deck with concave. Most mountain boards seem to focus on camber and pop, but I just want a comfortable (fairly) long-range commuter. This build aims to embody that.

Here's what I've decided on so far:
Tacon 160
VESC or TB 12s ESC
1:5.5 reduction and #25 chain
8in pneumatics
10s4p LG HE4 pack
longboard deck (maybe custom)
channel trucks (they look extremely badass and I'm not too fond of tkp mountainboard "skate" trucks)
custom motor mount

Here are some renderings of the custom deck and wedges that I'd like to have made (please let me know if you can help with this, I don't have access to any cool tools besides a soldering iron, a wrench, and a drill)

@Paragon That looks awesome! Do you have an enclosure design in mind or are you designing something that is universal mount?
```

I'll probably design a thin aluminum and cf enclosure for the bottom of the deck or buy an abs one from @psychotiller 

Ebay also has some aluminum project boxes that look pretty good (and so do the prices).

Nice looking project :slight_smile: 
I have been working on something similar <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/9/9289c42c466f062ff61fd6e625279e9b73c1a21c.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

The problem with this configuration is that the motors will hit the base when trying to turn, it will be good if you try to model the truck with the base and motor mount and check for clearance.

Thanks for the info!
How is the ride with those wedges? Is it still solid and precise?
I'll be using a pintail deck I have (until it breaks, then I'll use the custom one above if I can find someone who can make it), and I'll be mounting the motor inwards, in this manner:

Sneak peak at my foam core design (another potential deck option). This is the bottom of it.
The enclosure and 35 degree wedges are built in :slight_smile:
I'm still deciding on a concave though; probably tub or "w"

Contrary to popular belief, this build is still going on (slowly but surely).
Here are the soldered 18650 sleds for my 10s4p li-ion pack. 4 gauge single strand copper wire is a bitch (I'm learning French) to solder, and takes forever to cool. I used a bunch of household objects to hold everything in place, and I kept a bowl of water on the side (to cool the copper after the solder solidifies).

Well, the forum won't let me update the first post so here's an update:
After lots of limitations and unforeseen issues, I had to revise the plan.

**Final Specs:**
2016 Jet Potato 29in deck

Maytech rebranded FVT 12s 120a esc with the nice aluminum heatsink/enclosure (it comes in red so I may strip the anodizing to match my deck)

custom abs enclosure made by Psychotiller

Tacon 160 245kv

12v switch

BEC that outputs 12v

12v loud buzzer (this will be used as a horn; it's a lot bigger than the piezo buzzers used on multirotors)

Turnigy receiver controlled switch

USB port (for charging things)

"Hoverboard" 10s charger and charging port

Channel (spring) trucks

Ground Industries MAK tires with Terraintula carbon fiber and aluminum hubs

Bestech D205 10s BMS

40x LG HE4 cells

20x Dual 18650 holders 

Capacity meter (the one most people are using)

80T sprocket

10T sprocket 

25 Size chain

Custom CNCed 35 degree wedges and motor mount

**This build must and WILL be completed this week**

Here is where I'm at (10s4p battery pack with the BMS, USB charger, switches, charge port, and capacity display fully functional):

It'll still be an urban beast, but with a 29in deck, Mini Monster may be a more appropriate name.

40x LG HE4 cells: $125
20x Dual 18650 holders: $40
BMS: $55
= $230
On next battery, I'll do some cell level fusing and solder the whole thing (that'll cut 40 bucks off the cost).

For an enclosure, hit up @psychotiller 
He does a great job. He has a lot of designs on his site, and he'll do custom enclosures to your specs.

since its meant for urban, maybe try trampa/mtb or the freebord bindings that I got on my spud - think that could make this beast even more fun for stairs & co!

Well I hit a bit of a road block.
The cnc shop forgot to thread the two holes that hold the motor mount together.
I got a tap kit to thread the holes myself, but the tap broke inside the hole.
Only thing left to do is fix that, so I could mount the motor.

:open_mouth:

and I thought I was the only guy in the world with that issue. I just couldnt ride my trampa for very long - at least not in a touring carving way. wondering if I bought the wrong flex or something, but according to trampa the middle holypro should have been fine for my weight.

sorry for the tap incident, thats pretty annoying and sounds really hard to fix with just drilling the hole again through the tap - think these things are really hard. :confused:

Dude, get concentrated nitric acid and leave motor mount inside for couple hours, it should dissolve tap, aluminum will form aluminum oxide on it's surface and won't etch further. You're welcome ;)

Looks sick!  Can't wait to see how it works out.  Those gears are HUGE so let us know any rock/impact issues?  with chain maybe not as much of an issue.  Shoot some videos if you can.

Great build man - hope it rides well.  Are you going to add the foot bindings like @okp's spud?

Probably freebord bindings

I'm using an 80T wheel-side sprocket because I'm using such a high kv motor (245kv). I still expect it to hit 20-25mph at WOT.
The 45T on my 6s build (Project Paragon) is less than half the size :joy:

I rode it for about two minutes around my yard and no skipping chain so far (after removing a half link that I didn't need). I wonder how well it'll fare on some hard braking.

Side note: the stock firmware on this esc (fvt maytech 12s 120a esk8 esc) is a lot more tame than the stock firmware on my 6s fvt120a (car esc).
It still has a lot of torque, but the board won't throw you off the back if you gun the throttle (I wouldn't mind a more aggressive throttle though).

Didn't work well on the sand, but it was a blast everywhere else and I got this beautiful picture. 
It also turns better than my other e-mtb so the angle brackets are a success!

Throttle curve is nice, but a little docile for my taste (for starting on hills). Brakes work well, but it feels like they're either on or off; I don't think the control on them is proportional.

Can I ask a huge favor of you? Could you take two measurements off that deck? One of the wheelbase and another of the inside of the wheel/fender cutouts? It would be extremely helpful. I want this board but my enclosure may be too big. How did the flat enclosure form to the concave? My enclosure is 19.5 inches long.

It was pretty tough to get my enclosure fit to the tub concave. I think it depends on how big the lip on your enclosure is and how much of the depth of the enclosure you use. 
My battery pack was pretty wide, so I didn't have room for much of a lip on my enclosure. I compensated with some waterproof foam lining for windows (from Home Depot) and It worked very well.
As for the dimensions:
Between the wheel wells: 17in
Wheelbase using the further rear truck mount (measured between the center of the holes): 21in

Best of luck with your build.

Hi there! Really nice board.. I think you would win a place in a competition for the ''unordinary'' looking boards, since it is custom made and no other 8'' wheel board I've seen is this short in lenght :slight_smile:
 
Anyways - I had a question - do you have enough clearance for the sprocket from the ground? I know e-longboarders are having their pulleys very close to the ground but their terrain is usually flat surfaces.. so I wondered does it make a difference like hitting objects with the sprocket / chain or not..

----
 Perhaps not as big of an issue for chain drive.. but could be worse for belt drive, I think.. although have not seen / made any tests how much impact it can make if your sprocket constantly hits little objects on the road :)

--

If I were you with access to a cnc machine, I would have designed the mount where the motor comes a little bit more customized, something like this:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/0210069d68a7e667684e941dcfbabf08474fcd3f.jpg" width="454" height="500">

I think you could have cut out little ''half circles'' in between, where motor screw rails come. Now with the motor being also so round in shape, it sometimes make the mount stand out more than the motor :)

Although it is up to you and you were the design creator, so these are just my thoughts on how it would have looked nice, if I were machining the mount :) perhaps you can implement this design in the next builds / motor mounts if you plan on doing more :)

Nice weight saving technique for the motor mount, but I left the extra beef because it seems to act as a heatsink (I wasn't sure how hot the single motor would get while going uphill for an extended period of time).

I'm going to look into getting a CNC machine soon; I've been having my parts made overseas.

Does it have any drawback using battery sleds instead of spot welding (or direct soldering) the cells? 
I think about the resistance between the sled and the battery connectors. Driving significant current through this resistor can result in heat and loss. Or if you use several cells in parallel, then the current load is divided among the cells. So there is not much to worry about?

Actually I don't have access to a spot welder, so I'm planning to use sleds as well...

The pack stays cool my whole ride, and I got the sleds with the lowest resistance I could find.
I can pull a cell out if one goes bad, or change the whole pack to a completely different 18650 chemistry in a matter of minutes, and I don't have to heat up each cell with a soldering iron.

Also, I don't know why people were cracking on that BMS I was selling. I have one on this build (single Tacon 160 245kv, 10s, 8:1 reduction, 8in mountainboard tires) and everything works well. I go up hills and off road all the time without any issues.

It says 20a continuous, but over-current doesn't kick in until 100a+, which is perfect, yet people wanna get a BMS that is 3 times the size, when it isn't even needed.

Have you thought about measuring the real amp draw on your build?

If you do so, please post your info here:


**ESK8 Databse**
http://gct-hp.de/esk8/

We plan on improving the page more, so that in the future people could easy take a look at numerous boards  and see what their stats are! Especially for VESC, energy use and Ride conditions etc..

---
As of right now there should be a working ''compare view'', to compare two boards / builds. We plan on implementing a function to compare exact criteria you would like to see and finally export it to excel or other charts..

----

Othern than that - could u share where you found your battery sleds? Yours look a little bit different from what I've seen on ebay.

Great site, I'm waiting on some equipment so I can do more testing on this setup. 

I got my sleds here:
https://www.fasttech.com/products/3827700 
I got the ones with the SMT tabs because my outside resources suggested that the bronze-type tabs are better (less resistance) than the silver colored ones.

Also, I just got this action cam and first impressions (messing around with it in the house) are pretty good, so I'll probably strap it to my helmet (safety first :) ) and go for a ride soon. http://www.banggood.com/Hawkeye-Firefly-7S-4K-120-Degree-7mm-Lens-Sony-CMOS-WIFI-Real-time-Playback-Preview-Camera-p-1058047.html?p=842322733432201408CW

2*18650 Battery Clip Holder w/ SMT mount (the one with the gold colored tabs)
Tips: if you use some thick gauge single strand (solid) copper wire (I used 4 gauge), you will have a very hard time soldering unless you remove the thin enamel on the wire (I did this by lightly scuffing/sanding the places I wanted to solder).
I had the same problem when lengthening my Tacon wires; it looks like they directly use the leftover wire from the windings to make the 3 phase leads rather than soldering on some flexible wire.

Also, test EVERY connection; I had one parallel group that only had 2 out of 4 cells connected, so I had to repair the joint and balance the cells in that group individually before reconnecting everything.

Do you have more detailed pictures of your soldering and how you done it by any chance? I've never built a battery but this might be the best chance to get one for my build. I might do it 12s2p though

I've posted all of the pictures I have on this thread.
Generally, it's best to connect parallel groups first (you would have twelve groups of two), then connect everything in series.
If you have any questions let me know :slight_smile:

Is there any chance you can post directions on how you were able to wire all the sleds together then to the switch and charging port? I've been searching for days on how to do this and can't find any help

Hey, if you find a great resource on how to build Li io packs, that would be great!

Also doing my first battery job.. I swear, it is a lot more work intensive than I thought..

Just remember to Arrange the cells in + - + - manner, so that you get the serial circuit.

@paragon Had one more question - how high up from the ground the deck is? Is it still comfy to ride this thing?

I noticed that only 2cm in deck height makes a lot of difference :)

Might be interested in these wedges.. but I assume I need to get proper spring trucks first..and also not sure about the shipping cots and such :)

Good to know they held up. I found some 55 tooth scooter sprockets that work great for me. I had to put some spacers and drill new holes to make them work.  ![IMG_20181221_173126064|375x500](upload://8b1EyIiQude6PupMGdzhubC9MFU.jpeg)
