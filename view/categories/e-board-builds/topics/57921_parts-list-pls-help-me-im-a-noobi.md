What type of battery are you looking at lipo or Li-ion

I don't really know meybe a lipo, just the best for the price I think. and and the easiest to install.

Lipo would be cheaper then li-ion most likely but you still have to figure out how you are going to charge them and what kind of series and parallel you want.  Also you need to have an idea of how much range and speed you want.  Also what type of deck are you doing this on.  Looking at your parts the skate tool is not needed if you have nut drivers and socket wrenches currently you are just under $500 without the deck and battery and enclosure.  I'm not sure you can do it for under 700.

@okp at unikboards is based in EU and would probably be able to get your parts quicker.

For that motor you'll probably want a 10s battery. You'll also need a way to charge it requiring a BMS (Battery Management System) or Balance Charger. I would recomend reading these threads.

Go with a 12s2p stealth battery from Miami electric boards and grab a BMS it comes with a charge port on and off switch and it Is great also u would get just the motor mount and puelly system from Diyelectricskateboard and buy nice wheels such as orangatang kegels, or Abec flywheels, and buy caliber 2 trucks and pick your own color.

[/quote]

I used the turnigy lipos with the higher C rating on my first build. They worked really well at a good price.

FYI I run the Torqureboards VESC, 6374 190KV motor, Nano remote and pulley kit which I LOVE!

Do you use this to power one motor or two?   I'm looking at the Torq VESC, 6355 190KV.

What kind of distance, speed do you get?

Unfortunately the answer to speed and distance has a bunch of variables because theoretically with the 6374 if you ran 107mm wheels with a 60c battery you could hit close to 40mph. NOW for most people who maybe have a 10s 20 to 30c battery and 90mm wheels for example your top speed will be around 26mph. If you run 97mm wheels you top speed will be close to 28 to 29mph. As for distance if you ran on flat ground with your 2 5s lipos in series, you'll go about 10 miles on a charge. 

If you do go with lipos I would advise not running it below 20% of its charge so it will last longer.

I would say go with the caliber II 50 to start. They are a really good truck for $30. Your 50's are going to give you a better turn radius also.

@achatham cool. thanks for the response.  For this build I'm not really looking for speed per se.  18mph is plenty.

Lots of good responses already few other things, here's the best distance calcutor I've seen so far http://calc.esk8.today

If you don't have it already would also look at a soldering iron of some sort (higher price ones typically get to temp quicker and or maintain temp better), you'll also want to scoop up some 12 AWG or even 10AWG stranded silicone wire and XT90 connectors (probably worth just getting a box for practice ones and replacements plus will need a couple to wire things how you want in the first place).  Speaking of the XT-90 also search "loop key" here for some threads on how to make those.  Personally prefer loop key for robustness and simplicity over a switch and BMS (I just use a couple balance chargers to charge two 5S separately and join then in series on the board).  Only other big thing you're missing here is some head protection and if you plan to ride at night ever some sort of light and or retroreflective stuff.  Believe @Deckoz has a thorough thread on safety gear (on that note also some good threads on general riding and foot braking, look those up if not familiar)

I agree with @wafflejock start off with an anti spark loop key (YouTube has some good videos on this) and then go to the whole bms and power switch setup. Itâ€™s WAY simpler!

Get the calibers II 50s in matte black and Boa 90mm hatchling wheels, @torqueboards has a pulley kit fit it, @jlabs has another kit also.

Vesc wise fit with enertion focboxes. 

Everything else is sorted out :sunglasses:

Hello! im going to build a board but i need some help.. 

2st APS 5070HEV Outrunner brushless motor 270KV 2200W
https://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/aps-5070hev-outrunner-brushless-motor-270kv-2200w/

Is two motors to overkill for my purpose? if i have two motors should i have more kv to get more speed?

on the pulley im thining of a 15mm belt and 15t on the motor and 37t on the wheel.
i would like to have a max speed of 55km/h and a good torque for climbing upphill.

On the ESC i have no idea.. i have been googled and this is driving me nuts.. is this the right one? 
https://www.ebay.com/itm/Dual-motors-longboard-skateboard-control-modula-ESC-Substitute-with-remote/323326552273?hash=item4b47c3a8d1:m:mxSlsLM_-dEIr0XuDFII9Lg&var=512391639581

On the battery im thinking of something like this

Thank you! / Confused

I'm guessing you are going for a 10s1p battery.  If that is the case are are going to want a lower kv like around 190-200 kv.  As for esc/vesc dont go with that piece of crap that will probably blow out the first time your throttle it.  I'm guess you are in the UK/EU

something like this for the motors

https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/moteur-skateboard-electrique-polaris-sensored-6355-190kv/

For a vesc go with maytech or flipsky.

Here is a website I am working on.  It will let you easily explore many esk8 vendors without remembering or writing down a ton of URLs.

http://www.esk8nexus.com/

its not finished so don't be alarmed by all the 404 pages.

Thank you briman for your answer! Yes i live in  EU, sweden ðŸ˜… okej why would i like to get an lower kv? I would lik to have a topspeed for like 55/km/h and still lots of torque on low rpm. The esc i choose because i think its easyer to connect, its all in one. But i can go for another one :) i dont know about the battery, how big do you think i need? If you would build this, what parts would you buy? Thank you again!

I would go a lower kv because the current setup would go over the erpm and would blow the esc.

If I was building this I would go with the one of the several vesc6 versions. With 6374 190kv maytech motors with 200mm surfrodz or trucks equals to them and a 12s4p of 30q batteries. That is just me but with those quality parts it would be a lot more reliable. Adjusting your wheel size and pulls sizes you can get a 40 mph.
