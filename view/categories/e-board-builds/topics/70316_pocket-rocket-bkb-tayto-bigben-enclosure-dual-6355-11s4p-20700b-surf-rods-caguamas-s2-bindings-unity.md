Click bait ahahaha
This is not done yet,  I'm looking for advice from Esk8 wisdom.

I would like to build a somewhat portable board, hence @JLabs Tayto. Don't need huge wheels that's why 77A Caguamas. Would also like high gearing for more torque and not top speed, around 15|40.

Now come all the questions: 
Anybody knows if 11S4P is possible in SS enclosure?
Would like it to be nimble and responsive. Tayto kicktail plus shorter trucks should be perfect. So what to get that fits 6355 and 15mm belts? Surfrodz 176, CRonins, E Caliber? Or commission narrower hanger than 230 from @3DServisas @Kug3lis?
If choosing SR, is adjustable baseplate worth it @Sender ?
RKP or TKP ? 
For any trucks, I'll go with @Alphamail bushings as his quality is great. Maybe even tunnel risers also  
 Would like no fuss mounts that stay put, so cross bar preferred. For that @marcmt88 or @okp mounts. Would love a gear drive but the smaller wheels I think @Kug3lis makes for are 107. Are crossbars only aesthetics?
Considering the space between motor mounts and enclosure, @Eboosted recommends TB Mounts that are 113mm in lenght. So if I don't need crossbars, I might go with enertion clone mounts, unless there is a better short mount option. I don't really want reverse mounts
Idk if @psychotiller mounts are short enough they would fit 
 Inspired by @whitepony Spud build, I'm adding Freeboard S2 bindings.    
For esc idk yet. As this will be very long build, Unity might get in stock, flipsky might improve their 6.6, Aurimas might have his 180A esc. We'll see

Sorry for a long post, here is a ðŸ¥”

On a normal build like this, I would steer against adjustable baseplates.  Just not worth it in this scenario.  Also, I would go with TKPs on a smsller board like this

Im super happy with my tkp SR trucks and tiller mounts. Great ride on a 31inch deck. Ill be moving up to 63xx motors soon. Small adjustments and i was able to fit 6368 and even my 6374 (with wider wheelbase of course)

My current wheel base is 12 inches with 5055 motors, 12mm belts now but its set up for 15mm just waiting on some to get here.

Tillers mounts fit tight.  Spot on fitment.  And his mounts are thick. No real need for cross bar when mount is shorter and thick.
Im completely new to this and his mounts have been a breeze to keep lined up and adjust as needed.

Iâ€™m using the spud with 177mm tkp, @psychotiller mount, 50mm axles, freebord bindings, kegels, and single 6355. As @Sender said, the board is super nimble, yet I can still take it up to 27mph without worrying about speed wobbles. Iâ€™m using riptide magnum/canon krank 90a both front and back.

You might be able get by with 60mm but itâ€™s gonna be really tight. Go with with 70mm and stick one of the 5mm spacers on the outside of the wheel.

11s4p is definitely not possible, if you want to run such a big battery you better get the DS enclosure, but if you do that then you will no longer have a light board.

My spud has 10s3p and on 15/36T it's surprisingly torquey on 85mm Caguamas, i. Also tested the 15/40T but it's really lame and lack of fun, not much increase in torque at all. So choose your pullies wisely

Iâ€™d second 15/36. 

One thing I learned about @psychotiller mounts, if you take a file and remove the powdercoat from the middle of the motor mount, you can fit a regular 8mm skate bearing inside. That give your motor shaft some extra support and the tension is perfect for 15/36 with a 275mm belt.

Thanks to kind souls from this forum, I got a secret Santa gift also and it happens to be Surfrodz with PT mounts :scream:
Now what about adding Breakboard truck to the back and  having drive train in the front?

For me is more natural to brake with the heel than toes. And tkp in front should be more nimble than back
