hey guy's I'm really addicted to this ~~hobby~~ it's sorta taken over gaming and I'm already moving onto my next build. I kinda feel like it's full circle because I was introduced to esk8 with Boosted and now am building a DIY Boosted Board aka The Fuusted Board. I still have some choices for trucks I'm trying to iron out and was hoping you guys could weigh in on it thanks.

**Deck:** No DIY Boosted Board could be done without the Vanguard and for me, I'm going to be using the Flex 2 42" variant only because I'm receiving it in a trade otherwise would've gone for the Flex 3 38".

**Trucks:** As for trucks here is where it gets a bit complicated. I'm receiving the board as a complete with Paris Trucks, however, I don't think that Paris Trucks are the best for esk8. I am also receiving Surfrodz TKP as well, so I wasn't entirely sure which one I wanted to use Paris Trucks, Surfrodz or Calibers, as I want to be able to put the belt cover thingy Boosted has a haven't seen it done on Surfrodz.

[poll type=regular]
* Paris Trucks
* Surfrodz TKP
* Caliber Trucks
[/poll]

**Motor Mount:** For the motor mount it'd be completely depending on what truck I end up using.

**Wheels:** I'd be using the Kegel wheel as I'll also be receiving that in the trade with the plan down the line to upgrade to the Caguama or Boa

**Enclosure:** I don't think I would choose anything other than a @Eboosted enclosure as this guy is the only one I've seen so far that really turns me on :grinning:

**Battery:** I'll be working with @psychotiller on a 10s4p 30q when I end up receiving the enclosure

**ESC:** Here I ran into a dilemma I want to either go dual FOCBOX again or dual ESCAPE only thing that is turning me off from ESCAPE is the price but it looks so nice <3

**Motors:** Can't go wrong with dual maytech sensored 6355's 

**Remote:** I'll be using my trusty steed GT2B ChoZen Remote from @MasterCho

lol And here I was thinking my first build would be my last because it would check all the boxes but now I'm thinking of how naive that was haha though my wallet is telling me to stop for my sake :laughing: definitely an addiction I think. send help

For what kind of build? I feel like the real glory in adjustable is being able to put them on things like a Lacroix or other mountainboard deck. If not using the extremes of the adjustability, it does not seem worth the price.  On a standard board, their normal base plate angles are where you will probably land anyway..... just a thought.

Also, have you talked to them? They prpducing more of the adjustable RKPs?  I was a little concerned when they pulled them from the site a while ago.

Sorry to derail. Whoops.


USE THE TKPS @chris.hunt!!ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

@Sender  Hummie deck for now.
But I'm already thinking of second build before my first (diy) is done. I feel like investing into a solid pair of trucks that I could use on any board is worth it. I could always go back to my caliber trucks on the hummie deck if I found a board that was more Suited to the rkp trucks.
I've emailed them twice with no reply.
I'm tempted to get a pair of TKP for my shortboard/riptide rebuild tho.

@chris.hunt, i think you will be stoked on the larger deck. I have the flex 2 42" variant and can't believe how fun it is to carve on. It's my main go to when i go on dog runs. I've been using that deck since 2008. Really stable feeling and an absolute joy to ride. You'll love this build guaranteed. Of the 3 trucks, you can't go wrong with SR.

I'd choose Surfrodz RKP 176mm for a cooler looking board, the 200mm RKP are nice but they will make your board look too wide and big, however if you want a crazy powerful board I'll go with them with a dual 6374 motors on Psychotiller press on mounts.

You will have something like this shreding machine:

On the 42" Vanguard I'd suggestyou get the 12S enclosure, it's looks amazing in the longer deck and you can mount a 12s4p battery for insane torque and acceleration.

Looks to me like thereâ€™s room for 2 more cells if you use a smaller bms. 

The bestech HCX-D503:

im not sure if its the same bms, but i saw this video a few weeks back i think this guy used 2 of these tiny bms to make 2 battery packs for his 4wd build...i definitely wouldnt use his board but as far as seeing if these bms's work...maybe that guy has input or you cn find some info in a video of his

Chris, Im actually about to publish a video of youtube of my recent diy boosted build. I went the way of caliber II 10" trucks, 85mm Caguama wheels, TB 6374 motor, TB vesc, and 10s4p battery and custom enclosure from @eboosted.  Love the 25miles on a single charge!

ITS AMAZING!

![10s5pmaybe|375x500](upload://Q4QWMOWNDXCLyZQSoczRYogv3O.jpg)

so I took the picture of Alan's 12s4p inside his vanguard enclosure then drew my idea of making it a 10s5p

what are your thoughts? @Eboosted @Colson003 @b264 @abenny @psychotiller

if you still have one of these on hand like this could you place those extra 2 cells in and give me a measurement of the space left?

cheers much appreciated for any feedback

@Eboosted 
 I'm pretty sure I can get the 10s5p in there. It's only 2 more cells. I can see the space for those in the picture.

Also, the 10s bms has a smaller footprint.
