This project started innocently enough with a simple attempt to upgrade the battery on my Evolve GTX. But after lots of feedback from the forum, I ended up replacing almost everything except the Supercarve trucks and ABEC 11 wheels. I didn‚Äôt want to take a lot of risks with the design, because my main interest is in actually riding the board. So I looked at similar solutions here on the forum and reached out to various people for proven components.

![main_board|690x329](upload://x4tQixUE0UIyb3KcBhkmYcKZFiC.jpeg) 

This Halloween I dressed up as Hellboy, and since I was designing this board around the same time, that name seemed to stick. My goal for the board was to capture sleek California style with stripped down simplicity. This board is designed for power carving residential streets with plenty of torque for climbing hills and quick acceleration. The color scheme is banner red and flat black with yellow accents.

![hellboy|690x460](upload://j0TcAlsH3HsJ2A6ekDKgocDq1VL.jpeg) 

The enclosure from Eboosted was wonderful to work with. Super tough but easy to drill and sand when needed. The enclosure was designed to fit the Sector 9 BinTang, but I liked it even better on BinTang‚Äôs big brother, the Sector 9 Meridian. The generous 40-inch deck size makes sense for an electric board. I am about 6‚Äô 2‚Äù tall, so the larger deck feels right.

Handy Tip: If you rub any of the Sector 9 boards with Acetone everything comes right off, including the decals on the bottom, and the grip tape as well. After some Acetone applied with paper towels the board looked like it was fresh from the mill. I didn‚Äôt sand a bit! I suspect this trick will work with many other brands as well.

![IMG_8228|640x480](upload://qpDZA90cgQ8asREjMx31pk9QvqU.jpeg) 

I installed the enclosure with stainless steel rivet nuts. They mount on the deck and extend through to meet the bolts below. This method provides lots of strength for mounting the enclosure vs. inserts. I was careful to drill straight down into the deck, but since the deck has some camber, the rivet nuts made the top uneven. I countersunk the holes, used a Dremel to grind off one side, and Bondo to fill the other side before applying grip tape. 

![deck_camber|690x209](upload://AvEEYPEJlbx2xfeVLrf2yOJQudM.png) 

![grip_tape|690x460](upload://vJrtRSAxQHPcGcGTLPNRQ6xJtgW.jpeg) 

As you can see, I am charging the 12S4P battery with an external charger. I don‚Äôt like all the wires and complication of an on-board BMS. This way, I can manage the battery and see all 12 cell voltages while charging. I plan to build a mountain board someday with a similar setup, so the Chargery C4012B seemed like a good investment. This charger has worked very nicely for the intended purpose. I like the simplicity of the built-in 1500-watt power supply. 

![battery_connection|690x276](upload://9s3ZDQM81zN0baj1hJ2E9t86WRS.jpeg) 

The flexible 12S4P battery was built by Roby over at Pelican Bay Innovations. He showed me how to connect the 12S external charger and also helped with many other aspects of the project. There are 48 Samsung 30Q 18650 cells on board, so we have maybe 50 volts and a capacity of 12 Ah. This battery definitely addresses the limitations of my original Evolve GTX.

![12s_charger|690x257](upload://qjMkgKLNN0RRhqHNOpikgHpHQuH.jpeg) 

Handy Tip: The Chargery C4012B supports many different battery types. The first type listed is LiPoAHv. Select this type if you are charging Li-Ion as well. Also, you will need to enter the total capacity of your battery pack into the settings menu. For example, in my case that was 12 Ah. Otherwise you may get an ‚Äúover capacity‚Äù alert while charging.

![IMG_8485|375x500](upload://osCnVcF9mOVkwSbYFeDpjqTjKme.jpeg) 

![IMG_8447|640x480](upload://tpzBPeU4v9mmThjeG7Y145TFs0Y.jpeg) 

I 3D printed a magnetic snap-on cover for the external charging cables. This protects them from dust and debris to some extent. There is also a foam rubber baffle glued into the enclosure. The foam presses the cables against the bottom of the deck and provides some water ingress protection. I might do more waterproofing later, but hey, it‚Äôs California.

![IMG_8482|500x500](upload://cfmApO0jZI2uWljnvaYIi4wJzT5.jpeg) 

I love the Evolve Trucks, they provide a fluid carve line plus reasonable stability at speed. Mr. Tiller was kind enough to supply the dual 6369 motors, they definitely fit the style of the board. The Unikboard Motor Mounts are just perfect and complete the drive train. The wide 15mm belts look cool and fit the ABEC 107mm and AT wheels from Evolve. I 3D printed the belt covers to protect the pulleys. Let me know if anyone wants that 3D model.

Handy Tip: Upgrading your Supercarve trucks to 63mm motors will require new mounts. Unikboards makes a great one that supports Evolve street and AT wheels. Here are the right 15mm belt sizes for this setup: 15/32T = 280 mm belt, 15/38T = 300 mm belt, and 15/65T = 380 mm belt.

https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/core-serie-support-moteur-pour-truck-evolve-supercarve-street-et-at/

![IMG_8473|375x500](upload://8zIwVnoewnC9NEdefYdj5mONZeZ.jpeg) 

I am starting out with the FOCBOX Unity set up for roll to start and automatic shutoff. This fits the stripped-down style that I am going for, but I might add a power switch and battery meter later on if desired. The Hoyt Puck remote works great with the Unity. The power train and acceleration provide a huge rush of excitement when this board takes off.

![cables|640x451](upload://uQDhG0bBIP2KwnJlq8wRGoLQ3Vc.jpeg) 

Handy Tip: There is an easy way to convert the FOCBOX Unity 3.5mm bullets to the 5.5mm bullets found on many 63mm motors. If you get a 5.5mm and 3.5mm set of bullets, you will find that the wire side of the male 3.5mm bullet can be forced into the wire side of the 5.5mm female bullet. Then just hit them with some solder and you have a converter. Be sure to cover them with heat shrink wrap and electrically isolate them!

For me, the most interesting thing about this project was the people I interacted with here on the forum. I purchased my enclosure from Peru, the motor mounts from France, the motor controller from Australia, the battery from Denver, and the board right next door in Santa Cruz. The ability of individual forum members to build things with 3D printers, CNC machines, and homemade circuit boards has been a real eye opener. We are definitely entering the golden age of electronic skateboards!

The Hoyt Puck is really nice. You forget you have it in your hand very quickly. It hooks right up to the Unity. I am running my Puck on Mode One (slowest) due to the ferocious response of the 200kv motors + Unity and the 124P battery. 

I liked the Evolve remote however. The problem I had with Evolve is that very little of their parts are standard and interoperable. So I really couldn't use many pieces. In my case, I sold my GTX, it was in good shape, and just bought new Supercarves.

But the unity has a power switch? Are you just going to rely on push to start and auto shut off for now?

You could just use a Bluetooth app to monitor your battery level and not worry about an external battery meter. :+1::+1:

Enjoy those 200KV  power-plants. They are beasts!

Awesome build - looks like you‚Äôve gone with what you consider to be the very best option for each component. No short cuts, no skimping. I bet you‚Äôll be very happy with it as a result. As a GTX owner, I can say no doubt the GTX is fun to cruise on, but the Hellboy is what an evolve _could_ be.

I started down the path of no compromises, but nearing the end now and have skimped on motors and bms due to budget constraints... hopefully I don‚Äôt regret it!

Hey Bill, I‚Äôm wondering about whether to add a loop key to my build or just rely on the unity‚Äôs switch.

Personally I don‚Äôt like the look of the loop key, don‚Äôt really have space, and would rather not hack up my enclosure.

It looks like you are relying on the e-switch. What‚Äôs your thoughts on that? Did you consider a loop key?

The Hoyt Puck works well with roll to start. When you turn on the Puck, it beeps because it is not connected. Then you push off the board, and the beeping stops when the connection is made. Very slick.

The Puck is very friendly and can be tucked in a pocket. This is different than (say) my Evolve remote which had a carrying case. Some other remotes are not strong enough that I would pocket them. A future feature I would like for the Puck would be showing the battery level on the LED circle. 

The biggest problem I had was that the throttle was too low in the first half of the wheel and too high after that. This was corrected with the Power Curve editor on the FOCBOX Unity. That is a great feature I did not see in the interface until I asked support. Still, it was a little confusing until they told me that the remote % was on the X axis and the power output was on the Y axis. Anyway, this made a big difference in the feel of the board.

This is a closed cell neoprene rubber with rebound. Open cell is more foamy and the enclosure will leave a mark. I traced the enclosure and cut the piece out with scissors, then sanded the edges to make it smooth and take the factory shine off. Yes, you can sand rubber. Ended up making the holes with a Dremel. I tried to use rubber cement to glue it down, but rubber cement started to mar the paint, so I ended up using epoxy.

could also go with a heavy sheet for more padding, rise and sealing:

Thanks for the kind words and welcome to the forum!

If you build it yourself you can get exactly what you want. I have been riding every day and the board turned out great. The main adjustment so far has been lowering the battery output from 60 to 50 watts, which helped tame this little monster.

Had some questions about the cable cover. That was 3D printed and has a magnetic snap down to the enclosure. There is a magnet inside the enclosure and in the cable cover. This provides some protection from dust and water. Charging is really easy, just snap off the cover and hook up three cables for the external BMS.

Very nice build!!..im building something similar i had a GTX with 200kv motors & 10SP4 that I lost in the central canal river after bailing off Smh. The performance was great but was always skeptical about electronics. My build a LY deck, Evolve supercarve trucks with stock mounts, Unity, 10sp5 by Tiller! I really like those 63mm motors your running and they look sweet!..but I still have 2 pairs of the racestar 200kv lying around that i had extra for my gtx & im thinking of using those. Couple question?..What size rivit nuts did you use on your deck? Also have you heard of anyone hooking up racestars to a unity? Is it worth the try or should i hold off on 63mm motors? Racestar 200kv put off 1800 watts each compared to 3200 on yours if im correct. Ill be riding street setup only. You seem to know your stuff any input would be much appreciated,  thx!

Thanks RadCat! Those deck bolts are from the Evolve hardware kit spare parts. Here is the strange part ‚Äî a 3mm key seems too small, a 3.5mm key is definitely too big, but a 1/8 inch key fits perfectly. This makes no sense, they should be metric.

Oops, you were asking about the rivet nuts. Link provided below....

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G9CXPDZ?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share

I love my 6369 motors. They run almost silent and stay very cool. Get them if you can. The Unikboard mounts are perfect. I have a 12s4p setup and that works great. My new addition is the Maytech R2 style remote. This is a perfect upgrade for the Evolve. Bigger trigger pull, LED screen, waterproof.

This new Maytech Remote is the last addition to the Hellboy build. I liked the Evolve remote, but it was rather proprietary, and could not be used with FOCBOX Unity and a custom 12S4P battery. The Maytech works great with Unity, and has a big solid feel compared to the similar Evolve R2. The trigger works well with gloves, and the separate brake prevents accidents. 

One thing to be aware of is that you need to pull BOTH the trigger and brake buttons during the Unity calibration process. The trigger calibrates the + side and the brake the - side of the range. 

Since the Maytech has a battery meter it provides the last feature that I wanted. I don't have to cut up the deck. This preserves the clean appearance of the board.

Push to start works great, be aware that you need to push and then let the trigger go to zero. Squeeze a few times and the battery indicator will light up letting you know that the board is on. I think this is a safety feature of push to start. The Unity doesn't let you start with positive throttle.

This remote is very smooth and has a lot of travel in both the trigger and the brake. I seldom go above 50% on the trigger unless climbing intense hills. But there is still plenty of room. I have found myself riding faster and with more confidence with this remote. It is also waterproof and has a wireless charger.

Hey. I'm looking at this remote, how did you wire up the maytech remote to read battery. Any pics/advice would be great. I've seen someone go straight to the battery but then sure the proper way would be to only read voltage when vesc is turned on rather than a constant live feed...

Otherwise not sure :)

Looking at building something very similar to this, currently deciding what to do with motors, if I go with the standard evolve motors, I can use the pulleys and belts from evolve. I am wanting to be able to use a bigger motor, but struggling to find a motor pulley that will work with evolves gt3 tooth profile.
Did you use HTD profile pulleys? If so is that working out well, if not where did you find the pulleys?
Cheers

Whatever you do, the motors and pulleys and mounts and belt size has to work together. OK that is a stupid and obvious thing to say. You have to plan it out. If all you want is the evolve motors why build? The new GTR looks fine.
