Lucky kid! Be patient and take your time with the build,esk8ing is dangerous and your parents obviously trust you enough to let you build one so don't let them down...do plenty of research,the forum is a gold mine of knowledge.
Happy birthday and welcome to the forum kid!
@longhairedboy watch out! You got some competition in the making! 😉

😂 most of our builds are funded by extensive saving or santa

I’m newly 14 and rocking 10s6p with an upgraded vesc, psychotiller enclosure, psychotiller mount, and very soon, an arbor vugenhausen

only thing my mom paid for was my 2nd GT2B. Let’s just say I mowed about 6 lawns per week and worked my first day at kroger on my birthday 😉

I'd take the tape off. In our motors it is best to keep the magnets cool and not the windings. Sure the windings have a limit before the insulation is destroyed, but for the most part, our concern is with the magnets demagnetizing. The outer can cools them :)

put the other connector together, see if they still fit. if they do, you’re in luck.  the nylon housing is just a bit burnt.  be careful when your soldering though.

melt it?

your supposed to tin those beforehand, like you were doing.  just leave your soldering iron on it for a good long time until it becomes totally liquid. stick the wire in, heat the wire until the solder on the wire and in the pin turn liquid, remove soldering iron.

I found for me it's easier to have something like a vise hold the connector then put a clean wire in the back of the clean plug heat them up together and then add the solder flux does help but I always use rosin core solder.

Don't. Keep trying, you'll learn nothing from buying one. Use a longer wires. Also make sure your iron is hot enough. By the looks of it, it isn't. I suggest investing in a good iron around 60W. 

Let me know if you need any help.

## \#79 Posted by: wafflejock Posted at: 2018-01-28T03:57:20.374Z Reads: 250

```
Make sure you "pre-tin" the xt-90 before you try connecting the wires to it.  Just hold the soldering iron inside the xt-90s metal part for say 10-20 seconds then start dipping some solder down into there (assuming solder with flux otherwise put a dab of the flux in there before trying to stick the solder to the connector).  If both the connector and the wire have a good glob of solder on there then it's a lot easier to get both globs to go molten and fuse together, if you don't pre-tin both things this is much harder.

One more thing, use a chisel tip when soldering thing wires. It transfers a lot more heat. ![17510-B52_PT02|560x400](upload://5JcL9QEgDKfMoUZ4B0q4Ry3XK7w.jpg)

lots of people have their pet methods and there's all these details but for me all that decides if it happens or not is lead solder.  no flux or rosin.  no fancy iron or tips.  my iron looks like a piece of crap and I never tin it and the tip is all messed up looking but it doesn't matter.  try it.  you can get it at most places.

or lately with plugs i'll pool some solder in it with a butane lighter/torch and then just stick the wire in.  fast easy and works

Keep trying, if anything jump on YouTube real quick to get a visual idea of what to do when soldering.  Because sooner or later it's going to be solder this or that and you can't buy everything from the store.

Have you looked at some videos on Youtube ? There are a few tutorial videos for soldering wires to XT90 plugs. It really helps when you don't really know what you're doing.

It's no rocket science soldering wires to a XT60 or XT90 connector. All you need is a minimum 80W better 100-150 W iron. Btw. I didn't use flux. Just make sure that the wire is soaked with solder from the outside and inside!  This takes a bit of practice. Then apply solder to the XT90 terminals. What also worked for me is coating the iron tip with fresh solder then heat up the wire or connector terminal, then apply more solder once all parts are decently hot. This enables better thermal flow from the tip to the actual part. Final step, press solder coated wire on solder coated terminal and apply heat with iron tip. Maybe add some more solder.

Cheers

I have recently soldered lots of xt-60 connectors, the iron I have is a cheap $20 one from Bunnings it came with a few little tools and solder as well. All you need to do is heat up the iron and melt a little bit of solder onto the tip, now but the iron into the little cup that the wire sits in and get a nice blob of solder in there, now get your wire out and put a blob of solder on that too. Now you can put the connector into some sort of little stand (vice, or other holder) and get you wire and place it inside the cup too. You can hold the wire to the connector where you are solder with pliers so you don't burn your fingers on the hot wire, the solder will start to become molten and the melt together

TIP: when soldering a female connector, put a male connector inside it so the pins don't misalign(happens with cheap connectors) and vise versa

Ive soldered with shitty 10 dollar amazon irons and they worked fine, plug in the xt90 to another one first, then place the wire in the cup without solder, don't tin anything, and then add heat and solder to the entire thing. MAKE SURE THE SOLDER STICKS and you heat it up enough. The solder should stick to to the wire and the cup, if it doesn't stick, keep the iron on until it does, or else you're going to end up with a cold joint.

Make sure the solder seeps into the wire and sticks onto the cup, pull the connection after it cools if you're not sure you made a good joint
And make sure the that joint melts the solder, not the actual iron, I put the solder on the iron just for better heat transfer in the beginning

Great work! My best advice is get a full face helmet, gloves, knee pads, elbow pads, and wrist guards. It may seem overkill, but if you crash you will be thankful you have it. I had everything except the gloves with my first crash (26 mph) and I HIGHLY regretted it!

Also, when riding, pretend every car on the road is trying to kill you. Don't let them. It's also good to assume other vehicles don't see you. Be especially careful of car doors opening, cars turning right, literally every intersection, etc. 

Also, BEWARE OF SPEEDWOBBLE. That is what caused the crash mentioned eariler... not fun... look at beginner downhill longboard setups and try to match those for a nice stable ride! 

Don't let this scare you at all! This is an awesome hobby, full of the most exhilarating feelings you can experience! Have fun, be safe!

Well on the contrary, you can save some little money on your enclosure
Pretty much everything will do the job, it doesn't need to be super sturdy, you can be less cautious with it than other components : it's really only a piece of plastic to protect the electronics (not hold them ! but that's another debate :wink: )
I used a flat flower pot on my first build and it was more than okay ! just drill some holes and tada !
Some make them out of wood, but not just big square box, you can manage to do more delicate form !

it's really the thing where you can experiment the enclosure, no need to spend 50 bucks on it, except if you want a very nice looking one, like the one from eboosted
