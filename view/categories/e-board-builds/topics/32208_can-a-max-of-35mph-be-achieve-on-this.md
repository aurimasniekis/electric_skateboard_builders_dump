Hey guys. Reallly curious if you can get a 35mph on a single drive?

6374 r spec
10s3p
Focbox
16/36 gear
90m

What will be the optimal vesc settings to maybe try to reach 35mph?

you won't make it with that setup, 32-33 max

I agree with Jinra, 35km/h perhaps but not mph. However with that said if you go down hill :) fastest I hit on my single drive was 88km/h :)

Don't forget to take in to account stopping distance/rate and many other caveats to high speed breaking in single drive

Step up to 200-230kv or 12s @ 190kv

I was able to get 33 mph with
dual Carvon V2 145kv ( 1:1 gear ratio)
12s voltage
My weight at the time 185lbs

I have not been able to go over 28mph with any of my belt drive setups.

```
same kv same V. same speed.
you could get there with:
 230kv motor.
or
12s battery. 
or
20/36 gearing.

I weigh 215lbs I'm running 9s, a single 190kv 6374, 16:32, 90mm wheels. I'd say it's DEFINITELY possible. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/7/97aa30a978802acf535b2891736f7d0321c859b2.PNG" width="281" height="499">

It's not about weight or efficiency. You literally can't reach 35mph given that the theoretical max of the setup is 36mph assuming **zero** sag. Since zero sag is impossible, especially on 18650's, he'll never get 35mph in real world riding even on full charge.

Keep in mind you're gearing is quite a bit tighter than his setup as well.

Correction: my gearing is 16:36, sorry typo.  I suppose you're right. If he had a good downhill, and crouched he'd achieve his 35mph goal! ðŸ˜…
