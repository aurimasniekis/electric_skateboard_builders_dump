If i were in your position i would purchase a METR bluetooth module to keep track of performance and batteries and ditch the firefly remote for a cheaper and more reliable remote. Furthermore, great build!

Also, why are your focboxes so expensive? :sweat_smile:

I started this build about a year ago haha it did not exist back then and i also have had bad experience with AIO gear like that. if you blow 1 side you gota replace the cost of 2. at leas this way if i blow 1 i could pull the other out and place it in a new single drive build or sell it off and replace with new ones since they dont make them anymore...

METR b
[/quote]

will be able to keep track of all info with the remote which is ideal. i have issues with my phone using tracking apps as it is so i would rather keep all info tied into the board as cloesly as possible. Im a programmer by trade so i can add/remove/alter features as i see fit easily and i have more faith in someting i build myself and its all part of the fun =)

Though i did initially plan on using the blutooth module to keep track of specific data from the vesc

so i finally got around to ordering the last of the parts. sadly the shipping address i provided for my cells board and sprockets do not allow delivery to a parcel locker so this is going to be a fun battle getting ahold of my goods considering im going to have to get the address changed to my work location and lug everythign home by foot. this includes my trampa board coming monday which should have been delivered today. yay UPS for dicken me around. 


well any ways rant over. Im going to be adding some break lights to my board with a small Neopixel stick with 8 individually controllable LEDS on it. the plan is to make it more street legal by adding break lights and even possibly indicators to the LED strip itself if it is powerful enough to even work during the day that is. well ill be testing it when i get it in and if its bright enough ill be adding it to my build since im constructing my own Firefly remote it wont be difficult to add in the functionality to control the Break lights from the throttle input.

Finally got the board in and assembled. Since moving to an apartment I regret not having access to the lot of tools my father has I take such simple things for granted. But hard work pays off with a bit of luck. Speaking of luck I just had the right sized spanners left over from my 3d printers and bits of furniture over the years I did a quick test fit and I'm now unsure if the underside enclosure will work with this board this feels more like a low rider when I jumped on it compared to my wowgo setup. Pressure in tyres is about 60 psi. About as much as I could get out of this little pump so the first thing I'll do is head to a servo to get it to about 65-75 psi when it's done. I just picked up some headlights and a tail light but I'm thinking ill scrap the tail light since I have an LED strip coming in this week I plan on programming into my remote to trigger as brakes. 

Here is an image of oone of these lights. I forgot to grab some batteries but they take 4x AAA. I usually just buy the coles home brand rechargeable packs 4x $7 I believe it is and I'll just carry spares with me as the lights slide off pretty easily. Picked them up for $10 each from target and they are surprisingly bright.

Sadly the 2 stands I picked up the other day only works for one of my boards so I'll have one for sale for $13 aud if anyone wants it since it doesn't fit the Trampa deck the latches get in the way and it's top side heavy, oh well guess I can keep one off the floor![IMG_20190716_205716|666x499](upload://q8N030UMiiuFMeWzWFTA8kvC2Tl.jpeg)

So i may have made a mistake or 2 along the way but i think ill get there in the end. MY enclosure should be here by the end of the week and so should the sprockers. 

Sprockers landed in melbourne today and should be delivering inner state over night so i should see them thursday at work some time hopefulyl friday at the latest. For my enclosure i might see that Friday or monday as its aparently 2 day international shipping but we will see what happens once i get those 2 parts in i can start doing some tests and see if the 6.5" wheels will cut it if not i guess i call myself lucky as i ordered 4 8" tyres from MBS this morning so hopefully one configuration will work and i can go with a bottom mound with some good clearance. otherwise ill be scrapping the undermount enclosure and going for a top mount which i dont really want to do but will if i have to.

Looking at getting back what I paid for it roughly, would also swap for a new peli case 1200 with cash my way

Since I blew one of my foc boxes during a test I had to buy a new one so I decided to get a flipsky duel 6.6 but its much larger than I thought and I won't fit everything I want in this case which is a lot more than I should want to fit haha

![gm|281x500](upload://32J1Tn0iSiAR3N0b9ctmUldLVcX.jpeg) can take it for $270 if you like this is what I paid for it. Comes with the bolts also which were extra so was close to 290 aud
