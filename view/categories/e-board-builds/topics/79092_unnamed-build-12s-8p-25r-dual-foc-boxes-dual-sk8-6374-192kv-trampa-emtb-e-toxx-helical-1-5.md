So I have had this board finished for a few months now and never got around to doing a build thread. However due to the persistence of @venom121212, here it is. 
I began building this board after my trampa street carver caught fire while on a vacation. I intended on it having all the power in the world and endless range. Being that this was my fourth build, I figured I should have this all figured out. 

The battery is top mounted to give me better ground clearance. This was a decision I went back and fourth on quite a few times and I am ultimately very happy with my decision. I can take this thing offroad without issues but also co up and down the sloped curbs in residential areas without scraping. I used 25r cells for this board with NESE modules to connect them. I got them from a school project so to save the cost I used them. THE CELLS ARE TERRIBLE!! I went for a ride yesterday where it was 46F. I went for 5.9 miles on a mostly flat, completely concrete path and used up over 50% of my battery. I was expecting to be in the high 20's or low 30's for range...not 11 miles. The voltage sag is so bad that the last 30% of the battery is useless. 

The ride on this board is sooooo buttery smooth. It is unlike and other board on the market. The flex of the deck is what really sets it apart from other mountain boards. The board tops out at 33mph and it is really comfortable at that speed. The drives from @Nowind are a thing of beauty and I highly recommend them. The motors I have had some trouble with. I started with 6374 motors from TB that only had about 100 miles on them but after only 50 on this board, I had loose magnets. I purchased the sk8 motors cause they were cheaper than the tb motors. However when I got the new motors, one had a DOA sensor on it. Then the other one started throwing temp faults, so I am now running sensorless. 

I added a big headlight, taillights and underglow to really make this board standout. They all have their own switches on the box so they can be enabled individually. 

Any questions or comments?

Yes I do. It‚Äôs because they are rated for 80a and Tb are rated for 60

I've only just finished mine myself =)

At least you have the nese modules so maybe eventually you can switch out those 25r for 30qs when you have the funds. I think i talked to you in an earlier thread about voltage sag bc i have a 12s8p too. Just got 30q in and theyre great. Also ive heard the sk8 get pretty warm and throw temps sensor bc they are enclosed and have no airflow....im struggling with motors as well. Love the blue color scheme and lights.

Glad I annoyed you enough to make this thread! What size is that plug for your main cable braid? Also feel free to link said cable braid and or plug. Or headlights.

... Or anything else you want to :thinking:

I've run all my TB motors at 80a+ never even heats up even on grass.  

Nice build btw those NESE modules work out really well for that type of battery lay out

What's the name of the crimp terminal you used? Just to be clear I mean sensor wires not phase. Trying to find that terminal name is eluding me.
Its the 6 wire that unity uses if that helps.

Nice tidy build that!  Saw a sneak preview on the top mount thread.  
One thing though is that 3/4 gland the metal one?  I had two of those things on a build and one of the phase bundles had worn through almost to the cores due to vibration.  I use only the plastic ones now with a lot of protection. Just a heads up my friend not a criticism.
