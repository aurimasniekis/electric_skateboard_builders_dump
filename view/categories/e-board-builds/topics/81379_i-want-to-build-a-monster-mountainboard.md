Hi guys! I want to share some thought about a build i'm thinking of doing.

I live in Sweden where we have a lot of snow in the winter and many steep hills with bad roads in the summer. That's why I want to build a four wheel drive mountainboard that can give me good grip on the snowy roads in the winter.

This is the parts I want in my build:

1x Trampa mountainboard - 500‚Ç¨
2x Enertion Unity VESC - 450‚Ç¨
2x DIYElectricSkateboard Trampa motor mount - 450‚Ç¨
4x DIYElectricSkateboard 6374 190kV motors - 450‚Ç¨
1x 12S5P Battery pack (18650 Li-Ion Samsung 30Q) - 240‚Ç¨ with nickel strips
1x Battery case (generic) - ‚âà 50‚Ç¨
1x Simple Controller - 40‚Ç¨

TOTAL: 2180‚Ç¨ / 2480$ / 22400kr (+ shipping, taxes, cables, connections and other ‚âà 2300‚Ç¨)

What do you guys think of this setup? It's a bit expensive I admit but if i'm gonna upgrade from my current longboard I want something really special and kind of extreme :smiley:

Any kind of help is appreciated! :slight_smile: 

/Rob

Why not getting motors from eu sellers so you don't have to pay import taxes.. Streetwing, eskating.eu, electricboardsolutions, lazyrolling (will probably start selling motors soon), bioboards (will sell motors i believe)

I think a lot of things already have been told.
If you in Eu you can save a lot of import taxes if you order from Eu vendors.
I personally wouldn‚Äôt go below 9‚Äú if you build a Quad.
Your battery pack seems a bit small for such a setup.
Which trampa mounts you exactly plan to buy?
Could you link it?
Do you plan to go belts or chains?
Maybe gear drive is an option?
I also wouldn‚Äôt go so high in kV.
150-170kV seems to be a good range.
Have a look on the unik site. They Eu and have great sealed 6374 motors and a great fast customer service by @okp üòâ
They are a bit more expensive than the tb motors but if you add your import tax (how much is it in Sweden?) I think it‚Äôs not so much a big difference anymore.

PS: the price you calculate is definitely not much for a quad üòú and be aware that your board is going to get heavy. 20-25kg will be probably likely.


Edit: you life in a dark country, think about a good light system too. Helps a lot!

This :arrow_up: :arrow_up:
For example: in Austria, you pay a hella of a lot taxes..
For example: I ordered 10Pcbs and a bunch of small parts for 50$ and paid 28$ taxes... :slight_smile:

A 12S5P with 30Q cells will have huge voltage sag with all that power.
Either go for a 12S7P or 8P or better yet go with LiPos

No he can‚Äôt because he plan to get a battery which can output only 100a.
He could also run 4x50xx motors and would get similar performance. 4x 4.12 vesc and save more than half of the money for the two unities too.
25A per vesc...for what there is s need for 6380 motors???

I can definitely change the battery pack and go with the 6380 motors. I want the Unity VESC as they have built in BMS and bluetooth module. Also they can handle a lot of current IF i upgrade the other stuff later on :) I'm running a VESC 4.12 on my single drive "summer"-longboard and I have a problem with heat even after I mounted heatsinks on the mosfets..

I'll probably upgarde to like 8S instead as the 18650 can handle more charge cycles than the LiPo's

The LiPo's are a lot cheeper though. I might just go for 4x 6S LiPo's at like 5000mAh and get 12S2P with 10'000mAh :) Plus a lot higher current output

Just a quick clairification, the focbox Unity does not have a built in bms, it does not do individual cell monitoring nor balancing. What it does do, it can auto-shutoff if left ON, preventing from drainning the battery

Unity has no BMS built in and it's not a VESC. It makes use of the Open Source VESC code and FW but is not compatible with VESC Tool.  Bluetooth modules can be hooked up to any VESC based ESC. On a MTB build you might have to moove the module to a location not blocking your signal to much anyway.

Sounds like you want to use belt drive?
Belts snap when riding in snowy conditions, since snow compacts and fills the gaps of the wheel and motor pulleys. Tension increases.

Only valid drive without too much maintenance is something that is fully enclosed. Found clearance to be an issue with gear drives, so if you have rocks larger than 5 cm make sure you go with a gear drive and wheels that support 9 inch wheels.

I have this battery configuration on a quad and I get 15km out of it. In the winter probably a bit less even. 
Just that you have a number what to expect.

Check out @Idea if you want a more "local" source for belt drive mounts. I think he has some gear drives in the works also, though I'm not sure about eATsk8 applications. He's based in Poland, I think.

And of course, the go to for AT gear drives (and also belt drives): @Nowind / E-Toxx. Plus, the helical drives are deadly quiet, if that's what you're into. He's based in Germany.

Yes, I ment 8P :P But I will probably go for LiPo's instead. Thanks for all your help! I will probably go for 4x VESC 4.12 instead then and install a proper BMS like the one I have on my current board. I used that with LiPo's too in the beginning and that worked just fine. I will check out some kind of chain-drive instead then and consider an even higher capacity LiPo setup. So the list is changed:

1x Trampa mountainboard - 500‚Ç¨
4x VESC 4.12 - 320‚Ç¨
4x Motor mount with chain-drive system - ?$
4x DIYElectricSkateboard 6380 170kV motors - 480‚Ç¨
6x 6S 5000mAh LiPo's in a 12S3P configuration - ?$
1x Battery case (generic) - ‚âà 50‚Ç¨
1x Simple Controller - 40‚Ç¨
1x 12S BMS (just for charging) - 60$
```

I just checked the above listed parts with the http://calc.esk8.it where I see that my top speed will be around 24mph. I'm used to a top speed of around 31mph on my current board. Do you think I will be happy with the 24mph considering the great torque and off-road capabilities? Maybe I should just go for the 190kV motors instead..

(These values are based on the DIYElectricSkateboard Trampa Mount - 12T / 72T and the 200mm trampa wheels)

If you want more speed with that setup I would get bigger motor pulleys so you you belts don't skip, you get a higher top speed, and can keep the bigger motors

9‚Äú is the key üòâ
With 8‚Äú you will not be happy over time. Not with what you plan to build.
Not saying 8‚Äú is bad for emtb, that‚Äôs not right, but if you want that ‚Äûmonster‚Äú you claim 9‚Äú is the minimum

12T / 72T

You still want to go belt drive? 
Belts and snow really not ideal.
Get a 1:5 chain drive and 9‚Äú and you will be faster than you can ever reach.

I will go 9" then! And yes I will go chain drive but I just figured the size of the sprocket would be equal to a 72T pulley. Oh, ofc I should go bigger on the motor and also help the belt from skipping. My other board uses a 16T on the motor.  Thank you all! I could never have thought of all this all by myself :smiley:

No sprockets are different counts. Like 10:40 or 10:50 something like this is what you need.
With 9‚Äú more to 1:5 as i would say. 
55km/h as top speed is pretty good gearing.
As min thats my opinion. Different people different taste.

I would go for 2WD and choose quality components only. The money you save will allow you to do so.
4WD doesn't make the board any better, just heavy and less agile. Two properly geared 6380 motors produce enormous power, more than you can handle in most off-road situations. It's frightening already.... 
I would not go for HW 4.xx based ESCs. The three phase shunt design of the VESC 6 is so much smoother and super linear in power delivery, it makes all the difference in your ride experience. The more power you have, the better control you need! 
Two shunt ESCs tend to "jump" from one power level to another, especially between 60-100% duty cycle. 
On a low torque build this is not so tragic, but on a powerful 4WD, it can be very noticeable and annoying.
Traction control also works a lot better with three phase shunts! 
If you have a bit of patience, you might want to have look at our website in a couple of weeks. 
We have something very delicious available soon, going hand in hand with a brand new software release by Mr. Vedder.

4WD makes it hard to lift the front wheels when you face obstacles like curbs or when you simply want to lift the wheels to get a tight turn. The weight is higher, handling feels less natural, electronics get more complicated, potentially more parts that can fail on you, a lot more expensive, big batteries are required etc. 
If you have a certain budget, I would rather have a proper 2WD than a 4WD with compromises. 
It's all a matter of preference and budget, sure. I don't want to dis-encourage anyone from building a monster.

You either want a Hoplypro or a 35¬∞ Long (might need extra shaping on the tips). 16 or 17 ply for both, depending on the flex you want and your weight. 
4WD is heavy anyway, so you could just use the bullet proof Infinity trucks.
8" or 9" is the next question. 
There are new 9" megastar hubs on the way to us. They should arrive very soon. 
Bindings: ratchet bindings, ideally with heal straps.
