There's a few folks on here building with CF, so has been pretty inspirational.
Hat tip to @whitepony for leading the way ;-)

So have been emailing Roarockit about kits I can send to my Dad in Cape Town, where we're thinking of adding a CF layer within the veneers and/or putting on the roadside... basically want to do some tests with some ideas.

Anyways - if this is something you're keen on trying, this is a really easy to understand tutorial from them:
