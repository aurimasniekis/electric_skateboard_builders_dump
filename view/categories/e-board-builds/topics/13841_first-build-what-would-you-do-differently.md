Sup everyone! 

So, I'm building my first eSk8 board and after stalking the forum for a month or 2 now I wanted to pick ya'lls brain. My questions I'd like to ask is: **With your first build what would you have done differently?**  I've been compiling a list of parts I want to get but, pulling the trigger is the hardest part because it's not cheap and you want to make sure you get the best with your money/budget.  It would really help to get your perspective as to what you would have done differently after building your first esk8 board.  Thanks everyone!

I would have planned less and bought everything at once.

waiting was annoying, especially once I found out what I was missing!

i would have spent more time locating fasteners locally. At the time i knew nothing at all about metric bolts and machine screws, which led me to harass the vendor about replacement bolts. In hindsight i must have seemed like a lunatic. 

but to be fair we really don't have much in the way of a comprehensive hardware store around my area.

my first kit was Enertion's 6S kit. It came with everything but the battery in one delivery, because the battery was held up in customs in Hong Kong due to bird smugglers.

Thanks for the quick response!  Yeah, I feel like I'm planning is taking a long time.  But, like I mentioned the 2 factors that play the biggest roll are budget and getting it right.  So far I've only purchased the board, LOL.

I would have gone for more expensive, higher quality parts. Started out with 2x FVT 120A ESCs, 6S, 83mm flywheels and 230kV motors. Ended up buying 2 VESCs and 2 190kVs as well as a 10S pack anyways. I also bought 90mm flywheels, bought a new set of trucks/bushings/bearings and a new deck.

Basically I replaced every single part, so I guess you could say I've done 2 builds.

For me, the biggest expense was all the tools and other supplies I've needed to get a decent workspace going. That has cost me more than the board itself so really forking out the extra 200-300 bucks to run VESCs and 10S is a no brainer.

I would have done less experimentation (prototyping) and just built with available options.  That being said, Im building some pretty bad ass 3D printed enclosures.

Awesome response, thanks!  With all the work I do on my quads I make such a mess on the dining room table.  I'm putting together a work space in the garage that will be ideal for work on the board and quads.  In my experience it does pay to shell out a little more.  I have the vesc, 190 kv 6372, and (2) Turnigy 5000mah 6s lipos in mind.  What do you use for charging?  I'm thinking of shelling out the cash for a Hobby King 350w power supply and an iCharger 106b+.  But, the price of everything is starting to sting a little.  Just wanted to see where you supplemented cost over quality.  Anyhow, Thank you for your knowledge and sharing your experience!

I think I understand what you mean.  Experimentation can run up the cost as well.  But, I gotta say I really appreciate the problem solving and creativeness of the DIY'ers in this forum.  Some are more plug and play and some are more like you.  I'd love to see and learn how to 3D design and print.  Thanks for the response!

i'm pretty sure i'm into the thousands on just tools alone. That's not counting an x-carve. 

its like crack. You can't stop riding and building once you start and the next thing you know people are staging interventions because of the debt and the fact that you've grown a giant beard alone in your garage.

Going in to this I cut corners for cost wherever possible. Now my philosophy is quality over cost without a doubt. 

That setup is pretty much the ideal single motor build :+1: However I have heard that 12S can be a bit much for the VESC to handle so some people drop it down to 10S.

For charging I bought one of these: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B005LH3392/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

It's pretty overpriced but I wanted amazon prime shipping so I wouldn't have to wait for it to show up from hong kong.

The charger is $21.42 at Amazon the power supply is $15.05 at HobbyKing.  I am running 6S though, you will need a different charger for 10s or 12s.

If you want something reaaallly simple and pretty fun to play around with to get into 3D modeling I'd reccomend [123D Design](http://www.123dapp.com/design). After that you could move up to [Fusion 360](http://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview?utm_campaign=fusion_banner_2&utm_medium=direct&utm_source=blog&utm_content=webpage&utm_term=pathfinder). Both of which are made by the same company that develops AutoCAD.

Starting with those programs has made it much less intimidating than going straight to Soldiworks or AutoCAD. I started messing around with them a couple months ago and soon I'll be 3D printing my enclosures and maybe designing some mounts.

I cut corners with my quad and it was a decent learning experience.  However, after replacement parts and mods, it added up.  So with my DIY board I thought I'd have a different approach, like yourself.  Thanks for the heads up on the 12s vs 10s in regards to the VESC.  The VESC says it can handle 12s but, I forgot to leave some head room.  Also, question about  your charger, can you charge 2 batteries in parallel?  Looks like a decent bang for the buck.  Anyhow, thanks for the input it's been real helpful!

Nice! Thanks for the reply.  I've noticed the iMax B6 is very popular.  At 1C what are your 6S lipos charging times?  I'm thinking of getting either a 6S or 5S lipo.  That's how I got that 12S - 10S number from.  So, I can charge in parallel or separate.  Just don't want it to take 4 hours, ya know.

I typically run x2 5000 mAh 11.2v 3s lipos in series, for 6s 22.2v.  It takes about 1.5 hours to charge them to 25.2v at 4amps from 20v.

Thanks brotha!  I've actually heard that a lot!  So, I'm not sacrificing there.  However, I've seen some successful set ups with car ESC's.  Anyhow, I've seen VESC that have a wide range in price from $100 to $160.  Do you know of any major differences.  Anyhow, would you mind sharing which one you got?

I weight around 200lbs, I'm using a single 190kv 6054, Castle MM2 ESC, blank KillShot clone deck, modded GT2B remote.

I think the reason I get such good range is that while my board will do 15mph I usually average around 6-7mph.  I only ride the throttle hard on long flats, which are rare where I ride.

I've built multiple boards, but all of my personal builds have been 6s since I'm pretty light (145 lbs) and wanted small batteries for air travel. I have helped many friends with boards, and I can tell you every time those who are willing to put in the money and want the speed that a 10s dual VESC setup offers are happier in the long run.

@nmagz3 buy a good deck from a known skate company. It breaks my heart to see $1000 worth of electronics on a cheap $25 eBay deck. The deck is the heart of your ride; cheap wood and glue have a cheap feeling. 

Bolt your enclosure onto your deck. No epoxy is up the task in the long term.  

Skip lipos and start with a battery system with a BMS. Charging all the time sucks and once esk8 is integrated into your life you'll get sick of plugging and unplugging balance chargers. 

Learn about bushing shape and durometer and dial them in to your preference. This is a cheap way to get the ride qualities you prefer. The best $25 you'll ever spend. 

Tape or hear shrink your motor leads. 

Start riding slowly and be very careful on your first 5-10 rides. Things go wrong, cables come unplugged, you want to learn about those problems at 10-15 mph, not 30 mph. It's easy to get carried away at first and forget that you are riding a potentially dangerous experiment. 

On that note; always wear a helmet!

real wheels not clones
vesc
reliable 2.4ghz mini trigger remote
stiff deck
wide trucks
protect batteries and vescs



 wasted a huge amount of money till I ended up with these.  You can make a better more powerful smoother board than anything commercially available for maybe 700$

simplifying charging with a meanwell bulk charger doing 400 watts with an inline wattmeter and battery medic balancers is the fastest simplest charging to me....unless you go with the bms...but the bms can be a limit if it's hooked up for discharging.

I have been using the IMAX b6 with @oriol360's one port adapter for charging and it works quite well. I would still use a BMS if I had thought about t beforehand though, most of my friends use them so that they don't have to worry about the battery as much.

Thanks for the response brotha!  I'm actually hearing that philosophy a lot in this thread.  It helps me justify my thoughts.  When it came to my drone I always bought cheap and regretted it.  Luckily, drone parts are cheap...just adds up.  I don't want the same thing to happen when I buy a $55 ESC.  Sure I saved money but then after it breaks I'll have to shell out the money for the expensive one I intended on buying.

From what I've gathered the growth in eSk8 DIY products and companies has grown over the last couple years.  It seems today it's a bit easier which I'm grateful for.  However, a community that's less than 5-10 years old is still a baby.  I recently watched a video from Enertion where the dude talks about the growth of the esc to the vesc; I can only imagine that kind of frustration.  With the growth though, I can see how noobs asking uneducated questions could jade the older guys.  Anyhow, I hope you thought this post was useful.  Instead of asking, "what kind of board, motor, etc is the best" I wanted to see and hear from ya'll and what'd you'd do differently on your first build.  I'm psyched, cause this felt like an awesome introduction.

People get jaded, fact of life.  They can leave if they dont like it :).  I thought this was a great question, made me look at the last 3 builds I did a it differently.  

I've only been doing this a couple of months, but I'm totally in love with my electric board, I ride everywhere...work, church, grocery store, in-laws.  I get a lot of looks but who cares, Im having fun.  That;s the thing, when you take away all the BS and really drill down to what makes you passionate about something the people who wanna complain, the funny looks, all that looses importance, just have fun brudda :).

Great advice!  I'm 35 an still in love with skating (aggressive bladed and skateboarded as a kid).  But, now a days I have kids and house that needs work.  This hobby kinda mixes the 2 as I can tinker and problem solve like an adult and still thrash it up in the streets.  As soon as I get all my parts I'll update the community and say thank you for the help from everyone.  

BTW, I read the BMS and 2 6s lipos thread http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/battery-management-system-zippys/10772.  That sounds to complex for my expirience.  But, it was a great debate at that. Could you have just charged both your Zippys in parallel using a balance adapter like this? http://www.banggood.com/Ev-peak-6S-3-in-1-Balance-Adapter-for-XHTPFPHPPQ-Battery-p-935203.html?rmmds=search

On the BMS... IN the long term I was looking to build a battery pack that was removable, contained a Volt meter and BMS to control charge and discharge.  I incorrectly thought the BMS would control the discharge of each cell, it does not do that.  SInce then I have gone with the [MEB Simple Charging Port Adapte](http://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/ez)r.  It makes it so I don't have to take my board apart to charge.  

I haven't given up on the removable pack or the BMS, I'm am going in a different direction however by separating the BMS and volt meter from the pack and using lion cells, still in the research phase though.

I was really impressed with it, such a simple elegant solution for what is a pain in the ass for most DIY'ers.

wide trucks
[/quote]

Can you explain this choice? I know these would be great for improved stability and possible easier mounting of the motor.. any other reasons ? (other than that it might influence turning radious in a bit not so good way)

Ask yourself now if you'll want an eMountainboard in the future, and double or triple your budget accordingly, or start planning for components that can be swapped over or reused. I am just finishing my first eMTB build and can already see where this is heading...mo' $$$. It seems like eMTB's are the natural next step for a lot of folks in the DIY scene, and it only gets more expensive. And more fun!

i doubt I'll ever make a mountain board but it'd like to try one 

I like wide trucks for the stability maybe at higher speeds. Seems more appropriate. Paris 195.  There's some other longer ones forget the name. Much longer. I've never  tried them.

Side topic - how far have you got already? 

I think a very important decision is the right wheel size, right deck and right bushings (if you decide to go with the cheap skate trucks).. it will definately influence the looks, the ride and many other aspects of it..

Dont know if I told you in a message but the next one I do will be with much smaller - lighter wheels, shorter - stiffer deck.. AND I still got to figure out how to make it more maneuvrable without going with springs trucks as I only got skate trucks and dont want to make the board tall as a skyscraper.. (with risers).. only to make it more turny / agile..

---

Been already looking at some solutions.. seen some people make crazy boards with tilting wheels (baja board, 3 wheeled - tilt board).. though it seems a little bit outstretched for now, to make a custom steering mechanism.. Ideal scenario would be for the board to be turny in the low-mid speed range and less turny when going fast.. 

Some sort of pivot mechanism besides the bushing/ kingpin would be great (at least for the front wheels - axle)

Im with you on this one 100% I want to use wider trucks, not standard width longboard trucks.

That's great advice.  I agree with the longer trucks for better stability as speed increases.  However, I've noticed many of the motor mounts in the market fit on trucks that have a bit of a flat spot instead of of a complete round axle.  I hope that makes sense.  So, for a motor mount to fit on the axle of the truck do you need a custom motor mount or are there mounts in the market that fit?

Would have gone straight from the start with vesc, li-ion, bms instead of hk esc, lipo and b6 charger. Would also not buy a prebuilt deck and try to use that rather than get a deck and caliber trucks.

I've been hearing a lot of first builders that regret normal escs and lipos.  I'm definitly going vesc as it seems to be built from the ground up to support eskaters.  And, I'm slowly turning to li-ion as there's so much baby sitting with Lipos :( 

Thanks for the response brotha and look forward to getting to know you in future threads!

Hobbywing Max 6 is a good esc, runs up to 8s. Little chance of frying it due to mis-configuration or firmware issues.

[Check out this god like build on endless sphere with Hobbywing Max6 and Lipos](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=79525&hilit=max6)

I'm using one on [this build](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/featherweight-vanguard-fvt-120-esc-6s-lipo-caliber-2-enertion-6355/10548/27)
I've used vesc, FVT esc and this Max 6. I fried the FVT and one vesc. One FVT turned up bricked and I had to get a replacement.
Have 2 vescs running well and the max 6 seems bulletproof

once you get on a eMTB, it's almost impossible to go back to longboard. if it wasn't for potability purposes, i would've sold my elongboards. just way more fun with eMTB. you're not limited to pave trails. so glad i did my emtb as my 2nd build intead of 4th or something.

thats Jens - he does amazing stuff alright.
The board I have with the max6 is running 6s at the moment. Up to 27km/hr
Depending on what battery you run you select your motor to suit.
Thats running with a 230kv motor - thats 230 revolutions per volt.
check out this calculator for board speeds.[Electric skateboard calculator](http://toddy616.blogspot.com.au/2013/07/electric-skateboard-calculator.html)

Thanks brotha!  I've seen this in the past but didn't an understanding.  After more research I do understand.  Now, is there a sweet spot ratio that I should aim for?  Also, is there such a thing is a sweet spot rpm?  Anyhow I've attached the screenshot of my numbers.  If you have a moment I'd appreciate your perspective!  Thanks again.

Sweet spot for the motor is roughly 80% of ur max rpm based on voltage x kv.  Motor will be more efficient and run cooler
Better to probably just figure what max speed u want

You should definitly edit or delete your post as there are some faults in it. For example, lipos and liion batteries both have a full charge voltage of 4.2 volts per cell. So you cannot say lipos are more power dense from that point.

Is funny that you said that. In my native country skating is a religion. Every child grows wanting a pair of inline skates. Now my 11-year-old daughter is going to attend inline skating classes at high school.

Man, I'm so glad that you responded to this in the way you did.  I do have to admit that when talking about Rollerblading I'm a bit embarrassed as it's not as popular.  However, I know aggressive rollerblading is huge in Japan and that are some people that are still fans like me :slight_smile:  Are we some day gunna have electric rollerblades from you, LOL :joy:

I would have used Lipos instead of Liion. Lipos are so much cheaper it just makes sense for a budget.

Naw, that looks like a great motor!  I have a 6374 motor.  the 6384 will definitely be a bit bigger but I'm sure if you add risers to your trucks you should be fine.
