Hey everyone! Today I'm starting a build log for my first board. I have just finished ordering the last few parts, so building will commence shortly. Despite unpopular opinion, I'm really admiring what the Chinese are up to in the electric skateboard area. They're bridging the gap between mass produced boards and hobbyists like us. As a result I'm plunging into the Chinese world for parts, and so far I'm pretty impressed. 

PARTS:
**Boosted Board clone deck:** https://world.taobao.com/item/536855694383.htm?fromsite=main&spm=a312a.7700824.w4004-14838118875.2.l7tyh8

**Battery Display** https://world.taobao.com/item/524929127650.htm?spm=a312a.7700714.0.0.idmlv8#detail

As you can see, everything I'm buying is coming from China, except the batteries since I live in Europe. (Heads up: NKON is hands down the cheapest supplier of 18650s in Europe if you didn't already know). Everything else that's coming from Taobao is coming through my agent. Buying direct from Taobao to Europe (and especially America) is possible, but it's not easy and a lot of sellers have no interest in shipping internationally. 

So far what has arrived is:
* Deck
* BMS
* Remote
* Wheels trucks pulleys etc
* Lights
* Wire

**My verdict on parts so far:**
**Deck:** At first I was a bit skeptical, especially considering the price. Once it arrived I noticed that only the top and bottom of the deck is bamboo, the inner 3 layers are ply. But regardless, the build quality seems to be very high. The deck is springy like the genuine boosted deck, and generally feels pretty good. Note that it has 6 holes drilled towards one side, for fitting an electronics case to it. But once you put grip tape on it it'll be all covered up so it's not a problem if you don't want them. Grip tape is included with the board. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/4/6423fae7401e518acad36151949d32f1b4b2fc87.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/f/bf33fe47e0ec1970b7f0ae8751e004410563c935.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/6/460da969a32acd789d45f4239e5219ea189a1fe2.jpg" width="375" height="500">

**Wheels** They're just generic fake 97mm flywheels. Never seen real flywheels so I can't comment, but these seem quite flexible (little concerning?). Will ride with them for a while, but I think they're going to need replacing in the long run. 

**Trucks, Bushings, Bearings** All very solid, very pleased with them. No spacers included in the kit. 

**Pulleys** They seem pretty good. I got a few extra belts to prepare for the worst. Replacing the 12T gear with a 15T.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/7/c7d7135d2d7ddb505355675f24f9994ced8fa62b.jpg" width="666" height="500">

**Motor Mount** Note sure if I should be concerned about the mount or not. The metal is quite thin. But it is all steel. The rest of the mount looks solid. The mount fits really nicely with the trucks and gears. They also included a belt shield. Once I sand off the branding it should be all good. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/c/4c5841803068e68781c6578209be0444134671f3.jpg" width="666" height="500">


So that's my verdict on the parts so far. Looking forward to testing the Maytech VESC. If things continue at this success rate, I should have a very good value board! Please leave me any feedback if you've got any, very new to the world of e-skating! :)

Hey buddy ! Interesting build ! Am also going for that kind of board with the same specs. Except sourcing everything within Europe :) Have got the vanguard flex 2 and it is quite flexy so a split enclosure is the way to go. Is that board as flexy that you would need a split enclosure ? I'll get the same exact cells from nkon. Isn't the 10s4p a better value ? Since you get a discount with 40 cells ? And do you have a spot welder available ? 

Whats the total sum you have spent so far :) ? Info about Shipping and duration concerning taobao would be cool

To be honest I tend to find a bit exaggerated the systematic negative comments that you see on the site with regard to Chinese components. i have had the opportunity to work with some Chinese companies in the past in the capacitors industry, and I can tell you they progressed really fast and it did not take long for them to catch up with their Western competitors who had been in the industry for decades, and at a far cheaper cost. So paying twice the price does not systematically means you get a better quality.
The problem is always the same: how to find the right supplier that will provide quality products in the hundreds that you have available on the various Internet platforms? It takes time and energy, and many of us do not have that, especially for what is for most of us a hobby. i think it would be far more constructive to share experience of bad and good suppliers so that others do not make the same mistake and get the benefit of experience.
After all one of the leaders in the commercial drones industry is DJI, is fully Chinese and develops products that are far more technical and sensitive than our motors, ESC and batteries with a high level of quality.
After that you can still decide to buy "Made in USA" or I don't know where and pay the "fair" price, but are you sure quality is always guaranteed? I am not necessarily convinced

To me, it is much more problematic than the rest.

Sounds good! This board is quite flexy, will definitely be using a 2 part enclosure. The flex is quite comparable to a boosted board. 

Yes 10S4P would be more cost effective but ultimately only by a few euro. Considering the VESC that I'll be using, it won't be able to handle the extra current of a 4P pack, as far as I can tell.. 

I've asked NKON to put soldering tags on each battery, so connecting them all up shouldn't be too tough

I would definitely agree with you in regards to the boosted deck and fake flywheels, but if you look on this forum, a huge number of people are using things like fake flywheels from European and American e skate shops. What they're dong isn't any worse than the Chinese.

I would definitely agree. I have been importing from China for the past 2 years now, the range in quality from manufacturer to manufacturer is huge. It's all about finding the good guys, then it's easy sailing from there on.

That's for sure, they do not have much consideration for that, even though it is slowly evolving.
But that is more a moral point of view, unless you are yourself a manufacturer and don't want to be caught, which I perfectly understand.

Nice build, I'm trying a dual hub motor build for my buddy, was going to get steel hubs but he wants to go with less expensive parts. I'm interested to see your VESC results if it holds up well. I have a quote for some parts from Maytech and I'm about to bite.  Some interesting food for thought is the WIRED documentary done on Shenzhen manufacturers with how they create products with the inspiration from other designs from other companies in or outside of china... :)   There are some good points in the video how they are advancing their tech quicker than ever because they aren't fighting one another with patent and IP suits as it slows down the speed to advance.  Its a pretty interesting documentary, maybe it will change perspective for some who are just down right nasty with the Chinese manufacturers and their products influences.

Thanks for the heads up. I've heard.. But at the same time I'm willing to give it a shot, as it seems like some people have 0 problems while others encounter a lot. The ergonomics are really good. 

The flex is pretty good. After riding on it today it seems a slight bit less bendy than the boosted board ( go to 16 seconds to 19 seconds https://youtu.be/BUsL-IxPquA?t=15s ). Not sure what sort of finish is on it, I can feel the grain, so my guess is that it's some sort of thin lacquer coating. For the price of 30something dollars (?), it's a very good deck.

Yea I think its more a quality control issue or signal interference which is different based on location.

I've taken a quick ride on the boosted 2 and it was crazy flexxy! I didn't even check the conversion, at that price its looks really nice! :slight_smile:
Depending on shipping maybe i'll get one for a regular push board! (that will probably become electric because i'm lazy now!)

Total costs for the whole board (by the time it reaches my doorstep): (item price + agent fees + tax + shipping (approx):

VESC: 90 USD
Motor: 115 USD
Charger: 10 USD
Wheels trucks pulleys kit: 125 USD
Deck: 50 USD
BMS: 20 USD
Smaller bits: 60 USD
Remote: 40 USD
Batteries --
TOTAL (every cost included by the time it reaches my door) 510 USD

Taobao is pretty reliable. You get what you see, and it will arrive (if you're getting it sent to a Chinese address). Shipping to my Chinese address from Taobao takes about 2-4 days (they post on weekends too). Once everything arrives to my chinese address I ship with DHL so I have everything in another 3/4 days. In my situation, I buy from Taobao more than I would buy from the likes of Amazon for example, because it's actually a lot quicker and more convenient (crazily enough). But it does vary from person to person of course :)

After looking at a couple more videos of the boosted, I don't think it's as flexy, for example, I don't think I could press the middle to the ground (but also my wheels are much larger at 97mm). The boosted board's bamboo runs in vertical strips rather than horizontal sheets, which helps with the flex. 

I'd say try the board, I'm really enjoying it so far!

I have the same truck, motor mount and pulley system, the most or mount works fine, as long as you can get the ,other mount steady in the truck, which I do have to use a stand drill to fix It. The seller recommend me to weld them, weirdly the truck is aluminium while the motor mount is iron, which u can't weld them. 
I wish I built mine like 6months later coz they finally have a vesc selling in taobao !!!!!

Thanks for sharing!! Very insightful. My plan is also to drill into the truck. I think 2 screws at either side should be enough to hold it in place. I'm a little worried about the overall strength of the motor mount considering the power than I'm giving it, so I'm just hoping that it will all work out fine. Are you using the standard 12T pulley that came with the kit? How are you finding it, does it slip at all? I'm upgrading to the 15T just to be safe.

I do use the 12T pulley, coz i do use the motor they sale, which is 200kv. Since I want to have a larger torque, the 3:1 pulley ratio allow the kv of the motor to be a bit higher.
Mine: 200/3=66.6kv
Yours: 190 x 15/36 = 79.1kv

Well, it's easy to avoid import tax if that's your goal, but it is literally tax fraud. However if you're going with the "all my items from China are marked as a gift I don't see why this can't" attitude, then yeah, you could probably get away with it once or twice (provided that the seller/forwarder agrees to fake values) but I don't exactly support it... Lol

Acyually depends on the single countries. In my country taxes are to be paid according to the commercial value (basically they open the box, search on the internet and apply the taxes to the average of the prices the have found). 
This holds true for any kind of shipping, no matter what you write on the package and no matter what you actually paid for the object.

When the objects are not easy to find on the web finance police will evaluate the object.

Wow that's really interesting. I can see a lot of room for error in that.. (especially if you're snatching up bargains like on Taobao). In Ireland a huge amount of small packages get through from China, marked as 'gifts' with no value, because customs officers aren't bothered to look inside lol. But with any bigger packages they want full proof of payment etc etc. Not so fun.

I forgot to mention that if the estimated value is less than 22€ you dont pay tax, so basically very light packages and letters dont undergo tax.

Btw The finance police is super well trained and know perfectly where to look for prices (they know taobao, aliexpress...). Usually their evaluation is very precise. 
I believe this way, although it is less precise, it is much faster than asking every single invoice.

there is too much flex on the original vanguard, it is better separate two part (battery and vesc like boosted.b) compartment instead of one in the middle of the deck.

Some updates!! Everything has arrived in, beginning the build. The VESC seems pretty solid, looking forward to trying it out. Any questions about any parts, just ask away. Having trouble lining up the wheel pulley perfectly.. Any suggestions/methods that you use to go about it? Cheers!

UPDATE: So I've skipped ahead here to the point where everything is done here (other than underside enclosures). I'm working on a big video for my YouTube channel of the build, so I didn't bother going through the process here as it's pretty generic and you've seen it 100s of times already. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/b/9b4d689bc2f46b9261f40d05c73c63136f08a4cd.jpg" width="666" height="500">
I took it for a test spin last night, about 5-6km. Everything worked excellently. 0 complaints about the parts so far, great connection between the winning remote (with the coasting fail safe enabled). Motor runs nice and cool, Maytech VESC is excellent so far, standard programming procedure, I just need to figure out how to get the sensord on the motors to work (more on that later). I only managed to get it up to 35km/h before chickening out (still trying to grasp the concept of people doing 50km/h+!!!). By the end of the test trip all was well except the screws on my motor mount which had come loose. The Loctite didn't do it's job to well.. Do you guys use medium or high strength loctite? I used medium and it simply doesn't do the trick. Little scared about using high strength but it looks like I'll have to go with it.. 

Right now I'm making 2 very simple moulds for vacuum forming enclosures. I can't get my hands on ABS too easily, so I'm going to give 3mm perspex a go. Do you know of anyone on the forums who has used perspex before? They'll end up very very rigid.. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/9/59774fac986a0a143a5d6d8ca54a9503bae510de.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Will post some photos tomorrow once the enclosures are done! I started work on Saturday, and I should have the whole project done tomorrow evening after school. I tend to work fast when I'm excited!

Perspex is not as rubbery when hot as some of the other plastics. I would give it a go but the corners are going to be tricky.

Right so update on the perspex enclosures: total disaster. I can see why nobody else does it. The plastic doesn't stretch enough. Tried heating it further with a heat gun to stretch it but it tore. Would not recommend!! <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/7/4784036a54853770cc3bceb3b633864333c4de61.jpg" width="666" height="500">

I then tried using low density polyethylene . Not ideal but it's much better than the perspex (not as good as ABS but as I mentioned previously it's very difficult to get in Ireland..). Using the vacuum former, and then a heat gun, I managed to get it to a reasonable shape. Not perfect but it will do as a temporary solution. 

Will be spray painting the enclosures black. Eventually I will replace the enclosures with properly formed abs enclosures. More updates tonight when I start fitting everything together!

It sure seems excellent so far, very very little heat generated while riding. My only concern about the motor is the actual frame: there are reports of these frames snapping (where the motor is screwed to the motor mount). So in hindsight I would have had seconds thoughts about it for that reason only. But other than that it seems really good!

Not Maytech motors specifically, but the metal part on the motor that you screw on to. A good few people on the forums have experienced them breaking. The design of the part is generic, there are a lot of brands that use the same design for that part, and others have broken (I can't imagine that Maytech use a different metal for that part of the motor..? I'd say they were all made in the same place). So since it seems to be quite a weak design that multiple brands still use, (and given that Maytechs part is the same as the others), I would think twice about buying. But if Enertion really gets their motors made by Maytech, then I wouldn't feel as bad about it, but I still feel a little uneasy..

Everything fitted. Little concerned about the temporary enclosures, I might need to reinforce the screws with a bracket as the plastic is a little soft. Will be taking it out for a ride in the morning, but if it's as good as the first test run, then I'm going to be very happy. Will be designing the new enclosures over Christmas.

Looks so nice! 

That XT90 plug, if you pull that out it disconnects the battery? 

I'm no electrical engineer but I have heard many say long battery wires can cause inductance which can hurt the esc. Someone with more knowledge can chime in and tell us if this an acceptable length or not? Though having the + - wires next to each other is meant to cancel it out to some degree so you might be ok. Its better to lengthen the motor wires and shorten the battery wires to reduce the affect.

Thanks for the suggestion! I'll see if I can get my hands on some PC, I believe it's easier to find over here. Yup that's our workshop in high school, nothing amazing but such a huge relief to have a place like it here in Ireland (which is such a heavily service based country, hence basically no DIY attitude compared to the US/rest of Europe). 

Yep the XT90 acts as a switch, pulling it out breaks the circuit. Just need to replace the male end with a XT90-S, the spark makes me flinch every time..

Interesting thought about induction.. If anyone else could chime in that'd be much appreciated! I'll see what else I can find out in the meantime

Really sweet looking board! Would love to see some updated photos on your build log. The XT90 situation is a little tricky, because you need so much force to keep it in place. Basically I just used a ridiculous amount of hot glue to keep it in place (I put in other objects too to help fill in the space). But now nothing at all can come free, so it should be g. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/b/5bfa9c63b228ce20cc0060a01300b6ceefa3c7e2.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/0/40927c92df93b7bc96a03d9c960a08c9fb89d456.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Well, in terms of current draw I definitely think 10s3p is more than you need @ 60A. If it's your first build I think you'd be pleasantly surprised with the performance and range of 10s3p. I haven't had a chance to actually test range yet as it has been wet for the past week, but I'm sure others on the forums have reliable stats as it's a common combo. 

If you can afford the extra cost and space, go for 4p (the more the merrier), but personally I think 3p is a sweet spot and I wouldn't go any higher if I was building it again.

I used to have the batt max @ 60A but it is just too much power for me to comfortably handle for the moment. Some people report to have issues with Vescs in general @ 12S, but I'm not the one to ask about that.

Right so that motor screeching sound that I mentioned last week.. I haven't been able to take out the board since because of the wet weather, but I was messing around with it in the house yesterday and the motor gave up! Out of nowhere the magnets loosened up and began rubbing against the motor windings. Take a listen for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jgq_bnqFD4

You can see the scratches on the magnets in the image. They've loosened slightly.

Fixing it would be a messy and risky job (for me at least). I've contacted Maytech this evening so I'll see what they have to say. Will post some updates then.. :cold_sweat:

I have had very little actual usage before the motor got mucked up. But so far I am very, very happy with the remote. You just have to set it up correctly. Make sure that the coasting fail safe is set up (so that it will coast instead of brake when it looses connection for long periods of time. I also have it set up so that it will maintain it's throttle position for 400ms after the connection is lost so it can reconnect. But with normal riding conditions this has never even been a problem because the connection is really good. If you are 10 meters+ away from the board, you will notice lag, but nobody rides in those kind of conditions anyway. People have reported issues with connectivity at low battery, so I've kept mine charged pretty well, so it's something to be cautious with. So overall, this controller has been amazing for me so far. In the past others have reported problems with the controller, but since the summer Winning have made some alterations (like expanding the antenna inside) that have helped fix connectivity issues. 5/5 would recommend!

It really is a right nightmare trying to remove this motor from the motor mount without breaking anything.. I've worn down the allen key holes, so I'm thinking about filing the screw head inwards so I can grip it with a vice grips and uncrew it. I've used high strength loctite. Apparently heating it to 250°C melts the loctite for easy removal, but I'm a little concerned about whether the motor can withstand that kind of temperature...!

Anyone got any other suggestions/tips for removing the high strength loctite without destroying the motor or mount?

Can you fit a larger Allen wrench into it or does the hole look like a circle? 

Does the bolt have a countersunk hole into the mount? Worst case,  I would say you'd have to drill it out with a much smaller bit

Nope it's basically circled out. No the bolt isn't countersunk, hence my idea of filing the head of it. I'll try a mix of heat and filed head, and see if I have any luck. I can't drill the bolt out because I would most likely end up ruining the thread on the motor which I can't let happen since I'm returning the motor

If you have one, take a Dremel tool with a fine cutting wheel on it and make a slit in the center of the head. Then you should be able to turn them out with a flathead screwdriver. I had to do that on all 5 of my v4 DIY mount, worked great. Maybe even a hacksaw blade if you don't have a Dremel...

In my eyes, I'd say this is the next best alternative if you're absolutely sure you don't want to use heat. If you don't use heat and the loctite is holding the bolt in there that tight, you could end up breaking off the head which leaves you no choice but to drill it out. That probably wouldn't be good unless Maytech would take it back with a broken bolt in the threads. :slight_smile:

@Baz_L Just make sure that you make a nice straight slit into the head of the bolt, ideally as narrow as you can to fit a flat blade screwdriver in. That way, you leave the most amount of material for the flathead to grab. And make sure the sides of your slit are perfectly vertical, otherwise your screwdriver will try to slip out of the slot when you start cranking on it. Ask me how I know. :unamused: And hitting it with a moderate amount of heat before trying to dislodge the bolts would not be a bad idea. 

Good luck!

Took on @TheImmortalJew 's idea of making a cut for a flat head, worked perfectly! I didn't even need to apply any heat, Loctite's so called 'high strength' thread locker was easy enough to unscrew. Thanks for all the suggestions and help guys! Also if anyone needs to do the same in the future, here's a great idea for applying precise heat that I thought about: use a soldering iron and keep it against the screw for a few minutes to get it up to temperature (if your soldering iron can make it past 200°C). Saves the risk of melting wire insulation ;) I'll let you know what Maytech's return procedure is. Cheers!

Nice, glad it worked out. If you have the clearance for your belt and pulley, I would change those button head bolts for some socket cap ones. More engagement for your hex tool so you can torque them down without fear. I made the change and have yet to strip a head even with red loctite.

Yep bought over 200 items on aliexpress, but I always wanted to buy directly from taobao(cheaper) but you need a third person if you want to buy from out of asia

You dont need a third person (chinese) to buy from the following websites: alibaba, aliexpress and taobao. These are all equipped to pay with westerns credit cards.

Shipping can be an issue only on taobao (if you dont speak mandarin): the procedure to ship on taobao is 
1)to search directly on taobao 国际快递 (international shipping); 2)find a shipper (they are listed as they were products) 3)get a deal on private chat 4)pay the shipping 5)put the shipper's address as your taobao address

Then the shipper will collect, repack and ship your items.

OR just pay few more dollars and let some western reseller do the work for you.

@Baz_L Thanks for your answer ! I ordered from the same seller, I sent him a note a few days ago but it's chinese new year right now so I also ordered the missing part from DIY (couldn't wait haha)
 I also have a Maytech motor, I'll report back if I end up with the same issue as you (I am planning to run hybrid mode as a start, I am not sure about fully sensored...)

Awesome build! Its provided me with great inspiration to start my own build based off of the chinese market :slight_smile:

The photo on Taobao depicts a dual motor setup for the trucks, wheels, pulleys etc. Which option would I select to purchase the dual motor setup?

Glad you enjoyed the read. As standard, the trucks, wheels, mounts etc setup comes as a dual motor setup. So you get 2 mounts, plates, enough screws and pulleys etc. I just decided to leave out the other side of the drive setup and settle for single drive rather than dual.

Thank you so much! That sounds perfect then :) As you are in Europe how much did shipping cost you? In my case after entering my Australian shipping address it would come out with some ridiculous amount (3000 yen for some items :tired_face:) And this is just for ordering things like 10AWG wire :expressionless: Additionally, anything from Maytech is unable to ship to Australia...

Should I try and contact these sellers and ask if the shipping prices are accurate? Or do you think its just easier to go through an agent?

I have an agent in China that takes care of all my Chinese orders for my business and hobby stuff like this longboard. So I can't give you any advice on buying direct.. It can be tough, but it is doable in most cases. As far as I know Taobao is quite Australia friendly compared to Europe

No worries then ;) I'll do some research on Australian agents to see if they're any good and go from there. If not I can always buy direct, but there's always some degree of uncertainty due to language barriers, which is to be expected of course.

Back to work! Got in a new motor, thanks to @ajaynagra for hooking me up. Motor from Maytech is taking a bit of time so I need a quick fix. Should have it all up and running in a couple of hours. Let's hope for better luck with this motor 😃 <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/8/f83af0ccdfa7bd194fda17b2d352060d201ebe43.jpg" width="666" height="500">

1st ride on the motor went fine (3rd ride of all time..). So what's to say about the new motor: So far so good. Build quality isn't as good as the Maytech for sure, but considering the significantly lower price it's expected. I think it's a bit louder at full rpm than the Maytech. Also seems to be some sort of rattle sound at lowest rpm, very subtle, hoping it doesn't worsen but I doubt it. The (banana?) plugs are smaller on this motor compared to the Maytech motor or any ordinary VESC so I had to rewire. Same 12AWG wire though. Motor enclosure is exactly the same as the Maytech. The shaft on this motor is different though, it has a little ridge on it which stops the pulley from coming too close (see photo). Overall happy with the motor so far. Will report back after more testing. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/b/eb370a0f379a385a2d1d2eae05349f30ae38f3e0.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Haven't done an actual range test yet so I can't comment. Considering my uneconomical first run, it's hard to make a judgement just yet.

The single reason for using an agent was so I could pay with paypal.

We'll see how this pans out :)

I have the footage, just need to go through the process of editing it. I might make some more upgrades in the meantime though. No rush, but I'm obliged to do it (sponsors), so that gives me that little push to do it! ;)

My main enclosure is kaput! Coming from riding a 22" Penny, moving up to this beast made me become a little cocky regarding the size of curbs I was taking on (which ultimately lead to fracture). Holding the enclosure in place with Velcro for the time being. This does help motivate me to actually start making the permanent enclosures though.. Most likely going to be 2 ABS enclosures.

Really enjoyed reading about this build. How are the charger and BMS? They seem so cheap that its kind of scary! Do you think they are good?

Im thinking of buying the wheels, pulley/belt sets, BMS, charger and maybe even the VESCs from Taobao, I have a chinese coworker and were going to try to buy straight to the US without an agent, apparantly this is possible but often you  need to contact sellers first. Also wires and hardware like screws etc are super cheap on Taobao.

When I cracked my enclosure something in my battery pack shorted/something began to go funny.. I didn't realise this until after I tried charging the pack. I have stripped down all the electronics again, and rebuilding the pack and fixing the issue (1 set of parallel cells are kaput from it..). Once I rebuild I'll be able to retest it and diagnose the issue (either charger problem, bms problem, or problem created from the short circuit). I'll be posting an update soon. It hasn't been easy sailing, but I can't put it down to bad parts, or bad building on my behalf, or anything else for the matter until I get everything up and working again.. Update soon!

@Baz_L, can you please let me know [which 15T pulley](https://world.taobao.com/item/39638387460.htm?fromsite=main&spm=a312a.7700824.w1017-2425805193.25.dtrbwl&) did you choose?
There are few options to choose from, and I have no idea which one to pick. 
I need it for a 8mm motor shaft. I would also like to know if it fits HTD3 or HTD5 synchronous belt.

Thanks!
