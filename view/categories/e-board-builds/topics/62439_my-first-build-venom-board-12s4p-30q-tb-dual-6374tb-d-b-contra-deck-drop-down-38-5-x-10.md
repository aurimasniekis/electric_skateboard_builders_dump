First off I would like to give a special thanx to @mmaner, @Battosii, @Briman05, @Ackmanica, @johnnyMeduse, for helping me directly with a lot of noob question & or issues I encountered during my build & thank you to all of you guys on this forum for sharing your experience both bad & good & for sharing a lot of your knowledge...Soooo a little background in my esk8 journey...I purchased my first eboard back in 2015 (yunnec ego 1). At the time with no downhill boarding experience 13mph was ‚Äúfast‚ÄùüòÑ... a couple years after that I wanted more so I started to look into production board & lacking the knowledge that I have now I purchased a couple of evolve boards for me & my son...ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èwhere I quickly learned that their packs were trash, during this experience I joined the forums & was able to find someone to upgraded my packs to 10s4p 30q & I added 200kv Motors which made a world of a different for the boards & I still use them til this day I also was able to get my hands a raptor 2 which is a really solid board with really good power...other than repairing a few spot welds, & bad solder joints on my modded evolve boards I have no prior mechanic experience with eboards....so I was inspired by a lot of your builds out there & I figured I‚Äôll take the leap of faith & here I am today with the completion of my very first build....üôåüèæ if you guys see anything I should change or any ideas other than what I have going please feel free to give your advice... ü§ôüèæ

I'm floored. The detail is incredible. The white weave in the phase wires, individually, such a great idea. Awesome board.

How do the supercarvers ride with the one arm removed?

Also how did you get the gummies to fit on the truck?

I use them same way on one of modded evolve boards & once you remove one of the arms they become very stable... I used an super star hub adapter from Board bumpers... which allow the hubs to fit a regular size truck... https://www.boardbumpersshop.com/product-page/trampa-superstar-hub-bearing-adapter-set

Hey so I have a question when I did the input wizard set up for the remote configuration... I made a mistake the 1st time and had the remote on slow mode... so I did it again but this time putting the remote on fast...but I don‚Äôt see a difference when switching modes do I have an slow- fast option or is it just one speed?? Or is there something else I need to do?

I think it is only one way I‚Äôm not sure if anyone can say different. I think since you ar doing it diy there is no fat or slow. I only did it once did you do the throttle mapping?

Yes I did the throttle mapping... I just thought maybe it automatically set the slow mode but I guess not... also on Battery current my bms is rated 60a continuous & 150a peak... would it be ok to set each focbox @ 35-40a?

Wow those venom trucks are pretty, it‚Äôs so skateboard style with the kingpin facing inwards rather than outwards non reversed. 
Nice battery bay too, would like to know the battery bay durability, I‚Äôm deciding on the battery bay which is the biggest headache for now, same drop deck, low clearance.. your board is nicely done... nice decals too haahaa

Thanx... my battery enclosure is from https:// the material is a thin plastic & weak round the edges, which is why i added some aluminum reinforcement to help with  some durability, but it gets the job done..üëçüèΩ.
