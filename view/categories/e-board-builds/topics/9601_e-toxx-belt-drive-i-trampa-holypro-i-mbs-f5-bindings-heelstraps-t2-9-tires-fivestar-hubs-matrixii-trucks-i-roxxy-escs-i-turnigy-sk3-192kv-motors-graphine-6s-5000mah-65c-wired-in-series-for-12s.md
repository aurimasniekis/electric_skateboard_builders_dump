Still waiting on some parts, figured I'd put together what I can.

Some fancy lookin' batteries here. Almost didn't wanna cover 'em with shrink wrap. Was gonna go with Zippies, but they're a little longer than the Graphines, and I was concerned about having enough space for all the wiring. Don't want any wire protruding from the edge of the deck if at all possible. Nice they come with XT90s. Little less soldering to do.

MBS killed it with their new lineup. I've been riding one of their comp brake boards over the last year or so just for bombing hills. F5's are super kush memory foam, and check difference in turning radius between the Matrix trucks and the Trampas:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/3/93be4f7bfe1b8c694fbc13fda2f084777787f289.JPG" width="666" height="500">

As someone previously mentioned on another thread, these Trampas turn like a mac truck. I don't understand why they would be designed to be this tight. Mind you, the first pic above is with yellow dampas with 1/4" holes drilled down through the center of each. I can't imagine how anyone would want to ride with any of the other colors. I'm a snowboarder; I like to be able to gently lean into my carving, as apposed to straining my feet and ankles to make turns. 

I tried pulling the dampas out altogether and just riding on springs awhile back, but it felt like it would be super sketchy at high speeds; honestly, starting to wonder the same thing about the Matrix trucks too. Been awhile since I rode my downhill board. Top end on this build's gonna be pretty insane. May switch to the orange shockblocks if need be:

@willpark16 

From what I read, which really wasn't much (couple lines on a forum somewhere), graphenes are Turnigy's high-end line of lipos; in that they can handle more charges than their other batteries. 

I've just been trying to follow along with whatever nowind's been using. I would've went with Zippies, but I wanted to mount the batteries perpendicular to the board and the graphenes are a little shorter. Didn't want any wires protruding from the edge of the deck if at all possible.

I have built something similar ([http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/dorian-wiskow-emtb-build-trampa-holypro-17-twin-sk3-6374s-twin-max6-escs-6s-16-000mah-lipo/10859](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/dorian-wiskow-emtb-build-trampa-holypro-17-twin-sk3-6374s-twin-max6-escs-6s-16-000mah-lipo/10859)), but went with Hobbywing waterproof MAX6 ESCs and a 6S 16,000mAh battery. Have a look at my build log for more info.

I found the 'jolt' from the ESCs to be tricky to handle on both acceleration and braking, so developed a little board to be able to apply an acceleration/deceleration curve. This stopped me being thrown off the board when 'stepping on the gas' or braking and made my board as smooth as butter to ride.

@benjammin am really interested in your comment about Trampa Dampas . . . how did you manage to fit the shockblocks to the Infinity trucks?

@DWiskow 

Hi Dorian, greetz from another goofy/lefty :relaxed:

No shockblocks on the Trampa trucks. I used yellow dampas w/1/4" holes drilled down through the center of each to loosen them up a little bit. The new board using shockblocks is with MBS matrixII.

I'm very interested in your magic board here! I've gotten used to the 'jolt' when riding. I actually like it tbh, although I almost ate shit the other day braking for a squirrel that ran out in front of me :sweat_smile: That was the first time I went from full throttle, to full brakes that quickly. Very difficult to hang onto! 

However, you got me kinda spooked about the idea of losing contact with the receiver and locking up unexpectedly. Does that actually happen? Is there any way to have a setting that only gets applied when signal is lost? Also I too would like to have other people ride with me without getting injured. I had one friend try it out so far. He almost banana peeled right off the bat and hasn't wanted to get back on since :grinning:

Hi, just saw this thread. I was riding with orange shock blocks initially and thought they were crazy hard to turn with, so switched to yellow as loose as possible. That was great at low speed, and still is for cruising slowly, treating it like a surf/snowboard. But at higher speeds I've hit major speed wobble and come off a couple of times. So now I'm switching back to orange for the BMX track or fast speeds, and will keep the yellow for grassy hill shredding :slight_smile:. They're pretty easy to switch out at least.

Oh I should probably say, this is on the MBS Matrix Pro ii trucks. Not entirely relevant to your thread, but just thought I'd chip in! Your new build looks sweet.

@dinodave 

Hi, thanks for the info.  

Been a little leery about keeping the yellow shockblocks in on this one. Gonna try switching back to orange. I am using Matrix Pro II though. Accidentally left the 'pro' off on the title. Not really much difference between the two from what I understand, other than being slightly lighter. And the pros come with orange shockblocks rather than yellow.

I really like your build btw. Been following along for awhile now :slight_smile:

Nice build man and the range of those trucks! 

I have yellow drampas on my board and like everyone I felt like they were too tight at first but you can proper lean when carving and I quite like that. It gets sketchy over 16mph for me as I start to get speed wobbles but I'm getting better. 

I'll be keeping an eye on your build, looks sweet!

@EssEnn

Thanks man, can't wait to get this one going! I really like yours as well. Looks badass with all the carbon fiber! Gonna be adding the same esc mount to my other build: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/e-toxx-motor-mounts-trampa-holypro-ultimate-trucks-primo-alpha-8-tires-superstar-hubs-mbs-f5-bindings-w-trampa-heelstraps-turnigy-sk3-192kv-turnigy-nano-tech-8s-hobbywing-max6/9305 

The trick to avoiding speed wobbles, aside from tight trucks, is to keep your weight forward. What I've found to work for me, considering you can't really get into a tuck like you would on a longboard, when you're strapped into bindings, is to push down and back with my rear foot (if that makes sense). Sounds counterintuitive, but this helps me center my weight over my front foot. Also works well for the jolt during take off.

@benjammin Yep, I keep finding myself with more weight on my back foot. Its easier when snowboarding to keep weight on my front foot as that's the one going down. I guess practice practice practice is the only option. Thanks for the tip though, I'll give it a go when I next get to ride.

Decided to hold up on the Roxxy build for a minute. Wanna wait and see how nowind does with the caps. Make sure there aren't anymore fires.

This is pretty much the same build, but with max6's and MBS comp95 deck. Just waiting on the esc's. Should be here any day now. 

Setting this one up in regular stance for my daughter (with 6s batteries for now).  

Had to reshape the tail a little bit to make room for the beltdrive. Wheels are MBS roadies w/rockstar II hubs.

Hey Ben.
Shaped Tip is looking good... 

Filled up the first Roxxy today with epoxi, have to wait 48h now... hope to get it out of the cast again ..

With the epoxi mod you loose all waranty claims !
I would advise to add an capacity bank like the "YGE 9 Caps" , this can only help with long battery wires and will not influence the warranty.

Also i advise to use some shock absorbing piece by mounting the ESC.
You can do like a "sandwich" for Example : 2 pieces carbon fibe plate, between some foam rubber, glued together. Now you can screw the lower plate to the deck and using some double sided tape to fix the ESC to upper plate.... Hope you know what i mean

Cheers

IMO, the Matrix2 trucks are the way to go. They're lighter than Trampas, capable of a much larger range of motion and the adjustment screws are on the bottom so the speed controllers don't get in the way. Can't speak for the Flames though. Those things look pretty sick.

@Sictrampa 

Haven't really done anything with the 12s build for a minute. Got a 12s7p on the way from barajabali though. Run time should be pretty awesome I hope, plus the battery wires will end up shorter this way (trying to avoid using caps).

@JLabs

Thanks man, yeah these MBS trucks are the shit. I swapped out the bushings though in my other board, the one with Trampa trucks, and it actually turns now :sweat_smile: Think I must've messed one of 'em up when I was first putting it together. Turns like a champ now though. Was just out for a night ride :smiley: Trying to get it in before the rain hits again. 

The matrix trucks have been cool though for when people ride in 6s, it's easy to switch to yellow shockblocks to loosen up the steering for slower riders. And, if anyone's crazy enough to hit a rail on one of these things, they have an even grind surface too :smiling_imp:

This 25mm wide HTD5 Belts are really strong, from Motorpower only i dont killed them.
On Bens MBS Beltdrive its even better caused to more axle Distance, 
compared to my Flame or Trampa Drive. 
Used 12S Roxxy and in one build 80mm Leopards. 
Ok in this special build i used HeavyDuty Belts, just because they fit in my coulor theme :relieved:

@Nowind  Mh thanks for reply. Im more interested in 20mm belts actually. 25mm seems way wide and probably requires axle support already for the motor / pulley.

Im not sure if im gonna build one but im interestrd to find out what belt might be needed for 2 - 2.5kw setup per one motor.

It might as well.be that 15mm still suits this category but if.i remember one of the charts i saw. 3-4hp was the limit for 15mm/htd5 and speeds we use. 

Then again it depends on how correct and truthful this chart was, which i saw

Ended up swapping the 9" tires out for 7" evolves. Would've been way too fast for me otherwise.

Just got a night ride in. Roads are dead here at night. Been riding in the middle of the highway :grin: This thing hauls ass :smiling_imp: Was cruising at 30mph, and still felt like I had quite a bit of trigger to go. Didn't wanna push it too hard on the first ride. Brakes on the Roxxys are going to take some getting use to. Very touchy. The trucks handle the speed with ease though. Got a real soft buttery feel to 'em compared to springs.

Sweet as dude, are they 5 x 1000µF 63v Caps? 5000µF in tottal? do you have one for each esc or?

@Cobber 

Yeah ends up being more total microfarads than YGE iirc. General consensus on the RC forums says it's better to use smaller caps and more of them, so YGE's probably a better bet I think. These were easier to get here in the states though. Yes, one for each ESC.

We also need some video dude! 😉

Cool good to know. I have 5 x 330µF 63v on my esc('s) and I just ordered 2 x YGE 9 caps (9 x 390µF) from [freakware.de](https://www.freakware.de/en/p/yge-cap-s-9-yge-c9-a50870.htm) I hope they get to me faster than yours did :confused:
I'll be at 5160µF total close to your total. Have you got a anti spark system? my esc has a extra active wire with I think a a resistor as described [here](http://yge.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Manual-Caps-5-9.pdf)
So esc end I'll have those and xt150 antisparks the other... I'm not going with a switch.
Those MBS F5 bindings look substantial!

Got some footage from earlier today. Can't figure out how to flip the video around though (again, borderline retarded here). 

Wanted to open it up a little bit with the gt2b before I send it to @Stevemk14ebr to make sure there were no issues. Hopefully get it out tomorrow or the day after. Still gotta switch the stance (damn weirdos and your left foot forward nonsense 😎). This board is so badass (having some major seller's remorse lol). No way can I go back to riding the 8s build after this. Think I've got someone here locally that's gonna buy it. If not I plan to piece out some of the parts and rebuild. 

This one tops out at about 33mph. Wanna try and get up to at least 35 or so with the next. Plan to go with Jenso's direct drive with a segmented battery enclosure underneath if possible. Can't say enough good things about these trucks (unbelievably stable at speeds). Night and day difference between these and springs, and the brakes on the Roxxys are fine. Just takes a minute to get used to.

Just wanted to add: for anyone using, or considering using Roxxy ESCs, this board, along with several others that I know of have ended up in flames due to failed Roxxy speed controllers. I strongly recommend using something else, or at least ditching the heel straps if applicable, and perhaps carrying a fire extinguisher (sorry, should've posted this awhile ago).

Yah so roxxys are out the game for now..
I´m still wondering if some other 12s esc is capable of our needs without rocketing out with costs..
For 8s there are the hobbywing ezrun max 6 which are really good!, but for 12s only option is Vesc 6 so far..

They are but it´s totally different.
ESCs like the Max 6 are a plug and play sollution, waterproof and kick your ass.
Vesc is programmable, not watertight and smooth.

And sometimes we wanna have our ass kicked ;)

Also when it comes to power:

Max 6:
3,7V x 8 x 150A = 4400W

Vesc 6:
3,7V x 12 x 70A (?max continous) = 2664W

I have my Trampa VESC 6 current limits set up at 120A (max value that stock firmware allows), my metr.at logs show that this current usually flows only during really dynamic start ups or when wheels get stuck, for like a fraction of a second. Usually, even riding in hard terrain currents not exceed 30-35 A per VESC, I would be sceptic to what real performance and currents of MAX 6 looks like. But man VESC 6 is a beast...

I maxed this out in the woods on small hills - more like a ramp on an old industrial field.
So i ran a few times in overcurrent protection of the max6.

Of course it´s only in these situations. Most of the time i´m riding only small inclines where you´re ok with less than 40A.

I´m not telling Vesc6 is weak, it´s just different and it´s an awesome point in the direction from the earlier 4.12 with it´s power.

I can understand why you would want a simple kick ass machine like max 6 and roxxy, but what you get from the vesc with a bit of a learning curve and some more steps in the setup is well worth it imo. 12S FOC Sensored Start up is something else entirely, especially for Mountainboards. Granted, i didn't test a regular ESC on a Mountainboard but only on a regular longboard and wasn't really impressed, throttle handling with the current control of the VESC is just way better.

I would always go with VESC 6 or a clone and some kind of proper enclosure. (well, mine is only 3d printed and silicone sealed but that works too)

As for alternatives, maybe Castle Creations ESCs? Haven't researched them a lot but only heard good things about them in the usual r/c applications.

I have a pair of Castle Mamba XL X on there way to me atm for a 8s build, should turn up any day now.

Yeah, I don't think Jens has any issues since modifying. I did add capbanks and some cushin underneath, but perhaps not enough. Think he also had them in an enclosure to keep out debris iirc. I certainly won't use 'em anymore though.

IMO 8S is plenty for off-road (at least for me it is anyway). A little too slow for street though.

I'll have to check it out. Does he have to push to get going? 

Would like to just stick with Max6 if possible. Keep trying to push the top end on my other build, but it seems like it's starting to lack in torque a bit off the line.

Yeah, been wanting to try out some of those big red beasts Jenso's been using. Shooting for ~35mph. Still wanna be able to stomp the trigger off the line and kick rocks though.

Planning on bumping up to Vesc6 here at some point. Honestly, the setup sounds a little intimidating though. Still learning my way around the electronics. Prefer to stick with the simple plug and play stuff at this point. Plus the price tag is brutal.
