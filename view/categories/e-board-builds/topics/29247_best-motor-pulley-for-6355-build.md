Hello was wondering if anyone can guide me in the right direction in choosing the right motor pulley for a 36t 9mm build with dual 6355 190kv motors. Any links to where I can buy it would be awesome too!

15t and 16t are super common. You can buy these at a lot of places, DIYes is where I bought my 16t pulley.

16t: higher top speed, 15t: better torque (acceleration / hill climbing). What battery setup are you using?
