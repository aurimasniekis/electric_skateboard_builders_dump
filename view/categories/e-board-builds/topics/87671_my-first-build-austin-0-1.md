Looks good to me (if you are aiming for a 12s battery). But I would include the loopkey in the positive "line" (just personal preference) :slight_smile:

Nope. Just solder your own. (Or are their any on hk? :slight_smile:)

make sure you *properly* solder, dont make cold joints.

connect them using 8/10 gauge wire, as long as youre not pushing more than 150 amps total continuous

A stoners worst nightmare.

clearly, /s

but seriously:

Its best to read on soldering before you attempt anything, and do it outside on a nice day. If something goes wrong and youre doing it inside you risk your entire house. Lipos are no joke...

Looks good. Could join means that there's no proper connection...Normally they seem greyish and not flashy (hopefully the correct word).. :slight_smile:
