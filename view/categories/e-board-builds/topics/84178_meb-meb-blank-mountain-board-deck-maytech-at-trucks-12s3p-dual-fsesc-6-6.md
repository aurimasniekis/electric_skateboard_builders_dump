Hey All!

It's been a while since I've done a build thread and though this one was worth sharing.
This build was done with parts I had laying around from other projects. I still plan on painting this board in all Black theme w/ the Miami Electric Board logo, and eventually plan on changing out the trucks and wheel for something not so cheap....

One note, the XT-90 plug on the bindings is **NOT** a loop key (Could be used for a loop key on on other board). It is a plug to extend the range with another 12S Battery. 
For example, a battery backpack or a box filled with batteries to go between the bindings. These are both options I will be exploring in the future when I have a little more time for this board.

Really like the mod on the bindings
Did you put them facing out in case of a fall?

Very nice idea with the integrated bindings ðŸ‘Œ
But iâ€˜m also curious why you placed the bindings in the center and not on the outside.
Which wires you used for the extension plug connection?
They look pretty slim on the picture.

In case you plan this be aware that the long battery wires can produce a voltage spike which could fry your esc.
