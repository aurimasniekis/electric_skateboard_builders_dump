Hi all ,is my setting right?
I found this setting the wire will touch the deck so hard.
Sould I Counterclockwise 90 degree the motor?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/e/9e5d2aa410bda21500858f985eadc1049d7e732f.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Yes. Having the wires come out towards the wheels and then back to your ESC would be the best way. Gives some slack for the wires to move around when you turn.

Just like @Pantologist said. Out towards the wheels and back gives the wires some wiggle room. I have it like that on both of my boards.

Like the others have said, backwards first then bend forward.

I had them facing forward on my first build, then I had to rewind the motors because they both shorted out because of the insulation rubbing off :p
