A little about me:
I am a college student who has been skating for some time now. I purchased my first pre-built esk8, a meepo 1.5 (loaded deck swap), about a year and a half ago. I realized that having an esk8 was so convenient as it helped me get to my classes and of course save gas. Recently my meepo totally took a phat ass L in the rain and hasn't worked ever since. It was a nice board with some imperfections (actually quite a few), but it was my FIRST esk8 and i will never ever forget the moment i first rode it. I have been esk8-less for quite sometime now, so the urgency of putting a DIY board doesn't really matter to me. (I plan to buy parts slowly/gradually so buying parts right NOW isn't important atm)
Anyways fast forward till now, I have been planning to put together a DIY board for the very first time in my life.
I aim to build an AT/Pneumatic esk8 that is willing to give me 20-30 mph (not really trying to reach 30, but extra top speed is fine), 10-15 mi range, dual 63XX setup, & a lipo battery setup (again let me reiterate I am a 'college' student so saving money is a MUST) 
So far the parts list I have compiled:
Chassis: MBS Comp 95 deck/Core Atom 90 deck
Trucks: Matrix II/ATS Trucks
Battery Pack: 6x Tattu 5200mAh 7.4V 15C~30C 2S1P Lipo Battery Pack
https://www.buddyrc.com/tattu-5200mah-7-4v-15c-30c-2s1p-lipo-battery-pack-with-deans-plug.html
or OPEN TO ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS (DEADSET ON A 12S BUILD)
Motors: 2x 6355 or 6374 (Open to any suggestions)

Haven't gotten to the gearing part yet (still researching), but I'm glad i got my first thread going!
Thanks in advance and pls be gentle

Main issue is the mtb trucks currently have a nylon baseplate which will snap. They are coming out with a metal baseplate

Honestly, I appreciate the advice!
But I am set on building on an mbs board (inspired by a mountain board type of look)

I actually read up on this as well!
That’s partly the reason why I’m in no rush to buy parts as well!

Welcome to the site @huyndreds , you will get a far better range of advice in this thread alone than i could ever give you in PM so bravo on starting this thread mate :)  as i said before take your time the less you rush the less expensive mistakes you will make, and you will end up with a better build/board.

I bookmarked this thread so i can offer advice (the little i know) as you go along... ;)
