Finally got my parts in for my first build, so here goes nothing!

I've waited over 2 months for all of my parts to come in, but they are finally here!

Landyachtz Top Speed 34" Longboard Deck
Dual TorqueBoards 5055 motors 190kv
Enertion motor mounts and pulleys
Dual VESC
Zippy 3S Lipo 25c 50000mah (run in parallel for 6S power)
GT2B remote and reciever
Caliber II 50 trucks
83mm Pink flywheel wheels (Pink wheels ftw!!!)
ABEC 7 bearings

I really wanted to build a long range board. So my idea was to use Torque Boards 5055 motors cause they work well with 6S power, and then when I have the money, build a large capacity 6S battery that will last. Maybe a 6s6p or 6s7p battery. Top speed isn't really a priority, so I opted for the 190KV for more torque, oppose to the 280KV. These 5055 motors are really small. I was surprised to see how small they were. I really hope that the small motor size and low KV doesn't end up making my board under powered, but I guess we will find out soon enough!


I bought a bunch of carbon fiber materials to fabricate a custom enclosure, which was a HUGE MISTAKE. With the amount of money I have spent on materials so far I could have just bought a carbon fiber deck from Enertion. I can't emphasize this enough. If you are seriously thinking of fabricating something from carbon fiber, DON'T!!. It is really expensive!!! And not worth the time and money.

My original plan was to make my own custom wood/carbon fiber deck. I was going to cut a hole in my Landyachtz Top Speed deck and lay a top layer of carbon fiber so most of my components could fit inside the deck. Soon I came to the conclusion that this was somewhat overly ambitious for my first build. So i decided to use the materials I bought to make a custom carbon fiber enclosure instead (even though buying an plastic ABS enclosure would have cost me a fraction of the price, man do I regret buying all these materials). In the future I may still build this deck, but for the mean time being I'm going to keep it simple.

Today I started working on my mould for my custom carbon fiber enclosure. It's not perfect but i think it will serve its purpose.

Here is a picture to give you an idea about how it might look like with the enclosure. Looks good so far!

Also, anybody here with experience in laying carbon fiber? I was thinking about covering the wooden mould in tape, so i can use the tape to make the mould sit flush with the board. I figure as long as i cover the tape with release agent, the enclosure should still release when the resin dries, and at the same time protect my board from any resin getting on it. Anybody think this is a good or bad idea lol? This is my first time laying carbon fiber.

@Namasaki  Thanks man. I'm really hoping since the board is wood that there won't be any interference. Worst case scenario, I will find a place to mount the receiver outside of the enclosure.

Ya, my build been a work in progress for long time.
I used to have mine mounted on the enclosure but then I would have to stop and flip my board to check battery.
Now I just look down.

Today I am going to attempt to lay the carbon fiber. I covered my wooden mould in tape and tapped it to the deck to make the enclosure sit flush with the deck. Then I covered the entire mould in release wax.

Then I laid 3 layers of carbon fiber, made a vacuum bag and vacuum sealed everything. It all went pretty smoothly.

NICE!  Looks like it'll be a great setup.  Couple things to comment on and somewhat late to the party...

1 - motors.  Dual 5055's should work great.  I ran dual 5065's (200kv's iirc) on an old setup and they worked GREAT for me.  And i'm huge (6'8"/2m and 265/120kg), so no small feat moving me along.  Gearing is key.

2 - CF.  I disagree somewhat.  yes expensive, but that's because you went vacuum (simplifies, but $$$).  Still a great project and skill to learn.

Also on CF/Epoxy - and likely too late if you've already begun - Packing tape and saran wrap/plastic-wrap are both good as the Epoxy doesn't stick!

Will follow and look forward to seeing this build!  Best of luck.

@sl33py this information is definitely not too late lol

Murphy's Law - Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.

So my first carbon fiber lay was a total DISASTER. I definitely spoke too soon when I said, "It all went pretty smoothly.". I was completely done, literally walking away, already patting myself on the back when i hear a "SNAP!!". When i came back I had seen that my wooden mould had collapsed. I screamed in frustration. I'm pretty sure the whole neighborhood heard me.

The epoxy I was using has a working time of 70 minutes. At this point, it was way past 70 minutes. I had no other choice but to open the bag and try to fix it. I was able to wedge some pencils underneath the wooden mould to support it, which was only semi successful. At this point, I was also out of vacuum bagging, so i had to try and recycle the old bag i used earlier.

Here was the result:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7af8f07536da4bdc506a97a1fd3d5d545858bcda.JPG" width="666" height="500">

If you look closely, you can see a dent on the right side where the wood is sagging.

On a positive note, this was a lot of fun and it was indeed a great learning experience, but now I am out of carbon fiber, vacuum bagging, and tape.

I really hope my enclosure doesn't turn out too bad. I would like to use this one for the time being until i get enough money to buy more materials and give it a second shot.

Thanks for the info @sl33py, I'll definitely look into packing tape and saran wrap.

S U C K !

sorry man - that's no fun.  Yeah, i was playing with vacuum bagging and it's pretty impressive how much force it exerts on the deck!  What i learned the first time is that Poly resin is AWFUL.  Stinks, doesn't stick to anything except itself... I ended up removing it from my board w/ just my hands and started over w/ epoxy the second time (and sanded to bare wood - i was an idiot).

I've since done some hand layup and will be re-trying some bagging next.  I started small w/ reinforcing (and cosmetic) on some simpler decks (better than the blank wood and a bit stronger).  Will be doing an enclosure next and might try vacuum again.  But using solid MDF to make sure and support it fully and not have any collapsing issues like you saw here.

Your bagging material may be re-usable!  Cut the butyl tape off of one side and if you have room to still squeeze the board in leave the other 3 sides?  Or if you have enough excess to make it a bit smaller but still fit?
release film - need new, but Breather fabric - you can use blue shop paper towels!  It's just there to soak up the excess resin.  Doesn't need to be the thick white fabric - just do several layers of the blue shop paper towels instead.

As for CF - i've found an ebay seller that has been really reasonable (not sure where you are at - likely only would work if in the US).  Elite Motoring.  I've also gotten from Fibreglast, but a bit more $.

Fingers crossed it's ok!

I have a ton of pics and stuff i've learned playing with CF and epoxy.  Using a quick copy/paste from @Rye's "Ballerina Badass" build thread:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/ballerina-badass-board-diy-build-first-timer/8036

[quote]
To stiffen a board is relatively easy (even i can do it...).  Like @lox897 said - Epoxy and CF or GF.  Realize that CF is conductive so you want to be careful (it also block RF so can affect Tx/Rx range or issues).  The sanding dust can short stuff - so sand someplace w/ good ventilation and clean up regularly (wear a mask etc.).

I'm a big guy, and i've used CF a few times now to help reinforce a board (or to make it look nicer).  This is all for me to learn how to do it better - so nothing is super polished but definitely functional.  I have an "ultimate" build in mind and i'm not willing to mess it up - so these are literally my practice runs!

First i did a simple top cover of an Omen Sugar (flat wires under GF like boosted) - not because of flex, and not because the bottom graphic is so amazing - mainly just to practice and wanted to have a clean middle w/o power wire running Fr -> Bk:
[img]http://goo.gl/SOZ9w2[/img]

I built a board for a buddy:
[img]http://goo.gl/gAWgV9[/img]
[img]http://goo.gl/vNiAQw[/img]
(in process - did top and bottom)

I recommend you cut the excess off (as close as possible to edge) when it gels - depending on your epoxy and temp (how fast it will cure) this can be 5-10min or an hour.  I used slow hardener, so usually about 35-45min:
[img]http://goo.gl/jgq5hp[/img]
[img]http://goo.gl/F717sl[/img]
(sanding is optional - especially w/ power tools be careful - i burned through an edge...)
I added a UV protectant spray paint coat to wet it after sanding and protect UV yellowing.
[img]http://goo.gl/fNPraf[/img]
Bit of Vicious grip on top (last i had in black w/ basic grip in middle)

Most recently i'm working on a hollow bottom setup on an Omen Chief.  A buddy at work had a CNC router and said he could hollow out the bottom for a nice finish, and kinda royally screwed it up.  Burned through a couple spots, so i filled them w/ CF scrap and am CF the top and bottom (it was pretty thin in the middle).  Super strong now and I definitely over-built the top.  12k CF is beefy and especially important to clean the edges while wet/gel vs when hard.  Good scissors when gelled, then dremel the edges as close to flush as possible before finishing with sander.  2 layers on most of the top:
[img]http://goo.gl/ICMHXn[/img]
The garbage bag underneath won't stick to resin so drips are easy to clean up.  A lot of sanding (wear gloves and long sleeves - very itchy!).  You can also use packing tape around the edges to avoid drips on the bottom - less to sand and cleanup later!

Good scissors are helpful.  Another great trick is to use a thin piece of painter's tape and cut down the middle of the tape.  It keeps the edges clean and from unraveling.
[img]http://goo.gl/8jbtHx[/img]

That's probably what i've learned to-date...  It's a lot of fun and really satisfying to see the end result on your board.  It will not turn a super flexy deck into a rock solid plank - but it will help stiffen.  You may still need to re-plan your wife's setup w/ that battery enclosure (no flex).

Will follow - good luck!

Hey @sl33py I meant to ask you, 1- What receiver remote are you using? There seems to be a lot of chatter around the forum around issues with these 2- Did you notice any increase in issues with the CF deck? If not did you come up with a work around somehow?

Hey Rye!  I have Kama/Weiceivers and GT2b's.  That's it.  GF loves the kama, but it does get drops in areas with lots of wifi interference (apartments along Alki where we ride).  She likes the thumb throttle and doesn't like the trigger of my badwolf GT2b's.

I don't have any CF enclosures yet.  I've only done the bottom and top surfaces, but no enclosures yet.  I plan on sneaking the Rx reception wire out a hole to get clear air and signal.

Here is where I shoved in some pens at the last minute to support the wooden mould after it collapsed. I cant believe I was able to salvage this disaster when it was well past the epoxy's working time. The lesson to be learned here is to never underestimate the strength of the vacuum. When i sealed it back up, I didn't have enough bagging to make an actual bag, so I had to seal it against the table, which caused the deck to flex when under vacuum pressure. Hopefully it didn't do any damage to the deck. It seemed to go back to its regular shape after I released the pressure.

Well after a pleasant experience with Enertion yesterday, I decided to keep my wheel pulleys.

I wasn't excited about modifying my trucks to get Enertion's pulley to fit. Thanks to @ra.rend who told me how to remove the bearing  from the pulley to get it to fit without modification. I added four 1 mm spacers to prevent the pulley from rubbing on the trucks and to give it enough spacing so the motors have enough room to fit.

The enclosure should hold up. It feels pretty stiff with 3 layers of carbon fiber, and they say CF is stronger than steel.

@treenutter asked me for some advice on carbon fiber materials. I'll post my response here in case anybody else is interested.

I know earlier I had advised against carbon fiber fabrication. I was only semi serious. It is still a very expensive procedure, but it can be a lot of fun, and it will definitely make your board stand out if done properly. I for one am really happy with how my enclosure came out, but really do wish I was a little bit smarter about buying materials.

Altogether I spent like $250 on materials. I bought the pump for $70 on amazon, which was the most expensive part. The next thing that killed my wallet was the shipping on all the individual items. The guy I bought my materials from on ebay (Elite Motoring) did not give me deal on shipping, even tho i bought like 7 items from him. I think he charged me the full price of shipping for all the individual items. I would highly recommend finding a local supplier, cause ebay will charge you a lot for shipping.The next mistake I made was buying unidirectional carbon fiber, in addition to regular twill carbon fiber. Unidirectional carbon fiber has really strong tensile strength in one direction. I was originally going to build my own longboard deck, and I was going to use the unidirectional length wise to strengthen the deck. I tried to use the uni on my enclosure, but I couldn't get it to form around certain corners very well. I also bought a roller that I didn't use. The paint brush I bought worked just fine. I also used maybe 15% of the epoxy i purchased. So don't buy a lot, unless you plan on doing a lot of projects.

So here is the break down:
Unidirectional carbon fiber - never used - $30 wasted
Fiberglass application roller - never used - $12 wasted

With that being said, here is what you will need:
Vacuum pump (mine is 4 CFM)
Twill Carbon Fiber fabric
Epoxy Resin (get an epoxy with enough working time so you can take your time, mine had a working time of 50-70 minutes, and make you buy one with a clear color.)
Mould Release (I used wax. I'm not sure if that is the best option.)
Peel Ply (i used POROUS TEFLON COATED PEEL PLY, it is extra smooth and will leave a much smoother finish when peeled.)
Vacuum breather/bleeder cloth
Vacuum bagging film
Vacuum tape
and Wood. (Don't forget you need wood  to build your mould. Wood cost money too!)

Note: As you can see in some of my pictures I used tape to make the mould sit flush with the deck. I used no-residue duct tape, which was not the best idea. When I spread the wax on the duct tape, it made the tape really wavy, which shows on the final product. When you vacuum your carbon fiber, expect every little detail to show through on your final product.

I still have to add another coat of epoxy to make it shinny, which I still have gotten to yet. The project is not finished!

With all that being said, I am told you can cut cost on materials buy using Packing tape and saran wrap/plastic-wrap as alternatives. I can neither confirm or deny this, so take it with a grain of salt.

Good luck!

How are you keeping the wheel pulleys in place with the bearing taken out? The bearing is what holds the pulley in place without it slipping off the wheel.

I still havent given it a test run. I'm still waiting on some parts. Right now it appears to stay in place without the bearing. If becoming loose becomes a problem, I was thinking about gluing the pulley to the wheel. Worse case scenario, put the bearing back in and modify my trucks.

Cool, good luck, the enclosure looks great. If it makes you any more confident, chopping the trucks is pretty easy with a dremel and doesnt take more than half an hour per side.

Nice writeup.  I also have some uni CF - great stuff but not the best for an enclosure (maybe inline single direction for covers or edges reinforcement).

I might add a black plastic washer under the wing to protect the CF from being vibrated and cut by the wing of that screw holding it down.

Besides another layer of epoxy, you can so do a simple clear spraypaint that is meant for UV (prevent yellowing).  Faster and probably cheaper.

http://www.krylon.com/products/uvresistant-clear-coating/
their clear gloss 1305:
https://www.amazon.com/Krylon-1305-Coatings-11-Ounce-UV-Resistant/dp/B00397STRW
$13.  You can sometimes find it at a local store (walmart, etc.) but usually stupid expensive (>$20).  Amazon is a good one for getting a decent price.

If you do another gel coat of epoxy - look for the hardener that is UV stabilized as it'll help with discoloration from UV.  (West systems 207 hardener).

Looks great man - look forward to seeing riding vids soon!

@Jinra Thanks, I might give it a shot.

@ArmandR I dont see the 34" anymore. All i see is the 36": https://www.amazon.com/Landyachtz-Speed-Longboard-Skateboard-Deck/dp/B017X4S07A/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1472516403&sr=8-2-fkmr0&keywords=landyachtz+top+speed+34

@sl33py Thanks, i think it needs another layer epoxy to cover a lot of the imperfections I made before I give it a layer of clear coat.

I was debating on where i should drill holes in my enclosure to run the motor wires through. Then I came up with the simple idea of leaving small gaps in the weather stripping to sneak the wires in between the deck and enclosure. Looks pretty clean.

I still plan on color sanding it to get rid of any imperfections, and then adding a layer of clear coat for a nice finishing touch. But for the time being, this will suit just fine. Look at how shiny it is!

Drove to 3 different hobby stores looking for a canbus connector, and turned up empty handed. However, I was able to find a 10-pin 2mm plug in my box of junk wires. So i chopped them into 2-pin connectors with a razor blade. Looks like these will work just fine.

Well after hours of soldering, I'm tired. But everything is finally ready to be connected. All I need to do now is learn how to setup up my vesc with BLDC tool. Any tips anybody may have for a first time VESC user is more than welcome. Would it be a bad idea to skip BLDC and go straight to FOC? Or should I start with BLDC since I'm a noob. They both seem pretty straight forward.

So after a few runs, here is my performance report:

These little 5055 190KV motors pack quite the punch. I couldn't believe how much torque they put out. I was almost thrown from by board the first time i rode it. Do not under estimate the power of these tiny motors. I didn't have any trouble climbing any hills. I took some really long steep hills on my run, and did not notice any heat problems at all. The motor barely even got warm. My only problem with these motors are that they are a little slow. About a solid 15 mph. But honestly, I was a little surprised how fast 15 mph felt, so that might be good enough. I was able to travel about 7 miles on my 5000mah lipos. Hopefully when I get my 6s6p battery, I can extend it to 21 miles.

Overall, I am very satisfied with my motors and 6s power. It would be nice to be able to reach 20mph, but I don't really feel like using a 10s battery. Id rather use a larger capacity 6s battery so i can travel longer distances.

Although 6s6p would be cool, it's not efficient compared to higher voltage systems. 10s will be more efficient, and therefore extend range as well. Just food for thought.

I meant to post this last week, but I have been a little mia in the forums lately.

But one of my nuts on the Enertion motor mount snapped.

If you look closely, the nut on the left is thicker than the nut on the right. The nut on the right is about to snap as well, you can see it start to bend.

Debating on whether or not I should waste my time with Enertion Customer Support. In the meantime, does anybody know what this nut is called so I can just replace it myself?

Here you can see the difference between the bolts. The bolt on the left has a much thicker head.

On another note. One of my vescs shorted, so this gave me the chance to ride around on a Mono drive setup. And I have to say, I am really impressed with these 50mm motors. Even on a single motor setup, there is still a lot of power, and I am still able to climb hills. Plus the board is lighter with only one motor so its easier to carry. The motor does get hotter than it would in a dual setup, but it still isn't that bad. 

I dont have any experience with 63mm motors, but to be honest I'm not sure I see any benefit to them at this point. I am definitely a 50mm motor advocate. But maybe one of you can shed a light on this subject. I have my eye on the Ollin Board OM5065. I really want to see what those motors can do. It's to bad I can fit them on my board in a dual rear setup, but I am warming up to Mono drive.

Also, I haven't tested it, but should I be getting a longer or shorter battery life with a mono drive?

Hmmm, I didn't really think about it at the time, but I was definitely doing more cruising on mono drive. I was actually surprised how little I actually needed the motor to get around. Sometimes I forget how well skateboards work on their own lol. But i definitely wasn't  holding the throttle down as much as I did with my dual drive, and I think I used less battery as a result.

My advice to anyone building their first eboard is to give mono drive a try first before spending twice as much for a dual drive setup. You might be surprised with the results.

My original plan was to upgrade to dual drive, but I realized that there's not a lot of San Francisco hills near me and you'd just confirmed that coasting is better with mono. Thanks! And I finally got the right settings that allow me to climb this hill near me(in BLDC mode it had no problem, but it struggles to reach the top while in FOC)

I mean I wouldn't go bombing mountains uphill on a mono drive, but mono drive can still definitely climb hills. If you plan on climbing a lot of steep hills than dual drive is probably the way to go.

My thinking is, if you are worried about climbing a few hills on a mono drive, don't. I just finish cruising all over town with my mono drive and didn't even really notice that much of a difference. It still took me everywhere i needed to go. 

With that being said, braking performance is drastically decreased on a mono drive. It will definitely help you slow down, but it certainly isn't any good at making sudden stops.

A little update. My board is finally complete after working on it for a few months! What a relief!! Now I can just enjoy the ride.

First off, I finally got some thread locker after losing 10+ screws. Hopefully I never have to deal with lost screws ever again. But I keep extra hardware in my backpack just in case.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/9/a9672f50d1a8fc7c8630fcd01aa06616d571092f.JPG" width="375" height="500">

Next, my 6s6p battery finally came in from @barajabali. It was a long wait, but still worth it.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/1/81205d013e3f886434a0a6876685f939b8053162.JPG" width="375" height="500">

I had to move the pcb for the power switch to the outside because it was making my pack a little too thick for my enclosure. Moving the power switch to the outside should benefit me in the long run in case I ever need to swap out batteries, I will still have a power switch.

 Added some weather stripping to the board to reduce the noise from vibrations.

Drilled and cut some holes for the charging port and LCD. I was able to cut a hole for the LCD using a razor. I didn't think it would be possible, but it was, and was super easy to do. I cut the perfect whole, and the LCD snapped right in, no glue necessary. I also added some grip tape handles to make the board easier to carry.

Drilled a hole for the power switch. I wanted to put the power switch on the other side of the enclosure, but the wires couldn't reach. I was to lazy to extend the wires, cause I am really tired of soldering stuff and didn't have the correct gauge wires anyway, So i made do with what I had. I put the power switch on the back of the enclosure near the motors. It's not the coolest location but it works.

I'm not sure to be honest. You can try messaging Enertions live support. They can probably tell you.

So with the exertion mount you have, was it easy fitting everything onto a caliber truck? The mount I have right now can barely fit a 9mm pulley on it without scraping against it. Ps I'm really liking your setup!

They didnt fit with the enertion pulleys. Caliber trucks need to be modified for the enertion pulleys to fit. I had to get pulleys from miami electric boards
