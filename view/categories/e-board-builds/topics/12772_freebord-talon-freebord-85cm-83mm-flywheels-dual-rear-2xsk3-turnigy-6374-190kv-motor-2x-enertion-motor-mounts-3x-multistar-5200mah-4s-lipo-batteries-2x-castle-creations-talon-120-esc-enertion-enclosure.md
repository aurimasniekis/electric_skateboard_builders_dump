This looks like a very solid build. But if the Talon 120 is like the Talon 90, you don't get adjustable braking, just on and off, so careful you get it set right or it will throw you right off the board (ask me how I know). Also, smother the two caps in hot glue, one of mine broke off after a few months of riding. It still works though with just 1 cap.

@NickTheDude @lox897  the mounts do fit the trucks. There is a gap, but when I tighten the mounts, they don't move and the hex screws through the mounts allow a solid fit. @mattdig If I use the driver card not the air card. That allows braking. Yea I was reading that the castle sometime loosen from vibrations a lot. So the hot glue should help from caps coming off.

Not sure that will work...The driving card is for car controllers. (it says so on the packaging) 

The talons are for planes/helicopters

Nice! I bought the stand alone enclosure for my Carbonated build and it was rewarding building my own 18650 battery and drilling holes for all the little things like power button, charger, LED meter. Definitely much easier, but less rewarding to buy the space cell pro 3/4!

I'm going to try and see what will happen. If the Talon doesn't work I'll use it on my MBS All-Terrain build , I have a separate braking system on that board.. I have 2 VESC's I haven't used yet. I'll use it if the Talons don't work.

You should be able to use any standard skateboard base plate, I used independent. They ride really well with big wheels the cornering response is great and doesn't diminish the bigger that you go too much. At a good price you can order them for about $20 per  hanger. Try and buy used base plates for a budget build. If you want you can change the king pin to a longer one but from my experience I didn't do a thing except for assembling them. You will need freebord's bushing kit its very important that you get it, they even have varying resistances.

Hi , this gonna be epic. love the board. but why don't it come with the holes? And the trucks, are they supposed to be hung like that? I think the bushing bolt(kingpin nut) is supposed to point outward , not inward?? Maybe I'm wrong. one more quetion :smiley: : Do you have to split those lipo to fit them in the enertion case?

The hangers are long enough to accommodate the wheel pulley. The hangers width is a little wide. But the clamps fit nice. A little gap in the clamps so I have to use longer hex socket cap screws or cut into the hangers. I'll try longer hex cap screws first. If that doesn't work then I'll cut into the hanger axle. Really don't want to but I will if I have to.  Used a standard truck base. The kingpin nut usually points to the outside of the board. If you look and see they point inside. The pivot pin points in that direction as well. Not in this case. Freebords are made differently. The pivot pins always point to the outside. There are pre-made holes but for Freebord trucks which are wider. So the holes don't match standard trucks. So I had to drill separate holes but in the same location as the regular Freebord holes. Was thinking about splitting the LiPos. At the same time was thinking about making a 10s or 12s battery pack. I'm currently working on two other e-boards as well. The other two I will be making fiberglass enclosures. It will give me time to think exactly what I want to do.

You said axle nut, but did you meant kingpin nut?  If so, that's because these hangers are traditional kingpin (TKP).  Most longboards use reverse kingpin (RKP).

I asked because I had planned on making my own mount.  I'm not a fan of the Caliber trucks (though I seem to be the minority in this regard).  I'm using Sidewinders, which are double-knuckle trucks.  Fortuitously for me, they use TKP hangers.  So I think I'm going to pick up a set of the Freebord hangers and use them with my Sidewinder trucks.  That way I get a wider stance, which means better clearance for my oversized wheels, and I can now use Enertion mounts.  Win, win!!!

Thanks for posting.  You've made my day.  :smiley:

Your welcome. Been thinking bout this for awhile. I was always taught if you don't try you will never find out. I'm willing to try anything. That's what this hobby is all about. Hopefully someone might be willing to make some motor mounts that fit snug for me. Hint hint lol.

I had to order longer hex socket cap screws. Went to Home Deposit the threads didn't match. They didn't have metric threads. So I'm just waiting on the screws to arrive. Once I get them I will mount and take picks. Will see how well they work.

I received the hangers, and although the axle does stick out far enough for the nut to get a start on it, there is not enough thread engagement for my comfort, so I'll be cutting it.

Also of note to those considering this, the Freebord hanger isn't quite compatible with standard bushings.  The seat is of a larger diameter, as is the kingpin hole.  Although you could assemble everything with standard bushings, this allows the hanger to move around and results in a vague and generally awful feeling when riding.  Steering responsiveness is sluggish and imprecise.  As mentioned by the original poster, you should definitely get the Freebord bushings (and washers!) because they resolve these issues, tightening up the steering and providing much better responsiveness and control.

Did you use some sort of tutorial on how to measure the right position distance for the truck holes?

I plan to drill truck holes in a regular skateboard deck but Im a bit afrraid that I might mess up and the holes / position won't line up and one truck will stand sideways or something..

I do know it is probably based on logic and just basic carpenter skills but I wish there were some tools/methods on how to take the correct measurements to position the trucks precisely where they should be..

OK.  Sorry guys, but the information I provided in my previous post was incorrect.  I have edited that post to contain the correct information.  I did that to avoid confusion for anyone who reads the thread later.

I can't imagine what it would feel going full throttle from a dead stop, I need to see this board in action.

Did you have to cut the hangers in order to fit the Enertion mounts?

Is the pulley kit from Enertion?

Did the Enertion wheel pulleys ABEC 11 addapter fitted the ebay wheels perfectly?

As of now the enclosure is empty. Didn't have to cut hangers. Did order longer hex cap skrews for hangers width. Works wonderfully, fits nice and very sturdy. The pulley kit is from Enertion. The Enertion on eBay pulley wheel works well together. The belt and pulley width is 12 mm. The wide trucks and the boards rides well great on turns. Good board and motor clearance with 1/2 inch pad adapters Which are led flashing lights. Range and speed, have no idea or thought. We will see as we proceed. Stand still to full throttle. I have no idea. We will see.😅 Cause of holiday season been spending time with family. Hard to work on board, work and family at the same time. But every now and then. I will put a little more board time.

Have you loctite'd the screws on the motor? Whats the process for doing that (timeline wise), should it be done right away with a brand new motor or after some usage?

Great looking build, would recommend flipping the trucks around.

Looks like it would be a lot of fun drifting around corners with that kind of width.

I have an old freebord here that I'd like to use as a base for my first esk8.

What would be the pros and cons of using such a wide hanger vs a more regular longboard wheelbase ?
```

Does a freebord turn very well? The kingpin angle looks very shallow compared to what a typical longboard would be(40-60*)

My understanding of freebord mechanics which is arguably not much is that turning happens more like how a snowboard turns. Without the center wheel does it act just like a longboard with wide trucks?

Edit: Disregard just read where you said you used indy baseplates.

Have you tried to ride it?, you put the trucks backwards (that is a TKP), it will go to other way when you turn.
