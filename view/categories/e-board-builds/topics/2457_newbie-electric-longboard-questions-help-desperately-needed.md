Hi,

So, I just got into electric longboards. Being a person with a tight budget, I decided to build my own. Luckily, I also had several longboards parts. 

Rayne Amazon longboard deck
Orangatang Kegels wheels
Paris 180 trucks

So I have all of those parts, however, I still need everything that makes this little monster run. I have purchased following:

15t motor pulley
36t wheel pulley, 9mm wide
10mm wide belt

I just realised this might not work out. If interested, my weight is 65kg and there are literally no hills where I live. Do you think this will work? I'm slighty nervous about the 9mm wide belt, since it's a one-motor longboard.

Thanks,
Victor

I would recommend getting a 30c battery and a 245kv ish motor, because you have no hills and it will allow some more speed. You will need a motor mount, esc, and wireless transmitter. To complete the build. Also how will you mount the pulleys? I will post some pictures of mine later if you want

Don't worry about the 9mm belt. I have been riding on single motor 9mm belt set-ups and I weigh about 75kg. Have only broken one belt in 1.5 years.

So you don't think it will be a problem? 

I purchased this one: http://www.hellray.de/shop/#!/eSkateboard-Pulley-für-Blank-Wheels-32T-oder-36T-für-9mm-Zahnriemen/p/64388595/category=15255001

It's with 36 teeth. 

Have you had any issues with it slipping off the pulley?

@AutoHax0r I don't think that the 10mm belt will last very long on a 9mm wide pulley, the edge of the metal will dig into the belt and ruin it. Luckily, it's an easy $15 fix; just get a 9mm belt. It's good practice to have a spare belt on hand anyhow (I keep one in my pack just in case, although I've never actually broken one!)

Wheelpulley width is 12mm, so a 10mm belt fits as well.

The motor pulley has to have double flanges, and so you won't be able to use a 10mm belt.

if you need a good belt & pulley kit check **[this](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/9mm-wide-drive-pulley-kit/)** out, probably the best value option.

@AutoHax0r ,  gotta agree with @onloop its a very good deal.
All my future boards are going to be using that system.

I'm back guys!

Would this battery be good for my e-board?

http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__84150__MultiStar_LiHV_High_Capacity_6S_10000mAh_Multi_Rotor_Lipo_Pack_EU_Warehouse_.html

I'm a bit concerned about the discharge rate, but since it's so many milliamps, it may work?

I'm going with:

150A Car ESC
2400w Motor

Thanks!

10000 mah ... 10c

I'd pass

I'd look for something at least 25c and higher 

Split the pack to two 5000 mah or 6000mah
What U have is a brick

I semi-agree with @Michaelinvegas, but I have used these batteries in a couple of boards without an issue. I think as long you don't push it too hard you would be fine. If you plan on full throttle runs you'd definitely be better with a higher discharge.

Lol who wouldn't push their board too hard?

Get a higher c rating so you don't have to ride like a little girl (I have two little girls so I should know) lol

The only 8s ESC's on HobbyKing I would suggest would be the HobbyWing MAX6 or MAX5. I have had two of the Turnigy 8s car ESC's and both had problems.

Actually, do you think 8s is worth it over 6s? Considering prices for ESC's. Is there a big difference in speed?

I'd say punch in all your variables into this calculator: http://toddy616.blogspot.com/2013/07/electric-skateboard-calculator.html?m=1

I predominantly use 6s.

Update:

Got my 9mm pulley today. I tried attaching a photo with it, hope you guys can see it? 

It does look quite thin, but I hope it'll work out. Sort of regretting buying it this instead of 15mm.

Thoughts?

Hi, 

last week I had the honor to check out an dual motor esk8 and I was overwhelmed by the power and speed. 

Because of limited budget I won't be able to build such a rocket what I had under my feet last week, so my question is: Which motor would you recommend or are there any other motors not mentioned which will do perfectly well in a hilly area and need for around 35 km/h topspeed. 

[quote="evoheyax, post:1, topic:2983"]
Motors

Enertion’s R-Spec II 6355 190kv
Enertion’s R-Spec II 6372 190kv
DIY’s 6355 230kv
DIY’s 5065 170kv
DIY’s 6374 230kv
Psycotiller’s 5065 270kv sensored
Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 6364 213kv (and all 260kv or less)
Turnigy G160 (limited to 10s - optional choice, highly recommend SK3 if you can get it)
NTM Prop Drive 5060 270Kv (and all similar low kv NTM Prop Drive)
Tacon Big Foot 160 5335 245kv
Tacon Big Foot 110 5325 295kv
Maytech Motors MTO6365‐2xx‐G 10mm shaft (and all 270kv or less)
NTM Prop Drive 5060 270Kv motor

Thx in advance for every answer.
