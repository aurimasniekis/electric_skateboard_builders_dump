Hi everyone!
I have made some boards until now but never made a build log.
I actually started making instructables with my first 2 builds so I decided to do the same for my last 2 boards!

The instructables contain a lot of pictures how I made my boards.

Thanks guys for all the information/tests/pictures on this amazing ESK8 builders forum!
