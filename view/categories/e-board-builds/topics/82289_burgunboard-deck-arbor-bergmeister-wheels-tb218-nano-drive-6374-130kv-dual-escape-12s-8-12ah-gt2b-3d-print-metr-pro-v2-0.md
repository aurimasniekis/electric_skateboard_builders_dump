### TB218 and Bergmeister looks like a perfect combo 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pic_0191-2lll.jpg

## The Nano drive that perfectly fit the Bergmeister wheels !

(no it's not working fine enought with only 5mm clearence ^^ ) 
We have to wait for some mega senor Pepe of 120 mm :smile:

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pic_0038-311.jpg

I made an adapter to set the Bergmeister wheel with the FatBoy Nano Gear Drive, 3d printed for the first tests : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pic_0043-411.jpg
And a nice full aluminum CNCed proto version of the adapter coming, beginning of the week, if some are interested please let me know, I going to have a nice price for 10 sets : 
The AL version will look like this : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/rps20190122_143225.jpg

Ok, back to the setup : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pic_0045-611.jpg

Motor shaft ok, now the keyway :sweat_smile:
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pic_108711.jpg

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pic_108911.jpg

Nice ! 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pic_0046-511.jpg

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pic_107811.jpg

And, tadaaaaa : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pic_0175-2ll.jpg

Hand spinning test ok, it's time to connect it really soon !
### Power : 
The rest of the electric parts are the same as what I use before on ma Darth Vapor eMTBoard (v6, motor Overion, 12s XAh 15c...), so it should be a fkg awesome setup !!

Next big things needed, **the enclosure !..**
And some @pixelsilva inspiration :wink:    

_to be continue_ :v:

[quote="Riako, post:1, topic:82289"]
TB218 and Bergmeister looks like a perfect combo for more speed and power, than the last Supercarve setup:
[/quote]

Could you elaborate on this point please? Were the supercarve trucks not stable enough for high speed? Or are you just saying that this gear drive should be superior to the chain drive?
```

I say it above all to persuade me of my change, but all of a sudden, all of you are riding pretty well! :smile:

For sure, I will say more and even more in a few days :blush: when I have tested them.

(For now, it's just like I say, mostly how he looks like to me... I would say both: supercarve not stable enough on my setup and gear drive will be quieter and proofed in his cover (even if I don't think that the nano is superior to the big chain ^^) but we will see.
I have made some custom change of bushing on the Supercarve, they're really great letting me ride on all terrain at a good speed and the turn radius and carve is super cool.
What I really like was the mounting support welded.
I just hope to get a more stable setup (it should not be hard).
More speed and power for sure with a lower ratio and bigger motor and battery.)

Thinking about the deck,

and as you can approximatively see on photos above and below, the shape is beside the Nano drive (and the wheelbite could be huge with the Bgm) :

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pic_0188-2ll.jpg

It is already a little bit custom (just the noses and the shape in the midst) but, most of the custom that I have initially planned or needed to let space for Bgm are saved by @pixelsilva inspiration on my last build.

I had to make some mounting brackets, like that (for both front and rear) :

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/burgunboard-v1-arbor-axis-bergmeister-wheels-supercarve-truck-5065-140kv-dual-fsesc4-20-10s-5ah-gt2b-3d-print/76023/18?u=riako

As I want to keep the shape exactly the same, intact, with the dropped zone that help me to lock my big foot on this wide plus W concave deck, it is perfect with this solution and it will give me a bit more stability.

Prototyping in a piece of wood that hangs there just to get the good lenght :

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pic_0306-2ll.jpg

I will try to DIY some with some material I can get around.

And for the front, I plan to make a short one, like @nuttyjeff on the Charger build to keep my feet the closer to the front wheels.

Next stape, always the enclosure ... :v:

Nano-drive gears were not made to drive big wheels, you will probably grind the gear teeth's... Imagine that the bigger the wheel the bigger leverage you put on the gear teeth

Hey,
I see only big urethane wheel ?
But they're the smallest we can get with air !..
10mm w isn't enought ?

Don't know we never designed or experimented with pneumatic wheels for these drives. These are urethane gear drives with max wheel size estimated 110mm. If something happens its up to you

Ok thanks !

And the Mini is estimated for whitch one ? 
![IMG_1480|666x500](upload://bjEyUFjpRYRIZCjJyTDtE8aNOvX.jpeg) 

I'm more confidente in your work than you :smile: if it's just estimated so I will test it for you ;)  
And no worries, I'm prototyping, I will ride it carefully in a controlled environment :+1: 
So I can tell you if I will probably or not grind the gear teeth’s faster (or not so much).

What is the conventional wear ?
For how many km you estimate the gears teeths of this kit ?

I have over 5k miles on one of older gears little wear, these uses better plastic which is suppose to have even less wear :) So with normal wear I expect these to last forever.. (greased and taken care off) Batteries will not hold that much probably

What width ?? on which setup?
with that, your estimate seems to be seen bein down.

But I'm really entrusted with the Nano, I have to give it a try and we will see next WE !
The blank test is already perfect of course :sweat_smile::rofl::shushing_face:

But, does that mean that you do not sell gears only as spare parts for the future @Kug3lis ?

I really need some Sender reborn deck power here !!! :sweat_smile: (Sorry to anoy you guys maybe you know what to do @Sender @treenutter @mmaner @drangboards :pray:) 

What do you think guys, I have finally clean this lady and, she looks like old and wrinkled :

I will try to send all and re-resine with a brain new grip at the same time, is it going to lessen the cracks preview ? Or should I add a thin layer of fiber glass on top of that ?
What you will do ?

Put through this, I have received my alloy adapter !!
I have redesigned it from scratch with a more simple profile for production work (and economic) than the printed model, it's CNC from a 7075 bloc :

@Riako The veneer that is cracking is probably a 1/32' or 1/64" ply - about as deep as a sheet of paper. I'd be surprised if you can sand away those cracks before you hit the next ply.

**Riiight !**.. exactly, it's like super super thin if I compare to the maple ply !!! **Thanks a looot for your advices** :wink: :+1:

Ok, so, I will try to send the grip only and, try some gorgeous looking LHB / Sender's grip-style ! 
I hope that the resin will lessen or re-color the cracks as before (even just a little bit) :crossed_fingers:

Ok, so during this time I have the Axis but bamboo :smile: to try this setup asap

@Riako you can use a sanding sealer to physically fill the cracks. After a light sanding apply the sealer and then sand it down to a smooth surface. Then you can re-stain it if you want to, or just let the resin you use for the grip to darken it.

Maybe try (Liberon wax sticks) french polishers use it/them to hide/fix small or large cracks/gaps in wood veneers, i used it a couple of times on piano restorations and other projects never on a deck but it should work, plus its easy to use and very little work in terms of effort and mess.

**Thank you very much for your help and your advices!**

And thanks a lot mate ! For sure I will make reports ;)
I plan to test it on the kart track 1st then, I will make like for the Bergmeister wheels/tires, little control check and photos every 100km.

As 3Dservisas expect that their new plastic solution last forever, but Kug3lis got some reluctance and fear of small wear/teeth grinded... I guess (hope) I'm ok for the next 2500kms :crossed_fingers: :smile:

Edit: also what did you put between the mounting plate and the cover of the gear drive?

[/quote]

As I have play with some prototyping (Gummies and Bgm wheels on the Nano), I made a mistake and Loctite the motor gear too early ... and I'm too lazy for now, I prefer to make a little bit of modelization than burn the gear and axle.
But I will have to do it anyway like I would test it with 15° more.
Be really careful Nano Gear Drive Rider when you blank test your setup, be sure about the orientation, cause when you loctite your motor gear, you will maybe not play every week with a rebuild or make another prototype, test another deck... Well exactly what I am doing ^^

I don't know how, as the gears are well aligned but the motor gear grind a bit sometimes the cover so I made a little 1mm lip for now.

1st I had made a cover that let me keep my axle uncut :sweat_smile: but, ok, it is a bit weird, and I was maybe ashamed to show that I guess :smile: but it could help a lot at 1st.
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/3sd_covur-v11.png
I maybe should start like this (as I have enough space between the wheel and gear cover)...

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/pic_0k98-5.jpg

I like the gear icon on it, but I guess the PVC cover have better soundproof characteristics so I let it for now.

Ho, I don't even know this exists!! Awesome, thanks a lot mate!!
I learn a lot, it's awesome I watch some video of this, looks like the way to make a perfectly professional look :+1:

I just dont find the exact detail I need to know with it :upside_down_face: 
You apply layer by layer (I almost only find video this way) or you fill all the crack in one deep pass ?

Yeah, awesome tips too !!
This is also super cool when you really want to match the repair as if nothing happens! I see it now, there is nice video on youtube too.

I will check what I could get in my DIY store tomorrow!

Oops, I was a little too fast on this one :no_mouth: Maybe I have sanded it to mush before to take note of all of this ... (and I want to sand the logo too)
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/pic_0k20-2.jpg
a smooth little second pass tomorrow before sanding-sealer or wax.

I really like the patinated effect, like an old hotrod in its juice :P 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/pic_0k19-2.jpg
a second sanding here too tomorow and then I will try to add a yellow juice to maybe get a green patined underdeck finish :grin:

Thanks a lot once again to all for your sharing :smiley:
 **I have to make this with Burgundy wine bottle !!!**

So, more thing to prepare :

* make the easiest and fastest way a smasher! :clipboard: (to do) 
* find the nice color of glass (like the right one, more green than yellow) :white_check_mark: (done easy ^^)

Hey guys !

Some more steps are done :)  

2nd pass of sanding done, then a little cleanup and it's already a bit better
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/pic_01039.jpg

I don't find sanding sealer around me, I have to order it.
During this, I have turned the blue into... not really green, but something beautiful that I really like and will keep like this for now :P 
_Before_
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/pic_01100-2.jpg
_During_
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/pic_01101-2.jpg
_After_
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/pic_01120-2.jpg

I would have preferred the deep blue/green finish, but it's good too, maybe the varnish will darken it a bit.

---

Also, like the build take more time than expected like usual, I have stolen the HagXis deck to make my firsts tests :blush:
And make a quick masterpiece enclosure for instant testing :smile: 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/pic_01134-2.jpg 
Of curse, nothing comparable in riding style ...
It was a cool cruise, less than 30kmh max.
I have to ride it every day now and see how the drive and tooth handle it.
But wow, It workes perfectly! The power is instantaneous!! And I got my brakes back, it's awesome.
Quieter than the chain kit for sure.
Everything has changed, even the deck is not the really the same in bamboo! Less camber, stiffer, I really need a wider deck in the future !.. Red-embission :blush:... 
The trucks are super turny, I have to work on that. 
The power ... is insane coming for my little Evolve like setup since this summer. I have almost forgotten how my 6374 130kV under v6 works :crazy_face::call_me_hand: BADASS with foc sensored
The fun is back !!!
The drive sounds good, I supposed. It's my 1st straight tooth gear drive so, I will post a video before the WE I guess. 
In 40 or 90km, I will re-open the drive to see how it looks, but so far so good!
:v:

Ok, I haven't the right count, didn't set telemetry yet, but I should be around 30km. So, tomorrow or this WE, I will try to push it a bit more aggressively on the track and see..
But I'm really impressed with the torque and power-brake I got directly now!

I have to work on the bushing setup ... dam this thread is so loonnng :smile: 
I'm happy to ride RKP again, and with the news Bergmeister. But for my AT used the Supercarve was (way) better, just my firsts feeling. I have to ride more and work on that.

If you want a good bushing set up, I use a 90a Riptide fatcone street side and 95a barrel board side for the back of my board, and then I have a standard barrel boardside 92a and a cone 92a. It's so stable and gives the rights amounts of carve at 160-170lbs. 

(i have TB 218 and Bermeisters on a hummie deck :) )

Hi Charles, thx for your advices ! Your setup looks so good too !!
I have some Krank barrel (but short if I remember well) and some other venom shr to try on it.
Also, I will surely set the rear baseplate to 40° instead of 50.
And I let the Nano GD on his straight position to maybe test the setup droptrough if possible :yum:
But I really really like to get back to rkp on street road, I got a better feeling, but still not in AT.

Some photos :

Hey esk8ers !

Just a little cruise around the block first tests :v: :sunny: 
https://youtu.be/nTpHfPR1eLg

The setup is really good, even with the trucks loose, but this afternoon, test ride with some Venom SHR and a little tighter.

After that, it will depend on the tests, I want to try thropthrought and then with the rear truck at 40°

Time to swap the 8Ah pack for the 12Ah and make an enclosure ... :smile:

Hey e-riders,

Nothing new,..

I did nothing but take the time to ride :sunny:

https://youtu.be/9ZgazFgp9rU

[spoiler]turn on your subwoofer if you have one :grin:[/spoiler]
I had fun trying my new cam with my DIY stick who is almost invisible :sweat_smile:

I should be between 50-100km on this kit. Still not take time to open it, but I will soon.
The stance on this 40" deck is finally to short for me, 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/capturehhb.jpg

I can't wait for some maybe Redember news ^^
I think I will keep this Arbor Koa for pushing.

I will maybe give another chance to this one during the waiting :P

I was looking for some enclosure inspiration but, nothing special came out
![dropbox%20v4x|690x388](upload://o2C0fq9u8xXX628EjVMCAP2HKqa.jpeg) 
The printing time is too long for the after-work needed to make it strong and good looking,
so I'm just going to make a foam mold and vacuum press directly on the deck.

:v: Good Friday to all !

Hey riako, how's the flex on the Axis ? 
Bad or worse, or okay-ish ? (stiffer the better)
I got a super stiff and straight battery, it might be the killer factor

Hum, hard to say, first it's not the same on the koa or the bamboo one ... and the camber too.
But it's a middle soft flex I would say, not to much flex, but a bit comfortable (less than an Icarus, more than a Trampa 16 ply ^^ - I'm around 80kg equipped).

... ah yes for a stiff battery pack, if it's a long one and not stacked it could be difficult. Maybe with a super strong enclosure like the trampa tray (it's very stiff) you could stop the flex of the board ^^ But put a lot of screws! :smile: well it doesn't sound like a good idea too ..

I hope I can make an enclosure this WE ... we will see, to much things to do in two days !

Hey! Yes, I think (if the shape if complex) if not I simply do it outside then I let it under the sun, it's the best way... in summer...).
But in winter, I try to get a room at around 30° and I let it dry 24/48h with a decreasing temp... It all I can do, and for sure it's not the best but it works for 4 yrs now ^^

What I made for my SWE enclosed deck, is put it in a cardboard box (carton) with a little heaven or a heating bulb... 

@Balta_6 , if I got the money it will not be these deck (I took them because 120€ for both was a good deal, plus they looks good), but a longer, stiffer and more shaped one will be my next (little dropped/lowered too if possible or dropthrought!

Redember, or enclosed decks (they're 4 or 5 to choose from now ! :D ), or a LandYatch Switch, or those chinise deck at around 30$, you could also take something else, like a some Prism Origine v2 style and customized it at your need!! I do it on almost all my deck ^^

Or you add 2 layers of wood plus carbon fiber crossed to rigidify all !

The best way could be to make a copy in 9ply ... easy with a roarockit. I use the same principle for my custom deck. And if you use the right epoxy you could get a crowbar ;)

Its gonna take/cover all the under-deck!

But the 2.99€ mounting-plate are set ^^ (And for now the front is as far as the rear, not what I want, but it will change one day). 

And again, I guess I have lost a lot of thing in this move ... I can't put my hand on all my vacuum parts this time !! Grrrr
If I don't get them all this WE, nevermind, I will make it vacuumless 1st :laughing: no money for that right now! It will come with the integrated cruiser maybe.

_To be continued :v:_

whats the acceleration like with the nano drive on the bergmeisters?
How does the drive handle the larger tyres rather than going for the mini drive with a 2.4:1 ratio  

And most important is it still faster than a boosted board :) ??

Hi JJ,

It's way better than the previous build, but I can't really say ...

I pass : 
- from dual chain drive with 2.89 : 1 with dual FSESC4.2 and 5065 140kV at 10s
 - to Nano Geared with 2.57 : 1 with dual ESCape and 6374 130kV at 12s

So I got a lot more torque than before ^^ now it's fun again !
For now, it handles it pretty well I think, but be careful, it's at your own risk as saying Kugy "_we never designed or experimented with pneumatic wheels for these drives... If something happens its up to you_!"

I'm around 50kmh top speed (12s, 130kV, 2.57:1, 145mm wheels) ;)

Sorry for the late reply mate !
I have quickly I guess, but I updated the 1st post when finally using the Arbor ... and now I'm changing again :sweat_smile: I will make another update soon so.

 - It's an old Madrid asymmetrical DH deck, 9 plies, little dropped, W concave.
 - And I have customized a bit the shape, Break the block appearance by lightening the center of the deck, also make it symmetrical now. And I send it all. I think I will let the natural wood like the finishing.

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/pic_01137-2.jpg
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/pic_01138-2.jpg
(the deck is shorted (compare to the Axis), and maybe it is still a bit shorter for my stance, but I should be able to put my feet a bit rejected, as the shape gave me more place to use finally... I hope to be understandable ^^)

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pic_0191-2ll.jpg

- Yes, I have to go with extended mounting plates because I don't want to cut the shape and it will be where the "dropped wave" is located (the space that I will use as gas-pedal/ foot stop), and I want to let it full size now I can enjoy a wider deck! ^^

But with riser, I guess it should work fine. What I could do for the front,.. but the rear I want to keep it longer to be a bit more stable maybe, I have to test it. As I could also pass the rear at 40° ... we will see after the futures tests !!

You should maybe choose a deck that has the perfect length, wide, flex, and shape you would like under your feet. Then customized it to work with the Berg (if it's needed!)...

I have finished the mold today, hope to vacuum it one night this week !!!

I will post photos later :v:

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/img_20190325_23o246.jpg
I put it roughly under the vacuum ... 
And seeing the last eboosted mastering build (the red longboarghini :blush:) I add some printed part, just like I did [yrs ago](https://monlongboardelectrique.wordpress.com/2016/06/10/e-pintail-original-longboard-40/)

This time I try basalt fiber as a finish layer
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/img_20190327_19o556.jpg
2 big fiberglass layer, 1 small and 1 of basalt, all quickly roughly made...  
not the best, but after a little finishing glaze is should be good ^^

from 12s 5Ah to 12s 12Ah, passing by 12s 8Ah if I want. All should fit in.

Now that the sun seams to be back, I will paint it ... but I dont have black anymore, so I will paint it with some colors I got laying around for now :sweat_smile: it's going to be "funny" !!

Good Sunday :v:

Thx ^^

No, I have never gathered all the necessary material... Even if I'm not very far!   
Did you ??

This one was made really quickly (I just let the pump during an hour or so, and then 1/4 hour during the 4 1st hour... after it was to late in this new apartment ^^).  
The top basalt was a test too. I think it needs 2 layers (by what it was not stored properly on my 1 layer test, the fiber is not very regular (bad storage) and we can see holes... This leaves a lot of fiberglass apparent. Surely that painting the inside of the box in the same tone would be a good idea if not).

As long as I would not find a shoe, I mean a deck on my foot, I will not finish the setup definitely :blush:   
But with the longer stance, the wider deck, and way more shaped ... it should feel good :crossed_fingers::P  

---

For now, I will set battery holders inserts and the inserts for the enclosure into the deck,    
Paint the enclosure : inside / outside,      
Also, as I will use the dual ESCape for the road-trip, I got time do to all this ... it will not roll before almost 2 months I guess :sleepy: :kissing_smiling_eyes:
