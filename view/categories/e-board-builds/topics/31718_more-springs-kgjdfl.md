Looks cool @Hummie, I'm still trying to work out why, but it looks cool :sunglasses:

I'm confused why they said "california" when they are out of melbourne?

They seem confused.

I put this up as it reminded me of the guy on here who was selling his springs that can be mounted on a regular trucks.  His sales pitch was classic with stuff he'd never even tried and huge claims and he was given hell...but this  "looks" much better.  I dont trust how it's got two seperate pivot points for the axle yet but have no idea.    seems a weird twisting would have to happen and the axle couldnt be held solidly while having two separate axle supports.  but i just talk without having even looked at a video.
