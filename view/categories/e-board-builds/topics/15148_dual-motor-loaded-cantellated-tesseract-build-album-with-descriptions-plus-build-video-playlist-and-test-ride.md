HI all, i have finished my DIY board i have been working on. i have put about 60 miles on it so far it it works great. i made a post on reddit and it was rather popular so i thought you guys might like to see it here. there is a photo album with descriptions, a full build how to playlist, a shorter inspirational build video and a test and range video.

the total build cost was Â£650 but most of that was spent on the deck trucks and wheels. i made most of the stuff myself but had to purchase motors and speed controllers.  

Dual motors are Alien 6355 190kv 
Dual VESC`s
Diy battery is 33v 14ah made from used 18650 cells 
the board is a loaded cantellated tesseract
the trucks are 195mm paris trucks 
80mm kegal wheels. 


now before anyone starts telling me 18650 cells will kill me and the battery is dangerous it isnt, i have made many batteries like this and i am still alive. and on top of that not one of them has had any issues all i do is keep them balanced and they work just fine. they dont get hot or blow up so please keep the "you will die" comments to a minimum. like i said i have done 60 miles so far in the Spanish sun so its had a good test and im still here to tell the tail. that being said i would not advice someone to copy my battery design as there are risks involved with using second hand cells and soldering them is not recommended care must be taken to get correct balancing and each individual cell must be tested. these videos are to show how i did my build if you want to copy then you do so at your own risk.

That's what made it so great. Thank you for sharing. All of our skateboards are similar, but a lot more work went into yours.

yea saw this blow up on /r/diy

a lot of people talking shit about the loose collection of 18650s in the pack but who cares.

great build, working towards one similar to it.
