I've been lurking for quite some time, reading until I've got enough funds for a decent build. I want to build an "Evolve" type board - can switch between AT pneumatic tires and ABECs. Budget is $1500, pushing $2000 when/if needed.

**DECK**: Evolve GTX Deck / [DB Freeride DT 38"](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-build-db-freeride-dt-38-evolve-trucks-dual-6355s-190kv-custom-10s4p-30q-focbox/37352) / [Hummies](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/hummies-wood-and-carbon-decks-imported-into-the-uk-eu/48322) (if it's still available)/ _Other Suggestions and why_

**TRUCKS**: Surf Rodz RKP 200mm + 70 x 10mm axles / TB 218mm / [I could wait for ](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/any-interest-in-169mm-and-220mm-cnc-hangers-for-caliber-baseplates/54017) @Brad's  | _Other suggestions and why_

**WHEELS**: ABEC 107s / Evolve AT Kit / Trampa Superstar Hubs 6.5 Urban Treads / _I really don't know the compatibility of these wheels with my truck options with surf rodz being my 1st pick so please educate me_

**MOTORS**: Dual 190kv 6374s - I'm not sure where to source them yet so open for suggestions

**ESC**: FOCbox or ESCape

**BATTERY**: 30Q 10S3P / 30Q 12S3P

**MOUNTS**: Would depend which truck is best among my options


As you can see, there's still a lot to fill. If you have any suggestions or advice, I'm all ears. I'm really hoping to get a lot of feedback from you guys. THANKS!

For decks you (maybe) should consider [this new one I got](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-build-db-freeride-dt-38-evolve-trucks-dual-6355s-190kv-custom-10s4p-30q-focbox/37352/91) . Very similar with the Freeride DT 38" but at 39" and without the micro drop.

Actually, giving your choice of trucks, it might not work with AT wheels .... they might be too close or maybe even touch the edge (Evolve trucks extend outwards and you get a longer wheelbase because of that).

Depends on how long you can wait.

After I get the prototype, I will have to order 3 more trucks, two 220's and 1 Metro hanger, which will mean another two to three weeks.

If it turns out right, then I will see if I can get a group buy going. If there needs to be more refinement, then another 3 weeks.

@Brad I think you have something great there in the making so it's worth the wait. The only problem is you might not reach the numbers you need for a groupbuy.

@egzplicit whats the length of the evolve trucks from axle to axle? What length should a truck be top be able to accommodate AT wheels comfortably and not worry about wheel bites or any other clearances?
