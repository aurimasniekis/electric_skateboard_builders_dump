My second build is a Trampa Street Carver.  Here's the parts list:
- Trampa Street Carver (Holypro deck, Vertigo trucks, and Tampa 83mm 76a wheels)
-  Trampa mount and pulley kit (15mm belt, 37/14 pulleys)
- SK3 6374 149kv motor
- Ollin VESC
- Rhino 6S 4,900 mah x 2
- Gt2b tx/rx, with Badwolf enclosure
- Elephant E090 case


After putting all the Trampa parts together and mounting the motor:

I put a number of holes in the enclosure:
- the left-most holes allow access and clearance for the rear truck spring adjusters;
- the holes near them are mounting holes for the enclosure (which mounts using using extended versions of the rear-most truck mounting bolts);
- the big round hole is for the motor wires;
- the long hole is for my XT-90 loop key/charge port; and
- the remaining holes are for ventilation.

I configured the batteries like this. By inserting a loop key in the anti-spark XT-90 connector and connecting the other XT-90 to my VESC, I have a 12S system. Connecting both XT-90s using a parallel charge harness lets me parallel charge with a 6S charger.

I got this cheap L-plate at my local Ace Hardware, then bent it into a U-bracket. I then mount the VESC to it using one of the heat-sink screws.

And everything squeezed in together like this.

Nice!! 

I'm going for something similar but using the urban carver (no bindings, norrower trucks, but still pneumatics). 

How do you like the motor mount? Worth the price vs making your own or sourcing one from nowind?

you may want to get some insulation for the battery that is closer to the vesc, the heat can cause some trouble there.

The motor mount is easy to align and seems very stable, but I've probably only put 10 miles on it, so I can't speak to long term stability. Also, the plate to which the motor mounts is reasonably thin, which is nice from the standpoint of fitting a wide pulley on a short SK3 shaft. 

If I were to change anything, I'd prefer a slightly shorter motor plate, just to reduce the overall length of the board. But I suppose it'seems long to accommodate the bigger pneumatic wheels and pulley.

Overall, I'm *really* happy with the quality and ride of this board!

Thanks to both of you for the Compliments!

I know VESC heat is an issue, which is why I put lots of holes in the mid-section of the box. I also made sure there is at least 1/2" clearance between the batteries and heat sinks and put reflective foil on the sides of the batteries facing the VESC.  The lid actually presses lightly on the batteries when it's closed, so I figure I just need to keep that center section well ventilated.

Nice build and good inspiration! 

I'm also working on .. something ... so it's good to see some Trampa around. 

How is the carving compared to a standard longboard? 

And how does it work out with the box in the back? Doesn't it get in the way of your back foot? 
What is your stance? Sideways or more downhill-like, speed tuck?

Thanks, @PB1.

Compared with my Hi5ber Zenith build (with Caliber II 44s and 76mm Flywheels), carving on the Trampa is great. It turns tighter and steers at least as accurately. The big difference is in the _feel_, which just makes it more fun. While the Zenith deck is very stiff, the (14 ply) Trampa is very bouncy. Of course, that makes the ride smoother, but it also provides a fun, floaty feeling--kind of like I imagine snowboarding in powder feels.

The box at the rear is pretty much a non-issue. I stand sideways, but with my front foot turned somewhat forward. Every once in a while, my back heel bumps the corner of the box, but the box is so solidly mounted, I don't worry about it.

Hi Builders! Good news for those wanting a short carbon panel: Its in production and will arrive mid of Oktober already.
We will also get a new aluminium bracket to mount the hanger in MTB position to get more wheelbase on the Carve Urban Pneumatic tire setup. All carbon panels will fit both kind of brackets, so switching the hanger around will only be a matter of changing the bracket. This way you can easily switch from Carve Street to Carve Urban setups.

As I have seen on the photos: Both springs are in outer position. Try them in the inner position! This ads 100% more fun and carve. You can also try the inner position on the back side and the outer on the front side. 
I love them both in inner position.

You compared the feeling to a snowboard in powder snow. Totally right! That's what I personally love so much about it. Whenever I ride on a regular Longboard I think to myself: What a plank... 

Cheers, Frank

I wanted two follow up with two observations, now that I have probably 50 miles on this board . . .

First, the motor mount is super stable. I was worried that it wouldn't be, given that it doesn't clamp around the hanger, but it hasn't budged since I installed it.

Second, the drive/brake wheel on this board has great traction! The drive/brake wheel often lost traction (on both acceleration and braking) on my old board (with 76mm 75a Flywheels and Caliber II 44 trucks), when my weight was shifted away from the drive/brake wheel. But I nearly never lose traction with this Street Carver (with 83mm 76a wheels and Trampa Vertigo trucks). My guess is the better traction results from this design of trucks maintaining more weight on the outside wheels in turns. Whatever the explanation, it's a nice outcome for those of us with single motor setups.

Unfortunately, it looks like it would be impossible to fit two SK3 6374 motors on, at least with 15mm belts. I would say there would be about 1/2 inch overlap on the motors.

Which, actually originated from @nowind probably..

so @Nowind, can you comment on why ''motor axle holder'' is a good idea? (Other than using it for 25mm belts..) are the forces still too great in some cases? Does it help with belt skipping ?

Our motor feature a long axle shaft which reaches into the support bearing. This releases most of the strain from the motor bearings. Your SK3 has a short axle shaft, so in your case its more a protective element. Beraing support really should be standard. If you can, replace the motor shaft with a long one.

Thanks for the info! I was thinking about how ''inconvenient'' these short motor axles are! In some cases you cannot make thick enough motor plate as there won't be enough lenght of axle for the pulley to sit on!

Cool, thanks for including such a ''feature'' into your motor mount kits.. 

(thus reducing the strain / load on the motor's bearings ;) )

Ya, longer shafts are really needed..  the motor shafts on my envy only reach about halfway into my pulley.. 

I don't really know how long that'll last (with the strain of the pulley system and all), but it's been doing fine for the last couple hundred miles

Basically it eliminates other (radial) moments than torque on the bearings. Ideally you should have only radial forces, which these kind of bearings are designed for.

This is a quick built from used parts we had in the warehouse. Ted asked me: Could me make another board of these bits up the shelf? I said sure.
So we didn't hesitate and got our hands dirty: 30 mins job using a simple 6S RC Hobbywing controller. 
The only solder job was the XT90s connector on the battery and controller. Quick and dirty, tons of fun to ride.
The rear tuck is still switched to Street Carve position, so the wheels are a bit close to the battery enclosure. 
Just want to show how easy it is to build  up a board like that. 600 Pound board, 60 pound battery, 80 Pound controller, 20 Pound radio, 5 Pound XT90s, 50A car fuses. 765 Invest, great fun already. 8S would be better though and not a lot more expensive. 12S with VESC would be 100 Pound more, still well below 1000 bugs.

Urban and Street Carve share the 100% same truck. On the street boards we reverse the hangers.
To allow more space in between deck and wheel and have a wider wheelbase, we mount the hanger in "MTB/regular" position when using our pneumatic wheels. 7" Tires are used on the Urban Carve. 8" Tires are not only bigger in diameter but also wider, so the pulley would need to be spaced apart further. Never gave that a Try. 

Speed: 6S = 22Km/h, 8S = 29Km/h, 10S = 37Km/h, 12S = 44Km/h, using the longest transmission and fastest motor.

I would say yes. 7" is the best choice for such a board. Bigger is not always better!
You also have to consider that its better to not to try to build an "egg laying wool milk pig".
Everyone wants super versatile boards, we know. We try to make our gear as compatible as possible, so you guys have more options. Lots of the components we use are shared with other products. With a bit of work, you could even fit the Carve Connectors to our MTB hangers. You would need to file down the alloy of the hanger a bit, so that two surfaces of the square hanger base a not rounded anymore + perpendicular to the axle shaft. 
I'LL try that out and post an image. I'm pretty sure it will work.
I am really happy with the Urban Carve, so personally I see no need to fit 8" tires. 
But, thats my opponion and you guys may have another one.

The Carve with 7" does look good, but I'd prefer to have larger wheels since I want to use this new build for snow riding in the city. Also probably because bigger=more stable.

Well, in that case you want a MTB setup anyway. To increase steering, you can simply ride without Dampas.
With regards to steering, there is not to much difference to the Urban Carver having the springs in outer position. Depending on top speed, you want them there anyway.
If you are handy, you can put the springs to inner position when using the INFINITY range MTB trucks. All you need to do is a drill the additional holes for the inner spring position. A simple drill and a M8 thread cutter are th eonly tools needed. I did that many times, when experimenting with the carve trucks. Its not to much of a job. Start drilling some 2mm pilot holes into the hanger and baseplate, use the first set as a stancil for the second. 
Our Decks can be reshaped using a Jigsaw. It takes roughly 30 min to cut the desired shape and sand down the edges. You can cut your custom Carve Deck from a 35° short MTB Deck. 

Frank

Ps.: Bigger is not always more stable! Bigger wheels may be better in muddy conditions.

Hey! I'm a noob on here and everything I have seen that is made by you, looks awesome! Can you tell me what it would cost and take to build a board very similar to this one you threw together? I was going to buy a manufactured one, but this route seems much more enduring and stable. I think I want a urban carver because I feel like I would be able to go back and forth to street mode as well. Thoughts? Thanks for any info in advance!

Hi Cody 77, you need to decide what battery you would like to use. Best build would be using a VESC and 12S batteries and our 136kv motor. Another option is to go for 8S using a Hobbywing max6 controller. Top speed is limited in that case.

No Hills: Single is plenty of power. Its hard keep up standing while pulling the trigger.

You can always finetune your build, ad switches and lights and this and that. 
You would only need the cables and a XT 90S connector + a radio transmitter. Radios are not relly expensive.
Prices can be seen on the website. 600 GBP is your best deal. 
You can pick the colours of the components.

Frank,

Thanks for all the info so quickly! I am super close to pulling the trigger and ordering one of these kits. I have a few more questions for you. I apologize if I am bothering you. I'm just completely new to this and a bit overwhelmed. Which ply board should I go with? I want something responsive, but stable. I don't a lot of flex, just enough to give a more natural feel. I'm 6'3" and 200lbs. Can you tell me where I can get the cables, XT 90S connector, radio transmitter, VESC and the 10s-12s battery? I could not find any of these things on your site. do you recommend another company that carries the components that you don't? Can you tell me how fast and how long a run, a 10s or 12s battery will get me with the 136kv motor? I think that is all....for now. Thanks again for all your help!

> Its Unique weight saving hole in the tip of the deck means its drill pattern will only fit to TRAMPA Spring Trucks. Spring Trucks are a much stronger design than the Skate Trucks & by far a more suitable option for advanced or quick learning riders.

Thats from their site `http://www.trampaboards.com/35-holy-pro-mountainboard-drilled-sanded-gripped-with-bolt-kit--1517ply--p-11144.html`

So you would have to drill new holes to match the carver truck & according to Ted Orr from Trampa, the carver trucks are made for a deck with the 35° bend at the tips (2cents)

Theoretically yes, practically the cutout in the nose section is to big. The mini spring trucks feature inner spring positions and have in consequence a smaller cutout pattern. If you only use the outer position, it would work. Wheelbite is something I didn't check! And the HP deck has the truck mounted further up the nose. In consequence the HP deck would sit lower and could touch the ground on extreme leans.

Hi @Dogman1247, batteries on top have the advantage that they are out of the way and you don't have to worry about impacts.

When you ride a board you usually don't look at it.... Technically the battery is better mounted on top or on the nose From an aesthetic point of view its better underneath.
In two weeks we should have a new battery box, made from carbon, swallowing Lipos or up to 44 18650.

Performance is great, with a top speed of 24 mph and plenty of grunt for hill climbing. As Frank writes, mounting the batteries and electronics underneath would look better, but, functionally, my current setup is nice in that there's a nice carrying/pulling handle and it's very easy to access the batteries and electronics. I don't find the box on top to be in the way, but it's a little ugly.

I tried to post in the marketplace, but I seem not to have the right to post there. If interested, please PM.

@trampa I’m the proud new owner of the board that is detailed in this discussion. Being that this is my first diy/customizable board I am super stoked to start with such a great base and I’m also a total noob. In addition to this board I also picked up a lot of trampa wheels from a guy in philly. I got superstar rims, gummies, 6.5” pneumatic street and the inner tubes. I think I got all the gears but I’m pretty sure I don’t have any belts.  What belts would I need?  I’m about to place an order for new tires since the ones that came with the lot are balding and I also want to add on bindings. Please help me find the correct belts!

Belts depend on gearing and wheel choice, so you need to tell me what you plan to do.

I believe it’s 14t at the motor

I have 62 & 44 for the urban treads and the gummies 

This is a list of the lot I bought to compliment the board.

The board rides really smoothly and has great range on the 75a Flywheels; they're premium wheels for a good reason. They were a huge upgrade in smoothness of ride over the stock Trampa Stickies of the same size. But I was really surprised that the range increased 25% with the Flywheels, which meant I could do my round-trip commute comfortably.

It's your call, of course, but I'd at least try the Flywheels before you change to something else.

Absolutely will. I want to be able to rotate the three wheels and figure out what I like best. The one thing I’m worried about with the fly wheels is clearance. My city puts no money into maintaining its roads and earlier this year I broke three ribs when my board stopped short because the trucks hit a piece of rebar sticking through the pavement. If I had a half inch more clearance I’d have been safe. I do day trips to neighboring cities, parks and beaches I plan on switching out wheels in accordance to the terrain. I’m really excited to try the Abec 11 wheels. I’m not trying to modify the board in any way I just want to be able to switch the wheels out.

Glad to read it arrived and that you're pleased with its power --- 12S LiPos and that big, low KV motor always delivered all the power I needed. PM or email me if you have any questions and enjoy the board!

I added a leash so it doesn’t end up in the harbor and a light for night rides. ![image|375x500](upload://o9unSZIoDNBovmA2luXC96EePQt.jpeg)

@SteveS do you ride regular or goofy? I ride goofy and it feels like I should swap the drive motor to the other side. What do you think?

I ride regular and it worked just fine on that side for me. Are you having drive wheel slip problems? If so, I guess switching sides might put more weight on the drive wheel. If not, I'm not sure I see why it matters?

Yes, it's better to get the drive under the heel (more weight) than toes ;)  
Nice little setup BTW, enjoy !!

what @riako said; I think once you have it flipped around you'll be much happier with the boardfeel of the Street Carver as you transition from flats into mellow uphills... feels very surfy with the power under your heel.

So noob question here. I think I’m right on this but in switching the drive motor to the other side I would also have to switch the wiring to switch the rotation of the motor. Right? I’m not sure yet if I have reverse 🤣

If you have sensor wires then you need to change it in the VESC tool, should be a button to reverse; if you have no sensors then just change any 2 of the 3 phase wires

Well I screwed something up. The motor was making some loud grinding noises and then stopped responding entirely. VESC is blinking red. Downloaded Vesc tool it says this ![image|375x500](upload://dhlJox2RmOCq0FPgjy7dgo8d63F.jpeg)
