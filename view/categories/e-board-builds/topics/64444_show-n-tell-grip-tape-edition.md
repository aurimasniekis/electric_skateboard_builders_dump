Why do you use polyurethane with the glass frit instead of epoxy?

If i underatand correctly epoxy it self is not grippy so grip is provided by only the frit but with ployurathane you have that extra level of grip. Of course this is just my assumption

I was going to say for flexibility too. Epoxies are really hard. I‚Äôve never used them on anything Exterior or that will flex.

@longhairedboy I love the S.H.I.E.L.D one most. Looks really clean! I'm thinking of a matte black spray then a black grip cut into some funky shapes like the Evolve boards. Not sure how I would get the positioning right though? :thinking:

@Dmaxx I love that first one! The same sort of style I'm going for I think. How did you get the positioning of the shapes right? Excuse me if that's a stupid question!! :laughing:

Why do you use polyurethane with the glass frit instead of epoxy?
[/quote]

A number of reasons: 

* it doesn't crackle or break off, epoxy eventually cracks/shatters and peels without a substrate in thin applications in my experience
* epoxy is slicker, as mentioned above. poly is indeed grippier, or so i have found.
* the polyurethane i use can be purchased at lowe's or home depot or any hardware store at all, but quality glass clear epoxy is expensive and not as accessible
* water based means easy cleanup, lack of toxic fumes, more years to live
* the above reasons add up to  the owner of the board having a much easier time with redoing thier grip if they choose to do so the wau i do it. 
* sandimg off polyurethane to regrip with traditional grip is less toxic and dangerous than sanding down epoxy if they choose to go that route when it wears off. 
* epoxy is more expensive and requires disposables like brushes and cups that you have to throw away after using.
