Very DIY and interesting build. Why did you opt for 3x motors, due to esc availability?

Very nice! Do you have a rachet in both front wheels? Doesnt this mean that both can turn idividually, but you loose the brakes in front?

On off-road, 4wd has great significance. However, on-load reduces battery efficiency, increases weight, and increases motor + esc cost.

So I used a freewheel to lower the rolling resistance while driving 2 wheels with one motor on the front wheels.

I wanted to be able to ride freely without any special changes.

That's correct. And reducing rolling resistance. 
I think that two rear wheels were enough for the brakes.

Really nice, you can change between 4wd and 2wd on the remote?

@Pedrodemio 
It may be possible, but I have not done it yet.
I will set rpm limit to be 4wd only at low speed and 2wd in high speed.

Hi, @Martin

Im looking to drive 3 Bldc motors from single throttle.
could tell me.
How many esc did you use? 
and are they all sync to same throttle?

thanks,

wayne.

CAN or PWM or as it is sometimes called PPM
