Hello all,
I recently blew up my switch when the board was on (but not while riding or an initial burst of any sort) and am looking for guidance for a new switch any ideas? My battery is made of the Turnigy Graphine 4s 5.2A with 3 packs in series and 2 parallel. I need something that can handle the amps as it was right after my first run on a brand new DIY built board.
Thanks,
Thomas

The most reliable is to use an xt90 anti-spark loop key.
Generally ordinary switches will fail pretty fast with 12s voltage.
