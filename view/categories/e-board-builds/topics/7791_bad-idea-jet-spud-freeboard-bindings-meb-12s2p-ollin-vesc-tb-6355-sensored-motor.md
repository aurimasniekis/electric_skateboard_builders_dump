 Will be my third build, but first build thread. I fell in love with Okp's and @whitepony's trick/freeboard esk8 idea and well...I just couldn't help myself. Told my wife about this idea of an electric skateboard that I could jump curbs with..."sounds like a bad idea" was her immediate response, hence the name. I'm over forty and she's probably right, but screw it, only live once. 

Picked up a Jet Spud from Muirskate. Added 44degree caliber 2 trucks and Otang kegels. I'm 6'1" and was worried about the short deck/wheel base of the spud, but it actually feels pretty solid and stable. I'm not planning on gearing this for speed anyway. Freeboard bindings came in the mail a couple weeks ago. Base plate is pretty heavy chrome steel, didn't fit, gave it a quick black paint and slapped them on using outer truck screws. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a1187ddcdd213762fb15dfbdb759e8632b171e36.jpg" width="669" height="500"> think I'm going to widen the stance a bit. Didn't quite have the balance I like on test ride and ollies in living room. 
Since weight is so critical, I knew going into the build I'd need to sacrifice some battery to save weight. Ran across Miami Electric Board's 12s2p while trying decide if I wanted to tackle a DIY battery...no contest. I'm sure I'll end up building my own battery at some point, but for now MEB's battery gives me enough range, convenient size (about 9"x 5 1/2"), low weight, and the 12s is a good fit for the 170kv motor I have my eye on.

Battery is sitting in a psychotillar enclosure I special ordered...unfortunately, I over estimated the required space. I can probably lose 2 1/2 " in length and 1" in width. Really want this to be lower profile, looks I'll be forking out cash for another enclosure. 

Still waiting on:

Ollin VESC 
Enertion mount
Nano remote

Thinking through:

Motor - want to go with a sensored motor. Seems like it could save some hassle of popping out/in the bindings at lights and stop signs. Considering @chaka 5065 170kv and @torqueboards 6355 170kv. I have one @chaka's motor on another 12s build and it runs fine, decent torque, and the smaller diameter affords greater clearance which is attractive for this trick board, but the odd hole spacing is annoying...basically only fits enertion mounts. Also the sensor wires need to be reorganized to plug into the VESC. @torqueboards motor seems like it would do the trick, but it's not in stock yet and I've never used one, so it's an unknown. All in all, I'm probably leaning towards TBs motor, probably a bit more torque and if I decide to swap it out to another build at a later date, I don't have to worry about limiting myself to enertion only mounts (even though I like enertion mounts).

12mm or 15mm - I have a 12mm mono and get belt slippage under aggressive breaking (unless belt is crazy tight). 15mm might eliminate or severally reduce slippage. Trying to decide if it's worth it...12mm motor and wheel pulley options are abundant...15mm not so much. Also want to stick with Kegel wheels...even fewer 15mm options. Appreciate any feedback on 15mm vs 12mm.

hihi, Im 37 and practicing 180s on a school yard surely feels a little awkward. :joy:

I really became a fan of 15mm - even with a loose belt, the torque transfer is still really good! looking forward to this build :slight_smile:

Quick update. 

Been getting really good feedback about the 15mm drive train, so I went ahead and purchased a motor pulley on eBay. Link for motor pulley http://www.ebay.com/itm/HTD-5M-15T-16W-5-6-6-35-8-10mm-Bore-Pitch-5mm-Timing-Belt-Drive-Pulley-15-Tooth-/252402866384?var=551250486553
15mm Kegel wheel pulleys are almost impossible to find, Alien is out of stock, and everyone else seems to offer 3D printed versions...I'm not hating on 3D printed pulleys...already have one being printed, but I'd prefer something already tested and proven. While searching online for Kegel pulley I came across Evolve's GT Kegel wheel pulley, it's a molded pulley designed to pop in. It was only $30, so I pulled the trigger. Link here https://evolveskateboardsusa.com/collections/gt-series-parts/products/kegel-drive-gear 
A couple issues with this pulley:
1.) it's 32t, which when added to my 15t motor pulley is a less than ideal gear ratio at 12s. 
2.) it doesn't sit flush with along kegel's inner side wall. See pic<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/b7b17e67b7fc1bf79f6611d81b574d8bb1a22366.jpeg" width="373" height="500"> 
there's a ridge reinforcing the hole posts that stops it from laying flush. Seen here 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/1fd26abb6a32b45bc21e14d0c751f8878bfa52cf.jpeg" width="373" height="500"> 
strangely, because the Kegel is offset it fits perfectly from the outside. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7d1929cff6c0a296b4bc1fbd1cd7604fe64e8501.jpeg" width="373" height="500"> 
I noticed in pics of the GT the pulley to wheel gap appears to be standard. Can any Evolve GT owners confirm this? Still about 10mm of posts running through the wheel...
3.) the baring is a larger diameter than normal. Fortunately, it's easy to pop out and throw a standard size in.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/45056480f2362dbd086166a8ed81d4c9b32cab47.jpeg" width="373" height="500">

Ultimately, it's very likely I'll need to modify the caliber 2 trucks with either of my current options, so I'll wait for the 3D pulley to arrive and make a decision. 

On to the overall color scheme...

Generally, I'm a big fan of the black enclosure and black deck look. Couple that with some brightly colored wheels and you've got a pretty sharpe looking board that disguises its intentions well. My last build. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/45f16ffb118cb8bc35e9dec8c7aa1b74d837685a.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

However, I'm really digging the silver Spud deck with orange kegels and black bindings...I'm leaning towards keeping this color scheme.

My current thought is to use circular grip tape cut outs under the bindings. I've also thought about layering with this faux silver carbon fiber. https://www.ebay.com/itm/131240784082
Copied this idea from @Michaelinvegas

I'm not sure how durable this stuff is, but I'm going to lay it on and see how it looks... Can always remove, sand it down and start over.

good progress, i also dig the color scheme! that evolve pulley adds pretty much bearing width to the wheel from what i remember so probably need to work on the truck a little. that special inner bearing diameter accounts for the longer and thicker reinforced drive wheel steel strut of the evolve custom sidewinders. I bent 3 trucks until I gave up on the street setup ... months later they finally came up with that new reinforced truck and also with triple bearings - something I did nearly on the first day with my evolve 3 years ago. :grin:

not a big fan of cutting cast material off trucks to get more of the steel strut after my horrible bending experience. :neutral_face:

Hear ya...especially on a board I intend to be jumping curbs with. At about 95kg I'm not exactly light. I'm kinda hoping the Evolve pulley ends up being an unneeded reserve.

OK, been slowly making some progress on this build, so it's update time...

First off - bindings position and my overall stance. Stance isn't normally much of a focus during a build thread, but it's pretty important with the bindings and its even more critical with my build...more on that later. I said earlier I wanted to try out some wider bindings placement to give me a wider stance. To explain, I'm a bit taller than avg at 6'1" (186cm) and was concerned about balance on the short Spud deck using the outer truck screws which only give me about 25" stance. However, going a bit wider places my feet right on the wheelwells which I generally don't find that comfortable. 

After trying out a couple different positions, I decided an adequate stance with good foot position is better than an ideal stance with poor foot position. Fortunately, this means going back to the outer truck screws which look better anyway.

Color scheme - I'm committing to the silver, black, and orange look shown earlier in the thread. Unfortunately the factory finish sucked...cheap paint and cracks all over. Soo, I'm sanding the board down and starting over.

Was getting late and I was tired of sanding, so I went ahead and drilled out holes for the screw inserts, coated inserts liberally with JB Weld and let cure overnight.

New enclosure - Ordered a smaller enclosure to better fit the deck. This one is 12"x5 1/2"X1 1/4" and its perfect! Anyone looking for an enclosure in the US should talk to @psychotiller...just does a killer job! 

Enclosure with MEB's 12s2p battery, single VESC, bms, nano receiver, and power button and charge port mounted street side. Perfect fit!

3D printed wheel pulley - in my search for a 15mm Kegel wheel pulley, I came across @Genex who was kind enough to print a pulley using one of the files @JuniorPotato93 uploaded. The pulley finally arrived and even though I was making good progress on the deck, it was too much for my ADD to resist. 
Overall first impressions...pretty good. Perfect fit on the wheel, but the holes on retaining ring broke through the inner diameter wall. To add strength I layered in some JB Weld...I use the shit out of this stuff.

Wasn't sure how well the JB Weld would work in this application, but it's holding up surprisingly well.

This version of the 3D file doesn't have the inner nuts, it just threads through, so I'm not sure how well it will hold up, but it fits perfectly and it doesn't require any truck modification...worth a shot in my book.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/0fe1caf4ff6a30996df52aa80767b138a0018887.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

Battery meter/LCD - wanted to try something unique with this build and like @whitepony, I want to push myself a little more on each build. An idea for the battey meter came to me while trying out different stances with the freeboard bindings. "Wouldn't it be cool if I could mount the battery meter on the bindings..." Turns out, there's room. 

First I drilled a hole big enough for the two pin jst connector. Then I dremeled out a few spots, so the meter lays flat.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a6063b93f5a5cc393a1be44c088b394ff3557eb6.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/26e0c1b600df4724182c4b93392f6432993fdca9.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

Then I used JB Weld plastic bonder to secure the batter meter to the binding. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/2ebe445f5027758fef28fba9d233dc411833c34c.jpg" width="669" height="500">

Once that cured, I molded quite a lot Sugru around the screen to add some protection and make it more ascetically appealing. Still need to work on the Sufru shape, but its coming along.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/b603037b1bbeb5b75fda124ffdaa4cb04b93614c.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

The battery meter connects to the board with another 2 pin connector, so it's totally modular. If I want to ride without the bindings, just remove them and unplug the battery meter, no wires left hanging out. More pics to come.

Next up: 
- Swiss cheesing my board

Motor - 
" To sensor or not to sensor" went back and forth on this several times. I don't really need a sensored motor, I can pop in and out of the bindings easy enough that it's not a big deal. Also a sensored motor would be a complete PITA to route wires through the board...so plenty of reasons not to go sensored. Did it anyway. Mostly because I wanted to try something new. Hope it's worth it...gonna be a total pain in the ass. 

Went with @torqueboards 6355 170kv sensored motor which should match up well with the 12s battery from MEB. Never used one of his motors before, but I've had a great experience dealing with him, so I feel comfortable giving this motor a shot. Came in the mail awhile back and I haven't even bench tested it yet, but I must say, it's got some nice features.
1. Key hole
2. Two flat sections ground into motor shaft
3. Groves cut to hold retaining pins on both sides of motor pulley
4. Long enough shaft to comfortably handle a 15mm motor pulley

The pic above also shows where I cut off the sensor wire connector. It doesn't match up correctly to the sensor port on the VESC and I'd need to remove it any way to run the wires through the deck.

Ultimately, I've got to do a bunch of soldering to get the sensor wires connecting into the deck, then through the deck to the VESC. I've looked around for jst 6 pin connectors, but haven't found anything that matches up well for my needs. Decided to compromise and use three micro jst two pin connectors.

Going to solder longer wires to each, then channel them through the deck.

Deck - 
Made some progress on the deck while waiting for the Sugru to cure. As stated earlier, I'm going for a modular build where wires plug into the deck, so the motor, battery, VESC, etc can all be removed without major hassle or disassembly. When you add the phase wires, sensor wires, and battery meter together...that some serious Dremel action. 

Swiss cheesing my board.

Hey man I got some of the sensor connectors from China they seem like decent quality. The male has 5.5in of wire and the female has just the pins. They're called jst 2.0mm 6pin i believe took like a month to get here. I can send you some at no charge to you if you're interested.

On a side note i didn't see much benefit being sensored the vesc is pretty smooth only noticed when the sensor itself gave up from a crash to curb and wouldn't budge from a standstill.

Hell yeah!  Thanks dude. Don't mind paying for them either. I've heard mixed opinions on the sensored set ups. @Jinra seems to really like it and makes a good argument for feeling polished and professional. I'm not sure what I really expect...smooth start from dead stop I suppose.

I'm running 1 sensored 1 sensorless right now because the sensors on one are broken. Really wishing i had full sensors because my setup cogs a bit sometimes from stand still. I just don't see why you wouldn't use them if they're available, other than that it's a little more work to setup in a reliable fashion.

Updates!! 
Sensor wires were kicking my butt until @Titoxd10001 graciously sent me a few of his extra 2mm 6 pin connectors. These connectors are a perfect fit for the VESC. Here you see the connector (larger one) vs 6 pin connector on motor.

You can see the two pin connector sticking out if the grip tape slightly. Thats where the battery meter will plug into the board.

I've only had time for a quick run around the block, but it rides really well for such a short board. Biggest surprise is how much extra control the bindings provide. Haven't worked up the courage to hop a curb yet, but I had no problem jumping cracks and small rocks going 5ish mph on my first ride.

Soo much easier to carry around without full grip tape. Seems trivial, but it's noticeable when carrying the board around for a few minutes. It's little things like this that make for a more enjoyable ownership experience.

Gorgeous day in SoCal today. Family esk8 ride...well except for my 8yr old daughter (scooter). This was the first significant ride with the Bad idea board and I learned three things:
1.) 3D printed wheel pulley really needs nuts and washers securing the pulley to wheel. Currently just have the screws with loc-tight...screws were vibrating loose by end of ride.
2.) This thing is an absolute blast!!! Really changes the nature of a ride, you're not just cruising, you're looking for curbs, cracks, and rocks to jump. That said, its also surprisingly good at cruising and carving.
3.) Bad idea board gets more attention than all the other boards combined. I suppose it's the bindings or maybe people seeing me jump it, but it definitely attracts notice and so far all positive notice. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/2/520eeeac4079093db660f0a1d68b1d0f490d0f12.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Been getting some questions about the Miami Electric Boards stealth battery, so I thought I share my experience:

1.) Buying experience -  @oriol360 has been very responsive to questions and proactive with updates on order status. These are critical elements of a positive user experience in my opinion. 
2.) Looks - The battery it self looks exactly like the pictures on the website. Not sure If MEB describes this on the website, but there is a nice foam protective layer under the heat shrink for some vibration resistance. If you are accustomed to a space cell battery like I was, it appears to be worryingly small...like maybe it won't be powerful enough.
3.) Riding & Range - I'm 215lbs and live in a pretty hilly part of Los Angeles, my set up is a single 170kv motor (@torqueboards). I was a bit concerned this battery wouldn't have the juice to get me up the bigger hills...shouldn't have worried. The motor is sensored and I've accelerated from stand still up 15+% grades without any problems...I'm sure it would handle 20% grades without any problems. The longest ride I've done so far has been about 8 miles...mostly up and down hills. The battery meter was showing 44% after. Overall, I'm very happy with this battery and in fact this battery with @torqueboards 170kv motor with 15mm pulleys is the best drivetrain combo I've used to date. Have I mentioned how much this board weighs...
4.) Accessories - BMS and power switch are good to go, but the charge port isn't ideal. In fact this is my only complaint, and it's really just a matter of personal preference for me. The charge port that comes with the battery doesn't have a threaded ring that allows it to easily be secured to an enclosure. I replaced the original charge port with one that does have a threaded ring...the work of about 2 minutes.

I'm missing it i guess - i see above you mention you need to weigh it and shoot some video...  So how much *does* it weigh?

Such a cool thread and makes me want to build one too...  Which i'm *NOT* going to do until the other 2 or 3 boards are closer to done or actually completed!

dangerous sometimes to read/drool over other's builds...

Sorry for the tease. It weighs 14.4 lbs with the bindings...those binding base plates are heavy! I'm guessing 11 - 12 lbs range without bindings.

I'm an out of shape 41 year old with very little skateboarding experience and have no problem jumping curbs. 

I started off jumping cracks and moved up from there. The first few curbs take some courage, but you'll quickly get the hang of it.

It's nice to know you can hop over most road debris, but even better than that...it's a shit load of fun!!

A few thoughts on the bindings:
1.) the weight is annoying...the base plates are heavy steel. I wish they were made from high quality aluminum. That said, I can still jump up high curbs without a max effort.
2.) because your feet tend to push outward hard while jumping, they can be uncomfortable with certain shoes. I've only noticed it after about 10-12 successive jumps.
3.) they add a ton of control. You feel locked in and much more in control. I'm over 6 feet tall and go 20+ mph on my tiny little jet spud and feel fine...no way I'm doing that without the bindings.
4.) surprisingly easy to hop out of. Numerous times I've stepped out or jumped out of the bindings in time to avoid eating shit. 
5.) take a little getting used to, but IMO an awesome bang for the buck add on for eskateboards.

You'll dig them. Don't be afraid to play around with the stance width and angle. I started with both bindings in the outer truck screw holes and it felt "ok" but ended up moving my front binding forward about 1 1/2 inches after a couple months and that was much better.

Thanks! The base plates have curved groves that you can use various hardware (I just used old trucks screws and nuts) to mount to the board. You can see the groves in this pic. You'll want to stand on the board and get a sense of best stance for the bindings, then mark and drill holes.

Awesome, I am debating putting some on my build for more control and carving. I have my trucks set up at the perfect tightness (for me) so that I can carve as hard as I want and since I have them tight enough they physically can't get wheelbite.
