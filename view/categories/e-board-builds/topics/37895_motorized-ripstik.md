Hey guys

One of my buddies is helping me motorize a rip stick
which is dope, but there are certain issues that arise with this

Here are the issues we are facing:

First off, we're only gonna be putting a hub motor at the rear. 
Therefore the one hub we use will have to be powerful enough.

The hub motor is significantly bigger than the original wheels 
so the stem casters will have to be replaced.

We are planning on placing all the batteries in the board which 
means we have very limited space. But I am ok with a limited range.

Our budget is tight but we can get some more funds.

We would like to buy all the parts within 2 weeks.


STUFF I ALREADY KNOW:

I know I plan on getting SAMSUNG 25R 18650 20A cells.
because these will offer the discharge i need based on my size restrictions
I know liionwholesale.com sells them.

Originally I was planning on buying an 800W Maytech Hub Motor

Since reading up a lot on here, I'd be down to get a Jacob or a Hummie.
I've actually pm them both, just waiting for a response.

Finding a single good quality hub motor is one of my bigger issues as 
of right now.
I've looked at http://alienpowersystem.com/, www.aliexpress.com and a 
few other.

I could use some insight as to where to find these

I'm trying to make a high quality one.

At this point i've done research on the components and I've got just about everything down, with the exception of the hub.

I'm still looking for a good hub to buy.

If anyone knows somebody who's trying to sell a 80~140kv hub motor, LMK

Thanks guys

I’ve been thinking about a ripsurf build, lots more room for batteries and electronics and better ride overall. Might be easier to CNC a belt drive mount than reworking the wheel and subbing a hub motor, thoughts?

Nice! I've never ridden a ripsurf, how does it compare to the ripstik?

A lot more flow first off. There's a small learning curve, but afterwards, you don't think about riding it as much, it's more natural and a better ride overall.

They don't seem expensive either, I just might buy one.

Also with regards to motorizing it, you could easily have all 
the electrical components in a box on the top of the board, 
the motor mounting might be a little weird though.

@spigelli how were you planning on connecting the wheel?

It was mainly a concept I've been playing with as I'm currently working on my commute eboard setup. I've had a couple of Ideas on the motor drive. It'd be really awesome to see this build finished and if you want we could work on a 3D model. That's what I decided to do with my current build that I showed in [this post](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/firefly-remote-with-190kv-focbox-12s4p-setup/51588). It helped workout a lot of placement issues before I bought any of the parts and would likely be even more useful for a build like this. I built the model in inventor but I may switch to fusion soon so if you want help lmk

Have you considered just using a hub motor?

Are the casters rotating freely? Have you looked at how Leiftech does it, looks pretty similar.

The caster do rotate freely but the good thing is they never spin all the way around so you don’t need the same gyroscopic device they use on the motorized freeboards

I am in the process of designing a mount for a 4250 Hobbyking motor.  I am also making a wheel pulley out of acetal.  I am going to 3D print 2 enclosures to go on the top of the board to hold the battery on one side and the VESC on the other.

If anyone is interested in me making a mount or 3D printed enclosures for their Ripstik, let me know!

The mounts will be CNCed from .19 inch aluminum and will have 2 idler pulleys too for belt grip since I can only fit a 5mm wide 3m belt.
