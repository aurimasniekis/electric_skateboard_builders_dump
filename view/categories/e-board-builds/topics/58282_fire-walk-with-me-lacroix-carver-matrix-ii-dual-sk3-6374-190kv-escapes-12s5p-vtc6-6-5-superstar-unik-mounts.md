I've been teasing peeks at this build in the picture thread lately. Since it's starting to get some reaction I figure I might as well start a proper build thread

With the 6.5 inch wheels, does it look like it would bottom out without the risers?

I designed them in Fusion 360 and had them print by a local 3Dhubs.com affiliate. I posted the parts in the 3d print thread : http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/3d-printables-for-eskate/23199/79

It's a vinyl sticker with carbon fiber like patterns. Not sure how durable that will be, or if it's going to allow proper heat exchange. Just a tryout for now.

Do you guys think that my pulley too far up the shaft problem is solved by this longer pulley? Or is it just as bad for the motor bearings?

I'm still very much undecided about what I'm going to do for grip. I'm not really liking the grip strip that came with the deck.
I've been experimenting with LHB's method of glass frit & urethane spar on this ugly cracked deck, wooden parts look very much ok, a little bit patchy from close up but with a bit more practice I'm confident I could get it right.
[img]https://i.imgur.com/g9hss7K.jpg[/img]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/YLxM6h8.jpg[/img]
Carbon fiber part though is another matter and I'm afraid it's just a bad idea, the problem is mostly that I can't dose the glass micro balls to be evenly distributed and sparse enough at the same time. If anyone's got a suggestion I'm all ears.
[img]https://i.imgur.com/HAa9Fw8.jpg[/img]

I have a backup grip I made for the trampa carver deck I ditched when I decided to go with Lacroix, and I like it very much, but I can't help but feel it would be a bit of a sacrilege on this deck.

If getting an even amount of frit lad down is the headache could you maybe makes cardboard mask as a pattern for whatever design you'd like, then use spray adhesive, followed by sprinkling the frit, backed up by UT-spray when coverage is what you expect?

[img]https://i.imgur.com/NaujC8L.jpg[/img]

The esc's bottom doesnt touch the carbon enclosure. I'm going to watch the temp and if I have a heat problem, maybe make a copper riser to conduct the heat towards the enclosure.

Motor detection ok. I forgot the focbox mislabeled the sensor port so I had to bang my head against a wall for 2 hours, but after a good night's sleep it came back to me.

Everything is ok except my metr dongle not sending any data even though it's connected. Otherwise I just have to assemble everything for the maiden voyage.

Ooofff that is tight.
A dual aluminium flanged casefrom @LukePL would be superb I would reckon? It has a flange which would allow you to cut a hole and this would drop the ESCapes a little & dump the heat outside. Looks like power lead interferance is the problem tho

Secondarily it would look most deadly

My hope is that they won't heat much. This is not an AT board after all, plus the 6.5" tyres can be inflated to 80 psi, reducing the rolling resistance by a lot (says Frank). Batt max is 40 x 2, Motor max is 50. I think the ESCape can handle a lot more.

I don't think making a hole for the double flanged case would be good for the structural integrity of the enclosure. it's only 1mm thick and the hole would be massive. It would really protrude a lot in the front too leaving only 2 thirds of the flange in contact with the enclosure. Stewii is saying he can make it smaller though, certainly a good thing.

Still ironing out the kinks. I set my battery cutoffs a bit high at 40v and had to walk alongside the board for the last  km. I thnk I'll be able to do better soon. Starting to get a bit faster too, I didnt push it  too much though, still mostly unexplored terrain, plus it was hot af and I did not want to gear up like robocop, just kevlar pants, wristguards and a light helmet.

The red / red shockblocks are a PITA, stable as an aircraft carrier, but it turns like one too. I'm tired of waiting, bit the bullet and ordered a full set of yellow and orange ones, I think i'll be selling some soon if anyone's interested.

Double reds must be absolutely aweful. Have no clue why they even bothered making those. In fact, here in Canada and USA, they are getting rid of them and going back to shipping the trucks with oranges and yellows, like before. Seems no one liked the reds. Probably the same in Europe.

@pat.speed, The light looks pretty great for the price. I haven't tried it in a ride yet since the sun goes down pretty late at this time of year but it's 3 levels of brightness, very bright, comes with a 2S2P 1850 pack of its own, easy to mount on anything.

@mobutusan, I suppose it's a matter of finding the right drilling bit size, I didnt try it though.

After a few problems with the overion mounts, mostly due to the fact I've been trying to make them work with belts when they're made for chains. I threw the towel and got some UNIK mounts.

To keep the same max speed I changed my motor pulleys and took a pair of 18T from Eskating.eu. Thanks for the swift delivery @fottaz, you really improved on that front...

On smooth pavement they are super good, real grippy, super reactive, they give a real kick when accelerating and they drag a lot less when coasting. I kinda prefer carving on pneu though, they carve a bit more abruptly, maybe I should try tightening my shockbocks a bit more.

On bad pavement they really stressed my build though, a lot of rattling, I had to retighten everything on arrival.
They feel a lot less grippy as soon as there's a bit of small gravel or sand on the road, or on irregular pavement... no carving there.

I have to say though it still felt very rideable thanks to shock absorbing risers and mostly to the Lacroix deck and its flex.

Range wise I did get the same range I usually have with 6.5" at 85 PSI, though i had to battle against a strong headwind most of the way, and I did not slow down or tuck it out, just kept my snowboard stance.

Most likely no. You will need new wheel pulleys. Also I think trampa hub is not as wide as MBS. So you'll have to either adjust the motor mounts or get long spacers for the pulleys

I did gummies successfully with 1/2 inch risers and I used 18T (eskating.eu) /66T for transmission. It was a bit lower than usual but no scratches so far. My usual setup is 6.5" tyres with 1/4" risers and 14T/66T transmission.

sorry I missed that question until today. I'm not sure I get what you mean though? 
the stock MBS trucks are just the trucks and end nuts, no bearing spacers or speed rings. It will be necessary to get some. My motor mounts come from unikboards and they are very good, adjustable in the right way and super stable.
