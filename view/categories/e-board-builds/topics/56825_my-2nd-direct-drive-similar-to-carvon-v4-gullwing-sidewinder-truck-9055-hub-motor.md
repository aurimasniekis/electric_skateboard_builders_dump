Sweet build!  Your going heavy into DD huh? . Can you go into detail as to how you got the hub motors to fit the trucks and the process of getting the hub motor to adapt to the wheel hub?

This hub motor has the different method to fix into the axle.
I can not find such a hub motor these days.

You may find it helpful to refer to two pictures.

I feel like your title is click bait, just say direct drive man. I would say  it's not similar because well your using 12pmm axle will snap on u motors have no steel sleeves. and adapters are not carvon, I just feel like it's click bait just my two cents

I'm sorry if I felt that way. 
But my intention was to mention the idea because I got it from Carvon v4, not from my creation.

I think by mentioning Carvon you get real specific in the type of direct drive this is.  Direct Drive could mean hub motor also but increasingly more and more people are calling gear drive trains DD which is causing confusion.

I love what you have done here. How did you extend the axles of your gullwing hangers?

Sick man! I was thinking to do kind of the same but attach the hub motor closer to Central of the truck. Could you tell me about the hubs you are using. How do they perform and which set up you have (battery ecc)... Thanks a lot!

Hi, 
I'm using MP83 HUB motor. Please refer to below link.

https://frchobby.en.alibaba.com/product/60481387785-803325215/MP83_60_63mm_High_Torque_Hub_Motor_24S_28P_3000W_for_electric_skateboad_with_vesc_controller.html

My board setting is 10S battery and ebay low price ESC for HUB motor.

I know your Habs I was wondering which top speed and torque feeling you get out of it. I see you are using esc so probably the top speed is limited a bit
```

## \#19 Posted by: Martin Posted at: 2018-08-06T10:13:02.264Z Reads: 172

```
I aimed this board setting for low speed and flat riding. I feel the torque is definitely not good because of the large size wheels. Still, there is no problem with flat riding. I have not tried full accelerator yet.
if i measure top speed, l will let you know.

Hmmm maybe I could adapt this for normal urethane wheels for a better urethane experience

It is also possible to use a regular long board wheel. Instead, you should open the hub motor as much as possible to cool it.

## \#22 Posted by: pat.speed Posted at: 2018-08-07T11:57:50.597Z Reads: 154

Yes I will, would you be able to measure the diameter of the hub motor with the urethane removed? Please

Hi! I am working on a new project that will require similar axle enxtender. I was wodnering if you can tell me which material you used and whihc machine. I thought to make them with a lathe but I am afraid of possible vibration on the metal bar. Did you use a CNC? Thx :grin:

Hi!, 

My friend made it.
It was made using a lathe tool.
The material is SUS 304. :slight_smile:

Perfect thanks. Is it correct 5/16 24" for the axle thread? That what I found only but just to be sure...

I do not know the dimensions, but I have been asked to make a specification such as a long board truck axle thread.

You actually used a longer axle. Is it like 12mm in diameter? What I was looking for was the thread pitch for making the thread. Doesn't matter I will lokm it up online. Thank you for the help!

for the motor you posted: https://frchobby.en.alibaba.com/product/60481387785-803325215/MP83_60_63mm_High_Torque_Hub_Motor_24S_28P_3000W_for_electric_skateboad_with_vesc_controller.html

Is it $85 for a set?? (2 hub motors, 2 vescs, 1 remote)
or $85 for a singular motor?

## \#30 Posted by: Martin Posted at: 2018-10-30T00:25:22.378Z Reads: 71

Perhaps the price of a singular motor.
