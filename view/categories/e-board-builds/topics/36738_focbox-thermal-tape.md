So I was opening my focbox to resolder my phase wire because it broke off and noticed that the direct FETs use thermal tape to conduct heat to the heatsink. I know tape does not conduct heat as well as thermal paste.

Has anyone replaced that tape with thermal paste?? I would think that would up the heat dissapation greatly

Thermal pad is insulator, otherwise direct fet drains (connected to metal package of directfets) would short via aluminium heatsink.

Paste is non conductive as well but the tolerance looks like a problem and if the paste runs thin then pop

Hmm I think you guys are right the clearance is an issue the past won't close that small gap.

If you look up thermal pad on eBay, Amazon or really anywhere else you'll find tons of this blue sheet you can cut to size. You could also use thermal adhesive which hardens kind of like silicone sealant.

Hmmm.... It really depends on the type of paste and the type of tape... but just remember "IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT"

How about just Kapton tape the area off on the aluminum heatsink.

Kapton tape is heat resistant not heat conductive, you need something that will help you dissipate the heat. @twan which version of the focbox did you have (post a picture if your not sure)
