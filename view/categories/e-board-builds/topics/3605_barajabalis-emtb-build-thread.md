Okay so I'm starting to order all of my parts for my build.
First of all I'd like to thank all of you who helped make this dream come true by buying my shit. I couldn't do it without you 
So far I've ordered the dual rear chain kit with a 10:60 gearing ratio from nowind on ES.  I was informed that chain would be a lot better for off roading because rocks and shit get into the belt drive

I still haven't ordered my board but I am going to purchase this. 
http://www.trampaboards.com/35-holypro-trampa-deck-on-ultimate-trucks-with-superstar-wheels--ratchet-bindings--685t-black-mountainboard-mountainboard-685-t--black-p-12369.html?remove_key=29044&qty=1&offer=0&selector_id=12227&attrib_126=745&attrib_26=101&attrib_14=53&attrib_24=90

It's weird on the website it's almost 800 USD. But when I go to check out it comes down to 600 usd. I'm not complaining just confused. 

I'm thinking about 2 motors at around 200kv or so.

Gonna be running a custom 10s 24 amp hour lipo battery. 
OR just make another 18650 pack maybe..
Will be using gt2b as usual
I'll be adding to this thread with more items and updates

i would reccomend 26650s but i dont know how big or what material your deck is made out of
edit: if its a mountain board why not just get @chaka new motor

His motors don't fit on the 63mm mounting holes of the kit.

Kit was almost 400 usd. The board is 600usd. 

I haven't even bought any electronics yet

Damn, your life must have SUCKED. Where do I send you MORE of my money? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: Lord knows you'll need it for that board alone. I had no idea they were that expensive. :astonished: So sick though.

I need to start ordering motors. And thinking about how much voltage I want to run thru this....

@whitepony any suggestions on motors and voltage? 

I do want a respectable top speed but there is so much reduction happening in these gears. 10:60

I got away with 5.5:1 reduction on 6s and had a top speed of 22mph which is decent. On 10s it'd be ~35mph.

People generally use higher kv motors with 6s and lower kv motors with 10s and 12s, which would explain why your top speed is so poor.

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/diy-trampa-long-35-e-mtb-dual-vesc-sensored-emax-gt5345/2474

You can find 'em at HobbyPartz in 170kv, 190kv, and 220kv.

do you think with a 190kv, 10s would be fine?  I think itll be too slow. but i dont have a balance charger that can go up to 12s.  And i want to avoid running two series packs. 

Thats why im thinking bms is the way to go.

Maytech 6355 190 KV brushless motor for electric skateboards



Found these on. Alibaba. Hopefully gonna get them cheaper than 116. 
I asked maytech (the company) they said that they are the supplier to enertion so I might pick up two of these if I can get them for under 100. Enertion sells them for 130

Sidenote. If you want to do this your self, deflate the tires first before you start uncscrewing the bolts it's not possible to do easily without releasing the air pressure. I included a lot of pictures so I don't have to say much!

I have chosen the CF version.
Right now I'm not sure if I paint the aluminum flat black.
The big r-specs are already on my shelf and waiting.
For me the biggest question right now is the battery. Not t sure if I go the lipo or lion route.
@whitepony is running a big 12s6p pack as well, but I'm unsure if he's happy.
Maybe I try to keep it light and have some spare packs in my backpack while riding.

Are you going to use any special type of paint?  In my experience regular paint just cracks and peels off of aluminum.
I think 12s is overkill for me unless you're running less than 190kv.  I'm going to use 2 190kv 6372 (if @EnertionSupport ever gets back to me about my order)  and @Nowind said I'll get a max speed of 27-28 mph.  At 10s

I'm going with 90 18650 cells at 10s9p or maybe 10s8p

[/quote]

Im running a 10S6P DIY battery which is fine for touring, but Im not convinced by my "trampa touring concept" idea anymore. my Initial plan was to have a 40-50km trampa tourer that allows sidewalk hopping and some jumping on dirt trails. in the end I feel like the trampa is nearly exclusively a hardcore dirt trail machine that has to be as powerful and as light as possible.

i would argue that VESCs also dont fit the trampa at all, cause they cant take high currents - i killed 2 vescs already. nowinds last build is the way to go imo - sturdy small setup with high current Lipos and high current ESCS, made for massive torque.

I haven't bought paint, but I think the most important is the work before.
If I paint them I'll sandblast them before to get a good prepared surface. The primer should "stick" very well on the surface.

@whitepony Now you made me curious  :smiley:
I have seen the big motors too and have to admit that it was impressive. Sadly I have ordered all parts now and there is no way back. If I end up frying VESCs I have to rethink the "small" motors.
Have you thought about changing the stance for your feet?

@Tarzan I don't think normal paint would be good idea, if You plan getting mounts sandblasted, there is no reason why You shouldn't get it anodised black as well ;) The only other type of surface treatment I would see in this application is powder coating, but it's more expensive. 

@whitepony looks like we have same vesc-killing skill, I have 2 on my consciense as well... (but those are weird cases, first burned traces on VESC during nyko kama direction change, no load, in a flat... second, I wanted to get back to BLDC from FOC and probably drv chip failed when connected to BLDC tool, autodetection did not work, but I was able to reflash firmware, read, write config). 

Anyway I went for the same touring concept, and I think I'm fine with it... That's why I chose Trampa Long 35 instead of Holypro, to have more mounting space on board, and I knew it's gonna be heavy anyway, so this few extra grams did not really matter.

I think that this may be more "fool proof" solution. I'd seriously consider it. I mean VESC is awesome, but I was really carefull when dealing with it and still managed to burn one and fu** up another just by trying to reprogram it (although it's a mystery to me how did this happen...)

I have spoken with a guy who does anodizing and he said it it wouldn't work with the used aluminium.
@barajabali  At first I'll stick to the VESC and if i burn them you will have some experience with the TBs to share :smiley:

@Tarzan You can always anodize aluminium ;)  some alloys are just more difficult to treat (harder ones like 7075) Don't know which alloy Jenso use, but I bet either 7075 or something similiar. I used 7075 alloy in my build to mill motor mounts inspired by Jenso, they're anodised black, guy who did this did not have any problems with it and it looks awesome!

Check out my thread to see I'm not talking bullshit :smile:

Just ordered 80 Samsung 25R's. And 10 meters of 10mm wide nickel strip.   
I'm using the same enclosure as @whitepony and the measurements look like they'll fit a 10s8p pack.  

Today I completed my gt2b mod using @MasterCho remote design in black.

I'm gonna go with 2 TB esc's.

Got most of my parts in except for my motors which I'm not getting any word back from enertion when they are shipping.  I guess that "free shipping" deal they have for orders over 300 bucks is that cut rate shit. I would have paid more for faster shipping. I don't even know if they shipped it and they won't respond to my emails or messages. 


Let's just say I'm not an enertion fan boy. But they got good shit.

The type 500 box can just barely fit only the cells.   The bms i ordered is HUGE 200mm by 120mm.. So what im thinking is the center box will carry only cells while the rear enclosure will carry the ESC's, BMS, BEC, Receiver and charge port.

Or maybe i just dont use a second enclosure....?   I know the BMS needs to be protected but maybe some heat shrink around that will do the trick..  an entire new enclosure will add so much more bulk.  Ive looked into a single bigger enclosure but there are just so many electronics and cells that it cant possibly fit.

I was using the outdoor type 500 box on my build with a 10S6P battery. in retrospect, it IS a good idea to have a separate box for the compnents that get hot, i.e. ESCs, since your battery will suffer from the heat and worse: only the side facing the ESCs will become hot and age faster. I basically built a chamber within the outdoor 500 box with the vesc having air vents and the was separated by a wall and insulating aluminum reflective foil. :stuck_out_tongue:

i think it could be adjustable, but see all the circuitry below the wiring for the battery hookup? you would have to repeat that strip for every additional cell you would want to add on. and even then there is no guarantee that it wouldn't fry your battery, esc, bms itself, motor, etc.

So what do you guys think ....  The bms just barely fits in the box but that's before I wire it up and put heat shrink. And that's with my forcing the box closed... 

I'm thinking about how I can make this work because I think it would be be so sick to have them fit together in one box.. I have an extra type 500 box that I can put it in along with the electronics but it's kind of ugly to have two of them and they don't really fit on the board together

I was thinking about water proofing the ESC's and just keeping them exposed.. Or should I find an enclosure for them? 

Either way not sure what I can do with the bms... I can get creative. I was thinking about cutting a hole in the top of the box and use the metal "heat sink" (I know it's not a heat sink) as a guard

WIRES AND MESS EVERYWHERE. 
Yea so it's coming along very well. 
It charges
I have most of the electronics in the 206 box 
Both boxes are solid mounted on the deck. 

To -do 
I am still waiting for 6374 motors (a month or so now and the eta was supposed to be july 1 but you know how dates get pushed back. So two weeks on those) 
I literally can't find a eye pleasing place to put a loop key.(opinions?? No room in either box)
I need to wire /program the electronics.
Thread lock it all up. 

Get some lights n shit

Thank you! 

And you think i should put the xt90s on the side of the box? 

I may just direct solder the ESC's but if one burns out or something I would like easy access to replace them (though they are the most reliable ESC's ive owned)

The xt-90 on the side will be perfect, if you can fitted. 

As for the ESC if you can install a couple of fans on top of the heat sink then this SOB will be invincible. I have push mine as hard as I can going uphill (+ 30deg +208lb ) on grass and the fans have save the ESC multiple times, by allowing the heat cutoff feature to engage, before the fan, I just burned a couple of this baby's. 

I think you can fit a 10mm thick fan in there.  if not you may have to cut the top of the box to fit the fans. I understand you may want to have a water proof box for them, but they are water resistant. Just make a couple of drainage holes on the box.

This is a big battery 10s8p with a 150 amp bms and charger. 

Box is around 35ish I believe
Cells add up to about 400 
Bms +charger 165 ish
Displays+high voltage on off switch 50
 Plus all of the other things heat shrink nickel strip etc. 


Just in parts alone it's about $700. Lol I can build you one if you want :) I have an extra box laying around.  There are ways to make this much cheaper

Okay, so
 I got the r-spec 190kv 6374's in. and I installed them they were perfect and pack a nasty punch.

Finished up most of the wiring enough to get a test ride in (which is why its all messy, i know i need to clean it up)    :( 

I installed the fans because when i'm riding, after 15 minutes or so the heat sinks get too hot to touch.  especially when im riding off road.  The fans will solve that.  12v 40 mm fans

I got another bike light that i always use and i need to wire that in

im powering the fans and the light from a 2 in 1 ubec, with 12v and 5 v output. 

I had to flip the truck to get it ready for a goofy stance ( that was a whole thread in itself!) I also just did some general tidy-ing up. but its no where near done. 

I still need to wire the fans, and the anti spark- on off switch instead of the xt90s i have on it now. i need to solder the esc's on directly instead of a bullet connection.  The main issue im having now is i'm all out of room in the boxes to out shit! I have 2 Ubecs, 2 esc's, a receiver, a high voltage on/off switch, plus all the wires and the battery and bms in the boxes, its hard to fit it all.  need to wire displays in too. 

Other than the days worth of work that still remain! this thing rides A-Freaking-MAzyingly. 
It is unlike anything ive rode before and is worth the 3 grand ive spend on it. I feel like i can ride through the amazon rain forest and still have enough juice to get home. it's got so much torque because of the motors and the 8P in the battery. It rides so smooth, still scary at high speeds. 

battery doesnt get hot at all but the ESC's do when i ride off road for a while. 
 @Nowind kit is amazing, it rides quiet and i havent had any issues at all with it.

Hey @barajabali I wondered if I could pick your brain on some stats/links that might make my life so much easier as my board is pretty much the same but 12s7p pack and sk3 instead of r specs so here goes (apologies for so many questions in advance)

What gauge cable did you use between battery and Esc?
Did you use a fuse between batt and ESC and what size if so? I have a 12s version of the same BMS you have and I see it has short circuit protection and a 150A limit anyway so is it really required?
Do you have a link for the sbec for 12v and 5v?
What antispark switch are you using? Torque Boards? And if so is just 1 rated high enough Amps for 2 of his ESC?
What will your fans be activated by? Permanently on or temp sensor?

My thinking was to run from the battery into XT150 connectors, then through a shunt for power analyser which would then split into two legs which would each have a 80a fuse and holder, XT90 antispark loop key (bit of a pain having 2 seperate but I was under the impression the torque boards anti-spark was only designed for 1 ESC) and run separately to each ESC. All this would be using 8AWG cable. Can you see any problems with that arrangement that could save me some heartache (or anybody for that matter) I get the feeling that 8AWG may be overkill but it's what I have on order so...
Was gonna PM you but figured some others may benefit from the answers.

Cheers from Aus!
Shane

All done! I burned one of my flier soft switches and I replaced it and it seems to be working but hopefully it doesn't burn out again. Might be hit or miss. I installed percentage and volt meter. Fans all work. Its working perfectly! Only last touches that need to be done are reinsulating a motors phase wires because it is shorting causing a heavy drag on the wheel. I need to secure the headlight. and then just ensure that the soft switches aren't burning out anymore. Other than that it works perfectly! It can take me up a loose dirt hill at a very steep angle. It is surprising how much torque it has to be honest. 

Can't wait to wrap up the minor stuff :) but I'm very pleased

Yes the adhesive broke but it's usually fixable as long as the motor doesn't short out when the phase wires get sucked in.

I'm afraid this motor is unrevivable, there was somewhere an internal short in phase windings and I couldn't locate it, it would require to remove all of it and wind new one. I decided to give myself a try and dip all of it in resin as I hoped it would get in between shorted wires and isolate them, but it didn't. What I meant by previous post is that I tried to push out this bearing housing with front cap from GT5345 motor by clamping stator in a vice and trying to hammer out this part, but it wouldn't even move, stator bent instead...

She's got some miles on her, maybe 60? I've had to do heavy heavy testing on this 

ride till something breaks, if nothing breaks then ride harder

So I rode until I over torqued the motors and broke the stator bond. I fixed those and placed the phase wires a little better, reinsulating everything twice and replaced broken wires.  I just put 10 really hard off road miles on it. I'm pretty much done with this build I may add a USB. But other than that. I'm done :) 

Doesn't seem like anything will break anymore the motors were the only issue
Id give it a 30-35 mile range on asphalt
Off road idk...15-20? 
Numbers aren't accurate what so ever

So sick! Great job, man. She's a beauty. Looks like a production model. What would you say was the final cost of this build? Gonna have to build one of these someday. :thumbsup:

Hmm it cost about 2500 dollars. I'll come back and do a detailed breakdown on parts for those of you asking. 
But thank you this is the most fun bord I have ever rode. Ever.

ive been waiting for trampa to restock their parts for over 3 months. when they finally get their stock back up and running im considering getting a board from them but my concerns lay with the sprockets and chain. im not sure where to get them from. I was wondering where you guys got your chain drive parts from?
