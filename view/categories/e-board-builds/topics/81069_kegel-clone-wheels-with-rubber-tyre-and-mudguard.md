What about them?
Is this a review? 
For sale?
There's other threads discussing them.
Board looks cool. Thread is just empty. 
Could easily be a post in pictures no words.

I like the board... i wasn't trying to be an ass.
I just didn't understand the thread. 
(And i don't love being called boy lol)
How are the wheels working for you? 

I've seen other members having issues with the cores.
