This may sound like a total newbie question but I received my Caliber 2 trucks and my Orangatang caguama wheels. im using Drive Gear- Kegel Orangatangs 32T from Evolve. all nice stuff. when I put the wheels on the truck axle the axle is to short to secure the wheel nut. what do you have to do. is it possible to change the axle on the truck to a longer axle ?

The "Caliber E" are Caliber2 with longer axles.  Also the Torqueboard 218mm trucks are like Caliber E except with longer truck hangers.

thanks for responses but sorry no help.i need longer axles not hangers. although the video of cutting the hanger looks to be the closest solution. Can't find Caliber E trucks online unless someone has some the are willing to part with. I dont see Torque boards selling any trucks.
