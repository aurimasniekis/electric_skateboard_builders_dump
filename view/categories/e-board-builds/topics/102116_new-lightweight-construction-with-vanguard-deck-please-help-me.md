Hello, I have a fast and heavy eboard (dual motor, 12s5p battery) and now I would like to make a lighter one with autonomy of about 25km, I do not need it to be fast, it will be to do carving to go to work.
I have these components:
Board loaded Vanguard flex 4 (I weight 56kg)
calliber trucks,
one 6355 torqueboard motor,
one Motor mount with 16t and 36t pulley,
one vesc torqueboard v4.12,
TorqueBoards 2.4ghz Nano Remote Controller.
I need a battery (already built, no lipo), which one do you recommend for this construction?
I need an antispark? If so, which one do you recommend?
I would like a speed between 25km / h or 30km / h and 25km of autonomy
Thank you very much, I hope your recommendations.
I live in europe

I'd do a nice 10s4p, or 10s3p for even less weight with a eboosted enclosure. Loopkey as an antispark.

And maybe some extra parts to make a dual drive train.

10s3p

This should be your minimum to achieve your 25km, and I also agree with pundahh about getting a dual drive train. I know its quite expensive basically doubling your drivetrain cost, but in the end its worth it. The vehicles feel much less like a toy :p

@Sn4pz @pundahh Do you know where you can buy a 10s4p battery? I live in europe .
The reason why at the moment I only put one motor is by weight and if I fall short of power I put another motor :-)
