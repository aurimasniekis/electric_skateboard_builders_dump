8s5p 30q or 8s4p Sanyo ncr20700b at least because the ESC only is rated for 8s and you need at least 40 cells.

So for MTB, it uses 20wh/km. That means that if you want 20km range, you need: 3.7v*8S*5P*3A=444Wh, 444/20wh/km=22,2km.
So 8S*5P=40 cells of 30Q. My initial assumption about 30km range was incorrect. 
If you want 30km of range, you'll need 8S7P or around 56 cells in different configuration.
