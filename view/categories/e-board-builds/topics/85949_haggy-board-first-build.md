So many good links here to help you.
Where are you buying from and what sort of deck are you planning on using/do you like?

The unity can be purchased through the "BUY FOCBOX UNITY" button at the top left of this website. I highly recommend it.

Buy a battery pack from @hyperIon1. I highly recommend it as well.

Before asking all the questions you have, seriously, read the linked thread. It might seem snarky but there is seriously a TON of good info there. 

After you read that and decide you're ready to build a DIY beast you'll have a better idea of what direction you want to go.

Then hop over to [this thread](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/noob-question-thread-ask-your-questions-here/9559)  and fire away with all your questions.

Good luck in your journey brother. Welcome

Update! I’ve ordered the haggy drive 2in 1 set yesterday and it’s on it’s way the service I got from Timo who I think owns the company was first class answering all my questions quickly and he even sent me the tracking information and pictures of everything straight away I’m now in the process of ordering a battery I’m going for the 10s4p high discharge bms I’ve not a clue what all this means even after reading up on it but I’m assured it’s a great battery I’ll post some pictures when everything comes 
Thanks bobby

I have drooled over the haggyboard kit. Looks like a quality kit. I have only read good things about the bergmeister wheels. Looking forward to hearing what you think of the kit. And if you are charged import fees? Which deck are you thinking of using? Have you figured out where to source your batteries and enclosure from? When ordering the Unity from enertion you can try the 10 % discount code Y34Rdf
Good luck!

Careful with that code... It nullifies free shipping. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it hurts. Unity is a great product.

Thanks  for the link I’m actually enjoying finding out what works and what doesn’t luckily I’ve got a good budget so I can avoid the cheaper fittings and hardware I’m currently trying to find a unity as everything is on backorder I don’t suppose you could recommend a seller? Thanks for everything bobby

Double check the measurements of that battery and Alan's enclosure. I don't think it'll work.

Thanks for the warning, Alan said the enclosure fits a 13s 5p so if I’m gonna go slightly less at 12s5p would this fit ? The battery dimension is 370x135x33 is also be fitting a unity in there 
Many thanks for your help 
Bobby

Awesome build!

You could also get this enclosure.

https://eskating.eu/product/abs-enclosure-38x165x530mm/

It fits the 12s5p from them and it's the same used on their dual beast with evo deck.

Plus it's a bit cheaper and you won't have to pay taxes.

The difference between this one and the eBoosted is that eBoosted uses glas fiber so it's basically a tank.

Eskating uses ABS.

I've never owned any of the enclosures but both should be pretty good :slight_smile:

Alan's enclosures are very well made, no doubt.

This is what 13s5p looks like in the evo 39, it's not just a drop in solution haha.

The eskating enclosure from @fottaz will quite literally cost 1/4 of the price after shipping, customs and import fees from RM. 

Even better though for a 39" evo you have @bigben right here in the UK, his enclosures are extremely under priced for the work he puts in :joy:
