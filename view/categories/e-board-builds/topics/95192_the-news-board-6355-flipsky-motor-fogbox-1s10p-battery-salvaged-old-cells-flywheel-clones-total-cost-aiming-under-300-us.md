Too many users fleeing the administration I think.  Build looks good but I would be going for better cells in a 3p config.  Other than that cool as.

There is no way this parts list is under 400. Right now you are looking at easily 700 to finish it with thr cheapest stuff

Noooooo dont do that. The battery should really be the most expensive piece of any board. If the battery sucks, the board sucks.

If you want to make a budget board, dual motors is not the way to go. Ultra cheap would be a single 6374 setup

Just might skip the remote and turn motor on or off. Gonna be a hell of a challenge!

Accidently dropped the flipsky motor in the toilet and the harvested cells shorted out. 

Not really feeling this build any more lol. 


When will the  forum be up and running again @longhairedboy @mmaner ?

I'd better use motherboard lithium cells from old pcs, so you can fit 1S200P in that baby. infinite range if you add solar panels from old calculators.
