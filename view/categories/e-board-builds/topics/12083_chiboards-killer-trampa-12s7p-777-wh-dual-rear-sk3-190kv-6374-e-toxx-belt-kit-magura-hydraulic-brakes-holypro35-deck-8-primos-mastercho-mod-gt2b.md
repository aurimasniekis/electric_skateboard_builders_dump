So i've built a few Trampas in the past, and I've supplied parts to a whole lot more. I've decided that it's time for me to get a preorder going on my Trampa's seeing as a lot of people seem to be interested in the these guys. I found @Rob.Endless who was looking for the most badass Trampa he could get his hands on.  He's a perfect beta tester for my final prototype board- He's known for breaking shit and riding hard.  That's exactly what I need.  

Aside from Rob, I have my parts in a lot of builds and I have yet to have a complaint or issue.  I figured it was time to get a complete going.  My current board is upgraded to the exact same specs as @Rob.Endless so I can double as a tester.  IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BEING A BETA TESTER PM ME ( you'll get a great deal) If all goes well I will be releasing a pre-order in the few coming months. There is a lot of interest in these Trampas.  I will offer it in a kit form, or RTR (ready to ride) 

ANY HOW lets get to the reason you're all here.   
This build will reflect 92.546% of the final product. 

12s7p 777Wh (nominal) 150 A BMS with fast 4A charger, Water proof battery box 84 samsung 25R Lithium Ion Battery made by the marvelous @barajabali  ;) 
E-toxx belt drive kit 25mm belts by @Nowind
Dual SK3 190kv 6374 motors
Dual sensored 120A ESC's / built in sbec
Trampa 685 brake board (Magura Hydraulic vented disc brakes) BLACK, heel straps
Water/snow/dirt proof Electronics box dual fan cooled w/ custom made fan vents by @cj1556  
Emergency cut off switch with 150A draw breaker limit
Head lights
8" primo wheels pneumatics

I'm working on this while I'm still taking battery orders.  It will not affect lead times.  I have (3) 12s7p batteries to make  which are much faster to make all together than separately. 

I will update with progress

Yes, I have tried chains. Frankly I wished chains were the better option due to them being much cheaper... but there is a reason that belts are more expensive. 

Chains don't do well in water, I found that they were really loud, had a lot of rolling resistance, needed constant maintenance, were kinda messy (oil), and didn't look as bad ass... haha

Belts pretty much are the opposite of all of those. The only downside to belts is the possibility of crap getting in the belts. Which is actually less often than I thought

Thanks man! I appreciate the support from you and everyone else :slight_smile:

That's a good question. My goal is for this to be sold at a price not much higher than what you (the consumer) would have to pay to build it yourself. 

That is the goal but we will see what this becomes

Don't forget to factor in a good profit for your work.. and also shipping costs.  Warranty is a big thing if you're planning on selling this to everyone including the general public.  They'll be sending it back to you for any minor thing that goes wrong, so don't forget to factor that into cost. 

After all that you may have a high price, but there isn't really a quality complete MTB available on the market.  And I'd rather pay more for a quality board with good post purchase support.

Looking forward to build photos of this.

You're right the cost will likely be over 3 grand but considering what you're getting for the price it's kind of a steal in my opinion. I know getting that high in numbers scare people away but I invite people to price it all out on top of labor and see if it's something they'd be willing to go for. As of right now my profit is minimal and if anything goes wrong my profit is gone lol with all the bells and whistles I don't expect to take my money home but what is more important to me is the valuable ride time I need from my beta tester.  Also I plan to keep the price at close to what it currently is ~2900 but reduce the cost of items via economies of scale. That is why a preorder is exactly what I will be needing in the near future. I will also be using my own mounting system which would cost much less than the current system I use. 

I plan to sell this to us performance eboard builders in kit form (really that way is just to get all the parts cheaper) and then of course an Rtr version which will be marked up for labor.  The kit will include a preassembled battery bms system since that's gonna be hard to do alone. But the rest I believe would be fair game. Not sure if there would be interest in that...I assume it depends on how much Cheaper it is I guess.

Any how here's some pics of a fully spot welder pack. To Get to this point it takes me about 3 hours from starting. 1350 spot welds (I did the math) <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/3/a3a046cb432d0c1936c5d7ca02ed34a526eb6ea6.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/9/69853160ef3fcab187a4c615742a837260d02220.JPG" width="500" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/6/6679e99adb3bd57d029554ebb9d3b00416f25969.JPG" width="500" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/b/6bc17a994b9810f2cfdd371308d651e5235dcd56.JPG" width="500" height="500">

I spot weld in three stages. The first parallel layer gets 4 welds. The next series later gets 2 welds and the last layer gets 2 welds. The spot welder is strong enough to penetrate all three layers which means all 8 welds on each end actually weld to the battery itself.

I'm not too worried about weight, before this hobby, I used an electric unicycle (I still have it and use it here and there), and it weighs about 30lbs, maybe a bit more. I also don't use any of my electric skateboards or unicycle for commuting. I don't carry these things around lol, it is all just for fun.

Hey B. I was at the hobby store the other day like I told you. Several people walked up to me to look at the Trampa and your battery/esc set up. They asked how much and I told them 3G's roughly depending on how many bells and whistles they wanted PLUS shipping. 2 of the guys said "that's not bad". One of the guys told me he went to an R/C car race event and went through 600.00 of tires in one weekend. So people who want to do this know what they are getting into.

@barajabali I've got a couple questions and thoughts.

1. Do you plan on offering MBS boards at any point? The Trampa's are obviously amazing boards, but unless I'm missing something, it looks like you're spending at least $400-500 for just the rolling board, right? It seems that MBS has some lower priced $200+ options (assuming they'd work), and they're US based, so less shipping cost and exchange rate issues, I would guess. 

2. Have you tried single drive on your MTB's, and do you think it could be a viable option for an entry level board, flat trail cruiser or really light riders? 

3. How about offering some lower priced versions that are kind of modular and upgradeable, like single drive variants or the option for a lighter, cheaper, half sized battery? Use the same basic components as your killer build, and offer battery, dual drive and component (wheels, deck, etc.) upgrade packages for those who bought lower priced versions to start. You might be able to reel in some of those folks that might be willing to spend $1500-2000 just to get on the dirt, and have options to upgrade down the line.

@Mobutusan

1) I dont plan on making any MBS boards. the Trampa boards I buy have a retail value of about $750 dollars shipped to my house. I wanted to start on the best rolling board i could find.  I dont want to put 5 star electronics on a budget board. I figured that the best board on the market was Trampa, The full carbon fiber deck, the insane assortment of hubs and tires, the amount of customization that can be done to all of the aspects of the boards, The already proven capability of electric Trampas.  I want to spare no expenses for my boards. 

2) In the future i plan to design mounts for the urban carver I will not however be working on the street carver.  I think that a single motor would only be viable with Urban carvers. A single drive mountain board just simply wouldnt do its job right.  But a single drive urban carver with maybe a 149 kv 6374 on 12s may just be alright.

3) I am currently looking into that option to reduce the price of the build with minimal sacrifices to performance.  The way I see it is, if youre gonna spend $2500 you may as well spend $3000 for double range or whatever else options.  The fact of the matter is that these boards are expensive and most means of downgrading will just make for a sad board.  For example, my current drive system has a lot more rolling drag than a urethane wheel, a 12s3p battery would crumble under the amount of voltage sag, current draw, and general capcity needed to have a good time on the board.  So a smaller battery isnt really an option.  These big boards, need big batteries not only for range but for basic use!  I may have different options to make the board cheaper for example headlights, usb, heel straps, hydraulic brakes, etc. Options, but the battery and drive systems will likely stay the same. 

@Photorph

I will have a 4wd version of this on a "made to order, by request" system  ;)  Likely will have a battery rated at 12s10 p to try to combat some range issues.

[/quote]

trampa board material is some secret ingredient fiber, but its not carbon!

do you do touring with your trampas? i had a 10S6P trampa with exactly your battery layout, and somehow the stance didnt work for me for longer distances. and with that giant battery it felt too heavy on my feet for tricks, so it kinda sucked in both possible scenarios. :confused: 

if i ever build another trampa, it will be maximum weight savings and probably the thinnest holypro board so that the camber levels out when i stand on it.

p.s.: and direct spur drive like @elkick @nowind with a cover. chain is too messy, with belts i got too many stones worked into my belt even with my street boards! think dpur gear are the most compact and least problematice way for dirt!

I stand corrected! Although, it is "unbreakable" and fairly light in my opinion. Thanks for the info :slight_smile:

I do, I have never actually rode long enough in one go to kill my battery though. The most I've rode is ~30 miles and the battery had some juice left in it.  

I don't consider this a trick board but some jumping will be just fine, it's more for off roading, and long distance traveling. I haven't had any issues with stance it feels pretty comfortable to me. Maybe you just don't like being strapped in :)

wow, 30mi is a lot! how much do you weight and which board & thickness did you use for that?

strapped in isnt a problem, i can spend weeks on my snowboard! problem is the camber for me! i love camber for the awesome energy it can return, but while riding i need a flat board or actually I prefer a little rocker, so i think i shouldve bought the softest holypro to have a pretty much flat profile when just standing on it.

problem is that it might be too soft for tricks then. i really liked the added energy for jumps by compressing the board hard beforehand. its like a trampoline, but the medium stiffness holypro (i had 16ply) felt right for that.

Yup it's a beast that was on my 10s8p pack. Weight is about 210 lbs, very inflated tires (I was on road) , 17 ply deck very stiff

I sort of disagree, I used to hate riding my vanguard due to its flex I could not ride more than a few miles without it just making my legs sore. My trampa is the opposite it has a bit of flex for a big guy like me but it's stiff otherwise. Also my battery box acts as a flex bridge and doesn't let the deck fold as much

@barajabali Bro, that is SICK! Love the snow chains as well. I'm so tempted to upgrade and get those disc brakes in the new year. 

As you battery packs look so well made. Love.your work

Hey - is it somewhere on this forum where the **differences between the decks** are discussed? 


----
I would love some sort of chart, to find out which board type (stiff, soft, spongy etc) would work best for my needs! .. I actually bought my board blindly, mainly choosing from the looks! :D Only now, after riding one, I have started to compare and witness the characterestics this (and other) boards offer!

Nice build / board anyways! Looks great with the chains on!

@Photorph yea I love the bajaboards I can't hate on it but I don't think I have to mention that it's not as cool as it was 4 years ago. It seems like an rc car you can stand on. Looks like it too. 

I'll be happy to go head to head with a bajaboard :)

I came across the bajaboard about a year ago or so. I prefer a Trampa build, it seems more durable and also way less bulky. The E-Toxx belt drive simply looks bad ass. Along with the bindings and flexible deck, it will be hard to beat.

It does look like a big r/c car and that's what make it look so cool. I'm not hating on it, but for the money, I have it on a E-toxx Trampa build.

Just a small update

The e-toxx kit has arrived! Thanks @Nowind

We decided to go with SK3 6374 192 kv motors instead of the original motors which we deemed as not ideal/defective on arrival for this build. (Wasn't allowed to return defective or fully working motors)

Everything is coming in finally and this build should be done within a week or two. I will post major updates very soon!

My biggest concern is tires. I have 1000 plus miles on my CGT and all of my urethane wheels are the same diameter, they pretty much last forever. I'm pretty sure I can't say the same about these trampa tires. Looks like I will have to stock up on some extra wheels and tires, mounted and ready to go.

I was on Trampas website looking at wheels (superstars) with various tire combos.  There is an option about bearing support spacer sizes. I'm not sure which ones I need. 

There are three options: 

Spacer to fit onto 9.525mm axles

Spacer & O-ring to fit onto 12 mm axles

No bearing support spacer required

Pavement is a big killer for sure. Best goal was with brand new Primo Alpha Tires on the MBS Board. Maybe you know the video,  drifts on pavement and high speed corners.... 6hours until you can look through the tire on the back (-; but this was extrem. In generall i have good expierence with Trampas Mudplugger. They are grippy and last longer, also i really like the look of them. But if you plan to ride almost on pavement maybe best choice are some Slickline Trampa Wheels. Cheers

I have not gotten a chance to hit full speed at full charge yet.... but i'm fairly sure the top speed of 30mph is totally accurate if not an under estimate. I will test and update.  The hydraulic brakes are a bit soft even after bleeding, I dont think there is any air in the lines most likely just an alignment issue.  The belt drives have a lot of drag as usual with dual 25mm belts, i will be adding silicone lube and in a few miles the belts should stretch a bit and glide more. The SK3 motors are boss! I think i found my motors for future preorders!  

I dont have much else to say! i suppose i will after more testing :) Thanks for the support guys! stay tuned on my instagram (im trying to grow that lol)  And be aware of an upcoming preorder with very limited quantity! 

thanks to @Rob.Endless for letting me document this process! youre gonna love this beast!

You could use 15mm it's been done before but the torque transfer with 25 is so amazing.

Hi Rob, The Support spacers Are meant to be used, when using a 12mm ID bearing on a 10, or 9.52mm axle. The MTBs have 12mm axles (except the Ultimate). So no need for them conversion spacers. The Rubber O-Ring is basically swallowing tolerances. We use a short bearing spacer + Rubber O-Ring to eliminate any play. The bearing spacer is 1mm short, the O-Ring is 2mm thick. When winding down the axle nut you compress the rubber O-Ring and eliminate any play.

Really nice work Bara! One thought on the wiring : the SK3 are really good and reliable motors, only the unflexible Phasewires need some attention... you should secure this wires on the Braces. In a way that they dont move with every turn. The movement should be in the flexy silicon wires from ESC.
Just my 2 cents.
Again very nice work Bro.

Most of the wires are silicon wires, meaning the motor leads are chopped to an inch or two. I find that when attach them it actually puts more stress on the leads. The way I placed them let's them move if they need to!

Also the leads leaving out side the back of the braces seem to work the best for me

Hi Jens, SK3 Motors have the copper windings bundled and these exit the Motor straight out. This way there are no solder joints inside the motor, which is more efficient. Anyway, we made the cables very short, so that the Silicone wire coming from the ESC swallow the movement, rather than the stiff motor copper cables. Our extended motor shield allows to really lock down the motor cables next to the bullet connectors, using a zip tie. If you like the SK3 design, you will love the Trampa SK3, improved in every detail, made to perfection.

I will be shipping tomorrow but the range test was done today and the range is about 12-15 miles depending on many variables. 

With the combo of pneumatics, dual 25mm belts, and my 230lb butt the range is lower than I hoped. 
 
But after about 5-6 it begins to feel uncomfortable so it's not too bad.

As the belts stretch and I pump the tires up to their required 60psi the mileage should improve. I believe I have them at 35 psi now

Well, I weigh around 150lbs or so, 15 miles is plenty.  My biggest concern with riding an EMTB Trampa is the camber of my feet (think bow-legged if you know what I mean). I can ride for 15+ miles straight on the CGT without ever stepping off the board. I hope the shape of the Trampa deck will be comfortable for long rides.

exactly that somehow was my biggest issue with the trampa. not sure why noone else seemed to have that problem. :p I weight 82kg on the 16ply holypro! its not completely leveled out when I stand on it, even though the flex overall feels soft and really comfy!

my vanguard has camber too, but that one is really leveled out perfectly and most often during carving its actually in rocker shape!

@barajabali that range is really less than I anticipated. then again with 777Wh, 15miles is about 30Wh/km which is pretty much what @Nowind also experienced. guess that superwide double belt is really eating up some energy. :confused: would be really interesting to see how much wh/km jens got with the spur drive. a low friction transmission should make 15-20wh/km possible (my evolve AT with single motor and high pressure tyres managed 15Wh/km).

@whitepony Can you give some more specs on the evolve GT.. ? What wideness belt does it run (15mm?) ?
Also - at what speed were you cruising?

This is a cool concept to test.. how much chain drive vs belt drive consume.. I got around 19-20wh for my board, only single drive 6s 192kv 4.33 ratio with pretty wide  9inch wheels (at around 2bar, not max pressure) and soft deck and 15mm belt, avg speed around 15kmh.

Should make a better test once the warm season returns. I plan on building / modifying the existing board to fit on shorter deck and about 6'' narrow pneumatic wheels.

You'll get unrealistically long range on the treadmill since you won't be dealing with wind resistance. Especially if you're gunning the thing -- over 15 mph wind resistance starts becoming a big factor, the force needed, and consequently the battery drain, rises dramatically.

Hi 

The problem some times here is not with the camber but with the bindings, depending if the veins on the top of your foot are too pronounce then the pressure from the bindings will restrict the blood flow causing your feet to go numb. 

You will want to tighten the bindings just enough to feel secure and be able to hook your foot under it to maneuver but not too tight as to cause the numbness of you feet.

Also true with me. I'm 145 lbs and my Trampa is 14 ply.  I don't use the heel straps so I tend to tighten the bindings more sometimes and that kills my feet.  But when I start feeling something then I just loosen it a little bit and it's fine after that.

Tried riding without the bindings, it didn't work. It's hard to ride without bindings when you get used to it.

hm, maybe that was the problem. Im a raceboard veteran though, spend more than 20 years in really tight and stiff hardboots for max edge pressure ... so I am somewhat used to pressure on my feet. switched to very stiff softboots 2 years ago with very tight strap bindings, so its pretty much the same pressure point as the trampa straps. :confused:

Yeah, my feet go numb as well if I have the bindings cinched down too tight. I've found it helps to adjust the brackets so they really hug the sides of my shoes. Kinda locks your feet in without having to crank down on the straps. Heelstraps help too. 

My weight doesn't even come close to flatting out the camber on my 16ply; and I'm pretty sure if it did, I'd probably bottom out if I were to ever hit any jumps.

For anyone who doesn't like camber, I'd recommend looking into MBS' new comp deck. It's not as pretty as the Trampas, has zero flex and is probably nowhere near as durable, but I do like the asymmetrical concave. Gives the balls of your feet a nice spot to dig in. Guess the pro97 deck has this as well, but the comp95 is the only one I have any experience with. 

The round tip interferes with the wheel sprockets on the beltdrives though. Gonna have to do a little reshaping.

@whitepony Yeah, just saw you mention AT now, sorry for misunderstanding..

Do you have a theory why you got so good mileage (with evolve AT)? 

The first thing what came to mind.. that perhaps this AT motor(s) run more effiecient.. since I've also heard there is a differene between sensorless brushless motor power consumtion vs sensored ones.. just not sure how much difference, so it is also hard to compare whenever these stepper motors could also run better than sensorless ones :slight_smile:

Ok, good to know. Perhaps, as you say, the mechanical parts were flawless and offered very little resistance..

Tire pressure is probably a big factor here

Tires I have can only be safely pumped till about 3 Psi, not more, and I run them at 2 psi, as I busted one rim when I was careless and overinflated one of the wheels..

Im sure @JTAG or @evoheyax could chime in about the sensored / sensorless power consumtion difference. But will see. Im not sure about @Jtag but I think @evoheyax has had extensive experience with different setups and has accumulated quite a knowledge..

I haven't had a chance to mess with sensor yet honestly, so I may not be the best person to talk about them, though I have researched them quite a bit.

!im not sure about the power consumption, but reading through the last 20 posts or so, I would say it could be your weight, tests I've done show weight is an important factor in range. Is heavier guys pull higher amps to get the same place as a lighter person. I have a 12s4p (504 Wh) and I only get 5-6 miles, with 80mm hummie hubs. In my opinions, slight inefficiencies become exaterbated by weight.

Maybe try without the sensors and see what kind of range you get? I should be messing with sensors in the next month or so. (As both hummie and I have been talking about sensoring his motors), so I can say more about their power consumption then. Maybe @Jinra would know if sensors use up more power?  He runs only sensored motors on all of his boards.

Cool, thanks for insight.. ah yeah I knew you had tried 4wd and such.. so somewhere in my mind I made up that perhaps you were the one which had explored more uncommon options, such as running sensored, too..

In my case I think the tires are the ones responsible.. They are also 9inch ones not 7'' ones and inflated to about 2/3 of their maximum when I tried to measure wh consumtion. 

I'd like to do the test on a somewhat straight road where I can keep the acceleration at the same pace and then see how it goes.. though im a bit rebuilding the board now and the weather (snow / ice) are not very welcome for such tests :D

HI am 200 lb, I have lots of steep hills on my route (I live in the sunset district of Sam francisco, we have some of the worst hilly roads), I like to stay in the upper 20's mph as much as possible (I rarely go below 20 mph unless I have to stop for traffic), and I'm pulling too close to my max amp rating. I have gotten maybe 150 full charge and discharge cycles and my range is getting way worse already. I can't even make I 4.5 miles now on a full charge. This is why I said about the raptor 2, he's crazy to do high amps in those cells like that. The cells will sag heavily, which is not desirable and the batteries life will be greatly reduced.

Honestly, I'm going back to lipo until I can find a better battery technology. They never gave me the kinds of issues I've had with li-ion. Their discharge curve keeps high volts for a longer time before it drops off like li-ion does and they are safe if you get them from the right sources and don't do anything stupid to them (use a bms with proper vesc cutoffs).

I would love to see what kind of range I get from a board like the raptor 2, as the battery is a fair bit smaller than mine. I believe I would only get 4 miles on the raptor 2, as I believe the biggest factors in range is weight and terrain, not the board itself.

My range does suck and I've yet to find a single reason why I get such bad range. It's not the motors also, as I get bad range on my Caron's also.

Maybe you tighten the nuts of your wheels too much. Wrong motor detection maybe. But hummie should know his motors so I think that's not the case. Bad cell batch maybe. I am around 150 lbs and my average is around 10wh and when go hard it goes to 12wh. On my 300wh lipos I get 30-35km (single)  and on my 700wh laptop batteries (dual)  60-70km range. And i am also mostly carving at 30 till 35 km/h on average. 
Maybe somebody else with hummies or carvons with 18650 cells can share its range experience but I would say your range is unique. That's the highest wh consumption I have ever heard of.

I think there was a diagram somewhere.. how much watts at what speed is needed. 

From what @evoheyax is mentioning, it looks like his board with his weight and terrain consumes a similar amount of energy as an e-scooter.. I think for e-scooter consumtion was about 60wh/km but I have to check it once again.. 

Also we should consider he is running 4 motors.. Im not quite sure what the formula is for 4 motors, as for 2 it was 30% less range or so? Someone can correct me on the distance decrease when running dual drive..

Damn I can't wait till u get that board really interested in seeing the performance of the battery and motor combo with those esc's interested in the range and speed you get building one very close to that setup and seriously considering/want battery and esc's with build in sbec from barajabali keep us posted sir

I am surprised this part broke. I have been aggressive inline skating for over a dozen years and straps like these are usually bullet proof. I was pretty excited to take it out this Sunday to a little eboard meet up in LA. I will try to rig something up, connect these two parts temporarily.

First impression, is WOW, this killer Trampa looks freakin soooo bad ass wow, top notch work from Bara. Everything is just WOW, battery pack, electronic set up, etc. also @nowind e-toxx belt is crazyyyyy, looks wayy cool.

Acceleration is very good and top speed is crazy, definitely fast enough to cause major injuries if things go wrong. I am already super confident riding this killer trampa, it only took me like 1 minute to pull the trigger at its max and hit top speeds lol. Not because its a slouch, it is the complete opposite. For me, its the bindings, I feel safer being strapped onto the board. I have yet to go off-roading, I might really suck at it. I will test it off-roading soon. 

Using the motor for brakes will not cut it, especially with people around.  The SK3s has good braking power but it doesn't bring the board to a complete stop, not enough close. Perhaps it is just ESC settings? No complaints here tho, I end up using the disc brakes quite often. I cant imagine riding an EMTB without disc brakes now, I am too used to it.

This thing will eat my CGT for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Its time to mount my GoPro and take some footage.

Hi Rob, braking with motors is good at speed. The lower the speed, the less they grip, since motors have to rotate to act as a generator. Regarding the ladder strap, please open up an account at Trampa and email your account name to me. We will then ship a spare. I need to run that through our system to keep track of Stock...

I am so relieved that nothin else broke in shipping! That thing looks like a beast next to your other board. The light looks badass if I do say so myself :) 
The included programming card can be used to set the brakes higher, I put them st 30% because that is comfortable for me with disc brakes. But you can set them higher if you need to. They become very scary after 40% though. 

@trampa thanks for the service! @Rob.Endless do you want to go with franks solution or should I just do it ?

That is another advantage of hall sensors in your motors, they allow to break to full stop and you can almost have 100% solid breakes on slight inclines (of course not as good as normal disc breakes)

Can you share a picture of it? Those hydraulic lines are a bit tricky to get on correctly. I had to shorten the line a bit and movie it from the right to left since you ride goofy.   For future shipments I am going to make a wooden frame to go into the box to protect it from that

I think you won't even notice it if won't measure by some kind of tracking app. I'm running sensored motors and in my personal opinion slightly slower top speed and lower range is worth the benefits it gives (and due to higher torque you can always compensate lower top speed with lower gearing, it will decrease efficiency but... hell why not :D ).

UPDATE 12-12-2016:  The rain stopped and I was finally able to take it out for a spin yesterday, got about 15 miles with 39% battery life left.  This ride consisted of just non stop high speed runs.  I had the trigger bottomed out for most of the ride.  About 45 mins into the ride, I noticed at high speeds, the motor would chirp for a split second every now and then.  This didn't cause any issues tho.  However, I was just thinking to myself that if this thing braked suddenly, I would go flying at 30mph.

...and what do you know, at absolute full speed, out of nowhere, the motors went from screaming to full on brakes.  I instantly flew forward at 30mph and finally came to a stop underneath a parked car.  30mph to zero real quick.  I was fully geared up, FF helmet, body armor, gloves but no knee pads (I purchased a pair but they were too small)...and what do you know, the only injury I have is road rash on my knees.

The Trampa deck is bulletproof, the e-toxx kit is solid, the carbon fiber braces barely has any scratches on it.  The battery box, ESC/receiver box also solid.  The only thing that broke is the hydraulic brake lines and one of the banjo bolts on the caliper.  Also, the support shaft for the SK3 on one side sticks out more.

Thanks guys, I am pretty much 100% injury free (minus a little road rash on the knee).

I have no idea what happened.  One second the SK3's were screamin' at max speed and the next second they went into full brake mode. It happened so fast, next thing I know I'm somewhat underneath a Camry's rear bumper. 

I thought these ESC would let the motor just coast along if things went wrong. Well, its part of testing the board out, I was pushing it way too hard? Would going max speed for long periods of time cause this?

You probably need to ask @barajabali how he did set it up.. so investigate even more why it might have happened..

What remote are you having btw?

Well, for now I can only tell that you can check the ''failsafe'' mechanism by pushing the trigger of remote.. allowing the motors to spin and then switching the remote off to see if the motors stop gradually (which you might already know probably :D )

Though, I think you should have this option already.. otherwise the second scenario is that the motors keep running continously without pulling the brakes..

For me it looks like some sort of  esc or motor bad failure.. anyways.. not nice

Will probably pay more attention if motor starts to give off any sounds :smile:

--

@Rob.Endless I have not followed up on your other builds / eboards .. but does the other boards stop completely with the esc - motor brake? 

At least mine also does not stop completely.. you can get it to like 3mph / 5kph and then it rolls out.. if you are at an intersection it is better to grap a pole or something to stop completely. Too much braking also sometimes makes it disconnect and I have to restart the esc (running fvt 120 not vesc)

Dam thats a nasty way to go down. Are you in NYC? I have to say it happened to me on various board a few times now. Kinda comes with the territory of this sport. 
Just last week i got speed wobbles on my trampa board going down 8th ave in high speed traffic. Flew off and needed 10 stitches in my head cuz i didnt have a helmet. Also got road rash on my face and a fractured elbow. The smartest thing you ever did was gear up good cuz that could have been the end of you otherwise. Thank God im doing much better now happy to be back out riding (with a helmet now!!)

Also had both my straps break off during my first few rides. They are definitely defective or too fragile. I replaced them with some straps from my old snowboard bindings. But @trampa is welcome to send me some replacements ;)

Anyways back to the issue with your ESC. I think its most likely the failsafe that threw you off. And @Okami, regarding the ESC shutting off with too stong brakes i have the same issue. It has to do with the remote trim settings. Also i put a piece of tape on the remote to block the trigger from going to far forward when braking so i don't ever have that issue.

Oh snap man I'm sorry that happened to you. I did full speed tests on the board when I tested it and I know that if you touche the brake at full speed (wireless brake) it can feel like the motor is locked but really it's just braking. You need to brace yourself for the brakes or it'll toss you off. 

Did you touch the brake when you were going full speed? 
In my testing that's never happened but it might also be because I have a lot of experience riding them
The motor extension shaft can just be pushed back in thats just held with friction. and will only come out if you smash it 

You can send your brake kit including the brakes into me and I'll rebleed them, and reattach the line. 
The brakes come off with one bolt each, there are two bolts on each pad but one is for lining up (I wouldn't mess with those)

@benjammin the body armor definitely saved the day for me, especially because I smashed into a parked car during the sliding part of the crash.

@whitepony you're right, I should keep that in mind, the ride consisted of non stop max speed, only slowing down for sharp turns and stopping at stop signs.

@boardsportsrn I wish it was just something mechanical, everything works just fine.

@okami I actually did not know that, I will try that test out when I get home. Thanks

@mikeomania12 Glad you're okay, could have been way worse, especially with no helmet.  I have had zero speed wobble issues.  I feel like the strap that goes over the foot should have a full on pivot point. The strap that broke before this crash just doesn't line up quite right, which can cause non stop stress.

@guyguy thanks, being geared up helped a lot.
 
@barajabali its, all good bro, I know the risks involved. I am beta testing remember lol. No need to say sorry. I am very careful with the brakes.  I definitely did not accidentally press the brake, I had a death grip on the throttle lol.

Glad that you use protective gear, as everybody should do who´s riding these powerfull Boards.
People often dont do because they think its just a toy...

You could do some easy tests : 
Power on everything, switch off Transmitter, nothing should happen...(no brake/throttle)
power on transmitter again, hitting full throttle, switch off Transmitter... Motors should NOT turn anymore !!!

If this is ok you should also looking for loose contacts/wires.... power on everything, holding throttle, moving the wires : phase / power / reciever ... also Y-wire ... shackling the remote hard ... 

The Shaft extension which comes out : put it back in and use some loctide to secure.

I will try to catch it on video soon, attach a gopro facing the motors or something. It is very rideable still, I just ease off the top speed a bit and coast a lot. I used to just go full speed non stop and only slow down for turns obviously. I rode it around very long straight streets so yeah, top speed runs non stop.

In the future, I have a new set up planned out using Vesc 6 and sensored SK3s. Hopefully for better reliability, for sure smoother throttle and brakes and last and definitely not least, be able to come to a full stop without having to rely on the hydraulic brakes.
