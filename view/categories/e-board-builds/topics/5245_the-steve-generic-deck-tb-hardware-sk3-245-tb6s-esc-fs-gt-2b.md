Hi everyone! New member here, only just signed up but been lurking for a few weeks. Got a couple of questions for my first build for a co-worker. Most parts are on the way I just need advice on motor kv & battery choice. The rider weight - 65kg, required range - corner shop / local park, requested speed - faster than walking, terrain - flat. The calculator is of little help as most common motor choices work. At 6S heat will be an issue. What SK3 would you suggest for him? What 6S? Zippy Flightmax 20C? Does anything 'wrong' stand out with these parts? I have an RC/electronics background but no skate knowledge. Any and all help appreciated.

Flatland, slow, if you stay between 230 and 300kv and you'll be fine.

Thanks, would this suit him better?

It would seem easier to layout 2 X 3S than 1 chunky 6S, can he get by with 2X these?

2x3S is a good way to do it. 245kv is probably perfect for 6S as well.

The package from DIY Electric Skateboards came Wednesday last week. Couldn't get to it till last night, life stuff. Came to Australia quick (about 9 days I think) and was packaged really well with all parts separated in the box. Box smelled like off milk, probably the wheels off gassing or something. All in all pretty impressed. Missed the free shipping option the first order but will take advantage when I stock up on parts for other builds.

The deck needs clear coating as it was originally purchased for an airbrushing project for someone else who changed their mind. Freezing here atm, so waiting for better spraying weather.

Thought I'd assembly the drive wheel as it's the only part I can currently. Had a little trouble the first try as it ended up offset. Got it perfect on try 2 but have no idea how. @torqueboards Is there a trick to it? I have a few builds planned for myself / others and would like it to be a little easier.
Also searched the forum & found this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvljCjOZLUc

Was really helpful understanding what to do. I've used them on racing drones but they all differ ie. remove red wire or don't setup on your flight batt, so on.

@Astrolite_A15 - The trick is all the bolts that come with are fully threaded.
1. 3 Adjacent Bolts from the pulley end into the pulley. **This is to keep the pulley 100% flat against the wheel and line in up.**
2. Go from the front w/ the Retainer Washer and do the opposite 3 Adjacent Bolts from the washer into the pulley.
3. Back out the bolts on the pulley end.
4. Put the bolts in from the front to make a total of 6 bolts.

The FS GT-2B arrived today from Banggood. It's smaller than I expected.

He may be happy with it as is.
The SK3 245kv came in stock in AUS today, so placed my order for it, the Lipos & some connectors (only had 5mm not 5.5).

Only hold up now is the clear coat for the board. Might have to set up my DIY spray booth in the house as the forecast is for 10 degrees for the next week or so and I need to get this done.

Yeah... He was NOT impressed by the GT-2B size, even with the future possibility of changing the case (no 3D printer yet). So placing an order tomorrow for Winning remotes and a selection of parts for the next guy to choose from.

Got the deck clear coated, had to heat up the lounge room & set the spray booth up in there as it's still between 10 & 15 degrees here. First time using it, was cool, looked like a drug lab!

Just as well I'm placing that order. Just went to start adding parts to the deck & noticed I only received 1 riser! Used the "Contact Us" section on DIY's site, hopefully I can throw it in with my order tomorrow. Guess I'll go play video games. :disappointed:

@torqueboards All parts arrived (plus extra!) and checked. Looking good. :sunglasses:

Showed him the winning remote & he liked it. Hopefully I can dial in the settings for it to work well as I hear it can be a bit iffy without using a VESC.

Anyone care to weight in on weather I should mount the motor heel-side or toe-side? As I understand it, heel-side is the way to go but I ride my Carbon AT goofy and the toe-side motor feels fine to me. Thoughts?

Ok, so what do you do when you've finished stripping the head on the motor mount bolt & it's still loose? Epoxy? Buy another $95 AUD mount?

Are you talking about the mount to the truck that's loose? Go to Ace Hardware and replace it with a better bolt. Or did you mean you stripped the threads to the mount also?
```

Yeah the clamping bolt to tighten the mount to the truck. The hex head stripped out before the mount tightened. How would I get this back out? (edit) More importantly, if I do get it out, how do I get the new one to clamp down before; the truck bends, the ruck rips off the board, the tool bends / rounds off?
```

You can change to a better hex bit, that sometimes work. You can use an impact driver or drill with the right bit to get a bit more torque on it. Make sure you heat the bolt up if you got locktite. My sure way is to cut a slot through it and get a flathead to grip. This is a  big bolt though. If all else fails, get a bolt extractor with a similar size head and get it to fit, doubt you need to go this far.

Did you use the heat shrink to get the mount a bit more grip? I even added some epoxy to my mount, it ain't going anywhere.

No on the heatshrink, but that's a good idea. Should fill the gap nicely. The head is counter sunk on one side so might need to get an extractor.

I thought I could forgo my heat shrink too, I was wrong and had to replace also. Good thing a new hex bit got it out. There're other methods out there to get it out, but these have worked for me in the past.

I think I have another hex bit to try in my drill kit. I'll try backing it out once the sun comes up, add a flathead slot and heatshrink the truck.

The other bit was able to undo it 1/100th of a turn before it rounded out again. It was enough to slide it off the hanger at least. Added heat shrink, found an old screw extractor but my cheap/blunt drill bits don't even make a dent in the bolt.

Might just give up (for now) and buy another wheel set for the next build, swipe the hanger clamp from that one and just shift the problem down the queue till I can/feel like dealing with it. Still waiting on an XT-90S anyway and the guys in no rush to get it.

Just using poor quality tools. My bad. All my quality tools are for small things, all my larger stuff is garbage. Only knew about the heatshrink after it was mentioned here. You mean where the mount clamps the hanger, Yeah?

Was it supposed to be in the kit? It only came with 3 small pieces that look as though they are meant for the motor connection. Had some on hand so all good now (aside from the obvious).

It's only meant to wrap around the truck and not used to heatshrink around it. This means you don't have to apply any heat towards it.

In the pic its just slipped on, not shrunk or did you mean the 3 pieces from the kit go between the mount and the hanger?

Yeah, it's slipped on. You'll only need one typically. Just include extra just in-case. It goes between the truck hanger and the truck clamp. Fit them on together and it should be real snug.

No problem at all. :) It should be real snug. It shouldn't be hard to clamp it down and you shouldn't be able to move it at all.

Lol, sorry if I sound desperate to people reading, but don't buy another mount just for a bolt. I have tried using JB-Welding a socket onto a strip nut with success in the past. I'm just tossing ideas out there for you.

compress the clamp in a drill vise, that should take the pressure off the bolt and allow it to be easily removed.

Just tried using the same slipping bit but in a clamp with no success. Had some JB on hand I'd never used, so have a sacrificial phillips head bit (about the size of the hole) setting now. Will give it 8 hours then try it with the clamp again. (edit) I see it needs 24 hours to fully cure, will wait till then.

Does JB weld go bad in an un-opened tube over time? Not sure when I got it but I let it cure about 30 hours & it failed with almost no torque.

Might just go back to plan A: Buy a new drive kit, swipe the hanger clamp and leave the a problem for a future build. Maybe strip the paint, have it welded on & give it to someone else at a reduced cost.

[/quote]

JB weld never works for stuff like this.   You can also try a left hand drill bit.  The counter clock-wise action of the bit will pull the bolt out as it spins.  (versus a tradition drill bit that tightens it)

For future reference, the correct response is to cut the bolt with a dremel:

Was easy to get out after that. Only problem now is the guy is focusing his funds elsewhere at the moment (should of taken a deposit!). I'll put it aside for a month till he gets his house reno's done or set it up for someone else with Li-ion, a BMS & abs enclosure.
