Hi, 
I'm getting ready to purchase a 57KV eLofty style DD motor for an AT street board I'm working on. However, I'm a little confused about how I can get pneumatic AT wheels to work with the eLofty setup. I have a 3D printer but don't want to ride on 3D printed hubs (happy to print and adapter though). 

Are eLofty DDs still worth it?Has anyone had luck with a build like this? 

Most importantly, how can I get pneumatic tires on it? Thanks!

This is your only readily available option as far as I know.
