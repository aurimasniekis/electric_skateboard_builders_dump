Hi All,

Thanks to Endless Sphere and this community I managed to convert my rusty E300.

I will attach some photos later on, but I'm adding parts list with links. Maybe someone will find it useful

Total cost was around Â£400

Here are the links that helped me:

Rad, I've got one of those. I've only upgrade the esc with a higher amp one, and I added a variable throttle. It was a Craigslist find. I paid 60 for it, and my girlfriend rides it when I ride my board. I'm going to rise the deck about a inch so I can fit more, or bigger batteries.

I'd like to see some photos. I was just looking at an old E150 I have sitting in the garage and thinking of adapting a dual  skate truck in place of the rear drive wheel. 

The one thing I haven't totally figured out is what types of wired thumb or pedal throttles will work with the VESC or other car esc's. Did you just reuse the thumb throttle and plug straight into the VESC or do you have to use some sort of adapter? I am pretty sure the E300 has variable throttle but the E150 I have is basically on or off throttle and I will need to change it.

E300 throttle is basically on/off switch. In attached spreadsheet there is link to throttle I used. I had to change the connector to 7 pin so I could plug it to vesc
