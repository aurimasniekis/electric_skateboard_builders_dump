Hi there, I'm bulding my "first" E-Skate and it's a fast penny. 

Here you have pictures of the Vesc enclosure (made by an abs car compartment) modified with Dremel (love this tool, really helpful to dye E-Skates)

And today I modified the deck to let the motor cables fit perfectly under the rear truck (avoiding cables damages, I've burned a Vesc because of the motor wires touched the motor üò£)

there were a few people here discussing if it was possible to turn a penny board to into an E-board.  @longhairedboy might be trying to do it also.

I have already done a ride with this penny but I burned a Vesc in the worst way ever ( cables under the Motors touched the motor and burned Vesc)

I was riding at 40kmh like a Crazy, and was awesome hahah!

So it's possibile and soooo funny, I can confirm it. @Photorph

@longhairedboy I've seen a lot of your projects and the idea of putting cables under the trucks is not so bad :smiley:

I think electrifying a penny should result in some kind of level up or something. Its kind of a right of passage in a way. I can't wait to see what i can do with the one being sent to me soon.

My Penny is almost ready to go, "only" need Vesc (I've ordered an Esc until my Vesc will be delivered from Enertion) 

I also have to get 2x4s in parallel and not in series because of the Xerun xr8 plus that will support 6s max. 

Tomorrow I will test this board üòç
(36t pulley is made by my own with a drill Press and a lot of patience and mistakes but seems to be solid and well done üòä)

@fottaz 
**How much do you weigh?**
I really like the simplicity of this build!
This is the 22"or 27" penny board?
What size trucks are you using?

The total cost of a penny is currently 1.7¬¢, even though it's valued at only 1¬¢

Thanks for the photos. What a powerhouse! Did you find stability to be an issue on such a short deck?
