Hi, Just working up a build list for my Jet Spud deck that originally had an Onan X2 drive (now sold) I took on a Europe trip; I realise some of these parts are not yet available and I have not yet decided on all the parts. Some Australian links as to where parts were already bought.

Deck:[Jet Spud 29"] (https://www.extremeskates.com.au/product/extreme-skates-jet-spud-deck-29-00/)
Motor kit: [Torqueboards direct drive kit](products/torqueboards-direct-drive-motor-kit)

Battery pack: hopefully get this locally made, not sure of size
ESC: [Focbox Unity](https://www.enertionboards.com/focbox-speed-controller/focbox-unity-dual-motor-foc-controller-esc/)  
Remote: maybe [Maytech](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Maytech-waterproof-remote-electric-skateboard-longboard_60824241408.html)

Idk how you can set with the unity, but in the vesc tool it was possible to change the ppm mode from current no reverse with breaks to just current and you had a board drive in both directions.
Sure in the unity program there should be something similar.

But the pictures donâ€™t fit to your description?
Is it your board or only as example?

the pictures are of the deck I plan to use with the old kit on it just for reference and some nice pictures. I would like to update it with the above gear as I like the deck shape and size for travel and commuting though the grip tape was quite abrasive and damaged clothes and skin.
Cheers

Most of the parts have arrived, got battery built by bajaboards since they are the closest that had cells
I ended up going with the benchwheel remote
