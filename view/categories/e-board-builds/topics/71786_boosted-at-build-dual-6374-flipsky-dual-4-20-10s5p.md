These boosted customs are becoming a habit my friend.  This one looks cool as, awesome grip.  Didn't fill your wire channels though hey?  they always bulge lol.  You build like me.  When you find something you like that works then keep on doing that thing.  Love it.  Keep up the good work!

I used form pads to raise the enclosure.  Tried to upload a pic but the site gave me an error

Wait so to confirm you did go with the 12s enclosure? Cause it looks huge compared to boosted

Awesome build man!

Boosted Boards crowd must be jelous of your range and comfort, it's a much better eboard all around and nicer looking too :sunglasses:, the only drawback I can see is weight :weight_lifting_man: 

Please, upload a picture of the 10S5P I'm curious how creative you had to be

Ya, I bought and am using eboosted’s 12a4p enclosure, by cells are stacked 3 high.  The way I got around this is by using foam to line the outside of the case to get more height.  I keep trying to upload photos, but the site doesn’t take them right now.

Here is what the poor foam job I did to get the 10s5p to fit

What did you use to fill the previous holes on the boosted deck? Wood filler? Epoxy?
```

Epoxy mixed with baking soda seems to work.  I used this compound glue before I read about the epoxy recommendation

Also did you get the 10s4p or 12s4p enclosure from eboosted?

I got the 12s from eboosted, but had to use foam pads to get the 10s5p battery to fit.  

I don’t remember the links for the glue or the epoxy stuff.  Will try to look for them and will post here if I find.

How are the motors holding up?
Would you recommend them? 

Do you have any idea what the power output of those things are?

I would recommend the motors, this set had magnet problems and have been replaced.  Actually any of the 6374 and bigger motors have had magnet issues over time.  I think newer designs have retention rings which should help a lot.

@Jasonkimberson What top speed and range are you getting so far? Planning on getting these motors for a budget build. And how did you replace the magnets?

```
Top speed seems to cap out around 24mph with current settings.  Haven’t fully tested the range with this battery.  Yo, been away a few days, the magnet repair went like this, I got a new bell from the vendor.
