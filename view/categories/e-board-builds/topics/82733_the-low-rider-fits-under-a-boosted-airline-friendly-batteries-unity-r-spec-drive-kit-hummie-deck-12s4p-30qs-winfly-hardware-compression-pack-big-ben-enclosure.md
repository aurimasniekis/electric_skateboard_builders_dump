This is my official entry to the [esk8 builder challenge](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/enertion-r-spec-drive-kit-best-build-competition-win-cash-back/75647).

![20190129_153958|375x499](upload://n7lcavogwEIbawtXuL5yfGdoboB.jpeg) 

![20190129_151937|666x500](upload://i6T48JxdoXaulpgVOCgmxkZf2XB.jpeg) 

I had a few goals that I wanted to achieve with this build:

* **Travel Friendly** - has to look as close to a regular longboard as it can as to **attract the least attention** at airports. Battery must also be **modular** and **under 99wh**
* **As low as it can go** - double drop for high speed stability

To achieve the first goal, I had to go the hub motor + integrated deck route. No motors sticking out + the least amount of visible cables + integrated deck = looks like a (thicc) longboard to me! For the battery, I utilized @Winfly's excellent hardware compression packs. With his packs, I was able to break down a 12s4p into 6 modules of 2s4p battery packs, each being just 88wh.

![20181127_011637|666x500](upload://fISpxM8TKvPGuqFy7IhgOrP412I.jpeg) 

To make it modular, I soldered some XT30 connectors to the ends of each module.

![20181130_144042|375x500](upload://mEqKSZZDt8UN5eGBBbNIvjUGAhA.jpeg) 

I chose this connector because it's small enough that it doesn't eat up that much space and each pin supports 30 amps, for a total of 60.

![20181130_144203|666x500](upload://8osoBNcxsIZqCgRZnHU6wyBZbUh.jpeg) 

To make balance leads modular, I soldered some 2 pin jst plugs to the braid, one in the middle and one on the positive end.

![20181130_162636|374x500](upload://sItTiET5jLQy2R6x4lxefTyE7KG.jpeg)
![20181130_170431|666x500](upload://uk9RmSv4Wy6cDMZF4Xt6Pr6HSZR.jpeg) 

Adding in some insulation.

 ![20181205_193710|666x500](upload://7OMvk2PVKrkTyrk0RuCXijpm2Sx.jpeg) 

Test fitting onto the hummie deck.

![20181205_195254|375x500](upload://sXAdgrXcBl3FUtyIWSCDcZcQ0bX.jpeg) 

To mount the enclosure, I used some white tape to mark where I would drill holes onto the enclosure.

![20190116_203414|690x451](upload://3ydBWZKWUH36QIqZx8x9XlXmKiO.jpeg) 

To make sure I get even spacing between the screws, I folded a strip of plastic into three equal parts and used that as a guide on where to mark.

![20190116_203447|666x500](upload://5jk8cq0BEkTiZxdkX5iNAe8c009.jpeg) ![20190116_203530|690x413](upload://eNvbYAzMR1bJvh9eIRVHEJiotO1.jpeg) ![20190116_203456|666x500](upload://b0MwH9xrs2nYnGNA2xitwBv7M0e.jpeg) 

I did have to make some modifications to the deck with my router. First, the unity doesn't fit:

![20190118_204055|666x500](upload://4TEcUo2GUVN8zgyxuTCmkXau2uc.jpeg) 

I had to route an inch or so to fit it.

![20190128_181934|375x500](upload://2khju600pybzV3sd3Bp2Crloc0R.jpeg) 

![20190129_105016|375x500](upload://cgEq6qXu0HF1Z6SF2tQxD36FeZz.jpeg) 

Next, I had to route some wheel wells to deal with the wheel bite.

![20190129_104508|666x500](upload://fo0wBRZ1kkOXkkOvmwebpU9Qi7c.jpeg) 

Lastly I routed the top of the deck so the baseplate "blends in" onto the deck.

![20190129_131805|666x500](upload://qSyc9RdMAzM62IbMLWp0ey9WHHY.jpeg)
![20190129_131831|666x500](upload://gXhDI1b1Gv5hOzmTFpRZ2OdsjYY.jpeg)
![20190129_151615|666x500](upload://oaKPlWT4BBKMw61bLVkdNw3yeNw.jpeg)

A few more details with the electronics that I'd like to highlight:

Motor cable extensions

![20190131_004409|562x500](upload://iSoWWSIF2MRf37td8MBZ7C9PCaE.jpeg) 

Foam strips for anti vibration

Just be careful with the motor connectors not being completely isolated, one touch when everything is vibrating and bye Unity

I've already flown to the Philippines with them. I had to disassemble them into individual cells though since it was an international flight, aka they're more strict. I've had a few moments when they'd ask me what this "giant block of metal" was but when I opened it up to show them that they were individually boxed "AA batteries" they were like "OK cool"

Sick build! So sleek and stealthy. That battery pack is awesome. Now I want to see a video of you jumping over a Boosted board or three. Or a Boosted, Evolve, Meepo...Basically all the "competition" (yeah, right) that this board can fit under.

One question though, if you wanted it as low as possible, why Raptor hubs and not Hummie hubs?

Depends on the airline still. Korean Air, which I flew when I went to the Philippines allows 5 spare batteries, but that's in addition to "in equipment" ones where it's installed inside what they're supposed to power. I could theoretically make some "lights", pass it of as photography equipment and say that my battery packs are used to power those. Have 5 spares and one installed inside the lights.

Also that's why when I flew with this battery pack I opted to break pack down further into individual cells then reassemble the modules at my destination. That's the beauty of these cell holders, you can unscrew everything and completely disassemble them.

Soldering all the connectors for modularity is a really nice execution, I would also like to see how the battery was assembled in a different thread.
Getting this low to the ground with 90mm wheels is awsome.

Not long enough. I‚Äôm still waiting on extensions to be shipped, but running unsensored isn‚Äôt actually that bad. With the amount of free roll the R-Spec drive has plus with how low you are to the ground, it‚Äôs actually incredibly fun to kick push this around.

I still can't believe that the airline let you in with 48 "AA" cells. Most international flights have limits to amount of individual cells you can carry.

I've been considering making a modular lipo pack where I can buy some cells where I'm travelling and just plug them and and ship them home on the way back.

It depends from where you are flying. I am professional photographer and carry up to five cameras on my trips with at least two spare batteries for each camera, on some airports they just let you through on other ones I have to get special permission by the airline and airport personnel to carry more then 5 batteries. Korea is a nightmare for instance, it takes up to one hour and a lot of talk that they let me go.

Agreed. I went through Incheon airport for a transit flight and got held up for about 15-20 mins cause I was carrying my Standard Range boosted battery. They didn't say anything to me though, they eventually let me go after talking to someone on the phone.

Only transit might be easier and having the battery in one piece might help too, they count my powerbanks as one piece only but tried to read the capacity of them. Last winter they held me for one hour and just because I had to board they speeded up the process. This year it took them only 20 min. but they and I have to sign a document each time.

![20190202_150714|666x500](upload://6f7fmyC6MCpQoMwiBUqhqiE5ZZ.jpeg)

![20190202_150559|666x500](upload://juCDvZlMfmHvPG9evR0pFYTetkN.jpeg)

For now it's taped up on the side, which works, but I'd like to put it somewhere in between the baseplate, maybe have a 3D printed part that fits in the gap or something. Plus I have to extend the cables.

The lights are white on standby and progressively turn green or red depending on my remote throttle. 

I did it by first splitting the receiver output between the unity and an Arduino. 

![20190204_222240|500x500](upload://jL2Xf4o5VUwLJ5aBw2icaPK6Jsu.jpeg)

Then by reading the receiver signal, I control the LED's with the Arduino.

Check the isolation of those bullet connectors. Use some larger heatshrink to make a isolating ‚Äûcondom‚Äú. That way vibrations wont cause a short and sudden braking. I would always recoomend some mr60 or mt60 connector, but well, enertion and their warranty policy

I've insulated the exposed parts of the phase wires. Thanks to everyone and their mother for pointing it out üòÇ

Rode this to the office and, well...

Yikes. 33wh/mi which is almost as much as my pneumatic build with 7in tires, 170kv and 1:3 gearing. That means I'll probably get 15-18 miles out of my 532.8wh 12s4p pack, maybe less if I go uphill. 

Here‚Äôs the trip back:

https://metr.at/r/OxSmr

![image|281x500](upload://9B3zQXpLIw9Rz7Cson8eXeNtpL6.png)

The average consumption rose to 38Wh/mi after running 10.6 mi with San Francisco hills. I was actually hitting the soft cutout during the last 1.5mi of my ride. Honestly, though it's so nice and low (and quiet!) I don't mind it. I had a lot of fun riding it since it had that much torque and was just a delight to push around. Maybe if I lower the motor amps to 50 I might get more range. That or kickpush more often. Then again, I do have a 6amp charger so it charges quickly.

Will post a video soon.

I wondered about that for a while too, until I realized that I was running unsensored :joy:

Still waiting on these to arrive so I can run sensored:

Damn, that consumption 

I really don‚Äôt get why these hubs do this. Well, I get it, we see they getting ridiculously hot, I can only guess that the magnetic design is done without much care or by someone that hasn‚Äôt got a lot of insight on it, so a lot of the energy is just being wasted as heat in the coils or even the stator is saturating really bad

@neiru37 do you know the phase resistance is? I don‚Äôt know if the unity app shows it like VESC tool

Thanks

I think that's the main culprit, it's higher than in my small 5055's motors, taking your average motor current (30A one motor) we have 40 W average heating (not really since we would have to do a square mean since power is proportional to the square of current) and 162W peak heating per motor, that's just ohmic losses, considering they are isolated by the wheel it only gets worse

It's important to know that I don't know if the resistance is single phase or all three phases, could be more losses

Looking forward to see what temps you are getting

@Hummie how low did you manage to get the resistance in your motors?

So to prepare the batteries for the flight, I first taped the terminals 

![20190209_033510|666x500](upload://9s3edHIop6W4RdL8NKMq4gNy02P.jpeg)

Secured the dangling braid in place 

![20190209_033641|666x500](upload://i7tIP9tIRrI9pi0FQrDCMZCUII6.jpeg)

Wrapped in a bubble wrap envelope (I repurposed some amazon bubble envelopes I had lying around)

![20190209_033722|666x500](upload://fNNNPe5eSckIIp2RWNzNwK4qsi4.jpeg)

And rolled it to make a battery burrito 

![20190209_033851|666x500](upload://oFKLM74skauUDDHRKm4FtpWxJUV.jpeg)

Prepped the others

![20190209_140319|666x500](upload://hSuiFS2exnbZqbPvTmexJwR75CR.jpeg)

I replaced the first one I wrapped with a white amazon bubble envelope for consistency lol

![20190209_141442|666x500](upload://8w2Br9wT9YfnEg1H6SwIUcmScNQ.jpeg)

For the last one, I decided to disassemble the pack into individual cells so I can get under the "5 spare batteries" rule that my airline has. I put it in a box with my flashlight to make it look harmless.

![20190209_141015|666x500](upload://6p37Crs70l0R2b2LhbYkyDXeuhP.jpeg) 

Also wrapped my board for protection. For this trip I decided to swap out the R-Spec drive with a pneumatic Drivetrain cause my hometown has really shitty roads. 

![20190209_165139|374x500](upload://qrFZlqgjxy5ljLmnpMnDIZiH4Qm.jpeg) 

Successfully made it past the first airport's security. Two more to go.

Took her out for a spin today and did a solid 33mph for 20 seconds, maxing out at 95% duty cycle.

![20190323_165525|265x500](upload://59csFtyieet5UPB7vxdcqNWxVUV.jpeg) 

Look at those motor temps climb though. Definitely felt that torque loss due to thermal throttling at the end of this run.

I‚Äôm curious, given your experience, how do you think that something like the Torque boards direct drive will fare given the clearance (assusming theyre mounted bottom mount but flush with the deck as you did yours)

I think it'll fit. If you remove the thane on the raptor hubs, you're left with the 6374 sized hub motor which is the same size as the TB motors if I'm not mistaken. I think that's enough clearance especially if you route the top to make the baseplate flush.

Hello I'm back to doing random shit with this board. 

First I swapped the rspec drive with a regular dual 6355 drive with a 15:36 ratio cause I had some motors and popocas lying around. Just bought dickyho mounts and 3d printed wheel pulleys cause I'm cheap. Since the Popoca's are 90mm the board is still a pretty low rider.

![20190501_003915|690x388](upload://jJ7xqauwBboMuEYXxLaQ5PvRBBd.jpeg) 

Gives me about 29mph max, less than the 33-ish I can do with the rspec drive but at least I don't overheat when I climb hills (unverified until I do a group ride) and I also consume less energy (never got above 27wh/mi with aggressive 30a batt 70a per motor settings). 

I also modified dickyho's pulley cover to make my board stand up on its own.

![20190510_214105|690x388](upload://opEmCPGsS4Ylgec1CY7rcbzHaQP.jpeg)
