Hello everyone !

I need a little help to finalize my build. 
This morning I recieved all the last parts I needed and I built my mono drive. 
I've plugged everything in but I never powered anything with the battery to be safe.
I plugged the reciever on Channel 2 is it ok ? 

So i've read all the threads about VESC but I still don't know wich values to set up. 
Could you please give me all the set up since it's all enertion parts someone should have a nice working BLDC set up ? 
Thanks for the help :slight_smile:

Just FYI the VESC needs a power supply in order for you to turn it on and enter the settings through BLDC Tool.
