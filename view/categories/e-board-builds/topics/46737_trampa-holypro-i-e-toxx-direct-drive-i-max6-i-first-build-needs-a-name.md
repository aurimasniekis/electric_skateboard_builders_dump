Hey everyone, Im some what new to the group but I have been planning and researching my first build for about 6 months now. I just finished up my build tonight. It took about a month to get all the parts, so I was building as they came in. I want to give a big thank you to @Nowind for the beautiful direct drives, and all the help with questions I had. Heres a build list of what I used.

Holypro 17ply deck
E-toxx Direct Drive/Max6 mount
Max6 ESC and SK3 190kv motors
8s lipo. x4  4s 4500mah 35c for 9ah, then I have x4 4s 6200mah 40c but will have to run only 2 of those at a time because I can't fit all 4 in my battery box
Battery box is a water proof gopro case with a battery meter and xt90 loop key I mounted on.
GT2b Mad munkey controller 

I think thats about it on the parts. If you have any questions or suggestions please let me know. Im new to electric boards...so honestly Im a bit nervous about getting on this thing lol. Guess ill take it slow in a big grassy field!

So clean looking, nice solution and mod for the battery box :clap:, thinking of a name for you and your beast... maybe Panther or Wakanda because of the black and silver theme.
