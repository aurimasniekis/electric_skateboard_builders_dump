Hi, everyone, I am trying to design a gear drive gearbox.
This one can work for caliber trucks 180mm with 50XX or 63xx motors (8mm shaft) and ABEC11 83mm wheels.
I use a 1:2  Spiral Bevel Gears (Now using nylon, pom or aluminum will be used in the future.)
Everything goes smoothly it will sell 200 USD for one
Now I am waiting for my new gear (the picture is 3D printed)
Finally, I am sorry that my English is very bad.

How do you mount / fix the gearbox to the trucks? As it looks now the gear is not in center of truck axle

The gear needs to be with the wheel lock, it will be on the same axis as the wheel

I use an aluminum ring to fix the gearbox on the truck.

Yes of course. It just seems very hard to get gearbox, mount aligned correctly with casted trucks.

I think there is still some resistance. Do not know whether the V-Ring causes resistance.

These are very interesting, but I’m not sure what the advantage is over the existing drivetrains. If you can build a gearbox that drives both wheels with one motor, you would have a TON of demand.

## \#25 Posted by: wafflejock Posted at: 2018-08-27T16:48:15.723Z Reads: 482

Could see a few advantages.

1. If the gear is stronger than a belt you don't have to worry about the belt breaking (now would be worries about gear teeth but depending on materials/lubrication/alignment this might not be an issue).
2. Fully enclosed drivetrain means no chance for getting rocks into the belt, you could argue a covered belt drive would also have this advantage but I don't see many of those.
3. No belt tensioning issues this would likely be a rigid system

That said I would like to hear the OP in terms of reasons behind the design or what they see as the major advantages or any disadvantages compared with a more traditional belt driven drive train.

You can also fit dual 6374 or 6380 on Calibers with this drive system!

```
The advantages of the gearbox are like what @wafflejock  said, no need to worry about the belt.
But the advantages of traditional belt drive systems are more. It is cheaper and lighter than gearboxes.
Because I just want to install the dual 6374 motor on Calibers, so I designed this gearbox.
Although I can solve this problem by just replacing the Calibers, I think there are more ways to install the motor for everyone to choose.
I hope that gearbox can create more cool skateboards through your creativity.

I disagree. Safety first. Debris gets stuck in belts and can lock the wheels. I'd prefer not to street my face. Belts are fine, but gears are safer. In more ways than I just described, just one example.

Yes and cause the motors are so low and pointing forward. I guess you could point them out the backwhich might cool. Like spinning dual tailpipes.

I changed the material of the gear
I started to use 3D printing gears and there is a lot of noise.
Change, although there is noise reduction, the noise of the thrust bearing becomes more obvious

Of course you can easily change direction. You only need to change the mounting direction of the aluminum ring.

I imagine there is some flex with the wheel/motor/mount etc that would make skipping pretty inevitable, i feel like youd frequently lose optimal contact between the pulleys  when going over bumps or when breaking/accelerating

Brake tests are only meaningful under load - without the mass of a rider that needs to be slowed down the observation will not reflect what's going on in real life. What I meant to ask was if you could FEEL some teeth skipping (like one can with a belt driven system).

you can fit two motors traditionally, so what's the difference?  OK, you can maybe fit 2 larger motors but doesn't really seem worth the trouble to me.

I mean, I'm all for innovation, but I think what WOULD make this attractive is if you could fit the motor front mount on the rear truck and rear mount on the front truck so you essentially have 4 wheel drive with 2 motors and 2 ESC's, but unless there's a way to make the motors fit under the deck in a sideways stance (as they do now) then you lose a massive amount of wheel base that would normally be used for batteries and electronics.

I didn't say "IMHO…unlikely" just because I wanted to type, I actually thought about it...

That's exactly what I was thinking. I'm pretty sure this would give less torque than dual 6355, and harder to maintain. It's definitely a great idea, and I love the aesthetic, but I don't think this will be as good as everyone hopes. I really hope I'm wrong through!

It’s easy to make a powerful board, but it’s hard to make a powerful board that’s lightweight and efficient. One motor driving both wheels on the same axle certainly doesn’t solve all the weight and efficiency issues, but it would be a step in the right direction.

i doubt that the loads that the RC airplanes are anywhere near the load of driving a human.

RC planes are basically carrying its own weight and the wind resistance, whereas we are now using the motors for powering a motor to drive a human (which is easily multiple times the weight of the aircraft)

The braking problem is different. It never was the gears that broke or stripped, it was the motor mount flexing/breaking under the torsion that occured when braking. Nylon handles that better than PETG but i want to try Polycarbonate at some point.

But the propeller is solely putting coaxial force on the bearing while with a bevel gear only part of the load is coaxial.
That should easily outweigh the difference in moved weight. 
But I fear that we both only assume and without actual numbers this discussion is meaningless. If you have some force number we can compare let me know.

this is something i also want to do one day. i mean this type of drive must be quite efficient right? there is no possible problem with CAN or Split PPM, you just need one VESC ergo more space in the enclosure or a smaller enclosure, more even torque. Also i think since each motor wastes space for sensors ect, the effective amount of copper/iron must be higher even if the volume of the can is smaller compared to 2 motors of the same volume.

I know that was a discussion in a different thread.
And I think someone on here randomly brought it up.
But the original poster and designer of the drive has been shooting for dual drive from the start.
One of the main things that's trying to be accomplished with this setup, is being able to run 6374 or larger Motors without having a 218 hanger.

May I ask you for the link where you bought these nice "headless" bolts?

hi,  so is anyone looking to set up a drive to run a single axle on both wheels,  like a vehicle axle,  its a completely new truck design but ultimately it would be more streamlined,  waterproof and in terms of building a board would simplify the whole process

[/quote]

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/search

This has been covered again and again, please search

Good luck getting something like that to be completely waterproof, thats going to be quite a few gaskets/sealing rings or whatever theyre called. 

If youre already making this, good luck, and if you havnt started yet, build off of what those previous to you learned

Before the release, I will first create a Google form to investigate the willingness to purchase
BTW, I made some updates to the gearbox housing.

1x Steel 40T Spiral Bevel Gears (wheel)
1x Steel 20T Spiral Bevel Gears (motor)
1x VA-45 V-Ring
