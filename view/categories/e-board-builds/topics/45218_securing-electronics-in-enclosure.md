I haven't seen a dedicated thread to this so I thought I would create a new topic.

How you guys secure the electronics inside the enclosure? One of my biggest challenges is not only trying to fit everything snug inside my box but also figuring out a way to make it so the battery pack doesn't just slide and crush the vesc and anti-spark switch. My new build is going to have a switch bulging 3cm into the enclosure and I am afraid the battery is going to roll back and bend the switch. The battery has only a 3cm margin from the side of the enclosure. The enclosure is also made of stainless steel which makes it hard to do modifications.

Here's is a picture of my plan:

Hi, I think if you decide to look a little harder you will find anything on this forum and people just get lazy. There are plenty of threads on that

is there a way to do it without having to secure the components under the deck? I was thinking more of using plastic scaffolds and holders to piece the components in place. Is that highly discouraged?

I mounted on the back of battery enclosure once, 4 holes, 2 pieces of EPP foam, 2 zipties and lots of luck, this setup still worked after hundreds of miles and stays cool..

Enclosure and electronics pics please.

Your esc, bms, and cells are just laying on the enclosure, bouncing up and down and sliding back and forth...on metal?

Its hard to believe that you are ok with this plan.

Well I am not ok, and that's why I am here. I don't have the enclosure yet. So you guys just use really strong velcro to stick the battery in place? On my previous builds, I bent copper panels to the right size and just squeezed it between the battery and controller. Is that really bad?

Velcro (industrial strength) or the grey double sided tape, for your components, and you should be golden.

I packed my batteries in with some extra foam that I had after sealing my enclosures, and then my vescs are hot-glued to the rear enclosure with my receiver and stuff

I had the exact same problem on my board! My enclosure ended up being just so full to the brim with wires and stuff that it held everything together pretty well, but I would recommend some doubled sided tape or Velcro to make sure it doesn't move around.
