Here it is y'all! My very first build! I've been interested in building an esk8 for quite some time now and finally I found the time. 

I wanted something with top speed (few hills in my area), reliability, and clean and simple.

I decided to fabricate my own motor mount from 6061 alluminum and attached it to an existing sector 9 32" cruiser truck I already had. I used 18:36T gearing and 83mm wheels so this animal flys!  Custom abs plastic electronics case which will soon be sealed with silicone for a water tight enclosure.

Here's my list of parts
Sk3 6364 190kv
1:2 custom drive ratio
15mm gates belt
4s Multistar 16ah batteries in series
VESC
Quantum pistol grip transmitter and receiver. works great! 
simple cell voltage alarms which weren't yet hooked up in the photo. 

Let me know what you think!

Thanks a lot! Next I will build a compact travel board... stay tuned.

 I just used pieces of velcro to keep it simple so I can still access the balance wires for charging
