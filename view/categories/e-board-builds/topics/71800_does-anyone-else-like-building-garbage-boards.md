I can't stand spending time on something that I want to be riding/driving. I have zero f@%ks to give when it comes to making things look good.. If its cheap quick to get going and does the business and all about it.
I'd much rather be riding it than building it. I'd rather make something that suits me than have it look good.
I want to see if others share the same way of thinking.

Send forth your ugly build pics and let us know what you like about it.

The caveat for this is that when I am being paid to work on something I definitely strive for excellence. But this fun shed time....who cares?

I've got to say I am the complete opposite of this.  If something is not right and I mean a teeny tiny bit wrong I can't sleep until its fixed.  Saying that though I do cut massive corners to prove a concept and have been flying down the road with bits of duct tape and roof rack straps holding things together.  The finished product though....

Lol, mine has never been called the most beautiful, but to me it's a work of art. On the topic of building vs riding though, I truly love building. 

My next build might even have an enclosure, but we'll see how I'm feeling when the time comes

Broke my elbow 2 weeks ago on a dodge like this one with the tree trunk. Now I'm banned from my board for a few weeks even though the weather is so great for the time of the year :sob:

Over all some damage on the boards is fine, hell fixing and building is fun by itself, too. But injuring yourself and be basically stuck on the couch sucks.

have a good recovery, get up to speed and start again. That's the only way to progress and failure is   often one option. It's not how hard you fail but how hard you're back and shred even harder.

At the moment I consider mine a bit thrown together, although not everyone will agree. There‚Äôs so much to do battery enclosure and wiring wise to clean it up, but not of utmost importance right now.

I wouldn't say they're unsafe. No more so than anything else. DIY board is never going to snap. And vesc is generic motors are good quality connections done right etc. Sometimes I even check the tyre pressure.

That‚Äôs the first thread where I feel like my board fits. I used to have a Tupperware ‚Äúenclosure‚Äù and now I am using plywood box screwed to the deck not sure if it‚Äôs an upgrade but it works fine. I put it together in a hurry and because it is holding fine without issues so far I have not changed it since. I will probably do a cleaner build for the next one, I have almost everything to make a vacuum formed enclosure, I just haven‚Äôt found a large enough oven on the sidewalk yet.

[/quote]

Ha ha.  Yeah, of course I still have the Lance Mountain too ;-) That one doesn't fit in this thread, though

That's an old [Target skateboard](https://www.target.com/p/maple-masters-31-skateboard-digital-yellow/-/A-52634198) that was like <$20 and originally had plastic trucks.  Yes, plastic trucks.

The top photo is that board at work in my office, and the bottom photo is that board after I completed it.  (If you call that complete)  It's not even waterproof in the slightest amount.

It's a 10S lipo with BMS

I have an aluminum popsicle stick board I might do something like this for my boys once they‚Äôre a bit older.

Upgraded to a dual flipsky and Added a headlight to my ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù‚Äù build.  Now it tops out over 30 mph and has the option to cruise at night. Thank goodness for Gorilla tape!!!. ![image|375x500](upload://hdUNYLDIDgsh4xVgc138mnDrMgX.jpeg)

10s5p. Some 97mm koowheel hub motors. The headlight is actually a frys portable floodlight that has a rechargeable li-ion battery. Took it apart and hot glued all the connectors and stuffed it with foam, epoxyed yoga foam pads between several parts of the foodlight and clamped it all together with gorrilla tape... epoxyed it to some L hinges and got those going through the hardware. I also knew there would be space between the board and light so i made sure to add a lot of yoga mats to act as a brace and double as shock absorption before i ductaped and screwed it on. It works amazing. Road rough terrain just to make sure i didnt have that pesky flickering from vibrations. I dampened the hell outta that lol. Got the same brackets for the rear reflector to make sure the board is mostly legal (going over 20 mph makes it technically illegal)

Well done. That rocks. That spongy foam is good idea for dampening. I go through heaps of gorrila tape. I got the tip to put strips of tape on your helmet and tear it off when required.
