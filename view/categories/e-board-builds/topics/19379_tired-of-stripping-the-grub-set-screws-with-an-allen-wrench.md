My grub set screws recently got stripped using an allen wrench so I decided to change the use of the tiny grub set screws and replaced them with bolts and it actually works better. Its much easier to tighten and loosen them, they were easy to find at Lowes and Home Depot in the metric screws area, so happy I did this. I also changed the allen wrench bolts that go with my wheel pulley to bolts that use a phillips screw driver. Hope this thread can help someone that has the same issue that I had.

I suggest you invest in a quality set of drivers... Most of the time stripping (specially in hex) occurs due to using the wrong tool, a cheap tool or using the tool wrong. 

I used to strip screws constantly until I decided that I had to invest in a quality set. Haven't stripped a hex since, not even cheap screw heads, as long as I make sure my driver goes all the way into the head. 

You can also loctite everything so you don't have to keep tightening screws every few months

I've done the same with my motor bolts. Home depot ones have a nice deep allen and don't strip at all. If anything your tool will strip lol.

I have these,
https://www.amazon.com/Bondhus-69600-Double-L-Wrench-ColorGuard/dp/B00FBFI6T6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491837021&sr=8-1&keywords=hex+key+set+color

and these
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0069FFU7I?psc=1

not terribly expensive and I love the color coding. It helps me identify my hex keys if someone else is using them
