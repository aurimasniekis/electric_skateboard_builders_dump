I've recently completed my very first build, and thought it only fair to post a build thread on the forum that was such a useful resource to me for learning about this exciting hobby/sport/lifestyle/religion?

It all started when I was given a beautiful longboard deck at a manufacturing tradeshow called IMTS in Chicago last year (2018.) It was manufactured from a solid piece of aluminium plate, on a Datron CNC machine. There is a pattern machined into the top surface, instead of grip tape. The guys at the booth told me they'd give it to me, if I'd post some pictures of it on Instagram when I got back to where I live in New Zealand. Of course I agreed, and on the spur of the moment, told them I'd turn it into an electric longboard, which they were very interested to hear. At that stage, I knew nothing about the ESK8 community and had never ridden an electric board. It was time to get googling!

Here's the starting moment of the project:
![DECK|375x500](upload://sq8La1kH3HwFBKMwlgIpj1LObse.jpeg) 
![DECK2|375x500](upload://nUQoKVYy7FTo2pumEZi0mwiAzIW.jpeg) 

I looked around for trucks, and read some threads in this community. Decided to use either Paris or Caliber trucks, and I could get Paris locally easily, so I went with them. I thought they looked nice on the board, and thought the round section of the hanger would be handy for mounting the motor. 
![Trucks|666x500](upload://nlNi390yxArBMEInIgu4op76uK9.jpeg) 

Wheels were a tough decision. I looked at all sorts of options, and decided the Evolve street kit would be a great way to get wheels, pulleys and belts all in one go. While they look like a really nice product, when I received them and started to plan the fitting, I realised they would take up too much width on my trucks, so I sent them back. Luckily, the shop I got them from was very helpful and refunded my money happily. 
![EvolveKit|375x500](upload://3diHoesaNp5DIQQcXySfkTGvdjJ.jpeg) 

I then discovered [https://buildkitboards.com/](https://buildkitboards.com/) and I was like a kid in a candy store. I got some of their 97mm black wheels, with their interchangeable pulley setup, as well as a bunch of other stuff which you'll see further down.

The wheels looked really awesome on the board, and with just a little bit of turning on the lathe, I was able to modify the rear truck to get a hobbyking motor mount sitting nicely.

Yep. Totally flat. Has a surprising amount of flex, about 10mm in the center when I'm standing on it. I weight 60kg.

I'm not as concerned with turning or slipping more on the weight and flex and also if is something hit the board it will probably short out.  With aluminum I feel like with flexing over rough surfaces it will eventually bend and become a permanent bend in the material

I haven't ridden lots of boards, but the turning feels great to me. Initially I thought the turning radius would suck and considered dual kingpin trucks, but I'm actually really happy with it as it is.

I was thinking of mounting all of the electronics directly to the underside of the deck, then putting a cover over, for exactly this reason, but got scared of possible shorts, so made a full enclosure out of bamboo. Will post pics of finished board soon.

No grip tape. The guys that machined it cut a pattern into the surface with a v-shaped tool, in a series of overlapping arcs. It leaves a pattern that has thousands of sharp points that act like grip tape.

I was very surprised with how light it is. I was expecting it to be very heavy, but had nothing to compare it to. I picked up an Evolve in a shop and couldn't believe how heavy they were. 

It might not be clear from the photos, but the bottom of the board has hundreds of little machined hexagonal pockets which reduce the weight. It's still strong because of the depth of section of the interconnecting webs.

10S5P pack. The 5P is more significant going up hills.

Max speed 26km/h on 83mm wheels, 30km/h on 97mm wheels. Not that keen to go fast. DIY remote so it can be potentially flakey at times.

Bought some used cells from [http://hipstar.co.nz](http://hipstar.co.nz) 
Tielman was super helpful, answered my questions and gave me all the info I needed. They're Sony VTC4 cells, which he recommended because even though they have a fairly low capacity (2000mAh) compared to some others, they're good for 30A continuous draw. Good charge specs too. He sent info in a spreadsheet, with all the cells tested capacities and internal resistances.

This was when I was balancing the groups. I did it in excel and got all the 3P groups really close in capacity (within <8 mAh)

5P would be nice! I only get 20km range. Would love to be able to go a bit further. It does 42kmh/hr max. I'm using the remote from buildkitboards. It was something like US $30 including receiver. Works great.

5P is heavy... esp when you have to get a 4 year old _and_ your board on a backpack onto a bus.

I have a couple of RF remotes (like your BKB remote) but I'm mostly in the game for making the electronic gadgets.

Mocking up the battery. I downloaded this series of cell-holder models from thingiverse: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2526936](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2526936)
I modified one of them to support 15 cells, using Autodesk Fusion 360.
I then printed 4 of them on the Markforged X7 at the company I work for, CADPRO Systems.
They fitted up really nicely.

I then got to work building a DIY spot welder with some electrodes I turned on my father's lathe, as well as some 3D printed components, a motorbike starter solenoid and a car battery. It worked, but the welds were slightly too inconsistent for my liking and I ran scared.

So I ended up buying this on Aliexpress:
![newwelder|374x500](upload://gHiqG7UKVZyA1wKwhQc749DiA8Q.jpeg) 

The welds were really good, and consistent, so I started assembling the pack. I used a dremel to clean up the ends of the cells, as they had a few remnants of the tabs that were torn off them.

![tabs|374x500](upload://ttpkVlJ0e8AgOlhmQi2TnGfEzyQ.jpeg) 

I added some tabs for the balance leads.
![balance|690x497](upload://mLgNpF7h7gr0bTlwlqDrrTmNVUG.jpeg) 

I then mocked up the layout of the electronics, and wrapped the pack.
![electronics|374x500](upload://jGfWBOmR0wJ0fMKdFvliRVtyQGi.jpeg) 

I ended up cutting the heatshrink off, and redoing it with the BMS integrated. I left  little flap in the heatshrink on the back of the bms so I can get the multimeter probes in if I ever need to check the individual cell voltages. I also glued in a 1-wire temperature sensor in case I want realtime battery temp monitoring one day. The wires are not hooked up at the moment, but they're accessible if I need them.

![withbms|374x500](upload://4bDJNhVPZbSuIKAS9LS81NyvLvf.jpeg) 
I was super happy with how the pack turned out.

I was going to make the enclosure out of aluminium, but forgot to order the material before the Christmas holiday.
In desperation to get riding, I decided to make one out of bamboo, and it's turned out so nice I think I'll stick with it, if it lasts.
I used my Vertigo M2 CNC router to machine the components. You can see Vertigo's page here: [https://vertigotech.co.nz/](https://vertigotech.co.nz/)

![enclosure%201|374x500](upload://dPgvmblCt6BlWlm4d7v7YDfcj1k.jpeg)

![finished2|500x500](upload://aDK6QZmHIgeIlgE6zYygvT101NQ.jpeg) 

I was worried about the stiffness of the enclosure making the deck rigid, as I wanted a bit of flex.
I designed the base of the enclosure to mount to the deck with 2 screws in the center. To give the ends some support, I added screws there too, but I made extra deep counterbores in the bamboo and put springs under the screwheads. This means that as the deck flexes, only the center of the enclosure stays against the deck, and a gap opens up at the ends of the enclosure, as the springs compress. So the enclosure stays flat, but the deck bends. Works great! I was then worried that the screws would work themselves loose.... and then I realised that they won't be able too, because the lid of the enclosure will prevent them from doing so.
