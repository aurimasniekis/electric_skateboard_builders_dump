If there is a Darth Vapor why not a Darth Maul?

Final board.

Slowly working on it, but this week I'll receive the last part I've been waiting for the antispark switch from @goldenHusky and hope to finish it by the weekend.

As you have the wider calibers, Why would you Go dual criss cross? There should be enoght space for both 6374's on the same side of the truck.

I have extended the wheelbase not the track width, I mean I made addapters to fit the calibers further away between each other.

I'm going to mount both motors on the reverse position for symmetry

This is the first time I ride FOC withn no issues, the board extremely silent and a real acceleration beast, I reach top speed real fast, there is definitely less final speed than BLDC mode but the smoothness of launching from dead stops and cruising is definitely rewarding.

This has become my favorite e-board by far, it's like ruding a brand new car with sexy looks, I'm in love again :heart_eyes:

My VESC settings are:

Motor Max 80A
Motor Min -65A
Battery Max 40A
Battery Min -20A

I still need to dial in the braking at low speeds, it lock the brakes before it reaches dead stops.

@torqueboards The trucks are amazing
@kaly the motors are beasts and are working flawlessly
@okp thanks for the inspiration
@tueboard Update the build with these final pictures

Absolutely beautiful job Alan! 

I’d really like to know what specific measures this time you took for wiring the battery. Series connections are just 2 wires per? Trying to figure out how you got the iron in such a small gap to solder those haha. 

Huge thumbs up !

## \#37 Posted by: Eboosted Posted at: 2017-11-12T16:50:30.211Z Reads: 540

I guess you meant safety measures?

I used a cross flex wire pattern between packs to allow more flexiness removing the stress from the nickel strips, then I used 3M double sided tape between the enclosure and packs to avoid any movement, now it's easier to remove the enclosure as it comes together with the battery, electronics and VESC.  I also used used XT60s to connect the battery, VESCs and antispark switch, this way no spark could ignite the electronics at all.

You just pull the battery packs away and solder them, as it's flexible, you just squish them closer and you get a very flexible pack.

As far as I know the motor min has more effect on low speeds and battery min more effect on high speeds?  Could you try putting batt min back up to -25A and reducing motor min 10 amps add see  how it feels?

There is also the max ERPM to full brake, what happens is that at low speeds, even at 95% duty cycle, the motor current is lower than the brake current you request on the remote, so as you drop bellow the max EPRM to full brake, the VESC shorts all phases together and your wheels lock up, try decreasing it a bit and see what value the full brake is engaged without locking up

Beautiful build by the way, I can only imagine the time spent on that grip tape

Looks good but I would use fishpaper and individually wrap your 4p packs or do two long shrink wraps length wise rather than 5 width wise. The way you have it now, the middle cells can rup against other cells that are not in series and potentially cause a short/fire. 

Unless I am missing something in the photos. Build looks nice otherwise!

Well the performance is the same, the Trampa looked more galactic this one is more conventional but also lighter.

After switching the MBS wheels with Abec 11 107mm flywheels, I feel like riding over clouds. Amazing feeling but less torque. 

On high speeds its a blast!

I never tried that, I just did it for two reasons, increase wheel base to make it look cooler and allow the motors to be mounted on a reverse position without the need for such a long motor mount.

Sorry for all these individual replies I'm slowly making my way through this tread and I'm in awe :smiley:
My idea for the wrap was to do the edges, but do a part on the top of the deck also, and then put the grip tape over that so that the wrap would dissappear under the grip tape and hopefully hold better?
Do you think doing this would fix the peeling issue?

Did you just turn your rear trucks around for the extra clearance or is it a different baseplate?

Small update :sunglasses:

A guy that works on the company borrowed the Darth Maul from me to do nearby tasks, after a week riding it he couldn't let it go so he offered me some money, I accepted as I'm already building the Moonshine Sidekick and have too many boards.

As a last time upgrade and goodbye gesture, I made the rear cage, installed the rear lights and cleaned it a little bit.

Good bye Darth Maul you served me well and gave me too much fun!

It all depends on the formula used, the geometry of the wheel (shaper edges vs rounded edges) and the pavement roughness. We’ve got some serious bad pavement here in Sydney which could be a reason none of these wheels hold up for a long time. Beta testing of the 100 mm Boas have shown some promising results and I am looking forward getting those for my new board. It would be great to see some longtime runs of the green 107mm Abecs, whether it’s just an issue of the geometry or whether the formula is to blame.

Inspired by your build. Used some spare parts I had lying around like deck, wheels and battery. Made it so friends can ride along

![20180804_190116|690x388](upload://r4hD0nsU1xH0WqxGKZ8RhYEgEhV.jpg)

Did you do any sort of phase wire management to hold wires in place? What kind of bushings did you use?

Beautiful Tito! 
That is the fastest board I had. I sold it because I had too many boards at the moment and because I needed a light board for short commutes, but now I miss the acceleration, speed and stability. I was going to build the moonshine sidekick with a small battery as a second light board besides the spud but I think I'm going to fit a double stack enclosure to fit a 12s6p, I don't care if it will weight a lot, I realized fast boards are more fun.

I used riptide pivot cups and wfb bushings and it got a pretty nice turning radio and better stability at high speeds

Fast boards are definitely fun. My other board has 12s7p. Really heavy but nice having the range. Look forward to seeing your next build.

Oh yeah wfb, my favorite back when I had caliber IIs might give those another try. Thanks

Top speed = 50km/h 

10% duty = 5km/h

50% = 25km/h 

And so on

I think that is what @Pedrodemio was meaning, if not correct me please

Exactly 

Things get interesting when you start to consider the current limits. Let’s say you have 30A battery max and 60A motor max and a top speed of 60km/h

This results in maximum torque up to 30km/h, then then torque has to drop to keep the battery current from going over 30A and you enter a stage of constant power

I’ve been working on a calculator that takes all of that in acount plus drag, rider weight, battery internal resistance and etc, just need a few more tweaks, the results are way more accurate than just assuming a efficiency of 80% or so and applying to the no load speed

I get the duty cycle I can program PWM and so on. I just don't get how you would push for example 100A from a 50A battery at 50% duty cycle. 

This mean I would pull for exampe during 10ms 100A then 10ms off and again 100A 10ms correct ? 
But if doing calculations this would still be the same as outputing 50A but constant. And pulling 100A might start to detriorate the battery even for 10ms or am I still looking to it from the wrong angle ?

I also understand about the maximum torque that you just explained, you mean for the complete acceleration cycle I wil be enjoying the fully motor torque but when going from 30KM to 60km because I limit the current to 30A the motor starts to lose torque as it gains speed.Only thing is that I still can't relate this to the above about  having the motor pulling double the battery current.


Is there a post or a webpage explaining this more in detail ? I want to really understand it as I am going to configure my 2 vescs maybe in 3-4 weeks as my parts start to arrive.

Not exactly, the battery won’t be subject to more than the limit, you can’t think of the motor as a resistor since it also has inductance 

The PWM will act as you said, some times on, some times off, but that happens at the switching frequency, 20 KHz by default, since the motor is also a inductor everything is smoothed out

What the PWM is modulate the voltage that is feed into the motor

The simplest way to understand is by conservation of power. Let’s say you are at 50% duty cycle and requiring the maximum current the motor can put out, 60A for example, also let’s say that the battery voltage is 30V, so at 50% duty cycle the motor is subject to 0.5*30 = 15 V, and the power is voltage*current = 15*60 = 900 W

Now to the battery, we need 900 W, at 30v that’s power/voltage = 900/30 = 30 A

So let's say the motor I have is 60A like you said.
If I have max speed of 30kmh I only get max torque until 15kmh since battery only 30A.

But I don't get it because if I use lower gears I should have much more torque or not? You mean torque directly at the motor? Or at the wheel? 

Basically if my battery is a limiting factor should I just program for speed for example for 120kmh then I would always have max torque until 60kmh. I think something I still don't totally get it.

If this is true then both configs (30kmh and 120kmh) should be both at max torque at 15kmh so what makes the difference here is the gears, at 15km with 30kmh max speed the wheels would have much more torque because of gears and at 120kmh much less because the gears would be small but both using the max. Motor torque correct?

So resuming if my battery has only half the current of my motor I will always be getting only the % of torque past a given % of speed. So even if I have a really big motor but low bat voltage I can only enjoy the big acceleration during a small percentage of the speed.  So now I am thinking, depending of the max bat current I have there is an optimal motor to be using or? Not always big is better.


And sorry for spamming the thread :smiley:

If you keep the current limit the same, the torque at the motor will be the same, if you increase your gear ratio, you will have more torque at the wheel but your top speed will be lower and the maximum speed for max torque will also be lower

 What dou you mean by program top speed? Top speed is determined by motor Kv, battery voltage, gear ratio and wheel diameter

If you you would gear a board for 120 Km/h and using the 60A motor limit and the 30A battery limit, indeed you would have max torque up to 60 km/h but this max torque would be way lower than if you geared for 30 km/h

Exactly, if you want full torque across all speeds you need the battery current be equal to the summed current of all motors

All depends on what you want, I run dual 5055 motors with 40 A each and 30A total battery current, I have full torque up to 17 km/h and for me it's ok

Amazing looking build! I wanted to ask some questions about the red paint job, because I'm tempted to do the same.
1. Does the grip-tape stick to the paint well? does the paint not tear off underneath under force?
2. Did you use any sort of primer, or just paint on the deck straight away?
3. Was it spray paint, or did you brush it on?
4. How many layers of paint?

Thank you in advance! ^_^

Hello, you need to use car paint primer then 2 layers of car paint and lastly matte clearcoat, it won't tear appart unless you scuff it badly.
