There will also be a V2 version of the front without the air bypass.

If you painted it all back and out some yellow LED lights in the airdam you could sell it to Christopher Nolen for a fortune ðŸ˜€

What's the purpose of the body kit? Aesthetics or does it actually as value such as less drag?

@chidi Does it produce downforce on the front splitter ? It looks like it could.

Yes the front wing is designed to give maximum downforce at low speeds since I'm sure no one really wants to be riding more than 50km/h to 60km/h its tuned to be optimal from 30km/h to 40km/h. Based on our [CFD model](https://www.simscale.com/workbench?publiclink=795e9aca-495c-465c-9948-bc82347212e7) we predict it should give you about 4kg of downforce at 40km/h.

@chidi21  So it is functional, great.I thought it was only for looks, should guard against mud spray from the wheels too, right?.You have to paint it all black, pun on a batman costume and ride around, that would be epic.

Yes the wheel wells do function as intended against little stones and some mud. I would recommend riding on smooth surfaces though.  Have in mind I am constantly trying to tweak the design but have not yet had a chance to measure the effects. Hoping I can get some people to give it a shot.

@chidi21 How did you mold the plastics, it looks very professional.I might have some ideas for the downforce which arent big but have noticeable effects.Depends on the limits of the molding abilities but the board could look so much crazier, lets say batshit crazy :smile:

I modeled it in Fusion and 3D printed the parts. If you own a 3D printer you can print out the parts too. Great way to make repairs if you crash :grinning:! There are so many materials and colors to pick from with 3D printing. You can also get the files printed using something like [3Dhubs.com](https://www.3dhubs.com/)
