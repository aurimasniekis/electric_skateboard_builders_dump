Hello all!
I have been working on restoring an original 1999 Exkate 42" electric skateboard.
This board has a top speed of 22MPH with its 400W Brushed DC motor.
Single belt drive using 2 8AH SLA batteries. Charge time is about 4-5hrs.
The remote is using a low frequency RF receiver to control the throttle and breaks.

The rebuild process....
The main electronic speed controller is fried and beyond repair.
Rebuild will be using a bi-directional dc motor driver.
Controlled by an arduino system to talk to the motor driver.
I might incorporate bluetooth for a new remote.. or rebuild the original remote to connect with a cable to the arduino. Similar to what E-Glide electric skateboards do.
Anyways here are some pictures of the board itself!

Sure!
From what I gathered online, ExKate had a patent on their torsion trucks.
The bushings make this board turn very sharp! For being how big it is.
