Yup.  

First tried a dremel with a metal cutter, sander.  Ironically the only thing that ended up working was an exacto knife and about an hour of elbow grease

Next time just use a file and spin the wheel on a motor, bench grinder, buffer, lathe... Lol :slight_smile:
Build looks good

Sometimes for rubber if you deep-freeze it first, it can then be machined.  I'm not sure if that also applies for polyurethane.

@Zac13
Sick build man! How much did the finished board weigh? Considering it was dual 6374â€™s, 12S4P, and 107 wheels.

A little over 30 lbs!   I use it to commute into work, and to fly around on, but would not want to carry it anywhere
