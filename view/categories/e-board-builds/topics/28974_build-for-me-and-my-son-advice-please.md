Hi, I'm new here.

i would like to try and build an electric longboard for my son and i for the summer holidays. we have two longboards that we mess about with at the park. i weigh 15 stone! and we want to keep our first build cheap..
so here are my questions-

am i too heavy?

are these boards ok for our project?

will the hobby king motor mount fit?

which hobby king motor would be best?

can we put bigger wheels on? will that make the board faster?

sorry for the newbie questions..

any links to wheels etc would be great

many thanks

Welcome - sounds like a fun project for you and your son.

Too heavy - no.  You'll want to gear down for better torque, and higher voltage helps (but be careful starting or mashing the power on - a good controller really helps).  15 Stone = 210lbs ish.  I'm 19 stone'ish and ride single motor w/o issue.

Existing decks ok?  - you'll want Caliber II 50 trucks for easiest move to esk8 (most motor mounts will work with these).  You'll also want to top mount the drop through deck - most mounts will not fit drop through.  

Motor mount - until a few experienced folks have hammered on the HK mount i'd avoid.  I would instead use DIYes mount, ADS v2, or some of the folks here have ones they've made and sold.  I recommend @korryh's mount highly.

I would go with a single 6374 for you - 149/168/192.  For your son any of the SK3's likely will work - 5065 or 6355 if you want.  I would figure out your speeds/gearing on esk8.it site and work backwards w/ voltage, gears, motor kv to get the top speed you are comfortable with.

Wheels - yes you will need bigger wheels.  More specifically you need wheels that have a Flywheel hub or Kegel hub in them to easily mount the wheel gear.  I would suggest the 83mm Flywheel clones for bang-for-buck.

FOr you i'd try to find the 15mm 40t wheel gear and 14/15t motor gear.  Son might want to go a bit faster and not need to gear down as much, so maybe the more common 36t 12mm w/ 15t motor gear.

Start reading and look for builds you want to copy.  Read read and read some more.

Welcome again and GL!

Almost no such thing...as @sl33pysaid said gear down... and ditto what Rob said 

Father son projects are excellent especially esk8 ...cause in the end...you become the Coolest Dad in his universe!

Hi, gonna do 1 board first to see how we get on..
Looking to spend about £200. I already have a lipo charger for my RC Heli and some 5000mah 6cell Lipos
Cheers

The rc heli could be a bad choice ... not sure if it has brakes ... might wanna just get a simple 6s car esc....that will give breaks = safety


Edit: read that wrong ...you have a charger for your heli  ..my mistake

83mm flywheel clones:

Caliber II 50s:

Look around for car ESCs. Keep in mind that esk8 builds pull a lot of current, so don't cheap out on an ESC.

If you make your own mount / pulleys, sub 200 <i>might</i> be possible, if everything works the first time building.

i feel like a spam bot..
here's my build video.
no caliber trucks
no flywheel clones
no cnc

the HK ESC is great. I use it a lot.. cheap as chips. solid as a rock.
I think you get the idea.. you can do anything with anything don't limit yourself to what everyone else does.

I have the same esc just the 120amp version and works great. Also the keda 190kv 6364 motor from hobbyking works great that's what I'm using at the moment and it's really cheap too

Hi the hobbyking mounts need a bit of fettling with a grinder I bought 4 to play with coz there cheap I use Sk3 6463 single drive and dual drive. built with the stepson have about 4 now.

So it is basically impossible to put a board together without all this equipment correct?

Im not sure i understand the question?

You are going to need a soldering iron and a drill at a minimum.

I originally put a board together for much less than £200 and this guy's already got batteries and a charger which was a large part of my costs....

@JAG1 I'd definitely go for the HobbyKing motor mount and an SK3 6374 149kv. Personally I'd go chain drive but pulley and belt is easier. You want at least a 6s 50c power source.
XT90 anti spark loop key for on/off and to save your electrics and the Mini Remote.

To be clear - there's cheap (if you are handy) and then there is inexpensive (with confirmed working setups).

If you can't do what @lowGuido does...  You might be better off with a simpler setup that doesn't require quite the tools/skill to DIY.

like he mentioned - you'll still need a soldering iron, misc wires, connectors, etc.  Basic tools like drill and such also help.  

You'll want to grind or drill a detent on the motor shaft to secure the grub screw, or grind a flat spot to fit the 3mm key/keyway if your motor gear has one.  I also loctite (blue - removable) mine on, and if you need to remove them just heat them to do so w/o major effort.  I've had to cut off gears when i secured it a bit too well...

It's all in your ingenuity and ability to DIY.  Only you can determine what's a sweet spot between easy/kit and inexpensive/DIY.

GL!

Well, I upgraded the ESC and the battery to VESC & li-ion after 10 months, but to test the esk8 water it was perfect.

Single motor, two 3s lipos, cheap controller, standard trucks, DIY mount, chain drive, initially standard 70mm wheels, upgraded to 110mm scooter wheels.... Loved it and got me hooked on esk8...

I have a power drill, but no soldering iron. so I am halfway there lol. What I was asking is, is it possible to put a DIY board together without a full garage full of equipment. Everytime I see pictures of people putting boards together, I see them using machines that are the same size of them to cut metal and stuff.

Checkout , @torqueboards will have everything you need from mechanical kit to motor and batteries and even the cables.  This is not the I expensive way to go but it WILL work.

If you wanna save money learn to solder, buy some 10 & 16 gauge silicon wire on Amazon and make your own cables for xt90/s connections, RX connection, etc.  

Motors and motor mounts, trucks, wheels, etc. only require hand tools.  A decent socket set, hex wrench set and cordless drill will do everything you need.  

The best advice is to look at the builds section for boards that you like and build a shopping list from there.  Look at my beater board for an example, only $670 complete.
