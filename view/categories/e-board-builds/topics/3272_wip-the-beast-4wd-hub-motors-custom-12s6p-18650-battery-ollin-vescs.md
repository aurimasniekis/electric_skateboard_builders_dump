I just ordered all parts and it is all in a very early stage.

What i¬¥ve planned:
- 4 wheel drive hub motors (@jacobbloy) to get awesome hill climbing abilities (i hope so)
- Hi-output battery with INR18650-25R cells (BMS-Limited to 100 Amps)
- 4 OllinBoards VESCs with Heatsink
- Custom hollow board to hold all the stuff
- Nunchuk controller(because it is part of Jacobs VESC Connect BETA program)

I will update this post soon with some drawings.

First deck design (without core):

hmmmm... I'm planning a similar build using hummies motors. Would be interesting to see how they compare the two.

I¬¥ll do so, i own two dji phantoms and a bunch of gopros^^

@evoheyax that would be a great comparison, the only bottleneck on such beasts are the motors

That would be awesome but could be a bit wobbly just sliding / clamping it on.
And it will definitely only work with 4wd apart from that you cant climb any hills
but i hope you succeed ... i want some

I want this to work so bad lol. We always say 2wd is awesome...when it works.

4wd might be a juggeling act.

You could build 4 solid boards with that much tech lol god bless

how long/wide is this battery? Any idea what the watt hours are on this? And is 12s6p still 44.4volts, or is it more? I'm so stoked about this build!

```
LxBxH: 680x140x34mm ,
15AHx43,2V=648WH

Li-ion has a nominal voltage of 3.6, so 43.2

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/long-range-budget-build-diy-18650-battery-vesc-280kv-wood-deck/2919?u=flatsp0t

Has much more range, less amp output and less topspeed.
But exactly this was the purpose of it so...

Definitely bigger in size and Number of cells

Thats the reason i did not count this number in. Also the cells are used, so not 100% of their capacity is left.

on my first 2 batteries I didnt use protective cardboard shields, on my latest batteries I used them to prevent just what you experienced and to make them more robust on the long run! the cardboard shields are very cheap too, even though they ship all the way from the US: http://www.ebay.de/itm/331832123025

I replanned the deck a little bit, it is now going to be a Gbomb-Platform

Something like this, a little bit thicker and hollow to encase battery and vescs.
