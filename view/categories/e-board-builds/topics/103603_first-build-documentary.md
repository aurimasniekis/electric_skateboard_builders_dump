After watching a friend, decided it was time for me. Started from a yuneec ego, to Backfire G2s, to Boosted Stealth. Now working on an off road beast with great range.

These are the parts I have already ordered.
Dickyho Caliber Motor Mounts
Dickyho 200kv 6374 Motors
TB 218 Trucks
TB all terrain 6.3x2.5 wheels
MetroBoard 10s8p LG MH1
Vesc Mini 4.2 updated 
Recycled Backfire Deck with Homemade ABS enclosure or
SkateShred Deck with Psychotiller enclosure

I like the look and shape of the backfire deck but because of how thin it is, none of the current Psychotiller enclosures will fit. 
I'm also not sure to get the VX1 or buy another 2.4ghz trigger remote.

Dickyho: $160
     Motor Mounts
     Motors
     Cross Plate
     Steel 16 Pulleys

TB: $275
     AT Wheels
     218 Trucks

MetroBoard: $445
     10s8p battery
     4amp charger

Alliexpress: $115
     Mini 4.2 Vesc

Misc: ~$50
     Nylon braided cable
     XT90 Connectors
     Bullet Connectors
     Kayak Handle

Total: ~$1045

I currently have put few parts together, still missing my vesc to bench test. I also need to figure out my enclosure and remote and hopefully I can be riding by the end of the week!!

You'll have to bypass the bms on that metroboard battery if you want more than 15A/motor. Looks like a good start, but that's a short list. Where are the rest of the parts, and _the pics?_

Also, before you spend too much time on this thread, might as well head over to https://forum./ where you'll get way more 'ttention.

Actually forgot to add that I have bypassed the discharge so I should be getting 80 amps out of the pack now. Was contemplating on putting the same post on both but I'll just go ahead then. Thanks!
