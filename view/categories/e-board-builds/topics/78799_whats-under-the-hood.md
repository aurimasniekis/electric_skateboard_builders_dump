Interested to see how much people will use the enclosure as a housing vs the electronics on the deck

I built my battery into the enclosure, yes can remove it if need be but it won't fit in any other enclosure.

Both my friend, 80-90mm axles and you can just swap the wheel out when you want a change.

I'm going to run these 107's on this deck and 105's on the other Hummie but I'll have a set of @moon's pneumatics for this one and 6 shooters on the other. Best of both worlds.

very tight for space so everything fits where it touches.  The actual finished article has some more foam and cable management.  Next time I will use some right angle techniques on the xt's to save some room.

Soldering the cable at 90 degrees to the connectors can help with cable management.  Some clever bastard did it on here and I am blatantly stealing the idea.

But the voltage regulator doesn’t create heat ? 
I was thinking about buying another lipo because 
I don’t know if the yield of a regulator is ok compared to another smaller lipo

Ive got this thingy where you can adjust the output voltage via a poti

So no current lost with the regulator ?

## \#44 Posted by: pat.speed Posted at: 2018-12-24T12:25:52.750Z Reads: 106

```
Very minimal, most buck converters work in the upper portion of 90%. And that is percent of the current they are drawing. 

Example: you need 24w at 12v. So 2amp current

Pack voltage is let’s say 36v to get 24w we only need 0.66667a to reach 24w. Then 95% so let’s say we input 36v at .66667a (~24W) output will be 12v and 1.9a (22.8W) very minimal losses and hardly any current draw.

These were just random numbers I pulled out I don’t think you will be needing 2a draw for some led lighting unless you are going for a high power front light
