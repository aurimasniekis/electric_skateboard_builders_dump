Sorry for the dissapointment but..it aint made out of guacamole.

Decided to take on a project besides my studies, saw the electric skate/longboards and fell in love straight away.

Ordered some stuff from Diyelectricskateboard and it was so smooth even with the long ride overseas - lovely!

Finally got my stuff right before christmas and decided to get something going here and share my progress!

As I got the motor, trucks, wheels, vesc and remote a week ahead of my actual longboard I decided to mount it on my skateboard - for the giggles :joy:

Got myself my board - mounted trucks and wheels. its a very flexy board but tried it a quickie and it feels really nice so far. Might get abit unstable at higher speeds due to the flex though.

Got my hands on a e-bike batterypack, 10s4p and was thrilled - til I realised they were Samsung ICR18650-26F 2600mAh - 5.2A which dont seem to cut it for an electric skateboard.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/1/71e9a80a61549d4208a150cdd9c88d6860df1420.jpg" width="281" height="500">


So for now I've not yet got my batteries due to problems with hobbyking - was gonna order 3s5000ah lipos from hobbyking and connect them into a 12s instead - but luckily order didnt go through.  I would've problably regret it by now as I looked more and more towards the 18650 battery packs.

Decided Im gonna try build my own - made myself a layout of how I want it but still not decided.

Since my deck is quite flexible I most likely gonna go with a 10s3p setup to save space - might go 10s4p, or 12s3p.
Any thoughts?

Also as Im not using a spotwelder this often I looked around alot and some people soldered straight onto the cell which I kinda want to avoid. Saw that some places sell their batteries with nickel solder tags from them. Quite thin thought ( 30x7x0.12mm ), 
**is it possible to solder a lets say 10awg wire on thoose instead to avoid the soldering on the battery or would it just be taking to much heat due to the size of the soldertag?**

Anyway, if you have any feedback or tips from what you read here - especially about the battery part Im greatful for advice!

Wish me good luck! :grin:

Update - Batteries now in progress, made the 6s4p part of the battery.

Decided to solder it with a high watt iron - barely soldered for god knows how many years so was nice with a little refresher. Had some bad solder joints but after some more soldering I started getting the hang of it and it seemed to have a strong hold.

Making the battery split into two sections ,one 4s4p, and one 6s4p to be connected as a 10s4p. (inspiration from @whitepony).

Tried the board with the 6s4p - got to excited and damn, alot of power eventhough not the 10s setup.

Made some simple "templates" and recorded myself bouncing on the board just to check the flex along with my future enclosure sizes for this board, and gotta say, Im slightly worried :joy:
Seem like the enclosure area wont take to much bend from the flex but the ground distance is the worrying part.
Was bouncing pretty hard on the board though to try and max it out.

Waiting on some orders now for my enclosures and also battery capacity display along with some wood inserts for the enclosures. After that I gotta order the charger whenever spring festival is over. :)

What did you decide/conclude regarding the soldering tags? I'm considering them as well.

Yeah was thinking about it but decided Im gonna try do it this way. Might even try and rear mount the motor so I can put the enclosure closer to the trucks, but that means to make an extended motor mount along with a longer belt. Got 3mm spacers on it atm and wanna avoid making the board higher as for now.

Thanks! Well was gonna go for a spotwelder since I truly believe I would get down to making battery packs more often, but wasnt sure. Either way decided to try this, went abit back and forth of how I wanted to connect them, ended up using copper braids due to the flexibility, was either that or cables but braid seemed fine and cheaper(easier for me to get aswell).

Also consulted my dad to see what he thought about it (used to work in tv-repairs back when you actually repaired televisions :p ) And his opinion was to solder it aslong as I would do a quick job doing so. Used a 90w old soldering iron. Was very smooth and fast. 
Only thing I did was underestimating how good of a heat conductor copper really is :p Bad mistake, voltage seem fine but will see in future whenever i get my charger how that paralell holds up.

Ok! I've actually got a spot welder. Not sure how long it's going to hold up(there has been some weird noises at times) but if you're doing another pack don't hesitate to PM me if you want it spotwelded. 

Are you done with the enclosure?

Not yet. Been having a lazy week. Might start making something to shape if after tomorrow so I can make atleast one out of the two enclosures.

Nice, at least you're making progress! I've been trying to figure out how to do my enclosure since summer.

ok,Yeah also been putting some amount of thought into how and what to make mine out of...

if I had a spare oven that I could use to heat abs or kydex, I'd build some kind off vacuum forming rig.
Gonna try shaping kydex using a heatgun over a shape.

Don't bother with a heatgun, honestly. Tried it, didn't work out. I did put kydex on some bakplåtspapper and then put it in the oven in the kitchen. Worked great, except I didn't have a vaccum table and instead tried to force it with a jig. So that was a failure.

As long as the kydex doesn't get burnt, either by touching anything but the bakplåtspapper or for staying in the oven for too long, it should be OK. But I did make sure to put the fan on max and open a window when I did it.

Yeah, I kinda wanna avoid putting it in my kitchen oven.

I did see a guy here using oven,and a jig and then heatgun for small corrections. Turned out really good his results!
Barnes'd on youtube if you want to check him out. Hes also on this forum, cant remember his name however.

Yeah, I've seen Barnes'd! His videos helped me connect my nunchuck to the VESC.

Mine is also pretty flexy, but too short for two enclosures. 

Bought it from diyelectricskateboards! The shipping costs 40 bucks...

Oh nice one. isnt that the best way for you to make your enclosures then, 3D printing them?
How big things can you print with it?

Thanks, I'll make sure to remember that!

It is, but it's not the easiest really. I can print 150x150x150mm, but as long as I'm willing to glue stuff together I can always make it bigger than that. 

The storm trooper helmet I'm wearing in my profile pic is actually 3D-printed - http://imgur.com/a/9qKZz

Update. Decided to work on some enclosures. See how they came out using only a heatgun to mold it. 
Shape was alright. Need some smoothening on edges. and shaping. 

Managed to drop my heatgun on the enclosure to make a burn mark ontop of it.... also my saws blade wasnt fine enough to saw in this material so broke on of the edges, But didnt break off to much. Just wanted to see how it was to handle the material.

Some more work and the encolsure will good enough for now

Quickly put together what I had, motivated to get a quick try in the nice weather. Only got to try it quickly but hopefully more tomorrow.

Not the prettiest of enclosures and plan to remake atleast one of them and polish the other abit,(shape is horrible at the edges as for now). But it does the job so far.
It worked fine however and seem to hold some power.

Currently looking for a good solution for a bms and switch. Might just go with a loop key in order to be able to have a smaller BMS so I can fit it in my enclosure. 
Not much space here, Not sure how Im gonna fit it all :joy:  -

The board is very flexy - Video demonstration of me(70-75kg) jumping on the board: 
(Temporary solution with the electric tape holding cables up since I was to eager to drive the board so didnt re-solder them).

Put a loopkey on my board today, charged batteries up to 41volts. Went for a lovely ride around my village.

Around 6-8kms today. And battery barely moved and my feet completely died(bad shoes + bad asphalt is a killer). 

Winning remote cut out once and board went on full break - happened once manged to run fast enough not to fall luckily.

heres a quick vid! 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqIkshYR94A

Need to fix the failsafe for now so it coast and dont instant break my board on disconnect, anyone know how?

longterm gonna get a new remote controller when I find a reliable of my liking!

Other than that ,was really nice to ride and carve! Lovely weather aswell!

And a video. Just testing the application and firmware made by @Ackmaniac 
Im currently sick with fever and dizzyness so I did not dare to push the speeds to high. But the wheels felt so stable even at 35kmh+
