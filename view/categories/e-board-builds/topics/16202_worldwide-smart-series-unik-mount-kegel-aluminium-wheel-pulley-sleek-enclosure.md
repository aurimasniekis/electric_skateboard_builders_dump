Let me introduce you the SMART series. This starts with our 32T 15mm AL7075, black anodization pulley for Orangatang Kegel wheels. For the details lovers, they are really light, strong and provide full clearance on a Caliber 2 truck, even without any wheel spacer. I've also added a smooth internal curve to get a sleek finish. If any interest, I'm going to organize a group buy on these as we ship worldwide. 

Didn't have the time to see if they fit on my pair of Ronin, will report back later on today.

Really liking the finish of it! Could you explain the pro's and con's compared to a normal pulley like the enertion one?

Not wanting to spoil Unik, but the pro is the price (this piece is easier to produce). The pro of the enertion one is probably better mecanical properties.
BTW, unik also produce the enertion like ones :

So a milled pulley is cheaper to produce than a plastic one? I doubt that...

There is a misunderstanding here. 
I was refering to the two concepts by Unik (which are both in Aluminium).

I geuss these dont need truck modification? Was referring to ABEC wheels actually, noticed the kegel structure later. Im just considering if this is actually better than a plastic pulley and also cost-effective. Like if this pulley costs 50€ and a plastic one 30€ but the plastic one only lasts for 6 months while the aluminium rocks 2 years. Meaning the aluminium saves 70€ long-term.

The new version with full clearance, like the Trampa ( or new esk8.de too now, I think I have see), is realy a second option that unik had to propose ! Now want them too :smile:  haha  .

Just to add my pov, I got the Pro one ... its magic to set up (compared to ADS or DIYES) !!! Look forward to try them for a ride ! (soooooon)
https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/dsc_0180l.jpg
I also got the FW version (but just one ...100€ pieces... it's a masterpiece ! But I need an other one for DUAL...)

https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/dsc_0150l.jpg
So I dont used it too,..cause my proto board isn't set with caliber, Paris or Ronin trucks... and it's hard to set ... 

BIG UP UNiK !!!

Now, could  we wait for more ratio configuration for this Smart diy section ?

Let me introduce you our molded ABS enclosure made within an automotive company. This is sold with a laser cut professional foam to remove vibrations and have a pretty sweet finish. This is a 10S3P pack with a load of BMS that you can easily fit... and add two VESCs, antisparks for the dual lovers or single buddy !

to have the slimmest and sleekest enclosure possible. Cells, then Cells+BMS, then VESCs/ESCs/Antispark. This is really subtle and really thin below the deck.

happy riding!

oops, sorry for that. We've updated the price to make it 39 euros without the laser cut foam and put that as an option, as DIYers we sometimes have many stuff in our toolbox from previous build. The site is also mostly translated into english.

@Mobutusan much appreciated. your right, in fact there's a story ! I build lots of decks for my pleasure as a DIYer guy and you know where are always looking of the little detail to improve things. Some people call that continuous improvement, I will call it ... huge fun ! When I was building my first UNiK prototype I had some motors with short wires... but that was a shame to extend the wires and not clean. Then I had also some wires routing issues and even for maintenance that was OK... but well.. I did it my way. I could have dig into the deck like I did for my Boosted board replicate 2 years ago... but I decided to make this hollow part. Maintenance, motor changing is straightforward. It's a building block of my builds. These are ABS UV milled parts. Strong quality checks.

Thanks all for the support; I'm not making any big benefit on the sales; everything is reinvested immediately in my R&D (PLA, Prototype milling, many iterations). My last sale allowed me to do the dual mount giveaway which included free shipping to Canada... 

Don't hesitate to shop as I ship worldwide the same day!

Happy riding!

Very cool risers. And the non-logo ones are on sale?! I might have to pick up a couple of these. Now that I think of it, this would be a really clean way to do a 4wd build, and be easy to swap back and forth to 2wd, especially with front hub motors. 

Any chance that you're working on some lightweight, carbon/alum freebord style bindings? That would be rad. :snowboarder:

@unik Good looking products.  I am interested in the riser with channels for motor phase wires.  I am confused as to which one this is.  [CUSTOM ELECTRIC SKATEBOARD RISER PAD (NO LOGO)](http://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/no-logo-riser-pad-set-special-esk8/) or [SWITCHBLADE E-RISER PAD](http://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/riser-pad/)?  It looks like the first is a single riser with the phase wire channels and the seconds is the same plus a front riser, but I wanted to clarify before I put in an order.  thanks

I took some time to translate the site in english, it may not be perfect but opens it to more people. The shipping calculation is automatic (you need to register to see it) and I'm not getting money from it.

@Mobutusan yeah, only issue for me is the price; small series means that cost a lot; and that's all my personal money !  I'm actually riding with 3D printed hooks reinforced with CF. They do well but that's prototype. Once I'm finished with some new mountainboard stuff coming soon; I'll come back to the freebord. a sneak peek for you!

The no logo risers are on sale yeah, I lowered the price as much as possible to make them accessible, I'm not even sure I earn money on them, that's like 1 to 1. These risers are really handy and help in having clean builds.

@mmaner thanks mate, much appreciated. For the risers, they are the "same". the NOLOGO is only the rear riser and no printed logo (that costed me a LOT but well :)) ... the SWITCHBLADE is front riser + rear riser (printed). If you don't care about the UNIK logo and have already a front riser; go for the NO LOGO; otherwise the SWITCHBLADE has both front and rear. Up to you if you are on budget.  Hope I'm clear!!!

seems the weather is getting better in Paris, I'm going to ride the SMART series mount / drivers tomorrow morning and will report back with a riding video ! cheers

- 12 or 10S
- 190KV DUAL
- 18T / 70T 
- 15mm belt

Ratio : 3.89:1

Speed Ratio	0.26
Pitch Diameter - Large Pulley (A) (mm)	111.4
Pitch Diameter - Small Pulley (B) (mm)	28.6
Desired Belt Pitch Length (mm)	419.4
Teeth in Mesh  	6

10 days is impossible to make as I ask my supplier to do a dozens of quality checks. I'm going to produce 20pcs so it's a big amount of money to add to the existing orders. In any case, I am also looking at getting alternatives for shipping to lower it at the maximum. So you can still get yours and I will ship them.

are you coming to Paris? we need to have a ride together man!

@Jebe : I'm actually working on the ronin ones but I have so much stuff going on right now that I want to avoid over committing. If there's only thing I want to avoid is too much marketing and talking with no delivery. So basically, I prefer to under commit and over deliver than to tell people nice stories and ... make them wait for ages. So to answer your question : not yet :slight_smile: 

I need to:
- finish the mounting block to fit Ronin
- Check the mounting plate to provide enough cleareance without any truck modification.

=> To me, based on the actual demand on these, this is not a huge priority.

do you have facts to evidence that with such perfect alignement / tension, the belt moves side to side ? 

to me this is no problem as I can easily move from 15mm to 16 or whatever (and the parts are produced in limited quantity) but I'm riding easily like >300km per week in all conditions even jumping for years and everything is really working fine.

How Wide is your motor gear Beween Flanges okp.??

Yes im sure it will still work fine,.. But if your belt is 1-2 mm OFF your wheel gear , the pressure on the edge will wear belt much faster AND you are the only using 14-13mm of belt for torque ,..not the full 15mm.

...Simple fix is to make 17mm wide Gear , that way your belt can never go Off wheel gear even if Motor Gear is 17mm wide

Its either against one flange or the other.and thus off your pulley by 2mm

See this picture, motor gear is 17mm between flanges,....wheel gear is also 17mm, ..no problem,.. if i had your wheel gear, tell me what would be happening ? <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/0/f028c73db247ebfd1473cd32ed83a78e24eaef06.png" width="281" height="500">

you are mixing two different things. First, you put the wheels pulley, then align the motor pulley with the belt on. If you have the perfect alignement (even if you would like to get the belt touching your motor pulley flange) you don't need to have a wider wheels pulley.

All my builds have perfect alignement; This one is my little 12S cruiser with 15mm wheel pulley that has not moved for 6 month, same belt with hundreds of kilometers... and I'm kick flipping the deck and riding on dirt (for fun).

It's always good to oversize things; but sometimes this is not needed unless you have clear mechanical facts that this is.

I got also some that are 17mm between flanges and it applies the same. I avoid "luck" when I ride my or any electric skateboards. Everything has to be perfectly aligned, smooth, no weird noise... or I just don't ride it. I spent so much time on my decks, testing all kind of things that I cannot afford playing with luck. 

if my belt moved to the opposite flange, this would then be an anormal situation to me and I will find the root cause of it. If I have clear facts that this happen; I will then adjust and move forward.

You say
 "if your belt moved to opposite flange that would be anormal"
   if you are so perfectly alligned there is a strong possibility it will move to opposite flange from time to time .

If it is allways on same flange tell me why? , are you slightly un-alligned??

Maybe we should just ask an Engineer here if it is wise to to have wheel pulley  (Less wide) Than Motor Pulley ?

In my pic if belt moves ,. I covered, ..if yours move , ..belt will overhang gear.

Someone called for an engineer?  You may regret that, I like to tear topics down to the root and rebuild 😀.

Regarding the wheel and motor pulleys alignment, other that space constraints it doesn't hurt anything to have a wider pulley than belt on either the wheel or motor or both.  I adds no more torque, wear or strain to the belt.  Assuming the motor mount is perfectly aligned to the hanger it doesn't help anything either, just means you have more pulley than needed.

I would agree that using a wider wheel pulley on single motor builds is wise.  There's a lot more torque stress on the motor mount with a single motor, so it gives you a safety margin.  

In mechanics it's  typical to use only enough surface area to support the contact necessary.  Therefore, n dual motor builds were there are usually space constraints you want the wheel pulley to be as large as the belt, the motor pulley size is irelivent as long as it is at least as large as the belt.

If you use motor mounts like UNik's with the support bar it is easy to get the motor axel and wheel axle perfectly parallel. Then you can use a 15mm wide pulley without issue. 

For motor mounts that are do not have the support bar its difficult to get the axles perfectly parallel. While it's possible to get a perfect alignment during static fitment. What I found is that going from acceleration to breaking the belt will wonder left and right a little. So the added 1 or 2mm is welcome in that case.  

Also without the support bar there is some amount of flex in the mount when going from accel to brake. 

My point is if you use all UNiK parts it should work perfect.

thanks mate! that's one of the key reason I designed the dual core mount two years ago for my UNiK complete board. I wanted something solid that avoid using any epoxy and that you can rely on over time, anytime. So far, the mount has not evolved even a little bit. Still the same. Only the bar, that I can customize for some of my friends like LHB.

For the alignement I'm now finishing the update of my core pulleys to have the integration of the bearing changed compared to my initial core pulleys and this will perfectly match a complete dual setup using eCaliber extended axles.

By the way, is some of you are looking to buy some eCaliber trucks with few other stuff, shoot me a PM... I can arrange ya a 20% discount on these babies !
