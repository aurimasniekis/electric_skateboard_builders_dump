I'll start with a disclaimer, you're not going to find anything super creative in this build. Evo's are being used commonly now, caliber trucks are as boring as they get, 30q's and focboxes are the "standard", 10s will just get the job done - and that's pretty much what I was after. She's going to be a rock solid, medium sized, reliable and comfortable board that I can turn to when I just want to ride.

Special thanks to @Eboosted Alan and @bigben  Ben for all of the advice and help so far. This community is equal parts super helpful and ruthlessly brutal and that seems to work really well.

I've had a couple of production boards, I recently parted with an Evolve GTX which I owned for a month. Motor failed 7 minutes into my first ride and chucked me on to the street, remote failed several times after that was replaced. 

I generally ride slow/medium pace and casually. I'm a 35 year old father of two tiny people and I'm doing this to get out and enjoy myself, meet likeminded people, feed my urge to tinker and make use of the amazing surroundings we live in here in the south of England.

**Deck -** Landyachtz Evo Falcon 36". I was eyeing up the 39" evo for months when I first got into all of this. When the 36" came to my attention it seemed perfect. I can just about mall grab it and carry it around, the deck area is perfect for my height at 5'9 and it just happens to look sexy af. Bought from @fottaz  at eskating.eu

**Trucks -** 50/10 Caliber 2's. I have a black set and a gold set, I'm still trying to decide whether or not I'm going to bling out or not. I now have a set of six shooters though and am torn between keeping the caliber 2's or getting some TB 218's so that I can use them (I'm assuming the six shooters wont fit on standard 10" caliber 2's?). 

**Wheels -** 107mm superflys with super reds from @DavidBanner  and six shooters bought from @Papperlapp 

**Drivetrain -** DIYE 12mm 15/40 kit. I'll see how this goes.

**Motors and mounts -** 6355 190kV Sensored and Caliber 2 mount from @DavidBanner at Street Wing

**Enclosure,** 10s5p 30Q battery, Switch, focboxes, BMS and basically all electronics are coming from Alan @Eboosted - built and ready to go on. This was a lifesaver because I just don't have space to pull all my tools out where we currently live. I am capable of doing this all myself but I know Alan will do a very professional job and he's so damn quick and communicative!

I jumped on the Metr Pro order from @rpasichnyk - timing on this release was good for me!

Riptide KranK 90a Canons for the front and KranK 90a Canon / KranK 90a Chubby for the rear. Thank you for the advice thread @alphamail - While I was at it I got the Riptide custom esk8 riser, not sure if I can use it for this build but I thought I might as well get it to support the cause.

I'm in the process of buying all the little things like mounting inserts, screws, spacers, risers, tubing and so on.

Living in the UK has made this build incredibly costly, but I suppose that's just life. I am about to start a second vanguard single motor build as well as a loaner for friends wanting to try it out. It means I can go on rides with them and they'll likely be here within a week of riding it planning their own builds ;)

I'll keep this updated as I go along for anyone thinking about starting out with a similar build.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with using commonly used parts, there is a reason why they are so common. That's a great-looking build, you will have a ton of fun with it.

I've been pushing this around for a few days, smooth as butter on the 107's and they just roll forever. I almost don't want to power it up haha.

Electronics 90% complete, Alan is just waiting for the BMS which is out for delivery today I believe. While that's on the way over I'm waiting for drivetrain (which is stuck at customs, waiting for charge to come through), metr pro and a few bits of hardware and assembly will begin.

In the meanwhile I've started collecting parts for the second loaner build. Trying to decide between a vanguard and pintail of some sort. I want it to be different to this board, a bit more cruisy and carvy. I'd like to have the choice of a nimble solid board and a floaty beach front carver.

Open to pintail suggestions and battery mounting options on something a bit more flexible.

I'm so conflicted here. These six shooters have really thrown a spanner in the works haha. 

![six|374x500](upload://wheicX6ar5VQRl5uUCYMIOHyuer.jpg)

I've got the new motors and tb218 trucks in a basket on street wing (thank you @DavidBanner ) , I'd only use the hangar from the TB trucks on my caliber base.

I'd also need to get a 15mm motor pulley and belts.

Do you think it's worth all this extra expense and time to have the option of fitting these pneumatics when I want to? Or should I just stick to the 107's? I'm not going to be doing any offroading to speak of, this is just for comfort.

Got everything on hand now to put this together.

Lack of tools and workshop space stalled me for a while but I managed to get into a friends garage today and it's stacked with everything a grown man could ask for. Managed to get a whack done.

![20180705_111210|666x500](upload://mqlBQXZRglXOCLYar6wZPoK50uH.jpg)

Started mocking up the drivetrain, all fits well.

![20180705_165733|374x500](upload://yrNKcQDwzl8H2eeoU5U6cT2mqQl.jpg)

Got the inserts installed in the deck and

Got to figure out where the power switch is going, apply the gasket and its all mechanical gravy from there.

Bonus pic, one by one all the other motor heads on the estate ended up coming in to look at the board haha. These two guys from the motorcycle store feigned nonchalance and then ended up asking questions about the build for 30 mins :smiley:

I couldn't deal with the raw bolts that came with the wheel pulley and the replacements I got were too long, much cutting, surprisingly tough hardware :expressionless:

This has all been on hold for a month while I worked some things out. I've been putting effort into my second vanguard build but am looking at this again now with the hopes of getting it up and running next week.

Waiting on some reverse TB mounts as I had to give up on forward mounting with the enclosure being so close to the truck and there just not being any feasible room to move the truck back any more.

From @sk8l8r 's thread this is the plan:

I have a set of @dickyho dual idler mounts here, I’m going to steal one of the idlers from each mount and install them on the TB reverse mount:

![ilders|374x500](upload://n1oRbFtam5UNhfMaRkR2g1Mckm2.jpg)

I’ll drill out a little section of the motor mounting groove to give it some stability from sliding and then use a decent size bolt to put this idler on.

![tb%20mount%20adapt|690x261](upload://48FVlxEVOeznScfA0cs2tYgZ9Ls.jpg)

The idler bearings have a lip on one side and a nylon spacer, perfect for holding the belt in place but they don’t look like they are the best bearings in the world :wink: I’ll see how they hold up and replace as needed. 

I had to give up on the anti spark in the end, there's just nowhere to mount the button and enclosure space is really tight as well, so going to opt for a simple XT150 loop, idea stolen with love from @Deckoz

Overall the wiring looks ok for a bypassed discharge setup.
This is correct if you are using a low amp charge only bms.
I cannot verify your balance connections because there is not enough detail in the diagram.

@sk8l8r rough test fit for rear mount on tb reverse.

Actually quite like the look in the end and there's loads of clearance at full lean, access to the kingpin isn't an issue at all either. These are 345 long ass belts 😶

Maiden voyage on a single motor. Focbox smoked and died on motor detection so I'm rolling around calm on this for a family break. 

Smooth as butter, looking forward to two motors.

Huge thank you to @bigben for all the help.

Other than the fact that Starbucks tastes like antifreeze, these morning coffees are getting better and better.

Been bombing around since 5am on smooth empty streets. Got to get back in now because the kids are up.

I just messaged you in your thread. I did not get the motors underneath in the end and had to mount them out the back. Bit of a disappointment unfortunately. I tried several different mounts and risers.

I would highly suggest the evo 39"
