Hi! Anyone here selling battery packs based on Australia? I'm planning to get a flexible 10s4p or 12s4p for a board that I'm planning to build, similar to the evolve GTX. Anyone able to make a battery pack? I don't mind paying a little extra. 

I'm just not confident in myself when it comes to electronics.

Very surprised at the cheap shipping cost.

Kevin according to your website, $48 to New Zealand. Why is the Australia option crossed out?
