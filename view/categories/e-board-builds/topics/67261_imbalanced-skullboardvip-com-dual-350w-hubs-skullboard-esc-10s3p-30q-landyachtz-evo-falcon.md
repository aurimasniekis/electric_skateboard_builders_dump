Short version: great promise, and I hope SkullBoards replaces our hubs so I can revise this review - because there are moments of awesome when riding the Skull Boards Evo, AKA the SKEEVO... that are followed by hours of fatigue and pain, from hub vibration.

**This is so much vibration, that it's going from the hubs, through new Ollin Popocas, into the hardwood floor, up a Gorilla Pod and distorting the camera on an iPhone X.**

The designers of these hubs have a terrific vision that, in my experience and @donta42's post confirms, fails due only to low manufacturing tolerances.  Hopeful this is a bad batch.

Simply put, we cannot find any way to balance these wheels and both hubs wobble, at all speeds, making the board unsafe.  The vibrations are coming from both ends of the board (all four wheels), so it presents an oscillation effect.

![fullsizeoutput_1eff|666x500](upload://jEVbdHOQ8fVvzUXSL0ozPGTXapN.jpeg)

Here's the good: when the oscillation stops, the SkullBoard drivetrain runs beautifully.  The hubs get very hot going full-tilt (about 20MPH), and exactly as predicted, the rear rubber gets very sticky giving this Evo a kart-like feel.  It's awesome and I look forward to the "precision" version of this in the future:

![IMG_0983|374x500](upload://sUFfF940xwToj9bo9VAeNyjj878.jpg)
I believe I discovered the optimal way to balance these wheels without altering the hub; I slid bits in the little side holes, that go across the tire - which helped balance the tire, but nothing I can do will fix the hub.

![fullsizeoutput_1efe|666x500](upload://g7EYoPmP99CnHSz7NYDyze8flYW.jpeg)

You eagle-eyed readers may spot some missing screws; at the start, all M4 screws were in nice and snug with blue Loc-Tite.

/that's/ how much the rear hubs vibrate, creating what I can only describe as, the most uncomfortable ESK8 I have ever built or owned.  

The feeling is best described as riding one of these:

![75682d2e60677b4c3a201f0252d6a0c9_large|500x500](upload://aLVqAKPsjrvp9JSSfet9UooInNE.jpg)

(or riding both of these, as is often the case for my fellow Raptor owners ;) )


![fullsizeoutput_1efa|666x500](upload://sv7oi8ho6P1iUVEXzvpxeMCQIQG.jpeg)

The look and geometry is actually very good; I can turn easily within the street and the board feels wonderfully stable at speed when it's not vibrating.

![fullsizeoutput_1efc|374x500](upload://4TsTJyN2prCMl6VijOPnLHjqOjs.jpeg)

Yes, I even tried to shape the tires but it doesn't help because the cans themselves are not perfectly round and aligned.

![fullsizeoutput_1f01|374x500](upload://1kJnrZpZgKFwuYDyEyQJfiEDyN0.jpeg)

I'm going to ask SkullBoard to replace the motors, see if they want to give this build another shot and we will update it here and on Reddit.  

Two of my friends bought SkullBoards and both have the same vibration issue.  It's not unlike the Backfire2 vibration issue; it's just _way_ more exaggerated.


For the record, it didn't feel any faster on 12S, so we've set aside the TorqueBoards 10S3P battery as it's safe to say the SkullBoards kit performed the best with that battery.

The good:

When our Skull Boards Evo, or "Skeevo", rides smoothly for a few seconds at a time - it feels /amazing/.  Hard to argue against car rubber for asphalt.

The bad:

imagine driving a car with four tires that are out of balance.

to give you an idea of how worse that is on a rigid downhill legend like the Evo, at 18 MPH, I backed off because I thought the /Avenue/ in the front couldn't handle it (I have sorbothane between the battery and electronics and the deck, they were fine).  

Screws with Loc-Tite jumped ship tho.

The Skeevo is a failure in that, as it stands, it has the worst boardfeel of any esk8 I have ever owned or built.  

Ask my brother @donta42 how his stock SkullBoard rides, and his is understandably worse (no avenue truck, shock pads, tire shaping, etc.).

This could be a bad supplier shipment for SkullBoards, and to be fair, even my new Boosted Mini X arrived with a bent axle.  It happens.  

I'll update this review as I have time, but for now, we're pulling the @SKULLBOARD drivetrain out of our Evo test mule.  

At certain speeds, for a little while, the vibration from both trucks will cancel each other out and seriously - incredible boardfeel, love it. You can tell these are going to be awesome in the future.

A shame about the vibration, the board looks amazing

When I used a generic 110mm wheel made of rubber, I had a similar problem, so I cut them in half to find why they were so unbalanced. Turns out that the rubber pour was really bad, lot of big air pockets in some places that made the wheels completely unstable at high speed

But if you say that even the can is unbalanced the problems is more serious

Not to the tolerances we require for the speeds at which we ride, my brother.

No way I would say try 30MPH on these, for example.

In automobiles, wheels/tires that are unbalanced will make the car shake and vibrate at certain speeds.. The seat.. the steering wheel.. the frame of the car... and all the while, the car will consume MORE fuel as you continue driving that way.. 

I wonder if the "AIRLESS" nature of the tires, and those little tunnels across the tire mimic a poorly inflated car tire,.. which will also cause vibration in an automobile... The way the wheel compresses unevenly during carves/turns and even simply going straight.. The "structure" of the tire doesn't hold up uniformly, thus introducing more vibration and poor fuel efficiency.   

I actually DO NOT KNOW what the next step is for me now...

I think this is SkullBoard’s first customer service test.  Let’s see if they offer to swap out the hubs. 

I’d happily accept old-fashioned thane hubs that ride smooth over the Tonka-truck boardfeel. 

To be fair: the SkullBoard ESC is a keeper, hands-down, the 350W king, and I am going to try it with my Landwheel X5 hubs if all else fails. 

A YouTuber we all know reached out from Reddit, today, asking to review the Skeevo as it is. 

We’re not out to embarrass anyone so I politely declined, yet the point remains: the best upgrades in the world can’t fix a warped hub.

I guess that is my question now... 
Are these warped hubs/"rims" ? 
or is the nature of the "airless tire" contributing the inconsistent deformations...???

Because on a car, each of those two things will create the same symptoms (perhaps at different speeds)


(could be both! hhaha)

Also i love the evolve trucks. I want to combine those :).
130 dollar for 2 hub motors and 2 wheels is not that much i think..
 I only need to vind evolve trucks somewhere xD

No taxes or duties; I ordered the ESC and controller from Min at @SKULLBOARD and DHL delivered very quickly - in fact, I believe SkullBoard's ordering and procurement system is the best out of all of their competitors (SMS updates, someone is there in live chat always, etc.).

I bought the hubs + 21,098 ft. of bubble wrap from @dspx who wanted to ensure the SkullBoards safety so badly that she packed them in a box the size of a microwave ;)

does it accelarate a bit nice?? 
i maybe want the same esc.. but want to know if its good..

Get a dual Flipsky 4.20. Their ESC is not near the torque you get on the 4.20 but mostly the battery consumption is infinitely better.

It never happened :) tear-down of the can itself revealed several mechanical issues that, in my opinion, point to Skullboards using factory seconds or rejected hubs from Jomo.  

Very disappointing. 

Do not recommend Skullboards, who ignored our feedback and proceeded to continue to sell a substandard product to western consumers, placing our people at risk for injury for tens of dollars in gains over using a quality can.

Got mine from Ownboard, no complaints here, vibes under 5mph but nothing obtrusive, no overheating either, seems like the luck of the draw. QC may be a big issue though, I know my square motor mounts that bind to the truck are anything but square, had to convert it from fwd by swapping the motors, don't think it'd be easy to swap back, as it looks like the locator was cut out using a butter knife, no kidding, absolutely awful. Also, need to Caliber and riptide everything, cause the stock stuff is junk, there's like 2mm of kingpin slop!

Yes, there is a funny vibration with these wheels. I don't know if bearings or just balance of wheel but there is an issue. I just put up with it cause I hope that another 100mm + wheels comes to market soon.

bringing this back from the dead.

got a set of these from @mishrasubhransu and yea, one of the drives are wobbly af.

put it aside for almost a year but want to try these on the haya short deck.

anyway, plugged stuff in on the bench to test

![0905192204a|690x388](upload://2xOG8vNMozMUH5MRb3VSPl6UyBt.jpeg) 

and played around with weights and placement along the wheel.

after a number of tries, playing around with different weights and position, i think it's balanced out now.  hard to tell in the video but i just inserted a screw, maybe 3grams, into what must the lightest point along the wheel and the vibration is mostly gone - definitely an huge improvement.

https://photos.app.goo.gl/7vAk33QnvxcVRt2v5

did something similar with 6shooters but using 5gram wheel weight and sticking them in the hub inner lip.

not sure if this is even relevant anymore though.

I still have my set completely intact but hardly ever use it because of the vibration. @thisguyhere Can you share how you located the "light spot" on the wheel? And how do you figure how much weight should go there? Is it just a matter of trial and error until you visibly see less "wobble?"
```

## \#30 Posted by: thisguyhere Posted at: 2019-09-06T16:19:42.020Z Reads: 56

trial and error.  literally went around the circumference.

move the weight, spin it, decide if vibrations to away.  rinse repeat until you find a spot where it's the least vibby.  then add / remove additional weight to see if it's improves further.

again, it's just trial and error.

at least with the 6shooter i can spin it to see where it settles, then add weight to the opposite end.

I'm now experimenting with one of the "new" big wheel shock-absorber solution, but so far it looks like the exact same typical issues.  Even if the idea actually works, they can't seem to manufacture a set without horrible symmetry issues.  Both the motors I got seem fine balance-wise, but the front wheels, which you'd think would be far easier to make without them coming out janky, are wobbly as all hell.  Sad that they don't seem to learn from their mistakes.

Gotta give credit to all the wheel makers (Orangatang, Kegel, etc.) as apparently pouring thane into a mold isn't as simple as it sounds!

I wouldn’t recommend getting them yet though, as I have yet to ride them, or even get a set that isn’t as wobbly as the Skullboard ones were.  I think you can see their “quality” in the pics.
