```
so Im starting my next build that will likely take quite a while seeing as im still waiting on hub motors to be made.
I will most likely be 10S dual hub motor VESC driven 
but im starting to custom fab my own carbon fibre deck from scratch.
Im still not sure if I will use a little bit of ply in there for a carbon/wood hybrid of sorts 
i'll keep you all up to date in this thread.

When u say plywood inside do you mean already glued instead of unglued laminates? I'd think that would be too stiff already to mold. Why do 10s when u can do 12s?

I was thinking of putting some  small strips of ply or even aluminium just for some ribbing inside the carbon fibre. Im not even really sure  myself yet.  Im just winging it. I have a bunch of ideas in my head and I am going to do whatever works best at the time.
 I was thinking 10S because of size.  I want it to be compact as possible.  All my previous builds have been 6S and im happy with the power. 12S seems a lot of power for no real reason.  I dunno maybe I will change my mind later when i have some motors to test.

You're going to put something inside the center of the board though right?  Why not just get some laminates of wood or even shaped foam. 
(4) 3s packs of 5amphour fit nicely even on just one end of the board but 10s I found awkward...and then you're missing out on the esc potential.

Chakka @ ollin boards says 12s is a little rough on the vesc and he knows his shit 10s can take u almost 30mph or a lil higher and with dual motors should be even faster but 12s i think even if chakka is wrong its still over kill as my man stated

yeah speed is not really a problem.. my 6S board is fast enough.
only reason I'm going 10S is for the hub motors to give them some more torque 
I might even go 12S yet.. we'll see

first thing I have noticed, are that these things are BIG!
much bigger than I am used to. I usually roll with 70mm wheels these bad boys are 85mm so they kinda make my board look like a monster truck
I'm definitely going to need to buy bigger wheels for the front. Any suggestions?

I like them with kegel's on the from that 5mm difference you don't notice, I'm not sure the performance implications of bigger wheels on the back but drag cars do it lol! If you use different size risers then the deck will be the same hight.

Others wise 85mm speed vents.

Well I have set up the hack board for initial testing.  Unfortunately at this stage I have not finished making my 12S lipo packs so all I have are these 6S on the hack. 
So far so good. Although I havent got the v2.16 VESC firmware so I have downgraded them to v1.14 because that happens to be the version that works with the software I had.. I'm sure I will find the firmware some where some time.. but for now thays how im rolling.
 Also a severe lack of available JST plugs is making things a bit tough so i might just solder directly to the board. Probably easier anyway. I don't even like plugs.

So I have started building my custom 12S slim pack.
I pulled apartment 2 of the multistar 10000mah 6S packs and have mounted them side by side for a slim AF arrangement. I hear people talking about the multi star packs not being very good, but at around $7 per 10Ah cell im not complaining  (yet)

super simple to solder. Although I have to admit, as experienced as I am with soldering I did have one minor hiccup with a small short!

I was using a "helping hand" soldering stand to hold the JXT
<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7eea8c2aa75c36b301cbd9686ee25b4bd0ca3984.jpg'>
like this one. 
and the metal clamps had unknowingly shorted the exposed metal on the pins of one cell.
<img src='/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/fab20d13f7169c0d5c559e34a29107f962da534c.JPG'>
fortunately I was very quickly aware of the short and I was able to stop it before any damage occurred!

just goes to show, its easy to make mistakes even when you are super careful.

I really want to take as many photos and videos as possible, but unfortunately I'm often lacking in the camera dept. I try to set my phone up on a tripod and film stuff sometimes, but it rarely comes out, and just gets in the way.

If I was to wait until someone could film things for me I would take forever to get things done.

How did you solder the aluminum  battery tabs after  you broke  apart the spot welds?  They are aluminum and hard to solder.

the tabs were not spot welded they were soldered. I desoldered them one by one, and then soldered short pieces of 10 gauge wire between each cell.
I used a 1.6mm 60/40 tin/lead 5 core 362 flux solder and a high quality weller Iron with a 5mm tip (if exact details are your thing)

for what Its worth I was going to solder a triple strip of tinned veroboard between them all, but decided that 10 gauge was more appropriate, if not overkill.

The multistar 12000 is only 2c.  Too bad.  The 10000mah though great deal.  At 10c and 10000mah that's great.  If u didn't have a job u could probably sell soldered packs of those.

So after a lot of consideration about pros and cons of carbon fibre I have decided to make a maple carbon fibre hybrid deck.

That is so awesome, i was planning on doing the same thing only with a space cell in there.
How many layers of carbon fibre did you use? And did you test the strength already?
I thought about reinforcing the board by adding small alluminium bars/strips if the flex is to much.

there is 2 layers on the top and I plan to put 2 layers on the bottom as well. I stood on it today and it takes my weight but I plan to strengthen it with more carbon anyway.
I have also thought about the possibility of aluminium strips, but I don't think it will be necessary.

That's awesome! For your access lid, I could envision a hinged lid or two (for battery and electronics) held down by clevis pins, like a race car. There would be a small 1/4" step down in the wood around the perimeter of the enclosure and the carbon would wrap down and cover that step, stopping at the inside edge of the enclosure. Then, on that step would be a thin layer of rubber or neoprene gasket material that the lid would seal against, with pins to hold it in place. The bottom would basically look like flat carbon with a flushed, hinged hatch that would be mostly waterproof. I don't know if that makes sense, but that's what I would try if I had your skills.

I'd like to keep both my cap boards. in fact fitting the VESC's isnt really an issue I allowed space for them.
the things I haven't yet allowed for is lipo alarms. (of I suppose I could just rely on the VESC low voltage cut. thats probably easier)
the beauty of having wood in the build is that I can just route out holes where I need to.
I'm thinking about having a loop key somewhere behind the front truck...

so the carbon fibre topsheet was first vacuum formed over the top of the deck and then laminated to the top of the deck once the deck had been cut out.
I also intend to vacuum form some more sheets of carbon over the bottom of the board once I have routed out all the voids I need for wires and whatnot.
I trimmed the hole a little bit too precisely so I'm going to need to route out approximately the width of 2 sheets of carbon fibre so that when I do the bottom layers the batteries still fit.

Have you finished the bottom yet? This looks amazing so far and exactly what I want to achieve regarding the extremely slim factor. My only worry is the strength of the board... I don't have any experience with carbon fiber so I may be stressing over nothing. It just looks like there is not much material left near the corners of the battery enclosure. Please keeps us posted on how it all turns out.

Good Luck!

I have been really super busy lately. I have not yet finished but believe me I will get pictures up as soon as I do.

I know that there is not a lot of wood left in the board but I think people are looking at it the wrong way. this is not a wooden board strengthened by carbon fibre. This is a carbon fibre deck with a bit of wood in it to dampen the ride.

just look at evolve or enertion decks made fully from carbon fibre. you don't see anyone questioning their strength because they have no wood.

I havent finished yet, but by sheets do you mean layers? i have 4 layers on top and I'll have another 2 on the bottom and then another 2 for the lid.

@lowGuido Oh okay. Is the vacuum bag necessary for the process or could you just apply pressure with weight and a plastic sheet in between?

Yes I meant layers, sorry. It looks great though and will be really stealthy! 

One last question what are the dimensions of the modified lipos? (Width and length) and it appears the "hole" for these to sit in was hollow as such is this correct? Sorry for the questions I just really like the look of this and want to replicate a similiar idea for my stealthy board I want to make :slight_smile: thanks

@lowGuido Hey man. Any updates on this build. I'm planning on trying the same thing with a 34' Top Speed LandYachtz that I bought. I'm really scared that the wood is gonna snap in the middle. It's a $130 board, and i don't want it to go to waste. How stiff is your board with the 4 top layers? Do you think it is strong enough to hold without adding the bottom two layers? What weight carbon fiber fabric did you use?

A question though, how do you recharge them ? You need a beefy charger to charge 12s 10ah right ? I suppose both batteries balancing wires are in parallel ?

Also how long does it take you to charge them ? 

Great job, can't wait to see your board complete and have some feedback on the ride experience !

I use two 6S chargers. Ill draw a diagram a bit later.

here is diagram.
the XT90 loop key is removed for charging.
also of note seeing as I made my own battery packs I made the red and black balance wires out of some thicker than usual wire for higher amperage charging. i think it was maybe 16AWG from memory?

Are you charging with the balance leads only?  If so it's gonna take a long time to charge.

Max charge on the balance leads is 1a right?  I charge my 6s pack at 5 amps.  That should be 5 times as fast.

someone wasn't paying attention..

my balance leads should handle ~35A although I only ever charge at a max of 5A ;)

Ahhh, guess I missed that part.  I plead cold related stupidity...Went on a ride in 14 degree temps and forgot my gloves.

There's no spark when connecting the packs to the charger that would degrade the connector?

Pretty cool, I was afraid that because of the 10Ah 2x6S charger would take forever to charge.

Gives me ideas :]

Good job !

Another question, your XT90 connector is anti spark ? 

I am in thr process of building a similar electronic layout and I think of going with 2 on/off switch, one instead of your XT90 connector and one on/off switch with resistor for antispark. If I was able to only have 1 switch doing both it would be ideal but I don't know if the resistance in the xt90 would screw up the charge somehow.

Btw, any progress on the board ? How is it riding ?

Yes.

I don't think that would be a good idea, I cant think of any switches that are going to be able to handle the current required at the XT90 and survive. plus having 2 switches seems overly complicated when 1 loop key is enough.

Could this be the thinnest ever deck with 10000mah 12S and ESC's?

Still not sure if the board is really thin or you just have really big feet... :laughing:
