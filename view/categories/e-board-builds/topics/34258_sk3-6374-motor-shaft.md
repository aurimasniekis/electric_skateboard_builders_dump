Hi,
Is there any way to put a longer shaft to this engine? I have searched but can not find a replacement shaft that is longer than the original.
Attached schematic to see the problem, I think it goes too tight.

I would have to bring the wheel pulley closer to the motor mount, to re-align the pulley motor and I do not think I have room for that either.

The only solution I found is this, but it requires more mechanization, and I do not have many tools for this, I want to keep it simple.

Hey, it not a real problem if your sprocket miss a millimeter of shaft ;)

You're right, I do not see the threads on the plate, they are embedded?

Do you think that the marked accessory is a shaft extender? the other (right) is sure to be to the rear of the engine.
