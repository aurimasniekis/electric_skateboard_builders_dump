Hello! 16 y/o from Toronto riding pre-built boards for a while. Been slowly collecting information for the last year or so through reddit & this forum but visited more seriously starting last month. 

Thought I'd share with you my first build. Got tired of my boosted board v2+ and wanted something better. So I sold that and built this! Hope you all like it. **_Currently waiting on the battery from @RedBaron to arrive should come next week (will update the thread when all is running!)_**

**PARTS LIST:**

* Sector 9 Bintang 
* Haggy 2-1 Drive Train (w/ Bergmeister Wheels) by @riverside.rider

@egzplicit's Jet Invasion Votager-X 

& the evolve GT Bamboo 

**BUILD LOG:**

_All started when I broke my wrist while playing ultimate frisbee, decided I'd take the downtime from riding to build and prepare a board for the summer._

![IMG_2889_-_Copy|375x500](upload://fLhQRF3GXMlXoGAKRdeU1uiqiAF.jpeg)

* First order of business: sell the boosted board.

![IMG_2597_-_Copy|375x500](upload://46Yh7CqI3jsLpkVFwGx58zhVM0L.jpeg)

* Then, proceeded to do my reading on the forum and compiled a parts list. The parts slowly started to trickle in one by one.

![IMG_2700_-_Copy|375x500](upload://z0Jq1iaOVw8UhPek9kYSS2wyxAn.jpeg) 

* Amazed at how nice these wheels are! Tried a friend's evolve with pneumatics and I was hooked.

![screenshot-207|670x500](upload://hvVlsdAKcnLefb5OChPXYgPi9B0.jpeg) 

![IMG_2807_-_Copy|666x500](upload://b6pyctjMpiZIGBr34SvJ7KLEins.jpeg) ![IMG_2838_-_Copy|375x500](upload://qfpPLrgbKMjkI5MeQkymTWPqZtu.jpeg) 

![IMG_2811_-_Copy|375x500](upload://jwHP7JhOUXm9LCDZenAOeAYFcYc.jpeg) 

* Didn't exactly like the design on the bintang, so I sanded it and bought some spray paint to make it black.

![57947692204__08E24A4D-78B0-4EAA-BB66-3160D8B530CB|375x500](upload://uHtdUNNFHOo5dQkzVW2cQe67atM.jpeg) 

* After 3 thin coats of paint, this was the result.

![57957264884__D3BB7A7C-8F60-45B0-ABA0-D00AAF8D6C34|375x500](upload://b5Ox0SsSXAjljyYubTMJ0q0yEpS.jpeg) 

* However... figured I'd top coat it for some extra protection and it wasn't applied evenly. Ruining the look :( 

![IMG_2843|666x500](upload://iSuU127TgiKfWfOoC5pT4lEaK3J.jpeg) 

Next, I clamped it down to mark where the enclosure is going to go. 

![IMG_2847|375x500](upload://tv7oMf7H6rDa22cNFBChiVaC1AA.jpeg) 

![IMG_2849_-_Copy|375x500](upload://shFXXITJaug3ezEpwgFMawJXZqh.jpeg)

Then, drilled the holes to put the inserts in. Didn't tighten the depth stop enough for two of them and accidentally poked through the board :( 

![IMG_2900|375x500](upload://cOxglJqg2y2dOtWwu6Y8BSLU4wv.jpeg)

 ![IMG_2898|375x500](upload://is5eSEJy0PFy8zsFUzxmdPybc0v.jpeg) 

Got a friend to help me apply the griptape, design was inspired by @egzplicit. Messed up the design the first time (looks too triangular), so went back and fixed it later.

![58034355454__5CAD6874-F5D7-4AD0-A539-ED86D900A965|443x500](upload://yPkQkWQhVriOcaS1KE6qBpUURjA.jpeg) 

Test fit in the enclosure to plan out wiring in my head.

![IMG_2895_-_Copy|666x500](upload://8EDhRcjBRH7ZOQxijGKB0iSbHKK.jpeg) 

RedBaron sent me a picture of the complete battery (blue one) ! The last part to arrive.

![20190519_223756|666x500](upload://sLTu9Arn91fqfrIdSVhwLzjjKxQ.jpeg) 

![20190521_212644|375x500](upload://2CVJNEzLyVn6UpKXyuAspvGnqvz.jpeg)

Cast finally came off! Wrist feels quite weird.. Decided to wear a wrist brace for the meantime (my hand looks really strange in this picture)

![screenshot-208|304x500](upload://tBhszmOjr0ZTFcz7GU4PAezvHbs.jpeg) 



 In the mean time, finished up getting the cables through the wirelooms and putting together the trucks. 

![IMG_2946|375x500](upload://ijxS5D1cuRyHSCmQpDDLWYg3Gui.jpeg) 

At first I tried a drop through mount, but the motor mounts weren't long enough for adequete clearance - and I was too lazy to cut and round off the ends of the deck. Decided to top mount for more motor clearance (put a riser on top to cover the hole)
 
![IMG_2941|666x500](upload://tdXC2SZ7VaEyGAgEDzA0rivarQS.jpeg) 

![IMG_2944|666x500](upload://vBrdo6QbtNnQT2KTnNkjjCOhPWz.jpeg) 

Everything is now mounted and ready to roll. Patiently waiting for the battery!

![IMG_2955|289x500](upload://rP6j9xSqc5Z3uabpDNKLNpKYZiP.jpeg) 

Test fitted the enclosure on to the deck, looks good! Just got to tighten the screws a little more so it compresses the rubber gasket along the edge fully. 

![6X2A6806|690x460](upload://b38QMc2rVQmaH6tQOhonZz6ReQS.jpeg) 

Just discovered @Riako's motor covers & guards for Haggy Motors today. Will have to get these printed and on the board ASAP!

**BIG SHOUTOUT TO:** 

@RedBaron
@Jinra
@Flashgod224
@riverside.rider
@psychotiller 

for helping me along the way and answering all of my questions. I'm sure I'll have plenty more when wiring everything & setting up the vesc, all the posts about fried vescs have left me very stressed. 

_Battery is scheduled to arrive Thursday next week. Will update the thread when it comes! For now I'll have to read and watch videos on VESC settings and such so I don't fry mine. Will also test the Bergmeisters when board is fully completed! (Does anyone have a recommendation on what PSI to run them?)_

This came together really well! I'm glad the enclosure worked out for you. Can't wait for that battery to get here now. The berg tire itself should have recommended psi rating. I usually run 5 to 10 under max.

Hats off, seriously.

I don't think any average joe would be able to build a board with a broken arm. Well done!

Hmm, I pumped up mine this morning at around exactly 60PSI... Should I be worried?

Where can I find the recommended? Checked Haggy's site but only says the max at 85.... or am I just blind?

Maybe the tire itself can do up to 85, but the inner tube only 60? @riverside.rider :smile:

This is a nice tutorial to get you familiar with the wring and vesc tool.  Good luck my friend.

Saw you on the fb group! Did you ever sell your Lacroix?

- Hoping to see you at rides after your builds are done!

Didn't sell that yet, A lot of interest but I'm shying away from shipping it so waiting for someone local. I rode it quite a lot since posting it and I'm having a lot of fun so if it doesn't sell I won't be sad at all :smiley:

Despited being on my 6th e-skate or so I never joined a group ride before... not sure why, I guess I feel it's already super dangerous thing to do on my own so rather do it alone or in small groups for minimum distractions.

@rusins: Hi there. I have pumped up the tire to 85psi without a problem but this really depends on your weight and the terrain you ride on. 75psi is what has worked very well for me on flats (am 78kg)

Edit: when we had the tires made, the 60psi should have been 65psi....but was too late to change.

Great! I was worried that i'd have to run them at 50 or something which felt way too low, 60 feels nice, but will probably up it to 75 as well when I get these tires on an electric board. At the moment I'm just playing around with them :smiley:

I ride them at +/- 30 psi for a while now, and it's just perfect for me :blush:   
(well, it was mostly the winter season,.. maybe I put some more now it's not mud or snow or dry roads. But works well on kart track too).

**Update:** 

![screenshot-212|394x500](upload://zelA5OOzhIUKQcHwteUOnTHWB5A.jpeg) 

Battery arrived Thursday and I started to put it together. Very chunky and big battery. However, ran into several different issues :frowning:

1. While setting plugging in the loopkey to check the connections, heard a pop. Not good for a XT90-s loopkey. Upon further inspection, it seemed like the resistor for one of the bullets went off :( Will have to replace ASAP. 

![screenshot-214|532x421](upload://AqwIBLcR3KhRlf9qGRLoJCvB5iN.jpeg) 

After further research and consultation, it was resolved that I was good to use the key as long as everything worked, but will be soldering a new one on whenever that arrives. With the pneumatics they ride like a dream. Different ride, but very nice.

![screenshot-213|403x499](upload://nL9NrBxbd0Btjww4xvQMJj1PZpH.jpeg) 

![screenshot-217|690x279](upload://6HnUroZvVyQuqTX2vTUqggke8jz.jpeg) ![screenshot-216|345x500](upload://554Rgdz5znQZMEhxhslxnuUnF7A.jpeg) ![screenshot-215|690x327](upload://wYa44BkPgutrYxMinRRgBWO7PaV.jpeg) 

After coming home from the first ride, many things were evident.

* This thing is damn powerful. I think I'll be sticking to the slower modes on the remote :D 
* Along with that, the brakes at -60 were way too touchy for me, threw me off a few times actually.
* Will have to play around with the settings/throttle curves to make it perfect for me. 


2. However, after attempting to open the enclosure to go back into the VESC tool, it seemed as though 6/10 of my inserts were stripped. Very unfortunate scenario. Couldn't get the inserts out to replace new ones, so decided to just drill through the board and mount it with a hexnut (like how the trucks are mounted). Lose on the aesthetics but now they're super secure. 

_Overall, more than happy with my first build as this has so much power for me! Quite heavy though, maybe the next one will be a lighter, smaller compact build. Thanks to everyone on the forum for your kind words + help & info. Will be lurking around here & on  for the meantime until the next build._
