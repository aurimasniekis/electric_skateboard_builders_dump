These are the parts for my build:
-All-terrain drive system from haggy with 190 kv motors (ordered)

-Dual FSESC 6.6 mini

-DIY 12s 4 or 5p battery (samsung 30q cells from batterioline.no) with DIY glass fibre or carbon fibre enclosure

-deck from haggy (ordered)

-Flipsky vx2 remote

I need a recomendation for a good BMS, I'm thinking about getting the bestech D140 charge only BMS from buildkitboards.com, but its wiring is a bit weird so I'm open to sugestions.

What do guys think of this build?
And also any board name ideas?

I've never heard of that website for buying cells, you might want to verify the site and your payment options ( look for a safe one)

Other than that it looks good. How are you doing the diy enclosure?

I live in Norway, so the website is Norwegian, so i wouldn\t have to pay the duty. The pricing of the cells looks about right (around 3$ per cell), and the payment method seems legit too. 

I'll be making the enclosure with glass or carbon fibre, and a 3d printed mold.
