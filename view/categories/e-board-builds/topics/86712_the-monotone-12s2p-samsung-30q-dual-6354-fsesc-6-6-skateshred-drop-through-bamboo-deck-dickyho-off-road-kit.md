Making a new thread since my build has changed so much since my initial post.

Finally done after hours upon hours of CAD, drilling, cutting, waterjetting, painting, and laser cutting. Perhaps getting hit by a car and destroying my deck was a blessing in disguise. I love the feel and flex of this new deck, especially how low to the ground it is, and getting a blank deck really gave me a platform to be creative.

Build:
-12S2P Samsung 30Q battery from @hyperIon1

-Dual Flipsky 6354 motors

-Flipsky FSESC Dual 6.6

-Skateshred bamboo drop through deck

-6x2 airless tires with 60T wheel pulley from @dickyho

-15T motor pulleys from BKB

-Extended Paris Clones from Dickyho

-Extended Paris motor mounts from Dickyho

-Riptide Krank 90 Barrel boardside/ street barrel roadside

-Handles waterjet out of 1/4" 6061 aluminum and paracorded

-Drop through supports waterjet out of 1/4" 6061 aluminum

-Bottom wrapped in white carbon fiber vinyl

-Griptape laser cut and laid over vinyl

More build progress photos can be seen on my Instagram, give it a follow for constant updates.

I'm really proud of how it turned out. Also comment what you think I should name her. Open to any questions or more details about my build.

How's Dicky's parts working out?

Pretty great so far. No complaints about the wheels, pulleys, or motor mounts. My only complaint is the stock bushings and washers are pretty bad, so those got replaced almost immediately. Also looking into replacing the pivot cups since there is some slop to them. All in all though, you can't beat the kit for its price.

Chat to @Alphamail Brad about the cups. He'll more than likely have something that works off the shelf. How close is the clone to Paris? Got anything for comparison?

I just want to see Dicky do well to be honest, he's a good guy.

Yeah, I just got some measurements yesterday, I was going to post since they seem to be slightly different from genuine Paris trucks. I don't have a direct comparison of the overall truck since I don't have Paris trucks
I agree, dicky has been nothing but helpful throughout the several months I've worked with him.

  Excellent build, Benjamin said to tell you, "nailed it" on the battery. We are happy that it all came together. 
Definitely dig the process of evolution from original concept to finished board, so sweet.
 Always stoked to be a part.
Thank you

You know what to do if you have any issues.........

Range should be around 10-12 miles on flats 7-9 on some hilly terrain, based on my metr.pro readings.

Cool suggestion but don't like the connotations that goes along with it. Somebody on Instagram suggested the Arbiter. Guess it's between that, the Monotone, or maybe the Orca.

As was I, I would have loved to go for a 12S3P battery,  but that meant getting a new battery enclosure and more money for the battery. I also wanted to keep the board lighter if possible since I'm always carrying the board in and out of class. It already weighs in 23 pounds. At least that's how I justified it in my mind. Maybe if I'm able to raise the funds for another build in the future....

How far you can reach with those set up? 12s2P and AT  6x2

I've been using about 20-30Wh per mile on BLDC, but after changing to FOC a couple days ago, it seems like I'm using around 15-20Wh per mile. Doing the math would give me roughly 12-15 miles in FOC. Further testing will definitely be needed for a more definite answer though.

What a beautiful build man. I really love the look and everything you used. What are the specs via range, top speed, weight, and acceleration? Also how do you like the flipsky 6.6 VESC and flipsky 6374 motors? I want to do a build with them too! I am looking to build an AT build and love the idea.
```

Thanks!
Here are some specs.
Top speed: 30mph
Range: 12-15 miles
Weight: 23lbs
Acceleration: Can't measure it but it tackles every hill I've encountered with ease

The Flipsky 6.6 has been pretty great, it's been quite forgiving of my initial mistakes in the beginning such as trying to run motor detection while the phase wires were shorting out.

My motors are 6354 not 6374, and they've been pretty durable. One of them has a noisy motor bearing, but that's most likely from riding around in the salted snow over the winter.

Feel free to ask any more questions.

How is the at performace with it? I'm looking at the wheels wor my build but I'm a liitle worried about the ride smoothness on gravel roads and such.

The wheels have been great. The tread design isn't meant for hardcore offroading, and neither is the contact patch of the wheel which isn't too wide. However, it has no issues handling gravel, grass, and dirt. Much better than your standard urethane.

I feel much more confident carving around corners due to the additional grip compared to urethanes, but still wouldn't recommend it in case you do lose traction. Comfort is also slightly better than urethanes when it comes to small bumps or cracks in the road.

I wear my large laptop bag to the store then play tetris at the register stacking everything neatly in there. Beats having to carry them in one hand.

And thanks for the compliment! I'm happy with how it came out, except the bottom vinyl is peeling already so I'll be taking it off and spray painting it white instead sometime soon.

How one knows where on the truck to place the mounts? It is kind of a silly question, but I was wondering how you know if the trucks aren’t too far to the right or left.

Sorry for the late reply, I don't check these forums much anymore. The 6.6 I sold to a friend running 12S lipo pushing high currents and they've been perfect. My motor sensor pcb got fried after running in snow over the winter but the motors are still ok. 

@Tarxan you base it off of how far your motor pulley extends, and align the motor pulley with the wheel pulley.
