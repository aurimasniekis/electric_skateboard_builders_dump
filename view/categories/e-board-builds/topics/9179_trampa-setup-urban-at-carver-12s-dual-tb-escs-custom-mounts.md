In addition, I've already purchased the two esc's from @barajabali, belts from SPD(15mm), wheel pulleys from trampa (15mm), aluminum for the mounts (6 thousand series 1/2 inch), and some misc things like the remote. 

Right now my biggest question has to do with **MOTORS**

because of my 15/66 drive ratio, 170kv puts me at a theoretical top of 37mph, at 80% efficiency that's around 30mph. 

I know I don't want to go faster than that, but having the extra wheel speed available is a plus in my mind.


**Ollin Boards 170kv 5065** 
_-pros-_ 
light
enclosed
keyway
8mm shaft
perfect kv
_-cons-_
only 50mm
might be cutting it really close on dual for length if you look at my truck dimensions..

I could also go with a 6355 from Torqueboards, Enertion, @michaeld33 (with 10mm shaft, limiting pulleys alot), but all those are higher KV than I'd like to deal with... They would all easily fit my setup though without sacrificing power, except for the KV problems.

Turnigy 6374's are outa the question though for length..

What are your thoughts? 

@chaka, @barajabali, and @Nowind your's would be greatly appreciated!

I think torqueboards has 170kv and 190kv 6355's now. New and improved stators over the 230kv versions.

ah, @torqueboards does have a 170kv 6355.. 
diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-170kv/

This now becomes a big decision between the  Ollin 5065 and TB 6355. 

Same KV. Same shaft size. Both sensored. 4$ difference.

Hi Builder,



this will be a fun board! Why don't you just pick the stuff we offer? 
Our mounts will work for the 83mm, the 90mm and 7" Wheels. Lots of 
brainwork in there to achieve this unique feature!

http://www.trampaboards.com/trampa-urban-carver-truck-motormount--66-tooth-pulley-kit-for-converting-your-urban-carver-p-13129.html

Left and right mounts are available!

The desired top speed is far to much! You can drop in Dampas to reach higher speeds, but: Its a Carver not a racer! 

You would loose all the ability to take sharp turns. These Mini Spring 
Trucks really behave completely different to longboard trucks! They are 
so much more fun to ride. You really want TORQUE, not topspeed. You want
 to take steep turns and then accelare to take the next turn.

Our 136 KV @ 1Nm motor is really nice to reach the desired speeds. 
Designed to run on 12S, it has plenty of torque and is fully HALL 
sensored + temp sensored. Its really designed to match the VESC setup 
perfectly. 

Guess who did the testing, consultancy and final tuning? Its a motor 
without any compromise, designed to go hand in hand with the non 
compromising VESC.

The 136KV@ 1Nm motor would give you 42Km/h top speed on 12S. That is far beyond any scale of ride comfort and safety!

You don't want that extra "wheel speed", because this would make your 
setup very inefficient when you ride at lower speeds or want to ride up a hill. 
You want to gear exactly for the average speed 
you ride and the hills you have to take. This way you run the motor mostly at peak performance, 
draining a min of Amps + have lots of Torque.

All you currently do is loose Torque and run the motor not at the 
performance curve section. The difference is: 70% COP vs 90% COP. It 
really depends on how well you choose your gearing and corresponding 
Motor KV + Voltage!

Hope that helps a bit to get a perfect setup running. 



Frank from Trampa

Thanks for the suggestions frank!

I went ahead and ordered two 66t pulleys with the board, and will be making my own mounts. 

Unfortunately, with my current budget I can't shell out $265 per motor as you have them listed, I will be going with some of @JLabs 6355's. I am also concerned with the truck width (I will be using aluminum mounts instead of the super thin carbon you guys are designing), so the sk3 6374 149kv is also out.

Also the speed controllers will be torqueboards 12s esc, which doesn't have sensors, so I wasn't taking that addition into account, even though it is a nice touch!

I think at my weight (60kg) topping out at 30mph isn't going to be horrible, especially riding in a dual config. I won't ever go that fast, but when riding in sand/dirt it's fun to get a bit of wheel slip. 

I may just drop the voltage down to 10s to drop the top speed even more. still undecided one the battery front, only concrete figure is that I will be going with lipos. 

Budgets man, they ruin all the fun! :wink:

ok.. so here's the price breakdown thus far: 

-Trampa Urban Carver: $400 after shipping
-2x Trampa 66t 15mm wheel pulley: $90
-4x 15mm 425mm belts HTD5M: $56
-2x 6354 190kv @JLabs  motors: $132
-2x Torqueboards esc's with programming card from @barajabali: $245
-6001 series 1/2inch thick aluminum (a lot of extra too): $30
-GT2B: ~ already have
-UBEC: ~ already have
-Lipo charger ~ already have
-Misc wire, connectors, etc: ~ already have

Spent thus far:  ***$953***

needed: 
-15mm Motor pulleys (12t? 15t?) 
-**BATTERY SETUP**
-enclosure style


I currently have about 180-200 that I can spend right now. This makes me lean towards a lipo setup just because I wire together two 6s batteries and get a running board without spending even more of a fortune. 

That said, **I do have a complete that I could sell..** really don't want to hassle with parting out, but would be willing to let it go for cheaper in order to fund this mountain board. 

75a 83mm Abec flywheels/caliber trucks silver/torqueboards most recent mount/ single torqueboards 230kv 6355/ Castle creations mamba monster 2/ gt2b/ fiberglass case/6s4p lg cells (no BMS, just lipo charger/balance plug) 


Pictures will start rolling in this week as the board will be showing up- already have some small things like the aluminum!

Hi cmatson,
Why didn't you buy the slave pulleys together with the wheel sided pulley?
http://www.trampaboards.com/13-tooth-x-15mm-wide-motor-pulley-fits-into-trampas-electric-skateboard-motors-36-p-12855.html

I would go for 13 teeth. 
Regarding the space available between the  pulleys, I can help you to figure that out. I think Sk36374 will not be possible. Let me have a look...

Two VESCS would be better if you ask me. Current control, temp sensoring, FOC, super smooth startup without sensors, canbus...

I'll probably get some from @torqueboards, as he's local to the states, so it's a fair bit cheaper. 

I've gone ahead and purchased two 6355's, so I'll definitely have enough room on the back for the drivetrain to all fit!

Vescs are great for street boards (have 3 of them) but for this high current board I wanted to go with something a little more beefed up. 

First impressions of this board are amazing!! You guys killed it and shipping was like 4 business days to the states. Bravo, bravo

I'm waiting on delivery of the complete (except battery and electronics) [Street Carver](http://www.trampaboards.com/trampas-electric-holypro-street-carver-with-mini-vertigo-trucks--stickies-longboard-wheels--p-13404.html), which is a close cousin of this Urban Carver. I'll be setting it up with at 12S with a VESC.

@cmatson I look forward to seeing your complete setup. Have you given much thought to enclosures? The flexy deck presents challenges. I'm thinking of either (1) putting everything in a box on sloped portion on the back or (2) putting the batteries in the front and the electronics on the back, but I'm not in lo ve with the idea of either solution.

@trampa Can you elaborate on the [motor](http://www.trampaboards.com/136-kv-2400w-dc-brushless-motor-6364-61-p-12967.html)'s specs? For instance, what is its maximum current rating? Also, will the sensors all work with @chaka's [VESC](http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/vedder-s-speed-controller)? Of course, it's a _very_ expensive motor. I ordered it mainly because I figure you guys will have engineered everything to work very well as an integrated package. How would you compare it to the SK3 6374 149kv motor (I've been using until now)? I've been very impressed by its performance.

Hi Steve, what kind of battery so You Want to Mount? 18650 cells or Lipo Packs. I would recommend to usw our Battery Support, since it fits directly onto The Tip, allowing The max tilt of the trucks. 
Motor: Our Motor is based on the SK3, despite being completely re-engineered to suite skateboards even better. Its based on 6364 format. Everything is top spec, magnet, copper, bearings, shaft etc! That's what you pay for....
No chance to increase the quality any further.
Max current rating depends on the voltage you want to use. 50A is about the limit. Since the motor features a temp sensor, you will not be able to overstress it, using a VESC with the latest Firmware, which will be released in mid November. Benjamin and I tested it to the extreme... It works just fine pushing 200Kg up a steep incline on a single.
When the motor reaches 100deg Celsius, power will be reduced to let everything cool down.

440lbs? impressive... I guess :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Anyways, @SteveS I got the stiffest deck Trampa had available at the time, but you are right in that it still is flexier than any wood deck I've owned before.  

I was thinking of doing something like this, because I have a lot more height than you do to work with: 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/b/8b7ead07dd16f23de543a030187c4b319b1363c1.jpg" width="375" height="500">

It would have the two esc's in a box on the back angled portion, and 4 (or maybe just 2) 6s lipos on the bottom. The bottom ones would all have their own little enclosures with lids, so that the batteries can be taken on and off the board. 

If that all looks to fail, I may just stick them in the middle like the guys with bindings.. even though that for me is the last resort.

To answer all your Questions:
50A x 44v =2200W. 
Peak performance is roughly 2800W.
All motors you find on the market are usually rated "peak performance", not continuous.
The temperature at which you ride the board does also play a major role. In Siberia you will get a better performance than riding in the Sahara. Tarmac gets very hot in summer, even in northern countries.

You will not use that amount of power continuously, so its well balanced. Using a dual Setup releases 50% of the strain.
Using temp control, which will be implemented into BLDC-Tool soon, will avoid any motor or controller overheating.
Pushing the 200Kg up a steep hill on a single is something you should never do! But: The temp control saved the VESC and motor from being fried. It works very well.
Please make sure you drop in realistic values into BLDC-Tool + use a fuse between the Battery and Controller. We use 40-50A fuses, but that depends on the capability of your battery. Never trust the C-Rating printed onto cheap Lipo Packs. I would deduct quite a lot to be within the safe region.

Battery position: Please keep in mind that the deck is capable of tilting 30deg! Your section drawing is nice, but does not consider the lean. The decks edges do get very close to the ground when carving hard.
A stiffer deck does not help in that case. Please choose the deck according to your weight, rather than speculated ground clearance.
We put the Battery onto the rear tip to avoid any chance of ground contact. You know what will happen if you damage the cells by impacts! 
When you ride the board you will be amazed by its performance and ride comfort. You will not think about your battery mounted somewhere else than under the deck while riding, believe me.

Glad to see other people going for the hard carve. I use my board for burning my legs out maxing snow board like turns  in my neighborhood.
 Now to the point.  I purchased a used E-glide GS and modified it to carve much harder. Maybe these mods will help with your set up. 
All of these mods can be done with the trampa, especially if you mount battery on the top. For on road riding you really don't need that much clearance. 
 1. Lowered board by extending the nose and tail with aluminum plates to mount trucks higher up relative to the deck to lower the CG.  This is major.....
I had remove the front aluminum plate to raise the front after I got a new mbs truck that is lower than old model  because it the  made battery box  too low.  At some point I want to get slimmer batteries and box  to drop another inch or so. 
2. Decanted back truck with washers as experiment and never changed it. This really helps the board follow through turns with out the rear spinning out.  Decanting allows for good lean angle with less turn from the truck. You can do this with both trucks for higher speed turns. I think my board is tuned for max lean and carve at about 12mph. 
3. Removed the springs in the front truck, so board is really loose and I can dig the nose in for tighter turns, like on a snow board. 
 4. Added the Cheng Shins that fit the mbs tri-spoke hubs. I was blowing through mbs and rounded street tires in a few sessions. I never go in a straight line. These wide flat Cheng Shins grip like hell and last forever.    Cheng Shin 8 X 3.00-4
Batteries are cheap and you are not going for stealth transport vehicle, so who cares if the tires are not that efficient. 
I think I will add some foot straps next for a little more security when Im leaned in hard.

Trampa's battery box (pictured below) doesn't include a place for an ESC, so that issue remains. My current thinking is to mount the at least the VESC and receiver where the Trampa battery box is mounted. I'll figure out where to mount the batteries later, but, inspired by Boosted, if I mount the batteries in some place other than the rear, I'll likely run power to the VESC via [flat, braided wire](http://www.mcmaster.com/#69925K65), insulated with [Kapton](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N1RHE2Q/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_g7gzxb38RW287), and taped to the bottom of the deck. 

Thoughts, gents?

Nice to see our boards arriving so fast. We do our best to deliver fast. Thats waht you guys want, don't you?
I would reverse the hangers if you custom build your mount. This way you get a lot more wheelbase and space for your feet. Just take out the springs, release the kingpin and turn around the hanger 180°. Thats how we ride our MTBs.
Hangers in MTB position will let you be able to mount the springs in the inner position when using the 7" tires. You can also try to mount the spings in outer position (rear) and inner position (front), or vice versa. Just try waht is best for you.

Nice! Did you realize that our pulley is not symmetric. The center ring, having the bolt holes in, is not located in the center of the teethed pully surface . One side measures 7.75mm, the other 8.75mm (edge of pulley to surface of center ring). This way you can offset the pulley 2mm further in or out, depending on your built and used spacers. We use 17mm long M4 hex spacers to space off the pulley.

Yep, I've spaced them out equally on each wheel. I'm using a 15mm belt which is narrower than the pulley, so a mm left or right won't affect the performance. 

But I did make sure to orientate each pulley the same way for the two wheels.

Shaft is 20mm long. I hope the milling works out!

OK, so that's .8 inches, giving me roughly 1/3 of an inch hanging out. If I mill out another 1/3 inch that should be plenty.

Appreciate the quick replies!!

Hi cmatson, can you still tilt the board to the max? Your mounts look a bit to high. 
Regarding the pulley width: A 15mm belt requires a 20- 21mm wide pully, since the belt will swim a bit sideways. Best way forward regarding the pulley is a long axle shaft. 
With your machine you should be able to mill the flat spots at the very end, where the motor can interlocks with the axle shaft. I would use a support bearing to protect motor bearing from wearing out.

Just measured the *usable* shaft space (circlip) and it is 24.85mm.

Will be finishing the whole thing up tomorrow! Still need to pick up some waterproof boxes similar to @barajabali's. 

I went ahead and wired it up, and everything is working, but don't want to show anything else until it is actually finished!

definitely the most fun board thus far, and am dying to finish it!!

nothing beats shooting through dirt, grass, and crap sidewalks without giving two flips.

Kinda wishing I had footbindings at some points (I've slipped off it a few times when the backend has gone out on loose dirt/thin grass), but nothing beats just being able to hop on it and carve like a normal board. 

 The biggest shout out goes to @barajabali for helping me out the most throughout this build, and you can bet his sticker is going front and center when I finish those waterproof boxes!

My pleasure man this board is a monster! I was gonna let you know that bindings would make a world of a difference. 

If you've want the "get on and go" just get foot straps no heel straps. I think heel straps are great for complete off-road.

Hi @cmatson any updates on your  urban carver.....any pics with the enclosures?

How does  the trampa board iand trucks compare to your previous longboard builds?

Cheers :slight_smile:

Currently it's taken on the same form- no enclosures yet, but I may try and pick some up this Thanksgiving break.  

Haha only addition has been lights!

Thanks for the update @cmatson. Nice lights and hope the enclosure work goes well. 

Would be interesting too see if anyone ever gets to mount under the trampa board where there is more room with the 7" wheels (if you are not off roading) though appreciate maybe tricky.

I'm eyeing up the urban carver board/ trucks and 7" wheels but more for relaxed cruising and carving on my local town streets and cycle paths. Particularly like all the options with spings and dampners.

Do you think this board could work similar to a typical **flexible** longboard i.e.  boosted or bamboo gt.........or is it more focused as a sports mountain board.? I'm not interested in extreme off road or tight cornering.....maybe if I was  a bit younger :smile:

I think it's perfect for a city cruiser- the 7inch street tires allow you to get over those cracks that would possibly lead to a fall on a street board, and it is plenty stable.  

Infact, I'd say 90% of my riding thus far has been on the road, and I rarely take it onto trails like some of the other guys with mountain boards.  

For me, this is the perfect all around board to conquer everything, in a form factor that isn't crazy like a maxed out @barajabali build with foot straps, huge battery, etc etc.

Its also my prefered board. I have all the options.... Nothing beats the Urban Carve when you are looking for an allrounder. Small, turns on a dime, stable at speed, trail capable and pot holes don't matter. You will love it even more having bindings. They fit! Especially on trails it makes all the difference. This a street Carve with bindings. 
Designed for insane downhill action.....

May have to just pick up some foot straps for kicks..  I do like the ability to just hop on the board without having to lock in, so I may just go with a simple style of bindings.  

We'll see how I feel after riding around on the beach next time I can get out there

@cmatson 

Hi! So have you upgraded your board with the bindings? If you did.. did you notice the difference?

I got a debate with a friend of mine are bindings needed in a city landscape.. and I just tried to convince him that with bindings it is more comfortable and enjoyable to handle the jumps and other instability you may encounter on the road.. 

So yeah, he has not tried a board with bindings and he is afraid that if he falls that he might be too strapped into the board to just run out the accident (if a complete stop happens)..

Hard to convince him :D though I said it would be hard to travel through many potholes or in a forest - hard packed trail if there are any bumps and you have to stand on your board the whole time.. (without jumping off and just running off the speed)

I haven't added bindings, and don't mind it at all- that said, I've never ridden a true mountain board with bindings, and this is Trampa's urban carver. 

To me, this is kinda like an evolve GT- not full offroad, but the pneumatics allow you to do a little off the normal routine rides, and eliminate cracks that plague normal wheels.

attempted to act like @Nowind and slide all over the place; didn't really work out, but was fun given this was my first attempt at **any** sort of sliding.

At first I tried standing up, but fell hard a couple times because I don't have bindings, and the balancing through the slide is pretty difficult when your feet can move, not gonna lie. 

so I changed to some "downhill" style sliding which resulted in less hard falls and more rolls...

anybody seen this before? the flange on my 15t aluminum pulley got ripped off after a stick (or something else, not sure exactly what stopped it up) got wedged in between the belt and motor pulley causing it to lock up. 

Unfortunately it also stretched out my belt a ton in the incident and riding home without the flange caused the belt to rub the tire further ripping it up.. here you can see the flangeless pulley side vs. the still intact side:

so while I am waiting on Dexter's urban carver mounts and saving up to completely rebuilt my Trampa with a slim pack from @barajabali , I decided to take the time to improve my dying mount. 

The last update showed a ton of wear on the aluminum pulleys (and I broke one of them), so now I've got some steal.

I also went ahead and milled down the spot for the motor as to have more motor shaft exposed through the 1/2 inch thick aluminum. 

Lastly, the previous mount was held on by L brackets from the bottom plate: this worked for a couple hundred miles, but because looser and looser over time (just from excess play, nothing that could be tightened) so eventually my mounts could just wiggle all over the place- they continued to function, but I could hear the mounts in the rear bounce up and down about a 1/3 of an inch as I was going off road. 

I put two nuts/bolts on each side creating essentially set screws (and dremeled flat spots in the truck for them to have somewhere flat to bite), and now it is completely firm as it once was at in its early days- we shall see how they hold up.. 

more updates to come
