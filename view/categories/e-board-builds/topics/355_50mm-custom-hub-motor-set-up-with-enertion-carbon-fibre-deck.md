these are my custom 50mm hub motors with slim carbon fibre longboard deck from enertionboards.com,

the whole setup weighs 6.3KG has a top speed of 40KM/H and a range of 15KM.
the motor have been upgraded from the last setup with upgraded magnets and better quality machining.

very nice.
I have always been a fan of your hub motors. 
so neat.

Looks awesome! So whats the situation on selling them? The ES thread just ends in June with a hanging question about the status.

The situation is money! I need to order at least 500 to get costs down. so we are looking at $50,000 to get started I don't have that laying around atm.

Understandable. I'd be interested in a couple at the (Dec 2014) estimate of $100 - $130 per motor, if another run like that happened. 500 is certainly tough to hit, though, I'm sure. Good luck!

Hello every one, I wanted more hub motors for personal use so I have placed an order for 20x of my 63mm hub motors.
They are based on the 6355 motor that enertion sell and will have the same high quality stator and winding with my magnet upgrades.

https://youtu.be/KoS3JEfzYEI

The motors will also come with a 83mm wheel on the motor. 

The great thing is I will be selling them for $299 for a pair. They have great power and save you a lot on your build while looking so much better.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/5ee2d8a0a4fb606287d0e4fe4c221c85607266dd.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Please every one let me know your interest, there are only 8 sets up for grabs as I need to keep 2 for myself. If I need to order more I can do that.

Shipping date 11th of Jan

What kind of speed could you get on these running 36 volts?
What kind of inclines could it climb? They look really clean and nice.

no offence meant to carveon but these look so much beter than carveon.

the motors actually fit within the wheel and arent poking out the sides, and they have a more finished appearance.
Im a DIY guy. I like to do EVERYTHING myself. I won't buy a product if I believe I can make something myself that is on par.
the carveon motors look like something I could knock up in my shed with a couple of SK3's. 
the fact that I have expressed  interest in buying a set speaks for itself really.

The difference is these can be adapted into any truck axel, meaning you just slide it on to the axel then tighten the nut so you can use caliber Paris bear randle monkey surf rods and any I have missed. 

The wheels can be removed by removing one of the caps on the side of the motor and it slides off and then back on,

The urethane looks much thinner than the carvon?   Is it user-replaceable?  Will you be able to sell replacement wheel for the hub motor?

yes i can sell more wheels i have ordered 100 of them, the urethan is thinner as it is a 83mm wheel he has 90 and 97mm wheels, the bigger wheels mean more torque is required to turn them

You have any comparison on the torque with your 50mm or 63mm hub builds compared to a 63mm R-spec belted drive set up? 
I'm a big boy so I'm thinking two powerful hubs or possibly 4x4 config. Just weight and range is a concern but with lots of torque available and less drag than belted system my mind starts thinking.....HMMMMM?
4x4 BUT wondering if a set up can be worked out to be like a multi cylinder shut down system in a car. 4 motors to get up to speed, then 2 or 1 wheel drive to get great range on level ground.

Any possibility of this programing gurus or am I thinking too far outside the box?

I'm 95kg i can ride both but the 63mm motors are more efficient, I say hub motors have 1/3 less torque less then a belt drive, 

If you do a 4 wheel drive then you don't need to change how many wheels are driving as if it takes you 1000w to get up a hill you will only use 1000w if you need 300w on the flat it will be the same but your motor will run cooler and then more efficient and then they actually have less wasted power on heat so you might actually have better range on 4wd but the extra weight of the motor will even this out.

I have a customer doing a 4wd hub motors with 107mm wheels.

@jacobbloy I get the ultimate power requirements as far as total amount of power required to do work i.e. get me up a hill, (High School physics flashback). There was an interesting dual hub motor bicycle that I was watching online where they set up separate controls for F&R for uphill traction and they were discussing better range using only one motor and when climbing a steep hill a burst of power from the added front motor was great. My concern was the constant drain from multiple motors as most here post they get little better range from single drives using same power packs. I know dual belts have more loss than single but does that make up for all the difference? Hubs are supposed to be more efficient so selectable drive efficency that's my thoughts.
I'm 130kg and 6'6" my son's 60kg using his BBD+ testing using "My Tracks" GPS logger got us the following results:
I went  6.7km, Avg speed 18km/h with a Top speed of 35km/h.
He went 8.9km, Avg speed 26km/h with a Top speed of 44km/h.
SO the BBD+ is not slouch with weight on it (their specs on speed are accurate). The board is fairly light and great for my kids use at school but range is limited with me.
SO for now I got a Raptor on order for work/commuting/kids hopefully it will be able to keep me up with junior and get me the range I need in the city for my work travels. 
My heart is looking a MTB with Hub motors for fun and blasting around NYC with little concern for the potholes and the gravel filled roads at home in NJ. I just really like the clean look of hubs and think the larger diameter +air ride of a MTB wheel with a hub would have great torque & be low maintenance.

onloop has got a hub motor setup arm with 2 big hover board motors, I riad it it's got speed and can go up sloped curbs and over gras, but it's heaven, I can make you a hub motor out of big 120mm motors or 100mm motor or even 80mm motors!

Depends on your requirements or power wants.

how do the hub motors fair on starting from a standstill? Are they a bit jerky and need a push or are they smooth?
I am also interested in getting a pair

it all depends on the setting my next batch will have sensors and that will help with starting, the vesc jolts until it has found the bite point of the motor, sensors will minimise this.

sadly I'm not doing another run of my motors until get all the feed back i can from my last customers
