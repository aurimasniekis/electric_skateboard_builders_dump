Hi guys! As title says I am going to make a fiberglass enclosure for my spud build. Currently I am using a 3D printed enclosure which is fine but since I designed slightly smaller I need to reprint a new one so why not try with this method this time. I am ordering everything from https://polyestershoppen.nl only because I am in Belgium and so far this one was the cheapest option, but if you know another cheaper source please share it!
Materials:
-Polyester lamin resin https://polyestershoppen.nl/polyester/polyester-lamineerhars-1.html
I chose this one over epoxy just because it is way cheaper. (I will order 1kg, I think should be more than enough).
-Fiberglass Matt 225g/m2 https://polyestershoppen.nl/glasvezel/glasmat-225-gr-m2-45.html
I could also choose a 300g/m2, the price is the same. It will give a thicker layer after lamination but I see most of the people are using 220g, that's why my choice. (2 m2 should be enough).
Then some brushes and that's it. I am going to print the mold with some cheap PLA, then wrap both board and mold with tape. To ensure a nicer finishing look I will use the ghetto vacuuming mod @ninja. 
Do you think it is ok? My concerns about it:
1- How many layers do I need? I was thinking at 5 layers. It should result in 2.5mm thickness.
2-Do I need something else over the last layer of fiberglass before I use the vacuum bag. Will the enclosure stick to the vacuum bag.

Feel free to add your tips!
Thanks to everyone. I will keep updated this thread during the procedure.

5 layers are enough :) 

I am not sure what is the ghetto mod, but I usually use peel ply and breather cloth to remove excess resin :)

Sorry! That's the ghetto procedure http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-make-glass-fibre-enclosure-without-vacuum/17197/20?u=rey8801.
On the website I posted unfortunately there is no ply sheet and breather cloth. I found the ply on other website but where or how do you call the breather cloth online? I can't find it. SO basically after the fabricglass layers + resin I will add on top ply and then the breather cloth (both w/o resin). Is it the correct order? Thx

I probably founf it on the website:
ply sheet https://polyestershoppen.nl/hulpmaterialen/scheurweefsel-314.html
Breather cloth https://polyestershoppen.nl/vacuummaterialen/bleeder-417.html

These additional materials raise the price to almost the double. Do you know a better website where to other all the material in EU?

There are ways to make it cheaper :/ I read somewhere that you can replace breather somehow (with pregamen paper or something, IDK what it is?)

I have some rests of breather and peel ply at home I could send you...the only problem is that IDK when I get home again :/ I am studying in different city...maybe the weekend, or the next one for sure :/ I am from the Czech Republic, if you would pay the shipping it would be ok :) 

I am not completly sure if it is necessary :/ You will for sure get better results with it, but try to google if there are any cheaper substitues...

You can always go to local stores to look for materials. Sometimes that is easily forgotten on this online-shopping-era.

But hijacking the thread a little; How many layers you recommend when making complete board out of fiberglass? I'm going to fill it with sturdy foam.

I have never made one :/ 

I have an idea how much you would need but I am really not sure :/ If I were using carbon I would use 300gsm uni and biax layers on both sides :) With fibreglass you will have to use more :) Maybe 600gsm could be enough? Depends on the core also...

Thanks for your super nice offer. I really appreciate it. I will frist try to find it in another way so you can save your material :smile:
Anyhow could you explain me the layers order of ply sheet and breather cloth? IS it correct what I assumed in the previous post? "after the fiberglass layers + resin, I will add on top ply and then the breather cloth (both w/o resin)" Thx a lot!

1.bag
2.breather
3. peel ply
4. fibreglass with resin
5. mold
6. bag

This is the layering :slight_smile:
You dont add resin too ply sheet and breather, because breathers purpose is to take all the excess resin...and ply seperates it from the fibreglass and allows you to remove the breather easily :)

I was making the shopping list but I am not sure about which fiberglass to go. Would you suggest this cheaper glass fiber https://polyestershoppen.nl/glasvezel/glasmat-225-gr-m2-45.html1 or the bit more expensive https://polyestershoppen.nl/glasvezel/glasweefsel-200-gr-m2-54.html? Thx

Ok the difference is, that woven cloth will give you bit more strength, but it is easier to get nice finish and clean corners with mat :) as far as I know it is easier to work with mat, so its better for begginers :)

You mean the one for store food? Then since my mold is in PLA plastic it is probably already fine.

Little update. Yesterday I went for my first attempt. Resulting in a lot of shit...and being interrupted by the neighbors who were thinking there was a gas leak when it was the resin smell! This thing smells a lot... I feel really bad for them. I was in the garage with direct air flow from outside but it's not completely isolated from the rest of the building and they got scared. Last time I do it there! So it ended up with me in a hurry to finish everything :smile:
I went for the ghetto vacuum style (vacuum bag plus vacuum cleaner) and I thought it will be a total failure...
This evening I open it up and surprise I think is not so bad even at the back when the shape it's a bit tricky due to the space for the motor wires. 
![IMG_20180517_192939|690x388](upload://aCVki34CGBDSPopDj6V4k3XuaKa.jpg)!
![IMG_20180517_192920|690x388](upload://jPtVHvLVg9rfsgWS9Uqw9e2K5iE.jpg)

Of corse didn't come out perfect and in the front there are two major issues:
- the corners being not be completely sealed
![IMG_20180517_192926|690x388](upload://MPYbQSngUArILSEVUf4IjpZexP.jpg)
There is some small holes. 

- the front edge being lifted during the drying part resulting in a concave shape.
![IMG_20180517_192933|690x388](upload://fCryslcDfRmjqDkVzepdWpbLvhm.jpg)![IMG_20180517_193134|690x388](upload://7I4Pyo8AXjPILIEI251yL8GbZF3.jpg)

Now what do to? I think for the corners I can had more layers of fiberglass and resin.
Differently for the front edge I do not if it's better fill it up from the bottom and than sand it on top or what.
As usual, thanks for the help!

Edit: didn't upload all the pictures.

It looks very brittle. The white areas are bubbles of air(not good) and the flange which will be the area under most pressure looks very dry with no resin.
You can add extra layers of mat but I would start again, you're just locking air and weak layers.
You want it to look like the area on the deepest part of your enclosure where it is a solid colour with no white bubbles or dry spots.
Probably not the answer you are looking for.

Thx for the reply. It's my first time so all the suggestions are welcome. The thing is that I pressed the surface with a roll at every layer so I am not sure I can do better next time. The top part is the one came out on since it is the one more compressed by the vacuum bag. Do you have a trick to do get rid of the air bubbles?

Here is a quick basic video, if you search on a similar track you should come up with a more info than you ever need!
I use a fluffy roller to wet out my mat first then use an mashing roller until all air has been expelled.
It is more difficult in the corners and if you are using woven fabric it can also get tricky!

Thats pretty light mat, it should be easy to work with and not get bubbles. The heavier the mat, the more difficult it is to get to lay nicely into intricate shapes. All about a bit of practice!
Do you wear a mask when you use the resin and glass? I use these.

Yes I used a mask with small filter but less protective than the one you showed. Anyhow I didn't definitely press so firm on the layers during lamination. Although I see that procedure really difficult to do it with the shape of my enclosure and at the edges. I knew it making a fiber glass enclosure it's a art, but it's really difficult do make it right.

I've seen your 3D printed spud enclosure, you know how to model and obviously know how to use a 3D printer fair enough to be able to print ABS. This whole vacuum forming/molding technique has always seem very messy to me, plus all the very toxic fumes involved, and a lot more money in mats vs 3D printing mats, and not forgetting you lose all the detail of a nicely printed enclosure when you make a mold. All of this trade off just to use a slightly stronger structural material like fiberglass or carbon fiber.

It feels like people do the molds when they feel 3D printed parts are not strong enough. But the truth is most people don't own 3D printers and from the few that do, most don't know enough to make proper prints with ABS (poor layer adhesion, warping, etc). But we have so much more. We have PETG, Polycarbons, Nylon, etc.

The best kept secret is cheap basic PLA, annealed in water @ 70 C for 30 mins. Annealed PLA is 40% stronger and more heat resistant than both ABS and PETG. Why water? It will heat up evenly and not warp, do not bake it, that is what causes warping. The only drawback is still dimension change of around 3-4% but that is fine for an enclosure.

Now, take that resin you bought and give the print a coat. You just made it waterproof and increased impact resistance. You can even sand it down after that and paint it if you want.

Thanks for all the inputs. I agree 3D printing is awesome and I printed other parts of the skate too. For the enclosure I went for PETG and I liked the result. That been said for the first time printing PETG and now I know how to do it better but basically I had problem with clogged nozzle during the print and I had stop it clean the nozzle and resume it. It affected the layer adhesion in some spots. The enclosure was strong and flexible enough to work fine for almost one month and half, then in the previous mentioned spots I saw initial cracks. I could reprinted better but I wanted to try the fiberglass why and use my 3D enclosure as mold. The process of fairly easy, but it takes a lot of time and patience. I definitely learnt a lot. The final result is rock solid but heavy as wel in my case compare my printed enclosure.

You can see more pics it in my build log. I also though about reinforce the 3D printed enclosure with fiberglass but honestly I wanted to give it a try. Of course you have to invest money in it. I spent 30 Euro for the material but I printed out the tools I didn't have it and to get the final perfect surface I should have spent  10-15 Euro more. I simply didn't know before. I can always fix the one I made.

You can check out an example of the water annealing process [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmTGU3r53VU).

You are basically doing sous vide on the PLA part, heat up to 70C, put part in a zip bag partially open, and slowly put inside the pot. The pressure will take out all the air and then you can seal it. Let it cook for 30 min.

For the high temp PLA, annealing makes those even stronger. Like Raptor HT PLA, you may need to anneal a bit higher temperature. This one becomes super durable and food safe/dishwasher safe. They even market it as a industrial grade high impact material. The best part is it still prints super easy like any other PLA.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZX8eHC7fws&t=13s) are the strength results data. (note: test done with bake method)

In short, annealing PLA, specially in water, takes it to a whole new level. Super simple to print, and outclasses the durability of ABS and PETG. But it is still not perfect, PLA is still biodegradable and it still absorbs water, so for outdoor use (like an enclosure) you would need to seal it with something waterproof (waterproof wood glue/filler, or fiberglass resin).

Personally I plan to experiment a lot with annealing PLA for parts that don't need millimeter specific dimensions. But I also did order a Printbite+ mat, which I heard many people use successfully to print Nylon. My ultimate goal is to perfect Nylon printing for all sorts of industrial-grade parts.
