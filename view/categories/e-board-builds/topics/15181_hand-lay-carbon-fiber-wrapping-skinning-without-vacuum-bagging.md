Merry Christmas everyone!

My attempt here is to show the easiest and most inexpensive way to laminate/skin your favorite wooden deck with Carbon fiber cloth.

You will need:

*Wooden deck.
*A piece of CF cloth (carefully handling it)
*Black link or Epoxy pigment for the base coat.
*Epoxy resin with hardener( Bar Top Epoxy is recommended)
*Heat Gun/Hair Dryer ( removing air bubbles)
*Paint Brushes

Part one - Preparing your deck for skinning.

The surface of the deck has been sanded for the better bond.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/b/4b4fa05533ae0791e0a6e8fea934691a176c180d.jpg" width="281" height="500">

Hot glued the deck down on a box to prevent from tipping over when brushing.

Part 2 - Applying the base coat.

Black pigment has been added to the resin with the hardener and mixed it with the right ratio.

Applied evenly on the deck and get good coverage on it where the fabric goes to.

brushed it on the bottom of the deck as well.

Leave it for 5-7 hours; it depends on the room temperature until it's quite tacky. Just keep in mind that you do not let it cured completely.
The timing is very crucial at this point that the resin doesn't come off on your finger when you touch it, but it leaves the fingerprint.

Part 3 - Laying the fabric.
Carefully laying the fabric on top of the deck and start from in the middle, work way outward. This is very important at this point; you do not want to pull or push too hard because potentially distort your weave.

Trim it along the edge.

Part 4: applying the clear epoxy coat.
Give it a nice even coat all over; you can use the heat gun to avoid making air bubbles. It may not look perfect at the first coat, but that's fine.

Again wait for 5-7 hours, when it gets tacky, apply the second layer of epoxy before sanding and polishing.

THIS IS AWESOME! :grin:

Would a method like this work for making an enclosure for the deck as well? As in putting a mold on top of the deck while doing this and then cutting out the area around the enclosure part and using it as your box. Or would it be stuck too the deck too much to remove? I guess doing the corners of the enclosure would also be pretty hard by hand.

If you are using a mold, then you need to do vacuum bagging. This method is to apply it permanently to the parts.

 It works well with 3d printed enclosures.:smiley:

MasterCho - I've heard the heatgun trick before, but also one i'm trying to remember and maybe you can clarify?  When doing those final gel coats to get a clear bubble free finish over your CF.

Have you tried denatured alcohol in a sprayer to break some of the surface tension and help smooth the epoxy?  Maybe it was something besides DA?  

Merry Christmas everyone!

Wow @MasterCho . Thanks for the amazing in depth guide. I actually just ordered bamboo wood vertical grain from China for a few members of the Melbourne esk8 group. We were thinking fibreglass for flex but would carbon be better do you think?

Hello I see you have some experience in carbon fiber industry :wink:
I am wondering if it is possible to make a strong hollow longboard out of carbon fiber?
The longboard will have a frame in it so it will be a bit stronger.
Yes I am going to use vacuum bags with resin infusion. 

Thanks!

The second coat of resin has been applied. Now it should have enough thickness to work on.

Let it completely cured for 24 hours.

No, I haven't tried denatured alcohol yet. If you use Bar Top Epoxy, it should be bubble free. The imperfection you see when the first layer applied is some dirt from the fabric.

About that, its for the cover over so it will not bend, squize the battaries. But I think it will be fine without having nothing in the middle, and more place to battery.But its just for saftey etc ;)

I sanded one mm off the surface before applying one layer of cf (200g). The carbon fiber gives 0.2mm thickness plus resin thickness. Epoxy resin is pretty flexible, so I think the stiffness/weight is very minimal.

This deck has semi-flex(not bamboo) Once it's fully cured, I'll find out the difference.

The Easycomposites site has many good tutorial too on this topic and others.
If you were to lay CF on the other side of the board as sais by Plumb77, there would be an overlap of the fabric on the edges. Does this disappear or his hidden when you do the various layers of resin, sanding and polish?
```

Yes, the edge can be sanded to be hidden, but it's hard to apply resin to both sides at the same time. You might do one side at a time.

Would this method work if the carbon fiber was to be layered directly over foam core? 

Ex: Layering from top to bottom of deck.

Carbon fiber 
Plywood 
Foam core (Sanded and shaped to create a housing for the electronics)
Carbon fiber
```

I added two layers of Carbon Fiber to the top of an omen tango longboard. I did one layer on a Saturday and the second on Sunday. It added quite a bit of stiffness to the 46" board. Adding one layer on top didn't stiffen it as much as I would like so I added a second layer. I did it so I wouldn't damage my 12s3p battery and didn't want to cover up the bottom. We've been handlaying Carbon Fiber and Carbon Kevlar for years in our rc boats for strength. I'm not discounting any advice given here or anyone's way of doing things. Just saying it can be done without the added expense of vacuum bagging. Especially if you don't already have the equipment and experience. Great job btw MasterCho as always.

So I did this...

And it ended BEAUTIFUL! Thanks @MasterCho

I did exactly what you said
Base coat 
Lay carbon fiber
Clear coat
Clear coat 

I did it on an old loaded vangaurd board
Then WET sanded from 125 grit,220,340,400,800,1000,1500,2000 grit and finally I buffed it to s shine. I distorted the weave a little but it's okay it'll be hidden. The edges kinda fucked up so I sanded them off and I'm gonna paint the sides black. After I do wire channels I'm gonna grip the top and use different trucks to match the board. 3d printed enclosures also expoxied and sanded and painted

I did it for many reasons actually. The vangaurd was way too flexy and this actually helped make it perfect for my riding preferences.  Still has a lot of flex in it. Also this deck has been through many different setups and It cost like $200 so I didn't want to toss it. It had holes like Swiss cheese! So it gave me an opportunity to make it brand new :) 

Thanks for the kind words

Awesome job with this project! :heart_eyes:

I need your opinion regarding this method, guys. Here's my question: If I were to cut out a huge recess for batteries, BMS and VESCs in the middle of the road side of a 9ply, 14mm maple deck, how deep could I make the recess?, i.e. how thin would it be possible to get the wood without subsequently braking it when ridden, if I were to do 3 layers of carbon on top and 3 on the roadside using this method?

Please tell me if I've made myself clear here :) Thanks for help!

[quote="paulus_germanus, post:57, topic:15181"]
how thin would it be possible to get the wood without subsequently braking it when ridden, if I were to do 3 layers of carbon on top and 3 on the roadside using this method?
[/quote]


This is *the question* when you carve out a recess for your electronics.  Without stress testing and destructive analysis i don't know anyone here who can say with full authority.  

I know i carved out my double thick omen very very thin between the top and recess, but added 2 layers of 12k CF (heavy weight - don't recall exact), and did a couple more of the typical CF 3k weave on the bottom - *FEELS* solid, but i also reinforced the edges w/ angle CF tube...  overkill i expect.  

You can carve it out, do a layer top/bottom and step on it gradually to see if it bends - and keep adding until it feels solid...  

There are super smart folks here, perhaps one has a better method?

I see. Thank you for the answer, it certainly did help to answer most of my questions. Were you doing yours CF layering using the method mentioned in this thread or some other? Are there some pics of it here on the forum? (if so I'd love a link ;)) What kind of resin were you using?

I'm sorry for question-flooding but there are just so many variables for a noob like me here - I do as much reading as I can but still I'm in a constantly exacerbating state of confusion ever since I started to work on my esk8 project, and you're one of those rare patches of light one naturally clings to in such situations ;)

I was looking for some pics to show you @paulus_germanus, but you found the thread with most of those.

Yeah, i did clean up some of the edges - next on that project is sinking my magnets into holes w/ epoxy, thin gasket neoprene around edge and a couple mechanical fasteners.  Goal is quick access w/o tools to swap batteries for extended range.  Carrying spare batteries in the bag easily vs a heavy board.  I have two sets of 4500 and 5000mAh thin lipos intended for this.  The height of the front cover is intended to handle a pair of much bigger batteries for long range flats!

Just rebuilt my GF's board (my old 42 Vanguard Flex 1), with 6374 190kv, and 9mm to 15mm setup - much much better now.  A bit too powerful/fast for her on 8s, so might swap in dual 3s=6s for her, and i'll ride it on 8s or more.  I need to finally finish the enclosures for it though...

Ohhh this is to cool to resist doing! Nice one @MasterCho 

But Im curious of one thing - How would I go forward if I wanted to wrap the whole board, both sides.
Where would I make the break? or would I wrap it over and sand it down?

I also recommended this tutorial from Easycomposite: http://www.easycomposites.co.uk/#!/composites-tutorials/carbon-fibre-skinning-rifle-stock
I agree the difficulty is to lay resin on both sides in the same time

What do you think would be the best approach on the edge (left in pick) glue top and bottom fibre layers between them selves encasing the aluminium or having the aluminium layer show, thus being able to be wider

I thought I’ve heard in the past that some adhesives have trouble sticking to aluminium due to oxidation, but maybe if the strip isn’t right at the edge then there isn’t a problem, as the carbon fibre holds it in place?

I had a Lotus Elise before so I know a little bit about Aluminum bonding methods for racing cars that have aluminum chassis to save the weight of the car, the epoxy-based adhesive was used instead of bolts and nuts or being welded to save processing time to be built.

I've done quite a few tensile test with adhesives during university and the best method to get adhesives to stick on to aluminum was to increase surface roughness (best method was via sand blasting as it would almost dimple the surface) and then clean thoroughly with acetone to remove all potential grease/oils/dirt etc. When prepared properly we would get cohesive failures during traction testing, meaning that adhesive would fail by its self instead of detaching from the surface of the alloy. The images bellow illustrates what i mean (stolen from wikipedia)

Hand laying ends with imperfect surfaces, vacuum infusion requires less post skinning manual labor.

You'd need some consumables like the bagging and tubing, as well as a peel layer, infusion media and filter jacket, and resin. As well as non consumables like a resin trap, and a vacuum pump. 

There are some good YouTube videos on vacuum infusion if you decide to go that route.. which would be way to much to explain in a thread like this...

Like decky said, but an alternative to infusion would be wet layup vacuum bagging. That method is perhaps even more difficult than infusion, as there is a deadline for the bagging. @whitepony is, IMO, extremely proficient in the vacuum bagging process. You should check out his threads about it!

I recently picked up a deck I'd like to use for my build. It's really light, looks like 3 layers of wood and fiberglass on top and bottom. It has medium flex and I'd like it to have less.
Was thinking of doing a top later of Carbon fiber.
Would bottom be better? Or should I do both?
And is there a particular cloth that's best for my needs?

Carbon fiber is strong in its tinsel strength. As such, the effective way to use it is on the bottom of the deck. It won't do much for stiffness on the top

I posted a vid comment #41 I think. No pigment used. Black carbon fibre over a white base. No visible white after the first layer in this case. I used west systems ultra clear. For the sake of it if you are doing only one layer and need to make sure then just add the pigment imo.

My finish looked super shinning like this after applying the epoxy and anytime you apply a wet cloth to it, but when its dry it doesnt look shiny at all. I ended up using [this kit](https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/#!/starter-kits/carbon-fibre-skinning-starter-kit.html) which was awesome, but it just doesn't look polished.

Thoughts on what I can user to get it shinier?
