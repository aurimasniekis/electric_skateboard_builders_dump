Hi guys. Here's my third build. I just can't stop.. this addiction is becoming a problem. (well tbh this is my first build I'm redoing with a dual setup, but it still counts!) 

I went with dual, not because there's any hills or anything in Denmark that a single can't climb, but because my OCD was killing me with the asymmetrical engine.. lol..

My parts:
**Motor**: 2x Alien HEV 230Kv 6355
**ESC**: 2x Maytech VESC (not running FOC becuase the Alien's sound like beasts :sunglasses:) 
**Battery**: 2x 4s (8S) Turnigy Graphene 10000mAh LiPo
**Motor mount**: 2x Proto-Boards motor mount
**Gearing**: 15/36T from Alien Power Systems
**Trucks**: Caliber II 50Â°
**Wheels**: Orangatang Kegels in Orange
**Receiver**: Nano-X (when it eventually arrives..........)
**Deck**: Loaded Vanguard Flex 3
**Housing**: Custom 3D printed housing

I'll keep you posted with the progress :D

Man, I loved your build, in 8s will it go faster than 25 mph? I really wanted to see a Vanguard with Orangatang kegels, like boosted. But all boosted clones uses Abec 83mm... I really want pictures

Yes, it will go about 27mph (43km/h) :)

Here's the board with the motors already mounted.

The printer i used for this is the Afnibot A31. I'm planning on using my Ultimaker 2 Extended when the enclosures gets bumped up a lot, because the prints it makes are wayyyy more beautiful. (To be fair this was printed on low quality also) 

More progress! Got everything soldered together and testing has begun! Modified the VESC cap-board so it's parallel with the VESC itself. This makes it a lot shorter and perfect for my enclosure. I know there's a lot of connectors, but this is my temporary solution until I get the balls to make a groove in the deck for the cables. I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it yet, because I really like the stock look of the Vanguard.

## Build done! (for now)

The build is complete! First, some glorious pictures:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/8/98cfe3cc149ebb27424169b0d119925266f044f6.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/9/59378df070bc21bb4ebb4958ea7efe6aac3678ef.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/e/cee1a52961912d5b62a86d6036c21b410264068e.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/d/1df4472e23e926289a9f27fa42922e2590221e20.jpg" width="375" height="500">

I think it came out great. I only need my Nano-X, and then I'm rolling again! 

**Future plans**
The cable running underneath is only temporary, and will be removed when I eventually get the balls to make a groove in the deck.. I'm also waiting for @raphaelchang's Battman BMS, so I can get an e-switch as well as an easy charging solution. I'm also thinking of implementing a LCD display to show battery percentage, but that's not so important right now. Head- and taillights as well as RGB LED strips underneath will be added very soon. Also waiting for them to arrive. 

Currently I'm printing the [GT2B "Baby Buffalo"](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/gt2b-baby-buffalo-mod-case-3d-printable-thumb-throttle-case/4694) mod by @Qwiksand. That way I can get rolling very soon, before the Nano-X arrives. 

Can't wait to test the performance of this! I'll keep you posted! ;)

## Board update!! 

First of all, new name, since the board has been almost completely rebuilt. (Suggestions for names are appreciated! I might spraypaint the a logo and a name on the griptape!)

A short story: I was out riding on my newly completed board, riding slowly in the bike lane in a roundabout, when someone did not look around, and boom, I got hit by a car in the side. The person ran over the board with the car and destroyed the enclosures as well as making a lot of scratches and dents on the deck itself.. God damn, I just finished it!!!! :cry: I was up rolling on the hood of the car, and thank god I always wear helmet.. :neutral_face:

BUT! That didn't hold me back! I could then do with the deck what I wanted, as it probably needed replacement anyways.. That's why I started sanding it down. I did it on both sides, to get rid of the biggest dents and scratches, and by that I also removed the clear grip tape on the Vanguard. That made it a bit easier for cable-channel-grooving. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/c/bcc7c2d20689f1c9732911438d8d34909f8db3e5.jpg" width="666" height="500">

The result came out pretty good actually, and that's why I started making a groove for the cables. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/2/02f2d0d69eb8cf808ee2a9194834aa54b02fe9dd.jpg" width="666" height="500">

After that, I needed to print new enclosures obviously, and this time I printed them in normal quality instead of low. Looks like the printer could need a little tweaking, but otherwise the prints itself came out great! This print took 80 hours, and in the meantime my Nano-X arrived!! YAY!

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/4/74bea768face988199bfcaeb0359a5be229e6a3f.jpg" width="666" height="500">

I then applied black grip tape to hide the cables, and put it all together. And BAM!!!: 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/a/3a40a60eb9ec16932cfb4cc62fe7731b703ac675.JPG" width="666" height="500">

I really think it looks nice. No cables underneath!

Now I just need the lights and the BMS+Switch, and I'm all set!! Ah, one more thing. I got the BT board by @rpasichnyk and here's my first ride on revision 2.0! (Don't mind the route, I forgot to enable the GPS) :)

I stopped sanding when the print was almost gone, so there's still a faint pattern. On the underside I applied a clear coat, and on the top side I applied the grip tape and nothing else. :) It was pretty easy to sand it down when I used my electric sander.

## The probably-more-than-1000km-update!

Alright, here we go!
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/d/7dfd723ed3346dede5b08fe1c9bd290ffeb31359.jpg" width="690" height="460">

This board is so perfect for me, and it just got a lot better! I finally found a way to charge my batteries, without having a BMS, and still being able to balance charge. I also added an antispark switch (courtesy of @goldenHusky) as well as a LED button! I never have to take off the enclosures any longer! 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/5/15e26b4b0ad1809976da8369b98f5abe887bc93c.jpg" width="690" height="460">

The way I charge my batteries is that, first of all, I upgraded my charger to a 10s charger. Second, I added a XT90 as well as a VGA port for charging. In the left picture the covers for hiding/blacking out the connectors are on. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/1/911170c7e120d969b756c6aebf6d7814b025930d.jpg" width="690" height="460">

This makes me able to use the same charger and system for both my boards! The cable itself is still in a "beta" phase, I'm not exactly sure if I'll keep it as a single cable or split it into two.

I'm able to charge this board in about 1hr, and it goes more than 30km on a charge. Purrrfect.

@UniqueSnowflakeN27, It still runs like a baws, I even used it in the rain for a couple rides, and still works like a charm. I plan on upgrading the VESCâs to FOCBOXâes, and the motors to sensored, so I can get sensored FOC up and running. I also want to upgrade it to 12mm belts, since I break a lot of belts. I accelerate and brake intensely a lot.

I had one on my earlier revisions, but since I got my new antispark switch with LED support, which doesn't have a fuse, I haven't really been "wanting" it. I use the same argument as @goldenHusky, that I do not want the fuse to blow at the wrong moment.

thanks for your reply, and now i noob question haha

talking about the "main charge port". do you have to put "a loop key" in order to power on/off the board? or the BT drawed in the second picture is the power of/on button?

I charge with 1C, which is 10A. This charges the board in 1 hour! :D 
The extremely thin wire I used on the balancer cable won't be able to handle that. I can't find a 11 pin cable that can handle that. (That looks reasonable, and doesn't cost a kidney) And 11 pin since I also use the same cable to charge my 10S board. :)

@xBRAZILx I plug the "main charge port" and the "balancer port" into my charger. The anti-spark turns my board on and off. :) I just leave it off when charging, but works either way.

80 hour print?

you are a madman. props for the crazy ones.

mind sharing the printer settings? mainly interested in speed. I kind of missed, did you mention from what fillament you made the enclosures? and how thick are the walls?

I want to print my encosures as well :) just need to get the printer working reliably first... it fucks up a lot on long prints... the life of diy i suppose

@sid1 I just made my own cable with a VGA connector in one end, and a 10S JST-XH in the other end. Used some 20-24 (maybe more, havenât counted :laughing:) pin cable I had laying around. Inside the enclosure I also just used a VGA connector and made a 2x 4s (or 5s) to VGA solution. See pictures:

@xilw3r Iâm not entirely sure I remember the correct settings, but I think itâs 50mm/s, 0,1mm layer height, 230 degrees Celsius, printed with PLA.
The walls of the enclosures are 3mm thick. Could use another mm, because some of the screw holes started to crack because of the board flex.

Nice build!

I am thinking about using a similar VGA charging port for 10S battery in my next build.   

Do you use any fuse for charging?     I am worried that somebody could stick a metal object into the charging port and short the battery.  So a fuse for charging sounds like a good idea.

@sash I do not use a fuse for charging. I have 3D printed some caps for the connectors which seal them pretty good. You would also need a specific metal object to get anything inside a VGA connector, and even the XT90. I use the part of the XT90 with no exposed conductors in the enclosure which also makes it harder to short.

Note: the caps are a very tight fit, so if you don't like that, a 102-103% scale or something would probably be better.

# TIME FOR ANOTHER UPDATE!

This is gonna be a long post, so sit tight. ;) 

Alright, so continuing the consistent use I have once again used my board for many many kilometers. Then winter came, and I had to put my board to sleep, since winters in Denmark would completely ruin your board (salt, wet conditions, snow and so on). But now, the spring/summer season is coming, and I needed to make the board ready for that. Since I got my FOCBOX'es and never got to installing them, I thought this would be the perfect time to do that as well. **Commencing the refurb!**

First off, I took off the grip tape, since I wanted to regrip it. I also re-painted the trucks, sanded the deck, made the wire channel a little bigger, and applied clear coat to the deck for better weather resistance. 
![1|666x500](upload://a2Q4Hk4TUDmxyEjxZUVwe2GWo9r.jpeg)

Next up, I wanted to add lights to the front and back of the board, so I needed some extra wires in the wire channel, for the cleanest look possible. I'll then be able to control the lights from the Nano-X. 
![IMG_7826|666x500](upload://bWc1rlkeiAoz4fyJAIRMqHwU6kB.JPG)

The motors were getting pretty worn, so I changed the bearings, and repainted the cans. That got rid of the APS logo and now they look extra crispy. 
![IMG_1694|666x500](upload://cd9tApHwkvfVwKXyQ9iPo5w4KNf.JPG)

The motor mounts I used on this build did not have an option to get belt covers on, so I bought some BKB mounts (from @JLabs, designed by @JuniorPotato93, covers on Thingiverse also designed by the aforementioned) and they look amazing. Yes, I actually should be able to run dual 15mm, but for now I only upgraded it to 12mm. The pulleys were upgraded to 15mm though. (Damn that was expensive for some pieces of aluminium/metal...) Complete look: 
![IMG_7671|666x500](upload://tARD1DhcGhm4NLnftvce8ghbG1L.JPG)

Installing the FOCBOX'es instead of the Maytechs, fits perfectly with my existing enclosures. I still want to do a slimmer redesign though, since there's extra space in the height. 
![IMG_16947|666x500](upload://mQ31yBRb5XfPvlfsJwRFYNhDWnT.JPG)

I finally got a chance to make the two-tone griptape, and I think the result came out great! But then I needed to redo the logo and name, so back to the cutting board! 
![IMG_9808|666x500](upload://6F264tBRg1c0CGrUTI4JVBiSYUg.JPG)

## FINAL RESULT :heart_eyes:
Thanks for reading, here's some pics :smiley: 
Board now runs in FOC, and damn is it smooth!! 
![IMG_0411|666x500](upload://e7Qn4iDAqYlMErzq3EGgXdOBl5r.JPG)![IMG_1835|666x500](upload://pnUp23VDR1KO9FMu6H687piL7ll.jpg)![IMG_8647|666x500](upload://7ZwhRHzls3AG2uiWyzL6PnnhkZH.JPG)![IMG_9928|666x500](upload://eeDsCh7XD7nWG6bYTbG1Xef3XUL.JPG)![IMG_9994|666x500](upload://uQuUCVqtEgnI7OWVsNI1gnWv4qn.JPG)![IMG_1837|666x500](upload://nd2dlbO6guXyx6Dlk36KHSdVotO.jpg)![IMG_4368|666x500](upload://ojD7y1Fa8JkYy35uK6LfmDkqrzr.JPG)

Things I still need to do: 
:pushpin: Add the lights, since the wires are now in place.
:pushpin: Redo the charging solution, into one connector. 
:pushpin: New sensored motors. 
:pushpin: Redesign of the enclosures.

Benjamin Vedder designed the VESC for sensorless operation. As far as I know, that was his main goal. And I think he achieved it, quite well actually. So obviously, it's not much different in FOC. You don't need sensors to run FOC using a VESC. It will perform just as great. However sensors help, at least me. I notice less cogging on start up, my motors heat up less with sensors, and I just have an overall better experience.
Sensors sense the position of the rotor can in relation to the coils, so no matter how well the VESC was designed, they help, even if it's just the slightest bit.

Also, this is @fraannk 's build thread so let's stay on topic : )

# I LIKE UPDATES

So I never got around to install these sexy new sensored motors from @BoostedBuilder , but now's the time since I finally got my pulleys! 

New motors are approx. 186kv, so I installed 18t motor pulleys (combined with the existing 36t wheel pulley) to make my top speed 44km/h. I also printed a new battery enclosure as well as new motor covers to fit the new Caguamas. :heart_eyes:

![Board1|690x255](upload://a6mV2UqlSWwyt6gyQUfzqeh3443.jpeg)

![Board2|690x283](upload://pehYeO42ify29QV520AusXkmtFC.jpeg) 

I also installed a new, more robust button, and most importantly, I redid the entire charging solution. It is still a two connector design, but it is now much cleaner and much smaller. The cable used for this solution was also re-made from scratch. It is now a combined, soft cable that works really nicely. 

![Board6|690x344](upload://uP1aI9m4kR4Fs0Mte434obZnlxU.jpeg) 

Details such as red countersunk screw washers was added, all credits go to @Deckoz for the inspiration. 
Board now runs in sensored FOC and runs like a dream. It's safe to say, that I do not have any more upgrades/changes I want to do to this board. I only need a solution for lights, but that's not so important yet.

Thanks for following! :D
