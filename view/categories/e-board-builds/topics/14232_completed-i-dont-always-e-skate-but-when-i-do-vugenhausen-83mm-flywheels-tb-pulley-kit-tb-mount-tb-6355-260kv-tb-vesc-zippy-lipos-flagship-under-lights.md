This is going to be my final personal build for awhile.  I have really thought about this one a lot, including what I did & didn't like from previous builds.  

I am not really a fan of Caliber trucks, I ran Paris and Independent trucks for a lot of years, and these just feel a loose to me even with the bushing caps screwed down as far they can go.  That being said, there's nothing better when it comes to motor mounts, so that's what I got.

I've been working with cheap decks trying to see what I like, no skate shops within an hour of me.  Over thanksgiving in Gatlinburg I went by Zummies and got try out a couple of Arbor decks...holy street face Batman, they are freeking awesome.  So light and just flexy enough.  I bought an Arbor Vugenhausen for this build because its really comfortable, love the flex and the slight concave and micro drop really adds to the control-ability.  

I've actually purchased enough product from DIY Electric Skateboards (TB) and Miami Electric Boards to build another with the parts I all ready have, but I am saving them for my Ai13 (aluminum deck) build.  More info to come on it when I get it back from the welder.

Lastly, I included EVERYTHING on this build log, including wire, connectors, balance splitter/extension...everything.  I wanted people to see the factual cost of a build including shipping, incidentals & supplies.  Some of the components I bought from individuals for less than the listed cost, but I plugged in the cost of purchase now to give an accurate picture of the total cost.

Anyways, the parts are listed below.  Diagrams and pics forthcoming in a couple of days.  Wish me luck :slight_smile:

After the build...  Holy crap this thing is beautiful.  

The ride is so freeking lush, carves like a demon, perfect size deck, very strong motor, the VESC is a beautiful thing all on its own, it will easily do 20mph, starts from a dead stop, brakes are great, can't accurately describe how great this board is.

The only thing its is lacking is the controller, and its not really bad, I just got spoiled with my kids benchwheel (what I was riding while I built this one) and that remote is just about unbeatable.  Ill be swapping it out with a benchwheel remote when it gets here.

I was short some threaded inserts, going to pick some up tonight.  Ill get the rest in and permanently mount the enclosure.  I hate that @psychotiller isn't making these anymore.
 
I am really digging the under-lights.  Makes the entire thing look mean :).  I also took apart a bike GoPro mount and put the top piece on the deck so I could mount my GoPro whenever I wanted to record a ride.

Here come the pics...

Great job posting all the links with prices.  I must admit I am slightly nervous to tally up all my Amazon/HobbyKing/eBay purchases.  Those late night orders add up quick! :blush:


Some thoughts...

- I really like the M60 3-pole connector, but I'm not sure the current rating is high enough for us.  Some claim it's only rated for ~35A

- That MEB charging port adapter makes me nervous.  I know you're not running tons of current while charging, but I just don't trust the VGA port for both charging and balancing.  I'd prefer to split it into two connectors: VGA for balance wires only and XT-90 or XT-60 for main power leads.  This also would only cost a few dollars, instead of $20 with shipping.   But since they are selling it, I assume it must work!

- Lastly ,I'd recommend 10AWG wire if you haven't already purchased 12AWG

@jmasta On the MT60's you might be right.  I've never used them, but they look cool so I figured I'd give it a try.  On the MEB VGA charging port, I have to say its awesome.  This is my second one and the quality is great.  he has the positive and negative leads spread across multiple pins, it will actually support a lot more current than the 4amps I use.  I've already bought the 12awg silicon wire, but I dont use it for battery leads, I usually use copper for that.  I  don't really like the silicon, but its really bendy so easy to fit in an enclosure.

Examples of LiFePO4 are the cylindrical A123 cells found in Boosted Boards

Yeah, I had to change that out.  The LiFePO4 batteries were DOA.  I got 8000mAh 3s x2 as replacement.  I changed it in the parts list, just not the title.

I got it out together enough to take a test ride through the warehouse. I was going 20mph before I new it.  The acceleration is so smooth with the VESC and the Arbor deck is incredible.  I'll post pics tomorrow after I get some more threaded inserts and get the enclosure completely mounted.

```
You should read the values before you make the screenshots. Because the values in the screenshots are empty. 

And for the ppm signal it seems that pulse-width values are not correct. Just heck which values you get in the display window when you do a full throttle and full brake. You should try to get the pulse-width to 50% when the trigger is in idle and to get 100% when the trigger is nearly at full throttle and full brake. Mostly it's a bit difficult because the difference between full throttle and full brake is mostly not the idle value. 
You can also try my firmware if you want to use all the trigger range in both directions because there you can adjust the center position.

```
I would set the following
the battery cutoff start to 21,6 (3,6 a cell)
the battery cutoff end to 20,4 (3,4 a cell)

the integrator limit of 77 seems a bit strange. It could be correct but please do a motor detection again and then press the apply button and don't change the values anymore. Because if motor detection found 77 then the apply button will enter 75 as integrator limit. So please save the 75 if that is the case.

And if you want more power in watt mode you can set the max watts to 1332 watts.
Because (3,7V (volt of a cell under load) * 6S (cells in series) * 60A (batter my amps) = 1332 Watt)

And please check the minimum and maximu pulsewith if these are really the minimum and maximum values in that you can see in the display box when you fully brake and accelerate with the remote.

I don't know about the integrator limit, that's just what I got when I did the motor detection.  Ill do it again and let you know.  What would you expect to see?  

I will set the max watts too, that was where I was confused.

The min and max pulse width are correct.  I used the display to determine the MAX and MIN and set the values accordingly.

@Ackmaniac Done.  Honestly I cant really tell the difference in power from 1000 to 1332, but I haven really ridden it a lot either, since the config changes.

Anyways, you wanted some video of the app running and recording, so here you go.  Its not much, just a ride around the parking lot.  Let me know if I can do anything to help.

Its UPGRADE time!

Im going with dual Touqueboard 6355 190kv motors using MEB VESCs.  

I have a DIY 190kv from a previous build plus a new one on order.  DIY is out of stock on VESCs right now, I already had an extra MEB VESC, so I just ordered another one.  I'll swap the DIY VESC and the batteries out into another build I am working on..  

I've got a Space Cell Pro enclosure that I bought just because they were on sale, gonna use that as well.  I've got a 10s3p battery from the group buy coming, to go in in the Space Cell.

I am going to strip the board and remove the existing threaded inserts.  The existing inserts are brass, most broke during installation, so I don't trust them.  I'll fill the holes with wood putty & sand and the install new inserts I got off eBay for the Space Cell enclosure.  After all the electronics mounted in the enclosure the enclosure is dry-fitted I am going to paint the bottom of the deck with black satin enamel.  I have already sanded the truck hangers and existing motor mount and repainted with satin black enamel, I'll sand and paint the base plates and the new motor mount when all my parts start coming in.

I am going to re-grip the top of the deck with some black Jessup Pimp Grip I've got laying around, no idea of the cost, it was give to me.

I am not going for a stealth board, but I like the idea of everything being black with red underbody lights (currently installed).  I might go for some [Knight Rider lights](http://www.ebay.com/itm/7-Color-56cm-48-LED-RGB-Scanner-Flash-Car-Strobe-Knight-Rider-Kit-Light-Strip-/201695398280?hash=item2ef5fb8988:g:XJgAAOSw4shX90UX&vxp=mtr) :slight_smile:.

What did you use to mount the enclosure to your deck?

EDIT: Nevermind. Found the answer.

I started with threaded inserts, but they are just too brittle.  I eventually just went to barrel nuts.

Did you have to drill through the board and buy longer screws?

You do have to drill through the board, but it secures an enclosure so much better than threaded inserts in my opinion.  I used different bolts because I wanted them to be flush with the deck and drip tape.

Hey, excellent build! I noticed you didn't use an anit-spark plug. Was the high-voltage switch enough?

I had a vedder switch on it, I have since torn this build down and used the parts on other builds.  That's a great deck though.
