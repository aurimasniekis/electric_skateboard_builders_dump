hi all - looking for a deck to install @psychotiller SixShooters. 

I have a good deal for the Landyachtz decks below. What do you think? Wheel bite would be an issue?

@mmaner Worried about two things on "9 to 5" version 2014:

- Rocker style. Any good for our esk8 world ?
- Sory to ask again....are you positive about wheel bite?......it seems so close on the review below.... :anguished:

Rocker is nice to have, it helps find your place on the deck if nothing else.  I cant be positive you won't have wheel bite, but its unlikely and if you do you can always add risers.
