I saw these a few weeks back. Too bad they don't have the RPK version yet. Could be a game changer.

I think they have a suspended RKP truck they are producing next.

maybe we should send a bunch of emails to ask for square hangar and other E board needs.

can only contribute from a skatepark point of view. You need to push less, you feel it the most during lines or transitioning. 50/50 feel a lot easier, you need to get used to the pop though its "different". Its not as fast when it pops but feels higher and somewhat delayed if  that makes sense. But mostly its different in speed,feel and turn. The suspension part is mediocore. Dropping down from a 4-5 stairs feels a tad smoother but personally i feel like i lose some control during flatground session when the tricks are sketchy and my landing is bad i tend to fall of more with them. For cruising though definetly awesome, they are faster i don't know why.I skated them 4 times mayby would never again on a skateboard, on a Longboard cruiser hell yeah, freeride / downhill ehh don't think so my trust lies in caliber tbh.

I really like their ingenuity, and I'm curious about how these would feel on a longboard. 

There's no dampening of the suspended plate, so wouldn't so the downward pressure just create an equal amount of force back upward during rebound? It seems like it would be skating on a pogo stick. @Arzamenable is that what you experienced in your testing w them?

I've only tried them on my mountainboard which is close to 30-40 lbs, I'm 170. I can bottom out the springs with a light hop. I kept spring on front, normal base plate in rear  to get rid of pogo feeling. I might sell my spare 

A good test would be to check it out on urethane. I'm on pneumos

They are limited by the fact that they have to mount stock trucks to stock truck holes - in that sense they did a pretty good job.  But since I'm not limited to stock truck holes this gives me a lot of ideas.

Well if you are intrested there are a ton of pro/semi pro skater who actually like them (park/streetskaters) doing gnarrly big jumps regurarely. So far havnt seen one snapping. The pogo stick feeling ist upwards more forward, like someone gave you a little push that shouldnt be there.

I ride these daily for park and pool skating.  In my opinion they smooth out imperfections and concrete cracks.  I don't know how this will translate to eskates, but I haven't ridden my Indy's in months.  Just my 2 cents.

of course I hope they are stable and just do their suspension work as advertised.

@E-Boarding one quick question?
regular truck uses tilting motion to turn left or right, but with the avenue truck, does some of the tilting goes to the spring make the truck perform less?? I mean you have to lean harder to get the same angle as the regular truck.

Maybe you should try them before knocking the "concept" because in "reality" they work beautifully and the "concept" is already proven, patented too...so worry about criticizing the reality and try them before you bag on them. I have more miles on these than you most likely do on any truck and the "concept" that you say is terrible and idiotic, is actually my pleasant and comfortable reality...  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/8/28d5136364443ddd49587920965970d12c6df15d.jpg" width="666" height="500">

as an application on an esk8, for relaxed riding far away from any speed or shredding sure. They feel funky, cushion the ride.

It think he was coming from a longboarding perspective where these trucks are atrocious. At higher speeds you get super dangerous feedback from them in turns, since your weight input varies. So you will miss your apex more often than not and bounce back on forth between heel and toeside like a monkey. During the initiation of a slide they feel terrible and when you release the slide, it has more to do with praying than with controle. It is even worse during hads down slides, where the missing weight on them fuqs you up completely.

You have em onn your long distance board, with average speed where you could honestly ride without bushinngs and still be fine. So the trucks may make it softer for you. 

But I would support the notion that this truck is one of the worst ideas for serious riding or higher speeds. 

ps: I surprisingly like them a lot on my skate deck, super fun in the bowl, but a big no no for a longboard.

Jake takes them to 50+ mph with ease bro...so whatcha talkin bout they can't go fast? I bet you mean the mag rkp version that just came out...there's a better one, it's coming..no worries..I just wrote somewhere above that the mag ones are not strong enough for eskating anyway, I just have them on a cruiser myself, the tkp's are the tits for the bowls and the precision are best dh truck I've ever used..even better with a motor..here look, don't take my word for it, watch Jake bomb this hill at 50 mph on suspension trucks while I get a beer..

I partially agree with him with corners and slide. I feel less feedback and bouncy. BUT I think it's matters of getting used to. speaking of which, it does reduce speed wable and stable. i went up to 70km. and this is with original. rkp must be better

I guess the real question you are eluding too is "Is suspension beneficial to freeriding?" My instinct would be to say, naw...there's better trucks for that..but for racing and grip, stability from suspension is great. Eating thane and spending a day coring out some wheels frivolously (well ok not really its a blast right?) I think I might go for a 180mm rakeless rkp trucks...My avenues are 165mm and not made for freeriding, I think a lower angle like 45 or 44 would be better for free ride too, no? I mean, I'm not a pro stand-up slide kind of guy, my slides are more 1970's freestyle than anything, but it would seem suspension and narrow trucks would not be wanted for a "good" freeride truck...

I mean at freeriding everything is fair game. Depends on what you want to do or how much fun you want to have. Spent half of this autum freeriding on 110a 55mm wheels and 160mm trucks. Super snapy and fun, but super useless for anything else than having fun. So can't aswer that question, since its all about the day, what I want to do, if its wet or not and the course. 

For anything serious I would never want anything with any suspension system. I want my rock hard board, I want to stand over my baseplate and have as much of a direct feedback and controle as possible. But I give in to the argument that every rider has a different favourite truck for a reason. IMAO it comes down to cornering and how you aproach it. I usually preload my bushings very early on and hold that line. (you immidiately see if somone is riding that style ) and with increasing gradient and speed you might pick up you get more pressure onto the baseplate. So when I tried them had like a trampoline effect under my feet. basically the "suspension" effect messes up the geometry by default the way it works, if that makes sense. Hard to put in words, I think I even have footage from that session. We even kept walking up the same spot since we wanted so see if you could get used to it or actually controle it during intense summer heat. No luck, felt like ass the first and the 20th time.

Anyway to the video, well if you pay me. I'll bomb you that shit on a penny when the money is right. Most of the time what happens is that truck companys or wheel manufatureurs show up at events. Asking you for some shots, hand you a scrip that you fuq up and the results are super cringy annd funny most of the time. Had a crazy somonne doing a run without bushings, doens't meen its good at all. Will eat my words until I see somone runing teutonia with them. Anyway, 
 I think 22-24 poeple ran them, none liked them and nobody toock the free pair even.


End of the day to eatch their own, but for 100.- I would definetly recomend other alternatives by a long shot.

oh and PS: they wheel bite like crazy. Where I can run 78mm I could only run 62 or it would bite.

You are speaking about the magnesium rkp version yes? Because I am speaking about the precision 165mm with queen pin, totally different baseplate and animal ...I'm trying to tell ya, wait for the better ones and those problems disappear..and yay, I'm a totally different skater than you, the closest thing I do to any of that is bombing a parking garage for fun. I typically ride bowl and not very well, and do long distance pumping, but I've done more electric miles than anything now..your a thane eater, yeah? lol...I don't see them being advantageous or needed in that application...I think many people don't realize there's a big difference between a good downhill truck and a good freeride truck..one is controlling slide (release and hook-up), while the other maximizing grip..two different goals really..I'm 40 year old dude, I'm not tech sliding down the hill on avalanches cus I have to work the next day, lol..I do dig your style though, frivolous freeriding for the sake of it is the heart and soul of modern longboarding these days and I love seeing a sick chop job in the garage on vectors and some scrubs....that or pure dh..much props for what you guys do that I cannot..I use to have a mean burt though, does that still count?

haha, yeah well. had some days at uni or the office with blood stains trough the shirt. You get used to it honestly. between february and october you are lucky if you got 1 to 2 weeks road rash free. 

But yeah, i do freeride / Dh 50 /50 id say. Just becuase for DH you need a lot of time, set up, conditions and people. Will give them a try if they come out.

Its like you said, 2 different aproaches yield 2 different results

That would be difficult to do I think, but not impossible, what would it look like? like add another component, or a plate bolted to the bottom? there's no room around the top of the baseplate for the mount..in fact it takes a little wrench as it is to just put on the trucks because a standard skate key will not be able to get to the bolts..
