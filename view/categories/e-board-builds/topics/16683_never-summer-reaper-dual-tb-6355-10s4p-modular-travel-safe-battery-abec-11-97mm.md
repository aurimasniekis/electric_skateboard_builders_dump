Hello guys, this is going to be my second build, I can't stop enjoying this addictive hobby, the joy of the build process and the expectations to see the finished e-board are pumping my ethusiasm.

Sometime ago I saw a thead from @Spec fell in love with the Never Summer Reaper deck, the shape was sweet, so that build was an inspiration.

That flexible battery blew my mind.  I've been trying to figure out how to wire a 10s4p in such a way that I can break them apart if I want to travel by plane so I can bring my electric board with me.  I'm going to try that build in my next board.  

Awesome looking build there!!!

I soldered the nickel strips directly at the cells, so they are not overlappped with each other, I'm confident the connection is pretty solid

@jga yep. Just two layers ontop of the cell.
@Eboosted yep it looks solid, but the connection might be too thin for the current.

W concave board eh? That's been an intriguing form factor, seems like its more ergonomic for standing on the board for long periods, and better leverage for turning...
they seem rare though

## \#15 Posted by: Eboosted Posted at: 2017-01-26T18:46:57.423Z Reads: 408

Uhm. That made me wonder... 

If I solder an additional strip I might heat up the cells more, I wonder what would be an alternative. I may give the strips a try. 

@osbor the NS Reaper is know to be a really good deck for speed, the W shape would give me plenty of confidence for hard turns, it does not flex much. 

OTOH, even thought the deck is 37.5" long, it feels a lot smaller than the Loaded Vanguard, rear foot rest is a nice touch, shape and finish is awesome. So this could become my perfect travel board =)

Does this wiring diagram look ok to you guys?

What fuse would you suggestm if any, for the charging port and before the VESCs?

First obvious thing I see is that your missing a balance wire on cell 7 assuming cell 1 is in the bottom left. You only have 9 wires for your 10 wire connector. Also, if your using a Vedder anti-spark switch with the standard 40A fuse, you really shouldn't need the other two if it's all setup properly.

Thanks man, I'll leave it with no fuses then! BTW the missing balancer cable was a drawing error only :slight_smile:

yep it does heat up the cell more. Spotwelding would be a good point, or a really high Watt iron.

So yesterday I finished the build =O, I still need to put the enclosure bolts, enclosure gasket, watt metter, upgrade the charging port ad work polishing the details:

[img]http://i.imgur.com/1NA9Z2K.jpg[/img]
[img]http://i.imgur.com/lqjSkYn.jpg[/img]

I uploaded the @Ackmaniac latest firmware limited the max watt to 700W and went for a test ride.

OMG the board feels so stable at high speeds but at 700W it feels a lot less powerful than the Bamboo GT in GT mode, the calibers 44 with 6 degree angled raisers seems to be designed for 50MPH or more, not even a single minuscule speed wooble, but at low speeds it's not as carvy as the Evolve Bamboo GT, nevertheless it's way more comfortable and easier to ride.

https://youtu.be/H3AaID8NfpQ

I'll post more pictures tomorrow when I finish the detils.

BTW my BMS seems to be charging one of the packs 0.15V more than the rest of the packs, not sure it the cells of that specific pack are bad or the BMS is shot because of a short I had when I was assembling the board.

Two ways to avoid this, one is to push before u pull the trigger, the other is to use sensored FOC. Another option is to use Hybrid mode BLDC, but this doesn't completely remove the cogging effect only reduces it.

Do you need to plug the hall sensors to the VESC in order to use hybrid mode?

## \#29 Posted by: mortorojo Posted at: 2017-01-30T01:11:56.684Z Reads: 358

Yes, it uses sensored BLDC on low erpm then cuts off the sensors at higher erpm.

While installing the watt meter, throw a fuse in there at the same time.  @PXSS will agree

Completely agree with Blasto. I ordered a fuse holder for maxi size fuses and a 60A fuse but thats for a build without bms. Location either on positive lead directly to battery. The BMS should already have short protection in it so look over it's specs.

Today I made some room for the modular battery connections with a router, mounted the nutserts to the board and bolted the enclosure. 

I'm loving this board much more than my Evolve Bamboo GT.

@Eboosted  Man!!! what a great work!! best cover I have seen here! where did you got those batteries .... I thought they were 3,7V each...... so you did an 10s4p.... how long do you ride before get's flat?., that is a bestech BMS?
I'm looking for a battery... and maybe repeat what you did... put it together myself...  but not sure..... I was looking at this one... https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/electric-skateboard-10s3p-37v-7-5ah_60681583720.html?spm=a2700.details.maylikehoz.8.697a8c3elZPeOl

@Eboosted great build man, very sweet.

You had both a vanguard and reaper build, could you please compare the ride quality between the two. They are very different decks and I might do one or the other using you enclosure and I’m very interested how you found both boards. Thanks!

The vanguard is more comfortable, the reaper is fun to ride but only on good pavement but it's way more stable at high speeds, both are great.

However if Ineed to chose one, I'd go with the Vanguard, it's the first board I build and I still ride it all the time.

Any chance I could pay extra for you to add height (hopefully wouldn’t be too difficult) - just adding some layers and trimming to same shape of your current mold? As I am using two 5s zippy lipos at a height of around 1.8 inches, I doubt  the slim shape you have wouldn’t even come close unfortunately.
