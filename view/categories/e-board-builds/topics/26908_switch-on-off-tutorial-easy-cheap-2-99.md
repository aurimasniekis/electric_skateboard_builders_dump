I only watched the first 3/4 of the video and saw what esc that you were using. Using that switch requires that your ESC has a built in switch..

Yeah that's only good for ESC that already have a switch built in. But also, it's not recommended to leave your batteries connected all the time with those types of switches. You need a way to completely cut the power from the rest of your components. You could use this with an XT90 Anti-Spark 'loop key', but then you may as well not have the little switch in the first place.

Don't mean to rain on your parade :frowning:
