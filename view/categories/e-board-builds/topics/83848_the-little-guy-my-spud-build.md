Full Disclosure: Im horrible at taking pics while building. I apologize in advance. Itâ€™s hard enough for me to build, half the time im struggling to find out where i put the damn screwdriver i just had in my hands. 

I got a spud deck in the little deal i picked up and I couldnâ€™t see myself using auch a small deck. Well when i got home and stood on it, I kinda liked the little guy.... i had a 6355 motor so i said why not!?!? I didnt know they would be different versions of the same motor but im not one to care for small things like that![image|375x500](upload://8K9cZb9PRXYrexs7I0fvbZbCUbe.jpeg) 

After ordering another motor and converting my first build to lipo (maybe ill post that one later). I decided to build this lil guy. Nothing major, tb218 on 97mm abec11, dual  vesc-x, with a diyeboard enclosure and 10s5p.  I believe the samsung 25r..... It was sold to me when i was very very new by a member of this site (not throughthe site though) claiming it was his build only to find out he ordered everything from my build on diyeboard. Im not one to name names but lets say his username rhymes with honey lol... but i digress..... I also put 12mm belts that i had on some 15 mm pulleys. Didnt think it wouldbe an issue. I got the maytech antispark switch from hyperion

I put the little guy on 218 after failing to get two sk3 on.... rather than dismantle everything on the sk3s i just decided to keep them for my surfrodz next weekðŸ˜¬... plus i like the wide trucks on the little guy...

Since I figured I was already doing a bunch of stuff i normally dont do, why not put in sensored bldc!  My first run around the block was amazing. Super responsive on the controls. Using a nano-x. This lil guy became A new addition to the family. Just gotta add lights and reflective tape to make it all street legal!![image|375x500](upload://wwIAg64AcZkTbewAcGd3Nrxanea.jpeg)

I know I shouldnâ€™t hijack this thread, but can someone explain the whole story with Chris? Is there another thread why I can read the drama? I think I saw a really janky battery that he sold bring exposed on insta and I head another person say he ripped them off for a board.
