Just a typical loaded build.  Randal 2s with psychotiller motor mount holding a torque boards 6374 with 97mm flywheels  The deck is old and I always wanted to motorized it. I’m charging thru a bms but not  discharging thru it. No on/off siwitch just a xt90 antispark plug.  I’m kinda taking a page out of my RC car days. Only used a bms charger and they didn’t use a on/off switch. 
I’m attaching the battery and vesc to the board and I made a foam mold so I could vacu form an enclosure out of petg and I’ll paint from the inside like an rc Leland body. Here’s some pics. I’m waiting on some parts so it’s not finished yet<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/0/d0e5048cda7504cc95c43da7c177aad8a7ce95e6.jpg" width="669" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/1/b1240400736c9f88abe9ca99139fe536de6aadcd.jpg" width="669" height="499">

Don't loaded builds usually have split enclosure to accommodate flex?

It flexes very nicely.  I’m using kydex straps to hold the batteries directly to the board   That way the enclosure isn’t doing any heavy lifting. I tested this out with an old 12s lifpo4 pack that I used to set things and make sure it was working.  Turned out surprisingly well

I see popped spot welds in your future...single layer down the length of the deck.. and the battery is strapped to the deck vs the enclosure.

I think you need to change your design...

Good point @Deckoz. I’ve only made up the 3p part of the batteries so far. I’m gonna solder deans noodle wire in the series sections.  Should help with the flex. But you make a good point and I’ll keep my eye on it.

Dean's wire? Like series connection with a deans connector between?

If you've only done the 3p so far. I would do the series with two 14 guage wires with slack, so that it can flex front to back... 

I wouldn't do bullets or any type of disconnectable connection between series jumps. Use a solid connection (soldered or welded) between, as any type of connector will work it's way apart over time with the flex.

No connectors.  I’ll use a short section of deans noodle wire soldered between all the 3p groups

Lol sorry I just looked it up. I've never seen/heard someone refer to wire with "Deans'" in the name. So I figured you were referring to wire with a Deans connector

Yeah it’s very cool   Especially with the protective layer peeled off. It’s perfectly clear. I peeled it off the scrap pieces and I was impressed with the clearness.  But idk, I still kinda want to paint it.  Decisions decisions. Lol

It still needs a lot of trimming too. I want to make it thinner and contour to the curve in the deck

Why choose just one when you can have both?  Have 50% by area clear and the other 50% painted from the inside.... in cool patterns...

It’s been cold and shitty flu season here in New Jersey and in my house, so I haven’t been using my board lately.  But, here’s an update. I finished the batt mount system so the deck can flex and the pack can flex with it.  And I formed and painted a lexan cover for it.  There’s some things I’d change but it works great and I have about 30 miles on it so far![image|669x499](upload://75CeL6SxYaNhEfL3SsbwkikATXW.jpg)

I used a molded kydex strap and it’s held down with RC car body posts, which in turn holds the lexan cover on.  I was inspired by my electric RC cars.  They keep it simple.  No on off switches, no discharge bms’s and they take a beating flipping and crashing.  We’ll see how long it last in this application

I don’t like the way paint scheme came out and the cover isn’t centered properly, it’s something I just missed when setting up. It’s too square too, reminds me of fake Christmas present under a display tree in a store or something. Haha

Just a suggestion, I'd do something different than the cotter pins on the down side surface of the enclosure, they are likely to grab and throw you on rough ground or popping a curb.  Maybe move the cotter pin stud to a lip on the enclosure?
```

Good point.  I have an extra piece of lexan to mold   I think I’ll do that. Plus I want to make it contour to the shape of the deck just so it’s not so square and blocky

ABS and Kydex are pretty easy to work with.  If you fab a lip/ridge around the perimeter of the enclosure it would work well with the cotter pin studs.  Or you could use sexnuts for a really low profile look.  Personally, I use 3/4 or 5/8's pan head sheet metal screws.  I've never had a screw come out.

There’s a good post about battery enclosures and how the pack is mounted to the board. I think it’s titled battery mounted to deck or to enclosure? Something like that.  That was a decision I had with my build here

What is a sexnut? 
I’d like to keep the cotterpins, because I need to be able to take the cover on/off easily to connect the battery.  I’m not using a switch
