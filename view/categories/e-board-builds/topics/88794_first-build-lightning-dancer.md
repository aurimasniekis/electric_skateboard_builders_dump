Been lurking on this forum for almost a year now, it's about time! Just finished ordering all the main parts:

Deck - Bustin Danseau, 45&quot;. I haven't seen too many dancer builds, which makes me a little hesitant as a first timer, but this deck is just an absolute Cadillac and I think it would be a ton a fun to ride electrified. I was considering using my Earthwing Chaser 36&quot;, which is more of a traditional esk8 deck (wide pintail, very stiff), but I kinda hate it. I need a little flex. The Danseau is stiff as dancers go, and I'm not really planning on exceeding 25 mph anyway, so I think I should be stable enough.

Trucks - Caliber II 50 deg, 10&rdquo;

Wheels - 90mm flywheel clones from DIYElectricSkateboard

Motor - Single Turnigy Aerodrive 6374 BLDC, 190 kv

Drivetrain - 15/36 belt drive. Machining my own 6061 motor mount.

Battery - 10s4p with Samsung 30Q Li-ion cells. This has been the biggest obstacle. I sort of wish I had just bought a custom during the Black Friday blowout, but it&rsquo;s been fun to learn about building packs, and now I feel equipped to become a one man gigafactory. I ordered @aulakiria&rsquo;s spot welder and a bunch of miscellaneous pack making stuff (gonna wrap it in neoprene and then heat shrink it). Also got [this BMS](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074FXJFG1/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and a bunch of XT-90s connectors. I anticipate this being the hardest part of the build.

VESC - FOCBOX

Remote - Enertion Nano-X. Right off the bat I don&rsquo;t love the ergonomics, hope I&rsquo;ll get used to it.

Haven&rsquo;t started assembly yet, so I&rsquo;ll be updating this as I go, I&rsquo;m just waiting on the spot welder and battery miscellanies. If you kind veterans are inclined to give some constructive criticism, the main thing I&rsquo;d like feedback on is deck choice. There&rsquo;s not insignificant deck flex on the Danseau, so I&rsquo;m planning to mount the battery against one wheelbase and the rest of the hardware against the other, to stay away from the most flexy region. Anybody ride an electric dancer and have an opinion? Thanks!

I would change the motor to a bkb 6374, way more reliable then the turnigy

You mean lifespan or quality? Looking at the bkb I see the shaft already has flats which is a nice touch.

Both, try to run sensored for a better start up, if you run uncensored, you’ll have a jolt when you start accelerating

Ah okay good to know thx. If it's enough of a jolt to throw me off you can be sure I'll be running uncensored

It’s a decent motor still but I personally am not a fan

Oh hahah, still learning, Michigan roads are pretty rough, is this board going to be intended for fun or as transportation?

Ugh yeah the rough roads are part of the reason I don't like a stiff board. Mostly transportation between and around our two campuses at UofM, they're like 2 miles apart. If fun means buzzing around really fast then nah, i've never really wanted to go faster than like 20 tbh, but could be that'll change once I get some power underneath me
