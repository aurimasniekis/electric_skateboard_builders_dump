So since I want another smaller board to run around with, I decided to build a hub motor kicktail board

Things that have already been ordered:

- ESC / Motors / controller from Predator Boards / Ownboard -- boosted board style remote, supposedly near vesc-level smoothness.
- 30x Samsung 30Q cells from IMR batteries and a 10S bms for charge-only, I will be building the pack myself.
- battery enclosure from UNiK
- 32x9  kicktail deck that is currently drying after being painted black.

I will still need to get a front truck/wheels. 
Grip tape, and other misc things.

I'll get build pictures up once parts start trickling in.

Ordered new 180mm trucks and 90mm flywheel clones

for the grip tape, i wanted a little different from the standard black,

so went with

not welded yet, but stacked in its final configuration.  should give plenty of juice and range for this build.

I'd sell those 159mm Indeesz + the orange Baseplate for $60. I think that's a pretty fair price considering the cost of a new set that's never seen a hill bomb.

board is done, due to some issues i had to go with a wowgo esc and picked up the new meepo hubs with replaceable PU sleeves.

in classic fashion i lost a bolt so the enclosure has only 7 instead of 8.

anyways, its charging now but i love the stealthness of hubs.  time will tell how it rides.
