Starting a thread to keep track of my build.  I got it running last week and have been figuring out what works and what doesn't.  Still working on making pods for batteries and ESC.  This will primarily be transportation to and from work ~3 miles.

Heatsinked VESC from Ollin:

I guess that is a first post limitation and I happened to be creating a build thread for my first post.  Here is the rest.

Motor detection on 12v PSU.

Not a lot of belt clearance:
[img]/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/ee2b4219aea5cd10b3d26b40b53d1f89a6980e21.JPG[/img]

It works:

So there is still work to do.  I started working on battery and ESC enclosures which will take a week or so to finish.  I also have a 15mm drive setup on the way and a different motor mount to test out.  Just put red locite on tour motor mount bolts to start.  My mount has come loose 3 times now, but I think I finally got everything torqued now.  I replaced the set screws on the psychotiller mount with hex bots to get more torque and thread engagement.

I have about 22 miles on it now.  My longest trip was 10.5 miles and the battery was at 44.5v when finished so it has more range.  My top speed on flat is ~25mph and overall on a small decline I hit 30.1mph.  I am in the process of figuring out what bushings I like as well.

I will post progress I as swap the drive and build the battery/ESC enclosures.

½" risers would help a lot with the deck clearance for the motor and wheels,   and the extra height is not really noticeable when riding. I'm using ½" risers with 90mm wheels and it feels fine and gives me lots of carving room.
The trucks in this pic are Caliber II with 44deg base plate.

Yeah I need to think about that.  I was running the psychotiller mount and it is nice and short so had decent clearance.  I have had too many problems with it coming loose ,so I put on a diyelectricskateboard mount last night and it is over 10mm longer and clearance is an issue as well as none of the belts I have fit.

Yeah.  Even red with no luck.  Sidewalks and rough asphalt still have managed to make them come loose multiple times.  I got the mount on the hangar tight, it's the bots that hold the motor arm on that keep coming loose.  I am thinking about drilling the threaded holes out and putting nuts on the back so I can get more clamping force.  I tightened them up very tight, but was worried about stripping the threads.

Yeah.  I thought about that last night.  I am gonna get some longer bolts and go straight through the mount instead of threading into it.  I will also put a bolt straight through the mount so it can't rotate.  I will post some pics tonight after I get finished.

One thing I really like about your mount is it fits tight into the space available.  I just got a diyelectricskateboard mount and it is ~12mm longer, which means it takes up more space and different belt sizes.  I think I might just order every mount I can find and review them all.

Hate is actually a fairly harsh word...Sorry. I just didn't like how far in front of the truck the motor sat. Brackets were way too long. Which is why I started making shorter mounts. Shorter also enabled me to make them slim.

I too had issues with physcotillers mount. The main issue was with the hangar clamp and set screws. Replace the set screws with hex heads and red loctite. Let cure for 24 hours. Better but still comes loose after a good ride or two. Issue here is variations in calibers hangar size from the factory and a single sided clamp. Anyway... mine came loose at least 10 times eventually causing stress cracks in the mount. I contacted the guy a bought it from and he said he would send out a shim to fix the loose fit. Not gonna help at this point. Solution was to weld everything in place. Best move I've made. No more worries from the mount.

So I thought I finally got the mount situated,  It stopped rotating after I drilled out the threaded holes and put bolts with nylon lock nuts and red loctite.  This allowed to get enough clamping force to prevent the rotation.

On the other hand it totally cracked open today.  Just under 50 miles on it and it's done for good now.  There are too many spots that don't have enough material it seems.  Is there any reason people don't make these out of steel?  Pretty much the most important mechanical piece on the board.

Not exactly sure what caused it to fail.  I noticed the belt was slipping a lot under braking then finally stopped and the mount was bent over dragging the belt into the wheel.  I pushed it back to straight and went another 1/4 mile.  When I inspected it further I found this crack.

I'm using Torqueboards new dual mount setup.  
It's a very solid mount. 
Also, I replaced the 1/2" rear riser with a 1/4" riser and kept the 1/2" riser on my front truck. 
The resulting 1/4" rake makes the ride amazing!
With snug bushings in front and tight bushings in back, it's very stable. 
And the low rider rake makes accelerating/braking much more comfortable. 
I would never have thought to try this but a friend of mine who races downhill told me to setup with the nose a little higher and the back wheels tighter. 
I'm currently running 44 deg base plates front and back. Bushings are Riptide abs cannon. 
Front: 85a deck side & 90a street side
Rear: 90a deck side & 95a street side
My weight on the deck compresses the upper(softer) bushings and relaxes the lower(harder) bushings. I'm 188lbs and the ride with those durometers are reasonably carvey yet stable cruising at moderate speeds 10-18 mph. I didn't try higher speeds with this setup yet because I'm nursing a sprained wrist and don't want to risk falling again until it's healed. I'm anxious to see how the rake feels going faster. It does make leaning forward feel more balanced and comfortable.

I have a diyelectricskateboard V3 mount that will be going on tonight.  I was waiting for longer belts cause it will require a 270mm on 14:36 instead of the 250mm on the psychotiller mount since the center-to-center distances are different.

I have to agree to the steel statement. AL is not particularly forgiving when bending has exceeded its flexible region; it fatigues quickly and then it snaps, and then is done. Running high power will exacerbate the problem with bending in AL mounts, thus causing premature failure if they bend too much.

Spent last night switching to 15mm drive setup and the diyelectricskateboard mount.  I only have 3 miles on this, but it feels like the 15mm drive works so much better than 9mm.  So if you are planning on single motor try to find 15mm drive parts.

Here is the damage to the old mount:

Now have 58 miles on the board and have reached 31.5mph top speed on a slight decline.  Cruising at 25mph is effortless.

Not to be a smart ass, but you can see in the pics that there is a 15mm pulley on my 6374.  It is tight, but there is clearance.  Also depends on the motor mount and pulley thickness.  I can take accurate measurements tonight and post them.  This motor pulley is 20.5mm wide.

So how is this relevant to stealth71's build thread? As stated previously by a previous poster I agree that your mount belongs in a motor mount thread, not on someone's build thread. I am interested in building a skate just like stealth71, with off the shelf stuff that is already made, and DIY stuff is out of the question for me.

My current mount is the  v3 mount.  It's been working great I broke a psychotiller mount previously.

I just touched base with the seller of the 15mm drive parts.  This was a prototype unit and I don't think he has the final production pieces yet.
