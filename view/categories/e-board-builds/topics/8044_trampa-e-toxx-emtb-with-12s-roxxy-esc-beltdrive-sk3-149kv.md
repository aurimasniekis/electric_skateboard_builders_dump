Hey.

In fact that there is a big need for good 12S Esc´s for use in MTB i started to test some new one.

The ESC´s are from Robbe and called 9120-12S OPTO 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/4666d46d8ab3b3fb726bbc6324a7e1dd5cccec51.JPG" width="666" height="500">

The footprint is similar to the MAX6 only 3mm longer and lower in hight.

This ESC is longer then 5 years on market and is marked as a universal ESC for Car, Boat, Plane and Helicopters.

I bought the optional Programmbox wich is very nice helpfull tool
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/63332d7e4d898238903cbbea083e480cd789e7e7.JPG" width="666" height="500">

You can set all needet parameters easily with the programmbox!

Most parameters can be changed like aceleration, timing, reverse, pol numbers etc...

But the brake strenght cant be changed! 
The amount of brakepower is good IMO so its no big downside for me. Also you have to get on with the trigger way for braking : The board starts to brake on maybe 80% of the trigger brakeway ! So you have only 20% of the normal trigger way. Anyway the brake is proportional and QUITE and good.
I get really fast on with it. Maybe if you use better RC-type controllers you can play with settings linke EXPO to get more triggerway.

I rebuild my Beltdrive Trampa with these Roxxy´s

Its a HTD 5 drivegears 25mm width, reduction of 1:6 with a roller and support bearing holder

I use my Hobbywing MAX6 Carbonfibre plate for the Roxxy´s. They comes without mountingholes so i use double sided 3M to mount on plate.

The Roxxys are OPTO Esc´s that means the have no build in BEC.
I use an MTEC Keto HV BEC V2, it delievers up to 10A continuous current (-;
absolutely overkill but its quality stuff and maybe anyday i can use it for supply anything :innocent:

Batteries are Hobbyking stuff : 6S 5000mAh 60C Zippy Compact, wired in series for 12S !

Motors are actually the SK3-6374-149KV

First 2 testruns are really impressive.
The startup is very good, the acceleration is brutal (-; 
The thing is a beast, it has such a nice feeling on trigger!
It has an absolutely direct feeling, even on low rpm´s ....

Will do some video footage on next run if it will stop to rain today (-;

Congrats on finding this exact esc, seems to work quite ok for the needed application.. :slight_smile:
--- 

Although - I had a mechanical question - **How much of the motor pulley is sitting on the motor axle?**


I'm wondering because my sk3 motor is still on its way and axle lenght for sk3 6374 I believe is 27mm.. (from what I could figure from the shematic shown on hk.com)


---
So I cannot get my head around how did you manage to fit 25mm belts, if the pulley is probably 27mm.. + motor mount which seems also almost 6mm if not 8mm in thickness + a little bit of spacing between motor mount.
```

During the rain i changed the Aluminium Braces to Carbonfibre ones.
They are also 8mm thick but in total wheight drops about 110gramms.

It still rains so i milled some slots in the spacers with a roundhead miller, saves 1gramm per piece LOL just kidding its more for the look :joy:

After good performance tests with the Roxxys yesterday i decidet to test if even more Power is possible :smiling_imp:

I prepered some 192KV Turnigy´s with the 12tooth pulleys : 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/207157f7ed3e9da5f00ab463e93c666111a60107.JPG" width="666" height="500">

@Okami : 
As you can see here i "extend" the Motorshaft with some "silversteel" round material.
About the half of Motorpulley sits on motorshaft, the rest is supported ...
Motormounts are 10mm thick btw.

192kv Turnigys mounted on Rig :

Have done 3 runs with the new motors today, its hard to describe in words man :scream:
You dont even feel an drop in acceleration, it just going straight forward with a speed that is awesome!
Topspeed is calculated with 54kmh equal to nearly 34mph.
The tires are looking for grip but they had a hard time :sunglasses:

I will try soon to get this performance on video, not sure whats best for demonstrating...
keep you updated

Hi Jens, another awesome build! 

Do you think it's possible to make the ESCs and BEC as tidy as in your Hobbywing Max 6 build?

[/quote]

That's clever.. I always wondered doesn''t the ''one sided'' belt load makes the motor suffer.. I suppose you really have an engineer's mind to come up with this solution.. thought why you have that weird extra dot in the mount, now I know why :)  - the shaft extender

----
About the tires - have you found ones that last more than just a couple of rides? :D  I hope I'm not joking but I think you said once that your burned through some tires in only 1 or 2 rides.. crazy.. almost like drift rider, who needs a couple of extra set of tires after each drag race..

I have an Etrampa with similar wheels and I've put over 100 miles so far without much wear on tires. A lot of those miles were off road but I don't think the asphalt does a whole lot of of wear

It depends on driving style and type of tires of course.
Burnouts on split are not the tires best friend.
IMO the Alphas wear out more then the other tires, but you dont have to forget that this is the lightest tire, all other have about 100gramms more per wheel.
My favorites are Trampa Mudplugger, but not for concrete use.
Very good in the woods or on hard dusty dirttracks.

I mount them on the driven truck in wrong direction, better traction IMO. Thanks to "BruceLee" ..

On the front they mounted correctly.

Have had some more runs on the 192kv :smiling_imp:
Hot in Germany about 30degrees.
Motors get real hot after heavy abuse, about max temp of 80degree inside on the coils.
Batteries gets 40degrees
ESC about 37degrees (-;

I need about 800mAh for 1km, by agressive riding ...

Have an look, got some video footage from yesterday.

@Nowind Can you name a few reasons why exactly you chose 25mm belt? Have you had problems using 15mm or 25mm is just more durable / more power?

---
As for the tires.. I think I recall that skike wheels/tires were quite bad in terms of durability although I should check whenever this was true.. :) 

so yeah, it looks like mountainboard tires are sturdy enough and wouldnt become naked just after a few rides

No its not the double amp draw, maybe about 30-50% more for my feeling.
Most Batteries i got from HK. Zippy Compact 40C-6200mAh would be in your budget i guess.

You got my Mounts without Drivegears??? Not from me (-;

Hey.

So i do it again :imp:

Set on Fire the second ROXXY : 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/7/c764a733a3a1615a918e3072deba34c5038d664d.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/1/518bc68f29af8b22f3e671c8bf91d70fb42c0735.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/1/c114200ae309c5b8faf998f9554a3153c0deab1a.JPG" width="666" height="500">

No video this time :wink:
It was more fire then last time, also the flames go not to the side but straight to the binding/feets : 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/9/f9960e4906508a96c166e85c4887369a25e3d33b.JPG" width="666" height="500">

See the charred boots :

So dont ride barefoot :sunglasses:

This time it was different from first time : 
It catches fire without load, was running for about 5km and wanna make a U-turn, done a "180" for this and when the board touches the ground again the ESC explodes !!!

I checked my other Roxxy´s after this for possible reasons , when i open the case i see some debris like little stones inside. And on one Roxxy the most exposed part from underside already was broken. I guess one more hard impact needet for third firework !

This part sits in this pocket of housing :

So what i will do are mainly two things : 
I will go with Epoxi to pour out the complete ESC, this will made it waterproof and protect it for debris.

And i will add some extra capacitors, a smart guy advised me after 1. Firework to do so. I will add 3 or 4 LOW ESR 63V ones next to each ESC.

Of course with this EPOXI stuff i loose all waranties, but if the improoved ones fails again i will probably go with other ESC !

that is crazy! glad you're ok. and looks like everything else is ok.
maybe you should make like a shied to cover the ESC, not to enclose it but just so that when it goes up in flames again it doesn't damage your bindings/boots/you.

Glad you're ok, but that's pretty scary. Better that it's the ESCs and not the batteries though. Have you thought about making a shock absorbing ESC mount on foam or something?

@barajabali
Do you have an link for this?
And what is about your Torqueboard Esc, still happy?

@DilatedPupils
Thats a good question, i'm really best in smashing parts (-: got some customers without problems on Roxxys until now... but i dont know how hard they ride?!?


@Mobutusan
Yes i will go with some absorbing when i do the Epoxi mod... yeah man better esc fire then lipo fire for sure Bro !

My Hobbywing ESC´s have take alooot of shocks without problems, i think actually the Roxxy is an universal controller (CAR,BOAT,AIR) and maybe not optimized for Car use... 
It seems that there is a weak point as i explained above and i will try to eliminate it.

Relocated the BAttery and Motorwires to come out on Top

Prepered a moulding device for filling it up with epoxi.
Need this to get the right space on bottom and side.
It is fixed on the heatsink with 4 screws.

Hey.
I´m late with this project.
Filled up the first 36h ago. Normally drytime is up to 48h.
Actually it still feels sticks and soft.
Pretty sure i mixed up the 2k stuff correct, but maybe the first night it was to cold in the garage.
Took it inside for the last 12h. Have to wait now.

The Cap-Banks from YGE came in, maybe i will mount them first on my excisting setup without epoxi actually, depends on how fast it dryes and how good i get it out of cast.

Cheers
Jenso

I almost thought this is real and already happening :D

I think there was this company called ''QS MOTOR''  who perhaps might have some hub motors in smaller sizes sometime in the future

Though, for now, the smallest one's they got, I think, were still about 10-11' in size and they were for e-scooters mostly. The perfect hub motor probably should be about 4'' in size. 

Hoverboard motors are okay.. but mostly they are only around 250w.

Thanks you Riako.
Actually i dont think that Hubmotors will be the future of EMTB.

The lack of torque without a gearing is too big IMO, you will need really big hubmotors and if these will fit in a 8Inch tire i dont believe.
Also the axial forces caused to jumps and hard offroad riding will be a big battle for the bearings.

I dont say that Hubs will not workable on MTB´s, but a 250W or even 1000W Hubmotor is not comparable to a geared 2500W satelite configuration... maybe for some chilled cruising but not for what i prefer.

Just my 2 Cents.
Cheers

My epoxi roxxy still not dryed complete, i guess the first 12hours in not tempered garage damaged the internal structure... 

Anyway i done the Cap´s Mod to the other roxxys for testing.
Its a bit ghetto fabrication, dont want to invest more then needet until i know that this will really improve it!

Used some electrical tape to secure the caps :

Fingers crossed it works Jesso, get to fabrication lol.... MGM got back to me about those esc's and reckon they will be all good, one thing they were worried about was the enertion motors and there ratings-on the website there rated to 12s- 44v max but with my battery's there 51v fully charged, also the amperage that they can handle.
I've emailed Jason as to what amps they can handle but no reply as yet. 
I guess we'll just have to wait and see, I'll order the esc's after Christmas.

@bbq870 
Its build originaly to compensate longer battery wires.
Every ESC Builder will tell you that you have to use as short as possible power wires.
If you cant do you are supposed to add this capbanks... they are some manufactors like YGE and MGM who are selling this for their ESC´s. YGE also says that they will improove the "partial load" property and that this capbanks should be used if the ESC is used on its limits, like max voltage...
So i think it is really made for my kind of application (-;

Got only 3 rides now on the moded roxys, only time will tell.

Yeah really easy to add nearly any wanted colour. R&G is selling many differnt colours. I dont use it this time because i dont want to cover the LED. But its easy to add an piece of Polycarbonate on that LED to take the light out of the cast. Maybe next time (-:

100 amps continuous 
140amps for 10 seconds
180amps for 3 seconds

Hey Mate,

nice to hear that you start the deal with MGM
I really really really hope that your massive investment will turns out good for you.
I told you about my expierences with MGM in RC applications some years ago, so i hope the best.

Have you pictures from the ESC itself?
This Capbank is for both ESC or you got 2 Capbanks?
Massive 7500uF you got with one! 
Compared to YGE 9-Caps each 390 = 3500uF

Specs dont sound that much better as from the Roxxy i think.
12S-120A 

Of course 14S is better but most motors have a 10 some 12S limit, which motors you choosen?

When did you get the MGM´s ?

Hey Jenso👍🏻there is two capacitor banks of 5, the caps are pretty big 16 diameter, 35 high.
I could of gone for a larger esc but the physical size would of Been to large to fit on the back of the board with a bigger cap packs + the reciever and Bec.
The motors are enertion 6374 that I'm making longer shafts for so I can run a bearing support.
Batterys are 4 6s Turnigy graphene 6000mah, connected in series and parallel.
I don't have photos of the esc's that there making yet but they will look something like the following pic.
The controllers have pretty advance configurations and adjustability with real time data logging comparable with vesc.
Hope they work, I've been told to run them at 6s to start off with then check the data feedback and send the results to MGM and they will give me a starting point for 12s.
After sending a link to your fireworks vid they are saying that  your problem would be <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/4/7432cd9788cf415b3bc5d0c6510b776cbecb5ec5.PNG" width="281" height="500">caused by constantly overloading the controllers when you get off and on the throttle causing peek burst current to often in a short period of time....

Also if you pour it all over electronics it wont be able to catch fire because there is no air, but cooling might be a problem

What were your thoughts regarding your previous config with the 149kvs vs the 190kv sk3s @Nowind?
About to pull the trigger on a pair for a 12s emtb setup with focbox
Fairly long hills in the commute, your 80 degree coil temps make me think maybe the lower kv will be better for me

I would go for the 149kv... better for torque and temps... also your vesc will be thanksfull for not hitting the 60K erpm limit...

EDIT : read anwhere that the Focboxes dont have the 60k limit.. more around 100k erpm... 
But anyway i would choose the 149kv... 

Cheers
