I am 46 but grew up surfing skating and snowboarding.  I wanted the deck to pay homage to Gordon and Smith but I also liked the racing stripes of evolve.  Orange accents, green caliber 2 trucks and black evolve 83mm wheels on a plain drop deck.  I am just here for kicks so the battery is 10s 2p from Chi, focbox, bkb motor, mount, and pulley. Finished with a psychotiller enclosure. Thanks üôè to you all  for all the advice along the way. Already have some ideas for my next build. Took my first test ride tonight. What a blast.

It was great. Felt solid, good speed and good on the up hills.

Took my first long ride today on my DIY build....  8.5 miles around the art museum and kelly drive in philadelphia.  Kudos to CHI battery,  I started with 95% and ended wirh 20% remaining.  I am 215 lbs,  so I am guessing this battery could do 10-11 miles on a full charge no problem.  As advertised thanks Bara...  Thanks...
