Greetings.

Here is my work in progress. Been lurking in this site for a while, and finally became a member recently. Since the majority of my parts have arrived and I've loosely started to put them together I thought I'd start a Build Post to document how things are going.

It's nothing fancy oir ground breaking, just a collection of parts that seemed to be highly recommended by others on here. Can't beat looking at other builds for inspiration :slight_smile:

I'm waiting on my battery and enclosure, but these are on their way to me in next week or so. 

_I've also got the new Photon Remote + Receiver on back order to truly make this board a GTX KIller :smile: but since these are coming from USA it'll most likely be end of April before I see this. The standard Maytech remote will have to do for now....._

edit : Photon Remote is no more. Probably a failed project as got a refund within minutes of asking where the package is after receiving a shipping notice a fortnight earlier ! Weird !

![20180312_162551_resized|690x388](upload://wwSLl7zhLq6P7lMfZifALTEDWgh.jpg)

I'll probably go quiet for a couple of week now, but very much looking forward to completing this build before the end of spring !

Thanks for all your (inadvertant) help from older post here, and hope you like my project :sunglasses:

you know you're dealing with a good supplier when they put the Haribos in :slight_smile: Got them with my Prusa MK2s 3D Printer too !

Got some neat ideas for this board to make it stand out from other builds (as well as blending in an OEM way). Hope it turns out how my mind is envisaging it...

even smaller steps today...

ON/OFF switch in NC arrangement. Figured it would be better to have the switch pressed in for OFF, and the LED to be ON only when the switch opened, or outwards, due to vibrations in motion. Might never happen, but would be bummer for the switch to open during riding. Can't envisage a scenario where the switch is pushed in whilst riding and cutting the power !

Plus the Amber LED looks cool :)

I don't have any future pretensions, illusions, that Enertion will fix my Focbox when the doomsday come (do you think I' will spend my energies sending a piece of dead crap across the Pacific ocean to far away Australia for a fix?). I will treated as another disposable item, not like a relic as many here worship that piece of electronic. Its sole purpose is to drive a stupid motor. What is so special about them if the rate at which they die reach the two digits (??) When your phone dies and you try so hard to wake it up you tossed away and buy a new one, simple. The same goes for the dang VESC. Is just $ 150, not the end of the world.

By the way, nice Enclosure! Where did you get it? You made it?

Thanks, hopefully the FOCBOXs will hold up. Stupidly expensive I know, but hey ho, this build isn't about sticking to a budget.... üòê

The enclosure is by Big Ben, not me. He's a member on here. Super high quality and fits the concave of the deck like a glove. Some more images, now with neoprene gasket fitted (2mm self adhesive)

I'm embarrassed to admit how much they were.... ! The 70mm bolts are the least popular version Pro-Bolt sell....

I had been given Amazon vouchers for my birthday (why I still get these at 44 is a total mystery) so seeing as I was at a loss on what to spend them on, this little bit of bling was the only thing I could think of üòÅ

They do look good though in my opinion

well...... I'm undecided on whether to leave it in there, with a fitted flush USB extention to the outside of the enclosure. The thinking there is for recharging of the front and rear lights (USB charged), or a phone, or anything small for that matter whilst I'm out and about. 

I've got the space in there, so why not ? :)

thanks, still needs a bit of trimming actually to make it as neat as I want, but it's a simple and cheap solution, and the self adhesive is so tacky it will never move around. The picture makes it look like felt, but it's definitely neoprene rubber and will form a good seal for the electrics inside.

A bit of housekeeping in the enclosure this afternoon. Wasn't happy with the rough cuts on the gasket and FOCBOX tidy, so a hour or so with some P120 paper, and it all looks nice in there (I think)

This is a great idea, it's funny you say that, because it WILL happen, ive had the switch rattle itself to the off position pretty much every ride, so I will be doing this asap, I was originally going to replace the switch with a simple rocker, but this is way better.

Cheers!

thanks ! Typically work got in the way this morning, so looks like I'm comng in over the weekend instead now....... :( 

That workshop is functional, but not modern. Just an accumluation of stuff over 20 years in business as an injection moulder. Still, so long as it's not 5 axis CNC I can do pretty much anything on a small scale with milling, lathes, grinder and far too many tools. 

Keep thinking about what stuff needs injection moulding for eSK8 that isn't already available, and what would make a return on investment due to the ridiculous tooling costs for injection moulds. It's still niche market I guess, but the only thing I can think of is wheel pulleys, but they have so many variations to fit so many wheels that it still seems like pie in the sky to spend ¬£10K on a mould per set. 3D printing is still the way to go right now on that.

Open to suggestions though..... :)

So went back to work this afternoon to do what I had had planned to get on with yesterday.... before actual work got in the way (annoying how that happens between Mondays and Fridays....)

Didn't get any electrical stuff done as my original idea of using some D Line trunking to route cables from enclosure turned out to be a duffer, so still thinking of a suitable alternative for that.

I did do plenty of drilling and inserts, basic assembly, and to make it look like I've achieved something, I fitted some front and rear lights that I'd bought way back at the start of this project, only to have them sitting in my parts box doing nothing. 

In four hours all I accomplished is shown below in pictures, but I work slowly, plus you need to factor in head scratching time, as well as standing back and admiring minutes..... üòÇ

All in all I'm pleased with today's progress, and the next big jump will be the internal electrics and making that look neat and tidy.

What do you think of the board so far?

Since I bought it I've seen several other boards on here with this rear light, and the variety of fittings it came with had one that is an absolute perfect fit for what I had in mind, behind the riser.

final update before installing the beating heart of this beast.

Was never truly happy with the green and orange 97s and the unbalanced look they gave the board. My remit for the whole project was to make somethingt that looked OEM, if not better, and so far I'm very happy with the way things are turning out. Perhaps despite my better judgement I opted for the Evolve 107s (need to scrape off the Evole Branding). Now the board has brand new look and feel, and the extra size, both diameter and width, of the 107s is far more in proportion to the super wide deck and 218 trucks.

Before I break it down for the open heart surgery I took a few pictures. I'm so looking forward to riding this :slight_smile:

Yes it did, it's half of one of the cycle brackets, screwed into the underside of the deck. Amazingly the angle matches that of the TB truck kingpin socket (see pic) and it's as if it's made to fit snugly in there ! 

Just hope it's strong enough as it is (vibrations) but I have an idea to strengthen it up if necessary that I can print out. The whole rear end has an automotive feel to it I think now !

![Screenshot_20180501-205944|690x388](upload://upbODOng67mZ9yiCWrleVztsGoN.jpg)

The light slides out of this bracket as well if you push the lock tab down. With it removed you can't even tell there's provision for a tail light at all üòÅ (but all this is pure luck over design!)

Evolve kindly sent me 2x Pulley covers with the 107s, but of coarse they only fit their tiny motors. Gave me the idea to make my own though for the 6374s.

This is most definitely Version 1, and is _**too good**_ a fit with only 1mm clearance at best. You could argue that it will stop even more unwanted crud getting in there, but to me at least it looks wrong and needs around 3mm clearance to look best. I'll take suggestions though....

Took longer to print than design in Fusion :slight_smile:

Revisions include : extra 0.25mm wall thickness around screw holes, extra 3mm clearance on wheels (107s), and extra filleting for smoothness.

Haha no probs ! Was just messing around with logos and stuff. Learned a lot this last few days. 

Still need to tweak the design as it happens. The covers are fine for rear mounted motors, but after fitting to mine I've found that, for inward facing ones, I need to shave some height off as the covers catch the underside of deck (at full tilt).

Can you print this in semi flexible filament? After having some solid risers then changing back to rubber ones the extra vibration killing from the soft risers is certainly noticeable.

Yeah I suppose I could. I had originally planned to use a 3mm one from my regular ramp boards (in tandem, like a sandwich) to act as a cushion, but I'll look into different filaments once I've finalised the design. My main plan here is to have an extra section coming out with the wires, hugging the underside of the deck and routing directly into your enclosure, and thus hiding ALL the wires. 

Just concentrating on the riser section first, then will extrude the cable 'conduit' to suit, getting the angles and curves right, once I'm happy the riser works OK.

Will be called a CCR.... Cable Conduit Riser üòÇ

well the Photon Remote part of this build has been dropped....

I ordered it on 14th March, albeit as a back order which I was fine with.

Had very little contact about the order, but put this down to 'small business' practices.

I'm a patient soul, and finally got an email out of the blue on 30th saying item was shipped. Shipped but not tracked..... weird for a purchase of over $200

Sent emails asking for clarification but received no reply. Finally lost patience and thought the only way I'm going to rattle this cage is to open a Paypal Case, clearly stating in the case that I still wanted the remote, but I also need proper info and tracking details for a purchase like this.

6 minutes later I receive a full refund, again with no personal message or reason.

Make of this what you will, but I have to say I'm surprised considering the developer is a memeber on here and all experiences tend to get shared like this.

Regular remote for me it is then :(

Cable Riser Hider Progress : 

This is very much a test print and has highlighted many areas I need to tweak, but the fitment is good and the function will be sound. Wall thickness needs to be increased and I've already broken some of the tabs as I removed the supports after printing, but essentially I think this is going to work, hiding the wires from riser to enclosure.

Cable Risers are not exactly an original concept, but the additions to any other cable riser out make it sufficiently different enough for me to call this my design I guess.

This version is designed to be trimmed to size, and then those new measurements added to the main component before reprinting. Then it'll be a flush fit straight out of the box. I'll save the current version though so others can trim to their enclosure (in the unlikely event of someone else wanting to use my efforts!).

The reason for the 'tabs' on the extension are to allow this section to flex and hug the underside profile of the deck. It's a simpler solution to working out the 'S' profile from riser to enclosure that my deck has. Some decks are 100% flat, which would make things easier all round !

Images of test print (bit rough, but OK for 1st print)

Thanks, I'm pleased with today's progress and how things are coming together finally.

I don't mind sharing this riser, though it it isn't an original design. I saw something similar on UNIK website, but without the extension to hide wires, and without a hall sensor harness hole (mine is big enough to route the JST-6 Pin plug through). Would I get in trouble for posting it up on there, or is it sufficiently different to be classed as a new design ?

well if that's the case (I haven't seen them) and no-one minds I'll put my version up as another option for people. It's very basic and functional, but the sizes are good. Just needed to slightly open up the bullet holes with a 5mm drill bit to get the plugs to fit snugly. The extension is also longer than needed for my build, so I just trimmed it down by hand after printing with some snips.

First trip around the block here on the industrial estate. Probably did no more than 20 - 25kph.

Been a while getting you this point, but I strongly suspect it's gonna be worth it after that little blast.

Ha, so not only are the FOCBOXs set up in baby mode, it turns out the remote (Maytech MINI) defaults to slow mode as well.....

So in fast (remote) mode, even 40A motor max is insane (I have nothing to compare against). I'm told I can increase this to 80A per motor in BLDC Tool, but that is surely only going to increase power and torque, not top end speed.... right ? 

Also, I haven't set it up as sensored yet, nor tried FOC mode.

I know there are tonnes of BLDC threads out there, but which one is you favourite to learn from ? I still have a LOT of reading to do before I start tinkering again :)

glad to hear you are enjoying the board :slight_smile:

yes upping the motor amps will up the torque.

the slow mode on the remote is awesome for letting friends have a go. There is also a way to have the remote monitor the battery levels too - did i send you the wiring diagram?

Hi, and yes..... ! Just adding grip tape before going anywhere further than a few hundred meters from my factory ! Very please dwith how it's looking so far. Pics later today.

Don't think I'll be letting friends have a go even in slow mode any time soon. Way too fast for a novice unless they actually know how to skate :) 

Don't think you sent me that diagram. Can you forward it on to me when you get a min please ?

is this a stupid idea ?

![20180425_161545_resized|690x388](upload://oaw3WZvijjvNBkfD8y3ZVlgZUJ0.jpg)

It's basically 5mm 3M backed foam cutout to hold the FOCBOXs in place and stop them moving around. However, I did all this weeks ago before seeing other threads where the vescs are in heatsink metal boxes. Have I essentially made an insulating blanket around a product that definietly needs circulating air around it, or does the heat escape from the top of the unit, not the sides ?

I only ask as it looks neat and tidy in the enclosure, and I like that, but not at the expense of the vescs.

Maybe I've answered my own question, or am I worrying about nothing ?

I would say test it out up a hill with and without it. See how long that foam hold the heat. If it retains heat like a Hawaiian Punch, then it may be a problem when the Focboxes are working hard and trying to cool down.

thanks. I live in flat-land though. Not a hill of any sort for miles around here other than the gentlest of gentle inclines. How much heat do the FOCBOXs generate anyway. Should they get hot onthe flat, or only when working really hard ?

I've been running around testing and familiarizing myself with this board for a while now, using easy settings recommended by @DavidBanner 

The battery is a 10s5p and the original settings were on these screenshots below : 

MASTER: 

![MASTER%20MC%201|690x388](upload://pecdkYsTJqG3THsM3fWFa7Icadn.jpg)
![MASTER%20MD%201|690x388](upload://ztdanw3xc88mP2oPL1MyfBEt54V.jpg)

SLAVE: 

![SLAVE%20MC%201|690x388](upload://ArHSqfTygKrISxo5byIqJ5Dgtt3.jpg)
![SLAVE%20MD%201|690x388](upload://pRblKdU5ONwHpq3rzA7CGcG6euj.jpg)

with SLAVE APP CONFIG set to: 

![SLAVE%20APP%20CONFIG%201|690x388](upload://e6KYXFAe3ax1cydocTQisxC3o4l.jpg)

As this is my first electric skateboard it was suggested I keep the Motor Max at 40A just to get used to things, and to be fair the performance was pretty amazing at that. Of course I have no point of reference, but I like speed, especially on a board of some description, powered or not (my gravity powered record on snow is currently 78kph - about 48mph).

So, this morning, finally, I've cracked open the enclosure and done the BLDC thing, tweaking the settings to 80A Motor Max, and increased the Battery Min (regen) to -14A as I'm quite heavy at 95KG so felt a little more punch in the braking wouldn't go amiss. Ran the Motor Detection process and Write Config at every step, and left everything else as it was. My APP CONFIG works and the MASTER / SLAVE connection via CANBUS is working OK.

Here are the new screenshots. I've bench tested everything and it seems to be working OK as before. You can tell a different 'note' to the motor sound, presumably due to the increase in Motor Max (?) but other than that I think I'm good to go....?

Please can someone more learned than me cast their eye over these new settings and either give me the GREEN LIGHT or suggest some tweaks that I might have missed / overlooked ? 

MASTER MOD #1 

![MASTER%20MC%202%20MODDED|690x388](upload://kcoao1HD8Ch4C8mlP5yY9W2VM7H.jpg)

SLAVE MOD #1 

![SLAVE%20MC%202%20MODDED|690x388](upload://qoLklFptpGQnFYjhqvoPZ2V3tDY.jpg)

One last thing. I have a BT Module currently unconnected on my desk. Could someone please post a recommended YT tutorial for setting it up as I can only find conflicting advice online regarding it's implementation ? Thanks again.

Cheers guys :beer::beer:

Regarding the BT Module...

I can't get this to connect, to either ESC Monitor or BLDC Tool Apps.

I checked the wiring, especially the TX > RX swap over, and all good. I get the flashing red light on the module - definitely power going there, but don't know whether the light is good or bad.

Searching for BT Devices on my phone, either within the APP or just through settings, draws a blank. 

I have attached it to my Slave (checking just UART on the App Config page as per tutorial) and also tried via the Master (PPM and UART). Still can't see it as a device on the phone.

I must be overlooking something here....? Any suggestions ? Thanks.

Edit : my phone is Android S8+ running 8.0.0 FW if that makes any difference

Android has made some updates to the OS which is causing low power BT modules to not work. Do you have an iOS device or a device running an earlier version of Android available to test the module?
I have sourced some modules that should work with the new version of Android which are on their way, once they are tested and confirmed as working I will get one over to you.


**Re FOCBOX settings:**
Nothing wrong with the motor settings you posted, but I would recommend setting the motor min to -80A.

On the App config page:
* Ensure the ‚ÄúSend status over can‚Äù is OFF on the master
* Ensure the ‚ÄúSend status over can‚Äù is ON on the slave

Re Motor Detection:
Once you have done the motor detection there is no need to re-do it unless you change the phase leads around, and also always do motor detection without the belt attached to the wheel pulleys.

Re Remote: you have the maytech mini remote right? do you know about the fast/slow mode on the remote? Oh and also there is a way to get the board battery pack levels displayed on the remote too  - let me know if you don't have that info and I will post a wiring diagram

Thanks man. I have got an old S5 somewhere. I'll dig it out and see if that works.

I did wonder about the Motor MIn Value, which was one of the reasons for posting these shots. I've seen non-symetrical values before, but with no confirmation of whether they're correct or not. Out of interest, why does it need to be -80A, other than the 'because it does' reason :) ?

CAN works fine and those settings are already input.

Now you're worrying me as I've alway done Motor Detection with the belts ON. What's the reason for not doing, and have I put anything at risk by running MD assembled ?

I do have the Maytech Mini. Yes I know about the Fast / Slow modes, and only ever used Fast after the first test run :) 

Can you post a wire diagram for the battery level info. I checked and don't have it here from your earlier emails.

Cheers for your quick reply btw ! :+1:

OK, tried the S5 and it can see a device called CC41-A but then when you tried to connect, the first time it says "can't communicate with CC41-A", and then all subsequent efforts say "pairing rejected by CC41-A"

Do I have a duff module ?

thats the motor rated max and it its easier to leave it set to 80 and drop the batt min. perfectly fine to have a lower value though :)

no you wont damage the motor but the readings may be a little inaccurate.

probably not, they dont pair but should be visible in the app. i use the ackmanic app

Ok thanks.

I'll redo to BLDC thing with belts off, as change Motor Min to -80A. 

Battery max at 25A is fine though?

Also, I set the Cut Off Start 35V - End 33V. I'm right in thinking lower values squeeze more range, but risk damaging the cells as they discharge down to nominal 32V..... hence having this value a little higher as a safety buffer?

Cheers for the Maytech info in advance.

I also have the ackmanic app and was using this earlier whilst trying (and failing) to connect. Module not visible on my S7 or new S8+ but visible on old S5. However, couldn't pair, but also no info on the app, just blank screen and ".....scanning" was displayed.

I'll try again later - board is at work on desk, and I'm not :)

perfect, keep it under 30a and you will be golden.

Cut Off Start 35V - End 33V.

Those are nice and conservative figures, but you have a 10S5P pack with plenty of range so it makes perfect sense to keep it like that and keep the battery in great condition.

mm, that is a little odd, the S7 and S8 I would expect that behavior if you have been letting the OS update itself the S5 is a little strange if the os is less than 8.0

I will arrange a care package for you with one of the new BT modules that are incoming and I was also going to send you some lights to try out along with mounting brackets - I have been working on a lighting solution for a few months now, I am really happy with the results but would value a second opinion. The lights are powered by the board's battery pack so you will need to add a step down converted to get 12v to power the lights.

since its possible to hook up any 10S battery (without having to use a maytech vesc as stated in the manual) to the receivers GND and 42V pins to have the remote indicate battery status, its advised by maytech to connect a 10K resistor to the positive side between the battery and receiver.

Wow cheers mate. I'll fit them straight away ! I took mine off as they rattled too much without any dampening. Looking forward to seeing your solution ! Will test and report back. I have a step down converter in my tool box awaiting fitting, this will give me the push to use it :)

the rattling is a nightmare but what really put me off anything top mounted is safety, all of the lights I have tested that worked well with an internal battery were big and chunky with lots of pointed edges - not the sort of thing I would like hitting my body at high speed.

My lights were under the nose either side of the truck, but rattled on the underside of the deck. Some self adhesive foam like what I lined my enclosure with stuck to the deck there would stop the rattling I think, but since I haven't ridden at night yet I haven't been bothered to try it out.

Curious to see your solution...

Regarding the Cut Off Start voltage, I'm happy to leave it where it is since my range is more than enough. I do wonder though now if Evolve boards have a stupidly low cut off value to allow them to eek out 25 miles on a charge.... But then their long term battery problems are well documented üòÇüòÇ

This might be me being picky, but painting the wheel hubs of those front ABEC wheels from green to black would make it look super clean.

Thanks ! As it happens the wheel hubs are a little bit 'off  yellow' colour, not green but the pictures don't show it very well.

They're the Evolve F1 107s and I chose them to match the black / gold theme of the board..... However I wish I hadn't. I didn't read (foolishly) any reviews and bought on impulse assuming they'd be fine because they were ABECs after all. Turns out all the reports of them being poor quality are true. I've got a large chunk missing already after only 50 miles or so, and seeing other's online only serves to worry me further about their lifespan. The compound is super soft, and I've only ever ridden on smooth tarmac so for them to chunk like they have, on ¬£130 wheels is bad in my opinion.

Might buy the black / green ones when these get too bad, or shave a 45 degree angle to clean them up... 

Apart from that though I'm VERY happy with the way the board turned out, and I can't wait to test ride the new 80A motor max settings !!!
