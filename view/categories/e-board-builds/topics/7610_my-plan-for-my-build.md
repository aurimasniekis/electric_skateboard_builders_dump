Hello I am currently in the planning phase of my electric longboard and wanted the opinion of others. This is my first build ever and I have decided to do a dual drive. My plan is...

caliber trucks
enertion motor mount
90 mm flywheels
2 vescs from enertion
2 8000 mAh 30c zippy batteries
14 teeth and 30 teeth pulleys

and either
ntm prop drive 270 kv (which I can't seem to find anywhere)
turnigy sk3 280 kv (back ordered by seems like a good buy)
Turnigy g160 290kv (again back ordered but a good buy)
Alien power systems 270 kv hev (my favorite but currently out of stock)

I am open to advice and suggestions

What voltage are you running? Those are really high kv and will probably be over the rpm limit for vesc.

@nick191 I think that is under the rpm limit which is good. Maybe check with @chaka just in case.

depending on how heavy you are, you are going to have some heat problems with vesc and 6s with that motor

I don't know much about this. What do you mean what voltage am I running? And what is an rpm limit exactly?

Your battery voltage. Is it 10S, 6S? The ERPM limit is 60,000 and if your setup has a kv that is too high the DRV chip on the vesc may blow.
