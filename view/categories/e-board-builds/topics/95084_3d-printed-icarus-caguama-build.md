Here's the CAD:

Will upload enclosures and pulley cover files to thingiverse soon.

By the way, if anyone is trying to design enclosures for an Icarus; the perfect radius of the concave is 770mm

I’m curious. How did you measure that?

Took two rulers and measured three points along the concave, then used those three points to define a circle in Fusion 360

Well done @Apolo!

What type of plastic did you use to print them? I'm too afraid to mount 3D printed enclosures.

I used PETG to print my enclosures.

Thanks!
I printed in ProtoPasta's High Temp PLA. 
This in itself was challenging, so I designed the enclosure to be as strong as possible:
- There is a 2° draft on the top of the enclosure, which lets it print at a 2° angle. This angle slightly off-set-tilts the layer lines when printing which directs the plane of weakness into the mounts and deck but more importantly providing substantially more surface area for layers to bond to each other.
- 5-6mm thick walls
- 60% infill
- 8mm mounting flanges
```
