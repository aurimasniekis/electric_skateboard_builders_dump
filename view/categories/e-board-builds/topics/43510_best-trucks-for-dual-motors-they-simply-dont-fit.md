I am trying to find a good set of trucks using these 100mm wheels so i can run dual 6355. They simply wont fit next to each other??I have tried like 3 different ones and even the caliber trucks. Any ideas on where to get a pair with enough space?

Caliber makes 9" and 10" versions. You may have the 9" ones. I used 10" ones for my build, with dual 6355s and 6" pneumatic wheels. You may also be able to squeeze out a few extra mm by switching to  9mm belts.

I use 10 inch calibers 100mm MBS, 12mm belts just fine.

ThermalM16 has a set of the TB 218mm trucks he is interested in selling. Hit him up and find out what his price is.

Hey guys i figured out what the problem is. I can almost fit them its the design of the cheap mounting brackets im using that causes them not to fit. I got in contact with a guy selling motor mounts on here i think his name was Marc offering them for $50 a piece free shipping in US. He responded once and then completely blew off my reply message and i am just in Texas. Does anyone know him and is it a scam or legit? In any case does anyone know a good quality motor mounts i can actually buy a set of besides using TB one??

@marcmt88 is a well known member here. He's actually just 15 minutes away from my mancave in San Diego. I ordered a mount from him and had him send it to my Secret Santee, along with a special note.
