Welp here it is. Zoom! "you cant lock up the darkness" 

This is my first build. it took me about a 2 months to get everything and put together. had a few issues with learning how to adjust the settings in the focboxs. got a good solid 2 months of riding before i started having some issues with anti spark switches and now im waiting to try out the flipsky dual 6.6 esc. pretty excited for that. I wanted this board to be able to have swappable wheels  but i love the pneumatics and havent bothered with urethanes yet. maybe next year ill get some popocas or some similar 90mms.

specs/parts list.

dual 6376 190kv maytech motors

Dude I think this might be the most perfect deck ever for an at setup on longboard trucks. Double drop so you aren’t Too high off the ground with pneumatics and a sweet ass shape. I’m  surprised it’s from eBay. Dou you have a link to it?

Thanks! I don't have the link im sorry. I got it from the seller decoysupply. The board feels really good under my feet. I did have to trim it a bit to eliminate wheel bite

Once i figured out how to get rid of the bearing clacking i had from the fronts i really do like these wheels. Im running then at the suggested 50psi.

I had to switch out the rear bearing on thr evolve wheel pully for a regular skate bearing. Also the rear truck hangers had to be trimmed 10 mills on each side. As forv the fronts they require a spacer. I used some sort of rolled steel spacer from the hardware store
