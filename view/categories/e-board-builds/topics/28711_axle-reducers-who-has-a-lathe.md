Mounting 8" wheels, MBS or TRAMPA, on standard 8mm skate truck axles is completely possible. All that is needed is an axle reducer from 12mm OD to 8mm ID. Is there anyone who has access to a lathe and could make a set of these?

That would be awesome! May not need them though. I have found a source for 8mm x 28mm bearings.

Thatv s what I was looking for but they would need to be long enough to span the width of a MTB wheel. I'm unsure of that length.

I have found bearings that are 28mm OD and 8mm ID. This solves the problem so that I do not need the sleeves. I really appreciate your help though!!

AliExpress has a bunch of 8x28x9 bearing offerings. Don't know how much of a difference does that 1mm width make, if any.

@mmaner  Bearing lenght 34.5 mm with a 0.3 mm radius both sides..M12 thread 13mm long, with deeper thread finish than the lead. 
That way the nut will pass the thread end and on to the axel a bit for a good lock.
