Ok so the road to work is really rough asphalt so I was thinking big soft wheels would help but I still need to be able to climb hills like 15% I weigh 75kg Can you guys  suggest  a motor  gear ratio  wheel  setup that will  work for me?

What size wheels? What's your motor? Most builds use 13-16T motor pulleys with 36T wheel pulleys

6374's are pretty beefy so you can climb 15% hills even with larger wheels and lower reduction. I run dual 5065's and I can climb any hill around me with 16/36T reduction.

Lower reduction like mine gives you more speed. Higher reduction gives you more torque.

at only 75kg/165lbs - you can probably get away w/ a single 63mm motor.  I'd go for one between 149-245kv.  I usually use the 190kv, but have also seen some new ones around 170kv which seem like a good option.

I usually gear my boards for a top speed of about 22-25mph (plenty fast IMO).  So if i started w/ a 83mm wheel (abec or clone), 192kv motor, 10s battery, 14/36 - looks to be about 24mph.

On a single setup i would get a minimum of 12mm wide belts = more contact area and less likely to skip under hard braking or acceleration.  or 15mm if you can find them (gears and belts).

If that doesn't give you enough power - you can add another motor dual diagonal later to get up the steeper hills.

Rough roads i might also suggest bigger wheels to help tame the bumps/cracks.  I love 97's for rough roads!  Identical setup above, i'd drop down to 13t on motor gear for 26mph top speed.  I would not go lower than 13t even on 12mm wide belts - on 9mm i know 12t skips no matter how tight you keep the belt - just not enough contact area/gears in mesh and skipped easily.

big wheels - you'll need a board with cutouts like Vanguard or similar to clear them w/o monster risers (don't recommend).

GL!

higher chance for speed wobble. I personally use 3/4" risers and am just fine, but I haven't pushed my board to the limits yet so I can't speak for speed wobbles.

Best to go with Abec11 brand flywheels. 
They come as soft as 74a durometer. 
The clones are good wheels but there harder, even when you compare them with Abec's of the same duro, the clones are harder.
Abec's come in 83mm, 90mm, 97mm and 107mm
I'm running abec 90mm 74a. 
The softer wheels help a lot to reduce road vibration as well

i like risers - but only as much as you need to clear.  less is better.  So i don't run crazy big wheels on regular decks since you need monster risers.  On a deck like vanguard or GBomb - you can run almost any size without any risers.

Lower is better usually, and wheelbite SUCKS!

There are many blocks in town with 18% to 21% grades so I think I should get dual drive

@smurf I'm in seattle too!  If you want a hand let me know and i can come over some time to help assemble or tinker.

What hills are you commuting on?  I should be at Alki on Friday (6-9p) after work playing beach VB.  If you want to come check out one of my boards i'll bring it.

10s8p is going to be ridiculously heavy/bulky.  IMO.  I know @Chaka has something like this with 600-700Wh, but for most this seems like overkill - both on range and weight.  

Simplicity i think is a better goal - skip BMS to start (you can always add it later), and go with Lipo packs that are known to work well.  Again - if later you want an 18650 pack - you can build/buy one and swap.

On any battery - i try to ensure that it can provide 100A continuous (so a 5000mAh would need at least 20c constant capability).  Realistically on some of the 20a 18650 cells - you might only need 3 or 4p for 60/80a.  Realizing that i take the sales/marketing claims of lipos with a serious pinch of salt (don't believe them - LIARS!).  I've run watt meters inline (nothing fancy) and measured around 40-50a peak on a dual 5065 200kv setup.  With me on it (not a light guy).  My experience is with VESCs pretty much exclusively, and other ESC's might peak higher.

Shoot me a PM if you want to meetup sometime!

I've been running ABEC 11 90mm's for awhile around NYC. The roads here are crap, but I'm able to go over rocks and crumbling streets without issue. I think ABEC11 is only making their 90mm wheels in 78a. Still works just fine. Big enough to go over expansion joints, but small enough that I don't need to cut my wheel wells larger.

80 cells seems like overkill but if you don't want to charge for a week sounds perfect. I plan on using maybe 48 cells and predict 20+ mile range.

You generally want to stay away from the max continuous discharge of the cell to avoid heat issues and voltage sag. This is why most people use 20A discharge cells vs your 10A. You can probably get away with your cells, but I'm not sure how much heat you'll be building up after long riding sessions.

You really shouldn't be pulling 80A continuous anyway so I think you'll be okay. 60-80A bms should be sufficient.

which is why i said you should be okay. you normally don't draw that many amps unless you're doing crazy hills all the time. Pretty sure i draw less than 40 normally on my dual motor 10s setup.

I use the Alien Power System 5065 270k 2200W motor on a 15/36 ratio. What's important here on your setup is the low kv of the motor. Don't make the mistake I made by ordering a 500kv motor hoping to go 50kmph (31mph), and burning through it. Lower kv = higher torque = what you need for hill climbs

Have you ridden more than 20miles in a day before? I did 25miles in one day and it was rough. Also you should look at ollins board that has 10s6p using lg he4 I believe that has a 50 mile range. You want amps over mAh because voltage sag

Just FYI, skip the clones and I would recommend 75a original abec11 flywheels.  Ideally 97mm, but 90mm minimum.  They may be hard to find.  You can find the 97mm 78a though, evolve sells those as well.  So does chaka.  I tried 97mm on crap roads and it was night and day compared to 83mm wheels, the ride is just so much better.  Also looks like you're getting an LHB deck?  Make sure you get one with huge cut outs, like a witchblade variant I think he calls it.  That way you can put bigger wheels on it w/o wheel bite.  Be sure to have the wire channels cut out in there so it looks clean when you build it up.

I think the key needs to be removable in the on position. Normally the key is locked in when on. When I find a lock I like I'll post a link.

Rotary tools are ESSENTIAL. I have been beating the crap out my dremel for a couple of decades now and i love it so much. 

That drill looks nice too. I have a cordless DeWalt drill/screw gun and i think now i'm kind of hooked on dewalt stuff too. I just got one of their jigsaws recently when my black and decker finally bit it and its kind of amazing.

oh, the usual. Reinforced cutting wheels, various sized carbide cutter bits (the flat bottomed upcut type), ball cutters, diamond dusted cutters, sanding drums, stone grinders for sharpening things as well as shaping some metals, etc. That's basically my entire collection right there along with a few really tiny drill bits.

oh man. as long as i can remember. I've built beds, shelves, entertainment centers, arcade cabinets, fences, i reframed my attic so i could deck it out and use it for storage, i made a stereo system out of mannequins once. 

I built everything in my shop, even the deck press in which i press my own decks. 

It's probably the only thing i've done more than build and maintain my own computers, which isn't something i get to do a lot of anymore due to my obsession with electric skateboards.

@longhairedboy  hah you should expand your ''inventory'' of board designs even more then!

Something like this would be something new (unseen):

https://i.stack.imgur.com/bohSJ.jpg

I believe with your skill and imagination, you could come up with something more bizzare / unique! :) 

Ive seen some cool cofeetable designs made this way

Though dont know how this might look in real life.. and probably this layer should be layed upon something more uniform I believe..

Soon! I caved on the waiting for vesc6 and ordered a pair of vesc's from ollins. That and I think I have all the parts to do the gt2b mod which the remote is something I definitely want a second person to double check my work. I don't even have a servo to test if its working.

Very cool.  We can easily knock out the GT2b mod in a few hours if we go slow.  I've done 3 or 4 now i think.  Pretty straight forward, with a few tougher parts (the usb charge port is a PITA and takes the longest of all the steps).

If you have your VESC's from Chaka - do you have motors and batteries yet?  This equals a running board!  Crappy weather right now, but let me know via PM and we'll coordinate to meetup again and get you sorted!

I glued 2 sleds together to make an 8 cell holder and wired them up in series. Cut off the 10S side of the balance cable and solder to the sleds. Now you have an 8S holder with balancing leads. Connect it to the battery meter and it'll do the rest for you. 

You still need a charger.So this is best if you already have an RC charger, otherwise I would use your solution

No I didn't have to remove the old wrap. I just slide them on and shrink them with a hairdryer. My tool bag has puked on the living room floor and I'll mount the battery today. I'm also doing a strength test on this vibration resistant pipe thread sealant. I'm trying this out because loctite will dissolve nylon!
