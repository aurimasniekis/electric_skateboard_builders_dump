Hi everyone! Firstly, a thank you to the owners and mods of this forum; it's an incredibly valuable resource, especially for a first timer, like me!

I've skateboarded pretty much all my life but on shortboards. I've always fancied a longboard but just never took the plunge. I'm 32 years old now and I don't get to skate much these days but I have a 3 year old son so I'm hoping that gets to change over the next few years.

I first came across esk8s, like many, via Casey Neistat's YouTube channel. I couldn't believe the speed and range he was getting! So, I did some reearch on boosted boards and almost chocked on my brew when I saw the £1,500 price tag! After much googling and reading up I came across this, awesome forum!

Anyway, enough of the background, onto my proposed build! I thought I'd post my build as it may help some other UK folk gather relevant parts and also, you guys can tell me how much I've got wrong!

This is, to a degree, a budget build. I'll be buying bits each month I get paid. I thought I'd start with a complete longboard as I can have some fun rocking it for a while whilst I gather other parts.

Here's what I'm thinking:

**• Base board:**  [Two Bare Feet Parker - £60](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Parker-42-5in-Pintail-Premium-Longboard/dp/B074QR56BT/ref=sr_1_4?s=sports&ie=UTF8&qid=1509976113&sr=1-4&refinements=p_89%3ATwo+Bare+Feet&dpID=41dP109nRsL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch) (great reviews for such a cheap board! Had it delivered today and I'm very impressed! I'd love to get a Loaded Vanguard eventually).

**• Motor mount:** I'm hoping to pick up a motor mount from @WSB on here, they look awesome! 

**• Motor:** [Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374 192KV Brushless Outrunner Motor](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html) from Hobbyking.com (stock available in UK warehouse at time of post)

**• VESC:** [FOCBOX from Enertion](http://www.enertionboards.com/FOCBOX-speed-controller.html)

**• Batteries:** [2 x Turnigy 5ah 5s1p 35-70C Lipos](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-battery-nano-tech-5000mah-5s-35-70c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html) Hobbyking.com (wired in series to create a 10s1p battery) - will add two more in parallel in time to get my range increased. (stock available in UK warehouse at time of post)

**• Control:** I'll be using a normal RF RC remote for now but I have plans to build the awesome Firefly remote by @solidgeek

My last project was my Prusa i3 3D printer so I'll be printing the battery / electronics enclosure. Some great ones on [thingiverse.com/](https://www.thingiverse.com/)

I've used the brilliant [esk8 today caluclator](http://calc.esk8.today) to help work out the components to get.

I'm still researching pulleys, belts and wheels. I may need different trucks too. Probably caliber 2s.

Right, what have I got wrong / forgotten!?

Thanks for reading guys! Super excited!

First stupid questions:

Firstly, am I right in thinking that I can wire 2 x 5s1p batteries in series to create 1 x 10s1p battery?

Secondly, would that allow me to directly charge them without a BMS?

Hi, good luck with the build, in a similar position myself but thinking of going down the hub motor route. Nightmare trying to find UK based suppliers though...

Check out Alien Power Systems motors, they seem to get good reviews and are UK based...

Yes, you can easily connect those 2 batteries together and then they will plug directly into a bms(there are a bunch of wiring diagrams in this forum just use the search button). I would also recommend maybe 5x 2s batteries so that way the board will be much slimmer.

Thanks for the advice guys, much appreciated.

How do you mean @n_j_a_s? Are you thinking I'm doing a dual build? I'm doing a single motor.

Yes, I assumed a dual motor setup! Sorry, that's what I was considering for my build, with a similar motor, but Im sure I read somewhere that it would only fit on a wider truck like the torqueboard 218mm...

Two 6374 requires 218mm trucks.  If you want to skip using a BMS you need a balance charger which HK sells.

Had a few bits delivered today.

I took the heatshrink packaging off one of the batteries to see if I could separate the cells easily to lay them out flatter as these packs are quite deep at 40mm. However, they're stuck quite well I don't fancy going any further attempting to split them so I'll run them as they are I think.

The motor is lovely and shiny! I was expecting a flat part on the motor shaft in order to lock the pulley onto it with a grub screw but there isn't one. Any ideas? Shall I just grind a flat spot onto the shaft?

File a flat spot on the shaft and you will be good to go. A dremel will make short work of that job. But make sure you seal up the motor in a plastic bag first to avoid getting metal filings inside the motor.

OK, need a bit of help here please guys...

So I'm looking at the Bestech 10s BMS which has a max discharge of 80a.

Now, the batteries I've chosen are 35c to 70c which equates to 175a continuous and 350a.

I'm making the assumption that I should limit my max amps in the system to 80a? This seems a shame to be missing out on all that power? (assuming I could use all that power?)

Or do I get a charge only BMS so I can utilise more of the batteries max amps?

In terms of the motor can only draw a max of 80a?

EDIT: just checked HobbyKing and you're very much correct. The max load for that motor is 80a. Thanks @leonsc.

192kV will be perfect for a 10S battery which is the right voltage for the VESC/FOCBOX so don't worry about that. Also in case you didn't know, most motor mounts are designed for Caliber 2 trucks, and basically all wheel pullies are designed for Orangatang Kegels or Abec 11 Flywheels (or anything with a similar core). Also your deck looks a little flexy so make sure you don't use a long enclosure, and you'll probably need to top mount your trucks to get enough clearance.

In regards to the BMS, in terms of amp limits your FOCBOX is probably the bottleneck. I wouldn't run it any higher than 50A to be on the safe side so a 80A BMS is more than enough.

Also, lipos are usually rated much higher than what you can actually run them at so your 35C cells are probably closer to 20C, and even then it's better to have cells that are capable of discharging more amps than you need since they'll heat up less and last longer.

Thanks dude. Great info and you've made me feel like I've pretty much bought the right stuff!

My deck is very flexy which I really like when riding it. I'm going to mount a battery at either end of the board, as close to each truck as possible, in as small an enclosure as possible, so the deck can still flex without much affect on the enclosures/electronics. Obviously, the bit of the deck with the most deflection is the middle so I'm purposefully not mounting anything there.

Need a bit of help with BMS please guys...

I emailed Donna at Bestech initially asking about the D223V1 as that seemed to be the most common one people when for on here. Spec sheet is:

I remember reading something about changing the max charge from 4.28v to 4.2v but when I asked Donna about this she suggested a different BMS, this one:

If ur going single drive then the second one is rated at 60a which is fine for single motor use as ur vesc can't handle any more than that also the second has the cutoffs for lipo not li-on. Lipo can't drain as low as li-ion

But, to me, it looks like the second one has lower cut off discharge suggesting it's for li-ion?

5ah = 1c it reads that u could charge up2 15c but that's not advisable. Ur never going to charge really above 20a witch 4c also would be safe in ur surcamstants as there is no c charge rating specific to your battery it just gives a potential of upto 15c

I've now pretty much got everything I need to get the build done.

I couldn't help but rig up my RC controller, charge the lipos and ratchet strap everything to the board to go for my first ride.

OMG this thing is awesome! I managed roughly 300 meters before the 3D printed motor pulley gave up (PLA mock up piece, will be printing again in nylon).

I'm so happy with this setup, it's far exceeded my expectations!

Thanks to everyone for their help. I'll get some more photos up as I put everything together properly.

Um what someone else said before about lipos handling up to 4.28 is not exactly true. Lipos may explode if charged that high

Thanks, yeah, I had a good chat with @PXSS about this. He explained that the BMS is really the last line of defence and, realistically, there should be plenty of failsafes before it anyway.

It charges to 42v and has overcorrect protection. I plan on monitoring charge levels for the first few charges for peace of mind.

Yeah, love the Kegels. I know orange and black is done to death but it does look ace. Thanks for your kind words.

After many iterations, I think I’m happy enough with the battery enclosure. 3D Printed in PLA and then plastic welded together (bit of filament in a dremel trick). More to come soon! Oh and I’ve blown up my focbox whilst trying to do the wiring for the BMS so currently waiting on another.

It's finally finished! Kind of! Few very minor things to sort out but I'm very happy. I have it all connected through the BMS for charge and discharge.

Blew my BMS when I first connected everything up (wrongly!). I ordered a replacement fuse and, luckily, that fixed it.

I'm super paranoid about fires. I've tried to be as considerate of this during my build as possible. I'm using a BMS for charge and discharge, I added a tube of heat shrink over every bullet connector once connected up; is there anything else I can do? I'm thinking of adding a main (100a) fuse as close to the battery as possible and possibly a smaller, 3a fuse to the charging port. Thoughts?

Just wanted to give an update after my first month (ish) of using my finished board.

I'm still absolutely loving it. I've tweaked my trucks with some 93a barrels and it's super carvy and lovely to ride. Exactly what I wanted.

The weather in the UK in Jan is always pretty bad so I've not been out on it as much as I wanted but I've still managed to get a fair bit of riding in. Mostly to local shop for my lunch on dry days at work.

![IMG_0772|666x500](upload://uQxHivnlZauFcDkDCA37v4nvNt8.jpg)

I have done one small mod recently by printing a small cable tie mount to hold the battery cables:
![IMG_0848|375x500](upload://plHzlylmGZJyBUF6UfbNeeBVDWT.jpg)

Oh! And I added some of this awesome stuff between the enclosures and the deck:
[https://www.screwfix.com/p/stormguard-extra-thick-weatherstrip-black-7m/40425](https://www.screwfix.com/p/stormguard-extra-thick-weatherstrip-black-7m/40425)

I have had a cutting out issue recently that I couldn't replicate on the bench to fix. Had the board torn down a couple of times and just couldn't find the issue. Long story short it was the JST connector that I'd used to connect my latching switch (mounted to the enclosure) to the white e-switch wires of the BMS. I thought I was being clever for when I'd need to remove the enclosure fully and get it out the way to work on stuff. I'm learning that solid connections, which may mean a bit of ball ache when doing services etc., are much more the correct thing to do with these, highly vibrational, machines!

@eightyeightmph is in the USA currently collecting some bits and we'll be onto his build mid Feb :call_me_hand:

Right, time for a MK2...

I'm after something a bit more stable at higher speeds, locks me in more and is much easier to carry / chuck in the car. I also considered a kick tail but I'm going to leave that for a MK3 :slight_smile:

So, I after LOADS of research I eventually made the plunge and went for a Loaded Truncated Tesseract. I set a budget of £100 and, whilst there are lots of similar boards available for that price, I just couldn't tear myself away from the Loaded. The loaded was actually more readily available (stock wise) too, which sealed the deal. I'm hoping to take delivery later today.

I'll be reusing everything else from my MK1 build other than a slight redesign in the enclosures so I can use inserts and avoid drilling through the Tesseract.

The only other change will be a new controller. I've built both Solidgeek's Fire Fly remote and the Baby Buffalo GT2B mod cases. They're both great remotes but I found myself preferring the buffalo in terms of ergonomics and responsiveness of the throttle. However, I've now gone through TWO GT2B remotes as I keep breaking the antenna off the RF module which then seems to blow the RF module. I striped out all the GT2B electronics (other than the pot) and set about building my own using easily (and cheaply!) replaceable parts.

Using things I learnt from both remote builds I mashed bits together to make this (sorry for poor picture):

![7CA5DD99-DB44-4153-9454-11D2F98F08AD|690x388](upload://xgtEJ7LJ2E9eRnfmi33faK00BJp.jpg)

Although initially I used these RF modules:

[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B073ZWXSMG/ref=pe_2025931_249212461_em_1p_0_ti](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B073ZWXSMG/ref=pe_2025931_249212461_em_1p_0_ti)

I soon switched back to the nRF24 modules when I couldn't find a way to code in a reliable fail safe.

This remote has been awesome and each module is around £3 max so no worries if anything breaks!

As you can see, the new electronics are much smaller than that of the GT2Bs. This got me thinking about constructing a new, smaller, slimmer shell...

![41AB644D-74CB-421D-A409-B3A2607F31CA|690x388](upload://wBc89FeARefV9jc531EkcUgaCHS.jpg)

I want something incredibly simple and small. An on/off switch with 4 white LEDs for battery level. Oh and a micro USB for charging too.

First model was a bit too small...

![IMG_1411|375x500](upload://4Xy2aPbocYWRnPbU1snI3rO7mSS.JPG)

This seems more like it (tape was used as I did this one in two halves to check electronics has space)...

![IMG_1420|666x500](upload://3QQA2LNgoDKcWiLKW6DHY9OIVG5.JPG)

![IMG_1416|666x500](upload://sFHjGLnu7xh6IKbXbTpo58wXxbt.JPG)

I'll make everything available once I've moved a bit further along with it.

I'm also planning on making a small batch to sell to try and recoup my GT2B costs. Let me know if you'd be interested.

Loaded Truncated Tesseract.
[/quote]

This looks great! I considered the Tesseract after seeing Whitepony's build, but have gone for a Poke - I'm just getting all of the parts for my first board.

A couple of questions for you...if you have a minute to answer!
1. What wheel pulley do you use with your Kegels? I have the same wheels, and trying to find something that doesn't a) involve destructive changes to the caliber trucks and b) have to be bolted on the outside of the wheel.
2. What motor mount?
Thanks in advance!

2. [This motor mount.](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/wsb-stealth-motor-mounts-v2-with-covers-and-idlers/37558?source_topic_id=37615)

Ridden it loads buddy! It's fantastic. I can turn much tighter yet it feels more stable at speed. I can walk around holding it normally by my side without killing my traps too :facepunch:
