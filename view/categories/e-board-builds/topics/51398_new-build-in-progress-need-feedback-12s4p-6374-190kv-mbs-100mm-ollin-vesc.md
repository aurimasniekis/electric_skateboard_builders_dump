Hello everyone!

  I have been reading the forums for awhile now trying to figure out what i wanted to do with my board, so here is what i came up with. I'm still unsure what battery pack im going with, but i know i want 12s4p. What's your suggestion? Any links for pulley kit for MBS 100mm wheels? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Where are you from?

You can probably get a custom battery pack made for cheaper

That's a very nice deck

Don't know their reputation but given your location might want to check out miami electric boards too.

Yah I looked at Miami Electric Boards they don't have much selection and all of their batteries are sold out.
