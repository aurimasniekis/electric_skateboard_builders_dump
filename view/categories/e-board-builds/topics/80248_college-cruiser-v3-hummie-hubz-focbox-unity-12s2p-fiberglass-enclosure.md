My original small Arbor Rally build from 2016 can be seen here:

Then it all changed here again:

Well finally, here is where it's come to. The past summer and fall semesters at UF I have been running 2 focbox's paired with an old chopped up space cell pro. Not very waterproof (although I ran through plenty of Florida afternoon showers), ugly, and this battery has been through hell and back. While it was bulletproof (have ridden it every day for almost a year now in its current form, let alone the hubs and battery on previous boards), I wanted something cleaner. 

here is it before I made my upgrades over winter break: ![20181219_223046|690x388](upload://5heYU62q9kpdzAzgMUjGUYojglR.jpeg) 

The gameplan:
12s2p (higher speed, less cells than my 10s3p)
FOCBOX UNITY (duh, plus space saving)
Fiberglass case
clean up aesthetic 

First issue: so this was a TB 12s2p pack I intended to chop up and fit to my own case; ironically it was longer than my 10s3p space cell. You can see how much wasted space (Plus a random xt90 connector?) is inside the TB plastic shell.![20181225_151603|666x500](upload://ujIDjttCkBl3cQ5Ywx0elSFh7U1.jpeg) ![20181225_151807|375x500](upload://nsRJugJC3HIk70unuUbblLRdv5a.jpeg) 

After eliminating that plastic endpiece and the internal xt90, I was closure to the length I wanted. The Rally is a 30" deck so space savings are critical. 

Because the UNITY and BMS are almost on top of each other, my fiberglass case required a small hump towards the back; I think it turned out nicely aside from the crappy paint job I did... It was a matt truckbed liner heavy paint that dripped in areas; I should have used lighter coats. Cold weather slowed cure times down, something my Floridian self didn't account for and there are faint fingerprints in the middle. No time for a repaint though I had to get back to college; it will get beat up in no time anyways!

here are some final images in my dorm room: next board I will finish is my roommates![20190107_201756|666x500](upload://1VcmXcdsBhs283ErpK2njqqO0LN.jpeg) ![20190107_201854|666x500](upload://o6nw8AbPfYH1HymU4h5rv0ULIig.jpeg) ![20190107_201910|666x500](upload://vHmkEGVkCBAryJkuveeKvRWYaav.jpeg) ![20190107_201817|375x500](upload://hkkcDAl0MoN4SjoC3niYIYw7bI2.jpeg) 
Additionally, there is a weatherstrip layer between the enclosure and deck for waterproofing. I will also be changing out the long bolts for shorter ones soon, and plugging the old 4 holes in the deck from its previous space cell.

Oh man... my calc 3 was with this polish guy that didn't know what he was writing half the time.  Somehow pulled out a B in that class

Physics with Calc 2 is also horrible, unless you like / understand electromagnetics.  "derive the formula for the magnetic field traveling through a semicircular wire"  ----> have fun.

I just saw your other build thread, and I actually almost went to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo!
'
I got in there and UF, but going from Florida ---> Cali was going to be a big change and overall more money than I wanted to spend on undergrad. I was so close and waited until the last minutes to chose because I really didn't know which was a better fit for me. 

This was a drone shot I got of the city from when I was visiting the school and hiked that trail in the bottom of the photo:

Cal Poly is a great school!  I have a few friends going there.  Thats a great shot from above!  I've visited the campus before and it's pretty nice
