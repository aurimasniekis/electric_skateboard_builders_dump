Hi E-Skate addicts,

this is the official TRAMPA DIY thread showing how we build our own boards for our personal private use.
Basically I want to build a **Urban/Street Carver with the battery box below the deck, 11S4P, single 118KV motor and VESC 6**. I don't want the Battery Box to affect the flex and I want the board to take me pretty far. I made a simple model from cardboard to proof that the slitting pattern, I want to cut into our super sturdy fibre reinforced battery boxes, works. These are made of the same material we use for our unbreakable decks. Its a impact resistant material, not splitting apart, whatever you do. Pretty good to protect 18650 lithium cells! Ted and I always said we need something sturdy rather than an enclosure being more or less a protection against water, dirt and critical looks. So we invested into a mould to make these super sturdy panels, which are pretty generic (shape wise) and can be used with all sorts of skate decks.

The downside is that they do not like to bend into the curve of our MTBs and Carve Boards.
So I will show you how to tweak them. 

This post will always be updated, so keep an eye on the first post if you can.
I will try to use **only basic tools** and I will show exactly (down to the detail) how to achieve what we achieved.

We will build up an Urban Carver first. I will start using this delicious board:

http://www.trampaboards.com/trampas-electric-urban-carver-with-mini-vertigo-spring-trucks--7-inch-superstar-wheels-black-p-24026.html

First thing we will do is is having a look at my cardboard model. Two slit patterns will allow the box to flex up and down and will release all the strain from the material while bending.

**Now we try to replicate that, using our 70cm long Battery Box Panel, 4 or 5 Ply:**

**The following images will show how to cut the box precisely. I made a tool from old chunks of wood to do the Job:**

**Before cutting the first Slits we drill the 6mm holes, we want the slit to end in. I start using a 2mm drill and follow with a 6mm drill, then use a sinker to smoothen the edges. As you can see my Battery Box looks quite terrible on the inside. This is a single side moulded prototype and not the nice and need one you will get (shown below).**

I only cut the short slits for the now, since I want to try out how the battery box will perform without the other slits.
I took a 35° Holy Pro to give it a try:

**If you want to build a Mountainboard with a stiff deck, I would only cut the slits on the side.**
**We want to try out how our cardboard model will perform in real world, so I will continue and finish the job.**

**Works a treat!**

**lets fit the box to the deck! I pre-drilled some 2mm pilot holes in the edges of the box to transfer the hole position to the deck accurately. A Trampa under board vinyl sticker sits waiting to be attached to this beauty.**

**This is the best method to ad in nice stainless threads into your deck. We want M4 repair threads!**
**I use a drop of epoxy glue to secure them in the deck. Do not apply the grip tape untill you have finished off your entire board! Its the last thing to do!**

**Now we want to close off the ends of the box and ad in a silicone membrane against dust and water.**
**We cut up a _16 Ply 35° long_ to show a section of the deck-battery-box assembly.**
**God forgive us!**

**I use the following materials to continue my work on the box and the battery pack.**

**Still waiting for my LG Cells to arrive (need 20 more to make the 11S4P Pack).**
**So lets use the time and work on the 118KV Trampa E-Skate Motor. Its expensive but of full spec and really a piece of art using high spec copper, bearings and magnets, featuring a hardened axle shaft, hall sensors, a fan for cooling and double keyway (front and back). Crazy spec motors! They come a lot cheaper when you buy them together with a board.**

**We want them beauties to stay alive under the harsh conditions of e-skating. So we will attach some nice mesh metal filters. I found a frying pan fat catcher the other day and thought: Lets recycle it!**
**If your partner asks where the hell the fat catcher is: "I have no clue" is the appropriate answer.**
**Be fair, get a new one the next day and hide your board away for a while.**

**Best way to do the Job: Stick the filter disc to the mesh, using double sided tape. Nick the kitchen scissors (you know how to deal with the issue...) and cut out the filter. Put your motor away, since the fine metal chunks love the magnets!** 

**Hardest bit is cutting out the centre. I use a cutter knife and some patience.**

**I hope that my Cells will arrive the next days and we can continue to finish off this board.**

I think I will use the time and tell something about the battery pack I will make: 
Why 11S4P? 
I want to ad in as many cells as possible and 44 cells would still leave some air to fit a fuse and other stuff. Everyone thinks you need to go for 6,8,10,12S. You could also go for 7,9,11S. It doesn't matter!

People ask me about batteries all the time and here are some answers.

A cell is basically rated by: 
- capacity (**mAh**), 
- nominal voltage (**V**olt), 
- maximum continuous discharge current (**A**mps)
- maximum charge current (**A**mps)

You could dig deeper - but lets keep it simple for the now.

I compare batteries to bottles, containing a liquid having a certain percentage of alcohol (3.7V).
What we want is a big bottle containing a certain percentage alcoholic drink + you should be able to empty it fast.
Unfortunately, the big bottles seam to have a narrow bottle neck, so you can't drink fast enough.
Only the very good cells feature a wide bottle neck and a nice volume. (high max. discharge current and high capacity)
Usually cells having a wide bottle neck can also be filled faster (max. charge current).

You will find some rebranded cells advertised with fantastic values. That is only fooling you around.
They confuse the max. **continuous** discharge with the max. discharge (for a short period of time).
Stick to the big Brands ( Sony, Samsung, LG, Panasonic, Sanyo etc). As soon as a cell has a funky branding and uses graphics on its perimeter be sceptic. 

A good 18650 Lithium cell would currently have:

- 2500-3000 mAh 
- 3.7V nominal Voltage 
- 20-35 max. continuous discharge current
- 5A max continuous charge current

Battery packs are made from single cells. You would read something like "10S2P Sony VTC6 setup" on the forums...
10S2P means: 
You put **2** cells in **P**arallel ( + to + and - to - pole, side to side) **II**
You take **10** of these parallel assemblies and connect them **S**erial (always + to-) **= = = = = = = = = =**

What happens is the following: Putting cells in **P**arallel will double up the capacity. 
Tow bottles, each containing 1L, 3.7V alcoholic drink side by side = 2L, 3.7V alcoholic drink. You double up the capacity, easy to understand. 
If you put the cells in **S**eries a funny thing happens.
Tow bottles, each containing  1L, 3.7V alcoholic drink, stacked on another (one feeding its content into the others bottom), will result in a bottle assembly having still 1L of content but 7.4V alcohol content. 

By putting cells in **P**arallel and **S**eries, we can adjust our pack to have the right Voltage and Capacity.
I will build up a 11S4P pack from LG INR18650-HG2. Maybe there are better cells existing but I still had some and wanted to use them.  Rating: 3.7V, 3000mAh, max. continuous discharge 20A, max. charge 4A.

https://www.nkon.nl/rechargeable/18650-size/lg-18650-hg2-without-warning.html

11S4P will result in a pack having 12000mAh (4x3000mAh) capacity and 40,7V nominal Voltage (11x3,7V)
12000mAh = 12Ah. The pack will store 488 Wh (12Ah x 40,7V) of energy. 

What happens to the other values (max. discharge and charge).
These simply multiply with the amount of Parallel Cells (**4**P in this case)
20A max. continuous discharge per cell will give us 80A (**4**x20A) max. continuous discharge for the pack (11S**4**P). Same thing applies to the max. charge current:  **4**x 4A =16A.

**Day Two: Cells arrived, lets make the pack.**

**This is my Layout - its always wise to make a drawing of what you want to make before you start!**

**We will make 4P packs and group them to be a 11S setup. Since I want my Pack to flex without adding stiffness to the deck, I designed something special. We also want to ad a centre spine, so that impacts would not harm the cells. You don't want a 488Wh pack to go up in flames below your feet, despite the deck being bullet proof.**
**This is how it looks in real life:**

**Now lets go in the details: We need**
**- a sheet of 2mm Tufnol and**
**- a sheet of 1mm Tufnol,**
**- a hard wood profile (10x20)**
**- and some thin plywood.**

I hope this will help others to get their boards up and running faster. Since the devil sometimes is in the detail, I try to be precise, so everything will go to plan. The only special tool I will use is a spot welder. Just ordered a cheap ebay model (probably the one many people would buy), so that you can even follow my work on the battery. I will post my settings and setup.

Wow, super detailed, down to earth and nice build to read Frank.  I was convinced my eMTB would feature lipos but this has me thinking of li-ion possibilities.  

Out of interest, how much abuse do you think the finished product will take - especially with the battery being below the deck?  I know this is a urban carver and shouldn't hopefully get hammered too hard but do you think this could be feasible for a serious off road board or even a park board hitting rails etc?  I wouldn't ever have considered the batteries would be safe beneath the board but with the enclosure made out of the same material as the deck they should be pretty bash proof right?  Could you also incorporate some sort of shock proofing material to the inside?  

Very nice work either way and I can't wait to see how this turns out! :grinning:

I will do a special battery build and will ad a centre rail in between the cell rows. A impact would bypass the cells in most cases. The 5 Ply would be better in that case, its very very ridgid. Maybe I should try to mould a special 6 Ply carbon UD reinforced version. I would not do rail slides! A 488Wh battery pack going up in flames is no place you want to be near to.

```
I want to try the 788 Sunko (148 Euro). We have a 709 Sunko (249€) in Nottingham, which works fine. 
We do not want to build packs for sale, so I will not invest in a fancy one. 
The reason why I chose this one is simple: I want to show how I do the job with this machine and post my settings and tweaks and experience. This thread is meant to go down very deep into details of DIY. I know people have issues because sometimes some info is missing. The Sunko 788 is very common and so I chose this. Benjamin has one and we did some packs with it. Works somehow and good bang for the bucks.

You need a slow fuse for the electric circuit though. I have a 230V 16A Fuse with rating C installed now. Benjamin was so kind to exchange it for me. The Sunko 788 and 709 kick out your fuse really easy. So you want a slow fuse.

Google: ABB C16A

Since most people in the diy-scene only build 1-2 packs a spot welder is bad investment.
I'm actually considering buying one and renting it to people on the forums for a small fee+shipping and a deposit.

Or just re-sell it after the job is done. You could organize a circling spot welder thread. Each time you use it deduct 10 Euros of its value and soon we will have lots of spot welders for everyone, costing you only 10 bucks.
149 € is no bad invest and the truth is: once you are e-skate addict, you will build more boards....

@trampa - thanks for such a detailed and pic heavy tutorial!  Really great to see how you do it, and step-by-step so we can do the same.  Great detail i can see being used for doing this across multiple boards, not just Trampa.  

Appreciate a vendor such as yourself contributing so heavily and helping a DIY forum!

I enjoy building and designing stuff hands on. I really think E-Boards want a bullet proof battery enclosure and really well protected cells. So I try to teach everyone how to achieve this. Dan wants to do rail slides and go down the Ramps.
Team Trampa always took it to the very edge.... We want some E-Action!

This is for you @DanSkates :

Soooo good!!! The possibilities of a board sport with this new technology is just unfathomable. These pictures are amazing and I know for an absolute fact in the next couple of years all these pictures will be of dudes using eTB (Electric Trampa Boards!) going even bigger!! Imagine what it will be like not to need a hill and hit something only at the speed you can roll, and then after you've hit a spot not needing a tow but to just turn around and hit it again straight away....in the opposite direction! Where before you could maybe hit a spot 10 times in an hour you could now smash that spot 100 times in the same hour! Not only will this be more fun but progression will be faster - people will dial in harder tricks in less time. Hell, people could learn to hit kickers and rails on home made spots in their back yards or in the street as they won't need as much space. This is the dream every rider has.

We are witnessing the birth of something very special....so strap in, power up your board and enjoy the ride! 🚀

**This is the finished battery - balancer leads still need the JST connector. I will do that once I made my final decision how to rout them.** The positive poles of cell groups are marked red. The individual packs are rock solid, housed in a 2mm Tufnol shell. The Tufnol shell is glued onto the cells with Pattex. Cells are glued to another with Pattex. Pattex stays flexible when hardened and is dam strong.

I wrapped the perimeter of the cell groups  with 1mm polypropylene strips.
The centre spine is bolted onto the deck with 2 M4 x30 countersunk stainless screws, locking the battery back in position. the Spine is a bit prone in reference to the cell groups.  Balancer leads are a bit longer than necessary to allow the flex - other wise they would stretch when the deck flexes hard.

It looks like ''ductile'' tape to me.. and probably 'home depot' shops have something similar..

so is it just 'home depot' reinforced tape or something more special?

No, its pretty obvious you need to segment stuff if you want the flex. 
The slitting pattern is nothing special, its just that you overlay two patterns and shift them to the left and right.

For an MTB I would only drop in the slits on the side of the Box.

I just started my Street Carver build and I'm closely following some of these procedures but not all of them, however I have several questions:

1. Why have you done a center wooden back bone?, it won't add rigidity to the battery modules or protect them against impacts at all, well maybe just if the impact is on the dead center but the majority of impacts should be absorbed by the enclosure itself.

2. Why did you mount the battery in a horizontal array, the flexible cable needs to run diagonaly between packs, stressing the nickelstrip, specificaly on this particular spot:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/8/a80c2fcfb4ed7ce3ddb185999cef179f9f1f9b64.png" width="690" height="363">

I don't get why you didn't mount them horizontally and just connect each pack with flat cable.

3. Why did you choose a 11S battery layout?, I know you did it to take advantage of a empty spot as you are going to be runing single motor and you weren't planing to install 2 VESCs 6, but I guess the VMS can be easily preprogrammed to run 11S?, but for the rest of us using reagulartechnology it would not be easily found.

Sorry for all the questions, I guess you have a point for all of them, just need to understand why are you doing certain procedures

The wooden back bone: The Box is very stiff at the edge, but in the centre it can flex a bit, since its a flat surface. The wooden back bone will prevent hat the centre of the box can deform. Edge, Center, Edge Suport! 

Cables: The cables twist and swallow the deformation in torsion of the cable. Works a treat. My Cable is very very flexible, 1036 Strands

11s4P: just as good as 10 or 12S, 13S Why not! There is no reason to go for straight numbers and I want to have the space to experiment with a BMS, and other devices we plan to make in future.

My plan is 3D print sections and join them, if I decided to go each group of battery’s will be in its completely isolated enclosure, similar to most enclosures we for trampa decks

But if I manage to build this huge battery this solution wastes too much space, so I plan to make the same indovidual sections, but open and join them with something, the best o cheapest thing I can think of is bicycle tubes, thin and flexible

Imagine cutting the enclosure that trampa sells in lots of sections and gluing a piece of rubber between them, but with 3D printing I can design a solution that looks more elegant, I may sketch something to see how it looks

Would like to see a trampa deck with a pressed in battery groove, and without the curve. Sure you'd loose a lot of the flex, but I'm not sure how much of a bad thing that would be. At least better OE options than what is currently available. The current under board solution seems like a lot of work, and aesthetically I have a problem with those battery boxes mounted above board behind the rear truck.

[/quote]

Instead of glueing rubber you could look at using polyurethane to fill in these gaps. It sticks pretty well to everything and depending on which one you get can be quite flexible. A little expansion fold would help it accomodate the flex. Something like this. (blue = polyurethane/bike tube, black = 3d print/fibreglass etc)
![cs|401x92](upload://98HdHtmcpFhrFROScknW3MZCIg4.png)

This is along the lines of what I was thinking before I made my whole enclosure out of polyurethane.

I like the idea, may be a little hard to pour something this thin, but i have no experience

My plan is something like that, keeps the low profile and integrate the flexible part nicely, if i actually go down this path i will calculate the deflection and see what material will be adequate without compromising the flex and loading the enclosure/glue beyond the limits

The glue is another important point, it can't fail ever since this board will see mud and lots of puddles/rain (flooded roads maybe?)

But, since I moved to another country I don't have much tools nor allowed to do any noise in the builiding I live in, so my question is: when it will be avaialble for sale?
If not any soon, I could also go as a prototype tester/builder(It's actually part of my job).
All I need is the housing, then I will weld/assemble my own battery pack(I have a spot welder).
Also I think it would be good to 3D print some semi flexible case for 2x4 cell module, will hold cells, keep them separated at least a little bit and will have integrated impact guard(s), so we don't deal with tufnol, tapes, wood etc.
And if it would be possible, have them modular so you can easily replace faulty module.

PS Some time ago I was manufacturing 18650 battery packs for drones in the past(+ few for EV) so it wouldn't be my first rodeo :stuck_out_tongue:

Can you give any more info on this please? I've been building and flying 'drones' for the past 7 years and have always used LiPo's. I'd been keen to know more about the 18650 for this application.

You can google everything, people have been doing this for quite a few years now, there's a lot of tutorials on how to do them with basic tools.
There's not much to it, you simply glue cells together, like with hot glue, then make electrical connections, solder wires and cover it in this thin heat shrink sleeves for batteries.
It's good for slow planes, usually you get twice the flight time, people were saying that it's flying soo long that they get simply bored and changing batteries is thing of the past xD
But do not forget this thread is about esk8.

hi , i have use the silicone for your enclosure . But this material make many static electricity   And that disconnect the remote all time !! :transpiration: It's very dangerous !!! :crier:  Do you have an idea of material more safe of this silicone ?

I didn´t lay out all tray with silicon.
Just covered the cuts with electric tape from inside,
than added some silicon from outside into the cuts.
Seals up well, still gives it a nice flex.

unfortunatelly not anymore... the tray burned when my batterypack got on fire...
I think @rich made something similar.

shit happens, but all is good, never mind.
the prinzip is easy.
just cover the inner side with any kind of tape and than bend it in one direction and will out the cut with silicon. wait till it´s dry. than bend in the other directione and will the remaining cuts with silicon again. wait till its dry than reliease the tray and you ready to go.
the only thing you should take care, check in summer from time to time if it´s still sealed up. silicon can become too dry and don´t seal up 100% anymore.

Do you have the electronics mounted to the deck? If yes you could remove the silicone mat and check if it makes any difference for your remote drop outs. But I never heard about problems due to silicone. BTW If you use the new maytech remote (mtskr1712) it's the remote, not the silicone :laughing:

Did you say the old grey remote work fine , but not the new remote black ? I test this tonight , without silicone . It is so load in electricity, that all my hairs stand on my arm, and that several minutes ...

Exactly
In my city the black one is not useable, drop outs all the time no matter where I placed the receiver. The steez (with grey silicone) works flawlessly even when placed on phase- power and sensorwires. Only downside is the big receiver and the price plus weak buttons but it is reliable, that's the most important thing for me.

@trampa did you finish your build and have some more pics? Would be nice for people when reading the whole thread to see the final build :sunglasses:

If had time for that...
We focused on the 2019 MTB and the Orrsom and some other stuff that will see the daylight soon.
There is plenty in the pipeline.
You have been debating more reliable remotes for example.
Tomorrow I will fly to Göteborg to see Benjamin, Mid October London event on the Olympic Cycle track:
Summer swine stomp 2018 ( Hog Hill ) at Redbridge Cycling Centre.

Sorry guys. It looks like I have post it on a wrong thread. 

I'm starting a trampa build, 200mm offroad wheels. Im going to use Unikboard mount kit with dual 6374 unikboard motors and dual focbox.
My initiative plan was to build a 10s5p.VTC6 pack. But lately i have startet to wonder if I should add two more rows. To make it 10s7p.
Money ia not a big issue even though cheaper it's still better. 
Weight on the other hand is getting out of control :(. 12s is also out of option.

So my questions are : 
1) Will it be enough current with 5p vtc6.or must i add at least one or two more parallel cells.
2) what type of range should i expect 90kg myself. And guessing board also will come at 15 kg at least.


Thanks in advance. 

Best regards 
Fatos Blakaj

you can calculate your range here

http://calc.esk8.today/

5p already good
just like the range it all depents on how and where you ride.
if you don´t mind about the weight and extra money, sure go 7p.
will give your cells a bit less stress and maybe also longer live span.

Thanks for your reply Andy.

Thing is that I'll ne riding mostly in gravel and tarmac. What i was wondering most is typical WH/km for trampa the rest i can calculate myself.

15-35Wh/Km, depending on your style and surface.

Like @trampa said.
I needed about 22wh average on flat road with a dual 6374 set up. I think to take 30wh as first start point should be good. Better calculate a bit more than you need in the end. It’s also better if you not always need to drain your battery till the last percent 😉

hi @trampa the laws may change in France. And we risk not being able to ride with our electric boards anymore. If this is the case, have you planned to get the necessary approvals to drive in town, and engrave a serial number for the boards?

Maybe it’s more easy to list here which requirements you will need to have to be able to drive officially on the roads in France. 
The trampa company is not based in France, so I doubt that they know anything about law changes in your country.
