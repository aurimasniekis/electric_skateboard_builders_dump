You need Bearings which fit on this 12mm, easier to go with Trampas Ultimate Trucks because they have same diameter as the Mini Trucks... 9.5mm

Are Trampas Ultimate the same lenght as Trampa Street Carver Vertigo?

I wonder why there are no meassures of the truck hangers on Trampas site for comparison.
