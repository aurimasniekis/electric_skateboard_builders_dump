Hello There

I'm located in the nyc area and will like to share some pictures of my builds.

First of all, glad to see all the interest on the eBoard movement and to see sites like this and endless-sphere.com share so much knowledge and promote this wonderfull captivating and intoxicated passtime that we all enjoy.

**my first Built eMTB MBS Pro 95 , in it's second iteration:**

-Retaliation Mountainboard MB Pro95

-HobbyKing Sk3  6374 192Kv  2750 W

-Dual TB 12S ESC

-12S2P 30C Lipo Battery 15000 mAh

-65T / 12T    #25 Sprockets #25 Chain.

-TB 2.4Ghz Receiver and transmitter

-Custom aluminium Motor mount 

-Adapted UK Dry box as Battery enclosure

-Wattmeter and anti-spark XT-90 loop key 

-18 Miles Range and speed up to 40 Mph. 

The Discharge wires are run under the binding and grip tape using flat wire 10AWG equivalent.

This board is amazing to ride on any surface make NYC streets feel like silk and off road operation is impressive, massive torque and acceleration superb can tackle any hill with ease and super fun doing power slides :-)

**The second Built** 

-Vanguard Loaded Deck 41" Flex 1

-Dual TB Motor mount

-Dual TB 12S ESC, with custom made ABS enclosure and cooling fans.

-Dual Motors 6355 230kv 2650W 

-Custom 44T 5m HTD 15mm wide pulley and 16T 5n HTD 15mm wide pulley.

-62T 5m HTD 15mm wide belt.

-Custom made ABS Battery enclosure, integrated lipo savers with on/off switch.

-12S4P 30C Lipo Battery 8000 mAh, with voltage configuration switch to use on 6S and 12S

-Anti-spark XT-90 loop key.

-MBS all terrain wheels 107mm ( http://atomlongboards.com/accessories-481/mbs-all-terrain-longboard-wheels.html )

Due to temperature coming back to normal ( Cool ) in the northeast have not tested the range but the speed is on the north of 45 mph. i'll be switching the bushing to improve stability at high speed and will try to max it out. attached is a screenshot of a test run using Strava app.


so Range and max speed TBD.

This board is really nice, in love with the flex of the deck.
 the wheels can run over little chiguaguas and not even notice it, just a little hard on the rough surfaces, coming from pneumatics is understandable :-).

i'll post some videos (now that i have a Gopro) :-) when the temperature allow it.

very sweet!

More pics of your custom motor mount would be awesome too :wink:

I'm sure there are people on here who'd love to see how you made it.

the mount for the eMTB 
just use a 2-1/2 " 3/16 steel flat bar and bolted to the brake holes to make a base and attached to this  bolt a pair of arm made of Aluminum Angle   6061-T6 Structural   6" (A) x 3.5" (B) x 0.313 (t)  cut in 2.5 inches long

What flex is the board? Does it work fine to have components mounted over the middle? Trying to do some research of sensitive it will really be in the end on my flex 3 board.

@massy 
The board is flex one 

For the battery enclosure what I did was to fix the bolts closer to the front truck, because the displacement of the deck in this area can be neglected and for the 2 bolts by the motor side of the enclosure I just tight then enoug to hold the enclosure in place but to allow for a small displacement of the. For this I use threat lock. 

This can be seen on some of the pics , the hole for those bolts are a little bit long.

call me crazy but i just see that battery box tearing apart eventually. What kind of wear are you seeing on the box's bolt holes? the battery case is bridging what looks like a serious flex point.
```

The wear is intentionally to allow for displacement of  the box due to the flex. 

I'll update in the future about the enclosure.

yeah i guess the comments didn't make much sense to me so i got more specific in my question. Keeping the bolts loose is going to allow sliding, which is your intention, but what i'm interested in is if you have seen any tearing as the bolts reach their maximum slide position as determined by the box's bolt holes. 

I'm doing something similar on my current prototype as an experiment where the box bridges the flex point but because of the bolt pattern the box itself is allowed to flex slightly outward. as the deck bends downward. I'm not leaving any bolts loose to allow sliding, however. Just allowing the center of the box to flex outward slightly. I have experienced no irregular wear around the bolt holes. 

Which is why i was asking specifically about your wear patterns on your box around the bolt holes.

Hi there 
I have not seen any sing of wear on the bolt holes, the wear around the bolt on the pic is intensional for the box to move. 

The bolt are not loose on the motor side, they are adjusted enoug to allow horizontal displacement only and I use threat lock for them not to become loose.

the reason i'm so interested in this (other than being interested in what everyone posts in general because i love this scene) is because i'm actually attempting a build on a 38" vanguard flex 1 for a friend of mine. Its an informal complete i'm doing as a favor. 

you don't want to know what i'm going to do to the space cell to get it into a more boosted like layout, but it's going to happen. i hope everyone here likes battery porn.

IMO the wheels are perfect for beat up city pavement and all its cracks, the center of the wheel is like 3mm taller than the side due to the dimples on it and they are really wide.

this wheels make a sound due to the dimples, it's enjoyable especially when accelerating.

Hello everyone 

Here are some update made to my vanguard board.

two of the cell in my 12s lipo started to give some trouble by not accepting a full charge and discharging faster than the rest of pack, this frustrated me a little so decided to change battery chemistry. 

Got a spot Welder from eBay. 
 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/b8efe74ea456216bd9d205ea049dd59830de1ac0.JPG" width="690" height="388">

the spot welder is a 220v model and i do not have 220v line in my apartment. i solved this by getting a voltage converted and this thing works like a charm ;-).

Got some A123 lifep04 cells. the price varies depending on the quantities you buy.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7c81df19fc26eb1e063ce52fab1c3b9be0ea4b5f.JPG" width="666" height="500">


the enclosure that the board have was made having the switch to A123 Lifep04 26650 cell in mind so don't need to change anything there.

since i'm using a DPDT switch to alternate between 6s and 12s use. i'll be making 2_ 5Ah - 6S2P batteries that way can reuse the wiring setup in the enclosure.

So to the Cell welding and configuration

First hot glue 2 cells in parallel

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f465edd92f2a0cefb464c3da8ea823303d96bb24.JPG" width="690" height="387">

and Follow with the rest of the 24 cells

 <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/703eef7a2ab47769a8e3e7114592e55a25839c06.JPG" width="690" height="388">

once that is done then cut the nickel strips and start welding cells in parallel. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/110e66125d622fcd21544ce24aad6685f547ca43.JPG" width="666" height="500">

after this just needed to arrange the cells in series to form the 6S pack
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/8f8d8c7bdce9146b75f4bd73ceb525c3a0e51fed.JPG" width="666" height="500">

once this is done the next step is to spot weld the nickel strip to the packs in series and attache the balance lead and discharge wires, but i was so excited that forgot to take pictures :-( so it will be for the next one that i'll detail the whole process.

after a couple of runs with the A123 lifep04 26650 this batteries can hold up pretty good compare to Lipos, the discharge capacity is impressive, a high discharge can be sustained for a good period of time without voltage sag.

one thing to consider, maybe due to the lesser operating voltage of this cells the lifep04 12S pack  don't have that explosiveness of the 12S lipo pack in extreme situations, this difference you will notice if you go more than 30 mph or try to have a drag race style launch. 

The range have diminished a little but i think i can live with that, now is 10 miles to a DOD 80%. remember i weight 205 lb (93 kg) 

This are some of my runs so far:

made it 10.5 miles

went for a couple of speed trials and the pack did not disapointed :smile:

This is another run today

almost crash on somebody today luckily was able to hard brake and avoid that person you can see the braking right at the (2.0 m) mark how the speed change drastically.

had to cut the run short.

______________________________________________________

Beside the battery swap,  i didn't like the wires at the bottom so made some channel on the board and routed the discharge wires on the top of the board. using epoxy resin to fill the channel and secure the wires at the same time and applied grip tape to give a nice finish look to the whole package.

no wires coming from the battery enclosure to the ESC

The grip tape to cover the channels for the wires and the screws for the battery enclosure.

One more thing i installed some led lights that are really nice, 2 white for the front and a red one at the back. they can be get on ebay for a good price and be mounted with some 3/8 plastic wire clamp.

i'll make another post for the construction of the battery for the eMtb as well for the wiring with the use of the DPDT switch for alternating 6S and 12S configuration. this will allow to charge your batteries in 6S mode and use them in 12S configuration without the need of connectors.

The pulleys I got from http://sdp-si.com
HTD 5mm pitch, 40 T, 15mm wide. 
But this pulleys are standard you will have to drill the mounting holes and increase the center bore to be mount on the truck.

Those wheels are what I need...
I'm building a very similar setup.
Where can I buy those wheels from? I think hey're not longer available on the ATOM longboard web.
Are this ones?

Anyone has those wheels for sale?

When building an EMTB, is it better to use belts or chains? Im interested in building one, but I'm not sure which route is better. Im looking to do lots of trail riding and a few tricks. Any advice the forum could give me would be super helpful.

imo spur drives will be the best solution for emtbs. dirt immune, hardly any energy loss, minimum maintenance, most compact! check @esk8 and @Nowind latest builds :slight_smile:

Hi there :slight_smile:

In my case I started using #25 chain and sprockets the ride was good but I did not like to have to use lubricant on the chain is always a mess. Later I changed to HTD 5M 15 mm wide belt and the ride just got so much better, less rolling resistance than anything I had try out there, as of late I have installed a belt tensioner to the drivetrain and this is awesome provide better performance when Off-roading and superb braking without stressing the system. 

You can see the tensioner on this picture.

In my opinion you should go with HTD 5M 15mm belts with a belt tensioner. This will be the more cost effective setup when comparing performance to investment besides you can source the parts easily for any where so if something break your downtime will be minimal at best. 

I hope this helps you with your choice of drivetrain for your build any other question feel free to contact me :wink: :smile:

@Kaly Hi - could you tell the difference (you sensed) between chain and 15mm belt? I always thought chain has less resistance.. and that it is also better, as it takes up less space on the axle/truck, Wheel sprocket also seems a bit more narrow than 12-15mm wheel pulley for belt.

Im running 15mm belt myself ( as you know probably) and Im starting to think, that there could be less resistance.. for the drivetrain.. in my eyes chain had less resistance (at least from what Ive heard) but when you said the opposite It made me reconsider my opinion..

I want to build as effiecient system as possible as my battery capacity is limited :D and I hate that longboards with their wheel size and material, can achieve twice as good mileage if compared to emtbs and pneumatic tires :slight_smile:

My only problem now.. is to decide whenever I go with chains or belts for the new system.. I need to make an adapter plate and get the pulleys itself, since Im thinking just to replace my current board with new / better wheels without building a new one (complete eboard)..

 So far the big wheels has been only a problem for me.. Im getting less range with them and also my feet constantly hits them in tighter turns, as they are really close to my foot at 80cm / 32'' deck im having right now..

In my experience with the chain is as i described above, the belts for me give a better riding experience.

On the range issue this is due to a lots of factors like the materials, reduction, type of threats on the rubber and so on. For your current situation it is better to go with the chain and give it a try, the cost will be not that much for the sprockets and chain.
