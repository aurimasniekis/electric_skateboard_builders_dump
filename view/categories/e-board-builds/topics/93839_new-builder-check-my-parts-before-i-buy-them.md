Dear esk8-community,

i need your tipps / recommendations for the parts i have chosen. 

I have little longboarding/skating expierence, weight about 280lbs, 6'3 tall, 23yo. 

The most important features i want to achieve:

* Range - 40km+/24miles+
* Decent speed - 40km/h 24mph should be the normal speed(with about 70% load on flat ground) Hillclimb should not overheat anything! up to 15-20% is normal where i live. 
* Durable - I want to waterproof it without glueing it fixed and the parts should be high quality. I need to be able to trust the board as a daily used vehicle. 

My philosophy for every project is to overbuild it and then use it at a ~70% load. that way I can be sure that nothing breaks.

My budget is 1450€ for the parts, 100€ for extras(Lights, pulleycover,..) and 50€ for screws,..

1600€ total. Shipping costs are excluded.



My parts:

**Deck:**   LANDYACHTZ SWITCHBLADE 38"
https://www.skatedeluxe.com/en/landyachtz-switchblade-38-96-5cm-longboard-deck-faded_p124808
**185€**

_Stiff enough for 280lbs?_ 

**Enclosure:**    DOUBLE STACKED 38 SWITCHBLADE ENCLOSURE
https://cometboards.com/collections/parts/products/double-stacked-38-switchblade-enclosure
**~50€**

**Electronics:**

**Esc:**   FOCBOX UNITY
https://www.enertionboards.com/focbox-speed-controller/focbox-unity-dual-motor-foc-controller-esc/
**~330€ with warranty.**

_The ESC is the determining factor of how strong the other parts (motor, batterie) can be. I choose the focbox because of the warranty and the ease of use. Dual FSESC 6.6 for ~260€ would be cheaper but it doesnt have the warranty, fuses and the interface on the phone. Is the focbox worth it or is it just "useless-fancy"?_

**Motor:**    6374 170KV 3.6W 80A 8mm D-Flat
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DNWKS58/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B07DNWKS58&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=skatemetric01-20&amp;linkId=c948d644ccd47683c0e5bfd113972766&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1
**2x 80€ = 160**

**Alternative:**   6374 190KV 3.1W 80A 8mm 3x3 Keyway
https:///collections/electric-skateboard-motors/products/electric-skateboard-motor-6374-190kv
**2x 107€ = 214€**

_Is there a quality difference between the hobbysky or the diyesk8 one. Tipps/recommendations?_

**Batterie:**    FLAT 10s3p Eskating Electric Skateboard Battery Samsung 30Q
https://eskating.eu/product/flat-10s3p-eskating-electric-skateboard-battery-samsung-30q/?v=7516fd43adaa
**330€** (60A BMS, On/offSwitch, BatterieStatus-LEDscreen and Chargeport included)

_60A BMS will most likely be a bottleneck for the whole system. One motor alone needs 80A rated current/ 120A max. what do you think?_

I would like to get the 10s4p but its 145 mm and i need 140 with the enclosure.
https://eskating.eu/product/10s4p-eskating-electric-skateboard-battery-samsung-30q/?v=7516fd43adaa
_Shouldnt all the flat pack batteries be the same and only get longer? Can i warm up the ABS enclosure and bend it a little if needed? Can i alter the batterie or request it to be altered?_ 
I can only buy a batterie from a european seller because of shipment restrictions!

**Remote:** 2.4Ghz Remote VX1
https://flipsky.net/collections/accessories/products/flipsky-remote-vx1?variant=22133705474108
**50€**

_This remote is for the FSESC 4.12 or 6.6. Does this work with the focbox? My guess is to just hook up the remote like it shows in the description for the dual 6.6 and it should be good. can i access the pins i need?_

**Drivetrain:** 
**Trucks:**   Tb 218mm
https:///products/torqueboards-218mm-trucks?variant=712802992151
**60€**

**MotorMount:**   63mm Reverse Set
https:///products/63mm-reverse-motor-mount-set?variant=7311941271575
**2x 55€ = ~110€**

Belt: 320MM HTD5 15MM - 4X BELT BUNDLE
https:///products/320mm-htd5-15mm-4x-belt-bundle
~25€ (going for 4 right away because they will rip at 100-200miles anyways)

Wheel Pulley: 36T 15MM ABEC DRIVE WHEEL PULLEY
https:///collections/drive-wheel-pulleys/products/36t-15mm-abec-drive-wheel-pulley
2x 35€ = 70€ 

**Motor Pulley:** 16T/14T/12T HTD5 15MM
16T: https:///collections/motor-pulleys/products/16t-htd5-15mm-motor-pulley
14T: https:///collections/motor-pulleys/products/14t-htd5-15mm-motor-pulley
12T: https:///collections/motor-pulleys/products/12t-htd5-20mm-motor-pulley
**20-30€**

36/16 = 2,25       36/14 = ~2,57       26/12 = 3 
I read somewhere on this board, that the optimal gearing ratio should be around 3,5. That being said, a high ratio is reducing speed/range for less stressed electronics. lower ratio is the other way around. Most ppl go for a 2,5 or lower. It is hard for me to guess it correctly for my weight. pls help me here.

Keyway 3x3 2€
https:///products/motor-keyway?variant=712557658135

**Wheels:**   73A Duro 97mm BLACK
https://eskating.eu/product/eskating-pro-wheels-73a-duro-97mm-black-wheels/?v=7516fd43adaa
**47€**

**Total 1449€**

Its a decent start to a great board.

Those hobbysky motors are not very good. Honestly, dual flipsky 6355 are highly praised and torquey  as crap for a street board.

I would go with the 10s4p for a little extra range.


For mounts and pulleys, i would ditch the expensive ones and go with @boardnamics mounts.

My favorite pulley set is less than $20 and comes with 2 belts


https://m.banggood.com/15mm-Wide-Belts-DIY-ABEC-Flywheel-Pulley-Kit-265mm-255mm-p-1222305.html?rmmds=search

If you want so save even more. Money, the flipsky single 4.xx vescs are supposedly very good now.

Btw, i use dual 6355 on a board that has to move 250+ lbs. I set the motor max to 30a per motor and it has plenty of power for sure.
