Sup' Gents

180lb/82kg rider. **The Goal** is to create a board for mostly flat lands/speed/All-Terrain. Hills are really a non-issue where I live. Sunny SoCal. 

Brand new builder. Thinking I've read enough to at least dip my toes in. So here's the plan....

I made the plunge and bought a $90 [ Earthwing SuperGlider Longboard 38"](http://www.tactics.com/earthwing-longboards/superglider-2006-reissue-38-longboard-deck/black-red) (No Longer for Sale) deck to use.

 I want to use this as a place to document the build as well as seek advice, since I know I'll have questions along the way. 

**Parts List // Buy List**:
$90 _Earthwing SuperGlider_
$100 _Unbranded "Esk8 Market" (63mm)_ ([LINK](https://electric-skateboard.market/product/6374-190kv-sealed-motor/))

Welcome Andrew,
You might want to look through the builds that are documented here to get some good ideas.
Take your time, don't hurry. You still have a lot of homework to do before putting a build list together.

For the Esc i would recommend a vesc.
Two 4s 5000mah batteries work well and reach a good speed.
You probably do need flywheels or kegel wheels unless you can find a way to make a pulley system.
Also GT2B is a great remote very responsive
290kv is kind of high you want something around low 200kv or high 190kv https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html

You will need either Flywheels, Flywheel clones, Kegel's
70mm shark wheels will not work.
To build an off road board with oversized tires, you will need dual motors and lots of power and will be way over your budget.
Either a 63mm or 50mm motor. 89mm motor is too big.
Vesc is the best choice for ESC.
Because it's your first build and because of your budget, keep it simple.
Example:
Caliber II trucks 10" 50deg
83mm or 90mm flywheel clones
single 6374 motor 245kv - 290kv
Vesc esc.
RC mini remote/receiver
6s Lipo battery pack and a hobby balance charger
All aluminum motor mount or aluminum and carbon fiber Like Enertions.

```
Let's begin, that guys said to you that the vesc is your better option, yes, it is, but in 6s. Using 8s your erpm limit will be so high to the vesc and you'll need to limit it at the firmware, so you're going to use not the full power that your battery can delivery.

Shark Wheels, I like these wheels, but they are 70mm, so your board will be so close to the floor and you said that your board is flexy so your enclosure will be in contact with the floor a lot of times. What would I do, I would buy or Some Spacers or buy the all terrain wheels they will be the best option for you, also because it is all terrain and have the Abec Pattern (Buy the right one, bigger than 83mm and with the pattern, Pm me and I find the link)

About the motor, this motor is perfect, it is big and have a good Kv for 6s. But if you're heavier than 200 or 220 lbs it can have some troubles. Like @Namasaki said, search, read and find a build that is similar to yours.

Last but important. Your remote control man, it is a part of your build. Like a voltage indicator and a switch. Seriously, there is always something that you need. Search and find it

Did you realize that the motor he listed Turnigy G160 is 89mm diameter?
That's just too big and will cause issues with clearance if he can even find a mount for it. 
63mm is what he needs.

Okay.

I'm 180lb/82kg.

I've changed around the motor to this [Turnigy SK3](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6364-245kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html)

How about these batteries? [LINK](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-4s1p-25c.html)
I would run them togeather for an 8s. 

There are a ton of different VESC out there. Is there a particular one that is newbie friendly? 

I've decided to scrap the shark wheelz and grab a larger pair of off road wheels. I'll update when I have a proper source.

those are some beefy batteries!
65c x 5ah means 325a continuous current capability. When it comes to batteries more headroom means less voltage sag which means more power more range and less wear and tear on the batteries.
Still I would highly recommend going with two 5s Lipos for 10s voltage and a 190kv 6374 E-skate motor.

Those are for the connectors.
You will want 5.5mm bullets on the phase (motor) wires. Thats what e-skate motors usually come with.
The battery connectors, I'd recommend the XT90 anti spark connector.

The heat sink option is a separate item.

Total your looking at $200 but it's worth every penny.
I run mine with heat sinks inside an almost air tight enclosure and they never overheat.

I know the Weller soldering iron is good, but i'd still prefer a more flexible solder station for both fine and heavy wire work.

https://www.amazon.com/F2C-862d-Soldering-Station-Accessories/dp/B013DQQ4XO

I have an older model than this, which was $30'ish more, but still working well.  Seriously some of the best $ spent on DIY tools in a while.

The interchangeable tips - get an extra set until you know which tips you like.  Bigger tips for heavy wire, and smaller for the rest of the time.  Some good Kester solder (60/40 .05" is my usual preferred).

The hot air is great for re-work and heat shrink!

Look forward to seeing it built and rolling!  GL!

I recommended a powerful soldering gun for the heavy soldering that you will be doing.
Truth is your really need this and a low wattage soldering station for small stuff.
If you try to use a low power soldering tool for heavy wire to connectors and the pads on the bms it will take too long to heat up the wire and the pad and the slower you heat it the more the heat spreads where you don't want it to.
Soldering needs to be done quickly while avoiding cold solder joints. 
I have soldered heavy wire and even soldered 5.5 bullet connectors together. And I have soldered components on circuit boards so small that I had to use a magnifying glass to see what I was doing.( back in the days when we still used transistors) before SMD even before IC's.
So, you really need both if your gonna really get serious about this stuff.
Your low wattage iron needs to be thermostatically controlled. 
A soldering pencil that just plugs straight into the wall will heat out of control and burn its tip. I have found them to be useless.

Considering that you can use the hot air gun for heavy soldering, That looks like a good option.

I'm really old school so I have a heavy duty gun and a temp controlled pencil.
I bought my low temp soldering station something like 30 years ago.
It's not adjustable but it is temp controlled so it doesn't burn the tip.
I probably should get a new one but hey, this one still works.

The little momentary switches are for the battery meter.  If you want to unlock it's extra features, you will have to ad the switch to the circuit board. I did this so that I could have it display voltage instead of percentage.
I detailed the modification in my Li-ion build thread.

For the BMS e-switch, you can use any automotive on/off switch.

Man, let's talk, are you going to use a Bms? Which one? If yes, that Charger is good, If not you will need a charger.

You don't said nothing about pulleys and belt and motor mount, let us know what are you using. You said at the first time but you changed a lot of things so I'm lost.

Namasaki is a pro in my opinion, so you can trust him, but sometimes you need to go intuition!

Even 12ga wires, if you want to have a good quick solder joint you need high power gun. Or else your either gonna have a cold joint or your gonna be heating 2" of wire to solder the end.
Soldering bullet connectors requires a lot of heat.
The solder pads on the bms require a lot of heat.
I used a 260w gun to solder mine and that was difficult enough.

Namasaki is a pro in my opinion, so you can trust him, but sometimes you need to go intuition!
[/quote]


Thank you for the compliment @IsTalo Although, It might not be a good idea to trust ones intuition if they have no experience with this stuff.  I trusted my intuition at the first and wasted a lot of money and wound up making a lot of changes.
It is however advisable to get multiple opinions not just mine. For example @sl33py made an excellent recommendation for a soldering station that does it all for a very good price.

Exactly - instead of a big iron, plus a small iron - the solder station w/ adjustable temp works really really well.

I've soldered 5.5 bullets, 12/10/8awg - as well as small smd stuff.  One iron that does it all really well.  If you are a professional, maybe you'd get separate ones, but for DIY this thing (mine is similar not exact) kicks butt.

The hot air is genius - when you have it - it's really helpful for heat shrink and hot-air rework.  Even using it to heat up a board before using the iron can be super helpful instead of pounding heat into the board w/ the iron and possibly burning a trace or damaging it.

for bigger wire - my suggestions would be to make sure it's clean - add flux if you want to wick the solder into the wires, and put a blob of solder on the fatest tip you have to help w/ heat transfer, then feed in your solder.

I don't do enough wires to justify a solder pot, let alone the harder big wires, but i might keep an eye out for a used one after @longhairedboy mentioned getting one for tinning his wires. 

I seriously don't think you need two irons.  Having a nice variable iron and hot air in the solder station seems like the better way to go IMO.

GL!

The guy at the hobby store solded mine with a normal solder, maybe more powerful than mine, but I wasn't like the pistol that you listed.

I used to have a 300watt Weller solder gun. I used it to solder Nicad cells together with gold plated bars for my RC race car. This was long ago before Lithium batteries. Talking 1980s
Soldering batteries with 300watts made a believer out of me.

Your shopping cart looks good so far but you do still need a couple things.
12ga silicone wire to extend the main battery wires and some some 18ga silicone wire to extend the E-switch wires

You will also need shrink tube of various sizes.

Not much without the deck but you could start by fitting the motor mount to the trucks. 
Also, depending on what deck your using, you may need risers to prevent wheel bite and to give ample clearance for motors and enclosure.
And check your battery packs for nominal voltage and balance.

Your gonna love those WFB pivot cups. They're self lubricated so they never make those annoying squeaky sounds that stock pivot cups make.
On the Krank bushings, you start with them hand tight (snug) and then tighten them 1/2 turn at a time up to 2 turns as needed until you find that perfect balance of lean and stability.

Oh, one thing I forgot, you need bearing spacers for your wheels so that you can tighten the bearings down without causing the wheels to bind.
I use these heavy duty spacers and they are the bomb!
