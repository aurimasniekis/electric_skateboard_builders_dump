I'm pretty fond of my Hi5ber Overtaker with the micro-drop and concave shape.

I am a set up junkie. I switch my decks a lot. Granted I get and own a lot of boards dutue my sport (downhill).

Favourite boards out of many. In no particular order.

1.) [The racer -  Bombsquad pocket ace.](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c7/5b/cb/c75bcb986b3099704c1bfee21f2c81aa--longboard-decks-pockets.jpg)

2.) [Locked in to the maximum -  Vecter original](https://originalskateboards.com/product/vecter-deck/)

3.) [Compromise for comfort - Jet vulcan kick 37.7](http://www.jetskateboards.com/?page_id=670)

4.) [The cruiser with kicktail -  BC barracuda](https://www.sickboards.nl/2000-large_default/bc-barracuda-deck-only.jpg)

Definitely the Loaded Tan Tien. Feels like floating on a god damn cloud. Next product I'm going to do is definitely going to be a dual belt drive with a bamboo composite deck just like the Loaded Tan Tien. It's just too fun and confidence inspiring!

Made one with eatch deck ye.
Weight is fairly light / average. Have no number for you though.

The Jet vulcan is great. Gives you alot for the somewhat cheap price, can definetly recommend it.

So everyone is aware

Vanguard was 2002 the first flex deck of its kind

Dervish sama was 2007 and is a drop through vanguard with beefed up noses. Loaded made a few beta vanguards as drop through, but the boards cracked down the center when struck on the nose or tail, so loaded reinforced it. And the dervish sama was born

Tan Tein was 2011(I think) and is a Dervish sama with functional kicks

2015 the Icarus...all that shoved into one board... With variable mid section concave and wheel flares

I've ridden them all except the Icarus which will be here Friday. And it will be my next build. There's nothing quite like vertically laminated bamboo.

Yep. Quite nothing like them for sure. My roommate had an Icarus, and although I couldn't push board to save my life, the downhill coasting of the deck was just superb. My memory sucks, so I'm not able to get an idea about how it compares to the Tan Tien.

I'm hoping amazeballs. Like all of its predecessor. 

BTW another FYI:
Loaded is vertical laminated bamboo flex decks
Rayne is vertically laminated bamboo speedboards 

If your like me an only ride bamboo and need a speedboard (Freeride/DH) check out Rayne.

Losten to this guy. Lol

Rayne makes awesome boards (no wonder our local hero and wolrd champion also rides rayne). Their lineup is so divers that for all skill levels, needs and budgets you get a sick ride. 

Fortune v3 especially (dee-lite if you can afford it) has so far been my favourite board together with landyachtz Ramathorn. They have been the most amazing boards I ever had.

Ughhh now I want a Rayne... since I want to bring a decent board to prosumers for a reasonable price (1000 USD) I'll likely develop my own bamboo composite deck somewhere in China. Then I'll have the board assembled in the US. A big part in electric skateboards is that flex, which really does make you feel more confident when you ride. As such, Hopefully I can develop an easily replicable layup. The one from DIYEboard looks like a good start...

Didn't know about Jaseboards, thanks! I'll likely buy a deck from DIYEboard and compare it to the Tan Tien. There's not a lot of talk about their "Vanguard clone". If I'm spending money, it might as well be invested into something that may give me a clue towards how developed Chinese hybrid layups really are.

Honestly don't.  Not worth the money. There is more to a deck tzan pressed wood in a shape...

To the point you made above that flex decks give more confidence. This is subjective I believe.
Give me my set up (rayne v3, ronin light) and I will push for 55+. Put me on any flex deck with the same trucks and I would freak the fuq out at 35. Flex is great for comfort, pumping, flow carving and personal riding styles. But for pure stability, controle and with that confidence, a rockered, stiff top mount deck is unbeat in my opinion.

Stability at speed is ruled by solid decks, for sure. However I imagine most consumers will want a deck that performs optimally at 15-25 mph, so think rough campus walks, rough streets with tons of traffic, etc. I entirely agree with you however that a solid deck is better for faster speeds. However I think companies are missing out big time by just running with cheap solid decks for boards that only go sub-25mph.

Avenger, darkside, and otherside, or bromance would be my choice of boards if you want a kick. Just remember if you go speedboards make sure you account for wheel bite.

Some of the ones you mentioned are discontinued

I'll probably be eyeing the end of the year to pick up a top mount or drop through Nemesis(haven't decided yet), and a Darkside from Rayne..

Esk8 deck? I’m slightly obsessed with the Raptor 1 deck. The downside is the CF lack of comfort in longer rides and battery size restriction. But integrated top enclosure make it so simple. Kick tail comes in useful for slow sharp turns. That’s why I got two of them

I got to try out Carvon EXO’s Landy TenTwoFour deck and it felt GREAT. I might get that

Honestly go for the Jet. It has everything you need, is comfortable and runs 93mm without wheelbite.
Speedboards not allways have the abiliry to mount gigantic wheels since noone runs over 74 on thrir set up.

Also you said its your first, so the 3d concave of an avenger for examole could be overwhelming and so far alot of people disliked strong w-concave since it was uncomfortavle to them

thanks would you the jet over a cantellated tesseract, rayne anthem btb, Original Arbiter 36 KT?
last question lol have it pinned to those.. only prolem with the loaded cantellated and the rayne anthem is 24" wheelbase might be tight what dju think?
```

---
## \#33 Posted by: michichopf Posted at: 2017-11-14T10:33:13.785Z Reads: 207

I love the cantellated tesseract, but I am tall. (196cm) So It is a tad to short for my taste. Also 24`` can be tight depending on what you want to mount. 
Rayne anthem would be a lovely compromise for comfort also. Functional concave yet comfortable. 

Hard to tell you from here which deck you should get. Honestly your first deck will probably be a miss. As soon as you get more riding time you will know what you like. Wait for the moment when you are trying out a deck annd you know it is the one.

So for now jet, since it has alot of wheelbase, similar concave and is easy on the money.

Yea it seems to be perfect for some quick turns, but legit for speed with it having the microdrops and it being a rayne. You wouldn't have a build thread for it do you? Would like to see how you set it up. Did you go duel enclosure? Or a single one? Would love to eventually throw some carvons onto this...
