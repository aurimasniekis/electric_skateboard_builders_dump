I'd like the lowest profile in two 2 separate compartments at the sides of each truck similar as Boosted Board design but a Loaded Vanguard Deck.

Would it be possible to leave the center of the board without any enclosure and use 2 5S4P packs on each side in serial?

Literally dozens of ppl have done this... I recently spotted a design on here that sports a 12s4p for the Loaded Vangaurd. Just look around and you'll find that you need.
