Well after 4 months of collecting parts, I finally finished my dream board. Thanks to everyone who helped me out along the way, especially @Eboosted , @barajabali, @rey8801 , and a bunch of others. Without a little guidance along the way this thing would’ve never gotten finished.

Details on the parts
**Deck**
Subsonic talon - I was looking for a stable drop down like the evo and went with the talon because of all the customization options subsonic offers on all their decks. This one has a is maple sandwiched between a layer of black fiberglass and black carbon fiber, with a foam core in the center to make this heavy ass board as light as possible.
**Motors**
Carvon speeddrive xl- these suckers are fast that’s all I can say. Tested on a few moderate hills and they had no problem flying up them either. 
**battery**
12s4p Samsung 30q flat pack built by Chiboards 
**Enclosure**
Eboosted subsonic talon- saw that there was some interest for Alan to make an enclosure for the talon so I knew I needed to make that happen. Man was it worth it, this enclosure looks perfect on the deck and it’s rock solid too. He was even nice enough to install my heatsink I got from @Kug3lis a while back.
**Front truck** 
Surfrodz 200mm rkp- 45° baseplate and with the 70mm axles from their site it matches the width of the carvons almost perfectly
**vescs**
Dual focbox’s - connected by canbus. I’m running foc with 50a motor min/max battery max 40a. Definitely quick with strong brakes but I haven’t opened her up enough to get a top speed.
**wheels**
Abec refly 97mm - wasn’t feeling the green cores too much so i plastidipped them black. Don’t know how long that’ll last though, probably going to have to figure out a more permanent solution.
**remote**
Exertion nano x- love the feel of the tiny thumb throttle. Acceleration was very smooth but the brakes were a little jerky. Any ideas on how to fiddle with the settings to get smoother braking?
**extras**
Metr pro
Riptide tunnel risers- they look so clean mounted with the woven wire guard but definitely required some extenders to reach the vescs![image|665x499](upload://fxou1VNJ5tnZGK4Dcn9UdK2RrJL.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://nqrNxVNinqOAZ5SdJObr5D95DPH.jpeg) 
That’s about it I think, let me know what you guys think. Can’t wait to take this thing around Boston and to get started on a little more portable build because this things about 20lbs.

looks good, pretty damn nice for a first build.  my first one was a dumpster fire.

how's the braking with the XLs?  and do the motors get hot?

We have almost the same build. Im still building the battery pack for mine  and I went with 107's.

Congrats man! Really really nice. Did you paint the Carvon to cover the silver part?  Please post some metr data. Really nice board, enjoy!

Wow appreciate it! First impression with the brakes is they are definitely strong enough to make me feel comfortable cruising at 30mph, almost too strong haha. I don’t know if it’s the smaller pulsewidth of the nano x or my brake settings but I definitely have to be very gentle on the brakes when I’m going quick. Didn’t ride the board too long because I have an exam in the morning but the motors never felt hot even after I was going in the 20’s uphill

It’s actually an old slick wraps sheet I had lying around that I cut to wrap around the adapters. It’s supposed to be pretty durable but if it gets torn up too quick I’ll just end up painting them, thanks again for all the little miscellaneous parts and the advice! 
@Jreamer really excited for you to get your board up and running, the XL’s are just an experience and on the talon I felt so locked in I didn’t even mind flying past traffic

How does it feel at high speed?

Nice little stealth bomber that one!  Awesome stuff and very professional too.  Thats what an @Eboosted enclosure does for a build.  Makes it look production.

all thanks to you, couldn't be happier with this enclosure! It feels a million times better than the the boosted board I used to have. I only took it to about 25mph today, and the surfrodz are so carvy but I never felt wobbly. The rigid drop down feels like my feet are practically attached to the board, especially compared to the boosted.
@NAF I actually got the bolts, countersunk washers, and the inserts from @rey8801 , definitley pm him he has all your miscellaneous parts needs

Dam... I've been thinking of doing a build pretty much identical to this but swap the motors/battery for the Raptor 2 motors and battery since I just got my R2 in the mail last week finally. But haven't even rode it yet since I broke my collar bone the fucking night before due to my DIY set up cutting out at end up my ride going up hill full speed. FML. Rant.

Super sick build and very clean, prolly one of the best first builds i've seen. Props and have fun. Wear a helmet! Saved me the other night.... not my collar bone though.

thats tough bro, heal up quick. When you're back to speed I say definitely pull the trigger on the talon. Beautiful deck I'd love to see more builds using it!

Added a kayak handle which makes carrying this thing around 1000x easier, also took off the plasti dip on the cores, the green looks waay better I don’t know what I was thinking before :sweat_smile:

Have you you ridden it at 35+ mph? I wonder how stable this board is at speed (vs an Evo perhaps)

How do you rate the xl’s?  And how is the torque and braking?

I just found my next board
[/quote]

You won’t be disappointed!

@BruSkater I ride in the city only for the most part so the max speed I’ve hit is 30mph, that being said I have pretty inexperienced leg muscles and this board is rock solid. I’ve only experienced wobbles once, and they were mild enough to carve out of. 
I haven’t ridden an evo personally. Just from looking at pictures, the concave on the talon is much more complex. The micro drops at the foot and tail are more dramatic and make my feet feel **locked in**. It also has more radial concave that tapers off at the drops so it’s comfortable long distance, but the extra concave in the middle of the board gives the insides of my feet a little extra something to push up against which adds to the locked in feeling.

@CamBo I was a little worried about the torque as well before I set these up, which is why I ended up getting 97mm wheels. That being said I was actually blown away at the amount of torque a direct drive can produce when I first rode the XL’s. I fly up hills and the breaks are more than sufficient enough to make me comfortable going 30 mph around Boston(the traffic system here is a mess too). I just preordered some TB110 to put on the xl’s next :grin:

Ive tried both 12s and 10s.  as well as 97 107s.   works well both ways more clearance with 107s but is very punchy with 12s.    Its a thrasher for sure.    Amazing build

im copying you on this but hopefully improving on the design for motor mounts and a funky paint design 
lets see what happens with my custom deck order

FYI, Subsonic has changed the design of the board a few times, so you may want to double check the specs with them if you're making something.
