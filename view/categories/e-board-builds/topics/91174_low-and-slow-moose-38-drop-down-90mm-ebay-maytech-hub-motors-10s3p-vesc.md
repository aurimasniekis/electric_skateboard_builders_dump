First off hello and thank you for all the great information and contributions to this community resource, it's a lot of fun to read when I should be working instead! I got into diy esk8 like maybe a lot of people after getting a commercial board and wanting more customization. So... on with the build...

![20190419_164258|666x500](upload://hT0mcqKhuACXdQDUbTC4jjH6Y4w.jpeg) 

... and before I get flamed on here, I know I am getting parts that are not the best doing an ebay build like this, but I am doing this as an experiment to see really how bad the experience can be. Can I make it work? Will parts be DOA? What is going to catch fire? I'm not going for a high performance build here.

![20190419_164435|666x500](upload://2xSokBH1n2eLF925HESYEFJfAlT.jpeg) 

Trying to keep basically as budget as I can with the focus being on comfortable straight line cruising at a leisurely 20mph and try to get a real life range of hopefully more than 10 miles. I'm not really sure what to expect for hill performance, but I'll be happy if I could get close to 20%.

![20190419_164404|666x500](upload://wsJl5siObFbDnZGtojsOmIJlyoO.jpeg) 

It's important to say this build is meant to be primarily a learning experience. I realize I have made some choices that maybe will come back to bite me and be learning things the hard way. But I'm interested in how to build one of these and I'd rather R&D and blow up a cheaper setup the first time, and take what I've learned to do better on the next one.

Total So Far
-
$534

Still need to get a few things like connectors, wires and screws to finish the enclosure. I'll also be adding front and rear lights so I can ride at night.

I guess most of all I would really love some input on what to do for grip. I have seen a lot of people use glass and it's really pretty but it scares me and I don't have any good graphic or panting skills. I was really interested in the rubber grip tape but everyone I have seen use it peels off so bad. Maybe just grip tape with artwork on it. Open to suggestion.

Please let me know if you have any advice or want to comment on anything, looking for feedback!

I know I probably won't get too much out of these motors just by looking at the phase wires coming out of them being so small. If anyone has any experience using what looks like Meepo hub motors with a VESC would be helpful! Thanks!

Rubber grip tape is really bad, I tried it for my skateboard and it worked pretty ok until I got a few drops of water on it and it lost all its grip. (until my shoes dried of course)

Maybe a small safe to store the battery in? (And the whole board once it's finished lol)

Just search for "fire" on here and you'll see how bad things can get. The battery probably won't catch fire just sitting there, but you never know. I wonder if anyone's ever taken a DIYeboard pack apart to see the quality of it. In any case, cheapest thing you could get is just a bucket of sand. I assume it's meant for covering the battery in case of a fire?

Maybe cover it with a welding blanket? I know it is a real risk but I am not too concerned. You bring up a good point about inspecting the internals of the battery to test it's construction but it SEEMS well made from as much as you can tell of a big blue chunk of lipo.

I guess I have a lot of faith considering the punishment I've put a lot of electric mobility devices through in the past. This however will be the first one I'm wiring up so...

No wants to say it but that battery isnt the best to go with. Mainly just that site as a whole stay away from. It wont last as long as youd hope and it could come to with a few internal problems that you arent aware of unless you open the pack and inspect it.

The battery is where you cant cheap out. Find a battery builder on the forum or @ least a reputable battery supplier

Amazon has 180mm-220mm heat shrink. It comes from china but its affordable. I got mine to my door in about two weeks. Black, blue and my favorite, cause it always makes people think i dont have any on it, clear üòà Comes in 1 meter, 5 meter and i think 20 meter. 1 meter is enough for a single battery. Just fyi lol

Oh ok, so it still comes in a tube just like normal heat shrink just comically large? Lol, that was one of the "noob" questions I had.

So currently the battery "ends" are not wrapped, I'm guessing because you would need to use a huge diameter heat shrink to get it around that dimension. It seems like right now they used some silicone based sealant that doesn't look fun to peel off.

But, what better option is there? Maybe just adding a strip that covers it but isn't actually surrounding the whole battery around it's length?

Hmm... I guess I should open it up, for science.

I also have a lot of interest in doing a custom remote and also speed controlled under board lighting, but I'm gonna get it working before messing with the RX/TX stuff.

If anyone reading this want's to answer me another noob question, with these two new VESC, I'm assuming I'll have to flash new firmware on both of them individually? Is that right But when running them with canbus do you configure each VESC with the tool for each motor separately or can you run both at the same time with canbus?

Its a pretty good budget build. Those hub motors lack the torque an experience rider would want. Thr battery is cheap, but should do alright. Overall a pretty solid cheap board

I had relatively similar VESC's and yes I had to go through the setup process separately... but at the same time.  It just has to test each motors internal resistance etc..  Tons of videos on the process that could explain it better than me and in step by step.

Any tips about the hubs? Do you have any setup parameters?

Mostly interested in max amps but if you've used them before would be curious. Thanks!

Status Update: Got the xt60 connectors in and waiting on larger shrink wrap to make the parallel connector to the VESC. I took a small peek inside the battery and it seems as if the P groups are wrapped in fish paper, which is a promising sign! Extra large shrink wrap for that comes in later this week so I can cut it open and make sure it's not an obvious hazard.

I love this kind of build because it caters for anyone.  Yes there are better components out there but this if built correctly will do exactly what you want it to.  
DIYE have a bad rep here because of shady business practices but in reality the parts they sell while cheap are nothing that a multitude of chinese factories aren't banging out as completes with great success judging by meepo sales.  
That battery is fine for what it is.  Its an lg celled saggy unit but it will work as long as you don't exceed the bms's current rating which is no more than 15 amps battery max per vesc.  I did run mine on 20 for a while and the bms blew a gasket.  
Build quality on this version is the best from diye.  There were some sketchy 10s5p for a while but even those are now built correctly.  Properly insulated and connections are good.
Looks like you have the ebay maytech clone hubs or maytech hubs sold as ebay clones.  Who knows?  lol
Just for science I ran a set of meepo hubs at 80 amps motor max and they worked but got hot.  60 and they run just fine.  I'm sure those hubs are of a similar rating.  Anyway enough rambling on and good luck with the build my friend.

Oh awesome thanks @dareno for the info!

Now I've got some max settings to work with, what I'm confused about is how it makes sense that setting a battery amp of 15 and then a motor amp of 60... where is that extra 45 amps coming from?

I should probably also update I am considering going with a 1.5" drop or even a no drop deck due to clearance issues. I really don't want to because I love the deep pocket, but that extra half inch will go a long way I think and is probably worth the extra $40 for a new deck.

Everything starts from the battery.  What it can safely deliver.  Thats where you start your settings.
You never exceed the absolute maximum that your particular cells can deliver.  In your case its 30 amps.  The bms and the cells will behave if you don't go over this.
Once you know your battery capabilities then you can play with the motor.  Those things are probably rated to something very low but you can up that value depending on weight and riding style.  Basic rule of thumb is check the temps.  If it gets too hot the max amps on motor is too high.
```

## \#22 Posted by: bluegreen Posted at: 2019-04-24T08:55:31.439Z Reads: 118

Oh so motor amps is like an instantaneous max? 

I'm confused why battery is set different from motor, because... how can you actually draw 50 amps if your battery max is set lower. Is that like so the controller will "allow" a setpoint that it calculates will be a 50 amp draw but then if it sees a sustained load more than the max battery it will dial it back?

I guess it's time to find some VESC documentation.

Nice! I only found out about the evo board shape and the offset truck angles. I'm pretty curious to ride one of these boards one day and see what the difference is between mine which has them both angled in. So I suppose mine doesn't turn as well, but a bit more stable.

Anyone know how long @psychotiller enclosures take to arrive after order? It's the last part I'm waiting on now (except for the x-brace from china but probably going to assemble without it).

Probably the other way round.  The evo is a pure downhill race deck and is set up to be rock solid at speed with 50 degree trucks.  Turning though does suffer but once you get used to it you can have your trucks loosey goosey and still have a stable ride at plus 40mph.

I think you said it, the advantage of the EVO deck is that you can run more loose trucks and the orientation keeps you stable.

The deck I've got has both sides facing in, which should improve stability on both ends. It's probably barely even 10deg though so I'm not sure how much I'll notice it.

For my next board I'm eyeballing EVO or Trampa... already :smiley:

Wasn't expecting anything great, and I guess voltage sag I knew what I was getting into but hopefully with the 4p cells it won't be noticeable until most of the charge is depleted. 

The onan I have pretty sure is with LG or similar cells, is only a 2p and it starts to sag after the first mile.

But, continue to soldier on for a long time so if this does better than scale that performance I'll be happy.

Status Update:

![20190424_191959|666x500](upload://fv1ru2nnwv1ruVeWj2uzunyjkGh.jpeg) 

Most everything is wired, I still need to convert the sensors from 5 to 6 pin, there is no temperature sensor. Next step is to load the vesc tool on my laptop figure that whole thing out. Kind of still nervous to plug it into the battery, haven't tried yet! So skeptical it will even work!

![20190424_192125|375x500](upload://7VsKNQjK6nmEOvvG5wx45JVucsv.jpeg) 

Bonus, I reinforced the receiver antenna with some layered shrink wraps and a dab of super glue at the base.

A lady walks into a sex shop.

The clerk approached her and asks her what she would like. She seems shy and apprehensive and whispers to his ear that she would like a dildo.

Taking into consideration all of the above, the guy in the shop shows her the smallest one they had.

She sees the dildo which is the size of a pinky finger and whispers if they had something bigger.

Then the clerk shows her a dildo the size of a kids index finger. Again she whispers to his ear if they have something bigger.

This happens many times until she is shown a dildo the size of a horses cock.

The lady giggles and whispers to his ear how much the red dildo at the corner of the store costs.

Then the clerk says loudly. Sorry madam, this is the fire extinguisher and it is not for sale.

![image|453x500](upload://vwqifjleXtLBlMHy1hnXJDUlIE4.png) 

From what I've understood some differences between motors is normal, but that's like double the resistance.

Luck of the ebay draw?

EDIT: Ran with 750g motor instead of 2000g motor and got more equal results:

![image|453x500](upload://w3frHt4xDinop1DTM3P71HByMb1.png) 

Not really sure I understand the new wizard that well, I think my motor is somewhere between 750g and 2000g but don't really know where to make the changes in the wizard. I'm probably going to leave it at these low values until I can test everything out and I'll turn it up later.

So I guess what this means is the first motor is weaker than the second by about 20% ish at 50+amps?

IMPORTANT STEP: If your controller has a trim, adjust it to the same center voltage as you get when you turn the remote off.

That way, your board won't slowly move forward when you turn your remote off... ;)

Don't know if I'm too late here but here's what the Moose 38inch 1.5 drop down looks like with a Psychotiller enclosure mounted. It has around 2 inches of clearance on 90mm wheels with no risers. I scrape occationally but it isn't too bad and it's well worth it for the ride.  ![20190422_224107|690x334](upload://uHEyvc3LkI1yNN9t19nS2TVVGBA.jpeg)

Awesome! Thanks @wannagofast! Since I'm on the 2 inch drop with 1/2 riser should put me at the same clearance.

The Nuff board I've got now with an onan booster is great because I do not care about it at all. It can actually go up and down curbs without scraping for the most part, and that's what I'm going to be losing now for sure and has me most sad.

Everything is setup and ready to go, just waiting on the enclosure now!

Ofcourse! Now I actually had to modify the enclosure so that it fit flush against the Moose deck with the lower dip it has toward the back. Pysco's enclosures are really well made but they are relatively stiff and the one you chose isn't curved. I'm not sure if the 2inch drop down has the same feature but be prepared to Dremel and sand the enclosure to match the curvature of the deck.

Stupid X-brace things are taking forever from amazon with no tracking, so a while ago I ordered from 3 different sellers on ebay with different colors each, and they are having a race to get here:

Whichever color arrives first will be what I put on my board. #fate

Thanks, but I'm in the EU so shipping alone kills the deal :smile:

i ordered a black pair for my build, when they arrived they were for the new school bolt pattern (my deck only has old school) so i ended up cutting them in half and they worked just fine

Got the board all put together for test runs!

Switched to a torque boards enclosure because my pschotiller one still hasn't showed up a month later, might have to cancel the order :frowning: 

Right now the hole is covered by neoprene, but I will be riveting a piece of plasic there and sealing it with rtv. Need to figure something about how to seal where the wires come out better. Cable sheath for sure, maybe just extra layers of neoprene to create a buffer.

Drilled through holes to mount and countersunk the hardware. Although now I realize if I want to open the enclosure I either have to regrip the board or have the bolts exposed. Wasn't thinking about that one. I've got the threaded inserts that come with the enclosure, I will probably mount those to the top side so there is no risk of them pulling out.

Clearance is perfect! It could be a little higher probably. It's just a bit more than an inch normally, and carving on this will reduce it to about a half an inch. But wow does this board carve!

Rode it for about 5 minutes yesterday and even set at just 25 motor amps I LOVE IT! It's so smooth and quiet in FOC, sensors work great pulling away from a stop. Rolling down the road with these big wheels and rubber spacers is like floating on butter!

I'll be riding it as is while I wait for a few more parts to come in, but here is the next steps when I work on it again:

* Grip tape
* Threaded inserts for enclosure hardware
* X-brace w/ top side rubber riser for full soft mount
* 45 motor amps
* flipsky remote
* nrf51822 bluetooth

new school bolt pattern
[/quote]

The ones from amazon are new school the red ones that showed up are old school. My deck is new school.

Everything mounted in the enclosure, got the grip on and everything all together will take a pic tomorrow of the completed board!

Only a few things left to do:
* Hard cover for "window" in torqueboards enclosure
* Bluetooth
* New Remote (Don't like the trigger style)

Even at 25A motor and 15A battery each vesc this thing powers straight up steep hills. I get wobbles at what I'm going to guess is about 25ish, haven't used speedometer app yet to see. Tightened the trucks and see how that goes. Need some wax for the bushings very squeaky and creaky. Maybe better bushings?

Is there any way to know what kind of bushings would fit this thing?

LOL thankfully this happened while I was jumping on it in my living room...

Welp, I guess that's what happens with a $38 deck!

While I loved the ability to have a low deck with those soft juicy spacers, the deck didn't give me enough foot space. My stance is wider than the drop area of the board. I think I'm going to go for something like a 42" with a big kick so I can plant my foot there when tucked and also to move the board around while standing.
