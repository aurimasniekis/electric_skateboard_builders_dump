Hi my name is Chris i am from australia and i am 15
 and i am new to the forum, I am doing my first electric skateboard build and would like a little insight and some help.
my parts:
Motor: sk3 213 Kv 
esc hobbyking xcar 120a brushless esc
battery: 2X turnigy 5000 25c lipo battery
Transmitter: Gt2b 
trucks: caliber 
wheels 76 mm koston 83a ( i know koston the price was unbeatable tho)
bearings: bones reds 
deck: BULLDOG LONG PIG (40" x 10.5") 
pulleys: steel 14 tooth HTD belt pulley, 3d printed (ABS) 36 tooth pulley and a HTD 9mm 300mm belt
motor mount: Self made aluminium clamp bracket 

I would like some feed back on 3D printed pulleys the following images are on i printed it seems very sturdy and rigid but in the long run I'm not so sure on how it will hold up  

Also the wheels I bought are solid and don't have holes like abec fly wheels. I was wondering the best 
technique for mounting the pulley to the wheel, I have a drill press at home and was wondering of drilling directly through the wheel like boosted boards do and putting bolts through the wheels. 

For the motor mount i have been experimenting with motor mounting options, I will start to draw the bracket up and prototype with my 3d printer and ether get it made with a water jet or a cnc or even a plasma cutter.
this is a quick bracket i knocked up with 1/4 inch aluminium in the end i will be using half inch aluminium.

for the motor pulley i orderd the wrong one with only a 6mm bore instead of my intended 8mm bore but i made up for this issue by counter sinking the 6mm hole to 8mm at the top and then lined it up with a 8mm bit and drilled it, i was surprised how centred it is perfect, i continued running the 8mm bit up and down in the hole to make it that 0.1mm bigger for the sk3 motor shaft. I need some advice on the mounting of the pulley i am intending on grinding a flat spot on the motor shaft i am not sure on what kind of screw to use to secure the pulley on the shaft any suggestions?

Nice work. Good to see another aussie on here.
I use 2 grub screws and a couple of flat spots filed in the shaft to hold my drive gears on. Just make sure you use loctite to hold them on.

I have tried a metal file, a dremel and also drill press for modifying/creating flat spot on the motor shaft. However the best result for me was using a grinder.

its a good idea to wrap the motor in some plastic material and tape up any holes so it is protected from any particles/filings entering inside the motor can.

Yeah I punch the shaft through a plastic bag so I dont get shavings in the motor, and then file a couple of flat spots in the shaft. I have loctite on all my motors at the moment so I cant really take a photo.

Hi Chris, Check this method out used for mechanically securing pulleys onto enertion motor shafts, this method probably cannot be achieved at home unless you have special equipment but It might help you with some new ideas.

My deck arrived today, 40/10.5". I started positioning the electronics. I still don't have a motor bracket need to finish my design currently drawing up one in 123d and will 3d print prototypes then when i finalise i will ether use my new x carve to cnc the motor mount or get it plasma cut. 

I am tempted to modify the board a little like rounding off the tail an pulling in the tale a bit.

I have never done a clamp bracket, I prefer the solidness of the welded bracket. (especialy seeing as I roll 70mm wheels and the bracket hits small rocks a lot)
I got the plate from ebay.
I think it was this one:

2 brackets from that piece.

I'm thinking of going with the 12mm thick i think that will be enough. i was thinking of taking the approach like the tb clamp mount and the exertion clamp mount. my build consists of caliber trucks so it will be rather easy to get s sturdy fit

Seeing as @onloop is busy I'll repost this in all the threads that don't follow the guidelines quoted by onloop here:

In order to make the "E-board Builds" category really easy to search & locate specific builds i am asking that you change your title to something descriptive that better expresses the makeup of your build.
Most of the new build threads tend to end up with a name such as 
"new- noob - noobie - beginner - first - build - help - newb" this becomes hard to keep track of.
I would like to see each build thread with a descriptive title, such as;
Project Name | Deck Name | Trucks | Motor type | Mounting method | Voltage/Battery | ESC

Example
The Samurai | Custom Deck | Paris Trucks | R-SPEC | Custom Mount | 10S | VESC
```

@Chris_KP if this is yoyr build thread you should definatley change the category to e-board build category.

You may also consider putting keywords in your description to help people locate this thread in years to come when it is potentially burried deep in the abyss of info the world creates...

Also i luje to think about how people search for info on google. They search stuff like "Dual motor electric skateboard caliber trucks" They don't necessarily search for "first build in progress advice"

So having a unique thread title helps more then you might think. 

Thanks
Jason.

Update **

Ive been putting off this step for a while and have been busy with school. 
I sat down a yesterday and spent the whole day drawing up my motor mount which I 3D printed so that i can reference and tweak while I fabricate my final one in 12mm aluminium.

instead of making the extendable portion of the motor mount, why don't u put elongated screw holes on the plate where the motor is to be mounted. that way, i believe will make the motor mount slightly more rigid than having extension in the middle of the motor mount.

I spent the day in the shop the other day making my motor mount in aluminium.
It clamps down very sturdy and its surprisingly solid. 
funny enough I managed to do it all with just a hack saw, a drill press and some files haha.

Well I bought the dremel to modify my new abs enclosure as well as making flat spot in SK3 shaft better. I did that with a drill and saw previously, it works well but not good enough.

Now theres no need for me to buy a saw anymore, I could also etched my deck and give nice finishing touch. Thats what the dremel does and comes in handy :smiley:

Update*****
Ive been riding around with evrything taped on the deck lately but I took action and started building my enclosure. Still need to add the xt 90 loop key and make a housing for the esc.
I needed to wrap it because there was alot of texture and was a little wonky in parts. 

I started with simple foam house insulation

During lay up I put a pice of carbon fiber rail tape, Left over from some surfboard glassing stuff.

I drew some inspiration from boosted and decided to so a seamless wire channel on the top of the deck, I want this build to have a clean and elegant design.

For the grip i decided on using a cork composite instead of grip tape as i wanted to experiment with some new materials and i had it lying around so that means it was free!

then just moulded a epoxy enclosure for the esc and receiver<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/2a3e033db54db86d05c4d2b04163c09d7de5d9dd.JPG" width="375" height="500">. 

I then had a shot at making an antis-park loop key, I started off by cutting about 4mm off the tip of the female bullet connector then soldered 3 300ohm resistors connecting the two pieces together.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7e6eac68cdd446ef609539dd2eec39c644f67754.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/1c6e7c665362ce5bb07972d00595954aef3b5490.JPG" width="375" height="500">

I then 3d printed a little wall mount for the connectors and then just smothered it in hot glue haha

After all that my first ever Eboard was finished!
over all it was a great experience building this, Its not the most power ful nor the moast fastestest board but it was a great learning curve and has introduced me to the Esk8 movement. I will defently be making a second build leaning towards a dual setup with dual Vescs and a custom battery pack flat lipo or 18650 pack with bms but untill then fell free to ask any questions :smile: 

some photos of my finished build:

Very nice build! 

Could you please go a bit into detail about how you made the battery enclosure? Did you use a vacuum pump?

+1 for a little more detailed run through of how you made the enclosures?

I just shaped what i wanted my enclosure to look like in foam and then just used 3 layers of 6 ounce fiberglass cloth over the top and then used a squeegee to dispurse the resin and get it to soak in nicely. @Badkad
