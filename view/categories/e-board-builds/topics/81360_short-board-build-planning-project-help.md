I have been planning for months now on what i want to do, spending most of my research time on the board and its enclosure. I enjoy small boards for their accessibility, 32" and below boards i can hold the trucks by my side and still keep it off the ground to walk around university. Since im also a big guy i need alot of torque to help me up Auckland hills, so I've decided to go with:

Board | 27" or 32" board (Any style so long as it has clearance behind the back trucks)

Enclosure | Vacuum formed carbonfibre shell screwed to board with padding inside the shell and on the contact point to the board (Also wondering if having it above the board is viable since you dont move your feet much?)

Trucks | Cant decide between large 12" trucks or generic caliber 2 trucks but i will need rubber raisers for dampening and wheel clearance 

Motor pulley and assembly | Requires truck help but decided 13:40 ratio for torque

Motor | Since im a big dude im going with 2 x 6374 230kv or 190kv turnigy sk8 so hopefully itll give me some torque (I know theyre big motors hence why i want 12" trucks and lots of room on the back of my board)

Battery | 2x 5s 5000mah or 2x 6s 5000mah by turnigy 60c  with a fuse and cutoff switch connected(LiPo since I dont really want to start building my own battery)

Wheels | 97mm abecs with bones swiss ceramic bearings

VESC | Focbox unity for the future proofing and ease of set up.

Controller | I have no idea, maybe a nano? Or diy myself an arduino remote.

Could get some criticism on my parts and any recommendations.

the BKB Tayto board would be nice. If you are going for a dual belt drive, @marcmt88 has some nice belt drive systems and mounts. If you're going dual 6374, Torqueboards 218mm trucks will work, unless you're using turnigy sk3s which is a bit longer than actual 6374s. 

Wheels wise, is there a 97mm wheel by orangatang yet? Not that i know of haha. You can go for Abec 97mms or Boas which are 100mm. Remotes, you can go for a mini remote, those are pretty reliable.

dual 6374 on tb trucks with TB mounts will fit. The sk8s will not

I will say if you’re going short board tkp trucks are much better.
Surfrodz has a great pair and a few people on the fourm sell mounts. Much more  expensive than caliber but the quality is pretty different.
Absolutely love mine.

Go with TKP by @psychotiller with mounts.

@psychotiller 177tkp + 90mm axles + his mounts give you 165mm of useable motor space. Meaning you can install up to 80mm motors with 5mm between them

Can you link these wheels?

Thanks guys for the info. Found the 97mm wheels on trademe (NZ ebay) obviously wrong measurements now that i know. By the look of things ill have a look at tbs trucks and tkp/psychotiller before i make another change. Also any recommendations for motors? Thanks!

Its a coincidence you should mention that website since i was also looking at this board from there that looks wicked cool with tons of motor space. But sadly not enough electronics room :confused: maybe if i can mock up a small enclosure that can fit on the top of the trucks aswell as have the batteries on the top of the deck in the middle, but unlikely...

i mean they do but do you really wanna recommend it to someone who's not sure? even you know it was a pain. go FatBoy 230's if you want sk8s

How do they handle? Very wide cornering i suppose?

honestly the 12mm more than the tb trucks does not make much difference. They ride nice. Just have the back tighter than the front and you're good to go @Jazz

I would suggest 6355 motors for a short board.
The torque depends on your motor amp settings and 6355 can take the same current as the 6374. Maytech 6355 are really powerful motors.
The difference in copper mass will mean that they will overheat sooner but unless you have lots of hills and live in a hot climate this may not be a problem.
That way you can get normal or electric caliber 2 trucks and keep the board lighter and narrower which is what a short board should be (at least in my opinion).

Thanks for the great info! Yeah i decided on the 74s because Auckland is so hilly and having the extra surface area to cool the motors down would be great, but if it turns out to be too much of a hassle to fit then i wouldnt mind trying out those 55s. Cheers

Well, it seems you fulfill all parameters to need 6374s then.
Hills, hot climate and rider weight.
However since this is a short board build, I would gear it very low to get a top speed around 40km/h.
That will help a lot with the torque and keep the motors cooler.

I’m in Hamilton and have a lot of spare parts for an Arduino remote if you need.

Pretty sure I have everything on solidgeek’s shopping list - just not the 3d printed parts. 

HMU in dm. None of it is expensive, it can just take ages to come from China to NZ so I can save you a bit of time with that. Happy to send the stuff to you now for whatever it costs to order replacements.

I made mine out of recycled kauri and rimu, and cut the mechanical parts out of aluminium block.
