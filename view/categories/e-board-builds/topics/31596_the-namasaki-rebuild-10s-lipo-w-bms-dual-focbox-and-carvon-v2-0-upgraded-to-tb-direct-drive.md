@Namasaki took my board to the next level by hooking me up with his [10s Lipo w/BMS set up](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/high-power-10s-lipo-battery-pack-with-bms/10014) along with addition of the newly aquired FOCbox's.
  [I started with a poor 6s multistar battery](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/landyachtz-tamahawk-carvon-hubs-6s-lipo/9641/10) that I actually broke on our first ride.  I had to kick to get back and was pleasantly surprised how easy it was with minimal drag from the Carvon V2.0's.  @Namasaki was kind enough to let me ride his board that day and it put me on the ground escaping with only a nice knee scrape and some pant holes.  I knew immediately my board was not complete.

Holy shit! "Pun intended" nice build but how many holes in total? I only have 4 holding my enclosure on! Are you planning to ramp this son of a bitch!

It rides very nice!  I have not logged too many miles yet but on the flats it's pretty fast.    I have yet to max it out as I am scared!

Better safe than sorry.. it cuts the pressure down on each bolt and the plastic so it’s less prone to cracking

I just use nutserts/rivnuts and mount the bolt from the top and nut on the bottom,less pressure on the enclosure, you could even throw a washer on there before the nut to hold the weight of the enclosure better! 
Just gives me easy access if I need to get in to the enclosure should something fail,a connection come's loose or something over heats!

Late to the party on this one, but how did you wire your power button to the BMS power switch? Where did the + and - wires on that lead?
