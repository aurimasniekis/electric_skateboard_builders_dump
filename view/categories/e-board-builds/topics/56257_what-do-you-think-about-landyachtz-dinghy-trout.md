I'm thinking of a new build. Do you have any experience with the Landyachtz Dinghy Trout deck?

Can i fit Caliber II and Kegel 83mm wheels on it? 

Thinking like a singel 6374 and 10S2P. 

What do you think?

I'm just finalizing a dinghy birds build and I was able to fit Paris clones 180 mm with Abec 11 97mm and keep them looser than I'm used to,  as long as I keep the original 1/4" risers. The trucks being wider than the original bear go a long way to avoid wheelbite with such large wheels.
