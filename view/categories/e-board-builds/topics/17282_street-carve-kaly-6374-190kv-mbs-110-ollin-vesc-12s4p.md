Had to give it a try to the 6374 190Kv on the street carve set up, just because too much power is never enough :imp:

Some pics.

Dude, that looks so badass! I love the motors, mounts and AT wheels. So clean and simple. Are you able to easily switch to the pneumatics too? Are those 7" tires? Do you know how much that setup weighs? Those 12" spring trucks are looking like the way to go for these hybrid Street/AT builds.

## \#3 Posted by: Kaly Posted at: 2017-02-06T13:07:47.275Z Reads: 809

```
The switching of the wheels takes around 15 min. 
And the pneumatics are 7 in. 

My previous street Carve board is 22lb, this one when finish will be around 23lb. 

Definitely I think for hybrids this is the way to go. And something I really like about the deck is the flex, super gentle on the **KNEES** when riding for long distances.

What Flex did you take and how much you weigh ??..would you take same flex again ?

Does the flex cause any wobble at high speed ?

## \#10 Posted by: Kaly Posted at: 2017-02-07T15:36:55.354Z Reads: 668

```
My weight is 206 lb and the deck is 15 ply. 
My previous one is 16 ply. 

I choose the 15 ply because, I want this board for cruising and crushing some hills, but not for top speed :wink:
 
At high speeds the 16 ply deck is stable but is better with binding, the suspension can be adjusted on each wheel to give you more control depending on your preferences and greatly reduces any potencial speed wobble. 

If interested I can provide the board as well.

Some updates 

The board is 98% complete, installed the @Ackmaniac firmware  and set it up as best as I could with his BLDC, on a couple of minutes I'll give it a try and if need be I'll adjust accordingly. 

One more thing to complete is the sourcing of a durable clear plastic to cover the holes on the deck. I want to showcase the holes but do not want debris getting in between the deck and battery. The holes are a pain but at  least did not interfered with the battery enclosure. 

@unik no ABEC 11 for this baby :wink:

 by the way I had to go LAME-GREEN on this one  :smile_cat:

So nice,with the 63/74's  i cant stop looking at it :blush: , i kinda like the green color AT wheels myself, great work.

Concerning the Holy Pro holes, i would swoon hard at clear or white difused flexible discs or plugs with color changing leds underneath, that are used for the power meter display lights and maybe have an added disco mode or two :grin:

@Kaly I was thinking about doing something similar with the urban carver as a hybrid "urban assault vehicle", because I like the 7" pneumatics.  Do you think the street carver would be a better platform to use?  Also what are the motor mounts you are using?

a hybrid "urban assault vehicle"
[/quote]

I like that point of view :grinning: 

The street Carver is a better option if you want to have the ability to swap urethane and pneumatics. 

The urban carver hanger configuration is just 1.5-2 cm lower than the street carver hanger configuration. For the flexibility I can deal with that height difference.

You can even go a bit lower on that.
I would recommend 3.0V a cell for cutoff start and 2.8V a cell for cutoff end. Then you are still on the safe side and it gives you like 10% more range and also a little bit longer a high power output.

@Kaly why do you use a loop key instead of an antispark switch?

I wonder how would this build look/work on Vertigo Trucks instead of Vertigo Street Carve and MBS wheels.

Are the vertigo trucks wider?

Hi 

The XT90 I use to have a physical disconnect from the battery pack, the antispark switch is good but in some instances if there is a malfunction it stays  stuck on the on position, this does not happens too often but I experienced and it's not fun.   

Besides this, There is the simplicity of the device, the ability of preventing unauthorized use of the board, the second use as a kill switch and the cost, it is just so inexpensive to replace it and easy to implement it. 

About how the board will look. The vertigo trucks axel is thicker than the mini, an you only will use the AT wheels all the time.

Jury still out for me on the nano, I tried it for a day with stock configuration and did not like the throw on accelerator so went back to 2.4 mini remote. Probably just my thumb though so will give it another try at some point with proper vesc configuration.  Have two vesc 6 coming, maybe that will wake me up to do some experimenting again!

Yes, I saw the mounts you are offering plus the 6374 Kaly motors. Would love to get those. Already saw the street carver at Trammpa page. SF Will be a great testing ground. Owning a car here its a  nightmare, párking its impossible, street párking prices to the roof, public transportstion is everywhere, (bike, sk8) conmute its a must. DIY e board its the solutión I've been looking for. Got hills everywhere but also lots of flat terrain. City is very small, 7 miles x 7 miles perfect square. Just the right size to squezze the Street Carve / 6374 / 12S4P potencial to the limit.

I have a couple of best tech BMS 80A with push button 
I had mix results with them so far. 
I had them preprogrammed for A123 if you want to give them a try I'll check how many I got and can give it 2 for $80.00, maybe you have better luck than I did.

We don't stop anyone from selling VESC, since we can't do that. TM is in Benjamins hand, not ours. Nearly ever open source Project has TMs, so that customers can identify the original source. If you download Firefox you want to be sure its the Mozilla distribution and not a virus infected clone. TMs serve the purpose that people can be sure with whom they deal and what quality they can expect. 

The VESC project is 98% Software and safety relevant. Benjamin wants other Brands to use their good name to promote their products and not the name of the OS-Project. 

Example: Brand X-Controller, based on the VESC* (R) Open Source Project. 

*Vesc is a registered TM by Benjamin Vedder.

That is what he wants, fair use. Otherwise bad products (software or hardware) have a negative impact on the entire project. 
As a Brand you should stand for the quality you make with your own name, not with someone else's.

Battery Min (regen): -8A

Hi Alan, increasing the motor amps will (after a certain point) not increase the motor power. Your stator will eventually go into saturation, generating more heat, in consequence the motor will be less efficient and generate even more heat and in consequence get even less efficient etc. etc.etc.  Its a vicious circle if you continue to pump in more amps. Every motor (stator) has a limit.

If your Battery max is 40A, your VESC will not be able to shoot 80A towards the motor anyway. It does not make to much sense to use different values for Motor max and Battery max, nor for Motor min and Battery min. If your Motor generates -65 A when braking, these 65 A need to go somewhere. If you only allow -8A into your Battery, you have a leftover of -57A. Since there is probably no device installed that could transform the -57A into heat, your VESC will in consequence protect the system by decreasing the regeneration to -8A. Its always the lowest value that is effective in the very end. This explanation is a bit simplified, but in the very end the energy needs to come from somewhere and needs to go somewhere. In consequence you can't pump more into the motor then you allow to drain from the battery and vice versa. You should also watch out for overstressing the VESC. If it's a VESC 4 design, 80A is far of any scale.
45A is appropriate, if its for a short period of time, continuous is more like 25-30A, depending on the cooling. Benjamin stressed a VESC 4 in a test and compared that to VESC 6.

Hola 
This are the settings I am using 

Motor max 65
Motor min -65

Incrementing the motor max to 100 will not do much since the VESC 4.12 will not deliver it continuously to the motor.

Thats wrong. Just make a test yourself using for an example 30A motor current and 30A battery current and compare to 60A motor current and 30A battery current. From your explanation you will not see any difference. You will see a better acceleration before hitting 50% duty cycle and the battery current limit kicks in.
So there is an advantage using different motor and battery current limits.

That is true @hexakopter  and thank you for sharing this detail for sub 50% duty cycle. 
As I stated my explanation was a bit simplified. I was referring to the total amount of power you can squeeze out of your system, since I thought @Eboosted was hoping to gain more total amount of power, full on at speed. 
In that case the lowest value or weakest part of the chain is pretty much the limiting factor.

Hi there Kaly...love your builds! Please allow me to make an off topic question. 

I've seen you have built both Trampa and MBS mountain boards. And have used both Trampa vertigo trucks and the newer MBS matrix II. Can i get you opinion on which decks and trucks you prefer? 

I'm just an old school street skater and I've never ridden a mountain board so i have no idea what to expect from either types of setup.

@Ronny_CTS
IMO the 2 system are great the main difference when it comes to riding is the clearance height the matrix 2 are carvy but the straight axel makes the deck be around 1 inch higher than the Trampa, this ha good for off-road trucks but at high speeds becomes a problem. 

also the deck on the Trampa if chosen properly is just great, the pop and energy recovery is great, saves my knees. 

Either way is a good choice, I advise to lean on the Trampa because is easier to source parts.

That image is great!  A guess the only downside for the MBS trucks is that you can't run regular skateboard wheels like abec 11 flywheels because of the 12mm axle diameter.

@Kaly what kind of speeds do you get on your board and how stable is it? 

I'm used to street skateboards with kick tails so longboards aren't really appealing to me unless they have a kick tail. However by mounting the motors underneath a kicktail deck i'm afraid i might hit them when going up sidewalks and what not. 

A mountain board with feet bindings might solve this for me and let me drive around like a crazy man jumping stuff. Still haven't decided on what to do.

@Kaly what kind of speeds do you get on your board and how stable is it?
[/quote]

The Street Carver can reach up to 34mph and is pretty stable on 97 urethane, On the pneumatics is fun but you will not want to push it that hard, its more better for light to medium off-roading, also by using bindings the stability can be drastically improve.

For pneumatics I am currently using an XL version by using a Holypro deck, Ultimate Hangers and evolve 7" tires without bindings, this combine with some spacers to reduce the wheel base provides the best combination of stability and maneuverability at high speeds for my frame 6'1" 208Lbs.

I have been able to go full throttle for a continuous 1.75-2.00 miles with full control all the way even when flying by pavement cracks, waves and small holes. 
Hands down best board I have build or tested for MIX CITY USE, excuse the modesty :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: second to no other board out there, for it's intended use. 


On the other hand if you want a respectable street performance and a monstrously off-road performance plus CRAZY FUN you will be better suited by an eMTB with 8" wheels 190Kv motors and battery on top. This will get you a dirt bike performance, being able to jump over manholes,  small trunks and off boulders at any park, if your knees can handle the punishment :smiling_imp: Plus the bindings are more forgivable hence any wobble and allows for a smaller turning radius.

P.S 
The XL deck is great if you are +6 feet tall otherwise is just too big.

The Matrix II truck uses a plastic top truck. These were used on MTB trucks by MBS and Scrub years back. The plastic is very cheap to produce! The downside was the play that came after a short period of time. The bushing seats for the kingpin got oval sooner than later and the plastic snapped.

We had the idea to make a crazy shaped top truck from alloy, which goes through 4 production steps, is heat treatment and finally anodized or powder coated, so it can be send back to the CNC factory to do the nice cutouts, exposing the 6061T6 alloy. This design is bullet proof and very nice to look at.  So MBS made the Matrix I, which was a copy of our design, not as nice, but it worked. Matrix II made us sell a lot more of our trucks....

If you look at Trampa truck you will see a lot of nice details:
- Spring retainers with specially shaped stainless inserts. This prevents the adjusters to poke through.
The Matrix used a washer, which was a nightmare to assemble.
- 5 Dampas with different shore hardness
- Forged hangers and heat treated 6061T6 alloy.
- extreme tough axle steel, not the cheap standard stuff you will also find in concrete ceilings.
- hollow axles
- A4 stainless nuts and bolts as standard
- bushings in different sizes to eliminate any play
- Titanium options for sea water resistance
- Tons of colour options
- all spare parts always available (we sell every single bit as individual parts)

MTB trucks are under massive strain! Good trucks make all the difference in performance. You don't want to have any play or weakness in the system.

I love the look of these enclosures you have going btw. Looks pretty shit with the batteries on top imo. 

@trampa
Good to know about the bushing seats. I am getting quite a bit of play along the kingpin on both matrix and Trampa which is a little concerning. I do hope you guys take note of some of things MBS did here when it comes time to revamp though, e.g., straight grinding surface/better clearance, greater range of adjustability on the looser settings (there's a giant gulf between yellow dampas, and straight springs), and being able to adjust from the bottom is big plus when mounting ESCs etc. on the tip.

 - 2 in wheel +1 in Pulley or 
- just 1 in wheel and 1 in pulley ?
Thanks.
