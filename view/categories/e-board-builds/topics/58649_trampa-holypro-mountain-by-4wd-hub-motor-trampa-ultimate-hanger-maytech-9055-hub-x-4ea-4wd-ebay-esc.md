I love those hubs. Are they powerful with that esc?

In start point, some smooth. 
But feeling of acceleration is good after starting. 
There is one major weak point. Break strength is too low. :-(
Perhaps the wheel is bigger than the motor.

@Martin How is the experiment going? Are you happy with it? 
Hill climbing?

There is no problem going up the hill after accelerating before hill climbing.
However, I feel that the torque is insufficient for the gear system Only at the beginning. Acceleration is good on flat ground.

I have found some problems.
1. Wheel balance problem
 => I found a wheel balance distortion at high speed(Over the around 30Km/h).
     So, I’m changing the wheel mounting method on the hub motor.
2. Break problem.
 => Break strength is too low. 
   So, I’m developing physical manual brakes.

I changed rear power train with belt drive.
It is because of the weak brake.

Was breaking better with 15cm wheels tho? Do you think brakeing would be better with VESCs?

 What is that circle metal piece called? and from where you got it?
I really like your work and I am planning to add tires on to the hub motor but I still can't get how you managed connecting these wheels to the hub motor.

Naturally, the smaller the wheel size, the higher the brake performance.
I think VESC is better than Ebay ESC in breaking performance

The parts are custom made.
