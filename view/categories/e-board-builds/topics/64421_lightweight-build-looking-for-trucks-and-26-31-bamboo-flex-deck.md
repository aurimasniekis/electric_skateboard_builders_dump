Hi!

I'm looking to build a very light Mono-Setup. 
Therefore I'm looking for very light trucks and decks.

I've found the **Seismic aeon hollow** wich are **375g** per truck. Are there lighter ones for a reasonable price (without carbon)?

For the deck I'm looking also for a light shortboard around 26-31" also non carbon. It should have the wides wheelbase possible >17" but also a small kick. If it had a little flex to it, that would be a perfect. 

Thanks!

Not sure about flex but Iâ€™ve heard the jet spud 29 is an awesome deck. I also want to try a landyachtz tub boat or dinghy
