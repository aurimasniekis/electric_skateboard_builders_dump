I 3D printed an enclosure for a new build I'm currently working on. This is the first time I'm going to make
a "professional" looking enclosure, and I would like to ask if anyone can help me to understand what should
be the procedure in order to make this enclosure from fiberglass, as I want it to be strong like Schwarzenegger.

It has a bit of curve to if to follow the shape of the deck it's going to sit on. 
My mold should be made from the upper side of the enclosure, reason being is that if it will be made from the inside portion of it, it will not have all the design details. But, if I do it from the outside, I'm not sure how will I be able to give the curve to the mold. Any suggestions? 

(The enclosure is split due to printing size limitation my 3D printer has. I'm going to glue it together).

The way I would do it would be to cut off the flanges and place the enclosure onto the deck. Make sure to cover the deck in something the resin won‚Äôt stick to, then do as you would with the fibreglass and resin. 

Good luck üëç

What I did is apply Vaseline on the mold, apply the fiberglass and the resin, after i cover it with 0.25mm layer of latex and connect the vacuum pump to keep the fiber on place while it dry.

Thanks guys!

@Surfer, your enclosure looks really good! What is the purpose of the latex over the fibergalss?
And can I just apply a standard Vaseline on the mold in order to peel it from the fiberglass?

What did  you use so the resin does not stick on the bag?

You can use regular packaging tape, resin wont stick to it

Yes regular Vaseline is what I used, the latex and the vacuumis to keep the fiberglass in the shape you want after you put the fiberglass you have to wait until it dry

I don't have a vacuum pump and latex. I do, however, have a vacuum bag and Kirby vacuum. 
Do you think it will be good enough for the average DIYer?

I was able to desgin a mold to my enclosure. I'll might go with this route instead and 3D print it.

Carnauba wax is what I have seen others use to stop resin from sticking to mold.

Mould release wax is the ideal thing to use. I use meguiars wax. It‚Äôs an industry standard. 
Be careful with some tapes such as parcel tape it may crinkle and ruin your finish.

Try to avoid 90 degree angles/ corners, it will be pain to get out nice product from your mold. Try to make every sharp corner roundish. 

Yes, you can use ghetto vacuuming. All you need vacuum bag for clothes and vacuum cleaner.  

Also I found that even without vacuum you can make nice enclosure. I made mine mud guards without vacuum at all, and those bastards have a bit complex shape to just not to use vacuum. But I was using very thin fiberglass cloth in multiple layers. Thin Twill cloth is very forgiving for making parts with more complex shapes. Only thing it will take more time, because of multiple layering. 

Don't get me wrong, vacuum is great, it makes all tight in place and presses out not needed resin, makes stuff lighter and stronger.

Here's how look mine mud guards made without vacuum, mold also made without vacuum.

I posted them because I tought that is a good price for fiber glass and carbon fiber. I thought a way to do a carbon fiber enclosure would be start with fiber glass 4-5 layers and then 3 layers of carbon fiber for the final look. Could you post a Matt fiber glass to have an idea what to buy. Thx

I also made a 3d printed model and then layed out the inner side with plastic wrap, then glasfiber and resin, plastic wrap again. And finally i pressed everything in shape with stuffing all full with wet flower soil. Guess wet sand works better but i wasn't brave enough to steel some from the kids play ground at the neighborhood. 
But even if you do it from the outside simply get a lot of sand and press it in shape.
Downside is that you have to sand it afterwards to get a good surface but that's easy to do under the sink with water. This way you don't have all the particles in the air.
Thats a real getto style but easy to do for everybody who doesn't have a vacuum pump at home (what's the reason to have one at hand :wink: ).

I 3D printed a mould like this. Will glue the parts and then do like you suggested vacuum it. Is there anything but packing tape that is usable on the plastic bag to make it release the epoxy? I don‚Äôt have latex bags..

This is the one I use. I use polyester resin based moulds so there may be some difference with epoxy resins.

I make the positive external shape of the enclosure. (plug)
Then if it is for a specific board I fit it to the board then polish it up many times with the mould release wax.
Then I can lay up the mould with gel and fibreglass. (like moulding a boat) After this has cured I remove the plug and there is the mould. Then it can be waxed ups and you can start making enclosures.

What I did is applying a release product and then applied the fiberglass cloths. I made sure each layer is
pressed down as much as I could. I then removed the 3D printed enclosure and was really surprised on how 
well it turned out "out of the box". I then had to do many corrections, like filling some holes with polyester resin
and adding more layers of fiberglass. Oh, and I had to do **a lot** of sanding. That's pretty much it.

Thank for the explanation. So after you finished and let it cured, you fix the imperfection with new layer of resin and fiberglass. Correct? What did you use for sanding (grit)? Wet sanding? Thx a lot
```

---
## \#38 Posted by: Tomer Posted at: 2018-05-13T07:44:14.354Z Reads: 100

```
Yes, correct. 
For the sanding I used 120-150 grit to remove any bumps, then 220 grit to make it smooth before painting.
Final step is 2,000 grit (wet sanding) to make it feel like butter.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-time-fiberglass-enclosure-advices-needed/54662/20?u=rey8801

Maybe a 3rd option would be cut a straight piece from the front edge and make it again that part. Would it be better? Thx guys
