All stuff is ordered and lots of it arrived meanwhile, been pushing the board around for the last two weeks already and I’m loving it.

Did spend last Sunday building the enclosure, it might be a bit more heavy than the ABS or carbon fiber ones but I kinda like the style (might be, that I was a bit frustrated that all the shipping takes so long and needed something to do).
 
Next big action is going to be the battery pack and from there we just keep going with the flow I guess. 

Anyway, I think that’s it for the moment, don’t like to bother you with too much blabla.  I’ll try to keep posting more pictures. 

Feel free to comment, ask questions and/or throw in your creative ideas.
 
Happy building!

Awesome build @shred! Thanks for sharing, looking forward to see the final version. Maybe I am blind but I couldn't find what controller you were going to use? Where did you get your Li-Ion pack or did you build it yourself?

VESC comes from esk8.de. 

Going to build the battery pack myself. I have most of the parts here already just some little bits an pieces missing and then I need to find some time to actually solder it all together. Will keep you guys posted ;)

Update: been getting into soldering the battery packs, bit of a struggle, even though I have a 100W solder iron. To solder two welding rods at the same time is still quite a challenge. Don't ask why this crazy guy is trying to solder two 2x2mm copper welding rods all over the place. As far as I know 2x2 = 4mm/2 which is ok for about 40A, since the battery pack is supposed to be able to deliver 60A continuous I thought I'll add two, even though I know that I'll never actually have 60A continuous anyway. The nickel strips I have, look and feel like a joke though, especially compared to these welding rods. 

Besides I kinda shorted some cells, just for a split second while not taking care, they didn't get warm or anything so they might most likely be ok, still ordered some more cells which I am waiting on now. Tempted to use them still though (getting sick of waiting for parts) ;)

Update: drive train and most other parts meanwhile arrived, looking nice I think :) even though the esk8.de motor mount is quite thick, hope that works out well with the 15mm motor pulley since the motor shaft is a bit short now (around 5mm short)

Where did you get your copper rods from? How much did they cost? 

I have been trying to find some but i cant find much. I have used nickel in the past but i want to beef it up a bit.

Update: kind of finished the battery pack, BMS is still missing and it's all not wired yet. It's a bit scary to work with all these electronics in a aluminium box, but I think I found some ways to isolate everything well enough, lets keep fingers crossed I don't get any (more) shorts, more pictures soon.

First test runs are done, looking mainly good so far. Even though I had to fix the motor mount from esk8.de today, I pulled the insert out so had to glue (loctite 648) it back in today, lets keep fingers crossed that this holds up now.

Will keep you guys updated, need to develop some trust now I guess. Like, easily you get to 25km/h and there would be still lots of throttle to pull, but I really should take it slow to see how everything holds up......

Besides, might need to look into breaking again, it doesn't really sound nice when I pull the breaks too hard.

I had the exact same problem. Going to send it back as their new variants will have tapped holes in the aluminium.

Do the bolts stay on with you? Even with 243 loctite they shake loose on me.

I glued the insert today with loctite 648 (been in contact with Attila), going to give it a try tomorrow and will let you know how it goes. Not so sure with the bolts, they did hold up a 6k test run on rough surface but felt loose as I took the mount off. 

Hope it holds up, would be bit of a pain otherwise, I just finished the build and would love to ride a bit ;) Thanks for letting me know that you send yours back and that there is a improved version available.

Yeah regluing them seems to solve the problemfor some. But keeping the bolts tight is indeed a problem. If you felt that they were a bit loose when dissassembling the mount, then you might have the same problem. Next try i throwing in some 648 on the bolts themselves :p

The idea with the inserts was to make them stronger and replaceable if the threads break. Unfortunately those two different metal types makes glueing a real challenge and our objectives weren't met.

We changed the design now (using even M5 screws) and offer everybody a replacement on warranty.

Yep, I was initially glad when I saw the inserts (a nice attention to detail), because stripping a thread on the new versions is indeed costly. But sadly they don't hold up as well. I've contacted David and they immediately said that I can replace mine for the newer version. Absolutely great customer service, they respond really quickly and are very nice guys :D.

Yes, definitely. :slight_smile: 

We have pressed those threads into the aluminium, so they should be stronger than a normal cut thread. There are limits of course to take care of, every thread can be destroyed. :wink:

yep, I like the idea with the inserts too! If the thread is just cut right into the aluminium you will need to take quite some care as well. 
 
I really hope everything holds up now, I as well kinda like the idea with the 648 for the bolts, not sure if it is a good idea though, is it? @3sly you did give it a try already?

No I haven't, the insert itself came loose again on me. If it completely comes out I could glue it more easily though, but I'm not gonna risk it breaking again when I have to dissasemble anythin, so I'm also gonna send it in for a replacement. It's already being taken care of as well :D

Get a gear puller (something like this: http://www.amazon.com/Lisle-41670-Jaw-Gear-Puller/dp/B004BL86WS)

Every car supplies shop should have them for 10-20 bucks.

they are worth it, you will need them often....

Then apply a little bit of heat and much mechanical force and it will just pop off.

that sucks man! You got the pulley as well from esk8.de? On their web page they say you have to glue the pulley, to remove it, you have to use heat. They don't say much more, maybe @elkick can help? Got a pulley from ebay with grub screws (see the link in my first post here). 
 
I pulled out the insert again on the first test ride, it looked good in the beginning but didn't hold up. I might not have cleaned it well enough I think (some fat left maybe) which might be the reason why it didn't hold up, but anyway, I did send the mount back on Friday. Hope to get the new one soon. As well have an enertion motor mount coming in :) 

Hope you get it sorted out man!

For the stubborn motor pulley, with the drive wheel, belt and motor assembled, and of course the motor grub screws completely loose, try grabbing the drive wheel and motor and work them back and forth using the belt to torque on the pulley. That's the only way I've been able get some off these pulleys of without destroying them. I guess as a last resort, you could loosen or  remove the pulley grub screws and ride it until the pulley comes loose. Be careful though!

thanks man! :) yes, I for sure saw your builds, awesome stuff you do! I really liked the idea of a hanging / floating enclosure and it seemed the most practical thing for me to do as well.  

I've been looking for some rubber spacer but didn't find them in the local warehouse, where did you get them? Since my box has a bottom and a top it seems to be quite sturdy. There are four screws where the whole box is hanging on and there is 6 more screws holding the box together. I might try to get rid of a few of them in the future. 

I'm also thinking about sinking the box into the board a bit, not sure about it yet, but the board is 1,6 cm thick (9layers). So I guess it wont hurt to take off a bit to at least get rid of a bit of concave. Still planning to keep it shiny, really like the reflections of the board color in the enclosure.  

Well, for now I'm actually looking forward to ride it a bit ;) still waiting on the motor mount :unamused:

OK, got the new esk8.de motor mount, looking ok.

Did put all my stuff together, reconfigured/checked all the VESC settings and attached my new mini remote. (maybe too many changes at once)

Been bench testing now and have the following problem: When I pull the trigger / accelerate harsh, like fast to full throttle there is 60% chance that it just accelerates as it should, in the other 40% I get a rattling noise and the motor actually spins backwards with harsh vibrations. 

Not sure what this is about, VESC settings look ok to me. I as well checked motor connectors + motor wires and VESC motor wire connections. It as well seems that this only happens when I try to accelerate quickly. 

Here is the real time data, look at the three spikes on the right, the most right spike is the one where the motor actually stutters / rattles and spins backwards (as well as the third spike from the left).

Not sure what this is about, but I don't like it. Thought about the belt tension, but it actually also happens without a belt, motor spinning freely. 

Some of you guys can help me out?

If you push and pull the motor wires are they firm? Does the motor look good when looking into it? it  seems like a motor problem or at least on mine it was a motor sensor problem, that made it spin backwards after a  certain point, are you using sensors? if yes try running the motor with  sensorless config. Also you could take a screenshot to the rotor position graph.

It's a sensor less [url=http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/alien-6355-outrunner-brushless-motor-190kv-2200w/]190kv 2200W motor from APS[/url]. I don't see anything under the rotor position graph, do I need to have a motor with sensors to see anything there? The motor looks good, like new, it has been going just approx. 12km so far. 

Another screen shot from the Current/Duty: all is going well when I accelerate slowly, as well then another two times when I hit the trigger hard and then again (last spike to the right) some shit happens.

OK, I'm tempted to just ignore the issue I have on the bench for now. I finally had the time for a real test ride and all is looking good and working well :grinning:

distance: 23km, max speed: 38km/h, battery voltage after the run: 35.2 Volts

Might do some more tests with breaking, it sounds like the belt is skipping when I break hard but I actually think it's coming from the motor, not so sure.   

As well need to find some more nice routes around here, the road conditions here are just horrible in parts. 

I as well need to read up on bushings, the red cali standard bushings are 89A blood orange if I got that right, they seem a bit soft though.

Pitstop: Meanwhile more than a 100k's done :D siiiiiick f*ckn sh**t - having fun!! 

- electronics still sitting nice and snug 
- esk8.de motor mount holds perfect and is rock solid
- vesc settings are working great
- no heat problems 
- tightened up the cali standard bushings and I actually quite like them so far 
- top speed (flat) 38kph with a full charge, at around 50% charge more like 35kph
- brings my setup to something like 80% to 85% efficiency
- range is around 27km  

Overall quite happy with the build, still having stuff to play with:

- motor pulley comes loose from time to time 
- @whitepony indeed the enclosure is rattling a bit in times (not one of the top priorities for now though) 
- still playing with the tightness of the belt, seems to be ok now, have tooth skipping only while breaking really hard, tend to call it ABS 

Like to get a few more kph's out of it, was thinking about a higher KV motor, other wheel pulley (33 tooth, 15mm), other motor pulley (10mm bore, 15mm, 16 tooth) or just bigger wheels. 

Not so sure yet, wondering about efficiency.... - anyway keep on rolling!

I changed my VESC setting "Motor Max" from 60A to 80A and that seems to bring a bit more speed, better acceleration and better hill climbing. I get to 40kph with a full charge now but then fall back to 37kph when charge is around or below 50%. I didn't bother setting it to these 80A, which my Motor is supposed to be able to handle because I though my battery can only output 60A anyway. As I understand it now the VESC is somehow transforming higher voltage to higher amps, even though I don't understand it fully. 

I feel this is already quite a improvement, but still would rate efficiency "only" with 80% to 85%. I think it's likely a lot of factors which affect efficiency:

- bigger wheels tend to keep speed better than smaller ones
- smaller belt (9mm or even 12mm) might have less friction (especially while already up to speed)
- smooth asphalt (which I don't have much around)
- better wheel bearings (might try my swiss super 6 at some point) 
- softness of the wheels

Any ideas what else would impact efficiency guys? How would the motor itself have a impact here?

I as well think it is quite a subjective value. When I leave the house here I have around 5k's where I cannot pull the throttle too hard, so when I get to the areas where I can speed with smooth asphalt (after around 9k's) my battery voltage is already down a bit, having more mAh would help me there. 

Going to measure my speeds with my phone on the next runs to see if there is a remarkable difference to my Garmin Dakota 20. 

I was trying to think of a easy test case we could all use to measure efficiency, but the more I think about it, the more I think it will always be just a subjective value anyway.

one more thing is the tightness of the belt! if its fairly loose, it runs a lot easier compared to a really tight belt.

Im also running super swiss 6 btw, love these bearings - they are absolutely silent and run sooo well, best bearings I ever had!! :heart_eyes:

range of 27km is quite spot on with what I found for me -> your battery has 270Wh and when I take things easy, I need 10Wh/km with my single 6374 setup.

my record has been 9Wh/km with 23kph average on FOC, but when I ride normal (30kph+, hard carving), I need more like 13Wh/km. :slight_smile:

about this: the phase currents can be much higher than the battery currents, so its very possible to have 60A battery current @ 80A motor current. I limited my vesc to 70A motor, 50A battery because I lost a few vescs now to various reasons I guess. waiting for the new version for higher currents!

Thanks man, really appreciate your feedback, very helpful information, exactly what I've been looking for! 

Love the super swiss 6 as well, they are truly amazing! Which is the reason why I don't really like to take them out of my daily city cruiser (this one I push). Together with soft bones bushings it's much fun to surf through all those city people :grinning: 

Carving hard!! That might be the reason why I get less and less km out of a charge. As well going full throttle most of the time, at least where road conditions, pedestrians and cyclists permit. 

Found some sandy patch on the way yesterday sliding with all four wheels sideways, found some wet spot with some leaves where I had the back wheels breaking out badly and today while watching a cyclist coming my way I missed to see a big fault in the way and almost got stuck in wobbles. Luckily was able to keep control. Happy that I went with a rough griptape (Jessup coarse) though. 

I've been playing with the tightness of the belt the last two days, best results especially in regards to speed I get when I still have tooth skipping while breaking hard, indeed. Looks like I found something in between for now, it's not too tight but not too loose (still got a decent break), will keep it like that for now, kind of like the break ;) 

Run today was 23km, Voltage after the run 31,6 Volts which I would basically rate as empty. Lots of people today though so had lots of slowdowns on the way. 

Getting the feeling that this esk8buildery is going to be a never ending story :)

Wen't for a morning spin last Sunday, took the board out Sunday afternoon again. Half way into my usual run, suddenly everything dropped out on me, realized early enough that I don't have breaks anymore, foot braked and came to a stand shortly before a tight 90 degrees turn. Everything seemed to work fine at the first inspection, just as soon as I stepped on the board it didn't go anymore or only in short bursts. Wondering what happened but couldn't really figure it out. Took the Tramway home and ordered a new Motor (APS 6355 HEV 190kv) in the evening, which arrived last Friday. Put the motor in just to figure out that the problem is still there. VESC didn't seem to have a problem either, motor detection still worked and I never saw a error in the terminal. After a while of fiddling around, actually figured the receiver had a problem. Looks like the antenna broke or something, so as soon as the controller is further away than a meter, I have no connection or it is not reliable. Luckily I had another controller & receiver floating around, so still could take the new motor for a spin this weekend :) 

Besides, it was all a good reason to look at some parts a bit more closely again and do some cleaning / service work.

Nothing to complain about it, quite like em, performs well, sounds good and is not getting too hot (always able to keep my hand on the motor when I touch it, it gets quite warm but not like something I would burn myself on). I don't have many hills here though. I definitely get less debris into the "closed" version of the motor. Running 10S, so would be cool to have it in 200Kv though. Meanwhile did more than 1000k's on it without issues. 

Some other remarks:
- changed my gearing to 16:36 to get a bit more speed
- the new gearing gives me a km or two less range, more like 22km instead of 24km and a bit less torque 
- but getting up to 40 km/h now, still feel it could be more, tempted to get bigger wheels
- love the new venom bushings, the standard bushings are rubbish indeed (riding 90A with a cup washer board side and 87A with a flat washer street side, also got some Riot pivot cups in 95A, I weight around 65kg)
- still would rate overall efficiency with around 80% 
- would think about a 4P battery next time for extended range
- also about 12S or higher KV motor, just because of speed :)
- 10S system I have is super reliable though

Just as a comparison of the KV's i have a 6364 245kv, Kegal 80mm, 10S4P .....on 15T,36T i was able to get 50km/h speed ...now on 14T,36T i'm at 45km/h ...range about 40km.


I have a spare SK3 6374 192KV motor, i would probably try 16T.36T with this motor

Thanks man, you are right, I should maybe just get a highter KV motor. 
Did you every fry a vesc with this setup? Just wondering since ERPM will be quite high with a 245kv on 10S.

I just dont go full throttle with full 42V battery (does'nt stay at 42V long anyhow ), ...once at around 40V and below i'm fine,.. never had a problem.

You can allways go with a 17T motor gear if you want more speed?
