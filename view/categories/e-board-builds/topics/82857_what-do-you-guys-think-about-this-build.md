Start with the enclosure and battery, and work backwards from there.  Buy the other pieces to fit that, instead of the other way around.

I normally start with Deck and general purpose for the build, then move to battery,enclosure, and drive train.

I then spend months dwelling over minor details...

I then change my mind about a major aspect of the plan...

I then change it back...


Eventually something gets built.

Actually was waiting on those very motor mounts from TB.
Got tired of waiting, and asked them if they were ever going to be back in stock, I was told no. :roll_eyes:

I am now getting some from @Idea. :ok_hand:t4:

Edit: Trampa has a few different truck designs. Make sure you know which one you want/are getting, that way Idea can tell you which motor mounts he has available for you and your trucks!
