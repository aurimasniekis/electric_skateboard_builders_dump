Hi all,

So i have built a 12S DIY using the Lacroix deck. However i saw a picture of a Lacroix using street wheels.

So, i am wondering what parts (trucks, bearings, mounts etc), are needed for me to achieve this?

I have contacted the builder who posted this, but they have not answered back.

Thanks !
