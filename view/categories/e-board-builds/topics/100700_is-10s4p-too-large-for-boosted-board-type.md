Has only build a DIY board similar to Boosted board with a flexy deck using a 10s4p stacked battery?  Is that too big and are we limited to 10s3p?

If it is possible, where would I get the enclosure and battery?

Eboosted sells beautiful fibreglass enclosures for 10s4p and 12s4p configs on the vanguard. Battery youâ€™d have to get a staggered pack to fit in.

No offence, but please do not quote my prices if they are not correct.


A 10s4p is typically $350 free shipping.
