I've just finished up my first build, so here it is: The T1

**Parts:**
Gravity Twin Kick Gotham 38" Deck
Original Caliber Trucks 
Dual 6355s from Torqueboards 
Torqueboards Reverse Motor Mounts and 15mm Pulleys
Torqueboards Nano Remote
Dual Focbox
Pitbull Electric Skateboard 10s5p battery
97mm 78A wheels from Build Kit Boards w/ Bronson Speed Co. Bearings
Bluetooth Module from Build Kit Boards
DIY Sheet Aluminum Enclosure

**Setup:**
Motors running at +70/-60 each 
Battery running at +40/-10 total
Running in CANbus
DIY top-mount loop key

**Performance:**
30mph top speed [48.3 kph]
Estimated 20-mile range
Loads of torque
Blows past a boosted mini on a hill

**Price:**
I was lucky on timing so I got a bunch of things when they were on sale. The total came out to a little under a grand (excluding shipping).

**Summary:**
It has been super fun building this thing and riding it. I have already rolled past 50 miles and haven't busted, yet. Nothing has failed yet, but we'll see about that by the 100-mile mark.

Very cool loop key

I'll be honest, It took a little while (3 months-ish) but I haven't had any issues with it. Chris was very helpful with everything I asked him about during the planning phase. I still haven't drained it all the way to get the true range, but 20 miles is a pretty good estimate. The loopkey came from the clean look I *was* going for and I didn't want to put it on the side or back. 
Thanks though!
