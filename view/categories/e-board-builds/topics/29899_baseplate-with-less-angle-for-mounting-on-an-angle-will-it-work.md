I am running TB 218mm caliber clones and want to mount them on an angle to provide more turning clearance for pneumatic wheels. My current base plates are 50 degrees. If I could swap them with a 30-degree baseplate and then mount them on a 20-degree angle, would they still function correctly?

Mounting this way would simply change your kingpin angle to a less angle correct? I am hoping to decrease my kingpin angle and then make up the difference with an angled mount.

I want that board every time i see a pic, those big wheels shoe horned in to the deck, looks fast up front and stable out back makes me want to get wedged in the pockets and see how fast she can go...

Yeah, changed the front truck to 47° and the back to 45°. It still carves really well, the biggest difference it made was in the stability.  You can do the same thing if you are going to top mount. You'd just use different wedges. Look on socalskateshop.com

I can't tell if your deck is going have a kick-nose and/or kick-tail of 20° and then you just want to run a 30° baseplate or if your deck is flat and you plan on using a 20° wedge riser. Either way you'd have a 50° steering angle. A 20° wedge riser is an insane angle so I have to assume that your deck is bending 20°, yes? 

Above is a 50° baseplate mounted on a flat section of the deck, and a 30° baseplate mounted on a section of the deck that is angled 20°. Notice that the kingpins, bushings, and pivot cups are identically positioned in space and that the hangers "don't care" about the baseplates themselves.

If you hide the plate portion of the baseplates themselves, it's easier to see that functionally they are equivalent.

Holy explanation! My deck is flat but I was planning on making an aluminum mount that would flush mount in the top of the deck and extend past the deck but up at a 20 degree angle. When mounting back the 30 degree baseplates I would get a bit more wheelbase along with a slightly lower CG. This is by all intents and purposes a light weight (durability) MTB for only street use that I want to run 8" pneumatics and Trampa hubs (already have an axle difference solution) on a practically standard longboard.

The problem I see is that 20° produces a big/tall wedge and you may run into some clearance issues with the truck's hanger interfering with the deck around the drop-through slot ...

Here's a 20° mounting flange and a 30° baseplate with a 218mm Hanger. It can yield the 50° steering angle and clearance that you want.

The bigger challenge that you're going to face is making the mounting flange rigid enough so that it doesn't torsionally twist. If you bent some 1/4" thick aluminum plate it would flex and twist way too much for my liking. Torsional twisting is the devil. Many/most skaters have no idea how horrible it is. Some will even tell you that "slop is your friend". It is not. You would be much better served by casting or machining a mounting flange that has little to no flexing or twisting. It's usually easier to reinforce an angled wood deck feature with diagonal crossing carbon fiber strips. We make double-kick decks that are 36" to 42.5" in length.

This is exactly what I was hoping to accomplish! Do you think 1/4" steel flat stock would be suitable to avoid torsional twist?

one of my favorite esk8 decks was a 40" bustin YOFACE double kick, and my favorite pusher is a 40" brad edwards gravity double kick.

You'd have to try it and see. It's difficult to take something thin and flat and prevent it from twisting.

[quote="MoeStooge, post:17, topic:29899, full:true"]
Find someone who can weld in some gussets on the top side and your torsional twist problems are solved. I would use t-6 aluminum 1/4 or 3/16 plate
[/quote]

I think this is a good approach. 

Years ago I was running parking garages with some friends and we had two boards that had the same axle-to-axle wheelbase, same trucks, and same wheels (Lime BigZigs). One deck was relatively rigid, and the other was a G-Bomb that had a stiff wooden middle standing platform, and two aluminum mounting flanges. We were switching boards and whenever anyone was on the G-Bomb they couldn't negotiate the corners and keep up with the pack. The lack of control was noticeable to all of us. You'd just slide out. If we hadn't been switching boards and/or using identical setups we probably would have just thought it was "pilot error". But the torsional twisting of that deck made it impossible for whomever was on it to hang with.

I have back burners the angled mount idea for now and will simply bebusing a piece of flat bar as an extension. I do plan to design a fully enclosed mount with mounting studs to accomplish mounting Trampa/MBS trucks on longboard decks. Just need the design time and a willing machine shop to make a prototype.

I can't honestly say that I could offer good advice to the "dirt oval" community or any vehicle where full suspension and a steering wheel is involved. But what I do know is that virtually every vehicle with 3 or more wheels is going to experience forces on the frame/chassis/deck and that torsional twisting will be an issue. Bikes and inline skates carry mostly radial loads, and their frames are designed accordingly.

Because skateboards and street luges are lean-steer and because the deck is the lever that we use to apply all of the forces to our steering system, it is more important than ever that we have a GOOD lever. Noodles do not make good levers. Noodles make fun diving boards and spring boards, but I LOATHE noodle boards. A little flex is okay, but typically whenever a board can flex, it can also twist. I've been using "Carbon-X" construction in our maple/poplar/carbon/fiberglass decks and it designed to allow a small amount of flex while eliminating as much twisting as possible. Here are a few images and a video showing the difference in the direction of fibers and how it relates to flex vs twisting. When the fibers run tip-to-tail (0°) it resists longitudinal flexing but twists like a noodle. When the fibers run diagonally (45°) it flexes a lot but resists torsional twisting. You can see how I've used carbon strips in the rendering at the bottom ...

The first piece in the video is the 0° and it twists a lot, followed by the 45° piece which is hard to twist

LOVE the GBomb deep drop brackets.  I had my first dual motor setup with these -  (5065 200kv at the time) w/ Paris 195 trucks and ADS v1 motor mounts.

Sweet setup until stolen.  Only pain points were the motor mounts liked to rotate when braking hard (and grind on the ground - no fun).  And i had to grind the front of the paris base at the pivot cup to fit within the curve of the deep drop bracket.  

This was the reason i swapped the new extended 218mm DIYes Caliber clone trucks baseplate to legit Caliber II baseplate - the legit baseplate was a bit smaller and didn't stick out as much.  Since i'm recreating (eventually) my Subsonic / GBomb esk8.  [quote="longhairedboy, post:16, topic:29899, full:true"]

Yeah - that was me.  I didn't adjust mine a ton, but it was really nice to adjust.  The original GBomb brackets were adjustable on the fly w/ a bike wheel clamp (rotate to tighten, lever closed to clamp - but also in the way on one side).  I have the newer DD Brackets and they are set without this clamp - a bit less adjustable on the fly (you can use a skate tool to do it).  But also lightened a lot w/ more material removed at the bottom (they are aluminum - not super heavy, but not light - pretty thick).

way way back in the day...:

(you can see the clamp at the top - tried to move it out of the way as much as possible).  Great setup!  Will make v2 even better!

@longhairedboy

Bustin YoFace!

How was/is yours setup?



I picked up one up the other day on the Craig's, and am really digging it!  Indy 215's and 83mm sector 9 wheels.  Deck is 41 x 10"...

Sadly I've not got a esk8 yet, but thinking about setting it up the YoFace with Nowinds dual gear drive, with trucks mounted on the tails and 8" pneumatics.


I'm sure I'd have to cut the tails down some for wheel clearance, and think I'd need some reinforcement at the ends as well.

The tail angle I haven't measured yet, but I'd have to make custom wedges to get them at the right angle.

that sounds like a fun setup! You wouldn't need much of a wedge to correct it to 35 degrees, but you'd defintiely need one. The tails are pretty angled up already but they aren't quite there. 

I kind of want to take my old YOFACE off the wall and put the 6S back in it.
