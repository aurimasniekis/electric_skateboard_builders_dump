I need to buy motors for my first build...I want beltless it just my idea because i think will be less bulky and minimum maintenance and less expensive..

Mators: 
Option 1: https://www.ebay.com/itm/90mm-Dual-6364-Hub-Motors-Drive-Kit-Parts-For-Electric-Skateboard-Longboard-US/292483851928?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2060353.m2763.l2649

Option 2: https://www.ebay.com/itm/90MM-6364-Dual-Hub-Motor-Drive-Kit-Wheel-Parts-for-Electric-Skateboard-Longboard-/122922179272

Option 3: https://www.ebay.com/itm/90mm-Dual-6364-Hub-Motors-Drive-Kit-Parts-For-Electric-Skateboard-Longboard-US/292483851928?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2055359.m2763.l2649

Are they the same motors? Same Capacity...   (I think they are they just look different) 
I'm leaning more to Option 3 cause is cheaper.. Do i need to have the 5 pin female connector for the hall sensors?

Any Hall sensors information will be useful, IDK what is the function of it. I did google it..but sometimes is better to get info from a forum..For now that's all i have .

One Idea is that I want bigger tires..which i will be using TPU filament to create some aireless tires like the ones michellin made 3d printed...

Any help is appreciated...

I need to build i have over 100 18650 recycle batteries. which are in great condition still from used laptops. I also have a 3d printer and i can do my own case underneath the skateboard. Buying a new one is not my choice. If i build it will be way cheaper..than $399..so far..free batteries..$20 bms $ 50 for esc from ebay with controller..i need motor and board...i want to do a 10s3p @ 2700mah..i think will be great quality..and great experience..and great knowledge...

maybe go 9s6p, But even that would have noticeable voltage sag.
You know when you play with an Rc car and its so fun but near the end 20% battery life It just sucks?
or when your battery is at 35% and you can't go up hills.
Well, that's kinda what u get with cells like that.

You have two options here. 10s10p battery. You will get around 35amps discharge (must remember that discharge is probably burst, not continuous) you will have amazing range which means you will most likely not get the battery down to a point where voltage sag is really bad

The other option is to buy some cheap 2 cell lipos on HobbyKing. You just missed a sale I just got 5x 2s lipos 5000mah for $90 Australian.

So if you use your 18650s to make a 10s10p or similar battery it would give you a max discharge rate of around 52amps (5200mah x the number in parallel). But that is the cells max discharge and it will most likely over heat at that current so let’s say 35amps max that would be about 3.5amps per cell. That is also the amount the esc can handle. 


As for range you would have a 27ah battery, at 10s you would have 36v x 27ah = 972wh. Now that is a theoretical 97km. I would estimate a range of closer to 80-85 just because of voltage sag and that when running at higher amps the cells won’t output a full 2700mah


If you need anything specific just ask
```

## \#22 Posted by: Instinct0224 Posted at: 2018-04-02T22:35:15.850Z Reads: 136

```
this is my understanding..: 18650 let me break it down...
1 cell = 2600mah 3.7v @ best
10 cells series = 2600mah 37v @ best
10 cells parallel = 26000mah = 26 amp hours  @ 37v
36v * 27ah = 972wh @ best..

Honestly 85km is way to long for what i need it..i probably need 40km max...is my other option get motors that have less power? I saw ones for 450watts i was looking @ 550watts but i guess might not be right for the type of batteries that i have..

Draw less current? So the important part here is how much power the motors are drawing? make sure i have enough discharge power. How do you calculate speed?

## \#23 Posted by: pat.speed Posted at: 2018-04-02T22:49:48.640Z Reads: 135

```
You have series and parallel the wrong way around. I think the minimum sized pack you could use would be around 10s6p. That will give 35amps max which is the same as your esc can handle per channel. 

Oh I just realised your going to be using dual motors well I would definitely not go less than about 10s6p at the very least. 


To calculate speed use this calculator

900watts in total..can you help me figure out the discharge..i'm confused there...

I think i got part of it..on that specific motors..the watts are 900 and the battery bank..for 10s10p will be 972? 

I'm confused in the discharge part..i'll stop reading a bit...let it sit in on my brain and come back..i'll try to read some of it..too..

Max. Discharge Current 5200mA

These might work if they are **all the same cell** and you go 6S12P.  *But not any less P than 12*.

Also I would use 4 longboard wheels and not just 2.

```
What I was calculating is not the amperage output but the available amp hours. To work out how many watts it can out put you need to times the max discharge by the amount in parallel and then by the voltage. So 5.2 x 6 x 36 = 1120watts out put power as a 10s6p but that is very close to the maximum of the motors and I’m sure that the battery cannot output that continuously. So let’s say it can only out put 3 amps, 3 x 6 x 36 = 648watts

https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/samsung-26f-5-2a-2600mah-bench-test-results-just-not-worth-it.773291/

So if all your cells are the same this is the data that supports it at 5.2a per cell.  Anything above is not worth it.  

However your dual eBay hub motor picks are rated at 550w each so 1100w Max. 1100w/36=30a 

30a/5a=6p

So 10s6p would be within your battery limit (same batteries) and at your motor limit as well.   

If you went with any less parallel battery groups your maximum output in amps will be less as well as range.  

It's obvious these are not the cells typically used for eskate. However if you have them available and are willing to set limits to prevent ruining the batteries you could use them considering the fact they are free, not much of a loss.

[/quote]

I disagree.  These are used cells -- and it's never ever a good idea to run things at 100% capacity unless you want it to last a very short time.  So both of those combined is worse than either one alone.

12P minimum with these cells is my recommendation which means 6S12P

Every 18650 is different have a look at the discharge current of most battery builds, each cell is around 20 amps continuous that’s why they use 18650 cells

I’m guessing that’s a 30q or hb2 cell? And yes that will work because it will give you a max theoretical discharge of 40amps which will be good for your setup. When ordering I suggest to order from Nkon, as they have legit cells that are at a good price

I have built battery packs from used laptop cells. I built 10S5P for my electric bicycle. It was decent performance but they drained very fast, but 10S10P was great. 10S5P(5Ah) got me about 15km, and 10S10P(7,7Ah) got like 25km. (assisted pedaling)
I only have like 500 cells, so i didn't get good balance between the "good" cells. (Only about 5% of 500 were worthy).
I considered those cells for my e-skate, but that option would have been very bulky and heavy, and i calculated that decent performance pack would be like 10S15P :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

In my experience, commuting on flat terrain at 25km/h with small hills has been peaking to 10-35A(looking at my battery usage graphs) while i had lipo-batteries.
So either of those are good. I would go with the cheaper one. 2,6A and 3A are not that much difference afterall.
