Wow, that is a lot of grunt there for a 29" board.  My sons 10s 30" is bad enough.  Scares the sh*t  out of me.  Good luck and cool build!

Im also building a short board with almost identical parts.
6374 190kv from diy...
vesc from diy...
12s1p

How did yours turn out?

Top speed, range, stability, any other observations
Also, it would be helpful if I could see your settings for the vesc.

Thanks in advance, @SyrusB

 Looks great! Making a small cruiser board. Curious about the functionality of the kicktail with the motor back there. Are you still able to use it?

Cool little build. 
Im doing a dual 6355 on a 30inch deck with 12s2p currently.  Finding enclosures sucks for short decks lol.

Heck yes, 10mos later! That's dedication, lol
How does it ride? The shortboard-with-kicktail format is awesome, I love mine for that "last mile" portabilityüëç

Ik how you feel, I ended up making a custom enclosure, and it did not turn out pristine but it does the job and dosent look to bad.

I'm going to try cutting a psychotiller enclosure in half and try patching it back together with abs cement and spare kydex

Did you ever figure out your vesc settings? Looks like that battery might be good for 30 amps or so... what did the motor detect decide what amperage to draw?

Honestly I'm not sure i just ended up copying the settings from my other board because it uses the same battery, and a similar motor
