Hey community,

My name is Ryan and I am a first time builder of an E Board. I am open to any suggestions or help and have a tough skin so feel free to be critical. The reason for the title of the build is that the first creation will be for my wife ( who is a dancer so at some point there will be a ballerina motif on the deck, helps to get the ok to fund projects.. lol) I'll use this board to learn the arts of the assembly and hopefully then move onto a second build for my own board.

So the setup so far is thus:

* Deck is a BSA Blank Lunar Top mount ( 9" x 36") natural wood - But I will cover the top with Black grip tape.
* motor is a 6355 Rspec Enertion 190Kv Motor
* Running gear from Enertion - although Im still waiting on a motor pulley and a rear truck as the order was sent as a partial shipment, with little to no support from the team at Enertion after a week of chasing... I'm sure they're just getting slammed and I'll hear something soon.
* VESC from Enertion
* Battery is a 10S3P enclosed in the Enertion space cell ABS hard case.

Still deciding on one of two remotes, I have a nano remote from DIY electric skateboards, and a GT2B from hobby king, any advice on these would be appreciated.

I'll post the photos below.

How is that deck? I wanted one of their blank decks but the shape I wanted wasn't stiff enough, does that bend a lot when you stand and bounce a little?

Carbon fibre on the bottom. No reason to put on top, wont help with structure.

EDIT: Just grab some carbon fibre cloth, epoxy resin, hardener, and a brush and your set.

@whitepony does it with a vacuum bag. It takes longer but is better. Vacuum bag kits cost about $600 AUD so very expensive. Just get a brush, mix the hardener and resin and brush over.

First - congrats on having a cool wife who's willing to esk8 and let you get started w/ her own board!  So much easier that way.  I did the opposite, and built mine first, then one for her.  

Flex - i'd look at another deck, or a different battery setup - that would suck to waste the SPACE cell.  Or use it on your next build (your pin tail might not work well shape wise w/ SPACE cell though...).

If you want to keep flex - you need to separate your batteries and ESC front and back w/ center clear to flex.  Look at OKP and whitepony's Vanguard builds for ideas.  Not simple and probably a tough project to learn on.

To stiffen a board is relatively easy (even i can do it...).  Like @lox897 said - Epoxy and CF or GF.  Realize that CF is conductive so you want to be careful (it also block RF so can affect Tx/Rx range or issues).  The sanding dust can short stuff - so sand someplace w/ good ventilation and clean up regularly (wear a mask etc.).

I'm a big guy, and i've used CF a few times now to help reinforce a board (or to make it look nicer).  This is all for me to learn how to do it better - so nothing is super polished but definitely functional.  I have an "ultimate" build in mind and i'm not willing to mess it up - so these are literally my practice runs!

First i did a simple top cover of an Omen Sugar (flat wires under GF like boosted) - not because of flex, and not because the bottom graphic is so amazing - mainly just to practice and wanted to have a clean middle w/o power wire running Fr -> Bk:
[img]http://goo.gl/SOZ9w2[/img]

I built a board for a buddy:
[img]http://goo.gl/gAWgV9[/img]
[img]http://goo.gl/vNiAQw[/img]
(in process - did top and bottom)

I recommend you cut the excess off (as close as possible to edge) when it gels - depending on your epoxy and temp (how fast it will cure) this can be 5-10min or an hour.  I used slow hardener, so usually about 35-45min:
[img]http://goo.gl/jgq5hp[/img]
[img]http://goo.gl/F717sl[/img]
(sanding is optional - especially w/ power tools be careful - i burned through an edge...)
I added a UV protectant spray paint coat to wet it after sanding and protect UV yellowing.
[img]http://goo.gl/fNPraf[/img]
Bit of Vicious grip on top (last i had in black w/ basic grip in middle)

Most recently i'm working on a hollow bottom setup on an Omen Chief.  A buddy at work had a CNC router and said he could hollow out the bottom for a nice finish, and kinda royally screwed it up.  Burned through a couple spots, so i filled them w/ CF scrap and am CF the top and bottom (it was pretty thin in the middle).  Super strong now and I definitely over-built the top.  12k CF is beefy and especially important to clean the edges while wet/gel vs when hard.  Good scissors when gelled, then dremel the edges as close to flush as possible before finishing with sander.  2 layers on most of the top:
[img]http://goo.gl/ICMHXn[/img]
The garbage bag underneath won't stick to resin so drips are easy to clean up.  A lot of sanding (wear gloves and long sleeves - very itchy!).  You can also use packing tape around the edges to avoid drips on the bottom - less to sand and cleanup later!

Good scissors are helpful.  Another great trick is to use a thin piece of painter's tape and cut down the middle of the tape.  It keeps the edges clean and from unraveling.
[img]http://goo.gl/8jbtHx[/img]

That's probably what i've learned to-date...  It's a lot of fun and really satisfying to see the end result on your board.  It will not turn a super flexy deck into a rock solid plank - but it will help stiffen.  You may still need to re-plan your wife's setup w/ that battery enclosure (no flex).  

Hope this info and pics are helpful - ask if any questions i can help with.

So after being away for a month, all my parts have slowly arrived. Still waiting on a few key things but managed to get my drive train assembled and thanks to @jacobbloy  for awesome tutorial videos ( and kudos for being an awesome dad/partner looking after your young baby while making the video mate) got the VESC configured to pumping some serious juice to the motor. I will govern this down before my first ride. 

I couldn't jump on the board yet as it has way too much flex, so am waiting for some carbon fibre to arrive and will put four layers on each board. Yup am doing two at the same time, but I'll start another build thread for the second board as I'm using @torqueboards motor and drive train on the next one as a comparison. I will say straight off the bat though @onloop the enertion drive train (wheel pulley, motor pulley, motor and motor mount) was super smooth and easy to assemble, given the option the next time around I'd go this again as it was fast and easy to assemble.

Anyway, I need to pop into Bunnings today and grab some more bits and pieces, but everything going well I should have a working board by this time next week. And once my second enertion space cell arrives, my second beast will be alive too!

boards are simple geometries, so you can probably lay them all at once (which is better anyway unless there are a lot of airgaps in between layers during during). did you pick up a vacuum pump by now? :)

why so many layers btw? you really want it superstiff?

Thanks @whitepony I'll lay them all at once. The only reason I'll throw three layers on is that I the amount of fabric I purchased cut up to three layers for each board pretty well. Do you think it's over kill? I've got the space cell and don't want to flex the case...

Oh I I didn't go the vacuum pump, I thought I'd try the cheap way and lay them by hand for now

```
I would recommend trimming the CF once it starts to kick.  It will be MUCH easier to trim now than after it sets.  Then you can further dremel/cut/clean-up the edges before sanding flush.

Make sure you wear a respirator when sanding - this stuff is as bad as itching powder - so cover skin and don't inhale the dust!  Do it outside, or in a well ventilated place - vacuum etc. after.

the dust is also conductive, so it's really important to keep it away from electronics (like motors and ESC's), but most importantly away from your lungs!

GL!

Hey @lox897, I used the west system resin and 246 hardener which is a slow one ( first crack so didn't want to rush it!) the links you initially sent me were really good, so I went with the liquids from Carbonfibre.com.au and the fabric was cheaper from playwithcarbon.com

I forgot to first mention - looks F A N T A S T I C ! ! !  Super smooth handlay and doesn't look sopping wet.

A couple tricks i've just read about for getting rid of bubbles and pinholes - if you decide to do a top/gel coat?  Heat and denatured alcohol mist.  The heat will lower the viscosity and help the bubbles pop.  the denatured alcohol in a mister will break the surface tension to smooth out the surface.  Just read about it today, haven't tried it, but will next one i do.

Well done sir!  Look forward to seeing the finish pics!

Thanks @sl33py again great tips! From what I can see with an untrained eye I'm ok for the bubbles, but I guess time will tell. Will cut the fabric soon as it's starting to stiffen now. Haven't hardened as quickly as I thought, but it is a cool day and I used a slow hardener..

Right on.  Love the west systems epoxy.  I use the 206 hardener, and i think i usually get about an hour (in cool'ish weather) before it starts to gel (when i like to cut - less likely to move, but still pliable to easily cut around contours/corners etc.).

Look forward to seeing these done - great work man!

ok so not going to lie, what started out as my wife's build quickly became mine... but I have been waiting since July to get it all together! Heading out on maiden voyage now, with wife on the push bike üòÇ But as soon as Enertion sends the battery pack I've ordered ( over a month ago) then she'll be up and running too!

OK, so final wrap up for the build/s..

Its been about a week now that I've had my board up and running.
Specs are:

**RGK Build:**
-SurfDart Board from Whatever Skateboards with custom grip tape 9.5" x 44"
-DIY Carbon Fibre base with two layers of 3K Twill 2mm fabric from PlaywithCarbon
-Battery is the Spacecell Pro3 - 10SP from Enertion
-Wheels and trucks from DIY electric skateboards 83mm Black wheels and 50 degree V2 trucks
-Pulleys,belt and motor mount from DIY electric skateboards - 16T motor pulley and 36T wheel pulley, 12mm Belt
-VESC - DIY electric skateboards
-Motor from DIY electric skateboards - 6374 230KV 3200W
-Controller is GT2B from a random Ebay store

Review:
I love it. Well, it goes plenty fast enough for me and I've done almost 100kms on it so far. In terms of riding the speed is definitely enough for me, the top speed so far is about 35km/h with plenty more in the throttle, I dont think I would pursue a higher speed then this. Braking feels solid for me ( I weigh 84kgs) and I have been up and down some moderate hills. I have noticed at some higher speeds the motor feels 'surgy' not sure why, weather its a belt or electronic issue - if anyone could shed some light on this I'd really appreciate it. It's not a major as I can feather the controller no dramas. I played around with the truck settings and got it to a point where it felt good at quicker speeds and could navigate corners ok. Things I would change, the deck shape. While I really like the look of the retro dart shape, my back foot doesnt have a solid purchase, it's too narrow, I think in the future I'll strip this down to a cruise long board (just for kicking around) and swap the running gear over to a wider board. Overall really happy with it, I'll do a build review for the original wife's board below this.

OK, so originally this was all about my wife's build, and I'll admit I hijacked the thread as I was waiting on parts, and just wanted to ride!

So I cant remeber what I put above in terms of details but I'll capture it all again here.
Specs are:

**EMEK Build:**
-BSA blank Lunar top mount from Boardshop  9" x 36"
-DIY Carbon Fibre base with two layers of 3K Twill 2mm fabric from PlaywithCarbon
-Battery is the Spacecell Pro3 - 10SP from Enertion
-Wheels and trucks from Enertion 83mm Blue wheels and 50 degree trucks
-Pulleys,belt and motor mount from Enertion - 15T motor pulley and 36T wheel pulley, 12mm Belt
-VESC from Enertion
-Motor from Enertion - 6355 190KV 2400W
-Controller is GT2B from a random Ebay store - But I put it into one of @FLATLINEcustoms Mad Monkey enclosures 

Review:
I really like the board shape and length. This board still goes plenty fast enough for me, but I've not done many kms on it so far. First thoughts are that the braking and torque are way underpowered for a mono drive. It's interesting to note that I bought this as a mono drive kit from Enertion, and now on their website while the mono kit still includes a 55mm motor, when you read under the motors individually it recommends a 72mm for a mono drive kit, and a 55mm for a dual drive setup. I hope in the future they change this mono drive kit, as for the extra dollars I'd definitely get the larger motor In terms of riding safety, if anyone can suggest how I can up the braking power through BLDC without frying anything I'd really appreciate it. Otherwise I think I'll need to get another VESC and motor. Whats also interesting is that the Enertion Vesc seems to take ages to connect to BLDC as opposed to the DIY version. Not a biggie and definitely not an issue just something I have noticed. That being said the Enertion motor mount and wheel pulley are way better then the DIY electric skateboards version in my opinion. The motor mount is far easier to adjust to the angle that you want, and the wheel pulley is super simple to insert as opposed to the bolts and plates version, so much so that I have ordered another wheel pulley from Enertion to replace it in the future. The other awesome thing with this build is the controller. Originally I had purchased a winning remote from DIY electric skateboards, but then after reading all the info through the forum I was definitely nervous. Nonetheless I hooked it up and ran out on the maidan voyage with it and it seemed to work ok, then later when I had hooked it up to BLDC it freaked out and would aclerate and brake at odd times. It may have been a user error, but I had already purchased another GT2B and gotten a Mad Monkey enclosure from @FLATLINEcustoms so decided to go ahead and do the conversion. I am not going to lie, before these projects I had not soldered before, and the enclosure mod did challenge me, but thanks to Joel being a massive help I got it all sorted and am stoked with the reliability and usability of the new remote. If you're thinking about doing this change over - do it..
