Hello There! This will be my first post as I just joined the forum and been researching about e-skateboards for about a month. I have been looking for range mostly, single motor but very powerful and a clean skinny look.

Here is what I am looking for in a build:

Clean, Sleek Design
Good Power
Good Range
Small controller that can fit into any jeans pocket.
Charging port
A way to see how much battery is left on the board

I recently tried my first electric skateboard the Yuneec E-go and had a blast on it my only complain was that the torque/speed was not enough. I liked the design and the controller though.

My budget is 700$ so feel free to help me with this! I am looking to get started Asap.

Thanks a bunch :D

Are you a heavy person?
Do you have lots of hills?
Are you able to DIY a motor mount? 
Single or dual drive?
Do you have a board already?

The new[ ollin motors](http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/om5065-200kv) looks nice, I would try them out if I were building a new board. [Here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/ollinboardco-om5065-200kv-sensored-motor/3409) is the post by chaka.

hey @seanpain4! Thanks for the response. 

I am 175 pounds
mostly flat grounds but there is 1 or 2 hills. 
I am not able to. Which is why i was looking at pre-made ones like the exertion motor mount and such
single(but powerful :D)
I don't have a deck yet. Basically waiting to get opinions of the details I specified to see what will be the best.

Thanks a bunch!

Then I suggest that you build your own deck with the batteries build in between two layers of plywood. These lipo cells looks good, cheap and very thin: http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__18560__Turnigy_5000mAh_1S_20C_Lipoly_Single_Cell_.html

I have not tried out this idea yet but I am going to soon. I will let you know how it goes - please let me know as well if you do it too! :)
