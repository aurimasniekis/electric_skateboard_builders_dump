I got my Carvon EVO 4WD R which I believe is the overall best electric skateboard to date and would like to thank Damon and Jerry for making this happen for me..I've also made a thank you video for both of them..I have a few videos up for now on my YouTube channel but here is my 1st ride and unboxing from a 62 year old still riding longboarder lol..

Beautiful. I expected it to be bulkier at the enclosure.

So it would greatly benefit from a Delta-WYE switch... would it be possible to get one of these trucks with all its phase leads already coming out the motors already?

It would just complicate things, there would be more things to break. Dont think a delta wye switch on esk8 is worth it, considering the main problem is heat.

This would be more of a personal thing... I've been wanting to do it for a while now lol and have a circuit and some relays (2-40A per motor) and its a 12v relay 3PDT relay that will handle the switching

@HI-DEF-DEPOT could you share pictures of the bottom please? Very nice review
But please when riding this beast use full face helmet, gloves and all the knee/elbow pads.
Trust me I have over 1500 km on the carvons and they are as much dangerous as they are amazing. And one beloved member of the community died riding with this 4wd setup. I don't mean to be a dick or anything but the protection you use is not enough.

@HI-DEF-DEPOT please take note of the position of your batt gauge and charge port. I noticed the abrasions on the cover of the enclosure.

Carvon doesn't exist anymore. Jerry failed as a business owner, and managed to con thousands of dollars from people. 

Stay away. Don't even buy a used set as they are quite difficult to repair unless you know exactly what you're doing. 

A new age of direct drive motors has started though, and I should point you towards the @torqueboards DD
