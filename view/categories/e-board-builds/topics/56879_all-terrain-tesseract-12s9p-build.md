Looks cool dude, nothing like riding a proper sorted DH deck. The only think I can think of that would be better would be a 45/25 degree split on the risers :dark_sunglasses:

It would be nice. But in order to us the trucks I am using it can only be possible to make this build with @okp  custom riser which are nearly impossible to get your hands on right now snice a only made a few of them.

It will definitely have nice look and higher than what it is now but it will be to unstable at anything over 20mph. With the trucks  being innovative it gives it optimal performance at higher speed I was able to push up to 30mph and it was really stable üëåüèº

Ok ! :)

I once tried one of the Okp's build which almost same as yours and it had hooks in regular position and I'm goofy so I couldn't go as fast as I wanted but it was powerful for sure ! And yours seem too.

The guy now owning the board went to 52Km/h on it (using stock VESC 4.12, not Focbox). I also know that later he tried some [roadies tires](https://mbseurope.com/product/mbs-roadie-tyre/) and gained some vmax and coasting abilities (or just "coast", don't know how to use this word). Here is a picture of the look it gave :

Nice board, do you ride on dirt? I want to try a large build like this one day to go on some packed roads arround my city and keep riding all day long, but I don‚Äôt know how much more energy this will need compared to city riding

And any internal shots? The battery is triple stacked?

Yea man I love that board I want to build one the moment I saw @okp board. I am also using dual ollin VESC 4.12 he is going just as fast as me but the top speed on my board is 69km but to scarred to push it that much as I am still recovering from a shoulder injury. I will definitely get some of those roadies tires

It‚Äôs a powerful board with crazy range and it handles every well on dirt road. I did a lil of roading yesterday to test it out and it was great. Sorry I forgot to take pick of the internal part but I will next time I open it back up.. and the battery is Double stack have enough space in the Enclosure to do it.

It‚Äôs a sweet ride, very stable High speed and smooth due to the width of the deck itself. That LaCriox happen to be build 10s5p with 20700 cell we did a 24 mile ride that day with out charging and would have still been good for another 10mile

What can in be decky?
1. spur
2. helical
3. herringbone...

No point in it being bevel with the motor orientated the was it is, can you think of anything else?
The box looks the shape of Jenso's box right down to how he does his bulge for the screws, just looks red.
```

## \#35 Posted by: Deckoz Posted at: 2018-05-30T02:17:13.830Z Reads: 269

I'm guessing herringbone. But no one shows no pictures

He said it's not helical. But didn't give other details or picture. 

And yea it looks like Jenso drives. He added quick change apparently too.. so instead of bolting the wheels to adapter the screws and nuts insert into a recession...

Would you like this more than the Spud? longer wheelbase means more stability of course

How is the turning ratio?

Crazy build, I'm thinking of something like this, the Pho3nix is too big sometimes.

Man I love the spud it‚Äôs a sun ride and looks crazy amazing. Going to build another just working on getting another set of the 35¬∞ riser from a friend here in New York.


with the Tesseract deck man it‚Äôs so much fun to ride great  stability at High speed so far I have pushed up to 35mph the spud anthing over 25 feel like you are going to die lol. And the turning amazing keep in mind though that I have yellow dampeners in the back in the front. If you don‚Äôt use them this thing  turns on a dime.

How stable is the Lacroix at higher speeds compared to you tesseract? I understand that longer decks are better for stability at higher speeds? Though I have read guides saying that 80% of focus should be on the deck width so I‚Äôm not sure how the Lacroix fares when going at those speeds as it‚Äôs 4‚Äù shorter but just as wide nearing 10‚Äù. Stability is a concern for me so I‚Äôm on the fence on building one around a downhill deck like the Tesseract or maybe a Landyachtz Evo or go with the Lacroix.

Planning a tesseract build as well! how wide do the trucks have to be to get adequate clearance to avoid wheel bite? I am planning to use Carvon V4 Torque drives so I dont know how much clearance from the deck the rear wheels have if I want to run 107mm ABECs or pneumatics which I eventually plan on trying if I'm able to upgrade to a 4WD Carvon V4 TD.
