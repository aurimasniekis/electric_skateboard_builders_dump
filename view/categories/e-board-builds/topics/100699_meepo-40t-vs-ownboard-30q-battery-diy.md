I may be building a Foosted copy DIY e-skateboard from the ground up.

Does anyone have any feedback on which one I should get?

Option 1 - Meepo's Samsung 40T - 10s2p.  8Ah . (I really like the enclosure).
Option 2 - Ownboard Samsung 30Q - 10s3p.  9Ah.

I would like to have the battery with the lowest voltage sag and longest range.

Any comments?

Between the two, 30Q would give you more range & the same amperage.
