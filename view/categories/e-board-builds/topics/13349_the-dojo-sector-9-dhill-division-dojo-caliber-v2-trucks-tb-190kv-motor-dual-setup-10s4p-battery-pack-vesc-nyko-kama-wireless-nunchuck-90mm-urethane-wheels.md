I know, me too.  but the screw tread on the clamp would only accept from one side, so I had to flip it.  would like to get comments from the others though. this is the motor mount from @torquebo

Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean. I'm using a modified TB v4 mount and clamp. I had to cut a bit of the mounting plate to extend the screw holes so I could reverse mount it.

kinda look like my build, not sure what happened, I was excited , researched everything,now I'm over a 450 limit, my deck is junk, 40 dollar ebay double kick tail modded at one end but so hard I feel like it will break, picked up a 3200 watt 80 amp 130kv alien power motor ,alien power receiver ,caliber 2 trucks tho they seem like knock offs,97mm wheels,13t/36t drive gear set 12mm wide, making my own motor mount tho I don't think I reccoment it unless u have better tools then i.still need a vesc or esc and a battery, again, got duped, wanted to build my own battery ended up with knock offs 25grams the battery weighs in at a real one should weigh at least 43grams, , in the end I will finish this board and then give it away as I have already started planning a new  build hoping it gos better then this build, anyhow, looks like a nice build going on, looking forward to a finish product so let us know how it runs kk

Now I have to figure out how to wire these into 10s4p setup. 
thinking if I need to use the battery holders or do I just hot glue them together to save space. 

what do you guys think and anyone have a wiring diagram for this?

it's reading at 41.7v total. I think this means my batteries are fully charged.  nominal voltage per cell should only be at 3.6v each, so total should only be at ~36v.

I can't wait to get my parts to start my build. I've heard you can spoil the batteries if you use a soldering iron instead of a spot welder, but it seems you didn't have that problem at all, all your batteries look good and the final voltage was perfect, good job.

Death by electric tape. 

Wrapped the battery and soldered the power and balance leads. Power leads split into Y so one goes to the switch and the other to the charging terminal with xt60 connectors.

I've ridden the board for a few kilometers now and yes, I'm losing signal along the way. it's kind of annoying actually. the receiver is inside the enclosure, so I think the enclosure is barring the signal. 

what workaround have you done to improve signal and connection? I'm thinking of putting a hole where the receiver is located and covering it probably with a screen or something. I don't know yet, still thinking.

the nunchucks look really cool, but if it keeps dropping the signal like this I might opt for a different controller. 

aside from the gt2b, what other reliable controllers are out there? is the nano x of enertion good?

you really need a stiff board if you have a huge battery. if you want to go with a flex board, you need to design your battery in such a way that it will avoid the flex. there are threads here with that kind of build.

I think I found the solution to my nunchuck dropping signal. initially and originally planned, the motors are at the back, so normally, the VESCs and the receiver are located at the back (rear wheel drive). I noticed when the signal drops, i lower my hand near the rear wheels and the signal comes back.  so, I switched the board and the motors, VESCs and receivers are in the front now (front wheel drive). I did a few kilometers on it and no signal dropped whether I was accelerating, slowing down, or cruise control. I'm a happy skater today.

Hey Jinra, why almost every board I see had their motors below the deck? They say its for protection.. but what protection if the first thing a rock will encounter once you step on it will be the motors below?? I rather prefer your installation with the motors behind the deck and up. They look sick that way. 

My question: Torque boards, Enertions, etc., mounts could be reversed from below the deck to behind the trucks as you just did with yours? 

I don't mind if I cannot stand the board on its rear end.
