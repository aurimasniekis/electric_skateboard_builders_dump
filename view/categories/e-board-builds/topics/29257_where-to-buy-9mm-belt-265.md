depends if you are stateside or international, but i usually get mine from Polybelt - really fast and pretty inexpensive! (in the US)

vbeltsupply was another some recommended and i got them even cheaper, but a bit slower shipping.  They had a lot more widths available besides just 9 and 15mm wide.

GL!

I have all 255m and 265m belts in 9, 12, and 15mm widths in stock and ready to ship.

PM me for $5 off of shipping as it does not calculate correctly
