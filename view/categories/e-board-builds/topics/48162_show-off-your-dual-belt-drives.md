My dual was nice and clean. Now it’s just nice. ![image|375x500](upload://3JPclnTjHGvsPRqSdYW6tkkDzG1.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://zhchFpyIdlDh5sebyob0J9i864r.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://oSJFGS475wrKoBJp0r3ar6CESQ8.jpeg)

Interestingly I’m in the exact same situation with same parts I have yet to ride this drive, but probably will never and sell all ( if someone interested) I am starting a DIY evolve GTX for my last Belt drive build ever 
Now everything has to be 6374 sealed sensored or nothing :stuck_out_tongue: 
Then I’ll fully embrace hubs for life

Ultimate dual drive my man, see those huge motors? Yeah man i smoke cars on the high way.


Jokes aside, this is going to be my ultimate belt drive dual thing.

Dual vesc / focbox, dual 190KV 6374 motors Evolve Trucks enclosure deck everything with a nice remote.

Should be able to handle everything put on it.

I just might not finish it this year or atleast before esk8 season is over, lack of funds makes it hard to focus on 2 projects.
