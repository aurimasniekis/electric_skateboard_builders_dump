I've been looking for a cheap 6x2 setup to try the concept for another build, spotted @dickyho was selling some cheap 6x2s with some extended Paris clones ended up buying a AWD setup with 4x 6374 170KV for $350. Well worth the risk...  if its horrible to ride I can forget wheels ever existed and I'm left with some long Paris clones 4x long mounts and 4x6374's :) 

I was upgrading the motor bullets when I realized the ones I was cutting off fitted the Diyeboard ESC ... next thing I know I've created this monster

I knew the Diyeboard pack would suck but I justed wanted to prove 6x2s and a tail works and was mildy interested to see if the diyeboard ESC drive the 6374s.

these extended Paris clones are really good value (standard on top)

that damage was me not noticing they were painted and storing them badly

impressive clearance between the 6374s

finally used my 3" bolt set

**the result** 

and I thought it had silly big wheels before...

so far done about 50 miles on it, I'm presently surprised at how much fun it is to ride, I can ollie of kerbs no problem its quite carvy and does not feel as ridiculous as it looks :smile:

as for the sag with the Diye pack 

no throttle...
![image|690x431](upload://9J2snQyNdACly6Hgrlq7LxROROZ.jpeg) 

this was what it ended up at, after dropping as far as  39.1
![image|690x361](upload://uACzVSWpkRZapScNBQpFaoDR8mg.jpeg) 

2.1v of sag with no load, its still really fun to ride :smile:

I can check weights next time i take wheel off

I do have to say it's not exactly precision got myself a caliper measure to see if I can get these pulley bolts equal

He sells in Europe only as something to do with US customs not liking them - maybe   due to the little orange man with too much power, you have ask @dickyho

Have to say for 4 x motors and mounts I'm quite happy with the value of what I got :slight_smile:

Will do vid next time I'm out, it makes a better sound than you'd imagine 

I had this lying around or I would never have bothered trying I might pop in a flipsky mini dual get some Bluetooth stats on it - is for science after all :wink:

it really is much more fun than I ever expected

https://youtu.be/_-lyJA_JOjI

I think my Shred Machine build might be getting some @Kug3lis style pant sh*ingly quick motors, some fatboys and direct drives - totally happy with how my idea of off road + kick worked out :smile:

full disclosure I was down to one wheel drive by the time I came back from this ride hehehe

I got them directly from @dickyho 

I see them here also  https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/dual-motor-setup-for-sale-can-hold-dual-6374/67037

@Kug3lis I like the skateboard feel - that's gone for me when I'm stuck to the deck - i guess if I'm going thru too many pants I might resort to bindings ;) 

@b264 if it had a little more pop it would be perfect :slight_smile: but I don't want to to try my cheap setup on my Machine deck, I want those 'first feels' to be with the best parts hehe

turned out the ESC didnt like the bumping around that much and I crushed the JST socket connecting each part of the ESC

accelerated down the hill to make sure I had momentum to make it up the other side, so solid wheels and angled bumps do not mix -first time my hard elbows saved me, knees and pucks also took a hit but I got up smiling :grinning:

hits 2" angled bump that bajaboard does not even notice...

So the deeper groove facing the road? That's what it seems like from Paris's website but just wanted to be sure.
