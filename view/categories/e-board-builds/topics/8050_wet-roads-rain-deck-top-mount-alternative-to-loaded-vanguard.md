autumn/winter is coming up and I thought a while already about building up a board that can take rain/wet roads, since I hate the days when I need to take the car or my bike to work. 

I really really LOVE my vanguard, so Im looking for a very similar feeling deck, just without a bottle nose so that the wheel spray wont really get to me, i.e. topmount is a must and it should pretty much cover the wheels. I would also try to use trucks that are more narrow than the typical calibers to really cover the wheels.

anyone got any good suggestions for a deck?

I think @jacobbloy made a really cool off road boosted board with some modifications

not looking for all terrain wheels though, just looking for a vanguard-like top mount deck that covers the wheel spray - seems quite hard to find. all flex decks I find are either pintails or bottle nose ... might have to think about wheel covers ... :laughing:

Very very disappointing @whitepony! 

We expect GF/CF wheel covers on YOUR  board! :innocent: :joy:
