Skate Shred is probably the best...

But this site also has some decent decks for good prices.

If you intend to ride long trips, I would not recommend CF decks. The vibrations numbs my foot

right, cuz they have minimal flex. thanks for the input @Mikenopolis. Anyway when getting a deck online it doesnt show the flex, how do you ascertain the amount of flex in the deck? material wise? like bamboo > southern-wood > olive wood in terms of flex? 

I am looking at just a little flex, not totally stiff, but just enough flex to absorb the vibration and yet give you control. had a stiff acton board before, feet will go numb after a mile or so

When searching online it's tough.  At least for blank/inexpensive decks.  If you instead go to Daddiesboardshop they list flex as one of the key attributes.  But those are usually a bit more $.  Definitely a better way to ascertain flex than guessing by materials.  BUT you can get a sense if you look at details - specifically plies and what type.  maple and lots of plies = stiff!  Bamboo usually = flexy.  Not sure about others - but also look at plies in general and shape.

I have a CF board - Marbel.  Yes stiff and bit of vibration, but great w/ bigger/softer wheels i'd bet and stiff usually is better at higher speed.  Experience/skill, bushings, etc. all make a big difference.

The last option would be to get something with a bit of flex expected, and if too flexy - add some CF or GF to stiffen it up!?
