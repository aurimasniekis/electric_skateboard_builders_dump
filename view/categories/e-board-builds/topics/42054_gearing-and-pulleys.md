Hey guys, wanted to start this one. My setup has 4 sk3 190kv motors, I plan to use the stock belts that come in single mount kits from diy. I've seen that alot of people use gearings around 16/36 and wondered if I would be crazy to try and  have a 3d printed wheel pulley made with 30 teeth. Will it fit comfortably with stock belts/mounts? Would 32 tooth be more appropriate? I just hate the thought that 51kph is the estimated top speed, I want at least 60 using my 10s setup while maintaining a hill gradient ability of 85%++. The calculator I'm using says stock 16/36 will take me up to 117%... where as 16/32 leaves 104%. And 16/30 allowes 98% with a top speed of 61 at 37v on 97mm wheels. Does anyone know where I could get a custom set of 18/32 out of aluminium or steel? I feel like that would be a happy medium so I'm not losing all the room to fit a belt from taking away 6 teeth on one pulley without adding to the other.

Use the 16/36 on 10s and 90mm wheels, it has been proven, don't try to invent a better gear ratio or a combination if you haven't experimented that first, even more when this seems to be your first build

Why would I use smaller wheels if I'm trying to go faster? I already have the 97s

Also im just wondering if having double the driving torque of most other boards if lowering the ratio would still perform well

Because faster mean less torque, less acceleration, because you don't know how does 60km/hr looks like in an eboard.

Experiment first, adjust latter, don't do the opposite

I agree with what youve said "higher speed means less torque" but that doesnt answer my question. Shouldn't I be able to use a slightly lower ratio for higher speed. Ideally if I have 4x the torque by using 4 motors wouldn't it be able to still perform with the same or better pulling power than 1 or 2 at the given ratio?@Eboosted

So. You want to build a 4 wheel drive eboard as your first build? Even when you haven't experimented not even a single motor build?

You muy friend... are on a dead wish. You don't know what you are wishing when you desire 60 kph.... Say again ?? 

Better luck playing Russian rulette. Is insane a 60 kph e-board. Heck, is already insane going at 40 kph.

Yeah no one here wants front page news of splattered person due to esk8, doesn't help the community or legal system when things go wrong.  I'm a big advocate of 3d printing and printed a fair amount of my components.  I've printed motor pulleys from nylon and they will hold up for some months of abuse but do show signs of wear.  Basically anything weaker than nylon (everything else you can print with) isn't likely to hold up for very long.  Good when you're pushing things like this to understand what is likely to happen when the component fails, in the case of your pulleys you are either losing the ability to continue accelerating (potentially really bad if you're already at speed or going through an intersection) or you will lose the ability to brake (also potentially really bad again mostly at intersections).

Unless you are already an avid downhill longboarder with experience in competitions I doubt if you've ever seen that kind of speed without a powered board, and a powered board is by no means safer than just bombing down a hill.  If you don't have the skills to brake at those speeds without the electronics working then you shouldn't be doing it.

Thanks for the concern guys, but this is happening, and I will be safe. Now about those pulleys... @wafflejock thank you for telling me which material would be best(nylon). Is it correct that they only work well as drivewheels pulleys and not for motor pulleys?

FYI your set up is way over kill I'm a 6'6" 300lbs rider and my set up goes about 69kph. Have you riden a board at those speeds? Honestly if you have no experience with high speed riding you are jumping way to far ahead of your self this is dangerous.

Yup nylon is the strongest option unless you go with what I'm in the process of right now which is making a mold of the 3d printed part then pouring resin into the mold that solidifies into a solid part.  Search 3d printed pulley with the search feature on the forum here and can see some attempts and failures.  The nylon one I printed for a motor pulley held up to some degree but started to deform over the course of time so I'm not sure how long that will hold up.  I just cast one using 70D hardness plastic (smoothcast 300) but ordered some "task-9" from smooth-on to make ones that should actually be reasonably durable, but proof is in the pudding.  https://photos.app.goo.gl/27c44OZkqqXwz9o62

Yah nylon is a tough one to print with, the roll needs to be dried before printing and really likes to warp while it cools so you probably want to just stick with the metal ones on the initial build.  You'll always have plenty of unforseen things to deal with even without all the custom stuff so would say go simple and proven first, then start experimenting otherwise you don't really have a baseline.

I know That, but in enertions tests and pretty much everyone I've seen, anything about 15% (9degrees) causes the motors to draw more current and from there even slow down when up to 20/25%(14/16degrees) I'm most cases the motors also got warm, I never want to worry about overheating with hills when I plan to travel over 50km(distance) per ride with high throttle @Battosaii

In everything I've read. I see that heat is wasted power as well as more chance of breaking or ruining parts. I figure being able to accomplish unthinkable feats will allow me to tackle what others struggle at with ease, while improving the longevity of my board

This is also why my 2 10s4p 20c 20 000mah batteries are each powering one end of the board, higher output availability to make each battery draw less and preserve life though I may switch it to 4 10s 2p 20c 10 000mah batteries, and put one to each motor

...which is bsht. You Googled 'steepest streets' and only shows streets in USA, England, Hawaii or New Zealand ('very objective' search by the way). Just because some Guiness dudes went down there (NZ) and magically it was like that. Here in San Fran there are steepest streets like Taylor (read: Steve McQueen's 'Bullit') which makes Baldwin in Kiwiland a walk in the park. Heck, my native Colombia (arguably the most mountainous country in the Solar system) has some steepest streets in hundreds of towns across the nation that you cannot believe it. 'The myth of Baldwin'....for the love of Godddd....  save it ....Pleaaaseeee. :rolling_eyes:

Also I should mention I'm allowing for tolerance by stating my weight is higher than actual, I weigh 145 lb, the board will weigh about 30/35 when complete. So i basically set my calculations for when I'm carrying a 20-30 lb backpack :)

god that looks nice. i assume you're gonna have all the batteries laid out in a row on the bottom?
one question though: why two receivers? you could just split the signal again, right? or daisy-chain it between the two FOCboxes on each side. I wasn't aware that the gt2b could pair to two receivers at once.

I have a similar (total) amount of battery but the way i'm setting up my board is to have the packs be swappable and only run 1 12s 5500mah block at a time

Actually I know it will look unattractive to most but I plan to make a box setup for the middle of the deck ON TOP between my feet for the battery so there's NO chance of damaging them on rocks or curbs. As for the receivers if you bind them at the same time they can run on same frequency allowing a failsafe, if for some reason one of my receivers dies the other will keep me going till I'm home, I could even go for 4 but i chose 2, my 2 focbox at front will be connected via can-bus and so will my 2 on the rear to ensure equal rotations and efficiency @faithfulpuppy
