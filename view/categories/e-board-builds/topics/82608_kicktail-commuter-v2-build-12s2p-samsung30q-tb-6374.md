Nice build! How does it ride? And how much did it end up costing you? (EDIT: never mind I see the price at the top)

It's a duplicate of my other commuter (10s3p / 6354).  But this is for my fat brother, so more volts and more motor.  So much fun to ride !


See my other build: [https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/bulletproof-commuter-kicktail-for-tight-turns-and-on-a-budget/71427](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/bulletproof-commuter-kicktail-for-tight-turns-and-on-a-budget/71427)

I havent ridden the new one yet, I need to extend the receiver wire to the VESC in the morning, then i'll take it for a spin

VESC needs to reach receiver in top left corner.
