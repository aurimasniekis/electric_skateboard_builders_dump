Hi. 
I want create sample elec. skateboard with 1 motor, 2 batteries, more power on climb to hills, speed is not important to me!

I found parts for my first skateboard but I not sure is that ok, so I need your help please:

1) Is motor holder (hole 19mm) from [--this--](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Electric-Skateboard-Pulleys-Parts-Motor-Mount-Kit-For-80-83-90-97mm-Wheels-Set/322888300829?_trkparms=pageci%3A05d1c9a5-1494-11e8-ab92-74dbd1809405%7Cparentrq%3Aa8653aca1610a884596f0364fffab77c%7Ciid%3A1&_trksid=p2481888.c100678.m3607) (or [this](https://www.banggood.com/Electric-Skateboard-Belt-Motor-Mount-Bracket-Pulley-Screws-For-839097MM-Wheel-p-1105929.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN)) site will fit to [--this--](https://www.njuskalo.hr/image-w920x690/skateboard/skateboard-slika-79399797.jpg) skateboard truck ?

2) Between original Vesc speed controller which is so expencive (19,99USD), I see that peoples use 

"FVT 120A Waterproof Brushless Sensorless ESC For 1/8 1/10 RC Car Skateboard ESC" for 45.38GBP, which is much cheaper. Look [--here--](https://www.banggood.com/FVT-CBWI120A-ESC-Brushless-Speed-Controller-For-110-and-18Series-RC-Cars-Skateboard-ESC-p-985970.html?p=JH060232116902015123&cur_warehouse=CN) Is that good speed controller for me?

3) Baterry Turnigy 3s x 2 pcs from [--this--](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Turnigy-5000mAh-3s-11-1v-20c-30c-Softcase-LiPo-Battery-XT60/192434762164?hash=item2cce0171b4:g:ooQAAOSwALhaZcgv) site. Good?

4) Other:
- Motor 6355 190 kv
- 2-4Ghz-Remote Controller with Receiver
- wheels 4x 83mm

So, I waiting your opinion about that.

If torque is your goal buy a 6374 170kw or lower. 6354 for single motor setup is a waste.

That mount is rubbish. Those trucks are not good for esk8. Esc is OK if you don't need good brakes and speed. Batteries are good.
Tell is your budget and goal.
If you're going cheap, ask @diyeboard or @dickyho.
It will be the same price but better ride quality if you buy meepo or clone board.

Thank you for answers.
I was thought about this 170 kv. So I will buy it.

Then which motor mounts are good and cheap?

Where is the best install motor, front of skateboard or on the back if I want climb uphill?

Budget are about 335 USD and goal is electric skateboard not to fast, but good for uphill(eg. When I going on beach).

```
Your range is directly related (y = kx) to watthours(wh) which is calculated by voltage times amp-hour (ah). With the same amount of packs, series and parallel arrangement will not affect the range. 
Having a parallel setup means more amp hours but you have to push more amps due to your low voltage. With packs in series, you can push in less current to achieve the same power since you have more voltage.
If anything, go with a series setup since they Have a wider speed range and put out less heat.

Just a note on your budget, esk8 is really something you don‚Äôt want to cut corners on. Unless you have mechanical background or some sort, getting away with a decent model without problems is very unlikely. Best of luck my friend. ü§ì

You can't use have two batteries in series and one in parallel. Each group of parallel batteries must be the same voltage. If you used three batteries you'd have one parallel group at 6S and one at 3S, which is Very Bad‚Ñ¢.

The motor mount might look rubbish, but when applied correctly to the truck - it is really good. I have used one before, that's why i know this. I had to file down the truck, do some precision drilling into the truck (so that the set screws hold tight) and also added epoxy in the end inbetween the mount and the truck (overkill :D ) the mount never bent or showed any kind of wear/tear - though i would avoid it myself since there are a lot better solutions out there that require about half less time to attach to the board.

What to do now? Can I try make bigger hole or buy 10 mm shaft bore?
I can't find 10 mm.

10T are too few teeth. It will be hard for the motor to pull that pulley. You should consider a minimum of 15T. So yes, change that pulley for a more swift gear like 15T and Up.

I have had the same problem with the 10mm shaft. Almost every pulley has a 8mm hole in it.

You can solve it by drilling a 10mm hole in the pulley (drillpress recommended). That's how I have solved it. But: your pulley, just like mine, is pretty thin. I was lucky enough that the pulley didn't break because the walls around the hole are pretty thin already. If drilling didn't work and the pulley has snapped you can buy another pulley. 

The specs you need to consider are:

- Same teeth ratio, so 10 for you I think
- inside bore diameter of 10mm (you can go something bigger like 15mm, because you have to drill the 10mm hole in it by yourself. I am not 100% about that so look that up :smile: )

I hope this has helped you

No luck. It's broken.
![DSC_0142|375x500](upload://r7QoavDkmxWdrFwNJYLlCqVyULA.JPG)

The problem will be because I have to short belt, and if I want install new bore with more teeth it will be larger than last, so I must buy a new belt?
I can't find bore with 10mm hole and belt for it in one set. 
My belt was 10mm width and other bels for sell are 16, 20 mm..

Hi.
One of my battery all 3 cells stop charging at 3.71v.

Is that because I charge them without "ballance charge"?
So, how to return it to start charging 4.2v, do I must discharg them and charge again but this time in ballance charge?
```

## \#59 Posted by: E1Allen Posted at: 2018-04-14T17:23:42.835Z Reads: 52

Yes balance charge. Why didn't you every time?

You're probably going to have to make a small pin connector to the balance lead for just the low cell and charge at 1a for that individual cell.  

That's if it's not ruined.  If you took that battery and ride with it that one cell will now over discharge compared too the charged cells

Make something similar to this. ![image|375x500](upload://qjJR8Rlv2AQYEL8c7fw7ns0k2a9.jpg)

![image|375x500](upload://nPPiDOTv0NzTBDrTO9l7mnig870.jpg)

This let's you charge or discharge ONE cell through the balance lead.  No more than 1A charge or discharge.  Small wires can't handle more current.

So your low cell you can charge to what the others are then balance charge the whole pack.

You don't need the xt60 on the end. It could go to alligator clips or whatever so long as you check which cell is low and make sure positive and negative are connected correctly

I try ballance after, but not climbing, it stay at 3.71. That is reason because i want discharge them and hope that next ballance will work.

Other battery i start with ballance and it was ok.

It's an option on the charger. You charge your lipos to 3.7v if you don't plan on using them for a few days or more is recommended

They all charged to same voltage. 3.71, so he might have done BAL STO or whatever.

Again after discharge and again charge with ballance stop at 3.71.
Wierd is that on beggining sometimes was R: 2SER  S: 3SER, but sometimes when reconnect is R: 3SER  S: 3SER.

Damn someone call fire brigade :D I suggest first read the basics, because you don't even understand anything about the batteries... If you play with them like you told now, you will need a real fire brigade because Li-Poly batteries are not so fun then they catch on fire because of mischarging, bad discharging and etc ;)

Yes, checking..and charger let me..
Thank you.
Sorry.
Dont must call brigade for 2 minutes I think :) 
I know something about batteries.

I was have a braik and read that A must be 1.5 for charge that battery, then I try again and weird, voltage cells jump to 3.75 (from 3.72) and start normally charge :-o

Somewhere been wall (error)which charger can't cross and stuck.
So, i think that now working.
