It's time to build a decent looking board. I am just about done with my franken-board. But here is a bit of background. Two years ago, I built the [first board](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/subhransu-board-1-scsk8-bamboo-paris-raw-180-torqueboards-6355-diy-motor-mount-2x-3s-5000mah-b-grade-li-po-hobbywing-s5-rtr/6054?u=mishrasubhransu) pretty cheaply, handmade a lot of things and was a lot of fun. I later upgraded parts like TB trucks, wider trucks, HK 8S 8AH lipo and finally vescs. This was a stable build that kept working until I fully drained the hobby king battery. I mounted whatever battery I could find into what I now call the Hammerhead board and upgraded the wheels to MBS all terrain. Back on it's legs, err wheels, it just continues to work without any maintenance(in terms of belt and screw tightening) and is a great commuter board.

So I thought to make some hardware first and then work on the software and testing. 
I am designing the remote from scratch. Also, I'll be using a potentiometer  instead of hall effect sensor.

Did it like this(Work in progress though). But it was not straight forward. I heated the whole thing up using a heat gun and then made it conform to the board while wearing thermal gloves. .

Altar wedge is perfect for NESE modules, but the shape of my deck made it a pain in the ass.

Looks like you've gotten it to conform to the deck after heating it up though

I have to admit... with the amazing DIY work you’ve been doing the rest of this build I feel like you could do better on the enclosure. Psychotiller does a great job with everything, but ABS isn’t meant to really bend as much as that deck and reheating gets rid of the defined shape. Maybe fiberglass? Not trying to put it down at all - I’ve been very impressed with every aspect of this - I just think if you take another go at it you’ll be happy with the results.

Thanks for the kind words. Regarding your thoughts on the enclosure, that is precisely how I feel too.  I wanted a tested enclosure, so went for Tiller's, didn't anticipate what I had to do to make it work and how ugly it might look after. Haha. 

I have a pretty good model of the deck in CAD and an enclosure that I designed. So I have these options:
1. Print that enclosure. Print it in parts and glue it together using some flexible epoxy. 
2. Do above(a tiny bit smaller)  but then instead of using that enclosure, turn it into a mould for a fiberglass shell. 

This is a no frills enclosure just for the NESE + DieBieMS, where the VESC is mounted just above the rear trucks. I can easily modify it to have the VESCs inside too

It will work absolutely fine in there, if you have a flat-ish deck.

My deck has a agressive w shape and that made it hard.

Luckily I decided to be crazy and learn how to make decks.....so the one I made for this is good and flat on the mounting spot.

Only problem is I cut the first one just a tad too short on the corners so the enclosure hangs over just a bit in all 4 corners.

Currently working on a hydraulic press to make a new deck.

So it's finally complete. I have the following update:
1. It's nicely setup with DieBieMS with push to start. I made my own casing for the DieBieMS which is not the standard N.E.S.E case for the BMS. It is roomier for removing the balancing connector easily and also for routing the balance wires. 
2. The rear motor guard also acts as mount spacer. 
3. It's pretty much sealed everywhere except where the wires enter. I plan to print a part in TPU(flexible) filament and pass all the cables through it. Sealing is done using a 3mm rubber sheet from [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0787TLP6D). 
4. The ppm receiver is all the way to the front so that there is little interference from the switching action going on in the back.
5. Everything has been mounted to the board with some sort of vibration dampeners. The escs hang using rubber standoffs. 


Pretty happy with it. Now I have to put grip on top. I have a transparent one. **Should I use that or go with glass fritz for this deck?**

Zero wheel bite. Well it was an hour worth of work. 

I actually cut the deck on the corner to do it. Basically took a Dremel with a router bit and slowly cut while checking for bite. I would apply a bit of pain on the tires and then step on the deck and lean as much as possible with trucks pretty loose. Where the wheel touches it would leave the paint on the deck. I would then remove it. Doing this 3-4 times I have one corner completely free from wheel bite. To do this on the rest 3 corners I simply traced the new outline on a paper and then used that as a template to Mark the rest of the corners with a permanent marker. Then boom, rest 3 cut within 10 mins.

@Benjamin899, what measurements do you need?

@torqueboards, the new replacement clamps that I got are wonderful. They also had this 11mm circular cutouts 5mm deep on one side and 3mm deep on the other side. Since I had the whole assembly cadded up I knew exat what length of shaft to put in between them. So I lathed a plastic tube to have 11mm OD and put M6 threads on them. That with the mount spacers/motor guard made the assembly absolutely perfect. 

Is that the intended use of those holes on the clamp? BTW, oneside being 3mm and other side being 5mm meant that I had to grind a nut to be of 3mm height. What's the right way to deal with it?

@mishrasubhransu haha :cry: you jus had to flip the clamp. It is for a support bar. We have some if you're using our 218mm Trucks and 15mm wide belts. The support bar is on the 5mm depth side with a 3mm depth on the opposite side that way the bolt head is flushed. Email us for more info :smile:

The deck is very stiff so pretty stable in that sense. I have been riding it comfortably without grip tape because my feet feel very secured pushed against the deep drop. 

Pneumatic make it very comfortable and safe. I don't fear getting stopped by twigs, rocks or cracks anymore. That has happened a few times before at low speed.

So I rode it in rain for 2.2 miles and, sigh :(, water got in, although, not too much just water stuck on surface and droplets here and there. I suspect the majority of water entered from where the phase wire comes out, but I see a little bit of water everywhere so I am not sure. I won't be riding it in rain until I figure the waterproofing out. If nothing I'll just silicone clauk and smear it on all the entry points. 

But handling and braking is really good. Granted I was riding at 15mph, but they just felt normal.

The rear lift handle is soooo damn convenient. I just lift the rear and drag it around like a trolley.  I have a kayak handle that @b264 kindly gave me along with a deck but felt that wouldn't be a good fit here, plus there is no space underneath to put it. 

This is almost the final look(still gotta put the pulley cover). I was thinking of making the edges of the deck black, not sure how it would look. Any ideas on that?

BTW, this is fine example how NESE could be cheap. You just need to source some components in a hardware store, find a friend with 3d printer or go to where its cheap to print. People dont want to put in effort and take whats on the plate. They rather complain that supplier does not do that work for them for free.
So thanks for this example how nice and not overly expensive things can get done with some involvement.

@mishrasubhransu was gonna point out one thing. The way you printed your module holders is not ideal unless they hold well. @banjaxxed printed them vertical and that is far better orientation for strength in the direction you need them to be . Its tricky orientation to get printed well but you can get those solid CAD supports in.

@agniusm already has the files for 2p modules or 2s2p modules(not sure which one you want) at http://18650.lt/index.php/resources/. 

He's also testing some new box design to make sure there is increased distance between cells not a part of the same P group.(basically more distance between middle 2 cells)

He doesn't offer more than 2s4p/4p+4p  because the box can't hold a compression. But I made a custom that can go up to 8p+8p because I use a thick divider in between and hence nicely maintains compression.

Three major things done. 
1. Conformal coatings on DieBieMS and FSESC6.6s. 
a. Make the circuit boards water proof as another line of defence against water
b. Almost waterproof because of connectors. One could solder directly to the pins and then put conformal coating for making it 100% waterproof. 
c. I took the heat sink off, cleaned it nicely with rubbing alcohol and a tooth brush, sprayed some more alcohol for a final rinse. Let it dry and then put the coating while regularly inspecting with UV light
2. Painting the pulley covers and motor guards
a. coarse sanding -> filler primer -> med wet sanding -> filler primer -> fine wet sanding -> paint -> top coat(optional)
b. Surface finish is nice but should have used bondo to make surface uniform first. Filler primer is only for tiny gaps and imperfections.
c. I used a top coat that made it semi glossy, good that the paint will last but bad because I like the matte finish of the primer better.
3. Sealing the insert holes with epoxy 
a. My insert holes went all the way through to the top, this caused water to seep inside the enclosure from the top when riding in rain. 
b. sealed it with some epoxy. Will put some primer and then try to match the board color.

The wheel guards outer diameter didn't take into account the fact that it's a 158mm wheel after inflation(and not 150mm as they are marketed), so makes a small scraping sound. My printer is down, will print new wheel guards then.

So have been riding in light rain and so far no water inside. My approach was 2 fold. 
1. use a thick grease that acts as a seal
2. hot glue the edges. 

I opened it after the third time riding in rain and didn't find a drop inside. My plan is to check for water in enclosure using a humidity sensor. I think I can interface one with DieBieMS. @JTAG, does it already have a humidity sensor? I saw something in the DieBieMS tool. 
A quick search gave me this

Of course if the true tire dia is a bit off the distance would be a bit off too. I entered my tire dia as 155mm(measured it to be 158mm when filled to 72psi) but still the distance is a bit overestimated. Could also be that the true distance moved is higher but the lack of fine grained accuracy of GPS smoothes out the path giving a lesser distance. But it's negligible so I'll let it be.

Also new covers printed and painted. A bit more aesthetically pleasing design. They are made to fit the TB clamp with 4 grub screws. I had 2 extra ones after I got the updated clamp from . Instead if buying those clamps, you can just 3d print a similar one. The files are available in the thingivere link available somewhere above.

It's been absolutely great. Have been using it daily for almost a month. Was annoyed to lift and carry the board before I made it. Especially because my hand would get dirty from all the mess stuck to the bottom and also weight. With this you get off you board and carry it around like a trolley, even works on stairs. 

I printed it in PETG, it's hella strong. Check this out.

absolutely, but it's absolutely not needed because the combination of pneumatics and deep drop(that you can place your leg against) makes it super comfortable. I used to have bindings on my 100mm mbs board but not on this one. Heck, I don't even need a grip tape. Plus you get a clean look without  the bindings

I can imagine it's super comfortable and I agree with the cleaner look. I sometimes do miss the bindings on my EVO falcon though, especially when riding in a city. The turning radius is often insufficient and there's no kicktail. On my MTB with the MBS bindings I can easily lift the front and rotate on the spot. On the falcon, I have to get off the board. I think a simple binding would fix this. It would probably also allow me to turn more aggressively.

Or maybe I just need more practice. :) Sorry for taking your thread off-topic. If anyone wants to react, I suggest we move the discussion to [this thread](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/better-than-freeboard-bindings/60978?u=janpom).

First time riding in rain after fitting those front wheel guards on. They perfectly do their job. No throwing off water on me or underneath the board. But couldn't continue riding because my left shoe(I ride goody) and pant was starting to get went from the spray from rear wheel. Really annoying. Can't wait to have the rear ones done. They are a bit harder because of the motor mount.

I printed your grab handle thinking that it would be bolted down using the truck screws, removing the need to drill the deck.

I was wrong.

Anyway, any chance you can modify the handle so that it would work as I described? Maybe instead of two legs it can be a whole plate that covers the baseplate area so all 4 baseplate holes are used? Kinda like a reverse riser.

The front left one broke, precisely where I thought it might. Since it's supported at one end it vibrates like a cantilever and broke under fatigue failure. It broke when I was riding over some rough patch of street (that I ride on everyday). I have the following solution in mind. 

1. Increase thickness in the area that broke
2. Skin it in carbon fiber
3. Make changes in design to incorporate rods in radial fashion. 
4. Change material to PETG(the current front ones are ABS)

Any suggestions? Maybe @Pedrodemio, @Maxid @Riako?

The problem is only in the interface because inside it can't move and outside it can. So basically that's an area of high stress concentration.

No point in going for ribbing, if I am thickening only a small area.

Consider printing in Nylon. PETG can be brittle, especially compared to Nylon... I've never had a Nylon part break, only flex to the point where it was unusable in that design (and used further beefed up designs to compensate).

Since using Nylon, I only really use PETG when I want the print to be easier to print and is non-load bearing or the design is super beefy enough that if it were load bearing, that huge chunk of PETG I print will for sure be able to handle it.

I use inland brand Nylon, sold at microcenter. I don't know how it compares to all the tulman stuff, it's way too expensive for me as well so I've just never tried it, but the inland stuff works flawlessly for me in application. It's like $15/kg

Keep in mind if you go this route, it's a bit more involved than PLA or PETG. You print ABS, so you know warping and how to mitigate it I assume, just expect to have to dry the filament occasionally in the oven prior to printing, and store in a dry box.

The inland stuff is [$17/lb](https://www.microcenter.com/product/485160/inland-175mm-natural-nylon-3d-printer-filament---05kg-spool-(11-lbs)) not /kg. I was researching on the printability of nylon and came to the conclusion that Taulman bridge($25/lb) or Taulman 910($36/lb) are vastly superior. Also 910 has crazy tensile strength, so that might be especially useful for my NESE modules.  

Anyway to cut the story short, I bought a 1lb spool of Taulman 910 :smiley: Will let everyone know if it it's worth the hype.

My second try at magnetic charging connector that I found was a fail too. @Maxid, what I mentioned today about the male half short circuiting itself, was wrong.  I agree, it would solve the problem if I were to press a button to start the charge, but then that's one more step. I would rather just plug in the standard 2.5mm connector and let it charge. 

I'll reiterate since other's don't know what I am talking about. Basically I got 2 of these magnetic charging connector as sample from alibaba a long time ago.  It worked but sparks flew each time, and got bigger bigger and didn't work finally.

![IMG_20190308_190645|666x500](upload://hHTKzw0INdqHNa5FKvgi7vU514O.jpeg)

Closer inspection led me to believe that since I was supplying power through the male(one with raised connector), it was somehow getting shorted during the mating process for a brief second and hence sparked. So I decided to flip the male and female connector on my second attempt. I was so sure this would work. But alas you can see in the video below, I still have the same problem. I guess spark happens due to the sudden inrush of current as the mating has even barely begun. Also what exacerbates the problem is that the connectors are tiny themselves. Sparks fly very easily from pointed surfaced. 
https://photos.app.goo.gl/gM1nnWiuVq7wJEwcA


@JTAG, is there a way to avoid the sudden rise of current during charging. The tiny magnetic connectors can handle 2A or so without getting hot but it's sparking at the beginning of the mating. If not, I guess I just have to get bigger pogo pins.

The BMS had a diode at its input so the BMS is not delivering the current or power for the spark, it is likely because the charger presents the voltage on the connector and that is briefly shorted during the mating cycle. I am afraid I can't fix that.

You could mate the connector and then apply mains to the charger :P but that might not be the most ideal solution.

Broken Wheel Guards Update:
![IMG_20190316_185925|666x500, 50%](upload://t6gW89aOJac6pkha1CIAPVYW8i9.jpeg) ![IMG_20190309_131147|666x500, 50%](upload://roWUlW2815EY2o8PV1iTtexrM0W.jpeg)

I broke all the guards, front and rear, left and right. Didn't matter whether printed in PETG or ABS. So made the main curvy part thicker 2.4mm(from 2mm) to increase stiffness, decrease vibration and reduce fatigue. Also reinforced the areas which actually broke. Also made the wheel guards a bit slimmer , which I think looks modern. Looks almost flush with the wheels. 

Have ridden about a 100km on the updated wheel guards and they haven't failed me yet. So I am not using the Taulman 910 alloy yet(I would rather use it to make super high strength parts like clamps and stuff).  I have updated the [thingiverse link](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392881) with the latest designs.

The latest design which has held up for more than 100km was printed out of some cheap red pla. I recently painted them black. I didn't put much effort into sanding them this time, you can see that in the paint finish. Also another thing to note is that the front clamps are now 3D printed too(in PETG), ditched the spare TB clamps.

Really love the build and the parts list! How are the specs on this board speed and range wise?

Thank you :slight_smile: 

I forgot what my theoretical top speed is but I regularly ride above 40kmph(27mph). Max is 44 on the app. Range is a bit more than 16 km(10miles). Vesc goes into a low battery mode after that, but still one is able to use it. I haven't tested the true full range.. 

Below is a screenshot from my metr pro app. I had already accumulated 300km(186miles) before I installed metr pro.

These days I had an idea of making removable and foldable mud guards, really compact to be always on the backpack and just a few seconds to install all four

The project is a bit on hold since the rain stopped for a few weeks

just went for a spin on my board, it is just awesome! so comfy :smiley: 

I have only some overcurrent issues that are really anoying, it cuts off hard when accelerating to fast, it throws me off balance, don't want that when doing 41kph (damn, that is quick :scream:)

My setup:
- 2x 6365 170kv
- 2x vesc 4.12
- DieBieMS
- 10s3P (samsung 30Q)
- 1:4 pulley ratio

I ran the auto detect (without wheels and belts) and VESCtool came with motor current of 58A
I'm not sure how VESC handles the max batt current, is it per VESC or in total
I would rather have a slow cutoff instead of this harsh one.

Are you connected through canbus? Then you get both the VESC data combined but for split ppm, no. 

Try setting the motor current to lower. And give it one more try on a steep incline. That way you consume high current but not going fast.

Actually, ask Trampa on the VESC tool 2019 thread how overcurrent happens if vesc decides the max current.

Raise the absolute max current. It is only set to 65 so yes you will get an over current fault if you are riding dual with those amps per motor. 

160 is the max value in firmware 3.39 which is what I use.

Thanks for the suggestions, i'll give it a spin! 

I think I'll have to start working on a larger battery (4p instead of 3p), current 10s3p pack can supply 45A (as per 30Q datasheet).

Have been cruising a few times with these settings, seems well, until last Saturday, my brother took a spin, he whas launched of the board (no helmet, but managed to brake the fall with his hands ). Apperantly the board brake hard spontanious (it is set to -50A :roll_eyes:), still can't figure out what exactly happened, when the remote disconnects, the throttle is 0 and no braking (tested that failsafe condition), only thing i can think of is a magnetic field near the remote (using Solidgeeks remote with hall effect sensor for throttle)

That sucks man, hope it doesn't hurt too much. I strongly suggest to use the $19 remote from [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/2-4GHz-Remote-Transimitter-Receiver-Binding-Plug-for-Electric-Skateboard-OS917/173406680080) to confirm that it's not a remote issue. I have 2 of them and never have they disconnected or caused erratic behaviour.

He looked pale for a moment and was scared to ride the board back to me so he took a walk, his hands are a bit scuffed-up,(Tarmac doesn't go well with skin)

There is something to say for an of the shelf remote like that but I like the advanced features of the OLED remotes (and the fun of building it)

I'm building a firmware based StefanMe feather remote safety features and Droidsector core and UI for development ESP32.

I hate when that happens but still 100X better than broken bones.

Sure, but all I am saying is test your new board with that to confirm that the vesc setting or something else is not an issue.

The trolley style handle printed solid with petg broke after 500km. It broke exactly in the same portion last time, and I had then beefed it up. I guess time to beef it up further and hopefully I can make it last more than 1000km this time. 

I think it's the daily lifting and putting it down is what weakens it. Fatigue failure.

I think I found out what went wrong,... I run a DieBieMS BMS and the overcurrent was set to 120A (hard shutoff), when I was experimenting with the overcurrent jerk from the VESC I increased only the VESC setting to 160A, You could guess what went wrong ;-)

Although I still don't understand why he said it felt like full lock at the wheels, I guess that it was just freewheeling and because of the belt ratio it slows down quite rough, when you leaning forward for accelrating and it suddenly decides shuts off you'll lose balance and get thrown off the board.

Didn't you order some nylon? I'd give that a go next time, and dye it black with Rit Dye in hot water.

Yeah, but I was putting off printing in Nylon until I installed the (bondtech BGM clone + e3D v6  all metal clone)direct drive setup. I finished printing all 4 pneumatic wheels for elofty and now I can give the printer a break and upgrade. 

I was already using bondtech BMG clone, just added the e3D v6 clone + pancake to make it direct drive for 2 reasons:
1. All metal are not that good with retraction and direct drive helps with that because retraction needed is very less. Like 0.5mm or so
2. I can go 260c(without melting the PTFE tube) for better layer adhesion.
