Hi community!

I am currently working on my 2nd build which was originally meant to be a carvon speed drive R on some 100mm all terrain wheels.

But since I had no idea when the drive would arrive I chose to buy 2x 6374 motors to pair with 15mm belts.

All my parts arrived including the 6374's, but then today I received my carvon drive.

The thing is that I would like to use all terrain wheels, but since carvon has had trouble manufacturing the correct adapters for those wheels. They sent me some 97mm wheels already fitted on the drive plus 4 all terrain 100mm wheels. They will then ship the adapters to me when they are manufactured. (Thanks to Jerry for the complentary 97's)

What do you think I should do? Use the 97's or wait for the adapters or finish my build using the belt drive.

Anyway here is my first build thread. I will update over the next couple of weeks.

I think you basically have to use the Carvon, if you don't members from this forum will enter your home at night and relieve you of it.

Also the adult in me wants to be offended by your name but the child in me pushed quite a bit of air out of my nose when I read it.

You have only one option.
Make two boards...
Or if you have a wife and kids...make 3 boards. 
One board is not an option :smiley:

So I was finally able to make some progress on my build today. I am still recovering from a broken elbow. It has proven to be quite difficult doing everyday stuff only using my left hand üòÅ

Anyway I decided to save the 6374's for another build. I am thinking a trampa off road build with big fat tires. Maybe with a direct gearing setup.

So carvon on 97mm until I'll have the right adapters for unstoppable all terrain wheels. 

Even though it wasn't much progress, I still want to share it with you guys. 

I mounted my carvon drive and matching 97mm wheels in front.

Mounted the first four tread screws for the Enclosure. And semi mounted the Enclosure, thinking 6 more screws will do.![IMG_20180617_205402|375x500](upload://cM4x7wC6b5s9H2xDklJXaWEoUPX.jpg)

![IMG_20180617_210805|375x500](upload://46v9CHtZmUk030KCW8FwmZKPXIK.jpg)
In the following week I'll finish the Enclosure screws and next drill all the holes necessary for voltmeter, on/off button and the motor wires.

The final steep will then be to program the foc boxes for the new motors.

Also I received my Ruroc helmet this Friday. üôè

It really isn't that much, about 3-3.5 cm. I like to think that it's a low clearance track beast üòâ
