Alright, after a lot of time talking to some esk8 wizards, I have reformulated my plan a bit.

I am planning on using a Landyachtz Switch 40, with torque boards 218mm trucks, and MBS 100mm All Terrain Wheels. I currently have 1/2 inch risers on, but may have to add another 1/4 inch on.

Under, I will be using 5x 2s 5000mah lipos, going to a 10s Bms as seen here; http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/high-power-10s-lipo-battery-pack-with-bms/10014

I am using a single Turnigy 6374 192 KV motor with 15/36 pulleys in the @marcmt88 full drivetrain kit.

I will be using a VESC, most likely this one to save a little bit of money; products/torque-esc-bldc-electronic-speed-controller

I will either be buying or making a slim enclosure, haven't decided yet. I also an undecided on transmitters and other components. 

Am I missing any thing that will cause this build not to work?

looks good...make sure to work out how youre going to power it on....
alot of people go with either an anti-spark switch or a simple loop key.

```
The Bestech bms has a built in E-switch eliminating the need for a loop key or other antispark switch.

How does this switch work? I saw a few pictures of two white wires labeled as the switch but am unsure exactly how you would go about powering it on and off.

```
The wires go to a normal push button switch (I think it must be latching?) and when pressed goes on and vise versa

```
As @pat.speed said, a normal 12v push button latching switch or an on/off toggle switch.

The Bms E-switch turns the system on and off and also resets the bms if it goes into protection mode.
