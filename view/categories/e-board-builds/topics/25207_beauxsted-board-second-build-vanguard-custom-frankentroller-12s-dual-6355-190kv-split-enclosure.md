This has been a long time in the making, I have been having a ton of fun riding around on my[ first build](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-build-ebay-deck-190kv-tb-motor-diyes-vesc-12s-5ah-single-drive-diyes-mount-modded-diyes-enclosures/9904/7) whilst perfecting everything on my second build. Everything I learnt from that build I have built upon and improved for this!

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/9/89ddd94dc7d25047a2da7395353f8a34744fba69.jpg" width="690" height="344">

Like a lot of people I imagine, my inspiration for building an electric board was the Boosted Board. To begin with, I just didn't want to pay the Boosted price, but soon found that actually, I could build a board that was superior (in performance anyway) than the Boosted.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/7/473a5063ffa96ce6ca7590b27fec6a6813658bbb.jpg" width="690" height="344">

I still really believe that Boosted have the best looking pre-build on the market, so I have been heavily inspired by the V2 (Read: shamelessly copied). Also, I'd like to give shoutouts to @okp, @squad, @eboosted, @denton, @JuniorPotato93 and a ton of others for the inspiration and/or help!

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/c/7cce975a53891ef1f2d47e17ed8f974c4f5fbb0b.jpg" width="500" height="500">

Although altogether a bit of a faff, I can't fault the parts I got through the UK group buy. The motor mounts designed by @JuniorPotato93 are rock steady and look amazing, the one piece design looks so much neater than the 2 part I had on my old build. The CNC Kegel pulleys he designed also work amazingly and work without a retainer on the outside, meaning the green cores are visible on the rear wheels. This makes me happy!

I designed and had printed some belt covers for @JuniorPotato93's mounts. [Which you can get here.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2246770)

I also designed some risers with built in bash guards for the Vanguard and with phase/sensor wire management, inspired by @okp. [You can also download these here.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2248562)

For my battery enclosure, I looked around at some designs out there and played around with the idea of thermoforming ABS over a shaped wood, but finally came to the conclusion that I'd design my own. I used Sketchup (Horrible for this kind of thing, have since learned Onshape, much better) to draw up a design and posted it on here. Luckily for me, it was adopted by @Eboosted who modified (and made it bigger and therefore better) and made it into reality by 3D printing it and adding a fibreglass inner layer for strength.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/7/b77099f6c862ff0a434c6c125a04550388d107b9.jpg" width="690" height="345">

Testing for fit when it arrived, PERFECT! As is the fashion, I routed out channels between the two enclosures with a Dremel and laid in 10AWG cable. (Didn't take any photos of this part though, was bricking it),

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/6/26283255ef589324b6963ea07e4b696bd12b34b0.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I added a rubber seal around the inside, in an effort to minimise road dust coming in. I doubt it'd be waterproof but I think it should be at least "splash proof" for the occasional puddle.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/f/4fe04235f6508cc629bf88c65ee2a2a90384cbb7.jpg" width="666" height="500">

The layout in the battery enclosure consists of 3x Zippy Compact 4s 5000mAh Lipos, an anti-spark switch with 40A fuse, BMS and a voltage regulator to run the power switch LED. I originally planned to integrate @raphaelchang's Battman, and had plans for all its smart features (Like mounting a Neopixel in the switch for State Of Charge indication and other stuff) but I missed the Beta!

Rats nest...

LED Switch and charge port installed.

For the rear enclosure, there wasn't a great deal of room for the dual VESC, receiver and bluetooth module along with all the wiring. Looking at Boosted's internal wiring, and having seen @squad's solution, I came up with something similar.

**_BRAAAAINS..._**

With the remote, I didn't have a lot of choice. I really hate trigger remotes, they are super unintuitive for me and that restricts my options somewhat. The Nano remote gets super bad press (although my first build uses one and it has been great). So I looked elsewhere and picked up a Benchwheel remote, this seemed to have good backing and good reliability, although this wasn't the case for me unfortunately. Mine was really unreliable, sometimes not even connecting at all. I decided to pick up a Mini remote, which is really reliable but uses a trigger control.

**What I like about the Benchwheel remote:** Form factor, rechargeable.
**What I like about the Mini remote:** Reliability, instant connection.

So, basically, I decided to put the insides of my Mini remote into the Benchwheel case!

I utilised the power switch and joystick from the Benchwheel and connected them to the mini remote PCB, I also used the Lipo (with a 3.3v regulator) and added a micro USB charging board. I Sugru'd the connector where the original port was and built a low battery circuit which will flash a red LED when the voltage drops below 3.2v. I rerouted the 4 LEDs for Power, Charging, Fully Charged and Low Battery to the original holes in the remote.

hands down, one of the cleanest builds on here :heart_eyes: !
Didn't you feel the urge to use 18650 on this build ?
Also how are you attaching the wheel pulley to the kegels without a retainer ring ? Glued ?

Thanks man! I did, but then when I looked at cost, having to get tools or someone to weld for me, and the possibility of voltage sagging, I just ended up grabbing some Lipo's and being done with it. Definitely a possible future upgrade though.

The pulleys are simply bolted on the same as they would with a retainer, except the bolts tighten up against the holes in the core:

(Bad pic sorry!)

So far I have seen zero movement or bolt loosening (Loctite all the things) or anything, but will be keeping an eye on them anyway!

See here from another thread:

[quote="jackw, post:66, topic:18360"]
Hey guys. What's the behaviour like on your Benchwheel remotes? I have both the Winning V1 (which for me has been excellent with no problems!) and recently gotten my hands on the Benchwheel for my 2nd build.

I was wondering about yours, because if I compare the two, firstly the Benchwheel seems to have a much bigger dead-zone than the winning, regardless of my settings in the VESC (even down to 0.01MS). A good few millimetres travel from centre on the Benchwheel don't show up as changing the pulse-width in the VESC so I'm assuming thats some kind of slop in the potentiometer.

Secondly, and more annoyingly, the pairing is much worse in my experience. Not the initial pairing as that worked fine once I figured out the correct procedure, but the pairing when you power on the board and the remote. Now, the Winning V1 has been awesome on my first build (and the same if I bring it across to my second build) and super fast and non-fussy (?) when turning on. Doesn't matter which you turn on first or at what time, once they are both on they are connected within a second or two. The Benchwheel on the other hand is super unreliable, sometimes connecting, sometimes not, usually I have to have the board on first before turning on the remote, in which case it sometimes finds the remote, and sometimes doesn't, even if i cycle the remote on or off after the board has been turned on, it just won't find it. Do you think I have a dodgy remote/receiver? Or is this normal behaviour with having  to make sure the board is on and then the remote (Quite inconvenient in day to day usage, especially if I'm not even sure if the remote has connected as when the receiver is in the enclosure I can't exactly check the see if the LEDs are blinking on the Rx!)

Sorry for the wall of text, I've become quite obsessed with getting my second build perfect and wanted the benchwheel remote to be a part of that! :stuck_out_tongue:

Gotcha! Weird, since my experience with pairing on startup has been nearly instantaneous. I've never had a problem with the deadzone, but I can see how you might. Either way, amazing job on both the board and remote. Certainly wish I had the time to learn more about electronics and hardware.

@Jackw this is the best build I've seen here, it's so perfect you might want to consider to hang it on the wall for daily praising.

Congrats, you are raising the bar on Vanguard builds!

Get 40 Samsung 30Q for the next upgrade they are really worth it.

Thanks! As far as cost, I'm not too sure as I have been building it on and off for about 6 months and haven't been keeping a running total (I might try and work it out though), speed wise I've hit 25mph with plenty of power left, but still yet to do a max speed/range test. Boosted's battery is 99Wh compared to 222Wh on my board for some idea. The flex is exactly the same as both my board and the Boosted use flex 3 Vanguards.

Cheers! Yes I am using a BMS, if you look at the internals shot you can see it tucked underneath at the front of the batteries. I'm just using a 5.5mm x 2.5mm DC jack (under the power switch) with a 50.4v "Laptop" style charger.

What does the LED switch actually control seeing that you also have an anti-spark switch as well?

Thanks dude! The LED switch is connected to the anti-spark switch circuit to turn it on and off.

My version of the anti-spark circuit board doesn't have an LED option built in like some do, so I have to run a drop down regulator for the switches LED so I don't pop it with 50v full battery voltage.

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1929304
Because the maker of this file made something wrong and you cant print it because there is no volumen!

I printed myself those boxes: (they are very well, I am satisfied with those👍)

I thnik the focboxes will handle it!


You can calculate it on a webside:
http://calc.esk8.it/#{"batt-type-lipo":1,"batt-cells":6,"motor-kv":190,"system-efficiency":85,"motor-pulley-teeth":15,"wheel-pulley-teeth":36,"wheel-size":80}|

Yes, at 10s with 270kv you will exeed the 60.000 erpm limit, and most likely blow the drv. Go for a 190kv and you'll be all fine
