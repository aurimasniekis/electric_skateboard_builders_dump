About to start my first build. I intend to do a complete YouTube multi part step by step tutorial. Most of what I'm going to do has already been done but I am going to build a custom ESC/ receiver box out of kydex, it will hold everything including a battery meter and flush mount xt60 connection, as well as provisions for future changes like anti spark switch, other mounts, switches... And will be waterproof. I'll post pics as I progress. Wish me luck!<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/c/ac497482d2f18ce3415b9805f327471dd9c700aa.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Coming along, remote mod is done. Motors mounted, battery compartment started, waiting on epoxy to dry. And started making a buck for the kydex ESC box. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/4/24835f7f0d7a18b6fa7be6e8039468268cfc528d.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/f/8fcba16fe215dd859400158d5ee6b684a4b40ae0.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/f/cf9e55de7c6f8c051a0c1259ca5ddbb6b6063cb5.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/d/dd3c52f17c44e7ad4dce9193658a574c8a6ead3b.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/0/50925ea3882718ff404ca2579fb796950ebf82ee.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/1/514552a8b9d0b178020d44c049477e6c28c0faf6.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/6/9682c4a66b5d6f45c6cb6f833e12a396b58d0d5a.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/f/7f7606d06e9a55e2da2e6f7714c7b02d9353756a.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/9/59e7e97f4e38ee0bf3869202d5dd2d4d669b9578.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/b/1bf454915085d1d7d7b8bc5ea5b81e1df909b7b1.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/3/d373fc9ff75b65d4d46438a475aae1ccb3593a93.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/7/d7bf2199570c90742abec2d0f066ddeb2caddf00.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/b/5b8d095b3cdbac9dcc52007c622da950d0931e97.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/0/80c675eca76569c32d44ac078e003ce162c17e8c.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Tried to do my forming tonight, first time I didn't have enough bolts, second time was better but couldn't get it to draw all the way down. Tomorrow I'll make a press with foam to help push everything into place and try again. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/d/7d7477159ee99add1830c77b78d0e1be528d193c.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/4/143d0610d26acb45b392e4f09f55810420179135.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/5/c509a3c156adeca3db45a7167e4c5d1d250d00df.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/0/705f4074811065ac794c105db9d7c962d8133cc8.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Just to give an idea of what is going to look like once I get it right, it'll hold the esc's and switches, battery meter, and receiver inside and the base will bolt to the boards stock holes. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/5/6573c09f895757f41253a3956cf6ae2bc036413f.jpg" width="690" height="388">

I see a lot of people trying vacuum forming which has its intricacies and nuances, there are other thermoplastics available ie: worbla, this can be formed with a heat gun and does not require a vacuum to form over an object.

The only limitations that it comes in a smaller thickness of sheet rather than your typical thermoplastics, which could have issues with strength but can be doubled up in sheets.

A lot of cosplayers use it for forming armour etc. I have used it for other projects and might use it for my e-mtb build

If I can't get this to suck down I may move to an ABS or similar. I want something with rigidity to hold everything without moving. I think I know what to do next, just means I have to make more stuff. I'm done for the night tomorrow's another day.

Suggestion, probz rubbish but maybe...., if you made a reverse of the recess mould ie a mound mould for the Max6's and switches you could just make snug fitting faceplate to place on top of what you have already made in the above photo.

I hope that makes sense? im shite at explaining things  :blush: but i think working the Kydex from behind so to speak could help gain the full cupage you need.... :wink:

I figured it out needed to be 10Â° hotter in the oven, and I ran 2 shop vacs in series to pull down harder. Once I did that it worked perfectly for the top and bottom, now I just have to run all the wires inside and install my battery meter. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/7/3723818e8cebb8b8f393468eeab22d353bf39c68.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/7/9756e881064bb9e371dc4af640becee7f34c71d2.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/c/bc8b7a04f578fb610e7378565da2e6c73ff9f844.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/7/9756e881064bb9e371dc4af640becee7f34c71d2.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/c/ac9469e0e4f82782f3f5164da6aa8c010c939eac.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/a/fa3200495a488d5a1b10dd4fde504efd2f278802.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Nice work man, Kydex is a awesome stuff.

Let me mention one thing, if you use the Truck Bolts to mount the Rc-Plate you have to complete demount the Truck for doing maintenace on the bushing or adjust the preload on the Springs.

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/trampa-trucks-maintenance-bushing-replacement-on-springtrucks/17918

Again nice work!
Good choice on the ESC ! They do what they should... never bring one to fail !

Edit : maybe just add two holes in your lower plate for reaching the adjuster screws

Cheers

Just took it out for it's first run, at 10:30pm with a flashlight in one hand and my remote in the other...This is scary fast!! And the torque is mind blowing. The first thing I did was come back and turn the throttle punch down from 3 (factory) down to 1 and turn the brakes from 80% to 50%. Thankfully I had the foot straps on, I hit the brakes and had I not been strapped in I would have went over the front of the board. Next test will be tomorrow in the light. I'm super happy with how it turned out.

Finished! Just have to decide how to run the dampas. As of right now I don't have them installed, I have a yellow set but even they seem to stiff. But as I pick up speed I start to get unstable. May try them in just the front first, or maybe all the way around and just drill holes into them to make it easier to carve. If anyone has experimented let me know what works best. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/4/246de4b86de7179c1de7a4c437c05762040803ce.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/c/3c02c8ae1c24ad7b672f1938fd21826035f9abd1.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/6/a6b709fc89c72f912b044d731b9daf4dd2f3e3de.jpg" width="281" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/3/03e725cfe12af32d4f0b149699d97649087527c3.jpg" width="690" height="388">

looks great bro, good job! 

one thing quickly, I would secure the wires between the ESC and motors to something because when the board rotates  when you turn it is going to start working the wires loose from the motors. The joints are not flexable

You might consider making a vent cover for the ESC. Either clear or mesh for cool ventilation to keep out debre. Just a suggestion. I see your good at fabrication.

Not to worried about the fans, I have bashed my RC cars with similar ESC setups and never had an issue,  I don't intend to run this nowhere as hard as my RC cars. 

As far as the motor wires, I've thought about affixing them to the side, not sure how yet but that can be done in the future, besides I'm just south of Chicago it's still to cold to do any riding at least for me.

Nice Red Theme Bro... even with red mesh :sunny:

For Dampas : many people think when they start riding a Trampa that it is very stiff with Dampas. From my expierence its more a problem with being unfamilar with bindings... you really have to get on with using the bindings. You need a little speed and then leaning into it, if you fall you were to slow... heelstraps helps also ... and check the bindings itself... their is a " binding tutorial" on YT from an Mbs Teamrider.... keep on riding.... btw : no need for then vents, run all my Max6 without ... just disconnectet but still indtalled.... this ESC's are beasts... they take all abuse like a BOSS

@Nowind I like the straps but I also like to carve, it is extremely fun at low speeds without the dampas. I have been thinking of a way to have both, I have had steering dampers on bikes in the past. They are adjustable and have close to the same amount of travel at a truck. I'm curious if anyone has ever tried to mount one on a mountain board @trampa I guess would be the best person to ask? If I can get one cheap enough or if any of my friends still have one laying around I may give it a try  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/1/21fd17734a4f197395d3e5e38bebe43b17cd650c.jpg" width="432" height="358"> I was thinking of mounting it behind the front truck. I know this one is big but they come in many sizes and forms.

Edit: I went on eBay and found used ones for $10 and linear Style ones for the $20-30 range. I may just order some and give it a try. Would still like to know if anyone has attempted it in the past.

80Â° today so I got to go on my first real ride, 3 miles with no dampers was just way to scary. So I came home and install my yellow set.....And broke my truck bushings on the rear truck. Going to have to order some and a few extras. Batteries are changing so I'll try it out hopefully again before the sun sets. I have rolled up and down the driveway before I added the motors and I thought they were just to hard, but I also didn't have the straps on. Rolling around with them installed and with the straps isn't so bad, just have to test with some power. Overall I'm extremely happy with how it came out.

And my 3d printer showed up today so now I can revise a few things and make motor wire hangers.
Maybe start a new 3d printed build!!

Now I'm going to have to go back and watch a few more of his videos, I've been busy lately I just got a 3d printer and have been playing with that for the last 2 weeks and my board has been on the back burner. Plus it's been cold and rainy. Now that I can print parts I'm going to get back to the board soon.

It was two different thickness, one, the top section was super thin. The bottom mount piece was extremely thick. I don't remember the exact thickness but if I remember I'll check when I get home from work.
