I am looking at two boards, which one do you like better?: https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/70596/gravity-drop-thru-38-tiger-longboard-skateboard-deck-w-grip and https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/71762/landyachtz-2017-drop-hammer-blue-jay-longboard-skateboard-deck-w-grip

I like the second one personally.

Cause then you got jays by your feet.

Cool, that is the one I was going to buy but I went to a cool shop in Chicagoland, and they sold me Dervish Sama Flex 1, I like it a lot.  

They told me the one I was going to buy was too stiff and was lower quality.

My old roommate had the drop hammer. The rocker feels nice on it. It's a stiff DH board but it'll work well for esk8; I'd recommend it.

At a certain point, the stiffness is not worth is over the comfortability, see I can usually just add risers to solve any clearance problems, and when the board is too stiff, I hurt to ride, especially in Chicago where the sidewalks suck.

Honestly, I just got used to the paths and roads in Chicago. You cramp up for your first few weeks but after that you're fine.

Yeah well, I guess I could try a stiff board next and see how it feels.
