Hi everyone,

So glad that finally i made my first built thread. After a year on this forum with some dilemmatic building option (and i also almost give up because i can not imported battery pack to my country), finally i nearly finished my e-skate. Let me introduce my self a bit, my name is Xantalia, i‚Äôm from Indonesia and i‚Äôm a girl üòä. For this built I choose to go with simple setup so i could learn more how everything works before decided to go with more complicated built. I really enjoying this project and i want to share how far my progress is. Any feedback would be awesome üòãüôè

_Main Setup:_

***JET SPUD 29‚Äù*** from Built Kit Boards; re-paint the bottom of the deck and remove the top paint, i love the natural wood look. I also need to drill new holes for the truck since the existing holes configuration can not fit the hubs that i‚Äôm using.

Clear Grip-tape
I think i‚Äôll go with spray grip tape. 

***CALIBER*** Truck II 50, Bones Swiss Bearings, ***TRAMPA*** Stickies 90mm for Front Wheels.

***DIYEBOARD*** Dual Hub Motor 90mm, ESC, Remote & Charger; Re-paint the hubs to black; Adding some 4mm alumunium heatsink to the ESC.

***10S2P SAMSUNG 30Q*** with ***VRUZEND V2***; I could do a 10S3P in the future if i could get my self a spot welder. Vruzend kit took a bit more spaces on this deck, so i decide to go with 10s2p for now.

***10S BMS 40A*** from Ann Power; i have order a 60A Bestech BMS but they‚Äôre not here yet. I hope this Ann Power BMS are doing just fine. 

***3D PRINTED*** Enclosure using PETG with 4mm wall thickness; it took about 50hrs to get them done (41x20.5x3-4.5cm). Covering the surface with putty spray and paint. 

White Battery LCD Indicator

Here you go:

For batteries I suggest getting an arduino spot welder with some lipos or a car battery. I used this one https://malectrics.eu/product/diy-arduino-battery-spot-welder-prebuilt-kit-v3/ for two 10s4p packs (one [single stack](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-build-db-freeride-dt-38-evolve-trucks-dual-6355s-190kv-custom-10s4p-30q-focbox/37352) and one dual stack for @BigBrit [build](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-build-loaded-icarus-dual-6355-samsung-30q-focbox-nano-x-tb-218mm-and-abec11/42331) and it works really nice, solid welds and no issues at all.

XTLA you nailed it! and it looks amazing! The enclosure is beautiful, did you use PETG or ABS? Did you sand and paint it afterwards? Did you designed it to follow the deck concave?
Keep sharing pics once it will be all done and also how it rides. I would suggest to attach the battery and electronics to the deck to don't stress the enclosure too much. Concerning the spot welder it's quite easy to make it one or buy an arduino based spot welder. You can buy it on the forum or on Ali for even cheaper.
I have been to Indonesia. such a beautiful place. Enjoy!

Edit: I sse the enclosure details in your description. I was too enthusiastic that I read too fast :laughing:

Hi Rey, thank you üòã. Yes the enclosure design follow the deck concave. I think about spot welded 2 but maybe for next upgrade and also change the bms (i can‚Äôt wait any longer to ride üòÑ). I‚Äôm thinking about attaching the battery to the deck 2 but since my pack are wide enough and the deck are concave, i need to figure out how to attach them.

I think with velcro you can do it easily. I use the wide velcro from hobbyking (really strong one) and few small one to completely lock the battery in place (if you do not find the product I can look it up for you). Basically it can't move anymore.
Does your enclosure follow the deck shape well? Do you mind share the STL file or the project file (such as Fusion360 or similar). I am going to print mine again and I want to make it with a concave this time. Having a file with already the measurment would be easier to modify mine.

Yea ask me questions, sure! I was born and raised in Surabaya, currently live in Rotterdam The Netherlands. Family lives in Jakarta too now!

I'm quite impressed with the build you pulled off as well as the quality, especially with thight law on import in Indonesia atm. However, to get a beautiful finish on the board or batteries, there are actually importers who can help you with it without breaking the bank (although DIY eboard really breaks the bank by nature üòÄ).

Nice insta picture! You can find my build eATB under the name THUMPER. Yet you can also find me in FB.

Overal impressed how this can be build in Indonesia with this level of finish. That 3D printer must have been huge!

I wonder it will feel with a 10S2P, as a 10s3p would be the lowest I'd go after riding 12S4P for years.

Hi L, ya indonesian custom kinda tight, especially for batteries and electronic. Last night i just got my bms from bestech and you know what, they open the sintetic plastic in harsh way and leave it like that, throw them in the open box not in proper way not even sealed them back ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (berantakan).

My friend help me with his 3d printer (subsolid x) that has 20x20 platform, thats why i need to split them in to 2 and glue them together with gorillas glue. 

I‚Äôm not new into building something, I‚Äôm an architect, sometimes i do make a mini scale of building for my project if it necessary üòÅ.

Thank you, happy to hear that from the master of enclosure üòäüôè. Yes i know 10s2p maybe will not good enough and perhaps i would get voltage sag etc. i‚Äôll just use this board for fun built, riding flat. The esc from diyeboard a bit huge, since i don‚Äôt have spot welder at the moment, using vruzend kit also take spaces, i can not even use bestech bms. Spot welded the bateries is the only solution if i want to go for 10s3p so i have a bit spare spaces to work with. I could do 10s3p with this vuzend, stack them, but it just to bulky, i want the enclosure as slim as possible. I‚Äôll try with this setup 1st (can‚Äôt wait to ride them soon), upgrade them later, buy spot welder, when i‚Äôm not satisfy üòÅ

Really clean cable managment. The nice thing of this ESC that eerything is compact. You should see mine with double VESCs, antisparks, loop key ( I keep both just in case)...It's a mess! :laughing: New 2 in 1 VESC will make the difference. In your case a quick cheap VESC would be the 2 in 1 from Maytech in case you want to upgrade or wait for the new one from Enertion.

Messy but im sure you are having fun built themüòÇ. Since it was my 1st built i don‚Äôt want to go with complicated setup, i need to learn how the sistem work first and i don‚Äôt want to spent more $ for trial n error üòÑ. I don‚Äôt think i will upgrade this built for now, the only problem i get so far was speed wobble, im not sure what‚Äôs the cause, should i change my caliber bushing or maybe my 6mm riser pad to soft, i dunno. Fyi jason told me that beter to run this hubs sensorless if using their esc. The brakes also a bit scary, going fast also scary with small board üòÖ, i haven‚Äôt hit full throttle at hi speed mode, so i don‚Äôt know what is the max speed i could get. But for casual riding so far i had no problem, fun enough üòã

i am more excited to start with another built (perhaps belt drive) üßê

I can answer to all your question because I also have experience the same, first build also for me.
-Speed wobble = change the bushing to a venom, riptide...in my case I felt the board really heavy to turn so I went to a skate shop and the crazy guy there choose for me the busghing based on my weight ecc... now it's like turning on clouds and more stability too. Then you have to play with the kingping (you will need to change with new bushing probably) to tight it up or loose until you feel stable and still able to turn easily. I also use 3mm shockpads but is to absorb vibrations. the last thing is how you place your foot on the board. The Spud is short so the forn one has to be above the truck bolts to be able to have stable ride. Those things worked out for me.
- Yes their ESC works better sensorless. You gain torque. The sketchy brakes is due to the ESC. That's why VESC is better you can set them to being super smooth. My previous board was with ESC, totally different and is not that exensive how you may think. Anyhow noe that are better ESC, like the one from Ownboard or Wowgo that use boosted board style remote e smooth accellaration and brakes.
- Top speed due to max ERPM for this motor is 40km/h. You are light so you will get there for sure. I feel stable at that speed though the board is short, but wide so really nice.

Enjoy!

It‚Äôll be more complicated due to all the edges. Laser cut wise It just need to just about .85 the size of the Deck to work , just need to find someone in the US with a Laser cutter and who knows how to do this

Unless you want the griptape exactly same shape offset from the board, yea you‚Äôll need laser cut. But if you want the shape that a bit different and more simple maybe can do it manualy (thin griptape like jesup easier to cut than blood orange)
