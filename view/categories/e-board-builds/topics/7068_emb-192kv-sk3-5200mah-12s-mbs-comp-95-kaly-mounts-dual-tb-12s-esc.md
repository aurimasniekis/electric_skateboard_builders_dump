Nice! 

But how you going to use the VESC on 12s with 192kv motor? seems like its over the erpm limit. 
Careful to limit that or you'll kill your VESC. Maybe one of the experts can comment on this...

I won't reach theoretical top speed, but this is an offroad machine so that is not the intent. Also, i'm using 15/65 gearing which I think is on the torquey side.

I also have two 4s batteries  but that increases amps/heat.

Nice !!!

Try to find a box that can fit the VESC and lipos tougher you can run flat discharge  wires under the grip tape.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/1d67b38e3ebb6915b727f44fdb4f1746c1bb6b21.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Are these 7 inch wheels? If so, it should be a theoretical max of 40mph. I'd definitely set the 60k erpm limit on the VESCs to avoid blowing something out.

8 inch actuallY

I will definitely be careful and set an erpm limit. 

According to chakas post, the recommended kv for 12s would be 170kv. However, this is assuming a 7pole motor. I'm not sure if the 3sk is a 7 pole kotor.

63mm SK3's are 7 pole pair yea. You'll hit 67,738 erpm with full charge.

I'll only reach that speed while freewheeling, maybe not even that. Anything else I can do to prevent damaging to the vesc?

I sold the Vescs and went with TB 12s ESCs so I changed the title accordingly. Also, i have enough wire length for a dual diagonal.

Nice looking build! :thumbsup: Do you mind telling me about your gearing and motor mounting, and where you got your components? I'm also trying to build a mountain board and your setup is almost exactly what I envisioned.

I got the mounts from @Kaly and the 192kv sk3 motors from hobby king. Gearing is 15/65. The escs I got from @barajabali. The lipos from a guy who flies large RC jets. The board was from shadeonme.com (call them up to get a better price than amazon). Thanks for your interest.

I have to add, the board feels lighter than I expected. This is thanks to the new matrix 2 trucks and that I'm using lipos. I don't have final weight but it should be very manageable. I like building light boards.

Thanks for the info. Did you get the wheel pulleys from @kaly too? And are those 15mm belts? I'm also planning on keeping things simple and light. I'd be curious to know what your final weight ends up being.
