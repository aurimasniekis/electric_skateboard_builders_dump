Have been riding on them since March, actually works pretty grate. PLA works best atm, but im going to change them out with alu for the heat dissipation and ofc lifetime.

Havent tried it on dirt yet, prob gonna chage it out with the 8inch wheels I have. They work nice on snow aswell.
The battery is scavanged from dell cd-rom extended batteries. Havent stress tested them yet, but they should be able to deliver 84Amp constant based on they'r internal resistance.
