2016 was a pretty epic year in the Esk8 world. There was a dramatic increase in new products available, new vendors, and new builders. This forum has provided a great venue for showcasing our builds. Now that it's 2017, I thought we could vote on a build of the year from 2016. 

So obviously the build must have been completed in 2016, and documented on this forum. The BOTY should showcase unique innovation and creativity. I thought we could vote on the first five (5) builds that receive a full nomination, meaning a nomination with a second and a third. And you can't nominate your yourself. Once we have five (5) full nominations, we'll start a poll. 


So I'll start with a couple nominations for 2016 BOTY:

I nominate the Silver Sunrise build by @Glenn. This build is so awesome and unique:

And this one is obvious, a super clean, well documented build by @RunPlayBack that started the spud craze:

This is some really next level stuff! Fast, comfortable and a lot of power. 
Also, shoutout to @unik his little all-terrain beast and @whitepony his portable but yet powerful Jet spud build

This is gonna be hard. They're all great in their own ways.
I would vote  @Glenn silver sunrise, @whitepony jet spud, and @Kaly street carver but wouldn't be able to decide which is the best.

Maybe have separate categories? e.g. mountain boards, regular longboards, small cruisers, etc.

another nice build I forgot about:

I'm sure there are other cool builds in the builds section that will get some votes if included in the poll

Is @Duffman's build eligible? If so, he's got my vote. I know he didn't post his build here until February, 2017, but he did build and post this on the German esk8 forum in 2016. With his hot swappable battery system, next level VESC modding/abuse and slew of custom designed parts and electronics, and especially if you count his 4wd studded snow tire build, he pretty much ticks all the boxes for what I could possibly want in an eMTB build.

I second this. I think there should at least be 4 or 5 categories, like
1. Best street board
2. Best mountain board
3. Best hybrid (street/all terrain) board
4. Best budget board
5. Most unique/unconventional board
6. Best lighting scheme on a board
7. Best "DIY" production board
```

So many sweet builds! 

It looks like these builds have seconds, need a third for a full nomination:
@Glenn's silver sunrise
@Monk's InMotion
@whitepony's carbon jet spud
@unik's all terrain spud
@Kaly's street carve

If anyone thirds one of these, we will have the first nominee for BOTY.

I decided against categories because this is the best build award. Not best board, but the most innovating, creative, cutting edge, DIY build, on a builders forum. This can be applied to all board types. 

@Michaelinvegas I was thinking a trophy or cookie could be presented at the convention.

A great idea you have Master Jedi.
So many amazing builds went down last year.
This is gonna be really hard. We will have to search our feelings and use the force to locate the chosen one.

with the large number of great builds we should first have a sort of "suggestions round" where people can anonymously enter their favorites into the pool of candidates. Have this open for a couple days and then present the options to vote on in different categories.

 Maybe  we should break it up into categories. 
Best EMTB build
Best Street build
Etc.
```

@Maxid The "suggestions round" is the nominations.. I nominate, you second, he thirds = a candidate for BOTY

Currently there are five builds with seconds, any of those need a third to get a full nomination. The first five (5) nominees get on the ballot. Then we'll set up a poll to vote. 

@Namasaki The category is Best Build, apply to any board you'd like

I don't agree with that. People will not post their own builds if it is not anonymous. And without this we will end up with only the builds that people remembered the most and we will not get to the hidden gems.

Why not just post a link to board that you want to nominate (like we all have allready :slight_smile:) and then use likes to count the votes?  Would be simple that way.

I just realized I haven't actually posted a build thread here in a while. Maybe I should go back and do that soon. and my blog hasn't been updated either. I guess i've been too busy with instagram.

@longhairedboy You just need your own category. If we end up doing categories. Which it sounds like we're not. :cry: Love the Tron build though!

I think that there should be categories. People buy different cars just like people build different boards. Each board has something special about it too because that person built it to their liking so its really hard to chose.

Not sure how this got started but wanted to thank everyone for the votes. I have added a few things since the build but use the board quit offen. One of the things I added was an on and off switch. I put it where no one can find it. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/c/0c96cbfdbb445b448b7acc8934e2e7dcde412346.JPG" width="375" height="500">
