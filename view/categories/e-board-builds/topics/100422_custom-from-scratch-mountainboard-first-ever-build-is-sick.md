My first ever deck Build and Battery build. Checkin in to get feedback some see if I'm on the right track.  Everything including foam mold was shaped by hand and eye without measuring. The Battery is for my Evolve upgrade. The Mountain Board will get a 12s5p. ![20190814_203827_HDR|666x500](upload://yzK58p9mjEjkq9DiLlxu4ElAx5p.jpeg) [Message_1565914379703|374x499](upload://tgnw1O95bNIeHIs38A0mKPGPhMz.jpeg) ![20190816_202518_HDR|375x500](upload://fRY0JRE8psarqbsu7t9yuFRS3OG.jpeg)![Message_1565824598713|374x499](upload://mxGJ9dlDQz3k1cE3bgn1Fi0HYx8.jpeg)![Message_1565914379703|374x499](upload://tgnw1O95bNIeHIs38A0mKPGPhMz.jpeg)

Thank you man!. Curve was done using my daughter's tent pole bent over a screw on centerline. Sharpied the side of R10 foam then rasped and sanded flat. Appreciate the compliment!. Thanks!!
