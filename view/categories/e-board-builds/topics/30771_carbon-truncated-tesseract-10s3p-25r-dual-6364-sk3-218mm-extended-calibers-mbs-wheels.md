Why are you going for the truncated Tesseract? You don't like tails? ( Got the cantellated tesseract)

I love the tesseract, but i don't care for tails. Was going to go with a jet spud (26") but I the truncated tesseract is still pretty short, with a ton of grip, really locks you in.

I am building my board right now and tried the board out the last couple of days without anything on. DAMN, it's a really nice board and you can lock your foots in hard :D
