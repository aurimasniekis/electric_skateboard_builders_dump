Just finished my cheapo dual diagonal today out of extra parts I frustratingly mistakenly purchased over multiple builds. It's not super fast because it's only got 140kv 5065 motors but it's super torquey and climbs like an Ibex. I'm curious to find out how efficient it will be with a lightly used Space Cell 3. The space cell was actually my inspiration due to it's extra space in the front of the enclosure (it's filled by foam) for a vesc. It turned out quite nicely I think. The only things left to do are ride it for a while to figure out the bushing situation and also I'll eventually replace the 97mm clones with something better and I'm considering buildkit boards clones as @jlabs claims they're great and better than other clones so I'm interested. ![img20180303_170540|305x500](upload://jYszPXCi4LKzgp1eft3RCCA5T3u.jpg)

Been riding my Red Rogue for a while, but I'm gathering parts for my second board, the Cobalt Carver. It's decent, but it could use some upgrades.

@onepunchboard Love the small package man , specs? How does it ride?

@GrecoMan Nice, nailed the honeycomb. Sad I abandoned it due to Vinyl Wrap not being the best upkeeper. Hows Dual Diag ? Any differences in feel?

@ATLesk8 Danm man nice! What size are those trucks!?

@pennyboard Love the simplicity ! 

@Lumaci Dude, please stop. I can only get so erect ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)> But really, well fucking done. I don't think I've ever seen a cleaner board. For those bullet holes on the cable riser not being filled, are you planning on getting a Dummy Plug of some sorts? I've been looking but no luck.

@Apolo Really Diggin that logo man , Enclosure looking clean as fuck.

@jess.t.moody Danm, love that grip tape design , It almost makes me want to do that to the Anubis. Need to find something that corresponds to the theme.Fresh board man really.        

@Riako Love the deck shape and see throughness! Hows abs holding up? Danm That last board almost makes me want to start working on the liberator.

@bartroosen12 Fucking clean man! Are those swappable Cells?

@TranxFu Looking slick man, What Lights are those and how are they mounted?

@pat.speed Slickest black board I have ever seen. is that vent in the enclosue for the esc?

@SeanHacker What happened?

@Jammeslu Nice, do you use the kicktail often?

the wheels make part of the TURNIGY ELECTRIC SKATEBOARD CONVERSION KIT.
not the best material. they are too soft. glass, rocks everything can make hole in the wheels. but for a build ina budget they are the best deal

@taz @pat.speed no issues now, Jacques fixed a firmware hiccup for me a few months ago. 50$ to correct my sti link ignorance, fine. My bad, don’t tinker with metr to change settings while on the road. 
 
They are near the two single most expensive components I own at near 300$ each. A pair of dual focboxs that has been to hell and back is half the price and has a smaller foot print (And tolerated some of the dumbest battery current limits you have ever hear of).

My 2 unity’s can basically send me to the moon on 4wd for the foot print of a children’s wallet at the same cost. Oh, integrated Bluetooth and start switch included. 

“But they are so versatile, you aren’t using them to their potential”. I know. I should sell them instead of complain. Garage queens for now 💅.
