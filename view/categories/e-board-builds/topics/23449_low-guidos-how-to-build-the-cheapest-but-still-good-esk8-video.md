I have had a lot of people ask me to make a video on a full build or to show some of my processes.
so I put this together documenting a whole build from start to finish using the cheapest parts possible, and using basic tools that most people should have at home or be able to borrow from someone.

Please enjoy.

Great video. I used one of these kind of videos when i built my first board. We built 3 almost identical builds with my friends. Half a year after that i found this forum and now i'm addicted üòÇ

Yeah I thought about it.. but the video was already dragging on... I have shown how I charge in many of my other threads..
I just use the balance leads to charge with a imax B6 charger.

Was really looking forward to the way you mount your motor plate with tools "most people should have at home or be able to borrow from someone" but then b√§m you weld aluminium :cry:

Nice video though - love how clean everything looks. So much better than my first Tupperware box :D

LOL I was waiting for someone to bring up the aluminium welding.
seriously I cant afford TIG or anything fancy. thats just a really basic hobby MIG welder. 
and I learned myself by building skateboards. I'm not the best at it, but it does the job.

How about that upright drill. Not very common as basic hometool.

And i don't think welding is problem for most people. Piece of aluminium was like 3e and local boat repairshop welded it with pack of beer.

ohh come on.. what about this: 
http://thiswoodwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/060722610.jpg

seriously but, that is like a $99 drill press. cheaper than my cordless.

plus if you have a steady hand you can use a cordless.. LOL ;)

@lowGuido  Interesting that you keep the original motor adapter plate which comes in the box, usually it is not that good to use it, as it decreases the distance between wheel and motor (pulley) location.

Have gone till 7mins so still a lot to watch, anyways very nice video.. and what kind of wheels are those? I think I havent seen such wheels before.

Ok now finished watching.. very nice build indeed.. even if it used 'simple methods' as you described :D

What kind of plastic box is that? Doesnt look like typical kitchen tupperware / food box.

Cordles drill and steady hand is winner üí™üèº Upright drill would be nice but i need it like once a year so no real need for that.

I used a hand held rechargable dewalt for my first 15 builds. I JUST NOW got a drill press. 

hand drilling straight holes can happen!

I like it because It means that I can drill a hole large enough to put the motor pulley through the bracket so I dont need to take the pulley off the motor every time I take it off the bracket. I always do this for convienience, and as far as I am aware I am the only one who does it this way. I think its easier.

[/quote]

yeh, I saw this and was :O 'shit, this is amazing' :D

I managed to cut a sideways 'slot' in my current motor plate to be able to pull the motor out but it compromised the stenght of motor plate too much. Motor plate was a bit shady in the first place but after I made the slot it got even worse..

Still got to remove the pulley from axle, it is stuck so good i dont need any grub screws and with normal pulling or hitting with hammer it doesnt work, need to make a custom pulley remover now.

So seeing your 'solution' was interesting. Still got to figure out how the adapter plate helps you with hole think but I think I will figure it out.

those wheels are Dregs wheels, which Im not sure are around any more? but there are plenty of clones on alibaba for cheap cheap. and I have used them as well.

if you pause the video I show you ;) its a "drawer organiser" a couple of dollars from a home store.

hah sorry for skipping the box part :D might have looked away when you started fiddling with box.

Nice box non the less and wheels also look pretty good, I like the clear urethane part they have.

Lets hope enough new esk8 builders can now benefit and make their boards by watching your vid :)

heres a sample of whats out there on alibaba..

and I have also just drilled solid wheels before using a similar technique, but with a washer on the outside of the wheel..
that can save money if you already have wheels on your board that you want to use, but I like those wheels because the pulleys seem to fit really nicely without much modification.

Yes, this is what I was referencing to! These sort of wheels u use and have picture of, also fit quite well with what you need to mount a pulley..

The 5 holes really amazed me, since only Orangatangs have a holes where you can easly fit screw through.. so in my opinion, these are really nice as 5 screws are just enough and the wheel has already holes ./ markings for that :)

thanks @whitepony. It was actually quite a pain in the ass.  Like the build itself would have taken me a few hours, it wasnt hard.
but setting up the camera and filming every little thing was actually the painful part.. I actually dont have a camera.
I used my phone. and at the start I didnt even have a tripod. I had to go buy one halfway through the build because I was sick of pushing tool boxes and stuff around to balance the phone on.
I got to the end of the build and was like "Sweet all I gotta do is slap this stuff on the board and im done" but then I realized that I had to set up the camera and get everything filmed. what waa like 2 mins of work turned into an hour of angles and lighting.... OMG LIGHTING! dont get me started! lighting in my workshop is poor at best. i was shining torches on stuff and... gosh
there was no second take either, once that hole is drilled its drilled. so some of the shots were not as clear as I would have liked but there was nothing I could do.
also things like sawing and filing without putting my arm infront of the camera and blocking the shot meant that sometimes I was doing things at super awkward angles.. it wasnt my best work LOL.

I really hope that people enjoy the video and maybe even learn something from it... or even just watch that heat shrink at 9:35 over and over... so satisfying.

despite being a pain I still had a heap of fun making it.

I would recommend putting loctite onto the bolts instead of dripping it into the motor mounting  holes.

LOL yeah thats what I do. but unfortunately I fucked up the shot and had to retake. you notice I dont actually put any loctite in the holes, but mearly indicate that its used there.

not that it actually matters how you loctite just so long as you do.

Did not notice that. Good work! I was wondering how would you recommend calculating center distances for an adjustable mount? Mount has to be tightly clamped and the motor has to be attached.. Kind of tricky.
```

## \#30 Posted by: lowGuido Posted at: 2017-05-21T20:43:27.348Z Reads: 138

@wmj259  i screwed the pulleys into a block of wood with the belt tensioned and measured the centre distance. that way there never has to be any adjustment.
or you could just use a centre distance calculator online..
```

## \#31 Posted by: wmj259 Posted at: 2017-05-21T21:22:00.999Z Reads: 137

But that does need a fixed center distance with the pulley teeth/diameter for it to be calculated?

Belt calculators use pulley ratios and a center distance to calculate a  belt length. So I wound need the two things to find a right belt.

Yeah filming is a pain...even if you have all the equipment...then you need to edit it....kudos to the hard core youtubers out there...it's almost a full time job

I actually kinda liked that there were no words...kinda shows how simple it can actually be...

@Michaelinvegas anyone who knows me will tell you that I talk. A lot.
I dont like videos that ramble on and dont get to the
Point. So I prefered to just so it. You can see what I'm doing and see the part names. If you wanna know more you can google the part or replay the sequence. 
Or you could just ask me. 

Hey I got a dislike! Someone couldnt build their own board.

because thousands of people have been asking me for a parts list, here it is!
keep in mind I am not affiliated with any of the online stores that I got the parts from so I'm not naming names.. But I think It should be pretty obvious.
