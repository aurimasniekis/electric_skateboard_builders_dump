I am looking to put a 12mm ID bearing on a traditional 8mm OD truck axle. I am looking for a sleeve or adapter to close the gap. Any ideas or know where to locate such a creature??

@trampa?

Not in stock, since the 8mm axles are not wide enough anyway. We will come up with something soon.

The Torque Boards 218mm axles are wide enough.

So at this stage, you need to lathe some yourself. As soon as we have some in stock i will post it here.

currently we don't. The axle of a Caliber II is to short anyway. If you have access to a lathe, you could make something like this:

Someone also reversed the spokes ( bearing seats to the inside) and dropped in a tube with the correct seats for skate bearings on Calibers.

I have torqueboards 218mm trucks and am thinking of going with your new 6,5inch penumatics and gummies. Is there a way to mount them on a 8mm axle now?

Won't a 638 bearing (8x28x9mm) work?

If your axle is wide enough, yes.

You need 36mm of axle to fit them with those bearings.

Great - torqueboards Site says: 
Axle - 47mm Length, 8mm Diameter Axle
10mm thread length, 37mm usable axle length

Thiat is a 10 mm axle converter for 8 mm axle, no? ... screwed in a similar fashion like the ones use on Surf Rodz hangers?

No his thread over the existing axle

SurfRodz are removable and entirely replaceable axles

If is possible. Don't want to buy a Torqueboard if I don't have to... but Frank already said minimum 36 mm of axle are required (not counting 10 mil from the tread). I think I just got 32 mm total from my Evolve axles including the tread. So I'm short by 14 mil at least. No luck.

Cut off some of the hanger just enough to reach the desired amount if you don't want to spend money.

Yep, you just need to figure out the axle size and match that to the bearings. Most sizes can be had in Amazon or eBay.

Hi Guys!

I'm vaiting for my 6,5in superstars to arive. I have 638 2rs bearings  to fit them on to the TB 218mm trucks, but the question i have is what kind of bearing spacers shoudl i use? Trampa uses 12x16x18.2 for 12mm axles right? So regular skateboard spacers will be to short... and there is no 18.2 8mm spacers that i can find. Any ideas?
