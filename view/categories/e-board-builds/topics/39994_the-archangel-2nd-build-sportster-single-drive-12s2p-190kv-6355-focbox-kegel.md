I'm calling this board Damien. 

I don't need much torque. I have about one hill at about a 12% grade in my whole city. 

Battery: Torqueboards 12s2p 30Q
Enclosure: @Eboosted 20"  
Motor: Torqueboards 6355 190kv 
Pulleys: Torqueboards kegel pulley combo 12mm belt (14T motor pulley)
Mount: Torqueboards V4
ESC: Enertion FOCBOX
Controller: Enertion Nano X

Deck: Bustin sportster 
Trucks: Calliber II 50
Wheel: Orangatang Kegel 80a
Bearings: Neal hurricanes

In the event my wallet suddenly replenishes, I do plan to upgrade to dual. That's the main reason why I went for a 6355 instead of a 6374. 
And TB 218's don't come in watermelon colors

Caliber II 55 and Icarus deck.... that's a super fun combo (used to run a Paris and Icarus deck pushboard). You're gonna want to top mount the trucks.


I'd get @marcmt88 mounts for the same price, the mount uses idler pulleys, so there won't be a lot of coasting drag at all. I'd consider building a battery that is shorter to allow the deck to flex. If you build a battery, take the saved costs and invest in a larger motor and get a 15t motor pulley.

Been thinking about it, might just save the icarus for a push board (I have a set of paris V2's and Otang 4presidents).

Instead, I might buy a set of birch veneer from [Roarockit](http://www.roarockit.com/skateboard-building/veneer/longboard-birch/longboard-birch-veneer-7-layer/#.WiRFALQ-c0o) and press my own board. Really want to go for a shape similar to the Bustin boards [sportster](http://www.bustinboards.com/sportster-longboard-details)

That way, i'll have a stiffer deck and I get to keep the lovely Icarus hole-free

Good idea, but I already ordered the TB combo with the cyber monday discount

You should consider one of these decks if that's the case.

I would actually go with skateshred over Custom Skateboard as they take longer to ship. Skate shred ships pretty quick I put in a big order for components and they got it out same day.

Ahh, I ordered a Bustin Sportster, still had BF deal and it was 2 day shipping. Roarockit had like $30 shipping for two weeks. Plus I don't have nearly enough clamps :grin:

Wheelbase is 26, will be a very tight squeeze with a belt drive system

Had spare CF vinyl laying around. Only had enough for what's in the picture. The rest will be painted matt black (yes I know I should've painted first but too late now). 

Honestly, I just wanted a black ass deck because that shit looks cool with pink calibers.

legit I would have so much done right now if I wasn't waiting for my already 2 month late focbox and nano x

looks nice.  ive had at least four of sportster and really like it.  

they've made different versions with the fiberglass flexy, wood stiff, and carbon stiff.   I have a used carbon version and can throw on some new 195 paris v2 and abec11 centrax 83 if anyone's interested.

My friend drew an archangel up for me so I vectored it and made it vinyl cut-able. Now I have an angel watching over me :slight_smile:

This was the original pencil drawing scanned with an app called CamScanner
![37|388x500](upload://iCfIHB63tk8Gyhwsg2P6XcU48xu.jpeg)

There's no way a vinyl sticker can be that detailed so unfortunately, I had to tone it down. I clicked a few buttons in illustrator which got me a set of vector paths that are isolated as their own object (IMPORTANT)
![15 AM|690x459](upload://eDxyRJrI1umfpazdfpiLtc9HYXJ.png)

I had another friend cut the sticker at his school and ship it over to me (all the way from Singapore). It's a bit lobsided but who cares

Focbox finally arrived, got it programmed with the new vesc tool & replaced the 3.5's with 5.5, xt60 with xt90 to work with my battery. 
@Eboosted enclosure also arrived, the thing feels bulletproof as hell. So I slapped the angel sticker on it.

The concave and rocker on this deck is so extreme there's quite a big gap where from the deck to the enclosure. 
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JSWJTNY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
So I bought this. 1/4" should do it.

It's finally done. I took it out for quite a long ride and nothing came loose or anything. Quite surprised actually.

I always thought that I would eventually add a second motor but after riding it, one is more than enough considering my area. It smashed the steepest hills in my area and I have yet to reach full throttle

Isn't Midland pretty flat though? I'm originally from Grand Rapids and there were not a ton of big hills. (I would still go dual though) :slight_smile:

Nice board, the split finish on the bottom is beautiful 

I would recommend fixing the motor wire better, if you let it loose on the motor exit it will wear the insulation and short in the future

Nice build, the pink trucks hurt me but...yeah ðŸ˜€.  

Get a piece of velcro and a short (3/8in) wood screw, screw through the velcro into the board and put a drop of hot glue or rubber over the screw head, then wrap it around the phase wires. That will keep it in place.

I edited my post for misspellings, the auto correct in my phone is psychotic ðŸ˜€.  

You just screw a strip of velcro to the board under the phase wires then wrap it around them, will hold forever.

But actually, I was thinking of getting another pair of black calibers just to black everything out and have the wheels stick out. But the pink adds to the character.

Yes, Midland is very flat which is why I'm happy with single. There is absolutely no reason why I would need dual lol, would rather spend that money to upgrade to a cantellated tesseract.
