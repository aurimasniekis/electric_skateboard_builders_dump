I making the motor mount but I canâ€™t make the clamp
My idea is make a motor mount for caliber and matrix 2 trucks maybe for trampa
The trampa and caliber clamp is easy but matrix 2 pro is a problem

Good to see you getting this finished up. I keep track of the few people on here who use MBS products and am always interested because I'm using the colt 90 constellation in my first build. Good luck, looks good! Keep an eye out for the metal version of the plastic top piece of the matrix 2s

lipos and a bms. Wish i saw this more often. I've been tempted to release a build version with no batteries that lets you bring your own lipos, but then i'd be in direct competition with another company who allegedly builds the world's fastest boards with no battery included for more than mine cost.

Some paper mache over the top might help to add some extra structure, maybe add some elmers to the trucks as well before you slide on your mount.

Yeah, that sounds sturdy. I think I might pick up some matrix II's when they are back in stock so I'll be keeping an eye on your mount design. Have a lacroix deck sitting neglected hoping to find the time over the holidays to give it some love.

Use pan or button head type bolts. I'd use rubber washers around then to minimize board damage and vibration. If you can find a sheet of rubber or even a silicone baking sheet to put between the box and your board, it will help it not to slip or scratch your deck. Use nylon insert nuts or blue loctite on the bolts until your ready to do a final assembly. Good luck!

A small amount of puff is ok and not dangerous, but one or more cells in the pack is going to have reduced capacity and discharge un evenly. Would still work fine in low draw usage but in skateboard it wonâ€™t last too long.
