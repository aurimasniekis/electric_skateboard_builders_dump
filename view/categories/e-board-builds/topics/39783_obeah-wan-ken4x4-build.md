Have you considered a geometry like this for 10S5P, it would be same height but less width and length, multiple series connections are easy too
130-135mm W 260mm L 40mm H

Yes, but the configuration I used allows a much lower profile to the sides of the enclosure and at it's highest point in the middle is only 1 1/4".

Not opposed to that though on a shorter build. This build I had 23" to work with.

I like that you put the tallest part of your battery in the center  since the sides can get much closer to the ground at full tilt in turns, especially on wide decks.

Yup, when you lean the height of the edge is what matters most
