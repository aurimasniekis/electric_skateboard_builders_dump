Don't like the range (or the company itself) of Evolve Boards, so I decided to make my own board.

I'm rocking

* Landyachtz Evo Falcon 

* Dual 6374 Torqueboard motors

* 2x SK8-ESC

* 107mm Evolve F1 Abec 11 wheels with the logo wiped off

* 14t motor pulley teeth

* 33t wheel pulley teeth

* 218mm Torqueboards trucks

* Red Torqueboards motor mounts

* 12s4p Torqueboards battery

I'm loving the performance. Top speed is around 37mph and the range should be around 20-25 miles, I haven't ridden it dry yet so I'm not sure. Totally worth the money!

This deck is extremely stable, so I'd imagine the 39" deck would be just as (if not slightly more) stable

I love it. It starts pretty slow (might be VESC settings, first build so I'm not sure) but it cranks up super fast. Goes up hills like crazy. This is a good set up for me, I don't need any more torque

I have a similar set up on the 39" evo TB 30q 12s4p and Tb dual 6374 with 107mm wheels but I used 16/36t gearing and I'm getting 42mph top speed and 18-30miles charge depending on how I ride.

I have like no clearance, maybe only 1 inch or something. I can't go over speed bumps, I'll probably add another set of riser pads

I have a really stupid question about the Landyachtz Evo deck. Does the "up flared" end of the board have to be the front end or could this board be ridden and the motors fitted in either direction???
```

---
## \#45 Posted by: Randyc1 Posted at: 2018-07-08T18:39:27.801Z Reads: 240

Up flare gives trucks More Angle for more turning , back end is down flared for less Angle for less turning and more stability

## \#46 Posted by: taz Posted at: 2018-07-08T18:59:38.392Z Reads: 240

Unless you use angled risers, it would be a very bad handling deck.
Even if you did though do not forget that the Evo is wider on the front compared to the rear.
So to answer the question, yes you could make it work but why?

Yeah you definitely would want a different deck if you want the motors facing outwards. I tried to do that at first but the motors were too close to the ground. I ended up preferring inward facing motors.

Hey, I’m new to this and I’m planning my first build. Yours inspired me to go DIY instead of buying a carbon GT. Really cool build you put together. I’m literally copying you almost tit for tat, since I have no clue what I’m doing. Anything you would have done different? Have you tested the range yet?

Sorry bro, I've been taking exams so I haven't had much free time to respond until now.

If I could do it again, I would definitely use loctite all the screws and test every screw before they got too loose. I had problems with my torqueboards motor mount going loose because I didn't loctite it and because the vibrations on the 107 abecs made the screws loose. I would consider getting different motor mounts, but man those red ones are sexy. I would say it isn't worth it though because one of the mounts still came loose even with loctite, it was only until I used AT wheels that it stopped getting loose. I would also go straight to AT because now I don't use my 107 abecs. They make the board too low to the ground, they vibrate too much on shitty roads, and I don't feel confident going higher than about 28mph because I'm afraid that a random branch or crack would cause my to lose balance. I generally prefer AT wheels because they fix all of these issues, but abecs are for sure more fun to ride on when the roads are nice and smooth.

Range with 107 abecs: ~22 miles of aggressive riding.
Range with chinese sixshooters: ~13 miles of aggressive riding.

Oh no worries man. I wondered about the motor mounts given the tapered shape of trucks, and high rpm motors, plus vibrations of a standard skateboard. I think they make a fixed dual motor mount kit. Basically an aluminum bar between the two mounts that holds them tightly together. It’s $40 more than buying the regular mounts, but may be worth it from what you said. I already have a set of abecs I am picking up Monday, but most of the roads I will use it on are smooth. How much were your knock off six shooters? I just couldn’t stomach another $200 for the six shooters ($300 wheels). I’ll pick up some blue loctite as well. Planned on this for all the motor components, but wondered if it was overkill. Guess not. Would you have gone with the regular evo board for a few extra inches length? Or did the 12s4p battery compartment fit fine? I think the 3mm risers won’t be enough. Want plenty of clearance for speed bumps and seeuch. Thanks for the response!

Sorry, I got the knock off sixshooters from a friend, I'm not sure where he got them but I can ask, it should be around $140 or something. I would not have gotten the regular evo board, I think the falcon is perfect for me. It fits the enclosure. And yeah you'll want some thick risers man lol, there's someone on this forum who 3D prints those if you're in to that.
