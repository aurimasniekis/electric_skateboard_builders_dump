I've decided enough is enough with lugging around my 23+ lb board for short quick trips. It's a pain in the ass to carry and obnoxious to go shopping with. It's an amazing board don't get my wrong it's just F***ing heavy. So I busted out an excel spreadsheet and started planning my build. The name of the game here is lightweight af and under the cost of a boosted mini x while beating it in every aspect :smile:. Just want a board I can grab real quick and is somewhat more portable for simple quick trips but still decent for cruising.

*Update*

Ok, so over the course of me gathering parts, this builds concept has changed and I edited the title to reflect that. This thing will be a little ass kicker and still wayyyy lighter than my current 26lb board. I have included my spreadsheet that I've been filling in as I ordered parts. Price for all parts is slightly over $1000.

This is nuts for me. 

I have a Tayto on order and my spreadsheet says:

10s3p 30Q
BBenclosure
Dual Racerstar 5065 200kv
Short Surfrodz tkp grindz with my own machined mount
Focbox unity (on order)
Mini RC remote
15t/36t on Orange Caguama's 

It's almost the same board.

I'm going to build a replaceable battery pack on a mount so that I can keep a spare on my back in case the 9ish miles isn't enough. But in general it's a last mile mini cruiser.

Still debating on the motors, might add a little weight and go 6355's

It is possible for 15mm belts with @JLabs mounts.
But if running 40T, 9mm belts should be enough

Would 40T even fit on an 85mm Otang or is that pushing it? I know on my evolve 38T gears they were close. The main reason for 40T is to squeeze torque out of those little motors and calm down that top speed from my 12S. Any recomendations for a non-bolt on one? Jlabs gear would be perfect but it seems to need the nut flipped around on the caliber truck which I'd rather not do.

I ordered his 40T on 85cags. By my calculations, it will fit. You can also just chop the hanger a little or get 1 e-caliber truck

How do you ride to get 9mi from a 10s3p by my calcs and 15wh/km (very high) you should be getting about 13 and with a cruising style of riding somewhere around 18mi

I figure 20 miles of battery at full burn split over two packs is enough for me.

I'm currently using a similar build, although my board is long for stability. I have:
* 85mm Caguama wheels
* 14:36 pulley
* Caliber 2 trucks with 12mm belts (because 6355 motors)
* 12s2p battery out of LG HB6 (continuous 60A)

What I'll warn you about such a setup is:
* Only 2p will limit your breaking power, I ended up raising limits to 10A charging per cell, and try not to break at high speeds so that I don't blow myself up. I'm probably really decreasing my battery lifespan.
* Torque is insane on my setup (brought motor limits down to 40A per motor), I wish I had a higher top speed instead (although with such small wheels I probably shouldn't go any faster, hoping to upgrade wheels to bigger ones in the future), so what I'm saying is that you shouldn't sweat about torque with wheels this small :smiley:
* And yes, for 15mm belts you'll need e-caliber trucks or something else that's wider. 


If I were building a small board for going to the store, I'd go for 10s3p or something instead. Possibly mount the motors diagonally so that you don't need to get the wider trucks. (Or just 1 motor, idk how far your nearest store is or what roads you'll be taking.) Just food for thought :slight_smile:

Oh, and 1 more thing – you plan on using smaller motors than mine, but if you were to suddenly pick 63mm motors – do not forward mount :smiley: Probably biggest mistake I made when ordering parts for my boart. Now I'm forced to use riser pads and deal with rocks smashing against my motors constantly and pebbles getting stuck inside.

From what I can tell with a 15-36 setup I'd be able to hit almost 31Mph on this. I'm not sure on the braking power of these motors or what they'd be able to do on 12S2P. If I ran 14-15T 40T that should solve the braking issue no?

```
Someone else can correct me if I'm wrong, but when breaking at a certain deceleration, it doesn't matter what pulley setup / motor KV you have – you're going to have to store a certain amount of energy per unit of time, aka need to store Watts somehow, and the amps you put into your battery will be these watts divided by your battery voltage. So with a 12s battery, you need to store the same amps as I do when both decelerating at the same rate, so if I'm running into minor issues, you would to.

What I just wrote down made me realize I have no reason to be more careful when breaking at high speeds than I do at low speeds. What matters is how hard I break. I'm surprised I haven't blown up my battery already, lol.

I cannot find the datasheet for the Samsung 40T, but that might have a higher rated charge rate in amps. I'm waiting to get my hands on them, because I can't fit more than a 12s2p in my enclosure, and I want to double my capacity without sacrificing performance. (Picking LG HB6 cells wasn't the smartest choice in the world :confused:)

I'm only looking to use this board to go about 10 miles max. So if I can get that I'd be happy. Now the brakes thing kinda scares me but I rode a buddy of mines board which is a single 6374 on 12s2p with 12mm belts. His braking was pretty bad but not horrible.

10 miles = ~16km. I don't know how much hills you have where you live, but with my 3Ah battery I only get about 4.5km (a lot of hills though, so probably more around 5km/6km on flat). With that in mind, a typical 12s2p battery will be 6Ah, getting you 12km (7.5 miles). I think 12s3p would be a safe bet if you really need 10mile range. ([calc.3dservisas.eu agrees](https://calc.3dservisas.eu/?Tc8_D8IgEAXw78LscLS0_lnRdDIhaWJ3y4CJFZKOxu8u70GN2-8ud4_jre42qJN6PuJL7dRqx1zohnSZLWUhEWFxRqW7Ysw0pc8cnZnGupj-9pJD11BcghjVdiSaPfkLmoOtSXO4ZB2EvGHdwIutSQvP3rPnImxIqJcyGref-WlFGN7yw3X7jB8mHIhZj8eOoj5f))

I'm looking to have it 15 or less. I feel like that should be possible. My friends evo with a 12s2p TB battery and single 6374 with 100mm mbs wheels was super light and felt only a bit over 15.

I mean I weigh about 125lbs and there isn't manyh hills around me but one huge ass one I encounter on my way home from work everyday. It's at least 20% and stretches for about 1/4 mile. On my way to work it is the funnest part of my trip.

Also I'm planning on using 5045's so that should be a little more conservative on the battery than 63mm motors I'd think. As I said though, long as it's lightweight and can get me just those few miles I'd be set. I'd rather not do 3P as that's more weight lol.

Some things to consider:
Mono drive is way lighter than duel. If you don’t need ass ripping torque a single 6374 is more than enough. 
10s2p is a good battery option. 30q’s might be a bit saggy in that config. Consider something with a higher discharge. Like lg hg6’s or Sony vtc5’s. 
It’s funny, I always grab the mini build now. So much moar convenient. Look forward to seeing the end product.

Dual 5045's would weigh 1.5 pounds total. A single 6374 weighs almost 2 pounds. It sounds silly but i'm seriously trying to save weight on this. I just did a quick rough estimation and rounded up on everything and it appears that it'll be about 14 pounds total. That's rounding up so maybe lighter who knows.

I was thinking about LG hg6's but I'm having the pack built for me and I don't think that may be an option. As I mentioned I rode a friend of mines board for a a couple days as mine was being worked on. It was a single 6374 and 12s2p it got me around and I never noticed much sag. I was honestly surprised by how much range it had, I did a group ride with him and he gets about 12+ miles at a cruise speed.

The only thing that sucks about it is the charge speed. The tb standard 12s2p charger takes forever and I hope that's not the case with my build.

Cool. Am excited to see end result. 
I have a 10s2p hg6 battery. Love it. No sag all the way down to 34 volts. I’m excited for them to get a bit cheaper. Wanna build a 13s4p with them on next build. I have a haya deck coming.

I'm doing a similar build too, closely optimizing for board weight. A couple things to consider:

Consider single 6355 instead of single 6374 as well. On my 6374, I never sustain >50A for more than a minute, which a 6355 can probably handle fine.

Single drive will want wider wheels than dual drive for traction (I break traction braking), look at Ahmyo Akasha (basically 76mm Kegels, 56mm wide) at roughtly 220 g per wheel. Dual drive can probably run Zombie Hawgs (76mm, 38mm wide), at 195 g per wheel

Consider truck width and transmission weight. Dual drive requires 10" calibers (racerstar 5045s are 55m long I believe), whereas single can get away with 9" calibers, or even smaller trucks (assuming you can figure out a motor mount solution)
```

I've tried single drives. I have nothing against them its just a bit weird on braking and the slight pull to the side they have. I'm set on those dual 5045's they should be just about the same weight as a single 6355. I think if I gear them low with 15-40 it should have decent torque considering I'm pretty light. I 'm sticking with the otang 85's to save money since I already have them and they ride pretty smooth. As for trucks yeah I have to order E-calibers to run dual 15mm belts but that's alright.

Took the tayto out and pushed around my apartments parking lot. The concave is nice even with no grip tape on I felt like my feet were locked in. Loving the popocas as this was my first set of them and man they're pretty soft.

After almost a month, Update:

I've just been waiting for the last few parts i ordered. I just got the Boardnamic's 63mm motor mounts, so I assembled them onto the e-calibers. The mounts seem rock solid, no issues. Just need the battery and enclosure now and I should be gucci.
