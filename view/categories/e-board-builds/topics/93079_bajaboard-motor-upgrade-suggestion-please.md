Hi everyone,

I am a little new on this site… I have a GX4 2018.08 Bajaboard. I got it 2nd hand with 17miles on it. Unfortunately about 2 weeks ago I decided to tinker with it and take a look under the “hood” so to speak. I had just finished cleaning out the battery compartment and was putting the 900Wh 30Q battery pack back when it happened… I did not pay to much attention to this little white & frayed wire coming out from the pack… I should have known better (I am an Aerospace Engineer so I am a perfectionist with OCD). so as I was putting the batter back into the bay, the little white wire touched the “contactor”. (yes sparks flew)

so now I am not 100% sure to to check if the battery pack & BMS is in proper working condition, since I don have the schematics... I am not sure where this little white wire is to be attached to, but it seems like it is a loop that was not suppose to be out side the battery pack, since when I loop it to itself it does power on the MB....But I do I know if the mother board is working properly since it seems to keep vibrating the controller when I turn it on and power up the board.

I do have an Electrical engineer buddy that is now tinkering with my board to see if he can at least save the battery pack... 

So at this point I am giving up and looking to upgrade the mother board to the 2019 MB w/ Tank mode. buying the 1.1KWh battery pack, I am also looking to get the 110A controllers, the 16T pulley. I am not sure if I want to go with their motors just yet. does anyone here have any suggestions on motor upgrades? I want to stay with 6374, but I am not sure which motor would be an upgrade to what Baja is offering since they have not revealed the specs to their motor. I have asked, but they are staying silent…

my playground is sunny silicon valley CA where the weather is always nice. and I am looking for a little more torque & top speed. I use my board to commute to work and everywhere in Santa Clara county.

YES I am used to speeds in the high 30mps to low 40mph. I first started speeding with a VISA Dirtsurfer about 15years ago when only gas was available.  (very little torque though)

All suggestions on upgrading the motors would be welcomed.

Thanks

```
the battery should not be damaged worst case senero the BMS is damaged + the ESC

Thanks AlanZhou for the positive news.  Maybe Baja will help me out in the near future once I spend some money with them..
