Hey guys!

First of all there are good news about VESC project - http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-project-com-is-online-public-vesc-tool-download/32268. I think everybody is gonna test new firmware now :slight_smile:
I am personally 100% happy with 2.18 and don't want to fuck anything up now at the night, when I am still super excited about 30km crazy ride on my Fliess 3. Emotions may change over the night, so I have to drop some messages/photos here until inspiration is gone.

The main message is simple - **abandon your belt driven builds and just try direct drive!** Believe me, you will never look back. I will not start reasoning here why, because it "all depends...", it's "all subjective...", etc. I personally got much smoother ride, more reliable (read simple) system, amazing brakes! (up to dragging) and I didn't lose in performance. And Fliess doesn't compromise the performance if you remember from https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/fliess-65kmh/22413. It's all about having fun and fun gets limited if performance is limited :slight_smile:

In my previous topic I promised to try direct drive, so here we go. I am still under "riding drugs" and may write some very subjective bullshit, so just ignore. I need to ride few more hundreds to realize that there is still something to improve and that Fliess 3 is not yet the best in the world haha

just a nice photo with "old shitty belts drivetrain" ;-)

now it's time to make Fliess 3 also nicer. It's gonna be lower with drop down deck + nicer enclosure (Kydex) + nicer motor wires. I don't actually know what to wish more.. Any ideas guys? I will give it to anybody here in Frankfurt to test just to get some feedbacks, because I simply love riding this beast and I want to know how it is in comparison. To be continued

p.s. and remember - **abandon your belt driven builds and just try direct drive!** Believe me, you will never look back.

Still think belt drives are here to stay for hill climbing and hi-power usage, hub/direct drive motors will have problems with cooling for quite some time. Oh and these look nicer than carvons, so congrats :wink:

I feel like you would be the hybrid result if Benjamin and Jerry from Carvon had a long lost son..

Fist you make your own dual VESC, then you make your direct drives.. seriously tho, who are you?? You definitely have some next level skills tho, mad props!

I also find it fascinating how you work your on your projects in the shadows and then you come back, make a thread and blast our faces with a ton of fascinating pictures, build progress, information etc..i find it extremely motivating to go and do some crazy sh*t to my build. You rock :metal:!

Hey it's me, your son!

For real though this is amazing. I love it, I'm amazed at your level of ability honestly. They looks so fun to ride aswell! Hopefully we might be able to get a production product/DIY guide for people who want to make direct drives?

Thanks :)

Wow! Didn't expect to get so many nice comments, guys. I really appreciate this! It's what makes me thinking that I am not just wasting my time. Actually I never thought so ;-)

Seriously talking, of course I admit that my ideas are not new ideas, and what I did is just implementation. But if I got it implemented, then anybody else can do it. So I hope my post encourages.

Now, thinking about time/effort/money spent, I would maybe rather buy some ready solution. There is only one BUT - there is nothing on the market what meets my requirements exactly and you are always dependent on 3rd party if something breaks. Worst feeling ever to be afraid to fuck something up while riding :worried: You just wanna let it go, whatever conditions are...something breaks and you can just replace it to be back on the road next days. Luckily, electric skateboard is something relatively simple to build. I don't want to build my own car :smile: Understand me correctly. I hope it's not my stupid philosophy and most people build themselves just to get something better than what is available on the market and to be sure your board is ready to fly any time.

@Rinzler, I was also sure that belt driven systems win, until tried direct drive. You have to live in really hilly area to be worried about overheating motors. Assuming we are talking about street longboards with 83-90mm wheels. I would rather put now a 3rd motor, than come back to belts :smiley:

@JLabs, put hundreds of hours on something and you have "next level skills" bro. Simple :wink:

@Armin, hey my son, all is on pictures, isn't it? :-)

@PartyPoison, these wheel attachments costed me few evenings of my life! Don't touch them! )) Seriously, they are nothing without other parts man, and it's all hand made without even drawings.

@Vanarian, remember our long discussions on endless-sphere. I hope you've got what you wanted!

 @Cobber, until now only you shown the interest. If you buy 100x from me, then I already go to my cave to drill and blast! :smile:

@Nordle, one is rewound and another just switched :wink: Rewound performs a bit better though.

@Factory72, @Armin, I really want it to be ridden by somebody who knows how to ride electric beasts! I am in Riedberg area. Come here guys, we have plenty of police-free roads through the fields.

@fliess Nice to find you again! Yes I got even more than what I wanted, still experimenting but I got my hands on caloducs, heats sinks, waiting for a killer thermal paste  to be shipped tomorrow for further experiments! Even got to try Peltiers haha

Hubs are waiting to be tested, I finished assembly today and it fits tight. I'll re-open them to try what we discussed back then with the exhausts!

Put a few more miles on them bro, might be hard up to get a buyer for 100x but I'm sure there would be people  who would buy a carvon v3/4 clone set for a diy build as long as there is no fundamental breech of business practice with carvon (& the $$$ was good)? and I don't see any...

Either way, love to see some video. What motor kv are you using? I guess the next step is a custom diy motor wind or go to someone like APS?

Winter is coming :smile: Gonna put few more hundreds for sure before winter. Only going to the office and back is 20km with jumps over the curbstones every 200m. Evolve managed to withstand this conditions exactly 200km until the motor fell apart :smile: I am very thankful to Evolve, because it was a strong trigger to build something more reliable.
In regards to motors man, believe me I had enough fun rewinding them over and over to get exactly what I wanted. On Fliess 3 one is rewound to ~100kv and another just switched from 149kv delta to ~0,7x149kv star. Usually I weight the stator before and after rewinding. +10-30g to the initial weight is a good result :relaxed:
Video for sure, just got today my Yi 4k+.

Haha caloducs are a type of copper heatpipe (sorry I think it is a french word) and Peltier are cold /hot pump flat modules ; kinda like an active cooler. It runs highly inefficient and pumps some watts but it is able to cool temp down to negative celsius when optimally set. No passive cooling can do that.

So I want to try just for fun. The problem is not power drawn from batteries since we use huge ones. It is more about heat disispation, since it really starts being annoying past 3 degrees under ambient temp. There is room for progression though, I'll keep experimenting ! But all my heatpipes and stuff are already way overkill for VESC. It is not temp anymore but components themselves which will limit power.

Very nice work !!!!

Is the stator simply slid onto the hardened axle ? does it need insulation ?

@nikoumouk, thanks! What I did is just cloning the moving part of Atlas truck, so that I can use my 12mm axle. I didn't touch the rest of the truck with kingpin.
What kind of insulation do you mean? There is an aluminium inner part of a stator, which perfectly fits to the axle. Don't make things more difficult, than they actually are :slight_smile:

That's a yes and no! I regularly take pictures of it but didn't open my own threads on this forum yet.

Got to present the cooling and solderless as well as my own builds! Gonna open a "lab thread" for the first two, I'll keep you updated.

This is so awesome!!! I really want to try this however I have a few questions.

1) How is the 12mm axle attached to the aluminum hanger? Magic glue and large set screw? 
2) Does the stator of the 63mm sk3 motor just slip onto the 12mm hanger? What would be a good glue to use?
3) What kind/grade of aluminum are you using?

If you could help me I would really appreciate it. Thanks you!

@jrpwit, thanks man! Why wouldn't I help, this forum is for help, or? :relaxed: 
1) just a keyway
2) just a keyway
3) AlCuMgPb

No glue. That would be the worst I could do. Okay, maybe after 10tkm of testing you can just use a glue :wink:

Really no glue? I though lots of motors use glue to secure the stator. Where did you drill/cut the keyways?

Would I just slide this portion of the motor onto the 12mm axel and then somehow secure it with a keyways?

Also could you explain how you made the keyway on the axel securing it to the hanger?

Sorry for all the questions and hope I'm not being confusing.
Thank you!

I am building something similar so I wonder what is the outer diameter which fits in to the hub of the wheel core.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/6/c6102e1811e2f77391935d3d27fe5af5037542ac.jpg" width="690" height="412">

@jrpwit, hey. Sorry for the late reply, but weekend was over and had to go and work to earn some money for Fliess4 :smile:
Really any drop of glue. I cut the keyway on axle with https://www.google.de/search?q=chop+saw. Once you get a keyway on axle, you can insert an axle inside a stator and drill the opposite side of a keyway. Initially I wanted to avoid such a construction, because I was afraid to weaken an axle by any cuts, but this is not a cross cut to be worried. Exactly the same you can do to secure an axle to the hanger. No magic, everything is simple. The more simple, the more reliable :slight_smile:
Initially I tried to find some photos for you, because 1 photo is better than many words, but unfortunately I didn't find any. Good luck with your hubs ;-)

I suspect you used a lathe for the end parts of the motor right? Then just cut, filled, and drilled the parts by hand for screw holes and to fit into the wheels.

I think I will use the screw method you used in the beginning to attach the motor to the wheels for my first drive. Hope I can do the end parts like you did later on.

Still working on my trucks at the moment cutting and filing away! Lol knew you had a lathe :slight_smile:

@jrpwit, screw method I used in the beginning is quite reliable if you wanna use Kegels, because the holes' pattern matches very nice with sk3 motors both 50 and 60mm. With Flywheels it's more difficult, but also doable, especially for the first experimental direct drive build.

Thing is 99.9% of the time I ride just perfectly normal and very soft Flywheels 90mm. And only sometimes, these rubber tubes over the motors act like additional wheels :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

I know, all this stuff looks a bit wrong, like there is a big problem with clearance, and it overheats...and there is not enough torque. And it looks especially suspicious for those who never tried it, or those who tried but it was a single motor, or those who tried but protection of the motors was not enough :confused:  

After all, let's see after few more thousands. So far it's only ~1000km. And believe me, roads were not always as perfect as on videos :slight_smile:

if it is, its a really long one with a posted limit of 30 mph that i regularly break testing boards, much to the piqued interest of a local officer who camps at the stop sign and  thinks i'm nuts but wants one of my boards. Every time i see him with another customer's board he's like "wtf are you riding now? Can i catch that in my cruiser?" or something equally friendly. 

I'm going to ask him if i can get video of him lit up chasing me down the street. I doubt he'll go for it but it might be fun.

Thanks @PartyPoison. I am using sk3 6372. Yes, I used only my mini lathe. Kegels are nice but only 80mm in diameter, so may be good for testing but not for the real usage :slight_smile:

If I manage to eventually bend 12mm axle, then there is a plan B to use 14mm. I am only 75kg, sometimes jumping while switching sides, bumping hard against the curbstones and the axle is still straight. Need much heavier rider to test it better :smiley:

its hard to capture the depth of the asphault wear between the aggregate stones on camera but imagine 80 grit sandpaper scaled up to street size, then touch it up with bad pothole patching, unpatched potholes, sudden inexplicable sections of entirely different asphault from another era, these not-quite a pot-hole holes that are just the right size to grab a wheel and throw you into the emergency room and are really deep for some reason like somebody stabbed the street with a pole, and random patches of gravel that seem to congregate from nowhere because the street sweeper truck is out there three times a week.  Unless you're on superflies even a solid silicone board would rattle.

@cryo, Purple Kegels are 83a, while Flywheels I use have 75a. There is a huge difference in softness when you go bumpy roards. Another really noticeable difference is how fast you can ride "asphaltless" road not losing a traction, especially when you suddenly switch from the asphalt on a speed. And riding over metro railways, if you have such in your area :smiley:

Hi, I don't know if you followed the direct drive vs geared efficiency discussion: on the paper a geared system should be more efficient than a hub motor.

BUT there is still no empirical evidence about that: @trampa suggests that the only (scientifically) FAIR comparison must be done using the SAME motor (same stator and amount of copper). Your awesome direct drive would be perfect to try both configurations.
Do you have the possibility to try your SK3s geared  1:2.5 (with idler) and record your ride through ackmaniac's app?

@PartyPoison, both motors <100kv, check my previous reply. Battery is still from the 1st build, 10s5p R25. Not the best, but gives very confident 29km of range if you ride it hard. Okay, "riding hard" is very subjective, but in my area and with my modest skills I usually end up with something like this:

@fedestanco, no I didn't follow. Thanks for the suggestion to make an experiment, but, dude, really I don't have enough motivation to do it right now. Moreover, I suspect what approximate results I will get - belt driven is gonna be slightly more efficient. I like that feeling of sudden acceleration very much (luckily it is still very good with direct drive) and of course belt driven system is more efficient in such a case.
But, if you are going perfect straight with a constant speed and motors KV perfectly fits a speed, then I believe direct drive is more efficient. Anyway, it would be even difficult to practically prove.

I ride in SF every two weeks and Tony, who has a Raptor 2, goes to every ride. We are both using the exact same battery (10s4p 30Q) and I always end the ride with more battery than him.

We're going the same speed doing the exact same route with the same incline (typically not much incline on our routes).

You may say direct drive is more efficient, and that may be true for long stretches of trail, but for the stop & go riding style of urban and city riding, I think belt drives still retain better efficiency.

I'll take a picture comparing the two boards on our next group ride :)

@thebeast, homemade, every part with care :smile:
Recently tried to swap back to my old 83mm (80a) flywheels and must say it's crazily good feeling on a good road comparing to 90mm (75a) flywheels. Talking about genuine flywheels of course.
It seems I am coming to the point of understanding that there is no just a single thing which is good for everything. If you wanna ride fast and carve sharp, then surely you need harder/smaller wheels, like downhillers do. For relaxing long trips or just commute ugly soft 90mm+ wheels.

Yes I'm very interested in these... Do you plan on selling any, or if not the motors, maybe you could sell the wheel connection adapter you made.  Was the case for these motors just the sk3 lathed down a bit or did you make a whole new cylinder /case for the motor and the wheel adapter?  I would buy immediately if you were selling!
![20180202_073544|306x500](upload://hLUgxkUWk6eRdbfaVtxxlCAYYL1.jpg)
Is this a whole new piece, or just the motors polished up and the new wheel connector added on top?

If he would sell his adapters they wouldn't fit 63mm motors. Because sk3 63xx motors are actually 59mm in diameter, and aliens motors are true 63mm dia. And they use other magnets, not sure if his adapters have teeth on the other side wich goes between the magnets.

I don't think it matters that it be exactly flush with the motor.  If it's just 3mm less in diameter, it'll still fit over a 63mm motor.  As for where it would screw in, he could leave it blank and let us do it ourselves, or  have multiple positioned holes for the screws.

@uigiroux, hey dude. Nice to see again some activity in my modest thread :slightly_smiling_face:
And especially nice that not only I believe, that direct drive is good, damn good.
My tausend km is already behind and motors are doing very well. What is also nice, that dirt is not a problem for DD. And of course if you like aggressive riding, you would appreciate having normal wheels on which you can always rely (unfortunately still not a case with hubs).

However, there are also drawbacks - you have to carefully think about motors protection. Yes, really carefully. I realised that after broken magnets one of the motors. And this happened despite on 2mm thick protective cases. Having silicone tubes over protective cases makes things much better, but worsen heat dissipation, which may become a problem in hilly areas.
To forget about both issues forever I am trying now V4A stainless steel (ouu eah, this is much harder than just a steel, already fucked up my mini lathe tools) thick bushings over the motors. This is ~1kg mass overhead, but should be super strong and 0 issues with overheating. Also allows to ride normal 83mm wheels for proper fun without being worried about motors :relieved:

Ah, yes, back to questions: no, I don't sell, this is too much time consuming; on pictures is a whole new piece, i.e. sk3 motor as it is + 63,5mm case on top + wheel connector, which is rather connected to the case than the motor itself (no teeth on inner side). I need to check for more pictures. 6384 will make your skate ugly wide/heavy and too much powerful (unless you decide to also use ugly 90mm+ wheels). On this video https://youtu.be/zg72OSutHYI I am still on 90mm wheels and there is true 20% hill. As you can see there is no issue with power, even if you go up and down multiple times (tested). Once I came on true 29% hill, but it started to rain and my test failed :disappointed_relieved: Although, it became clear, that on 90mm wheels with 6374 it would only be doable with pre-acceleration. 83mm change the game though and much more fun to ride.

Depends on the hardware.

A high kv motor can run more efficient on a low S count than a low kv motor on a higher S count.
It depends.

This topic is going out of control :smile: Let me post at least something, which is related.

Small update after 500km, which I did in 2018 on my stainless steel motors. Yeah, not much, I expected to have already >1000km, but good weather is coming only now.

THIS IS AMAZING!!! Now I can only confirm my previous assumptions: **DD + good motors' protection + adequate wheels = best riding experience ever!** And believe me guys, my motors have seen everything and they have eaten thousands of rocks and potholes. Actually, I started to like when motors roll over something and make metallic dull noise :crazy_face:

@Okami, usually happens when you ride along the "waves" on shitty asphalt. Not the best feeling on a high speed, because stainless steel is not that sticky as urethane haha
Or if you mean something like hitting a static rock on speed, then it feels pretty much the same as hitting it with a wheel, but a bit harder :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

I would like to try doing something similar but curious as to how the torque compares to the carvons as I find toruqe to be more important than top speed.

well done with the other build threads as well! took me a while to get through the first fliess post lol. Though I'm fairly sure I'd be way in over my head to try something like that because I do want the "Stealthy" and simple look of direct drives but Carvon is currently the only option not including the upcoming TD direct drives as well.

Seeing how you wound up the motors was just crazy I can't even imagine how you did that lol. Would you happen to have a video of you putting everything together or would that be too much to ask

Interested in getting the same kind of performance though I know that satellite configurations will usually beat out direct drives but if the difference isnt that big then I'd go for directs for all the other pros

@Wraith, thanks man. First Fliess post is indeed too much detailed, nobody needs the photos of standard motors and other bullshit, at the end. But that was my first build and I was overexcited :smile:

Regarding the **torque** of DD: from my experience, 2 x 6374 + 90mm wheels is NEVER not enough. Exceptions would be living in very hilly area (hills >20%) or too heavy rider (>90kg). Even here you can swap to 83mm wheels and get significantly better torque (but sacrifice clearance).

Another concern is **efficiency**: this also discussed million times already. In short, I would summarize, that if you are aggressive rider, then in most cases you will get less range on DD. Again, depends on motors' configuration to some extent.

My current configuration gives 55-60kmh max, wheels are in range from 77 to 90mm (depends how much they are worn), the range is up to 30km (depends how much you push, 10s5p, samsung 25r ~2years old). I did not think about returning back on belts **for any single moment**.

Hey @pat.speed! Good question. Really, I was expecting someone asks before, but nobody did. You can find with 22mm OD, but they are rare and expensive. I just made adapters for 21mm bearings :wink:

Ahh ok, I was thinking that, I was able to find a few on the skf website but they were more than 10mm wide. Thanks, one more question what are the chances of a galvanised steel axle lasting? The main reason for it is it is super cheap and it has better elongation rating than hardened, which made me think it might be better considering when stressed it will bend instead of snap

There are some, e.g. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IK4JYA0/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_2?smid=AFLT987H7WA7G&psc=1
I cannot say anything constructive about galvanised steel axle, have no practical experience. Talking about hardened rods, they are usually only surface hardened, i.e. ~1mm deep. I was relatively easily able to drill a 10mm hole inside 12mm axle.

@fliess Hi man! I hope you are getting better. I see in the thread that you got injured. I am planning on making my own DD and I would like to ask you an advice. I was wondering how did you secure the bearings? Press fit only?
Concerning the motor can at the back I guess you use a big bearing like 61805 and you have two cylinder, one that is indie the inner ring of the bearing and in contact with the stator (not spinning one) and on that is place between the outer bearing rind the actual motor can (spinning one). Is it right?
Thanks a lot!

@rey8801 you might already know but if you don’t have access to the bearing race you’ll be pressing on (to either the shaft or housing) it’s pretty easy to damage the bearing.  Retaining fluid is a much easier method of getting a tight fit.

## \#195 Posted by: Hummie Posted at: 2018-10-30T20:55:37.323Z Reads: 221

 I mean u have to be pressing the inside part of the bearing if onto a shaft n the outside of the bearing if onto the housing.  If u press the inside of the bearing when onto a housing the force to get on has to go through the balls and it will pit the race the balls roll on n ruin the bearing possibly.  But retaining fluid with a tight slide fit is what it sounds like ur doing so no worry.

ah ok got it. Thx. One question, in your opinion. While design a pocket to host a bearing. I ususally see them like a hole of the width of the bearing plus 1-2 mm of metal flag to stop the bearing to go through the hole. In this case where woudl you place that part? at the inner side of the motor can or at the outer side? That will translate in press the bearing from the inside of the motor can or from the outside. Thanks!

sounds good.  so the motor leads are magnet wire the length of them with those motors.  nice.  very cool I always wanted to do the termination with a motor like that.  but you do have to worry that they are all the starts or all the ends terminated together.  maybe you'd have to see the winding pattern to be sure.  how are you going to be sure you have all starts or all the ends together as they will show the same on the multimeter or inductance meter and wont show the direction theyre wound.  you'll have to figure the winding pattern I think or maybe you did.

the lip for the bearing in the photo I don't know how tight the winding is to the bearing or if there's other obstacles but for me I cant get to the inner steel of that bearing and to remove it I have to pull it from the outer steel and it gets ruined when replacing them.  not that id want to take it off without replacing it anyway but that lip normally I think youd want small enough that you could get to the inner part of the bearing to pull it and not stress the bearing.  im no machinist or engineer and recently was wondering the same question.  I think the smaller the lip the better and you should be able to get away with even .2mm or something I bet.  as long as its strong enough

So I’ve spent about 30mins trying to figure it out and I reckon I’ve got it. Based on some common sense that even a machine cannot wind wire from the outside to the inside I have gotten the starts and ends.

Now that I have these you are saying to wire all the ends as the phase leads and all the starts as the ground or common point. Or is it the other way around

[/quote]

at the end it doesn't matter much from which side, especially if you're sure that your bearing is 100% fixed. If bearing tends to move when the force from a side applied, then it depends on your particular design. In case of Fliess3 it's from the inner side of the motor and most probably will be the same on Fliess4.

And then ur a step away from having the delta wye switch. That would make for some classic data logging comparing. Is there a nice switch out there? A button imbedded in the hanger I haven’t seen. There’s some outrunner brand I forget with the 6 prongs to connect to instead of 3 leads. And not the topic but u have the rare potential.  Maybe you could run it on each for a couple miles each and log. I’m still looking to see that comparison

There was another method of altering the winding I read about where you’d connect the magnet wires end to end. I think It ends up very low kv.  I’ll send u a set of centrax wheels if u do all three motor chsnges and log n post it!

@fliess Hi! One question. I am testing how to fix the stator pipe to the the stain steel axle of the truck. I was thinking of drill and make a threaded hole in the stator pipe (perpendicular to the pipe) and then make a flat spot, as a key way, on the trucks axle. Hence a can use a grub screw to hold it in place on the axle. Do you think is better a flat spot or a small hole where the screws goes inside? Thx

Another way is to just sandwich everything between the hanger and axle bolt, with a square profile on the hanger and stator pipe. The same way most hub motors lock

Yes I know you did it in that way. In may case I would need to do something different because the motor stator has a bigger hole. I am planing to make a stator pipe made out of two parts (less material to mill) and then my question is whether for your is better a hole through the parts and use a grub screw that goes inside the axle too or stop before the axle with the hole and only make a flat spot on the axle (I was thinking on doing it on two sides).
Here a picture that shows the parts.

True and maybe make a space that will squeeze all the parts together. Although I would prefer to have everything in place by itself, but definitely I will think about it. Thx

You could try bolting it to the hanger, I think carvon do something like that

So am I, I don’t have any fancy tools like lathes and cncs. My most valuable tool would be my drill press.

I have a design of how to do what I want but if it fails I will just take it to a machine shop and have them do it. It would still be cheaper than a normal drive train

Well I have recently bought modest CNC and mini lathe. I made a nice workshop in my basement. So I can make nice thing with it. Yes you can made it outside, but believe me that it will cost you a lot. Even if you ask for price oversee, a set of the parts you need would be at least 300$, that hoping that the parts will fit perfectly at the first try. You will still save a bit, but if you add shipping cost and the the two motors you won't save that much anymore. Still worth it to me, because you make it as you want, but just that you know. I do test my test with 3D printed parts and i reality a lot of things can be made better after you physically see them.

yeh yeh I know. I first asked locally and the price were so high that I started to look oversee where indeed are lower but still quite pricey. I am talking about single unit production. If you can find a local one at a good price then definitely go for it! In my case I couldn't find it.

I mean  Ican do it out of one single piece but thatn the metal piece and the milling work will be more. I think that if I use the same grub screws to lock the two parts and the axle should be plenty. They are goinf to be really thight fit and I will add retaining loctite too.

nice drawings! I wish I would also did some drawings before machining. That would definitely save some time at the end and made it easier to share the design to community.

[/quote]

will it be hardened axle, then flat spot is easier and should suffice. I would not even know immediately how to make a hole through the axle I use, because it's too hard (material). I would probably need to make a flat spot first (to overcome hardened surface) and then drill the rest.
If it's not a hardened axle, then let's say 2.5mm hole in 12mm axle should not make it much weaker. I still like the idea of keyway much more I have to admit :wink: But it's not that easy to make a nice symmetrical half-parts of keyway on both parts...

Yeh drawing helps a lot. I usually then tested with  3d printed parts and then proceed. I always find some adjustments to do it. 
About the axle I will probably go for hardened one, although I will need to mill it with my new mini lathe and I am afraid it will be so hard. I also have access at a really big a strong lathe, but I would rather make it in my workshop instead. The problem with a key way is to make it on the axle. Although I have now a small CNC so I could clamp the axle in a vise and let it do it for me. I thought about the grub screw because I would need to join together the two stator pipe parts anyway.
For designing I use fusion360. It's free for student, makers. It's really friendly use and I learn everything on YouTube. So many nice tutorials. You should try it out.

True true! Ahahah you really learn fast and then you see so much potential.. I made already quite a lot of design for several projects. It really changed everything. Plus if you know how to use Photoshop you can combine the two and then no limits.

ok neat.   I will shut up because its like exactly the same hub as I have and I don't want to talk your ear off..and need to go back and glue magnets, but grub screws suck in my mind and right at the weakest part there.

here is my design for the truck, axle and the sleeve for the motor to be slid on. nothing is final. The holes are for grub screws to hold the axle in place. The Axle has a M10 thread inside the hanger. I will still edit this further.

Total length 330mm. Maybe i will edit this to make it slimmer. Or make a shorter axle with shorter motors...dunno.
Edit: ok i can shorten it 2cm easy.

That more similar to the first DD I designed and I need theast two parts to finish it. In my case I chose that sokution because it is a conversion kit from hub motors to DD style (weird to say it sincehub motors is DD too :laughing:). As you will probably realize is gonna be difficult to machine it. I guess you will hire a company to do it. That is way I opted for a more simpler design.

Ok thanks for the suggestion, I will see if I can find another solution. Anyhow maybe was not ear but this one is for a direct drive, no hub motor style. So the grub screw would be just next to the truck hanger. Not on the side, no not sure that the force there would be comparable. Then it's all the way a straight 12mm axle.
