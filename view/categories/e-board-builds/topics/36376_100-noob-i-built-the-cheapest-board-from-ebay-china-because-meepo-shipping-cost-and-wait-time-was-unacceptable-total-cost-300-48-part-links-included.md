Review:
I weigh 185lbs. The breaking sucks though i'm getting better with it. Trottle curve is awesome on beninner mode and agressive on pro mode. I printed a part for my remote to give me more expo (sensitivity). I don't have any issues with the trottle after a day of learning it.
Conclusion: I love this board because it does what I want. I can go miles on miles with it. Perfect for tailgating. 19mph perfect to run my dog. Can't complain. It does what I want it to do but it just looks ugly. 
I want to upgrade the tires to air tires. It will make it slower and less distance but could save me $$$$ in medical bills if it can take a rock or bump better. I want to use the sidewalk and there are to many cracks so air tires are needed. Any idea what to get how to do it with what I have?

Issues: 
1. ESC has cut off 2x. Simple reboot fixes it. Trying to figure out why. Maybe a big bump or low voltage is doing it. Testing some more. Update: Might of fixed it by slamming a mouse pad between the esc and board.
2. ESC said default was set for 24v with pictures to change input voltage. Pictures do not match the board. Not sure how to change it to 10s or if 24v is even set correctly. I do think its set to 24v.
3. Can not program the ESC. Wish someone would figure it out. Cant set voltage cutoff. Not sure if ESC has it. I think it does.
4. Set screws on the motor mount sucks. Can't remove them. Cant adjust the motor mount up and down. It's ok but it worked for me.

nice board for that low budget, you did a great job. How did you attach the fan? can you show pics where to plug it in? I'm looking for that same esc. To change voltage you have to look at three solder points and join the ones that are indicated. You can contact maybe diyeboard, who makers them and they might be able to tell you exactly

Thanks!
I was going to attach the fan with bolts but after failing to get the holes the correct distance I said F it and continued on with the project. I used gorilla glue to glue it down to the 3d printed casing. 

Yea I know about chancing the voltage but none of the pictures match up with the new esc's apparently. Inspected it and couldn't find the spots to solder. I didn't need to tho bc im running 24v.

I wish someone would figure out how to program the esc.

I still need help figuring out what bushing to get and how to configure it for air tires.

I thought people would disagree bc the common theory is only buy high quality parts where I searched for the absolute cheapest.

you can try and contact diyeboard, they may be able to tell you just in case about the solder points. 

About attaching it I meant where did you plug it in the board, Is there a connector for 5V in it?

I have not done it yet but have the new 5v fan coming in tomorrow. There is a 5v rail coming off the hub sensor. Even has a spot to soldier on a wire. I'm going to use that to get 5v.

I sell premium parts and premium boards but i get skittles and a coke on a koowheel half the time. 

If what you get works for you, then it works for you. Fuck the haters man. The chinese want to stay in business, they're not going to produce shit parts forever. 

I'll just stand here and wait for the angry mob to form around me now.

I'll have a look at it when I buy it, because i have plenty spare fans and it would be good for cooling. Will ask you for a picture if I don't find it

I went zealous bearings and never went back to redz, not needing spaces and speed rings is great.

So are u from US or EU? There are different options to acquire pneumatic tires.. one being printing a plastic hub and ordering inner tubes / rubber tire part on aliexpress or similar place.

Search what user @Maxid did.. otherwise it is hard to find cheap sets, where everything is included.

i read somewhere that this esc comes default to 10s. maybe because of that, your voltage cutoff is to high. THIS IS FOR dual but hope it helps to change voltage
