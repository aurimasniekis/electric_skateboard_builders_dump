Usually $400 I bought it for $300 New, authentic and everything. Here are the specs- My question is should I refund it or are these materials worth a lot from my DIY build, coming soon. Thank you!

I feel like if you utilize the 300 bucks towards a DIY board you're going to have a much better board than this. I don't know though.  Since my project have gone far above that but I feel like it's probably doable.

I believe what Blink did here is just to brand a very common Chinese hub design that I have seen plenty times on Alibaba and others. I think Carvon also uses this in their mini cruiser. Not saying that it is bad, it's simple and might be enough for a little joyful ride.

Does 5 mile range and 15mph top speed suit your needs?   If yes, keep it.  If you need something faster and with more range, return it.

2 ah? How the heck is 2 ah even going to take someone a mile, no the less 5 miles?

[quote="Shouken, post:1, topic:8664"]
this range is tested under ideal conditions
[/quote]


Well their definition of ideal conditions must be 5 miles all down hill. Heck, 7.5 ah at 10s barely gets me 5 miles on hubs. I've never even heard of such a small battery being used on an electric skateboard. And with 10c at 2 ah? I just don't get what they were thinking... It's like, $20 for that battery, the least they could have done was double the size to 4 ah...

Even if you were to build a highly efficient belt drive system (like I did with my first board), the best I got with 8 ah was 10 miles, and that's being super conservative with the trigger. I call bs on their range.

It's believable to me. 10s at 2ah is 72 watt hours. Assuming 10wh per km this would get 7.2km or 4.4 miles. I find the 10wh per km estimate to be fairly accurate, at least on my dual belt drive.

learn to calculate watt-hours instead of just reading amp-hours.  The battery is listed as a  25.5V, 2.2Ah,  so 56 watt hours.   Esk8 rule of thumb 10wh = 1km range, the battery is good for 5.6km or 3.5 miles.

And my point is I was running 3:1 gearing ratio with a 190 kv motor, and on my route with 8 ah and a 6s battery or 208 watt hours, and I was very lucky to get 10 miles. So in my case, I got a mile per 20 watt hours, which would mean with a 2.2amp hours at 6s, I would get like 2.7 miles, not 5. I didn't do the watt hours becuase I was comparing a 6s setup to a 6s setup, so I didn't find it necessary. But that's also my riding style. I don't want to ride at 8 mph so I can milk 5 miles for my battery. If there's one thing we can agree, it's you won't get 5 miles at 15 mph.

Even by your calculation, you don't get 5 miles... So you basically confirmed what I said, that the battery can't do 5 miles.

These boards are made by [E-Wheelin](https://e-wheelin.en.alibaba.com/) (i3 is single motor and i4 is dual motor) and sold by multiple companies under various names. Here are [the photos of all the internals](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kasparsdambis/albums/72157667661928215) including the hub motor which are all extremely nicely done for that price.

It has a 7S battery pack made out of 2.2Ah 18650 cells with no BMS which is around 25.9V x 2.2Ah = 57Wh (MacBook Air has a 54Wh battery).

It has a sensored 18 pole stator (43mm x 30mm).

Here are some power/speed logs -- notice how many times it cuts out because of the over-current protection (I assume):

The Acton Blink Board is what got me started on my DIY. It was a good board but it just left me hungry for more speed, more power and more stability at higher speeds.

If you have a child or significant other who can use it once you get bored of it, then keep it, otherwise, get a refund and use that money for something you are eventually going to get anyway
