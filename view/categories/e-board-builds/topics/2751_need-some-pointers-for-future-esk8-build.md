Greetings!
My plans for electric skateboarding have been brewing for quite some time, but were abandoned because of some hard life situation.
So, recently i remembered about esk8 movement and found that it evolved a lot!
 Only in march 2016 I found ENERTION and this forum.

Basically, I want some key pointers from more experienced members about what to do.


1x Enertion Dual Drive R-SPEC Pro+ Kit  2x R-SPEC 6355 Motors [555usd]
2x vesc [105usd]
2x Turnigy nano-tech A-SPEC 4500mah 3S 65~130C Lipo Boat Pack (Mono1) [57usd]
1x HK-GT2B + badwolf mod  [23usd]
=902usd
With possible later upgrades:
2x Turnigy nano-tech A-SPEC 4500mah 3S 65~130C Lipo Boat Pack (Mono1) [57usd]
=1016usd

1x mono drive r-spec pro+ 1x R-SPEC 6374 BIGBOY Motor [409usd] 
2x vesc [105usd]
2x Turnigy nano-tech A-SPEC 4500mah 3S 65~130C Lipo Boat Pack (Mono1) [57usd]
1x HK-GT2B + badwolf mod  [23usd]
=756usd
With possible later upgrades:
1x single motor mount [51usd]
1x 12mm wide drive pulley kit [38usd]
2x Turnigy nano-tech A-SPEC 4500mah 3S 65~130C Lipo Boat Pack (Mono1) [57usd]
=908usd (and question below about motor)


As you may see, in the long term (with gradual acquiring upgrade parts) second build is much more powerful and  only  ~50$ more  expensive with possible motor.

As it were shown in[ this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eakga9Bzj9E)  video - i want to  built diagonal drive on 6374.
My weigh is ~80 kg (which is in Enertion Dual Drive R-SPEC Pro+ range) , not 100+, but I have pretty big hills in my region and therefore i need more power.


**MAIN question with this built** is motor. Because on the site i could buy separatly only 190kv 6372, not 6374.
I could not even find technical info on 6374 BIGBOY!
[This](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/6374-190kv-electric-skateboard-motor/) link  tells its 6374, but item name is shown as 6372. Where is the truth?
Any alternative decisions?

I myself currently found 1  way out of this - completly change motors to  Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6364-245kv 2700W [71usd]
But its is not as powerful as 6374/72


I apologize in advance for possible grammar errors.
English is not my native language.

Motor specs are bogus.  Chose a motor based on size alone.  They're all pretty much the same unless ur spending a lot more.  Save a bunch and just get them from hobby king or hobbypartz. Don't believe the hype.

You could probably save a bit in the battery department. 65C continuous means you can draw 270A continous, which like x20 more than you will be drawing. Most people on here use 20 C. Also if you want to run dual VESCs, you might consider some larger capacity packs.

I chose that model mostly because of its dimensions. 150x44x19.5мм and so called "nano-tech" longevity.
Ok, I'll look into some sliim 20c.

I use the nanotech boat 90c and other 35c zippy.  I notice a difference but not worth it
