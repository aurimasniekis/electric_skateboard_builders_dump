Had a lot of fun already on this forum ... own already 3 boards, 2 in riding conditions, untill now ;-)

So it is time to document the almost complete rebuild of my Trampa.

This came in. So i had no excuse anymore. 

Started the build this morning ... changed out the truck because the small one lacks space for dual 6374 149kv sensored motors.

Sadly work is calling but will update regularly during the coming weeks.
