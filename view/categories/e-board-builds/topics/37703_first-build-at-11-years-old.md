Hi guys! I am trying to build my first electric skateboard at 11 years old. Will all these parts work together? https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xC0ECwtCuswqaRSFZDTcRdNbkFcU3WCZsm-AiO5VnYM/edit?usp=sharing. Please help and make suggestions. Thanks!

Did you organise trucks in all this? I didn't see either the deck or wheels come with trucks mate. Also the majority of what you got seems good. 
Are you planing on getting your batteries in Parallel? Do you have the right tools for soldering all this together? Also how do you plan on storing your batteries/vesc on your board?
 If you need help on how to use the search function feel free to ask, not all of us here are bullies :)

Thanks, that was the other part I didn't touch on. Although you can use the anti spark you've chosen @Caleb1 it isn't generally what is done. An inline anti spark is used to save having to plug the VESC in and out all the time. 

Here's a good thread on it:

Not very well. They will work, but they're not the best option. 

What I was getting at earlier with the batteries, was that those packs are only good for maybe 10 amps each. The cells are not designed to supply loads of power at once, which is something that is needed in an electric vehicle, to get up to speed.

It would be better to go with a smaller, higher discharge battery. That setup will be very heavy and not that powerful. I'd go with two 5s 5000mah lipo batteries instead. They're cheap, they're high power, lighter than the 18650 pack and easy to work with.

B264 is also right, a 6374 is a bit overkill for an 11-year-old. A 5065 or 6355 would be a better choice.

That motor is not sensored.  Which is okay, if that's what you want.  Do you know the difference yet?

Also, it's big enough for a grown 250lb man to go super fast, you'll probably be fine with a 5065 or a 6355 if you are a lot lighter than that.  That's a BIG motor, I mean huge.  Like a can of soup.  Remember, you have to carry that around and the more visible it is, the more you'll be hassled

Tip: Those specific motors aren't 63mm by 74mm, either.

Also if you're going to use that charger, you're going to need some sort of BMS. The ebay packs have one built in, but if you go with lipo batteries, you'll need to add on in. 

The other option is to not use that charger, and get a balance charger to use with the lipo packs.

For Battery buy pre made li ion @GrecoMan had something you might be able to use, as for riding I'm pretty sure under 16 is illegal can't say for sure so be careful on the streets and check the laws in your state, they will confiscate it if you are caught breaking any law and they don't hand it back, excited to see how this goes

Everywhere is totally different.  Where I live, you need a driver's license (at least 16 years old) and a helmet.  Some places they are illegal.  Some places nobody knows if they are legal or not.  California has a specific law just for them.  (that one would be illegal: too fast)

The best way to deal with that, is don't build something that can exceed 24mph and when you ride it, be very nice and respectful to everyone around you.  If other people are annoyed by you, then you will have lots of problems.  If you don't piss anyone off and you're not doing extremely unsafe things, it's likely nobody will care, cops included.  Also, the more loud and flashy the board is, the more likely you'll have issues.  If folks see you and they don't even know it's electric, well at that point it doesn't even matter if they care, because they don't know...

```
Lithium polymer batteries can give you a lot more current for a given capacity (this is known as a c rating). While for a lithium ion battery you might need 4000 mah to get 20 amps of current, a 5000mah lipo can reach 100+ amps no problem (for short periods of time)

My biggest safety tip for you is that you should get a normal longboard and learn how to ride that properly first. This includes learning how to footbrake and do safety slides/speed checks/Colemans. Your electronics will fail at some point and if you're not ready you could die. This is something a lot of newcomers to this hobby don't fully appreciate. Going fast is extremely dangerous and normal foot-powered longboarders develop the ability to slow down as they develop the ability to push themselves faster.

If you have any questions feel free to hit me up.

I actually just bought that battery to try it out "for science". I suspect it wouldn't give very much power, but it should be able to deliver enough amps to at least give as much power as some of those chinese boards that I see selling for $300. I will update once I have tested it though.

You're right to worry. I've had 3 separate cops hassle me about it and one even me gave a ticket. Either they don't know the law (which is sad considering they're cops) or they just don't care and want to fill their quota.

First what's your budget? It seems you're missing a pair of trucks and the remote. You need a thread lock that's for sure. You also might consider the HUB motor option, it depends on how much research you might or might not shave off a couple bucks.
Look up 18650 batteries and BMS, it could save you a lot of trouble if you or your brother are familiar with soldering.
Motor mount - you could get [this.](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/motor-mount-5.html?countrycode=US&gclid=Cj0KCQiAlpDQBRDmARIsAAW6-DMqbJF7OQiwImd8Kq2txpWQgcn-8oYK4vMbHGoKUCmBCwBvvf51K74aAtpYEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
All of this can be determined by knowing your budget so I suggest you list your budget and your desire speed/torque.

i personally use the 2nd option in my board and love it.  my pack is three of those 10s2p packs connected in parallel so I can get a decent discharge rate.  if your looking for light and plug and play-ish go with meepo board one.  for the 2nd one to be viable you have to connect atleast three of them together for 10s6p

Do you think all my pats will work together. I donÂ´t have it on the spreadsheet but I am going to use caliber trucks, and use a meepo battery and charger.

there[sic] both 10s2p witch is pretty good. Im no lithium ion expert but i have to say the one from meepoboards is your better choices between the 2. It seems to have more range and you can get it with a case.

The Meepo one will probably cost $30 to ship and take 30 days to ship, where the eBay one probably ships free and takes 4 days to arrive...
