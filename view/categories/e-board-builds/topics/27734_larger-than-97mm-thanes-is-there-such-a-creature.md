I have been running 97mm flywheel clones and I am pretty happy with them. However, for rough roads in my area, a bit larger would be great for cracks in the road and potholes. Yes of course I could simply avoid them..easier said than done! I have tossed around the idea of pneumatics and with the cost along with the decreased range I would rather keep running thanes. Does anyone have any experience with wheels larger than 97mm? I know mbs make the 100mm AT wheels but I do not like the bumpy ride they produce along with the fact they lose traction easier on asphalt.

From what I've read on the history of downhill there is a upper limit to wheel size. People at that time pushed wheel size to the max  and found that when you go to big the wheels simply take to long to reach speed.

I'm guessing a eskate can handle larger wheels because of the motor. But you could end up with a similar problem. Gearing could help.

Marbel designed the 101S but with a bigger core and less urethan so there is less weight
SlickRevolution do have a 110mm Rough Stuff Wheels, I think thats the biggest longboard wheel and they are heavy 630g compared to 336g of a 97mm Flywheel

You'll lose a little. Not enough to even complain about though with 6" pneumatics.

As far as the urethanes go. Wait for the 107's. It will be worth it.

Pneumatics are bad ass! Can't even begin to tell you how fun it is riding mountain trails and fire roads on a longboard. 

The 107's seem unreal. I haven't done much testing yet other than Chris' wheelchair trailer yesterday. Buttery smooth!

There is no NDA regarding the 107mm SuperFly's. There are only 12 sets of the 74a Reflex Formula final production samples in the universe. We're putting in an initial order ASAP and that could take as long as 6 weeks but hopefully less than a month. Unlike the original centerset version of this wheel, the width of this wheel to the inside is the same as the Classic Flywheels so that any wheel pulley that fits into a Flywheel will fit into the 107mm SuperFly. I just started a graphic contest so you could win a set for free. 

They will be expensive and people will complain about that, as if I can control our costs which I absolutely can't. But they are the smoothest and longest lasting wheel out there. Bigger, softer, and with more urethane depth than the 97mm Flywheel in 75a (current king of the jungle).

I'll put 'em on a scale later today. But whatever it is, my experience is that the extra weight is always well worth it. You NEED, NEED, NEED a generous amount of urethane, especially if you have a (relatively) large core inside that wheel. What you gain in smoothness and roll speed far outweighs any additional weight. Stop eating doughnuts and lose a pound there instead ;)

Can't wait for the offset 107 flywheels!  

BUT you can setup the existing dual w/ the right trucks, and simply buy longer screws to secure the wheel gear:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-extended-diyes-218mm-caliber-ii-clones-what-will-fit-6374-dual-and-97mm-wheels/25099/8?u=sl33py

No hacking needed, no cutting/lathing the wheel thane back, etc.  Just 70mm bolts vs 50mm in most 40t gear kits.  

If you want dual 6374 then you need wider trucks, but spaced out properly i think you could fit dual 6354 - i'll try to test to confirm.  But the wheel gear (hardest part) is actually easily doable w/ 40t gear, and longer bolts.

This is AWESOME!  Can't wait for these to become available.  Also like the idea for a group buy or intro discount to the community!  (hint hint).

These look slimmer than the current 107 e-flywheels - correct?  That might help with the weight, which is not insignificant:
[img]https://goo.gl/4e3WK9[/img]
(1.29lb ea x 4 = 2356g/5.19lbs!)  Would love a "slimmer" 107 option.  Best of both worlds especially at 74a duro!  I'm a 97mm flywheel fan, so this will be awesome!!!

Look forward to more info when available!

If that 107mm Flywheel is 589 grams and its volume is 538,527 cubic millimeters and the SuperFly version is 464,005 cubic millimeters then the weight of the SuperFly is about 507.49 grams.

I'd consider a group buy.

Here's a cross section of an Evolve 38T 5M HTD wheel pulley in a SuperFly.

I see no reason why these wouldn't work on the Carvon V3. And speaking of the V3, I buzzed around on one yesterday and it feels awesome under foot. I had to adapt to the "free rolling" that comes with direct drive but there was nothing difficult about that ... just different. And even though the 97mm Flywheels in 75a Classic felt amazing on Matt's board (with the SurfRodZ TKPs), I have a feeling that the 107's are going feel smoother still.

In a perfect world I'd want to make available 32T, 34T, 36T, 38T, 40T, 42T, and 44T 5M HTD pulleys for the 83mm, 90mm, 97mm, and 107mm Flywheels and SuperFly's.

Here's an overlay of the following three wheels:

Classic Centerset 97mm Flywheel (52mm wide / 44mm contact patch)
Original Centerset 107mm Flywheel (76mm wide / 58mm contact patch)
New Offset 107mm SuperFly (64mm wide / 55mm contact patch)

Yes, the SuperFly is "trimmer" so that it is 100% compatible with all of the existing Flywheel pulley adapters. The other sized offset SuperFly's will also be compatible, but the profile of the wheel will be more like the BigZig HD's than the Classic Flywheels. They will be little narrower at 62mm wide.

Do you have a rough ETA on when you will be able to start producing pulleys? Also for mounts as well for precision trucks.

About the pulleys, are you going to make the bolted on ones have spokes to go into the wheel spokes? It would be easier that way to align it straight as some times I have trouble with pulleys that has no spokes and is not flush with the hub wheels to get aligned perfectly.

Pullies are already available. 
As stated by Chris these are designed with an offset so whatever pulley you are currently using with work with these wheels. 
Give the whole thread a read it covers this.
