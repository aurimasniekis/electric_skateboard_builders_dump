This is my latest build.  There are still a couple of things to do but its def ridable.  I don't typically do build logs anymore, but I thought this one needed one as it's the most expensive board I've ever built :slight_smile:. 

Here's the build sheet, so you can see how much money I spent...

OK, so now to meat and potatoes...  Being a world class dumbass who is nevertheless lucky as an irishman I hit 26mph on it yesterday.  No vibration at all, no wobble at all, lush.  I was a little worried about the geometry of the cutouts, and still can't say I understand it, but it at least does NOT hurt the ride quality, I assume it helps.  

I still have to replace the enclosure I'm using, it's not deep enough for the battery pack but it will work temporarily.  @psychotiller  is sending me one, should be here in a few days   I will have to replace the volt meter as well, its too thick so the battery keeps hitting the switch.  I think I have one that will decrease the space significantly.  I'm waiting on new belts, I seem to have misplaced my HTD5M 15x340mm belts, so more are on the way.  Currently I'm running 9mm belts as they were here, kinda worried about shredding them though.  I thought I might have an issue with the amount of teeth making contact since the pulleys are so close, but it doesn't seem to be a problem, no slippage at all.  Lastly, I need to add a bluetooth module, the one I put in there is not working but its been in 3 or 4 boards so I guess i finally nerf'd it.  No worries though, I've got a couple more.  I did not include heat shrink, wire  connectors as I already had them, prolly another $20 or so.

I'll post some more pics when I get the board completed and get some more ride time.

I've got a dumb question

The tires look to be directional, the rears are facing the right way, but the fronts are backwards...

Anyway the main reason for this post, how do they ride vs a regular pneumatic? How is wear?

I did drill into the deck.  I used 3/4 truss head sheet metal screws.  I might replace those with threaded inserts when I get my new enclosure next week, just depends on if the holes line up or not.

Just finished a 12 mile ride with my kid. The trucks are super carvy, as in the most carvy trucks I've ever ridden.  If I put thane on I could slide all over the place. 

@whitepony, you NEED a set of precision surfrodz.

It's a little weird getting used to no bindings after 2 months if nothing else. The deck is really comfortable though. I tend to steer with my back door more than I should but this deck is conducive to back steering, works well and eases some of the dead foot I get after a long ride.  I still can't explain what the weird cutout geometry is for, but whatever it is it works. 

The airless wheels are great. Not as comfortable as nummies but pretty close and grippy like glue. I think they wouldn't be as good without the offset 6 shooters. I feel like they are good because of all the inside pressure pushing out, making them more grabby then normal. 

I'll post some videos tomorrow. Was having something fun I forgot to take any.

I like the motors alot, being sealed it gets a lot less debris inside so that should a lot smoother. I don't know what the exact efficiency is but I am getting more range than expected. After a 12 mile ride yesterday I had 34% left so I'm guessing about 16 miles.

It's not flexxy really.  I'm not a little guy and it flexes less than 1/8in with me in the middle of the deck. That being said, running wheels that will compress like nummies or these airless wheels flex is not important. The wheels some up the vibration and rough surfaces.

[/quote]

I've heard more than one person say that and it's just not true. There's is more turn in the front than is normal but there's plenty in the back too.  

I can turn in a shorter curve with this build than with my spud 29. Sir if that may be due to the trucks, I couldn't say as I've only run the surfrodz on this deck, but it turns like a beast.

## \#48 Posted by: cwazy1 Posted at: 2017-10-31T03:49:56.832Z Reads: 350

```
IMO, its all relative. The evo deck, in **comparison to other regular decks** out there, steers more from the front than the rear, and that is just due to the way the angles align. You can probably influence it to steer more from the back by running looser setups, or by running softer/coned bushings, or just getting closer to the bushing blowout point.. 

Most of the opinions about this deck are going to be derived from down hill riders' feedback. They run totally different setup than most of us and I think in their case, its more noticeable in the way it handles.

I can dig that.  I just don't want people thinking it rides badly because all of the stead is in the front. There's more in the front than in the back but it's still very stearable. 

It might be a weird looking board but it rides like a muscle car.

Yeah for sure, I'm definitely not trying to say it rides bad, quite the opposite. I honestly love having a bit more front steer bias. I'm running 90A barrel bushings top and bottom on my rear truck and 90A bottom cone, 85A top cone bushings on my front truck. Makes for higher stability in the rear but still very turn-able.

Definitely! Mine isn't actually a landy evo. Its an Omen Chief that I just reshaped to be a bit less angular and more sleek. It has the same wedge angles, but different lengths and clearances. I actually had to print a 5 degree wedge for the rear to clear my TB motor mounts. So I'm running a 10 degree down wedge on the rear and the full 15 degree wedge on front. 

I got the deck from a friend and the board was used heavily in downhill racing around here. It was a bit beat up so I've been restoring it, filling holes that have been drilled, redressing the edges, etc. etc. 

Super excited to get it cleaned up and built.

...an update.

I installed the new enclosure this weekend, its a [19.5" Split Sym](https://psychotiller.com/product/195-split-system-enclosure) by @psychotiller.  Badass as always brother.

I used  3/8 weather stipping ([Frost King V25BK 3/8" X-Treme Rubber Weatherstrip Tape, Black @ $7.65](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FQ5A5RM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)) to seal the internals from debris.  Im sure its not water proof, but probably enough for the ocasional puddle and road gunk.

I opted to install the volt meter in the deck so I could see my voltage anytime.  I wanted to install it longways instead of sideways but there just wasn't enough room, the volt meter is about 3/16in deeper than the deck.  It still looks awesome and I can read it easily.

I've got around 50 miles on it, done a bit of off-roading as well.  I'm getting a solid 16 miles of range, but I'm staying in the throttle a lot too.  I hit 30mph with no problems, although I usually don't go faster than 22-24.  THis is by far the most fun I've had on a board to date.  Its a monster, tons of torque and lots of speed...just like my Charger in the pic :slight_smile:.

I may actually do some work on the wheel pulleys, I have them offset from the wheel because I didn't want to move the motor clamp to the absolute end of the hanger.  I have another set of pulleys on order, I may remove the offsets and extend the pulley width.

I've thought about adding a latching SPDT LED switch to the top of the deck as well, but not sure yet.  If I can ever find any lights that I really like I'll add some, but to be bright enough they are huge and I don't like that.  Maybe make them removable with a milled bracket? and recessed XT60 connector?

I extended the wheel pulleys by putting another module in the middle, waiting on longer pulleys and wider belts.  I moved the power switch to to the top of the deck using a 16mm SPDT LED switch with the @Namasaki method (+5v & Ground from the secondary VESC's receiver connection).

The 6in airless thane wheels are really is 90% as comfortable as the numies that come on the 6 shooters.  They don't have as much bounce but that is more than made up for by the grip.  TO be totally honest, the airless kinda suck in the grass, whereas the numies do pretty good.  On the street, I absolutely love them.  My kid has over 400 miles on his and it doesn't show other than road grime.

I'm not sure how I can measure efficiency other than running flywheels then numies then airless for a few rides using the same path and same conditions while collecting data.  Suggestions?

Ill see what I can do.  I probably wont be able to do the original numies for a while, had them in a bag I left while out of town.  Still waiting for them get shipped back to me.  Ill see if I can get my 97mm flywheels moved over this weekend and run a few miles then do the same on the 6in airless, bot on a full charge.

I finally got my 25mm HTD5M 15T motor pulleys...they have the wrong boar and the shaft is almost an inch long & no grub screw threaded holes.  TIme to go do some mill work.  

Anyways, I have 340-5M-25 5M timing belts and a set of HTD VersaPulleys that I pulled the middle section from and installed in the existing pulleys to make 26mm wide 60T wheel pulleys.  This should deliver some insane torque when its all done.

Ill post more when I get the pulleys modified and installed.

I think I'm just gonna tap holes for 8-32 grub screws and be done.  That way I can use blue loctite and the grub screws and it wont slip but I'll still be able to remove the pulleys easily.  I may go back and cut keyway slots but I doubt it will mater with the grub screws, especially since the motor shafts have flat facets on them.

Riptide 95.5a WFB, regular barrel boardside and tall barrel streetside.  Feels good.  Id like to replace the pivot cups when i get a chance.  The kingpin is a little oversized, so the tall barrel gives a ton of room for tweaking stiffness.

So I was driven to drink the single malt this weekend trying to get the 25mm belts installed.  I still don't know what the issue was.  The current belts I'm running are HTD5m 340-15 on 15T HTD5m 15mm pulleys.  The new belts are TD5m 340-25 on 15T HTD5m 27mm pulleys.  Nothing I did would get the damned belts on.  But my 15mm wide belts go on no problem.

I think I'm just gonna stick with 15mm belts and pulleys and call this done.

Finally got this resolved. Turns out the belts I received were actually 3.5mm smaller that spec.  Sent them back and ordered different belt and now all I'd good.  I also upgraded to 6374 190kv motors so I could use the 6354s on my kids street board.

I am now running 25mm 15t HTD5M motor pulleys and 345x25mm HTD5M belts.  I'm running pretty loose and no slip even know fast takeoffs and uphill.

I'm running a lot looser than previously, so it free rolls a lot better. The brakes and acceleration is perfectly linier now, there is no need to allow safety margins for belt slippage.

Doing some upgrades...

I got a new set of 6 shooters from @psychotiller, they are going on today.  I can't say enough about these wheels.  I've run MBS Rock Stars, MBS 7 in knobbies, Skikes, Evolve and I've ridden Trampas and nothing compares.  These are lighter and have more contact grip than anything else out there.

I got an enclosure from @bigben made specifically for the LY Evo deck, Looks great and the dry fit is perfect.  I'm going to remove it this weekend and do some paint work to finish it up, then remount and call this board done

...again...

until something else comes along that I wanna try :slight_smile:.

HOLY S$#T, I didn't expect such a decrease.  All I changed was airless wheels on 6 shooters to @psychotiller 6 shooters with stock numies. That's a 20'ish percent increase in drive time.

I figured I would post some about my bushing setup since its freaky strange and it was a topic of discussion yesterday, Both @Battosaii and @michichopf had some great insights.  

Initially I almost junked the LY Evo when I first built it cause it road ugly, lots of wobble and kida squishy.  After experimenting with different risers and bushings and loosening the trucks more than I'm generally comfortable with this is what I came up with.

Now it‚Äôs a frikking monster. It‚Äôs the only board I have that I‚Äôm semi-comfortable at 30+ mph.

_* all bushings are RipTide_ 
![IMG_20180125_182044_1516926780086|577x500](upload://oOy6YfnfvfjDd4ukwPIaTNn02Ey.jpg)

**WFB Barrel 93a (Red)  >>  front, road side** 
**KranK Street Barrel 93a (Maroon)  >>  front, board side**

**WFB TALL Barrel 95.5 (Green)  >>  rear, road side** 
**KranK Street Chubby 96a (Grey)  >>  rear, board side** 

Carving deep on an Evo, where you are in the middle.of trucks, not on top of them, leaves a bit to be desired when returning from the lean. Harder bushings roadside make the return more ‚Äòelastic‚Äô for lack of a better word.  To be clear, his isn‚Äôt science just my personal experience with this specific deck.  

@michichopf suggested chubby hourglass board side rear, I will eventually give that a try and see if its any better.

Zip ties through the cheese holes and around the hubs to stop rotation...real spikes for ice, but probably need 8" mudpluggers for freshies.

The rotation is most likely the temperature difference where the hub gets smaller than the PU wheel and wet of course
