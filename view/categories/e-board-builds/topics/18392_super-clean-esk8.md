Hi esk8 builders, once I answered a man that would buy this [Skateboard](http://www.instructables.com/id/Powerful-2000W-Electric-Longboard/), I said him that the board was nice, but after some minutes reading I noticed that the guy don't used a big size 6s battery, He used 12 1s lipo batteries, and put 6 of them in Series and 2 in parallel, so a 6s2p with 10Ah, Imagine this battery with a Bms, Hub Motor and a Vesc, it would be a M1 board

not sure what the question is.. but i'm over slim batteries.... unless you are going all out overkill with a integrated carbon fiber deck/enclosure it just complicates things...

the only real benefit is that it looks a bit nicer.... 
**cons** its actually huge. must have huge super stiff board. wiring is a pain. can't do swappable packs...
oh and it may actually be heavier since you need more surface area of material to cover them and all cells are exposed to impact...

and final side note. vesc. vesc. vesc..

True Story, but it looks more professional for me, and if you want slim batteries pack you always can buy at Alien Power

I think you may need to allocate more space for your electronics, especially if you plan to add a BMS. You're also going need an e-switch or loop key, if your BMS does not have one

You mean Vesc? You can buy at DIY electric skateboard, Enertion, Alien Power, But you can't use if your ERPM pass 60000, tell me your motor and your battery and I calculate for you

Nice, tell me, does this skate have power enough?

Yes, i think Bart himself even went like 42kmh with it, I'm 66kg and the board has plenty of power for me so I might even go somewhat faster. However im not that big of a speeddevil so I'll try to get the speed capped lower than the max speed, partly because i'm still unexperienced with skateing and partly because im a bit of a chicken :p .

Yeah after I made a hard fall while testing the speed and such luckily I decided: if i get into esk8 i better wear a helmet. Safed me from a big headache !

You mean as from stand still? For me if i push the board and get on it and pull the trigger I have to brace myself because if i dont the board will shoot out under me. If that is enough torque I dunno, dont know if the vesc will make a difference in torque either. However bart did advise me not start riding from a standstill.

Vesc can help you because you can set some configurations, but I think your motor have a high KV, It mean it can't climb a hill, I asked because I have a 300kv motor and I'm afraid of it don't have power

I have an SK3 50/65 with 6s 10000mah @ 25c

The brakes are really only what I'm interested in with the VESC, and the smooth power output. The boat ESC that he has in the photo, i have that one now and the brakes are practically non-existent.

But man, Vesc have a ERPM limit that is 60000, tell me your Battery and Motor specs and I calculate

Yeah good brakes we're my main motivation for getting the vesc aswell!

oh, If it is the 320kv motor, there will be ok using a VESC

Oh, so you can use the VESC

```
@IsTalo, you can still use the VESC if the max ERPM is over 60,000.  You just need to program the settings to limit it. That's what the "Max ERPM" and "Limit ERPM with negative torque" settings are for ;)

60k is the _suggested_ limit, not absolute maximum
