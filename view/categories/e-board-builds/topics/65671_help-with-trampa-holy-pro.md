Yesterday I got my order from @trampa.
While putting all things together i realize that the deck is very flexy...I orderd a 16ply holy pro and thought it would be more stiff with my 85kg.
Just to double check, does somebody know how thick the 16ply should be. Mine is exactly 10mm.

One more thing I realized, the area where the truck is mounted is not cut out like advertised.
Somebody know if it‚Äôs like this now and they just didn‚Äôt changed it on there homepage?

You might have received the hs11 deck which is now discontinued.

There are the holes in the deck. Only on the nose and tail the holes missing.
So i guess it‚Äôs not a hs11.

I had issues with them on my orders as well

1. Ordered normal HS11 16ply - received 2018 electric HS11 (with groove for cables in the middle)
2. Brought this issue up, and I decided to purchase ANOTHER HS11 16ply while I send the current electric HS11 back to UK for refund. The only reason is I don‚Äôt want to delay my build.
3. Received the replacement, correct model but they sent me 17ply
4. File a complaint to Ted, but they refused to admit their mistakes. Keep saying that they ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù my order for free.

For me is simple, mistake is a mistake. Just admit it, and continue business.

Will contact them too today. 
My problem, I want to start my build now and not in the winter (even if it will be built for cruising in the snow)
If I sent back the deck and after they will sent me right one it takes min 4-6weeks from Russia...

Me too, that sucks really.
Every order I need to clearify something after.
They already 3 times promised to sent me replacement inner tubes for the one which was already broken when received.
Till now they always forgot to add to my order, even when I noticed that when I placed the order.
It‚Äôs just small things but it shows the quality of there service.
I don‚Äôt give anything on there words anymore.
Let‚Äôs see how they will handle this problem this time...and than let‚Äôs see if i‚Äòll stay with trampa...they not the only producer...I like there decks and quality stuff, but like this it‚Äôs shit.

Mine also didnt come with the holes in the nose and tail, but i kind of knew it as Frank advertised it here one place. IMO it looks better without the cutouts :sweat_smile:

Their quality is second to none. Outstanding. Customer service has been fine for me but fulfillment is there issue.

Default Trampa order. And when you write to Ted, he always write in a way, so it sounds like it's your own fault. 

But i can understand why, the site is one big mess :-/

let¬¥s see what they will answer this time.
I agree, the side need some serious structure...
they have so much parts and options...
I remember when I just started I had big problems to understand, what part will fit to what...
now it¬¥s ok but still a mess

I‚Äôm not sure if there new design is better or worse. They removed all premise mountainboard and now make every board custom. Seems harder to figure out for newbies to their website.

Thickness is no indicator for the ply rating. The decks can vary a bit in thickness. 

The new Holy Pro Mountain board doesn't feature a hole in the nose for various reasons. 
This has something to do with future developments, compatibility and the option to mount the truck in different positions (further up or down the nose). 
We updated the entire line of HP decks and now offer decks specific for electric boards or non electric boards. The HS 11 is discontinued for the moment. 
I renamed all images today, so that the browser cash will not display old images any longer.

so this sticker which was on the board means.... board number 15 :thinking: 
![IMG_5563|640x480](upload://9K5EawnDtQgCCqVeCpg9oJcXVoc.jpg)

ok ok. 
strange that the deck flex even more than my 15ply street carve I had. Guess it also because of different shape?
Just try to understand what ply I really would need if I want a stiff board. 
For now, if I bounce in the middle of the deck with my 85kg the deck flex close to the ground. 
That¬¥s how it should be with 16ply?

Regards
Andy

On my board, there was a sticker very clearly indicating the PLY number. It was not handwritten.

@trampa : Hi Frank, are you going to remove holes in nose and tail of the electric holypro? maybe it would look better if mounted with infinity trucks that don't have holes in baseplates.

We are debating that at this very moment. THX for the input. Probably the hole will be eliminated in future. There are various arguments against it.
