I have this battery coming in the mail and I'm wondering if it would fit in the WowGo 6.4 LG enclosure which is metal. If not are there any waterproof boxes / enclosures that I can get on Amazon that are capable of housing this battery? I plan to load two of these batteries (or one) depending on space to the bottom of a loaded vanguard.

EDIT: it is a 10s3p 25r pack btw

Thanks!

You'll never find a flex case it's decently rigid but works for me pic attached next to my battery![IMG_20190602_145343|666x500](upload://nIPlFN3TwgGwt0gilvulJlsJyXB.jpeg)
