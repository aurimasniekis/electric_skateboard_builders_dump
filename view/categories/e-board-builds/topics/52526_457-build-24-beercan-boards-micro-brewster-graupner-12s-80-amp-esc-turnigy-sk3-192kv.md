I originally had it with a VESC and a 3 * 4S Lipos,
 but when I switched to the 80 Amp Graupner ESC, 
I cut back to  2 * 4S Lipos.

What’s it ride like? How’s the brakes and throttle curve on that ecs?

With the 12S it was a bit overpowered for such a small board.
I kicked the trucks all the way to the ends,
 so I have fairly long wheelbase about 19",  it is stable. 
The Graupner ESC is really nice.
The brakes and throttle are very smooth, 
I bought the programming box to tune it, 
but the defaults work very well for me. 
All I did was set it to "car". 
The ESC can be set for airplane, boat, helicopter or car.

The brakes are proportional, you can set them from 0-100%, 
the throttle is super smooth, I have owned five Vescs and I 
prefer the graupner.
