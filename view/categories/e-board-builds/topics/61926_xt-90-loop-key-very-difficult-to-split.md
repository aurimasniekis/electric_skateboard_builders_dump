Hi everyone,

I'm making a loop key for my lipo setup and I'm finding the key is really stiff and difficult to remove. It doesn't just alot into place, you have to put some serious force behind it in order to separate the two.

Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do to combat it?

Thanks,
Daniel

After u break it in, it gets easy... I use my board daily and after about 2 weeks it goes in just fine... Mine is also epoxied into a case so you only have to pull the loop side

put A LITTLE bit of vaseline on the outside so it slides easier

I take needle nose pliers and squeeze the male side of the xt90. a little goes a long way: they will still be secure, but slide in and out a lot more easily :slight_smile:

The problem on mine was that the hole was sightly too small on the box so the female end was squeezed, causing extra pressure.

Sometimes models shrink, just scale it up 1 or 2 percent.

I had never seen your design before. I was talking about the hole in my actual box being too small causing there to be extra friction on the loop key.

Nope I use fiberglass... I don't like printed enclosures or kydex cases personally...
