Hi everyone! I recommend here to do this build! I am quite sure that all of my parts work together and output good performances. I've been riding longboards for some time now, so I'm sure this build can hit a max of ~20mph and at least 10 miles range.

I live a mostly flat and smooth area, so I shouldn't need a lot of torque (hence the single motor).

I have those same 15mm width/3mm pitch pulleys,how are you getting on with them? Any issues with the belts skipping or stripping? I'll be running a dual so less stress and evens the load out but just wanted to see what your experience was like thus far!
