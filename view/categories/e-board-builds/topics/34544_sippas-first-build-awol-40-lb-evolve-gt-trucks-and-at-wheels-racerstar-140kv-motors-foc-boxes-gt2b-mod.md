Hey,

Sippa here in Brisbane Australia, been reading a lot of info on esk8 builds, wanting to build my first. Only purchased a deck so far, AWOL deck, aussie mob.

http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/AWOL-LONGBOARD-SKATEBOARD-DECK-9-5-x-40-FREE-GRIP-TAPE-8-PLY-SKATE-4-/262805471226?hash=item3d306d3ffa:g:-1MAAOSw9GhYeBfY

Looking to use Evolves GT Trucks, AT Wheels and wheel pulleys and their motor mounts, seems like a pretty good solution

https://www.evolveskateboards.com.au/products/gt-at-kit?variant=28314759945
https://www.evolveskateboards.com.au/products/gt-front-truck
https://www.evolveskateboards.com.au/products/gt-rear-truck

I like the look of these Turnigy D5035-125KV motors in duel setup, they appear physically larger than their name suggests so if anyone can enlighten me, you can see HK website address lists them as DT6376 motors???

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/dt6376-14p-sensored-motor-125kv.html

Will use 2* DIYelectric v4.12 VESC

Will piece together 6 of these for 12S 10Ah battery solution

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-5000mah-4s1p-14-8v-20c-hardcase-pack.html

I haven't decided what remote to get yet but I will be piecing this all together over the next 3 months or so. Let me know what you all think? should be pretty reliable I would of thought.

Cheers

Sippa

Esk8 Calc, I think this is a good place to start, 35km/h will be plenty for a start. Will pick up a few motor pulleys for different combinations later on once I get a feel for it.

Evolve trucks and mounts tuned up today, will probably have to modify the mounts as they are 38mm mount spacing and the motors I was thinking are 44mm. I will sort that out in time.

Hey sippa good to see another builder here in Brisbane :slight_smile: 
Banggood have some motors which fit those evolve mounts straight up. Sensored and come in 140kv or 200kv. Like $50 each as well. If you decide you want a 18650 pack built drop me a pm.

Hey bud,

Yeah I have been looking at the easy bolt up option, Was thinking I might need more torque though if I want to take it golfing? What you reckon? 

Having looked at the mounts I don't think it would be too difficult to get an adapter plate made to fit different mount configuration motors.

```
There's a 140kv option as well but if you're going to be using this for golf just change gearing, if you need to.
A lot depends on the speed controller you are going to use as to how much current it can pump out. Will you be using vesc's?

This calculator will give you speeds at different gear ratios.

```
Because the Speed you have gotten is the top speed of the board when it is half charged. 44.4v is the voltage of the battery at about 50-60%. When the battery is at 100% it will have a high voltage and thus a higher top speed.
```

## \#17 Posted by: Jebe Posted at: 2017-10-10T21:30:47.622Z Reads: 229

```
then you won't have any torque issues with those motors. Can always change gearing if you need to. Using the ackmaniac firmware and running vescs in watt mode helps keep the power i.e. speed more uniform throughout your ride. pat is right, 44.4 volts is the nominal voltage at 3.6 volts per cell. we charge them to 4.2 volts per cell therefore higher speed at the start of your run. Unless you use watt mode. which is awesome and you can use the ackmaniac app for realtime data and mode switching. Am running 2 of those banggood 200kv motors - sensored FOC watt mode, So quiet and responsive.

Yeah thinking about it I think I will use the 140kv motors, that way it will be easy install and everything play nice as essentially its all evolve running gear, for this build anyway :slight_smile:

I ordered some 12t motor pulleys last night so I will have that option when I get everything else together.

Banggood also sells a pulley made for that motor. It's aluminum, but works well. I've had no problems. The shaft is D shaped, without a keyway, so this may be easier than modding the shaft.

Yeah will use that pulley. 

At first I think I will just drag the bag and cart around by hand behind but will look at hitching something removable on the back of the deck to tow the bag and cart. 

I will need a park brake too, I'm not sure if you can have an electric park brake through the motor controller? or I need to jig some physical brake incorporated into the hitch attachment I can just use a foot to lock on or off when I need to move.

You might be able to use a brake light for a drone depending on the remote you are using. If it has a 2nd channel you might be able to rig that up so it will turn on the brake light, there was a thread on this but I can't remember what it was called

Ok I though you would have had to have a pretty strong brake so the board doesn't get pulled down the hill by the weight of the bag and cart although you said you haven't done that yet but it might be better to kinda over engineer it so then if you do it won't be pulled by the cart

Not a lot of force is need to hold it at a stationary position if you are already stationary even on the steepest hills, bag and cart be no more than 20kg but like you said I haven't got to the practical testing of any ideas for it yet and won't for some time,

No I do not want to argue. I was trying to help you to solve an issue that you might have trouble with. The last thing I would say you could do is put a rubber band on the remote and wrap it around the remote trigger so it pulls it to full brake when you want to. I will stop posting now as my help is not wanted, good day and good luck with your board

This thread is like Dominos 😂..

Chuck the pull cart in the pond and carry your bag like a normal person. 
Turn remote off just as you come to a stop, the brakes will hold it.
Take bag off shoulder
Grab club
Rest bag on board or chuck it on the grass.
Whack it (the ball)
Turn remote on
Put club away
Ride


Looking good!

Check the motor pulley first. If it’s not that, it’s the motor. When I used these on my build, after 100 miles mine started doing a clicking noise (not loud) but only when spinning without load. I showed a video to Banggood and they shipped me a replacement straight away.

Im not suprised, the motor pulley is only held on by m3 grub screw in the pulley, I wanted to try a few pulleys before a more permanent fixture to the shaft.

I rode it around yesterday for about an hour, my first skateboard so i dont really have experience to give you feed back on what the deck is like. Its flexy though and with the evolve trucks seems pretty sensative to input. 

My 8s battery is had it already. Bad cell in one broke a cell in the other so won't be using it anymore. Will have to get the 12s wired up

Got the 12s wired up today. Took it for a short circuit of the neighborhood. Its scary at the moment :joy: can putt around but a little slip of the thumb on the nano x and could easily go horizontal. I will have to tweek the current settings.

Its running sensored foc so with some subtle precision movements on the remote and i can crawl away from a dead stop with ease.

So I could play around with settings for forever and a day but if any of you with experience on setting up dual vescs on sensored foc could give me some input that be great? Specifically <egzplicit as you have alot of the same gear.

Have current settings at 40, -40, 25, -12. Seems pretty good at that, more than I can use at this stage.

Did a circuit around my local streets tonight and did some sums on range. Approx. 26km i calculated for 4.15v to 3.5v per cell. Does that sound about par for a lipo 12s pack at 10amp hour 30C?

Yeah that would be about right for a pnuematic setup, your averaging 17Wh/km which is quite good. With street wheels you would get close to 40km

Yeah my print turned up, thought it came out pretty good, a little clean up but I think it will do just fine.

I will have to use some Sugru to seal up some gaps around the aluminium enclosure and I'm using neoprene tape as a gasket against the board. 

Won't be water proof, but certainly water resistant and splash proof.

Hi all, been a busy 2018 and I never spent enough time finishing off this build last year.

Had some holidays so was able to get the enclosures onto the board and have it up and running.

Have made a slide on the lid to house the xt90 anti spark connector. Works well!

Use a piece of braided fuel line to run power to the controllers. Keeps it flexable

Batteries secured by velcro. 

The battery enclosure was a terrible print. I had to clean it up and glue on some repair peices so i wasn't very happy with that so i will buy a 3d printer and do good one later on. This will do for now.

Cheers
