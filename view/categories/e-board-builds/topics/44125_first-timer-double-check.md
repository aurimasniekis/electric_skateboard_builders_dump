**2x Ebay alarmhookup 10s2p Pack**
The LG cells are pictured but I'll be using the high drain Sona cell packs
Does anyone know how the BMS's are on these? I'm planning to charge them in parallel with a 42V hoverboard-style charger.

**Ebay 150A Watt/Amp Meter**
Using this to measure current going to ESC and when I charge, current going into the battery pack

I wouldn't permanently wire the wattmeter to the board. Just use it for testing.  Or get one of the $20 BT modules and you get the same information and it's much smaller.

Also just to make sure, it's ok to plug the phase wires in any order as long as it's running unsensored?

Answered my own question by reading. Yes is the answer.

Those look awesome, but I’m not sure how it would work with my setup as I’m not using a vesc.
