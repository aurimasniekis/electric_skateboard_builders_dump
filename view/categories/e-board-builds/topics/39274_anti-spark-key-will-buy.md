Hello guys. I tried to solder 12awg + xt90 with 30w and fat tip but it didn't work.  Even my friend, who is professional electrician, couldn't do it.we used 60/40 solder, flux and tinned the tip and wire. But it took too long to heat the wire and connector. I researched a bit and came to conclusion that >80w iron is needed. So is this http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/391864441800 sufficient? Thanx

Lol it'll do it but it won't be pretty or likely work long before burning out
For added safety, fuse the key with a maxifuse or something similar
