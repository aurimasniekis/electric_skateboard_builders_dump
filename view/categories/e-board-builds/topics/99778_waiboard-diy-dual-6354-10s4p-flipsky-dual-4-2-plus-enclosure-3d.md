These are some of the bras (I call them ribs), which support the enclosure of the VESC and the enclosure of the battery.

The time it took to print the VESC enclosure with 100% infill

Is there a reason you didnt print the ribs flipped 180 so that you wouldn't have needed so much support material?

I printed them both ways, first face down and as I did not like the finish that was achieved on the sides I decided to print them as seen in the photos. They took many more hours, but resolution is something I like to take care of. :nerd_face:

More parts finished!
Enclosure for the battery and enclosure for the VESCs ready!

My version of riser is also ready to order the motor cables to the VESCs, which in turn has a built-in bash guard for easy replacement when it wears out.
