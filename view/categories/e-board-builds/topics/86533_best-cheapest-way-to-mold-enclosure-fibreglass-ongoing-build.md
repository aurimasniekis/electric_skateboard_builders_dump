_This is my second electric skateboard build._
Going to build two short deck (but comfy) electric skateboards. Its going to be a hub motor build with a 10s2p battery. I want as snug and small enclosure as possible and therefore i have to do it myself, this is a prototype that maches the sizes of the ESC and battery:

_Size: 30 cm * 10 cm_ 

Using the following deck (82 cm):

**So the question remains, how to make a tailored enclosure? i was thinking of using fibreglass and harderner (basically what boats and car bumpers are made of). I saw this dude on youtube do it and it seemed like the obious easy/cheap way to do it. Do you agree or do you recommend any other way of toing it? (dont have a 3d printer or plastic mold)**

Yeah you can cover the bottom of the deck with a sheet and then place an object with the dimensions of your enclosure (like wood) on it, then add the fiberglass with epoxy or resin so the fiberglass all gets wet and then stick it in a vaccuum bag so the enclosure gets compressed nicely

Looks like they’re too big and will bottom out.  Shouldn’t need be that big for such a small battery.  Need a bigger battery.  Why not make it longer.

Get yourself some kydex, thermo molding abs, and bake it in the oven at around 220 f at a thickness around 3/16". It gets really soft so you can make all sorts of custom curves and can be fine tuned with a heat gun and a small putty knife. You will need to cut out a negative of the enclosures to push the whole piece down evenly. Firmly secure your enclosure shaped object to your deck to make sure you get a nice mating edge. Also, wear protective gloves cuz dis shit is hawt! It is a

Hummie is right, unless youre using risers out the wazoo, youre going to be scraping your enclosure on the ground when going over varying terrain

The enclosure I have from @Eboosted is roughly 23mm deep I believe, perfect for my single stack battery, as well as the protective measures to hold the battery in place.

e: just saw you have the 10s2p, likely from a hub motor build previous. Thats going to be a double stack, so 45mm should be cash money for plenty of space for your battery, and not enough space for everything to jostle around :)

Heres a snip from the DIYEBOARD (DONT GO HERE) website, showing that their 10s5p enclosures height is 60mm . ![image|597x434](upload://nNsunZRjC8dvgzzNOjablUj8LEe.jpeg) 

This height of this enclosure is the real killer. Ive read about a few people who scrape the ground as they ride with it. IME, with a Landyachtz Evo 40inch, not mounted drop through, the enclosure would scrape like a motherf-er

Im rambling, mostly because I dont want to do my homework, but hopefully some of it is useful to ya :)
