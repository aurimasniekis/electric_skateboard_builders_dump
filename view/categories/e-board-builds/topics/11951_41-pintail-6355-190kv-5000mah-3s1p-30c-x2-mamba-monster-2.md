**BUILD PROCESS**
I mounted the Drok DC8 Volt Meter in the Elephant 008 case using a dremel and the supplied screws.  THis may be my favorite mod of an electric skateboard.  On the next build I want to build it into the top of the deck for easier reading.

I followed the directions [here](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=71922) for the GT2B enclosure mod, pretty simple once I figure out fit.  I had to a little dremel work on the enclosure to get the trigger to slide without sticking, but less than an hours work from start to finish.

My motor mount is junk, cheap 5055 aluminum mount from eBay.  I am working on a new mount using 6061 aluminum and a mill, will take a little time though as I am still trying to figure out the mill.  

I am planning on replacing the trucks as well, just not sure if I want to use Paris V2's or Caliber II's.  I really like the Paris trucks, used them for years when I skated as a kid.  I like the look of the Calibers but Ive never seen a set in real life so I'm still on the fence.

I bought a 9mm belt, shouldn't have done that, 12mm is much beefier.  I'm going to order a couple this weekend.

Overall, I am pleased with this build.  It's much torquier than the 5055 280kv motor I used before, I love the GT2B remote trigger travel, the deck is retro and has a great concave and the length means I can just chill and not worry too much about wobble.

Very nice build given how little money you spent! I also like how you use that breaker as a switch.

You get so lucky with the shipping on ebay. I've considered buying one of those moose decks, but the shipping + taxes doubles its price. Im located in the EU. 

And how did you buy that mount for 10$ incl shipping? For me its listed as $46.50 incl shipping.

The breaker is pretty cool, I like it anyways.  The mount is a copy of a chinese mount I bought on eBay awhile back.  I drew it in Soldworks and then had a friend mill it.  I just put $10.00 because I bought him a 6-pack to make it for me :).

But its crap for this build, way too thin for a for a 6355 motor.  I don't expect it too last longer than a couple of weeks.

Thanks.  I am a fan of pintails, me being old as crap and all that :).  

I really like this board in particular, great concave, stiff (not squishy), the grip is surprisingly good too.  I figure I will have to sand it down and replace it with tape eventually but after 3 days of riding it show absolutely no wear.
