Hi! Just wanted to share my newest build. I'm upgrading my current board to a dual, so I had some parts left over from that. I really wanted a compact board I could carry with me home on the weekends, so that's why it's a small 22" deck. 

_**My parts:**_ 
**Motor:** Turnigy SK3 168kv
**ESC:** esk8.de VESC
**Battery**: 10s (2x 5s) Turnigy LiPo 5Ah
**Motor mount:** Enertion Mount
**Gearing:** 15/36T 12mm belt
**Wheels:** Black flywheel clones
**Trucks:** Painted Enertion trucks
**Remote:** Winning remote (still waiting for dat Nano-X doe)
**Deck:** Generic mini-longboard style deck
**Enclosure:** @Dunkirk ABS enclosure 

Since most of the parts is from my old build ([The iBoard](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-iboard-loaded-vanguard-sk3-6382-168kv-10s-lipo-vesc-esc-83-mm-enertion-powerwheels/3341)) the building process was fairly easy.

**_Stuff I need to do:_**
<del>* Add grip tape</del>
* Smart charging solution
<del>* Cutout for button</del>

Yea! I really like the size. My Vanguard 38" is still a lot more comfortable to ride though, but this is just so damn easy to carry!

Yeah, took it out for a spin earlier today. Feels great! My 38" Vanguard is softer and smoother to ride though. But this is just perfect for small commutes! :D

Now I only need a solution for charging with loop-key of some sort.. I already have a balance charger, just not capable of 10S...

Looks really cool! :sunglasses: How is the stability at high speed? What bushings you running?

It's quite good, even when the trucks aren't tightened very much. Since the trucks are the standard Enertion caliber clones, it's also the stock bushings. They're quite noisy though, so I might change them soon.
