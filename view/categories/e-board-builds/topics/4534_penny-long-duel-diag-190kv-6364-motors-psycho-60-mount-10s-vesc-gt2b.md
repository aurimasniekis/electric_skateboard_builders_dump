Hey guys, doing my first build. I wanted some feedback, and I have a few questions. I'd appreciate the help.
I have a penny longboard I'm looking to upgrade, and I'm a pretty big dude. Here's what I'm thinking:

[FINAL CONFIGURATION]

2x Motors (dual DIAG. drive config)
HK sk3 6364 190kv
-I'm gonna use the dremel to make flat spots for the grub screw 

2x ESC
VESC

2x Batteries
5S 5000mah Turnigy

Other stuff -Pulleys from enertion, Belts from Vbelt supply because of Psycho mounts. I also replaced the stock trucks and wheels to allow me to use the mounts and pulleys. I will also be using a gt2b remote because of reliability planning on changing enclosure later on to mad munkey by FLATLINEcustoms)

Im doing a similarly small 20" build, only thing i can recommend with my experience is to drill new holes for your trucks and move them as close to the edge as you can to make room for more powerful components, should you need them. Im currently able to squeeze 3 4s batteries and a 63mm motor between my wheels, moment of truth with be when the vesc arrives

```
I have 2 of Diy's 6355 motors with dual voltage option of 12s or 6s
I'm 190 lbs and I can climb hills with either voltage although 12s does it with a lot more authority and speed.
I mainly have the 6s option for cruising crowded boardwalks. Top speed with 6s and these motors and 14/36 gears is about 15mph on flat ground. Top speed with 12s is about 25mph
Note: if your going to run lower voltage like 6s, definitely go with the higher KV motors.
The higher the KV the higher top speed.

sorry, I forgot to specify. It's a 36" board. The panney longboard isn't the most well known penny, but I really like the deck.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7fba1d542caf218ab75bbb41995ed2bd152178c9.png" width="277" height="367">

Looks awesome! 36 inches is plenty of space to work with. I would just make sure you have enough ground clearance with those wheels, you can get some cheap 90mm flywheel clones for like, $30 or less on ebay, plus my local skate shop sold me half inch risers for $4. Im sure the penny isnt very flexible, but the more clearance the better. I have 90mm wheels and half inch risers and personally love the ride height and the sorta goofy look. Certainly not as sexy as a lower ride, but i love it

Diy also sells a 12s Esc that is very dependable and high performance
Many builders on this forum use the Vesc but they are more complicated and easily burned up so I would recomend Diy's 12s opto Esc for first time builder.

That's it. It is a little pricey but it's very durable and with proper settings, it works very well. 
For high voltage setup, this or Vesc are the main options.

Like already mentioned you will need different trucks and a drive system. Pulleys, mounts, and belts .You could also consider going with a package deal from . He's got dual drive packages and complete kits that you might want to look at. If you are in the US. I'd hit him up and see if he can't get you set up. A lot of the time you can get him on live chat on his website.

Thanks a bunch for the tip, but i just bought caliber trucks and wheels with spokes to work with enertions stuff for $45. I found one of the kits you mentioned for dual drive, buying the parts seperately came out about $50 cheaper. I think for my next build Im gonna buy a kit though because it's a lot of research.

you'll sacrifice the structural integrity of the axle, making it wayyy more susceptible to bending and warping. for $12 you can get one of these http://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/abec-wheel-adaptor though I don't think the ABS plastic will last too long. I'd buy one of these to tie you over till you find a better solution that doesn't involve destructively screwing with your trucks. Knowing how progressive enertion is and how hungry they are to be at the forefront of the diy market, I wouldn't be surprised to see his injection modeled pulley come in a washer/bolt configuration by the end of the year to meet both the demand for quality and longevity. Check on thingverse for abec pulley stl files and check around for local printing shops, there are several models just like enertions except with screws and no bearing, and is where I think miami eboards got their design. I'm trying to find someone to print one for me in nylon till I find an aluminum one with the right gearing/price.

Dude that is total BS. just because you remove like 1cm from the axle you will not make it "wayyy more susceptible to bending". Just because you hold a grudge against enertion stop from giving false information to people.
@ed713 don't believe him - the enertion pulley is well tested and a lot of people use it.

There is as well nice pulleys from http://alienpowersystem.com/product-category/cnc-kit/transmission-parts/ but they are just way too $$$

dude we don't even know if that material is there to keep it from bending. They could stop covering the inner steel axle with aluminium but maybe choose not to because of design or manufacture reasons.
It is not like you remove half of the axles aluminium - we are talking about the width of a bearing.
As long as you can not prove me otherwise you are stating false information. Stop this. At least say "you think" that this might be a problem and don't state it like a fact!

I was planning on taking that very "thing" to the 3D printer down the road from me, their communication kinda blows though and I'm not sure what options I have regarding materials. It'd be nice if someone could sketch up a 12mm one, I feel like 15mm is gonna be too big for my trucks. For now I think I'm just gonna order the 36T aluminum pulley from diyelectricskateboards, though I feel like I can find it somewhere for under $30.

same goes for you! You don't know that it doesn't make it more susceptible, and we'll never know till it happens to somebody who did it right. Just because it hasn't been a problem yet doesn't mean it could eventually be, and the extra precaution is worth noting, since it could mean having to buy a new truck and also a new pulley if the enertion pulley ends up being an issue.

All the evidence right now tells us that you are wrong. No enertion customer has shown up with bent axles (the original enertion trucks should have the same "problem" you are talking about). No raptor customer has shown up with a story about a bent axle. Until you have actual evidence of a problem you can not just assume there is one. Right now you are the one that has to prove me wrong not the other way around. I can not do anything besides showing you that people do ride them without problems - what else do you need.

I never said it bends the axle, I said it makes it more susceptible to bending. and like i said, just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean and can't eventually be a problem after a year or so, and that it is a precaution worth noting especially while there are other options available in the same price point.

you are grasping at straws here. I know you don't like enertion but you don't have to try to find something wrong with their product just for the sake of it. Everybody on this forum tells you that it is not a problem to modify the trucks - you just don't want to believe them. @longhairedboy does this all the time and can tell you first hand how it is not a problem - otherwise he would not do it.
When you try to educate people you have to at least tell them that you "think" it could be a problem but that there is no actual prove of it yet.

Thanks for all the input guys. I think I'm gonna make a 10s System, and wait a bit to see if the diy motor comes back in stock. For the ESC, I'm going to buy the platinum VESC because it has a 1 yr replacement (to address the possibility of it failing).

As for the trucks, I appreciate the warning on being careful not to break them. I will be sure to proceed with caution.

Feeling pretty confident about the build now, and I'm really excited. I kind of wish a would have bought the vesc's first so I didn't have to wait as long for it to ship. Jason's stock post estimates shipping at around mid-July, and I guess I can live with that :)

Now the biggest dilemma I have is where to put each motor. I'm thinking heel side for rear motor and toe side for front motor.

The penny deck has the channel on the bottom, and my batteries fit well there. I can't wait to post some pics of the finished build. Thanks for all the help guys.

Im pretty sure this time he's for real about shipping dates, however you may be in a later batch and could have a huge line ahead of you. Chaka vescs from ollin boards is always an option, about a 3 week period from order to arrival at your door, plus its hand made and supposedly way over engineered in a good way.

Thanks for the suggestion, I've been hearing good things about chaka's vesc. I'm working this build into a bit of a tight budget and the extra $60 I would have to pay to get two ollinboard vescs are too much. I also figure it saves me a bit on enertion shipping because I also got the pulleys from there. I'm gonna have to stick with the enertion vescs.
My order # is in the 4300's, and it may very well take some time to recieve my order. I am hopeful, and I dont really need my eboard until august. I'm gonna try to wait it out, but thanks for the tip. I think I'll use that vesc for my second build, assuming this one goes well :sweat_smile:.

I got my VESCs yesterday, and have been spending today soldering everything.

However, I can't get motor detection to work.I have looked at a lot of posts on the forum. I don't have a lab power supply, so I tried to use one of my 5s lipos for motor detection. Is it not working because of the lipo?

I keep getting "bad detection result recieved". I have left most of the values default, and no fault codes have occurred. When I run the detection the motor spins up and then does a slow spin, just like in the videos I've seen. The only difference is that I feel the initial spin lasts longer than in the videos.

I'd really appreciate any help.

How about upping the amperage? They might need more current to get them going.

Try upping the below values gradually until you hit the max:

Current: 6A max
Min RPM: 1200 max
Low duty: .1 max

Also, Vedder's motor detection vid might help

I got it!

I tried fiddling with the values, and still didn't work. After watching the video like 10 more times I decided to try reflashing the firmware, and it finally worked.

I think that what went wrong for me is the fact that I had changed the battery info from default. I think that running the motor detection out of the box would have prevented the failed motor detections.

So I think something went wrong with the VESCs :frowning:

 I couldn't locate the grub screws for the motor pullys, so I tested the board without them and it worked fine. I decided to put the board on the floor and it moved forward okay without the grub screw, so I gave it more throttle and the motor pully started slipping. I then stopped the board and gave it a bit of throttle, but only one motor was spinning.

I checked the VESCs with the BLDC tool, the main one did not show the indicator light at all when plugged into power, but the receiver for my remote still powered on. I then checked the other VESC (slave), and it powered on and connected, but soon after it disconnects. I can view realtime data for the time it is connected, but I don't see any fault codes even when spinning the motor with my arrow key.

I have just sent an email to enertion support. I'm hoping its covered through the warranty, but I've never been lucky enough for things to be covered. Does anybody have any suggestions? I'm not sure how to get them repaired, and I don't have nearly enough confidence in my ability to do it myself.

In case anybody is following along.
I heard back from enertion support. I'm pretty sure Jacobbly responded to me because the response was from Jacob. I thought that was cool.
He advised me to send the VESCs back to Texas, and they are currently in route.
I can't say for sure because I didn't notice it, but I think they may have had the problem Jason posted about today. Hopefully I'll get an update soon as to what went wrong and then post the info here.
