Impulse bought this bad boy for $25 at a thrift store in Brooklyn. It runs, but barely. I figure I could drop a hoverboard battery in and get it choochin' in no time. Thoughts?

Definitely!

I've got one of those, It gets a reasonable top speed.

Don't over-volt that thing unless you upgrade the ESC, it'll fry its self otherwise.

If I remember correctly, it's got a 24V battery using lead acid. Motor is a plain DC brushed motor.

You do remember correctly. The battery spec (2x 7ah 12v lead acid in series) is written on the side
