As the title states, I'm tired of close calls. Riding in and around NYC is dangerous and I have barely avoided severe injury several times. I love boarding and even kicking but this just isn't the place for me. So, I am going to build an off road electric scooter. This will be fun as I live in an apartment with no access to a welder, saws, or a grinder. Going to see what I can do with a dremel and basic hand tools. 

Specs so far:
10s2p 10ah 150/300C lipo pack
BatteryTech BMS 
FOCBOX 
200x50mm MBS Pneumatics 
Kaly NYC 190kv 6374

I think the 190kv may be to high so I will probably get a lower Kv and possibly larger size. I haven't completely decided on how this build will go but I will certainly have a hand brake in the front. I will either adapt the rear wheel for a sprocket or adapt the scooter frame to mount on a skate truck and use dual drive!

This is my base platform I believe, that may change.

I ride in Chicago with my mountain board and it can be very dangerous riding downtown.. which is why my commuter is a boosted board style board

190kv is just about perfect for 10s. Just get the correct gearing, and it'll be fine. Might want to look into adding some kind of cooling fan/impeller to the motor just to make sure it runs cool.

Even when I was riding without bindings I hated bailing at 20mph. I believe this will be a fun alternative as well as a bit more safe and a lot more brakes!

The only issue with the 190 is the rear wheel may be a 12" pneumatic. That's a bit of resistance but then again I'll be kicking off. I may adapt the rear of the scooter to bolt to a 218mm truck and run dual 6374 like on my MTB.

Can I recommend a different option? Rather than go sprocket, do a BLDC hub motor for scooters they are very very common and you can get them up to 1600-2000W.  My motor is rated for 1600W but my battery pack utilizes a lot less -- I think only up to 600W.

If you do the 6374 and sprocket you will have this motor hanging out the side... it doesn't look good on a scooter. On eboard they tuck underneath or in line with the width of the board.

I get 35-37 mph top speed and about 35-40 miles distance per charge.  I also have (2) Trampa boards a carver and MTB. But for my daily commuter, I ride the scooter especially with backpack and I can't wear full body armor when I go to work in the morning.

I paid about $630 for it. It's called a Speedway 4 (rebranded as Futecher now)

FYI -- here is a picture of it and the hub motor:

Here is like a 1000W hub motor you could get:

One thing to keep in mind, in NYC, ebikes and escooters are illegal and can be confiscated. Esk8 is more of a grey area since it doesn't exactly fall under any law.

You might look at this scooter instead, it has 200x50mm wheels so MBS wheels should pop right in.

You can build around a Frinction drive @ the rear, no gearing nothing. dead simple no mechanical failiure. u can also swap out the motor very easy. I saw some people using it. they just wrap around motor a 40 grit sand paper.

only down side is no more regen brake, unless u build spring mount to tension it all the time

I really want to get this going but there are so many freakin obstacles. Hub motor is not an option at $225. I believe I may buy a scooter like @mmaner posted and simply use only the steering assembly. This would beep dual rear drive as well as having a hand brake on the front.

This is the only portion of a scooter that I need. Anyone have one laying around?

Oh it's a boy scooter (Love the kickstand!)

@flywithgriff don't give up, it's do-able! I'm feeling a lot safer now. Very few almost-died moments now. Mornings I'm bombing down Broadway, afternoons up 6th.

- After switching (for the moment) to dual 6355 belt, with A123 pack, plenty of brakes now.

- top speed 30mph I can ride with cars, which ironically feels a LOT safer. I try to shadow a car, so other cars which don't see me don't try to be where I am. From my crash I learned to always be aware of what's around me, to the sides and rear, so my head is on a swivel.

- riding with cars, there's a lot fewer things popping into my travel path as there was when I rode in bike lanes or along the parked cars.

- if not riding in car lanes, ride slow and be very vigilant

- I got dropouts with gt2b, it takes like a whole second to reconnect. mini remote gets dropouts but reconnects very fast

If you give up though sell me more parts ;)

PS there's at least one person that tried disc brakes, right? Regen braking seems sketch, so idiosyncratic. It's nice to have redundancy.

Not that a scooter or a skateboard is a car, but after 20 odd years of riding motorbikes. You need to own the road not the gutter... the dirty edge of the road is dangerous for all kinds of reasons. That said pushing your board down a freeway is suicide :head_bandage:

I directly connect the 3 pins in the ADC port of the vesc (just weld the wire to the good connector.

1st I take a right thumb, then I order a left one that I set in reverse (more like jetski gas, than quad gas)
