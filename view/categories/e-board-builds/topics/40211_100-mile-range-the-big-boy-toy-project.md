So I have been hard at work building my new 100 mile electric skateboard, it's time for a build thread!

With the help from sponsors, Hobbyking, Avenue Trucks, Riptide bushings and Helter Skelter Hybrids I'm slowly putting together the pieces. During all this progress, I have been training and riding my 50 mile setup and burning through belts commuting to work over 20+ miles a day, but this thread isn't about that, let's look at what I have cooking in the kitchen cus it's all about the nerdy gear, right?

I took everything I learned from the 50 mile board and laid out the largest and heaviest electric skateboard this world has seen yet. Like all skateboards I started with the deck, and that's where Brian from Helter Skelter Hybrids comes in. Brian has been building world class downhill skateboards for racing for a long time. He handcrafts each one to custom specs and to the rider.

An example of his work

 I discovered Brian a few years ago when I wanted a nice downhill deck, it's nice to have a local guy close by who knows what he's doing. Brian isn't an electric skateboard builder, he's a skateboard builder and can build a skateboard for any use. We talked for a while over some beers, I explained what I needed and his brain raced with ideas, he is obviously the right man for the job.

Brian invited me along for the build, even to pick out the wood for the core, a Baltic Birch on the road-side and a Walnut on the ride-side, both from from http://www.hugheshardwoods.com/ a local supplier.

Brian and the dudes from Hughs cut the expensive sheets down to size for the skateboard press.

I choose the grain for the top and he laid it up in the skateboard press with fiberglass in between the layers for added strength.

Pressed using a mold and some custom blocks, I wanted it to be flat in the rear with a wide and mild concave for my front foot so I still had good control.

A few days later and this popped out

I laid out all the batteries I think I need, 15 total 4.400mah 36v packs (still waiting on some in the mail) to find the total size of the deck and the wheelbase.

We decided on the functional and popular bottle-nose for the front and I drew a cool split in the tail, for some California surf style in the tail

I wanted some wheel wells and a flat spot to mount the batteries so this week he routed out the bottom and started on the 1st layers of clear glass on top.

The top with it's 1st layer of glass, it's beautiful!

While all that has been going on, I've also been working with Paul from Avenue Trucks. As you might already know I'm rocking some cool prototype suspension trucks we modded and adapted for electric skateboarding.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/4/d40b9e06d3fc8b81f5668b4d5405a828c091bdf7.jpg" width="666" height="500">

In the future I hope they release some trucks specific for the market, I'll keep you posted. Suspension makes a lot of sense on an electric long range board.

Riptide Sports the guys who make the best skateboard bushings in the business sent me a really nice pack of everything I need to tune these trucks for any trail or ride I'm planning on doing. I'm currently using a WFB fatcone board-side in the rear and it helps a lot with traction on an electric skateboard. I'm using their Krankz on the road-sides and they are so nice, perfect rebound and feel. I actually use Riptide in all my skateboards, tall barrels, fat cone, chubbies and even just traditional park trucks, nothing compares and if you haven't tuned your trucks with some nice bushings you are missing out!

I'm doing the power system math based on real world results from my existing setup. I believe you can do all the math on paper but it won't help you in reality where the environment and unforeseen conditions impact the outcome.

I used 6 batteries from those silly balance boards or hoverboards, there's pallets of them on ebay for super cheap so that's what I started with. 6 of these 4.400mah 36v batteries wired together gets me 52 miles with the HobbyKing DIY electric skateboard kit. So I figured 15 of those same batteries would easily go 100+ miles, no math needed, just ensured overkill.

Ian from Hobbyking, and a member of these forums is now helping me out as well. I'm glad to finally have a sponsor who actually makes electric skateboard parts along with the skate companies helping with this project. I hope it provides an example for others wishing to become "sponsored electric skateboarders" and not just shills for the eskate industry, start with the existing skateboard industry as sponsored team riders are the norm in skateboarding, always has been since Stacy and Alva kicked it all off.

I've been using Hobbyking stuff for years for a few hobbies of mine and I've always liked them. At 1st I just purchased the DIY electric skateboard kit because it was a cheap solution and had the parts I required for this project. I soon discovered after a few hundred miles on the motor, ESC and pulleys that these are some good solid parts and perfect for my use. The motor is specifically make for skateboarding, and it's not some RC car or drone motor being re-purposed and they also make a descent version of the VESC which Ive used without issue on all my rides. I hope they come out with more parts for us DIY electric skateboard builders, they make it pretty cheap and easy.

They sent me the now famous HK-GT2B to use as well

And you guys showed me how to make this out of it, it's so rad, this community rocks and I'll be adding a battery indicator to it as well. I want to make another one now for my other boards, what a great idea and it offers a safe secure connection as well, I just don't trust bluetooth or non-spread spectrum controllers with my life.

Well, that's all I got for now, but I thought that this would be a fine start to a built thread. I'll use this thread to post the progress as this monster comes to life. If you have ideas or suggestions let me have it. 

Once this thing is done, I will attempt a 100 mile ride on a single charge, the board is half the battle, the other is training and learning what it takes to ride that far physically. If you want to join me, build one too and let's do this!

Heavier than my 66lb 1600 whr beast? Do you plan to use the whole 2300 whr's? Does your board consume 23 whr/mile?

Cool project, cant wait to see your finished project and a 100 mile ride on a charge. 👌

Im gonna be range testing my Carvon V3's with the 1600 whrs in the near future im curious to see how your single drive efficiency compares to my 4wd efficiency on a 50+ mile ride.

Can you tell me your cruising speed so I can keep it comparable? Also will you be using the Vesc Monitor app to track data?

mygooood that's going to be a long ride. I often make a drive from OC to LA and back which is about 100 miles. that's an hour each way with slight traffic, can't imagine what my legs would feel like riding that distance. 

Is this going to be a 100 mile non-stop test or will you take a break after a bit?

So far I have been riding non-stop with very short breaks to go pee and have a snack. I step off the board every 2 hours at least. My best time for 50 miles is 3 hours and 45 minutes. I am shooting for under 8 hours for 100 miles, any longer and I'll have to worry about light.

Yes but 20700 are about 5x more expensive than the batteries he is currently using. If he wanted to make his board more energy dense, 20700 still are not the answer as they are less energy dense than the most dense 18650 by about 20% and still more expensive per wh

Interned for Spacex, didnt like it + I like my current job :slight_smile:

Tesla's 2170 cell has not on the market yet. I don't think they will be for a very very very long time. 

The most energy dense battery currently on the market is the Sanyo NCR18650GA, Sanyo is owned by Panasonic. Do you know who makes Tesla's batteries??? Hint: Panasonic. 

The gigafactory is in fact a partnership between the two companies. Tesla owns the land and building while Panasonic runs the production of batteries. 

That's enough battery tech history for a night. 

I cant wait to see more updates about this build!

Since I found a ton of cheap batteries on ebay, lol...C rating becomes less important when you use over 50,000mah, lol  Yes, you can get much better batteries, but I cannot afford them even with sponsor support.  Hobbyking hooked me up with 3 20,000mah 14.8v 4cell packs to use in my race setup...only 10c but should work well.

No flamage from me dude, no worries..

If someone wanted to donate or build me a battery to showcase their skills or technology, I'm all ears. I lack a battery sponsor, so I have figured out how to go 100 miles from cheap ebay crap...it's not about what's "best" it's about what's possible (for me)...I regularly ride my long range board and it's rocking 6 of these batteries and goes 52 miles on a charge with 90mm classic thane, I just put down 15 batteries and plan to run 107mm reflex ...think I'll go 100 miles?

I need to talk to Dave bout gear ratio too, I'm on the stock hobbyking 15/36 125kv 36v on 107mm..and I would love more torque and efficiency...suggestions? I am currently using this, and would like to get a large motor pulley to gain torque: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/gear-set-with-belt.html

I'm using a 10s8p liion setup :D it's a bit heavier thana 40 cell setup obviously, but I'm building something more for distance. Technically on a flat land setup without constant full speed... I should be able to do around 65-75 miles.

I used http://calc.esk8.today/advanced/ to calculate the info.

Using 100mm wheels, 260kv motor (dual diagonal setup), average energy use of around 10watts per mile. Running around 33% efficiency which gives me a speed of roughly 16mph. Nothing too quick, but gives some distance...

If I adjust the settings to get more distance, I could drop eff to 25%, 12.5mph constant speed, probably around 8w-hr per mile, giving me a theoretical distance of 90miles per charge.

To get a 100 mile range, I'd have to drop eff to like 15-18%, constant speed around 8ish mph

Flip side, if i'm running 40% eff, for a constant speed around 23.5mph, I could theoretically do 48 miles.

However.... I'm waiting on the second vesc to come in, and I'll finalize the setup to test this out for real world numbers.

I decided to take a small data sample at slow speeds. Which is hard to do btw.  My BT module reports data for only one vesc.  But at 9mph average I used 1.6a combined average.  Dual 6374 on 107s with 18/36 12s.  So if I had 12s8p with 30q would be 24ah pack. At this this usage I could go for 15hrs at 9 mph is 135 miles. My riding area is super flat and smooth. Realistically less than 135 but over 100.  Maybe?!?

https://metr.at/r/0zceW

I'd rather do it at ~33 mph...

After work yesterday I threw all four of my  Carvon V3's onto my Trampa deck with a 1600whr battery.

I figured Id give it a warm up run today to get it dialed in and work any bugs out but after about 30miles she was running flawlessly and I still had 70% charge so I decided Id do a full range test. 

I tracked the whole run on the Ackmaniac app and also on Strava App.

I can only imagine what my leg would fell like after that

I’m impressed by 4wd efficiency, do you have any test with 2wd? And maybe 1wd? Maybe the most efficiency is in your setup due to the reduced current across all components. In my single drive belt drive I average 7,4 Wh/km with a fair amount of hills on half of the route

@guyguy

Naw no breaks, just rode it for 7hrs strait. I just did a little dance on my board to keep my feet happy and the blood flowing. I actually feel fine. I just finished charging and gonna meet some friends to do some more riding.

My last century bike ride was much much harder and I was beat for days. Only thing I would do differnt is leave the two 12S fast chargers and the gallon of water I brought behind. The 15-20lb back pack was no bueno. Ohh Id also start early haha. 60 of the 100 miles were ridden in the dark.

7.4  whr/mile sounds like amazing efficiency. What speed is that averaging and what was the total weight of you plus board? My board is 50ish pounds and Im 265lbs  plus a 15-20lb board so roughly 350 lbs total in my trip.

I used to ride a hangover 100 every new year when I was racing bikes. The actual ride was more like 156 miles. My first year I was dead tired for weeks, the next few years it was nothing, just another day on the bike.

You and I might need to plan a long range group ride, I'll bring the chase van to carry the gear, beer and tents!

Oh that is Wh/Km, 12 Wh/mi, I guess around 15 mph average, me 180 lb Ann board 20 lbs

My guess is the high gearing is the main factor, at the time I was running 11/36 on 80mm and a 230kv motor that measured 212kv, so the motor was spinning fast and around the peak efficiency zone

If my theory is correct it should improve a bit, we Shaw see

As soon I finish my board I plan to do a few runs with a fixed speed to determine the most efficient zone and make a mode using @rpasichnyk app, will be great for when you really want to go far. With your battery is less of a concern with this order of energy stored, I bet you could run pneumatics with 4 flat tires and go farther than most of us

That's so cool, the reduction in amp draw from each motor added up to be overall more efficient, makes tons of sense, headroom in the system is just that.

So who's next to join the club, looks like I started something here, who's gonna break 1,000 miles? or hell eskate across the country on a charge, lol hahahaha.

If I could not afford x4 Carvon, if I could I would already be using them, dude was the 1st guy I contacted when looking for a solution, but they were not even available. Single motor solution is a fraction of the cost of a trampa with 4 Carvons on it, lol damn, how much did that rig cost in total? I am curious how it compares to my total cost after getting mine on the road.

Hub motor/direct drive vs belt and 2wd vs 4wd has been debated like the Chicken Vs the egg question and the most experienced forum members are still divided on the subject, but I'll share my observations on a couple of things.

 Early efficiency testing results with hub motors and direct drive systems were confounded by low urethane quality or other issues that led to increased rolling resistance.

Hub motors also produce more heat during use since more torque is being required out of each hub motor due to lack of gear reduction. 

My 4wd Carvon board addresses the first of the above problems by using high quality urathane wheels.

The second issue is adressed by using an 4WD design.  4WD divides the amount of torque required from each motor in half. This offers a theoretical gain in efficiency since low speed losses in the motor increase exponentially with torque.

I haven't seen any 4wd belt data to show that the same gain in efficiency would be seen. Id suspect that some of the gain in efficiency from dividing the torque required per motor would be negated by doubling belt drag.

Id love to to see more 4wd data.

To answer your question my setup is quite expensive, it cost me about 3k in parts, but if someone was to pay retail for everything it would cost about $5200.

The one that didnt wheel bite or feel too wobbly lol. I didnt bother measuring. The baseplate is adustable but if I lower the angle too much the wheels bite during hard turning onto the battery enclousure, too much angle and the board gets squirmy and too high off the ground. Final effective angle is about 60ish degrees so the hanger is adjusted  to over 100 degrees when u factor in the angle of the deck.

@Mobutusan

Surfrods adjustable baseplates arent compatible with standard skate hangers since their BP has a shorter pivot cup hole to kingpin distance. I needed to cut the baseplate back and increase the depth of the piviot cup hole about 15mm to make it work.

15 tooth motor pulley
36 tooth wheel pulley
90mm Flywheels

I wish to run 107mm flywheels and get the same performance I have with the 90mm's

My current setup  (50 miles)

Well 1st of all, I use a maple skateboard deck, using a real skate deck is sort of really important and overlooked sometimes (I overlooked it initially too), I use Avenue suspension trucks and even tried giant soft wheels, it takes the edge off the jarring and vibration that causes all that pain in your legs and allows you to extend your range. 

The deck is the primary means of suspension on any skateboard, a stiff deck will not be comfortable (also decks with tons of shape and contours will be uncomfortable too, flatter is better) but will be precision in it's control and leverage, such as a heavy and stiff 9 ply maple downhill deck. Cruising and dancing setups use a flexy flat deck, and long distance pumpers use a flexy deck tuned to their weight and use the rebound to propel them.

Once you have the proper deck dialed for your weight, including the weight of the components it will feel much nicer than any stiff deck, and full CF decks make no sense at all, that's a wonderful way to increase pain, they would only be beneficial to a downhill setup, they offer zero vibration damping and even resonate making the issue worse. There's a reason skateboard decks are religiously made with maple and certain woods, and have been for decades, skate companies have already tried all sorts of gimmicks through the 60's and 70's, but what works, is what works and wood is good.
 
The deck is the primary means of suspension, but you have to tune it right or it doesn't work, Trampa and AT boards use a very flexible deck with a lot of travel due to the camber, this is needed when off road (like those foot straps to hold you on, lol) and is overkill for the streets, but it's perfect if you wish to go 100 miles and enjoy it too. I bet it's cushy and nice but I personally work in the medium of "skateboards" (I have a kicktail problem too) and have zero experience with AT or off-road decks and setups. I don't ride or build with pneumatic tires at all. But there's a million options, a Loaded dancing deck, or Subsonic deck tuned to your weight would do wonders. Any deck where you can select at least one-of-three options for flex . If the deck builder really knows what they are doing, they will ask you what flex you wish to have (typically 1, 2, 3), and then ask your weight as well. That's when you know the company knows what they are talking about! They then use some magic and something strange called math to build your deck for you personally and it's worth the money. Spend $200 on a deck? People do all day, sure, but make sure it's from a company that can make it right if you want to experience why decks are tuned to people.
 
I personally have access to really nice precision suspension trucks from Avenue so this adds a lot more to the equation and makes up for the lack of camber and travel in my deck, I would say the Avenues are my secret sauce and they provide additional travel that is tuned and stable. The truck design takes the shock and vibration from the axle, not the pivots, and it bypasses the bushings entirely passing through a sturdy and adjustable queen-pin which also keeps the hanger centered at all times. When I say precision suspension prototype trucks, I really mean, game changing innovation that I'm so lucky to have available to me. 

There's just a few main parts to a skateboard, I don't stray from them and I'm the last guy to be sold on gimmicks, trust me when I say these are the best trucks, bar none, for any longboard skateboarding, not just electrics, they are real precision race trucks meant to bomb mountains, I just convince the dude they would be rad for electrics too. If you want the best electric skateboard, 1st, find the best skateboard parts and start there. Do not think of the deck, trucks and wheels as an afterthought to the power system, these things are the heart and soul of a skateboard and they should be the best you can get. After-all, you gonna put a motor on it right?

I also use something called the Loaded Pushin Cushion on my 50-mile board, this is a vibration damping foam that goes under your griptape, it's great for long distance pushing but this stuff takes away from the skateboarding experience a little with a loss of feeling on the deck itself, I am actually omitting it from this 100 mile build and opting for a wood grain, with map of my favorite trails glassed in clear and DIY epoxy based clear griptape. I have found some really nice options for skateboarding specific insoles for my shoes instead of using the Pushin Cushion under the grip tape. While testing different insoles, I found that they are a better option than taking away the feeling and control from the surface of the deck. Look up Sorbothane if you want to get into the finer details of making 100 miles pleasurable.

I have tried different wheels and I believe trying to use wheels to aid in vibration damping is a poor idea, for long distance eskating the wheels are too important to the equation, they effect efficiency and effectiveness of your power system...a softer wheel will roll slower than a harder one, and I find the Abec11 in Classic thane, not reflex, and 90mm is the best wheel for me at the moment (sweet spot for my setup of 15/36 gearing on 125kv). The guys here say I should run a 44 tooth wheel pulley and some say a more powerful motor with twice the wattage will do the trick.

Parts are being made now for all us guys who want to put miles on the 107mm wheels. When I tried the 107mm for a few hundred miles, I enjoyed the reflex thane alot actually and the increased size made up for the lower roll speed of the thane itself. I actually have reflex 85mm BigZigs on a garage race DH deck, sticky stuff and love it's traction actually, it was nice and soft and I liked that part but they are so wide for my needs it's just  unneeded friction, not to mention the gearing issue with turning a 107mm wheel when you run a 15mm belt, there's simply not a lot of parts yet and people are working on it. I prefer the 90mm Classic, It's thinner contact patch and harder thane lends a lot to long distance riding where a softer wheel doesn't add that much vibration damping and takes efficiency away, the effects are extremely minimal to vibration damping, and nothing like the benefits of a proper tuned deck or suspension trucks.

There's also something to be said about bushings and how well they are tuned for long rides as well, you want a good return-to-center and a balance between rebound and function. On a typical rkp truck the bushing do "give" a little and provide their version of vibration damping. I have found the new Riptide Krankz to be perfect for this. they made them so you can tune the preload more than other bushings, meaning the kingpin bolt actually does something now when you adjust your bushings. A symptom of a bushing like this is the added rebound that lends itself well to carrying the added weight of electric components and still self centers well. 

Bring on the questions and feedback, lemme have it dudes..

Oh and here's a picture of Jay, cus I like playing skateboards..

lol, I know right? But it's not me man, this 100 mile board is being build in three different shops, including a longboard deck manufacturer, a truck factory and then in my garage for all the soldering and electronics. Hobbyking threw in the drive kit and helped with batteries for testing as well. It's taken three shops, 4 companies and 3 dudes working many weeks so far to get it to this point and I really love seeing my design come to fruition, lol...we are determined to make it rad by balancing between the culture here and the existing skate culture, taking design cues from both and combining them...when pro downhill riders come through the shop, as they always do to pick up new product or get things worked on, they see this thing sitting there and there's no hate in the world that can overcome their curiosity, that's the idea here..

If my math is correct, 
3.6v x 2.2Ah x 20 cells x 18 packs = 2,851.2 Wh.
2851.2 Wh / 10 Wh/k = 285.12 km
285.12 km x 0.621 km/mi = 177 miles :astonished:

That's gonna have to be two day ride to drain that beast.

I don't know Derek well, only chatted online with him recently, but he took my challenge of riding 100 miles and he ran with it, his passion, knowledge, skills and riding ability will be missed. He has a lot to contribute to this idea.

When I began talking about building a 100 mile board and training here in the forums, he most likely looked at himself in the mirror and said "that's easy" and reconfigured his existing setup to go for a 100 mile run and he put on his headphones and rode and just did it. Derek is at home on the board.

His passion for actually riding and just getting out there and shredding is something I can relate too. He is a knowledgeable and helpful member of the DIY community and his account and post history is rich with information. When I got into this just a short time ago, I wanted to be like Derek, out with the wind in my hair spanking miles and routes through the real world and smashing records.

The news hit me hard, so I went for a ride and did what he might do, shred some miles...I thought about this silly project, and how intrinsically meaningless it is. I have decided to change the name of this project in honor of the 1st dude who rode 100 miles on a single charge and in honor of all the big boys, and their toys.

Brian has been doing the outer layers of carbon fiber, keeping the lines all straight on this lumpy deck is hard...she will be a looker that's for sure...I'm not typically into carbon fiber, but when it's the real deal and functional and wrapping baltic birch and maple, then ok, I think carbon is pretty damn sick looking, lol...

Sorry for the delay in updates, it's been slow going due to me having to move unexpectedly and pack up my shop. Brian has recovered from the holidays and the enclosure mold is shaping up nicely. We keep getting distracted by the art of it all and making it rad.

We are just about ready to cannibalize my 50 mile setup for it's trucks, I wasn't able to get a new set in time for this build and I sort of want to hold out for Avenue's electric hangers anyway. The plan is still 90mm wheels and a single motor to get this thing down the road. I cannot wait to test ride it and report back what I learn.

Now that I'm moved I begin unpacking and building out my shop again. The soldering and electronics all fall to me and I have more than a few things to do for future projects.

As for the 100 mile board, I finally have an update, I am sorry its overdue...

The last step in fabricating this board has been the enclosure and it's been a real pain in the butt for Brain over at Helter Skelter Hybrids. We are literally in the last 10% of the build and waiting on some formed metal to reinforce the enclosure and allow us to sex bolt it to the deck, magnet idea went out the window. 

Due to some life issue (moving, job change, new girlfriend) Brain has been delayed but came up for air yesterday for a beer and a bench race. I hope to get this thing rolling within a few weeks and start pushing her on longer training rides.

I worry about the batteries at this point as there's been better opinions and these are aging on the bench. the enclosure is large enough to have a better battery built later to increase the range further. 

On a side note, I got news from Avenue that a 220mm truck for electrics is on the drawing board. I've been begging for it enough that I think they caved. I hope to have them built to fit dual HK SK8 motors..the big ones, so stay tuned..

Sorry there's no pictures for this update, but I promise there will be some in the next. As for people wishing me to build them boards or help design things and such, show me the money dudes, I have a daughter and a day job so make it worth my time before wasting it with endless emails and empty promises. And you other long distance skaters, this isn't a competition! Turn the strava off and look around, enjoy the wind and the air and shred hard bros, remember why we ride and don't forget it!
