Hey Guys,

I've been steady lurkin' for a while now. I'm a huge fan of this community.  You guys have inspired me to start my first build and get in the game.

I plan on using this board to walk/run my dog. I weigh 180lbs. The route is just over 1 mile and it's relatively flat (however outside that route is fairly steep).

Here's what I know so far:
* [Clutch Underdog](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/70799/clutch-drop-thru-underdog-longboard-skateboard-deck-w-grip)
* [Carvon V2 Dual Hubs (ABEC 11s)](http://www.carvonskates.com/store/p20/V2_DUAL_HUB_MOTORS___FRONT_TRUCK___ABEC11_90mm_FLYWHEEL_SET.html)
* [Dual VESCs](product/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/)

The biggest unknown is the battery. I prefer to use 18650s for convenience. I'm trying to figure out if I can get away with a 10S pack. I see @AbrownMN and @LukeM are going with @torqueboards 12S3P. I would love to use this 12S3P pack too but it's just a bit too long for my board once you add up the pack, VESCs, receiver wires and enclosure.

Some people get great results with the SPACE Cell and Carvon V2s. Is that just because they weigh < 180 lbs?  I was hoping 10S3P would be enough since I'm only going 1.2 miles.

I mentioned the dog walking route was relatively flat. Here are the details of that route:

Here is a video of Carvon V2 duals going up a 10% grade.
12s lipo
Torqueboards 120A 12s Esc's
Half throttle
185 lbs rider
Amp draw for both motors combined going up this hill was 54 amps.
Amp draw would be more with 10s
Probably best to have a battery that can handle more than 50amps for climbing hills.

Hola Hombre, welcome to the forums! Glad to see you decided to take the plunge. In regards to your battery question it would seem that most people, including @RunPlayBack aren't complaining about the 10s Pack, though he may be a bad example because I think he's like 130? Either way, the issue is moreso going to be the draw required from the battery to feed the two motors at high throttle. Some people experience cut offs when they get on top of it hard. Long story short, this is why I went with the 12s pack.  You will probably be satisfied with the 10s pack, but you may have some cutoff issues under heavy load. Let me know if you need help with anything else. I have learned a ton since I started researching this project.

I had issues with the space cells limitation of only 15 amps per motor. VESC can take 50 amps each and motors can take 80 amps. So limiting yourself to 15 amps means issues while climbing hills. I blew out a VESC while hitting either a heat limit or amp limit for an unknown reason.

My soltuion is I am going to up my amps to 25 per VESC, and I hope this helps.

My recommendation would get something that can pull 50 amps per motor (since that is the VESC amp limit) and 12s, since you will get more torque.

Lol yeah I think I'm lightest one in here. @TheWrongHombre 10s pack is fine if your riding on flats. I've definitely had friends around 180 ride my dual board. If you're over 200lbs a belt system is probably better. My components with dual VESC's and Space Cell is around 21" in length so that should be plenty of room with your deck.

You are right about the flats. I'm between 190-200 lbs, and I have no issues with the space cell and carvOn combo on flat. The hills become the issue, even medium to small hills.

Not sure about 6%. I've only tested the amp on the 10%. We also have a longer hill that is about 3.5% grade and I can fly up that one easily at 20-28mph
The 3.5% is at the beginning of this video.

The new space cells states the following:

### [Space Cell PRO3](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/space-cell-pro3-electric-skateboard-battery/)
> Pack rated to peak output of 60AMP, However incorporates a 40A Fuse for protection

### [Space Cell PRO4](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/space-cell-pro4-electric-skateboard-battery/)
> Pack rated to peak output of 80AMP, However incorporates a 40A Fuse for protection

Am I right in assuming that's 20 amps per motor now?

When you say:
> My soltuion is I am going to up my amps to 25 per VESC, and I hope this helps.

Are you modifying the space cell to get 25A per VESC or do you have a different battery pack you're using to get 25A per VESC?

Also, you mentioned you ran into issues even on small hills. Can you give any more details on small hills?  My main route has at most 6% grade according to findhills (although it feels steeper in the real world).

I had issue on 7% grade hills, I make it up one and then by the second, it starts dying down. It sounds more like heat, but Chaka this it might be the amp limit, since I should be drawing more amps than 15 per motor to get up that hill.

About the space cell, I am in the process of all of this, hopefully I will finish in a few hours. But I am wiring around the bms. If I still have issues after this mod, then I will know where the problem is, which would be heat.

Either way, more amps is preferable.

Glad to hear it man! I tried to be very thorough so far to help others out in the future..So far I am going to work with that enclosure and see what I can do. Ultimately, I will end up with a custom CNC wood enclosure most likely.  As soon as I get the enclosure I can comment on if I will need to modify it at all, but I have a feeling that it will basically sit perfect on there given the boards shape. We shall see! Getting everything else this week or early next week hopefully! I believe the setup is rated for 30A continuous and 80A peak power.

Can't wait to see the board with the enclosure on it.

Based on everything I'm hearing, it seems like the flyweights and bantamweights are the only ones having success with 10S + Carvon's Dual Hubs + Hills.

I guess when it comes down to it, I could either go on a major diet or jump up to 12S.

I've decided to go with @torqueboards 12S3P pack since I'm not a fan of cutting weight.

[/quote]

heat is a problem, but it is not _THE_ problem....

You have a set of motors that are designed to operate at a top speed of 106km/h (66mph) when powered by a fully charged 10S battery

If you are not operating them in their optimal RPM range they will be very inefficient, using more power than necessary & generating lots of **heat**....

Drive trains should be designed to deliver a useable top speed. You want to try & keep the RPM in the optimal range to get optimal performance whilst reaching speeds you can manage. This is the problem with hub motors..

Example: I don't like riding much faster than about 45km/h, mostly because it's not safe in an urban environment. So I design my drive train to reach a max speed of approx 45km/h. When I am riding I ride at top speed when possible. When I approach a hill it's at top speed. I have maximum RPM, maximum momentum, This is how electric skateboards (motors) like to work. 

**Let's put it in perspective, The drive train I use for my systems**
Motor pulley 15T
Wheel Pulley 36T
Motor 190kv
Battery Nominal Voltage 36v
Wheel 83mm
Why do I use this setup? Because top speed is around 45km/h...& that's the speed I want to ride It makes sense. right?

Now If I swap the motor to a 450KV motor... the top speed is now 106km/h... it wouldn't make sense, there is no advantage. There is not a single person on this forum that would agree that using a 450KV motor is a good idea.

The expected issues of using a 450kv motor on my skateboard
1. Very poor starting performance
2. Very poor hill climbing performance
3. Very high current draw at low speed, High current peaks whenever loaded.
4. Battery discharge problems, reduced life expectancy.
5. ESC Problems.
6. Overheating motors.


**Increasing voltage**
Using 12S battery on Carvon hubs won't really solve any problems, It may actually stress your motors more. Your top speed now is 126km/h (79mph). The motor RPM when "at cruising speed" is now even lower than before. The higher voltage will simply make your motors want to spin faster, However, they will not necessarily be able to if they don't have enough torque in that RPM range to reduce the load of the rider. The load on the motors & the torque output at low RPM is the problem Because torque is current you will need to pull more current until the load is reduced, which won't really happen unless you reach the optimal (higher) RPM range, which won't happen either. So your hill climbing performance probably won't improve.

If anything, it might actually make sense to use lower voltage on Carvon HUBS. 6S is probably better suited. It may actually be more efficient.

I don't dispute your argument. but ride them and try. Even if the science doesn't back us up, they feel really good. The larger wheels with a tad sponge to absorb some vibrations feel great. Check out this video to see a sneak peak of what they can do, including starting from a standstill. (btw, yes this is slow riding, I'm by no means pushing its speed limits)

At the end of the day, we need to get away from math and numbers, and just ride... That's the only way to know, right?

@evoheyax @onloop

For what it's worth, I'm thinking about getting both the 12S3P and the space cell to test them out in the real world.

I'll see which one works best for Jobby Lane and use the other to start a second build :smile:

Most of the recent builds I've seen for Carvon V2 have used VESCs.  Have you had any experience with the VESC as well?

How do you like the 12S ESC?

I might be wrong about this but I thought I was seeing people really like the Carvon V2 + VESC on FOC setting to reduce the amount of motor noise.  Does your board run on the loud side?

I haven't tried the Vesc. But I've been told that the Vesc can't handle as much current as the TB 12s Esc. Although the TB isn't as fine tunable as the Vesc, it can be adjusted enough with the program box so that it does fine. And a plus is that you can take the box in your pocket and make adjustments on the road. There is no quiet mode with the TB. 
And the motors sound like little jet engines. It's a real head turner! Check the out the beginning of my video, you can hear the motor scream.
 It's not as easy to fry the TB as it is with the Vesc. And you don't have to wait months to get one. 
The Vesc is good if you want quiet or your using the space cell because of it's limiting ability and if your riding mostly flat terrain.
If you live around a lot of hills like I do, you might want to go with TB's and 12s lipos

It just has so many features. There's times that I would prefer the stealth mode like riding back and forth in my neighborhood. Some of my neighbors are a bit too persnickety. 
And now there's a new development with the Vesc that you can connect a Bluetooth module and use a smartphone app to adjust your Vesc settings and have realtime monitoring on the fly. This is HUGE!!!

No risers and no wheelbite.  

With cutouts and the carvon v2 hubs on 10" funbox trucks, the only concern would be bite on the hub motors themselves.

That pic is setup as a top mount.  There's no bite at all.  I haven't tried it mounted drop through.  It might be a little close since the board has a slight flare at the mount.  There's also the clutch doubletap that has no flare.

Its a great idea, but they are too expensive. I have 2x 6s 8000 mAh zippy's, they work great for range on a single drive system, I can pull high amps from them too. And they cost $160, not $700+. Also, there's some debate as to whats the best for carvon's right now. Higher s rating means higher optimal rpm, which the carvons never reach, thus creating inefficiency. A 6s would lower this and probably make it more efficient. However, you are bond by the vesc's limit of 50 amps per motor, which means you can't pull more than 100 amps (continuously), regardless of your batteries. lower s = more amps for the same result of a higher s battery. So going higher reduces amps, giving the feeling this is the best option, though a 6s battery may actually be better, if 100 amps is enough to get you up the hills you need. There needs to be some more trial and error here.

I agree they are expensive but, they have a lifetime warranty.  If you view and scroll through to the bottom prices are still pricey but do-able for my situation!!! These types of batteries are for heavier electric skateboard guys. In the 240+ region using the carvon motors.  I live in a hilly area--great going down them, not great going up them. The combination of higher voltage and amps really helped my situation. Though, I am still tweaking my board, but for bigger guys it cost to move that extra weight and for range. I specifically wanted the hub motors for the skateboard feel. The next board I build will be using a castle creation 2028 type motor. There's a guy "skate21 JaysTCB, FLYKRISCO" on YouTube with a friend cruising around the streets at insane speeds of 40+ mph consistently trying to break a world skateboard speed record! 

Your thoughts!

First, I weigh 210. You are going about getting torque the complete opposite of what you should do. You need a reduction set up with pulleys and belts. Hubs are not going to compete at any voltage at your weight. Second, the 2028, required major kicking to even get going because of its kv. Horrible choice of motor. He had several fires due to it pulling do many amps from working too hard. Third, a lifetime warranty on lipo? Good luck cashing in on that. You'd be way better off not buying in to that kind of marketing. They aren't doing anything you can't do yourself for a fraction of the cost.

Nice! I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts and seeing this thing in action. I was planning almost identical build with 10s but after reading this thread, I am unsure which way to go with the power. I'd prefer to stick with the 10s for the weight and the smaller footprint. @Namasaki your board really does sound like a jet engine on the TB ESC! Impressive but not altogether stealthy 😛 @christ298 that guys videos are crazy... So ridiculously fast around the city streets passing traffic. Did you see the one where his Esc fails and he gets thrown?

Thanks @CRABOLSKY,

I've only taken it out a few times.  I only had 1 motor running at first because I forgot to get a dual outlet xt90 connector for DIY's 12s3p.

1 motor was not enough for the hills on my route.  It was able to handle this terrain but it just barely made it to the peak.

I made my own dual outlet xt90 following this video. 
http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aCtiN1KR9iE

Now I have both motors running and it handles that route no problem!  It had no problem going even further.

12s is great!  It's giving me all the power I need but I still need to figure out a plan for the enclosure. 

I haven't tried 10s yet. Still waiting on the new space cell to test it out.

Just when I thought everything was hunky dory, it stopped working.

I'm not really sure the best approach for debugging this issue but here are some details in case anyone has some tips.

I've only ridden this thing a few times.  The last time I rode it, I got the battery down to around 12% and it started acting a little squirrelly.  Not too bad.  It just didn't respond to the throttle for a few seconds.

I recharged the battery to 100%.  Everything still seemed fine on the bench.  It was responding fine to the controller.  When I tried to ride it, it wasn't responding under any load.  It would start to respond but then die out.  In fact I even tried letting it roll down a slight incline without any load on it and tested the brakes.  The brakes didn't work.  A couple seconds later the brakes kinda started to work but not much.

I flipped the board over on it's back, it responds just fine to the throttle and brake.

I'm not really sure where to start debugging this.  I hooked it up to the BLDC tool.  The motor detects just fine and I don't get any faults in the realtime tab.  But that's all on the bench without any load on it.

I tried dropping down to a single motor to rule out the canbus connector.  Still the same problem.  Although 1 motor seems to respond a little better than the other under load.

I'm assuming it's a problem with my VESCs.  I have another pair of VESCs I can try that I've never used before but I need to do some soldering work to get them working with the 4mm bullets on the Carvons.

Anyway, my next steps will be to get my backup VESCs soldered up and test those out.  I'll keep searching the forum for similar issues.

Seems like it's not a problem with the VESC.

I replaced the fuse on the battery pack and the board started working again!

I took it out for a ride to see if it was all good.  The first 50 yards were great.  I thought I was in the clear.  Then it started cutting out on me.  I guess I might also have a problem with the transmitter/receiver.  A fresh set of batteries didn't solve the problem so i'll have to look into it some more tomorrow.

Blowing the fuse could've been from running it too hard on the single motor, causing it to pull more amps. 

I'd just make sure your VESC settings are alligned so that combined they won't pull more than your battery can handle- people had this problem with the first batch of space cells before fuses became a standard feature.

Thanks @cmatson

I definitely need to double check my VESC settings to make sure they're set properly. 

I forgot to mention about the old fuse.  It didn't actually blow the fuse. When I inspected it, the fuse wasn't seated properly. I think it was just jostled loose. I pushed it back in and it worked.  I only replaced the fuse because I had another one on hand that fit more snugly than the old one.

I did some more testing tonight.

First I made sure all connections were tight (especially the receiver).  This didn't fix the issue. It was still cutting out a bit.

Then I connected the board to my computer & the BLDC tool and I checked the realtime tab while I rode it around a couple hundred meters.  It cut out a few times during the test but I didn't see any faults in the realtime tab or the terminal.

Next, I reconfigured the FOC tab and wrote the new configuration to the VESC.  It started acting a little better.  This might have just been a coincidence.

Anyway, I still suspect the receiver or servo wires.  I also need to verify I've setup my BLDC settings properly. 

Max input is set to 57.00V.  Not sure why I set it that high.  I believe this should be 50.4V.  That's the first change I'll make.

I was still getting over_current faults with max input 51V and 52V.  I guess I'll stick with my original 57V for now.  I'll have to read more about the max input setting.  Next step is to investigate that servo wire and the receiver.

DSomeone please correct me if I'm wrong but u will only have more power with 12s when u are going over what the max speed of the 10s would be. Only then will u realize moe power.  If u aren't up to that speed u will be more inefficient than u were on 10s and more heat in the motor.  The only benefit to 12s is keeping ur battery wires cool and possibly the vesc, not drawing quite as many amps from the battery (the voltae gets converted to amps for the motor) and you et a higher top speed. you will have the same amps put into the motor with 12s or 10s..In fact ull need a tiny bit more amperage with the 12s, to the motor, compared to 10s.  But if ur vesc is getting hot be better to move to 12s.  With those motors being so high kv, as been said, you would be better served in a way running 4s 5s or 6s..as long as the vescs can take it.  I
Riding so far from the no-load max rpm ...is not efficient period. maybe do a 6s vs 12s comparison.  Ur amps to the motor limit ...no from battery...can stay the same ..but the amp limit from the battery ud maybe have to increase on 6s

I read on the voltsge limit st u tripped there ar spikes going both ways and that's why we're limited to 50v when the components are specked to higher

Well, it's my first build and I'm not yet familiar with the calculations or physics related to batteries.  However, it looks like you and @Namasaki gathered some interesting data here: 
 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-you-burn-up-ur-esc-or-motor-going-slowly-and-despite-seeing-few-amps-from-the-battery/4008/41

I already have a PRO4 on order.  I was just starting to think about how I might be able to compare the two.  I remember seeing a vedder overlay with his bldc-logging code.  Not sure what the state is of that project though.  Then I was thinking about adding an amp meter.  In your post it looks like you guys put an inline or clamp amp meter to monitor the amp draw.  Does that keep a log of the usage or are you literally just looking down at the amp meter while you're blazing around town?

Nope, holding off on that..doesn't seem like the benefits outweigh the potential risks at this point. Some people are running it without problems though so I am not really sure if there's an issue with settings for some people or what. BLDC is working just fine for me. I am going to need some threaded insets in the board though, had a screw come loose after a couple hours of riding today and it doesn't want to stay back in now.

As far as over heating, my motors got pretty hot today, vesc's were putting a bit of heat to the wood enclosure but nothing crazy. Everything worked out fine, and that's pulling buddy's uphill at full throttle and maintaining pretty slow speeds at times which definitely seems to put more strain on the motors. Enclosure is air tight and doesn't seem to be getting the components too hot.

You get more power with more voltage which appears as more torque and quicker acceleration at all speeds.
And of course, you also get higher top speed.
The difference is huge when comparing 12s to 6s but comparing 12s to 10s the difference is likely to be less pronounced.
The Esc,(which acts as a voltage regulator) delivers voltage to the motors: more throttle=more voltage. The current that the motor draws from the Esc stays constant until you put load on the motor. more load=more current. However the higher the voltage, the less current the motor draws for a given load.

They go together. Voltage and amps. 

The difference between riding 6s vs 12s if the kv is adjusted to match..should be no difference.  U can get just as much power with the same motor running either on the different voltages if the kv is adjusted to match. From vedder's site after asking what voltage does in a motor it doesn't matter the battery voltage the amp limit "to the motor" is what decides the power.  Volts convert to amps going to the motor. The amps decide what the motor can do

I have tested running 6s and 12s on 230kv motors. I get much more torque,acceleration and speed with 12s on those motors. And twice the battery range at 12s for a given amp hour rating. i.e.: 6s/5000 or 12s/5000
I'm sorry but saying that voltage is converted into amperage does not make sense.

Yea I remember those tests. More speed on 12s for sure but inside a motor all that the motor uses to make torque is amps and the esc is converting the voltage to amps.  Volts in the battery are converted by the vesc to amps 
Vedder:

What causes heat in both the motor and VESC is the motor current. Neither the motor nor the VESC care about the battery current, only the battery does. Also, the battery current can never be higher than the motor current. So when you set the current limits you should set the motor current to a suitable value for the motor and VESC. For setting the battery current you only have to look at the battery. Most batteries, especially LiPos can provide more discharge current than you need, but the charge current is somewhat limited. 18650 cells might not be able to provide as much current as the motor can take, and if the battery has a BMS (such as the space cell) this can also limit the discharge current. Note that the battery current is directly proportional to the motor current times the speed (actually modulation). On low speed the motor current is much higher than the battery current, and on full speed they are the same. This means that if you have very high top speed the VESC will get warm on low power levels when running on low speed. The faster you go, the less heat the VESC generates per power output because the motor current is what causes heat and the battery current is what defines power.

Regarding the motor getting hot under a given load, this has nothing to do with the kv, as I wrote a bit about here:
http://vedder.se/2014/10/chosing-the-ri ... kateboard/
so if you have a given motor with different kv choises and the same copper fill, all of them will generate exactly the same amount of heat going up a given hill at a given speed. Changing to a higher kv value and running on lower voltage and higher current does not change the heat generation of the motor one bit. The motor only cares about the torque it has to provide, regardless of the kv/current combination."

Volts x amps is power but maybe that power isn't realized until u hit a high speed from the voltage, otherwise u should be able to push enough amps even with a low voltage to get the same performance

The quote above isn't very relevant and I remember ur results and I'm trying to make them fit this info about a motor being able to perform just as well on any voltage.  In ur tests u were at max speed I think on 6s and half on 12s right?  It should end up a lower amp draw from the battery on 12s but the same amp draw for a given torque regardless of the voltage.  Why those amps are many be easier to push through could be simply ohm's law.  I'm not sure it even happens though.  How's 5 to 15 mph speed on either?

If you put a clamp amp meter on the 3 phase wire and work the throttle up and down as I did. You will see that the Esc regulates the voltage to the motor and that the amperage stays constantly regardless of how much throttle you apply.  The amperage only increases as load is applied to the motor. 
I proved this theory by testing it myself. 
As far as the statement " voltage is converted to amperage" it makes no sense. And it doesn't agree with basic electrical theory. 
Volts is the measurement of electrical charge. 
Amps is the measurement of electrical current which is the flow of current through a circuit. 
You can't turn one into the other.

The vesc has two limits the amps from the battery and the amps to the motor. On 12s with a given load let's say it's 10 amp draw from the battery and 15 to the motor and on 6s it can be 12 from the motor and still 15 to the motor.  
The vesc turns voltage into amps from what I read. That's doable.  Maybe more amps can be pushed with the higher voltage but I read either system can perform the same if the kvs are adjusted

Volts are turned to amps and vise versa often with power coming into houses converting with a transformer.  
When u did ur test where u stayed at the same kv and doubled the voltage u kept to the same speed and load I think I remember.  How was acceleration up to speed on either voltage?  My one question about the difference between running 12s vs 6s is if the amps are able to be pushed faster with the higher voltage and increase acceleration.  I read it's not the case and of it is it likey would be the battery amp limit..which will be more easily reached on 6s vs 12s...as more amps are drawn from the battery on that system.  On the 12s...voltage is converted to amps and there will be less amps drawn from the battery

It gets complicated and I think this link explains well:

But a motor isn't a transformer anyway.  My point of talking about any of this is to find out how 12s vs 6s perform.  Assuming, which I do, and hopefully you do, that a motor is just as efficient at producing torque using any voltage(with a kv change)...you can get just as much power out of it.  But maybe with motor voltage you can push more amps over a given resistance and that would account for quicker acceleration. But I don't even know what your test results showed...did u get faster acceleration with the higher voltage?  Do people get faster acceleration with higher voltage? And if so why?

with a transformer you can make more amps

how do you think electricity is transported? they use a step up transformer to turn 120V at say 100 amps to 1200V at 10 amps and then a step down to turn it back in to 120V at 100 amps. you can get more amps at a loss of voltage and can get more volts at a loss of amps.

The light bulb is the Load. it takes 1000 watts of power to handle the load.
Think of your motor as a variable Load. as the load increases, more power is needed to handle the load.
more power requires more voltage or more amps. P=IE
Since you control the amount of voltage to the motor via the Esc. the current(amps) becomes the variable.
This is how going uphill at half throttle could cause higher amp flow that going uphill at full throttle.
More throttle more voltage and less amps.

I video recorded the bench tests but haven't gotten around to uploading them to youtube.
They show how the voltage increases as I pull the throttle and how the amperage stays constant until I grab the wheel and slow it down with my hand to simulate load. The tighter I squeeze the wheel the higher the amperage goes

when I push full throttle I hit the 60 amps to the motor limit as programmed. and that's my limit.  With ur esc surely it doesn't go to 120 or you'd have much higher battery draw possible with full throttle. 

With 6s vs 12s what was the amp draw from the batteries given the same load?  For me it's not the case with the vesc...running higher voltage draws less amps from the battery.

Ok, going the same speed up the same hill,
6s 37.4 peak amps
12s 18.4 peak amps
These reading are from the battery to the esc

well, in reality, I was guessing the speed. That is, I didn't use a speedometer to ensure I was going exactly the same speed. I may have been going a little faster with the 12s

There's the converted volts to amps playing out as the higher voltage system draws less amps with the same load 

Maybe from those numbers u could figure the esc to motor amp limit.  (If urs works the same as the vesc)

Amperage and voltage are inversely proportional if one goes up the other goes down and vice versa 
http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/alternating-current/chpt-9/step-up-and-step-down-transformers/

So yes a transformer can make amperage but at a loss of voltage

A transformer changes voltage. the amperage going up or down is a byproduct of what the transformer does which is to merely change the voltage.

the point is to transfer power over a long distance. Whatever power is being transported is still going to be the same power.  When the voltage is changed the amperage must change as well.  Instead of running high wasteful amps a long distance and losing them to heat they step the voltage way up and the amperage will have to go down.  Inverse relationship hand in hand

Here this guy knows stuff and sells it

Power is what gets the work done of transporting you on your vehicle.

No matter of it comes from a 10V 100A source or 100V 10A source, it's capable of exactly the same efficiency and torque and speed and heating etc provided the motors kV scales to the voltage and the copper fill% in the motor remains the same (and the 100A system needs a few feet of thicker wire between battery/controller/motor).

I wonder what limits ur controller

From a VESC perspective @Namasaki is using duty cycle or voltage control and that's what most hobby ESCs use. 

With the VESC we are using (normally) current control, which is torque control. 

Different concepts to be kept in mind when comparing controllers.

You can leave the maximum input voltage at 57 (in fact I wouldn't reduce it). If you set off with fully charged batteries you could easily exceed that voltage limit by touching the brake or coasting. This will fault out the VESC.

I made that mistake programming my 12S VESC as well and just leave all my max input voltages well above the voltage my batteries reach to be safe.

What limits Namasaki's current so low while he's on full throttle?  

With namasaki's readings on his multimeter along the motor wires, getting a voltage and then a current, wouldn't the vesc show similarly?  Wouldn't a voltage be a prerequisite for a current?

Have you tested that theory with a volt/amp meter on the motor wires to see first hand if it is true?
Because frankly I find that hard to believe.
Motors are rated in KV. rpm per volt. 230kv = 230rpm for each volt applied to the motor.
Realistically the only way to control the rpm of the motor is to regulate the amount of voltage that is applied to it.
This is what Esc's do. The Vesc is an Esc that was designed for e-boards. Though it has many more bells and whistles than the average car esc, it still has to regulate voltage to the motor just like any other Esc.
I know that the Vesc has amperage limit settings. That means that if you overload the motor, the Vesc will shut down.
The current limiting are safety features. The amount of load on the motor dictates the amount of current on the circuit.
This theory I have tested first hand.

The amp limits on the vesc don't shut it down just limit.  Temp limits shut it down
The vesc is known as current controlled meaning it applies the current based on throttle. That's all I know about it

Have you tested that theory and proven it to be true?
A theory has to be proven to become a fact.
Besides, current does not determine the rpm of the motor. Voltage does.

That control mode is not a theory, it's the way Benjamin has designed the VESC. Please have a look here, under "Application Configuration": http://vedder.se/2015/01/vesc-open-source-esc/

I took a look at the article you posted. It does appear to support what your saying.
So, keeping the voltage full and constant and limiting the flow of current to the motor.
This seems like an odd way to control the rpm of the motor.

Geez guys,  a lot of back and forth here since last night. :smile:

Some great info here!  A couple things are over my head at this point.  I'll have to read up on a few of these links.  It certainly seems like an amp meter will be a good way to compare my 12S with the PRO4's 10S.  I'll look into that some more too.

@Namasaki, I don't have experience with anything besides the VESC but I can say I'm a HUGE fan of the FOC mode.  It's super quiet! 

Also, just a quick update on the build.  I swapped out the 50 degree front baseplate for a randal 42.  It already feels more stable.  Testing out some new tail lights too.

Ok, I'm convinced now. Sounds like a good thing, full voltage at all times and adjustable current.
And I thought all Esc's where the same. Guess I was Wrong!
I have put in my order for 2 Vesc's. I just have to try it now.

Yes, it's going to be a total make over with everything tucked neatly inside a low profile enclosure that I got from Psychotiller. 
And the concept of supplying constant full voltage to the motors while  controlling the current flow selectively throughout the entire system is absolutely amazing! 
I can see now why everyone is so stoked over this thing.

I got my board built and it kicks ass. I have two toro beast 1/5 200amp esc with two batteries 6s @ 6100mah batteries wired to produce 12s @ 50 volts give or take. 

It is super efficient, never gets hot, climbs hills with ease, and I physically slung a wheel off when testing it face up! 

I didn't tell my true weigh, I am retired AirForce AFSOC, I weigh 290pounds+ muscle trust me! and the board moves me like I am a rag doll. I tested it for months now and  I will post a video displaying its power! The beautiful thing is it all so controllable. 

I took your advice on the batteries! However I still purchased two robust reasonable esc's  I could find of a 1/5 nature. My degree is in aviation I put those skills to use with what know about electronics and hi fi stereo. Its best to put pure clean power through electronics i.e. more than what the hub motors can handle and fine tune the ESC's -- the results are amazing. 

I call it the beast because it looks crude, ugly, and alpha male. 


Later Big C!
