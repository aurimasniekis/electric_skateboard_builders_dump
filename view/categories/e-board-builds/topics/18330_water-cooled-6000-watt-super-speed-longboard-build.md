@Chris22 I love to see this creativity, and the liquid-cooled concept is awesome! However, with 10S and a 730KV motor you're looking at a top speed of around 116 MPH... you won't have any torque at ridable speeds (in theory, by all means test it!)

Interested to see how she turns out!

Seems like a lot of torque for a single wheel.  Have you done any calculations on the static friction of urethane on asphalt?  When I was designing my board, I used the torque calculations to derive a maximum force.  This force needs to be less than the force of static friction, or you'll get wheel slippage

My motor is about 1/2 as powerful as your T20, and it already has enough torque to run over small mammals and climb vertical walls. This thing is gonna be a monster! Good luck


P.S. HobbyKing lists a max voltage of 11S, but perhaps yours is a different model?

I am going to put a huge heatsink and fan on it. I also am keeping the cable length between the batteries and ESC as well as the ESC to Motor as short as possible.

I notice that not everyone realises how important this can be. I have noticed that if you keep the cable lengths short the ESC is fine. I think its because the voltage spikes being higher in longer cables.

By the time I am ready for testing I will likely have already purchased a VESC already in the event I blow the ESC i am using now.

No I have already tested it with a previous project using only a closed loop system. Basically a small radiator with a fan on the back that pulls the heat out of the water. If i have to I might add an inline electric chiller using small 12v chilling plates. It will depend on season as well. In fall and spring I will be okay for sure because the air going through the rad is so cold. In the dead of summer I probably have to avoid riding it hard.

I plan on installing a temperature sensor. I will program it with an Arduino Nano to control the water pump speed and fan speed to regulate the water temp. As well as an alarm when it hits a dangerous number.

I have built a few E-vehicles and I am currently working on my first electric longboard.

For my electric skateboard I decided to use a higher KV motor (720kv) that pulls 128A and runs 12s. This will give me a lot of RPM. 
I have started to design a reduction system to drop the RPM from 30,000 rpm to around 5,000 rpm. With my gear reduction I should get around 7.5 ft-lbs for torque. 
The motor is over 6000 watts, and water cooled. Turnigy T20 .
 I am going to use Turnigy k force 120A hv esc that I have used to run this motor in the past. Mostly because I have it lying around. I will eventually switch to the VESC because of the improved start up torque and more advanced setting for regenerative braking. The motor I am using is a 4 pole motor with a ERPM of (720KV)* (12S * 4.2V)*(2 Pole pairs) = 72,576 Max ERPM
We will see if it this ESC can handle the load, might not. I will work out the electrical and mechanical efficiency to see how bad it is. I know with the added reduction I will have some mechanical losses but hopefully not a ridiculous amount.
I am running 90mm wheels. I would have liked to go to a 7:1 reductions but I am starting out with a 6:1 due to space limitations. I am using a two stage system. 
A pulley mounted on the wheel will be driven by a pulley mounted to a small 3/8" OD jackshaft bolted to the rear truck. 
I am using roller bearings to hold the shaft, which are rated at 650 lbs and 29,500 rpm. 
I will use a hardened shaft so it can take the load. 
The other side of the jack shaft will have my second reduction which I have already purchase. 
This reduction is a set of high load 20 degree pressure angle spur gears at 2:1 reduction (24 to 48 tooth). The 24 tooth is mounted to my motor; the 48 tooth is on the jack shaft.
I have to make sure I can still adjust the belt tension, or alternatively add a belt tensioner as an add on.
That’s basically my gearing plan. I might weld a small SS box around the gears after I am happy with it and fill this with grease or oil; otherwise my only concern is that the gears are going to get HOT.
The motor I think i can keep cool with the water jacket. I have used this motor on a BAJA 5T before and I still have the small radiator/fan and water pump i used as a closed loop cooling system on that project. I am going to use a similar system here.
Preliminary results from my spreadsheet I used for speed Calcs below.

The Board I am using is a Step Deck that is very big. I wanted it to be stable. I added ½” rubber risers because I like how they smooth out the ride. The radiator will be mounted as I show in the pictures on top of the rear truck with the fan drawing air out of the back side.

Yes that is the radiator. I am going to use the read truck bolts as mounts. I also don't want it too far from the motor so I dont have long water lines between the two. This will help the pump.

Jmasta,

I know it seems like a lot of torque. I have the startup set to super soft. I am hoping that is enough to not spin the wheel. I also have very very sticky wheels. They are not hard urethane. I think they are 83a hardness.

Correct the Turnigy T20 is an 11S motor, but I have ran in with 12S in the past and never had an issue. Most of the engineers will design a motor with a safety factor. They can take slightly more voltage most of the time. 1S more is not enough to kill the motor in my experience and lowers the amp draw.

11S is such as strange battery size to find anyway. I would guest most people not wanting to test the limits of the motor would run 10s.

Yeah cable length does make a difference. I just chimed in because I've had a couple of those esc's self destruct. And the brakes are pretty dangerous.

My original plan on my first build was to use an in runner. Now I kind of want to revisit that after reading through your setup. Have you thought about using a planetary gearbox??? I have a 6:1 gearbox from reisenauer on my airplane and it's pretty small although only rated to 3kw

PXSS,

I saw similar planetary gearboxes but they have similar max power outputs. I was worried that 6000+ watts would be too much. Also there might be a RPM limit to that gearbox that is too low. It would help make the design a lot more compact.

Still waiting on parts for the rear gear reduction assembly. In the meantime here are my lights. I have a small switch mounted on the underside to turn on/off.

These are 6watt LED bars. See the second image for a closeup when off.

I added these to help me not get hit by a car this summer. They are a little brighter than anticipated but  I think it looks pretty cool. I am excited to ride it at night like this.

Hey Chris that looks awesome! Those 6W LED strips are actually exactly the same thing I use on the sides of my board! They looks awesome at night time! 

Also you might want to look into these 15W LED Headlights to mount in the front of your board. I'm using 10W versions and there great but there just not bright enough to really make to big of a difference, these 15W ones though are really bright and will be way better! And also there obviously not 15W they only draw like 60-90mA from what I remember.

They also sell red 10W LED versions of you want to put lights on the rear as well. I used like wire clip type things to attach them to the front of my board, I'll attach of what I mean below. Also the placement of the LED's doesn't really matter, there purely aesthetic so wherever looks cooler.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/2/2266a750dd42642af2bf013f525ecdd7c8d1cbcd.jpg" width="690" height="388">

## \#33 Posted by: HTownBomber Posted at: 2017-03-10T18:41:35.834Z Reads: 276

```
Typically a Battery Eliminator Circuit (BEC) is used to step down to 12V (or 5V for the receiver).  They are readily available at RC parts stores.  SBEC or UBEC (I forget the difference).

Hey @Freddiecook, like @HTownBomber said people use UBEC's or Buck Converters to get 12, 5 or whatever voltage you need. If your only using a 8S> battery pack then I would recommend using just a normal LM2596 Buck converter because there really cheap and can handle up to about an amp and half. If your using above 8S like 10 or 12S, you'll need to find an UBEC that can convert that high voltage (around 50V) down to your needed voltage range. But whatever you do, DONT USE A LINEAR REGULATOR, there extremely inefficient and create tons of heat.

I don't like that method.  I prefer to use a dedicated 12v battery.  Bec are not efficient when you go from 40v to 12v, and I don't like having anything but the Esc drawing current from the main battery pack.
