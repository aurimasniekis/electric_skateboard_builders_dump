Hey Guys. I'm a brand new e-boarder. Got my very first last month. I have the Enertion Raptor dual. I decided I loved everything about it an want to make an attempt at putting something together myself. I've never done any soldering in my life. So hopefully that's something I can learn fairly easy. Just need to know what else I will need to know and what kind of wire, connectors, ect... That I will need to be able to complete this project. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!!!
 
This is what I have ordered so far...

2 x 190KV Enertion R-Spec Motors 6355
2 x 9mm Wide Enertion Drive Pulley Kit
2 x Enertion Motor Mounts 
1 x SPACE CELL PRO ENCLOSURE (Soon to be a Master Cho Carbon Fiber enclosure)
1 x Chi Boards Battery 10S4P
2 x NEW: Vesc-X Motor Controllers
2 x Caliber 2 Trucks
1 x Loaded Tesseract
Abec 11 83mm 75a Flywheels

Did you order the Space Cell Pro 3? Or did you buy the enclosure and battery separately? The SCP3 comes together as a complete package with bms, voltmeter, power switch, and charge port. If you bought them separately you'll have to get those as well. Also the battery pack won't fit into the enclosure as nicely since it's grooved for 18650 cells.

Soldering isn't too hard, just watch a couple soldering 101 videos on youtube. It's not hard to make a good solder joint, but it's easy to make a bad one. Invest in a decent soldering iron and solder. I recommend a soldering station from Hakko, Weller, or other reputable brand. 60/40 tin/lead rosin-core solder is always a good bet.

You'll probably need some miscellaneous connectors and wire, just mock up everything you have and see what you're missing. Keep in mind your VESCs don't come with any connectors. You'll also need a dremel or hacksaw to cut some of your caliber truck's hangar unless you bought the trucks from Enertion assuming you're using Enertion's wheel pulleys.

I actually have 2 Raptor batteries. I'm just assumed that's a space cell 3 battery? That's why I just bought the enclosure because I thought the raptor battery should fit right in it. It does have the switch, charging port, ect... so I won't need to mess with any of that at least. I figured I would either velcro or glue it to the enclosure. 

Yep. I have a dremel and plan on making them work with the Enertion whell pulleys. @longhairedboy has a video that shows exactly how to do it. :slight_smile:

I'm definitely going to be watching some youtube how to's on soldering. ;)

The problem I'm having is figuring out what wires I will need, what size wires, connectors, ect... I just made the big order this morning so I wanted to order the rest this afternoon so that I would have everything needed asap.

Cool that should work then. You may want to take the raptor batteries out of their plastic housing in order to fit it more nicely. Glue or velcro would work and is what I do myself.

Make sure you take enough off the hangar (42mm should be good). Taking too little may look like it'll fit, but the nylon may not engage with the thread. I've actually had my wheel come off my board while riding due to this..

10/12 AWG cable is a standard for esk8 (I use 12 myself) and you can't go wrong with 4/5.5mm bullets and XT60/90's.

Sweet. I'll take the plastic off the battery for sure then. 

Thanks for the exact mm measurement of the hanger that I need to take off. Definitely don't want a wheel coming off when I'm riding. 

Ordering 12 AWG cable, 5.5mm bullets, along with some XT90's right now. Thanks!

Don't forget shrink tube for those bullets and some flux. Go for xt60 connectors.

Female bullets should be included with the motors, having spares doesn't hurt

Do you have a remote on your list?

Ok cool. I'll order the xt60's then and also some shrink tube. Is there a difference that I should know about between xt60 and xt90?

I do have an awesome remote already. @FLATLINEcustoms made it with his enclosure and a gt2b.

Xt90 are much bigger and all the components you've ordered are Xt60. You'll need to make an "Y" connector out of 1 male XT60 male and 2 XT60 female (to connect from battery to 2 vesc)

Hey guys. So it looks like my motors, motor mounts, enclosure, and wheel pulley systems will arrive here on Monday. So I want to get ordering all the wire and stuff I need asap. I am ordering 5.5 bullet connectors, xt60 male/female connectors, 12 gauge wire so far. Happy Thanksgiving guys!!!

What are these? Looks like they're on some kinda board. And what are those black and white wires called? I want to get the same things that I have in my raptor because I love the shit out of it. I've already ordered everything from Enertion to make my own. Just need to know what everything wiring wise is. @onloop?

The arrows point to the capacitors on your VESC's.  your VESC-x will have them inside.  The black an white wires are the communication CAN connection between your master and slave VESC.  I would ask @onloop what connector to get for the VESC-X.

Gotta question guys. Would this be possible??? Could I just buy a second receiver for my gt2b remote to put in my new board I'm building? That way instead of having two separate remotes I could just use the one? Or is the deal when it binds to one receiver it won't bind to another? Just a thought I had that could simplify things a bit.

P.S- I just got my two motors, space cell case, motor mounts, and pulley systems yesterday. I have a local hobby shop that carries the xt60's, bullet connectors, wiring, ect... that I already picked up also. Just waiting for the vesc-x's to ship after the 30th. Hopefully they don't take too long. I want to build this thing and see how it goes!

[/quote]

no can't do that, you have two options to control both motors with 1 receiver.

Have your VESCX in a master-slave config like your current raptor with a CAN bus cable.

http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/canbus-connector-for-vedder-s-motor-controller
OR
diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-canbus-connector/

your second option is to control each vescx independently with the same PPM signal using a Y cable like this one, you'll need to cut the red cable off one of them

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/futaba-y-servo-lead-15cm-length-5pcs-bag.html 

For powering both vesc, you'll need to make a Y connector, like this 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/xt60-y-connector-jig/13497?u=blasto

just put a male XT60 at the end of the cable to connect to the space cell.

Get some good solder and get some flux, it will make your life much easier.

I have pretty much everything now. Just waiting for the vesc-x's to ship and the the ollin board canbus connectors to ship also. Going to pick out a deck this weekend along with some calibur trucks at my local longboard shop. This is going to be fun. I want to build this and ride it for a while before my Raptor 2 gets her in however long it takes.

Question for you guys. Do any of you know where I can pick up the round piece of plastic that's around the power button and the charger cover thingy. And what are they called? This is the space cell pro 4. I want to make mine just like this so I'm guessing I will have to take my spare raptor battery apart to do so.

Did it. Works great while testing. Just need to bolt down the enclosure, put my black 100mm MBS wheels on, then paint the trucks and motor mounts black. First build turned out great so far.

few days, let's say 3 to 4 maximum. My mate Benjy deals with the shipping the same day. We just even basically ship ASAP; in 99% it's within the next hour after the order. The giveaway dual mount I did one month ago was shipped to Canada and @i2oadsweepei2 got it in like 3 days. I was quite amazed as it's faster to ship worldwide... than locally in France!

So ordering now and your package is shipped in less than 1 hour with tracking.

Yep. But this deck has a lot more going on than just bamboo. I think the fiberglass is where the stiff part comes into play. 

"The Tesseract is made out of fiberglass with epoxy skins sandwiched between two vertically-laminated bamboo cores. Then Loaded went ahead and covered the bottom of the board with a nice layer of cork, to help absorb the shock and moisture."

It's the same setup as the space cell pro. Though I'd recommend getting steel rivets instead of aluminum like I linked since a couple of my aluminum ones stripped. It's a great solution with the downside of having the rivets show up on the top side.

If you drill a wider hole (size of the rivet head) just a few millimeters into the first hole (first hole should be 4-4.5mm) you can have the entire rivet sitting inside the board and just throw grip tape over it. Clean!

BTW that master cho enclosure is looking super slick

Hey guys. It's me again. Upgraded my board once again. This thing will always be a work in progress. Got a question for you guys. 

How do you guys have enough room to run dual motors with 12mm belts with caliber 2 trucks? I have a 15mm wheel pulleys form here http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/40t-abec-flywheel-mbs-all-terrain-pulley-still-available-motor-pulley-out-of-stock/16586 and some 16 tooth motor pulleys from diyboards. The motors barely have room between each other and the axle nuts barely have one thread by the time they are tight as fuck. Any suggestions?  

Here's some pics of what I'm talking about.

doesn't need extended trucks, pulleys are on backwards. adjust that and you can move the mounts further apart

Are they??? Which pulleys are on backwards? If there are, I think I smoked too much. Lol.

yea, flip the motor pulleys around and move the mounts further apart/closer to each wheel, you'll have enough space for both motors.

An other problem you might have are the 15mm wheelpulleys. My 12mm do barely fit, because, depending on what hardware you use for these mounts, these get close to touch the wheelpulleys if you take the mounts further out.
But seems like yours are really flat and you should have a little bit of space left?

Hi! Are that receiver and antenna should be so close to the vescs? I thought it should be far as possible from vescs and high current cables.

Sorry for the long delay in response. I've heard about trying to keep the receiver as far away from the vescs as possible, but I haven't had any issues having it like this. The GT2B is pretty flawless as far as I've never had it cut out once.

I am building a bord with the same board and enclosure. However I am almlst done but I can’t make it fit under the trucks without going with 2cm ground clearance. I have the tourqueboard motor mounts and they seem to not work with this build. Any ideas on how to fix it? What mounts did you use? :)

I use the motor mounts. They have been working great. But it looks like he's out of stock now. http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/pulleys-out-of-stock/16586
