Buy them from amazon US, no import fees and overall cheaper.

Hey nice for the help what i mean with the Caliber Mount is the motor mount, and the reason I wan't the 6355 motor is so im able to upgrade to a dual motor at som point, but I do not know if that's a smart move??? but I think i'll stil go for the Orangatang kegel wheels, but if you know a place where I can get a Pully in metal for the Orangatang kegel wheels that will be nice, and I will definitely go for the Caliber Trucks Cal II 50 you sendt so (ty)

Oh ok

A metal kegel pulley is hard to find with your budget :frowning:

You also mentioned two bearings in your first post.

Single 6355 might be alright but it might struggle with hills and breaking.

Your deck is a large portion of your budget, maybe you can find a good deal on a deck somewhere?

That was a shame, and there are in total 9 bearings because 2 in all wheels and 1 in the pully right? and yes the deck is expensive, so if you know a nice deck that don't bend a lot well it be nice??

I don't know about the deck but I would look around on ebay or something like that, some good deals there.

Oh forgot about the pulley bearing.

You could get the same VESC from aliexpress for a little cheaper if you can wait.
