Long story short. Started seeing a few Evolve's around, even rode past a few on my bike, looked like fun. Begun investigating what other options were around and must have stumbled across this forum. Thought about it a bit and figured building a board would be half the fun, so why buy something off the shelf.

Anyway some of the bits are starting to come in so may as well start a build thread. Still haven't ordered everything, in fact I'm still undecided on most components. I did a few semesters worth of electronics back in university, but that's going back some time now... If it looks like I'm about to screw something up, it'd be great to know about it beforehand 😉.

Arrived home tonight to find a box of batteries waiting for me.

That's 24 A123 26650 batteries welded up in a 12s2p configuration by [Marsen (Aus)](http://marsen.com.au/). Really didn't want to buy a spot welder, so was pretty happy to find they offered a pack assembly service. Voltage for each cell group checks out at 3.3v, which is probably a good charge level for them to sit at while I get everything else together.

There's a 2mm gap between each cell, while this is probably good from a cooling perspective it means I have a little less space to work with across the board. Might look at removing the hot glue and closing up these gaps 🤔.

The battery tabs are probably 8mm wide, and fairly thin although doubled up. Wondering if it's worthwhile soldering some copper wire across the top?

Six months later and it's kind of looking like an electric skateboard 😂.

Bolted the drive system together just to see if everything fit. Need to pull it all apart again so if it looks like something is way out of alignment, it probably is.

Parts list
- Trampa 37 tooth slave pulley x2
- Trampa centring ring x2 (I had these anodised black)
- APS 130kv 6455 sensored motors
- APS 15t motor pulleys
- Stack of black bolts from [AccuGroup](http://accu.co.uk/)
- [E-Toxx Street Carver mounts](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/sold-e-toxx-dual-motormounts-for-trampa-street-carver-idler-cf-braces/35858) (had these anodised black too)

Few issues. 
- For whatever reason my Trampa didn't come with any of the little spacers for the axles, as a result the slave pulleys tighten into the mount. I'll rig up something. I didn't get a 'Trampa' sticker for that matter either😭.
- Circlip on the 10m APS shaft is uncomfortably close to the mount. Will grind down the two little loops you'd use to open it. Just need another 0.5mm clearance.
- The 'collar' on the 10mm bore motor pulley is too thick for the gap in the motor mount. I could leave this flipped (as shown above), but will probably find some creative way to machine it down without a lathe. Would Like to run some larger wheels later on, so I'd prefer not to have this sticking out.

Excluding the BMS, which is on its way from Rome now, I think I've finally got all the bits needed to finish this thing off.

Thanks! 

The enclosure is certainly no secret, it even got its own [somewhat obscurely titled build thread](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/polyurethane-battery-enclosure-bad-idea/24480/6).

The inner mould is really designed around my a123 26650 12s2p battery pack, so I'm not sure if it'd be much use to anyone else. The battery segments are each 30mm deep, you could fit one row of 18650's, but not two, and then you'd be limited to a 8s4p setup 👎.

Would like to see Trampa work on its options here. Not a fan of the cut up Trampa battery tray, or the battery boxes they mount over the rear wheels. Functionally I'm sure both are fine, just the aesthetics (and having to cut that Trampa material), but it's pretty subjective so...

Nice build, loved this new aproach to making and enclosure

Did you end up reinforcing the connection of the cell with a cooper wire? I highly recommend, theses batteries can deliver a ton of current, even more since you are using 2P, but if you try with these 2 nickel tabs I can almost guarantee that something will melt

According to a topic in endless sphere, each 7mm nickel can handle 10A getting a little bit warm, so for your battery 20A, these cells can supply 100A, if not more

Yes, but I'm still not particularly happy with it...

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/b/eba347c958a003300a851716b504b3284617f790.png" width="611" height="499">

The nickel is bowel upward as I needed to reduce the space between each cell otherwise each row of 6 was too wide for the deck (these came welded together). Tempted to pull the whole thing apart and solder the 10awg wire directly to each cell.

FWIW I'll be running a 70amp fuse, and will be setting each vesc to pull 30a or less (that's still 30a per cell!). First esk8, I really don't need it to be fast right now. The risk is I get comfortable on it, and start wanting to push the power limit later on.

I see, it’s better than the original for sure, what I usually do is to strip que insulation completely, this way you have more contact area, it could help in your case 

The best test you can do is ride it hard and put you finger on the connection, if it’s not burning hot it’s probably ok

Also by the looks of it is seems that you need a more power when soldering to evenly distribute the tin

Agreed, although this wasn't the final state (added more solder/balance wires). My soldering iron heats up to 480degC but still seems to lack outright power and thermal mass to do these big wires well.

I've got four 100w resistors I'll rig up into a circuit to test this initially. For this pack (approx 40v) they'll only be able to dissipate 10a max though, hardly a thorough test. Still looking out for other ways to bench test.

Try a hair dryer, most of them work fine in DC, you may need to parallel more than one to get the power a lower voltage. Or use a shower heating element. Unwind the nichorme wire and a cut it were you have the appropriated resistance, if it burns out out it in the air you may need to throw in the water

So I did a few battery pack load tests; results can be found over in the [other thread](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/load-testing-discharging-a-custom-battery-pack/2888/27). Everything checks out ok up to a 6a continuous drain, which admittedly isn't high.

Now for the big news... well for me anyway. For the last 7 months or so it's just been an inanimate object sitting in the corner. Last weekend I finally plugged it all up and got the motors spinning.

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bexc23dlySG

Amazingly it even worked first time; FOC, hall sensors, all checked out. The only issue being I had the VESC plugged into channel 1 on the receiver when it should have been 2; that was a anxious minute or two 😬. One of the VESCs seem a little bit temperamental as to whether it will connect to the VESC Tool or not; often requires restarting the VESC Tool/VESC itself and or plugging in/ unplugging the USB. Couldn't find a reliable process, but was never unable to connect given enough messing about.

VESC Tool itself was really quite nice. Stepped through the wizards and had everything going in minutes.

Just waiting on a few parts from Shapeways so I can tidy things up and bolt it all together.

Shapeways order came in. They had the print done inside a week, but it took UPS 3 weeks to ship it down here. Took the day off work yesterday to try and get this finished up.

All the CAD/STLs can be found in [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/lachlanhurst/locks-esk8/tree/master/cad). They're all pretty specific to my build, but I'm happy for anyone to do what they want with them.

![IMG_2037 (1)|478x500](upload://muDZprQB1q5cB2tCZ2WpjrvhS2T.png)

Mount for the display and power button. Figured that in future the power button may be used to do more than simply switch the board on and off, hence why I wanted both the display and power button close. Packaging becomes an issue which is why both the display and button are angled like the are. Besides this angle makes it more perpendicular to your eye when standing on it.

![image|690x459](upload://c2s13iJY0KRwa6EQDxoEKCdpAVT.jpg)

The top of the button is recessed into the mount, and the button itself needs to be pressed in 3mm or so. Furthermore you need to hold down the power button for a few seconds to turn the DieBieMS off. I'm not particularly worried about accidentally turning it off with my foot.


![IMG_2034|522x500](upload://vqwOE6cIkDhTnejJLScwqn6fIDl.png)

Gets pretty busy back there. Had to drill a 13mm hole through the deck as the power button extends below the surface a bit. This was one of 3 designs, first would have required digging out too much of the deck, and I didn't like the mount hole locations in the other (although it did integrate the charge port).

Pretty happy with how the charge plug worked out, despite spending very little time on it's design.

The DieBieMS got some love with it's own box.
![IMG_2029|581x500](upload://4SATyIRvxwBlwh8NTKbLvtcrtfN.png)

Spent like 10hours or so yesterday finishing everything up, it was quite the PITA getting all the cables connected and routed out the back. Anyway, think it's finished now. . . well as finished as these things get. Writing up this post to kill some time for the Loctite to cure, wheels spin but it's not been ridden yet.

Nah, senior moment was all mine, was going to include the link but just forgot to add it (now edited).

Quick note on the display/switch mount. It's designed to have a 1.5mm thick clear acrylic sheet glued in before you screw in the display (which has it's own approx 1.5mm glass sheet over the oled). The idea was to protect the display a bit more, but it also pushes back the display PCB allowing a bit more thickness for the screws to tap into.

BMS+box slots into one of the moulded gaps in my enclosure. When I designed the enclosure I was going to do it in carbon fibre, the polyurethane ended up being quite a bit thicker and as a result everything is a little bit cramped.

Rode a few kms yesterday, motor mount quickly rattled loose (no Loctite). Seems ok on this mornings ride to the tram stop. Currently tweaking spring settings and battling with the whole 'tight = cant turn' / 'loose = speed wobbles'. Oh, and it feels like there's a bunch of muscles in my lower legs that need to be developed, or I need to relax (prob both) :joy:.

It's running Hall sensors, and the throttle is really quite well behaved. Rolling down and up the driveway...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt1clR4v88Q

These are the 83mm Trampa wheels, would have gone for the 90mm but they were out of stock at the time. Seems to make for a rough ride over expansion gaps in bike paths. New (bigger) wheels were always a part of the plan, just tossing up how big / or even pneumatic. 🤔

There’s a bunch of stuff I messed up, it kind of sucks that you get better at this stuff the further through your build. Soldering for example, all joins are pretty good now, the first ones I was doing less so. As for the Loctite, after months of not much progress I reckon I rushed things a little.

This is good to know. Was tempted to step straight to the 107’s, but worried it may be overkill. It’s pretty heavy already so what’s a little more.

@Nowind obviously I won’t switch the hanger around, but do the Street Carver mounts work with the bigger Trampa wheels (urban treads, gummies)?

Gummies will work, depending on Wheelpulley size without the Idler.
@gogomrrobot is running Gummies with this mounts... maybe he can give you advice too

Question of bigger Wheels is always to see in complete Setup details... for example my Carver with 107mm Abecs, 15/40 Gearing, 170kv Motors in Sensor mode is absolutely sweet spot for mine.

The BMS box was a bit rushed TBH, excess holes as I didn’t quite have the cable routing figured. The holes are extra large too as I wanted to fit the ring terminals through them, really these should be smaller with slots down from the top. If you scrapped he holes, and put your own in to suit... then it’d be an ‘ok’ design.

Display and power button wires (all 8 of them) run from this box through the rear truck, then up through the deck. Installation is a bit of a PITA. Next time I’d go for connectors (for everything) at the enclosure.

I’ve got quite the network of bike paths accessible from just down the road. Could literally cruise for a 100km without needing to go on a road. Only problem is these concrete paths have those gaps in them, and with the 83mm wheels it’d make a horrible thud over every one. Kind of thuds that would undoubtedly result in something breaking.

Incidentally mounts have been rock solid since Loctite 👍. Even with this torture.

Anyway, got some ABEC 107s and they’re not coming off 😂
![image|656x500](upload://u7bijxe6Xq5oW5b6dZFiyFZp7Ba.jpeg)

Still get the thuds, but it’s more just a noise instead of a hard jolt. It’s quite happy on the bike paths now. 

Seems to roll a lot easier now. Purchased some bearings off eBay, also a section of aluminium tubing to cut my own bearing support spacers. Could be these, or could just be the taller gearing.

Still using the 15-37 combo (130kv motors), and still happy with the acceleration. I’d like to find some nice aluminium  44t 15mm aluminium pulleys, but they seem ‘rare as hens teeth’.

Other general esk8 remarks. 12yo boy yelled out the other night “hey mister, that thing you’re riding is really cool”. Then today I think I got snap chatted by some teen as I cruised past, possible for ridicule value, but whatever 😉. 

Turning is still tough, but getting better. Counterintuitively, slowing down through turns seems to result in a larger turning radius as you can’t lean in as much.

Oh, I weighed it too.
![image|375x500](upload://jKRnR5w446AZJup3U4Zof5TSqRh.jpeg)

10.7kg, probably 12kg with the new wheels.

Maybe, but with the cads you gave it can be customised to need, the overall case is really nicely proportioned and seals correctly which is great, mine sucked. I'm going to xt60 a version (height)and do something to seal the balance leads a bit better since it won't be enclosed in my application

Pulled the board apart today. I've probably done 30km or so, just wanted to see if anything undesirable was occurring internally. All wiring checked out, nothing loose, so seems all good.

I've charged it a couple times, but made sure never to let the BMS balance. Wanted to see how much drift I was getting in the cells...

... not much it turns out.

Finally found a use for my ST-LINK clone; programming some NRF51 modules. It's a Bluetooth module like the HM10, just a little different and with support built into the latest VESC Tool. All the detail you could possibly want is in [Vedder's GitHub repo](https://github.com/vedderb/nrf51_vesc). I wired up two, but only because I cut the wires too short on the first 😏.

![IMG_2092|375x500](upload://xUgIBJrKuAY9Pn0sYjYOMh0Ywj7.jpg)

Bluetooth support in the VESC Tool currently seems limited to the Linux build. Ubuntu running on MacOS inside a parallels VM apparently doesn't get access to the inbuilt BTLE hardware, so I picked up a cheap $5 Bluetooth 4.0 module off eBay.

Amazingly it worked first time. It's plugged up to the slave VESC in my setup, enabling CAN forward to `0` gives access to the master. Not having to undo the 30 screws and find a USB cable to tweak my VESCs is rather nice.

There's now a VESC Tool build for Android that would work with the module, unfortunately there's not a single Android device in the house. An iOS build, despite it being built in cross platform Qt, seems like a non-trivial exercise😞. <s>I have doubts that other apps would work with this module.</s>

**Edit: no I was wrong, the [eSkate VESC app](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-version-2-1-ios-eskate-vesc-app-for-standard-and-ackmaniac-fw/32340) works fine.**

I'm old enough, and know what hitting the pavement feels like, so I'm really not keen on pushing much past 25km/h. Makes it tough trying to find out what the board can do. There's a nice little circuit in a park not far from home, it's got a short but sharp little climb, figured I'd see if I could max it out.

Strava's great for finding this sort of thing.
![image|690x485](upload://smLwQABB7LyU6S8a64kwjKnROch.jpg)

This is the corresponding set of data for that section of the ride.
![image|690x170](upload://m1FyHuv8pdZNrFm5FGjlXyO1uBH.png)

It's only for one VESC, but assuming the others the same I still only managed a max of 20a out of the battery. Turns out simply standing on a board going up that kind of grade gets a bit tricky 😂, especially when there's tight bend on the steep bit.

Checked the motors and enclosure for excessive heat but neither felt much above ambient. Not that I'd expect them to be hot after a 20a discharge.

Actually it was pretty good. Yesterdays ride was about 15km, which took me down below 50% charge. Starting voltage was 39.9v, and final voltage was 39.3v. If I was relying on voltage alone I'd never know how much charge I had left until it was too late.

I've still got the yellow dampas in there, springs in outer position on rear, inner up front. Spring adjusters wound to about deck level. Just only starting to get the hang of turning now, heel side I'm ok, toe side not so good. Tempted to try without dampas, but I'll stick with them for now and see how I progress. Carving was feeling more natural and much less awkward today, legs seem to not get as tired either.

20km ride today, and probably would have gone further if I had the range. Probably could have squeezed another 5km out, but didn't feel the need to push it. Got up a little over 30km/h, and felt fairly comfortable. It's releasing the throttle after acceleration I have to watch out for; letting the trigger go (not applying breaks, just neutral) pushes weight forward and can induce some wobbles. Need to make a conscious effort to back it off slowly.

Battery max of 37a (across 2 vescs) from short acceleration getting back towards home. Expected hill climbing would suck down a few amps, but 20-25a seem to be enough to get me up a 3% hill at decent speed.

Still never applied full throttle, but it's oh so tempting 😂.

Seeing about 4.2v sag pulling 47.8a out of the battery, or about 0.35v per cell. From the specs (a123 26650, 2p) and discharge tests I've seen, this was pretty much to be expected.

![image|690x257](upload://nC4IHw03f3vJ5NkZgEA1I1SHPtI.png)

Can understand why voltage sag is frowned upon, kind of makes it feel like the board struggles a bit. Struggle isn't quite the right word though, it was still capable of accelerating up the rather steep hill faster than I was comfortable with. Max duty cycle was around 80% in the above.

It's getting dark rather early around these parts, means not a lot of riding. Need to hook up some lights. Took it out for a short spin the other day and managed to hit the 95% duty cycle. Was going up a decent hill so the voltage sag knocked a few km/h off the speed. Max power across both VESCs was about 1700w this ride.

Max duty cycle is an interesting point. The board got there with me holding the throttle to about 65%, then it stops accelerating so you pull the trigger some more, but the board just doesn't go any faster. 

![image|685x330](upload://thFtwy30KXcTMKPf1DXsMJn0cOB.png)

So @hornet90 and @Kug3lis convinced me to drop the dampas. I just assumed the dampas were a fairly soft elastomer, but even the yellow 'soft' ones are quite a hard rubber. There really is quite a stark contrast between dampas vs no dampas. Difference in turning radius is immediately evident, I can now do a u-turn in my skinny street. On the other hand, lets just say it'll take quite a while before I'm hitting max speed again :grimacing:.

Definitely feels like there should be an intermediate offering. Will think about drilling out the dampas depending on how I get on.

I guess it is all weight and terrain dependent, but the yellow dampas added much needed stability to my board. I ran without dampas first, but often had speed wobbles at around 30 km/h. With dampas I can reach full speed on pavement and off-road/around 46 km/h. I have to work the board harder but I have no issues carving or turning (only at low speed).

Yeah, unfortunately I think it'll be a compromise. Finding some middle ground between high speed stability, and making it round the turns I'd like to. In my short no dampa test ride I didn't venture above 15-20km/h. Need to see how (if) I can deal with the increased responsiveness.

I read some time ago that drilling holes vertically makes them bit more squishier  so I have mad some holes in yellow dampas but at the moment everything is mounted on urban carver, and urban carver for me is more than stable compared to my full eMtb

P.S. From my understanding front is more important in turning. But back also contributes, I was riding inner position and with yellow dampas, back without dampas so at higher speed I felt my back bit wobbly :)

Speed wobbles actually start in both trucks and you amplify them, becoming part of the system. 
The more relaxed you are, the less issues you have.
Fear makes you stiffer in your legs, your body is trying to work against board movements rather than going with them. In consequence it is working as an amplifier of truck resonances. The more relaxed your ankles become, the better.
Dampas reduce wobble a lot but will decrease turning radius. So it's a matter of finding the correct balance. I can hit 35km/h without any dampas, springs in inner position. In outer position 40+ is fine for me, with dampas some riders hit 50-60 km/h. I don't think the fun of riding the carver is in the top speed, but rather in the carving and accelerating out of turns. It should be easy to find a nice setup matching your ride style. Once the board becomes part of yourself, you will feel a lot more comfortable at higher speeds. Trying different setups will help you to understand your board a lot better. I highly recommend to experiment a bit. Always apply a good portion of spring pre-tension. Inner position: Adjuster flush with deck as minimum.

Stay safe, ride with protective gear and clear of any obstacles, pedestrians and cars! Reduce your speed to your personal abilities. Get yourself informed about the legal situation in your country/region.

Ok, so turns out it didn't take too long at all to be back cruising at top speed.

![image|690x204](upload://svFyupJdOiuPX0M7ziBrGcZ6TUq.png)

Had speed wobbles a few times, usually after hitting a rock or something but also under heavy acceleration. Staying relaxed and letting the board 'wander' seems to be the trick, but of course your fighting against some natural tendencies to freeze up.

35km/h seems good to me, any faster and I'd start to get a bit more worried about consequences of coming off. The way I see it no matter how experienced you are it's highly probable you'll crash at some point. "When" not "if" as we'd used to say racing bikes. Besides I'd have to buy new pulleys, so it can stay like this for now.

Turning is really quite nice now, it just felt like hard work before. T-intersections in bike paths are a breeze at low speed, before it was a 'stop and poke the front of the board around with my foot turn'.

Think I'm a no dampa convert, but appreciate the need for those that go faster.

I reckon the next thing I try may be no dampas with springs in outer position front and back (currently outer back, inner front, no dampas). It's the front that seems to get a bit twitchy. But I'll give it time, seems ok'ish after an hour or so riding, maybe it'll be fine with a bit more practice. Pneumatics may help too, some of the hard hits seem to initiate wobbles especially when turning.

In theory springs should provide a linear force to turn relationship. Something like a dampa (or traditional skate bushing) will be non-linear, the further you turn, the harder it is to turn more. However on a Trampa you couple them both together effectively reducing the non-linearity of the dampas. Maybe what we really need is to be able to run something like dampas without the springs?

Not sure these Trampas were really designed with top speed in mind. Still plenty of fun under 40km/h.

Back outter position using same yellow hollow dampas
15 ply holy pro deck

With dampas I lost maybe 20-30% percent of turning angle can't do anymore really tight corners and U turns in two lane street but I gained stability so now I could do 50km/h and be bit more stable, second problem is now my 15 ply holy pro which yesterday at high speed started flexing on it's own... 

I have in mind making something similar to Baja board with independent suspension and use active steering damper on deck pivoting to control how easy to turn deck to stiffen on higher speeds... But it's only idea level yet.

[/quote]

Yeah, it's something @banjaxxed and I have shared a few messages over. Lightweight BajaBoard kind of thing, in dot points;

- Under 10kg
- Option to run pneumatics or urethane wheels
- Stiff chassis (CF tube construction)
- Concave / rocker (ie; nice deck shape)
- suspension designed around 165-200mm long rear MTB shocks

Would go for a single parallel suspension linkage up each end (not independent). Rear MTB shocks are designed to support half a person and this would allow 2 per board. I'd think that any truely independent suspension design would soak up steering input into its compression making it a bit sluggish. There's a build thread over on [endless-sphere](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=92253&start=25) that is a similar design (obviously I'm thinking smaller scale). Maybe reuse Trampa hangers.

One of these days I'll get some time to spend in CAD. There's a bit to go through designing proper bushings, making sure the shock leverage is ok, etc.

As much as I have done an investigation into the design, shocks have nothing much to do with turning ability. The connecting rod to the deck rotation controls it. On bajaboard it uses trampa springs with dampas to control deck turn ability so I thinking of using active steering damper in conjunction with VESC to control turnability based on speed.

Springs will bend over time doing such things. Tested already..... 
With our current gear everything is already quite adjustable and it should be easy to find a good setup that works for the average ride conditions. If you want a board that turns on a dime, you usually can accept some top speed losses. If you go for speed, you can usually accept less turning radius.
Making something that can do both, will get technically more complex and heavy.

For my my board is daily commute device, so weight and complexity is not an issue... The problem is that I am riding at bicycle highways and streets and speed is important because to ride slow for hour is not an solution and riding fast without decent stability kills my legs even with all this mileage on training...

So something stable and with really decent turn ability would be awesome but for this wide range of stuff active management is required.

There's two sets of springs on a BajaBoard; one set is part of the suspension, the other for turning. Compressing the suspension causes no turn as you'd expect, compressing the turn spring obviously does. Problem is when you shift your weight to one side that weight is supported by both the suspension spring and the turn spring; they both compress, when really as you're trying to turn you only want the turn spring to compress.

Another possible issue with independent suspension is that you'll probably see some wheel camber when the board rolls. Pneumatics would be fine with this, but you'd probably want to avoid anything apart from 0deg camber on urethane.

[/quote]

I recon there's something in this. It'd be nice to adjust stiffness and not just damping, but it would be much harder to implement the mechanical side of things. Also motorcycles only vary steering damping, so maybe it's good enough.

IMO we're making poor use of having two independently controllable driven wheels. You should (maybe? honestly NFI really) be able to dampen something like speed wobbles with torque vectoring. You may be able to detect speed wobbles with a rotary position encoder on the kingpin. Developing and testing this solution could be "fun" 😂.

As I have played with active steering dampeners, I think if used like linear one on connecting deck to wishbone for turning it would allow to control how fast/slow it can turn so at 0-15km/h I could allow it turn fully and then fully engage dampening at higher speed so you could still turn but it would be slight turns and not instant so it wouldn't cause wobbling. Thinking that even springs wouldn't be required if used steering dampeners but that's everyone on idea level, still have tons to read material to even imagine how to design this kind of stuff... I am also thinking of maybe using only single motors per wheel base and use differential and etc :D

Winter has actually been pretty good so far (little rain), still a lack of daylight and excess work means the board hasn't been out much. Once a weekend kind of thing. It's still going well, feels slower, but I'm pretty sure that's just me coming to terms with it.

A local YouTuber organised a hill climb test, and having no idea how this board performs compared to others I though it'd be interesting to see how it went. . .

https://youtu.be/T0-sMgLnPnk

Apparently slower than an evolve up the hill :confounded: . Ironically it probably had too much torque for this test and was fairly challenged for traction on a lot of concrete dust. Honestly think the test rider did well to get that time having only ridden the board for 30seconds prior to the test.

Guess what I'm saying is the Trampa wants a rematch :wink:

Current temptation is one of those Trampa Orrsum longboards with the 6.5" pneumatics. Pneumatics get swapped to the street carver, and the ABECs end up on the longboard.

Funny thing about that day. Was keen to try out some of the other boards that day, as I'm still yet to ride another board. After all the test runs were done I finally climbed on a Raptor 2; got all of 10m down the carpark before getting the 'move on' from the security guards.

Good idea that, they have nice dual mounts for £100 as well. 

The Orssum complete makes sense fiscally, I was looking at the trucks and mounts but worked out at £300, the entire board including 6.5" trod superstars was £500; £600 with mounts iirc

If they are using a motorbike like compound in the 6.5" as claimed, there would be no traction problems on that grradient even with dust.

Then you are gonig to look at the original Stickies and wonder about a mini travel board, this is how the disease takes a grip :smile:
