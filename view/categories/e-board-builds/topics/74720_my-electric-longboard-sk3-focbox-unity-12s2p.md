so I could not sell any of the pieces I had to buy a trap board and decided to continue with my longboard and put wheels of 6 or 8 inches I have 3 table options:
* mbs all terrain longboard
* jetspud
* loaded kuth-taka
Regarding wheels, I would like to have two mods all terrain and street. These are my options:
* mbs all terrain longboard (for the street) (I live in Mexico the streets are poorly paved)
* aliexpres 6x2 with printed pulleys
* evolve all terrain conversion kit
These are the parts that you have already bought:
* sk3 6374 192kv dual
* tb reverse motor mount
* 44t pulleys for the mbs all terrain longboard wheels
* mbs all terrain longboard deck
* 13t pulley motor
* torqueboards 218mm trucks (I plan to extend the hanger to 250mm to fit the two engines) (I have an acquaintance who works with aluminum)
* focbox unity
* 12s2p echo with turnby battery from hobyking (4x6s 3000mah 20c)
* bms 60a
So what pieces would you choose?

So right now you are just wondering about wheels? And you want to be able to switch between 2 different sets: one urethane, one pneumatic?

I'm not sure if you are going to be able to fit 8 inch wheels on a jet spud without having some really long hangars either. (that 250mm may work...I'm not 100% sure)

Each wheel set is going to need a different belt size btw.

With that trucks you want a mountain board where both ends angled upwards or a stupidly crazy wedged riser which should then also work on other longboards.

@Kug3lis makes angled risers for mountain board trucks on standard skate decks if I'm not mistaken.

Just for the thing I am only getting some parts for the sales :D Also most of our stuff is on material cost and
