Sure... what do you need?  I have a video I linked of the VESC6 clone with a 6374 170kV motor. Do you want a riding video? Trying to get my buddy to come to our parking deck so I can shoot some video.

A parking lot would be ideal for this test, no snow, good inclination

It's really fun..I feel like I can turn on a dime :)  I also ordered (3) APS 6384S motors that are on their way.  (2) will go to a Trampa E-MTB. The other one to this build. With the 6384S 4000W motor just to see if I can go flying up a hill at least 25mph

He was backordered (3) weeks on the 6384S sensored motors when I purchased on Nov 20. So I just emailed Bruno @APS... he should have them now. Also I had a customization done to get 8mm shaft bore and 26mm shaft length... since APS is default 10mm shaft bore and doesn't fit standard motor pulleys.
