Hi guys just finished up my 3rd eboard and FINALLY my 1st Trampa E-MTB. 
Been in R&D for close to 6 months and the results are amazing. Anyone on the fence should deff build a mountain-board, It brings the riding to whole new level when u can do wheelies and go off-roading. 

Specs:
12s7p Barajabali battery
2x Kaly Mounts
2x Maytech 6374 190 KV sensored motors
2x Maytech 12s ESCs
Trampa 35 with 8in Primo Alpha wheels and Ratchet bindings
Underwater Kinetics 206 Ultrabox and 309 Drybox
15/65 gearing  
15mm belts

Big thanks!! to @barajabali @Kaly for their help with my build. They did an amazing job on the stuff I bought from them. I would highly recommend them to anyone.  Also thanks to all others on this form who inspired many other parts of my build. 

Only issues i encountered upfront was the brakes on Maytech ESC were terrible until I got it some new firmware. Now its perfect.

@barajabali Well one of them already broke actually. 
Retainer ring was falling out and magnets were loose and rattling inside.
I might be going back to SK3.

The mounts look really really good! I love the shape of the outer end of them, where the motor is located.

The build does look really good! Nice job..

Also saw one of your other boards in the background:

How is that one going ? Looks like it has quite some ''load'' on the underside.. resembles a turtle in a good way :) Though, probably runs way faster than turtles can do

---

PS I think the last pic of your build log could be made as a wallpaper.. looks really great.. almost makes you want to go and live / visit NY (assuming it is NY, as I know Kaly lives there and it somehow looks like NY)

Sweet build, I've been trying to decide wether I go with a full E-MTB or an Urban Carver, E-MTB is impresive but too cumbersome to be take on a daily basis

I ride it daily but yeah its a little cumbersome. a good compromise might e urban carver but thats also a little big looking. Nothing beats a longboard for portability. trampa is best for offroading and its so much fun :)

Is that the blazing spot you showed me last week?

Thanks for meeting up with me for a ride. I'll have a few twisted up next time.

Any updates on the damper mod? im looking into doing the mod over the winter. having a switch to do higher speeds is really critical to ride the infinity's comfortably in the city.

I see you switched from the Maytech sensored motors to SK3s.  

Is the difference between sensored and unsensored significant?  

I was considering the Maytech's but have heard there are some QC problems with them.  Did you have issues with yours?

Yeh man the sk3 never break. Maytecs fell part pretty quick.
My experience is as long as ur gearing and kv is right then cogging from a start isnt really an issue. 
I never use sensors.
