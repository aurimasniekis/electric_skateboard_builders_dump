The battery is 6s. I want to connect them in series to get more distance

You mean in parallel?

If that gets twice the distance then yes

Would you recommend 6s or 12s?

Hey @melvin737 make a new thread so this one stays on topic. Don't worry people will still see it and respond.

I recommend 12S, but it depends on your budget and how you like to ride.

Ok, but 12s is faster?

Hello,
i´m new here and i wanted to ask you if you could take a quick look at my setup:
I wanted to build the eboard after this manual:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anB4oZ5n1Mw

Longboard:
https://www.amazon.de/RAM-FR1-0-Longboard-schwarz-blau/dp/B00KII2GDI/ref=sr_1_2?s=sports&ie=UTF8&qid=1466000851&sr=1-2&keywords=longboards

I actually dont really care what deck it is, it just has to cost max. 150€. Suggestions are welcome

Wheels:

Motor: http://www.maytech.cn/en/mto6355-230-ha/10510.html

Akku(twice): http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__9176__Turnigy_5000mAh_6S_20C_Lipo_Pack.html

vesc: maytech(not on the website yet)

Controller: product/torqueboards-2-4ghz-mini-remote-controller/

xt90: http://dronada.com/shop/battery-adapters/885-xt90-battery-harness-10awg-for-2-packs-in-series.html

xt90s: http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__61690__XT90_S_Anti_Spark_Connector_2pairs_bag_.ht

Motor mount and pulleys:
: product/single-bolt-on-motor-mount-with-drive-wheel-kit/

Please tell if anything doesnt work, and give me suggestions. I already have an eboard(benchwheel), but it is a little bit too slow and i wanted to start a diy project.
Also, if you know a good calculator for the top speed, please let me know.
```

Yes 12S is usually faster. Your setup is fine.

The distance does not increase just because you hook batteries up in parallel. It is about the wh and they stay the same no matter if you connect in series or parallel.
```

You are doubling the capacity in parallel, in series you double the voltage. So parallel can get you longer distance
```

```
no you don't as the capacity itself has nothing to do with the distance you can go. It is about the stored energy which is always amphours*volts.

Looks good. What battery are you getting? Make sure to get the Kegel drive wheel and not the ABEC one. Do you know how to solder because you might have to? You will also need a cable to connect the VESC to your receiver.

Here is a calculator: http://toddy616.blogspot.hk/2013/07/electric-skateboard-calculator.html

exactly. As long as you limit your speed on 12s you'll still get the same distance as a parrellel set up. You just have the option to go much faster if need be

Setup looks fine.

Since everyone else commented on the batteries, I'll comment on the motor and VESC. In my opinion, I think the may tech motor is over priced. For about the same price as they quoted me, you could get a great motor from [enertion](http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/r-spec-brushless-outrunner-motors.html) or [ Motors](product-category/electric-skateboard-parts/electric-skateboard-motors/). I suspect the VESC from them will be about the same, and I don't know if anyone has tried them so I don't even know if they're decent quality. I will say that I doubt that they're supporting Vedder and the electric board community anywhere near as well as the other VESC sellers are. Food for thought, I won't rail on ya if you want to go maytech anyways. Welcome to the community though!

ok thank you, but where is the difference in connecting the batteries in series or parallel? can you explain me how to do that?

thank you for the calculator. I think i´m going to put 2 batteries in series so i can get more speed(the batteries are where it says 'akku'). I have do ask maytech whether i should take 10s or 12s. Where do i find these cables?

i have also heard about a bms and that you need it for a long battery life time. Is that important?
```

## \#22 Posted by: lox897 Posted at: 2016-06-21T00:01:50.301Z Reads: 49

Depends if you take care of your batteries. They don't increase lifetime much. They just cut the battery off when it is "reaching it's limit" of amps or low voltage.

They will also make it easier to charge because you can just plug it straight into your wall and not worry about any settings.

Can you tell me how i can install a bms? I would like to charge the batteries both at one time and not separatly

Btw, does anybody why turnigy 6s lipo 5000mah 20c batteries are cheaper on hobbyking than on any other website? its about half the price on hobbyking, but they say that they cant ship to me due to size or weight
