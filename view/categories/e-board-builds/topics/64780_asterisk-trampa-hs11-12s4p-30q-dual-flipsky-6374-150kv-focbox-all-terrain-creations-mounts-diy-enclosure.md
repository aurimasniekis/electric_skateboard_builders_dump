Slow burning build here.
I picked up a second hand (almost new) Trampa 30 long, with Vertigo trucks, Superstar hubs and Primo tyres 4 months ago.
Since then I've been picking up parts here and there when offers have been on and now have almost everything I need to get it going.

Deck - Trampa 30 Long, cut to HS11 shape
Battery - Samsung 30Q 12S4P
Motors - 2 x Flipsky 6374 150KV
ESC - 2 x Focbox
Motor mount - All Terrain Creations mounts
BMS - Charge only BMS
Gearing - 15T to 60T (using Versapulleys)
Enclosure - DIY enclosure. 3D printed, molded and then fiberglass versions cast

**Progress so far:**

Enclosure - Ready to be molded

Progress on molding the enclosure. 
Used reusable vinyl rubber followed by rigid jesmonite jacket.

i was actually thinking about doing something like this 3D printing the mould so its perfect then making a fibreglass enclosure. would you mind sharing the STL files so i could see the dimensions on how you made them by any chance?

The enclosure I designed is made up of seperate boxes and skirting for each of printing.
I wrapped the deck in masking tape and then hot glues the boxes in place, followed by the skirting around them.

thanks i was considering doing something like this, though i was speaking with a mate of mine about the fibreglass does it flex. i was hoping to use it on a Trampa MTB build. 

Thank you for sharing this. i wont be using it 100% as i want to make some modifications to fit my vesc BMS and switch in the enclosure but it will be a great start!

haha disregard my last comment i think thats the same Deck that im looking at getting on my build, though i would like to know how the fiberglass handles the flex, i havent used it before.

My deck is actually a 35 mountain version which I've cut the end up to make it into a HS11. Although I've discovered I need to drill new mounting holes for the truck as they need to be closer to the bend.

The deck itself is similar composite so if anything I would've thought it would add to the stiffness a bit, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, I'm a bit of a bigger guy.

Got the supplies on order so might be able to cast the master this weekend weather permitting.

ahh havent you made one yet. would love to know how the flex goes with fibreglass =)
i believe the deck im looking at is the HolyPro deck, though i dont actually like the holes in it since i need to fill them.

oh i almost forgot to ask, what size battery does this fit 12s8p?

I'll let you know once I cast it, I know it comfortably fit 12s4p, but it might be deep enough for a double stack.

Spent today cleaning up the mold and laying up some gelcoat and resin. Quality of the vinyl rubber mold is shocking so there will be a lot of cleanup to do after.

Pulled from the mold and cleaned up a fair bit. 
Some of the panels aren't as flat as I'd like so I'll take the heat gun to them to get them shaped a bit better. 
The box sections are super strong, they can take my full weight standing on them, the joints between the sections are the weak point. 
Going to print some TPU bumpers so the fiberglass doesn't rub on the wires.

That's awesome .
I am also considering to build  a trampa style street carve .
But I can't find any enclosure for 10s5p batteries I an using .
Reason why I an doing 10s battery , because want to use the evolve BMS n ESC, that way I can use the evolve LCD remote .
Would u be able to custom make an enclosure for me please .
Thank u

They're effectively HS11 versions of @Koringer Carver version.

More time spent at the weekend, this time adding 10k NTC thermistors to my Flipsky motors so the VESC motor temperature sensing now works.
I've also got the DAVEga up and running and in the case, just waiting on some multi core cabling to run a channel for it underneath and I need to print out the gaskets to improve water resistance too.

Further progress on the enclosure this weekend. Heatsink hole cut out and rails for lighting have been routed out. Will be embedding clear acrylic rods in the enclosure for LEDs to shine from the inside of the enclosure. I'll give them a light sanding to diffuse the light.

More progress, cut, shaped and epoxied in the light rails. Taped some bike lights inside to show the effect. I'll be using WS2812B LED strips so it'll look really good once done.

Progress over the past two nights, sprayed with truck bed liner spray paint which has given it an amazing finish.
I've also added the LED strips and wired up the switch which goes between modes and colours.

Had a couple people ask how I did the lighting so here's how I did it.
I bought some 8mm acrylic rods, and a 8mm radius cove router bit.
I routed out a groove in the enclosure using a 3D printed jig for my router.
![image|635x492](upload://oHeqV4h6nC4XgWRghA039PIiLkW.png) 
I then cut and shaped the acrylic rods and sanded them to help difuse the light. These were then epoxied into the grooves/slits in the enclosure (see two posts up).
I then used masked off the acrylic rods and used truck bed liner spray to give the enclosure a nice consistent durable finish.
![image|666x500](upload://3TMt3af3C7Inwy6oFHajbiTZNbE.jpeg) 
I then used a dremel on the inside of the enclosure to grind some holes so the LEDs sat nicely against the acrylic rods for the light to penetrate well. These WS2812B LEDs were wired up and hot glued in.
![image|666x500](upload://7f2ZfAudmZsd0nPRRypTrR71Coz.jpeg) 
I'm using a LED controller called "Chroma" which I had from my Drone racing days, I don't think they make them anymore though :frowning:

Absolutely.  There is a group of us and they all have trampas apart from me.  Near me is vast woodland criss crossed with trails and they are waiting for me to finish (start!) The build so we can go out together.  I'll give you a shout for sure if you are up for a bit of AT?
