Hello fellow eSk8rs,

My friend and I live in the states and just graduated from Evolve Skateboards. The boards were fun for a while but we want something better. We are creating this build log to get help along the way. 

Right now we are in the process of selecting and ordering parts. Our proposed parts list is as follows...

The Board from Trampa:
Trampa HS11 16Ply Deck
Superstar Hubs
Vertigo Trucks
Some 7 or 8 inch tire
binding with heel straps [Ratchet or Velcro?]

Drive Terrain:
E-TOXX Dual Direct Drive 1:5 w/ helices & 3mm keyways

Enclosure:
eBoosted's fiberglass enclosure

Electronics:
12S4P [deciding on what cells to use]
esk8 1.2, Enerton Focbox [deciding]
Alien Power 6384s 200kv Sensored
Anitspark switch from esk8.de
BMS from BesTech Power [deciding on the two from below depending on how much space we will have but feel free to toss out some other recommendations]
http://bestechpower.com/444v12spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/BMS-D298V1.html
http://bestechpower.com/444v12spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/BMS-D338.html
Recommendations on a good charger would be nice
fuses will be place in charging circuit and power circuit

Remote:
Custom, following the thread below
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/simple-3d-printed-nrf-remote-arduino-controlled/28543/11


Hopefully I will see you back here with some new parts in hand!

Samsung Q30s Have a bulletproof reputation.
Some people say Its underrated and can easily do 15a and even go over that.

batteries like Samsung 25R are known to get hot while running at 20a.
(I don't know this for fact read a few posts that said that)

I'd drop the kv on these a bit if I was you, with a 200mm tire max theoretical top speed will be just over 40mph. somewhere over 30mph torsional twist on Trampa decks is a real safety issue.

I have 160kv, you can still run the 200kv if you want but please be careful & gear up, even releasing the throttle can induce the board to buck and shimmy :ramen: at +35mph.

that’s not possible. it’s ez to fuck up batteries, no matter what kind they are

also, they can do 20a continuous while staying cool.

You might want to consider buying the holy pro 35 instead of the HS11. Especially if you plan to mount your batteries underneath the deck, and want a little more ground clearence for offroad :wink:

I have both 170kv and 130kv coming... But 170 on 8" tires on 12s...is still 39ish top...

Anyway just something to think about...like @Cobber said.. 

Also 12s4p is a little small... 80amps constant. On a mtb...

12s 5:1 130kv 200mm tires - 24mph

Both, but probably not riding on anything too rough off road. probably going to drop down to the 170 kv. I also think that 12S4P is fine; basing the battery pack off of eboosted's pheonix build. Saw your post of that, thanks! :slight_smile:

His is pretty much for riding rough road and trails at most..

You'll need more if it's full offroad. Otherwise your range will suffer likely. If your mostly on the road don't worry I guess

I am running Alien Power HEV 6374 200kv that tested at only 174KV
The advertised Kv rating is not always the true rating.

Here is a good thread about advertised vs true motor kv.

True Nama, but take Bimmers 170kv motors, they are testing out to 174kv...
& my scorpions are within a few kv. 
How heavy are your motors Nama? I think the lighter motors often come up low? I could be wrong though, just my limited experience with a handful of different motors :thinking:

May I suggest a dual enclosure, someone else on the forum had @Kaly build one for him, I think he had a 12s4p in the enclosure under the deck like you and then he had a detachable box that went between his feet that housed a 12s7p or something like that. 

I personally wouldn’t want to have my batteries mounted under my deck when riding off road on trails and over sticks as it could quite easily break the case and even the battery causing a fire. I don’t have any experience though

I'm pretty sure both the HS11 and HolyPro are exactly the same, even the mounting holes are the same. The Trampa Carver is shorter and have different mounting points though, it sits higher from the ground, that is why I like the HS11 the most, even more than the HolyPro because you won't need to cover the holes and there is a nice flat spot to mount the battery meter on the nose and on/off switch at the tail, as on the HolyPro there is a big hole that makes things just a tad more complicated.

If you weight like me, 70kg, I'd suggest to go with the 16ply, I got the 15 ply on the HolyPro and it's a little bouncy, but after a couple of weeks you become an expert controlling the board even though is as flexy as my former GF

A flexy board will give you more damping on bad roads

IMO.... with a undertray battery you want the HS11 because it dont come with cutouts in the area where you mount the enclosure

[quote="neverpush, post:7, topic:52515, full:true"]

I just advice the 200kv because you asked for 60kmh... but better for offroad will be less like cobber and deckoz mentioned

[quote="Deckoz, post:10, topic:52515"]

[/quote]

Yap
I actually have a 12s4p Vtc6 Battery on my twin vesc6 sk3-149 6.5inch street fighter and it gets nice warm... if you find a way with @Eboosted to fit more P in i would better go for 6p IMO

If you compare eboosted builds without bindings for commuting with "strapped" offroad riding you should consider that you are able to pull alot more amps

But in the end with quality cells why not... i dont care for my vtc6...

The HS 11 and The Holy pro feature the same outline. The Carve Board deck is shorter and features a different outline, allowing the wheels to clear the deck on extreme leans. The carver sits higher above the ground to avoid street bite on extreme leans.

Would you mind explaining why? Looking at the schematics between [hs11](http://www.trampaboards.com/35-hs11-trampa-brake--electric-deck--drilled-edged-fitted-with-jessop-grip-tape--a-marine-grade-stainless-steel-hex-head-bolt-kit-p-11300.html) and [holy pro 35](http://www.trampaboards.com/35-holypro-trampa-mountainboard-deck--drilled-edged-fitted-with-jessop-grip-tape--a-marine-grade-stainless-steel-hex-head-bolt-kit-p-10139.html), they look identical apart from the cutouts around the base plate and the holes on the deck.

I remember hearing this as well, that the hs11 sits lower to the ground than the holypro. Been wondering the same. According to the schematics though they are identical (just missing the cutouts). Perhaps it was the carver that was being discussed, and I missread.

Right.

@FredrikHems @benjammin @egzplicit 
HolyPro and HS11 are exactly the same beside the holes.
The Urban Carver has more ground clearance because the truck mounting holes are lower. Even with 7" wheels there is more ground clearance compared to Holypro with 8" wheels.

So... The one thing I learned when pshaw had his trampa, was at speeds above 45kmph you really should be picking a rail and keep the board in a perpetual carve. Trampa trucks like to wobble when going straight at speed... So you have to mini carve. It's weird.

I'm confused about y'all's dampa drills

## \#48 Posted by: Kug3lis Posted at: 2018-04-27T01:52:12.723Z Reads: 135

We are running without bindings so to turn board is really hard because dampas limits spring movement... And without dampa at speed for e.g. 35km/h it starts to wobble... And you lose easy dampening so you pick all bumps and etc with your legs..

Hey guys! Been a while since I originally posted; here to show off some progress. I've made a heatsink for the focbox's and added a light bar to the front. I was surprised how well the light bar fit, I guess it was made to be. I'll be running a voltage regulator to step down my 50V pack to 12V to power the light bar.  ![2V9A9965|690x460](upload://86DOWbEXFJuqstN6JN9pb4QRqNl.jpg)![2V9A9951|690x460](upload://dc5VaCKbpG2AzZKRBG1ZKYhaQCe.jpg)![2V9A9955|690x460](upload://s7hg3cSLuztK6k62MoFdEA9ToO0.jpg)![2V9A9944|690x390](upload://iSKB4XyAKiQi8k6FqUTY1cow0qQ.jpg)![2V9A9964|690x460](upload://ec0Igd8ZqpUzqNWtX0X4uwmuO1w.jpg)

I finally finished the battery pack and its necessary components. I originally was going to do an external BMS; I now realize I could fit a smaller BMS that would only be responsible for charging and not balancing when discharging.Holes were drilled into the side of the enclosure for the switches, LED lights, motor wires, and charge port as well as a slot for the heat sink. Working on building the circuit for the LED lights and making the remote/receiver.
