On going build log

All my parts are ordered

I'm still hesitating on the the battery size, 10S8P or 10S10P li-ion. Guess that will depend on how many cells I can fit in this [enclosure battery box](http://www.b-w-international.com/product/type-500/). 

Got [this box](https://www.mcmaster.com/#6779t12/=15he8ft) to enclose the VESCX.

I'll be mounting both boxes with [vibration dampers](https://www.mcmaster.com/#9247k33/=15he90q). Not sure if it will help for the vibrations, we'll see.

This will be a fairly quick build, updates will come rapidly.

@Blasto Here's another waterproof box option. I've got the 7" & 11" boxes on my board. They have nice thick rubber feet on the bottom for built in vibration reduction.

Stuff is starting to trickle in

Screwed up on the vescx enclosure, it's a little small. I'll try to make it work.

Get the type 206 box by under water kinetics it works perfect with vescx.

Got some tedious work done, nickel strips cut to measure, punched, deburred and then flaten.

Also got jig all ready for spot welding.

Finally i've settled for a 10S7P, looking up @barajabali build's, 7P is a good number.

[quote="Randyc1, post:13, topic:14732"]

[/quote]

it is to help prevent the high voltage path of the spot welder to jump across the electrodes. I want the path of least resistance to be through each piece that I am spot welding. 

in this config without a hole, the path of least resistance is on the surface of the nickel plate.

now what i am trying to achieve with the holes, is to make sure the current path goes through to the other part that I am trying to spot weld.

I've been getting a better bond when I do this, it's a real PITA but I think it is worth it.

manufactured cells have this air gap for the same exact purpose

Yes, it would be better if i had a slot shape punch, but i don't and i didn't feel like nibbling a slot. So a single hole punch will be good enough... we'll see

Mounted my miniature vescx box, i was able to use the existing truck holes to mount my rubber standoffs. @trampa your sensor leads are really short, they need a good extra 100mm to do a nice loop to the box

You can mount your VESCs directly behind the motor casing (in between the two motors). We pre-drilled some holes...
Short wires, low losses, no movement in cables. Motor and sensor cables want to be as short as possible.

Thanks Frank, i do like the idea of mounting the esc box directly on the motor mounts, less stress on the motor cables.

Do you have the bolt pattern of these place holder holes? This will avoid me eye balling them and my caliper probably doesn't span enough (150mm caliper) I'll probably need to get a new box, already poked the other one with a bunch of holes.

However i'll have to disagree with you about the length of the sensor cables, these cable can probably be over a meter long before experiencing any parasidic effects. What's annoying with these jst ph connectors, there's no inline male headers, need to use a through hole connector to make an adapter. So having a good length for them makes things alot easier.

I understand what you mean, guess i can always open up the motor and solder some longer cables (yes yes, voided warranty, that's why I can't have nice stuff ;) )

You can simply cut the cables behind the jst connector and solder longer cables to the wires. Easy! No need to open the motor. I would not open it! The PCB inside is sealed. You can also make an extension using a jst male connector. Not as nice but it works...

First ride, noticed that both motor mounts were loose.... great, they came pre-assembled, 3hrs, 174725 screws later. All 4 grub screw weren't tighten to the hanger.

I've thought about doing the ''cheap diy chains'..

Basically you just use a zip ties and put them through the spokes and around the tire.. Though, for drive wheel this might be a bit more difficult to do, depending on what sort of adapter plate each one of us got.

I'm actually going to do this for my mtb. But the plastic zip ties won't last though since they'll break easily. Someone suggested using stainless steel zip ties instead so I might go that route.

Ya i totally understand. But the MTB tires have rims and spoke on them so I would assume the metal zip ties wouldn't touch the tub. But to be safe though I'm going to try one on and put some pressure on it to see if theres a chance it'll bypass the rims and cut into the tube. Thanks for the heads up!
