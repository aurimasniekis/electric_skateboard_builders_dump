after a couple of months of bothering you guys with my benchwheel problems. I decided to give up on it and just build something for myself. The main problem is, I have problems getting a battery pack where I live, and don't have easy access to a spot welder to make one myself. the only option I have seen for me so far is
  36v 10ah li-ion battery pack 36v 10ah electric scooter lithium ion battery for electronic skateboard mobility scooter   charger
 <Link deleted> 
I don't know how I feel about it tbh. What do you guys think?
I can get motors/motor mounts/pulleys and stuff from a guy locally, and I guess that leaves the ESC. Decided to buy from chaka coz it seems his are the best out there.

I'm having problems getting parts basically. Does anyone have experience with this motor? The only other option I have locally is the sk3 6375 192kv, and I plan to run a dual motor setup. I've read that that's overkill. And it costs nearly double the price of the keda 6364 190kv. I guess the wheels will be 90mm or 97mm flywheel clones. The roads aren't awfully smooth where I live. The only option for ESC locally is the fvt 120a. But I do want more range and power out of my board. And it seems from what I've read so far that the ESC is usually one of the first things to go on the board.

I totally recommend the chaka vesc, I heard amazing revews, I would use SK3 and a battery from enertion or torqueboards, they ship worldwide. www. has everything you need.

The price of the battery on torqueboards kinda exceeds my budget if I go dual motors, and I'm kinda afraid to buy from enertion at this point. I'm hoping to keep it under 800usd  max for everything except deck/trucks/wheels and maybe bearings. I'm looking to go about 40kph and around a 30-40km range. I need to climb hills of about 20-30% on my daily commute to work. And I'd like to take my board out on long trips on my days off. Hence that particular range and dual motors. I would totally save up for chaka's board, but he doesn't ship internationally.

The 30% inclines are on my daily commute to work which is barely 5 minutes away by board. The range is for when I go out in the middle of the night to take my mind off things. Speed is an added bonus I guess? It's not something I'm going to be doing constantly. I value my life. =D

I don't understand how they're fitting 10S4P into this very small form factor, with a BMS no less. That price seems too low to be legit.

It's the one part so far I'm having the most problems trying to get. Price and availability are the main issues. I kinda doubt that battery too to be perfectly honest. But it fits the budget. I want to leave some spare budget for when stuff goes wrong, considering it's my first build and all. I'm pretty sure things will go wrong somewhere.

you can´t use this one. Just read through the stats: Discharge 10Amps max 15Amps.

Where do you live? 

You can´t get both things: really good performance and at the same time really cheap.
You have to find your sweat spot with both things.

Also some people could help with parts, depending on where you are from.

perhaps someone on here can help you out with a few adresses.

It's more escooter and air wheel parts here now. Ebike parts used to be readily available, but they got heavily restricted. Very few skaters here. I have never seen anyone riding an eskate, but plenty of people on scooters. I think my choices are limited to China mostly. We don't even have very many hobby stores, and those few have very limited stocks. It's not a very exciting country....

Yeah definitely don't wire two 10S batteries together in **series**. That would be 72V nominally, 84V max

Your lucky that you didn't by the battery from the link in the first post. Because by the dimensions it is only a 10S3P battery with laptop cells. Max discharge is 15A. So this battery is not usable for a longboards. Very unfair that they declare it as a scooter and longboard battery. I think you should delete that link in the post so that not somebody else thinks it's a proper battery.

Be careful with the VESCs from Maytech as it seems they only flash the firmware and not the bootloader/firmware. The impact is that you cannot upgrade via BLDC... ... knowing that in addition, the firmware they include in their VESC has the ramp up bug (it's the 2.18 but not the correct one)... 

I told them a while ago (like 6 months), but they did not fix it. Hopefully they will soon.

In case, double check; do Read/Writes and see if the ramp up bug is here.

I own a 3d printer so I'm currently experimenting with printing my own wheel pulley and motor mount (using files avail on thingiverse as well as designing them). I'm only doing a single drive for my first build and am lacking a VESC, wheels, all the screws etc and the belt, so I guess I can probably get them from him. I also intend on building my own deck (much cheaper and customizable), but I just can't seem to source for the correct material (baltic birch plywood) in SG. Any insights on this?

I would say there might be some places that would sell you specific types of plywood sheets in the sungei kadut area. But I don't think they will sell in low quantities. Best bet might be to look around places like Ikea or diy stores. But they may not have large enough pieces. There is a place I saw, while scrolling through carousell recently, that teaches people how to build decks and even provides the wood. Perhaps approach them?
