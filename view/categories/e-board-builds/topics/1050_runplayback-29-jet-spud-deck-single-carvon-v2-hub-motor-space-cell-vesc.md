Hey all, I'm a longtime ES/ESK8 lurker, DIY enthusiast, and filmmaker originally from NYC and now living in Ann Arbor, Michigan. About a year ago, I was introduced to the Yuneec EGO from a good friend. Paired with a gimbal, we used it as a camera dolly for super smooth tracking shots. I was into the Miniquad FPV scene for awhile too but got completely turned off by the competitive attitudes and detached sarcasm exhibited by lot of those guys. Anyway, the ESK8 community was like a breath of fresh air. This is how I took my first plunge into DIY eboards.

My basic goals were to create a stealthy board, with a slim enclosure, a single hub motor and a short deck. At 130 lbs soaking wet and a 2 1/2 mile commute door to door from my home to office, this seemed like a pretty feasible goal. Here's the breakdown of my parts.

TorqueBoards 2.4ghz Mini Remote
RunPlayBack Sulaco V1 Enclosure

In addition to all the suppliers I listed above I really want to thank Caden Matson and LongHairedBoy for the encouragement on Instagram. We all have our own preferences and needs when it comes to DIY but now I understand that the process and discovering your own way of building is what unites us. Really look forward to contributing to this community and look forward to all the wonderful innovations that are currently happening. Exciting times! I can only post one image since I'm a new user but If you want to read my full breakdown with more images [check out my full article here][1].

Awesome build!

I'm in Ann Arbor too! I have a dual Vanguard build and am currently working on a Hi5ber Python build as well. You are the only other DIY boarder I have seen so far in AA, it would be fun to ride sometime when it gets a bit warmer!

Whaat! That's awesome! I have a buddy who owns a Boosted Dual but other than that I haven't seen another DIY. Where do you usually ride? I'm totally down, we should make an A2ESK8 facebook group and see who else is out there. Got any links I could check out of your build?

@Dedbny Thanks! Yeah I'd like to do some speed trial videos with this board, a OneWheel, my E-GO and hopefully a Boosted if I can find one out here. 9 degree weather in Michigan is pretty brutal though so we'll see when the weather clears up

@BigAl Totally worth it, I don't even think I would have gotten very far without these forums

@longhairedboy Yes! I peeped that, lemme know how it goes, I had to do a bunch of different configs, I got it working pretty sweet but always room for improvement. Are you using a convection oven?

@siggs3000 Yeah once I saw your post, I was like that's the deck for me! Great find. I haven't punched it hard on the streets yet but just casual indoor riding feels super smooth. With the 1/4" shock pads, the Carvon hubs clear the deck easily. I'm also pleasantly surprised to discover the space cell was able to fit under there.

I think I might have seen the boosted dual at a tech meetup (there can't be that many in AA).

I usually ride from my house on central campus up to north campus when I commute but when it's nice out I typically ride the neighborhoods on the SE side. Let me know if you create the facebook group and I will definitely join!

No build thread but here are some pics....not as beautiful as yours but definitely powerful.

Haha yeah that was probably my buddy Luke with the Boosted Dual. He has a beard and never wears a helmet because it'll mess up his hair lol. We work over at Duo near N. Ashley and Huron and I usually ride from there to my house a little past Pioneer. Yeah I'll work on the FB group page, I think there's a lot of folks out here who are interested. I do video work with the guys at Launch and they're all itching to try eskating. Those boards are awesome, I've definitely come across these lurking here had no idea you were local. I LOVE that Hi5ber...can't wait to see it in person. If you're interested I can help you build some custom ABS enclosures, I have the vacuum former station in my basement ready to rock.

Just a quick update mod. Yesterday I installed 90mm Abec 11 Flywheels 81a along with 90a cone/barrel bushings and the ride is SUPER fun. Now that it's almost Spring, I'm able to carve through the city daily and it's a blast. Along with this setup and FOC mode, it's the perfect hybrid of a traditional long board and electric. It might be a psychological thing but with the silence of FOC on the hub, my kick push instincts and awareness are heightened and it's always a pleasure to go from kick push coast into throttle when the road is clear. It hits that sweet spot of being stealthy, yet showy, manual or electric at the same time. I have Abecs on my non-electric Landyachtz Dinghy and these wheels are really incredible. I'll post up some video footage soon.

It was a custom request for Jerry at Carvon. The stock wheels were great but the Abec's are unreal. I really never rode on them until I got my Landyachtz Dinghy paired with double kingpin Gullwing Sidewinder II's. I'm thinking of putting Abecs on my dual build as well. There's just something about the way the wheels adapt to the road. Grippy when necessary and able to absorb cracks or bumps on the road.

Lol I know, not a lot of real estate on this 29" board with the Space Cell. For what it's worth - with my 1/4" risers and my weight (125 lbs - doing a lot of cardio recently) I'll be okay. Put a 200lb dude on my board however and they'll get screwed. Actually I typically change the bushings depending on whose riding it and so far never had any wheel bite even with heavy dudes on it.

From the videos it looks super carvy and fun to ride. I was really close to pulling the trigger on the Evolve until I realized how long it was. I think the motor has to hang so far in the back because of the gullwings. I LOVE the gullwings but I think it's best suited for a non-electric board.

Its called high "rebound" and it decreases losses from bumps and rough roads. Clone wheels feel dead and lifeless in comparison. All the best longboarding wheels come out of one little factory in southern California, They are the only ones with this formula that I know of. Definitely worth the extra cost when you hit a rough path in the middle of a fast curve.

Loose trucks save lives! Learn to conquer the wobs by leaning forward and gaining ankle strength. Having your trucks bound up tight can leave you wishing you could have juked before hitting a pothole at 30mph. If anything leave your road side bushings soft and only use hard a bushing board side on the rear truck.

Glad to see Jerry pump out some modified abecs for his hubs. I told him as soon as he starts building them on calibers with abec wheels I'll place my orders.

Yeah it feels like a completely different board now. It does feel ALIVE unlike the clones. I have that exact bushing setup now (threw on a Venom 87a barrel rear boardside) and with the Abec's its just a way different experience. I'm doing the same thing for my dual, it truly is a perfect match with his hubs.

@RunPlayBack this is an awesome build thanks for updating! 

I just got a new pair of flywheel clones for my office cruiser (not electric yet) and now you've got me wondering if I should try the real deal. This was my first set of large (83mm 80a) urethane wheels and I am already in love with them, I'll try the real ones next time!

How long did you actually need that Y xt-60 connector cable to be? 19 inches seems like overkill, but all the other ones are only like 4 or 5 inches. The one you got is out of stock, and I'd like to order one but don't wanna come up short. Thanks man!

Apparently, the Abec 11 81a is actually softer than the stock clone 78a which tells me these wheels all have slightly different specs. I have some Sector 9's, Hawgs and clones laying around and the Abec's blow them all out of the water and worth every penny. Here's the 72mm on my Landyachtz Dinghy.

Yeah, on a dual build. I would just buy that exact connector and do what you did, but it's out of stock I can't find any like it. All the others are really short ( and look kinda crappy) so I just didn't want to get one of those and have it come up short. It's harder to lengthen the cable than shorten it I imagine :stuck_out_tongue:

I has to be one of the best decks for this sort of thing. It has the wheelbase of a way bigger board but is compact enough to be easy to carry and stash. The concavity is the only thing to keep in mind. It's intense but makes riding a dream.

I have 97mm on my dual. The single was 90mm that I replaced with the 90mm Abecs. When I get the 90mm Abecs on the dual I'll report back. I'm assuming yes? The 97mm are pretty massive.

You have to kick push to get the smoothest startup. Personally, I don't like standing with two feet planted on startup, kicking gives me a few seconds to find my balance and posture while I throttle up. I ride a lot in the city and the last thing I want to do is lose my balance in a busy intersection. If you know how to skate it feels very natural.

Thanks for the info! I was wondering how the motor wheels attach to the Carvon motor hubs. I'm guessing you need to adapt the wheel somehow to make it work. Is this doable yourself? or would you have to ask Carvon for a custom wheel?

Disregard that. I've been talking with Carvon and figured it out. I'm thinking about doing a Enertion deck + battery + 2 VESC + Carvon Dual Hub + Nyoko Karma myself. Carvon mentioned something about how Enertion's space cell was limiting top speed. Any input on this? Whats your top speed?

My theory is that the Bat Max 30A continuous may not be unleashing it's full potential. I have to do a top speed test in BLDC soon. Right now I have it on FOC just to practice maneuvers and carving. I'll try to do one next week.

I'm running a single  r-spec 6355 and 12 to 36 teeth pully. Im going to be having a pack built now with a BMS with  35 A max con. Hoping it will give me some more ummmph and let me run a dual set up.

Definitely, the 30A continuous is no slouch and my dual Carvon hubs + Space Cell are very zippy. The top speed coasting on flats are great because of the lack of drag. I think hubs, unlike a belt drive require a little more continuous current. I'm just speculating here because I haven't run any tests.

You'll love em. I'd also recommend soft bushings (barrel + cone) on the front to get that fun carving going. I know hubs aren't for everyone but one thing that I've noticed is that with the smooth acceleration/deceleration and lack of drag, you can really practice interesting maneuvers and style. I think it's why my skater friends like the feel of the hubs, it's not just about massive torque to go up a hill. We're just trying to figure out other ways to ride this thing together.

I like soft bushings for carving @ low speed but I need hard ones when going over 25 mph.
I like double barrel. 
You know you can remove the stock bolts easily on those trucks and replace them  with longer ones. 
I did that on mine.

I have run both stock 90s and 97s on my dual hub setup.
The 97s ride smoother and get higher top speed but it's a higher gear ratio and the acceleration doesn't feel as quick as the 90s. Also I noticed more cogging when starting off with the 97s. 
I think the best option is to pay extra for the 90mm flywheels.

Hey bro, I'm waiting to hear what you're top speed is with dual hubs. 
So far I've only clocked 30mph on mine with 12s and TB Esc's. That was on a fairly short straight away. 
I think rider weight also plays a big factor. 
I'm about 185 presently.

I'll have to agree with RPB. Always give a couple kicks to get going then throttle. 
The motors cog a little starting from stand still, it puts extra load on the motors and Esc's and your balance is not as good.
And if your running 10-12s there's so much torque that it can jerk you backwards. Even after a couple kicks, you have to be careful with the throttle. 
The difference between 6s and 12s is huge!

[quote="RunPlayBack, post:52, topic:1050, full:true"]
You have to kick push to get the smoothest startup. Personally, I don't like standing with two feet planted on startup, kicking gives me a few seconds to find my balance and posture while I throttle up. I ride a lot in the city and the last thing I want to do is lose my balance in a busy intersection. If you know how to skate it feels very natural.
[/quote]

I totally agree upon this, however as I am introducing electric longboard around my friends especially the one who couldn't longboard at all, they tend to stand static on top of the board and slowly makes their cruise. Similar to you, time to time I found it better and easier to have it kick push to get into balanced position :smile:

Wheel size
Sprocket teeth for belt drive (1 and 1 for hub motors)
Transmission ratio if applicable 
And it calculates max motor rpm and speed.

There's a more technical way to explain it but FOC with the hub motors provides smooth acceleration/deceleration/coasting and is eerily quiet. Someone much smarter than me can explain it better but that's typically what I like to use it for, especially commuting in the city when I want to remain stealthy.

It definitely feels like the throttle and brake are more authoritative than when in bldc mode. I personally thought I would miss the sound of the motors but It opened up a whole new world with FOC. The sound the urethane makes when it struggles for traction under acceleration is intoxicating.

I agree, I wasn't sure if it was a psychological thing - like I feel I'm more in control of the board because it's so quiet, as if natural skate instincts kick in as opposed to hearing motors which activates my "driving" instincts. I really haven't had the desire to switch back to BLDC yet, even riding in large areas when I can gun it. That intoxicating feeling happened to me once, riding through a pitch black bike trail at midnight with my buddy. Just LED's on the boards and FOC mode so we can hear the natural sound of the forest and wind rushing past us. It felt like a video game and gave me more euphoria than sitting in one place and flying FPV drones. It's like we were skate Ninjas.

I am not a technical expert as well but if you check FOC and BLDC motor phase diagram they are easier to explain.

FOC is vector control and so the wave is sinosuidal (sine wave control). Instead of ON OFF ON OFF ON OFF (BLDC mode), it has a nice sine wave / trapezoidal wave current output to each phase. Instead of 0 then 100 then 0, its like 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100(peak) 90 80 70 60 50 40 ... and so on. Since the rise and fall of current are gradual, it produces less high pitch / noticeable sound.

At least this is my perception and the simplest logical thing I could understand.

Quick update to this build. I swapped out the Jet Spud for this blank 36" double kicktail deck from Ehlers Longboards. I immediately sanded it and painted it gloss black with some coats of polyurethane. The wheelbase was too short so I had to drill some additional truck holes and slightly modify the enclosure. I also added a tail guard/foot step. Although it's not really a mini cruiser anymore, I can easily swap the deck between this and the Spud depending on the situation.

@RunPlayBack - I actually looked at the Dinghy but I was looking for something just a little longer than the spud so my front foot would be behind the front truck (instead of right on top of it) and also something that had a little bit of flex. I'm looking for a smoother ride and slightly less scary than having my foot so close to the nose. Though insanely expensive, I think the Poke is going to deliver! I'll make a new build thread about it soon. 

Your other build is so sweet, by the way. Clean and cool!

Quick update here. So I've pretty much converted this build into a Carvon Mini Cruiser by switching the deck to a 29" kicktail and switching the Space Cell for a 12s1p LiFePO4 38v 2500mah custom pack and homemade enclosure. For such a small deck, I've set the speed limit down to about 15mph for safety. The battery works really well with FOC enabled and soft RPM limit end to 60k. I've only used it lightly yesterday and today but if you thought the Spud was stealthy, this thing moves like the Ninjas in Daredevil. The lighter weight makes FOC feel even smoother and the smaller wheelbase truly gives the illusion of a non electric. I'll try to get some video up this weekend.

I think it's a great deck, probably the only mini deck capable of going 30mph safely because of the width and super long wheelbase. It was my very first purchase so I have fond memories. I'm going to port it over to a third build because its so awesome.

My new build was more about decreasing the weight and also electrify an Ion 30 which I don't believe has been done yet.

well, its just a very cheap board and it shows: graphics was cheap, the wood under the graphics wasnt smooth, the wheel wells werent sanded at all, really rough wood surface. no griptape, truck mounting holes were not very exact and quite large to account for that - also chipped wood around them, finally the wheel wells were not mirror symmetric and not even in the correct place before I sanded them for 30minutes. 

if I put that board next to my tesseract, you can tell right away by all the small details that its less than half the price.

none of these things really matter for me though - if you sand the board anyway and lay carbon sheets on it, the only thing that matters is the 3D mold and thats pretty cool. its actually a very wide board, wider than the tesseract and pretty cool for my footsize.

All valid points, truck holes were fine on mine so maybe it was a Spud that slipped past QC. I guess what I consider a cheap, low quality board is one of my generic blank decks that I don't feel very confident on because the design isn't quite up to par. I've put this Spud through hell and back and it's bailed me out so many times at high speeds that certain things like no griptape or cheap graphics make it hard for me to categorize it as poor quality even side by side with bigger brands.

Such a cool build!  Your blog posts helped me make the decision to build my own board.

It's a little hard to tell but did you drill through the wheel wells to attach your enclosure?
Was it just a matter bending the enclosure or did you put some padding in between?

I have a Jet Vulcan Kick and wondering if I should try and squeeze everything in between the wheel wells or get a few more inches of length on the enclosure and drill through them.  The Vulcan Kick has a variable wheelbase so I won't have to worry about wheel bite on the back wells with the trucks up front.

Thanks

@whitepony / @RunPlayBack  how is the kicktail on Jet Spud 29? I know it's super super mild... but can you use it to kick turn at all? (obviously the back truck mounted in the forward most position)

there is no kicktail. I have one without any electric components on it and i can just about kickturn it. Probably wouldn't work with 15+lbs of stuff strapped to it.

If you keep the pack weighted to the back and use S2 binding so you can use the vamp of your foot for pressure you can pop curbs and kick turn, but its work.

Ah crap... guess i just wasted $75 on bkb Spud 29". I was hoping to get a short deck with some what a useful kicktail and that is portable too... like 30" or less.

@mmaner I saw your post on short deck with kicktails... they are incredibly hard to find a quality deck in this small range.  I looked at BC Barracuda, Madrid... these are $65-75 boards so I know they won't be that gr8. How about this one?  Hi5ber Ion-30

I've never had one, I typically avoid CF because of the signal dampening.  You didnt waste your money though, grab you some S2 binding and you'll have a blast :slight_smile:

Buildkitboards.com It's the one from them. I been reading your posts. Maybe I will just hold on to it. Its only $75 and he hasn't shipped it yet. But if it doesn't work out I will flip it to you.

It's just that I grew up with kick tail boards and now getting back into boarding like 2 decades later I miss that function.

Bindings still scare me... except on MTB's offroad. Been thinking a lot about S2 bindings though... seems like you can pop out of them quickly if you are about to wipe but that may be subjective.

Like the kicktail is what made it fun.. I have a long narrow hallway just in my house and when I get down the end of it or on the street... I don't want to dismount to make that 90 degree turn. I know it's silly but we all have a notion of what we dream of and the silly comforts and that is mine... nostalgic or otherwise.

Ditto right..... it's the perfectly usable esk8 build for commuters. Maybe they made that decision before esk8 got so popular.

Look even metroboard 29" is pretty much a Jet Spud 29"...

Man if this thing just had a kicktail... wow it would just be like no-brainer (for me.. maybe many others).

wheelbase is 22-23.5" tho perfect in every other way exactly what I'm looking for but I think the wheelbase would be tight for a 6374 motor and 10s4p battery,bms,vesc.. could be wrong..hope I'm wrong
