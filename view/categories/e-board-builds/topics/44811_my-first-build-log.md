I had been wanting to post a build log on my budget board for quite some time (over a year), and i finnaly got around to doing so. The Electronics and stuff were fairly simple, but the hardest part for me, is that i decided to build the deck. I did this build back when I was 12, so if it looks like a newb's work, guess what? It is! I used a 90mm hubmotor drivetrain I got from ebay, and I am very happy with them. They are powerfull enough to get me up almost any hill, and because of the size, they are epicly smooth. For the esc, I used a 60 buck cheap ebay esc, which was sold by the same seller, and it workes pretty good. It came with a transmitter which I think is a winning clone. I used tupperware enclosures, and held up the dual 5s 3000mah batterys with metal strips, and battery straps. For the deck, I used 4 sheets of 8th inch baltic birch, and 2 layers of fiberglass. I then took an image of a loaded vanguars, and made a template of it, which I used a jigsaw to cut out. I would not recomend building a deck.
