Hey guys,

This is my first build so very new to this any help will be appreciated. So I went with the enertion mono Drive kit and there vesc. I also have 3 3s 5500 35c batteries and I'm going to put into series. I now need a motor I order the sk3 6463 245kv a few months ago but it's not in and HK basically said have your money back and won't send me a motor since they are still on backorder the everlasting joke. So I'm an ex college football player so I'm build big I'm 6'8 hover around 305-320 on my bad weeks. What motor would you guys say that I should get. I got care about going 30+mph 14-20 mph works just fine for me. 

Again Thank you guys so much hope to run into anyone that build their own board around SD.

You should be running a dual motor setup more powa! :fearful:

I was thinking that was way to much powa even at 50%  efficiency it will be about 34mph. I feel like I'll die haha

You'd gear for less speed and more torque, especially for your weight (man you're tall)! You should go duals for sure and gear for 3:1 if you don't want to go too fast. For 9s just stick with 150-200kv motors. What ESC will you be using?

enertion vesc is what I have on order and should have shipped out by now. I geared 2.4:1 since I got the the kit from enertion. What would you think is the best 150kv-200kv motor?

I'd definitely go dual, in real world you won't ever hit those speeds due to efficiency loss.  Power coming from both sides just feels a lot more even as well, specially when turning hard.  If you want two BIG motors, you can do a dual diagonal set up.  That will give you all the torque you need even at your weight.  You also should look at a deck that can withstand that weight.  

How about 2 6374 motors from torqueboards?  Or you can use enertions 6374s?  These will need to be in a dual diag set up though from my understanding, but you can ask @torqueboards what he recommends for a 300+ lb guy.  He may have a different suggestion than mine.

SK3's are good choice. The 149kv is pretty popular around here. 6374's (either enertion or sk3) are good as well. Running them in dual diag will ensure it can take you up steeper hills. I'm running dual diag myself with 5065 motors and I actually like how they balance the board a bit better.

I got ya I got a deck one of my buddies works at a skateshop in Huntington Beach so I got a deck that is 8ply maple that can hold 350lb. That's motors are massive with my batteries 9s 5500amh 35c what type of range do you think I'll be able to get out of it.

I live in a very flat part of San Diego so the hills shouldn't be a major problem do you think a solo would work on flat ground with the weight and height issue?

A single 6374 may work, but you'd be pulling a lot of amps through it. It'd be better to share the load. If you're sure you want to run a single, I might get 1 more 3s battery and run in 12s with a 149kv motor to lower the amp draw. You could expect about 20-24 km of range given a 5.5AH battery @ 12s.

```
To calculate range...

Figure out your battery's volts and capacity

Then do..

Volts x capacity (in amp hours...so 5500 amh would be 5.5 ah)

This will you give Watt hours, Divide by 10 to get your range in KM.

So my mind set is that I'm in the last year of college and money is a little tight and I already have dumped 600$ into this so I'm worried dropping another 300$ into it. I would like to do duel right now but I don't have 500$ extra I could do the paypal credit thing with no internist for 6 months but I hate living outside of my means.

I hear you, just try to get another 3s as mentioned above to make it 12s. It'll be better for your motor in the long run.

I'll order it right now. Thank you guys so much for your help hate to ask you for one more thing but I don't see any premade 4 male to one female series connectors I'm going guess I need to build it right or is their people in this group that builds them and sell them?

these are all luxury items haha, no need to go outside your means just to get dual motors.  First world problems.

P.S. I have a 9 ply maple deck, pretty sure I could put an elephant on it and it will be okay.

I'm sure you can get one of the community members to make it for you. Dexter from  will probably take the commission. Otherwise if you're comfortable soldering, they're not too hard to make.

I've never have done soldering before (Jews are not good at manual labor haha). I was thinking they shouldn't be to hard but I might mess it up and burn down my house. :slight_smile:

Hey man!  Good to see another normal sized guy here...  You got me by a few el bees, but not by much.  I'm 6'8" as well, but 265ish.  

I want to put it in perspective a bit - a single motor on the flats _can work just fine._  We won't get the range of guys half our size, but we are rolling and looking good doing it (with a better view)!

I ride my GF's single 6355 200k on 8s and move along fine.  I had a dual 5065 200kv that was scary fast on 8s as well.  I also have a marbel (single smaller 50'ish mm motor) and it ca get me going stupid fast too.  They all take longer to get up to speed for my weight vs someone 160lbs... but i don't mind and just love to ride.

gearing i usually go as low as i can.  Learned not to go down to 12t motor on 9mm wide belts (skips a lot), so usually do 13/14t on the motor and largest i can on wheel (usually 36t, but i've been eyeing some of the printed flywheel in 40/42t as well).

Soldering is a great skill to learn.  Making your own series connectors is pretty simple and a great one to practice on.  Spending a few $ now to get proficient will help a ton later and save you $ vs buying connectors each time you need one.  Hardest part is you need a pretty hot iron and bigger tip for larger gauge wire (basically a big heat sink pulling the heat away unless lots of surface area (big tip) and hot iron).

I'm building another board for guests right now - e-Sugar build.  Paused while i try to get a buddy's board built before he visits tomorrow.  He's up from your neck of the woods in Oceanside.  6'4" and setting up a single 192kv on 15mm belt.  Should work great w/ him being around 200.

Happy to help if you have any questions i can answer.  Best of luck!

Ya I agree with you and I also asked Dexter and they don't make those type of things but hey it's cool. I understand the concept of soldering but I never put it into the real world.I'll get some wires that I can mess up I'll get it to work. Is there any type of wire I should use and and type of solder I should pick up. I know lead is the best for it so I've heard. If I can even get half of 24 kilometers per change I'll be happy I'm to lazy to walk SDSU campus to massive. I can't wait to be 7f on the board must be super cool. Thanks for your help and imput bro mayeb see you around OS if your ever down here.

i love the convenience of Amazon for little things like this.

I get either the wet noodle or superworm 12g wire.  Important part is that it's silicone sheathed for higher temp and is much more flexible.

Dexter does have some great motors still - take a look at his 63mm offerings.

A single motor works, but for faster acceleration and any hills - two *is* better!  You could start w/ a single and add another dual diag later.  When $ permits.  That's what i'd do if starting out and didn't want to drop $$ right out of the gate.

Similarly the Enertion R-spec look like great motors.  I have a set of the original R-spec in red waiting for my next dual build.

HTH!
