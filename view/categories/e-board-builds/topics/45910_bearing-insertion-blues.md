I recently ordered a compete Urban Carver board direct from Trampa and believe I have an issue with one of the hubs. The bearing will not seat. I have contacted their 'customer service' and found that to be lacking as the advice given to me was to 'hit it with a hammer'.

I am keen to hear of some advice from people here on what alternative hubs/wheels I can use on my current board?
I have the Vertigo trucks and already have all the bearings and spacers.

Thanks in advance for your help. 
Really keen to get this board together so I can actually take it for a ride. Then comes the electronics.

If they told me to hit it with a hammer I'd find the nastiest Waffled hammer and beat the crap out of it.  Then send the set back for a full refund for giving me the shittiest advice possible!!!

Seriously. That's retarded.

Oh! and then I'd get some real wheels.

Here is the exact reply, word for word, from their 'customer service'.

"Look Anthony, im not sure what makes you the expert telling me how the things i make are meant to be brother, but i can assure you, please send me the the spoke and i will show you it fitted with the bearing.

Its not that you are taking my time as appose to wasting my time if your not going to do as i ask. Ive asked you to hit it with the hammer and it fuks up ill pay for it, what else can i say?????,  so if your reluectant to try me then what else can i say?

Spoke in the post. Say no more please.

Regards

Ted"

Have had the same experience with Trampa. Numerous problems with the trucks (airline crack), the wheels (play in the Superstars). They sent me some round rubber washers to squeeze between the wheel and bearings... of course with the friction and rotation this rubber just become one big mangled spaghetti after 2-3 rides. Got frustrated and still threw money at them, I switched to Hyperstars. They are better (they are plastic, not metal), but still not great as out of 4 hibs, the bearings do not fit identically in all of them. I tried MBS Rockstar 2 after and love them. For your info, I have an urban carver as well. And the 7 inch innovas fit on the MBS R2 as well. My 0.02; get the Rockstar2 and be done with it.

Try a rubber mallet. In one wheel, the bearings were loose, in the other, the bearings were too tight. I hammered gently with a rubber mallet under Ted's advice. The QC on the products seems to be lacking tbh. It's not normal that these tolerances are not always exactly the same.

Here are the same pics that I sent to Trampa. The pic with the bearing sitting up in the hub is as far as it will go. All of the others fit in very snugly, but this one will no go in without what I would call 'undue' pressure. You can also see that I have even tried to 'score' out the hub in question as I thought maybe there was some excess paint, etc, but this still doesn't allow the bearing to seat correctly.

Had a similar issue with a couple of the bearing spacers that came with my superstar wheels. It's almost as if their inner diameter was slightly too small for them to fit on the truck hanger shaft. Ended up having to grind the inside of the spacers down with a sanding bit on my dremel. 

That reply from customer service is honestly appalling though...

chrysler.

Clean the bearing outer race with some alcohol.

Put the bearing in the freezer.

Wait an hour or so.

Heat the hub up with a blow dryer, or heat gun turned down low. 

Take the bearing out of the freezer with pliers so it won't stick to your fingers.

Drop it in the hole.

Tap it with a block of wood if necessary.

I guarantee sucesss. 


If you have to take it out down the road just put the whole wheel in the freezer for an hour or two, and then take it out and warm up the hub then pop the bearing out with a drift.

You can hit it with a hammer just get a socket that matches the outside ring of the bearing. Line it up and slam that hammer down.

@trampa what a way to talk to your customers. As someone who has lead training on bearing installation/removal/maintenance I can't believe you're telling your customers to abuse a bearing while installing it. Not only will this certainly lessen the life of the bearing, it may render it broken before installation. If your bearing manufacturers knew you were recommending this type of installation they would be ashamed. Looks like you guys need to hit up one of the many reputable bearing manufacturers for training such as SKF, NSK, Schaeffler Group(INA, FAG), etc. What a joke.

Even states this on the trampa website

Thanks for pointing this out. Sure sounds like that could be the issue. 
Right now, Iâ€™m still trying to understand why I have been ill advised by a trampa rep and why they didnâ€™t pick up on this. 
I just hope that this type of thing does not happen to other people. If I would have known this was how their customers were treated then I sure as heck would not have made the initial purchase.

I'm not sure, but mine are opposite. The bearings are so loose they will fall out if you shake the wheel with the bearings facing the ground. No milling on mine either and I bought them some time ago. Maybe that step has been removed?

Good point. I've just got home and checked out the hubs again and yes, both sides seem to be anodised. It just seems like there are a LOT of inconsistencies with these Superstar hubs from Trampa and, after dealing with their aggressive customer service, it doesn't leave me with a lot of confidence in the product/brand.

Well made, quality informational video there. I'll definitely be watching more of his vids. While it sounds like the tolerances of those hubs are complete shit, if you where to take full swings like they do in that video would you really expect it to work perfectly? That's way over powering,  if you can't just tap it in gently with a hammer, you shouldn't put it in anyway cause you'd never get it back out when it came time to replace them. Besides I'd love to see a video of him full swinging onto the bearing and hub! After breaking it he could send it back and just tell him you told me to "hit it with the hammer and it fuks up ill pay for it, what else can i say???" Well he didn't say not to hit it super hard.  HULK SMASH!

Just wait till you do get it all together, and you have to crush fit that retarded, rubber o ring between the axle spacer, there-By creating excess play between the hub and bearing. Than a weird sound and vibration comes from the wheel.. 
I just leave it out, less play

Except that you would need access to one, if you don't have specialist tool like a hydraulic/ arbour press then for these itty bitty wheels a 1/4" threaded rod with some nuts is enough.

Pass the threaded rod through the assembly, big ass washers and sensibly sized sockets matching the outer race. Then nuts on each end.

Tighten your nuts

LOL, yeah, as crazy as it sounds, the worst part is that this is the advice given from a business that sells skateboard gear. "When all else fails, just smash it with a hammer". 
I've always been under the impression that a bearing should never get hit with any sort of force, but then again, what do I know - I don't sell the gear.

In fairness to Ted, he has probably changed so many bearings in his time that all he needs is a hammer for everything

I'm in two minds about this man. Firstly, I'm real sorry that this has happened to you, however, I am also grateful that it has happened (and you've shared it) as it shows that Ted, from Trampa is at least consistent with his 'customer service'. 
It's funny, I was talking to a mate on the phone last night. He was asking advice on a build he is planning. He really wants to base his build on the Trampa Urban Carver, which is what I had ordered. I fore-warned him about Ted and just hope that if he does order, that he doesn't have any issues.

It is a shame about all of this, as the overall product seems pretty good, and lots of people are using them. I understand that Ted would be a very busy man, but the bottom line of any business is the customers. Look after them, and they will look after you.
To add - Ted is apparently sending me out a replacement spoke with a bearing already inserted. Not sure if he used a hammer to do this, but I guess I'll find out, if and when the parts arrive.

I don't expect a response from trampa @GrecoMan.

But I have posted all interactions with trampa in the edited post above.  So everyone can see I'm not a super douchebag lol. I've truly been nothing but nice.  :(
