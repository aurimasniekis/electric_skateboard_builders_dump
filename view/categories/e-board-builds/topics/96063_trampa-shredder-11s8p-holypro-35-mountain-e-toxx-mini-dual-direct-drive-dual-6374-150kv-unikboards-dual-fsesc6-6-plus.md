I look forward to seeing how you manage to fit all those batteries to the board. Are you thinking top or bottom mount? I'm going with a 12s7p bottom mount on my Kaly, which is quite similar

Is this sarcasm or irony or that your post is meant serious. It will be a project for the next year and I wanted to collect some Opinions about my build plan. I'll print the enclosure stuff myself.
@Sn4pz The pack will be top mounted. 80 cells are alot. I'll be going for 30Q or VTC6.(Not quite sure yet). And for the bms, it will be a charge only.

That was my inspiration, but was also thinking about 11s(coz this is rare on builds). For the enclosures, I'll design something with my own touch.

Both.
well the thread had literally 3 sentences when I posted, no list, no nothing.

If you want comments try to specify what you expect in terms of performance such a range, speed, current draw, where you intend to use it, etc. 
Then it would be easier to fingerpoint to where there might be a flaw or not.

That is my expectation for the speed of my build. For the range I expect 50 km of range and I will shred mostly of the time through the woods and sometimes on street. Black Forest FTW. From this pack I could draw 60 amps per motor.
