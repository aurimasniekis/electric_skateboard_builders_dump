Yep still here. I make it to parke oeste at least one Sunday a month outside of July, August we ought to all meet up and ride some Sunday. I'd love to see your new battery.

@miquelcamps - the enclosure is a psychotiller creation, but I just got an oven and have the wood and kydex to vacuum form....gonna start making custom enclosures for euro peeps

Yes! I haven't seen you in Parque del Oeste but we are not going very often. I'm finishing the new e-skate with the new battery. I'm working with the enclosure now and in fact I bought a sheet of Kydex but I have to think how I'm going to build the enclosure. I don't see the point of the vacuum former for the simple shapes of our enclosures... I have to read more I guess.

Yes! I would be very interested in a Madrid eskate meetup!

Yea' I suppose a press form would work, but I just got access to small workshop with enough materials to build the vacuum former so i figure why not?

Nice build - I am looking at a similar Madrid deck. How strong is the flex? (I weight around 80kg) ... Currently you can get it as "scan" version for 60 euros here 
Do you know if the standard Madrid Trucks could be used/modfied for any (DIY) motor mount?

pretty good amount of flex for my 95 kg. Feels like way more than my 35 dollar eBay special.
