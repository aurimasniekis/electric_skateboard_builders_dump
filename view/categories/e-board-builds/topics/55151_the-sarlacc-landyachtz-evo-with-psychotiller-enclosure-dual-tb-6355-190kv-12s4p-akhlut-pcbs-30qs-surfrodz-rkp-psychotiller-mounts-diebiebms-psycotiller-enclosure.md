Alright, I'm an idiot....I posted my build under the wrong account....re-posting now for tracking purposes!!! Sorry for clogging your feeds yall.

First build ever here!! I’ve been learning alot from all of you guys/gals on this forum and decided to start up a thread showing my progress.
It’s been rpetty slow so far since I was starting from nothing and figuring this stuff out along the way. I’m an avid builder of random things so I have a few decent tools and skills laying around my garage and brain so i feel like this will eventually turn out pretty decently!
I’ve been riding my Loaded Tan Tien for a while now and absolutely love the deck so I decided to use it for my build.
I ordered my trucks and mounts through @psychotiller  to stay as close to my original truck set up as possible! Thanks for all the help and tips with this man!!
 
![trucks|666x500](upload://15GG9GsPfaa5dCbIRmuMT7mDenZ.jpg)


Picked up some Kegels from my local skate shop and through a pulley set from TB on there!
 
![pulleys|375x500](upload://7VHvyBw07Ajbt3luaoKVIj8IDsT.jpg)

After getting the mounts and wheels set up I realized I would have some clearance issues so I had to swap them around
 
![Mounts|375x500](upload://tsdwZKo4vdLOjmbGhjASNz4wFAb.JPG)


The 265mm belt from TB was just a bit too short and was pulling my motor out of alligntment so I found a place that would custom make some 270’s for me and the look like the fit perfectly.
 

![Old Belt|375x500](upload://lvkcDyQms7ZePk7PeW2BVEfRMLV.JPG)

Notice the right motor is slightly off once the belt was on…I knew that was gonna cause some issues!
 ![New Belt|375x500](upload://sUmqGaZY2uq5a9YKtK4YrreGs0i.JPEG)

I decided to try my hand at building a fiber glass enclosure and that’s what I’m currently working on. This is the first time I’ve ever used fiberglass and I’ve been learning alot about what not to do now!
 
![fiber3|666x500](upload://18JcJrMQdqnXrZbPIU1tpZMkqOF.jpg)

 
![Fiber1|666x500](upload://pbIWptNcGRnn4iU5VWenDg0mxoH.jpg)

 
![fiber2|666x500](upload://o4DoNreAIVMNJFPWdOftb52iTu9.jpg)

I wrapped the board with saran wrap and duct tape and made a quick mold out of some plywood and laid the fiberglass on the board so it matched the curves of the deck itself.
Here it is after doing a bit more sanding and shaping.
 
![fiber4|666x500](upload://kFQD6sfhUDPwSmtvZKhW9QUx8gD.jpg)

I bought some neoprene rubber to create a gasket and some vibration dampening for the batteries when i get them going. My next step now is to bondo the entire enclosure and get it smooth and ready for paint.
I bought some threaded inserts and will start getting it ready to mount on the board.
I also purchased a battery spot welder and next paycheck I’ll be buying my cells.
I have a few other parts on order right now, got @longhairedboy edder switch coming soon and a bestech BMS for charge and discharge protection. I bought a winning remote through the enertion part sale but I’ve been reading alot of bad things about it lately so I may upgrade that as well.
Bluetooth module and some other various parts are coming in soon too.
I need to figure out what VESC I’m going to use next though, I’m either going to get the FOCBOX or use TB VESCs…hearing good things about both!
I’ll keep chugging along on this build and hopefully have it all wrapped up by the end of the month!
I convinced the wife to get into this as well so she went out and got a boosted board dual XR (the last one around with the vangaurd deck) and has been having a blast on it!!! (We are a Loaded family…5 different loaded set ups between us both)
Hopefully I can get to the Bondo/filler tonight and have some more progress to report on later!


Once again, sorry for the repost, just wanted to be able to track it under my account!

The fiberglass looks pretty good for your first go! I would definitely recommend FOCBOX’s if you can spend the little bit of extra cash. Also, please don’t use the winning remote. They are very unreliable and can be the downfall of your board (and you).

Filled all the gaps and divots and added a bit more structure around the trim tonight with Bondo Glass, this stuff is pretty awesome but a pain in the ass to sand.

Sanded it all down and thought i had it nice so i threw some primer on there and noticed a bunch of rough spots that i will have to work on tomorrow, I'm tired of sanding for tonight.

That's pretty close to what I bought already....is that stuff going to be better than 1/8 neoprene?

After all the filling and first layer of paint, I feel like this enclosure is just a bit too heavy. I am currently building my own vacuum press table so once thats done I am planning on using this as a form for perhaps a carbon fiber replacement. 

I've decided to go with the FOCBOXs and finally really understand the difference between the BLDC and FOC modes....this forum is awesome!

Hows the flex on that deck? Be careful mounting that box, if there's any flex, you're going to find torn flanges pretty quick.

Its the stiffest Tan Tien they make, forgot exactly what flex it was.

I was a bit worried about that, are there any good ways to stiffen it up? The enclosure I made  is super thick and tough, almost too thick!

HEavy fiberglass will do a lot to add strength. Use plenty of bolts and don't forget to seal it with silicone when you finally have your settings dialed in. 

Don't do what i did and get caught in the rain while testing before you have your box sealed! that sucked.

I can imagine! But you are also in Florida....doesn't it rain like every 3 minutes there? (Guess it depends on what part you are in)

This fiberglass....I ordered the wrong stuff on accident but it may be my saving grace, its 16 oz woven strand glass and I threw 2 layers over the entire case as well as some strands around the lip. Also I used Bondo Glass to fill in any light spots and to reinforce the inside.

Its probably over kill but I figured I could use it as a mold for some decent carbon fiber later on if this doesn't work for me!


Thanks for all the tips @longhairedboy

I’m working on a Loaded Dervish build at the moment and also have a a Flex 1 [stiffest] Tan Tien board. These decks are extremely flexible, which isn’t something i’ve Seen that much of in most builds. 

I am going to try mounting my gear in multiple suspended enclosures to embrace and enable the inherent flexibility of the deck. I’d be interested to see how you go in stiffening up the deck. I suppose the board to enclosure bolts would have to be numerous and fairly locked down? Otherwise you would have to deal with all sorts of creaks and rattles as you ride? I imagined that approach might crack the enclosure long term?

how have you deal’t with motor clearance on the back? When i was mocking mine up [the dervish tails kick down a whole lot more] there appeared to be very little clearance between the motor, board and ground.

The fiberglass enclosure I made is pretty thick, I haven't mounted it yet but I'm hoping that its going to stiffen the board up a bit. If not, I am going to try and map out and still use the same mounting locations but use what you are talking about (the multiple enclosures) and somehow route my wiring through the deck. I may even try and throw a layer of CF over it all too to add a bit more rigidity to it.

The motor clearance is perfect once I reversed the mounts around....having them forward facing was just not going to work so flipping them around to the backside of the trucks really opened up the space.

I've drawn out 2 different battery scenarios....one being one large pack, and the other is 4 separate 10s1p packs dispersed across the bottom of the board, similar to how i see alot of trampa style builds made.

I'm going to measure out everything tomorrow and try and get a "to scale" drawing of both so I won't have to drill too many holes into my board.

Hey, if all else fails, I'll continue to push my tan tien around manually (it really is a kick ass deck) and order a stiffer deck that will fit my esk8 set up.


Have you done any planning for your dervish yet? I have a dervish deck as well, I love that thing!

I mocked up a battery enclosure with offsets on it's sides in Fusion 360 for cutting on my Shapeoko CNC, but i'll probably redesign that. Uni has kept me busy and I was waiting multiple months for parts to arrive, so there was no rush in my mind. There are a couple pictures on my build thread, which i should update soon. [eLLF Board](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/ellf-long-low-flexy-loaded-dervish-or-tan-tien-caliber-10-inch-dual-drive-mounting-method-10s1p-dual-focbox/40006)

I really llike the flexiness so, i'm going down the multiple enclosure route, but i've never seen them offset, so that will be itneresting to see if it works. My Dervish tail kicks down, so mounting it how you have it, i end up with like 5mm clearance either side of the motor, which doesn't work for me. I'm doing a reverse mount like you, but flipping the motor the other way, behind the wheel to give clearance. Something i also haven't seen done much.
Sketch for a bit of context.
![2|690x497](upload://rniOsheVVjI5X4ssrVijLsGA62m.jpg)

I am copying @namasaki for my battery setup, 5 x 2s1p lipo's and the 'new'bestech 10s BMS, a couple FOCBOX's. [High Power 10s Lipo Battery Pack with BMS](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/high-power-10s-lipo-battery-pack-with-bms/10014)

Tan Tien is a much more enjoyable board to be, the shape locks you in, and it feels more nimble to me. It ended up being too short to fit all my gear in the way i wanted too, so that board was out and the longer dervish, in.

Took me a second to get it but I see what you are talking about, had to go look at my dervish.

I'm debating on throwing a layer of CF over my enclosure to help it out a bit, but I'm been doing some digging and have found a replacement deck if needed!

I got my first focbox being delivered today and possibly my BMS so I can start planning my layout!

So my eyes are wide open now, after a few nights of staring and researching other builds, I think I jumped the gun on mine. I don't think the Tan Tien is going to work.

I'm gonna pause my build and finish my vacuum press and try and press a 1 inch drop down deck out of maple and see how it rides. If it sucks, I'm gonna grab a Red Ember deck from @treenutter and an enclosure from @psychotiller.

I have 4 days off, the press is almost done so I hope to have a deck before I got back to work!

Been doing some drawing over here! I took inspiration from everywhere I could look! Tired super hard not to make it look like a Red Ember board but @treenutter, your boards have implanted themselves in my head!

I used my Gibson Les Paul headstock for the ends, and a 4 1/2 inch angle grinder disk for the other curves.

I suck at drawing so this took far too long and I didn't get my vacuum press finished, but I'm pretty damn happy with the results of my first draft.

Its got a 32 inch wheel base, 10.5 inches wide and will have a flat bottom with concave on the sides.

What do you guys think??

Got the frame and table built for the press. Had to cut 2 inch strips to act as a clamping method to get the vacuum membran to stay on the fram. Drilling holes and mounting it up today, 

Still have to figure out the best way to mount it to the table with hinges but I have a few ideas. Once its done, its big enough to press 2 deck at once!

I also got the foam marked out and I'm going to try and carve it tonight....its difficult to imagine since I have to basically make it the reverse mold of what I want it to be in the end......hopefully I get it right, I did buy a huge sheet of foam so I can always try again!

I just learned a very crazy lesson in vacuum pressing a thick deck with more complex curves......do it a few layers at a time, not all 9!!!

The press started working perfectly but once it reached the right pressure I noticed that the top 4 ply didn't have the right curve on the side of the board. 

I took it apart and found that only the bottom 3 layers matched the curves of the foam!! I had to rush to peel everything apart and put just 2 layers in and get vacuum back on it before the glue dried.

I really hope i didn't screw up the other 7 plys that still have glue on them, everything is pulled apart and i wiped down as much glue as possible. 

I'm going to let the first 2 layer set in there for a few hours then slowly add each layer on top of it and hopefully I won't get any delamination. I saw a walkthrough from roarockit (or however you spell it) where they did this on a drop down deck and it turned out okay!

Quick update....work has been insane so I haven't made a ton of progress. My deck is almost done, most of the layers have pressed, doing them one by one is very time consuming and I can only really do one a day if even that if i'm lucky!!

On another note, I decided to get the N.E.S.E. kit from @agniusm to make sure my battery is super safe! I decided to use this as an excuse to go buy a 3-d printer so I've been spending a good amount of time getting it set up (and of course doing upgrades to it)

I printed my first try at one of his 4p enclosures and he approves of it....with a bit of tweaking of course! I ordered all of the hardware for it today!![IMG_4828|375x500](upload://dwA1xTP0HVC1650TvwibcDQmZJQ.JPEG)![IMG_4830|375x500](upload://2l2GIIeWMHpTB24qDLMhynm6kDP.JPEG)

I'm still chugging along on my deck, my press table def has a leak but I cant find it. Luckily its a super slow leak so the pressure never drops below 18. But I don't want to run the pump that hot so I'm letting it rest a day or so after each layer, only have a few more to do.

Okay all, alot of changes over here but I feel like they are for the best!!!

My friend has been convinced by me to build his own board so its allowed me to trade some of my parts to him for a set of @psychotiller's six shooters! So I did some upgrading of my parts list and I'm back on track now

 I'm trading him my ripba trucks and mounts and my besttech BMS for a set of six shooters.

I got a set of surfrodz RKPs with psycho's mounts and couldn't be happier with these things. I put them on my regular push board and hot damn they are smooth!

I got myself a spot for a DieBieBMS and just got that in the other day as well as slowly getting my N.E.S.E. cases printed up. Also decided to go ahead and buy a few extra batteries and jump up to 12s!

I just mocked up my enclosure set up and holy crap it all fits in there....juuuuuuussssttttt barely!

So I got a few hours of 3-d printing ahead of me before I start getting this going, but the printer is finally working pretty well and I'm printing one right now.

This has been a super slow process but I want to make sure its done right, now its time to learn how to get this DieBieBMS cabled up to my NESE modules and programmed while I'm printing everything.

Getting everything mounted up. Just ordered some belts.

Also got all my 3d printed parts for my NESE done finally! I'll have to tweak the DieBieMS case a bit, I'm running out of room in my enclosure!

I'm also 3 layers into the deck, doing the 4th and 5th tonight! So far, everything looks like its working well in the new vacuum bag, I'll post some pictures of that tonight!

I just printed the new case of the BMS last night, I'll mock up the mount tonight...it looks like the very last NESE case will have to go in at a slight angle but I'm not 100% sure yet.

My first mock up was with bad prints so its still unknown! But I'll get it to fit someway or another!

What battery holders are you talking about? The N.E.S.E is way more than just a battery holder. You have to buy the hardware from @agniusm. His kit is the full connection set up for a battery. It has the series tabs that go into the 3dprinted enclosures and connect outside of them in parrallel. They are rated to 200amp and can withstand tons of abuse.

The only problem is that they take up alot more space than if you just spot welded your pack together. But for me, I don't trust my spot welding skills so thats why i went this route. 

Also, if one cell goes bad, you can easily remove it and replace it with his option.

After getting everything printed I threw it all into my enclosure to see how much space I'd have. Short answer....not enough.

I'm going to cut the tabs off of the foxbox mounting plate and see if it give it enough wiggle room the fit down in there. Tonight I'm going to start laying some thick wire in between each box to make sure that I have enough for the cases and the cabling that is going in between everything.

I was right on the money with the amount of filament I had!!!
![IMG_5081|375x500](upload://zXP78Ftn4WwYIDKx6SKoiGYisXa.jpg)

Quick shot of the full enclosure, I have enough room on the sides of the NESE cases to run cabling, its just up by the focboxes where its tight!! Excuse the horrible printing on that BMS case, forgot to turn my fan on for that section!

What enclosure is that? it looks different from the one you were working on initially with the fiberglass? It looks like an Altar wedge and very similar to what I've got planned as well lol

Edit:
read the title again and it said @psychotiller enclosure lol so I'm likely right with the altar wedge? I've got the same setup planned with nese modules for the 2s4p but I don't have any concrete plans with the diebie bms so fitting the vescs in there shouldn't be as tricky? lol 

Would you happen to know the depth of the enclosure from the shallower non-recessed sides?

Yea, I was originally going to use my tan tien but it was way to flexy, so my fiberglass one is sitting on a shelf, maybe I'll use it for something else.

Its the enclosure for the shuggah deck, I'm making my own deck thats just a tad bit wider and longer than the shuggah. This build has changed like 40 different times while building and sourcing parts!

I can measure it up when I get home from work today!

I got it from home depot, its just basic insulation foam. The one thing I learned, wrap the foam in packing tape after you get your form made...my current one doesn't have the tape wrap and the breather mesh is creating imprints.

Main reason I say do this, if you want to use the mold multiple times its a good idea. If you are one and done with the mold, don't worry about it. I used the 3m spray adhesive and it worked fine, some other glues actually eat through the foam!

yep! I bought one of the big sheets and just cut it down. It has precut "snap off" points that are easy to use but I found that my shapes/sizes intersected with these so yet another reason I covered everything with packing tape.

Also another thing I found, with having the drop down and the flat tub concave bottom, the wood warped a bit where the wheel bite would be. I think I was trying to force too many complex curves. 

My latest mold is wider than the wood is and slightly sloped on the sides so the wood has more of a bed the sit on so its not under as much force in those sections. I got delamination the other way, I'm 5 layers in on this new mold and everything looks super strong.

dude, I didn't think I was going to be able to build mine. I just read and read and read and watched a bunch of videos and failed a few times.

I have 3 bad attempts that are all sitting there mocking me with their delamination and weird bends....but it makes me wanna do it more!

I've seen people make presses out of a couple 2x4s and pipe clamps, maybe $30 of material! I went a bit more than that because I am trying to learn how to make guitars too, and I want to do some flamed maple tops like Les Pauls one day so the vacuum pump and bag was a justified purchase....so I tell my wife at least!

Check this guys website out, (https://www.joewoodworker.com/) I built his EVS system and its been amazing, it will kick back on if the pressure gets too low, stays pretty quiet so I can leave it on for hours at a time. I ran the 2 layers last night from 6:00pm to about 6:30 this morning. Going to do the last 2 layers of the deck for a little long just to make sure its all solid before I pull it off the mold.

I'm the same way man, I planned out my parts list, then changed it, then bought some stuff, changed it again, changed it again!

Luckily I have a friend that I've convinced to build a board too so all the parts I've upgraded mid build he has taken and bought my my six shooters for trade!

But I feel like its all coming together pretty well, the only thing I'm a little worried about is the focboxes, it looks like its going to be super tight and the wires may get pinched, I may have to route out some of the enclosures to make channels for the wires to sit in till they get to the side of the enclosure where there is free space!

I got the press about halfway done and finally got my shipment of veneers! I got enough to do 5 decks with 11 ply. I'm going this weekend (hopefully) to get a slab of oak or poplar to have my friend CNC me a mold for the press! The CAD drawings are being done right now by a friends dad who has been doing engineering drawings for the past 15 years, so fingers crossed that works out too!

Oh and I built myself a quick rack to hang my veneers and boards in progress!

I'm up to 8 orders for decks and I haven't even finished the first one, people I know have alot of faith in me! I just have a few things I'm waiting for and then it will be happening!!!

Slow going over here.....my first deck turned out pretty good except for the very last layer, I had to scramble to get it laid up and it wound up bubbling up in a few spots in the vacuum press.

The deck is super solid and has barely any flex. I got a small router table built and mounted my router last night so I can do the final shaping of the ends and add the "round over" on the sides all the way around. I'm still going to use this deck for now until I get my hydraulic press built and make a replacement deck. Once the new one is made, I'll transfer everything over and hang this one up on the wall of my shop as a reminder of the lessons learned!
![roughcut|666x500](upload://48rzYowxb4VVgMe2LnLQcEKvCrd.jpeg) Here's a quick picture of the inital rough cut of the deck. Added in some indents on the side to act as pseudo handles.

The press is getting close to being done. 15 layers of HDF all laminated together with (eventually) 10 1/2 inch carriage bolts through all of it. The layers are pressed and laminated together now and I built a rolling base for it. Coating everything in some spar urethane so the wood doesn't swell down the road.![photo-1(5)|666x500](upload://1dF4XTD4FTPu4bmbEpO7RcM6883.jpeg) 
This thing is rock solid, I had my wife hold it and I was jumping up and down on it as hard as possible and nothing even budged, I know thats a big difference from having a dozen tons of pressure put on it but I'm feeling pretty good about it so far.

I'm going to use three 4 ton jacks for now and build a handle that will attach all 3 jacks together so I can pump them at the same time. I will probably upgrade to 2 bigger jacks and get some sort of a pressure gauge set up for more accuracy.![photo-1(6)|666x500](upload://kxIZTSUyU02p48Ssf53xJwhmzFy.jpeg) 

The 3d rendering of the deck was finished, but we decided to make a few tweaks to it. So just waiting on that to be finished. I sourced a big ole slab of oak to have it all cut out of when its ready!

Besides that, I have all of the parts I need to actually finish this! I just need to sand down the deck and shape it, then wire it all together! Work has just been insane and I keep getting distracted by making this damn press.

I was actually downstairs in the garage doing some work. My project at my day job has gotten insane so I haven't had much time to build. I'll take some more update pics too!

So right now: I have all the hardwood cut and planed straight to start vertically laminating them to make my mold.

I got a licenses to Solid works for free so I'm trying to figure out how to model it. My friend still has access to the CNC so thats going to be the thing that holds me back.


SOOOOOOO Yet another change! I picked up an evo and ordered an enclosure on @psychotiller's black friday sale! So since I'm having to teach myself all of this CAD and mold design, I'm just going to move this build onto the Evo deck so I can start riding. The custom deck all this other work has been for, will be the second build! So I guess its time to update my title with the Evo as the deck.....damn this build has changed so many times.

:open_mouth:

Please be careful when you receiver your nickel strip. Just relax for a second.

When I received my nickel strip I immediately started spot welding and was so hyped that I only thought about getting done.

I ended up making a hole in one of my cells and had to change the cell. It made a lot of trouble. Please be careful and take the time it takes.

It's better to get it perfect on the first try than to rush and have to do it over.

And remember to insulate the p-groups from each other with some fish paper or something else.

Good luck on the build!

I've been practicing with some cheaper nickel on an older cell from vaping. I'm going to do the same thing with the new nickel until I get it perfect!

I've spent so much damn time building up to this moment, can't let it all crash down now!

Ohhh yea. I forgot something. Remember to test the welds before you make the welds in the pack.

A good rule I've found is you should definitely not be able to rip nickel to battery welds apart with your hands. Be aware, nickel strip is sharp and can give you "paper cuts". If the weld is strong will it leave, the nickel that got welded to the battery, on the battery when you rip them apart with pliers.

And for nickel to nickel welds, if it makes a hole in the nickel strip when you rip them apart it's good.

Nickel strips got delivered today, doing the scratch and saltwater test over night and then hopefully will be spot welding some P packs tomorrow night!

I guess I'll through and update in here.

Working on my battery with the PCBs from @akhlut.

Got everything spot welded, now jsut slowly soldering the cell level fusing on. I have 4 of the 12 packs finished.

Once thats done, gotta wire up my BMS! I have all the supplies to keep this tight and safe so no worries there, its just a matter of getting spare time to work on it!

Looks good!

I need to take some time for myself and get my p-groups built!

Fish paper next! 

Those holders I sent you, I'd nip off the part that covers the bus and use two connections per bus for the serial connections.  It's just easier - you don't have to solder over the fuse.

All the P packs are done, taped, fish papered, gently encouraged, softly rubbed, and test fit in to the enclosure.

So its decision time. I have 2 single focboxes (as seen in the case) or a unity. I'm leaning towards the single focboxes since I have @JTAGs awesome BMS ready to go.

Its a super tight fit so I'm gonna have to either squeeze it in there, or find a new BMS.

Is there risk in mounting it on top of the battery? Of course with a layer of heat shrink/fishpaper/heatshrink in between it all.

Crap, won't fit on top, thats the fuse peekin' out the top there.
I think I'm stuck and can't use the DieBieMS in this build. 

![WIN_20190124_21_19_39_Pro|690x388](upload://gpDzxY2kmZt06PoG7LyEx9EUZsX.jpeg) 

I threw the unity in there just to see what it would look like, it gives me just a bit more room in there, but its still pretty close.

So unless I can find a way to get this BMS in there some way, I may have to buy a different BMS for this build and use the DieBieMS in my next build (I'm def going to be building more than one board!)

@Andy87 let me know I was being an idiot and could flip my batteries 90 degrees and save some space!

Looks like its all gonna fit now!![WIN_20190125_10_39_32_Pro|690x388](upload://vwMORbaSie3XaRSyywMzSRSnaUr.jpeg) 

Its gonna be all tight and snuggly in there. Now time to connect all the P packs and wire up the BMS.

With the amazing @Sender’s guidance, I spruced up my @psychotiller enclosure today. Still a lot of work to be done before it’s finished but this adds a whole other level of armor to my electronics now!![image|375x500](upload://nDeG40gN10tLlOUHrNlQjQkacrp.jpeg) 

Seriously though, if you want your enclosure carbon fiber’ed, hit up @Sender and pay him to do it...this was a bitch to get right and there are a lot of bad spots that he has all the secrets to get rid of! That dude is next level!

With the PCBs and a single stack enclosure, the way I'm building it I wouldn't be able to do 12s5p.

I'm sure with a bit of modifications and moving things around, also not using the PCBs, you could fit 12s5p in it.
