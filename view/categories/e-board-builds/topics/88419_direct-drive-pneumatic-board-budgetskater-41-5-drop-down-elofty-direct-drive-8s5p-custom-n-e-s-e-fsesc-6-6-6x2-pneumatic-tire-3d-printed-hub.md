This thread is to document my 3rd build. I am pretty happy with my 2nd build documented [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/basic-pneumatic-board-skateshred-41-drop-down-tb-218-fs-6374-tb-63mm-reverse-10s4p-n-e-s-e-with-diebiems-fsesc-6-6-6x2-aliexpress-pneumatic-wheel/67482?u=mishrasubhransu) and I have put more than 400km on it already. I am going to be reusing a lot of the ideas that worked well with the previous build, while correcting the mistakes made. In particular,

I am keeping:
1. 6x2 pneumatics
2. NESE battery pack
3. Wheel guards
4. drop down board
5. Shielding motor from tiny rock impact
6. Trolley handle at the back
7. Start switch at the back too

I am changing:
1. NESE box design and mounting style
2. Enclosure will now be 3d printed and given a glass fiber skin for better fit
3. Better waterproofing
4. The phase+sensor wires will now plug into connectors near trucks
5. charging connector will be in a 3D printed box placed near start switch

For the eLofty DD, do check both the stores [ cheng182018](https://www.ebay.com/usr/cheng182018?_trksid=p2047675.l2559) and [ke2155](https://www.ebay.com/usr/ke2155?_trksid=p2047675.l2559). I don't have a fixed link because they keep on expiring.  You could also make a offer to the seller. 

Here is a [link](https://calc.3dservisas.eu/?RY-9DsIwDITfJTNCKUnKz-qiTqBISHSnGYpE2kodEe-O71rK9p3tO9tv85DOnMzrOfRmo-Kqwm1L5UluygdSVAokUdoFaykqqGJuVJGdeQiRheKICAfApLP0jRFVT6IJxCgXiCiWxDWo7WRJarszzrLEO-wenGVJygjfw53jALcn_tdnYRmPpWbiA5hO9eX3TKqbFbHsaM3nCw==) to the esk8 calculator with my build information.

# Update 1(03/28/2019)
The deck came. It looks and feels really good at $40 shipped. Almost the same size and quality as the skateshred deck from my  second build, just a tiny bit wider which is perfect. It's 9 ply, so pretty stiff and that's preferable for speed, also I don't need flex for city rides because I'll be using penumatics.

Since it's a blank board, I am starting to think of colors. The first thing that comes to my mind is black and second is gold. The medley might actually look classy if done right. I found a few pics that I can draw inspiration from.

Not the same seller, but very similar in looks and same price too. It's what I had been using on my 1st build too. I cannibalized it( will replace motor bearings and put the setup for sale soon) and will put it in this new build. The link I posted above was what I obtained by quickly searching ebay.

Another example, https://www.ebay.com/itm/10S-36V-20A-BMS-PCB-PCM-Li-ion-Lithium-Battery-Protection-Board-for-e-bike-TE986/192843316761

My seller was [bestbuystreets](https://www.ebay.com/usr/bestbuystreets)

I don't know. I can ask the eLofty people. Is there any way of knowing without opening the motor?  I don't think so.

If you run them yes. You can get from the app or vesc tool. Just say it because by the data I saw it I aspect a 70 or 75Kv motor. That will a bit too much for your scope and I am afraid torque will be really affected. I am doing something similar but asked for a custom 60Kv which is still a bit to much. I asked for delta or wye because if they are delta you can always chenge the configuration to wye and get lower Kv.

Is this considered direct drive?  I thought direct drive was like the carvon motors, a motor directly on the axle that hooks DIRECTLY to the wheel, like a hub but allows any wheel.  It's hard to tell, but looks like your board has a geared system of some sort?

You're right about the direct drive, the pictures on top of the post are just to show the previous builds, so yeah they have pulleys
