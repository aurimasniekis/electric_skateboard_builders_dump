Hello all,

I have been part of this forum for little over a month now, and have been amazed by everyones build and tips n' tricks for building a board.

I had some school life to get over. I did spend a little hours here and there during my school but now that its all done, I can spend a few more hours.

Board:
I was able to make a design for my board and sent it off to a store on Etsy named TravelSkateBoards. ([https://www.etsy.com/shop/TravelSkateboards?ref=l2-shopheader-name](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TravelSkateboards?ref=l2-shopheader-name))
They were able to make my design. 9ply.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/8/681aeb5b9b8d67c8b9d45042776243785cfb0996.jpg" width="375" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/e/eeae4ba7c4fa5eccbfb4f524d48a9bdfda05ddc7.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Trucks:
I ordered these trucks initially: 
[http://www.zumiez.com/caliber-ii-fifty-184mm-satin-blue-longboard-trucks.html](http://www.zumiez.com/caliber-ii-fifty-184mm-satin-blue-longboard-trucks.html)
They were really nice, but too bad they shipped these in a flimsy crappy box with zero padding whatsoever. :confused:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/7/47af66753d25fe9d8f751c34c2c1d534deb3d563.jpg" width="281" height="500">
So then they looked like this:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/0/4077a749d0847ae9108a32af71c588e14a91ca09.jpg" width="281" height="500">
So being cautious, I returned them. (funny story later)

I then ordered a pair of trucks from here.
[https://www.amazon.com/Caliber-Longboard-Trucks-Wheels-Package/dp/B01IJ8JZAK/ref=sr_1_28?s=outdoor-recreation&ie=UTF8&qid=1482362610&sr=1-28&keywords=caliber+raw+truck](https://www.amazon.com/Caliber-Longboard-Trucks-Wheels-Package/dp/B01IJ8JZAK/ref=sr_1_28?s=outdoor-recreation&ie=UTF8&qid=1482362610&sr=1-28&keywords=caliber+raw+truck)

Put them onto my board and:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/b/fb61fb8827fd61b0f544265f66f6e770e1465f41.jpg" width="281" height="500">

I just received a special delivery this afternoon and it turns out it was Zumies trucks. :open_mouth: I didn't think i reorderded them so I called customer service and turns out their warehouse mistakened the receive of return as a output delivery and resent them to me. Rep asked me, "I will fix this for you no problem, we will give a full refund, just dont send them back. Is that fine with you?" OH hell yeah.

So now I got this:

I am thinking about adding either some paint, or a painted vinyl overtop with some clearcoat on the underside. A picture like this:
https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vzR1p5GCJ2A/Vh1u13HxUtI/AAAAAAAAARM/GwbmZ4b6Dus/w800-h800/shadow_king_by_x_spirit.jpg

Motor:
I organized a group buy for SK3 Motors directly from the manufacturer. It is in the payment process at the moment, but soon I will get them within January. Saved some money doing a groupbuy, and saved many other users some money that aren't in a rush.

Battery:
Am thinking about making a li-ion pack. Specs are still unknown.

Will post more details as I get more things. :slight_smile:

$45.00+$10 shipping. I did go with it since, he showed me pictures as he went along in the process. I did annoy him with multiple designs and got his input of what would and wouldn't work out. And since it was a small store, had to support Small Business Saturday.

It actually does have a little flex, I just didn't want too much flex, as in my case I weigh about 170-180 (but I will rather say 170lb. :) *dont call me fat* ), carrying a college backpack weighing about 10-15lbs. Every day I gotta go up and down a hill from the car lot to and from classes and it gets tiring especially when the weather is this cold/hot.

*Please don't blow up*

Question1.)
So in order to do a test of of this battery is truly 8000mAh, I need to fully charge to 4.2V/cell [(12.6)volts total]  and then discharge down to....... 3.3V?
Question2.) 
I am about to make a connecting harness to put together 3 lipo battery packs. So I want to know what type of gauge wiring to use.

Yup those look like cold solder joints. Are you using flux? If not you should get some. First tin the wire and the connector separately before soldering them together. If the wires come apart and touch each other it will be disasterous.
Worst case scenario if it doesn't work for you try and find an electronics repair shop to do it for you.

You need way more solder on the wire too.
Since you're soldering to a flat, I suggest also flatting out the wire. I use a pair of pliers and press it down on the flat.
It'll make it a whole lot easier to solder flat to flat.

I went to homedepot to buy some better wire, got some 10guage wire that only has 7-10 strands of copper in it, versus the wires above that had like 15 thin strands. 

I do suck at soldering as I spent few more hours today.
I went to a radio/electronic shop and they wanted $45 dollars to solder my connections with my own wire. Just for 7 solder joint..........

I think I got one wire soldered very well and was able to get it slotted into the connector casing, need to work on the other wire, now.

Well, it depends. Some paint dont stick well to the lacquer. Other paints bleed out into the wood making a messy result... maybe ask in the shop what paint and spray lacquer to buy - and in which order to apply.

If you have a heat gun you can heat up the grip tape to get it to release easier, then re-apply it.  Putting more on the missed edge will likely just peal and you will be able to see the seem.  I typically seem in the middle, either horizontally or vertically depending on if the sheet is too short or too skinny, if I have to use multiple sheets.

Just a quick question, I was riding in a parking garage yesterday and when not loaded, my board curves to a side. Could it be the truck holes are not straight? 
I also notice a rattling noise when riding, sounds like the spacer is jumping around on the axle. How tight should the wheel be?

@NickTheDude @wmj259  I use heavily angled riders on a few of my boards, a quick solution if you don't want hardware bending is to also make angled washers. Don't have any pictures at the moment, but I went and got some thick rubber washers for 50c each at a hardware store and sanded them so that the nut is still parallel to the board and the bolt stays straight. Super easy - and if you don't want to waste money I found that making risers out of spare plywood is also very simple if you have a belt sander and scroll saw

These are 6 degree risers. Bolts didn't bend because bolt holes in deck are 1mm bigger than bolts. I just bought way too long bolts.

What a monster.

It turns out that I will need risers to mount the motors as the edge of the motor hits the deck on turn. 
I did order some risers, but found out that my hardware just isn't long enough to hold it. Will run by to Zumiez tomorrow and get some longer bolts.

Quick question, every time I connect the wiring harness for all three batteries I get this loud spark. I know its from the surge of current, but is it bad? Sparkswitches basically slow down the instances rise of current so that would be my best solution.

Some people believe the spark is not bad, but I have blown caps on car ESCs. The spark will also slow degrade the connectors where the spark happens. Easiest solution is to add a xt90 antispark connector

I had to run to HomeDepot to get bigger hardware because I had gotten a 1/2" risers and the current hardware 1.5" wasn't long enough. After fitting the 1/2" risers on it still was just barely touching the motor mount so I added a 3/16" shock pad to it. And now it looks like it's got just barely enough clearance for a full carve.

Incase anyone ever needs longer hardware run to HimeDepots bolt/hardware section and look for these.

That clearance is real pain in the ass. Personally i like low boards which ofc means less clearance between motor and road. It's really shame to look at my motors now. I've been riding about 100km and my motors look terrible. In your case your motors won't look that bad at all which is nice.

@jaysoncena 
I discharged down the lipo down to 3.37 volts, then I recharged the lipo back up to 4.17 volts. Because I wasn't sure if my charger was good I kept that 0.03 volts as a tolerance.
I also kept track of how much mAh was being taken out of the lipo every time I discharged it because it took about 4-5 days. I took pictures and added it up

My decision to make this was being kinda embarrassed (not really but felt shy when I was walking with my board and someone with a boosted board walked by. I noticed his enclosures (made that way) were quite slick and very neatly made, while I was using a $3 kitchen Tupperware from Walmart.

Held up by bungee cords 

In your case  I would agree that you go the ghetto bagging method, because you will definitely need to compress the carbon fiber a lot more that what a vacuum box provides. Your gonna have to compress all the resin deep into the fiber and the compression will help squeeze out extra resin.

What's your setup? My advice would be, If your using a box, you'll have to raise it so constant chill air flows through. Don't capture the hot air, let it flow up like a hot air balloon but have a hole at the top to let it go through.
I haven't made mine yet but that's how I'm thinking about it.

Depends on the kind of heater, if it's a convection heater that could happened, but if it's a radiant heater you don't have to raise it as transfers directly to humans /objects. 
I see what your saying now, if you do raise the box a little bit above and trap the air, that would be the better option. That way cool air flows over the heater but doesn't get lost.

I took a stop by Goodwill and Savers, I went to the kitchen aisle and looked around for a toaster that's big enough for the sheet, came out shirt. But on my search I came across a tray warmer I presume. Good thing about it was it has a smoker element in it, and it comes with a lovely ceramic enclosure. 
And it was separable so  I can put it onto a different enclosure if I need. And it was cheap

It's been a while since a update. I had a few minutes today to make a heat box. Will need to temperature test it, but its not the neatest.

For the pro enclosure makers, is this a good setup for three lipos with dual vesc on both sides?

After this everything should be set to warm up the abs and get a First try. 

Let's see how this goes.

I think I Oh it a roadblock, so it seems that even though the heater is at  300°F the abs is only. Hitting 200°

There is some sag, but poking the abs doesn't even seem plasticy

From what's I've seen others do I think you may need two heaters or a better insulated box

I'm going to go the same route as what
@Cuprani did with his build. Using Velcro.

Just had some free time today and it seems my vesc has blown a DRV maybe. Three red lights flash. Gonna see how my warranty works out.

In the meantime, my brothers fun annual year project was to build a Drone. I told him make it a racing one.
