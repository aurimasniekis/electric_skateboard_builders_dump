Here it is; my sick mountianboard. I've wanted to go off-roading on all the local trails for a while now so I made this.  I'm pretty satisfied with the result but could see myself adding another motor in the distant future. I'm liking this chain and sprocket drive train, ther's no chance of slippage from derbies or torque. These 8" pnummies offer a nice plush ride and enough height to get over stones and rocky slopes. 

Thanks to all of you, this wouldn't be possible without your innovations and good deals.

It tops out at about 22mph which is plenty for the trails around here. Could be a bit faster but I need all the torque I can get from my single motor. Lasts about 8-9 miles mixed terrain at 25wh/mile which is pretty good imo!

Future changes include MBS F1 bindings which are in the mail and I need to finish up  the top box to have my connections sprouting out he top (kind of like a Trampa monster box). 

Does great on dirt and stoney trails, OK on lush grass, and grippy as all hell on tarmac.

I have the metr log for the initial ride:

Hope you like it! Expect more selfie stick shots in the future. I do feel a bit like a dweeb with the stick though lmao.

Well, that's gotta be one of the most minimalist ATB builds on here, but it looks solid, and a good base to build upon. The battery wires hanging out there look a little sketchy, but straps or a router job would fix that. It looks pretty light though. Would you mind weighing it? Probably need to weigh yourself holding it and subtract your weight not holding it, if your scale doesn't measure that low. Welcome to the wild world of eATSk8s!

I took the time to finish up the batt box this afternoon. It's not the cleanest looking but it get's the job done. 

Fist I routed holes the shape of my connectors and hot glued them in when everything was lined up straight.

Then I started adding a few coats of ABS cement
