Seriously impressive man. Nice work! I too am interested in your jig. Did you design the template? How long is it? Also I would love to see some shots of your CNC machine. Did you design it or base it off plans. I'm thinking of putting one together for my highschool ( note- I'm a teacher not a student :sunglasses: )
