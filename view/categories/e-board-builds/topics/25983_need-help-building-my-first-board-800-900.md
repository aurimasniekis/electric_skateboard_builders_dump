I currently live in the springs area so not much hills here or anything. I want to use a board to just have fun riding around and getting some starbucks and such xd. I do not currently have the tools to drimmel and saw stuff down and stuff (I'm pretty new to EBoards.) my budget is $800 - $900 including a good longboard deck. I was wondering if you guys get help me get compatible parts that I could simply just assemble together in this price range?
