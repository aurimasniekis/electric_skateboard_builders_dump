OK, so where to begin.

I have been building and playing with esk8 for a couple of years now. 

My first build swapping out parts from my GTX onto a landy switchblade 40 and adding an 10s8p pack.

and my last build being a Lacroix DIY
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/lacroix-12s5p-21700-cells-unity-trampa-unik-mbs/

As many of you have done, I purchased all sorts of tools(toys) and gizmo's during my eskate adventures, from 3d printers to spot welders. This "hobby" comes with a steep learning curve and i've made plenty of mistakes during the course of my builds but enjoyed it all. I've also become a member of a great community here in Perth. 

So where am i going with this?, well, I am now in the process of manufacturing a very small run of specific eskate designed custom decks. This deck design is not going to be for everyone, as it's a mountainboard hybrid and will be one of the widest decks available. I decided to design my own deck, as i struggled to find an "off the self" product that met all my requirements. 

So a couple of design details.

* it is roughly 11.5 inches wide.

* 37 inches long tip to tail, with a standing platform of 27inches.

* deck has an aggressive concave and footwell to lock you in, but with a very very slight w-concave to allow you to quickly shift weight. 

* deck consists of maple + 2 layers of carbon fibre to reduce distortions and any warping over time.

* the enclosure is designed to take the following battery configuration, 12s6p of 21700 cells (my preference) or a 12s7p of the 18650 cells.

* the enclosure will be made of carbon fibre, (this option is expensive in comparison to say PC or fibreglass, so perhaps this may change depending on feedback).

The deck and enclosure is designed as a long range cruiser deck. The deck is currently being built by a quality bespoke deck manufacturer in Utah. The manufacture of the enclosure is being negotiated with a number of potential suppliers. 

The plan is to get perhaps 10 or so of the deck made up in the first run and if there is enough interest, perhaps more.

I don't have an exact price per unit yet, but be warned, this will not be a cheap option as I am looking for a premium build and don't wish to reduce the quality for the sake fo a few bucks.

If you are interested in this deck and enclosure, let me know. 

(please ignore the CAD model of the trucks in the images below, that part was very quickly drawn up, for illustration purposes only.)

oh and i'll explain the name "RAMM board SLR" in a later update.

@moone  speaks highly of you so that in itself should have me running for the hills lol

Looks like an interesting project though joking aside.  One thing to consider if you are going to manufacture that deck design is that the lacroix with its strong carbon enclosure highlights a weakness at the angled ends.  I have seen 2 break at that point now, granted they were collisions but still worth noting at this early stage that that area may need some beefing up.

Good luck with it and keep me posted.  I'm over the other side of the country.

Interested in the deck, (If I don't laminate my own impatiently) however I don't want or need the enclosure.  Is that a possibility?

Sure, however, I don't think we will be ready to ship anything for a few weeks.

What kind of time-frame would we be talking then?  And how much for just a deck, no enclosure? (Will be using 8P NESE modules so you enclosure won't work for me)

I would be interested, currently in the market for a new board after my old one got stolen :frowning: and am looking to possibly get a mountain board.

@L0J3M4 Sorry to hear about your loss, 

The board is still under development, currently playing with designs and the deck forming process. It will be a few weeks yet before we have a finished prototype.
