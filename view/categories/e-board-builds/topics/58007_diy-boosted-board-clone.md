Currently I have the ESC Substitute, the same one that Meepo used in their first boards.
The Focbox will come in a few days

When they are dry, I'll sand and paint them! :slight_smile:

I've added too much of part B for the resin and it caught fire... Be careful!
(it's poliester resin, I was supposed to add about 2-3% of part B to the mix.)
