Been on the forums for about a yesr and a half and realised I've never started a thread 😂 - sooo here's my latest build, also my 9th build. (I should stop this addiction..)

It's not quite done yet, griptape isn't applied plus ordered some gold fender washers for the enclosure mounting screws. (Plus maybe adding a crisscrossed grey graphic below to make it look more boosted like.)

They're the DIYEboard's motor mount kit. The motors are 5055s 270kvs and the belts are 12mm wide. I've since sold them and am transitting to implement my gear drives on this board.

Some updates to this build.

* I got rid of my diyeboard's dual drive and changed to my [Dual AVIO Urethane Gear Drive.](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/gauging-interest-the-aortal-gear-drive-63xx-50-caliber-ll-compatible-97mm-wheels-and-above-tested/67496/226)

![IMG_20181215_182427|374x500](upload://ptaLzWQHTThQZfAwfdDMtIOcWsb.jpeg) 

* My Unity came 5hrs ago, so i decided to put it into this build. Loving it so far, good job @Deodand ! Setting up the Unity was weird for me at first (a few hiccups here and there, but i got it sorted.)

![IMG_20181215_184335|670x500](upload://sHsU7Vvc0fOVPJkxY3LYdgPdNpm.jpeg) 

* Painted the cores black, because yellow didn't go with the look I was going for here.

![IMG_20181215_182530|666x500](upload://6qQiiJugExtn3Hrya4rqWLdRfCo.jpeg) 

* Changed the remote to a hoyt remote to complete the bamboo look. :smiley:
