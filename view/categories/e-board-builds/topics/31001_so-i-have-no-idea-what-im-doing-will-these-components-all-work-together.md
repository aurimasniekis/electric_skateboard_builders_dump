Yes, those will all work, however I've got a few suggestions.

First, on the ESC, if you're going spend $110, you should get a VESC. It's specifically made for electric skateboards and will give you a lot more customization ability. 

Second, on the motor mount, I don't think it'll work very well with paris trucks, it's more squared off trucks, such as the caliber 2 trucks.

Third, I'm not sure how good that gearing is, as I haven't ever used it, but it may be low quality and you could find yourself having to replace it in a few months so my advice is start off with better quality gearing and save money down the line.

Hey! nice build!
i need to say that iÂ´m with @pennyboard you should get a VESC for that money... i would recomen the one from DIYE diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/ its $100 so $10 cheaper for maybe upgrade your pulley... i would recomen the ones from they too here is the link too diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/36t-abec-drive-pulley-belt-combo-kit/ and i recommmend because they include the screws to mount the pulley in the Wheel but this ones in particular is for flywheel or clones... so consider that and for last! diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/male-male-servo-connector/ this connector so you can Cconnect VESC to your RC Receiver.

ps: take pictures of your longboard and the process plz! 

and Happy build!

I have changed it to a VESC, I got so invested in finding a cheap ESC that I didn't realise it started to cost more! 
I was thinking about that, would it be possible to file down the edges of the trucks to make them more square instead of getting new trucks?
I will use the money saved on the VESC to upgrade the gearing.

I will do all of those upgrades, I had looked at those exact ones at the start of planning but I started looking at ESC as they were cheaper, but I got so invested in ESC's that I didn't realise it started to cost more! 

I will be ordering all the parts this weekend, I am also going to order some XT90-S's to make a loop key instead of dropping $60 on a power button, which is a ridiculous amount.

Pictures will be on the way!
