Does anyone have some budget builds or parts lists that they can recommend for someone who is somewhat new to the Electric Skateboarding community.

Thanks

Seriously though, it looks like a minefield but when you break it all down it's not that bad to find what you need. Don't get too involved in the whole picture, start simple. 

**What deck**

* What enclosure
* What size battery fits into it

**What drive train**

* Hub/DD
* Belt/Chain
* Gear

**What ESC**

* Budget dual or single
* Premium dual or single

**What trucks**

* Long or Short
* Cast or precision
* What mounts go on it
* What motors fit on them

**What wheels**

* Pneumatic
* Thane
* What size for comfort and clearance

After that it's many many small decisions that lead to a full build. Read before you buy, don't just buy a motor for example because it looks like one that people said was good. It's probably a POS.

Golden rule number one, every fucking time... buy cheap, buy twice and eat some pavement as a reward for your tight wallet. It's always better to buy over time if your budget is low and build a decent board. A rushed board will explode or sit in a closet once you've built a decent one, which you will.

Add mounts from @Boardnamics

Maybe use a flipsky 4.12 + instead as well.
