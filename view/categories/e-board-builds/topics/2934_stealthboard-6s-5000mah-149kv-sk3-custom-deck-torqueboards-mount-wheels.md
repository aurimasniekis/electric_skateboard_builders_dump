For those of you who haven't been to this page before, I will be keeping the pictures and dates below so that you can see the edits and progress that I've made. For those of you who may have the same problems that I am having/have run into, I hope you can maybe learn something from my mistakes.

(5/5/16) 
Hello, this is my first build, but it's coming along nicely. With a budget of 500 and a decent amount of resources around, I've made progress. For starters, I have a custom lasercut deck that I'll be staining and adding griptape to in a couple of weeks. I've already mounted the trucks and wheels, and I intend to mount the motor soon. I charged the batteries last night, and will test run the motor later today. Where I'm stuck is the enclosure. I have a 3d printer that I can use, and about 50$ left that i didn't spend on the initial parts. Any suggestions to help would be greatly appreciated. Here's a picture without the electronics:

(5/6/16):
Thanks so much for the suggestions guys. Here's a picture of what I added to the board last night. Haven't been able to test the motor yet because the connection to the ESC from the batteries is weak, but Banana connectors are their way in the mail.

(5/7/16):
So I took the trucks off temporarily, and stained the board. Will be putting polyurethane coating on it tomorrow. (Picture below) Unfortunately though I'm still stuck on the enclosure, except for a different reason. Can't figure out how to make it so that I can switch the circuit between running the lipos and the motor to charging the lipos.

(5/9/16):
Rejoice! My banana connectors finally arrived in the mail, which means I can complete the circuit and test out the motor. I'll solder those on later today. The stain on the board looks incredible, all I have left to do with that is put on the polyurethane coating and then slap on some grip-tape (most likely with a lasercut design). Here are some pictures:

UPDATE: (5/13/16)
The 3d print worked somewhat. My ESC enclosure failed, and the lid for the battery enclosure failed, so I used a dremel to cut old abs, and glues multiple layers for a decent lid. It is secured with hair pins and more glue.
Here's a picture before and after I put on the lid:

So I'm still stuck on the enclosure, but for a different reason. I can't figure out how to make it so that I can both have the lipos running the battery, and then later on charge the batteries without disconnecting any wires (which would mean unscrewing the case every time if i had to). Any suggestions?

UPDATE: Nvm, I'm going to go the cheap route. 3d printed enclosure, and I'll just unplug the batteries when I want to charge. Thanks for the suggestions though!

I have the enclosure figured out, but a new problem popped up with charging. I have my batteries wired together with a 6s connecter, but i'm told i'll need to cut one of the wires for it to work. My batteries are wired in series. Which one should I cut?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/00d6bcf3f2a091d5b0e8eab4299d69bcf7727157.JPG" width="375" height="500">

BIG UPDATE: So I've made a lot of progress since my last update, sorry for not posting for so long. As far as the enclosure goes, I attempted to 3D print and it worked well, except I got the dimensions wrong. I managed to fix it with the dremel, only to have the entire thing melt after about 30 minutes of running and testing without any of it actually on the board. I added a specialized 3D print as a cover for my motor, but I secured the bolts to tightly and so it snapped. Back to square 1. I managed to then buy a simple tool box as @joop1987 suggested, and that seems to be working pretty well. I also went out an got xt90 connectors, a big bulky but they work well with my clumsy hands and they were much more reliable than electrical tape that I used to hold he wires together for motor testing. Over the past week, I managed to make progress with the polyurethane coating whilst trying out my Quanum motor. It seems to be a dud, connection constantly failing, and it only actually turns on half of the time. I'll be sending that back to Hobbyking with their no-fuss policy (30 days). So that's it for now, here are some pictures. Any suggestions for a "plug and play" controller would be appreciated. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/fa9e169e25a318fc9a934f45fbd631b6ea67346a.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7466a533f63378dbe018cae215de9da1c639a17d.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/fbf80be0d4a3e1122c1c52738318b1682f0bcd6e.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/29fb23ffcb6a17de7b23f9ba611f18d1ad597ead.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f794ab9a60c6c898f2d3cd19594325f53f28c6eb.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/efacad5716e1a669b2b043748bbff0533d3bb58d.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Another UPDATE:
So it turns out the Quanum controller works just fine. A bit cheaply made, but I had the trim totally wrong and the trigger was a bit jammed but I cleaned it out and it is running smoothly. Also finished the new enclosure and got everything mounted. Haven't finished with the griptape, but that'll be the next step. Here's a pic right before the test ride<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/d73f2b79624a72e6db8072a5cdaa0edbecda15aa.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/af2597340a00fb61104221625ff3cb4124264043.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

Took the board for a 3 mile ride today, got home and plugged the cells into the charger. It was telling me that each of them was at 3.94, (x 6 = 23.64) but overall it's supposed to be 22.2. This means that in theory it has an incredible range. Is something wrong? Do the batteries have more voltage than advertised? Originally I was told 10000 mah in 6s would mean 6 miles of range.

All was going well. I was happy. Got home from a long wedding and really wanted a ride. Then, I go to plug my batteries into the reader to make sure I have a charge, and they started smoking. I unplugged them immediately, and then plugged in individually. One is perfectly fine, the other now has a dead cell. I think it was the connector to read the cell count, but I don't know why it would be having problems now where it wasn't before. I know that people say to cut a certain wire, but I didn't do that and it worked fine before. It must have been the connector that killed the cell, but I still don't understand why. Does anybody know how that whole thing works and why we have to cut the wire?

You can think of charging your battery as a single 6s battery. This means a positive, a negative and 5 in between balances. You need to cut that wire so that you don't have extra current running to the cells which had two balances connected to it in your case.

At least I think that's what's going on. I'm still really new to this but I have been reading a lot on batteries the past few days. 

Also I'm pretty sure you are running 5000mah if you are using 2 zippy 3s 5000mah lipos in series. Mah only increases when you wire your batteries in parallel.

Update: 
Board has been running smoothly in the last couple weeks, blew a cell with some problems while charging but the new battery worked just fine. when i went through the charging accident though, I blew my wire adapter that enabled me to charge two batteries at once. I then decided it was time for a total upgrade on my board's wiring. I cut everything up and managed to solder on some xt60 connected that I picked up at a nearby hobby store.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/9/977612ad1b119ec8ebc09999e4a50c77d948e3d3.jpeg" width="666" height="500">
However the newest problem occurred when I tried to add xt60 connecter to my batteries. The gage of my battery wires is 10, while the xt60 supports nowhere near that, it's too small. As a result, I am looking for a solution that will allow me to solder xt60 connectors to my 10 gage batteries. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/5d1a7ea2c8b5bc7b884ccce3be194d588bd61844.jpeg" width="375" height="500">Should I solder thinner wires to the existing wire?

Another update:
Finished more adapters for the batteries, now the entire system uses xt connectors! (I'm surprised I was able to solder the batteries without them blowing up ðŸ˜‚) Anyways, now I have three adapters since my ESC is Xt90:
Xt90 to Xt60 for running one battery
Xt90 to Xt60s in series for two batteries
Xt60 to 2 Xt60s for running batteries in parallel

Just tested every one of them, they all work flawlessly!

The next upgrade I plan to make is with the controller. The Quanum one that I currently use has been a bit sketchy all along, so I'm going to go with that people seem to think is the most reliable: the Gt2B mod. Hopefully that upgrade will come within the next month or so<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f578e1e73d65eb1f9b9bf7a1b90ad6027eb3eedb.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

[quote="anorak234, post:48, topic:2934"]
so I'm going to go with that people seem to think is the most reliable: the Gt2B mod.
[/quote]

That is a nice decision! Just to inform you: GT2E is the newer version but not many people know it and think GT2B is the standard... GT2B and GT2E are more or less equal. There is also a GT2E Mod

Well, i think BadWolf and Mad munkey only fit gt2B.
They are more or less equal, but not totally.

what are the benefits of using a GT2E instead of GT2B?

Do you happen to have a link for the GT2E mod? If so, I would happily take a look

GT2E has smaller electronics.
Here is the [GT2E Mod](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1013293)

Looks cool... Is there anyone who made a video or maybe a topic showing how? You say the electronics are smaller, I'm not sure how it would go if I just tried to figure it all out from scratch

Just use the tutorial for the GT2B mod and apply it to the GT2E. There wont be much of a difference.

@mccloed @psychotiller could you pls explain why you need to cut the red balance wire on the negative side? ill be running the same set up but is going to be an 12s (4 3s) connecting 2 3s for a 6s on onw side and the same on the other so, this is what i designed so i can charge it from outside the enclosure and this is the firs time i read about the leads, good thing i read it before puting everything together <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/ba1fffe24e70934051549b4dd5fe6f0cf9082498.jpg" width="374" height="500">

also if anyone can tell me where is the right place for an anti spark xt-90s, in the picture it shows the the discharge leads have a mounted connection on the enclosure to goes to the vesc but i forgot about the on/switch from DIY (in the website it says that this switch has an anti spark built in) does this mean i dont really need a Xt90s at all>?.  so basically that port is going to be connected to this switch and then inside the enclosure the switch to the vesc @torqueboards maybe you can help me with this one?

@anorak234 did you cut the rad balance lead on the negative side or not?

You do... I didn't and blew up a battery. I still don't know why it works like that though

My board had it's first official accident. I was on an errand to find a specific sign, and passed a skate park. A couple of people asked if they could try it, I said sure. Within the next 5 minutes a few different people tried it, and they all had a lot of fun, until one guy decided to go full throttle and crashed. The edges were torn up, the motor gear came loose, and I had to slowly push my way home. I used a sander and a few coats of poly to get rid of the scratches, that's almost done drying. Also decided it was time to clean the bearings, so I took each wheel off and did a thorough job. I usually love sharing my creations when people ask, but I think that my board is just too important to me (my precioussssss).

On the bright side though, I got the picture that I wanted of the sign! They can try to stop regular boarders all they want, but nobody will be fining me for riding an e-board less than a mile from my own home!

I'm actually just setting up an GT2E in the MOD you linked. But once I took the eye tropics out of the original enclosure I only managed to connect to the board once. Right now when I try to bind the transmitter to the receiver the green light on the remove is solid, won't blink and the red light on the receiver won't turn solid to signify a connection has been made. Any thoughts?

Connected to the receiver from the top is the link loop, then the power supply with the positive in the center pin, then the y cable for the ECS's.  
The transmitter itself has the potentiometer removed from channel 1 and currently is powered by 2 AAA batteries in series that I ended up taping to the outside of the MOD enclosure since I couldn't get them to fit inside and I've checked all the wires and metallic surfaces for shorts so now I don't know what to do. 

Anyone experience something similar to this with their GT2B?

Maybe you provide some pictures. Hard to understand without. Maybe you can even create a new topic that everyone will respond

SO: Board is dead. For now. About a week ago I finished a ride around the park and charged my batteries as normal, but when I finished one cell on each battery was a full .2 volts off. I then discharged and recharged them separately. One battery has no difference, everything finished charging and the third cell was still .2 off. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/d69c38cd3584aa489b885f2fbcc7f22d609b0be4.JPG" width="375" height="500">

The other was a full .8 off (Was totally shocked, panicked for a bit, forgot to take a picture)!! I proceeded to make a gamble and did a few tests running the board with one battery at a time, and then both batteries. No problems, neither battery is puffy, but I'd still rather not take my chances. 

With that being said, I have decided it's time to upgrade the entire system again. My friend who I am working on a build with right now received his super small controller from @psychotiller and he is absolutely thrilled. We did a few tests using his electronics but with my motor (waiting on the hub motor from torqueboards), and it works like a charm. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/6eecfe072e02898a3f12b2c5f116e0c01f4f2ee1.JPG" width="375" height="500">

I think I'll order that as my new controller since I've been talking about it for a while. I also ordered a voltage meter that can take up to 50V, so I'll solder that into whatever system I end up updating to.

Also, with all of the problems I've run into with LiPo batteries, I have now spent over 100$ on a 6s 5000mah system! On top of that, these things are so finicky and with the recent problem of over .8V off from where all cells should be, its a serious safety hazard. I am officially deciding to upgrade to a Lithium-ion system, and I'm hoping for at least 10S2P (Integrated BMS would be awesome!). I know a lot of you make lithium ion packs and I don't have the space or money to make one by myself. Hoping not to spend over 300$ since its likely I'll be owing someone money for this :laughing:.  Any takers?

UPDATE: I went for a 4 hour search through internetland last night and found someone with the same problems I had. He recommended discharging the batteries down to 3.2V per cell at a rate of .2 amps. I thought it was a bit extreme, but at this point I was willing to try anything. Afterwards, he balance charged them fully at a rate of 1 amp. For this of course I was forced to turn off the automatic timer and safety limits for the charger. However I woke up this morning and looked first thing. After nearly 12 hours, the battery that was nearly .8V off on one cell is back within safe parameters!!

I have yet to charge the other one, but this strategy seems to have worked quite well. While I will still be looking for a lithium ion replacement battery, it seems that for now I can at least ride my board again without the fear of catching on fire :slight_smile:
