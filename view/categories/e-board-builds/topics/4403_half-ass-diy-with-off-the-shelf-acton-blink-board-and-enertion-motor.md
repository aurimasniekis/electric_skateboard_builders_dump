I'm not fully comfortable in building a full board yet, but am interested in it.

My needs are only for a slow 10-15mph, 4 mile ride to a train station, then a 1 mile ride from the destination station to my office when I can recharge again. So I'm not really looking for range or speed

I recently bought a Acton Blink Board which is advertised to have an 800w motor, 6 mile range, 1 hour recharge, 15mph. I like riding it, and it is very light, 13mph on it was too fast and I started to get speed wobbles. So I decided to move the electronics from this board to my Penny Longboard just to see what iot's like (my only other board was a drop deck) and I REALLY like the ride, so much more stable.

My QUESTION is: Would it be possible to keep the Acton Blink Board's Electronic box (battery, ESC? BMS?) and just get another motor? Would/could it be as simple as unplugging the three wires from the stock motor to a new motor (looking at the Enertion R-Spec Pro)? I don't have any specs on what Acton uses for their internals. My problem is that I'm 6'0" and roughly 200 - 210 lbs. A stand still start on this stock motor is not possible and even worst on the heavy plastic deck.

If this is possible with just a simple swap, what are the potential problems?

I don't want to spend the money building from the ground up and just want to ease into it. The Enertion motor will be re-used in a future build though as I'm planning to give away the Acton this Christmas.

A stand still start is never a good idea and I don't understand why you want to change anything when the Acton setup apparently checks everything in your list.

instability is my main concern. It's shorter than a standard skateboard and a bit longer than a pennyboard and pretty high off the ground. I like it, but after putting it onto the longboard I really want the motor in there instead. ultimately it would be great if I can just swap the battery box back and forth and just have trucks with a motor on each board all the time.

If the connections the same...3 phase wires with bullet connectors ... Not sure if the blink board has sensored motor...

Best of you had closer pictures of the board and the electrics ... At this point we are guessing

I'm pretty sure they are bullet connector because someone did a review showing how they were coming undone after a while. These the the best pictures I have of the internals at the moment <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/27d85617ff9749667a17f6d8ffb5668b9ead26ce.jpg" width="281" height="500">

It has to be serviceable ... So, can understand that...plus ACTON makes other electric products as well...So I think they had some hindsight in engineering this board.

When you ride your Blink on uneven pavement, did it rattle? in talking about the sound.
I have tried to find where the sound is comming from but i just think it is the board and wheels.
Tell me if it helps to move everything to another board.

it does make a rattling noise, I think it's the battery bouncing inside the enclosure so moving to another board would not make a difference, you can just open it up and put some foam tape inside, that should fix it.

I only moved the electronics to the penny longboard for an hour to see what it felt like. Definitely going to make a longboard, just waiting for VESCs to come in before really committing in spending all that money

So, if I'm disconnect the black and white connector that provides power to the led's on the side of board, it shouldn't damage anything right?
I'm striping it from everything that rattles and draw power that I don't need.

Noop it works great without the lights!
Im ordering a Longboard Larry Humu 26 inch to move everything to that instead.

Thinking about this board. I am 150lbs (68kg). I need to go 6 miles. People are saying that the battery only goes 6 miles in pristine conditions.  Does anyone know the specs of the battery? From the pictures it looks like it has an xt60 connector.  Would it be possible to replace the battery with a bigger one, or even 2 in series?

Hi @Mikenopolis how did it feel attached to a penny? Do you think it would be worth a shot in a project?

The penny LONGBOARD is a nice ride. But there is flex which is why I went with my current carbon fiber board since I used Enertion's SP4 battery enclosure.

Are you thinking about putting the Blink's drive onto a Penny Long? would be pretty simple

Little to no flex as it would be 22" penny. Quite the challenge

not sure it would fit the 22...length or width, would be a challenge

the battery/electronics box actually has a lid. So I would drill FOUR holes on the deck depending on where the flex is all six might damage it when it flexes, push the screw down add a nut (used to keep the lid closed), then the battery, then another nut. The problem with the Penny is that bottom not being flat

I used to have the Acton, that thing would be really nice with better quality control at the factory.

I have the penny longboard too ($70 at Costco), but it's HEAVY!! That poor little Acton setup has to push that penny beast!

that plastic deck is really heavy...I don't feel bad because of that, that Acton setup has to push my heavy a$$. my custom board definitely performs way better with with my size

Does it make you any faster moving to a longboard? I am going to see if I should add another battery and move it to a longboard.

no, moving the exact components to a different deck makes no difference in speed. All it does is make it easier to ride at higher speeds

Got any ideas on making my board a little faster? The blink is a little too slow!

I assume you have the belt motor version? If that's the case you can look for other pulleys to increase speed by gear. 

The simplest way to make it have a higher top speed would be larger wheels (not possible if you are using the hub version)

The harder things would be changing to higher voltage batteries and/or changing the motor to something with a higher kv.  But then you will loose torque (not that you have much in the blink)

Look at when I posted this original post, since this first original question until now, I've learned a lot from the people here, built a board and just repaired another. Maybe it's time you do the same. 

The little blink has its place, speed and distance is not one of them

So I was thinking about adding this https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013WKTI16/ref=twister_B016JWKPY8?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1 external battery to my board but the main problem is that it doesn't have an ac port to charge the board with for UNDER 25 DOLLARS. Anyone got any ideas?

I have the exact same question... but for me it is because my acton blink motor bracket broke.. and i am exploring just buying a hub motor and hooking up the 3 cables...

 or just purchasing a hobby all in one motor setup which comes with everything mounted onto trucks... 

so the million dollar question... what specs do i need for the new motor!?!?

Hello, I have this model as well, been happy with it, I moved the parts to a long board so that has been working fine with me, the motor bracket is starting to brake up (scratch on bumps) and motor seems to start having problems, so I am planning to get a good motor bracket and probably replace the motor as well, again I am happy the way it works so just need a little upgrade, so wondering if somebody can help me with a motor replacement recommendation for this guy. Thanks.

For acton? I am not sure how much watts does the original have...also i am not sure about the kv...

Thank you, I had similar specs on mind, that helps. Also considering the hub motor 75kv from DIY eletric skateboards, it seems that one might work as well.

Yeah it should work...acton uses 10S1P batteries from what I remember so you would get about 40kmph which is (considering the small battery and small deck) overkill...your battery would probably sag too much and you would get no range at all...

It would be better for you to get a different hub...something with smaller kv...I would go for 60kv or even less, 50kv should be ideal..
If you cant find any good hub, you can buy the same ub motor acton uses in their newer boards...

I have searched through ebay and didnt find any that would suit you...

Acton used to offer change of the belt drive to hub motor for 50$ or something like that...try asking their support, they might still be willing to do that for you...it would be the easiest solution, otherway belt drive would be better for you...

Thanks for the response, yes the battery is 10s1p, yeah kinda been thinking maybe just to stick to belt. I didn't know about the Acton replacement hub offer, I actually was considering asking to Acton if I could buy the motor from them, I guess it won't hurt to ask. But again as you suggest maybe just sticking to belt would be better.
