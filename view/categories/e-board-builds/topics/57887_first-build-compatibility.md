This is my first time building an electric skateboard and I wanted to confirm all these components will integrate into my board. I am currently in high school so money is tight but flexible and I am more than willing to wait to ensure quality. I already have a board I am just going to replace the trucks. I also wanted to make a lithium-ion battery pack since it seems the best option for the job. I planned on 6s2p but I am not sure, I also live in northwest Indiana, everything is long and flat roads so climbing hills are not an issue. I am also 6'2" and weigh 160 lbs in case that gives an idea of what I am looking for.

That motor should work with that mount, but you'll need the 50mm version. But that mount won't work with those trucks. Some people have luck with that esc/remote, but it's commonly found on cheaper pre-made Chinese boards. A vesc is much better. 

I would strongly recommend the Hobby King esk8 kit. For roughly $250, you get quality components that are all compatible, bigger wheels, and a vesc. All you'll need in addition to is a battery and a deck, maybe a remote.

I would recommend getting a 63mm motor since you are running single drive.

Probably want to with a lower kv motor. Just under 200kv works best for most single drive kits. Way better startup torque and still has descent top speed.

You should go 10s :) you should change your motor to a 63mm motor with lower kv...Also the trucks you mentioned suck...I have bend them after 5 rides and I am just 70 kg heavy..get calibers :) 

I think you should read a little bit more about everything and then totally remake your parts list ;)

I guess you can get TB 218mm trucks if you are intending to upgrade to a dual motor. They do sell motor mounts as well. https://

@Jedi Awesome thank you, I think I was focusing on cheap components too much. Does the deck really matter with these kind of things? I have never touched an electric skateboard lol.

So should I be building 10s2p? And how would I go about charging it? Are there any recommended chargers so my house doesnâ€™t go down in chemical flames

The deck does matter. Not only is it important to have enough wheelbase to fit your electronics, but also for a stable ride. Too much flex will inhibit the mounting of electronics. Everyone has their own deck preference. Find one that will fit your needs and is comfortable. 

Cheap components can come back to bite you, don't want to end up buying twice. Did you find the hobby king kit? Again, highly recommended.

10s over 6s for sure. A laptop style charger isn't hard to find.

Yes thank you, I intend on buying the kit (but I am struggling to find it in stock), remote and building a battery for it with 10s2p and a charger. I will post the build when I am finished
