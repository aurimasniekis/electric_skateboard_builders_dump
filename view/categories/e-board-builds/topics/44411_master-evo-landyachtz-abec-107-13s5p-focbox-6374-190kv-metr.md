I love the evo deck wish I would have gone 13s, seems to run okay ,what's your thoughts on the evo deck clearance, am currently building a 4wd carvon XL build I got the evo deck and wheels just waiting On the battery to be shipped 12s6p 30q BMS bypassed and the focbox to be shipped from cyber Monday, has 13s given you any troubles?
Seems like your also buildimg a gnarly build tho props :+1:

I think, clearance is something to think about and be conscious of, but I  don't see it being an issue for me..I normally am always on public streets not sidewalks so I don't go over many transitions and I always skate around speed bumps and the like. 

Otherwise 13s on the bench, and spinning  full size car tire (45lbs of rotational mass setup like a bike friction drive but wheel to wheel) and on my buddies Evo(pshaw) have been running pretty flawlessly. 

If your curious how I bench tested 13s with load lol...I put my car on jack stands put it in neutral. Screwed a truck to a plank of wood upside down with the motors on then lowered my car until one of the wheels barely touched both of my truck wheels.... The drive train friction(car) and rotational mass of both tires(car) through the differential is about as much as I weigh lol.

I scratched my brand new enclosure going off the corner of a little sidewalk literally the first ride. And I have mad risers and 107s on mine. 

Double stacked cells are going to be problematic, even more so if you live in an area with shitty streets.

@stormboard1 Think 13s is the max...

Unless you do 14s with brakes disabled, on say an ebike or a emtb(trampa) with magura brakes. As you'll over volt. People have done several 14s bikes on vesc I with regenerative braking disabled.

So

Got the metroboard cnc'd pulleys in... They're really nice quality... And one of the few available that are PRESS in for Flywheel style hubs

![IMG_20180130_135122|374x499](upload://rlsFZgeg8X5QfeFV8p7c2QpdPzO.jpg)![IMG_20180130_135130|375x500](upload://yQvobwonfM0iIkcRVQcurOPsDNV.jpg)

As you can see it came with 8 ID x 10 OD x 28 L mm spacers. This isn't going to work with SurfRodz. So I've ordered some 10 x 12 x 14mm "bearing support spacers" off the interwebs that I will double up on to make a 28mm spacer.

For now pressed.

So got a couple spacers in. The 10id 12od we're to thin so I'm sticking with some nice brass  10*14*14 spacers. 

Stock metroboard spacers next to the new ones.

So I really hate regular wires. So figure since I have some silicon balance leads around. I'll be depinning and swapping for silicon on the BMS connector
![IMG_20180225_204227|666x500](upload://mzg6m3A7OXnE7gRvQBFLFfJ0qwP.jpg)

Also this will be the 3rd time I've done this. But with fiberglass enclosures, especially the ones @Eboosted makes. I really enjoy building the battery into the enclosure. So that it is one solid piece. I've stated with a base layer of foam, and some fishpaper dividers. The cells will be welded and then glued in

The front nose will hold the Charging section.

Also I'll be using an antispark bullet instead of a antispark xt90.

I would man...I did alot of builds that were attached to the board.... Or build the battery then attach to the enclosure... But the last couple where I've build it into the enclosure from the start just feel right as I can remove the enclosure and not worry about anything falling out..it's all solid.

.. I mean Alan designed this for 12s4p or 13s4p. And I have 13s5p in it. I'd definitely play with layouts @scepterr

yea @scepterr it's a 3d printed part for this antispark bullet. Thinking about milling it out in hdpe. My buddy and I got chatting about it after I showed him the link below, I originally wanted to use a "Loop" antispark, instead of a key, the wire would come out of the enclosure and have 1" dangling, then I just plug the other end in so I don't have to worry about loosing a loop key as it's always attached... well he figured the bullets have screws, screw them into a switch and make a panel mount... we're changing the design a bit so that the hole doesn't need to be so big, just big enought for the switch to protrude.

effectivly it is the same as antispark loopkey.. so it shouldn't fail.

So the nose and tail are open ever so slightly on the enclosure. For easy routing over the motors.

It's a tight squeeze but
Focbox, receiver. Bluetooth. And antispark should all fit(just missing the tiny bullet thing from a previous post.

Still need to put a bullet on the cut lead on negative to go-to b- on the BMS... 

Canbus wires have a dab of glue and tape on them.

@fliess thanks man Lol you wouldn't believe how I came up with it...

I was rotating my tires and changing the oil. I had the car on jack stands. Laying under it after I had already drained and rotated the tires. Was about to put the drain plug in and new oil filter on. I had just come back for a ride on the skateboard and it was in the other garage bay upside down. When I looked over while tightening the drain plug.. it looked as if the Skateboard was upside down with the tire on it... The idea bulb went off. I reached over and spin the tires with my hands to check the resistance to validate this optical conundrum. Needless to say I finished changing the oil and left it on jack stands lol.

So I took a slight detour in building the pack.

After testing the iron and welder. It performs really well so. time to retire the old iron and sunko 709a.

Figured I'd do it right and attach a permanent 32Ah pack as I solder and weld alot.

So many little things... To build a board 😂🤣

-split the nose (6th Series pack) from 4/1 to 3/2 for easier fitment.
-finished all series connections.
-silicone battery to enclosure and cured
-swapped the BMS balance wires for silicon
-wired all the balance leads except B+


Need to:
-finish the charging lines, and drill the charge hole
-finish wiring B+ and the AS150 bullet, and drill the hole
-charge the battery, and dial the pots on the charger for perfect end charge.
-3m the focboxes down after setting up wireless and CanBus

![IMG_20180304_134700|374x499](upload://5aIwOSZwnOAsyP2p3z72feNLYb2.jpg)

We'll see where it goes from there.. but I'm guessing bolt it up and then configure the motors wirelessly ;)

@PartyPoison. One side is wrapped in fish paper, the other side is layed out. It's nickel welded for parallel and two 14guage for each series connection.

The terminals were  wrapped with kapton, and the ends of  the packs that are side by side wrapped in fish paper to create abrasion protection separation. It's the side in this picture that has fish paper on the cell ends.

![IMG_20180225_204359|666x500](upload://6fyKVQSCaabG34DVnHltvTN0oWm.jpg)

Then kapton and welds. This is a negative side you can see the kapton is on top as I welded first
![IMG_20180302_105422|375x500](upload://sy8mCN5U44i9q6dNmMqzZGabTbG.jpg)

This is a positive. With kapton before welding. Then some manual abrasion to make solder flow easily to not heat up the packs
![IMG_20180302_190516|374x499](upload://zCYJ4QYRB92eFEj9ILuftkdMMwQ.jpg)

@Deckoz thanks for the detailed assembly for the battery pack, didn't think that you can put kapton before spot weld, can be a good insulator for the positive side, nicely done, Did you avoid using insulator (circle thing with adhesive) on the positive side? remember that  @Kaly said that insulator are no good in case of short , glue might caught in fire( trampa caught in fire).

Insulators honestly make it harder to weld. As it raises the lip, making the chances more likely there's an air gap and you burn a hole in the nickel.kapton is easy, adds all the protection I need for the welds and is nice and thin. 

Insulators...meh...they just take up space...

So haven't had much time to work on it. Unfortunately the model my friend made was more of an afterthought for me and didn't end up fitting like I wanted. Which is ok. So resorted to the pass through unloosable loopkey.

Also made a riser

Dude I rode this board 5050 analog dh for a few months waiting on the enclosure. 

But powered it just isn't right.. I can't shimmy my front foot around to leverage points like I can on every other board... Likely because 50 plates resulting in 65 degree nose on a powered rear feels fine...until you move your foot lol them any bit of torque shift from the rear just makes it flop. 

I've already taken 6 off the front but I really need/want the front closer to 50 so I can move my foot. Lol I also like my trucks insanely lose... So it's all ankle here lol...can't handle the 65 😂😂😂


My point is it is completely different powered above 25mph...

I noticed the complimenting colors too. I thought it was on purpose. Like the red/pink on the board matches the armor for the body that controls it and the blue on the drive system matching the helmet for the brain that controls it. Definitely a cool picture. My stuff is never neatly arranged all in one place, ready to ride. This is how it should look.

I know your body armor highlights are red, but it is sort of like a half match. I dunno, it just looks dope.  And, I like pink.

@Eboosted it's dead silent. I added a layer of art foam between the battery and board. The only thing you can hear is the bearings and Motors. But yes, the back arch of the Evo makes a extremely sturdy place to push against while accelerating. But I basically have to be in full tuck to not do wheelies if I'm under 10mph while gunning it.

I'll try to make a video. I'm out riding right now..

Torque drops off around 17mph. So not long. It's a total torque wheelie. I'm hoping I can setup the potato with enough motor amps to do this but at slower speeds and just manual/use cruise control with the kicktail. Since there's no kick to hold it up on the Evo.

Anyway I wanted to note a few things I've been trying on the bench here as I'm thinking of applying it to this build:

This build is using FOCboxes: 
Which has some noise at higher dutycycles due to only 2 current shunts. High duty cycle on this build means high speeds, and I've been curious if it is possible to get cleaner readouts in real time.

The experiment: 
- add a ground cable from the motor housing to the system ground
- add a single choke(ferrite toroid) to the phase wires to get a cleaner phase separation BEMF

On the bench with no-load the results look promising.

But I currently have no way of verifying this with any logging via Bluetooth as the sample rates are to low.

I think I may be starting an Arduino based on-board logger, with 256.4k baud over uart, to capture full logging for download from an SD card or the likes... Which also may entail a fork or addition to vesc tool to be able to read log files, vs a stream. 

I'll add more once I get some data polling setup in AVR.

@Eboosted

 (13s*4.2v@full) = 54.6v * 100 bat amps = 5400 deliverable watts.. it's alot of power. 

12s5p is only 5000w, and 12s4p is only 4000w

12s*5p@4.2=50.4*100a = 5040w
12s*4p@4.2=50.4*80a=4032w
So almost 1500 deliverable watts more then a standard 12s4p setup..

Also someone correct me if I'm wrong as I didn't have metr running. 

But at 1:30 the "ABEC" on the front and rear tire stand still for a moment.

If I'm doing my math right..I recorded at 60 frames per second, so for abec to stand still it must be at or close to 60 revolutions per second.

107π=336mm circumference.

336mm * 60 revolutions is 20160mm distance traveled per second. Or ~45mph up a 16% grade hill.

Stunning video! Beautiful example of how to ride at speed too. It should be mandatory to wear this level of protection at these speeds.  I cringe when I see a lot of people riding eboards at speed in the street - but you ride so well and are so well protected that if you did come off you’d just slide out. Makes it even more pleasant to watch dude!  That board is a beast too!

I'm sorry but 45mph is very hard to believe, even with 13s. That's faster than I can cook my cup noodles, and I'm 100% Asian. 

With that being said, here's me being even more Asian:
I screen recorded some clips and here's what I found:
![33 PM|690x416](upload://v6T4z6h6oWsFKs4g4cdLoD0u9PV.jpg)
That length is approximately 1&1/5 the length of the evo (39" = basically a meter long)

I trimmed the clip to only that frame until you pass that black line I drew. 
The duration of that clip was 0.098s 

Therefore, I conclude that at 1:30 you were traveling around 1.2/0.098s or 12.24m/s or 27.38mph. That seems a lot more accurate especially on a 16% hill grade. Mind you, that is still unbelievably fast up a hill that steep but then again you're on dual 6374 13s5p.

One more thing, great decisions with your protective gear. I would bubble wrap myself if I were to ride a dual 6374 13s board. Good form and technique too. KUDOS

That board is fast,  Metr data is really accurate. You have some data?.  I'm interested to see how much voltage sag you get on 13s.  Also I can't imagine calculating speed off a YouTube clip very accurate...

[quote="Deckoz, post:132, topic:44411"]
(13s*4.2v@full) = 54.6v * 100 bat amps = 5400 deliverable watts… it’s alot of power.

12s5p is only 5000w, and 12s4p is only 4000w
[/quote]

I wish this was real world.  Stupid batteries sag quite a bit pulling big amps.  So at 100A draw voltage will be less than 4.2.  

But compared to us 12s people you basically gain that voltage drop back with the extra S.  Board looks awesome BTW.

As @mmaner said it's the AS150 in that link

The side inside the enclosure(male with anti spark resistor) was soldered to the wire then screwed into the plastic housings as normal, then a hole drilled in the enclosure, the wire soldered to the battery and the housing glued to the enclosure.

The female side,  was screwed into the plastic housing, a hold drilled in the side for the soldering opening. And the wire insert was through the solder opening, and performed the solder from the back end of the connector with it screwed in to make the 90°. The back of the connector was then filled with liquid electrical tape. Another hole in the enclosure passes the wire back in and around to the positive side of the focboxes. I know it might seem wrong that the black wire goes to positive..and I didn't use the red housing..but yea.. aesthetics. Lol.

reporting in, this deck is fucking awesome for higher speeds. you'll need wedged risers though!

especially with the enclosure from ben!

I run 6 degree wedges on 44 baseplates instead of risers to end with a 53/35 split instead of 65/35 on 50 baseplates...


65 is way to steep on tb218s when electrified. I rolled with 65/35 for months on 180 trucks analog on otangs and it's amazing for DH. But 218s make it way too touchy @65 with the torque in the rear. Just my opinion.

Motors are rated in watts not voltage. The voltages are just suggested guidelines. 

For example most 6374 are rated for 3000w.

At full battery and 100% duty cycle (both of which are never true in the real world)

54.6v * 50 battery amps = 2730wattts

Most escs cannot handle more then 50 battery amps, and most batteries can't even supply 50 amps in a dual config unless your 30q 5p or higher/equivalent

I am indeed running canbus. I'm not sure why your slave would drop out and not the master... What you describe sounds similar to not calibrating a nano remote on boot up and going full throttle..but that affects both escs..

@eboosted recently had a problem kind of like that too, it was the primary capacitors for the ESC had broken off.. just an idea?

@pedrodemio have connected the ESCs via can bus?

Have you installed an hm-10 device? 

If so, I had the same exact issue:

The motor configuration I write via Bluetooth only updates one ESC, in order to test it just adjust top speed via Bluetooth to 5km/hr and see if one wheel spins faster than the other at full throttle, you could also check the configuration by plugging the USB to the board and reading them. 

This started to happen on the latest ackmaniac firmware 3.100

Is this is not your issue, sorry for my long, random/unhelpful post

@Deckoz

Do you run any erpm limit? Maybe that’s causing the “issue”, I put like that because riding it works normally, exactly same consumption on booth escs

Since  I’m controlling the escs via uart it can’t be calibration

And by the way, after seeing your video I bought a selfie stick, tried for the first time today, you can get amazing shots, way better than holding the camera or having someone filming stationary, I never managed to get the felling of ridding in any other footage before

@Eboosted

Yes, using it, but even checking and configuring everything via usb results the same, again, it’s not a problem, just a curious behavior 

Maybe I should limit the erpm only on the master VESC, will try that

Seeing this beast I’m tempted to give my old DHL evo another try. I loved it back in 2012 (damn I’m getting old), but left it abandoned because of it indirect steering and went top mount since.
Do the risers make a huge difference and make the evo more agile again? Have you ridden your evo without risers once.
Kinda liked the Evo because ist felt like a school bus. Sliding was always rough due to the length tho.

Man... You had the super old Evo that was 41" before 2014...the newest evos are 39" and now there is a 36".

I used my evo for DH before I built it. I didn't have any issues sliding it on 74mm wheels.

I ran it with risers then as well as with it low I felt the slides were unpredictable and to easy to slide out.

I picked up the metroboard pulleys, now I just need to get the matching 20mm motor pulleys to go with the 20mm belts I found.

So today the Evo only charged to 53.7. took the Evo apart. Measured everything. 

All looks fine. I seem to run into this issue with boards every 1000miles or so. But, I'm starting to think that soldered terminals for BMS would be better.

Basically everything measured properly. But the Pins on the JST Balance plug, the metal widens with vibrations, leading to a weak connection. And the bms cuts off the charge.

I depinned the JST one by one and re-pinched the connector, then repinned it and repeated for all. Plugged back in and all is charging fine.

I am considering hardwiring(soldering) the balance to the bms to not run into this issue again. Its been hard to pin point because it takes some miles to happen, and lots of boards in and out of hand with friends.

Does anyone else have a better idea as a replacement for the JST other then direct solder?

You could use a dsub (vga) port.  Not better, but allows you to disconnect.

Maybe fixing the balance lead about an inch from the plug with hotglue to prevent any vibration getting to the pins. 

I always hotglue just where the wires enter the plug as I found one wire could work its way out and then my balance gets fucked up. 

Additionally hotglue over the male and female plugs to further prevent movement. But makes it annoying to un-plug.

Like the wago 233 or 261 or something similar that has tention with a spring so it won't vibrate loose on your rides :slight_smile:

I this is a good idea. But I'm gonna give it a few more charges to make sure it's the pins that vibrate loose.
Then I may decide to try this... Before I resort to soldering. Put miles on it and see fit goes... Thanks

Hey man. I used hot melt hot glue, to do the cells. And fill behind the tape wraps for rigidity. Then used silicon spread to "glue" the battery to enclosure.

Not quite enough space for this. 

If I am to do anything, I would either glue, or solder directly to the BMS

Space is quite small

60 with raked trucks feels great. Prefer 50-55 upfront with rakeless.

I use 50° baseplate up front with a 6° dewedge. And rear a 50° baseplate on half inch riser. For raked+3 59°/35° rakeless

When I had the 218 up front and not the surfrodz rkp. I ran 44° caliber baseplate on 218s with a 6° dewedge, and same rear as above for rakeless all around 53°/35°

If you have 218's pick up some 44 caliber basplate, the kingpin is pressed in instead of loose, so you'll get rid of some slop, and I'm using a Bolzen 6° wedge riser. 

Rayne sells bamboo angled risers if you cannot find Bolzen wedges. If you don't want to get 44 plates, Bolzen makes a 12 wedge too.

So the time has come for some changes. One of my biggest pet peeves is getting debris stuck in a belt tooth. While this has never really been an issue on my slower carve decks. It can really throw off my concentration on the road when going 30mph and tiny pebble or debris gets stuck in a tooth, causing the most distracting oscillation of the drive system from not spinning completely free. 

I've used the motor pulley covers that @Apolo designed for me, and they have been great, but the soft aluminum of the metroboard pulleys just grabs debris no matter what. 90% of the time I would say metroboard pulleys are one of the best options because they are press in, and the width allows you to run 20mm belts super loose without an idler and no skipping of the belt. 

Anyway because of this I asked @Kug3lis to design a gearbox for 218s & 107s

One of the first kits will be arriving soon, which I will be swapping over too.

This also is going to be a good opportunity for me to disassemble my motors for cleaning, and bearing refresh. Which I will make sure to take pictures of and show how to properly regrease sealed motor bearings(not oil).

Stay tuned, for an epic upgrade. 😍😍

Looks wise, I don't think it will change much. Sound wise, will be all about setting the proper gear mesh, with lubrication.

I think the real tests will be, can it freewheel out-roll my loose ass 20mm belt setup. Which if the backlash on the Spurs is setup correctly, it should easily out-roll the belt setup.

Direct drive and hub always have the least friction, so it's smoother on rolling distance. Direct drive needs to have helical gear setup to minimize backlash and noise.

Yet I still like my belt setup for eATB although replacing belt when snapped suck balls :smiley:

I tend to agree. But I've not seen anyone else running 20mm belts like this Evo & pshaw Evo. Our belts are so loose it's almost all motor resistance. Pushing my Evo with belts off I can one push 29ft, with belts on is around 26-27ft. When I used 9, 12, or 15mm belts on other builds where the belt had to be tight to not skip, it was less then half of the distance of when belts weren't installed.

So I'm really hoping the DD are basically the equivalent or better then wide as hell loose goosey belts :)

Dude you are a skydiver as well. Damnnn I just passed 500 last week with the Dutch hd record.. We should meet on a boogie or something some time.

Back on topic; got some spare canopies here, can try them while riding haha. Prolly works better with a speedwing though

So worked a little bit on the drive last night.

Was a little confused at first. As the provided speedrings didn't make sense. And I thought I was lacking a spacer.. anyway. 

Side note: anything mentioned here has already been relayed to @Kug3lis to verify everyone's kits once they start shipping, and also to provide easier install

So here is the kit laid out. My fingers are pointing to screws, I was missing two. (10/12) and let him know so the counts are right
 ![18e0e0bf4088d36c4e1c140570fd7c306900d374_1_375x500|375x500](upload://7k7sdnIzctLne5GEUhxNUggm00t.jpg) 

The speed rings below. 8 copper, 2 steel. Four copper are used to make a spacer, and one steel is used as the outer speed ring on the nut
![319088237ce7c635eb79fadcf1a55f6ecdf9fd28_1_374x499|374x499](upload://mHIu9SWMKH9OPs0EnrT9oGoOcrZ.jpg)

Due to the pulley being pressed into the wheel with an arbor or mallet. The v-ring is slipped on, then the drivebox housing, and then the wheel gear mounted to the press insert. The assembly below slides into the axle and then the case bolts and axle nut hold it all on..
![d2e707a852cc674bce5fb9773ed1a13d4c0b2da3_1_375x500|375x500](upload://2omdzdat5cCFoxqZ2yOCIRyCQK3.jpg)

The problem I had initially, was trying to figure out how to align the copper speed rings, without loosing any, and sliding the whole assembly on. The copper rings go between the pulley bearing and inner wheel bearing. I forgot to take a picture. But basically where this red surfrodz spacer is..is what the copper ones are for. And then a bearing slide into the pulley seat.

![7ba6a0ac7c135773ab553bccd094873b7ed40927_1_375x500 (1)|375x500](upload://jLfn2A6QGVFbAOTwtVyw0MajRaj.jpg)

So aligning them was quite frustrating. So I ended up making a spacer out of them
![b662728adc697c493777894596b2a6995552fd50_1_374x499|374x499](upload://kvz1nvoyFIQoJO8WjIyqj1P9L8l.jpg)
![fd3681af92912295b38a388934d96f00dea4266b_1_375x500|375x500](upload://xIFpLqqM1K9IgsjdABl3pUaos4Y.jpg)
![6a030cc09a9a1900e72766f428dd9801db4a7c7d_1_374x499|374x499](upload://eu8eP4lnRXRU9hZh7qwxSNciWN4.jpg)

This way aligning the assembly is easy, and you don't have to disassemble because you lost a speeding in the pulley when trying to slide it on.

So before you bolt the wheel pulley to the press insert. Make sure you install your sliprings/v-ring
![received_10160342374605521|301x500](upload://nITJhbxxSORFYuErXrkoQFI61wl.jpeg)

Then slide it all together and bolt up the housing.
![received_10160340330865521|301x500](upload://yFucLOMax4W1rIwlfmEXpL7mGVW.jpeg)

Above you see the completed housing. The parts I skipped here: before you install the wheel and housing. The motor must be installed. You will need to mount the gear to the press insert WITHOUT the housing, and tighten the axle nut.

Install the motor, and slide on the spur gear, with the motor bolts friction tight and the Spurs pressed as far as they can together, with the wheel torqued on. Take 3 post it notes or 3 sheets of paper and spin it through the gear between the motor and wheel gear. 

What this will do with your motor bolts friction fit, is it will slide the motor outward just far enough so that you achieve the proper backlash. Once you do this torque the motor bolts down. And then remove the wheel, unbolt the pulley, and install the housing, resintall the pulley, and bolt it together.

Side notes, this housing is sealed. One of the things I will be doing is removing all of the Buna seals from the pulley bearing, inner wheel bearing, and inside seal of the outer wheel bearing. As there is no lubrication port, the easiest way to add lube that the gearbox and bearing can share, is to just pop off the out wheel buna seal and spray right into the bearings passing through to the gearbox.

I'll post more pictures when I get back to this after some rides this weekend. I need to cut my motor shafts down to finish the install..but it's holiday weekend so must rideeeee

K so more on the drive.

The TB motor has a long shaft, which I knew I needed to cut. I'll be cutting them tomorrow morning as it's a little late to run the cutoff wheel(loud). But I didn't expect the shaft to interfere.

The motor Spurs have to have the collar facing the motor.  But on TB6374 there is this 10mm section of 10mm wide shaft. 
![IMG_20180525_214557|374x499](upload://84yTMY7hCjGphoILouoHKEz33OF.jpg)
![IMG_20180525_214643|666x500](upload://ucnTgh9Sqitc0YwNRu5hgtr0146.jpg)

So I had to drill out the collar section of the pulley
![IMG_20180526_223423|374x499](upload://AloEbXkdXAV29BjyE6lT1wGeXB4.jpg)

Now that it's drilled out. Testing the alignment. I've set the backlash. But need to take the motor off to cut the shafts so I'll reset it again. But here is what it should look like

![IMG_20180526_225127|374x499](upload://2rWPTR3hHLBPaAaABtPquLwvEvG.jpg)![IMG_20180526_225146|374x499](upload://5Kqv0Qv5dLsj7iwrch1Atyc7J32.jpg)

It's hard to tell because of phone camera and shadows. But
Basically the bottoms of top angle of the teeth, ie the point of pressure angle. Is where you are setting your teeth. 

![Boston-Gear|425x309](upload://dk2SbtmSrUoCUTyUcohPcB9uKfW.jpg)

If you set your backlash properly the gearbox should basically be noiseless while spinning. Alot of backlash and your going to have alot of noise and wear your gears.

Hopefully I'll finish this tomorrow so I can ride it. For reference. I ended up moving up 1 notch on the  plate. I have -15 in the back from the Evo, and each hole I believe is 15.. so someone running a 50 plate on a non wedged deck would need to move up two holes for clearance.

Ok now the sadness.

I've spent all this time tinkering with things... Finally got around to mounting up with motors on.

So two 6384 fit between the plates... However the kingpin is in the way. Figured this would be a non issue with 6374(true 74) but the motor ends still hit the kingpin during a lean, in both drilled plate positions.

The position that comes drilled is far to low for the motors. Even with the natural -15 on the Evo. The next position up is the height I had my motors when on belts. 

I have 2.4:1(15T) and 2.77:1(13T) motor Spurs... The 2.77 with proper backlash can't even spin because the motor is on the kingpin frame. The 2.4:1, giving me the most space, hits the frame on even the slightest leans.

Basically these drives are unusable unless your total motor length is less then 69mm(not including shaft, which can only be a.max of 20mm long external). Otherwise you will rub or hit the kingpin frame with all 4 reductions (2.4, 2.6, 2.8 & 3.0 to 1)

![received_10160347880540521|301x500](upload://5z1xcWFygkEw3S7qjV1UIWn5UjJ.jpeg)

Blah. Back to belts. Maybe I'll think of something to do with this... Downsizing motors is a non-option for the Evo. 

I'll wait for the other testers to see if they come up with any solutions. But for now it's headed to the shelf of parts I need to find a use for.... And think of if I really need another 107mm board... I'm conflicted because it's a 218 truck but really can only run dual 6355... 

So frustrating I want to punch pillows. Lol

That's cool. I was about to go up to 6384's before the drive came about... Drive came about and figured I'd just stick with the current 6374..

Downsizing not an option, no way I would go for less power, when I wanted more power :(

Ahh shit man, as we tried on our "Chinese" deck with I guess it was tight trucks so wasn't leaning that much. Have you tried to mount a motor to outside? We will try to modify design but the problem arises then moving drive train more outside is that there is a possibility that wheel will bite POM gear case as the distance gets smaller.

@Colson003 pneumatic one uses bigger gears and etc so it is more away from hanger and etc. This one was made with smaller gears to increase clearance from the ground.

I got a tip to try to push the drivetrain as much as axle nuts tighten enough by using those copper washers before hanger hub.  Add 3 on the axle before hanger mount and 3 on between wheel bearing and wheel hub mount bearing.

Flipping it doesn't help. Actually makes it worse. Because RKP Hangars aren't symmetrical in the way they are on the baseplates. The back of the motor at the same height off the ground would be where the Pivot cup is.

I might try adding a couple speedrings behind the clamp and have to flip my nuts nylon in to see if it will clear with a couple extra mm.  I dunno. I'll probably give it a rest for the day. And come back to it.

How tight do you run the bushings? You could cut the king pin and use an low profile nut (or cut one in half, done that lot of times) and use thread locker to secure it instead of the nylon nuts

@Kug3lis one way to solve this is to add another gear, it comes with a lot of compromises, but it will make it fit in cases like this, they don’t even need to be colinear, so you could make the drive just big enough to clear the kingpin

![1527427026188805475533|666x500](upload://fZTuyDXQ9OtbNJKLw60BRYWzQXe.jpg)

Where my finger(behind) between the kingping frame and the motor is where it strikes. Not the actual kingpin. 

This gear(2.4:1) is the largest of the four available, giving the most space here. All other reductions have even less space. 

I could probably grind down the baseplate there. But I've had baseplates crack on me before, so I'm not willing to do anything structural wise to the baseplate.

As far as how tight my rear is. You can see I run double barrels with tight precision cups, making it really restrictive. So actual movement is around 2/3 to 3/4 of total possible non compressed hangar lean.

So I got some coffee. And of course just couldn't let it sit...

While I don't think the 2.6, 2.8, or 3.0 drives will be runnable with 6374(as they are even closer)

I've added three speed rings, didn't change any spacers, and flipped my nuts

Here is the old mounting that has 1400 miles with my nuts flipped so the nut flipping won't be an issue.

![IMG_20180527_095532|374x499](upload://7UFew1HL27ov0zAmxWfZC0yk3Hi.jpg)

- upside down sounds like a box of rocks
- riding with load is basically the same  noise as cruising on belts
- heavy acceleration and braking sound louder. But the torqueblows away 20mm belts. And I thought 20mm belts were top shit coming from 12 & 15mm
- it free rolls alot easier. Which is surprising because again I thought loose 20mm belts were coasty.
- mother f***** install dear god. Y'all have no ideas how many times I took it apart and back together over the past 3 days for alignments, tweaking. Understanding the right way to Seattle vring. You name it. It was not an quick task...it was monotonous "f*** I gotta take it apart again"

Now that it's on there. 1/4 mile ride on it. Brought it back,took it apart again and fixed the backlash on one side. Rode it for a mile after that. Can't complain other then the install and being close to having a paperweight. We'll see how maintenance is as I start putting miles on it.. :slight_smile:

Tl:dr holy fuckin torque man.

No @PatRocks . 2.4:1 (15T/36T metroboard) to 2.4:1(15T/36T spur) Identical reduction. 

Torque is instantaneous. Where with belts is got a slight "delay" as the belt tightens on different sides when your braking vs accelerating. Not sure how to explain it

Nice to hear you got it working

About the torque, do you think it’s just eliminating the losses of the belts? Because other than that, if your belts wasn’t skipping teeth it makes no sense to have more torque

Or is just the feel of the system that is more responsive?

Morning, my inbox blew up after @Deckoz posted stuff :smiley: I always tell people be aware of torque when starting and when braking. Everyone told me same thing as @deckoz instant torque transfer. Like electric motors themselves you push throttle and you feel power instantly coming to the wheels. With belts I think there are a lot of variables which affects delay of power transfer :)

So I've taken it over some of the bigger transition bridges close to my house with absolutely no issues.

The Lowest point of the drive box before the wheel is 38mm. 2mm less then how my belts were setup. So no real loss there.

Something interesting I have noticed between different builds is the closer to the kingpin your mounts are the more likely they are to get hit. At least from what I've seen. Where wheel pulleys are less likely to get hit because they're tucked up by the wheel. Idk I could be wrong. The point I was getting to is. The drive system basically resides where my pulleys we're, so I think the chances of striking are actually pretty low..

## \#392 Posted by: Deckoz Posted at: 2018-05-28T20:18:28.795Z Reads: 307

```
@LukePL  As far is instantaneous torque. Nope. There's always gonna be the delay from the belt tensioning when going from coasting to under acceleration or braking, as the side of tension depends on the action performed. 

The backlash on these gears so small(less than .15mm  or 0.075mm per side of tooth) and gears do not shift the side of tension, just the side of tooth. 

To give an example of this. Roll your board backwards so the road side of the belt is tight. Put a mark on the ground where the center of the axle is. Slowly roll your board forward until the sky side of belt is tight. On my belt drive system this is about 9-10cm of roll distance.  On the gear drive to move from one side of tooth engagement to the other is less then 0.5cm of roll.

So while technically the torque "should" be the same end result in ftlbs. It's more so about the delay of transfer.

Riding for me isn't constant, I'm always on and off the throttle. I guess the only way to explain it, sometimes when im riding and I start braking I pull back super slow at first, because if you switch the side of tension to fast with a belt, it almost has the tendency of "bucking" or bouncing. So you  brake wait for delay, feel engagement then pull back strong.

With gears there's no delay or bounce/belt bucking.

Thanks guys. I'm actually starting out with a couple of heavy duty RC jet boat drives and looking at running dual 80100. As MHZ is ridiculously overpriced.

As well the available boards for esurf are not any type of shapes that resonate with me or even look like they were designed for surfing lol.

I'm likely going to build out the electronics and propulsion system in a PVC tube or the likes and attach it to a Funboard until I get something working. Then going to be hand shaping a wooden pocket squash tail in the 5'9-6'3 range. 

I'll likely use the Vefoil remote. However I have been thinking about making a trigger throttle remote, with a wheel thumb for steering as I could make the Jets steerable.

For now alot of it is up in the air until I test out the jet drives

I have had some real problems with speed wobbles above 33-34 mph on my dual motor switchblade build.  I saw you were using TB extended trucks.  Are you using the stock bushings that came with the trucks or did you upgrade to barrel bushings?  I know my board should be capable of at least 40mph but I just can't get over the speed wobbles :frowning:

I am a pretty experienced downhill rider so I am pretty sure nothing is wrong with my technique or anything.  Its just if I accelerate past 34 the back truck just gets super unstable.

Any advice would be great!

In theory less rolling resistance should equal more range and a probably unnoticeable increase in top speed from whatever less voltage sag you get from less resistance.  Direct torque transfer sounds so nice though.

So I never skate in the rain. And for the last year or so I have managed to avoid it. So I've never really known how well my sealing works.

Well was out in the middle of the forest a few miles. Ended up skating pretty wet greenways  with up to a half inch of water. And then it was pouring for a mile until I found a bridge.

Sealing was fine. But opened my eyes to using a closed DC charging port. So I'm going to be looking at a sealed DC charging port replacement as the charge port, while it didn't short(didn't expect it to) but I did have electrolysis on the water that was in the port. Which cleaned up in a second with alcohol and a fresh Spritz of corrosion X

Nice. I think the double D trim worked pretty darn well(basically a d trim on both sides of the enclosure holes and o-rings on the screws) 

I actually think this board is 100%  for rain riding now...just gonna replace the DC charge plug so it's closed since it faces the ground to avoid electrolysis.

And maybe make some wheel shields for 107s. My legs were so dirty hahaha

I also once almost lost one flap. But it was because the nut became loose. Some silicone-hot glue on the thread fixed it. And since then it has stayed where it should be. 

But your option would be more bullet proof for sure ;)

The good thing is.. it comes with the tip for your charger to change... Or you can just make an adapter 5.5 to new connection and just hot plug it when you need it without cutting your charger. :slight_smile:

Yea mine got ripped off by the sidewalk or grass... It's definitely not long term sealing. And the few times I rode before it got ripped off. it faces the ground.. so it vibrated out... I need something that won't vibrate out..

So figured I'd post a random update about the gear drives. They're sitting at about 350 hard miles. I've smacked them about a dozen times and they just eat it up. And I mean like smacked the shit at like 30mph lol. Anyway, they are built strong and it's really only big ass rocks, and a few curbs whee. I've been half in grass half on street. 

They eat it like a champ, stay square, and just keep rolling. Gear drives for me, are here to stay. I will use them every opportunity I get. I just need @Kug3lis to make a surfrodz version and I will never touch belts again on any future build. 

![1528240628557374930291|666x500](upload://28CF3MXh4ID3phwzZDmpQsCua33.jpg)

Looking forward to V2 and the updates @Kug3lis has in store for us. This is definitely the future IMO. And I've ridden with alot of guys and they cannot even tell it is gears instead of belts. The sound difference is really only picked up by a microphone due to the difference octave of gears and belts. So everyone that has a hold back about gears.. they're just as silent while riding.

Yea... I think the mixture of maintenance over time is gonna be a big plus.

- Gears shouldn't wear out lubricated the way they are
- gear boxes are sealed, so debris cannot get in between the mesh, wearing the gears
- the bearings and gears are lubricated with white lithium paste, in a sealed environment. 

The only point of access for dirt is the outer wheel bearing seal, with regular whiping. In a sealed evnvironment, my bearing maintenance should be 0% for the rear. As well I never have to replace belts, or pulleys. The motor bearings have been replaced on one end with open shielded nsk bearings, and are also open to the lubrication of the gearbox. Which should also enable longer motor life, as the bearings under load are typically the shaft/pulley side that degrade.

I think the extra cost in the beginning, will outweigh maintenance over time, and give me that "endless" ride, with close to no maintenance. As the installed bearings are all new and have never, and will never be subjected to debris to wear down the races, as well the lubrication can not spin out, so the chances of running dry are also minimized...

If they could have a size equal to that of a 36 tooth pulley they would have wider application. At the moment they are only really good on 107mm. 

97mm would not have much clearance. The V2 is going to be slimmed down, how close to the size of a 36t pulley will it be?

[/quote]

Hey man, so the gear, currently is a 36T pulley, with a 7mm pitch tooth(if I am not mistaken correct me if I am wrong @Kug3lis ) 

Pitch tooth = distance from leading edge of gear to leading edge
![4-Tooth-Depth-and-Thickness|690x266](upload://4fJFHUfRHwNHwCdF5A95UjBFkib.jpg)

V2 might be smaller possibly utilizing intermediate to further reduce the wheel spur size, while maintaining a proper pitch length for strength. 

This should enable 90mm wheels to run with my current clearance on 107s. Or 97 to run with more clearance than I have currently, and of course 107s to have the most.

There have been possible talks of add on adapter options, to be able to switch urethane, and 5 spoke hubs, as well as additional options for lubrication, such as lubrication ports, or even a flooded gear box. It's all up in the air. You know as much as I do..

I just know @Kug3lis is going to try to bring the DIY community the only commercially available gearbox(so far) and is making improvements so we all can have something more reliable, and really take our boards into the "everyday commuter ultimate reliability" zone. Sure this may be a bit of an over zealous comment.. but really the end goal here is a board that is a tank that takes all the abuse we throw at it? 

Guess I'm starting to sounds like @b264, although this board has never broken down, I feel like there is so much more that could make this whole system more of a whole and less of a thrown together parts? 

Tl:Dr, reliability for the win, any way of increasing reliability is the future.

94 degrees outside. I knew this day would come.

Similar to my 4s quads that can fly all year, vs my 6&7s quads that are for cooler seasons, and melt motors in the summer.

With powerful builds come complications. Low reduction, high voltage, high amps, and hot days don't mix. 

Batteries sitting around 90F give off amps like a charm, and stay cool(90-100f) duing heavy discharge due to their lowered IR. Focboxes dumping heat into their case and the extra aluminum plate mass I added.

But even with airflow, motors get hot, demagnetizing starts, and you can feel it in the roll. 

Laser temp gun shows:
- 99F cells
- 113F Focboxes(same in app)
- 158F motors.

Hmmm, without giving up performance, I think it's time to find some water cooled motors for the summer heat.

I've been waiting for this moment...
5694's in about 800(SSS)/850kv(hobbystar) is the bottom of the range. The 850's are a bit heavier & rated for less voltage and come with a cnc case with cooling fins. Inrunners should cool more efficiently as the copper is in contact with the case. That said I think they stand up to being over-volted pretty well. The castle inrunners say they can be run at 12s, SSS at 60v.

If you go up to 56112 there is a hobbystar that will do 53v/580kv

Thing is all these motors are heavier, 1050g for the hobbystar 94's, 1150g for the 112's. The thing with water cooling is it will add weight & you might just be better off adding more copper and air cooling it? :thinking:  

I think you might need to go down to smaller 40mm motors to make the water cooling work, you can find sensored motors in that size too ;)

Only way I can imagine the board rotting: you didn't put a thin rubber riser inbetween the riser and the deck and the deck isn't coated with anything.

Only way I can imagine screws rotting: submersed in sea water all the time.

PETG is quite perfect to make watertight models.

Also I think it's quite resistant to water. **cough** _water bottles_ **cough**

Please show me pavements where they radiate more than 90'C when you are riding..

No need to waste plastic on infill, most of my high load applications(like my 3D printed wheels) used 31% grid infill and 4-6 perimeters. Yes, there are edge cases where more walls or more top/bottom layers might be needed, but that's it. :slight_smile:

Also now we have 3D infills like gyroid, that thing is insane even at low values.

Happy New Year
I'm posting because alot of you probably wonder what happened to me. 

Long story short.

I got tired of the bullshit toxicity of most of the "community leads" and frankly didn't want to read your shit or be apart of it any longer. Sure the fuse was lit because none of you seem to understand leverage. But instead of thinking logically, y'all got all emotional about name calling.  

Whatever. Just the same, you all all over on the other forum, calling me names. So you all must be better?

Even broke ass bitches like Skunk, people I've given shit for free to. Well y'all keep on talking, I really don't care. You all can't even get out of your own toxic ways.

When I said I wanted to leave the other forum I meant it, and you all wouldn't let me delete pictures of me, or my belongings, even banned me. Cool, you cut me off from deleting my pictures. So yes, I said, and made some actions to ensure my content would be removed from that site. Because I no longer wanted a part of it. Call it burning bridges or whatever you want. 

Hope y'all find it in yourselves to be better. Because life's great not reading all of y'alls dumb ass egotistical bullshit. 

Sure would have been nice if one of y'all rewrote my how to's with your own pictures, but none of you all obviously care enough about the community to help others either. Y'all think you act like a community, but where's all the helpful posts? Oh I know, you don't have anybody that contributes back. Shame. 

Keep on making up stories, it's all conjecture. Have a good year, build something amazing.

Edit: for good measure and final thoughts 🖕🖕🖕🖕

Nah pretty sure I called a dude a pussy, and and also stated that anything stopping your feet from leaving the board will accelerate your head faster to pavement. 

But hey whatever. 

Also @skunk, you forget the mounts, trucks, riot plugs, bronson g3s. And you not paying shipping but sure. Ok. 

Also me? Victim? No. I made it obviously clear I wanted gone. And my privileges to remove my shit was removed when I was banned. So yea I had a nice "chat" with Damon, which was not so nice. And then my shit was deleted.

I came here for all the mentions and PM's I had to state why I'm gone, that's all. Go back to your holes. ✌️

To be clear I made one an only one threat to the mods, and that was a legal threat to Damon. Did I message the mods I thought were friends, and say what the fuck did you ban me for? Yep, and when I got treated like a guy that hadn't been on these forums for 3 years I flipped my shit.

Even worse you didn't ban me until I decided I wanted to leave, you didn't ban me over the fighting with s5300, but a whole day later, as soon as I started removing my posts, y'all banned me, so that I couldn't.

So I wanted all my shit removed. And I got it removed. But hey bye.

Did you actually type that with a serious face on? Honest question.

I PM'd you once because I thought you'd had a stroke and was doing a wellness check out of goodwill. The other times were for the lolz because we realized you were a narcissistic little child throwing a tantrum.

Brad I hate to break it to you but people do not think of you this much. You are not as big of a deal to others as you are in your own mind. This is the narcissism we speak of. 

I think people asked, in general, once, where you went. The general response consensus was: "He acted like a little child and threw a tantrum".

So that's the impression you left. Weakoz Anklez Deckoz.

It was said as a joke, Because if you really tried to explain what happened it would sound dumb. 

And yet the people on the internet on the forum were upset, whether it be by my decision, my actions or what have you. 

Its funny to me, because somehow it mattered to ya'll on the internet that I don't take my stuff and go. lol. Yet in real life if this was a in person forum for discussion, You wouldn't be getting all butthurt when a guy doesn't want to be a part of your forum any longer. Some might be upset but you aren't going to stop them from leaving... unless your a cult. Right? 

So again, comparing this to a real life circumstance. Lol, I find it humorous. Because, in real life, you take your stuff and leave, and its that simple. I tried to take my stuff and leave the forum and you tell me no cant delete stuff and were banning you.  

There is no narcissism here,  You just have to understand the context, which was Internet vs real world. 

Unfortunately the internet exists in the real world, and people react when its no longer words behind a keyboard. 

Lol keep tooting narcissist, it really doesn't fit the bill. You, really don't know me, but your all going to put whatever label on me you feel like I'm sure to make yourselves feel better.

Honestly agree with @ducktaperules so much

He’s here cause he wants his big apology from the whole forum and for all of us to beg him to forgive us And then he will go ok if you insist I will come back and be the heart and soul of your community.

Eh no

Every one of us except @brenternet ( top of the food chain ) has been given a rough time by the rest of the community either get over it and stop acting like a 5 year old or just go leave 

We only tried to stop you taking your posts cause they weren’t yours anymore. When you posted them they were part of a community which you had given them to.

Be your grumpy little self and leave hope your mummy isn’t here to make you feel better

Woah!    This bro got roasted.   
I think it’s best if he stop replying and part ways like he’s been promising to do 

I don’t know him but calling someone a “broke ass bitch” is such a bitch ass move imo.   Equivalent to a kick in the nuts I’d say “low blow”   Something someone does when they’re desperate!!    
Happy to see his economic situation is good but Bare in mind.   Life is a roller coaster with lotta ups n downs.   Today might be skunk having financial struggles but tomorrow might be him

Speed away in your 13s brother.   Well miss ya!    OR NOT 🤷🏻‍♂️

Ps.   There is no need to tag him in this comment as I know he’ll be reading it 😉

@Tamatoa made a good point on the other forum  

He can only read the posts with his name in on the other forum if they are in normal categories if they are in the lounge or green room we can bully him all we like without him ever finding out

Or until we show them to him cause we want a laugh :laughing:

No that's _exactly_ what you said @Tamatoa.

Or the equivalent of giving something away, knowing they need help, so you throw in extra shit because they need help and you try to be nice. Then talk shit behind your back after you try to help.

Lol he was used as an example.

Was very public. Never behind your back.
Giving someone free shit it's a get out of jail free card for being called out on acting like an asshole.

One of my first builds started with a broken Haloboard. No shame in getting creative with what you've got on hand lil guy.

Those hubs were better then R-SPECs.
