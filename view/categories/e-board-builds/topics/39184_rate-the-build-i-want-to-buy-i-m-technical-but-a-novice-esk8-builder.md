I'm about to hit the BUY BUTTON, but I would love some feedback on my parts list. 
I still need a board, wheels, and bearings. I'd love some recommendations.

Let me know if you have any part replacement recommendations... these black Friday prices seem pretty solid.

For some background info: I live near San Francisco, not price sensitive, I weight 220 lbs, and will be using this to commute to work.

Well I haven't hit the buy button yet. I thought I would wait for the PROs to give me some much needed feedback.

There's no way any of that will work untill you delete your duplicate thread

Am 180lb and 6'2 basically have the same set up just without the sensors and 12s4p using 12s lipos ,yet to find any hill I can not destroy going 30+ on it with dual 6374 190kv's just remember it is crazy fast and alot of torque 6374's is not for everyone just keep that in mind just for those few crazy people or what I'd call "enthusiast" also wheels matter alot my brakes when I had 90mm were amazing when I upgraded to 97's I could go alot faster but my breaks were a bit slightly weaker this is just from my observation,and I understand changing gear helps but am fine using 12mm belts

Instead of that VESC and remote, buy the focbox VESC and the remote from this site instead 
http://www.enertionboards.com
They are higher quality and on a crazy good deal for Black Friday.

Also, the battery you are getting has a built in on/off switch, so no need to buy one

Any resources to read up about what the benefits of the Enertion FOCBOX (http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/FOCBOX-programmable-brushless-motor-controller/) are vs. The Torque Boards VESC (products/torque-esc-vesc-bldc-electronic-speed-controller)? With the sale, they are the same price, I can see that the cooling situation is better on the Enertion, but are there any other major advantages?

Am using the loaded flex 2 bamboo board it's good if u clear the middle and distribute the weight because I use lipos and the weight is in the back and front not the middle it feels amazing I think my set up works because of that like "boosted board " my next build will be with a stiff deck because am going to go 18650 cells probably the landyatchz Evo deck

FOC runs super smooth and quiet but Torqueb. Vesc often can't handle FOC. hence the name Focbox. Enertion's are usually around 145 so the offer  is rock solid.

What country are you located in? I know of a few good stiff boards but shipping to outside of US can get expensive
