This is actually ver 2 of this build. Started out buying parts for it in Sept 2018. I completed it in December 2018.  But after 2 accidents. psa; wear safety gear! multiple esc failures and many lessons learned. I decided to upgrade to a Hummie deck. I will try to  go in detail as much as possible. But this is my first official build topic so bare with me lol. Feel free to make suggestions critique and offer advice as I'm constantly trying to learn and improve! Non of this wouldn't be possible without the input parts and inspiration from this forums members I thank you all!

If I am honest, I don't like the look of those batteries.
No fish paper rings on the positive pole, no rounded nickel strips, holes burned on some of the welds etc.

It seems like their is no hot glue or slicon, which is a big no-no, that will put lots of strain on the nickle

Those pictures were the  only ones I had but definitely not the finished product as you see theres also no bms or connections between P groups I will post more recent pictures with fish paper and tape. I did a lot research before attempting to build a battery still made a few mistakes still learning.

also all of those little pointy edges are like little razor blades for your shrink wrap/shortage protection. You ought to somehow work that out

He seems he does. Get in his shoes, he spent all that time building that big battery. He seems to understand his mistakes but let's be honest, disassembling all these cells and doing it again is a huge undertaking.

Personally I would still do it but I can also get it why someone would not.

For real: do you wanna have flames out off your board?

That you donâ€™t use fishpaper on the positive side off the battery: ok!
But those sharp corners can cut in other cells. 
Also those welds look not that good. Your battery have to deal with much vibration

It can even happen to a well regarded company, who have passed levels of certification... something your battery... might not pass 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/official-warning-boosted-boards-2-0-battery-fires/12428




Look at this thread, his battery had insulated caps, and was built decently, and still ended up in a fire 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/my-battery-pack-turned-into-fireworks/41458

All sharp corners have been trimmed BEFORE the battery pack was complete.  These pictures are bit misleading. That welds are good it survived 2 accidents unfortunately. Could the welds be better sure fish paper on positives check on my checklist for the next battery.... I don't deal with much vibration on a day to day.... but it has been through some of the worst roads without any issues.... stay tuned.

Thanks for the warning I have seen my share of these catastrophes online. If any my boards goes up in flames I will be the first post here and on Instagram. I don't believe it will.

These guys are worried for your safety. We have recently had someone almost lose their entire family's apartment thanks to a battery fire. You did an "update post" and still hadn't cut the corners off the positive side terminals. They aren't doing this to neg you or make you feel bad. They are doing that to help you. Please understand this and fix it.

You should have put fish paper between the p-groups like shown below.
If the shrink wrap gets damaged due to friction the negative side of the cells will touch and you will have a short.

You HAVE to put fish paper between each parallel pack so that doesnâ€™t happen.

I know. But there is NO fish paper between the cells like @taz showed in a picture above.

Think about it this way. You have nickel connected from positive end on one set of cells to negative on the other. Now if the cells wrap is compromised and that next set of cells negative touches the body of the previous group, thats the same as the first cells positive directly touching it's own negative.

yeah Im running a double stack and 6" pnuemis...but still think I may have to throw a 1/2 riser on my trucks.... a single stack would be great but we are where we are... plus i got a 44degree base plate on the rear and that lowers the rear to...like a low rider lol

When you rip off the old nickel strips use a dremel tool and grind down smooth the old weld spots on the cells.

It is suggested to use. It is not necessary but for the price off fishpaper you can better use it. 

I use it for more then 6months in my packs. (I post my packs on instagram in a random order)

Those batteries dont have fish paper cause they use plastic cell holders that dont allow the cells to touch each other at all. Similar to this 

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2526936

If the p grous can physically touch each other you must insulate them with something like fishpaper.

Id have to dig through my pictures but i did find an example here on the forums 

See how the space cell has the black plastic cell holders on each side of the cell in the pic.

Yeah, mine certainly didn't....

I WANT TO BE CLEAR, I HAD NO LEGITIMATE ISSUES WITH MY PACK
I simply couldnt get it running again because my skill at building and fixing things is a fat 0 


If I had to bet, since I don't have the pack anymore, and I haven't found all the pictures I know I took, that there was no fishpaper either... heres the pictures 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/optimized/3X/6/e/6e41ed7846872ca7c027e4b8833ed726dfe4b8f1_2_1035x582.jpg

![20170924_123324|281x500](upload://qWkglPKHpzbU3hzMR5XA9pNQesK.jpeg) 

in the last two ignore the white wrapping, I clearly didn't take good care of the pack (I made a half-assed attempt at dissecting and reshaping the pack, didn't work well)

The balance wires were layed on another like that out of the wrapper, I didnt break or bend them or anything, in the pictures above I had just removed the protective layers

No official specs I've done 31mph on the old deck very stable. Max calculated speed 49mph... Range would probably be around 30-60 miles depending on the wheels.
