This is my cheap build. Using my old habitat leaf lines longboard that is 5 years old
Final price of the build: $300US. 
This things so loud it sounds like a subway train ðŸ˜‚. Turns heads everywhere, and dogs go nuts trying to attack it because of the sound.

I had to make a steel bushing between the motor shaft and pulley, because dickyho sent me a 10mm bore pulley, dispite me having told him to send a 8mm bore pulley, he said he sent me the 8mm to replace the 10mm but I haven't received it after about 3weeks now. I'm still happy with his kit , just had to make a custom adjustment there. 

Conclusion: 
This board runs well, has enough torque to throw you off it. Slightly sensitive controller with braking either at max or none, but I don't mind. Acceleration is gradual from a complete stop. I love the controller but it loses connection when close to my phone, just can't have the phone too close. The controller has adjustable speed settings, max, med, min. The board charges in 2 hours with the bms and charger, all through one port. The esc runs hot , but comes with the small heatsink so it hasn't fried yet. Has reverse and regen braking I believe. So far I'm happy, just gotta tighten up those bushing so I don't get a speed wobble and crash again. 

Charger has a car heater plug that I wired up. Controller charges through android phone charging port.
