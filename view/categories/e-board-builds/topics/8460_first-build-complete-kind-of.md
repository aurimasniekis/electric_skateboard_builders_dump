Hey guys so I built my first board and it works well coming to the problem but when I mount it the board doesn't move me at all I think its just spinning its wheel in the back. It's a mono build and I think that maybe the issue I'm 6'7 310-320 depending on the day. I have the 2.40-1 rat so I'm guessing I need more torque to move my size and weight or should I does my size force me to get a duel build?

Build spec is 190kv tb motor 12s 8000mah

What ESC are you using? It should be able to move you. If you are using a vesc you may have to change some settings.

Can you post some screenshots of your settings? Have you configured the VESC?

Why didn't u get 149kv 6473 motor? Im 210 an have single motor set up and it push me to 30 on flts with 16/36 and 83mm wheels, i think with that load 300lbs even with 149kv and a torque gearing setting u would need a fual diagonal is a lot of weigh for a single

I'll never buy from HobbyKings they tired to steal 155 dollars from me and I have to go to small claims to get my money back since paypal was useless and my bank could rule in my favor. I'll die before I give them a since cent again.

Change your max voltage to 57. That is probably why it isn't working.

I live in San Diego, in short I ordered 3 things from them 2 motors and a dc charger. They only sent me out the charger and never gave me the motors and they told me the order is closed and wouldn't give me back my money. Paypal sided with them saying I got the package but the package only had the charger in it and they basically told me to piss off. So I called my bank tried to get my money back from them still no, so I went to court opened suit vs them and my court date is soon and I'll get my money back and time I put into this so basically suing them for like 500$ now since all the time I used for this bs. Hobbyking imo can burn in hell but remember I'm not bitter haha.

Your motor max could also be increased to 40-50. It may go past 40 for a few seconds when you are first starting.

I've switched it and it's still the same thing just feels like the motor is shacking but not moving the wheel.

Hey, I'm in San Diego. Howdy neighbor.
Set your max motor amps to 60
and your max batt amps to 60
Don't try to stand on the board and go from a dead stop.
Give it 2 or 3 pushes to get it rolling before you give it gas.

So I just put it to 45a and it works a hell of a lot better I just need to push it once then it picks up after that, would it hurt if I put it to 50a. NNGG. No I only thought lock tight was going on the 4 screws that mounts the motor to the mount. What else need lock tight and I'll get it done.

50 amps would work. Pushing the limits though. 50 wont hurt but is the max the vesc can do for a short amount of time. You will never be doing 50 continuously though

Hahahaha yes that blue thing isbyour wheel pulley and phase wires are the 3 wires that connects the motor to your vesc

K so what should I be looking for on the phase wires? is it the other pulley with like 15 teeth than is the motor pulley that needs to have locktight on it?

Doesn't matter about the phase wires. They are the motor wires and I thought they may be shorting, but they aren't because it was the amp settings. Motor pulley is the gear on your motor. The blue one is the wheel pulley.

Got ya I'll get this done after work tonight. Thank you all for your help and input. Namasaki bought up moving up my max batt amps from 20a to 60a should I being it up to like 45a where my motor is now?

## \#38 Posted by: lox897 Posted at: 2016-08-28T03:00:11.555Z Reads: 53

I'd move it to 60. @Namasaki Is it 60amps on both vesc or 30 on both?

## \#40 Posted by: lox897 Posted at: 2016-08-28T03:03:18.846Z Reads: 50

That's the absolute maximum input voltage. We are talking about how many amps the battery is allowed to output to the vesc.

You don't have to. If the settings you have now are working then you should be fine. Don't go over 50 though. It can break a VESC.

Thats why im asking i have it set at 70a motor max and been riding hard, so i gues for safety i should lower it to 50 but it seems that even when i go hard uphill i dont reach 50A
```

## \#48 Posted by: lox897 Posted at: 2016-08-28T03:54:24.464Z Reads: 46

Basically it is allowing the VESC to accept 70amps when the maximum is 50. Hummie runs 70amps and hasn't destroyed his vesc yet because he hasn't reached 50+ amps.
