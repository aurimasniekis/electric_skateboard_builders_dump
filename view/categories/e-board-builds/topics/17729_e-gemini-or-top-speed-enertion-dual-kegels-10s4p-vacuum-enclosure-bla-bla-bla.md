I aim at cleanest build possible with basic hometools. Actually that's very easy since all I have to do is vacuum form enclosure and shorten my deck few centimeters.

I haven't deside which deck I will use. Riviera Gemini or Landyachtz Top Speed

Other parts:
- Enertion vesc 
- Enertion 6355 motors
- Group buy 10s4p without bms
- @esk8 vedder power switch 
- @JuniorPotato93 or @WSB motor mounts (WSB can you answer me)  
- Caliber II 44s
- Orange Kegels
- Enertion 12mm 15T motor pulleys and @Idea 12mm 36T 3D printed wheel pulleys
- abs enclosure by me

I've collected parts over half year and I'm still waiting some parts like battery... This board should be done by end of this month or max week 9. After that I have to start studying to entrance examination. 

PICTURES ARE NICE SO PIC SPAM COMING

I'm riding an older TopSpeed for downhill, because the W-concave is awesome.
Still one of my favourite decks!

I think i do swappable deck. Riviera is slightly flexier and lower than top speed which look a lot faster and has awesome grip thanks to w-concave. BUT it's twisted. And i don't have any idea why.

Got mounts from @WSB. These are great! It's super snug fit with 12mm belts, but with extra spacers and filed bolts i can get 2-3m more space between my motors.
