Nice build @tonys ! I couldn't tell from the video if you did this already, but make sure to tape or heat-shrink your motor leads to the ESC connectors. You don't want them to disconnect while you're riding. Great looking enclosure!

Great video. The enclosure looks awesome. I think it's the first one I have seen underneath on a mountainboard. Might not be the first, but still a good job man.

Nice MTB! Just wonder how you can reach a distance of 9 - 12 miles with a 10s 5Ah battery. I even cann't reach it with a streetboard with dual hubs.
Have a good time with your E-MTB.

I was surprised how far I can go also. Of course its on flat roads at a moderate steady speed. I would guess it rolls a lot easier with the large tires as compared to small skateboard wheels.

Sure thing @tueboard, I got the mechanical parts (pulleys, belts, etc) from Scramboards. But it took 2 months to get all the parts because there was a problem getting the motor mounts. They were out of stock like forever. Couldn't find a motor mount for the MBS trucks so I swapped out for Trampa trucks on the rear (drive) axle.  Your list of parts is correct. Here's links to the sites I used:

Motors, batteries: https://hobbyking.com/en_us
VESC: diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/
VESC with warranty: http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/vedder-s-speed-controller
Mini Remote: http://www.dhgate.com/store/product/2-4ghz-mini-remote-controller-with-receiver/377608417.html#sshot_-1-null
Mechanical Drive Parts: https://www.scramboards.com/conversion-kits/kit-4-mechanical-drive-train-brackets-parts-kit.html
Also used Ebay for many of the electrical connections such as the series connector, battery meter etc: http://www.ebay.com/itm/2016-Battery-Capacity-Tester-Indicator-for-12V-24v-36v-48v-CAR-Lead-acid-lithium/172143986261?_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851&_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIC.MBE%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20131003132420%26meid%3Df11d625055f44abaab01d75be8c85db2%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D2%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D331879101797

One other thing about the drive parts. If you get them from Scramboards, make sure the small cog (gear) that slides onto the motor is the same inside dimension as the drive shaft on your motor because there are different sizes. You need to tell Scramboards that before you order. Also, the motor I used, Turnigy192kv, mounting holes did not line up with the holes on the motor mount arm. I just drilled out new holes to fit. It is easy to do just make sure you get it lined up exactly.

The motor mounts, do they stay put?  I have the same motor mounts and truck.  My threadlocked set screws back out and cause the motor mounts to slip after about 20 minutes of riding.

Nice build and video.   Mine is a scramboard complete.

Hi @Aggdaddy,

The set screws are only there as a backup. The main mechanism to lock onto the axle is the 2 larger bolts that run thru the motor mount. You have to REALLY TORQUE THEM DOWN TIGHT. They will not slip once they are locked tight onto the axle. I'm sure you just didn't tighten the main bolts down enough. I ran into the same situation. Oh, and be sure to use the blue "threadlock" on all bolts .lmk if that helps.
```

Awesome,  thanks.    I saw those, but they didn't seem like they could be tightened any further. 

I'll try it later on tonight.

You can also get motor mounts and pulleys from @Nowind. Belt drive or chain drive they're awesome.

Eh, its ok if you like to work on stuff like remote control cars and stuff.  I've had nothing but problems since I got it, but once I got my replacement vescs and ironed out some issues like remote and motor mounts, its a blast.   I can recommend getting a electric mountain board, but not the builder.   Although, they have been working with me fairly well to get it working.   

The current set up is fast, but not enough torque.  The builder has offered to sell me some 190KV motors at a discounted price and I think that will get me the torque I need to just hit the throttle and go.   Right now, I have to edge it forward a bit to get it to go.  

besides all that, its great.  Battery lasts about 7 to 8 miles of medium to hard throttle.

Thanks for the info on the board i couldn't find any reviews on there boards. It looks like there boards dont come as advertised. Im going to get an EMTB , i guess ill have to build one the way i want it.

Yeah, they need to make some adjustments to their website to accurately depict what they are selling.   They have made some changes to the board and seems like it is for the better from what the main contact has been telling me, but there is still the issue of quality control that I have an issue with.  If I was going to build one again, I'd get the parts from trampa directly and then get with barajabali and ollinboards for electronics.

Nice man, I'm looking into doing a similar build to yours over the summer. How do the belts hold up? I know they are quieter than the chain but are they durable?

Thanks man! So far they are holding up excellent and yes very quiet. I regularly take 5-6 mile rides on and off-road and belts look fine. Not once have they slipped or given me problems plus they are cheap to replace when needed.

First thing I will purchase is a board. Which MBS board is good?

2nd: trucks. I was thinking caliber II 10"? Or these

3rd: Motor Brackets. Not sure where to get one.

4th: I'm gonna get the turnigy SK3 192kv motors.

5th: I'd like to go Chain drive, So this is where I will need the most help in finding the right ones; along with the right sprockets for it.

Ive got the MBS Comp 95. Only board I've ridden happy with it so not sure about other boards. 

As for trucks you definitely need to make sure they are compatible with motor mounts. My MBS  trucks had a "bump" (same as the one in you link) where the brake goes which prevented me from using the motor mounts I chose. I had to get Trampa trucks which fit perfectly. 

Do a search for the motor mounts. I paid around $100. Hobby King started selling some very inexpensive electric skateboard parts so check them first. I can't vouch on quality though so maybe pose the question on this forum. Either way here's a link: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/motor-mount-5.html?countrycode=US&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIov6Yzsev1wIVFpN-Ch34twdbEAQYASABEgLNA_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds

Your motor idea is good

I wouldn't use chain drive. I'd go with belt drive. Easy to get, belts are cheap to replace, quieter, lighter and easy to adjust. Just my opinion.

@Idea has some rather sexy new belt drive pulleys and mounts made for the trucks that come with the Birds comp 95 
https://www.atbshop.co.uk/mountainboard-accessories/mbs-matrix-ii-mountainboard-trucks
These trucks IMO are a lot better than the MBS spring trucks and as said  above the knobbly break bit on the spring trucks is kinda in the way for a chunky well made mount.


The @Idea mount.

I'm really liking this board: 
https://www.mbs.com/boards/91115-mbs-atom-90-mountainboard and its a decent price for a 1st board.

This truck looks good. Is 16" a good width?
http://www.trampaboards.com/infinity-trucks--solid-hanger-body-with-12mm-solid-axles--mega-strong-p-11151.html it comes with an option for a bolt kit, but not sure which size I need. M5x20mm, m5x25mm, and m5x30mm. The board I linked doesn't show which one I would need.

Is this good? I think you have linked this on this thread.

The MBS 90 board should be fine. All the links to parts you listed will work well together. Yes that is the mechanical drive kit from Scramboards that I used. It works really well. You just have to make sure you really tourque down the bolts that hold the motor mount  to the truck axel or it will slip. When you get to that point and you find the motor mounts are slipping message me back and I will give you more guidance. Hard to explain at this point but you will see when you're assembling everything. 

Not sure about which bolt kit you will need. I would message the company and ask what they recommend. Also, the kit from Scramboards has different size inside diameter motor cogs (the small gear that attaches to the motor shaft.) Be sure to measure the diameter of the motor shaft (192KV) and give it to Scramboards when you order the kit.

Hey @tonys i started to make my own emtb because of your video! I Just started building mine 2 days ago. Need 2 more days to build it i suppose. I'm also trying to document my build with a video.
Maybe that's why my build is going slowly... How is your board holding up after 1 year?

Cool! Thanks Stefanj! Im very happy about how my board is holding up. When my build was about a month old I had a problem with one of the VESC. I believe it was faulty. I replaced it from a different distributor and has been perfect ever since. Batteries are still holding a good charge and still using the original drive belts. Good luck on your build. Send me a link to your video when you put it up.

Hi @tonys,
I currently have a Fiik Street surfer board and have been looking into upgrading to a mountainboard and building my own. I came across your video about a week ago and have watched it many times. Just found this thread now. Thank you so much for providing this info. 
I'm also considering getting my parts through scram boards,but I'm going to spend a little more time searching around. Seems like there is a lot of variety at the moment in regards to parts and providers and I'm getting a little lost in it all.
I'll be sure to keep watching this thread, and many others on this forum and hopefully, one day, I can share my build here as well.
