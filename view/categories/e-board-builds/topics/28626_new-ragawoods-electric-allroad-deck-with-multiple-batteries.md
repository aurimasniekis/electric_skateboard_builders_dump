A little more info? I'm assuming they are decks made for the diy market? They look like you would need large wheels for ground clearance with those enclosers. Why not show us a detailed finished product.

Nice idea... but if you can find a way to get concave in there that'd be great

Cool. What type of motors are you going to use? Satellite config looks like it might have serious clearance issues. Are you going to use hub motors?
