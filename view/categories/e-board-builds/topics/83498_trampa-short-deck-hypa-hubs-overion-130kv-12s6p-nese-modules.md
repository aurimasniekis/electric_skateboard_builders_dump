And finally I can start my post! 
It took me soo long before I could reach this point, my ignorance about all this electric stuff, my inexperience, I've had to learn and read tons of stuff here on the forum, but I'm nearly there to complete my first build! ![20190207_182619|666x500](upload://l1rSkrk717eBezbqo4XZFIVZr5R.jpeg) 
This is my baby, a Trampa Short deck with vertigo trucks, Hypa wheels
![20190207_182631|374x500](upload://iSyHgn3thhH4UQ6r5RMEm78kSrT.jpeg) 
I routed the cables in underneath, I don't like to have wires on top
![20190207_182651|374x500](upload://u7ijTkKw6qoKIkNu9LsLN6cyClQ.jpeg) 
I'll use a dual focbox  in an Aluminum enclosure to control 2x 3500 watt 130KV, the torque it's insane!! As I'll do mostly offroad tracks, I'm going to use a chain drive system![20190207_182513|374x500](upload://ydqInGbiPswU4rGwiU6OD0d097Q.jpeg) 
![20190207_182651|374x500](upload://u7ijTkKw6qoKIkNu9LsLN6cyClQ.jpeg) 
Next things to do:
I'm going to use NESE modules in a 12s6p configuration, I'm not sure tho which cells to use... either 30q or Lg HG2 or samsung 25R...
Once I order it I can wire the BMS, Bestech 80A, could anyone check my wiring?
I'll use a hardshell case as enclosure in this way![20190207_185819|375x500](upload://vMlfXPz3ZMCbuBVr3TCCZNjdags.jpeg) 
![20190207_185912|374x500](upload://nVl7ttaOpVObzdpsyOxjTtVR5yq.jpeg) 
![20190207_185759|374x500](upload://kXs5droZa6SxJkQWdpDiklvAarT.jpeg)
![20190207_190003|375x500](upload://yJ9uMEbrCoD9PGkFTqzEARrEM7E.jpeg)  
That's it for the moment, I'll keep you updated!!

Awesome mate.  Answer me one thing though.  Did you already build it and get it all dirty and then take it all apart to do the build thread?  :thinking:

I did a test, to check everything was working fine, I had a cheap 10s5p battery and I went once in the woods, these are the results!! The torque was amazing, I'm running foc, and with these unbranded cells I was doing wheelies so damn easily, I want to see how it will be with a proper battery! Do you think the wiring diagram is correct?

Is it just me or the motor mounts are flipped to the inside?

I actually think that kinda works well with the chain placement. You‚Äôre right tho

Nice 1st one !! :+1: 

@Grozniy yes, it is supposed to be like that on those
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/img_201087_1428.jpg
But if it works you could set them the other way, or also flip just the motor plate to adjust the height in relation to the ground.

But they are very versatile!

Wooooow duuude your builds are awesome!!!!
I still don't know tho if I like trampa vertigo trucks, I might switch to matrix pro2, I don't know what to do with turning radius, when I go in the woods I need to do sharp carving otherwise I'll end up eating all the branches on my way.... did you find the same problem?

I even prefer the Overion mount for matrix, the fixing system on this hanger is stronger, the mount can't get loose at all !
And yes, in the little trail in hood I have to jump the front to make a more radical turn (like at 0'25" and 31" , 1'27" ...) :

Which cells would you choose? I heard nice things about the 25r but 30q would give me 18Ah which isn't bad at all!!

I will let li-ion people advises you better than me ^^

(I will order a 12s20p soon :smile: with 30q if I'm right)

30Q is the standard go-to li-ion cell price-power wise, you are already getting the front wheels to rise with torque, short wheelbase helps with that ü§ó

So unless you want crazy high lipo discharge...for power flips

Nah I guess I'll be fine with 30q, my bms is for discharge as well, so 80A max output, lipos are great power density and discharge, but I'm quite scared for the factory faults and I love my home, I don't wanna burn it down to the ground, li ion are a bit more stable, especially with NeSe modules

:rofl: ahah, it's way I still don't make my own li-ion pack, having lipo since so long time without any pb, I have trouble changing my habits :sweat_smile:

does your pulley hold it tight enough for the motor to not rattle?
