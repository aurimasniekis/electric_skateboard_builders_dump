Hi guys, I saw a thread here that started the talk about 107mm wheels And I thought that there might be a lot of people interested. 
Does anyone know if those wheels will work with regular flywheel pulleys?
Also I understood that there is a slimmer version of those ( I think it's call superflys (?)) . If anyone knows where to get them and where to get pulleys for them that would work with regular caliber trucks please help. 
Thanks in advance!

Your best bet would probably be to hear back from @ChrisChaput

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/larger-than-97mm-thanes-is-there-such-a-creature/27734/21

Im sure he can list a few dealers who will offer them or something (if they are not already taken by someone)

Update from another thread:

Somewhat ironically, many 97mm Flywheels in 75a were hand delivered to Evolve USA in Carlsbad California by yours truly last week ...

I'm picking up some production 107mm SuperFly's tomorrow and they're almost all spoken for ;-(

He said the new super flys where all spoken for but if he can let us know when a second batch might be ready that's would be good. And if we can do a group buy here for the second batch? @ChrisChaput

Do you think they'll be worth the price? Cause I could just get the evolve all terrain kit if I want bigger wheels for 200$
