Yes they will go,  but not very fast or with much torque. You will have to modify the trucks quite a bit also

Cool video :-), he can get only 10 mph though and with 4 motors :-) , maybe overvolting them like he says can get more speed but for that more expensive esc  etc etc....

I used one on a scooter, worked pretty well, they have ok power and torque considering the price, mothing special though, you won't be blown away by the performance

Did you overvolted them?, maybe 52v , the problem is that vescs are reallly expensive.... , i did a electric bike with 2 350w motors and i can go uphill really good and go 40km/h

I believe his speed issue(in the video) was that he was using the motor controller out of the hoverboard -- I've got a pair of these motors for some robotics use, and at about 20v I got 18mph with a 100lb bot. this controller: https://odriverobotics.com/shop/odrive-v35
That controller is not really suitable for skateboard applications, but hoverboard motors can do much more than that video shows, without over-volting. it's a matter of how fast the controller can switch fields from coil to coil.
I agree with @Livid, the motors won't wow you, but they don't fail without profound physical damage so they could do okay for a tank (heavy and nigh-indestructible) build

Flipsky vescs are pretty cheap but have their downsides compared to focboxes

There should be a used one for 50$ or so in the marketplace

I have two motors from a wrecked hoverboard I have. Iv'e been meaning to try them out, just haven't really found a use yet.
