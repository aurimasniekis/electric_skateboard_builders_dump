What off-road truck set can I use for my 6374 flipsky motors?
I need proper advice, like if someone already built one.
I can't find the exact match for my motors.

Almost any channel truck or MTB truck should work.  You need a price range and use conditions too

At the moment I have Torque board brand 218mm trucks kit with mounts.
I bought 4 off-road wheels, but I think truck is too small.
Any brand or link suggestion?
