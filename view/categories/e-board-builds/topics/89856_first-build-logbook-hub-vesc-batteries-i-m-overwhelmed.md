```
So i want to build my first board, this are the specs i want to achieve:

Top speed: 30 km/h |
Range: >30km |
Hub Motors, because "water resistant" ?

What i got:

Me: 75kg, 173cm |
This board:
https://www.arborcollective.com/us/catalog/product/view/id/38196/s/axis-40-photo-19/category/273/
Budget: not a lot | somewhat soldering skills

Also:
Where i live its pretty much flatland and i don't plan on hill climbing.
I plan to 3D-print every housing housing.
I´ll use this board a lot, so quality of components should not be crappy.

----------------------------
I got a rough idea of everything i need, but i still have no idea what exact motor to buy, how many batteries i need for this speed and range and which vesc i suited for this use case.

I'm happy for any helpful information you guys can provide me, thanks

The only hub motor that can compete with a proper diy belt, gear, direct, or chain drive is @Hummie's. It's a quality piece of machinery and has been tested pretty well by some highly respected members here.

The waterproof hub thing is simply not true. It's a quick and easy setup but you have your motors that much closer to the ground. It all comes down to how well you waterproof your components.

There are lots if esk8 calculators for range and speed here, search up top and you will find them. 

We are a similar weight so I can say a 10s battery will do you just fine.

Glad to have you here bud! Welcome to the best hobby/lifestyle out there period.

Not really my friend @venom121212. This :point_down: monster can compete ('obliterate' maybe the correct word) any Hub motor in the world today and perhaps 90% of all the known belt driven boards on the planet. Its name: **Airless 4WD** manufactured by [On-ix](https://www.on-ix.com). 50 mile range; 40mph top speed; 4 Hub motors; 115mm spiderweb pattern airless, 80mm wide wheels; 13 kgs; 12s8p battery; 8kw; $1300.

I'll be honest, I saw this one posted the other day, clicked the thread, saw how hideously shaped the deck is, and clicked out.

I hope the specs are really that fantastic! How many miles do you have on it? What's the actual range? If they could just make it look better, I'd be interested!

It's nice that it works strong but there's no impressive feat given it's an AWD. 
I'm more interested to see how it fights again other AWD boards and if they plan to sell these hubs for DIY (which I kinda doubt cause it might not do service to the board itself).

Let's see how the 2WD version copes with the rest ! Should be a better benchmark.

Note that OP only wants a reliable board able to go 30 km/h, that's nowhere a beast setup :beer:

but seriously did you drive the average board or the pro board? I think that is a big difference as well.

Did somebody of you opened up the hubs after like 500km of riding? would be interesting to see how they look inside after that.

Hmmmmmm 40mph ay? I can tell by the photos of your 2WD board in your post that that must be legit and tested by you. May I have some complimentary snake oil and a Carvon Evo 2WD to go with my order?

In all seriousness though these hubs 100% will not beat a set of Hummies in terms of performance. I also wish these sites would stop claiming "6kw of power" when the battery and ESC clearly can not support it.

@MonteToast I would concentrate on buying some goot quality parts like a Vesc (Ollin/Enertion), get a good samsung 30q pack at 10s which will support the speed you want and whatever drive train you prefer. Do a bit of research and come back to us with what you find and I'm sure you will be met with some very critical analysis and arguments that will lead to the perfect build for you :stuck_out_tongue:

isnt really an argument against them, and more so an argument against the way the market has been created :thinking: 

Plenty of board makers say their boards supply (max motor wattage) x 2. 

Another piece of adverisement woowoo is the 4x higher than average electric acceleration on pro mode - What is the average? What 'acceleration' do you mean? 0-15mph? The whole powerband?

Do you see what I mean? Its just fluffy marketing BS


I want to know more, I want to see videos, photos and diagrams on this new board 

At the very least, they give ( what I would assume to be) fairly honest and accurate ratings when it comes to battery range and what not. That alone inspires hope for me, as that is the easiest field to just cobble shit together and lie to the consumer

You want to shreed this board (like you guys always do)? go on boys, is all yours. Disect the fcker, thats what you love to do, no? 

I tested this board and you don't. I've feel it and you don't. I've seen it and you don't. Until you test it, you feel it and see it, then you can bring your acid coments, you end of the world reviews, your nasty opinions. Until then all is speculative. So thats what we should take all your opinions: speculation. :zipper_mouth_face:

Pix out.

well excuse me for not being bothered to scroll up to read your name :roll_eyes:  It wasnt even meant to be disrespectful :man_shrugging: 

If anything, I was defending this board you want to talk about, and dissing the company for their shitty marketing tactics. I didnt even say anything about your opinion on them. 

I get you've ridden the board, and I get that until I interacted with it I wont 'get' it. I literally never said I 'get' it :no_mouth:

Those seem to be the state-of-the VESC,as far as i can tell, but they are way out of my budget. If possible i want to about 80€ for a esc.


I`ve read that the the tunigy motors (>260) are decent and the "Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 5065-236kv " have a good price.
I`ll also get a the motor mount from the same brand, since i`m using some caliber trucks. https://hobbyking.com/de_de/motor-mount-5.html?wrh_pdp=1

About the motor/wheel pully, i thought about 3d-printing those, but i think will not work. Is there anything i have to look out for, quality wise or do i just buy some off ebay. 

With this all in mind, i think a 6sXp or 8sXp battery should be enough for me to get up to 30ish kmh, while having a good range per pack.

You can buy a cheap esc but what you get is what you pay for...60 for a non programmable esc with built in controller. Again they do ok and if in a budget id get one but they are not high powered at all

I have Hummie hubs on my current board and they always blow people minds when I accelerate past the belt drives. I believe any drive type these days is perfectly viable with them all having pros and cons. Belts are a pain to set up and maintain for newbies.

I reccomend saving a bit more money for quality parts. DIY will almost always end up being more expensive in the long run as you will end up modding/upgrading etc etc. 

If you can't afford the vescs already mentioned you can go for a flipsky unit which have been known to be reasonable value for money. They do have their limitations and i personally wouldn't go for anything lower. If you cheap out on speed controllers you will just put yourself and your wallet at risk.

In terms of a power output I don't really know. Nobody has gone and put them on a dyno to check the maximum power tolerances. There is quite a lot of variance in the motors depending on where the magnets were glued in the can on the latest generation. All of them have crazy power just some have more torque and others will have more speed. The problem is that it means nothing when people say that they have 10000000 KW of total power as you need the power delivery system to support it; even then you could potentially push the motor further and output more power for less of a sustained amount of time. There are no set standards for this power output with manufacturers so theoretically I could just say that I have 15kw max power of my motors (for 3 seconds****) am I lying? I do believe they are wound to about 77kv on average though but the stator width not particularly standard. 

I bought mine as a bit of a Yolo whilst waiting for my Carvon direct drives and now prefer using them because the centrax style wheels gives so much grip and comfort.

To get this thread a bit more on track again...

[quote="MonteToast, post:23, topic:89856"]

[/quote]
than your best bet is probalbly a flipsky 4.12, not the 4.20. you can get them around 50-60$.

The SK3 motors are very good, but not sensored. If you don´t mind to give your board a small push at start up, than that will work for you.

The hole pattern on 50xx motors are different from 63xx motors, so you need to get the right motor mounts for it and no the hobbyking motor mounts are not to recommend. they get lose very fast and that´s not a fun at all.

Last thing to the motor kV, if you fo 12s than better chose a lower kV like 150-190kV. 

If you use hw 4.12 vescs than the erpm limit is at 60 000. that means with 12s and 230kV you would probably sooner or later fry your esc.

if you interested in how to calculate all of that, you can have a look here:

That might be true, but as long as nobody can confirm that it´s really already integrated and working now flawless, I better don´t recommend the 4.20. Till now it´s just what they said to somebody what they will do. 

Maybe you want to order one 4.20 to figure out if the resistor change already implemented in the ones they ship at the moment? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye::stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye::stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

So guys, UPDATE. First of all, thanks for your help, i really appreciate it. Although this thread is kind of a mess ^^

If ordered the Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 5065-236kv, i got a great deal, only 47€.
Also i bought the FSESC and a remote.

My biggest concern right now is getting a cheap but not garbage motor mount. I thought about 3d-printing it until i got a good fit and getting it cnc`nd later. Same with the pullis, although i`m not sure if those need to be metal.

Also i`m using some 70mm wheels and i`m going to drill hole into them, new wheels just don`t fit my budget.

Using this calculator with my "setup", i got a top speed of 34 kmh with a 8s configuration.![image|458x500](upload://1dED3UYJFof7br2ZsufM0WDpyJF.png) 

I think this is plenty for my requirements and it`s cheaper for me to do a 8p setup. I hope this is gonna work. I still need a bms and charger though, do you guys have any recommendations ? If possible, i would like to use one of those e-bike/ laptop chargers. i think they are much more convenient.

With bms you need to decide if you want to use a charge only or a charge and discharge bms.

There are pluses and minuses in each of it. I would recommend to read up a bit about it in here. In short the main advantage of a charge only bms is that it’s small and you will not cut out with fully charged batteries. The main advantage of the discharge bms is that some of them have an integrated anti spark switch and a discharge protection.

To find a good bms you could look up the bestech side. The d140 is a good charge only bms.

Regarding pulleys, if your design is good, 3D printed wheel pulleys will work. Not for ever, but work. Just make sure you use bolts to hold the print good in place and stabilize everything.

I think i'm going into more details from now on and post more pictures of stuff i have done or arrived and also keep of to websites which helped me out a lot. So let's start here.
I did alot of digging to get the parts i wanted and biggest problem so far to get them 1. - Cheap and 2. cheaply shipping to germany. Stuff like motor mounts, batteries and BMSs. 
Also i wanted to cheap out on everything i can, without missing totally out on "quality". Thats why i decided to 3D-Print everything possible and if necessary get someone to cnc'it for me.

Since i haven't build anything yet, but i can still put a list of everything i ordered here for now:

**Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 5065-236kv Brushless Outrunner Motor**

I i ordered this on 11 of april. I don't now when it will arrive, it doesn't have a tracking number :(.
I bought it mostly, because those sk3 got a good reputation on this forum, furthermore i got a good deal IMO on Hobbyking for them. At the time of buying they cost **46€**. The KV is more that sufficient for my needs, the area near me is mostly flat land, so i don't need a ton or torque.

![image|148x142](upload://a8s3cGH4g9k9Sr09EWhCSynSszY.png) 
I got this remote, its cheap 18€. The cheapest i could find. Altough i don't now i breaking with this works, if not, i might buy or build a new one down the line, but i think i'm confident enough to break the regular way.

:joy: Funny story, i want to 3D build and print everything, but don't have the tools to measure my stuff. So i bought a caliper

At NKON.nl i bought 32 **Samsung INR18650-25R 2500mAh - 20A** At first i wanted to build a 8s4p battery, but i decided against it. Building everything  10s make it much easier when it comes to BMS and charger. That means i now have 2 spare batteries. It's something. Price: **91€.**

Speaking of BMS and charger i bought this generic 10s bms and 42v 2a charger. I don't now how long  it will take to charge, but i now it will be a long time, maybe 7-8h ? Maybe you can tell me :) Again it was cheap, almost half the price of a 4A charger.
![image|500x266](upload://qZgKf3x42hNwRySciNq9ZfUzLwG.png)  Price as seen.

For now the small stuff.
nickel-strip to weld the batteries together. Hopefully 1m is enough- Price: 4€
3 pairs of XT90 connectors. One as a fuse, one between the bms and esc and one spare - 9€
5 "Strip Link Fuse Auto - 60A" on is going into a XT90 - 1,60€ + 3€ shipping - uff
3m of 12awg cable - 10€
A XLR 187 connector for connecting the charger to the battery - 5€ with shipping
Belt- HTD-5M, 15mm wide, 260mm long, 52 teeth - 2 of them for 12€

I hope this is everything i need for now, pls point out if something crucial is missing. Thanks.

Now to the 3D stuff, for the most part i'm using Cinema 4D for all the modeling. When it comes to 3d printing i'm less than a novice and have absolutely no idea how this works. Luckily i have a workshop for 3d printing this week. :sweat_smile:

Thats what i got for now. I modeled the the wheels and board, which is an old arbor board from '16. The wheels are pretty accurate, i think. i need those to build my wheel pully.

As you may have noticed i use caliber II 50° trucks, which i discovered i widely used here, lucky me.

That's the clamp and motor mount i came up with. Obviously this design is new and is very inspired from this platform, thanks guys. The base of both pullies are base of a website which sell those thing and have cad file for download available: www.maedler.de/ The motorpully is still unfinished, since i don't really now the dimension of the motor.

The blue thing in the pictures up above is representative my battery case, which is just a curved plate  for now, until i have decided on a design. It pretty hard to build the stuff when you don't have them on hand an can measure them. :frowning:

I forget to mention i ordered the FSESC 4.12. ( Price:) It seems i haven`t. _**UFF**_

Here is a website I am working on.  It is meant to be a portal to a variety of ESK8 Vendors. it is currently under construction so many features don't work but the homepage works well. 

http://www.esk8nexus.com/

Eventually, I am going to try and create a Board Builder, kind of like PC part picker but for esk8.

can this be done in an HTTPS format? I deffently LOVE the idea of a portal but without it being in HTTPS its not secure.
