My solution to living in off campus apartments and avoiding the bus: **The Electric Sportster**!
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/6/e60fbf0f3f2326581bebb402c3c382ebc39c37b3.jpg" width="690" height="458">

**First Person POV**
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD0QR2goP6s
Here is a first person point of view of using the Electric Sportster.
In the first run, I'm using just the throttle to accelerate and control my speed, finally braking at the end of the path. After turning the board around, I don't press anything on the remote and kick start. Then, I activate "Cruise Control with Braking" which applies propulsion and braking in order to maintain speed. I then use the throttle to gain speed, which deactivates cruise control mode. This drops power from whatever it was using to maintain my speed as the throttle moves from 0% up to the power defined by the throttle. Then I activate "Cruise Control with Braking Disabled" which allows the board to increase speed either by kicking like in the video or when going downhill. However, when kicking to increase speed, it is better to release cruise control and reactivate after kicking to the speed you want.

**Performance Demo**
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ildh3-Jnsrs
Here is a demo of the acceleration, speed, and hill-climbing capabilities of the Electric Sportster. 
I was not using full throttle in any of these tests however because I'm still inexperienced with the amount of power the motors are capable of, so all the demos were done within my comfort levels rather than at the maximum capabilities of the board.

**The Build**

After first removing the existing griptape from the deck, I drilled holes just big enough for a press fit of the T-Nuts into the top of the deck and used the enclosure bolts and washers to fully install the T-Nuts. Here is a more in-depth explanation of how to install T-Nuts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVfkxJiqLkA (YT: Installing T-Nuts In Wood | Fasteners101)

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/2/e2ea72b6a63d8e5ded75c879ddea6dd308b180e9.jpg" width="332" height="500">
To replace the griptape, I used non-abrasive griptape from DKL Skateboarding to avoid any more damage to shoes and pants that come from regular griptape.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/7/f75aabccace07d62e8b897d3a38ece82c1493b34.jpg" width="332" height="500">
Here is my attempt at recreating the original griptape pattern that came with the board. Because the sheet of DKL griptape was not as wide as the board, I decided to include a gap in the center so the griptape could reach all the way across the board.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/f/3f39e3fe3e04e7f1a1af073b3b57d99ad2fd2033.jpg" width="357" height="500">
The battery I chose was the 12s2p battery from .
In order to fully utilize the high torque of my motors, I needed to use a high voltage, which is why I decided to get a battery with 12 cells in series over 6 cells. The battery from  also came with an enclosure, which meant I didn't have to make that myself.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/8/3877692ec90619ec7edb27bdc33dc7b306d33ab2.jpg" width="320" height="500">
The battery includes an XT90 connector, 2 USB charging ports for devices like cell phones or the Shredlights, an on-off switch, and a charging port.
Sadly, I discovered that when going over sharp bumps that hit the bottom of my board, the switch gets hit and the board shuts off, and the charging port cover has been broken off. When I am more able to make my own enclosure, I plan on getting a 12s2p Stealth Pack from Miami Electric Boards and installing a charging port and on-off switch on the side of the board, leaving the bottom completely flat.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/0/40b1ad9db69bb04fb0786a76236bf998c90a67e4.jpg" width="690" height="496">
Here is the enclosure for the battery and electronics. I hot glued 2 nuts on the bottom of the battery so that the charging port doesn't get stuck beneath the top of the enclosure, inaccessible to the charger.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/8/8843cd8ebc6797a092107df6876bd2010ef5ffba.jpg" width="642" height="500">
The enclosure came with velcro straps and rubber tubing to better weatherproof the battery and electronics inside.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/f/ff37b08564b359d8453b2224968eb921a868d87c.jpg" width="690" height="458">
Here is the battery installed into the enclosure and secured with the straps.

With the leftover space I could just snugly fit the 2 VESCs that control the motors along with the RC receiver.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/4/447f7f6ebfc6c2831de36404d1f23fb4b85a1532.jpg" width="690" height="458">
I drilled 2 additional holes in the enclosure so the VESC Sensor Wires could also get through to the motors.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/a/dadbc016615714415d7d0b676dec9e74af79675f.jpg" width="690" height="458">
The motor setup I am using is a dual hub motor drive with 90mm wheels. The motor is rated at 75kv, which handles inclines better than the higher kv version also available, meant for 6s batteries.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/4/74b1683a0a401c1239c1aa8c6abef6a977513eed.jpg" width="690" height="458">
I applied Loctite onto the bolts, however some did end up getting applied to the inside of the hole for the bolt before it reached the threaded part, so I put a little extra just in case.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/5/758b1c0d789d141d407c57ed05c0110df3f9af23.jpg" width="690" height="458">
I also applied Loctite to the bolts that secure the motor onto the trucks.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/2/e26ee9182ea480f297fa3f3b005b1678b75e93af.jpg" width="690" height="458">
I used the 1/4" shock pads between the baseplate of the trucks and the board because the slot is actually a little too narrow to slide the baseplate all the way against the deck. However, it does fit just fine with the 1/4" shock pads. I also installed 3/16" shockpads beneath the board with washers to absorb shock during a bumpy ride.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/3/d375bece49a0289b8062f3c672cc9a5bcf394f4b.jpg" width="690" height="458">
Here is the battery enclosure installed with the large bolts, which also have Loctite applied for more security.

If the motors go backwards when you push the throttle to go forward, just swap any 2 phase wires and run the detection with the BLDC tool again.

With the front and rear Shredlights installed, the build is complete!

The clearance isn't too bad. Just need to work on an enclosure for those excess wires now...

Hey I saw your post on reddit. Great job man, it's sleek and great looking!

You should probably just cut the wires and resolder the connectors so they fit better with your setup. Are the front trucks narrower than the hubs? Or is that an optical illusion.

Yeah Dexters hubs are significantly wider than normal wheels, I'd say at least a 1/2 inch on either side. It's definitely noticeable but doesn't seem to have remarkable downsides.

Great job on the build by the way! I love Bustin decks.

Do you get any wheelbite issues? Planning a sportster build myself with Kegels.
I also got the torqueboards 12s2p. The casing is said to be 8.3" which when I tried to model it in cad, was too wide for the deck at the middle. Can you confirm the width of the TB case?

No wheelbite, and the 12s2p enclosure should fit width-wise. The only issue is that you have to really press down on the edges to secure the enclosure because of the concave of the board.

Cool, I'm after my first build and I like those hubs from @diyeboard

I need it to commute between home/train/office so urban scenario (good pavement but many dumps, hope to be able to sort them out), not very hilly thought .

Did you get a kit from the website? This one is a bargain, not sure if its the same you have: http://www.diyeboard.com/dual-hub-motor-9052mm-1000w75kv-power-truck-front-truck-kit-p-558.html

Then I will face same issue than you about sensor wires, I have a couple of FOXBOXes on their way to Spain.

The only worry would be the ground clearance (for the batteries) and board clearance (for the motors if you're not reverse mounting them) if you're making it with the trucks mounted drop-through. And just make sure your trucks are long enough if you're trying dual 6374.

I may or may not actually go dual 6374. I may go dual 6355. Either way, I would like to know how limited I may be. If I go dual rear 6374 I will go with the Torqueboards 218mm trucks. 

What are the pros and cons to rear (reverse) mounting the motors?

The main con is that the motors are more exposed and can be damaged easily. The pro is that you have more flexibility in what kind of deck you can choose

I'd really recommend getting your sensor wires setup properly it helps a ton with startup torque and smoothness. Also don't run them in Sensored mode only make sure to do Hybrid mode because hub motors are crazy inefficient in Sensored mode at high speeds.

Hi great built. I am also planning to buy the hubs from diyeboard and connect them with a 4.12 VESC. Do you still recommend them?
Do they come with the 4mm connectors?
Did you find a way to connect the sensor cable?
Sorry for all the question but I didn't find that many threads with similar configuration I am looking for.
