So close to finishing this build.
Been working on it for couples months now whenever I have the time too.
You can see in my recent post I had a problem with my first enclosure being not tall enough. Eventually got another one that‚Äôs taller and everything fits. 
Here‚Äôs the parts 

Motor: 149kv Sk3

Gears: 72/16 @Idea

Mounts: @Rithblu

Wheels: 8‚Äù MBS 

Trucks: Matrix (old style)

Deck: some random amazon deck 

Battery: 12s6p 30q Samsung 

Esc: Focbox (first time user with focbox been using 4.12 vesc)

Bms: 12s charge only @thisguyhere
 
Switch: @Martinsp

 Further parts adding: ![image|666x500](upload://ly9EL6rwhHywaUK7fEWxcHgRqMY.jpeg) Heatsink for dual focbox from @Rithblu, Bluetooth module and some free binds I think there called. 

So the problem lol üòÇ 
Easily fixable I believe, just need to hit the hardware store and get some 12mm speed washer to space out the flywheel away from the mount as there are touching

Another question: 
I‚Äôm use to building boards but not to much of embt. On the vesc tools I was thinking of putting these settings, I know it‚Äôll work for a regular Esk8 but for a emtb will theses settings still be fine. What you guys think 

Motor max: 60
Motor min: -60
Batt Max 50 (each focbox is 25a)
Batt Min -12 (each focbox is -6a)

Will this do ? Was thinking maybe lowering the Motor Max

Update:
 Here are some videos 
I‚Äôm the one in the red helmet 
Purple helmet is my friend
Just waiting to receive my crossbars that @Rithblu already sent me so I can install them and post some dope ass photos for y‚Äôall before I mark topic as complete. Will be adding @Rithblu dualfocbox heatsink later on, right now I just want to ride and enjoy it for a bit before I add anything more. 
Thank you to everyone and this forum. Without everyone here I couldn‚Äôt have made my 4 builds this year üòä p.s today‚Äôs my birthday to 31 üò≥ lol 
But you guys are the awesome ones here üòé

On my 12s6p, my motor max is 60 and batt max 60 per esc. 

Test with ur current settings, if it feels stable, crank that shit up.

60a per esc üò≥ that‚Äôs your max you can do though right. But once I can get a hold of those space washers I‚Äôll be able to test the current settings I have. I‚Äôll keep post updated

Batt Max 25 (each focbox=50a)
Batt Min -6 (each focbox= -12a)
[/quote]

? how to understand that? It¬¥s what you have and what you plan to set later?

With the focbox and that extra heat sink you can easy run bat max 50a per focbox and bat min at -12a

if its not to much of a bother for you switch the motor mounts to the opposite side of the clamps this will give you more room, so it won't tough the gears, so no need for the spacers.

Freakin genius üò±

Right on for the tip I think it just might work. I‚Äôll keep you updated as well

Edit: tried doing what you said but my motor pulley to far on the side. My motor shaft not longer enough where the pulley and flywheel wheel will be lined up

I had one on an 8s setup not sure the voltage max was , I rebuild the board and upgraded the battery to 12s4p it was telling me it was 100% till this day so i put it on a desktop charger and it was really just a little above my cutoff.

@Rithblu  Here‚Äôs what volt meter says
![image|375x500](upload://hMwUcxrVG7xSUxW2gIoIJ2WKxic.jpeg) 
It was around 49v earlier before I finally fixed my problem üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
Only rode for about 15min but not to much since it‚Äôs dark af right now. This Friday I‚Äôll have more time with the board and hopefully everything‚Äôs runs ok. Also didn‚Äôt apply locktight lol so have to go back and do that. 
I wanna make sure everything is running ok before I confirm this topic as COMPLETE. Also here‚Äôs the measurement between each mount. Sorry didn‚Äôt have mm reader that long hopefully this helps.

```
Please check to make sure that your motor is close to center to the mounts as possible, because if your belt is to long the motor will be pulled back to far to use crossbar.

If your able check to see if you can fit 5/16 round crossbar in the mounting hole on the mounts.
