Hi, I've been wanting to make a nice compact portable build for a couple months now. I've final started getting some parts and understanding things a little better. Basically, I'm on the lighter side,  completely used to commuting with a penny board, fruit boots üòÅ, and regular skateboards. I do my commuting in the city, Philadelphia to be exact. So crazy speed is not a concern, but philly is actually very bike friendly so skating in the bike lanes has always been a norm. You can get around faster in the city on a board or bike than in a car during rush hours. 
Soooo, I have embarked on this journey using a new nickel board. I got 2 zippy 6s20c 3000mah batteries which I will be setting up in series. Waiting on the connectors to come in the mail now. I have a balance charger and was told charging them in parallel will be faster so I got an adaptor for that as well on the way. I found a $23 reciever/transmitter on ebay that is on the way. I found a little tray at the thrift store for $0.99 that fits PERFECT for my enclosure. It even has vent holes. 
I've made a little holder for the batteries with some of the anti explosion box I was given for my Samsung note 7. Used some frozen duct tape to get that to work, and used more of the box for dividers just for safety from rattling and bouncing. 
I drilled 2 holes in the board and enclosure and used screws and nuts to connect them. So just 2 nuts to take it off and put it on. I will probably get the thumb nuts or whatever they're called to make it easier to put on and take off. 
I may drill more holes depending on what things look like when my hub motors finally come in. They should be 75kv. I will also have dual vesc which I'm also waiting on.
I would like to add an antispark switch but I'm still searching for one. If I can add a little screen that says the charge level that would be great too.

Looks great! Should be fun, only thing I see is that 20c with 3000mah is only 60A continuous **if** those batteries actually can do 20c which Zippys have a reputation of overstating what they can actually perform if that makes sense. You could always run 2 more in series than put those 2 12s packs in parallel to solve this issue. However, if you plan on going very low speeds and not up many hills maybe you could manage to not draw more than 60A. However I am not an expert in this by any means so if anyone has anything else to add that would be great.

PS-Just out of curiosity what KV will your motors be?

Thanks, I had to ask really quick on the kv lol. But anyways, what is an example of low speeds for you? I want to be able to keep up with the bikes and other people on skateboards. This is my first build. And I just updated my post a bit with that info.

## \#5 Posted by: Smorto Posted at: 2017-02-08T16:59:59.406Z Reads: 752

```
Low speed should be around 10ish MPH. However, I do not know how many amps you will draw at that speed or any speed for that matter. I do know that it depends on a number of factors though. This could be completely wrong but I believe you running 12s should help you draw less amps but again I am not sure. I would defiantly wait for someone else opinion.

```
More voltage (so 12S = 44.4V 6S = 22.2V) will result in less current being drawn to generate a given amount of power. You will draw the most current when starting or going up hills, basically whenever motors have an increased load.

Power = Voltage * Current(Amps)

So a 44.4V nominal battery will draw half the current for a given power output when compared with a 22.2V nominal battery, all other things being equal.

Nice board,  do you have idea about the final weight?

And about the discharge, in my opinion people tend to exaggerate what is really needed for a board, if can do 60A great, if not, just limit to 30A, 15A each vesc

For exemple, my board the limit is 20A due to the battery limitation, but that is plenty for a fun ride and to climb 12% hills with no problem

Sure, if you live in San Francisco you need massive amounts of current/power to be able to climb in a decent speed

The hubs could want more current, but if where you live is mostly flat with few hills you are good

What really need power is acceleration, when you are at cruising even at higher speeds the power consumption is "low"

I miss the late 90's. Compared to today, its seem much less pretentious. Zach Attack.

I totally forgot the Nickel had a kicktail, that make turning so much better. Are you sure that cardboard is anti explosion? Seems more fire prone.

Maybe you can look into CLEVIS PINS as a mounting option and use weatherproof seal around the enclosure to reduce rattling

So, this picture got flagged in the no words posts but this was the aftermath of my second explosion during this build. Literally was showing off for one of my friends, brought the battery pack down the stairs, my button made contact and it blew part of my metal button apart. Bittersweet since the metal probably saved my skin, but the metal caused the problem in the first place... Be careful with lipo batteries guys

I got the hubs from Alex Tech on here along with the vescs. I believe I connected everything right but I can't get the wattage reader to say the correct battery percentage and I can't the wheels to move. I believe I binder the remote. I bought the cheapest remote I could find, along with a 3d printer thinking I could make a small case for it later.

What I did was I dismantled some old radio and desoldered and resoldered back on evertyting inside I could lay my soldering iron on. But before that check youtube - there is like a million tutorials on soldering there. There is no way you're bad at it, you just haven't had enough practice, and I'm sure that if you put your heart to it and do practice according to the rules from the tutorials you'll be a master (maestra?;)) in no time! :smile_cat:

I would recommend clamping the XT90 to keep it from moving and easier to work with. Then 'tin' the metal part which means to fill it with solder. I would do this by heating up the metal part with your iron from the bottom, then pushing your solder into the metal part so it melts and fills up. Then 'tin' your wire. Once you have that done, you need to melt the solder in the XT90 by putting your iron on the bottom once again. Then when it is liquid, push the wire into the melted solder and remove your iron and wait for it to harden. This step takes some practice and getting used to. This is how I do it and it works for me, though I am sure there are different ways.

I would also record a thinner solder as I find it easier to melt and work with.

Your battery monitor is reading wrong because it probably hasn't been set up correctly. Are there any buttons on the back of it? If so try holding one of them on start up and it should go into a programming mode where you tell it what type/how many cells you have. I can't tell from the pic what kind of meter it is.

Are your PPM wires going to the receiver going to the same channel (slot on the receiver)? It looks like they aren't.

You can try swapping them and the other wheel should spin if this is the case.

If that's the problem you want to make a y cable of sorts so that both ppm cables go to the same 3 pins on the receiver.

UPDATE: I finally have a working board. Thanks for all the help. Had to ditch a few things, resolder stuff at least 4 times. Probably the longest thing I had to work on for the project. I still have an altoids headlight that I made that I'll eventually put on there. Will reevaluate my battery meter. It was hard fitting everything into the small space, plus I lost the power cable to my good drill so I didn't put anymore holes in to house the meter. I also bought a little camera on hobbyking.com that I want to find a nice spot for. Of course an easier way to charge the batteries would be great in the future, and actually incorporating an easier to use power switch. It's not too difficult to open the enclosure for access to the stuff inside. Just use the skate tool to unscrew one side and slide it over. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/b/1b2d99e76afef918d6ebca9421b243d9045a00c0.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/1/511520c87f69988f8a5e943d860380fa0bafa8ed.jpg" width="690" height="340">

So I got the chance to take it out, but it wouldn't go at first. I think maybe it was too hot in my car so I kept it inside for a while before I tried it again. It worked again, but after about a minute of riding it, it stopped again. Lights stayed on each time the motors weren't moving. Gave it a break again, and it worked again. Not sure if it's over heating, or somethings loose. But I'll take it apart tonight to see what I can figure out

You could run it in 6s, no worries.  You might want to limit the VESC motor max setting first and see how that goes for you.  As far as running for a min and then not, It could be a million things.  SOunds like maybe a cold solder joint that expands when it gets hot and looses contact.  I would see if the VESC is still on when the cut-out occurs.

There's not a lot of real estate to a penny, so its never going to be incredibly stable.  You might look at getting a [Benchwheel](http://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/handheld-electric-remote) or [Enertion Nano-X](http://Enertion Nano-X) remote so you can put the board in 'cruise' mode.  You can read more about them here...

So, my boards acting really odd. Like the trigger isn't working but the side turning thing makes the wheels spin. I rebinded the controller since it kept blinking. After I did that it seems to have some issues.some times it'll go without hitting the throttle, and stop when I hit it. When I move it in the opposite direction it speeds ups. Very wierd. I never changed the vesc settings since it started working. I posted a video. https://youtu.be/RBiLbaeCYPI

So I've rechecked and tinkered since last time and attempted to run the batteries in parallel, but I couldn't actually get the motors to move like that. I messed around with the blcd tool and lowered it to 40amps from 60. It's still has a pretty jumpy start. Like I have to have sort of a rolling start but it still takes off from under me unless I'm super gentle on the throttle. Which settings should I mess with?

Fit them in there but as I tried to connect the battery, again, I fried my connectors and now I have to replace them... I wanted to do my endurance test tomorrow but now I have a bunch more wiring to do. At least the Soldering iron I bought seems to work better.

I've discovered the dremel tool. Now I have voltmeter access. I'm not sure if it's programmed right but it's easy enough to change the settings. Just wasn't sure what info to put in for volts. Whether it be 22.2 or 44.4.i managed to get just one wheel to work again so hopefully it's an easy fix

Not sure what happened but that was my most expensive thing to break so far...

@Sapphirinia You should probably wait till you get another Vesc, I have had customers who used one and burned the enamel inside the Hub. It's odd to see it short like that, they look a little wet? Perhaps dust.  It's definitely blown on the DRV, check for shorts on the phase wires.

It's possible that there was a short in a phase wires as I had to resoldered like 4 of them. U should just resoldered all of them. Definitely was not wet. A little dusty though from riding I assume. Not sure where to go from here. No more money to dump into it at this moment

So I finally bought another vesc and all the connections are different. The rc connections aren't soldered on. The motor connections are bigger and the battery connections are xt90 instead of xt60. What would be my best way to reconnect everything? I like how much thicker the cables are on the new one but want to do it the best possible way. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/a/4a6c85a1679f7c1df437d94597f576cd697ed34e.jpg" width="374" height="500">

Best way is to re-solder on the correct connectors, but your going to need a beefy iron to heat up these thick wires. Or you could make adapters but that would be messy and harder to fit in the enclosure.

What's going on in the bldc tool?  Did you do the calibration yet or mess with app/control settings?

Phase wire swapping will just reverse the motor direction it should move either way so long as they're connected even if one is loose the motor should jitter.  Would check battery cut off limits and do the calibration then check the app config assuming calibration works out.

When it fails calibration is the motor moving at all or is it totally motionless the whole time?

If the former I'd assume your connections are good and you just need to adjust the settings it starts off with for the calibration maybe (I'm not too experienced with that issue though since mine seemed to calibrate basically first shot, after removing load).  If it jitters but doesn't fully turn could either be one loose phase line or lack of power through the mosfets feeding it, if it turns but the calibration just fails I'd lean more towards it just being something in the config that needs to be set before running the calibration (not sure what though exactly, perhaps different BEMF coupling and integrator values but not sure where a good starting point is for those I just trusted it gave me the right info)

If the latter (no motion) would guess wiring or power settings on the battery cut offs.

I left my board sitting for about a week with the batteries hooked up and the Watt meter was lit the whole time and now 2 of the cells are dead. Can I still try to get the vesc settings to work with one battery until my order gets here? I really need to get this thing working again.

Thanks for your help. I'm working on fixing it right now. What I've noticed, is that when I manually spin each hub, one vibrates like usual both ways, but the other only vibrates if I spin it in one direction. Is anyone available to sort of walk me through what I'm trying? especially with the BLDC. I'm trying to change so much. I still have lights on both VESCs, receiver light is solid, not sure what's wrong. I'll resolder everything again if I have to but it seems like everything is hooked up properly. Also, I read about split servo connections needing one center wire cut. Mine is not like that and it worked properly before so any suggestions on that?

Ok, so now my controller isn't working. It powers on but it won't bind to the transmitter. I've changed the batteries and tried on 2 different transmitters. So then I took out the old big one and it bonded but it's got so many settings on it that I'm not sure how to get it to work normal. It was spazzing out the motor and I redid the settings multiple times until I gave up. Why would the controller randomly stop working right? It worked when I was testing it in the street, I packed it up and tried it the next day and it wasn't connecting. I thought it might be the motor but motor detection was fine. Ugh...

I tell you what went wrong. Your packs were extremely out of balance of each other and when you connected both packs the pack with higher voltage tried to balance out instantly with your lower voltage pack sending a ton of current through your balance wires. Thats probably what happened. Did you connect the xt60s first and let the packs balance between each other for a few minutes? Did you check voltage of each pack before hooking it up to a parallel board? :grinning:
You're lucky you didnt burn your place down. Parallel boards should not be used at all imo. It looks like you have a imax b6 charger and you dont gain anything by parallel charging your batteries with that low watt charger.

I didn't even turn it on at the point. Soon as I plugged in the 2nd one they start smoking. I've charged them that way once before. I did plug the xt60s in before the balance connectors. Thanks for letting me know what went wrong. Batteries are probably done now right?

I would check their internal resistance with a multimeter, they are probably fine just need new connectors.
If it was just a few seconds, I doubt there will be any noticeable damage to the cells themselves

Yeah, You should always check the pack voltage of each pack before plugging them into the parallel board. If they are way off you should charge the lower one up to the voltage of the higher one. If they are slightly off plugging in only the main connector and letting them sit like that for a few minutes should allow the packs to balance each other out and then you can connect the balance connectors. It was either that or you have a short somewhere in the parallel board.

Sorry for taking so long. I drew out the shape and cut it out of sheet steel manually. It took forever and I still had to make adjustments to get the right belt tension. I still want to just buy one of those cheap ebay motor mounts. There are sets with the belt, pulleys, and motor mounts for smaller wheels. I believe the set I got was for 70/73mm wheels. I got the one without the motor mount thinking it would be better to just make it custom. In retrospect, I believe it would've been easier to just cut out that notch on a premade mount. I basically used a hand saw, drill press, and dremel. It took me a few days to hack away into the right shape, then I epoxied it to the truck with the strongest kind. It won't budge now. I did a lot of the adjusting for the belt after I had already epoxied it and it never moved.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/b/ab39f6460f8e58840d12430c9b9fb011c75eea18.jpg" width="374" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/6/c677f1aa7199abe331856ddeff7c60b2bb5d0944.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/2/9208f2e1ecb7ec77d442f18227abf4933ee68991.jpg" width="326" height="500">

Random post, but I didn't know where to put it lol. In my broken-boardness, I went on a philly group ride and someone leg me use their inboard and boosted board. I hated the braking on the inboard so he let me use the boosted for the rest of the time. I definitely preferred it. One of the guys had a diy board but unfortunately, it kept stopping so he had to leave the group ride. It really opened my eyes to the security in knowing you have a dependable board. Like the price point is basically justified after seeing how much went into how it was put together. I still am anti-longboard because sharp turns were pretty much impossible for me, unlike my penny with a kick tail. But it does at least make me more interested in the pre-built ones. I'm no where near being able to afford one but I can't bash those guys much anymore for spending so much on their boards. 

My perfect board would probably be a combination of the two. Color and size of my penny, but with rock solid parts. I didn't like the way you had to hold down 2 separate things on the remotes to go, and with my braking difficulty I actually had the board fly behind me since I forgot it had reverse. Of course there was also the carefully planned charge breaks that I wouldn't deal with my board though. But I'm a vet and it was veterans day so we had a good time going to IHOP and getting my freebies lol.

Glad I finally got to do my first group ride, even if it wasn't on my board. I think it gave me some more motivation to get my board up and running again. I was seriously depressed about my board lol. Didn't want to look at it.

I shouldve started this post with "dear diary" haha üòÇ

I actually love the metroboard [shortboard](https://imgur.com/a/F6iQQ) and it's built like a tank; I can't see it ever breaking.  Especially with 107mm wheels on it :heart_eyes:  Tacking it around with the kicktails is a beautiful thing.  I often find myself taking this board out instead of a longboard if I'm not going too far.

Haha this is the same argument I use AGAINST pre-built boards. That guy probably walked home knowing it was one of X numbers of things that was wrong with it and can fix it before the day is over. Personally I'd rather go through that process than having to ship my board back to the manufacturer and be without it for a week or more. If the warranty would still be in effect, that is.

Pre-built definitely has a (big) place in ESK8, but unless I get a good deal it's just not for me.

Yeah, I also feel like that this is a subjective reasoning to come to this conclusion. Inn our group of 12 poeple +, there are 3 poeple who exlusively ride prebuilts, myself included. And so far none of us 3 had any issues. (some toock our boards to grouprides on their maidennn voyage, some belts where loos or a mount but overall diy have been super reliable in my experience.)

I ride mine daily, to commute to uni and back, twice per day. Total of 25-30km a day, around (20 days a month - 6 days cuz of weather) 385 km / month. ( not couting group rides, joy rides or late night meet ups) and the only issue I had once was a belt being to loose.

Still a work in progress but I wound up frying my dremel in the process of chopping up the board.
I was trying to cut handles too. That's where it sparked and died. I managed to get the weight down some.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/2/22a0ab3adec36f499400d4a1417e1ede0792aa83.jpg" width="374" height="500">

So, hypothetically, if I was to swap out the strong motor on the new board with my old one, what would happen? Like the max I hit while riding the new one during city nav was 17mph. I've hit 18mph on my penny nickel. Would I wind up with a longer battery life and lighter board that way? I'm pretty nervous to change something that's already working but I do have back issues, and my shoulder surgery was a year ago and not yet 100%

Well it depends on the power that the smaller motor has, but generally any motor over, say 1000 watts should get you to 18 mph, perhaps just not quickly. 

More important than power, however, is the battery voltage, motor KV, and gearing. If those are different one your small board and big board, then the speed will likely be different. If you post how many cells the battery is on each board, as well as the gearing and motor KV for each board, it'd be possible to calculate your new top speed if you switched motors.

I was told the new board setup should get me 26mph. I'm sure it does but I don't really need to hit that speed. 20 is probably my max, and only if I was on a well known bike path or something where I didn't have to worry about cars, rocks, cracks, etc. I'll have to ask on the specifics on the battery because it looks to be custom made. It's really heavy lol. I was also looking into lighter wheels. I really like the way these feel but in the future, like maybe tax time üòÇ getting something big and light possibly.

if you put a higher kv motor on it will go faster.  the rated power of the motor barely will effect speed.  power is decided by the battery first (if they can put out the amps and not get hot) and then what the esc is programmed to send to the motor next.  
kv decides torque and speed and the size of the motor will decide if it can sustain it.   

that is a nice looking deck

but if you had a really small motor then lets say on your full 10s or 12s battery going full speed on the bench lets say you hit 1000rpm, and on the road lets say youre only hitting 700, that would be because the motor is so small and if you increase the motor size but with same kv you could bump it up to getting closer to the 1000 rpm and that could be a big increase in speed.  typically you want a motor that will do about 85% of the no-load speed when in use, and that's an efficient place to be.    so motor size can effect speed even with the same kv.  ..but kv is the real decider.
and you'll get better range with the bigger motor.  more efficient in that it has less internal electrical resistance and also riding closer to that sweet spot of about 85% of whatever voltage is applied.

theres no music.  that's my old neighborhood and I lived all around west philly.  upenn you start and I've been over the bridge to Jersey on the side there, by bike.  thought you were going to go over south street bridge but you go a lot farther.  with no music and no nice camera with a gimbal its hard to watch but if you did those things, and choose the shots better I think, like looking more forward, because I keep twisting my neck to try to see where youre going, then could get through 20minutes happily.
that's pretty funny with the polish on the screws.  very girl I think!

It was -7¬∞F (-22¬∞C) the other day, it's 22¬∞F (-6¬∞C) right now and freezing trigger finger is a very, very, VERY real thing.  I have found that you have to wear a glove, of course, with the fingertip cut off, but then you put the whole gloved hand with remote in a pocket.  I hope your outer coat has big pockets.  I figured that out after, upon arrival, my finger was numb and blue one night for a lot longer than I was comfortable with...  If my pocket wasn't big enough, I would recommend putting a paper bag over your entire hand and tying it there

So, I couldn't sleep and decided to whip out my sewing machine and make a grip tape cover for my board. It's super awkward to hold still so I wanted to try doing that then using a strap, or holding it regular without scratching up my jacket.

Luckily the deck went under her moving car through the wheels so it didn't get run over. That's all the damage. Its a fiberglass layer that got peeled back and I can't squeeze it together. I definitely don't need any help breaking stuff lol. Just annoying because I spent $150 on the deck that I shouldn't have spent in the first place. Only rode it probably 4 times so far. I'll probably try to make a 3d printed bumper of some sort. Original Skateboards sells a special bumper for the deck but it doesn't fit after it's already been busted.

Well the most obvious part is battery life. They had boosted board, inboard, and wowgo. I could've done the whole thing on 1 charge but they needed to charge a few times. I could keep up with them fine but I'm more gentle on the throttle so they would pick up speed faster and when I got comfortable I'd go their speed. At one point t I had to tighten my truck since I started getting speed wobbles. I haven't taken the board past 18mph before that so I'm pretty sure we were hitting 25mph or so before I started tracking. We had some nice long stretches before that.

Good.  Gotta represent DIY.  Those boosted guys are always on the lookout for an outlet like a meth head looking for a fix.

Also, don't try keeping up with people - ride at your own pace, whatever you're comfortable with.  It's just not worth it - ride within your ability.

Almost every time I've crashed it was because I was trying to keep up with [whatever] or trying to rush because [reason].  I stopped doing that.  I recommend riding at your own pace NO MATTER WHAT.  If you're late, you're late, so what.  Better than tripping off the board.  Plus you always have to be vigilant of the cars {aka: death machines} because most people driving can't see people on {skateboard, bicycle, motorcycle, pedestrian}

Car driving becomes instinctual after a while and you stop consciously focusing on it.  People's bodies take over in autopilot mode and their brains are trained to pay attention to where the other cars are at.  Unless they are actively looking for pedestrians or skateboarders or people on bicycles or motorcycles (which they aren't because there is an urgent incoming text message) then you are effectively invisible to them unless you wear a car-sized helmet so their subconscious auto-detection system picks you up

So you have to treat every car like the driver cannot physically see you.  Because often they can't.  Even if you are lit up and in their line-of-sight.



*TL;DR: don't rush -- and treat every car like it's trying to kill you*

DON'T MIX GLUE WITH WATER!

i'm studying woodworking and carpentry and this is one of the most terrible mistakes i've ever made. you're basically watterlogging your longboard whilst also sealing it with glue, which is too thin to really glue anyhting by now. the water will get trapped inside and delaminate your whole deck if you do this.

to get the effect @korralle describes you can use high viscosity resin.

If it is normal good old fashioned white wood glue, it's water based. It doesn't make any difference to the gluing capability if you dilute it with a litte water. I didnt say water it down until theres no glue left. So youre not waterlogging anything. How do you think the water thats normally in the glue gets out? It can dissipate through wood and the glue itself. You studying woodworking makes me a little sceptical tbh :smiley:

A month or two ago a self pressed pintail started delaminating in the rear. A clasmate suggested to dilute the glue with water for the same reason/result (5 parts glue 1 part water.) 
 In the end it did help a little to get it into the cracks, but because the glue on the outside (more exposed to air) dried quicker than the glue on the inside it trapped the moisture inside of the board. 

End result: The tip of the tail held strong, but the the bit behind the tail showed signs of delamination.

Also, my teacher told me that he prefers epoxy resin over regular wood glue for glueing pieces that already have lacquer on it because of the moisture.

So, the insurance company is writing me a check to replace the board. I'm not sure whether I should get the same one or the slightly drop deck version. I'm using 150mm wheels this time around. Help me decide. Oh, and I will be getting the bumpers in purple. I have to do a new enclosure anyway so I was thinking split fiberglass one. Originally I had the 34" because well smaller equals lighter. But I really loved the 37" because it looked cooler. I wound up not getting it because it was so much more expensive. Now I'm not sure if the slight size difference would matter, plus I don't think the split enclosure would fit right on the 34". Then again, I could still make it a single enclosure lol.

I'm just going to replace it. I'd rather set it up better this time. I want the bumpers so it doesn't happen again. They're a really tight fit. Also, its not just wood that's separated. It's also the fiberglass. You can see it if you zoom in. I just don't think it'll keep the same quality over time with it split like that. I've gotten less than a month out of it and was hoping to ride it for a long time. Especially since they're supposed to be basically indestructible. They've been run over by trucks on youtube. I don't want to have to worry about it later

Sooo, because I'm accident prone, I managed to get this board to stop working too. I'm hoping I can fix it. The voltmeter seems to still be accurate so I don't think it's the batteries, the vesc is lighting up and powering the rx so I think that's fine, the tx/rx seem to be fine since it's a solid light. Only thing that's left is the motor and I'm not sure how to test it. Please help.

I rode it while it was wet outside but I was told the motors are naturally water proof...

Check your motor phase wire connections and make sure they haven't come undone. If those look good, unplug the motor phase wires and touch two of them together. You should feel cogging and resistance when you do that. If that's all good, it should eliminate the motor as the source of the problem. Next would be to plug in the VESC to the computer and check for fault codes. And make sure your battery voltage isn't so low that it dropped past the battery cutoff voltage level.

Oh yeah, and make sure all your electronics are  bone dry first. Hair dryer works well.

Hall sensors maybe, try it with those unplugged.  I had a motor's hall sensors go bad from brine corrosion while the motor itself still worked fine

Batteries at 90%. I didn't get very far lol. I geuss I'll cut the shielding off to see what it looks like inside. ![20180212_210853|374x500](upload://grVkGpWyFJr5S1tjPiEE6bMv9Jq.jpg)

Try what @Mobutusan suggested then

Make sure touching motor leads 1&2 together makes the motor hard to turn and choppy
Make sure touching motor leads 2&3 together makes the motor hard to turn and choppy
Make sure touching motor leads 1&3 together makes the motor hard to turn and choppy
Make sure touching motor leads 1&2&3 together makes the motor **really** hard to turn and **smooth**
Make sure touching no motor leads together makes the motor easy to turn, just barely magnet indents you can feel a little

Yay, I wasn't connected all the way inside the shielding. There's a pretty cool 3 prong connector in there. It's fixed

Are there any tricks to keeping this together? Especially now that I had to cut the shielding off? ![20180212_212238|374x500](upload://6S8iJdEVTXFgvgnL6biLoQ1DEM2.jpg)

I put tape or heatshrink over my bullets to keep them form coming apart.

If not, you could use some thin nylon string and tie the connections together.

Glad it was something simple. If you have shrink tubing that's almost big enough you can widen it by putting some needle nose pliers through it and pulling the handles apart to stretch it out.

So I think my inboard friend is in denial. We were riding together when I thought my board had water damage (which it didn't) he kept saying his board was fine in the water. So... Now he's saying he can't get the battery in and it's sparking when he tries to put it back in the board. But he insists that it's not from the rain and puddles... Also said inboard told him it was water damage but he says it can't possibly be. Hmm...

So what type of clear coat should I use on my enclosure to go over my stickers and seal them on? Speaker is almost done :slight_smile:

I told @Deckoz I was stealing his speaker idea, and through lots of stuff working then breaking, here's my version. I was a bit heavy handed with the hot glue. I'll clean it up later. I used a slide on slide off design and the bottom is secured to the board. ![20180313_102023|690x431](upload://gYbBxxS8OTvg3QyKa6VqsFR9OMA.jpg)

I like it. I have some more tweaks I've thought of while having it sit in my car next to me lol. I'll probably reprint it so it looks more professional.

Testing out with some BTS. I think it sounds good. I definitely want to reprint it though to make it neater. I had to take it apart a few times. I'm thinking about coating the black in rubber paint too.

Hey guys, some updates. The board has had its ups and downs. I gave up on it for a while. The vesc wound up frying on this one as well. But I did recently get a focbox and installed it. I was getting sparks whenever I plugged in the charger so I recently got a replacement input that soon I'll be installing. Lastly, after I had everything working in bldc, the motors moving properly when I controlled it with the arrows in my laptop, magically the remote no longer wanted to control the motors ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I tried switching the receiver plug slots as many ways as I could think of and still a no go so I finally ordered another gtb2 to take apart and put into the case.

 I've also been working on making some gummie knock off wheels using nylon filament on my 3d printer. That's been a bit of trial and error. The design is solid but printing accurately is tricky. I bought a polyurethane mix but it wound up being too hard.

My speakers are becoming pretty dependable and I'm fairly sure the final design is done. Just gotta work on securing the innards better... Cuz vibration. I really like how they came out though. 

In other news, I wound up moving to Ohio in an attempt at saving money as I was evicted from my home in New Jersey. Things are going a lot better now that I'm out here. More time for creating and less time for stressing. 

I'm really hoping to get some skating in soon but the Temps have been brutally cold. Like 4¬∞ F. I remember my board not responding too great back in philly due to frigid Temps.

Anyways, thanks for reading. I miss the community and riding. Still have a bunch of back pain but I don't like taking the fun out of my life due to injuries.
