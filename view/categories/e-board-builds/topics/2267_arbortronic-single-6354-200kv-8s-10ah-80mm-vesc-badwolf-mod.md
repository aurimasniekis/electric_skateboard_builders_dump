Hello Guys

I am Micha, a 19 years old student from Germany. I live close to stuttgart. (Perhaps someone of you was already there) 
When i first i discovered E-Boarding, and a few hours laters this Forum, i was blown away as i saw all of these awesome custom boards. After a month of intensively reading i decided to build my own awesome board. 
I will use the board to travel to school (around 7 km one way) ,work (around 5 km), and everything within the 15-20km Range. I think/hope its going to be exhilarating!

So these are the parts im using:

* Arbor Fish Bamboo Deck
* Caliber 2 Trucks
* Orange Kegels 80mm
* C6354 200Kv 
* Motor mount from esk8.de 
* VESC also from es8.de 
* 8s 10Ah 25C flattened Li-Po Pack with Antispark, Powerswitch and BMS
* 32T/14T Gearing
* Bad Wolf GT2B Mod
* 2 part ABS cover for battery
* 1/4" Riser Pads 
* and some nice bearings

Total Cost around 1000,- â‚¬

Everything is here except for the Battery and the motor pulley. (should arrive next week) 
I wonder if someone rides a similar Setup (Single 6354 200Kv, 8s 10Ah, 32/14T, 80mm, VESC) and could tell me some reallife testing values like Vmax and Range. 

And maybe someone has a good idea for a enclosure just for the vesc and the 2,4Ghz receiver. 

I will keep you guys updated!
I was going to upload 10 fresh pics but unfortunely i am only allowed to upload one because i am a new user :(
I think Jason has the power to give me those rights, if he would do that, i could post more pics which would be awesome.
Anyway here is one pic.

I think it will be a pretty sweet ride once its finished but let me know what you think! 

Greets from Germany!

Here is the updated board.

The topspeed is around 40 km/h. Range about 35km on a 30km/h average. 
So its awesome and the Single Motor drags me on top of every hill. 
**Its** **exhilarating!**

Nice - the flat build makes it look super cool.
What do you mean by flattened by Lipo - did you just cut it open and lay the single cells out flat - was that hard? Which battery did you use exactly and what BMS? What charger are you using?

Hey, thanks.
I just bought the 8s 10ah pack from AlienPowerSystem. 
It already comes flattened and with
* BMS
* charging slot
* powerbutton
* voltage display
* heathshrink 
* 4.5 amp Charger

But if you want to do it yourself here is a post of someone who already did it.
