While i'm waiting for parts, here's the build log.

![image|690x208](upload://9BpKDAj9sYZlTL4bzCkG3jgZ7ur.png) 

Each slot of the Haya will house 12S2P 18650's. All the connections including battery sense wires are done through the pcb. Both packs will have a 40A fuse, the tracks of the pcb are designed for a 30A continuous with a 10 degree temperature rise.

The BMS is discharge circuit is by-passed from the high current path. However, it's discharge circuit can control the Unity switch . Meaning if the BMs detects an undervoltage fault, it is able to shutdown the Unity via the switch.

closer look at all the connectors
![image|690x448](upload://12KLZwVYhjcnzNSuxbkVztGzS3N.png) 

connector for the charge port, with onboard fuse
connector for the bms
input connector for the switch, output connector to the Unity
input connector for the CAN bus, the output connector is alllll the way at the other end of the pcb

![image|330x500](upload://AozLKVQ9y8f2yaeYcP5MfsiDgq.png) 

Another interesting thing with the CAN bus, i've connected both 5V of each Unity together with an inline 5 Ohm resistor, this will allow me to turn on both Unity's with a single switch.

Thats a dam good idea. I guess even a super cheep low current BMS could be used to do this.

It would be great to have a small pcb that could be put inline with the switch cable that has just this circuitry on it.

Well done @Blasto , the PCB idea is really great, did you find somewhere that make these large boards cheap?

And looking forward to see what effect the under board lights give, lots of times I thought about incorporating a light strip embedded on the bottom in a channel filled with epoxy, but is was too much work, you may change my mind

Yeah i got the pcb from pcbway, a little over 300$ for 10 pieces ship incl. Pretty dam cheap for a pcb that size.

I should be able to test the leds on the deck by the end of the week, i'll have to admit i'm a bit afraid that the thickness of the deck will collimate the light and not get the wanted spread... but whatever, we're having fun aren't we?

That's basically free

You could fill the hole with epoxy and sand it to get a frosted look that would diffuse the light

I was looking at the specs of the light bar, it is powered directly by the battery? That's one road block I stumped on mine, using a 60 led/m strip I would need another DC/DC converter just for the leds

[Light bar used](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/seoul-semiconductor-inc/SMJF-LF08C00-XX/897-1233-ND/4696192) , directly battery powered, the foward voltage of the strip is 48V (measured with DMM) the lights become dim as hell when around 41-40V... but for the simplicity of the circuit, i did not care. I've also added a little 15ohm 4W ballast resistor for when the battery are fully charged (50.2V)

I was contemplating on reworking the LED strip in to a 24V operational voltage, normally it's 8 LED in series, i would have changed it up to 4 // 4. But didn't do that, just used as is.

now that I think about it... I should just of  removed one LED out of the circuit, making the forward voltage 42V, that would have covered my entire voltage span with minimal dimming....  oh well, already made 8 holes, not going back

I been using PCBway recently and i must say that i have been impressed with both quality and turn around time.

a few questions . . . 
what thickness copper did you go with for these boards?

have you used these cheep BMS before?
are they any good?

in your system do the 2 sides run interdependent? is the main power from one half connected to the other?

2 oz copper, no i haven't used this bms before, i am already a bit disappointed by it, it has no balance circuit... oh well it will be good for charging and cell monitoring

yes i was planning on paralleling up the two 12S2P packs, that way i can use only one charge port... but i could just has easily run them independently, but would require 2 charge ports.

What about one charge port but connected to each battery with a diode? This way they will still be isolated and no current will flow between them, using a 0.3v drop diode should be no problem

i will be interested to see how this works out. I have a similar setup in my build where i have a 12s battery pack in an enclosure and i have 3 of them in parallel. in my last build i had to join all the balance points between all of the different packs and one big bms, but it means lots of cables between separate enclosures. I had been considering separate bms in each enclosure and just running power and charge to each enclosure but was concerned that something weird might happen.

im this close |------| to trying to make my own bms. but i already have so many projects on the go :frowning:

Can u spotweld to an PCB? Never thought about that...

[/quote]


yeah you can, need to adjust your spot welder settings and make sure the pcb is able to handle the current, but it can be done.

[quote="M.Hboards, post:55, topic:81220"]
Secondly can you explain how you got the leds hook up to the nanox‚Äôs second channel.

![image|690x423](upload://vxFDoZTivmL2LuMOj5m5XPkevix.png)  

second channel is driving an opto-coupler, on the nano-x the channel 2 is toggled by holding down the button near the pinky finger for 5 seconds.

i took the receiver out of it's enclosure and directly soldered it to the pcb, reason why i added another output for channel 1. the pcb is the same size as the receiver

A indoor 4WD drive burnout is perfect

Now  seriously, I'm really looking forward to some telemetry data, to see  if the consumption is better with 4 hubs, probably not, only if you halve the current to each

+1 curious about your motor temps and wh/mi consumption. I just did a twin peaks run (tallest point in SF) and I had to stop twice to let my hubs cool down. I was really considering doing 4wd so I can (theoretically) split the heat.

## \#86 Posted by: bevilacqua Posted at: 2019-03-31T21:04:51.045Z Reads: 234

```
Since the losses are proportional to the square of the current (which would be halved), the motor-temp would improve quite a bit. 

In theory also the wh/km, but I'm not so sure in that regard, as there are some more factors to take into account when calculating energy consumption.

Quick PSA for those wanting todo the same 4wd topology (via CAN, connecting both 5V supplies with inline resistor)

The little 5ohm resistor was too small of a value, i now cranked that value up to 20-25 ohm

![image|690x248](upload://gNw6NqmoRzl5kijcJJcJSbZ6q74.jpeg)

Also @Deodand should be releasing the official fw cery soon with the CAN shutdown command
