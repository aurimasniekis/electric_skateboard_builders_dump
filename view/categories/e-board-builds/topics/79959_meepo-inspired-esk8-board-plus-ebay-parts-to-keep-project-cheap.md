So after lots of research into this topic while procrastinating and not doing things for school etc
I have finally come up with a list of parts that I will hopefully be purchasing late March

My main goal for this board is to be CHEAP AS CHIPS
Therefore i don't need to be going at flaming high speeds... although 30kph would be awesome!
Plus range isn't that big a deal either, The longest distance i would need to travel is about 18 Km (10 miles)
Which is a two way trip from one location...

Here is a parts list (and please help if i am missing something or if certain parts don't go well together, even though i am getting the Trucks and the motor mount with pulleys all pre assembled) If someone has a potentially cheaper or equal quality list of parts that will match this motor or another suggested one and includes links to  everything i need eg: pulleys, hardware, wheels trucks etc that would be great and maybe better so i can assemble it myself.

but this is what i have so far:

Black Grip Tape Mob 9" x 33" - $8
https://www.kickpush.com.au/mob-skateboard-grip-tape-sheet-9-x-33-black-perfor 

I've been trying to keep everything I buy to just a couple of sources to keep shipping cost down.
I also have 2 3D printers and they are pretty large, so i could print the enclosures 

All up thats $530 roughly and $750 AUD ($600 without this deck/Cheaper deck) probably more so i really need to cut corners somewhere to get the price down so any help will be awesome

pretty expensive when i don't have a job and need to split $900 between a nother project for school and this (This is just for fun and a "conveniently" useful project for the commute to and from)

I think you can save money if you buy a cheaper deck, I'm sure for 100$ you can find the same style of deck.

And why you want a belt motor system?

Ownboard is selling a complete kit without a deck for just 372$, the esc is so smooth, battery is good (the same as meepo) and alluminium enclosures.

Yeah that was just a place holder, I'd be happy with the same style $20 30" board from kmart which comes with trucks. so i can use that to practice until i get all the parts...

I have bought the kit and it's awesome.
I have made my own 10S4P with samsung 30Q cells and get a range of 30-40km.
I have had no issues so far (I have ridden around 1000km until now) and the hub motors are just awesome.
