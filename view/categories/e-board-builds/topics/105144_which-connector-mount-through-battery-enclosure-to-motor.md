Hi all,

I'm looking for a good connector what is going through the battery enclosure to the motor.
The kind what i can mount on the enclosure.
For example GX20-3 connector.

I want to run a 12s8p battery with 2 x 6384 190KV 4000W motor.

I'm curious what you people using and what is the best for this.

Thanks in advance.
