Here I am again, starting another build. While waiting in the motors from China to finish up the Jet Potato, and a rear truck solution for the Icarus drivetrain. I've decided that I want to build a full MTB, with an already strong arsenal of street boards that are completed or soon to be completed. Watching @DanSkates and @rich jumping stuff and taking it outside the norm. I present... The plans of the Day Walker.  

I originally was going to use an MBS Pro 90, but as it is discontinued I will be starting with a 14ply Trampa HS11 as the base. So let's get to it. I will add pictures as things start arriving.

- **Deck:** Trampa Holy Pro

- **Front Truck:** Trampa Ultimate White w/ Blue text Baseplate, 16" Vertigo ATB Hangar, White Springs, 75A Dampas, @Nowind Duffman Spacers

- **Rear Truck:** Trampa Ultimate White W/ Blue textBaseplate, 16" Infinity Hangar Milled by @Nowind, White Springs, 75A Dampas

- **Foot Straps:** MBS F5 Pro Straps & F5 Heel Straps

- **Motors:** Alien Power Systems 6384 170Kv

- **Drivetrain:** @Nowind Mini Direct Drive 4:1 Blue, Encoder Mounts, and Helical Gears

- **Wheels:** Superstar Rims White with blue text, anodized blue spokes, 8" Trampa Mudders or 6.5" Urban Treads

- **Speed Controllers:** Enertion Focbox, with @Kug3lis Dual Finned Case, and MTB mount.

- **Battery:** 12S6P Samsung 30Q

- **Remote:** TBD,, forgot to order it with the motors..

- **Bluetooth:** MetR module @rpasichnyk


UNDETERMINED
Battery Box: I like my builds to look good...so haven't decided what I want, but will definitely be top mounted... 

Really looking forward to stirring some mud..

Apart from stirring mud, you're certainly going to stir some interest with a build like that. Sounds very impressive. I'm keen to see this all start to unfold.

They may be a future upgrade. I'm a feather weight. Should I deem the superstars unfit... Your wheels would be the first I go to. But for now..we're already talking about an expensive build :) so we'll see after I beat on it..

14ply Trampa HS11 as the base
[/quote]

Have you bought your deck yet?  I went with 16ply based on my weight 80-85kg (depending on how many pies I am or am not eating at the time! :smile:) and wish now I'd have gone with the max - 17ply as I bottom my board out regularly and it has some pretty gnarly war wounds.  I have to say it doesn't 'feel' too much like I'm bottoming out though, and landings are always soft.  However, I'd recommend thinking about going more plys as these things are so flexy and I personally believe if it's a bit stiffer then that's better.  

See my flex vid here for a 12 ply deck.  This would have been completely impossible to turn into an eMTB as it bottomed out just riding down small dirt slopes:

No I haven't gotten the deck yet... I'm only 58kg. When my buddy had a 14 ply street Carver I didn't even bend it.. though there was no jumping involved...

Maybe 15 then?

Oh wow - you are a carrying a bit less weight ;-)  

I'll let some of the other guys chip in to see what they recommend (@trampa) but I think if they did a 20ply deck I'd be quite intersested as I like the dampening of the flex but too much doesn't feel great for freestyle.  That said, my current level of flex feels beautiful for carving so I guess it's about getting the balanace.

If you've already been on a 14ply deck and it felt good then that'll probabaly be a good fit for you :blush:

Gotcha...I don't know what a Carver vs a hs11 would feel like but figured similar. I never jumped the board, or jumped on the board.. but standing on it normal, on either end or in the middle and bobbling didn't make it flex at all really.

Kiteboard decks have all been wood, so don't have much comparison knowledge for a full glass fiber deck for freestyle.

@trampa Frank what do you think? 58kg?

Just a question but how come you use kg for measurement? I thought you were in US

Well, it's very dificult to say which is the perfect ply for you, it also depends if you like flex or not (I like it).
I'm 74kg /11.6stones and have a 14ply carver and a 16ply holypro deck. The 14ply carver deck is like a trampoline, really flexy, maybe I would choose the 15ply now. The 16ply Holypro deck feels stiffer but has still a nice flex but I would choose a 15ply now. I like the pop of the deck to lift the board but of course too much flex is not good for jumping. 

If you like flex I think the 14ply could be a good choice, otherwise take the 15ply.

Sick! So funny these diverse opinions..
But I'm sure even the 20ply would even flex a little.....

I also think for big jumps a slightly stiffer deck would be better but for anything else I prefer more flex.

BTW I have a new trampa sticker but it makes no sense to attach it.

[/quote]

So, pelican cases or the like seems to be the go to.  I do know they make colored cases, which you tend to design boards that look good and have matching colors.  Possible to get a box that fits well with the rest of the colors of the board.   Some sort of custom enclosure would certainly look cool but the ruggedness of a case on a off-road board would really hold up to plenty of abuse.  

But I would love to see a rugged custom battery box.

Hahahaha thanks bro - yeah i bought that board cheap off Gumtree and rode it for a bit.  I have some hidden footage riding that board at a skatepark which is hilarious as I bail constantly!  Couple of nice falls in a bowl too.  I recorded it so i could remember why I motorised my board and also see my improvement in skill level.  I'll knock the footage together at some point soon and share it with you guys for fun!  

Btw...that board was really for kiting so it was super light which is why it was sooo easy to jump and spin ;-)

[/quote]

The baseplate and kingpins are all the same size, but the carve baseplate has an innner spring position. I am not sure how it will play out, but on my buddies carver build the outer springs seemed strong. I want the option to play with the position.  It's what @Eboosted did on his I think 2nd phoenix...

I see... that's a valid point.
I reduced the area of griptape to the absolute minimum, it's very easy to clean now with less grip.

Me, too!
Do it Deckoz, do it!

Personally I use a Pelicase 1150 but don't like the look at all. On the other hand it's bullet proof with 4mm (1/8inch) ABS shell, a sumo wrestler could jump on it without worries. But I plan to build smaller swappable custom cases in the future.

Just to demonstrate it, first pic is my 12s 8Ah Graphene Lipo with bestech BMS naked, second pic hurts my eyes but this is how it looks with the case :roll_eyes:

[/quote]

I know, good choice for optional future updates but I wouldn't drill the inner position holes in the hanger before you are sure you need them. The problem is when you have loose trucks it's very nice for slow speed carving but for offroad, jumping and higher speed not really. I had 2 rides without yellow dampas on the front truck and enjoyed the nice turning radius but had a scary speed wobble at about 40km/h (25mph) and it felt too spongy for offroad. But with your weight the inner spring position with yellow dampas could be also perfect, who knows. I'm curious which position you choose in the end.

@Eboosted mainly rides on streets and without bindings, inner spring position is perfect for this usage.
```

## \#19 Posted by: Eboosted Posted at: 2018-04-11T03:27:42.443Z Reads: 379

```
The inner spring position is great for street or occasional offroading buy in fact kinda wobbly at 45km/hr, below that is completely fine and fun. 

What we need is a truck that stays going straight at subtle steering, and steers a lot more with less weight.

This could be achieved by reducing the angle the deck/truck and reducing the tension on the springs, the final outcome would be a more stable board at high speed with plenty of steering even at low speeds.

Having recently ridden a Bajaboard this was one of the things that impressed me the most about it.  The suspention feels stiff when you're going fast but has a decent turning radius still.  It's almost like it responds based on how much effort you put in - if you know what i mean?  You edge hard and you get a lot of steering, but if you don't edge at all it just stays straight.

12s 4:1 170kv 165mm tires - 32mph

The parts I didn't want to change - 12s as I already have bms and charger. I have both 130 and 170kv coming... What doesn't get used here goes to another build... 

Idk... Either way this is a full MTB build..I only want to be able to climb hills and jump.. no street... So figured reduction is king in off road... My brain hurts lol

I like your plan. This should be a sweet ride. 

I don't mean to try to steer the direction of your build (or maybe I do), but I like @Nowind's mini drive suggestion, and the Holypro deck for weight savings alone. Since one of your main goals is to get airborne with this thing, and you've got a healthy budget, I think it would be really cool if you purposely built the lightest, most rugged, sealed drive, freestyle ESk8. Maybe even with a smaller, swappable low Ah, high C-rated Lipo pack for strictly jumping and "esk8 Park" riding? I'm envisioning this crazy powerful, near silent, bulletproof, helical direct drive board that can also be thrown around in the air with as little effort as possible. Kind of want to build one of my own now. Damn you @deckoz!! :face_with_symbols_over_mouth: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Ya know... I'm normally not one to take suggestions in most  of my projects, but I would be dumb not to take experiences of others, as I'm normally a "figure it out on my own" kinda guy..

Holy pro, and mini, and 165s making the board as light as possible is probably the right choice due to how much I weigh... And it's supposed to go in the air... 

Your also probably right about LIPO vs LiON.. but I have the cells from nkon already...

Also your idea of a light board..dude have y'all watched Jens helical video 😍😍😍

I think you will be fine torque wise with 4:1 and 130kv. I'm about 100kg when riding with all the equipment and my board still pulls me up 40% hills  (if you believe that we actually have those hills) no problem with 6374 encapsuled, so really only 6369, motors. If you pair this with the 165 tires you'll be golden.

Yeah I reckon this would be the dream set up @Deckoz.  You’ve got me thinking about my next build now and I’ve not even properly finished this one!!! 😂

I’d build your li-ion pack as you’ve got the parts ready to go but consider how you could switch it out for Lipo and freestyle where you’re only doing low km because you love the board the lighter it is. It seems the heavier it is the bigger your jump has to be and the faster you have to hit it. I’d love to see an electric mountainboard light enough that you could 360 it from stand still. I can almost do it on mine...might try it without batteries to see if it makes a difference.....hmmmmm I’ll try it out tonight as that would be a good test of weight difference!  Not the most scientific obviously 😅

That sounds good. 
AFAIK these 6.5inch tires are more for street and hard surfaces. If you ride offrad you need more grip that's why I would suggest 8" offroad tires, also the size is better for any obstacle. And for your calculations, the 8" tires are mostly about 190mm and not 200mm.

Ordered:
- Mini Direct Drive in Blue with Helicals ordered!
- APS Motors
- MBS Foot and Heel Straps

& performance wise rotational weight will have a bigger impact on acceleration, but like with motocross, sometimes they add weight to the flywheel to improve traction, I think I am adding weight that will add speed through traction... time will tell :thinking: my scorpions punch :facepunch:

Either way...I think seeing if the superstars put up with my tiny self...is worth it.. as going with the mini, staying on superstars (for now), and using a holy pro... Is probably about 4lbs(~2kg) saved...

Oh man that sounds awesome. Don't laugh but I hacked together a quick 3 wheel eMTB from a tossed out scooter I found and have been having a blast kicking it around. It's a stupid brushed motor so no fancy vesc or wireless throttle for me just yet but it's definitely got me interested in a 4 wheeled brushless beast.

Thanks @Kug3lis

Looks like I'll be able to fit the RX if I depinned it and heat shrink.. put it right where the Bluetooth module is..but on the other side. Case is fully loaded, comes with all grommets... The USB covers need to be trimmed with scissors or snips. Comes with proper thickness thermal pads. Great little kit. Also got the truck mount, which has nice rubber dampers.

Yea... Minimum for 2.4 to escape is 6.25mm.. there are several holes larger then that. And with the anodizing I don't think the heatsink is grounded on the focbox screw ground pads. So don't think it's acting as a grounded cage..

I've wondered about @Nowind's  use of Sugru as the interface between the machines hanger and the drive. Normally there are grub screws taking up any differences there and with machining is there a noticible gap/play?

I guess what I'm asking is does the sugru make it a cush drive?

## \#105 Posted by: Deckoz Posted at: 2018-05-08T03:33:24.960Z Reads: 234

So, he machines two faces. You put the plate against the milled faces, and use grub screws on the two non milled faces. This way it is pulled against something square. And also centers the drive properly for the wheel gear interface hole..

It should hold on it's own with grub screws. The sugru is to fill the gap to prevent dust from entering and contaminating the lubrication. As the enclosure is designed to be lubricated via the lube hole screw. and sealed via the o-ring at the wheel interface.

I'm waiting just a bit longer to order from Trampa, as I want to order multple sets of superstars so I have a set for the Icarus. More updates soon.

Do you know that BMS well ? The diagram on the eBay page, shows charge/discharge.... From the same plus and minus.... But it can be used only for charge right ? And for discharge it's better to use minus directly from the battery, rather than from the charge/discharge pad on the bms ?

Some BMS like this one and the one I sent to @Sender for 6s are  charge/discharge via the same FETs and intended for low amp applications. The balance functions are the same as the larger counter parts..  just the protections are for a much lower amperage, since we are only using it for charging. and most chargers are 1.5-6A, a 15A in/out BMS is fine, as we bypass and go direct to the battery terminals for discharge.  Being a lower amperage also reduces the needed footprint vs a higher amperage discharge protection circuit, allowing the bms to be smaller.

Tldr, it's not that uncommon to see low amperage BMS with charge/discharge on the same port sharing the same protection circuit.

Thats what i thought thanks....
And this bms is ballancing charge pretty spot on ? I use the bestech bms on my Trampa Urban Carver now , and the ballancing is always spot on, but i could use some more space, so this bms from eBay is interesting

I never have issue with any of the bms I've posted.  Balancing has always been spot on, with the exception of a battery that was broken, which once spot welds were fixed, rebalanced cells perfect. 

I typically don't post links to electronics unless I've used them, Because wasting money sucks. ;)

Not sure yet, I've hooked them up to the focboxes and run detections. According to my phone app belt detection on my Evo is louder (dB wise) than the Helical gearbox.

Finally got an order in to @trampa

Does my build count as the first if you haven't finished this one? 😋

The gear drive look amazing, can't wait for mine >:)
