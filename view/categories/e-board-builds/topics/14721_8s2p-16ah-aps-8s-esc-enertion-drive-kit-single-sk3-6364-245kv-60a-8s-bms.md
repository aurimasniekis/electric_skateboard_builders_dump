Going to be building a board for my friend. He's ridden mine and wants one for himself now with a bigger motor, higher cell count and double the range, hence the creation of this build.

Some specs:
Motor: Turnigy SK3 6364 245kv
Batteries: Four 4S1P 8000mAh LiPo packs
ESC: Alien Power System 300A 8S ESC
Drive kit: Enertion Mono Drive Kit
BMS: 8S 60A

Top speed: Roughly 44kmph
Range: At least 25km (won't know till tested)

This is the current wiring I have in mind. Hopefully it is correct (correct me if it's not)

This is the price of everything, including shipping, in euros (in red):

Total for the board will be roughly 1217 euros, although there will for sure be roughly 30euros of extra cost for materials I'll have to get locally, like wood for the box, wires, and others.


I'll be posting updates on this build as progress progresses.

Well, I think you're paying double what the total cost should be. I'm building one slightly better for half the money, in Europe. You may be lucky with some group buys on this forum, they can save you a lot and quality is the same of other online sellers. 
Why is the drive kit 344 euros? It's just trucks, Mount, pulleys and belt, so something like 60+30+30, + 30 for a set of flywheels clones. Plus, on enertion's site it's 242, not 344

Honestly the sum is quite high lol... 
The build I'm planning with (10s4p, Mono 6374) comes out around 600€... And I'm going Lithium Ion. 

- Why get a blank wholesale deck for 95€ ? You can get a good one for below that. (My Vanguard was 80€) 
- Paying 240€ for lipos ? You can get a good 40 INR25 cells from nkon.nl which results in 10s4p with 10ah. Cells costs 120€+5€ shipping. Get someone to spot weld it or do it yourself. LiIon>Lipo
Btw: title says 8s1p while you have 8s2p

I'm pretty sure you can cheap out on most of the components there. Try the marketplace for a vesc or get your whole drive kit from the Groupbuy - EU/GB

344 because shipping from Australia is expensive (sadly).
Yes I could go cheaper combining different components to eventually get a drive system, but getting a fully assembled one is just much easier. I'm using the enertion kit for my current board and it's been working perfectly

LiPo packs are a lot simpler than building a pack myself, despite the cost benefit of a custom pack
Corrected title

costs are not the only benefit when using 18650 cells :) 

Anyway, try the EU Group Buy.. They have Trucks(Caliberclones), 87/90/97mm flywheels, motor mounts, pulley kit for about 120€. Shipping is from GB so you pay no taxes etc.

Rly, there is no difference when getting a "fully assembled one" since building different components together will just take around 15 mins ??...

Agree with that, you're just wasting your money, with 1200 euros you can build 2 full single drives or one pretty good dual. You don't need to assemble a battery pack, there's a 10s liion on that group buy that would be safer and probably cost less, giving you a pretty good range (if you go for 3000 mah cells you can get a 10s3p with 9Ah for less than 200 euros, with built in switch and bms)

If your in UK/EU it still not too late for you to get in my GB since im still waiting for a few more payments

That'd be this one! http://www.batterysupports.com/28v-29v-30v-60a-8x-36v-8s-lithium-ion-lipo-battery-bms-pcm-pcb-p-264.html

Thanks for letting me know about the link issue :stuck_out_tongue:
