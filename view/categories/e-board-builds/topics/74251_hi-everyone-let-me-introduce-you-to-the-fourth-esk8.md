## \#19 Posted by: topcloud Posted at: 2018-11-12T02:02:32.789Z Reads: 566

```
on the Evolve pictured above, he's implemented the extension bracket, increasing the wheelbase LDP-style about an inch, and it's reinforced by the top-mount plate.

The leaf spring is intended for the curve to point outwards from the deck, and also presumably increases wheelbase and serves as a riser at the same time.

I like it.  Simple.

I'm grateful that you are willing to help!
I am starting to understand PayPal, and I'm thinking to use EMS as the delivery service.

Flip the spring steel 'pads' around. In the current orientation, your trucks momentarily decrease in baseplate angle when you hit a bump. This causes the trucks to straighten out when you hit a bump. For obvious reasons, you don't want the trucks to fight against you as you turn. Orient them like this: ![image|690x460](upload://lMl90JHVpb86Nqs6opHn0gcELvT.jpeg)

Love this thread.  Especially how it was so very nearly lost in translation.  Great ideas and some interesting innovations.  
I personally would never get on those sprung trucks but doesn't make it bad just not my bag.  The extenders though have a real application when trying to fit stuff under something that wasn't designed to have stuff under it.  Good read that.
