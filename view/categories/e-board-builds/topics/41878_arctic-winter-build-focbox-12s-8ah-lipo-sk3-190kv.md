Hi everyone! 

My name is Alex, I am 16 years old and I live in Sweden. As you all know, we sweeds have polar bears walking around in our gardens nowadays, so I figured it would be safer staying inside. Since the Polar bears wont be gone until spring, I have lots of time to work on my next build! :smile: 

This summer I made my first build, a simple 6s board with a low budget. To be honest I was a bit greedy, since I did not want to spend huge sums of money on something that I would end up not enjoying. So i finished it, with some cursing (terrible ebay motor mount, etc.), and eventually it worked great. It was really satisfying overtaking cyclists at 20 mph, on something I built myself! :smile:  

But since I am a speedfreak (I earlier raced with competetive gokarts and I have a motorcycle licence) I was not really satisfied with the topspeed and the range, nor the struggle of charging with a balance charger. 
So I started reading and taking in as much information I could, learning a lot. 

To conclude, what I wanted could be achieved with a 12s 190KV build with BMS. These are the parts I chose:

_Already have_:
**Caliber trucks and Enertion motor mount** from @WARMAN. Great quality, thanks!
**FOCBOX and NANO - X** from @monkey32 awesome group buy. Thanks man! 
**DIY Fiberglass enclosure**

_Buy at hobbyking_
**[4x Zippy Flightmax 3s 8000mAh 30C](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-8000mah-3s1p-30c-lipo-pack.html)** wired in series to make a 12s 8Ah battery
**[SK3 6374 190KV](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html)** Erpm will be set at 60 000 so I wont burn the DRV chip
**15/36 Gearing**
**Misc connectors and wires**

_Still looking for_
**Bestech 12s BMS**
**12s charger**
**MBS All Terrain 100 wheels**

I copied @Namasaki´s 10s lipo build and replaced it with a 12s battery and 12s BMS. This is my current electric scheme, the male and female parts are 5,5 mm bullets:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/f/0f67e68b75b9f10df1ee685559ee6555d5e7950a.png" width="690" height="370">

So what do you think guys? Is the wiring correct? I like the idea of having everything modular with the 5,5 mm bullets, so if anything brakes I can easily swap it out. What do you think of my choice of battery and motor? The zippy´s are at a great price right now, and shipping is free during all december! 

Does anyone in Europe have a spare Bestech 12s BMS and charger? I like the idea of the E-switch on the bestech so I would prefer it over the Supower one. Having mentioned that, how would the wiring scheme differ with a supower BMS?

Anyway, thanks for this awesome community, I have learned tons of exciting new things!
