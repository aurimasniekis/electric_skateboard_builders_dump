A missile shaped deck 43 X 9 1/2 no concave.  Plan to have a custom grip tape design to keep in line with the missile look (TBA)...I will be using the fake CF on the bottom with RGB LED ground effects and led headlights.

Ok so Sensored motors and ESCs 

This is a GoolRc Car esc ... Cheap and so far all have worked well....but have been unsensored 

Wire by color?

How do I insure the proper connections?

You can do it the scientific way or my way. I plug the phase wires in according to color then hit the throttle quickly. If it makes a weird noise or hesitates I switch the phase wires around. Just don't hit throttle too long or you'll fry something. It should end up sounding normal, if they are plugged in correctly.

Finished but not tested.

Had to make some changes to the build due to time and a part failure.

ESC was changed to a 6s Toro 80a esc because the orginal was not reaponding. Since, that isn't a sensored ESC I switched the motor to a non sensored motor.

Hope to have some Video of it in action before it gets shipped out

But great idea...I did call them last year and see if they have any plans to make them...they said No üòê

Dayum! That's dopeness. You've outdone yourself on this one. The whole theme, design and lighting is awesome. I especially like the scattered laser since it gives the effect of the rocket shooting sparks. It would be even cooler if the "sparks" had some kind of motion or flickering effect to enhance the rocket thrust look. Do those lights have any dynamic features like that? Either way, it still looks great. 

Something about this build just kind of makes me feel happy. Maybe it's my my love of ESk8ing, maybe it's my love of freedom, I don't know, but it works. And excellent choice of music for your video. :thumbsup::metal:

@Mobutusan thanks my brother.....

Unfortunately ... The lasers don't have any special effects...id have to put something between the power and the lazer ..which I guess I could do...but maybe in the future

But on this build I only have and on off switch..usually I have a remote and have the lights blinking or something..but we kept it simple this time...

Not sure what build I have next but...I ordered something new that I wanted to try out......cause of you like LEDs...the future build I'm planing will be over the top...I hope üòú

I'm Happy it makes you happy ü§òüèª and that's one of the points of my builds... I want it to evoke some type of emotion...and I got that a lot from people when I built my Back to the Future board...Lots of "Holy Shit thats Dope"...I just took another test ride tonight to check the truck adjustment I made....Dude in a pickup truck stopped me ...he wants me to build him a board ... I've had people stop in the middle of traffic to talk to me and ask questions

The little switch is for the esc <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/9/9b3ae15e21b5943256320a3e799af61dfa8c828e.jpeg" width="500" height="500">
