I have this DIYe kit that I got for free not too long ago.

I have heard Torqueboard upgrades such as the trucks, motor mounts, and motors would work but I am not at all sure where to start. Any advice? Also I have the street wheel kit and I prefer riding with that to the AT wheels.

Their ESC and battery BMS will be the limitations here if you want more power. It also looks like their motor mount only fits 50mm.

I'd consider selling the kit and building a DIY with better parts or keeping the kit as a backup. Would probably be less of a headache
