A 12s, 2.6kw single drive 24" Carver surfskate (yes, with that quick-steering front truck and everything).
Oh, did I mention this little cruiser has a 350wh lipo pack?
Just needs an enclosure and this thing will be awesome.
Did a few test rides. Definitely trickier than on the big deck, but pretty easy to ride once you get used to it. Really just a matter of keeping your weight forward enough to prevent a wheelie.

I love the look of it too with the big wide rear truck, looks almost like a gasser you'd see at the drag strip. Super happy with this build so far.

I hope you don't run over a screw.  Please get some protection on those lipos, the tiniest puncture or dent can be fatal to them

Don't worry, I know the dangers of LiPos, been working with them for over a decade. I won't be riding it properly until I make an enclosure, just doing a few tests for now until I vac-form an enclosure.

Well don't tell anyone, but I'm now talking with a local skate shop that carries the carver front trucks, we may end up producing a few of these once I refine the design and layout a bit. My main issue with the board at the moment is carrying it, the thick batteries on the bottom make for an inconvenient package. Thinking about doing a deck with a carry handle in the kicktail...

Got through lifetime testing of multiple prototypes around March when the shop ran into some tough times and dropped the project. I've since taken a full-time job at flyzipline.com so no time to work on this, but if you're interested I'd be happy to send you my findings and a few recommendations if you want to build one of these. It was a lot of fun, but I'd recommend going with two smaller (say 1.5kw class) motors (or even hub motors) rather than the ~2.5kw turnigy motors. Running that motor in single-drive was squirrelly on such a short deck, and dual-drive was impractically heavy.
