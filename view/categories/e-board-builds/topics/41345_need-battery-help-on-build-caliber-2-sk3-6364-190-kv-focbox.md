Hi everyone, 

I’ve been researching for a few months now and wanted to get my build reviewed before I bought the rest of the things I need. Right now here is what I plan to buy. I already have a deck. I’m really looking for some input on my battery at this point (and any other little things you think I'll need)

Controller - https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingr-tmhk-gt2b-3ch-2-4ghz-transmitter-and-receiver-w-rechargable-li-ion-battery-1.html

Battery:
1.	4x https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-5000mah-5s1p-40c.html to make a 10s2p
2.	collections/electric-skateboard-battery-pack/products/electric-skateboard-epower-battery-pack-9s2p
Does anyone have any opinions or reasons I shouldn’t get the Epower one? From what I understand, at the current price point the epower one will end up being **way** cheeper than the 4x 5000 mah 5s1p which makes me think there's something I'm missing.

Thanks!

if you're going with mono build, you don't need 80c discharge. just get 4x of [these](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-battery-5000mah-5s-20c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html) and you'll have 40c discharge and a fuller wallet

Great thanks for your input! Just out of curiosity do you have any opinions on the epower one? I did some searching on the forum and I've seen some people think they're great while others dont seem to like them but I haven't seen much reasoning

sorry i don't have experience. these lipos will have a 360Whcapacity and will cost 100£and with 40c discharge. so that's a good selling point eheheh
