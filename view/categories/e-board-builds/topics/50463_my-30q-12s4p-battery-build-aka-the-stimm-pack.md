Hey guys, I just got done with my 12s4p 30Q Samsung cell battery.  

Here is my build pictures.   I used 737 silicon glue and fish paper to make sure everything was done properly.  I also used 10mm 0.2 gauge nickel strip (doubled up for my serial connections).  

Hope this helps anyone attempting to build a battery themselves!

48 total (4 in parallel and 12 in series), which gives me 50.4 volts 12x4.2v.

If I understand you correctly the 12 BMS wires just need to be connected anywhere you made the series connections. There really isnâ€™t a positive or neg side to that.

does it matter where
[/quote]

it does not, bms is just looking at voltage at that position.

Hello, very Nice battery build. I bought 50 cells today and plan on the same config as you. Can u please tell me what BMS u used and what kinda spot welder that will do for a few batteri builds. also the layout config of plus and minus ?
