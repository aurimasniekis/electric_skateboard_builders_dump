Hey everyone, I've owned a boosted v1 for a year now and want to upgrade, so I'm gonna build one!  I've looked at diyeboard kits but keep reading it's low quality/reliability.  I'm a 190lbs (85kg) student with $1000 max budget (preferably closer to $750 if possible) and want a shortboard 30 ish inches for commuting to and from campus.  I'm fine at building things so I can do a little modding if needed, but little is better.  I can't afford the best if the best but I would llike good quality that will last a while with as little maintenance as possible.
Some specs I'm needing:
-25 top speed
-10 miles range 
-15 lbs or less
-large torque (live in hilly area)
-dual drive for better braking
Sorry, im not super sure what to add!  Any questions/input would be great.  Or if I'm just asking for an unrealistic board, feel free to tell me that too!

For what you need, you should go with lipos. You also need a dual drive. I think your going to have a hard time building a dual drive for under $1000, and for sure $750

If that isn't clear to you, I would definitely suggest doing some more reading on here. Willing to help but I'm not willing to have to explain everything when its @ your fingertips. I'm not an asshole. I just don't like having to hold someone's hand through it.

Go simple, single drive with a focbox and a lot of P groups in the battery. You'll grow out of it but then you can add another FocBox and motor and you will have twice the torque and higher speeds. Then when you growniut if that you still have a big ass battery (the biggest expense) to use on a more mature build. 

Or do whatever, it's just money ðŸ˜€.

Lol, what kind of batteries do you use that have groups of people inside? I prefer to run mine on hamsters, so much more compact!

Manners advice is pretty good though, a dual will make it difficult to stay under budget. especially if you need a charger and all the little bits and pieces you forgot about. Get a big single and go from there.

Get 1500 and make a much better esk8 overall, you could go dual drive with that budget, get a Jet Spud 29" or a Loaded Kut-thaka for USD 60

I suggest you go with Li-Ion batteries, they have better lifespan. 

But 2 focboxes, you will only buy them once, otherwise you will struggle with blown cheap ESCs latter down the road.

Get @dickyho pulleys, 16/36T

Flipsky have cheap reliable motirs get the 6355 190kv

Use Orangatang blue caguamas they are soft and perfect for a short/light board and hold abuse pretty good

Get a mini remote, it's the best one out there, very reliable and very cheap, it's like USD 25 including the receiver. 

@jlabs has deal for battery and enclosure, with charger and switch

Get caliber II trucks they are good and cheap like USD 50 on Amazon

You'll hear different terms for VESC now since Trampa? has trademarked the name VESC but they all mean what you think it does, such as FocBox. 

Li-ion are generally better, but are more expensive than Li-po. The issue you will soon find out is that depending on what configuration of battery you may plan on might consume half of your budget.

[/quote]
Both can be good depending on your needs.

Lion is generally prefered as you get more charge cycles and more capacity for the size. They are more expensive though and more challenging to build a pack from. 

Lipo are often prefered for mountain boards because they can have much higher amp draw then lion if you get good spec ones. Its quite easy to make a 10s or 12s pack from them compared to a lion pack of 50 cells. They are more water resistant. Also some people find lipo much easier to acquire then genuine 18650's depending on location.

Can anyone tell me if there's an advantage to having lion 12s4p vs 12s2p, aside from range?  Im going to buy stuff soon, and I don't ever see myself needing more than 10 ish miles range.  Currently gonna do a single 6374 set up and the 12s2p should work well for my needs, but I would like to upgrade to dual in the future, still don't need more than 10 mile range though.  I'd like light, powerful, and around 10 miles range (which varies on set up Of course).  Just want to learn more!

I tested out the board tonight, but have no idea what my setting should be. I only got up to 19mph with my setup, I'm guessing my vesc setting are largely what's holding back my power?  Can someone take a look at my vesc settings and tell me what to change to get the speed/power up to around 25mph? (Without overtaking my electronics of course)
Maybe @JLabs , @b264 , or @mmaner ? 

I'm running an 11s3p (30q) on a single 6374 with 16/40 gearing, and 97mm wheels.

Also, is it possible to have a reverse option?

You can raise your battery max to 60a safely. It's your gearing that's keeping your speed down. With a single motor I would use 16/36. You might try raising your motor max to 80a.

I would still start at 16/36 and move to 15 or 16/40 or even higher depending in your torque needs. Gearing is just something you have to play with. 

Bigger motor pulleys give you speed, smaller gives you torque. Bigger wheel pulleys give you torque, smaller gives you speed. When u say bigger and smaller I'm referring to tooth count.

You just have to halve your battery settings per vesc as you are now connecting 2 units to it.
For example
Single set up = 40 amps battery max and -25 min(regen)  (Just an example not a recommendation)

then on the dual each vesc would be 20 amps battery max and -12 battery min. 
Sure you get the picture.:grinning:

Something I've not considered, but does the diam of the two pulleys affect much? I understand torque ratios and what not, but if someone has two set up 15/30 and the other is 20/40, since the ratio is 1:2 on both would the performance be identical?  Or, since the 20t is widsr in radius than the 15t, would it have less torque even though the ratio is identical?
```

---
## \#67 Posted by: b264 Posted at: 2018-12-29T09:26:06.879Z Reads: 72

```
The torque would be the same on both setups since they are both 1:2, but the one with bigger diameter pulleys would have less potential for skipping and could be run looser which is more efficient and has less idle drag and makes the belts last longer.  So bigger is better, but you don't want the wheel pulley so big it's too close to the roadway either...  You really don't want to use a pulley with less than 15 teeth either because it strains the belt too much reducing its lifespan and can skip easier.

So 15-20 motor pulley and 32 - 44 wheel pulley are the normal size ranges and 15/36 and 15/40 are the most popular ratios.

Of course none of these are hard rules; you can do whatever you want and each setup is different.

Where would you suggest I find 20t motor pulleys?  That would be much less expensive but I can't seem to find any on the usual sites I go to.  My pulley kit is the 15mm 16t/40t from Torque board, if that helps any.  Oe if you have any extra you're up to selling that works too

What is the bore? 8mm?

I'm assuming HTD5M tooth profile which is what 99.9% of esk8 use.  Boosted brand skates and a very, very, very small number of DIY use HTM3M

The diameter of the BKB 6374 motors I'm using is 8mm, I don't know enough about the different tooth profile unfortunately, I'm hoping torque boards uses htd5m

@J0ker3366 any chance you can share an active link? I've purchased several specific esk8 things on Amazon (electrical connectors, bolts, etc) that i wasn't super familiar with and have to keep returning things because I get a small measurement wrong

Steel ones are better though if you can find them.

Also a 3mm keyway is a LOT better if you can find one with that

Thank you both! While you're here, any thoughts on idler bearings? I'm consider adding a couple if they're worth it, 6374 is a lot of torque and it was slipping a lot today.  Or if you have any tips on tensioning belts in TB mounts?

Yeah I was hoping thefd was some some secret source y'all use for pulleys with the keyhole and with quick shipping, I'm super spoiled with Amazon prime

Vendors here have a lot of things but I'm not aware of any 20T keyed steel motor pulleys with 8mm bore

Good luck finding it!

I had a machine shop use a broach to add keyways to some of my pulleys but they aren't ***needed*** per se, just gives me piece of mind that when I slam on the brakes, the motor pulleys aren't going to strip their tiny grubscrews and spin-out on me

Not sure what I did different aside from fully charged but I wired it up again and hit 25 mph easy, not even full speed.

I've had some hiccups with my vescs, but while that's being sorted out I wanted to show you all my front trucks.  The first photo is my xt90 antispark on/off switch (with a walnut grip I made), then it's my usb phone charge port (used a step down module), and the next photo is the board charging port.  The last photo is a picture of the wires I routed through the board that come up directly into the housing so no waterproofing issues (I need to clean it up the silicone a bunch, but the concept is there)

Can anyone help me diagnose why my motor is struggling when it first starts spinning?  It is on sensored FOC, 11s3p, 6374.  It was read properly when setting it up on the vesc tool, but now it's doing this.  
@mmaner @b264 either of you know why?
