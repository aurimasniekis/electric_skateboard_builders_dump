This is probably not something you could expect, but I'm gonna try. I want to put all the batteries inside the deck without additional enclosure. Batteries will tightly sit inside and can easily be removed (airplane friendly). The deck might look thin and prone to crack but it shouldn't because of the ribbed structure.

Idea:

1. Laser cut 8 plywood sheets 3mm each
2. Glue 7 of them together
3. Insert 2x VESC + capacitors + wiring
4. Insert 50 individual 18650 cells (without soldering)
5. Attach the 8th plywood cower sheet with screws
6. Put on hub motors

Have you considered the affects of vibration and shock from cracks and bumps in the road surface on a solder less battery system. 
Possible loosening of the copper tabs and possible arcing at high current draw ?
Sorry for the cloud.

I have small silicone/rubber inserts under each copper tab, the battery sits really tight. 10s 5p will help lowering the current on each parallel group. I will start measurements at low currents first and slowly increase it.

Subscribed!  Want to see how this build goes.  One thing I'm noticing is there doesn't look like a lot of "meat" to the board, I think when you stand on it it might flex/break and move all your batteries - but it sounds like you're aware of that and going to build it up strong!  Keep us posted!

Are the batteries going to go in from the top or bottom?

Either way, you should match the 18650 curve on one side of the battery. So the middle sheet of plywood would be ~18.3mm then the next might be 17, then 16 all the way down to the cover.

Looking forward to the result!

That looks very cool! It is a totally new approuch indeed! 
I am actually in the process of making a board of of @Maxid's design. If you want it to be solderless you can also buy some battery cases from eBay like these:

Maxid's board is also very nice (full credits to him!)If you want to fit more cells you can just make it longer... See a pic in the post below. I could only post one pic in this post...

Edit: I somehow am not allowed to post the pic... you will have to ask him for pictures...

Looks really good! 

I really like the idea. This might be my next upgrade if my board turns out well (really love ultra thin designs with minimal components protruding). Also regarding the strength of the board since some people seemed concerned; I'm not sure if you've run an FEA on it, but given how thick the board is gonna be (about 2cm thick right if you're fitting 18650s in it?), and the fact that both the top and bottom are solid plates, it should be really strong since you're greatly increasing your moment of inertia on your board (these might be unfamiliar terms, this is stuff I've studied, mechanical engineering: beams and bendy stuff). In any case, for the same reason and I-beam is strong, this board should be really stiff and even stronger than a regular board load-wise. Haven't run the math so this is just an opinion, but an educated one at the very least.

In any case awesome project, and do post updates!

EDIT: but since you're doing laser-cutting you might know about all this stuff, but for the others: his board is cool

looks interesting. but with a flat deck you feet will get sore before you can run out 50 cells.....
can we get a zoom out on the deck? I would add another cm to each side. since thats where most of the strength will come from. 

also consider staggering the battery cells for a more honey comb like structure.

The bottom one looks like the same model. Remember that you want as much metal contact with the battery, so the model with the springs is probably not going to work well... It will probably get very hot due to high resistence. You should also get some thick wires in between the cases as well :smiley:

I have never tried using them to be honest. I will buy some and get back to you when I have tested the resistance. :) I think they will be okay. If not you could replace the metal spring/plate with a thicker and / or more conductive one - ex a nickel plate.

parallel cells have tiny amounts of current between them and the main current travels through the series connections so maybe the sleds with the paralleled cells and  with thick copper connections between would be ...as good as ever

I've heard this multiple times by several users and was steering away from it but do you really think electrons magically disappear from one point and appear at another???

Hint: No. 
Here's an image to explain how much current would flow in a 4P pack where only the last cell is connected to the next series set as is done in most of our setups. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/0/709c8d738a55a93150baf71131228966cb4c3d39.JPG" width="666" height="500">

As you can see, not all strips need to be rated to 40A but all need at least 10A and not zero current as implied by others. Otherwise, why even connect them?

My point is that both for the sleds and a welded pack (which is irrelevant to @rpasichnyk's build as he's doing something different) you cannot just add wires in the "series" connection. There is current flowing in the "parallel" connections as current has to get from point a to point b. A 1.5" long pure nickel strip (.005" x .25") can take up to 10A before they get really hot in my own experiments. This falls right in line with endless-sphere's 18650 spot welding how to by nobuo.  

If you only add copper to the series connection, you're going to be running up to (n-1)/n*I
n = cells in parallel,
I = total current,
through a single nickel strip. This means lots of heat and an overall inefficient design as your heat generated is I^2*R which also means a high voltage drop btw (which ties into that other thread too). 

---

In summary, you should add as big a wire as you can in all connections and not skimp out on parallel connections as that will make your pack inefficient.

I just made it the other way. So you can easily connect the holders by bending the pins on the bottom side and solder them together. I will add parallel connections by soldering a wires between the parallel cells so that the cells can be balanced. 
One more pack and i have my 12S4P. Made already a 12S8P in a very similar way.

This pack has a couple of advantages:
- very flexible
- cells can be replaced at any time
- easy to build
- you can take it on a plane
- current is shared between 4 lines
- cells are very well protected
- no spot welding necessary and no soldering on the cells

disadvatages:
- bit more weight because of the holders (12S4P pack will be 350 - 400g, i guess a standard pack has like 200g of wires and heatshrink)
- 30 mm wider  (156 mm total) than a standard 12S4P

Ibeams are strong because all 3 elements are connected (one piece)
the strenght of this board also will depend on  how the top, the middle and the bottom part are attached.
right now one plywood layer on top, and one on the bottom is not enough.
you need more

@PXSS, 

Nonetheless, you should do a FEA on the design because Concentrated Stress Points happen at sharp corners, I would recommend filleting, but you can't do that now. 
Side note if you guys have seen road gutter drains sometimes that have this same design of rectangles and ribbage but because their made of metal(steel presumbably)  and have a lot of ribbage made into them the,  FEA would be useless unless they want to save as much money as possible because they overengineered it.

What's stopping me from saying:
"full 80amps of course while the paralleled 4 cells will have ...50 amps in them max."

No. I do not agree. There are many variables that you're not even thinking about. As I said, electrons don't magically disappear from point a and appear at point b. Your rough "math" is based on nothing. 
You're looking for someone to confirm what? You at the very least need a theory as to why you think a tenth is an appropriate number. 

No matter how many series connections you have, my example is a slice of any XS4P. Keep adding groups of four cells to the right and you'll get the same pattern repeated again and again. 

My example is equivalent to the worst case scenario you showed above which is exactly how most board packs are built without adding too much complexity. 
I'm saying most and not all because there are packs like @Ackmaniac, that are well thought out. His pack resembles more the best current share example you show. 

I have not seen any packs built like the "perfect" example in esk8, post a picture if you find one.

@Hummie you should have a look at PXSS example again. He put in in math there and showed something. As always you simply want to ignore it.
If you would be so kind then show us your math. Because simply saying it's a tenth of the series current without any explanation (and i am sure there is none) is absolutely childish.

Plywood is going to ride like shit man. 
Why do you need so many batteries?
Batteries are heavy.

I did something similar, but instead of plywood I used two identical boards,screwed together. 
I cut the bottom board to hold my batteries and dug just a little wood out of the top deck and then sanded it down toward the edges so that they edges were only as thick as one deck.

A normal board pretty much is plywood no?

Why need so many batteries?  So many benefits.  I'd stick as much in as I can and ride it ...just don't carry it

Thank you everyone for suggestions! I have been designing this board for a long time and I hope I though about most of the issues. First thing I did after gluing is testing how strong the deck is. I literally jumped on it to make sure it doesn't crack. Sure I did this before putting all the electronics in. Plywood is cheap and if it breaks I just design a beefier version. Because I don't know how to calculate it in a scientific way like @cricrithezar but I just pretend I know what he is talking about ;)

@Ackmaniac really smart, I like how battery holders bend together! I think this approach will be very popular among people who want to go solderless.

Laser cutting is a LOT of fun! @Michael319 if you live close to a big city, search for hackspace / makerspace. I did everything in [Stockholm Makerspace](https://wiki.makerspace.se/Maskiner_och_inventarier). It's amazing. They have all the tools.

Copper strips 0.2mm x 9mm. Parallel connections - 2mm solder wick.

Using a cheap DIY press which is not even a press, from some chipboard laying around.

That's a lot of glue squeeze out! It was a nightmare to remove!

@Hummie @PXSS here what you were talking about. I have thick wire on each side which takes all the heavy current.

The deck turned out very very strong. It doesn't bend at all, it's like a rock. @saul you are right, 50 cells is a lot and I won't be able to drain the battery in a single run, but I'm doing it for science! After checking that the deck is strong it's time to put in electronics. First go capacitors that are exactly 18mm in diameter, like the cells. Then go VESCs. There are slots for radio and BLE, charger port and motor wire channels.

OMG that's a lot of cells! The deck IS cells, almost. I hope it doesn't explode.

The board is heavy. 8kg. I blame CarvON.

Ready for riding! I did 4 holes for VESC ventilation, I'll probably 3D print small air intakes for better airflow. Between the VESCs there are small XT30 charging port and 5A charging fuse, in case I somehow short the XT30. On the left side there is XT-90 Fused Antispark switch.

Here is some riding data, multiply values by 2 since data comes only from one VESC.

https://metr.at/r/DkKli

Max current was 14.3A √ó 2 = 28.6A. That's about ~ 5.7A through a single cell. Votage drop during this time was 39V ‚û° 37V.

Wow - 90kph - must have been a hell of a ride ;)

Nice build - I really like your approach and how stealthy it is.

Holy shit, that is awesome!

Would it be possible to do a more narrow board if you'd gone with 10s4p or even 10s3p?

Wow that's a really nice build, nice to see it come together! Actually doing the math is nice if you don't want to waste material but jumping on it a couple times is definitely also a good way of making sure it's strong enough haha. Now you're making me want to build my own deck as well. How are the copper tabs working for you? Also what are the dimensions on your deck?
In any case awesome build!

Im not sure its all that wide, it might just be short.  The pics are a bit angled, anyways I cant tell.  @rpasichnyk what are the dimensions of the deck?

@rwxr 10s4p would be possible, 10s3p probably would be too narrow. I can also just leave slots empty, and use 10s4p/3p, the connection is still there

@cricrithezar I used $8 bathroom silicone sealant to make small elastic inserts which I put under copper tabs. It holds nice and tight :slight_smile:

@mmaner you are right, the deck is short. Dimensions are 25cm x 75cm

That's not too wide, pretty average for a longboard deck.  Really short, would be easy to tack on 6 inches (3 at each end) and make it a normal longboard length.  It looks pretty cool being subby too though.

Do the motors hit when turning and how are the pressure connections doing!?!  The pressure connections are very unique.  I forget are u using conductive paste or bare? Any extreme rough roads?  I imagine if any cells disconnect even for an instant  it will shutdown the board

One suggestion would be to put a piece of foam on the lid that puts pressure on the battery to stay towards the bottom ('in this case towards the top'), 

Another would be to put spring loaded tabs so its always got constant pressure on the terminals of the batteries.

I¬¥m wondering why noone mentioned it yet. I¬¥d wire the motor cables between the trucks and the board and not between trucks and street. After the first few rocks or wood or something sharp you could easily rip them apart!
But cool build :slight_smile:
There have to be a easier method of bringing some edges to that board, that it¬¥s more comfortable with locking your feets in.
