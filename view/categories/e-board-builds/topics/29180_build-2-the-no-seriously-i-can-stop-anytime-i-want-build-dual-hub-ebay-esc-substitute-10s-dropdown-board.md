 Purchased the speed controller tonight, (sale number 91 for those who have been watching this item on EBay), Need  some HUB motors still and not sure which of the limited options are still available, does anyone else know? I will be running it at 10s  on a drop down all black stealth board. Links to ESC and one potential HUB motor candidate below...

Looks like thin urethane... if you want serious carving go for Carvon V3 or belt drive

The maximum possible urethane thickness will be 13.5mm which isn't a lot. Have a look at the thread about urethane quality or something and it explains it a bit there. It seems the more urethane the better you should probably aim for around 16-17mm to dampen vibrations
