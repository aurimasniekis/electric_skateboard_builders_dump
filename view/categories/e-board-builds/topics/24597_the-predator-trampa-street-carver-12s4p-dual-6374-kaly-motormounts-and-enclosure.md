Hello guys this is my going to be my 3rd build, I'm really excited for it, this feeling of being able to create your own vehicle is awesome, I know I'm not the first one to build a Trampa Street Carver but to me it feels like I'm the first in the universe.

I was waiting to finish it to post all pictures at once but I decided to use this thread to document everything as I move forward.

Final board:

Beautiful Trampa deck 14ply (glad I went with it instead of the 15 ply, it's flexible but not too much, BTW I'm 154lb (70kg)

Mini vertigo trucks, even wider than the Evolve hangers

Red springs on white dampas

Here is the truck mounted on the deck, this is the urcan carver position, I had to switch to street carver position later in order to gain more height and avoid hitting stuff on the road
[img]http://i.imgur.com/316sDzQ.jpg[/img]

I repositioned the springs to the inner position and the carving is now amazing, maybe too much, I'll have to give it a try later when I testthe board on the street:

I shaved the MBS wheels on the lathe in order to avoid the resonance that might have something to do with the trucks cracking, check [this](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/trampa-street-carve-nyc-style/15363/177) post for more info:

Here is the final board:

The wide hangers are pretty wide, wider than I expected, so I'm happy with them:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/qCt8Z9D.jpg[/img]

The 6374 motors a pretty big and feel heavy, there no such thing as "too much power" :grin:

The motors came with nude phase cables and @Kaly included 5.5mm bullets on each motor and a the correct JST connector to connect directly to the VESC. I covered them with braided nylon sleeving in order to get a profesional look and protect them:

I went with Samsung 30Qs from IMRbatteries.com, I got a pretty good deal as I purchased 210 units for me and my friends e-boards.

[img]http://i.imgur.com/t3FyAPY.jpg[/img]

Tomorrow I'll begin with the battery assembly, here is a 12S4P on Kaly's enclosure, I hope I could fit the antispark switch, BMS and charger in there.

#1.) Your gf is a saint, hands down... expensive purse or not ;0
#2.) How did you reach Kaly.nyc?
#3.) How much per cell did you end up paying for the 18650s?

Im looking forward to your build as Im either going to be doing one quite similar or having kaly send me a street carve and the urban carve adaptation set and just DIY a lipo pack (I'm looking to do 14S/15S and a higher reduction of say 13t/47t with ABEC 97s... volt up, gear down and all)...

Thanks in advance!

Hey man:

1. Yeah, she really is!
2. You reach him by PM on the forum @Kaly
3. I paid US$ 522.01 for 110 cells, that's US $ 4.75 each Samsung 30Q shipped to Miami

13/47 is too much reduction for my taste, if you use 190KV motors and 10S, you would get only 18MPH, really slow.

If you get Kaly 6355 230KV motors and 12S you could raiuse your tops speed up to 27MPH much better, but I'll shoot to 36MPH with 12S 190KV and 16/36T

So, I finished the board yesterday 3:00am:

[img]http://i.imgur.com/j8l6hJ8.jpg[/img]

It was worth it!, this board is nothing like any of my previous builds, it's freaking fast, a lot of power to handle right off the bat, torque is ridiculous and it's fun, FUN! to ride it.

I'm runing 40T drive pulley at the moment, still waiting on the 36T pullies from Kaly, buy I'm not sure why would I want more speed than this ever!

[img]http://i.imgur.com/i8up2zH.jpg[/img]
[img]http://i.imgur.com/QCVTHZR.jpg[/img]

The 6374 motors are amazing, I knew I was going to get more power but didnt think it was that much, they also look badass.

However, it was difficult to align those motor mounts, they always get crooked at different angles, I'll try to align them tomorrow.

Where did you get that Spot Welder ?
Kaly is making a smaller 36T Pulley ??

Do you think those Thin Nickel Strips can handle all the Amps the 4P can putout ?

the series connection is what has to handle high currents. so as long as his series connection cable is thick enough the single or double nickel strip should be sufficient.

I think it has to be silicone wire due to the flexiness of the Trampa Board.
I hope he kept in mind that he should have soldered the series cable in the middle of the 4P pack - otherwise the nickel strip is part of the series connection and might exceed the recommended current.

I have done the same thing on top of a double layer nickel strip just to be safe.
@whitepony switched to using several layers and no copper AFAIK.
I prefer solder wick now over solid copper though - makes reusing your pack simpler as the layout can be changed more easily.

well you don't spot weld on the solder - you put some spots of solder in between where the cells will be and then spot weld the prepared nickel strip to the cells - this is far easier than soldering after the nickel is welded and you don't heat up your cells as much

I got the spot welder from here Tindie shop, the seller is a know member of endless sphere:

https://www.tindie.com/products/KaeptnBalu/diy-arduino-battery-spot-welder-v2-prebuilt-kit-/

Kaly didn'tsent me the pulleys by mistakwem so I'm waiting on those, I though he was doinf a 36T for these builds, I might have been mistaken though

I added flexible 14AWG cable between each pack as additional from the flexible cables, so it should work ok.

That's a great price delivered and a Beautiful Build (Finish at 3AM, Classic!)

What does your 4P pack weigh once assembled (tabs welded and wired)?

You are absolutely right about the 18mph on 10S but ill be going 14S - 15S and presuming Kaly motors are efficient with decent bearings then ill be doing the Volt Up, Amp Down way I've always gone with eBikes...

14S @ 51.8v = 9842 RPM @ Shaft : 3.616 : 1 reduction = 2721.79 RPM @ Wheel / 336 * 3.27" = No load @ 100% 26.48 mph : 23.575mph @ 89% efficiency loaded

** 15S @ 55.5v = 10,545 RPM @ Shaft : 3.616 : 1 reduction = 2916.21 RPM @ Wheel / 336 * 3.27" = No load @ 100% 28.38 mph, 25.259 mph @ 89% efficiency loaded

The 15S is likely to be how I go and I can always adjust the motor and ABEC pulleys and re-tension if I want higher speed but this will allow me to run at full WOT loaded at nominal voltage and keep efficiency of the BLDC higher by using higher RPM, I spent my weekend fixing up a 3D printer so now I can print my own flywheel pulleys (and maybe even some motor pulleys too).

Great job man, thanks for the pictures and feedback!

Regards,
Mike

Nico, the only thing wrong with the board are the brakes, they need more power on high medium speeds, these are my settings, would you suggest to increase battery min?

```

---
## \#37 Posted by: Ackmaniac Posted at: 2017-06-12T23:17:06.153Z Reads: 625

```
The reason for weak brakes at high speeds is that you are at a high duty cycle and the battery min is the limitation there.
Let's say you need 40A at the  motor to get a nice brake. Then at 80% duty cycle with a battery min of -10 you only get -10 / 0.8 = -12,5A. So the slower you go the stronger the brakes will be. For example with this battery min you only get -40 at 25% duty cycle (-10 / 0.25 = -40).
Luckily even at high speeds when you brake the duty cycle reduces very fast.

So you are right. If you raise the battery min you will get stronger brakes at higher speeds. For example if you raise it to -12,5 then the brakes will become 25% stronger at higher speeds.

By my experience this is the downside of big motors (6374 compared to 6355). But to be honest i didn't make that many tests with them. Because in my normal board i have a huge battery which can handle 32A as max allowed continuous charge current. And this is always enough at any speed. 

My personal idea is that you can go higher with the battery min as the specs of the battery allow it. (Most high current Li-Ion batterys only allow 4A). But i read somewhere that high pulses are good or at least not bad for the battery. But high continuous charge current are very bad for the cells for sure. But short pulses seems to be ok. But these are only my 2 cents about it without any scientific background to prove it. 

And i would like to have strong brakes in emergency situations and use it gentle when i ride it normally at high speeds.

So for example when you go up to -12 (-24 total) then you go 50% higher than the specs. But the specs are the maximum that is allowed when you charge it for a couple of hours contentiously. And not for 2-3 seconds short bursts.

And if somebody wants to prove me wrong or right then please do that with some scientific background information. Otherwise we end up hijacking this thread with thoughts instead of useful information.

So ,if I got this right, watt control is awesome when accelerating but when it comes to braking, current control gives you the strongest brakes at higher speeds. (?)

I tested 12.5A of batt min and it brakes better at high speeds, at low speeds it lock the wheels sooner. I wonder if I could increase max batt to -70A instead of -60A?, could that pull back too many amps into the battery, I have a 12S4P with Samsung 30Q?

Dual 6374 190KV are a beast demoniac beast, once they reach the maximum efficiency RPM they pull like if a car hit you in back! I love it!

## \#42 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2017-06-13T04:42:16.999Z Reads: 552

```
I think you have that backwards. Batt max should be a positive value and batt min should be a negative value. For dual VESC the highest your batt min (regen) should be is -8 per VESC since the 30Q's take a max charge current of 4A each.

4A * 4(parallel) = 16A / 2 VESCs = 8a charge current per vesc, which means you should use -8A per VESC

I'm at -40/-40 now. When I was at -60/-60 with Kaly's 6355's I nearly flew off my board braking!

```

---
## \#45 Posted by: Eboosted Posted at: 2017-06-13T05:41:32.332Z Reads: 586

```
So would there be any harm to raise motor min (regen) from -40A to -50A for each VESC?

I thought motor min (regen) -40A from each VESC meant -80A total, that meant -20A of regen back to the batteries on 100% duty cycle, so if you are braking on 25% most of the time they would be charging at 5A, at 50% DC 10A. I wonder what would happen when you apply 100% DC for a small fraction of time, will the motors send -20A to the batteries, would that be safe?

motor min is only the current in the motor when braking, not going into the battery. You'll only regen when you brake when going faster than your full throttle anyway.

```
From my understanding, it's dissipated as heat in the motor. In order for you to regen charge, your BEMF voltage needs to be higher than your pack voltage (similar to how you charge with a 42v charger for a 10s pack). Voltage will only flow from a higher source to a lower source. This site explains it better than me.

https://www.roboteq.com/index.php/applications/100-how-to/160-understanding-regeneration
In this case CEMF == BEMF

>In certain situations the CEMF may overcome the battery, in which case the generator component becomes dominant; the motor acts as a generator inverting the direction of its current and forcing it into the battery.

>The typical situation is the one of a heavy vehicle rolling on a sharp downhill slope and forcing the motor to turn fast enough that the CEMF becomes larger than the battery voltage. As soon as the motor overcomes the battery it inverts the current direction and starts feeding current into the battery, while developing a counter torque that acts as a brake. This phase is called regeneration (recharging of the battery).

Lots of wrong information here.
To take it easy
Motor max = power at low and mid speed
Motor min = brake power at low and mid speed
Battery max = power at high speed
Battery min = brake power at high speed. 

And try to get a basic understanding of duty cycle to understand how motor and the battery amps work together. At 100% duty cycle motor and battery work at the same amps. At 50% motor works at double the amps then the battery. At 25% the motor is at 4 times the amps then the battery. The faster the motors rotate the higher the duty cycle. 

@Eboosted if your brakes lock now too early at low and mid speed then lower your Motor min.

@Ackmaniac I lowered battery min (regen) from -10A to -8A and increased motor min (regen) from -40A to -50A and it's braking much better at high and mid speeds still very controllable, does this sounds correct to you?

## \#53 Posted by: Ackmaniac Posted at: 2017-06-13T10:06:34.544Z Reads: 495

```
Then the motor min was simply too low for you. If you raise the battery min now to -10 again you should get stronger brakes at high speed. At low speed they will as they are right now. 
So i recommend to only change one value at a time. Otherwise you get wrong impressions.

@Maxid can you tell me how would it exceed the current if the series wire is not placed in the mid of the pack,  coz im building a carver too, and my battery pack is inspired by whitepony (4 strips) and connect them in series at the end part (haven't connect them yet, still waiting for braid flat wire)...
 This will be my first build,  i have no idead about the wire should be place in the middle.

with 4 nickel strips your series connection should be able to handle 60A continuously (15A per nickel strip) - that should be plenty so it doesn't matter where you connect the wires. Make sure to put some spots of solder on the last nickel strip before you spot weld it to the other ones - will make your life a lot easier ;)

How do you like the Board?

[/quote]

I'm still waiting on the bearings and spring retainers which I didn't get on my first order, it's been a month and a half since I placed the order for the street carver and 15 days since Ted told me he had shipped the pending parts to Lima Per√∫, so I'm still waiting to get them, as waiting even more was not an option I had to take some expensive decisions:

- Purchased 8 x R6ZZ bearings US$ 45
- Ordered a fabrication of 8 springs retainers from a local workshop US$ 125
- Ordered a fabrication for 4 bearing spacers US$ 40

This was for my street MBS wheels, so I have yet to try the board with the Supestars hubs on pneumatic tires because I don't have the bearings here yet

I'm finding with those mounts I really, really had to wrench down on the set screw and in a certain pattern to get them to stay put. I even broke a bit tightening...Ernesto knows the pattern. 

I think you are right about a crossbar though helping to keep them straight.  I don't have my belts crazy tight either.  One belt is perfectly lined up on pulley but the other has an over hang of about 1mm that I can't tweak out.  Close enough for me though.

I think one of the problems with the misalignment he was telling me is the fact one side of the hangar isn't as square as the other.  So I have one side that will square up pretty good but the other I can never get a right angle with.  

I see you live in Lima, my wife's side of the family live in La Molina and Cieneguilla.  If you want the best beer in Peru try Cerveza Magdalena, its my brother in laws brewery, haha, so I support them 100%

The hangers are forged and polished. This production method doesn't allow super high precision, but therefore super high strength.
In consequence the hangers are not 100% square. @Nowind (Jens)  ads CNCed surfaces for extra precision.

Frank @Trampa the board is really awesome, pretty high quality of parts good stuff, but I'm sorry to say the customer service was not very good, I still haven't received my complete order even after more than 2 months waiting.

I placed the order for my Urban Carver on April 29th, at the time you didn't have spring retainers, I had to manufacture them locally, they were not cheap, the bearings were also missing. None of these items had arrive to me yet.

On May 2nd I sent you an email requesting to change my order from gray to black Innova wheels (to be shipped at a latter time), at the time I placed the order I had to select gray wheels as it won't let me check out because you didn't have the black ones in stock, but the board was shipped with gray wheels anyways nd there's no option for reimbursement or replacement.

Hi, Ted shipped you the bearings and the retainers, but it seams they are on an endless journey. It worries me, that they are still on their way. We might need to send out another parcel, using a priority service.
The black wheels are still not in stock and we can't sell or ship what we don't have. Since we make the tires to our specifications, we can't use stock available from tire manufacturers. Some tires look the same than the manufacturers stock tires, but feature a different inner construction. So we usually buy in thousands, which is time consuming in production. We wait for the entire order to be processed, so we can ship everything in one big container. 
Better to have a board on grey wheels, which wear out anyway than having a board on no wheels. 
I would love to have the black ones as well! Till then I will ride my grey ones. BTW, they look ace when colouring up the text and the ring with a black marker.

@Eboosted

I'm a little unsure of how exactly you made this waterproof? I saw the link for the membrane. You mentioned that you were using double sided tape. So did you lay the entire membrane over the battery or did you just run a strip where it directly meets the deck? I'm assuming you'd want to fill up the space in the middle so batteries are jumping around. So here is what I envisioned.

Lay entire membrane across battery enclosure with high strentgh double sided tape on top and bottom. 

Let me know if I have this right haha. Thanks man!

To be honest, I tried to use the membrane with double sided tape and it was impossible, the membrane won't stick with any double sided tape, so I took it off. 

I'm thinking about using contact adhesive next time I open the enclosure. 

For now I'm using adhesive neoprene for the borders only

What I did had problems with were the "flat braided cables" I used to connect each 1S4P packs, they became brittle with time and eventualy got broken, so I replaced them with 14AWG silicone 2 cables and the have been working like a charm.

I studied the tavel-safe posibility for a long time, at the end it was not worth it:

1. A modular battery would always be less reliable due the number of conexions for battery packs and BMS wires
2. If you decide to travel with the battery disassembled, you will face the decision of: the airline and TSA agent, so you could loose the battery between flights at the exist or return.
3. You will have to break the law if you decide to travel with the battery disassembled unless you pass a certification with would cost several thousand dollars
4. If you battery ever turns on fire during flight you put at risk hunders of lives and if you land without casualties you will be facing a huge sentence

Is it worth it?, not at all.

Are there any options?, yes:

1. Ground ship your batteries prior your flight
2. Have two batteries ready, one at the destination and one at home, push your esk8 between battery swaps
3.

Not impossible to make a reliable - modular - legal pack with lipos, but I would say very hard with lion 18650's as they are so small individually. For Lion you could make your own packs that are under 99wh with your own label, while physically in the rules I'm not sure they would be legally.

I have a dual motor with 2x130kv motor 65A max
2 focbox 60Amax
Motor pulley 15t and wheel pulley 66t on 200mm diameter wheel I think it is 8" 
I don't use bms > external balance charge wit I charger 1010b

I seen that some say they it's ok to go over the 15A of discharge for the 30Q cell. What about you are you over this limit? 

If you want I just created a post with pictures of my build on electric-skateboard builder 
It is one of the latest from today 

Thanks for your help :slight_smile:

According to Mooch [test](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/samsung-inr18650-30q-15a-3000mah-bench-test-results.681259/), the 30Q are a pretty good 20A discharge bsattery.

**Bottom Line**
**Though rated at 15A by Samsung, to ensure low operating temperature and long life, this is a pretty good 20A continuous discharge rating (CDR) cell.**

Youstill don't say if it's a 6355, 6365, 6374 or 6384 motor or what's the max watt it handles

Thx for the link It's more reassuring. 
And for the motors it's two 6374 with 3550w each and 14 poles each

The just increase the motor current to 90A and the battery current to 50A, this would give you a huge bump in torque and overall power

yep no prob :slight_smile: do you use any fuse between your battery and your VESCs ? i  have a power switch with a 40A fuse but it's clearly not enough. it is a car blade fuse but i have also a 50A fuse from boat battery system that support a 50A continuous and can resist till 120 if it is momentary

I'm very new to all this, and this could be a dumb question, but what is that component sitting on top of your BMS in your pictures? The main positive lead comes out of it. I've learned a LOT from this thread and some additional reading, but I don't quite know what that one part is lol

ohhhhh, that makes sense! I see the wires now. Where would you suggest getting one of these? And another quick question, how are you giving input to both ESC's? I see the signal wire from the rx going to one of the ESC's, but not the other.. is that just the picture or do you have a master/slave setup?

Where'd you get your motor mounts? I'm contemplating of doing a build like this sometime in near future, I already have the default Trampa Urban Carver setup with 7" pneumatics.

@Eboosted as always, amazing work! How does the Trampa Street Carver feel compared to a more traditional longboard setup? I've never had the chance to ride anything more exotic than a regular longboard.

Springs for steering have a completely different feeling than urethane bushings, you do not have enough stability at high speeds however going full speed over cracks in the road or Speed bumps is an amazing feeling you don't have to slow down almost never

@Eboosted 
How did you charge the batteries for the board?
Also, I think it would be a great idea for you to make a step by step instructed youtube video on how to make and assemble the board in its entirety.

You use a BMS and then charge it with a normal charger.

Builds like these takes weeks to make and perfect, and are never done so its not really possible to make a video of it.

I tried, but its simply to meh to record it.
