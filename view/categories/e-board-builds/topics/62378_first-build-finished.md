Nice build. Post some pics. And how much was the investment? 
Did you use inner bearing inside wheel pulley?

These are the bearings I used inside the wheel pulleys.

Good looking build.  About the bolts, you can use a dremel and a cut off wheel to make them the exact size you want.

Nice looking build! Some Re-Fly's with the green core would look sick on this.
