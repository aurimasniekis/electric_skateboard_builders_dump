I originally wanted to build a hybrid street / pneu trampa carver and bought a few parts but then my plan was radically altered when I bought the Lacroix deck.

- Street wheels on the Lacroix is not doable without massive risers so I had a set of Abec11 97mm with dual drive pulleys and no use for it.
- I had a pair of focboxes but then I fell for the ESCape and got into the group buy for a pair.
- I had a leftover 82cm deck from Leiftech / Neversummer.
- I had a unused 7S6P Samsung 22P battery with a defective BMS that came with the Leiftech. They replaced it but never bothered to send me a return label to reclaim it, even though I reminded them a few times.

With all these parts laying around I decided to get into the used parts market, to complete a build with the cheapest parts I could find. The idea being that all the mistakes I would do on that build, I wouldnt repeat on the Lacroix build.

- Found some Paris clones with a motor mount for 25€.

- Found a 10€ ABS enclosure - failed experiment from electricboardsolutions.com.

- Found a dirt cheap Racestar 200 kv motor. Speed is not the goal here anyway.

But when I assembled it all, and got onto it the deck cracked. I shouldnt have stripped the glass fiber top sheet to make it flexier I guess. Silly me.

Started looking on the used market for a deck and found this little beauty, not the cheapest deck I could find but it looks like a lot of fun.

Wheelbase being a lot shorter I had to get another enclosure and settled for the little beast enclosure from eskating.eu. I had to reshape it quite a bit with a heat gun because it needed a lot more concave and internal volume

 I also had to repack the battery into a 10S4P because the 7S6P was too voluminous.

everything fits in real tight.

I can't ride it yet. My bullet 5.5mm order is still stuck in customs.

This is hella badass.  May I recommend a handle under the nose?  It'll be your favorite board

He could also use the front truck as the handle

Nah, the truck gets all dirty and stuff.  If you put a [drawer handle](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/essentra-components/18457/RPC2479-ND/7688896) in front of it, it's _so much better_

The truck can be all covered with mud and grime and the handle will still be clean
