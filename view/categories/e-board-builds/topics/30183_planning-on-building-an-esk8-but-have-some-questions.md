I want to build an esk8 I've been doing some reasearch on parts and I understand all the mechanical things but not the electrical stuff. I've recently found this kit diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/pro2-30mph-kit/#whatvescconnectors. It says that it has everything needed to create a 30mph board but I'm not sure everything needed is there so if you guys can just check it and give me some helpful tips and advice.

It has everything you need to create a single drive system.  I'm not sure why there is a canbus cable, you only need that for dual systems, but it has everything else you need.

It doesn't include a male to male cable needed for the VESC is what I thought but maybe I'm wrong. Also does the setup have the capabilities to hit 30 mph if I weight around 130lbs

Yep!  Looks like pretty much everything you need.  Agree it's odd to add the canbus cable for dual setup.

I'd either upgrade to a single 6374, or maybe you want to go dual 6355 later?

If you want to go dual later - then you are set since you have the canbus already...  ;)

Also are there any downhill boards that are reccomemmend. (Not heavy)
```

you aren't heavy, or you want a light board?

asking for deck suggestions is like asking which is better - blondes or redheads.  (personal preference!  and redheads btw).

I'd go to daddies board shop and look at decks you like.  I suggest downhill decks w/ wheel clearance - so those w/ cutouts are easiest to run bigger wheels without risers.  Recommend stiff vs flex (easier, but a deck with some flex is doable too).

12s2p is a bit weak IMO even with 30q cells - how heavy are you and do you plan to ride up hills?

I am 130 lbs and I do not plan to go up many hills just very low grade ones. I just want a fast board with a distance of around 10-15 miles

Yes - a single motor 6374 will have more power than a single 6355.

but the single 6355 will be easy to fit a second later if you want dual motors.  If you go 6374, you would need to run second motor dual diagonal, or use DIYes 218mm extended caliber clone trucks.

I've never heard anyone say they don't like the Landyachtz Top Speed.

The 12s3p will have more amps so more torque and speed.  If your gonna go dual eventually Id suggest the 12s3p or 12s4p.

... they use different wheels. (Flywheel / flywheel clones vs Orangatang Kegel).

It depends on what wheels you're planning on using.

i don't like the lanyachtz top speed...

hehehe.

Actually reminds me of the arbor vangheusen (or however you spell) shape.  Good looking deck.  BUT not much wheel clearance vs dual cutout deck.  So depending on wheels you want to run it may not be the best without big risers (not my favorite).

Yes dual diag.
kegel/abec - Different wheels - google them.  one is 80mm, the other is 76, 83, 90, 97mm options w/ the same hub to mount gear.

battery - if on budget - lipo.  Also check with @barajabali for custom 18650 packs to see what he suggests (the expert).  Likely more $, but maybe not depending.  

Redheads are crazy scary and so awesome all at the same time!

Higher voltages are prone to more issues though so maybe 10s would be better

Take a chance to look around https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/all/, @kenn . Your best bet is to buy a top mount / downhill deck with not much flex.

I personally use Earthwing Superglider and I'm very happy with it. I'm actually not a big fan of some LY decks; their W-concave is really aggressive.

"more issues" - burnt DRV if >60k ERPM w/ VESC 4.xx

60k ERPM ~= 10s 190kv, 12s 168/149kv to stay below.  Or lower kv always works if you find.  lower kv = slower, so pay attention to your gearing.

gearing - figure out your target speed and gears.  esk8.it calculator

@kenn Look at the 5S 5000mah 25c packs at hobbyking.com, but they you are getting into soldering and making harness cables...so be prepared.

I'd stick with the kit then.  Also, You can use the chat function on the DIY site to ask them specific questions about what parts come in the kit and what else you might need.  Or just ask Dexter here (@torqueboards).

So if I choose the 6374 motor and a 12s3p battery would that work since these choices are different from the kit

I would assume the phase wire connectors are the same on both motors, but I would ask Ralph or Dexter in the DIY chat to make sure.  The same for the battery packs, the are probably both XT90 or XT60.

Just to throw in a reference here, I have a DIYElectric 6355 190kv motor, 12s1p of Zippy compact batteries in a 4x3s 5000mAh, and I haven't hit top speed yet.  I've rode a total of 11.8 miles (varied speed) and I'm sitting at about 47% on my voltage meter :3

Fastest I've gone is 25.6 mph, lowkey scared to go faster without more than my bike gloves and helmet lol

I am also light (140lbs)  and it charges up hills for the most part, plan to upgrade to dual 6355 later for better brakes (they are really just average rn) and better hill climbing.  However, I've done a few short 20% hills no problem.

That's the connector type, your good.  Did you ask about the moro phase wire connections?

They said the 6374 motor is compatible so the connections must be the same?

Its safe to assume that the phase wire connections are the same.  Every motor I've ever bought from Dexter has had 5.5mm connectors, and I've bought a dozen or so.

Make sure you get the correct motor mounts for the trucks you get, the 218mm trucks use a different motor clamp than the standard caliber II trucks.  I would suggest getting the normal caliber II tucks to start.  They are more standard, people will be better able to help during the build process, it will look better on a regular longboard.
