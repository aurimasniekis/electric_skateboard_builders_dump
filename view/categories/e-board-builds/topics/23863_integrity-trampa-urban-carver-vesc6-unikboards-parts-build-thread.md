Hey ! 

As you know, I mainly post all my builds on my french community that I have created more than 2 years ago as this take a lot of time to maintain information in different places; sorry about that! I also went for a name that means a lot to me "Integrity". That being said, I will post here my build on the Trampa Urban carver. I'm not going to invent the wheel like riding electric skateboard with hooks or stuff like that. For the Urban Carver; Frank, WP, Kaly covered it with so much talent.

I plan to post the build thread here, but also what is often missing is the riding part : how do we ride our jewels The beauty of DIY is that we all can be proud of what we achieve; no-one is genius and has every skills but bringing people together, learning from each other is what I love about our communities. That's the same for riding. No-one car who is the best rider, it's all about respect and having a blast... while we last ! We all have also different riding styles, so that would be my thread to share with you on this. 

We all have to start somewhere ! I may modify the build while progressive but that what I got to start with

My target is to keep it lean and light, probably 12S4P or less... 20km; 40 to 50 km/h top speed

edited: some slights wording and phrasing to make it "better" for english people!

Looking forward to following the progress of this thread.
Ever since you built your little AT-Beast I've been wanting to build something similar, but I haven't figured out which trucks, hubs and bearings to use. Trampa trucks has 10 and 12mm axles while regular Calibers have 8mm axles.

Would you mind posting a detailed parts list?

sure, for the AT beast it's straightforward. Trampa trucks Infinity 10mm axles; superstars hubs - 8'inch wheels primo; my two trampa compatible mounts & drivers, my 35° risers. except the Trampa parts which are already insane; the remaining parts are available in the group buy I opened.

seems I have enough clearance with 8' wheels; but I think the riding experience will be better by changing the mini hanger with a MTB hanger. That's what I'll do

Initially I was going for 12S3P but to be honest; as the board is already not on the ultra light side... 8 (oops it was 12!) cells will not kill the deal and provide more miles (I don't care about the Amps cause I go for 35A VTC5A cells). So I'm now heading on 12S4P on this upcoming little rocket. Just ordered the missing cells from nkon.nl and the BMS from battery support. The VESC6 should be coming in the next days so I will probably have not finished this build; but no worries; I will put them on my existing MTB HolyPro prototype support deck or on my AT beast to have fun with FOC on 12S !

@okp do those Trampa mounts fit both the MTB and mini hangers? I saw the square hole and just assumed they were for the MTB only.

Apologies, would have asked on your group buy thread but I can't seem to reply to that one (probably because I'm a newbie).

eheh; the pack / blocks are not welded; so instead of going 3P; just going 4P :) just ordered additional cells and will solder the last blocks.

the mounts fit the Trampa Infinity MTB trucks hangers (normal/reverse) but not the mini hanger has their is not enough flat area for this design

the group buy thread is acting weird, some people cannot post into it; so don't hesitate to ask here too :)

Not sure if I get you. To increase a 12S battery by 1P you need 12 cells. You said you ordered 8 - which is not enough. Welded or not does not matter.

yeah, I second that. The Trampa enclosure is also really good. Loads of space and such a great material.

That's why I like Trampa, you don't have to care about quality, it's already top notch.

I may be looking to do some 3D printed "enclosure termination" to fill the gap on each side. Solution provided by Frank with neoprene seems also perfect, but 3D print will enable me to get this little extra finish.

Nice one OKP! You are faster than me. As I can see, you have the MTB Hangers mounted, springs in outer position.
What I would recommend is putting extra inserts in for the bindings.
Do you need the grip design I made for the Street Carver?

Which gaps? The ones in the enclosure? 0.5mm silicon sheet on the inside, that's it.

Grip design will be plotted to PDF tomorrow.
Can't wait to find the time to finish my board.
Lots of work on my desk....
Have you seen the Scooters on our page?

the scooters looks insane as every trampa stuff in reality.

Research the silicone mat well @okp, I've found and bought a 1mm-thick one for less than 1EUR per 10x20cm piece, which gives like around 10EUR for a 70x30cm sheet. My source is here, Poland: http://allegro.pl/100x200mm-gr-1mm-plyta-mata-silikonowa-uszczelka-i6760942841.html

1mm is quite thick. EBay is also full of the silicone sheets. Terra elastic training band is also silicone. Nearly nicked my wife's one...
I don't know if Sika will stick to our material.

Tell me plz how much stiffer did it get with the Trampa roadside enclosure with the cut pattern you've utilised?
Or to be more precise: What ply count is the deck? How many "plys" of stiffness did the enslosure add?

thanks bro. I went for 4 plies for enclosure. @trampa gave really great advices as usual. I'm proud of this build and proud to use VESC6. Thanks Ted, Benjamin, Frank for making this happen. There's really no glory on my side except bringing hooks to the esk8 scene. But man, I'm just back from a ride  and I'm just happy.

thanks bro. Its pretty a journey to design prototypes part; build boards; ride; film; edit; post; continuing to develop the ESK8FR community that's been here for few years now with a 7 to 8PM job.

the V6 are dopeness in 12S; BLDC 12S with sensored motors is awesome too; I was a bit surprised by the fact that's it is still pretty silent on V6 Hybrid mode too.

That was my yesterday's quick ride on an extension of my home spot

Hey @okp I have a couple of questions:

1. Why didn't you use these hangers? They would allow to use street wheels as well as the would be 9.525mm axle, besides they are also 16"

2.  Are those 6374 motors? 

3. What the maximum ERPM you have set on the VESC 6, are you taking advantage of the 150k ERPM limit of it?

4. I'd love to see this board on b lo acknowledged hubs with black 7" Evolve Knobby tires.

5. Why did you choose the holy pro deck? The hola would make building your enclosure sealed a PIA

Hey,
1) I use these hangers on my builds; these are the ATB hangers.
2) Yes
3) By default; Max speed I measured on my ride was about 59km/h and I could go way faster
4) Yeah, I'll try them soon but I really like the Trampa Primo wheels. So consistent.
5) I'm building now a HolyPro deck for a customer but I went the Urban Carver. To be honest; both looks dope and no problem to seal the enclosure.

That was my morning rushes

```
Yes because unfortunately I'm not able to build motors in my 2x2 apartment

No because Maytech is a brand and there's no French word to translate a brand. UNiK Polaris is the name I've chosen to OEM some Maytech motors of my selection. That would be a more appropriate statement. For the 6355 motors, all credits go to Jason back in the years.

sorry for the late reply; I'm in a kitesurf trip in Sicilia !

Trucks are Trampa Infinite MTB with reverse hanger (to get a more roadster feeling). Yeah it's exactly the same build but a clone. That's the 001 for one of my customer (mine being 000/Proto !)

Nice build, can I ask what type of tape(white) is used across the cells? I've seen it used as a structural but it's not kapton, love to know what it is to have some around instead of hot glue

**edit:** Probably 3M™ Glass Cloth Electrical Tape
Designed to operate in 600 volt dry applications requiring high mechanical strength and resistance to high temperatures

thanks @Riako

Back from Sicilia for my kitesurfing trip. Was a blast ! 

I did a quick startup from 0 vs an Evolve GT in GT mode... well... there's no even a comparison. Really!

getting prepared for the Trampa wheels ! The VESC6 are still performing flawlessly. Just did 40km easily around Paris. The remaining 1200mAH where used to pull from zero speed a friend of mine that had no more power in his Evolve GT.

The rolling resistance of urethane wheels... can't beat that, same board would probably drain batteries in half of that distance with pneumatics. That's awesome my friend! Those flywheels look dope 👌🏻

Cool build.  A couple of questions I am doing this same build...12s4p Urban/Street Carver 

**Wiring:**
 1) Battery packs 1&2, 3&4, 5&6, 7&8, 9&10, 11&12 -- you have those connected serially.  Do you just make an (2) 4p and then join them together and butterfly them open?
 
2) Between 10 & 11 for example you have 12 awg wire between the middle of inner two parallel cells of each pack?

3) Where do you place the balance lead from the BMS on each pack?

I apologize for my noob questions but I am tried looking around all the Kaly, whitepony and similar 12s4p build threads and didn't get the full gist of the electronics.

EDIT: This diagram does help a lot but I am still curious where the balance leads go on each 4p.

**Trampa Battery mount enclosure**
Frank and other build threads have them cutting the enclosure in the middle and staggering with hole+side only slit, how come you didn't do that.

How much do you love the VESC6 ?

Hey mate, of course. I went for the street carve deck because the look was a bit different but that's the same

I did this one for a customer; check his insta, he seems to be really happy. He's now also getting 107mm like I do.

Back from holidays. Recovery was hard ! It's freezing cold in Paris.

I'm cleaning my little 3x3m square room that I use for all the R&D and did some maintenance. I put some beautiful Trampa 156kv to give them a try in AT mode.

Happy to be back on my board. With my trip to Brazil, then working on new projects, the poor and cold weather in Paris, I didn't have time to ride my good old board. I did this board almost 8 months now and it's still performing to my expectations. Huge power, sleek and of course my hooks that I put on all my boards since the beginning. The Trampa 154kv are performing really well. I did 30km this morning and I cannot be more happy with them at this time.

Merry Xmas all and thanks for the continued support.

How does your battery pack mitigate the flex. I assume it’s spot welded. Is it segmented?

Yes, I've designed the pack like 12 months ago. It integrates segmentation of cells blocks with neoprene and give a perfect flex. I'm now asking a company in France to build them for me and ensure quality is top notch. I used the same exact technique when I did probably the first flexible pack for the Evolve Bamboo early this year. Pretty happy how this turned out.
