Hi everyone.

I had a FOCBOX delivered from Enertion a couple days ago and I'm just about to update the firmware etc. I'm completely lost on what to do.

There appears to be multiple hardware types. Which one do I select? It says that installing the wrong stuff can seriously mess up the FOCBOX. I don't want that.

Please help!

Thanks,
Daniel

First you need to tells us what tool you are using to update the firmware.  The focbox is a 4.12  hardware  Also this topic has been covered alot recently and I'm pretty sure it is covered in the noob question thread and in the Vesc walkthrough thread
