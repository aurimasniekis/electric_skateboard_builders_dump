Pics? Sounds like it is not centered correctly. It one bolt is tighter than the other.

Make sure it is as flat as possible. A video would be useful

It may just be me, but it doesn't really look like it's wobbling.

its quite hard to see in the video but its wobbly so slightly, if you look at the wheel its slightly more noticeable. The pulley wobbles the whole wheel

Yeah I see the very slight wobble, but it doesn't look that bad, I have a slight wobble on my wheel too but it doesn't effect my performance... But my pulley has a flange...

i feel a bit worried because its wobbling the wheel too and the faster it spins the more noticeable the wobble is

The is a slight one. Measure the distance from the wheel to the outside of the pulley around the whole circumference. Then adjust accordingly.

Is the pulley for kegels? Is it printed?
```

its for kegel and 3d printed, abs and nylon

It could just be an inconsistency in the print. I am assuming there is no way of moving it?

Measure from the end of the pulley, to the outer diameter wheel -- all the way around, if there is one side which is has more "space" than another side/area, then you know that the pulley has an issue and it has to be adjusted.

Unfortunately, this is why people don't print pulleys, inconsistencies can cause issues in the end, it's usually less of a hassle to buy one.

It may just be something you have to live with, have you tested it out? Does it get dangerous when at high speed?

at the moment i don't have all my equipment to test it out, but i will see how it goes. Could it be cause of the spacer? my spacer kind of wobbles around in the middle of the wheel and i use the truck to centre it

No all spacers are like that... shouldn't be a problem.

I have had clone wheels that wobbled terribly. 
But yours  are name brand wheels, so let's assume they're good.
1: make sure you have good bearings that aren't wobbly.  
2: if you can't tighten the axle nut all the way down tight without binding the bearings then you either need longer spacers or add some thrust washers to the spacers. Also the spacers should be close to 8mm i.d. to work properly. 
Because the wheel and pulley are wobbling together,
I don't think the pulley alignment is the problem however, if the inside bearings mount on the pulley and not the wheel, then the pulley could be defective.
Make sure steps 1 and 2 and if it still wobbles, you either have a defective pulley or wheel depending where the bearing mounts.

It looks more like your bearing's problem. The mess of the 3D printed pulley are not likely to make the wheel wobble. Just follow what @Namasaki said, you should be fine.

looks like the wheels wobbling not the pulley, like mine does and im using enertion wheels and pulleys that fit perfectly together,there must be some wheels out there that are just not perfect unfortunately.

i think it may be one of my bearings. The bearing has indented cause i tightened the bold too tight

here's a top tip: Set the camera down when recording shit.   

From the video you can't tell if it's the pulley or the wheel or camera moving about.

the moving was the pulley, i was only trying to get different angle

I have tried to video excessive wheel wobble with my iphone camera and it just doesn't show up in the video and looks a lot less than it really is.

Mount your belt and motor on to see if the wobble has an effect at all. Mine wobbles a bit like that, but my belt doesn't move back and forth when my motor spins.
