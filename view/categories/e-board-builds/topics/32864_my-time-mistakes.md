Make sure the parts you buy really do fit together well.

Particularly important and a great source of frustration for me were motor mounts, motors and pulleys.

Does the pulley and belt fit together well and all the motor to turn properly? I bought a motor mount kit for $400 @torqueboards and the 450 belt just wouldn't fit between the 72T large pulley and motor pulley. I tried every means possible and the motor shaft would rub against the edge of the mounting plate.  In the end, I had to order a larger belt 470mm which was too loose..lol. Returned those and then ordered another set of 460mm belt.  I had to also drill a hole for a tensioner because this belting solution wasn't just perfect.

Your motors, are they 8mm shaft or 10mm shaft? 8mm is what works with many motor mount kits out there using HTD 5m pitch motor pulleys.  You can get 10mm shaft pulleys but they are special order or get them from China/Ebay.  The conundrum is that many vendors here are sourcing parts from Alibaba, Bang good or other places in China where they get those 6374 or 6355 motors which are RC motors for cars.  They usually have a 10 mm shaft.  Get the wrong size shaft... and you got motors sitting around or have to order special pulleys.  This was the most painful.

Do your motors fit with your motor mount? 63mm or 50mm.  How about the shaft length, key size if there is one.  Again more motors sitting around the house...lol.  I bought @Nowind direct drive and ordered 6374 motors and the shaft was too long to fit on one side and the motor to long to fit an Urban Carver truck.  Not his fault, I was warned, but the motors he recommended were out of stock so I tried to just pick another guessing it would work. This can be avoiding by measuring before ordering. 

These were the most expensive lessons I faced.  Everything else is pretty OK... the VESC/ESC's, batteries, etc... they are highly flexible believe it or not.

But the motors and transmissions... be very, very careful about fit.

@Nix get a real enclosure and not just a tupperware box or a repurposed case. Better to spend $50-$70 and get it right the first time. 

Also, get a deck that you love. I see so many people building an esk8 with a cheap deck. The deck is the heart of your build. Disclosure: I make and sell decks :slight_smile: 

Don't "finish" the build and go nuts doing speed runs on your first day. The first few times you take your DIYESK8 out, treat it like an experiment that might fail at any time. A lot can go wrong, and you want to identify those problems at 10MPH not 25 MPH.!

Tons of good advice in here. Mine would be take your time, and be patient. It's super easy to get really exited and overlook something or break something when you're first putting your build together because of the anticipation.

You've been waiting for parts for months and now everything is finally here and BY GOD THIS THING WILL BE RUNNING IN THE NEXT HOUR OR GRANNYS GETTING THROWN OFF THE ROOF.

Chill out, relax, if you run into a snag leave it till tomorrow or ask for some advice instead of pushing forward at the potential cost of breaking something.

LOL'ed at that. I ride less in summer because it get hot under a helmet. I'm looking forward to autumn and winter here in Southern California.

My mistake was not drilling at a slight angle to compensate from the deck's concave. It caused excessive stress on my enclosure and cracked near the holes. Next mistake was screwing in ALL eight screws of the enclosure again, and again, and again and again when I had to fix or adjust things. my recommendation, add and external USB port if you have the room.

Well, I have opposite experience...I hook up my lipos in like under a minute and after about 35 minutes I have them fully charged and ready to go. That's 10A parallel charging of 2x 4S 5000mAh. And they give me 15 kilometres of range while discharged to 3.75V.

I'm planning to go after 10S4P of 30Q's which with 12Ah should extend the range to 30km. That's a whole week of trips to work and back for me (6km per day). I'll build two 5S4P 12Ah batteries and I can charge them in parallel at 1C @ 24A.
That's not what I'll be able to do because my charger is 20A max with external server PSU. :)

How long would BMS take to charge up the 10S4P 12Ah pack? Chargers are like 4 - 6 A max, right?

Discharging lipos to 3.0V per cell is bad in the long run. Basically after 3.6 - 3.7V you start to loose performance big time. You should feel there's lack of top end power. You must realize that when your battery indicator shows you for example 3.8V when standing still, you easily go below 3.7V while riding...

Even if you buy a BMS with bigger charging current (like 35A) you can charge only as fast as your fast charger can handle. These are usually 4A. Correct?

I use a setup similar to this: 
https://static.rcgroups.net/forums/attachments/5/5/3/9/1/4/a9232900-114-charger.jpg

When going on vacations or other locations I can easily take them with me. I could even fit them in my backpack just a little on the heavy side to ride with. But it's doable.

I can even use a bigger lipo battery to power the charger...like 2x 4S lipos in parallel with 10Ah which power the charger. Even better for remote charging, you don't need to look for places to hook up...just crash wherever you like.
Like this:

i think it depends on what you want/need. lipos for sure are a good choice for a lot of people but not so much in my case. i want to use my board mainly for daily commuting and for this a set-and-forget battery solution is IMHO what you should be looking for. but because i had no experience with lipos and wanted to stay within my budget, i got two 5s lipos. turns out this was not the best choice. 

first of all: charging. riding around town and my battery is dying? without bringing a charger along, i won't be able to give my board a charge. and even if i should do that, i would still have to take my board apart (wanted my lipos to be removable so i went without charging ports). for sure something i would like to avoid in a busy environment like college or starbucks. apart from that for most of us its not enough to charge only one battery. imagine you would have to catch a bus in 30 minutes and want to charge your batteries while still having to do other stuff. this would require you to charge the first battery for 15 minutes, then you would have to stop whatever you are doing to disconnect the first battery and connect the second, continue your work and after another 15 minutes you are ready. this would highly annoy me! a bms could fix this problem, but when you are going with a bms, i don't see any reason not to use liions.

next: discharging. i always balance charge my lipos but after riding the cells almost always end up unbalanced. sometimes more, sometimes less. last time i had to stop because one cell dropped to 3.4V while all of the others were still at 3.75V. that's a lot of power i wasn't able to use because i wanted to save my lipo. don't get me wrong, i don't want to blame lipos in general. this is probably the fault of my charger or a dead cell. but as i said, this is my first experience with lipos and not particularly a good one.

size. 5s lipos are pretty thick.

assembly/disassembly/storage. i keep my lipos in a lipo safe bag. a full charge/ride/store-cycle i have to plug and unplug 24 xt's and balance connectors, monitor the batteries while charging, fit the batteries in my enclosure, ... for me that's just too much of a hassle and not worth it for short rides to the next supermarket or so.


okay, sorry, got a little bit carried away. in short: i have been looking for that just-grab-the-board-and-ride feeling and lipos don't offer that for me.

@High-roller God the budget thing is so true ! I thought I'd spend around 600$ when i begun. I'm well over 2000$ today. This includes also 400$ of lost/wasted parts by third parties (_I won't name Marcin Sleziak, that damn f**ker or Flier with bad quality here - oops I did_).  

@Nix Some advices to add to the group (I'm starting to sound redundant over threads) : 

- Prepare a proper thermal management for your VESC whatever model you use. 4.12 is good for FOC only if you cool down properly FETs and shunts. If you won't cool it, use BLDC and try your best not to go above 40-50A to save some troubles. 
When using FOC on 4.12, low kv motor (under 150kv) is less stressful for the VESC. 
4.xx is flawed design due to FETs concentrating heat face to face ; **when applying heatsinks, cool the solder joints, PCB and metal sockets only**. Don't bother cooling the black top of FETs. The plastic black casing of FETs won't allow any heat transfer no matter what you mount on it. That's why Chaka uses DirectFETs with all metal casing to be able to directly heatsink on top of the FETs.

- Check your batteries max charge rating and set your VESC regen braking max current close to it. This will enhance your battery life cycle and prevent thermal runaways. If braking strength is not enough, you should consider a dump system to burn excessive regen current, and then raise VESC max regen current accordingly.

- If you use Lipos, prepare a properly enclosed area to charge them or charge them outside ; better keep an eye or easy access. Be extra careful if Lipos becomes puffed. Remember you are packing hundreds of Wh : if it burns it will do for a long time. It is reliable only when properly cared about. I'm too lazy for this much maintenance so Li-ion is more forgiving for dummy users like me.

- Do not use a Bluetooth Nano remote because it is freaking buggy and will throw you out of your board. Too many members complaining about it despite the compact look. Many members use GT2B remote with "sparkle mod", it is big but not too shabby ; I remember having seen a GT2E mod which was more compact and still reliable. I can't talk about the new OLED remotes. 

- Always power your receiver ON first then your board second. Always turn your board OFF first then your receiver second. 

- Either use an XT90 antispark or an upgraded antispark switch PCB (the standard one is good up to 40A continuous) ; relays and fuses DIY solution is super reliable too if done correctly. Circuit breaker is big but a cheap and reliable solution too. Don't overlook antispark switch if you use one. All your current has to flow through its FETs so get a good quality one or it will fail.

- Wear a helmet when you start riding what you've built. You **will** fall on your e-boards for sure, better stay safe.

- More generally don't cut on any safety requirements even if it is bothersome to wear / solder / set / plug. 

Good luck ! 

p.s. How pretty is the punctuation of this forum !

There is not 'really" anything wrong with the canbus cable, except, when the cable is or go wrong :smile:.
Mostly ppl having problems with canbus, because the cable or the connection is  or get somehow damaged. 
And if it's damaged, the vesc connection can have a problem, with one of the two motor not spinning or spinning diffrently, stopping or cogging.

The problem is the cable itself is fragile, some try to hot glue the two pin connectors, so the cable-plug wont split.

If you have 2x vesc and canbus, dont ever power only one vesc, when canbus cable is connected, cos it will probably fry the not powered vesc, by this canbus cable.

Some have general problems, when using Canbus not related to cable itself.

That';s why, many ppl play it safe, and go split servo ppm, so the reciver is connected to both vesc's.

I made two boards, with double vesc/motors on each with canbus connection, and it's working fine ever since.

Sometimes, you just may get unlucky with hardware....

```
As @Tomash said, its really hit or miss, you could go along and build using canbus without any problem, but as soon as it happens you'll be jaded from using can for dual setup. 

Another point that Tomash missed was that in canbus config, if your master goes down, you lose control of slave as well. In a split ppm config, if you lose one, you'll always have the other still functioning. Both ESCs are operating independently and are unaware of the other. 

For a split ppm configuration for dual motors, you need to make sure that you clip/disconnect one of the +5v rails on the ppm cable. Do a search for split ppm and you'll find a huge thread on it with some of my pics.

Yeah I'm referring to discharging the lipos to about 3.2 or 3.1 volts under load, which is probably about 3.4 volts not under load. So far I haven't had any problems with that, although as you said I do notice a power reduction after 3.6 volts, but that's just my cue to start heading home and conserving battery.

Correct. The only difference is that @ 3.6V my batteries are already back on the charger. :slight_smile: 
Below 3.8 - 3.85V per cell I'm starting to lose the top end power and with 245 kV motor that's all I have so yeah...the biggest benefit are the 97mm wheels which just keep on rolling so that way I can manage the battery quite good, keeping the flow going.

Plan the build during Oct, Nov, Dec.
Order your parts January when online and local retailers have their sales.
Pay the extra 3-5 bucks for ePacket/Express delivery (7-16 days).
This will give you enough time to build changes and upgrades.
Have a backup supplier/alternative pasts incase you items don't show up.
You should finish your build at the latest. Mid April.
I prescribed to this and didn't get my eBike on the road till the 2nd week of May. The bike seat, I had to purchase locally.

Time to start researching what you want to build this winter....

 In your opinion, enertions focbox which i believe has direct fets with an aluminum heat sink box is no good for foc? How would i further cool it?

Realize that you're on a board and that hard breaking will stop the board pretty quick, but you will keep flying. Test and adjust your settings a little at a time.

For me it was know how long order times are.  I ordered a TON of parts through users here (want to support those who innovate!) but some things came from Europe so I ended up waiting 2 weeks for one part to get me going...

Practice soldering!  I know others have mentioned it but I wasted a solid 2-3 XT-90s's due to my shitty soldering.

Know what you want to get out of the board.  For me, a 6s with a 12 mile range was PLENTY with a solo 295kv motor. It was an inexpensive build (sub $500 I believe) but I have quality parts (FocBox, 2 8000mAh lipos, aluminum motor mount, etc).  I can EASILY upgrade motor/batteries and keep it cheap as my other pieces can be reused. 

If you know  you typically 'ramp up' from one item to the next (i.e. start small then want to get a bigger/nicer board) buy parts that may be a bit oversized for now, but can later be used to their full potential!  It isn't hard to get inexpensive motor mounts by people here on the forum that will last the life of the board.

Sorry I didn't see your question before. Actually since FOCBOX is DirectFET equipped it should be, just like Chaka's DirectFET, pretty reliable for FOC. Hardware is well built. But as you notice, it is rated by Jason/Enertion to max 60A continuous. 

In this area aluminum case alone is both a blessing and a bottleneck for cooling. Either you are able to enhance the cooling of the case itself, thus counter the heat dissipated through it, or you remove the case and prepare for a more aggressive cooling solution. I bet it could be at least 80A continous ready with a better thermal management and different materials to complete the weaknesses of aluminum.

For example I did experiment cooling down passively a Peltier module's hot side ; aluminum alone is a quick cooker if you saturate it, thus better than nothing but no more cooling. The same happens with FETs. 

What kind of build do yuo have? You could simply attach a large fan to your FOCBOX too, would help in any case.

My build integrates what i hope is a 'waterproof ' enclosure. That means the cooling is less than desirable. I cut an additional plate of aluminum (from a giant heatsink) and attached it to the aluminum side of the case hoping more aluminum equals better cooling. Not sure if my 'science ' is on point here though. Then made sure the cooling side is facing the enclosure and added a few Velcro strips to secure (not near the fet's). I hope this will sort of help cooling with a bit of an air gap. What do you think?

IMHO it is directly relevant to your board : will you ride on road or off road? What is your battery / motor setup?

Even with waterproof enclosure it is still rated 60A. Will you draw this much when riding? 40A is enough torque to drop many riders on their back from start. When climbing big hills it is where you will spend more amps, but keeping speed momentum can be very low amps even around 40km/h (ex : full tuck or crouching on board offers low air resistance thus low strain on motors). 

If you run sensorless, you probably push kick a little before take off. That helps shave precious amps too. 

In summary, even with waterproof enclosure your FOCBOX may be enough as it is. 

Now an idea just in case : can you cut a hole in your enclosure to let your added aluminum piece go through and close the gap with silicone joint? You'd gain external air flow and keep water tight. This should help cooling the case.

EDIT : You should open a thread about your build, it will be easier to discuss it there.

Were you able to use it?

I bought 2 different kinds of this USB and both didn't work, BLDC app didn't recognize my VESC.

Yes they did work. Its just extensions. No idea why your computer didn't recognize it

@Multiple_Scoregasm
What do you think? .... 
Ummm, Pictures?

Also .... Make the case out of aluminium with finns, its one of the better heat sinks.
The amount of surface area inside will definitely cause the air to rapidly cool.
