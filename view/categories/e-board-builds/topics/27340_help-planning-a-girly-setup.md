Hi folks!
Currently I am planning a eSkate setup for my girlfriend. At first I wanted to copy my build (SK3 - 6374-192kv, single motor,16/36T, 10s4p) but I think it is just a waste of money and especially weight because she isnÂ´t looking for that kind of performance. 

Thus IÂ´m searching for the "best" possible setup for:
Range: about 15 km (9 miles)
Speed: Max. 20 km/h (10 mph), her comfort zone ist about 12-15 km/h, no fast acceleration needed! 

She weights about 50kg (110 lbs) - and that should stay this way ;) 

I already got a spare Vanguard Flex 3, Caliber Trucks and 80mm Orangatang kegels! 

Additionally I could spare a SK3 - 6374-192kv. I was thinking about a 6s4p batterie because I like the idea of the possibility to add a 4p4p batterie to get 10s4p incase a friend or me want to use it. There will be a split enclosure and I would leave the space for a later upgrade anyway.

What do you guys think?

Doing the same thing for my girl too atm.
Vanguard flex 1, orangatang kegel, caliber, 6374 192Kv, 15/36 15mm, 10s4p because of range and hill climbing.
Remember sheÂ´ll want more if you climb away on a hill or go a bit faster.
DonÂ´t underbuild.
Go big or go home :smiley:

If you want to underbuild that 192kv a vesc and 6s4p will be fine for 9 miles or you can get a 12s2p pack and limit your amps on vesc for her speed and if she ever wants to go faster you don't have to buy more stuff

http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/esc/alien-150a-2-12s-car-esc-hv-twin-2/
and two turnigy Lipo 3s 5000mah batteries

range +- 10km (you can add 2 more in parallel
max speed 30 km/h

you can also go with 5s or 4s in total so it will have lower top speed

I hope I helped :smile:

My GF rides my old 42" Flex 1 Vanguard.  I just updated (i still ride it occasionally):

2 x 4s 8000mAh 30c Zippy Compacts (great lipos so far)
6374 190kv
VESC 4.7 w/ new 3.2x VESC Tool fw (going to try FOC next)
Nunchuk (she loves thumb control)
80mm Kegels - 15mm single w/ 15/40 iirc.

I want to clean it up a bit wiring wise, but it's solid/reliable and she is cautious enough to keep speeds reasonable (she tops out around 8-10mph).

GL!

on 6S (12s is max) it climbs 9% hill easily (but you run out of battery faster, on 12S or 6S+6S parallel should be fine). In few weeks I'll add 2 more batteries in series, I'll tell you how it works in reply to this topic. 
Once I accidentally run into puddle and nothing bad happened
Ps. make sure to lock nuts, once one of motors fell from hanger and slided on asphalt :grimacing: yet itstill works like new :grin:

For her weight, I recommend a Ollin 5065 or racerstar 5065 motor. I'm using a single 200kv and I weigh 75 kilograms. Paired with a 10s3p battery will give you good range. Depending on your esc, you can limit forward max force to limit top speed. Throw on some pink wheels and it's girly ðŸ’ƒ

Or go for a premade board like the yuneec, backfire, or blink board.
