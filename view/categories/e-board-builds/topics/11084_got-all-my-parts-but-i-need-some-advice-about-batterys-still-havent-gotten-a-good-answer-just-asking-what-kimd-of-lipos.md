I finally got all my parts and this is my first build. https://www.amazon.com/FVT-120A-Brushless-Sensored-Sensorless/dp/B00LWH3YIA

My motor is a 320kv, it got very annoying. My seller didn't inform me he didn't have 270kv so he just sent this out. http://www.hobbygulf.com/emp-n-series-outrunner-brushless-motor-n5065-320kv.html  (ordered of different website, best pic I can find, almost the same)

So whats the best value I should buy for this setup.

Since your kv is so high and you have the fact esc you  only have one option- 6s. If you go higher then 6s you'll see some insane speeds. 

I build custom packs for a lot of people. What is your budget like?

If you can see I have a charger on the top of all my parts in that pic. Not sure if it's a lipo charger I'll have to take a look. But I do know it's connecter is for that xt60 wire.

I'm pretty sure that charger can charge most batteries. Would this be good? I think that charger can charge it

I would change the pulley arrangment to get that high kv motor into usable ranges.
