Alright boys now we start the fun / aggravation / pure bliss

Im going to start off by yes this is my 1st build however im super handy, frugal (not cheap), very detail oriented, and by no means lazy. Project background: Im not trying to make the fastest board out there. I am aware of the law of Diminishing Returns. However, i am an adrenaline junkie so i would like to make a decent board. Somewhere around 20-25mph should be fine. if i wanted to go slower i would just use my non-eboards. =P  As for range, i would like to be able to ride for about 2 hours, not full throttle of course. maybe 25km range? this is a pleasure board not a commuter but that does not mean i wont make an excuse to run errands with it. Im located on the East Coast of Florida so i doubt there is much for hills in my future. I'm 6'1'' and 185 lbs. I am **Absolutely** open to suggestions and encourage it. if i say or do something wrong tell me. much better to fix or do it right the first time. Saves my ever thinning wallet.

Parts will be listed below and updated as i change my mind or order them

**Board**: Landyachtz Ripple Ridge Length 31.75” Width 9.125”  Wheelbase 19.25” (**Ordered**) (**Arrived!**) 
its always nice to go outside and see a package is there! Christmas is here.
I simply fell in love with the shape of this board. maybe its a bit tight in the wheelbase for my 1st? either way i will add her to my sweet board collection. my eBoard needs a kicktail and some decent curves.
