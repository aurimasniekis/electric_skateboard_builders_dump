Hi Everyone!

I'm finally ready to start my first E-Board build, but frankly am unsure of what parts to go with, so I am hoping to get help from this awesome community!

My wants/needs for this board are fairly simple:
I'd like to keep it relatively cheap (sub $300 if possible)
- I feel this budget could be possible as I already have a complete longboard, as well as a friend with a plethora of tools at my disposal (including welding for a motor mount if needed)

I'd like a single motor mount for casual riding
Regenerative Braking (i'm unsure if this is standard with all ESC's)
I'd only be riding around 15mph average (20 if im feeling daring haha)
Ability to climb very minimal hills at an acceptable speed
Hopefully a good amount of milage/ride time if my budget allows it

I understand the concept of not going cheap on components, however i'll be a casual rider on this first build, and I don't need the BEST components around, just the right parts to get me by.

I'm looking forward to growing in this community, and i'd greatly appreciate any help and advice I can get!

Search the board for good used parts. Don't waste your time or money on cheap new parts. They are going to be junk. There are a few guys selling good, proven parts right now.

Torqueboards for mounts (unless you are welding)  and hobbyking for outrunner motors and lipo batteries. Space cell should be good, but its overpriced and you can make it yourself for half the cost. Buy a good charger (genuine IMAX). I would get a 192kv 6374 motor from HK and run it on 6S. with a vesc. Thats what I would do if I could redo my build again. 
VESC-  $100
2* 3S Lipos at 20C- $45
HK outrunner- 90$ ($60-80 is you go for a higher KV)
Motor mount kit from Torqueboards- $75
Separately purchased drive kit- $60 for a 12-15mm belt setup
OR buy torqueboards drive kit which is $120 includes motor mount and belt/pulleys at 9mm
And a charger- 30$ 
Total is gonna round up to $400 with shipping and extra belts and metal bolts plus $100 labor if you time costs money. 
PS you can save: 
$40 on the esc with a 1/8 car esc 
 $80 by making your own motor mount 
$20 on the charger buy buying a 3S charger 
$20 on the motor with going for like 230-295kv
Hope I helped.

awesome thanks for all of the info! and i should be able to make the motor mount via my friend who has the sufficient tools!
As far as my time being worth money, this should be a weekend project, putting it together whenever the time is there, lol.
I may have a battery charger from an old Traxxas RC car, so I may be able to save on that too!

Another question for everyone, how do i decide what pulleys/gears for my wheel and motor? Does the amount of teeth matter when building?

## \#16 Posted by: psychotiller Posted at: 2016-01-13T00:39:10.055Z Reads: 306

```
What size wheels are you going to run?
What kind of wheel?
What voltage setup are you building?
What motor are you using?
How fast do you want to go?

Absolutely, the number of teeth matters. Everything in your build effects it's performance.

I'm still not exactly sure of the parts i'm going with, as I'm in the beginning stages of planning, but I'm leaning toward the ESC and Motor in @stuxtruth 's build that he's parting out. The Tacon 160 245kV Motor and the Hobbywing Xerun 150a ESC seem to fit my needs if i'm not mistaken.

I will most likely get flywheels (so I don't have to drill through regular wheels)
The size of those wheels haven't been decided yet as I want some input on how big I should go.
I realistically will only be going 15mph average, with some extra speed to spare if the situation demands.
Finally, i'd like the ability to handle your average hill at a reasonable (not crawling) speed. Nothing too steep.

## \#18 Posted by: psychotiller Posted at: 2016-01-13T01:00:48.810Z Reads: 287

So, @6s with your batteries
83mm wheels
245kv motor
Motor pulley 14t
Wheel pulley 36t
You'll have around a 18mph top speed.

Anyone have any info on how I could easily charge batteries? I'll most likely be using 2 5000 mAh LiPo batteries, and it seems charging them can be a hassle. 

Are there any alternatives to taking them out of your board and charging them separately? Ideally I'd like to have a charging port on my enclosure that I can stick my charger in and not have to worry about connecting/disconnecting any wires.

(Sorry if this is common knowledge, I've only ever charged LiPos from single-battery traxxas rc cars)

Great part list. I'd recommend an IMAX B6AC or an iCharger (iCharger is better but more expensive.
IMAX B6AC is a good charger to start with because it has a built in power supply but the iCharger you have to buy one.

Simply put.

Edit: since i saw you decided for 2x 3s 5Ah batteries, use the series connector to get a total 6s 5Ah battery.

Hi everyone,
I'm in the process of ordering all of my parts, and would like to know:

What power switch for the outside of my enclosure should I get? I've heard that some switches have a slow power drain even when in the off position.

I will be ordering my wheel pulley assembly from  but there are two options (see picture)
Which one do i get? I will be using 83mm FlyWheels<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/07439e506a598ab8a951388826427041d2d4f5a2.jpg" width="344" height="336">

I found this printed wheel pulley on eBay, and it's a good deal! 
My problem is I was planning on ordering some knockoff 83mm flywheels for my build, and I don't think this pulley will fit them, will it?

If not, what is another pulley you'd recommend?
I've seen the aluminum ones from DIYElectricSkateboard and sites of the sort, but I'm trying to keep the cost low.
Could anyone link me the correct pulley and hardware for flywheels on sdp-si or another site? I wouldn't mind drilling the right holes.

just be careful with the splitter. I like to cut the red wire out of the middle pin because its unnecessary and easy to short.

actually in the past I have been known to even cut one of the sockets in half on an extension to give the same result.

The VESC was designed specifically for eboards, so the amp rating compared to car esc's is a little skewed. 

To be honest, I've never heard of a VESC **not** working with any motor that is commonly used for eboards.. besides trying to use a high KV (like 200+) motor on 12s.

Once I finally get all of the components for my build, I'm planning on upgrading my deck. I like the shape of these two, but would the flex of the bamboo be too much for an enclosure on the bottom? Is it something truck spacers could counter?

I'd be more inclined to go with the Maple deck. the bamboo decks that I have ridden have been too flexy and not responsive enough for my liking.

Hey guys, I have a question about my electronics.

I recently got my parts from @stuxtruth in the mail, (ESC, Motor, Batteries, GT2B in Badwolf)
and when trying to do a quick test, it seems when i turn the controller on, the receiver senses it, but the motor goes haywire and starts spinning out of control. I have been reading, and it seems the solution would just be a **bind cable** that plugs into the receiver? I never got one with my order from him, and he seems to have been M.I.A. recently so he hasn't been able to get back to my messages. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/4609887f592b258e2e7ba989e496ccb3d63bbef2.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/dca1031a17b1cb538b22b65b5964a18d226719ac.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/8464731f3141ba5b211dfc172ab1014c3092ba7b.JPG" width="666" height="500"> Could someone link me the correct part to fix this please?

On the receiver you have channel 1,2, and 3. The other one may say 5v or battery? That one is usually for binding. If you jump the 2 outside pins (skip the middle one) it will put it in bind mode. Once it's bound remove the jumper and you should be set.
```

yeah, I initially had it plugged into channel 2 I believe, but had the same result. I looked at a video online and someone had the ESC plugged into the top channel. He then plugged a "bind clip" thing into a lower channel and bound the remote from there. My problem is i didn't get a bind/jump cable thing I think
```

You don't need one. Just use a wire and aligator clips to jump the outside pins. Any wire will do.All the binding plug is is a mini loopkey

What belt size is the belt you bought from enertion? My center to center distance is 60mm, which is more compact that enertion's...With my mount you'll need a 255 or you can get the optional idler pulley with my new mount and enertion's belt will work.

yeah looks good.

although keep in mind that because you are series charging the maximum Amps will actually only be about half what you set.  so when it is charging you can only expect to see 2.2A on the display.

I originally was planning on welding a mount onto my preexisting board and trucks, however I discovered my friend could not weld aluminum lol. I ended up spending a little more, on Caliber trucks and Enertion's motor mount (Roughly $100 extra)

In total I have spent just over $420 on this build, so it would have been entirely possible for a ~$300 build had I not decided on easier components.

looks to me like you have got it all covered.
if you want to charge though the case just run the leads to the outside of the case like this:
(obviously if you have XT60 then you will not have Dean's but you get the idea)

@outsider  Sorry for the late reply, but i run the batteries in series directly into the ESC, and to recharge I have to unscrew my case and remove the batteries. It's tedious, but until I have more time and I can find out how to wire it directly out of the case, I have to deal with it. 
Hey, @lowguido , could you post a pic of your wiring and how you connect your batteries to the ESC and outside the case?

Those motors and esc will not work very well for esk8. It is possible but you will need a large gear reduction ratio to achieve a good amount of torque.
