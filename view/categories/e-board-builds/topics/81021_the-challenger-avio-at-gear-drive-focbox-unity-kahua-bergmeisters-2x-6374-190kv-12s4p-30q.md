# Deck

So, this deck was from China, and cost roughly 40USD with shipping. It's basically a Landyatchz Switchblade 40" Clone. Has an amazing concave, well placed foot wells and a subtle drop.

![1|374x500](upload://alYzKlfudugJMScKpy6qe8UjKGP.jpeg) 

The graphics were really horrible, so i decided to get rid of it and go for a white/black theme for this build. First, removing the existing graphic with paint remover.

![2|374x500](upload://sAAsZvWt19cfUzg2FktEPRVl4wI.jpeg) 

Priming it..

![3|374x500](upload://4QB3c45WEyBbwkD8RZr6tvuDQlo.jpeg)
![4|374x500](upload://2f2VHq1ByS8O5AnejMdfwxWAFZe.jpeg) 

Painting it white. (I used 2 cans of white paint and an entire can of 2K clear coat on this deck. The paint used cost more than the deck itself.

![5|374x500](upload://oK02uDZ2HWgbW7hnPYp8d1LYzED.jpeg) 
![6|374x500](upload://xl1853U3NuYHFbSbc9tQsiAweAP.jpeg) 

# Enclosure

Now comes the enclosure. I've been an avid fan of @Eboosted's enclosures, and just had to use his enclosure for this build. As far as i know, there isn't an enclosure option specifically built for the switchblade that can hold a 12S4P, so I decide to get Alan's 12S universal enclosure to mold around the deck.

Needless to sad, some modifications had to be done, with @Linny's help 

![7|666x500](upload://3xMnn6df9OxIAbxYVN4d4soqXVp.jpeg) 

Sanding off the existing paint job. Sorry Alan! your paint work is amazing, but this had to be done (:

![8|690x388](upload://mcvKkpQTwCSKRvVaJBR9QWDe7U6.jpeg) 

Using tape to get a rough idea of how to fill in the gaps

![9|690x388](upload://mNWNyoIj7rwl6PrJh5E1c6bVhPl.jpeg) 

![10|690x388](upload://5oG2GVzvFTOwPGysn1FosFOCFgr.jpeg) 

![E6|690x388](upload://ylVecbnTMhGRoj46U56ccHEwub.jpeg) 

After hours of sanding and filling..

![E7|690x388](upload://bHJ3wY4MWcoi9gf4BxE2DWEsqSa.jpeg) 

Bedliner spray, because it honestly looks f*** amazing.

![E8|666x500](upload://lhZFVM6geE5ISmFkba3v8GHfPem.jpeg) 

I mean c'mon, look at the texture!

![E9|665x499](upload://BEQUELH2FhxVOaQnGVsXhGRD7w.jpeg) 

Ok, deck and enclosure complete, now to fit the electronics and the drive system.

![IMG_20190114_214247|381x500](upload://tWczB1uOoL3BTRmQIeBhiVQMaI4.jpeg) 

# Electronics

12S4P 30Qs for the battery, nothing much to be said here honestly. The FocBox Unity simply makes everything too easy. Again, great job @Deodand 

![50065984_230360341199732_2351962196239450112_n%20(1)|690x388](upload://x6QmR36kMPDzxtCb5ykrg6y22KS.jpeg)

Electronics in the enclosure! So satisfying!

![El1|666x500](upload://3szAbbug1f83eAtRGDjzk2o7M7H.jpeg)

# Riser Extension

I realized that I'd get wheel bite using such huge wheels on the deck and had to push the wheels out slightly. Solution - Riser extensions!

Printed out the riser and pasted it onto some old scrap AL6061 I had lying around.

![Riser1|690x388](upload://apeelzR6eKhSFyHCrZ4PqYeFUc4.jpeg) 

Cut-out with an angle grinder.

![Riser2|281x500](upload://maOizEKONAoWLsG9JEQ5Aorwj24.jpeg) 

Drilled the appropriate holes.

![Riser3|666x500](upload://4C9NTFubDhAek34a2pIL4rjAv7s.jpeg) 

Gave it a nice chamfer..

![Riser4|666x500](upload://6TqkaGUSCE07IYkeNBrPK3FDsjG.jpeg) 

Voila!

![Riser5|666x500](upload://sbIUV9fNTvxAeu4hX3RvTaJbt0K.jpeg) 

Trucks are extended outwards by 4cm, which gives me more than enough clearance!

# Avio AT Drive

Onto the last and most exciting part, the drive!

This build was built with the sole purpose of testing out the Avio AT Drive! For those of you who don't know what it is, check it out!

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-avio-at-gear-drive-project/77886/1

![test%202|666x500](upload://bb8doOSEebP7QCtzkKO1yFm4Spa.jpeg) 

Got the parts manufactured from AL7075-T6 and finished with a black hard anodize.

![IMG_20190110_180806|666x500](upload://ctQiEldyI2WydGY4G77ZvcEvyHi.jpeg)

Paid through a Friend of mine who got them from the factory, I can ask him... each deck I paid 40 sgd or 29.5 usd. 

Landy switch blade 40 clone(everything is exactly the same except no sanded wheel well) , better finishing quality than the prism origin deck I got for @Linny too which is Super surprising

Weather sealing strip is a common D profile strip that can easily be bought off aliexpress/amazon.

Ok here's how i did it. Started off by sanding away majority of the paint, exposing the bare fiberglass.
![20190108_193424|690x388](upload://bMp6pIJsjuD8XGhmk4YelFnjHoX.jpeg) ![20190108_194000|690x388](upload://36RclY6koJcLSAZbX22L7euUgNo.jpeg) 

Placed the enclosure on the deck to the desired spot, and used masking tape as a gauge to where it meets the deck. ![20190108_200336|690x388](upload://1aUHeiOwMPA5JBbt9BPM5TZDBa9.jpeg) ![20190108_200905|690x388](upload://3G6Y0EGIjlvuLteVsWxS0vnJqgb.jpeg) 

Two layers of fiberglass and resin over the inside.
![20190108_195549|690x388](upload://k2cff3E77kcJeUVthU2VkLtrEW1.jpeg) ![20190108_203041|690x388](upload://i0by0rpfnrLTIFrTm15dhmimhTp.jpeg) 

Would you eat that?![20190109_190248|690x388](upload://4bsk6NaU0zXVBQQciBJnowBTIjg.jpeg) I used 2K fiberglass body filler, its usually used for body work and or fixing car dents etc.
Slatter a good amount over it![20190109_190643|690x388](upload://1cIqVqmZushcjQecb7TNxdJOR8D.jpeg) 

Use a Rotary tool with a cut off wheel or a belt sander and cut where the edge of the masking tape is.![20190109_200628|690x388](upload://1czIlPDSeUw6YBu9b6zatFhAKqh.jpeg) 

Sand the inside to get an even wall thickness as well. ![20190109_193308|690x388](upload://oaxUlUQ3VCtTRB0OZTtrH71aVxc.jpeg) 

Sand and apply more filler to the outside if needed![20190109_203757|690x388](upload://yhvS3MbS0ZhH4Dn43vVHIOebkrY.jpeg) Adding tape to the sides because of the drop down from the deck, more material going on![20190110_065850|690x388](upload://k9sD71a7EQtLAYqw286EbTgUEVN.jpeg) ![20190110_070650|690x388](upload://av32s3g5hNsDnUkw8aIYm8ni82j.jpeg) 

Much better!![20190110_091616|690x388](upload://1NACgi0gb3Vf01SyjV9LQcsdMc0.jpeg) ![20190110_093056|690x388](upload://bhJFdkSiZ5nhCLJQFAhdZU0QH3J.jpeg)

Nutty build! Can't wait for you to test this! I'm specifically interested in knowing if you get any speed wobbles at max speed with this setup or not. If I entered all the specs right, the esk8 calculator says your max speed loaded should be 65 km/h or so :open_mouth:

Shame that wheel cutouts weren't big enough ‚Äì I plan on making my next build drop-through, so will have to look for a different deck I guess. :confused: (Then again, Surfrodz RKP trucks can be 360mm in total length, compared to the 340mm of the Haggyboard Kahua trucks ‚Äì would that be sufficient? )

I went at 45kmh with no issues so far.

20mm more will help, but youd definitely still have to push the trucks out by a min of 30mm if you want to use these wheels. Either that or chop abit of the deck away.

Since it‚Äôs two component once activate do you have to use the all can on there is a way to do not use it all and keep it for next time?

Nope, it has a recommended pot life of about 8 hours, but I found that it tends to harden 2 hours in.

I've been through approximately 300km on this buils, and have been loving every mile of it! It handles all kinds of terrain really well! Zero maintenance needed to do a sealed gear drive, simply perfect! Definitely the favourite of my all my builds (:

Enough talk, let me share some some pics and vids!

IKR. Loving the contrast. Took inspiration from @Jc06505n's Orca build :stuck_out_tongue:
