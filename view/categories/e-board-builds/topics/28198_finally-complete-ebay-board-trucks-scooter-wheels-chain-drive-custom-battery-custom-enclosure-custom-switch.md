Gotta imagine you do a lot of burn outs with those though and imagine braking force isn't super great (but I'm usually limited on how hard I can brake anyhow by the belt or inertia, imagine with the chain you might have a little more play but also way less likely to skip).  Also is that chain drive loud or not so bad?  All I hear with the belt is the motor and the clacking of the board if I'm on a crappy road.

Overall build is pretty sweet the enclosure is super slim and looks nice wouldn't have guessed the florist trays.

Haha! That was me! :smiley:

Turns out you can't do it unless you have extra long shafts because the core of the scooter wheel is the same width as any other skateboard/longboard wheel! So you can only fit one wheel on. It's not too bad though traction-wise, not much different to when I had the original 70 x 50mm wheels on there.

No burn-outs, I weigh like, 13.5st! Braking is REALLY good, the whole reason I got a VESC to be honest as opposed to the Boat ESC I had when I originally built it. I've had a couple of people walk out in front of me so far and they've stopped me in good time and distance. I imagine (I've never experienced belt drive) the chain is much stronger than the belt for braking. There's certainly never been any slippage or tooth jumping, the chain has just about the right amount of slack.

Now that I've re-built and everything is tightly packed and padded in my new enclosure, all I hear is the motor...no chain at all. Here's my son having a go the other day... It's pretty quiet.

The best option here is to get three, you'll need two to make it big enough, although they depends on what cells you're using...

Also, I had to sit mine on strips of hard rubber, about 10mm tall to get the depth right as they're quite shallow these trays... Basically there's quite a bit of modification required to get to a perfect enclosure with these, it might not be worth it for you...

The relay cuts/connects the main power from the battery to the VESC, it's powered (momentarily) by a voltage regulator to step down the voltage to 25v from 33.6v (8s). It's a double coil latching relay so power the coil for faction of a second one way = on, fraction of a second the other way = off.

It's working great! Never had an issue and there's no spark either. I'd recommend it for a cheap high current switch for sure...

Unfortunately I can't find anything on my phone at the moment, I got mine from eBay but I can't find any...

For the voltage regulator, you just need a regular high voltage > 24v regulator, from rs components or digikey.

For the latching relay you want a SPST latching relay that can handle current from 60A - 120A. Mine is rated for 120A but you can get away with a 60A one just as well...
Needs to be momentary and double coil.

No, you need this type of voltage regulator an in-line, through-hole component. Just choose one that suits your set-up, 33.6v, 42v etc. for the input and then match the output to the coil voltage of the relay you find...

Finished the upgrade! These wheels are so nice. Very smooth and the rubber is quite grippy, a lot grippier than the scooter wheels...

I thought adapting them to fit my sprocket (chain drive) was going to be a nightmare, but it actually turned out to be super easy, even easier than the scooter wheels and would be even easier if I was using a pulley and belt I reckon.

They're new prototype wheels I'm working on. I'm just perfecting the rubber and all the sizing etc. Also looking at how to mount pulleys or sprockets...

They should be available to the community soon! I may be replacing the rubber with urethane... but maybe not, I'll see which is best.

There's four screws either end of the deck, (8 in total), they're in elongated holes so the enclosure can move a few mm. This seems to have helped it stay put.

Sorry, wheels have taken a bit of a back seat as I'm so snowed under with battery builds! üòï

How is this wheels are doing ? Are you still using it? I live in Taiwan and i can see many scooters having these on them.

Not using them anymore, too hard and the factory refused to adapt the mould unless I ordered 3000! :confused:

So funny just finding this thread because I've been wondering how scooter wheels will work on a board.  My youngest is a comp scooter rider so I've got literally 50 of them knocking about.  I was thinking they'd be good for a balls out speed machine especially as you can now buy 130mm diameter and 40mm wide.  
I'm doing it.  obviously for science.
Shame about the 3 spoke design though man they looked the business.
