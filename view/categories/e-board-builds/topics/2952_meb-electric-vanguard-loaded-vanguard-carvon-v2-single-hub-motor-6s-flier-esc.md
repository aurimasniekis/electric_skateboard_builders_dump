#Hey eSk8!

Just want to share my new build, it's pretty much fully complete and I've put over 150 miles on it already. The last thing I have left is to hide the wires between battery and ESC under the grip tape but I haven't bought flat wire to do that yet and it doesn't bother me enough to charge it right away. I will include links to all components!

If I keep the board under 20mph i usually get anywhere from 10-12 mile range.

When I'm having fun and really pushing the throttle to hit 25-30mph I get about 7-9 mile range. 

Here's a screen shot from my last run or the video above:

Slick looking ride. I like your boxes and that charging plug setup. Does that really make it so you can balance charge through that single port without disconnecting anything?

I attached the port from the inside. You can see the pictures of what the case looks like from the inside and I also linked my case design on thingiverse so you can take a look there also.

@Mobutusan  Thank you!

And yes the port connects to all the balance leads and the charging leads.
You need to connect the charge leads in parallel to the battery to not have to disconnect anything ever.

@willpark16 Yeah! Their ESC's are great, best ESC I've used so far. I have this one and a Twin motor ESC I use on another build. I do have a VESC and it's a lot smoother on start up but it always cuts out inside my case cause of the temp.

@Chris_KP Yes the VGA Port is great! there's no Spark when connecting it and I'm only pushing 2amps through it. Idk how it will handle higher amp chargers but on 5000mAh battery a 2Amp charger is fine for me.

@willpark16 the Flier ESC took about 3 weeks almost the same as my batteries so it was fine cause everything pretty much came together. The Enertion VESC took about a month and a half and now I'm waiting on May's batch to ship that i ordered back in Feb.

love the VGA adapter, a little suspect for charging but if you don't mind the wait it ok
keep an eye on that on/off switch from flier.

## \#20 Posted by: oriol360 Posted at: 2016-05-12T06:08:56.451Z Reads: 365

```
@wieg16 The fuel gauge is just a volt meter showing percentage. it's not super accurate but it gives me a pretty good estimate of my range. and when the lipos get to low the ESC I have also has a low voltage cut off to prevent the batteries from ever getting to low.

what happens when you charge your batteries connected in parallel and you press the on button and they are suddenly connected in series? Seems like a catastrophy is waiting to happen.

@Maxid Batteries are never in parallel, always in Series. So I charge them as 6S.

It's Done! Finally I had some custom grip tape made with my logo! Will be posting pictures of how I hid my cables.

Used Black plastidip to insulate the flat wires and keep them protected from water or anything that might get through the grip tape:

That's just paint, or liquid tape ? 
Why you do not put a layer epoxy on the cables ?

@Kaly Yeah it's liquid tape. 
I not a huge fan of how epoxy feels but that would work as well. 
Liquid tape is very thin and flexible, so it's very nice.

I like to use the liquid tape too. 
But for that applicatuin epoxy will be better in case that the grip tape breaks you don't want to short those discharge wires.

True, I might open it back up and recover it in epoxy. I'll see how the grip tape holds up after the first ride.
I wish I could see what boosted uses to protect their cables that are under the grip tape.

Wow dude I must have missed it this video! Would have helped before I went buying the wire and drilling into my board!
Thanks for the link!
They used 4 thinner flat wire, while I used 2 thicker wire.
Wow mine came close enough!

Finished with the Grip Tape and it looks Perfect!
Took if for a quick ride and I can barely feel the wires under the grip tape!

It was Very important to me that when I was designing this case and board I wanted to keep as much of the design as visible as I could! 
I took a close up picture here so you can see the Case is positioned so you can still see the name of the board and 2 out of the 3 fishes are still fully visible. The Vanguard is one of my favorite boards and thanks too boosted I was inspired to turning it electric. however I never wanted to loss the aesthetics of the board.

I will be editing the post to add these final pictures to the main post on top. I'm done building my Vanguard for now!
