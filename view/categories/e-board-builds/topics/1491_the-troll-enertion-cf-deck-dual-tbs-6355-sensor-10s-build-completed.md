Here is my part list:

Enertion CF deck
195mm Paris trucks
83mm Flywheels
TB's motor mounts
TB's 6355 Sensored motors
10S 18650, still contemplating 3P or 4P
Vesc
Vchuck

Initial work was done on the Paris trucks, the trucks were conical and the mounts were not getting a good bite on the trucks. So I got a 3/4" tube, cut a slit in to it, slapped the trucks on a lathe and removed material up to the ID of the tube.

*trucks*

Now the motor mounts are bitting really good on the trucks and the motors are well inline with the wheels

My initial plan was to go for 10S4P using normal cell holders, but after building my pack (cut twice measure one) I realized I wouldn't have much space for anything else and the cutouts are not aligned.

*battery*

So here are my battery options
-FISA (F*** it, start again) with 10S 3P with cell holders
-Remove the cell holder and rebuild the pack, that will save me about 38mm of enclosure space
-split the 10S pack and leave room under the cutouts and remove the cell holders.

And the todo list:
-3D print VESC mounts
-3D print power switch, power input and LCD screen mount.

You sir, are a battery magician, Wish i could do that too, looks so slick compared to the bulky lipo's.
You're work on the paris mounts is also something i would not even dare to do.
Following this thread.

Thinking out loud here,

splitting the pack in to a 8S4P and a 2S4P could be doable with some printed cell holders

To bad this config doesn't work, would have been nice.

10S3P seems to be the easy way out here..... mucho space for everything

Finally opted for the more chanllenging split pack. One pack is 8S4P and the second one is 2S4P. This will allow me to have clerance in the openings for the LCD screen, power button and charge port.

I got lazy and didn't print cell holders, just taped them together before wiring them up

Thanks guys, the big piece of the puzzle here is the bms. It's a nice Esk8 intergrated solution, with the help of @onloop.

it offers plenty of standalone features. Like CC-CV charging (constant current, constant voltage), over current protection, short circuit protection, UV and OV protection, balanced charging and a individual cell bleeding circuit in case of OV.

Usb output for charging a remote and programming the vesc. Soft start button with a momentary switch and onboard 60A fuse.

This is the first working prototype, i still have a few bugs to iron out. I've done enough lab tests to deam it road worthy.

This place holder for VESCS and capacitors is just epic. Great work !!! What kind of on/off switch do you use ? Isn't it the same switch that Torqueboards and Enertion had problems with in their battery packs ? . .............hmmm....wait a second..........is it the BMS that onloop showed in one of his videos ?

hey thanks for the thread revival. Yes this board is still alive and kicking. I rebuilt it at the beginning of the summer with a pair of focbox's and loaned it to my buddy... haven't see it since lol.

Sadly i just noticed that i didn't take any pictures, but i do remember having plenty of room inside the enclosure.

Me too. It's sad to be restricted to a 10s3p battery, Like you I need room for the two focboxes and HM10s

But @Blasto did it lol.

Jason says there is a new battery being developed for the Raptor 1 but im assuming its just going to be a 10s3p with 30q cells and i wouldnt hold my breath for it to come out. I went out on a Ride with a buddy that has a GTX and when i was getting down to 10% with severe voltage sag he still had 80% battery.... mind you my board is a hell of alot faster and i weight more but damn. 

maybe if i ask nicely @blasto could build me a similar pack to what he has with 30q cells :slight_smile:

How much clearance have you got between the motors? I'm wondering about doing a dual-6355 build on a 180mm truck as well, but with 15mm belts. Looks like you have 12mm here and it's already a pretty close fit.
