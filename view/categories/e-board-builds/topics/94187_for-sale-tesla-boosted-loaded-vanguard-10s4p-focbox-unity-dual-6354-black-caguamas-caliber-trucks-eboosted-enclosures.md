Are those @Eboosted enclosures? 

The board looks great. Now i hope you find an actual boosted board and put it to shame

Fantastic looking build - I'm in the same process with my Vanguard, it's taken ages and I'm about 1/3 of the way there. Are there any shots of the inside of your enclosures? I'd be interested in seeing how you've arranged everything. Also, what gaskets are under the enclosure? Lots of questions, haha! Thanks dude! :+1: :sunglasses:

I just like the control of the regular boosted board so much more. I’m not a fan of voltage control with the unity.
```

---
## \#15 Posted by: pundahh Posted at: 2019-06-05T02:05:40.177Z Reads: 185

Can't you optimize it so the control is more less the same? Haven't used a unity so not sure what you mean by voltage control. 

Might be interested in the drive train if the price is right.

Who built the battery and how much are you looking for it? What model BMS? What cells? I have a spot welder but am looking at other options. 

I need to replace my current battery that I built 6 months ago and have the same enclosures.

10S4P Samsung 30Q built by @thisguyhere. BMS is the one listed on his website for $30. It's brand new, I put 30 miles total on my board before deciding it wasn't for me.

I know you're out of the DIY for this but What wire did you use for the inlay in the top of the deck? 

I saw charging wires and main power wires, mainly interested in the high amp ones. Thanks!
