After being inspired by Amazing builds from people like -nowind, Squad,and whitepony,...
I decided to try my own .

-Funbox deck (modified)
-Paris195's
-sk3 6364 245kv
-Ollinboard's VESC + Badwolf gt2b
-DIY:
- motor mount
-18650 10s4p
-abs enclosure

Got inpiration for my mounts(made 2) from Squad's +Nowind's beautifull mounts !!. Incorporated a little of both in mine .

## \#7 Posted by: seanpain4 Posted at: 2016-05-08T05:53:22.973Z Reads: 741

```
Lower board height, allows for a much larger motor that wouldn't fit under some decks, some people like the looks, the motor is able to be mounted at a higher angle which protects it more against things hitting it when going over bumps.

Thats a couple that i could list. But i myself, don't really like the rear mounting. But this build is probably one of the better done ones.

I made mine just like member "whitepony" on endlessphere forum . He documented his build very well with pics, check it out!

It's basically a 10S4P  battery pack, spot welded together<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/0bcba62b04ccb83c245ca78eb193dabc4859e821.jpg" width="690" height="388">

hey randyc1, love your build, you should have included all these DIY goodies in your first post! imo these details are whats it all about! :smiley:

concerning your battery: you seem to be using 2 different types of cells? your parallel green pack will most likely drift relative to the blue, so I guess (hope) you are using a BMS? :fearful:

my build thread on ES: https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=72026&sid=708fbd95e09b3518f8802cd57d24072d#p1088195

even though I didnt have any problems (yet), I will probably use these insulation rings to protect the "+"-side of the cells a little more in future. ordered a whole bunch of them -> http://www.ebay.de/itm/331832123025 

also, I will in future fixate cells of a parallel pack with some hot glue, so they wont start to wear out their insulation hull by working on each other (also didnt happen yet, but might).

ive seen a 2 times now (by being stupid mostly), what these crazy currents can do if you short one of these batteries. each time I had a 4mm bullet connector in my hand and each time it was basically GONE, and I mean GONE and not just black and bent. :joy:

Hey whitepony !,.. the Cells are Identical, , ...I was told  they come out of the Tesla  "Bare", ...Okashira is the one who Shrink wraps them,,... was out of blue shrink wrap !
. All measured identical within 1/100 .. With Insulating rings installed !

I agree,Hot-gluing packs make them ridgit

I also did not put a BMS,,, will check them periodically.

I will Try to explain my Bending Pack :     If you look closely at the top side of pack <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/0bcba62b04ccb83c245ca78eb193dabc4859e821.jpg" width="690" height="388"> you will see a Black Wire,( did'nt take a Pic, sorry) this is my 10G Flexible Series Link. The Wide Hot Glue Joint (middle point of wire), acts as Kind of a.Pivot point.   The 2 batteries of Left of joint (top&bottom)  were lubed up before I applied Hot glue,so did'nt stick,but formed around battery and  only sticking to to right side batteries. This created a sorta Cupped joint and no friction between batteries at joint if Pack bends .<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/d5db569ccb8d51aa0af34e4e97ba4893afa0a29f.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Joint fall just about in middle of the board.

awhh, the flex idea is awesome! :grinning: its insane how hard we have to try to get all these details and secrets from you  :joy:

now its you who inspires me for my next battery. the flex points are generally a good idea, there is no need for any "outer" serial connection by nickel strips tbh, can just always connect all parallel packs with 10AWG wires for example. the only thing I was afraid in the past was excessive rubbing of cells among each other which might destroy the insulation ... but your hot glue protection will probably work great!  :ok_hand:

The only thing that worried me was the "heat " from soldering?,...spent more time on some than i would have liked, i need a stronger solder iron.

When i build next pack, since my nickel is 12mm
Wide i might Try soldering wire along edge of strip BEFORE I spot weld ,eliminating any heat at all??

@Randyc1 Nice pack build!! Man that is cool!! I'm also in the process of building a pack based on the notorious Whitepony threads!! 
Anyway...what do you think of using this material to mitigate the friction between cells for a flexi pack. 
http://www.ebay.com/itm/1pc-3mm-New-150mmx150mmx3mm-PTFE-Teflon-Sheet-Plate-White-Engineering-Plastic-/321901484316?hash=item4af2d2d91c:g:UvEAAOSwI-BWKumE
They have different sizes of course. It's super easy to cut and self lubricating. The other idea I had was to use delrin.
@whitepony Thank you so very much!!

My pack flexes at one point near middle, rest is all hot glue together and ridgit,.. so potentially all you need is to avoid friction on just 2 cells .

You could use any thin sheet of plastic.

@Randyc1 do you know if a Spacecell will fit in your enclosure. I've always like how clean your setup is. Nothing fancy and perfect board. Even the darn grip tape is cool.

Many that use High Quality brand new 18650 cells have reported that there is no drift.

Last time i checked mine there was only 1/100 of a volt difference. 
Member whitepony is another who does'nt use bms, and has reported zero drift after over 1500 km !

Charger stops at 42V , ..I have a Voltmeter on my board so i know excactly what Voltage I am at ....and Vesc has been programmed to stop discharge at 30V,...

I have never ridden below 33-34V  ,  that was after a 40km ride

The pack your talking about are like the ones found in RC cars??
These.packs your talking about are much thicker than 18650 cells , my board is a drop throught so it is low and i needed a very flat battery pack.

18650  cells allow you to build a pack of the size you want also !

Ok I think we have a communication problem.
I am talking about using the same cells you use (18650s) but in a different configuration.
Instead of having 10s4p, why not wire them such as to have 2x 5s in series (making one big 10s pack)  and each of these 5s is made of 5 groups (connected in series)  of 4 18650s (connected in parallel).

Honestly- I haven't a clue what manufacturing costs are for an aluminum pulley but if you're going to sell them I'd  only hope they were threaded (no nuts required) for clearance reasons. I really like my 3D printed ones but the tolerances are so slim with kegels. Keep me posted. I'm starting to think about build #2!
