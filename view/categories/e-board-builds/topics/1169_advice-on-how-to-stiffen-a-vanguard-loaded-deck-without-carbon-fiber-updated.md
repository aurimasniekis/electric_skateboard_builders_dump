Hey all what do you think on how to stiffen up a super flexy deck.  its a flex rate of 3 ( I wish they sold a stiffer model for the 38" but they dont)  im thinking a layer of carbon fiber? 

Thanks

Yea do a layer of carbon. And do it with my new roarocket vacuum bag and it'll look good and be lighter!  Spam spam. I'm everywhere. Selling for less than half the cost.

Shipping was insane with some tariff. I'm pretty sure I have this size. I know I have the larger size. 60$ plus shipping


The carbon part all u need is. carbon and resin.  And a bit of research.

Actually I wonder why you would like to stiffen an electric longboard? Isnt it nicer to have flexy type of board for riding as it acts like suspension?

Until you start going faster. 20+ mph and you'll understand why a stiffer board is better.

yeah, stiff board all the way!
a mate of mine had a bamboo board and it was so flexy that I had trouble making it turn at low speed, and at high speed it wobbled all over the place!

Yes I do like flex board but my build required me to drill a bunch of holes about half way they my board which made a super flexy board even more flexy. So some carbon fiber should do the trick to bring it back to original.   

Side note
What is the best way to apply carbon without a vacuum bag. I'm broke and don't have the machine or the bag etc

you can just use a paint brush. 
it wont be perfect though.. 

just a plastic bag and a vacuum cleaner will do at a pinch. I have used a garbage bag in the past. it wasn't awesome but it worked.

```
so if you were going to do it real budget.. 

1) mix up your resin
2) use a brush to paint the surface of the board in the resin (id probably rough up the surface with sandpaper beforehand to make sure you get a good bond)
3) lay the carbon down on your board and press it down flat as you can. (use gloves or a sheet of plastic)
4) us a brush to carefully wet the carbon from the top, be gentle as not to disturb the fibres. 
try to avoid putting too much resin on. brush off excess if need be.
5) let it dry.

this isnt the best way to do it. but it will work. the trick is not to put too much resin on. just enough to wet the fibre.

Try to trim it just before it dries with a sharp blade or it'll be difficult to remove.  It's a delicate job and if you approach it as such it'll be a lot easier.  Maybe use tape to hold the edge of the carbon all the way around while its dry and remove the tape at the end as you cut it off. The fibers are easy to get bunched and then with holes in spots if you mess with it.  Best to lay it all out smoothly and not attempt to push or pull it when it's wet or even dry. 

I've hard of people using tape with pin prick holes in it to wrap at the end to squeeze out the excess resin when they don't have a bag.  Sticky side up

Choosing a weave that holds its shape helps a lot

To correctly stiffen your board, carbon must be applied to the underside of your deck, not the top.
Why ? Because carbon is used for its tensile strength and when you flex your board by standing on it, the tensile stresses run lengthwise along the bottom.
Putting carbon on top will have much less effect and you'll even risk buckling the layup.

Dude at roarocket said either side will work.  Top or bottom.  Maybe not as effective on the top as you say but the carbon has strong compressive strength he said. I wanted to do layers of carbon inside the wood so I'd have what looked like to be just a thin wood with some black lines and saw it nowhere so called.  I thought it'd be easier.  But he said that won't work and will destroy the wood.   That guy I've talked to for at least an hour on the phone about vacuums or boards....he's an interested guy.  Better than nice.

Carbon on the top is  more or less pointless.  If you can't put it where it should be you should just use skateboard plies, like maple.

If you put a few layers of carbon up top it will make it stiffer, but it's also likely to fail and then you're kind of stuck with the mess.

Oh okay thanks for the advice. So maybe I'll just some plies. You think just one will do it? Should I use bamboo or maple? Trying to hit take some flex out of it not all. And trying to keep it light and thin as possible. 

It's not terribly flexy now I weight 210 so it's too flexy for my weight. 

Any links you can find helps I've never added any plies before its an expensive deck so I don't want to ruin it

Okay so im not doing carbon fiber since i got chewed out for thinking about doing it on top :) 

SO i attached a pic of the bottom of my deck, can you guys maybe suggest an alternative? there is really only an issue right in front of the rear battery near the middle of the board. IF possible id like to just keep the original sprayed on grip tape. what do you guys think i can add to the bottom of the board to stiffen it?

Maybe something i can run along the entire border of the board? itd make the deck wider but im okay with that.

Judging from what I can see, taking all that stuff off and putting some carbon or another ply on the bottom doesn't seem too much work.
What in particular is holding you back ?

Because my two enclosures are held on magnetically, all of my batteries and electronics are permenatly attached to the deck, also the magnets (20)  are embedded in the deck already. If I a layer of carbon on top it'll further extend the distance between the magnets and weaken the connection.

Those magnets are a very good idea, I like it.
If it was my board and I really wasn't happy with the flex, I'd rip it all off, add a layer of glass fibre or carbon and put everything back.
Anything else would end up being a half-assed solution anyway.

Yea I think you should do the carbon on top too.  See what happens. And tell us. Doing better than buying. 

The resin and carbon cost.. I'd ask smooth-on.com.  They have a hotline where they'll answer questions and you can get their stuff in small quantities.  Maybe you could do it with polyurethane resin instead of epoxy and save your nose.  Think you can.  I like task9 with its properties and hour cure time
Or do the bottom and seal in the magnets. If they're too weak you could grind through

I'm thinking about taking some carbon fiber sqaure tube and running along the border of my deck on the outside only where it is needed. I don't want to ruin the grip on the deck anymore. If I don't do a layer of carbon I save myself a lot of money. This build has already cost me a lot :)

Running carbon tubing along the deck sounds grotesque.  And how would you hold it...glue probably wouldn't hold. 
I've got a carbon deck top and bottom I bought. Such a lazy bum as I have the bag and am telling others to do it.  Bustin sportster carbon.

I've had three of these boards and each one was different the different years produced.  One 9ply wood, one 4 wood and 6glass, and one(this) 4 wood 4glass and two carbon.  This is stiff and thin 

I took the grip tape off intending to glue on some sand or something with task9 but I find the grip is t important to me and I've left it with just a layer of task9 to protect.

I like ur board though and almost got it myself. Rode it and it's fun. Really like the flex. But at faster speeds I thought it'd be too wiggly so got this. With the holes in it I'd carbon it up if I were u.  And what about those other handsome boards in your avatar.  You've got s collection and might as well make your own at this point

2 stiffening runners running lengthwise inthe center of the board would stiffen the center of the board and  reduce the total flex a lot. 

 They could be done for $10 worth of epoxy and fiberglass. 

Blue is the profile of the FG cloth.  This is the proper way of making something stiffer, notice it looks a little bit like a pick up truck bed.

 Two or three layers Should work awesome, and weigh almost nothing...  

You could also just glue and screw some oak in that same shape, <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f61a9798c8f993804c387280f6a8dbe43f8c02ba.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

In  FG I'd make it 25-35mm tall. And at least a 30 mm surround lip for gluing  

Cover the area with packing tape, 

make a mold from foam or pipe, cardboard or clay on the board.

2-3 layers of 4oz FG to start.

Demould and epoxy onto board.  heat gun if you must remove ever. Can drill small holes for LEDs too.

finally got around to doing it lol..

I used 2 U channel aluminum bars.  The battery is 6s 18AH. its very slim and the cells fit into the U of the aluminum.  The bars stiffen the deck so barley any flex at all and doubles as an enclosure for the cells since they will be the first things to get hit in an impact.

Ill be mounting all of my boards like this in the future.  it gives easy access to the battery for repair and eliminates the need for an enclosure
