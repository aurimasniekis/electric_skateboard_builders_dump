Nvm it looks like they made it better than I remembered. 

Chinese doesn’t translate that well.

If you ever wonder why Chinese people talk the way they do. Look at this...in order for the Chinese to come out grammatically correct, I have to write the English like my mom talks. ![image|690x347](upload://aCHTrvYSAjTOJ7sCWHnG5wFXx3C.jpeg)

Almost a 1:1 copy. Uncertain if you are planning on selling these, but I would take direct drive to a potentially new level before doing so.

My suggestion. Try reducing the width (direct drive closer to the wheel, so that it will fit all trampa decks) and introduce additional gears to increase ground clearance (currently, you sacrifice allot of clearance compared to belt drive). 

You'll end up with a product that is unique and will have its own place in the market.
