Good Afternoon Everyone!
I am a high school senior who just got a job so my projects can become more expensive :joy:
Right now I am looking to overbuild an electric skateboard that will have a max range of 20-30 miles and a top speed in excess of 35+. Don't worry I am young and dumb and am ready to drop about $2k. I do ride a motorcycle so safety gear is taken care of. 

Current Part List:
**Longboard** - ($250) Custom 39" maple drop through board with caliber 2 trucks and MBS all terrain wheels

**190KV Brushless Motors** - ($120 * 2) diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/motor-6374-190kv-3150w/

**Enertion VESC** - ($160 * 2) http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/FOCBOX-programmable-brushless-motor-controller/

**Motor Mount and Drive Train** - ($110 * 2) collections/featured-items/products/single-bolt-on-motor-mount-w-drive-wheel-kit

**12S3P Battery** - ($455) diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/electric-skateboard-battery-epower-pack-12s3p/

**Enertion Controller** - ($75) http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/nano-x-enertion-2-4ghz-controller/

**Customization** - ($200) Bluetooth speaker and led lights


I have several questions for you guys:
1)What would the estimated performance of this dual drive skateboard look like?

2)How would I wire the single receiver that accompanies the controller into the circuit with the battery, motors , and VESC's?

3)Any recommendations on enclosures?

 
Thank you so much for your advice and opinions!

Ryan F.

If ur spending that much on a battery from @torqueboards, u may as well get their 12s4p that comes with an enclosure and stuff for $50 more. However if u do stick with a 12s3p, check out @psychotiller enclosures. A lot of ppl. Seem to be really happy with the durability and design

Yeah, I was considering the 12S4P but I was unsure whether the enclosure would leave space for the VESC's and receiver.

I think you should get a custom made 12s4p instead of the TB one. Never tried their battery but that enclosure is horrendous

@ryanflick use the 12s4p.. 12s3p will be discontinued. Our enclosure has room for VESCs and it's included with the 12s4p pack. About 25-30 mile range from the 12s4p pack.

What do you say about giving me a discount? The 12S4P is another $100 because you charge an extra $65 for the fast charger(which can be gotten without an extra charge with the 12s3p)  and another $30 for shipping(which also isn't charged with the 12s3p).
```

@ryanflick There are no discounts for the 12S4P.

You can buy the 12s3p with no enclosure. They are discontinued. 12S3P is $395 with 2A Charger. 12S4P is $450 with 2A Charger. There's also 12x cells on a 12S4P vs 12S3P which adds to the cost plus a higher amp BMS.

12S4P is definitely worth the added cost which is why we're no longer offering the 12S3P.

We'll have some new updated photos soon.

with 3pin connector that comes out of either one, connect the male and female together and who-la...  
wire= brown gold red  or black white red

if familiar with RC servos same type

Example;

Yeah, I'm an avid RC enthusiast. However, because I am building a dual drive skateboard...the receiver could only plug into one of the VESC's. Won't this present a problem because only one motor will be controlled by the radio controller?

Motor 1- VESC 1 - Receiver ---Bat\
Motor 2 - VESC 2 --------------------- \tery

What does everyone think about running the motors sensored or not?
Are there any clear advantages to using the motor sensors?

Hey bro, if you're in the U.S, I reccomend buying your focboxes from either @longhairedboy (http://longhairedboy.com), @JLabs (buildkitboards.com), or @evoheyax (rocket-boards.com). They're all certified so you'll get your warranties and everything

Your performance for this board will be like riding a rocket, especially on that 12s3p with dual 6374. I hope you have good skating experience

Well your motors and focboxes are sensored so I don't see a reason why you shouldn't, there isn't anything but advantages, especially with smooth startups. I run them sensored.

Hey thanks for all the input but now I'm slightly confused.
I understand the BLDC and FOC are simply modes on most VESC's and ESC's.
FOC is quiter and smoother with acceleration. I was planning on using FOC. 
Why would @Apolo not recommend it with the 12S?
```

@ryanflick btw.. if you get our 12s4p (xt90 end connector) you'll need a special connector to turn XT90 into 2x XT60s for FOCBOX. just fyi.

[/quote]
12s is too high of a voltage. FOC is known to destroy vescs when it's put through too many erpms or volts. A focbox is your best soldier though. I think @Deckoz runs foc on 13s but i reccomend staying safe with bldc at 12s

I have the option to change the focbox to XT90 for you so you don’t have to make your own adapter. I just got fresh stock in as well. @Apolo thanks for the shout!!

No problem. If I was going to use your 63mm reverse mounts, what pulley length would I need? 320mm?
Also could you estimate the performance difference of a dual 6374 using your 12s4p versus using your 12s3p?
