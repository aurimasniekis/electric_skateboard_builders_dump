My next build will be a Mountain board. Everyone seems to flock to Trampa but quite frankly im still pissed about their actions on the VESC project and communication with their fearless leader. So, is there any reason I cannot build from a MBS setup?

You can build from any board, just depends how much DIY prowess you have or are willing to put into it.

That is pretty much what I figured. I have researched the forum and found motor mounts and pulleys for MBS. As far as diy I am pretty handy but have minimal tools living in NYC. I also want to do a 4x3s Lipo battery pack with BMS.

I'd say go for it, I do want to build a mountain board one day, but I think hubs are next on my list

Now you're talking! I'm actually thinking about changing my belt drive trampa to chain drive in preparation for snow days (not that there was much snow days this year).

For what its worth, there really isn't that much +/- between abs and trampa. I would say though, MBS has a lot of their stuffs on Amazon so it'll probably be easier to do shipping if you have Prime.

I love Prime shipping! Chain drive would be wild. 
Im going to try and build a MTB for a $1,000 budget!

1,000 might be a bit tight but since you're going only 4x3s and MBS I think you'll be fine. You going belt or chain?

Have no clue lol whichever I can find the easiest and will be reliable. I have zero plans to actually ride offroad and on rough terrain. I really wish I could find a maple deck!

No reason not to build an MBS, imo. Especially in the US, and especially if you have a limited budget. It's so much easier to find them for a good price here. I really like Trampa' s product line and quality, but I just couldn't pull the trigger on the $600+ board that I would have wanted. Instead, I've been able to get my hands on a 99% new Comp 95 for $200, a new Core 95 for $100, and an old Sol 16 for $40. So, the deals are definitely out there for MBS boards, but used or discounted Trampa' s seem almost non-existent unless you're in the EU. I bet you could find a good deal on Craigslist in NY. 

Technically, I'm plenty happy with the quality and performance of the MBS boards. I'm also very happy with the motor mounts from @idea; low profile, cool looking, sturdy, competitively priced. Plus, he now makes mounts for pretty much all of the MBS trucks, so there's plenty of options.

I spoke with @idea the other night about his offerings and they all look solid! I have found a few used boards but they are all around $200 and have the wrong trucks and wheels on them. My goal is to find a used 30 degree deck and build from there.

Ya, I like Trampa for their sleekness but $400 extra is a little too much. That said though, I don't know how @idea can have so much grip and power with belts drive in the woods. I have a hard time getting any power from a dead stop in Central Park with my belt drive.

Are your motors too high kv? do the belts slip or just a lot of strain to take off?

12s6p 18650. Im thinking about changing it to 20700 though for the increase in range. Me and @Mikeomania12 always have to decide between going to Central Park or take subway there to conserve power, always a pain in the ass.

6347 190kv  Turnigy. It slips and sometimes theres a lot of cogging, like straining to take off. It's gotten better ever since I change The belt to GT3, which is so fukin strong! But the cogging is just......annoying. Don't want my batteries blowing up the ESC too.

I don't think its a good idea if you're planning on going off road. The bottom of my board has cuts and scratches on it pretty bad. Also, it looks wayyyy cooler with the batteries on top. People take their phones out immediately to get a snap shot of you like a fukin celebrity :sunglasses:

Lol, you're gonna love it dude. Also, whats the point of going mtb if you can't even jump over curbs side of st if you have to avoid them because of the enclosure on the bottom? 

These pics are from months ago, the scratches and cuts is actually worst now.

You should check out @Mikeomania12 trampa. He changed his bindings to mbs bindings and off road wheels. That thing looks sick! 

We need to link up this summer bro. There is an MTB track in queens that I want to shred with you guys when we get a chance to gather all the e-mtb folks.

I do not have problems with much grip and power with belts drive, and I drive only in the forest. I use 20mm wide belts.
However, if the belts are loose, they may slip under strong braking.

I want to use a belt tensioner in the new version motor mounts to eliminate this effect.

A couple of months ago I also was like you. considering on building my eMtb. Trampa was never an option for me as I live in Singapore and initial cost and shipping (plus the tax I would be paying) make it an absolute no go. I opt for MBS because I happen to travel to Australia where those are popular in the shops. I got the cheapest I could find - Colt 90. It comes with ATS trucks which (sadly) do not fit @Idea's setup (he is developing a mounting system for those now, but when I was building it he only had setup for Matrix II). I ended up building a 3D printed setup which I am super happy with. You can see my build thread below. I am waiting for progress (and willing to be the Guinea pig) on those mounting system from Idea. BTW I used chain drive and it rocks! (noisy too)

the weakest link is, of course, the motor mounts (I mentioned it somewhere). the rod would be the last thing to worry about. 

go for it @flywithgriff!

No. Only thing I noticed is on hard banks the gear mounted on the wheels can hit rocks. Belt being flatter might have less issues as such.
