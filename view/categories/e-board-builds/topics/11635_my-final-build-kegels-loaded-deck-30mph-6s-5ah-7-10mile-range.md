So in my previous posts you will be able to find what exactly i used for this build (electronics wise) Now to completely finish my board id like to finish the apperance. I made a blank deck out of 5mm plywood (3 layers) it looks very similar to the boosted deck except it just doesnt have the same grain but to be honest i prefer mine haha. I went with the kegel wheels. And some 185mm trucks. I have actually got 2 of these decks and im going to sell one. If you interested please pm me. They will only be about Â£20. The reason why the top isnt varnished is because well grip tape goes over that anyway doesnt it. Any suggestions on what i can add? Ive already 3d printed some enclosures that are pretty similar to the boosted ones. I know the bolts are silver yes haha, i will be changing them as well.

 Let me know any suggestions! 

Also if the deck is purchase the trucks and wheels are not included also the deck has a much more of a bend in the middle than it looks, some reason it looks like there isnt even a bend but there is. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/5/85ec4de64699d053c543daf52f443347b5fcea20.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/7/5749f2e387d063d293814e2cfc11ad2d25e2271f.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/d/8d04d46c5e0b6bb2300e64d45abfda342de7cc17.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/3/a3bb71aaa365ea1bd56b3df767307ab73ba873ad.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/7/871d3264aa08a27d6a7471ef0bb35f004fcf37a6.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/0/b00ef199c6fdd948b08c864cfe7a58df6160b325.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Nice work! How much does the deck weigh? I might be interested in buying it off you, I wanted to lighten my board with a bamboo deck, but this might be the ticket.
