Yeap. You can't fit them as dual rear with Calibers. You need wider trucks. @torqueboards is going to release wider "calibers" in any time i think.

I think the best way would be to

Have two on the same truck but in different orientations (one on the front side other on the back side) 
Or
have them both on the same side of front and rear trucks.
Or
Criss crossed on both trucks

P. S please correct me if I'm wrong.
