So this is going to be my second board. Right now I'm looking at Torques 75KV dual hub motor kit and thinking about pulling the trigger. 

I saw the Carvon V3s but I can't wait that long.

I tried using the search engine here but it's pretty terrible at finding what I'm looking for.

Is there any other hub motors I should be looking at?

Cheers

thanks jinra yup they should be sent by the 15th of this coming month.  Hope you come out Jinra and anyone else interested in seeing and trying them soon after then.  actually need bucks now if you're interested in getting these

Just looked around for about 10 minutes so I might not have read enough, but I get the impression that they're not as refined as diyelectric's hubs.

500$ with usa shipping
 (2) abec11 centrax 83x78, two motors, custom 12mm hanger, paris 195 hanger, two paris v2 baseplates, 4 tires.
@UniqueSnowflakeN27 those are an old design that I don't sell anymore. Those were a step towards these with many changes for increased power and reliabilty<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/9/4990319988d6d2ba5651306ac22408c2f0d9ff6f.jpg" width="375" height="500">
there was a mistake on the rotor and had to be redone..so close.    Got to run the test on the bldc tool but failed and I THEN realized the rotors were cut wrong and led to an imbalance.

I didn't want to present these in such an amateurish way but someone backed out and want their 1200 back immediately and so I have to sell in this way again with parts on my kitchen table unfinished.  But these are in my mind, and some other minds, the most robust design out there and of the 140 motors I sold in the past, with even a mechanically weaker design with smaller bearings, not one mechanical failure of the motor. These new motors also have double the motor size of the old squeezed in there and all the best components:
.2mm lamination Kawasaki steel stator
n48sh high heat curved magnets that are good to 300f
hand wound 400f wire done by myself or other americans...san Franciscans.
conformaily coated windings held with top quality vacuumed-in resin
giant bearings
all steel motor construction
12mm axle hanger
specialized rare high heat polyurethane with high heat plastic core

I added to what I wrote above but by specs if you mean max  continuous wattage or peak I don't have an answer and always remind that theres no standardization with such stats and it would depend if you were in the desert or on a glacier.  I do have video of me doing laps on hills at good speed here in san Francisco with the older version
I can wind whatever kv you want but in the past almost always had 90kv done for 30mph on 12s

awesome.  I know you want a single and I really want to get you on one and the only obstacle being the hanger at 12mm would have to be lathed down to 10 for some regular bearings to fit, and then threaded on the end and spacers added on that side.  @mmaner was talking about a lathe recently...mike maybe we could work something out?   but I really would rather sell two as the lathe work is work.  I have enough work.  Really I just don't have a lathe otherwise I think it would be fun and I want a lathe.  I have access to one at techshop but don't want to spend the 140 for doing it one time.  I don't think I want to do it more than once ever.  it will become work then
don't have a price as it would depend on how hard to get the hanger cut down as above.  If you want to get it all done except for cutting that side down and you do it yourself we could do that.  You bought motors from me before so you get special deal!

$500 is sure a pretty penny.  Carvons are also about as much. It seems like a lot compared to getting two motors and trucks.

Not that far off a traditional dual motor setup though. TBs dual mechanical kit with a couple of his 6355s would run you around 500 bucks.

I'm talking commercial cost of parts not compared to a belt drive setup.

Assuming motors are $100 each, trucks are about $50, and we'll throw in non brand wheels for say $50. That's $300 total. This is all commercial pricing btw, not raw cost of parts. I'm not so much complaining that these hubs are expensive as I am trying to figure out why they cost so much.

I guess the extra lathe work and mounting of said motors could incur a $200 premium.

@Hummie is hand winding motors, that requires a bottle of makers mark and a pack of Newports, so add another 40 bucks ðŸ˜€

 The winding is relaxing compared to putting the. magnets in! But I changed the price to 450$ Pete what do u think now?  If we compare the price of these motors to motors made commercially you will have to pay much more for the n48sh curved magnets, .2mm laminate stator, and bearings that will last a lot longer.  The impregnating of the coils fully is a huge plus especially for a hub motor. Of all the motors I had made the only real failures were due to phase wire to magnet wire connections. We've got some cool surprise there as well. And the wheel. Anyone selling a hub motor without appropriate polyurethane and a high temp core..someone was already talking about the dangers and instant lawsuits

The rotors I have, 19, are all machined wrong and waiting for the new rotors to show and that's the only hurdle.  As soon as they're here I can have magnets in and the stator on and have it running in 24 hours and I'll try to get u on it then

But Pete reading back, there's not normally any lathe work just if u run a single, which I only want to do once.  And these are abec11 centrax wheels here and the motor tires id say are more awesome than even those. And the same motor components you'll find in a scorpion or hacker.  If a hub motor were to get hot you best have a magnet that can get hotter.  
The plan is to do a Kickstarter in the coming two months so as to be able to get the bulk pricing on parts.
People who bought the old motors I sell tires for 5$. Anyone who has bought anything has helped get this far and keeping them all happy with what they have or getting them onto the new stuff cheap is priority...second only to me being able to ride the latest motors.

Very nice @Hummie but what about "the looks". Is it going to be andonized black? Are the wheels going to color match? What is the color of the hubs plates and what is the color of abec 11 core? Is it going to match? Whats the thickness of the urethane on the motor?
```

Everything is either black or natural steel as in this photo. Hub, can, and threaded-ring, you chose. 

The wheels in the past were black but working on getting wheels made to match.  I like grey. 

The thickness of the urethane is 24mm.  The motor is 59.5mm wide. The wheel is 83 diameter. But it's also 79mm long!  After riding these abec11 centrax wheels from a rare freak encounter I was smitten with the long wheel. Much smoother

Is your hub motors water/spill -proof?

```
the windings are extra coated by being dunked in resin and vacuumed and the connections from magnet wire to plug are coated as well so all you'd have to make sure of is that the shrinkwrap on the motor leads was fully sealing.   This is more so to hold all the wires from vibrating or rubbing as that seems to be the most common way to ruin a motor on a board but it will also seal the connections in the motor so it's waterproof.

Since it waterproof won't that affect the power of it?

```
adding resin or even shrink wrap to further insulate will reduce possible CONTINUOus power output because it will hold more heat in.  What "continuous" means is up for debate but the motor hub and hanger are a heat reservoir and in effect the peak output with such a motor will be much more than the continuous.  After the motor and hanger suck all their heat, as they're connected, then you're relying on the ability to dissipate that into the passing air, so if you're only riding for an hour or half an hour or fifteen minutes you have a different power output potential.   A complicated way to say you have to keep it cool.  Heat is the only power output limit. Keep it cool for efficiency sake as well as heat increases wire resistance and that's a loss, and keep it cool so things don't deteriorate. Bearings....better not be the magnets!?!
