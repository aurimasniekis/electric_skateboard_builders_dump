Nothing new really just sharing pics of a couple of decks I have tried to replace the standard raptor 2 deck .
Landyachtz battleaxe and a landyachtz hollowtech charlie horse. Both are great though completely different rides. The charlie is a straightline bomber, really solid at speed and very light due to the hollowtech design. The battleaxe ferls much more alive, rides more like a vanguard with awesome feel through the board.Not as stable at higher speeds though.  Not sure which I prefer. Landyachtz is running with carvon v4s atm which ride really well with full thane abec 11 97's. Do run considerably slower than the rspecs however.

Landyachtz battleaxe

if I am not mistaken, that's a 2009 Battle Axe; does it have 'heraldry' graphics, underneath?  Very rare, if so.  

In fact, that deck is even a 'founder's favorite':  http://landyachtz.com/pages-from-the-catalog-20-years-of-landyachtz/

Great build, thanks for posting.
