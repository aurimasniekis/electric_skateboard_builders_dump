Oh good, you had me spooked for a minute there...I was worried you thought you could plug the phase wires into the urethane and make it spin :joy::joy:

Was about to say where the drive train is haha! 
- iirc that remote is an esc only remote (no receiver) 

savings:
- i'd use a loopkey (xt90s) as an on/off switch (-35)
- go with caliber II trucks & boardnamics mounts ($$ cheaper)
- dickyho for motor pulleys + wheel pulleys

- That remote is not gonna do you any good, look for a mini remote
- That antispark will go poof
- You can drop all the kapton/copper/bullets/heat shrink since you're using lipo, but get a 540 pcs heat shrink kit for your wires
- Get 22 awg silicone wire for the balance leads on the battery and 16 awg silicon wire for the charger leads

Oof...buy house insurance then...that's a hella fire risk.  But actually get some fuses for it just in case a pack goes bad

Sure if you want :D . I personally just use a xt90s because its just so much cheaper yet still very reliable.
- boardnamic mounts, calibers, dickyho pulleys will still cut down the cost quite a bit :slight_smile:

with shipping to uk for pulley and mounts it works out more than the torque boards kit

torque boards caliber clones are cheaper from torque boards than actual calibers in the uk

Sure, if it works out to be cheaper for you then by all means. The drive train is solid. I don't know much about lipo's so maybe someone can weigh in.

Yeah but wait for the custom and everything
Buying from torqueboard in europe is not going the cheap way
Dickho has good stuff, you could get drive train, pulleys and motors from him, in one big box and it will definitely be cheaper

I’ve now found a Europien company with a drive train kit and some great motors and they also deliver to uk for free. 
I’m now just looking for an easier method for a battery in to uk I’d like something fairly slim with out going to far along the deck (similar to a boosted battery shape)
Please add suggestions. Looking to spend around £130

What shop is that ?
130 pounds is short for a battery, but not impossible
Your best chance is to seek someone that can do one for you at that price
ask the forum, sure a guy in england can, but there's some in france and belgium too
