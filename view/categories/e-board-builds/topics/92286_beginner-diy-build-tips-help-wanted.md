Hi new to the Esk8 community and in need of some assistance. I pretty much know what kind of battery and motor setup i want just dont know what components would work best together. I want to have a 12s8p battery and dual 6374 motors. The question is what board, trucks, wheels, enclosure, gear ratio, vesc, controller, bms etc. I was wanting something similar to the Evolve Bamboo GTX setup but have read a lot of bad reviews about their products quality. I like the design of the GTX deck and the DKP trucks just dont know of anything similar of better quality. Any help will be much appreciated.

I know, too lazy to look for others. Everyday, we get another noob thread asking what to use on their board. It gets annoying when you have 20 different people asking the same question thatâ€™s already been answered on the forum. Donâ€™t take it personal, just do some more searching and youâ€™ll be good to go.

Bruv. Go to search and put in "dual 6374 trucks". You get your answer within the first result. Omg that was so hard.... Weve heard the same old song and dance before....

It took me months to start my first build, an easy 3 days of reading through the forum to be exact. Thatâ€™s 72 hours of helpful feedback that has been written already in the forum

Better yet, here.

Dude has 1hr read time and is being helped. Why you might ask? Because he shows that he has actively search what he is building. 

We cant tell you what board you will like because you may not like what we like (comfort wise). Please, do your research, get us a parts list of what you would like to use and we can go from there. We're more than willing to help as long as you help yourself first. Fair?
