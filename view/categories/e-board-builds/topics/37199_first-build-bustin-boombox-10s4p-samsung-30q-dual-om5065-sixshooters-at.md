Hi all, thanks for all info on this forum....i've been reading this forum for the last 2 weeks!! It's insanely good!

I am starting my first build single motor (TB 6374 190KV). I need help on how to take de best torque out of it (as i live in a hilly area - 15% - i have 75kg/165lbs), and still want a good range of around 32km/20 miles. I don't really mind going much faster, as the asphalt in my neighboardhood is terrible (that's why i am going with 90mm wheels but down the road will change to 97mm, i think).

My parts list (ordered so far):
- <b>Deck Bustin Boombox (stiff) - 38''  - Battery + Eletronics space - 20''x6'' (i could push a little). </b>

- <b>TB 90mm Wheels (i think i will change to 97mm down the road)</b>

- <b>TB Nano Remote</b>
collections/remote-controller/products/torqueboards-2-4ghz-nano-remote-controller

- <b>50units of Battery Panasonic NCR18650PF 2900mAh - 10A discharge rate</b>


To summarize the questions in my head:
- Initially i was thinking on 10s4p, but not sure what i am loosing not going to 12s4p. Just top-speed? Or also loosing some torque ?
- 60k erpm limit. I would be very close with 12s4p. Would i be safe?
- Need advise on BMS/Charging port connectors and on/off switch.
- Enclosures!!!! Need some help here. I was thinking on building one with Kydex....but not completelly sure.

Can't wait to receive the rest of the parts...still 30days away (i live in Brazil).

Thanks guys.

Personally, I think 10s4p is a nice place to be. Lots of power and enough top speed.

Why not use higher discharge cells so you can have a smaller pack? A 3P of 30Qs would be able to discharge more amps than a 5P of these.

Lol don't be sad, I personally love those cells, just too pricey, they barely sag at full load for miles, I have a 7s3p I run at 28A

@Guacamoleface I saw that you used hot iron solder on your board....how the batteries are holding on?..any issue so far?

I Just split the battery, and all solderspots seem fine. Used for one summer on rough pavement.
Getting a spotwelder early next week so building a new one with another structure. But battery held up nice.
Soldering was a hell of a job because you have to solder one parallell and let it rest and cool down before soldering it again. Took quite somw time just due to keeping heat distribution down

hi all, all my parts arrived. I decided to change couple of things.

Thanks to @NickTheDude  , i have change the batteries to Samsung 30Q. Still 10S4P.

I also changed de Motor mount to reversed to use the little tail Bustin deck has. Will post more pics.

I have to say that my first battery pack was a challenging one. Thanks to @darkkevind i was able to spot weld my pack using his car battery+solenoid welder! Not perfect Welds, but good enough. Thanks there!

To build it, i have used the @whitepony schema below. On the edges (where the current flows) i used double nickel strips 0.15mm x 8mm.

On the edges, to link the 5 packs of 2S4P i have soldered 10wg wire to a nickel support, and then welded on the pack. I did not weld directly to the pack as i was afraid to transfer too much heat to the cells, as i am not an experienced welder.

I still need to connect BMS cables. This is how the pack is looking so far.

Hey man, glad I could be of some assistance.

Yeah those welds take some practice to get right with that welder, but once you get it... oh boy! :slight_smile:

Good work :thumbsup:

Ok - i am one more luck guy that received DRV error. I was playing with firmware 2.54 changing controle mode to current and etc, and with no reason TB VESC stoped, i went to the terminal type "fault", none showed. After i type "faults", a bunch of DRV appeared. Is VESC really dead?

Ok - after after couple of months, lot's of reading and waiting for the new parts do arrive....and after the "DRV" of death, the build changed a litle bit....to be honest, changes were huge: 

- Bought new motors - Dual OM5065 from @chaka 
- Decided to go AT - bought @psychotiller sixshooters
- Dual Focbox - @longhairedboy 
- Enclosure....have to say that the 3d printed enclosure was not good enought (very weak) - so i bought psychos 405.
- New Mounts from @marcmt88
- TB218 Trucks @torqueboards 
- Controller Enertion NanoX
- Gear ratio 14/60

Going back on the build log:

- Changed battery heat shrink wrap to add more flex (i was worried about deck flex) and organized the bms-lead cables:

![20180324_163933|666x500](upload://zAItimNuwz3l8rwVkYCYJWKfOSY.jpg)

- Put the 6'' AT and wheel bite came to hunt me....yeah...had to extend wheel base as much as i could:
![20180405_123217|666x500](upload://dPzqzqtvYRUvdpwoaeQiblwgseL.jpg)

- My cat was not happy with the mess on her area...LOL
![20180407_194549|666x500](upload://yEFdEVXyU7dF7BarXX2wQhjoUEm.jpg)

- Deck wrapping on Carbon vinyl using wrap-cut...pretty easy...
![20180421_103100|666x500](upload://onDKT1m5f8gi0nW2H4OA6bmpbGY.jpg)
![20180421_123649|375x500](upload://hdwTsYs6SVn6CZwrt92re9BdbhE.jpg)

- All parts ready to come together :slight_smile: 
![20180421_161053|375x500](upload://4lbRTDkAwj4VEFpBJMlsDTayh6e.jpg)

- Installing LCD / eswitch and charging port

![20180429_095952|375x500](upload://8CshY3sUQkabveMgmvEXiB1NAlE.jpg)

- Putting everything together with good rubber seal around the enclosure:
![20180429_093135|666x500](upload://iNU7aD7RNxJu6IQ9LxiljifOJLT.jpg)

- That's all folks:
![20180501_220118|666x500](upload://qNUstCroYXBtMyF2PMkyLstGCgr.jpg)
![20180501_220142|666x500](upload://nWkZLIei55jsWwnSanO0m5kYSUn.jpg)![20180501_220136|666x500](upload://pQu8mFop3UKfJnkIJ6NP9ZeFFz0.jpg)

My last throughs:
- After i extended the wheel base, deck became more flexy, pressing hard batteries in the enclosure.
- It's a bit high from the ground for me....i think a drop through would be a better choice
.....right now i am working to get this build on a new deck....a Landyachtz DropSpeed...let's see how it goes...

These things never ends...lol...the only constant is change...
