Update: So after some more research and thought, I have further refined and zeroed in on how I want my E-Board to look like and perform. Here is my updated parts list and explanations:

Note: The board will be built around my weight, height, budget, and personal preference. I‚Äôll take any constructive criticism happily.

I weigh ~145-150Ibs (66-68Kgs), 5‚Äô11" tall, male, currently 17.

Mechanical, non Electric:

* Deck will be made of 3 x 3/16" Plywood w/ Fiberglass tape in-between layers. Bonded with Bondo Fiberglass Resin. The deck will be 10" wide and 42" long. I want stability.
* The Trucks will be 2 x Caliber II (44 Deg.) and will be drop through. Nothing special. They got good reviews, are very common, and very cheap. They‚Äôre 10" wide axles, so overall width w/ wheels will be over 1‚Äô. This will also increase stability.
* Wheels will be 4 x Cal 97mm wheels. They‚Äôre cheap, got good reviews, and large. I want higher speeds than acceleration.
* The pulley setup is a bit iffy. I will go for a ratio of ~2-3. I don‚Äôt got any hills to go over around me, at least significant, so I‚Äôll prefer speed. The motor gear, or input will be a 20T, 10mm bore. I can‚Äôt seem to find any reasonable priced and ‚Äògood‚Äô quality gear for the motors. They are expensive (~$100 for two sets) and that would be ~40-42T. Recommendations? 10mm belt(s).

Electrical:

* I‚Äôll be running a dual drive system. The motors a will be 2 x 6374‚Äôs. I was going to go with ‚ÄúHobbysky‚Äù motors, but they are $80/Ea. Too much. I know going with unbranded Chinese motors is iffy, but spending ~$180 is too much.
* I‚Äôll go with two Focbox systems. They seem to be popular and good. Not to cheap, but reasonable.
* A cheap, ~$30 Tx/Rx. Nothing special.
* I‚Äôve updated my battery system as well. I want to go with Zop 5200mah 50C 3S Li-Po‚Äôs. They get good reviews on eBay and Bangood. I‚Äôll buy them from eBay. The seller is selling 4 of them for only $100! That‚Äôs awesome! I will be running 12S4P, so 11.1V (3S) x 4 cells = 44V. Than i‚Äôll add 3-4 more in Parallel to increase capacity.
* I‚Äôll bypass BMS, but will charge w/ BMS.
* The charger will be a Power Supply rated for 60V @ 5A.

So, that‚Äôs about it for now. Any corrections, recommendations, etc are welcome. Here is the parts list with links on Google Sheets. Total price right now is around ~$800.

your list is looking good. a few things though. if you want to run 12s4p with those lipos you're gonna need 16 of those 3s1p packs. (i think thats a bit much...?)
Also, your charger is best rated at 50.4v. 60v is a bit much (I'll probably get people saying it's fine because the bms cuts out anyway but honestly 50.4v is what you want.
All I'm gonna say is, you'll spend more spending less. ü§ôüèº

Why would I need 16 x 3S Batteries though? My math was 11.1V (1 battery) x 4 = 44.4V (12S). Than I would add 4(maybe less) more batteries in parallel. Total is 12S(?)p. I might reduce parallel. Is that math wrong?

I believe @mynamesmatt response is related to your comment about running 12S4P.  The battery you are looking at is 1P.  That‚Äôd require 16 of those batteries to get to 4P. 

[quote="JosephShubin, post:1, topic:75288"]
I will be running 12S4P
[/quote]

I‚Äôd recommend just buying a deck, unless you‚Äôre really into building your own. You can get a decent skateshred deck for around $40 + grip tape and shipping. Will probably save you a lot of time and work.

ya your maths is wrong. what you create here is essentially one 12s1p lipo pack, and then another pack which is either 12s1p (4 packs in series) as well or one 3s4p pack. you can run the 2 12s1p in parallel to create a 12s2p pack, or 2 separate packs. you cant just add one more 3s pack to get more range it dun work

Man, I just can't wrap my head around that. Each battery is a 3s lips, rated at 11.1V. Putting 4 in series makes 44.4V, or 12S. Thats right...? So what I cant just add 3-4 more of these, in parallel to increase capacity? Is it because the batteries are 3S1P? Do I just get other batteries? How would I than wire up a 12S3-4P?
Thank you!

Hey all, first time poster. Not sure I‚Äôm in the right place, but having trouble getting answers out of anybody. Was hoping you all could help me figure some stuff out. I want my first electric longboard. Don‚Äôt know if I should build or buy a board. Mainly because I weigh 275 not including gear and am about 5‚Äô10. Should I go with hub or belt? Any advice would be awesome!

I'm still designing my first E-Board, getting parts, etc. It really takes time and you want to spend time doing research, but to answer your question(s), build the board around yourself. Here are a few questions you should answer first.
- Budget?
- Speed/range requirements?
Also, if you are building a board, it will take more time, screw-ups, etc. Basic electrical and mechanical knowledge is like needed, or you will burn your board down.

My build is very much like yours. Same motors, trucks, duel focboxs. I think your going to find that trying to get your motors and your motor mounts and trucks and wheel hubs can be a challenge. The clearance between your wheel hubs gears and your motor is a problem. If you've got it figured out great if not let me know i'll show you pics of what i mean  about the clearance between the motors.

Ok ill try. You're making a 12s1 out of four 3s1 lipo packs. Now to make it a 12s2 you will have to make another 12s1. Meaning four more 3s1 lipos. You now have eight 3s1 lipos. Want to make it 12s3? Add another 12s1, which means four more 3s1 lipos. You now have 12 lipos making a 12s3. Want 12s4? Add four more 3s1 for a grand total of 16 3s1 lipos. Follow?

Buy a pre built, ride it, learn it, fix it if it breaks, get familiar with it, work on it, eventually start upgrading it. If you feel comfoetable after all that, build yourself a board.

Sorry for late reply. Been doing a lot of reading on how to build a board. I bought a meepo V2 to start with and plan on upgrading the battery soon. Haven‚Äôt decided how I‚Äôm going to do it. But I‚Äôm thinking 2 10s20p packs in parallel or the 10s5p from diyeboard. Not sure about the latter. I‚Äôve spent hours studying battery basics and some stuff still eludes me. So I don‚Äôt know if it will work.

Ask away. 
Reading others builds and just searching the forum is your best bet.
Unless you're trying to do something groundbreaking all of the information is out there.
Sometimes people will take the time to just answer your questions but sometimes they'll tell you to go look for yourself

I‚Äôve been lurking on here for awhile lol. Looked at builds for heavier riders in hilly areas. I‚Äôve got some ideas. Here they are: 
TB 6374 190 kv x2 
TB 218 trucks
TB caliber truck clamps x2 
TB 63 mm motor mount x2 
TB 14t 15mm motor pulley and 36t drive wheel pulley x2 
I don‚Äôt know which battery to choose, but I‚Äôm thinking Lipos probably 10s but I also want more than 7 mile range. So I guess I‚Äôd have to parallel some lipos together? 
I‚Äôve been told the ESC is the most important part of the build, but don‚Äôt know which ones to get. I‚Äôve looked at Foc boxes and fsesc. Don‚Äôt know which would be best. 
I really like the Landyachtz switchblade 40‚Äô‚Äô but don‚Äôt know if it would have the ground clearance. My budget isn‚Äôt unlimited by any means, but I also want a great board. I‚Äôll be buying parts 1 or 2 at a time so it might take me a little while to build. But damn I really want this to happen

Okay so smaller wheels will give you more torque but if you want bigger wheels for a smother ride you can adjust pullys and or motor kv.
So 15t-40t and you can run those 97mm,100,mm,107mm wheels still. 
And or find 170kv motors.

So even if you order now you won't get your Unity until March. First batch just went out.
It's supposed to be great but it hasn't pain in the hands of the DIY seen much seeing that it's barely just released.
The focboxes are solid tho.  Especially on 10s.
I don't know much about lipos....

You could fit 4x 5s in a similar but slightly taller case. Maybe and inch taller. But yes they'll fit. The case I have holds 2x 4s stacked on that their sides perfectly. So if you went 5s you'd have to get a slightly bigger case.

At that point you're spending about 300 on a battery that's on a odd shape.
Un less you know how to take packs apart and reshape them

I would be willing to spend up to 300 on the right battery. It will take time but I could swing it

So if I take say x2 5s 5000mah lipos and put them in series. That wouldn‚Äôt increase the mah correct? It would increase voltage I believe?

It would increase voltage but not capacity. For series connections you add the voltage's and the capacity reamins the same. For parallel connections you add the capacity and the voltage's stay the same. @Jgarrison34

id go with 5x 2s lipos and with a c rating of atleast 60c. look at what @Namasaki did for his build. its actully what im building right now myself.

Okay that looks doable. The whole BMS for charging thing looks intimidating lol. Are you gonna do that or balance charge?

 bms charge. i felt the same when i was in your position. use the search function and you should be able to find a lot of info. i know its intimidating but you can do it.

I saw the diagram @Namasaki made for his electronics setup. It made a kind of sense. I think I could do it actually. So basically after you wire the 5 2s batteries in series you then use the balance leads on each pack and plug them into the bms in order. What wires were used on the bms side of the Connection?? Then positive goes to VESC and negative goes to b- on bms? Plus there is the charging port that I don‚Äôt quite get, and a couple other things. Sorry to bombard you lol. If you don‚Äôt want to answer all these questions it‚Äôs okay. 
Awesome! Maybe we could ride together sometime? 
I‚Äôm getting a meepo V2 for Christmas so I‚Äôll have something to ride until I can get this board built. 
I‚Äôm in the suburbs north of the perimeter

yeah it just all depends on what bms you get. charge port - goes to either the c- or p- depending on the bms. and the positive for the charge port should be connected to the pack positive wire. you should be able to find tons of diagrams on the fourm.  
I don't know what you mean by this

hat wires were used on the bms side of the Connection??

the wires that are plugged into the bms 1-10. I looked like they‚Äôre we‚Äôre balance wires coming from the batteries and then a connection to those wires that then went to the bms. Hope I explained that right lol

The bms comes with a adapter that is female to male. You plug the male end into the battery blance port and the female into the bms
