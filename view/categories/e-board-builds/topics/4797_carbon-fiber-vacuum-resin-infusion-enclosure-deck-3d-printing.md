After I put 100 miles on my first build with a lunch box as battery enclosure, I decide to make one myself.I'll be carbon fiber deck since I have experience with vacuum infusion process.  I'd like to start a thread that shows how I make a mold and do vacuum infusion process as I go.

  I  started designing 2 weeks ago and made mold but my old vacuum failed on me while the resin was infused into the mold so I ordered a new pump.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/02a03a0db5a8290f76295132a5b200c4ffc47df7.jpg" width="666" height="500">
My first build:Nothing fancy with Car esc with 6s setup.

Initially,I wanted to have the lid on the top but might be difficult to do it because it 'll be one sided mold so it's a bottom enclosure.

Thank you for the kind word @Tarzan. @lox897 I buy individual parts,  I bought my first vacuum infusion kit 3 years ago when I started, the Vacuum pump that came with the kit failed on me last week I'll post the pictures later.:pensive: It should last 20 years.

Yes,I did. while checking the connections the barb plastic connector broke off  I guess the oil residue makes the plastic piece weak over time so I ordered oil less pump.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/4b636f8a2ae48ef57b6e296a92f1b870444cc50a.jpg" width="300" height="300">

As you see, the cloth wasn't fully saturated in the edges.

wow, thats really beautiful with a mold - a perfect finish "for free", exact sharp features and you can replicate it as much as you want. really impressive!!

whats the big bonus of vacuum infusion vs laminating by hand and then bagging?

Thank you for your kind word.
The biggest advantage I think is the strength. The main goal is to fully saturate the cloth with the resin especially with the multi layers of cloth then remove the accessed resin effectively without burbles and keep in mind that you have only 60 to 90 minutes to do so after that, it won't flow as much and thinning the resin is very important before the infusion.

The technic that I leaned a couple of years ago was to make sure the resin reaches the vacuum line in the other side so catch pot is a must.

This is a modified one.  The resin never enter the vacuum pump.don't ask me how I know.:disappointed_relieved:

Last weekend, I tried longboard resin infusion. I never tried this thickness(goal:5mm thick) before. I was little worried that if it would flow well in this thickness with a small pump.

Next time when I do it again I'll go thicker.(10mm) instead of 5mm or use core material to add rigidity.

Mastercho what do u think...Another member here evoheyax and I have been cutting 1/16 inch maple lams on his x-carve cad mill and planning to glue them down using my vacuum bag and a mold.  So vacuum bag pressure to form the shape as done by roarocket.com.  The wood is slow to cut and I'd like to chose a single sheet core of something like your honeycomb core.   I'm imagining I could take the shape of another deck easily using a 3/4inch sheet just laying it down and wetting it out, then once cured doing a traditional vacuum bag job with carbon.  ?  I'm wondering what core youd recommend and if this sounds doable to u?  Cutting all the wood lams is so slow and this seems much easier

@Hummie,It'll work.The honeycomb core is very flexible so it can be shaped any foam you want,but the core itself is nothing more than Styrofoam(air between layers) to give rigidity. I suggest to use as sandwich structure with a couple of sheets(Fiberglass,kevlar or Carbon fiber cloth).

There are so many core materials available.  Any you think would be best suited?  I'd like it to be 3/4 inch and easily form to the mold without any outside force, then wet it out, and then be able to sustain a vacuum bag pressure when later adding carbon without collapsing

And later I'd want it not to deteriorate with flexing on the board.  
And I guess I'd have to add inserts with the foam core. Like to find something that could be simpler

Would it be bad to run a bar through the board to provide stiffness? Sandwiched between the CF? Or is that asking for trouble later on?

Bar of what?  Foam is good. Aluminum if it's electrically insulated is heavier but probably better. Strength wise. An aluminum bar wouldn't make such a nice shape though. Foam is easily formed and ends really rigid and strong after infusion or wetting out or whatever it's called

Tthat works but with a light core u can have the strength and stiffness as long as u have the carbon on the outside in compression or better yet tension.   Steel would be overkill. Even aluminum would be unnecessary.  Lot of carbon boards have just foam core


But I see in that link mastercho posted aluminum honeycomb

Mastercho that stuff, honeycomb, I was worried about the edge and making it smooth.  And it will need inserts for the trucks.  Maybe not too hard to do...more so worried about doing the edge

Corematt looks good.  I've seen that and think it might be good.  Sucks a lot of resin though

For this one,apply this core and let it cure then apply another layer of sheet on the top to keep the air inside.

repeat until you get the thickness you want just like stacking sandwiches together.:hamburger:

For the edge, I would give a couple of thick layers on the bottom and top.

That last material u posted. Do u rhink a thick piece could handle a vacuum or would it compress after it had already been wetted out and hardened?  I'd like to cut it to shape, wet it and cute it on the mold with no vacuum, then I'm hoping when vacuuming later with carbon it will not compress. Compress?

So not stacking just foam center and carbon layers on the outside

Cool! 
So it could be lighter AND more ridged then the first design while being the same thickness?
Also, I see the mold blank is 3D printed, and the mold is made from the printed part, what is the mold material? 
Is the board housing for the electronics part of the actual board? 
Or are the two pieces attached together separately?

Yes, I want to add rigidity using the core it'll be thicker.

For the mold, I used gel-coat for the first layer then polyester resin with glass fiber sheets.

this video looks to me like that dude is doing everything wrong. like this he filled the honeycombs completely with resin, no? also, why would you set the hose directly in the middle, leaving an ugly resin bubble instead of somewhere outside the plate with breather layer connected?

I dont get the honeycomb resin thing - its very clear with foam, since these foams dont have connected cavities, the resin wont enter except for the surface, so there you have a "mostly air" material that is strong under pressure with the encapsulating fibers:

honeycomb core is another form of The Foam that has channels to help flow the resin.

@MasterCho if I am looking to do it for much less cost, the carbon fiber fabric alone would come out to be $300 (if I were to use 5 sheets of 12k 815gsm and 4 of 3k 203gsm). How would I go about getting the price down? The honeycomb still costs $30 per sheet. What would you reccomend to get the price down? If I use the honeycomb (since it is thicker) do I only need a couple sheets of CF? What order would you recommend for the layers?

 0 FLEX.

I learned that giving more curved edge is the main factor for rigidity.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/e7a28d7e5798cf3cf55161b76e026af2f3c7bd74.jpg" width="690" height="388">

Wow. I'm hugely interested in this and was just looking at divinycell again wondering if I should listen to u and use the honeycomb stuff. I've been told by fiberglasssupply that using my deck as the mold won't work and I need to make one.  If need be I'll do that but I'm imagining making an infusion bag that would fit on a deck could work. ?

I have a bunch of carbon, heaviest weave I could find,  I want to get the heaviest easiest to contort stuff I can. What u think? What u said before I guess 

How to chose a core. Divinycell corecell or the stuff u mentioned.

@Hummie, I assume they said it won't work because it needs an extended surface to be used as a barrier from resin getting in the back side of the deck. 

Making a mold is pretty easy. I would use a 1/8 acrylic panel and shape it with a heat gun, then fill the gap with clay to prevent resin from getting in.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/bba8418ce42c84eb1891b1ba89a7a9d069767621.jpg" width="666" height="500">

 The heavier of a cloth you go, the more difficult it is to work with. Just make sure the resin flows all the way to the bottom.I assume you are going to do a resin infusion? I used 4 sheets of 815gsm carbon cloth (each replaces 4 sheets of regular carbon 200gsm) plus 2 sheets of honey comb core sheets(Although, I think 1 sheet is enough).Otherwise, it'll be much harder to wet it layer by layer if you do a hand layup with resin because time is running out and it starts curing in an hour.

See how fast it flows with resin infusion:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBpl7wFHVgo  Once it reaches  the other side, leave the vacuum running for 5 hours to remove gas (air) and excess resin.    

I chose http://lantor.com/lantor-soric/ because it used a flow channel has fast resin flow combined with optimized weight reduction.

Also,You can use Vinyl Sheet Foam,Balsa wood etc.

I guess u cut the deck out of the complete rectangle? And then did another layer to finish it?

I want to make it as least laborious as possible.  Don't we all.  I'd like to cut the core and carbon before infusion and have it pop out done!  I don't want to bother with a smooth finish.  what kind of method do you think would allow me to precut the core and fabric and then impregnate and then pop! The edge seems the obstacle and I'd also have to thicken the truck mounting area.  I want to approach this as simply pouring a composite mold.

I finished it all at once then cut it out. 

Are you referring to Prepreg Fabrics? then you need a big oven.

"Prepreg is the common term for fabric reinforcement that has been pre-impregnated with a resin system. The resin system is typically an epoxy and already includes the proper curing agent. As a result, it's ready to lay into a mold without the addition of resin or the steps required of a typical hand lay-up."

Very easy to cut and apply then bag it and put it in an oven  done.

It's hard to prevent CF from fraying,I use the painter's tape but can't peel it off.

Honesty,It's not hard to cut at all,It took me only 20-30 minutes to cut it out and sanding. For the mounting area,I would cut the core out replace with 1/4 inch or thicker wood piece and do resin infusion all together.

O shit I thought it was healthy.  But it cuts pretty easily for me. Kevlar is harder 

Mastercho the seam where the carbon meets at the edge of the mold, how do u leave it exactly?  i always see core filled boards with the carbon sealing it, can you do a board with the core exposed?  Construction similar to what this picture shows but instead using a core, or how about a one glue-up job and done wood core with preglued laminates all throw In the bag, and sucked down to the mold?  Maybe the vacuum wouldn't be strong enough to pull the wood down but what core would go well with that method?  I'm going to make a fiberglass mold tomorrow if I must.  I don't see why I couldn't simply make the silicone bag using the deck? Then use the deck as the mold for the layers of carbon and core? Then pop it out and sand the edge and give it a coat of urethane and have the exposed core on the side?

guess now knowing in advance what setup is required for which flex is the high art of board crafting. i got a little suprised by my latest spud stiffness myself! 

@Hummie i think it should be possible in a hand layup to use yourboard as mold. just make the foam core 1-2cm smaller than the original, like a shrinked version. that will allow sealing your edge! then you use release film, carbon, foam core, carbon, bleeder, breather -> vacuum bag, done!! I will try that one day! :slight_smile:

Adding core and curved edge make quite a difference. 

Flex test. (Ultra Flex).
This is my son doing it,he weights about 130 pounds

The second one,

0 Flex.

For the base mold, I used acrylic panel bending to a base wood board.

 Pylonflyer you ever do a vacuum infusion? I got all my vacuum infusion parts and as soon as I get enough riding in:grin:I'll start.  (was out riding tonight and dragged a motor wire and cut it but it's easily fixable by tomorrow).  
I got divinycell in half, quarter, and eighth inch sheets for the core.  everything in my mind is going great with the plan but I dont know the way to add the steel brackets for reinforcement around the screws.  what would make a good insert? 

 take the deck out of the bag, push plugs out of the holes, sand the edges for 5 minutes and done.  What  do you think mastercho, as apposed to having to cut the shape out make the mold.  it will take a bit of time to make the mold but when it's done ..it's like a crockpot

im using the bustin sportster as the mold.  it will need extensions using plywood so that it extends 8 inches beyond.  and wax to make sure theres no overhang.  simply a big table with a recess in it the shape of the board.  make of fiberglass.  doesnt even have to have a nice finish.  i wont do it.  no polishing.  easy.  when the table is made. anything you can fit within the lip is fair game.  
it's a drop thru deck.  i'll do my 48 brown cells.  nice to see theyve been keeping balanced.  maybe I'm deluding myself but they seem safe enough to me that they dont need to be constantly watched.

I would say little bit lighter to compare to a wood deck but not much different because I used 4 layers of cloth(815gsm) plus 1 layer(200gsm)with Honeycomb Core material (foam /air) . But i think it's possible to go lighter with less cloth and the Core without losing the rigidity.

It has to be stuck to the acrylic or wood panel.  Then simply fill the seam with a bit of wax so there's no overhang when the mold is done. Maybe acrylic is easier.  Has to be solidly connected long enough to then do the fiberglass molding of it.

i think ill do wood inserts and drill it after it cures.  easy enough.  put a level across the  points while 
it cures would be nice
I still cant imagine how the fabric is going to lay and how the corner will end up .  i have a fear the fabric will relax and not be a skin on the core.  maybe I can pin it with a couple spots of glue to hold it.   
i have the bustin sportster pro which is thin with a carbon layer on top and bottom with wood core.  i was going to use it as the mold but pulled the trigger and bit the bullet and got the older wood version thats fatter with all wood...make a deeper mold.

the divinycell cuts really easily.  I'm just going to cut it around the deck while using a heat gun to contort to the curves.  this part will take the longest I think.  If i had the shape already cut out.. or poured of expanding foam in a mold it would be even easier.  you could pop these out so quickly.  so my armchair view sees.

I have my huge can of 77 and am really excited to see how this is going to go. It's taken me so long because I did everything the slow way.  

What do you think of the mold?  It's deep and at first I thought that would be good but will it matter? 

I have 12oz bi-axial and the stuff in the picture and I was hoping u could tell me what it is and what to do next!...how many layers u think I'll want of those fabrics for this sliver of foam!   The thinnest part is an 1/8" and it's a huge span of it. I have some wood insets I'd be putting for the trucks and I'd be doing it now if they were around. Maybe tomorrow throw it all in. 

After I put the 8 small bits of plywood in where the holes will be, and then sand the foam down a bit because plywood is thinner, and punch holes all around for the resin to connect both sides, then I'll try to pin down the fabric with the glue, and when that's done I'll roll the dice 

I'm going to try to make a cookie cutter out of copper again with different thickness, cutting and sanding the divinycell80 by hand even though it's much easier than wood takes a large amount of time and instead I'd like to use thin stuff and cookie cut it.

@Hummie The mold looks great!  not sure what the white patches on the surface. Did you use polyester resin? Just make sure the mold surface is smooth without the small pinholes otherwise, it might be hard to de-mold and leads to the vacuum leaks later on. Also,I would trim the edge around the mold and sand it sightly to prevent from the skin irritations and puncturing the bagging film when you handle it

I should've used polyester resin, cheaper, by its epoxy.  The white spots are epoxy putty smoothing things. 
The mold surface where it will touch the part is smooth but the rest is a mess and even sticky a bit. But the center is good and smooth 
How many layers of those fabrics do you think I should use?

I'm in bed slacking...tomorrow I'll do it.  
The only plywood are little square bits that I cut and I'll insert into the divinicell where I cut spots for them
The core is all divinicell 80 density other than those tiny spots.  I cut it with a paper template I made. It cuts very easily.  It sands very easily. It's very expensive. It's fancy stuff. It also bends to the shape of the mold easily now that I'm using layers thinner stuff.  Mastercho the bamboo is what I'd like to try next.  It seems to be much cheaper and cut easily and will conform to the mold. Sounds ideal.  I don't want a brick for a board and a bit of flex would be nice and wood is nice. Try to find the balance of stiffness and flex in the future.  Far future 
If only materials could be cut with a cookie cutter this could be really easy.

 At the part that'll need some finesse and and waiting for another set of hands to help me later tonight. Still plan to suck it through tonight 

I stare at it and stare at the mold and feel the fabric and wonder how I'm going to get all those layers on nicely and with the rounded edges and also the drop thru.  I'm going to cut the fabric a bit bigger than the template and have a bit of overlap on the edges I think, adhere it down and do that layer by layer.  Doing it the standard infusion method as mastercho has done it where u just layer the fabric and then cut it out AFTER would be easier. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/1/d1e5d82e3ef8e61ca8e2152107f920ee0520efa2.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/6/96a0ab0e05c0cb3d569924bd7d2d78c393d7a588.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/d/8da71cc28bdb86cb1762044460299554d6e47fc0.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7

@MasterCho I gave up on trying to wrap the core with the fabric using the spray.  especially with the contour of the drop thru it was hard to get the fabric to follow the curves and I started spraying a lot and it still wasn't that good so changed directions and was going to do a traditional vacuum infusion but not excited about the shape I would end up with and the work it will need to cut it out assuming I even could get that far and don't screw up the first time. 
I made the mold and have a bunch of infusion materials but I'm changing directions and not going to bother even doing the fusion once.  Not so much giving up as realizing it isn't going to make what I want.  I stared at it enough and no solutions are coming up. A lot of time and money lost but it's ok. 

   I want a curved edge board similar to the evolve.  I have to do it another way.  Tomorrow I'm not working and will be on it all day. Tell me what you think:  I want to make a hard mold that I can fill with an expanding foam or other material that will be stiff and then take that piece and use it for a carbon layup and vacuum bag.  

I'll call smooth-on for sure and search for a good foam and also a good cheap mold material but what do you think?  Even a concrete mold would do maybe. As long as the foam can be rigid enough to sustain the vacuum.  Maybe not an expanding foam but a slurry of wood particles and glue or something I could fill it with.  There's something or multiple things out there. If I have that mold I could try different cores, maybe a natural wood particle filler and I've seen some natrual fabric replacements for fiberglass.  In the future. 

what do you think of this construction method?

The goal is to get a shaped core that I can then wrap and just vacuum bag.  I also have two of the skate decks I could use when doing the vacuum to help the core hold the shape if necessary.

@Hummie , If I understood your plan correctly It should work. 

One thing that I would do differently is that I use the thick CF cloth as structure layers only I would trim the shape as the core and spry glue them(3 layers each side) on the top and bottom of your foam core that you made and I would place the thin cosmetic CF layer on the bottom of the mold then wrap it toward to the center to get the nice edges, since it's thin layer the over lap shouldn't be a problem on the top or  you can sand it flat after the cure.

For the mold, I use fiberglass chopped strand mat with polyester resin and tooling gel coats.

Please refer to the video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgKvDw1E60E

Often, I get questions about how to make a deck like Evolves or enertions.
 It needs two sided mold and glue them together with epoxy glue after the de molding.
  
The video is 10 years old  but the method is still the same.

The mold still leaked after many coverings of epoxy and rubber.  It seemed leak-free or at least none that were obvious and I ran the resin through. 
Big expensive fuck up.  

The part and all the carbon are ruined.   I was comfortable ruining them as it was the first time I tried it.  The part I'm not happy about is both my vacuum pumps that were in series are now jammedand the catch pot didn't catch it all.  One jammed and I disconnected it and then the second died.   Better be fixable. 

I'm not done I'm still gunna make this happen with another better mold and better catch pot.  Learning the hard way

I have been using an oil-less pump it hasn't failed on me yet, knock on wood and no smell but still loud.

I would've traded u if u had a nice pic of the simplest thing but it's too late now and I'm hooked on my own plan.  I'm putting the hammer down and gettin it done at rocket speed this week.  I had to fail once. If the pumps are ruined I don't know and maybe will try to salvage them.  But really liking doing a hand pump on a homemade silicone bag. 
https://www.smooth-on.com/applications/vacuum-bagging/
The roarocket pump I have is claimed to do 29inches of mercury, will that be enough?  I'll be looking for a simple strong manual vacuum pump.

Now that I might have ruined my electric pumps and I found them loud I'm going to find the best manual vacuum pump design I can find and make that. If I can hit 29.5 i should be good for making tires...and how strong a vacuum is needed for an infusion?  Does it just equate to less resin and lighter, because that's not important to me I don't think. As long as u can run resin through it with no air voids sounds good. 

But really what I want to know and I think you answered, how to get the curved edges with doing a single infusion? And no cutting it out after.

The number is very impressive as manual vacuum pump.

The one I use is http://www.fibreglast.com/product/4924/Vacuum_Bagging_Pumps.
 It can pull 1.1 CFM at 25.5" Hg (mercury),It's more than enough for my project. I wouldn't go too high, it might remove too much resin.

To get the curved edges, I would make my own thick(7-8mm) core material(veneers,CF cloth,fiber glass,etc)

1.Trim the shape you want.(veneers,CF cloth,fiber glass)
2.Spray glue them together(7-8mm)

 3.Use it as a core.
4.place 1 cosmetic CF (200g) layer on top and bottom.
5.Infusion

You need to trim after the cure but it's going to be very thin and easy to trim.

I got a new 2 stage pump coming and catch pot/chamber and more carbon and divinicell and just put the final bulking fiberglass mat on the mold. 

much easier this time.. glued the landyachtz 40"switchblade's grip tape to a sheet of plastic with the 77 spray and there's the plug.   a much less curved mold like urs than the dumb tub I did last time.  

Parts should be here in a couple days and I'll have the divinicell shaped by then. And then bam!  I love the vacuum infusion method.  Gunna get bamboo soon.  So many different materials.  


You mention a lesser vacuum being better.  I forget the number u said.  Hoping my new pump will do 29.5 inches Mercury because I want to degass polyurethane, but u say that's more than needed.  Have u tried doing a stronger vacuum?

Nice! I always get excited when new materials arrive.:clap:

25- 30 Hg  should be fine for the project as we do. 
No,I haven't used a stronger vacuum but I am sure for large projects, you need the bigger one or two small ones to run.

I think the idea is that the adequate amount of resin needs to be fed without getting removed or little at the same time,needed a good amount of time to wet the cloth. I am sure you will notice when you see the result(after the cure), 
For instance,
If the surface has lots of small pinholes and still feel the texture of cloth that means it has been removed too much.
If the surface looks fine but on the backside you see one side is thicker than other sides and looks puffy that means it's too rich.

Hats off to you both (@Hummie and @MasterCho) - great looking setups and results.

I'm dabbling in CF and want to try Vacuum bagging again (probably just regular not infusion).  Totally sucks your pumps sucked some resin - dead huh?

@Wanderer got the manual roar pump - he said it worked pretty well.

An alternative i found poking around online is the EVS refurb pump, or similar industrial oil-free constant duty pumps.  I stumbled across a clearance of a used Welch 2585 vacuum pump on fleabay for ~$100! (new something f'ing ridiculous like $1700!)  7 CFM - not as quiet as 2 stage robinair, but also doesn't spit exhaust/oil fog!

Hope to give it a shot soon.

Where are you located Hummie?

GL!

@sl33py I'm in San Francisco. Come on by. 
 I'm not sure if my two pumps are salvageable. Probably.  Just too impatient to mess with them now.   I'd gotten them from bestvaluevacs which Is the cheapest I could find.  they've now changed their site a bit and don't claim 29.9 inches of mercury with every pump but I suspect a lot of pump advertising is bull.  Since like 99% of them are being used for marijuana distillation and the strong true 29.9 or close to there isn't needed no one cares.  As soon as u get it sleepy or before u get it suck some 70degree water and see if it will boil. Cool test.  They tried to convince me many times it was doing the job and it was the higher altitude I was at or the gauge.  Except"boiling" can be a bit vague and as soon as it starts to boil the vacuum iS being released. I only ever got to 29.5 with two in series which is good enough for the large majority of resins I've used. ..just couldn't do filled resins 

The handheld roarocket pump is good enough really but it displaces air slowly being the only downside.   A workout but doable.  Might be nice to do with an infusion though being manual and more control maybe and quiet 

Looking for things to do with the pumps.  Other things to do. The best I've come up with, haven't made it yet but, I want to make permenant vacuum chambers, meaning pull a vacuum on a still-to-be-found container that I'd put in my vacuum chamber, seal this container, release the vacuum chamber.  putting the lid on this container somehow is a challenge (magnets or a motor).  Best thing I can think to put inside is just a feather at this point.  Falls like a rock. Know of anything else? Maybe something that could react, some gas that acts differently in a vacuum world. Light sensitive or something. Surely there's something, gas or something, that can do tricks.

Im still trying to figure out what reason there is to use infusion over a hand layup. everything with infusion seems more complicated and everything with hand layup seems nearly foolproof. you need flow channels, you need the right amount of pressure (not too much, not too little), the overall setup is much more complicated and Im still not sure whats the actual benefit of it?

resin infusion used the least amount of resin possible giving the finished item the highest strength to weight ratio because the resin is infused under pressure and only the exact amount ever enters the part, whereas hand layup adds more resin than needed and relies on the vacuum pump to suck out the excess resin into a bleed material.

if you aren't making aircraft or race cars then its not really a huge benefit.

think the pressure determines the amount of resin that will stay in place and therefore the fiber/resin ratio. at least with our small parts which kind of secures that excess resin actually makes it out. 

actually, when I think about it, you apparantly cant apply the maximum pressure with resin infusion in order to make the infusion possible to begin with (and I read that in comments in this thread here too). so im actually not sure if you are right with the "best str to weight ratio".

even though you can probably infuse, when everything saturated you can increase the pressure. but where is the difference to hand layup then?

I kept reading about infusion - the typical upsides are

* less fumes
* potentially less resin (but that could also always mean dry spots in the worst case)
* lower viscosity resin can be used that wets fabric better
* the timeline is stress-free - can take as much time as you want to lay fabric

nevertheless, the more I read, the more I feel like the process prone to more errors. mostly I keep stumbling over dry spots in infusion processes. something like that would never happen in a careful wet hand layup (which, for parts of our size, is extremely easy to do. its more of a problem for large boat hulls or so :stuck_out_tongue: ). the stricter timeline of a hand layup is something that I never felt yet. Im using a slow curing resin that leaves me 40min for getting everything down - thats more than enough time for any possible fail scenario for the typical skateboard sized parts. :slight_smile:

I would imagine that there are benefits for each alternative method, ie hand lay up, vs infusion vs pre-preg. What seems to be more noticeable is that the final composite sheet is just less thick for the pre-preg and infusion methods as opposed to the hand layup method. I am not convinced on why the infusion (or pre-preg) process is the way to go in one-off or short run builds. 

What was noticeably absent from the video was that it did not use a standard recipe of CF fabric sheets for each method, so you couldn't compare apples with apples. 

What would be interesting to note is if the physical properties (strength, torsional flex) of a standard CF fabric sample were different based on the method of its lamination.

I really doubt it ... problem is that there is some confusion/mixups in the net about whats a "hand layup". think many sources consider it as a wet layup with hands and then let it cure (without vacuum, just as in the video). what I mean is laying up the fabrics wet by hand and then fully curing under vacuum pressure. that way you have the same or even harder compression (because you dont have to make sure that resin can still flow through the fabric), most likely the same resin/fiber ratio as in the infusion process, but no chance of "dry patches" that the infusion potentially missed because some channels closed under vacuum or whatever else the reasons are.

What u say about assuring urself it's all wet with a hand layup is true and a big drawback to infusion.  Next run I'm tempted to wet it all out with the thin infusion resin first and then lay it in for the infusion to be safe.  Would be nice not to have to in the future when I figure how to wet it with the infusion. 
Actually I'm making another mold today and going to put carbon stringers through it so as to keep it thin fiberglass so I can see through the bottom better and maybe better assure resin is getting there.  Maybe use flow mesh on the bottom of the mold too @mastercho?  
If u can make a mold that will fit in a vacuum bag, just a slightly contoured stiff plate, that would likely be able to shape the part. I did a wood board in a regular roarocket bag with another board to mold the laminates of wood and it worked well.  
The infusion method is seeming overkill as I continually fuck up molds and attempts. So much fail potential. So much money and time gone.   But when u finally get it right.. Easier and stronger

Yeah, I hear you. There is no real benefit using infusion process over "Wet Lay Up with Vacuum Bag" until you do large projects.

I never do wet hand layups with all these sheets :cold_sweat:

First of alI, to me, it's more convenient.

For example, I have to be at many places on the weekends (family and kid). So in the morning, I would cut out some fabric for 10 min after lunch, bag it, and the next day I would do infusion for 10-20 min.and leave it overnight.

Secondly, it's fast. Regardless of how many layers I placed in the bag, the infusion process shouldn't take more than 12 minutes for a deck and 5 min for an enclosure. I mix it up, grab a hose, and dip it.

There is a learning curve at first because it happens so quickly. After multiple trials and errors, there will be no limit to your creativity.

@Hummie, What kind of epoxy resin are you using?   It should be thin with slow hardener. It flows almost like water.

I am suggesting to do something simple to start with, just to get the idea of how the resin flows and to see where the resin breakpoint should to be etc. Or try hand layup with vacuum bagging. 

Once, you get the hang of it,  you can try the infusion again. I am sure you will have much success.

Resin research 2050 epoxy and 3100f harder.  Fiberglass supply. It's very thin. 

All I have is divinicell and carbon. Haha. No cheaper practice runs possible. Will get bamboo next  

I spent a couple hours making a pattern/plug for a mold by covering the edge of the deck in wax, then realized at the end that the exothermic reaction likely would've melted it into a big mess. So now I just finished clay edges maybe 3" around the deck, and buffed it with wax, and pva mold release.  Almost dry.  Then paint it with polyester resin, then lay on a very thin sheet of fiberglass, then wet it out more, and so on. (I think I'll buy epoxy in bulk to be cheaper because polyester resin is going to dry my neighbors to kill me)

I think just the three inch lip will be enough.  I could tape fabric out of the way with tape. 
the old mold didn't facilitate resin going through but instead going across. New mold I think will be better in that regard and with probably a weaker vacuum pressure using a hand pump next time.  Didn't even look at the cure time and thought if I saw it cover all the peel ply and breather mesh Id shut off the vacuum and wait till tomorrow. Wrong. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/8/d8408d7cdbbc55cf46825e50b97ca7d4db3a9f84.jpg" width="666" height="500">
And this clay lip failed too. Amazing amount of time failing.  Tomorrow I'll try using wet sand with the board submerged in it with a plastic sheet glued on.  I don't know how people make patterns for the mold but I'm sure there's a better way

I remember when I was trying this for the first time.  It was a big fail, the expensive fail. I never did it again for 2 years after failing 3-4 times and started wrapping carbon vinyl film for car parts instead.

Again. there is a learning curve on bagging, look for the leak, learn how to find it and do the Vacuum test and leave it sealed for 1-2 hours,no rush, the infusion can wait.

For the mold, I am using Tooling Gel Coat for the first layer which is an abrasion resistant gel coat for making molds where gloss retention,hardness, and minimum distortion are needed.

Got the new pot/trap and pump. It's a beast. (It's an electric motor expression these days).  The gauge isn't accurate luckily as it only showed 28inches mercury.  I already had a history with best value vac business false advertising with the last pump (they did send me an extra that I put in series and hit 29and a bit) .  So I do the water boiling test hoping the gauge is wrong the new pump boils my cold tap water!  Hard boil.  forget what altitude I'm at but its low. 29 and at least .5. Better than before. 

I made a fourth mold after failing three times.  The last mold fail was with the plastic sheet glued to the deck it bubbled and lost the shape. It's probably doable that way but I glued to the grip taped top.  Landyahtz grip tape is super hard to get off. 
In retrospect taking the grip off and gluing the plastic sheet on is ideal I think in that the transition from board to side is a small angle, continuous plane, and catches the shape. I couldn't get the landyachts tape
Off. Definitely the way to do it. 

  I made another mold a different way after that fail. Easy.  (I'm always trying to catch just the top of the board for starters) waxed top and sides then pva release the top then gel coat, then the thinnest woven glass on top when it's a bit tacky and push it nicely to get all the air out, do just the deck, when dry pin down the glass fabric sides (better straight out) and get it kinda smooth and then wet it out, layers later.   Open mold.  Flip. And final gel coat painting on the inside sides after sanding off the overhang
That's what I did. I'm sure there's a better way but with finesse wetting out the hanging glass sides, going light, maybe no sanding later of an overhang and this is easy

failure again.  with 3 layers of carbon on the top and bottom the resin again had trouble getting to the bottom layers.  i released the vacuum hoping it would fall through to the bottom but nope.  also forgot to perforate the foam and that was likely a big cause.   next time I'll wet out all the fabric first to make sure everything is covered.  expensive.

I managed to get a good seal at first this time and no leaks. It started leaking a bit at the resin intake later but the bubbles just floated along the top. Couldn't tell if the bottom was getting resin or not and it was not.  
So no resin on the bottom (slight bubbles were coming up and it was from there). And the top has so much resin the breather and peel ply and spiral tubing are stuck. A bit better than last time at least.  No leaking mold.  

Next time. Next time.  I'll get that other core you mention.

In the moment I couldn't tell what was happening as the vacuum in the mold was decreasing when cut it off and it seemed maybe I had a leak so I just fed more resin and cut the pump off.  In retro I should've made sure the foam was perforated!! And then it likely would've worked.

Hummie, I think you might be interested in a molding process for your next deck.  

Eglide aluminium deck was sent to me to be rebuilt because it's heavy.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/f/4f4ae473777b763dae950901c748b3b4ae3fa4cc.jpg" width="690" height="388">

did you have to insulate the aluminum from the carbon to avoid any galvanic corrosion or just an easy coat of something?  And you did a vacuum infusion to get the carbon on?  Or wait it looks like it's a negative mold for a whole board.  Is it a foam core?

I've got a board I'll show you in a week!

I used a form board from a dollar store and hot glued the pieces along with the edge of the deck as barriers, but I noticed  PVA wouldn't work on paper, it got stuck on the mold surface when I tried separating them, but it just was a paper, so I sanded it off.

After applying PVA, the gel coat was brushed on then, laid up a couple of 
Chop Strand Mats to enforce the mold.

I used Lantor Soric SF Infusion Core 4mm and four layers of Carbon Fiber Fabrics Plain 600g, with this combimation, It gets an adequate amount of flex that I like.

@MasterCho Did you ever tryed to make a board, by putting layers and resing by hand without an vacuum bag? 
I am curios about that. 
Because it seems to me vacuum infusion it is a quite difficult process and I dont have the money for a few errors. 
So I am wondering, if it is possible to create a thin board (with curvature) from marple layers (in a traditional way pressed). 
and afterwards you applay layer upon layer of fiberglass and coarbon fiber.  Just by hand without vacuum bag. Like doing a wraping arround a board or enclosure. but with more layers ;) 
Will it work ?  Can I achieve a board without flex like that?

 I always use the vacuum bagging process but it can be achieved without it by pressing the layers with some weights on the top after resin applied.


Also, I recommend using some core materials to save the weight when you make a carbonfiber board.

the honey comb stuff looks great for core material. 
I will try this and and give back some feedback.

I've been looking at various options for epoxy, and would like your input on the  brands you've had the best results with. I know that you use West system 105, have you used others for infusion?

I am sure you can.  I heard it bonds to Aluminum well, but anodized aluminum will have a bonding problem.

But cans are usually so easy to tear apart when a simple hole is made.  I don't get it.
They are super thin though

the epoxy isn't for strength but protect the aluminum from interacting and reacting with the air or what's inside the can.  aluminum would react with things and it oxidizes just in the air pretty quickly going from shinny to dull grey, and then it will have a thin oxidized coating, similar to rust but in this case it's more protective and pretty much stops the oxidization process from going further, but I was stunned that we're all really drinking from epoxy cups.  I guess the epoxy isn't being eaten at by even strong acids such as coke or orange juice or whatever, I would've thought we would be.

@MasterCho i feel ive been down every path part way, having just spent like 200 bucks on materials for a vacuum former.  All the parts for it are here and almost screwed the oven/former together but now...what advice do you have on just doing a simple fiberglass enclosure by  just cover all my batteries and (dummy) electronics with thin plastic, add a perimeter barrier out of wax or something, and lay on wetted glass and call it done.  no cutting or sanding.   drill right through  glass and board at one time after it cures and set the screws and then peel it off and paint some soft rubber on it's inside.  could bolster the drill spots and where the esc is

 maybe I could lay some saran wrap on top while it cures for a nicer finish. or do some type of matte finish.

@Hummie

 Vacuum forming seems easiest but I haven't done it so I can't say.

If 23 inches X 8 inches x 33mm works for you, I can send you one.

thanks but it doesn't.  I'm at 25" x 5.5 and like 10mm.   but no vacuum forming interest and will do the super simple glass on top of saran wrap, on top of all my stuff with some periphery wall, ...drill it, peel it off, paint it with rubber inside, then bolt it down and done.   this method is so simple bound to get to the end.

Hi - 

EDIT:  I see that the Uline stuff is not able to be vacuum sealed, so I'm still researching lower cost vacuum tube film and the differences in mil / gauge rating.

Question - Does thicker mil vacuum material make a difference in the carbon fiber infusion process?

First - thanks to all, especially MasterCho for the detailed instructions / information on carbon infusion.  The pics in this thread were very useful in my second attempt at a proper infusion. First attempt was a complete failure and was before I saw this thread where I used the wrong resin and had a bad seal, so ended up switching to a wet layup and a lot of fairing. I turned this first attempt into a mold, which took a lot of hours.  Regardless I have a decent mold now. 

The second attempt got to the vacuum step, where I failed once again because of a bad seal, then ran out of vacuum material.  I have a plan to make sure the seal will not fail on the 3rd attempt.  Since I'm looking at infusing quite a few, I ran across this Uline product which comes in a continuous roll of 500' or 1000' and has mil ratings at 2,3,4, & 6. $113 for 20" x 500' of 6 mil looks a lot  better than the official film I bought off Amazon.

20" x 500' at 6 mils for $128

https://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-11125/Poly-Tubing/6-Mil-Heavy-Duty-Poly-Tubing-Roll-20-x-500?pricode=WB0356&amp;gadtype=pla&amp;id=S-11125&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_NHAu4DD4QIVi2SGCh357Q7PEAkYAiABEgK9SvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds

They make 2 mil to 6 mil.  My original film was only 2 mil and 27" wide tube but many times the cost. Will 6 mil make any difference in the vacuum infusion process?  One would think it would be better overall for flat pieces since it has a smaller chance of getting punctured. Should I go with 2 mil? Any reason why this Uline stuff won't work exactly like the proper vacuum film?

27" x 30', 2 mil for $39.95:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GJSYYRT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1

Thanks for any input.

I use either some very thin 0.6 meter/yard wide PE/PP tube which is used for protecting clothing, or I go for the ultra-cheap PE sheeting they use in greenhouse base-layering :wink:  
  
Tho I once tried and tested latex sheet on making very curved and small projects (imagine bawls, or motorsport covers) and it worked FLAWLESSLY tho I didn't test it much further. The latex molecule is similar to epoxy so it doesn't work with that, but after (successfully) trying out liquid wax on the latex sheet, it worked great with vinylester/polyester. and stuck reasonable to the butyl tape (cheap roofer's one)  
  
I don't have any pics anymore but it was Great (and PITA) to infuse this Seadoo motor cover like that in the pic in one piece, even the side-view mirrors' tunnels got nicely cornered (altho the latex sheeting popped first try when testing stretching limits) and the surface on the inside was nice smooth, tho it still wanted some pushing into the corners and adjustment here and there  
![image|598x406](upload://5E7TTZyaz5tUlm1PcHS9BydtKqW.jpeg)   
You could also use double vacuum bag: so that when you have everything infused, the vacuum pressure is still applied everywhere, tho I don't think weight-saving a 100 grams is cruical in an esk8 ;)  
  
I also specially ordered this 'special' and expensive marketed 'flexible' infusion sheeting but it only streched like 150% even after (VERY) careful heating of the sheet, kinda tossed it aside and have never used again..
