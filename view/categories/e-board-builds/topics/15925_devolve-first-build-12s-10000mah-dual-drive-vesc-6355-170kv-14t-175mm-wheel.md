Nice build. I like the enclosures, where did you get them?

Nice build. Just need some black bushings to make it completely disappear. Lol. What tires are those?

It says "printed" in the first message, so I assume they are done with a 3D printer. But it looks like CF as well.

I'm looking at doing exactly the same type of board essentially for commuting on roads and paths, so i have a few questions:
I assume you have 4 x 6S Lipos?
What sort of performances do you get in this configuration (speed, range, torque)?
Is your deck completely flat?

Thanks
```

Thanks Guys,

Yeah the battery enclosures are 3d printed with some carbon fiber covers. It took a LONG time to print them but I'm happy with how they came out.

The tires are from the [Gt Conversion Kit](https://evolveskateboardsusa.com/collections/gt-bamboo-parts/products/gt-series-all-terrain-conversion-kit?variant=32784427524) I went with this because it came with the wheel, tyre, bearings, gear and belt. So it was perfect for what I wanted.

I'm running Dual 6s 10000mah in series. I have only just finished the build and ripped around my complex so I have yet to establish the numbers I will post them as soon as the snow / ice in my area clears up. 

The deck has a solid curve to it so I had to take that into consideration when printing the enclosures.

@Sarky1 great idea to use their wheel kit as a starting point! I just realized that their rear truck already has a welded bracket on it for the motor mount, so making the CF piece made a lot of sense, nice work!

Could it be a printed piece with CF vinyl ontop of it?

I think that's what he said. I would say probably CF skinning, but Josh can confirm.

Thanks,
No wheel bite no, I did have the board touch the can of the motor while testing hence the little mark in it but that was easily adjusted.

With the flex that kind of board usually has are you worried the enclosures will not hold to the bending?

The deck is maple and fiberglass, quite ridgid but some flex. I printed the enclosures out of a semiflexible material for flex and sound. They won't break I'm sure of that. There is a chance that they will start to detach from the deck but time will tell there.

Isn't it nice having a CNC?! I don't know what I did before making mine. So many more possibilities open up so fast once you have one. Love your mounts!

No one told me doing 32kms an hr on a plank of wood would feel so fast. I have plenty of throttle left at this speed but I need up grade my safety gear :D 

Absolutely loving this board!!!

How thick are your CF motor mount?
Is it the Evolve trucks as well? They do not seem to be included in the conversion kit, and it does not like they are selling them separately either.

My mount is 6mm CF. If your interested in the design for mounting let me know.

As for the trucks, they are not part of the conversion kit you have to purchase them separately.

This build is extremely clean man. Love the 3d printed enclosures. What printer do you have?

Do your mounts have more adjustment room than the standard evolve mounts? I cant get my motors back far enough to get the belts tight on my standard evolve mount.

I have a Makerfarm 10" I3V - Spent some time tuning to get this quality.

I'm not sure how much adjustment the standard evolve ones have as I didn't have access to them I simply designed my own. My mount goes from the pulley touching the sprocket all the way out to about 10mm that is ample to get the belt tight you probably can't use all of the adjustment. I don't have their street kit to test the fit with that.

Board looks solid! I'm planning on using a 12s setup for a board too. Having trouble finding an ESC though. Which one are you using for this build. And how many amps is it rated for?
