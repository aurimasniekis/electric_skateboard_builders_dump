Bestech 12s BMS charge only
Flipsky antispark switch
Abec 107 wheels
Eboosted @Eboosted enclosures 
janux @marcmt88 motor mounts
Evolve front trucks
Tb rear trucks
Boosted board V2 deck
Enertion Nano-X Remote

Here is a breakdown of the build with links/costs and parts:

Here is a build list.  It’s not updated yet with final parts but will give you a good idea on total costs.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z4dLi97stLjkRf0uWsTGX_kPNolMg3OTI4yjEeg0XZU

They are the 50 buck motors, and they are running pretty good

Very nice build! Looks so clean 

Just one thing, you probably fixed it when closing the enclosure but please make sure that the phase wire connectors dont get pulled out/the golden part exposed like on the picture. I get a lot of repairs because of this, when the phase wires short it can damage the VESC beyond repairability.

Smooths out (induction loaded) spikes from the battery -> esc...

thanks Cobber, ya, read on the boards that for every foot of distance you have between the battery and the esc, you should add caps to reduce the spikes.   If you don't a 12s would/could burn out your esc overtime

I love this build -- and I ***love*** the idea of DKP in front and RKP in rear --

But I'd remove the extra capacitors.  Sure, it's better for the ESC and the battery and the performance.  But it's *terrible* for the antispark-switch / loopkey and the extra parts is just more things that can break / short-out from vibrations, for minimal performance gain.

You can epoxy them back in and use better epoxy so it won't happen again and it would be worth it if you liked their performers before. However, in not sure jb weld has a high enough heat resistance. 

Edit: I have no idea what to use.

I personally would toss them out and buy some new ones.  The time and money it takes to fix it (if it fixes it) could be spent riding.  Just my 2 cents worth. 

 It would be nice if you could buy the bells separately.  I buy separate bells all the time for my racing drones but I haven't seen any of these sellers sell just the bells.

A few thoughts.

- the USA sellers on ebay for that motor have like 1yr/2yr/3yr warranty. hmm...

- Loctite 326 is glue for magnet to bell. Use primer 7649. $$$$! High temperature retaining compound might work too.

- How much do you want for those bad motors? :slight_smile:

I already tried to glue them back with jb weld since it can stand up to 316c and a constant temp of 260c

☹️

Had I known I would have bought the Loctite

Oh ya for anyone trying to do this in the future, remember to alternate poles on each magnet

Haven't done it yet be honest.  Put all my latest efforts into my evo so been loving that thing.  Got the trucks here just haven't had the time to play with them.  Definitely not putting one on the evo though.  That would be suicidal I reckon.  It will probably go on the 10s4p build with a carbon drop through and either direct drives or high amp hubs.  The shopping trolley.  Nice and light and carvy.
