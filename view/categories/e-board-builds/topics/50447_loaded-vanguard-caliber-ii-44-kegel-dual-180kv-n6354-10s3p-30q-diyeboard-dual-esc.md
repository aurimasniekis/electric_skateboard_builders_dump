Hi there,
After reading a lot of builds, and having owned a Backfire V2 for a few months, I decided to go the DIY route, so here goes another Loaded Vanguard build :slight_smile: Also, did not order the electronics yet as I can't really make up my mind... 

**-- Longboard --**
**Deck:** Loaded Vanguard Flex 3
**Trucks:** Caliber II 44º
**Bushings:** Orangatang - Orange nipples
**Bearings:** Bones Reds Bearings
**Wheels:** Orangatang Kegel 80mm - Orange
**Lights:** Shredlights

**-- Electronics --**
**ESC:** Dual FOCBOX
**Motors:** Dual 180KV N6354
**Battery:** 10S4P diy by me using 30Q. Bestech 80A BMS 10S
**Motor mounts:** 2x Single Bolt on from [diyelectricskateboard](collections/electric-skateboard-motor-mounts/products/single-bolt-on-motor-mount-set-only-black?aff=2)
**Drive Pulley:** 2x 33T evolve Kegel Pulley 15MM
**Motor Pulley:** 2x 16T 15MM from [diyelectricskateboard](collections/motor-pulleys/products/16t-htd5-15mm-motor-pulley)

**Enclosures:** Would like to 3D print but don't where to do it affordably in europe yet

**-- Images --**

![IMG_0880|666x500](upload://kiqR2rLbZsKsiCDfmgsobtE7ed8.jpg)

**-- Questions --**
**1)** I am using 1.25" Loaded Flathead hardware. I am supposed to tighten the screws until they enter the board or should I be using shims?
![IMG_0881|668x500](upload://cJ1gU39DrttOxYGPRaTxYCIgYz2.jpg)

**2)** What type of drive pulley can I use to keep the green rims visible on the outside like boosted has?

**3)** Should I go the full diy route and build a 10S4P 30Q pack? What are the downsides of using the premade 10S3P listed above?

**4)** What advantages would I have in buying 2xFOCBOX/VESC's instead of the dual ESC listed above? Is the difference really worth it for my build?

**5)** What advantages would I have in using [Torque Boards 6355/190KV ](products/electric-skateboard-motor-6355-190kv) motors instead of the listed above?

Thanks in advance ;)
Joao

[/quote]

When you say "not very good" do you mean it can fry or malfunction while using or that it will not be as smooth accelerating, breaking and managing the motors? I need to justify spending 450$ on 2 VESC + remote + enclosure + power on instead of 100$ for this inferior ESC.

Thanks. I found them here [evolveskateboards.de](http://evolveskateboards.de/index.php/en/shop-buy-online/accessories-and-spare-parts/evolve-drive-gear-3-kegel-detail) but it says it is only for evolve customers... Do you know where I can find them? Also, are they as good as the ones that use screws?

come on guys. Just saying "it isn't very good" isn't helpful at all. Either feed him with information or point him in direction to find information, or don't say anything at all. This is what forums are for, not just stating in supported claims. 

To answer your question- 

Yes VESC's are far superior then the Chinese dual ESC'S. Use the search function, there is plenty of information on both and the differences between the 2. Off the top of my head I know that the Chinese ESC is limited to 30 amps or something, which will be a total bottleneck to your build. VESC's, depending on what you get, can do 50-60 amps continuous/150ish burst.

Really cool colour choices, I dig it! Got any plans for the bottom of the deck? I feel like you should paint it matte black.

And cover everything in some sort of 'epoxy' and make everything as water proof as you can so when the white is longer white you can just give it a wash ; )

Hey Joao
You want to use a countersink drill bit to get the screws flush on the board.  something like these:

```

You could use these from loaded instead of countersunk ones:

## \#20 Posted by: Toughook Posted at: 2018-06-15T14:07:48.489Z Reads: 276

```
I've always found that the deck wood compresses when the screws are tighened up properly. Using a countersink drill is a little overkill and expensive unless you own a set already. Just take care that the screwdriver head fits the screws properly and you exert enough pressure onto the screw head whilst tighening the nuts underneath, or you'll risk damaging the screwhead X and make life difficult for yourself when removing them.

I now have all the parts here. Let the fun begin :slight_smile:
Will build the Spot Welder this week and start on the 10S4P battery. Do you think I can achieve a layout like this? Not really sure on how to connect the 2 horizontal pairs...

![IMG_1281|666x500](upload://bzNAHbxPHLdXjRrbLbTTk8toMju.jpg)

To be able to fit the on/off and charge plug on the middle and the BMS on top:

Hi there, this build is looking good to me (I’m new) and I’d love to see it once the whole set up is compete. Are you planning on charging it with like a laptop charger like the boosted board?
As I’ve read using a bms can make that possible

You don't need a bms to charge it like Boostedboards :grinning: . You just need a dc male and female plug and a charger with customisable end of charge voltage.

[quote="vortek, post:23, topic:50447"]
Do you think I can achieve a layout like this?
[/quote]

You can but its not really a good solution here. The best would be to change your bms to charging bms only, and it would fit on the far left of the enclosure very nicely since it would be much smaller. I'm no expert here but stacking bms on the cells is calling for troubles imo.

**Update #4 - Battery progress**

Glued the batteries in pairs
![IMG_1326|666x500](upload://s0i5mulg7zrGOK9oDjtXN7ivaQY.jpg)

Glued each 2 pairs and prepared the layout
![IMG_1328|666x500](upload://fznVaX5cwPIXNnzsugTdGGqYyur.jpg)

Batteries on the case to test fit
![IMG_1342|666x500](upload://xEcAf2Q0PWQJvohNJhGPkh5eF0M.jpg)

And the probable BMS placement
![IMG_1332|666x500](upload://2uQKVVppP8H3YjTAPLnK9I5Gujd.jpg)

Will start spot welding soon. Are you guys the same opinion as @rok about the BMS? Thanks

No, you don’t need a bms but the bms is highly recommended as it keeps the battery cells in balance and protects them from over discharge. If you want a cheaper bms solution a charge only bms works too, which can be read about more on the forum

1) About the focboxes, they have smaller connector than the motors. Which should I change? And I think I will have to shorten the wires to fit neatly inside the ESC case.
![IMG_1405|666x500](upload://dPw922FVszjcPEm9WrWAJbZe1iU.jpg)

2) Do these FOCBOX's look ok or should I hot glue anything?
![IMG_1407|666x500](upload://cieu3AIZrdSkRwNGFMQWevdwr2V.jpg)

3) Do i fix the FOCBOX's to the board or to the case? I am thinking of glueing this foam inside, and then glue an acrylic sheet to it, and then fix (glue, screw?) the FOCBOX's to the sheet.

It's a spot welder built based on a youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPuKu5J-_64)

I use an old PC power source case, an old microwave transformer and a timer relay for the 0.2s-0.3s pulses.
