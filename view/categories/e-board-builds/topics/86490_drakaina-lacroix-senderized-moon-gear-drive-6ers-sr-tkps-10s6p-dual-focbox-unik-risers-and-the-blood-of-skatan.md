Individually the components used in the build are for the most part common.  With @Sender's skin work and @moon's gear drive combined with SUrf Rodz TKP's, Psychotiller 6 Shooters, massive 10s6p battery pack all on a LaCroix deck it's a new level of awesome. 

A little history, in a short time...

1.  I like Dragons, always have.  If I was a Dragon I would definitely burn cities and have a massive gold horde, so yeah.
2.  The beginning of this design process was to build something to take to Colorado that would be fast, long range, comfortable and epic.  I think that has happened, in epic fashion.

This build is the culmination of 6 months of planning, the help of many people including @Sender and @moon and lots of testing.  

@Sender did all of the finish work on a LaCroix second (there was a couple little defects in the CF, nothing structural).  In fact, on his new build he wanted a 12s6p so I just traded him cells for a complete battery, I came out well on that trade :slight_smile:. @Sender had so much to do with this build, its as much his as it is mine.  You rock brother and I appreciate you. 

I have been working with @moon for months on this gear drive system, it's everything I wanted in a gear driven drivetrain, he did an excellent job.   The covers are my own design, which is still preliminary and will be available to everyone for free as soon as I finalize the model.  I have a couple of things I want to change, like the depth can be slightly less that its current form, I want to add internal filets to control the grease flow on turn and I am adding a bumper option to the motor side of the cover for rear mount motors.

Most people are using adjustable mounts to make Surf Rodz trucks fit MTB decks, I had the Unik Risers from another build that I wasn't happy with so I used them instead of spending more money.  I am so happy with them, solid as hell.

I am currently using an old Benchwheel remote I had, waiting on a used Hoyt Puck from another person on the esk8 scene, should have it this weekend.

I will update the build sheet and data calculations as the config and or hardware changes, but I don't see anything significant coming up.

![Drakaina%202%20-%20030719|690x449](upload://7VYyV4Bb2YBCx2ccOz0wZHLpV1w.jpeg) 

![Drakaina%203%20-%20030719|690x490](upload://jJMP7hfgLeN1beDdOiHaVVJ1xaS.jpeg) 

The ride experience is incredible.  It's so comfortable and I'm really locked in.  Its fast and extremely curvy (cones street side front and back).  Glass Frit is so much better than grip tape, I don't even know how to describe it, you just need to experience it.  I rode for about 10 miles last night and barely touched the battery, I figured the efficiency at 80% since I'm running pneumatics but I think it's going to be closer to 90%.

Smaug would be proud...or jealous...or aroused. :dragon:

It looks like you could mount the motors way higher for more clearance, why not? Also, although I hate to be that guy, I think your tire treads are pointed backwards :stuck_out_tongue:

Overall super unique looking build! You gotta share some videos of you riding this beast! :smiley:

[/quote]

No reason too, there's as much clearance as there is ever gonna be  tlThe majority of the motor plate is round, so it would just be a pivot. Plus it looks cool. ðŸ˜ƒ

Hey @Sender found him, you owe me 5 bucks ðŸ˜ƒ. 

@rusins We had a discussion about the treads on 6 ers and how someone always sees if they are pointed incorrectly, so it's just a thing I do now ðŸ˜‹. Plus I don't ride in the rain.

Awesome build Mike! Me too I like to see those huge motors more upwards than horizontal. Mount covers will be standard on @moon's mounts which are becoming Esk8 quality build among us.

I may actually change the name, I just need to figure out if I like yours (Drogo) or (@rojitor) Dracarys :slight_smile:

Maybe a poll is call for. 

I'm going to be switching out the motor plates/cover for aluminum before long.  I may increase the angle then but I don't think it will do any good as the cover section for the wheel gear is circular, and is the pivot point of the axle, so all that would increase is the motor height which is really high now.

...je..je.. Both are the same name. Drogon is the name queen Daenerys gave his main dragon. But when she speaks the Valerian language, the same name is spoken: Drakarys. Is all the Game of Thrones universe. :yum:

Yes, that too. Seems when she rides Drogon (or Drakarys) she uses Valyrian as the command language.

No, they could move out a bit, but these motor mounts (@psychotiller RIPBA) are made so that one of grub screws slots into the grub screw slot on the hanger. It essentially makes it bullet proof and perfectly aligned.  I could maybe get a couple of millimeters but I am not sure its worth it.

Aren't all words in the english lexicon greek words to some degree?  There are different pronunciations even with the same country for some words.  

I just don't see the world as strictly black and white, I realize there are rules to language but they are broken more than they are followed and the result is the accepted usage so I guess we just have to disagree on this one, plus I believe the chinese would disagree with you :).
