Today I have a raptor 2 but are looking for more range and higher top speed. 
I have bought 72 Samsung 30q batteries and a evo board and will soon order eboosted enclosure for evo DS. What more do I need to build the battery pack? Please link if u have to a store that ship to eu. Any guide someone can link how to make a battery pack?
How mutch A should the bms have? Is 100A ok or do i need more ? Please link if you know a good. 
The motors will be the new hummie hubs coming or the torqueboards direct drive. I will soon order 2 unity or 4 focboxes to. 
Best regards
