Didn't you sell all your parts a couple months ago? :stuck_out_tongue:

 You're geared for like 45mph. If you don't want to go that fast or don't want to blow your ESC, you should probably drop down to a lower voltage and gearing.

I mean they'll both probably work to an extent, but you're sacrificing torque for it and putting your ESC at risk.

Use this calculator to find out how many teeth are in mesh. http://www.bbman.com/belt-length-calculator/

Too few teeth and you're susceptible to skipping.

Even with a more generous center distance it's still only 5 teeth in mesh

You can get away with less teeth in mesh if you run a wider belt, so maybe go with 12mm or 15mm
```

I can't say for sure, haven't seen it done, maybe someone else can share their experience with it :) 

My guess is that it'll blow the ESC and/or motor after extended periods of high speed, and will lack in torque. You always want to design your setup so the top speed is a comfortable speed for you. So unless you want 40mph+ to be your speed, I'd recommend 6-8s battery.

I'm a fan of higher voltages, so the other option is to get a different motor, maybe 170-200kv.

Sure if you want to go SK3. But other merchants have options as well. Chaka has 170kv and 200kv motors. TB has 230kv. Enertion has 190kv.

That's geared for 31mph which could work. Depends how much you want to gamble trying. I have no experience with @oriol360 ESC and don't know what it can take.

250kv FTW! 
Lol JK, I prefer 250 for the higher top speeds, if i need more torque i just add another motor :sweat_smile:
I think all your parts will work just fine but you will have a crazy fast board so your throttle controller with the gt2b will have to be very refined in such a huge range of speed.
One reason I use my remote is I can switch the thumb control between 100% throttle or 50% throttle at full range. So for a 12S build that can go 40mph it helps when you cut the remote to 50% and now you can accelerate and the board will cap out around 20mph.

0 drops on remote. it's the same 2.4ghz so it's super reliable!

I ship within a few days of order placement.
Since it's a battery it needs to go through ground. 
I think it take about 5 days to get delivered.
