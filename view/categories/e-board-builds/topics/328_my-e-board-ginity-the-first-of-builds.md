This is my first time building a E-board, I'm still in the very early stages of trying to make heads and tails of what i actually need for this build, and that is where (hopefully) you guys swoop in with the expert know-how! I'm currently thinking that my build will be Dual Rear Mounted motors on a longboard. The board is supposed to be able carry me (70kg) to and from uni on a single charge, a round trip of about 18 km or 11.2 miles to those who are mectricly impaired ;) I'm very open for suggestions!

Hi Krudte, Welcome!

What you have listed sounds easily achievable.

There are a few things that you need to decide/know.

**A. Budget, how much are you willing to spend. DIY E-boards can be cheap or they can be pricey... you get what you pay for. It also depends on how much of the constructing you want to do. You can buy all the parts basically ready to go, or you can try building stuff yourself. The later will cost less but (depending on your craftsmanship) potentially look like a frankenstein-style board. VS buying "pre-made" kits and plugging it all together. the later will cost more.**

Some reading on the topic: 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/are-diy-electric-skateboards-cheaper-the-false-economy/165


**B. Do you have long steep hills to climb? If so maybe go Dual drive. If it's mostly flats you could save some coin and get single drive.**

Some reading on the topic: 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/are-dual-motors-actually-worth-the-extra-cost/21/2


**C. Choosing a deck, what type is good?**

Some reading on the topic:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/what-deck-is-best-for-building-your-own-electric-skateboard/30


There are currently 3 well know suppliers of custom made eboard parts. You could build a complete eboard parts just from shopping with these suppliers.
1. http://www.enertionboards.com/
2. 
3. http://www.aliendrivesystems.com/

There is also a new player recently on the scene who is making some cool decks that integrate all the components into the deck itself, they don't do motor mounts.
http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/

If you want to adapt hobby grade components into your build check out:
http://www.hobbyking.com/


My only other suggestion is do lots of reading to get a good foundation of knowledge so you can make an educated decision.

Thank you so much for this! @onloop  it's a great start! 

A. My initial "budget" is... well, I'd like to do this build, if possible for 1000$ or so but if i get really in to it i don't really mind spending more, but part of why I'm doing this is to familiarise myself with tool, for prototyping, CNC, machining and metal work, so the dream would be to make the truck, motor mount, motor pulley etc. myself.

B. The ride is not that steep as i live in Denmark (the flattest country ever) but it is more or less a slight constant incline, with some small semi steep hills.

I have lots of reading to do, I will return once I'm a little smarter! thanks again for a great starting point!

Any particular reason you settled on Atlas trucks? If you went with 180mm Caliber IIs you could still make your own mounts but you would also be compatible with all of the ones currently being made and sold. Is the performance of the Atlas trucks good enough to justify that kind of lock-in?

The more you know... The only the reason i looked at the Atlas was the Square'ish arms, for a easier mounting. I know squat about skateboards so it was a guess made solely on appearances. whould you mind explaining why the atlas is not compatible with other mounts? Also honestly i didn't know about the 180mm Caliber IIs :)

I can totally see why you chose them. They have a non-round profile ideal for clamping something to. Caliber IIs also have a D shaped profile that accomplishes the same thing, but most of the community has settled on supoprting Caliber IIs for mounts, although some support Paris trucks which are round in profile.

I'm not really sure but I think the max that battery can put out is 200amp but you don't always have to pull that much. 20000mah should get you what you want. Let the other guys chime in with their opinions.

## \#17 Posted by: cmatson Posted at: 2015-10-20T20:49:16.001Z Reads: 130

yep, you'd have two groups of 3s in parallel (10,000mah). Those tow groups in series (adding the voltage) will give you 6s equivalent voltages. 

if you want that kind of compacity, you can always just go with two 10,000mah 3s batteries, rather than four 5,000mah ones. This would cut down on all that wiring, and you'd only have to charge two batteries instead of four!

also, the 200 amp thing won't hurt your esc. In the rc world, I used to run a battery with over 100c's on a 50amp 10th scale esc.. there are plenty of people (who race rc cars) who will have lipos with a burst rating of over 250c, and a constant of 200ish. it's totally fine. 

Milage will vary based on the following (so if you list them out, we can give you a pretty good idea of how far you will go per charge)
weight
gearing
dual motor or single motor
hills
total mah

Side note: is your goal 16-20km, or 16-20 miles? just wondering because us 'mericans use our stupid units that are based on 10's, 12's, 3's, and 5280's all at the same time...

Super informative THANKS! :smile:
 
Milage wise I need a min. of 16 miles on a single charge.
Weight: 80kg (176 lb.)
Gearing: very open to suggestions, I was loking around, and it seems like 16/36 is the way to go? (PURE guesswork)
Single motor: R-SPEC Enertion 190kv
Hills: few and not very steep
Total mAh: well that's what I'm trying to find out.....

The gearing can be determined only when you know the other variables. Wheel diameter, motor kv, voltage. Desired top speed.

I wrote a detailed article about it:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/beginners-guide-to-building-your-own-electric-skateboard-drivetrain/53


I suggest going higher voltage. But then you will need a VESC. Which I highly recommend.

## \#20 Posted by: cmatson Posted at: 2015-10-21T01:00:48.440Z Reads: 133

```
ya, for a 175 pound guy on a single motor, I'd either go higher voltage, or drop your gearing... the thread @onloop  linked is really helpful, so definitely look at that first (if you haven't already).

Right now on my board, I am running a 10s with one enertion r-spec and 13/36 gearing; the main difference is I only weight around 140 pounds (I'm 16 year old kid so..)

Also, 190kv  on 6s is going to be very slow... I once ran mine on 15/36 gearing (on 6s) and I couldn't hit above 16 miles per hour. also, the motor was pretty hot after just a small ride, as the lower voltages (and higher gearing...) will lead to a higher amp draw by the motor, which means hotter temps.

if you are dead set on going for 6s, I would (personally) look for a higher kv motor to then gear down. It is always better to gear down a fast motor than gear up a slower but more powerful one. I feel like with your current 190kv setup idea, you will either be stuck with moping around at 12-15 miles per hour, or gearing it faster and burning out your motor...

The easiest thing though would be to get a VESC and go higher voltage. With higher voltage you wouldn't need as many milli amp hours (mah) because your motor is drawing less amps, and taking advantage of higher voltages instead.

Hope all this helps, and doesn't make your brain explode... lol good luck!

You would be fine with 10c. You shouldn't notice a big difference since we actually don't pull anywhere near 200 amps.

Calculate the Watt Hours divide by 10wh and * .61 miles. That will get you a range which is usually a lot less then what you can get.

Go for 230-260KV for a 6S setup, Gear up as needed as cmatson mentioned.

This is not a 20Ah 6S setup. This wiring diagram will give you the equivalent of a 10Ah 6S pack (that's what i run on my beater board), which is somewhere around 220 Wh as Volts x Amp Hours will give you Watt Hours. 

You have 2 3S 5Ah packs in series, that gives you 6S (22.2 volts nominal) at 5Ah. Then you take those two sides and combine them in parallel to get 6S @ 10Ah. In series, voltage doubles. In parrallel, Amp hours double. 

The good news is that you can combine the balance charge leads and use the mains output as discharge and charge with a standard 6S charger. That means you can make a charge cable and seal your box in and not have to deal with the battery wiring when charging.

You just answered the question i was about to ask, thanks! (I was wondering whether or not I would be able to charge on a single port, if i merged the balance ports).
From the other comments i gathered I'd need higher voltage so I made some calculations, and i think I'm going  to go with 2x 4s 8000mAh 30C instead. This would give me an approximate range of 1+hour at 17+mph, which would satisfy my range need :)

That sounds about right as long as you're under.. say.. 160 pounds or so. I'm 155 and I get about an hour out of my 10Ah 6S when keeping it around 15 on average and only bursting up to 25+ when i see a cyclist that needs to be annoyed. 8S should land you right where you expect it to.

not hating on enertion, but don't buy the trucks, wheels, or lipo charger from them.

you can get the real caliber trucks (which is even better, and come in some sick colors... like seriously, just look'em up) for less than enertion's knockoff versions if you look on amazon or ebay.

the wheels are just knockoff 83mm flywheels: you can get those for around $25-30 on ebay (you can get any color too), or the real ones for about $70 on abec's website. 

You can get a lipo charger from hobbyking for under $50 that will do the same thing enertion's does too... I have one from amazon that is really solid and it was $45.. looks just like enertion's too. 

to be honest, with the money you'd save doing the things I pointed out (about $100-110), you could just switch your batter to a space cell, and forget the lipo charger and lipos all together... plus, you board would be about 100x better. 

adding 325 for a space cell
taking away 35ish saved on wheels and trucks 
taking away 210ish for a charger and batteries
take away 4.50 for a voltage alarm (built into space cell)
take away 60 for switch (built into space cell)
take away the misc xt90 plugs balancing plug because the space cell already comes with an xt60 that matches the one that comes with the VESC.

so I think your build might become 10$ more expensive, or 10$ cheaper after adding a space cell, but it would litterally be SOOO much better.. Higher voltages are always better for efficiency, motor temps, speed, and torque; especially since you are going with a single motor build. 

again, not hating on enertion stuff: Jason makes some badass mounts and electronics (hense why I am recommending the space cell as your best option) .. just get your skate stuff elsewhere.

good luck man!

First of all, thank so for taking you time to look at this!

I have looked at all the parts you described (Maybe i looked in the wrong places?) and the thing is that shipping to Denmark is insanely expensive, but with Enertion the shipping is free. The changes you suggest would actually increase the cost by more than 100$

Making the switch (Battery-wise) would cost me approximately 25$ more (definitely a lot less then I thought, I'm considering upgrading now) bringing my total over a whopping 1000$

so ya, just go enertion because of the shipping. I was looking on Ebay at the wheels and trucks I suggested, and shipping was going to be over $40 to denmark. Most of them had free US shipping, and like I said, I didn't realize you weren't in the states!

and believe me man, the battery upgrade is completely worth it: the performance difference is like night and day. You definitely won't regret it.

Hey nice that the intrest is spreading :) I'm originally from Amager but I live in Odense currently because of my Studies at SDU. As to the build, Well I didn't get far, as I'm currently getting my bachelors degree, and that consumes most of my time. I did [fiberglass a deck with some custom print][1], but the build is currently standing still.

Cool, im actually also gonna begin on SDU after summer break, Im finishing up a course I am taking in Copenhagen (only 1 week left, wohoo) and then im moving back to Odense (im in Odense now for the weekend, testing an airplane 12s esc that I had laying around, but without much luck).

I actually have a finished and reliable board with at least 500 km on it. Though I am planning to make some serious upgrading to it for moar speed!, the police here dont really mind electric longboards as long as you don't go over 25km/h on bike roads, they have bigger fish to fry I suppose. (apparently they are understaffed atm, but I really dont think they would mind either way)

Remember that you need to pay around 1/3 of the price of the enertion order in toll.

Nice meeting you and lemme know if you need any help building :smile:
