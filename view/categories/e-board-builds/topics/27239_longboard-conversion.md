You should have a look at other people's builds on the forum and see what they have used. The large 11a battery should be fine to use as long as it can supply enough amps and you don't weigh a lot. You could also use a vesc as the esc but make sure you read up about that so you don't blow it up. The motors you should look at are some sleep: motors from HobbyKing if you are going to use a belt or chain drive. As for hub motors I don't really know much about them just that they don't have a lot of torque

Are you looking to make an all terrain or street (hub) build? 

Lots of directions you can go. 

Check out this build:

Probably around 15/36 or 16/36 on your gear ratio would net you 30mph.

Print a good pulley out of nylon and it will work great!
