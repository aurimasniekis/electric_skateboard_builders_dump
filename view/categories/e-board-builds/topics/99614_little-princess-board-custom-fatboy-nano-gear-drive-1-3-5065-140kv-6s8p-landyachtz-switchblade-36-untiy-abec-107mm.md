Hey guys after Paris event my sister wanted a board like all of us have. She tried few electric ones and played around with push boards and etc and loved it so we decided to build one for her.

## Specs:

* Custom FatBoy Nano Gear drive made for 5065 with 1:3 gear ratio
* 5065 140kv motors
* 6S8P 30Q Battery pack made into two 6S4P packs so later on it could be changed into 12s4p
* Enertion Unity with Nano-X
* Landyachtz Switchblade 36"
* Custom Enclosure made by @BigBen
* Cone/Canon and Canon/Canon 84A bushings (Helped by our master @RipTideSports)
* 6S BMS for charge only

Color scheme is Black/Red I think (That’s what was decided by our princess)

Can’t say enough thanks for @BigBen for this nice custom enclosure

Motors were upgraded and bulletproofed, added keyway to the axle:

Made custom gear drive for smaller motors also made it smaller as motor is a lot smaller .

I love the look of this small BMS:

The 6S Charger expected to be smaller but looks like they only change voltage by pot or etc and that’s all:

The whole build (with temporary different enclosure double stack) looks pretty sick

This June just turned 10 year old :) That's why I asked for help from RipTide because she weights less than 45kg :D

That's great man.
Lucky kid.

Those 50xx geardrives would be rad for smaller kicktail builds. So compact.

Aside from the keyway, what else did you do to the motors to bulletproof them?
