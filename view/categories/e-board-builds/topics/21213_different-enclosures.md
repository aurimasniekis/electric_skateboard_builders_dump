I was wondering what people use for enclosures when they can't afford to get a custom molded one like the ones offered by @psychotiller Facing this problem myself I thought I would ask what the budget friendly people Macgyver'd for their personal builds

plant trays seem to work pretty well.  If you have access to a 3d printer print some end-caps, then buy a piece of sheet metal, bend the edges on a 2x4 to fit.

I dremel'd out a plastic hardware screw organizer box for a build. Used 2-ton epoxy to hold it on there. It worked well for a few hundred miles, as a proof-of-concept, but neither was up to task in the long-term.

Everything else sticky Velcro and gaffa tape...

I am going to launch a webshop soon for EU skaters. Here I will also offer some vacuum formed enclosures. I cant promise you a price atm, but I try to keep the costs low! 
Emy webshop will hopefully be up and running i a month or so.

Funny thing is, that this is perfect for up to a 10s4p with a huge bms and dual vesc and all the other fancy electronic ;)
I´ll post a picture mounted later.

Yet to trim and mount it but you get the idea. All done with a £10 heater, some MDF off cuts and a few nuts and bolts.

I built one but I can't seem to find a way to get my plastic hot enough to form with a simple heater. I made a small box, lined it with tine foil but I still couldn't get it hot enough with the heater. Also tried putting a heat gun and a hair drier through holes in the box with no luck.

Mine was a 1.6kw heater and seemed to do a good job. First attempt it didn't quite seem to get hot enough. I covered the abs with a foil lid and bingo, super saggy.

Not sure a hairdryer would increase the heat too much. A heat gun might help. I think a lid might do the trick as you lose so much heat through the top.

The way I have it set up my plastic was the lid as I figured the heat would rise and go onto the plastic. I ended up using the stove which heated it up very well but not very evenly. I wasn't able to mold it fully and had to do most of it with a heat gun and my hands.

I figured the same but I think the side not facing the heater was just not heating enough. By adding the foil it retained enough heat to make it flexible all the way through. I waited longer on the second time and it sagged at least double the depth of the enclosure and the edges were really flexible.

I saw those trays in ikea last week too.  I decided not to use it because it was too deep.    I ended up buying a plastic tray for Diaso for $1.50.

It would be great if you make a thread step by step how to do it! :wink:
what is weight of that enclosure?

I'll add a few more bits to my build thread but it really is super simple and there are a good couple of guides on youtube.

I'll need to weight the enclosure but its really not very heavy at all. The ABS loses all of its flex once it has been formed into a more ridged shape. Need to start cutting my holes for cables, charging port and antispark switch now. Just hope I dont mess it up at this stage!

I have also decided to mount a voltage display but on the top of the rear truck and form a cover for it that will be held down by the truck screws.

This looks great! I have one concern though. You are using Lipo cells which will catch fire if punctured. I think there is a small chance of that happening if a big rock hits the battery pack. Maybe a thin sheet of aluminum between the cells and rubber will do the trick? Just a thought :)

I picked up two stodja trays today at the local Ikea because I need a new enclosure and I am a cheap skate. I did not trust putting any weight on this, so I'm going to Velcro the crap out of my battery and all my electronics and stick them to the bottom of the board. I am going to try to apply a couple coats of tech bed liner as well for a little support, but it's polypropylene, which is notorious for being nigh unpaintable. 

I would love to see how you worked it out!

Wow - Holy thread revival! 

Afraid I don't - was just something I thought up. No way I wanted to cook up the ABS plastic in the home oven so I cam e up with this. I think the key is getting even heat so distance from the heater is important) and the foil lid I put over the top really helped to keep the heat in long enough. I did it for the challenge and I suppose there are probably easier and cheaper ways to achieve the same or better results! haha.
