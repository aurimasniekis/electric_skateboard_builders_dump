Ok, so I've decided to do a high end build.. and I'm been reading a lot but still have a couple questions..

I bought the evolve trucks and AT wheels/kit along with the motor mounts from https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/core-serie-support-moteur-pour-truck-evolve-supercarve-street-et-at/
and I understand I need 63mm motors for this to work.. so Id like to use some focbox's and have a 10s5p battery coming.. so from reading for my battery pack I should stay around a 200kv?? so im thinking the Sensored 6369 200kv motor is what I should get correct? or any other advice would be helpful.. thanks!

I've seen quite a few AT builds between 140-170kv. 200 seems a little on the higher side.  Most regular builds are 190kv or less.

Either will work, I’m not quite sure but turnigy 6374 motors might also fit.

The turnigy sk3 6374 motors - aren't 6374 - and aren't sensored, if those are the ones you're referring to...

Yeah I know they are actually 5986 or whatever. Sensors aren’t needed if running foc although do make it even smoother

I was referring to the maytech motors.. I herd these are the better motors on the market and also most other motors are rebranded maytechs

[/quote]

Can confirm; two real 6374 motors WILL fit on the Supercarve trucks but the Turnigy sk3 "6374" motors are not 6374 and they will not fit.  They are 5984...

Just look at the motor dimensions and if it's more then 76mm long it won't fit
