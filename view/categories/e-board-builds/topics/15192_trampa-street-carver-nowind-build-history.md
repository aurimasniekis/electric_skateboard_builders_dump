Got this Street Carver about 2 years now.

This is how it arives, with 83mm Wheels, Ultimate Trucks and thinnest Deck :

Beautiful Trucks imo :

Run it as single rear drive the first time with a SK3-6374 :

Placed the ESC and Battery on the underside like in most common streetbuilds :

Nice to ride but as always i wanted more (-; added a second drivetrain on the frontend.
Dual Diagonal Drive is not bad but compared to Dual rear as usal on the MTB´s i dont really get on with it.
Drivetrain parts are HTD5-9mm with, made from steel raw material...

Changed Motors to shorter 6364-213KV and mounted both on the rear truck, still running the 6S Quicrun ESC´s :

Used some shity hobbyfoam to cover all the mess on the underside ... cutted with a knive and hotglued

I have to say that i not used the Carver much, i´m so much into the MTB stuff and just take it out for a ride to rare ...
Thought about what i can do to have more fun with it and decidet to modify the Carver with Bindings and a Layout lime the MTB to get more ground clearence for jumps etc ...

Used another Trampa MTB Deck as a template to drill the binding holes :

countersunk from underside :

Mounted Trampa Bindings and Heelstraps :

Hell yeah (-; 

After Trampa starts selling pulleys for the Carver Wheels i decidet to go with this parts. 
So a nice upgrade to 15mm Belts, and some lost gramms compared to my heavy steel parts :

Modified my excisting mounts for the shorter gearing / axledistance, fast mod :

Looking badass with the wide aluminium pulleys imo ... :

Added for a short test some VESC´s with 10S Lipo, but i dont get on with it. I know most people love it but for me the delay in torque is a big downside. So quick change to the old 6S Hobbywings for some rainy Christmas runs (-;

 <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/b/5b6b7ca4144294a006e02c77a2dc208dbecefd0a.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Have had a lot of fun on really small area bei doing little drifts on wet surface until it gets dark (-:::
Now preparing the next upgrade :imp:

To be continiued ...

With a classic ESC the torque is immediate and strong whereas on the VESC with normal firmware; it's smoothed.

Should be adjustable by the settings. Maybe the vesc gets killed when the current ramps too quick but it would be worth a try.

By the  values in red you can adjust how fast the vesc ramps with the current. The Gain controls the step on each calculation (the higher the value the faaster it ramps). And the Max current limits the maximum aloowed value. Means the value that got calculated by the Gain is not allowed to be higher than this. So at the beginning i would suggest to double the values and play a little with it. I think you will find a setup that perfectly fits your needs. Maybe you kill the VESC but it's for science.

And to give that setup the perfect finish you could try my throttle curves.

Thanks Ced, yes its really flexy.

Was thinking about some A123 Cells inside of something like this : 
http://kabelschlepp.de/produkte/energiefuehrungen/tube-series/serie-tka/index.html
Maybe i will test one day...
Actually  i will go the classic MTB style with all electronics topmounted. Just wanna have all posibilities like jumps and grinds. So astethics will be second...

Thanks for your input. You have to know that i´m not new to the Vesc, i tryed alot settings with my Mountainboards and never was happy in the end with torque delivery. For sure i love it raw and direct and i´m used to from many RC-ESC´s. Owned 6 VESC, two burned, two sold, last two wait for a chilled cruiser build (-; Thanks again for your input, but for science i burned enough Vesc´s

Sorry! Overkill* 

It will be epic I hope. This build of yours is beautiful. 12s5p Samsung 30q cells dual sensored SK3  6374 motors. Dual vescx. 

What are your thoughts on the bindings on this board?

For me bindings are perfect, just more controll and i feel safer with !
Moved outside with the Springs to outer mounting position and screw in the adjuster more.

Changed the SK3- 6364 - 213KV to Dymond 6374-200kv
Changed 6S Quicrun to 8S MAX6

Take it for a little ride in middle of the night, dark and rainy, destroyed my Remote by a little crash... but anyways : 
The increase in performance is huge, love it :heart_eyes:

What i´m thinking about is : 
Trampa mounted the Mini Trucks on the Street Carver switched... on the Urban Carver regular.
The difference is a shorter wheelbase in switched mode... what else will change?
What you guy think?
For sure Frank can explain @trampa

The reverse  hanger position allows more ground clearance. 83mm Wheels and MTB hanger position will result in less ground clearance. If you ride the board on smooth tarmac both positions work. We have clamps for both hanger positions and offer a short and long motor mount (carbon panel). Both clamps fit both carbon panels. So with our kit its possible to set up your built either way. The MTB hanger position in combination with the long carbon panel allows to mount street and pneumatic wheels without the need to disassemble the motors. You just swap wheels and belt. 10mins job....

Make a short test with front Truck in regular non flipped position...

Call it LOWRIDER (-:

compared to flipped rear truck :

So you loose alot of ground clearence, wheelbase increases about 60mm.
Maybe like frank mentioned for really smooth concret ok, but i will stay with the flipped ones... The way it comes from Trampa :wink:

Unfortunaly i managed to kill both driven wheels... :pensive:
Do some small jumps and 180´s, suddenly there was a strange noise, after dismounting the rear wheels i see the cracks running through complete inner hub. Two cracks per wheel :

Maybe i overtighten the screws of the center ring ???
Dont think so but there must be a reason for it!

I have broken many flywheel clones like this. 
I think its because you maybe tighten the wheel pulley too much. I think i stopped breaking the clones after being careful not to over tighten the pulley. 
Or could be the wheels are cheap plastic since this never happened to my real Abec11 flywheels.

i already gave that feedback to trampa a few months ago, but frank @trampa never responded. if you tighten the pulleys too much, the retainer side will be compressed and the bearing sits tight in the bearing seat of the wheel core. the pulley side however is expanded, leading to really loose bearings. guess you took it one step further and actually cracked it open. 

wish the pulley side would be equal to the retainer side, so both bearing seats are compressed. in the end I barely tightened the screws and added a lot of loctite to make sure the screws wont come loose. :confused:

Hi Jens,

To tight... Six bolts create massive pressure, even when you think they sit loose. The problem is: You can't tighten them bolts, since one bolt will become loose the moment you tighten up the one next to it. So you keep going in circles and always think: They still sit loose. 

The entire wheel is flexible!
The bolts should not protrude the inner surface of the pulley! Flush is already quite tight.

I barley tighten them M4 bolts. Just very little. The teething of the pulley interlocks with the urethane to build up the friction. This works even when being very careful with bolt tension. 

Ted managed to do the same to ABEC 11 wheels btw. All spokes split. Its not the plastic, its the pressure from the bolts. Low temperatures ad to the problem. Winter and plastic is sometimes an issue. 

There is a manual online. Just browse to any E-STREET CARVER and hit the manual tab (desktop site).

Frank

To avoid the over stressing of the clone wheels hub I went with a snap on design for the street carve

Hey.

After destroyed the 83mm Wheels i dont work or drive the Carver for some time....

until @trampa released their pictures of the upcoming 125mm Urethan Wheels on Superstar Hubs :heart_eyes:

Also talked with @whitepony about the possibilities to mount a smaller Directdrive system with this 5Inch Wheels on the Carver Trucks

Started to made some 125mm Wheels out of POM, no Grip made for Drifting :imp:

Stick to the Vertigs unless you want to ride in the salty environment (beach). 
Ultimate is always white BTW. We have a special for MTBs:

Why do you recommend the Vertigs over the ultimates?

I ride by the beach but on bike path and never within 50ft of ocean water so salt probably won't be an issue.

This is cool.. @Nowind u should rename the title of the topic - Drift machine :D

I saw these odd ''side roller'' wheels in skateboard magazine / catalogue (btw mellow also had some ads there!)

Perhaps, if someone would up with some built in rollers.. you could easly ride a bit sideways also..:D similar to leiftech / freeboard

I dont have the picture with me.. I will take a photo when I can.. tried to search on the internet no luck :slight_smile:
They should have been on the kickstarter..

The idea behind their wheels was to save urethane when doing rail slides with skateboard.. their inbuilt rollers (inside the wheel) allowed the wheel to ''roll'' sideways'',

The overall look was a bit interesting but I assume it somehow worked if they decided to launch kickstarter for it

The guys at kickstarter just had more layers of rollers I believe.. + their wheels where more flat (wide) to resemble skate wheel more.

I think with 4wd drive and 4 seperate channels of throttle, you could do some really crazy stuff!

https://youtu.be/_tmiu1wpp_E?t=10s

https://youtu.be/CjcyHicm3NA?t=5s


+ there seems to be 2 designs.. one with ''perpendicular'' rollers and the second one with 45' angled ones (called _Mecanum wheels_, I believe)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW3OBb_b89k

As it can be seen.. the rolling / sliding action sideways might not be as great..


So not sure how great the ''perpendicular'' design works, as these seems to be using the 45degree (Mecanum) design.

Drifting is a tire killer, i think any material is going to get shredded quickly, if you make them thicker they will last longer obviously but then, you will lose the low profile, and after some use would exaggerate the wheel difference between back and front due to the back wheels losing tread at a much higher rate as shown in your piccys.

Hi @Maxid, you will not find a 6" pneumatic tire fitting our hubs. We actually just groove the moulds. Its a low profile tire and therefore something completely new in the field of small pneumatics. Things don't happen over night and it will take some Tim until they arrive.

Haha to be honest this kind of mounting the enclosure will eliminate any kind of flex :innocent:
You have to add slots on the bottom side too! Then you will gain more flex.
I wanted to test how it feels this way, and yeah if you want it more stiff then this is your way :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

You are right about the sunkko, could be something DocBrown have used :yum:

First 50km yesterday made yesterday, loving this FOC mode, so silent... 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/2/22c0a48ff4ba43c7b457e5f8a6355054739c039d.JPG" width="666" height="500">

This was yesterday a run of 20km with a average of 19km/h,
i charged back 8375mAh, so about 17wH / km ... not bad i think, only carving no straight runs...

I think you will get nice 30km range at least with this setup, the motors are to high KV i think ...efficience will get even better with some lower KV ones which fits better to 20-30km cruising speed... the actually topspeed i dont need :sunglasses:

M Screws in the deck are fine, but Loctite and our decks are not best friends. I would use Recoil or Baercoil inserts. It's not a lot more work and technically a lot better. 

You can also try outer spring position in the rear and inner in the front. There are so many options to adjust the perfect balance between extreme steering and crazy speed.

Yes its an massive increase of range for mine... but some friends thinks they should be even more possible with this big battery... they are riding evolve boards and have a similar range with half the battery size... IMO i maybe got the problem that the motor kv from 213 is good for about 50kmh topspeed but i run it on an average of maybe 20kmh, so its really ineficient... just a guess

Most position of the springs i already tested, this inner/inner is super carv and brings most fun actually on lower speeds... the inner/outer one i ride a lot with more speed and less carve... its very good to adjust IMO on every riding conditions... for crazy speedjunks you could even add some dampas, but this will not happen by mine (-;

Again a nice ride yesterday on the Kemnader Lake , 
with 33km tracked kilometers on 18kmh average the soft cut offs drops in !??!
I recharged 10700mAh, so i think the soft cutoffs comes really early isnt it?
Because i got a 5P wich means with the VTC6 cells 15000mAh

Liion can handle lower cutoff than lipo. Down 2.5v per cell. A safe bet is 3v cutoff start and 2.8v cutoff end with 18650s. Your cutoff may be too high

How do you keep moisture out of your enclosure?

im riding single motor 10S4P with 33->30V soft off. i would NOT go below 3v/cell and above 4.1v per cell for lifetime reasons. shallow discharge/recharge cycles! max recorded range at 22kph average about 48km with very soft carving.

think the offset can be explained by dual vs single and your twitchy trigger finger. carving hard also has a noticeable impact on range!

remember: at cold temperatures/high load, you loose more and more energy on inner resistance of the cells. 10vs15Ah sounds like a massive difference though, gotta check vtc discharge curves and compare Wh from full charge->full discharge with a shallow 4.1->3.4V cycle! there is usuallyquite a bit of energy left in the 3.4-3.0 interval under little load, did you ride soft off to dead or soft off and stopping?

I try to avoid water as much as possible but there always puddles and water that gets kicked up by the wheels. I was thinking of something like a water resistant mesh to cover the gaps as to still allow air in. I wonder how evolve makes a flexible enclosure.

As for the cutoff voltage I actually have it at 2.9 and 2.7 like jinra but for 12s. The thought is you're not going to reach that cutoff all the time but you'll have it available when you really need it

With 30V/28V for Li-Ion you are absolutely safe. And you still use most of the juice. And if you feel that the VESC starts to reduce the power when you pull the throttle hard then there is nothing wrong about it. Because the VESC takes care that you don't stress the batterys. You can even run it to a dead stop and it's still no issue for the batterys.
Don't forget that the specs of the batterys are tested at extreme conditions. Which means they charge it full and then discharge with maximum current till 2.5V. And do that over and over again. We don't come even close to this. So if your 10S4P is capable of 80A max discharge there is no way on a longboard that you draw this contentiously.

Let's have a look at one of my rides where i was going quite fast through the city.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/e/4ed7b6e0cf9e29381ad375506bd9ffd559ebfae8.png" width="283" height="500"> 
You see on the right side that i use on avergae **8A** of the Battery. And also i charged the battery on average with 0.5A. This is over the entire run. And it only counts when the board is moving. So you don't cheat the values by making a long break.
That means instead of 80A on average i draw 8A on average. So i honestly don't even care about lifetime. Even if i would use 80A continious a 10S4P battery would be good for 9000 km (300 cycles * 30km).

On the left side you see the average values which get counted only when you draw or charge power. So when you only roll without touching the throttle it doesn't get counted.
Over the entire run i had 13.024 Wh/km. On average i use between 10 till 14 Wh. Depends on the track and how much action i want that day.

Here for example i took it easy. Still quick but much more gently with the throttle.

Hey

Thanks for your input.
Never cared about Range and Lifetime by my Lipo eMTB builds, 
but actually with the street carver and some comercial boards riding with me i really get interrested in good range/lifetime/power mix :sunglasses:

Whats your charge end voltage ? 4.1 or going to full 4.2V 
Actually doing a charging sample, wanna see whats stored in the area of 4.1 to 4.2

## \#94 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2017-08-03T17:11:18.766Z Reads: 230

4.1v is about 90-95% capacity. Every .1v drop from full charge **doubles** the cycle life of the cell. However, since 4.1v doesn't hit balance voltage for most BMS's you'll still want to charge to full every so often to give the cells a chance to balance.

I checked with my charger the increase in mAh from

This is for my 10S5P with VTC6 cells

with 40+ cells I dont see a reason to max out on the cells, but thats just me. 30-40km is usually more than what I need!

Kind of a pitty that there will be a new VESC-Tool released.
That brings me (us) in the discrepance using @Ackmaniacs BLDC or the new VESC-Tool wich might also be amazing.

The throttle-curves of the VESC-Tool have a big disadvantage. When you want to make the acceleration progressive you automatically make the braking progressive as well. But in most cases you don't want that (mostly a linear braking feels the best). They need to be adjustable individually. 
And i think the current control of the VESC -Tool is more or less the same as watt control. Basically it feels the same to me. And a watt  maximum is adjustable as well. 
Only had a chance for a short ride but couldn't really feel a difference to my firmware for the VESC 4 hardware. It also has the same issues as the actual firmware has. Hope there are some more details that makes it better for the VESC 4 hardware.

## \#107 Posted by: trampa Posted at: 2017-08-12T16:58:24.800Z Reads: 238

```
The VESC-Tool integrates the FW and a lot has changed. It's completely rewritten and supports different chipsets now + a lot of changes to the FOC code. So it's not only a few clicks! 
Things are a lot more complicated now. This is why it took so much time to write the new code. 
You should also compare the new FOC with throttle curves to the Watt control first. Everything is very smooth now. I'm totally confident with power delivery. 

Maybe Benjamin will ad it in (if he thinks its something bringing benefits), which is probably the most secure way to assure things don't get messy.
He is the only one understanding all the dependencies.

150$ retail. Why should we make losses? 
Think of VAT (20%), company Tax (25%), staff, warehouse rent, R&D costs, moulds, Insurance, product returns, travel expenses, production financing and a lot more.
A Company is like a bathtub with open drain.
And finally, if you pay yourself a salary, its taxed again. People always confuse products profit with profit. There is quite a gap between those two values. Customers want the factory price and the service and innovation a business provides - these two things can't be combined.

I completely agree with you. However, I believe there is sufficient demand for VESC 6 and that profits lay in volume, not in margin. But I guess it's easy for me to say that when I'm not the one taking the risk. Perhaps you'd consider a testing out lower price and seeing if the increase in sales volume nets the same amount of profit with the price point you currently have.

There is another spot welder on endless-sphere i think its called arduino-spot-welder wich is also very nice, but with simpler Display.

I once tried the sunkko 709 or one of its clones and it worked fine, but iread about alot of circumstances where that thing just blew up and stopped working.
Another thing is that those MOSFet-Car-battery spot welder are community "kind-of open-sourced" and mostly built in Europe if you are from there. And not chinese Slave-production

Heck I would be even happy with a $200 price point really. For me this is just a very expensive hobby :slight_smile:

I was about to pull the trigger on (2) Vesc-6 every day this month -- then I say to myself, next paycheck...lol.

Frank can't you just send this to China and make it for like $50-75 each in large volume?

I know nothing about making stuff in China but I know those 6374 motors... you can for example buy in bulk for about $30-40 each if you buy about 100+ then just private label them, slap on some sensors (if ya want sensored), slap on your logo, then sell them for like $120 each -- TB, APS, ESK8 seem to be vendors of such motors and other suppliers in this business seem to do it.

Honestly, even though I am just an enthusiast, there has to eventually be a player who will deal a large enough volume that you can build these boards in the $1000 ~ range. I would love to see it be somebody like a Trampa (who supports the builders and develops the community) rather than Amazon or HobbyKing.

Right now the prices are staggering for the components:

1. Board + trucks + wheels = Trampa ~ $400-$500
2. 2x motors = ~ $180 - $270  (sensored or unsensored)
3. Motor mount = $200-$600 (dual drive)
4. Vesc-6 x 2 = $600
5. Battery packs or 18650 and enclosures = $250-$500
6. Miscellaneous items - remote receiver, wiring, tools, $100-$200

Somewhere I heard, that if you buy a Trampa board they will sell you (2) Vesc-6 for £187 ($240) but I guess you have to go with their motor mount and all to get that deal. It's actually not a terrible deal -- I priced one out came to about $1500 delivered (no batteries, you can buy Zippy's).  Lol, I probably spent so much more building my own.

-- my $0.02

I am new to skateboarding and got myself the Trampa Street Carver Desk 15ply but with ATB Spring Ultimate Trucks  with Superstar Hubs and Evolve GT tiers. 

The Ultimate Titanium trucks got a 10mm axle, while the Carver Trucks got an 8mm axle.

Is it possible to mount those lovley ABEC 11 - 107mm Flywheels on a 10mm axle?

Yes you just need 10mm bearings. Trampa sells them, as well as Surf Rodz

Trampa
ATB Infinity  - 12mm axle
ATB Vertigo - 12mm axle
ATB Ultimate - 9.525mm axle

Mini Carver, Urban and Street - 9.525mm axle

Get proper bearings and spacers to make them fit. Trampa sells bearings that fit their stuff.

For 9,5mm I belive it's R6rs bearing.
