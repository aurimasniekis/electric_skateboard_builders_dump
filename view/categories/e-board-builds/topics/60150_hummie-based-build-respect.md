Hi all,

Just started to build my second eSk8 and and wanted to update everyone regarding the process as it comes together.  
 
Build Specs:
Deck:    @Hummie wood carbon deck V2
Battery: @psychotiller 12s4p Q30
Enclosure : @psychotiller  ARC v2, anti spark switch, meter
Vesc: Dual Focbox @Scoo_B_SK8 
Motors, Trucks and  Wheels: @Hummie latest hub motor kit (waiting for shipping)
Control: Enertion: Nano-X

First the Hummie Deck:  I was extremely impressed with the quality of the deck however it did require I opened up the pocket with a router.  Not a big deal used a straight router bit in Makita router with edge guide. Took it slow and it came out just fine. I then applied a layer of fish paper as extra protection as well as a rubber auto & marine weather seal gasket to wood end and mid way up to hold battery in place.

![image|689x337](upload://IionaVXyErG16HK1HtbmECn2Hr.jpg)
@psychotiller battery pack fits awesome with 7" area to mount Focbox, remote and wiring. When I received the pack plunged in an let the battery balance took about 3hr with the 2amp charger that came with the battery.

Will cut down the length of the the XT60 from the battery and solder a new connection not a problem however will reduce wire bulk.

![image|631x388](upload://inq3wxw9916R1ULKmJI54xlApWv.jpg)

Plan to mount both Focbox to an aluminum plate to add additional heat sinking. The enclosure fitted with weather seal as well

Just came out to San Fran to try his hubs and man these pack nearly as much power if not the same as the raptor 2, and the tires he uses even after 200 miles feel like a dream over cracks.

 I am so excited to get and ride these hubs when complete...been a long project for @Hummie but I am always one to support innovation. @Hummie has been such a strong supporter I am trying to keep it real with his gear as well....I also have to mention a shout out for @psychotiller he has also been at the forefront of supporting innovation and pushing the limits (by the way he is faster than Jimmy Johns at delivery of batteries :grinning:)

Not really but I do have some foam between it and deck to make sure it has ability for some movement.  The deck is stiffer than most think on normal road conditions do not think much flex will occur if you are making into a all terrain board you are going to jump / get external may be a different deal.

You will have to ask @psychotiller as he provided battery and enclosure.  To be honest you can‚Äôt beat what he offers unless you plan on getting into building a lot of batteries.  He provides a high quality 30q Samsung build with, power meter, anti spark switch and switch, charging port and 2amp charger. I bought the enclose from him at the same time I purchased the battery and he mounted all items into the enclosure for me.  In my case I asked him to do the enclosure meter, power switch and charging port and because I purchased a battery at the same time he did it for free.

```
Yes, plan will be Velcro battery but will be appliying some additional strain relief to compensate for any board flex.  I have some concepts and will provide pict once installed. I am going to add additional thermal mass the the Focbox to help better dissipate heat...not decided how I will attach. My idea is to pair the Focbox up on a single aluminum plate with thermal grease.  These will be mounted solid to the plate and then the plate prob attached with industrial Velcro.

How difficult was the routing process? What did you use tool/bit wise? I'm finding out that I'll have to do the same to squeeze a pack in mine. The pack is double stacked too so I'm thinking kydex for an enclosure...not too sure yet

Routing was straight forward and easy used a straight small router bit and adjusted length to cavity depth, just take it slow and don't force it.

You could always use a small circular saw. (Small cordless is ideal) set to depth and use a guide. You can use a sharp chisel to pare off the strips and sort the ends.

Lol I got the NESE Modules for my battery and had to route the cutout to like 190mm x 625mm, or real close to that, I don't want to measure again, but it still holds up fine when I stand on it.  Thing is sturdy, :smile:![15337858497431192760076771994032|374x500](upload://qzBowFtM3u0ccuIydGA6xTuvE9O.jpg)

Nice.   So you routed approximately 1/8" from each side to fit the width of the battery?

I don't have access to a router or many tools here in Manahattan so I'll have to look into taking it to someone to take care of that for me.

Yep...Make sure whoever does the work setups guides for the router.  A 1/8" is a small amount of material and if they try to freehand they will have a lot of trouble holding a smooth parallel edged pocket.

I'm waiting too!  I'll get some info Monday. If I don't get an email response by Tuesday I'll call.   
I'm coming to find there's a huge difference in rolling resistance w the different bearings.  When tires come I'll write up and ask if u guys want other bearings put in for some more bucks.  No cost for 2rs sealed bearings I have from China. Lotton bearings.  But they're filled w so much heat resistant grease, which isn't really necessary and you won't be getting to 200f anyway.  Or I recently got some ntn Japanese bearings  w non contact rubber seals n they roll so much easier.  If only they could be serviced on the motor as taking the motor apart to get them out isn't easy as I want to use retaining fluid to lock it up tight.   Thinking might be worth leaving the seals off so can easily clean the bearings n run them with thin lube.  In fact I think the lotton bearings are probably more than good enough n they're really huge n can take the loads even if they aren't fancy Japanese or German. 

 We can decide later and haven't closed them yet.  But if u want the jap bearings they're fregin 30$ a motor for me.  Shocking the variation in bearing prices.  If, in the meantime, while we wait maybe a week max more, fingers crossed,  you happen to find some bearings u want or any good info or prices on 6804 and 6808 bearings,  I'm willing to get them and put in on them w you. Or it's lotton w the 2rs seals n jammed w the high heat grease. 
I find u can remove and replace the seals on most bearings including these and that's possible w the 6808 while on the motor but the smaller bearing u can't access to get the seal off. ...writing rambling n thinking.  U could get the motors without being locked w retaining fluid n then could take it apart w a c-clip tool alone but eventually the shafts n housings will take a beating I fear n according to the rest of the world bearings should be locked down w a press fit r retaining fluid.

150mm is 5.9 inch‚Äôs and for the pack configuration I have a12s4p you need at least 150mm pocket. The deck is awesome but as most things a little customization may be necessary.  I believe @Hummie original design intent was for Lipo battery system.

It depends on how the 12s4p is made and how the cells are positioned. Your pack sounds like it was made with 6 rows of 8 vertical cells. Mine was made with 2 rows of 24 horizontal cells... I think this is where people are having a disconnect.![20180812_080907|500x500](upload://yGhG3VgWBw36lBDpDYEqCL1xBZ4.jpg)

If you have any reservations regarding @Hummie genius all you have to do is work with some of the items he has designed.  The deck is just perfect in all its geometry also even at my weight of 200lbs or 14.3 Stone I can jump up and down and get maybe 2mm of total deflection.

Beautiful build, much stealth.  I can't figure out where the power button is, inside the base plate maybe?  I see the leads but don't see the switch from the top view.

Enlighten us please :slight_smile:

The power button is next to the display to the right, just a simple rocker switch provided by @psychotiller and charging port is to the left.  The two wires cumming up to top of deck are from the 10s for charging.  @Scoo_B_SK8 10s pack he lowned me has a different connect so once I get my 12s back those wires go away.

Took it out on her maiden voyage and everything worked beautiful, tons of low end and did not get close to top end yet.  So damn quiet, has little to no motor noise, and sounds very close to regular long board when rolling under power. I will do some more tuning on the throttle curve as it just is a little too aggressive and want a smoother initial acceleration ( this may be user induced). It climbs as good as my dual 190kv 6374 all terrain board.

What about a push to start on one of these? Then there‚Äôs no power button to worry about?
(Thanks @Surfer for putting this thought in my head..)
