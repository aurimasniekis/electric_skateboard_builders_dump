Hi All,

I'm very new here but have lurked for a few months / done some research into buying a commercial (boosted,evolve) board but am discovering it may be better to make my own whilst also fun.

I'm in Australia and from what I'm hearing it's not as easy to get parts here. I've been looking a bit and its pretty confusing to know what I need/don't need. 

Hoping someone can chime in with minimum I could get with a spend of around 700 AUD for something that can eat hills as where I live there is heaps of them. I don't want to go crazy fast more comfortable commuting and rather not stack it on the way to work - but I don't want to crawl up a hill at 10km or less either.

I have decks already that I would happily convert more just looking for the main stuff I need to get the ball rolling and potentially upgrade to better parts down the track. 

Appreciate any input.

Cheers


**Updated the title, as I know the ultimate choices I made don't really make this a "Hill Eater" but I think it'll go OK we shall see.**

Welcome fellow queenslander.  
Brissy sure does have some gnarly hills.  Problem you will face is getting enough torque while still making it light enough for commuting.  
What kind of board are you planning on building is the first question.
Hubs?
Satellite?
Long or short?
Liion or lipo?
Parts are not difficult to get here but some suppliers can take a while to arrive.  The budget seems a bit light too.

Hey mate thanks for the reply.

Basically  I want something i can take into the office and leave under my desk without it being a major nuisance. Weight isnt a huge issue because i can skate door to door and only have to carry it a little (but obviously dont want it to weigh 50kg)

 Probably should mention in first post I'm 90kg so really my main need is power to get uphills without having to get off and walk. (These hills are probably between 15-20 degree which is almost max for most commercial boards and one main reason I am wanting to build my own) 

I have two old globe decks i could use but also would be wiling to get something else if it turns out it wont work - I have a globe big blazer (first preference - short board) and a bamboo series long board. 

https://www.basementskate.com.au/globe-big-blazer-cherry-bamboo-complete-cruiser-skateboard/

My budget is pretty fluid - i could really do more if it's going to tick all the boxes.

I'm initially thinking dual hubs unless someone says that is a bad idea also first thought is Lipo - happy to spend more for some convenience/ease of installation especially with the battery i dont want to be connecting cells 

Something like below: 

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-graphine-3000mah-5s1p-65c.html?countrycode=AU&gclid=Cj0KCQiAxZPgBRCmARIsAOrTHSbQPsOeOq-WYUPi3HuMdnh_idfU8hSOD1hDCfDlOZ8Nt8OAnPmOEeoaAjVUEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds

I definitely need to do more research but am piecing it together as I go appreciate the response. This will probably happen over the next 6 months and I'll update on my progress here.

Hi there, I would say that hubs are generally speaking not what you should go for when conquering hills. Dual belt drive with smaller wheels would be my choice. For battery I would suggest a liion for the convenience of being able to charge it easily

Welcome to the club.
I had similar intentions for my build.
Things I wished I had known when starting.

The board is going to be heavier than you think.
Make sure you buy motor mounts that fit your trucks.
Lipos are a quick,cheap and fairly easy power solution. The more packs the further you go.
Charging without a BMS is a bit of pain though, but I made sure I had enough juice to get to work and back again before needing a charge.
Moving over to a pre-made Li-ion pack with built in charging solution made me love the board even more.
Big hills need big ESCs.

Heaps of info in here, just got to be real patient to find the answers you need.

Thanks for the input man, so much to consider... i thought i was getting closer but its never ending i really just want to dive in and then learn some lessons / upgrade as i get more knowledge familiarity with what i need/want. 

Li-Ion is sounding a lot better at this stage as I want to avoid getting all the extra chargers etc that you need otherwise and am happy to pay more for that convenience - so to clarify if i got Li-ion I wouldn't need a BMS or balance charger. 

Just a straight up charger something like this

$700 AUD will be a challenge if its dual drive. I would suggest surfing the for sale section for some good deals on motors and vescs. 

For hill climb you will want low kv motors / high gear ratio.  You can pick a reasonable top speed like 30kph then calculate backwards your gear ratio depending on your wheel size, kv, voltage. This will give you good torque. Less top speed will equal more torque.

For single drive you will want the biggest motor like 6374, but if its dual you could get racestar 5065 size which will be enough power and they are cheap and reliable. Same motor as evolve use.

I think you need dual for hills. Going down hills its much safer to have the redundancy of two motors.

Yeah that kind of charger looks about right for charging at Li-ion. If you are buying a premade, most of them would probably come with an appropriate charger.
But buying a premade Li-ion pack will pretty much blow your budget out the water.
I started off with two 3S lipos (6S) and a single drive to start.
Then upgraded to dual drive 9S.
Bought the BMS and charger to make my own charging solution, but then found a local guy selling a used Li-Ion battery pack from TorqueBoards for cheaps and that was it for me.

This one might be a good one but wont exactly eat hills. I will however go ok if you upgraded the battery or swapped it for lipos. It is within your budget though and in Australia.

I live in Brisbane too though and commute 35km. I use dual 6374's with 10s lipos and have never had a hill slow me down. I also love the motor braking however the board is heavy. I am currently setting up a smaller board with a kicktail and single 6374 which will be a lot lighter and will see how it is to commute on that. I am 80kg and carry 15kg worth of gear on my commute too so probably similar to you. I prefer lipos for their punch and lack of sag and you can often get really good deals on hobbyking. I just carry a couple of spare packs and swap them out when they run out. For motors I have sk3 6374 190kv which are also from hobbyking. For trucks Caliber are good but if you are not going fast and want to carve and have fun I love the evolve supercarver trucks which you can buy online or go to their store on the goldcoast. You will really appreciate the turnability of the supercarvers in Brisbane for your commutes. This is just what I have found suits me from my trial and error. Hope this helps

I run 10s2p lipo nano techs (so 9ah worth) and have dual 6374's at 192kv. Goes like the bloody clappers and certainly out-pulls any evolve or boosted. Range wise i get about 30km before my vesc settings cut me out (30km is shit loads)

Here's the issue with a 700 aud budget. Your going to end up buying cheap parts that will crap out quickly after you buy them because hills = high stress on parts. In my testing, even a mild hill results in 15x the power consumption.

Avoid cheap 4.12 vescs, they will break.
Avoid cheap china parts in general, they will break.
If you want a real board, you need at least double your budget.
Other wise, you'll just waste your money on shitty parts that will break and then you'll end up in the same spot with 700 less.
We've all done this, it's called the false economy. So be careful.

Good VESC's start at $160 usd (not sure the conversion to aud, I think that's like $220 aud) each (chaka 4.12 is bullet proof), and go up to $300 usd (around $400 aud) each (Trampa's official VESC 6). There's a few VESC 6 clones in between that (stewiis is good), but avoid any direct from china stuff if you want parts that will last.

Motor mounts and motors, china is generally ok. With the exception of hub motors from china, they are all garbage. Your better off with belts or even direct drive gears if you can afford it. The reason being you'll get more torque for your buck. High powered hub motors or direct drive motors will eat your entire budget.

In terms of a battery, use a 10s-12s. You can put multiple batteries together to get that. General rule of thumb is around 10 wh per mile on flat, 20 wh or more on hills. wh = ah * voltage. If you want any sort of decent  range (say 20 km), you'll want at least 9ah at 12s or 12ah at 10s.

You do pretty well. I get about 25 km out of two sets of 10s 5000ah packs. Using 3 sets of packs I get 35km with a bit in reserve. I do go through a lot of hills going from one side of the city to the other through. Also @evoheyax is spot on about the vescs. I run focboxes with a home made heatsink and they don‚Äôt even get warm. I have had 0 issues with them. You would obviously have to get a unity or 2nd hand focboxes now but I tried my brothers eBay Vesc and it gets super hot on flat and reaches thermal throttling limiting power up hills. Definitely spend the extra. You won‚Äôt regret it. Just think of it as an investment that you will make back by not using the car or bus for your commute

Thanks again for this man I think it'd be really good to see if the single motor does a good enough job at that weight - considering my priority is torque over top speed i was thinking of trying this to cut down on weight - i'm well and truly starting to discover the amount of variations i could go with and it's great but going to be hard to decide now

I believe it is the traction of that one wheel that sets the limitation of torque uphill. Especially when cornering while going up hill, where all your weight is going to the side without propulsion. I would take a dual 5065 over single 6380 because of this. But it could cost a lot more. Although I see that you already have a dual kit in your basket? Then you could add a VESC more and buy two cheap small motors instead of that large one?

Thanks for that info man i am weighing up options atm. 

I looked at their full kit aswell which would be nice but then I'd have to use my other board as the components wont fit the board I want to use only has 420mm of space underneath. 

I'm pretty likely to go with that cart but just weighing up battery/power options to fit the board space otherwise if turns out for what I want I need more space I might buy a full kit

One suggestion is get a better wheel, the ones included are not good, and since you will commute daily it's worth getting a quality wheel

But as others said, do not cheap out, what you can do if your budget is really tight is build a quality single drive already planned to go dual in a few months

It will climb fine as long as the roads are smooth and no tight corners in big hills or you will loose traction depending which way you are turning

I'm still weighing up multiple wheel options as the roads i'll be traveling are pretty crap in some spots so i'm considering these beasts

What do you base that statement on?  I have 3 sets of tb 97's and they are a great wheel tbh.  Better wear rate than my 107's abecs.  The abecs had chunks out of them after 200k's.  For the difference in ride quality its a negligible thing.

Thats what i thought would be the case switching from tb's to abecs.  It just wasn't enough to compensate for the quick wear though.  I have a set of tb's that are nearly 18 months old and they have little to no wear.  We do have good roads though. Gravel in the bike lanes is bad though and I think the abecs struggle with that.  They chip and chunk where the tb's don't.  Oh and don't always believe what you read here either.  Some people comment without any actual experience.  Seriously they do you know.  :wink:

done so much research now got no idea what to do i want to basically get right back to basics and then if its not enough upgrade later - what might be an option if my range to and from equals less than 5km literally 1.5k each way (10km would be heaps.)

pretty lost on batteries - i want the power but my trip is like 5minutes each way so I' m happy to sacrifice range even significantly for less cost and weight/space savings

the board i want to use doesn't have much room underneath (420mm) so i want to try save space with two vescs and batteries i'm struggling to see how this will be possible - I figure less batteries = less range (but that's fine for now) or does that mean I wont get enough power as well for dual motors. (forgive me if that is a really stupid assumption - I have read a lot about batteries today but no engineer and maths is not my friend) 

if i can get away with one battery pack and have to charge it daily that is totally fine with me for now. (open to any type of battery suggestions even if they are expensive) i could literally even ride to work charge it and ride home charge it again (but that's probably a bit too minimal - not ideal but to give an idea where i'm at with range anxiety...)

At this stage working out as everyone said 700 is no way in the vicinity of getting this done - it'll be 1200-1500 but its getting hard not to justify just buying a used evolve or something at this point

If I were you and trying to build cheap and for hills I would start on a single motor with a 6374 or a 6380, do the single motor mechanical kit which will save you a bunch, go with the 12s2p instead of going 6S and that single motor will be a beast up hills. If you look up "Lookout Mountain" in Colorado I was riding up that hill the last year on a single motor (6355 and 6374) on a 12s4p, so don't let any of these guys tell you that you can't get some decent power on a single motor. The 6380 is almost double the wattage of a single 6355 and it's lower KV rating will give you some monster power up hills. You're gonna cut the cost from half a side of mounts, 1 motor and 1 less vesc to buy, that's about $400-500 off of what you are currently looking at. If you're really wanting to save a super chunk you could also pick up a cheaper chinese battery or pick up some hobby based cells to save a bit in that department. Unless you go for chinese quality though I reckon you'll probably be out around 700-900 on a single motor project depending on what you pick for it.

thanks for that response, i'm definitely still considering that - i kinda figured with this i might as well buy it all and whether i use it now or not isn't a huge deal could eventually make two boards kinda addicted already :P 

But at the same time the main thing that led me down this path is the ability to use the 6s prebuilt battery with that enclosure all ready made because it fits under my board nicely, still researching and looking for battery options (i just got a pm from Matt with some other options for smaller batteries) which is my biggest unknown at this stage and was determining the motors in that cart.  

honestly i wont be buying anything for at least a month or two but just doing mega research. everyone here is awesome for the input i cant wait to be able to show what i've done with the help from people here.

Another reason I gathered dual over single would be worth it for me is i also have to go down these hills and through my reading have seen a lot of people recommending dual for better breaking as well

I think you‚Äôve answered your own question, dual is the right path. I used two Keda motors 190kv 6355 and two vescs from a forum member. That paired with a 12s Lipo battery came to about $330AUD and that‚Äôs the main parts you just need a deck, switch, wheels, trucks and mounts which I‚Äôm sure you could get for $300 if you search around. 

In the thread I linked above you can see the other parts for my build. Total cost was about $650 AUD and that thing rips, does 60km/h and eats all hills I‚Äôve come across. It also sent my mate flying the other day as it was much more powerful than he expected

Since when did their track record improve?

Last time I saw it, they work great in BLDC, but lack the upgrades to run FOC reliably... Unless their picture is super old, I can see the caps that should be upgraded but are not.

Beyond that, the 4.12 only has 2 shunts, so it can't measure the 3rd phase, it tries to calculate it, and vedder even said this doesn't always work out, resulting in drv errors.

I personally have 2 boards running TB VESC's in FOC, a single and a dual.  I know many many people that have TB VEC's running in FOC & Hybrid mode.  

I've argued this so many times, I'm just lost why people think they are not good.  If you sell 1000 widgets and have a 5% failure rate that's 50 complaints.  If you sell 100 widgets with the same 5% failure rate that's only 5 complaints.  The reason there are more 'visible' complaints is because he sold so frikkin many.

The TB VESC is not as robust as a FocBox obviously and its more susceptible to user error, but it's a perfectly serviceable VESC.

I don't want to bash something that doesn't deserve bashing. I wish for scientific purposes, we had some sort of group that did analysis of vesc varieties for consumer protection purposes.

Since all of these sources, from hobbyking, to maytech, to diyelectric, and many more are using the same BOM and same pcb layout, other than assembly (and possible fake parts), there's really no difference in them. My testing of cheap china vescs has continued to frustrate me, as it did Derek.

Derek was the first person I met who actually experienced the same thing as me, but he had way more money to blow. He tested all of the vescs and all of the hub motors at the time, spending easily 10k+ on parts between almost a dozen boards. He found the same thing as me. The only vesc that stood up was the official vesc 6 and the chaka 4.12 vesc (and that every hub motor either had shitty thane or slipping thane).

I personally have never tried a TB VESC, because all of my enertion VESCs fell apart instantly. When chaka came along, and found the same problems occurring, and then made some changes, and saw these problems go away, he was able to improve the reliability so much that he's still on the 4.12 platform.

Since then, I've had 3x Flipsky 6.6's fail on me within a week each, and replaced with a vesc 6 in the same enviroment, and 4 months later (of 50 miles a day, 5 days a week for work), still going.

Every cheap china VESC I've tried has failed me, and Derek had the same consensus.

If TB vesc's are using chakas upgrades, I would say its probably ok (baring that assembly is good). If not, I don't trust them.

But if you want 100% guaranteed reliability, get a chaka VESC or trampa vesc 6. Still the only 2 vesc's I can say have never failed me, ever.

@mmaner your argument is the same as Jasons. I understand that a few bad ones don't speak for the crowd. But it's hard to get a consensus as to what makes them break or even the real failure rate. Not everyone will say, hey this broke. They might think it's their fault and move on. Some will buy and never use it and resell it. Some will buy and it will sit on a desk for a year or more. Actually going straight into a deck seems to be a less common then buy and sit on a desk for a while (we've all been there and done that). So then do you say we can't rely on half of the people to report their failure and another half of that won't use them for some time. So now you have 25% left and 5% of those report a failure, so now your really at a 20% failure rate?

This is all speculation, as is the real failure rate. No one really knows because of these factors.

I just want people to understand their's risks taken when you buy cheaper components. I wish we had a solution, but to me, it's about quality testing.

The Vesc 6 is tested very well by vedder. I trust he's solved any issues and made it reliable, and this has been my experience with it. Chaka does a good job testing his vesc design also. Both know what they are doing, and it's resulted in vesc's that haven't failed me.

Nothing against Dexter, but he's a business man, not a vesc wizard. I don't think he can test them properly without relying on someone else to do the testing. And it that person is the factory making them, I don't trust them.

I wish we could have $100 perfect VESC 6's, which based on the cost of the BOM for the vesc 6 (under $30), should be very easy to do. But planned obsolesce is good for business. Reliability means no need to replace, which means less money consumers will give you (as a business). And if you can convince the public it's not a design flaw, but just a freak accdent, they will keep buying from you. See how brilliant the game is? I fell into this trap with enertion, and I'm still bitter about it. I am 100% convinced that if caps aren't upgraded, and your running 12s foc, it's likely a ticking time bomb that will go off sooner rather than later.

If money is limited, spend it on bullet proof parts instead of semi relibable parts. Maybe they work out and save you some money, maybe they don't and now your in square one. This happened to me and many many other long term members here (the false economy). I should have spent less than $2k to build my first quad board... $3.5k later due to shitty electronics failing.

The problem with this is that its full of assumptions with no verification, so from the "Value of a Dataset" point of view its just worthless.  You can't make a bunch of assumptions, call them true for the sake of an argument and expect it to have any value or validity. 

What I can say from my personal experience with my own boards is this...

1.  TB VESC's are great for cruisers and limited FOC, like hybrid mode
2.  FocBox's are good for whatever
3.  Vesc 6 is overpriced as it actually does NOT handle high amps as well as a FocBox

@evoheyax if you really want reliability, use 10S.  This matters a lot more than the rest of that.  Whenever you're pushing parts beyond what they're designed for, failures are part of the game.  The DRV83xx parts are not suitable for 12S operation with inductive loads if you want something reliable.  It's that simple.

All I'm trying to do is speculate from my corner, from my experience, possibly what could be happening.\\

The only real solution is an unbiased testing system. And I'm ready to undertake that. I'll be posting something soon about this after I start some organization of this project. But it needs to be done.

@b264 Yet I have put 1000's of miles on my chaka 4.12's at 12s with high amp loads...

Again, I'll be posting something soon about a project I'm nick naming "The VESC Test" (pending frank doesn't sue me, haha). It's time we settle this issue once and for all, so that science can move forward, and the consumers know what they are buying...

Hey man, I'm not trying to argue with you. Seriously. You said it's not up to par, but I have 8 of his vesc's running 12s and never had an issue, and everything else has always blown up, except the offical vesc 6 also. Chaka also runs 12s and many who use his vesc have and he has had a very low fail rate compared to other vendors.

All I can do is correlate data. This is how we do data analysis and build AI models. But if the correlations are bad, you end up with a shitty model and a shitty result. Are my correlations good? IDK... More testing is needed to understand what is at play here.

In the mean time poor old troy is getting more and more confused.  Really does get on my nerves when comments are bandied around with no actual real experience.  Unless you use the things daily then you do not have an opinion.  Period.  @mmaner does have this actual experience as do I regarding tb vesc, I run 2 on 10s which have never let me down. Had them running 12s too for a few months.  I have 2 HK vesc running 10s with no issues so far as for focboxes well I have 6 of those things and again no issues.  Does this make me special?  No but it does give me the right to comment on whether or not I think they are good units.  This thread is not the place to get into a big discussion on which mode is better or whether the bloody capacitors need upgrading.  its about helping the guy to make informed decisions based on experience.  Not hearsay.  Experience.  So unless you are using the actual parts @Customesk8 is thinking about using then please keep the confusing statements to yourself.  This game is hard enough without all the bluster and pomp.

If your new.. and don't do your homework.. yeah, you might break it.

That's why I can't say shit about it. But What I said is the picture you have doesn't show any upgrades, and I said without those upgrades, I personally wouldn't trust it, that's all.

I was new when I bought enertions 2nd and 3rd batch vesc's, but I knew what I was doing. It wasn't me. Then I bought chakas upgraded vescs, and never had a problem again, until I tried a cheap china 4.12 which broke again.

Are you using chaka's upgrades? If so, you could update the picture to reflect it!

Most of our customers don't post on forums (a lot do, but not all). They are beginners as you can see from this post. Adding more technical details doesn't help as far as making it less confusing for people.

Our products aren't the cheapest as far as BOM costs go. Majority of our parts are actual originals. We replace our VESCs a lot of times even if it is a user error. Going cheap would hurt us negatively in the long-run.

I don‚Äôt think his vescs need the Chaka upgrades, I have them running at 12s perfectly fine for the last 6 months or so. 

Have you ever thought maybe, just maybe you are the reason they always die, and that you need to use very high quality ones for them to survive. Whereas the normal rider is using them perfectly fine, I don‚Äôt see many complaints about burnt 4.12 vescs anymore, just the odd noob who tried to run two motors with one vesc or didn‚Äôt run detection.

The other thing I noticed is that the vescs you claim to have worked all have large heat sinks, is it possible you have been overheating all other vescs and that‚Äôs why they die. I would take all heatsinks off the Chaka/ trampa vesc and then test them the same way you do... now that is a real comparison.

Always compare apples with apples, not oranges

All I want to do is get to the bottom of why so many vescs used to fail (I never saw any real unbiased effort into this).

Vedder himself said he recommends using the 6 over the 4.12.

Maybe the problem is me and the way I ride. But if they will break the way I ride, then how do you know the next noob that comes along isn‚Äôt going to break it because he rides that way also... if it can be broken When used within the specs given then there‚Äôs a design flaw. If not, great. I have a cheap esc I can recommend to noobs.

You say that, but it doesn't change anything.  When you label someone as a fanboy your degrading their opinion by insinuating that their opinion is only formed from their love of a product or person and not experience.  It's not fanboys, its correcting a statement you made that will confuse new builders.  Insulting people that don't agree with you is kind of elementary and childish.

Once again, false.  

There are literally hundreds, likely thousands, of people using TB VESC's in FOC that don't have issues, yet you persist with the opinion that to work reliably they need upgrades.  Its just crazy!

I bought them without the mount and just made my own plate out of stainless steel however you can buy mounting plates for the supercarvers to suit 63mm motors on the forum or if you do a quick internet search.

They are actually very simple to make if you have a drill and grinder but if you don‚Äôt have these and the skills and time you may just want to buy the mounts.

Exactly you have heaps of room. Also an option might be to buy the @Boardnamics mounts which are cheap and simply drill an idea extra hole in them to suit the truck mount. I have these mounts too and have taken a photo to show you. They fit perfect with two holes lining up but the third not so you would need to just drill that one out when you have positioned the mount where you want it. They would also have to be reverse mounted. This is the only reason why I didn‚Äôt use them as I wanted to mount my motor infront of the rear truck rather than behind and behind the front truck. Other than that they fit fine. They are not as strong as stainless but are lighter and will be plenty strong enough for what you need ![image|666x500](upload://xPn3si7ETUzdL9IUnMs7yz9Esm1.jpeg)

I could've saved money in a few areas but I made decisions based on what i wanted not cost i went with much more expensive batteries than i could have gotten away with because of the profile i want this board to have

Man for $800 you make a fairly nice board. Those parts are not worth the money.

I would recommend 10s lipos, 190kv Keda motors, a vesc or two from flipsky or hobbyking (search eBay), bypass bms and charger.

Please take some of this advise, there is a reason not many use 6s and high kv motors. If you want a full parts list pm I can help you out with some that will work well.

Edit: I just read the bit about the evolve trucks, I think you should look into gulwing sidewinder trucks, they are essentially the same just narrower and welding some custom aluminium mounts to them

Being from Brisbane here is my advice like @evoheyax has stated

Don't be tight it's like any cheap shit will just break especially if your gonna take this thing around Brisbane up hills and over the shithouse roads and footpaths. 

I've gotten stuff from Tourqueboards and Flipsky which was delivered fast and so far has been reliable as. Don't bother with Mboards if you don't like waiting forever. Check your measurements carefully for enclosures because waiting for a new one takes forever from OS. Or just go check out Jaycar they have heaps of this stuff.

I built a foosted board copy-ish and it's killed any hill so far that I can throw at it and I'm over 90kg. I just put a cheap eBay battery capacity monitor on it.  Spend on a decent battery.

So I've received my batteries, motor and VESC - now i'm freaking out as the batteries are at 30% and it says charge to storage level asap. i didn't realize that'd be the case and i have yet to buy the charger etc. 

is it an issue to leave the batteries for a few weeks in this state?

Actually a high chance is might be a month or more before i have the gear to charge the batteries

Lipo batteries like all batteries degrade over time. The rate of degradation is accelerated for charge states below 20% and over 80%.
As long as the pack does not drop below 20% (and it should not unless it is defective) you have at least 3-4 months before it looses that 10%.

I have Lipos over 5 years old at storage charge state that have not lost 5% of their charge.
Just make sure to monitor the voltage from time to time. Sometimes you may get a defective pack that leaks voltage due to various reasons.
I had a 6S 5000mAh pack that would lose charge in one of its cells over the course of one year, IR was fine on all 6 cells and it discharged fine, no short on the balance wires. I could not pinpoint the reason it lost charge at that one cell but kept using it without problems. At one point I had not checked it or flown the RC helicopter I used it for, so that one cell died and I sacrificed it to make a 3S pack to power my spot welder.

First bit of real work done. I think there is still some metal shavings inbetween the washers .

need to adjust it at bit as I know it's not straight it's just in there temporarily no lock-tight yet. 

thanks to @pat.speed for the washer recommendation, they work perfectly.

I personally think from my experience that your worth getting a flipsky 4.12 vesc as you can get them for 80 aud instead of 130 aud from ebay and I own both vescs and I see no quality difference, also whoever said caliber 2's aren't good for speed is full of it. I have a single 6374 motor 12s build and I have a top speed of 60kmh and my caliber 2's are super loose so I can make tight corners and are still smooth and don't wobble at high speeds, so I would recommend caliber 2's. Also their 100 bucks on ebay instead of 70 bucks per truck for evolve and they will fit the hobbyking mount way better.

thanks for the advice man, i've already got the HK vesc and i did order caliber 2's but need to order again from somewhere else as the vendor is a joke.

can anyone chime in on batteries i'm pretty confused, when they shipped from HK it says theyre at 30% and to recharge asap. but i've checked them all and they're all around the correct total voltage for the pack, shouldnt the voltage be less if they're at 30%?

A lot of what you would have learnt about batteries on this forum will kind of contradict what you will be doing as almost everyone uses 18650 lion but you are using lipos and I have used lipos on all three of my board and because they are different chemistry there are indeed different in capabilities and how you use them.

-Voltage meter


**Still on it's way** 

- Risers and longer deck hardware. 
- ABS Plastic for enclosure
- Bullet connectors 
- JST Connectors
- XT-90s
- USB for Vesc 


Need to buy: Fuses

Also, just a side note, since your using lipos when you configure your VESC settings in the VESC tool by default the voltage cutoff will be 31 volts for lion make sure to make that 35v hard cut off and 37v start, as I didn't do this in the past and this will quickly damage your batteries causing all sorts of problems that have given me headaches such as puffed cells, dead cells, the battery going out of balance preventing charging and so on.

Hi All, 

I finally have the time/motivation to finish this!

I've done some more reading and found the sound it makes  is normal but it fails and says sensor detection failed (this is a sensorless motor) if I do the straight BLDC test it spins about an inch and then has an error in the right hand corner saying bad detection result recieved

If anyone knows what I'm doing wrong assistance would be greatly appreciated.

When trying to control the motor via keyboard it moves slightly and the vESC blinks red, i think something is wrong with the hardware?
