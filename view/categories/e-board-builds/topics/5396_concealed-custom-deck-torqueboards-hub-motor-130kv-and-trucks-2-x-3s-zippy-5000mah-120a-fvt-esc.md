I am helping a friend with a build because he loves long boarding and wants to have an e-board, but struggles with managing electronics. I already went through the process of deciding on what to buy with him, but as always there's room for improvement. Here's the current parts list:

Controller (60$):
diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-2-4ghz-nano-remote-controller/

ESC (69.98$):
https://www.amazon.com/Hobbywing-WP-SC8-Waterproof-Brushless-Controller/dp/B008N5EXKC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1466808501&sr=8-4&keywords=120A+esc

Charger (51.34$):
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ND7J38C/ref=sr_ph_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1466809083&sr=sr-1&keywords=imax+charger

Batteries (25$ x 2):
http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=8579 

Charging Adapter (9.99$):
http://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/ez

Xt60 Battery Harness (9.80$):
https://www.amazon.com/Connection-Connector-Extension-Helicopter-Quadcopter/dp/B017W1DM18/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1467137094&sr=8-2-fkmr1&keywords=XT60+2S+Battery+Harness+For+2Packs+In+Series

Carvon Single In-Wheel Motor Kit (299$):
http://www.carvonskates.com/store/p4/CarvON_V2_Single_Hub_Motor__%C2%A0Front_Truck___Wheels_Set.html 

Planning to make a custom deck thick enough to house part of the electronics, and then a slim case out of wood that matches the board. We already have wood for that. (Most likely will go with design similar to that of beercanboards, so cutaways for the wheels and a handle carved on both sides). Overall goal is to make the e-board look like as much like a normal board as possible.

Total: 
550.11$ (Without tax/shipping)

We haven't ordered anything yet, so any suggestions for improvement are welcome. He would like to hopefully keep ending cost below 625$ if possible. I will update this topic as progress goes on, first pictures will likely be of the deck.

You could save a little $$$ by going with a GT2B for the controller. Usually under $30shipped. That cuts your controller budget in half. I'd suggest putting a little more $$$ into the battery budget. IMO

The batteries will probably only give you about 5 mile range and that will be used up pretty quick.
You would do better to spend a little more, get 2 6s/5000 batteries and run them in parallel.
Check all the 6s batteries on Hobby King. They have some killer sales at times.
I bought some Zippy Compacts 6s/5000 for only $26 ea.
Also when shopping on Hobby King. Bring up the page with the item you want and just sit there for a while. After a little time, they will pop up a discount offer. They almost always do.
Before ordering anything on Hobby King, create a user account and log in. you'll get better offers and it will be easier to track your orders.

That esc says "2-4s" on it. Looks like you are going make a 6s battery in series. Don't know how firm a cut off that is for voltage.

This is a good tip. I usually pop up the item and then go do something on another tab. I circle back to it later and get the discount.

I got impatient waiting for the discount to pop up, so I found a site that just does it :slight_smile:
Try [rcsearch.info](http://rcsearch.info/hobbyking/buddy/) and search for the item you want. They have quick links that show each discount available for each item, no more waiting around :smile:

Just make sure you select the warehouse that you want, cause the prices can be different for each one.

Last night my friend ordered everything else needed for the electronics. We ended up changing the Carvon kit to @torqueboards new single hub kit because it was cheaper and I had a good experience with the motor mount kit in the past. Also, included in what he ordered was the VGA charging adapter from Miamielectricboards (@oriol360). I watched the video about how to set it up and was wondering, would it really be safe to charge through a parallel port if the energy while charging can go to the ESC as well? I'm having trouble describing it, the video is on miamiboards website if my words aren't clear. I was thinking of maybe buying a toggle switch that could change the circuit from running mode to charging mode so that no power could go to the ESC while charging. Any thoughts? Would it be safe to just use a parallel adapter for charging like in the video? (Charging will be at 5 amps)

Ordered the last item that I forgot to mention a few days ago, the 2 X 3s to 6s charging adapter. 
Looks like this:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f5e4340c7472e90c99886c8b310d5b9b2f3014c6.png" width="281" height="500">

Last time I used one of these several people said to cut the red wire in the middle, several told me not to. I didn't, and it worked for about 2 weeks before I plugged it in one night and my batteries started smoking. I ended up having to replace one of them. The only reason I'm using one of these adapters again is because my friend really wants in-board charging and this is the easiest way to do it (without a BMS). With that being said, I don't want to ruin batteries that he just spent 50$ on. SO:
1) SHOULD I or SHOULD I NOT cut the inner red wire
1.5) IF YES, can someone offer a scientific explanation as to WHY?
Thanks :slight_smile:

As long s you connect them properly you shouldn't need to cut anything first determine wich s3 is going to be your positive and wich s3 your negative once you determined this the proceed to connect your positive balance lead to your adapter and younshould use the one that gas the red cble on the outside (last cable being red) and the opposite for your negative

@Pablo_702 Don't the little connectors have a small clip that makes it impossible to plug in the wrong way? That's the way it's been for me in the past...

To be safe, remove the red wire...
The one time I did not remove the wire the adapter sparked and also caused my imax charger to start smoking.
I've removed the red wire on all builds since then and everything had worked perfectly each time.

Follow this diagram exactly!

Progress has been made! Parts are arriving daily now, in fact everything is here except the hub motor. No pictures yet because my friends phone is crappy as hell, but hopefully I'll be over at his house soon to see everything for myself. Just curious @torqueboards about when do you think the motor will arrive if we ordered first week of July?

@anorak234 - Not sure which order is yours :) PM me.. I assume your referring to the hub motors though!

They are on their way in route. I hope to receive them this week if not at the latest early next week.

I already got the 90mm hub wheels in progress but it will take some time to get them made.

UPDATE: 
Everything has arrived (Except for the hub motor from @torqueboards, hopefully that will be here within a week)! My friend texted me a picture of everything layed out, it all looks great(picture was too big to upload)

Suprisingly, both of the batteries are perfectly balanced! Quite different from mine... Anyways he hooked up his electronics and one battery with my motor and we did a 3s bench test. I'll put a video on YouTube so I can post it later, but his face was unforgettable :laughing:

Edit:

UPDATE:
We used an older sector 9 deck for test runs, also put up a TB hub motor review topic, I'll be updating that in a bit.
The last week has been slightly frustrating, trying to keep positive
1) Wood that we usually use is out of stock, and we waited too long to get it for this deck. That'll be a little while to restock.
2) Ran into multiple problems with size of the enclosure that we want vs size of my oven for vacuum forming, so now I'll be building another contraption using either heat guns or electric burners.
3) hub motor is having difficulties, sometimes it'll work sometimes it won't. Also, my friend sent me a video in which the motor makes a disturbing grinding sound - not good. We don't know how this happened, every part only has about 8-9 miles of use. 
Hoping to figure this all out :confused:

Finally making progress on this thing again. Got the hub motor fixed, loose magnets so epoxy fixed it right up. Deck is still a work in progress as well as the enclosure. Got most things soldered up, voltage meter is getting figured out as I post this and batteries are the only things not yet converted to xt60. Here are a few pictures to sum up the work. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/f/4fb02ecda2f95ed0ea52235668a57fc5eade351b.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/5/c547399a8a55775ccdb8e7097c3b89e3ecc0178d.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/0/d008971d220e92927632d3ed2f3cbfdaf3ba6473.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/3/132540f93ad1bd3ee2acb996268a5fad9f564870.JPG" width="375" height="500">

Made some more progress, got the entire electronics system finished. Got tired of the duct tape setup and moved everything to an old skateboard I had laying around. It looks pretty bad, but works exactly like it is supposed to. I also took the liberty of adding a voltage meter with an on/off switch since the system is now upgraded to 6s. It's not anti-spark, but I am pretty proud of it.

Nice work man!  Have you looked at moving the wheels/trucks out onto the angled/kicks of your current deck?  I think a few folks did this a while back and it looked really good.  Lower, and likely more carve/turn from the additional angle, and definitely a bit more stable from the longer WB!

not a double kick really, but i did similar for a buddies build:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/e-sk8-gift-for-best-bud-how-would-you-setup-a-friends-board/6350

Here's one i saw forever ago on instructables:
http://www.instructables.com/id/Electric-Skateboard-v20/
(maybe the builder is on here and can comment?)

What are you going to use for an enclosure for your batteries and electronics?

GL!

Thanks for the suggestions, I have thought about using the lips of the deck but the idea is still a grey area. The enclosure will likely be made out ABS or wood. Also FYI I believe the person who made that Instructable was @VladPomogaev

Aaaaand finished. Didn't really like the turning radius of a skateboard deck, even with risers. So we built a new deck:

That looks fantastic! I'm envious!  

Just curious, I noticed that the drive wheel is a different color. Is this due to the epoxy on the hub motor? In general, if you were to do this again, do you think you'd pick the same hubs?

```
@faust for this build I got the 83mm torqueboards hub motor. It works well, but this is after about a month of troubleshooting to find out that one of the magnets was out of place due to minimal glue inside the motor itself. The discoloration is due to the urethane of the wheel, which is harder than that of the other wheels. If I were to buy a hub motor from torqueboards again it would be a black 90mm option to avoid the same discoloration
```
