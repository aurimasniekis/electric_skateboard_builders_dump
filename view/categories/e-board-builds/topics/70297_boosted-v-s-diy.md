I just finished designing my board. My only dilemma is that I don't know if It is a good choice. I rode my friends boosted gen 2+ and it was fun, but it just seemed a little slow and frankly, 14 miles doesn't seem too far. I built my own that would go faster and further (check link). I'm mainly using this as a commuter around campus, so in that aspect, a boosted would be better (I'm looking at the boosted stealth). My diy would be a lot more fun! On my campus, there are some crappy roads and brick sidewalks, but mainly I would be on smooth roads. Almost nothing I build is going to compare to the comfort and reliability of boosted. Which one should I choose?

I hear that a diy's throttle is going to be a lot more jerky. Also, I have a stiff deck, so I'll feel a lot more bumps. Its ~2.25 miles to my classes and another 2.25 back. I also may want to bum around and go other places in the day. I go to school in VA where there are a lot of hills.

Hey man, looks like you did some research. If you are riding a boosted on hills the range is going to be petty shit. A diy board could be super comfortable if you design it that way. You could make a boosted clone using the loaded vanguard and an upgraded battery. That will give you the same comfort as boosted with like double the range. As for the jerkiness, you can program your esc to have less of a startup boost if you want. I would definitely go diy

It depends on how good you are with diy. You can build one exactly the way you like it. It could look like a BB and ride like a BB, but faster and more range. 
There are boosted clone builds here. You can search them and get some ideas. But it would definitely not be cheaper. And addicting so you would end up building more.

The boosted clone I build was way faster, had 2.5 tones the range, had a lot of torque, was way more comfortable and had an extremely smooth remote it even costed a little less, the main benefit is the in-house immediate repair/maintenance service you will have as when you build it you become the service guy

If you think 14 mile is not enough range but you want around campus usage, you might as well have two boards. 

I think around campus boards needs to be a small one to take in Iâ€™m and out of buildings easier.

Although that would be absolutely awesome, I wouldn't be able to afford 2 of them. I'm trying to design a better boosted, but It is hard to keep the $$$ down.

If you are not sure what you are doing. DIY will likely cost more down the line. You will need tools that you might now have. Visit the hardware store many more times than expected and repair/replace this and that along the way. 

Have you checked the longer range Boosted Mini?

The boosted mini is too slow. I have done countless hours of research on the DIY boards. I do believe I know what I'm doing. Right now, I'm trying to design a boosted with dual 10s1p battery packs and dual 6355 motors.

1P lipo? Because if you use 18650s you will not get much power out of that pack.

10s1p on dual 6355 gets you roughly 6 miles. Especially if you like to go fast.

You will need to run lipos because 10s1p on 18650 will not give you enough discharge rating to run 6355 motors.

The Mini X has the same hardware as all other more expensive ones. Basically they're selling us DLC to unlock additional speed modes...

Use 3x 4s Zippy lipos with @Eboosted enclosures, canâ€™t go wrong there

@TheRafter
Bro just grab this and a board of your choice and done. About the same price as boosted

A used boosted is a hard proposition to beat at around 500 dollars. Not many people are able to build a higher performance board without spending closer to 1000, especially on their first build. All the little things, screws, tools, wire etc etc really add up. And inevitably a diy board is not going to be as polished a product. The only time I think diy really makes sense is if you really genuinely want the extra performance, as there's not much in the mass manufactured world that will give you that.

My apologies, their 10s2p meaning when I hook 2 of them parallel, I'll get 10s4p.

I would, but that doesn't work with the vanguard deck. I'm trying to build a boosted alternative, but the battery pack would just break right in half.

Thatâ€™s true. Another alternative would to use eboosted split enclosure and a 10s4p liion pack. It would be pricy, but worth it

Does anyone here actually use a boosted with the extended range battery?

My question is: is it really enough? I feel like I would run out of battery pretty quick, but I guess I'm not too sure how far 14 miles really is. To me, it seems like that wouldn't last too long.

Boosted advertises 14 miles on their battery when the board is in economy mode.  I heard that its only about 6 miles in the highest mode.

Zombie thread resurrection I have a refurb boosted v2 + on the way, and before I break into it, I'm trying to determine whether or not it would be a good idea to sell it, and pony up for DIY similar to the Skate Metric Foosted build.  I build decks and already have trucks as well as wheels, so my question is, can i do it for the cost.  This is my first build, but I want more.  I know I'll be used to the v2 within a day or two, and the range just isn't what I'm after.  I'd love to see 10 miles at 25mph, but I still don't know if that is doable for under 1k.  (Trucks, and deck are covered already).

Why you donâ€™t just stack up the boosted.
Change the battery against a diy and the controller to focboxes or any of the dual Flipsky ones?
I think for 1k that should be possible for sure.

I have designed quite a few different DIY boards. There definitely is an appeal to the boosted boards because of their reliability. To build a DIY boosted, like skate metric, you should be able to make one for a little cheaper. My main goal is speed and range. If you use dial 6355 motors with the Torque vescs and a battery from meepo or something similar, you should be able to do it. I have linked a few of my board part lists, but I go more for range and distance and some of them are incomplete. Especially if you already have a vanguard type deck, that'll save you some money. The Focbox vescs are much better, but also 30$ more per. Just search around some threads, and I'm sure you'll find something great. You can even get cheap motors on Flipsky or amazon for 60-70$ with more than enough power, but unlike TB motors, they are not nearly as reliable. Good luck!

While that would be possible, it is both sketchy and difficult to modify a boosted board. They are designed for their parts and would take quite a bit of modification to fit different vescs and batteries. If he has enough talent,  by all means he should go for it. It would just be easier and probably more reliable to make your own.

I donâ€™t think so. Donâ€™t get it wrong, but the way I thought about is,
Use only the deck, trucks, wheels motors and wires from the boosted.
Change the enclosures to the ones from @Eboosted and fill them up with diy electronics.
So basically just take off the boosted stuff and solder new connectors to the power lines and phase wires. Thatâ€™s all.

That is very true. I thought you meant to just swap out a few part. That is a great idea, but it'll also be a little pricy because you are buying many of the parts + the boosted.

I thought he already has or get a boosted + 1k to build. If itâ€™s only one of both itâ€™s sure not possible.
For the rebuild of the boosted he would need as min 
120$ for enclosures 
250$ (or more depending on size) for battery 
25$ for charge only bms
250-300$ for focbox/vesc 
20-50$ for a remote 
+50-80$ for additional stuff like cables, plugs, fuses, tape, silicon, Bluetooth module etc.
+ shipping of all the stuff on top

So 750$ min i think

The intention is to sell the boosted right when I get it (since I got a good price from a trade in of my broken v1, then parley that money (maybe about 1000 here in Utah).  Then figure out what it would cost me to build my own from scratch, (building my own deck and supplying trucks.  I'd need everything other than that from the get go.  

I talked to Longhairedboy about it and with his standards of quality ect, he's guessing somewhere around the $1200 range.  One thing I wouldn't want to skimp on would be control system.  I'm used to the boosted controls, which almost always match inputs with little lag. 

If there are ways to crank the boosted motors up and get bigger batteries, that would be good, but I might want to rock it at least for the 6 month warranty period. IF I do decide to boost my boosted, (I haven't seen many people doing that) then objectives would be to get more acceleration, more top speed, and more range.
