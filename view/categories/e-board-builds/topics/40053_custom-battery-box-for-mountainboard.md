My Trampa Mountainboard came with a Carbon Fiber box, but missing screws and spacers for them, so I decided to mod one up until I get screws and spacers. 

Found this box with the right dimensions to fit 4 6s 6200mah lipos, with a Lil extra space. So far I ripped out the rubber stands that were underneath the box and replaced it with rivets. Then drilled 3 matching holes to fit on the board.

Next I will drill a couple of more holes for the wires to run through. It's an easy box to mod. I might consider adding a battery meter and a anti-spark power button.

Welcome every morning with a smile. Look on the new day as another special gift from your Creator, another golden opportunity to complete what you were unable to finish yesterday. Be a self-starter. Let your first hour set the theme of success and positive action that is certain to echo through your entire day. Today will never happen again. Don’t waste it with a false start or no start at all. You were not born to fail.

All right Anthony Robbins....I think it might be time to slow down in the single malt.

This post needed a approval because @Tyoo is brand new to the forum. Most of the time newbies posts consist of them begging people for answers which have been answered many times before but this guy went a different route. It was so positive that I didn’t have it in me to deny it.

Don’t get me wrong it’s still totally off topic, but fuck it he’s right guys

Very nice board man but this box...... hmmm the trampa box will look much better :wink:
Do you plan to have the power leads underneath the deck? I wouldn't do that, that could be dangerous. It's safer to route them across the bindings.
