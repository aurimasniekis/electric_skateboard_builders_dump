Never ever go cheap on vescs. You will end up replacing the controllers (just browse the forum to get an idea...) at some point and you won’t save money.

Yes "cheaper" but no sacrifices are made on quality

Better value :slight_smile:

Lets say that before @b264 starts having a go at you :grin:

LoLz.  ESCape HW6 aren't cheap, but they aren't *ridiculously overpriced* like VESC6 HW6 are.  They are basically the same thing.

First of all your nickname makes me laugh really hard  :laughing:

The cheapest build has quality parts which you don't have to replace, that's why it's cheaper
As others mentioned don't buy cheap vescs otherwise it's getting really expensive in the end.
I would suggest starting with 1x sensored 6374 (e.g.APS) motor (so you don't have to push the board first) and if you have some time to wait for an ESCape, this would be the best choice, and 15mm pulleys and belts.

This should give you some nice power, but if you want more power you can upgrade anytime with the same parts to go dual and without loosing any money.
