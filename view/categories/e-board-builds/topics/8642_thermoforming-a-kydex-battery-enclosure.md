I recently made a battery enclosure for my eskate out of Kydex.  I made a buck from wood to represent the shape I wanted at the end then used 0.080 inch thick Kydex, heated it and pressed it over the buck.

Here is the first video about making the buck.  I will be posting the rest of the series shortly.

I also plan on making an enclosure for my VESC in the next few weeks.  I could potentially make these to sell if there is interest.  The Kydex is much stronger than a standard ABS enclosure.

I just posted the next part that includes molding the plastic over the buck. Check it out:

The next part will be installing the mounting hardware. I will have that posted soon.

Yes, but I wanted it formed to the curvature of the deck so I either need to cut a deck up, build a mold of one, or make an enormous vacuum table. I will experiment more in the future.

Nice video. A vacuum would work better,  I believe you can use the heat gun to mold it to the deck after forming.

Slowly increase the temperature and check it with an IR thermometer if you have one so it heats evenly. Rotate it every so often. I went up to 340*F on the 0.080.

Looks great. Do you think you could've formed the enclosure with just a hot air gun ?  Probably would take a lot longer but it looked like you were getting some good results when you hit it with the hot air gun after taking the foam off.

It is probably possible, but the material likes to be heated slowly and evenly when possible.  Also doing it with the heat gun was very time consuming compared to the part in the press.  I got some different foam to try on the ESC box I will be making soon.

This looks like a great way to make an enclosure! where did you buy the kydex? I think I'm going to try this with a few changes.

I'll make mine with one solid piece of kydex and I wanna put rubber or something between the kydex and the board to prevent water from getting in.

Shipping from their site costs a lot (23.3 Eur) + sheet itself is 18eur.. Plus, it is not 300x200, but 300x150mm

HI man great videos :+1:

i am going to use kydex for my build because of you! 

one quick question, I am going to go for one lager sized enclosure insted of two small ones, will that work? I am wondering because i never used the material before and don't know how well it can flex.

It should work fine. The advatage of doing two enclosures is that if you have some kind of issue with your batteries, your esc/vesc will be protected to an extent. It can also help if you have a flexible board since you can put the two enclosures on opposite ends, thus avoiding the middle where the board bends the most. @m4almbergs

This is what i ended up with. My kydex is 0.125 and it was really hard to mold it. I had to put it back into the oven 3 times in order to achieve good results. But this enclosure is bulet proof bc of the thickness of the kydex. I can stand on it.

Well I know that but it's easier to drill when it's flat. I used a drawer organizer (plastic) for the longest time on my board and I just used an old soldering iron that had a blunt tip as my way to make holes. That's what I'm asking.

I've done a couple, never really happy with the result.  But I used a form, heat gun, gloves and some conduit to get the edges right. 

The problem is you have to find the point where it's soft enough to shape but not apply too much heat or it's gets flat and deformed looking. 

Vacuum forming with ABS gives a much better result.  The problem there is if you want a 20in single piece enclosure you need a 24in table.  To get a 2 piece 20in enclosure you need at a minimum a 12in table but really 14in is better. 

Been thinking about paying someone to make some.pretty elaborate forms I've drawn so I can make my own enclosures.  Prolly cost @psychotiller all of his beer money if I did though üòÄ.

I made this mold from cardboard boxes and tape, kinda like yours in the video. It helped forming the shape I wanted but I still had problems with the wrinkles. Tried my best to smooth it out with heat gun. I have 1 sheet of kydex left and I'm saving that for a good day lol.
First attempt looks okay except for the wrinkles. You need something to hold down the kydex on your mold as it cools down.

Pretty much anything that is convex.  There are some considerations that need to be taken into account so there is not a lot of extra material.  You can see in some of the posts on here how people have wrinkles around the edge and that is mainly due to the enclosure shape.  If you look at the shape of my enclosures I tried to not have a lot of very tall and sides with 90* angles.  If you can add tapers and other geometry it forms better and also looks pleasing to the eye.

Might need to use a thinner material for a deck with flex.  That looks like 4 enclosures close together, but not sure how the cabling is routed between them.  I usually start with the batteries and deck then go from there to shape and place the enclosure.  Anything is possible.

Yeah I was considering that. The Kaly.nyc enclosure is a one piece. However I'm looking to make this out of 4 pieces of kydex. Cabling/balance wires will be joint by flexible hosing that connects between all 4 pieces.

Just started forming my enclosure.  .093 kydex is thick.  Minus the ripples I'll remove with the heat gun I think it's going to work well.  The 12x24 piece I have for the battery box doesn't fit in the oven unless you bend it in.  So that's going to be interesting when it gets soft...

Interesting. I bought 8 12"x12" sheets of the same thickness (i believe), but planned on using a piece of wood as the buck (correct term?) What type of foam is that? Is it dense and bouncy or more like Styrofoam?

This is awesome! I did a similar process for my [Rouge Rogue](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/rouge-rogue-custom-baltic-birch-deck-paris-trucks-turnigy-sk3-6s1p-ebay-motor-mount-hobbyking-x-car-beast-120a-esc-pepakura-case/23864), but it was basically vacuum-forming polypropylene over a plaster cast from a Pepakura paper model. Polypropylene is really hard to paint though. :grin: Check out my video on [my write-up](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/rouge-rogue-custom-baltic-birch-deck-paris-trucks-turnigy-sk3-6s1p-ebay-motor-mount-hobbyking-x-car-beast-120a-esc-pepakura-case/23864) to see the whole (over-complicated) process.

Thanks for the compliments. Like I said it's actually polypropylene and took way too long, but I like how it turned out.

After reading this thread I decided to use kydex vacuum box to do a diy boosted board.   I used a grill to heat the kydex to about 380f.  The problem is it's had to regulate the temp and heat the kydex evenly.   ![20180224_110044|374x500](upload://1EocAne37tNpvILWZ8ywWl5Zhq9.jpg)![20180224_110247|374x500](upload://6BmHAJpEK2kmvB1LhrwqCEVjA44.jpg)![20180310_165802|375x500](upload://cMOWAFOvHZt1X8isf7r6eBtH7qy.jpg)![20180310_165822|374x500](upload://u454wQkCLJc1N43TX2BunDUN9dZ.jpg)![20180310_182700|666x500](upload://6Nhq7qfBbxGfy0MN6oTId27YDXN.jpg)![20180310_182706|666x500](upload://l0HGsNgzNqBxBu8AK8rh6O59Woe.jpg)![20180307_150255|666x500](upload://jvnNSXsVAfJHOFDB6mit4w9gPH.jpg)

That look really good... The oven is nice cuz you can put it on the top shelf on like another piece of cardboard ....but bigger pieces may not fit... Then it softens nice and even...on a grill the heat source is too close... But I moght recommend using a.catering sterno in a bbq...of to the side and you cpuld get good oven heat in a tight space

My kitchen is too far away.   And I don't want to mess up the oven just In case I burn the kydex.    I use some aluminum foil to line and create a pan around the kydex to try to heat the kydex enenly.   Took me 4 trys to get it right.  After installing the enclosures I use a heat gun to mold the enclosure to the skateboaed.  That creates a perfect fit.

I used the oven....  Even the 24" piece I mashed in there got soft and worked.  The kydex I used was .093". Way to thick for this stuff.  Doubt it will break though.![IMG_4568|375x500](upload://utFnal0OOE2ubxTNYKxvQBMhCDh.JPG)![IMG_4579|374x500](upload://bBZw0fVl8aUp8OXdDnkIJujOb5a.JPG)![IMG_4567|375x500](upload://kGYQKQe77I8kL4pHjpLe3LjTWiK.JPG)![IMG_4584|374x500](upload://sOTTHyX7Q4Fwpwvz4CbOKXy28nS.JPG)![IMG_4569|375x500](upload://j9stAVK3u7Lw7hbzHJuIXD285Nv.JPG)

I attempted to make a enclosure without a vacuum box before and it was too hard to mold the hot kydex.   Building the vacuum box is really simple.

I should have done so. I spent plenty of time with the heat gun adjusting it.

The time spent working the kydex freehand is almost the same as building the box.   Once the box is build it could be use for future projects.  The material cost of the box is like  less then $10.

Reading stealth71 and watching his video got me thinking about kydex.  But after many failed attempts to freehand mold the kydex I decided to look in to vacuum forming.  I watched many kydex gun host forming videos and decided to build my own.  So no one inspiration but a collection of ppl here inspired me.

What kind of seal should I use? I feel like Kydex will by easier than 3D printing a bunch of enclosures, but i need to know how to make them at least somewhat water proof.

Depend where you are located but in EU for short board Unik does have  spud enclosure for cheap and it is really nice. https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/boitier-batterie-abs/
Since you asked in inch then in USA you have @psychotiller and @Eboosted who makes nice enclosure! Have a look...
