Here it goes, my little cruiser on steroids. 12S2P with AKASHA wheels. 

Enjoy!

Sweet board. Like the case, very slick.

Is the carbon a shell around the 3d printed case and it stuck on or two loose pieces?

Perfect combination of carbon and 3D printed parts!

I love your spacers with embedded wiring and connectors.

Are you fine with this lonely cap? I'm getting better reliability and less heat with smaller but more caps -> less ESR...

I love the carbon fiber reinforced 3d printed enclosure. Great idea!

The build looks amazing.  Very clean.  One thing though.... do yourself a favor and replace those Khiro bushings! There so many better options

thanks mate; 12S2P will give me some great power on efficiency. Really for Khiro's ? I tried a lot of them and I like the orange cone one; On all my Calibers, I change the cup for a riptide one; and change the 90A bushing for a Venom barrel and khiro cone; it's the best feeling I found on the road at this time to mix these two.

I still need to remove the yellow barrel which is rubbish and put the usual setup : Venom Barrel/Khiro Cone - the riptide cup is already installed
