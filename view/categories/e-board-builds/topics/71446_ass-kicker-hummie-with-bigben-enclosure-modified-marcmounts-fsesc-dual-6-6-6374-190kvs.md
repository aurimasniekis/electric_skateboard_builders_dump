Ok, here‚Äôs my first post on this, my third build... my first 2 builds were one wheel drive labours of love, I made the decks using roarockit vac bagging made abs enclosure and battery and ran them on 90mm urethane......the ride was not smooth enough for these parts. 

Hummie carbon and wood deck
@bigben enclosure (low profile)
Dual FSesc 6.6
Metr pro
6374 streetwing 190kvs
12s4p Samsung 30q with bestech bypass bms
Mini remote
@Kug3lis 150A Fatboy anti spark 
Cheap ass 6‚Äù x 2‚Äù AliExpress AT wheels 

Ok, so far I‚Äôve built the battery, routed out the deck another 15mm for width. Screwed up sanding a poorly adhered top coat üôÅ given it 3 coats of PU varnish üôÇ, made some aluminium truck toppers (one with the charge socket and anti spark push button).

I‚Äôve also made acetal adapters for the cheap ass wheels to vex robotics pulleys .. https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/cheap-ass-6x2-pneumatic-belt-setup-3d-printed-pulley-vex-versa-pulley-files-available/65559/156?u=amazingdave

My gearing is 1:4 (15 tooth to 60 tooth) 

And I‚Äôve adapted a pair of older style Marc mounts by adding cross bracing.....

On a side note, when I gently lifted the battery to put Velcro under it I pulled the aerial wire out of the pcb plug on my Metr Pro.... shitballs.

Right. All done! 

First ride this morning in the dark to the train station... very powerful, tons of torque... the cheap ass wheels are brilliant, what an upgrade from 90mm thanes!

I really love this board üíñ.

I have no Metr Pro data yet... see lessons learned below. 

So...
Lessons learned.

Be bloody careful with Metr Pro aerial wire... üôÅ
Be ridiculously careful sanding a top coat off thin carbon fibre...üôÅ

@Hummie your deck is awesome 
@bigben has built on the awesome to take it to unbelievable levels....

The only minor change I‚Äôd make to the enclosure is to make the wire cover deeper... I used more layers of neoprene gasket to give me the depth I wanted, which works well.

Images to follow...

Just a quick update... replaced the broken cable on my metr pro, working like a charm. 

Not topped out on speed yet but must be fairly close, 32mph. 

Plus I really don‚Äôt like the way the idler bearings mount on these marcmounts, plastic isn‚Äôt up to it in my opinion. So I‚Äôve turned top hat bearing carriers and replaced the bearings with stainless bearings...

Oh and the bushings I‚Äôm running are a bit tight... I‚Äôve got 2 magnum 90a Krank on the back and 1 chubby aps 90A boardside at the front with a stock cone roadside. It is as solid as a rock for speed but I like a bit more carviness. New bushings en-route...

I agree with you on the idlers, I rode mine hard enough to break them....twice üòÇüòÇ

Gotta do something to strengthen them up...

I‚Äôm loving taking this board off the beaten track... the enclosure is keeping the water out on muddy trails and the performance off road is surprisingly good... the only thing that was concerning me was the pelting that the front seal was getting through puddles and wet grass. 

So here we have bodgy kydex clip on mudguard mark I

They are reduced on sickboards already. Hoping it goes down more. 

You'd need a 80mm shoulder bolt and some 10mm ID bearings with it.

The 10mm ID bearings are the minor issue with these wheels, can‚Äôt find a 24mm OD 10mm ID bearing... might have to turn out the bearing seats to 26mm.

I haven‚Äôt done a full pack yet to know total distance but I‚Äôve done many 5-10km runs and the watt hours per mile I‚Äôve recorded depending on whether I‚Äôve been blasting along a flat sea front at full speed and acceleration (31Wh/mile) or along a muddy canal towpath at 15-20kph (24Wh/mile) lead me to expect 15 solid miles plus more if I‚Äôm light on the acceleration and top speed. This board is so steady at 30mph that it‚Äôs difficult to resist the throttle though!

Nice one! Could you walk me through how to mount the charge port on the truck? Which parts used and maybe some up close pictures for inspiration? Thank you!
