I've been asked a ton of times to post a build thread for this one. I've had some growing pains (battery took a huge dump while I was in Cali, mount issues, ect...) with this build. But it's finally hauling me down the road after a couple hundred miles. So here it is boyz... 

This build was inherently named by @DerelictRobot. I feel I owe it to him as he would have to pull over a million times every other mile or so and wait for me to pluck those fuckers out of my belts. He also put in a lot of work to help me get this thing going after having some pretty major issues.

Thanks dude. I saw this board last year being given away in the secret santa thread or somewhere and I fell in love with it's shape and stature. I literally had to "make" things work in order to fit everything. I love it so far.

From the title I expected this to be the most ghetto looking budget board ever seen :smile:

Was pleasantly surprised! May I ask why you went with 2 6380s? :stuck_out_tongue:

Did you ride up a mountain or something? That is a crazy energy consumption especially with PU wheels.:open_mouth:
