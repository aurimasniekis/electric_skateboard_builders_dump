Hi guys, 
After many hours of research, I have picked out my parts. I have already ordered some parts, but I just needed some feedback on a few final parts. Don't mind the different connectors, I bought like 10 pairs of xt60s and a xt90 antispark pair. Any feedback will help! Thanks!

What sized wheel pulley will you be using because a 20t motor pulley might be a bit big. Most people use a 15-16t pulley so the gear ratio is around 2.2-2.4. Other wise it should work fine although just make sure to put a heat sink on the esc

No problem. If you are using the lower kv motor like 149 it should be ok. I actually run my board on a 2:1 ratio with 190kv but I'm really light and there is no hills here

Those calibers are not II's. Turnigy motor mount only works on square trucks. Unless you want to modify your trucks, don't buy it. 3d printed might work in beginning but it will ware down from vibrations.
