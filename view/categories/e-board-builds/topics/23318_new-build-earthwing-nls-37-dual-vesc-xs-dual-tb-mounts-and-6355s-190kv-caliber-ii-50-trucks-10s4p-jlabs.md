Have you ordered that deck yet? I have a new NLS 37 sitting in the corner, looking for a home...

Awesome deck. I just have too many boards and never set it up

Change of plans...got all the parts layed out and with the 10s4p and dual vesc-Xs it's just too tight on this deck for my liking so I'll save deck for another build....new deck is a Madrid yeti....my brother wants a sorta traditional deck....I think this one will work nice...<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/f/ff1723b56b698fd5fc5dc840783882e9cd15aec5.png" width="500" height="500">
