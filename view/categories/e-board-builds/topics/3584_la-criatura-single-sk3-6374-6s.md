hello everyone my name is Diego and this will be my first E build. Just got in the mail today a turnigy sk3 6374 190kv motor   from hobby king. I have a skateboard my wife bough me on vacation last year but i will be getting new truks for it. For now thats about it, i still have a ton of parts to order. I like the enertion set up for the pulleys, i like that the wheel pulley has its own baring and takes the weight off of the wheel, but i really haven't fully decided if to go with enertion or torqueboards set up.
