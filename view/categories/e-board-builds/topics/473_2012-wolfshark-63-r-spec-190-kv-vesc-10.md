Just found a sweet deal on a pristine 2012 wolfshark. Loving the shape and fantastic paint job.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/1X/f0b5d158896adeb8f4b524af268abef8048069b3.jpg" width="370" height="500">

It looks like the speed racer car the mock one.

Just threw some trucks on this beast and rode a couple klicks, holy he'll... The w concave makes it feel like the board has bindings! and so many different positions and all comfortable! can't wait to build this bad boy up
