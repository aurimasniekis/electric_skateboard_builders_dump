Looks good! Just so you know, you can get a 150A Hobbyking ESC for 80 bucks that's pre programmed if you dont want to waste money on the programming card. Also, the same remote is 50$ at @psychotiller  website. Finally, if u stay on one page for about 10 minutes with Hobbyking for our batteries, they'll offer you the products cheaper. Total savings for same items and a higher amp ESC: ~23$

I was thinking of just asking around my town for a free give away, unless there is something you recommend for under $50. I dont care too much about the deck.

Do you have a charger for your Imax? You need some sort of enclosure unless you want to velcro it on like I did. I'll be doing a loop key like yours sometime this summer.

Thanks for the board recommendation, but it is just about a ripplily as a waves potato chipüòÇ, i cant tell if it is flat on the bottom but if it is that is fine. Im just worried about the parts laying flush.
Edit: I looked again and the bottom does look flat. This would make sense too. @Michaelinvegas you actually saved me $28 cause that board has free shipping!!

You _should_ care about the deck, it's the one thing that makes it all possible.  Ride comfort and feel is really important.  Have a look at Loaded boards, that's what the Boosted Board is based on... but there are so many out there, it all depends on your budget.  Look to spend a little more than $50, no more than $100 will get you a very good deck.

@RomR i got most of the expensive important stuff from diyelectricscateboard like the esc, mech kit, remote, and motor. I got the deck from eBay. The batteries, charger, and xt90's from hobbyking. And misc stuff like wires from amazon.

I live in the U.S. and chose these sellers because of their good U.S. shipping. Just make sure to select the closest region (U.S. East for me) for all your hobbyking purchases. All the stuff should come in under a week, but it varies from seller to seller. If you are concerned about shipping speed, make sure what you are buying is actually in stock. Use the live chat on to ask about specific item availability. My stuff hasn't come, i just ordered.
As for the ego, it is very difficult to upgrade and you will probably wish you could upgrade it because of its max speed of only 12.5mph and its inability to get up steep hills. I ended up spending $656 which is a little cheaper than the ego, and it would kill the ego on flat land and hills. Also I can upgrade the battery or add duel motors down the road.
