I'm finally upgrading mine to 2 motor. (now it will be twopunchboard) I order a avenue RKP just to try out but I figured out to put a motor mount on it. still prototyping...

Take a look
![20180410_215107|690x388](upload://4ssvuLYDEDxEkR134vTh10QosY5.jpg)![20180410_220934|690x388](upload://oqtHJeou93DTOo4YKO4gL5SnKNN.jpg)![20180410_215325|690x388](upload://aydcO9XlLMYpp5F4Eks8T4iwNCf.jpg)

I made flat spot to hold the mount, obviously there is large gap btween mount and truck, but I figure if i put random scrap metal and jb weld it will hold. i did this in previously and u need sledge hammer to take it out.

Anyways, avenue rkp hanger is super light weight, I thought it was some kind of plastic at first tho...
and bushing sit is tight at the base and open at road side.
seems promising for free rider like I am

I would try having it welded into place once its in the right spot

That looks great!  I've been wanting to see how Avenue trucks perform in Esk8 since I first saw them! :smile:

im using tkp ver. of it. they are great. they really take stress out of ur knee. 
riding is superb. they glide like a butter on hot pan.
down side is they are expensive for the quality.
I think RKP is better quality

yeap right now im putting them together and see if the mount holds in rough condition. as long as it doent move side by side it sould be good.

That hanger is made from magnesium and the designer told me it wouldn't handle holding a mount and I shouldn't try. But I'm curious how long it lasts, so do it dude and keep us posted..I have everything to try this myself..

yeap It is magnesium alloy. super light weight. they are soft for sure. 
Here is update:
so I put nuts in every small holes in addition to jbweld as a filler.

I've use different jbweld original but it is first time using pro grade. it is thicker and less brittle than syringe type. very promising.

She's all wired up!
but here in canada, it snowed so heavy untill monday, couldn't test yet.

right now I can tell the it grip like a gorila.
even if I lean so much that getting wheel bite, it does not lift other side of wheel. veryvery good![20180419_112300|281x500](upload://gtZrPrSGupg4AThCJZGZ3gq8KoP.jpg)

you should try put the rkp suspension baseplate on another trucks hanger like the torque boards 218mm trucks hanger. if that works then it would be ideal.

Cant hanger is very low, and king pin is much smaller so the other king pins wont fit. you have to custom made.

so i just ran solid 20 miles non stop. and it is bullet proof i hit a big blocks and hilled up 25% for 5min full and i think I hit 35+ mph. mount is solid no crack at all. 
actually the old tkp cracked and wablly now.

so this truck feels very smooth gripping crazy. surprizingly turnable. i can easy pass big pot holes as fast as i want.
only down side is the stock bushing is too soft.
and they gave me flat washer instead of cup.
can't wait to get second set for the back.

And why doesnt more people try this. it lits!

nice work

I gave up fiting a motor mount on the Avenues, the hanger geometry is too worse and others hangers don't fit their RKP-base-plate, that sucks.

I use the Avenue RKP for my front-wheels and the Avenue-Baseplate + Evolve hanger on the back, that's the best way of wide suspension setup for now.

So the evolve hanger fits their regular suspension baseplate perfectly?

Would you say the ride is way better than regular trucks or is it negligible ? Very interested to tryout a pair

The Evolve hanger fit the regular baseplate without modication, not perfectly but 98%, good enough

For suspension trucks in general, the difference is hard to tell, negligible on normal roads but they eat up hard bumps which is nice.
I like them, other people don't, depends...

Actually I saw your video before trying fitting avenue to esk8.

I saw the avenue ad and thought " there's gatta be a guy who tried" and saw ur video on youtube. haha

on my RKP, made some flat spot with file and some epoxy.

was much easier than tkp.

and actually the suspension makes board feel glide, so in a way it is scary when going fast. 
i get this feeling of ganna slip away even tho it is just board gliding. really weird feeling.

but the main reason i went this route is because I want to ride on side walk without hurting my knee.

so I calculated the distance today. it came out 36km for 360wh battery (36v 10ah lipo) dead on lol, it is with 1 yr old battery so U could get 5 to 10 percent more when brand new. it is damn efficient.

Update. Second set came today.
I decided to make it more precisely.
![20180509_184540|281x500](upload://wOxCmw4KOwQ1qxhbSDQSRpftcwm.jpg)
So first I flattens the truck a bit. it is soft enough to use filing. ![20180509_185242|690x388](upload://qmEgjYpdRSDTv7J7uRZc009BV8h.jpg)
![20180509_192126|690x388](upload://zRgZyKXI0xzuaAC12Hg23RMkG3J.jpg)
then I put motor on to see the space![20180509_195002|690x388](upload://ic84comDL2FpPthHPEC4SQFJkRZ.jpg)
I gave 1 cm btwn the motor and base plate. mount looks straight![20180509_195139|281x500](upload://z6mURMZiGdPN8kFu5LSaTqWCLzQ.jpg)
now I need to make space for C clip
![20180509_195536|281x500](upload://sqzYt8npGfanUa93rb0LEjzZ0e2.jpg)
used drumel to grind away the mount![20180509_202743|281x500](upload://2waCQ9LN3dQkPar0h4JwmNf9J6D.jpg)
my hand isn't steady and the drumel I have has terrible centering so it was a bit trial and error.
![20180509_204500|690x388](upload://yWT3YRph2AFPT8W6feLH41ow6ZP.jpg)
now i'm doing epoxy with jb weld. I taped one side so it doesn't spill.
Epoxy wont hold the mount. Mount is held by clamp load. but the epoxy will hold against vibration.
![20180509_204616|690x388](upload://31ykquHJlCnra4rw9yn98HLE7Ye.jpg)![20180509_205114|281x500](upload://drNhyYQ8nOb7LI0I0X7Iyciu1sv.jpg)![20180509_211920|281x500](upload://y3UF8g0gpkGMYr2sQ0NVGlBdroA.jpg)for the gap I put bolts and nuts as before.
![20180509_212752|690x388](upload://eHnrXtveW5o0Vy9I74j2XAY01qm.jpg)but this time I heated up so it will fill the gap better and hardens faster because JB weld needs 8 hr to set. even hairdryer will do, it only needs like 40-60c degrees.  
And after couple hours I'm ganna come back to remove the tapes

So I finished second set as well.
gearing and belt is really tricky. 
there is not much room for selection. 36 15t with 275mm is maximum 
for 36 12t u get barely 265mm even this u can only use 6355 motors. 
with idler u can use longer length but finding exact numbers on this set up is not worth it. 

interms of ride quality, u need to tight the truck. again the truck is massively turny, I wouldn't say has speed wable as the spring neutralize it, but default bushing leans way too fast and sensitive

you need to replace that lightblue bushing, not sure if this is a real bushing or just a placeholder

Yeah, I know. my favorite bushing shop is far from home so for now I tighten it really good. usable for now but it will probably be destroyed soon lol.  the bushing is not bad quality but it is really soft like 85a ish i think.

after extensive use of first set, the pivot cut wears out really quick because it is basically same size of indy truck size on heavy longboard i think. I see like 1-2mm slop in there u can move it by hand. I'm looking for replacement from riptide and venom will update it once i get them here.  meanwhile here is making film and riding

So I'm planning massive upgrade to the board. I just can't go away from avenue truck apprently it is just too good.

first thing is changing gear ratio from 36:15 to 36:16 which comfortably give me 70kph. 

then the new motor![20180531_154421|281x500](upload://mkrIRDTUReMgMR2RwsZmnvGj7xI.jpg)This motor is thicker and heavier but has sensor on it. I heard good thing about these so wanted to try out. but I might have to take out the front mount and re-adjust @squishy654 do you have spare that I can buy from u? 

also srry @squishy654 that i didn't buy sk8, it just too big to use and torque was on sale.

3rd there will be new battery 12s4p comming soon.

4th proper enclosure.

Extra: got new pivot cup so much better, this one is must have upgrade. it gives u complete control ![20180520_212401|690x388](upload://argVFQGMKj1DnMgqchoFdpfkEk8.jpg)

You need a mount? HK mount?

And what pivot cup are you using?

Hk yeah I want to have as spare in case thing didn't go as plan, then maybe you can shoot me with express shipping. but not like right now.

the pivot i just got from local shop. I just asked for indy and nice shiny PU. I was going to buy like riptide but it seems do just fine.

because torqboard motor is thicker than sk3 i had to remove the mount and re adjust.
despite the mount is held with press and friction it didn't even budged![20180609_000013|690x388](upload://ruqGFjrzyfswky4EwLN7cfEO35b.jpg)

And @torqueboards why do you not include grub screw...[![20180609_151027|281x500](upload://az1ShWIlSExLyv0akJ5yYuQnp7s.jpg)
I had to cut down so that it dose not interfere with belt.

that being said the motor is very high quality. keyway is very handy and mounting hole is also solid.

and because this motor is shorter than sk3 it is fisible to put 2 motors at one truck. it exactly land at half of the truck when mounted. with 12mm belt. 15mm is maybe...![20180610_100349|281x500](upload://nmPIisuINPjkTKcJLS15YDLO0fx.jpg)
that being said, it would be hard and tidious to do so. I wouldn't recommend

So I named my board to Star Platina. Named after the JOJO Adventure.
Im going to swap the deck to Comet![IMG_20180621_230004_707|400x500](upload://4N9qagwiVJ8iJ2ibuitmQfaj6OM.jpg)
with 12s4p battery which @landonkun is building for me will stay in Bigben's fiber glass tray.
![20180626_192339|690x388](upload://i2q4Ov7pbAFzDIiv0wSO6Vr72va.jpg)
I used car door seal to seal the water and dirt off. it was only $10 for 6m. but the smell is horriblly bad tho
![20180626_192857|690x388](upload://XF5cV8JeSE4UURb9K0p7uk7TJq.jpg)
Also using screw insert. this is carbon steel so will not strip or break unlike zinc insert I hate those. also colored washer,

I have both grey and purple not sure which to use tho.

And for @torqueboards I like your 6355 motor I prob buy more but the grub screw that hold the axle and the can didnt have any loctite that it started to loose and making a sound. I thought I broke the bearing. Do I have bad batch or is it suppose to be? I just wants you to note this.
I ordered 12.5 grade grub screw to replace because the original one is already grinded a bit by the axle.
