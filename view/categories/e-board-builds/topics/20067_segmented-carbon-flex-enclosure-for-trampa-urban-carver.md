just wanted to give a quick headsup on the trampa urban carver Im working on and since you can pretty much just buy anything except for decent enclosures nowadays, I just wanted to show the works Ive done on my enclosure during the last few days!

already in early 2015 I had the idea of a segmented carbon enclosure to allow flex - back then with my topspeed:
http://www.alternative-4.com/DIY/topspeed_rework_14.jpg

.. but a bargain vanguard passed my way back then and i never went through with it - instead for the last 2 boards I always used split enclosures closely at the trucks to preserve a boards natural flex as good as possible.

well, today is the day for my first segmented carbon enclosure, since the trampas are too short for short split enclosures and I was tired of the ugly boxes on top of the decks. and oh boy, it was probably the hardest thing I have done so far with vacuum and carbon. :expressionless:

I started to make wood forms with pleasantly rounded 0.5cm radius edges. 5 of these segments are 14x8cm to give room for 2x4 18650 cells for a 10S4P segmented battery. finally a larger segment 14x11cm for dual vesc and a switch. I used double adhesive tape to fixate the wood blocks on the trampa, which has no concave, so it was kinda easy to do.

I then covered the blocks with separation foil - kinda a tough kind so I wouldnt mess with resin on board and wood blocks. each segment in the picture is separated by a small wood spacer that I covered with clear tape, whose dimension should fit exactly between each segment once I got all the glas & carbon layers set up. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/5/f506b06afabd22e079390cc5bb6621295acc0cf3.JPG" width="690" height="319">

at the sides of the wood block, I used very thin dbl adhesive tape to fold the separation foil in order to avoid too many wrinkles and to make application of resin and layups easy. its super annoying, when you do your layup on a separation foil and its moving around the whole time.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/b/6b5a46f5a8fca3d22b363e2b08321b3fb6f33d84.jpg" width="690" height="378">

I then tried something new (bear in mind that this was actually already my 2nd try - the first try I had a lot of folding of carbon with separation foil. :frowning: 

I made the total layup dry - 2x 400gr/m^2 glas, 2x 200gr/m^2 carbon, each time using the wood spacers to bring each layer of fabric into form using my fingers to bent the fabric around all the edges so that it would follow the mold halfway well. THEN I started to use resin and tried to soak the whole 4 layers at once, working it in with a roller and trying to keep the layups snug to the mold as good as possible. while doing that I still had the wood spacers in like in my previous picture! sadly I got no pictures of this process, since it was already way past midnight and I quickly had my hands full with resin.

in the end when I felt everything was wet down to the separation foil, I removed the wood spacers and carefully put a bleeder layer ontop (separation foil with small holes in it):
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/d/3df50f056a3aa0992503e72ce157ef9c4a6428c8.jpg" width="690" height="435">

you can see that each segment still looks kinda bloated without good definition of the mold form, but its following the mold halfway well and it doesnt have supermany wrinkles. I carefully laid the bleeder to avoid a dangerous foil carbon folded wrinkle (hard to explain, but its basically a carbon->foil->carbon layup that can happen when foil and carbon wrinkle together).

finally I added the soaking layer (again as wrinkle free as possible) and added the wooden spacers back into the mix - then off with it into the vacuum bag! I kept massaging the segments for a quite long time in order to make sure that I had no dry patches - you can see very well where you have excess resin by looking at the soaking layer. was kinda paranoid that I would get try patches, since the way I added the resin was a little similar to resin infusion.

after 24hours curing I removed the enclosure from the vacuum bag - it looked quite decent, no dry patches .. just the wood spacers and wood molds didnt really come out without a fight:

I drilled small holes, inserted a screw and pulled the wood blocks and wood spacers out:

after cutting and some sanding of a few wrinkles, the enclosure now looks really nice:

and it flexes really easily:

and the beauty of vacuum bagging: it just fits!

for the battery that will run on the inside: on my first test I realized that I wont be able to really get the interconnections of each segment completely flat with my wood spacers - and I also realized that a lot of resin will just be in the area between the segments below the wood spacers - just enough that I can actually dremel a few flat channels without hurting the fabric and run battery cables through there! :slight_smile:

Beautiful work as always. Question: What kind of vacuum do you use?

I always wanted to try my hand at CF / fiberglass vac-forming, the only vacuum at my disposal is the ol' foodsaver in my kitchen. Would it be a disaster to try to use this for vacuum bagging?

I got a small vacuum pump thats capable of -900mbar at good days - you need a good vacuum to do these kind of sharp features. if you have more forgiving curvatures anything works, otherwise each 100mbar of vacuum is worth 1ton of pressure per square meter!

i actually got the spare one right here - it was my first try with the optical imperfections of folded foil & carbon at the points where you can still see the blue foil. it does not affect functionality, its a purely aesthetic thing. :yum:

hehe, nah sorry, I got so little time that i barely manage to bring my own projects forward :confused:

the enclosure was a lot of work and its still far from perfect. think this might be something for resin infusion - dry layups follow a form much better than already wetted stuff.

I am sure that some enterprising individual would be able to put together a cheaper version of this with a thin flexible thermoformed plastic such as PETG, like with a plastic coke bottle.  I would get one! 

As your enclosure is the same width as the deck, you might not need to drill holes  through your deck to secure it. You could use pairs of compression clips/clamps around the edge, something like a Nalclip or a MoriClip (the latter is probably better).

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/7/8749b24998aea44981a289c79d4e0eee60015e2b.gif" width="250" height="150"> <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/3/13c5df0d4996dcbd027b20d9665ff27d5ae2ce0a.jpg" width="200" height="200">

Not sure what people's thoughts would be about the aesthetics of something like this, or how many clips would be required, but as the trampa deck is significantly thinner, the full width enclosure opens up a range of options to secure an enclosure through using compression, as opposed to glue and/or bolts.  It would also allow you to access the batteries, and potentially battery hot-swapping options.

i could do that, but aethetically thats a no go for me :smile: ill make the enclosure just a little bit slimmer and use my typical screw combo.

yesterday I drilled all holes but didnt have enough inserts. anyway, thats how this will look in the end:

[/quote]

problem is that these slits were so far always on the wrong side of the enclosure - it allows you to follow the boards curvature but at the same time its a solid piece of board layer 2cm above the original last layer. it will be under a lot of stress from flexing and most likely completely change your boards flex level to become a lot stiffer! 

the closest to this fully segmented type of enclosure is @Kaly really nice kydex enclosures, which are pretty generic already. but their focus is bending of the middle area, not sure how that feels in practice. for example i dont like the feeling of split enclosures when there isnt enough wood between them. you can feel how only a small part of the board is flexing and the rest is stiffened up.

overall Im not too convinved by these trampa enclosures, as much as Id like to use a consistently looking material mix! problem of my kind of enclosure is, that its not very generic, so either you have a lot of versions or youll dictate the kind of electronics you want in there.

ebay - in germany you can search for "rosette" and find them: http://www.ebay.de/itm/Rosetten-SCHWARZ-fur-Senkkopfschrauben-Edelstahl-A1-fur-M3-bis-M8-NF-E-27-619-/400715400073?var=670260368435&hash=item5d4c7fc389:m:mqp4q5a75uKnuWe8dsCjTvg

below these washers, I usually have 2mm thick rubber washer to even out imperfections/curved surfaces a little bit. also screws tend to come loose less likely with these.

Are you intending to use anything as a waterproofer or contact sealant for in between the deck and enclosure? 

If you are going to, try this out Black tack http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Black-Tack-Posing-Putty-wargaming-1-metre-length-/272605013698?hash=item3f788666c2:g:vg8AAOSwc1FXbu1K 
Its both easier to use and has a longer use life than silicone or rubber/foam padding and is a far better sealant for things with flex, also its very good at isolating vibrations, for me any builder wanting waterproofing or a tight seal should have this in the tool box. 

If you think its a :poop: idea my bad i just woke up all chatty and thought ide chip in :slight_smile:
 ps very nice clean work, looks shuper shexy.... :blush:

im using that tack stuff to seal vacuum bags, its indeed great to seal, but I bet you never ever get your enclosure off anymore. i actually want to use 1-2mm thick and 2cm wide neoprene band between enclosure and board to avoid the capillary effect of 2 really well fitting surfaces ;)

I was anticipating problems such as this, but since I got the battery compartment, may as well give it a shot.

I ordered a different board from Bustin and am expecting to recieve it tomorrow of which I will use instead if it does not work too well.

Will be going ABS plastic molding with  the Bustin board.

True a partial vacuum bond can be almost impossible to get apart if you dont break the vacuum first but if theres no vacuum it releases a lot easier, i know a few UK and EU Evolve riders are now using it after the GT and Carbon lid seals have failed in wet conditions, i dont know if Evolve used a neoprene inlay probz not tho!

had like 8 inserts only, but I attached the enclosure to the board anyway to test flex - and it feels largely unaffected, maybe just slightly stiffer, but if so, the difference is so small that I cant really tell for sure. maybe it will be more noticeable when all screws are fixating the enclosure, but I dont actually think so. :grinning:

because I was asked Ill give a quick update on the inserts and how I do it:

basically I put a lot of effort in exactly measuring the spots where I want inserts BEFORE I actually make the enclosure - I then predrill the holes in order to create small bumps that are visible after Im done with laminating. by that I know exactly where to drill the holes in my enclosure. 

when the enclosure is done, i drill m4 holes for my screws, then position the enclosure again on the board and use a marker to mark the holes through the enclosure holes on the board again. it can always be that, while drilling the holes in the enclosure, you are just slightly off and you can correct that by slightly correcting the holes in the board.

then I drill with an 6mm drill bit through the board. why through? well, my inserts are either 8mm or 10mm long, so thats pretty much the thcikness of the board. if you think you might manage without drilling through fine, but most likely youll break through on a few holes anyway or dont manage to get enough depth and while sinking in the inserts, you actually create bumps on the other side cause you didnt drill the holes deep enough.

anyway, sticking the drill bit all the way through. then I use clear tape on the boards top side and cover all holes. turning the board around again and dripping 1-2 drops of thick resin (actually 2 component glue) into the drilled holes to have absolutely crazy fixated inserts later. 

then Im screwing in the inserts into the resin - the whole thing will look like this now (from the boards road side):
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/7/47f7020439ba26d4007bef7f46e3a2ac3785da1c.jpg" width="682" height="500">

curing 12 hours and turning the board around youll now have resin on the bottom of the inserts covering the holes you drilled through the board AND at the same time youll have perfectly fixated inserts. picture shows how I remove the clear tape and you can see the slightly yellowish/transparent dried resin:

and in a close up:

finally I tested all screws and attached the enclosure - a perfect fit thanks to the very thorough procedure:

the board is really super slim and after I added vicious grip tape it looks quite vicious :smile:

can barely see the enclosure anymore from this perspective. the small spur drives from @nowind look crazy good too - super compact. :heart_eyes:

Amazing, beautiful work. You are truly a master of your craft. Part of me wants to do a custom carbon fiber enclosure like this, but a larger part of me knows it won't turn out anywhere near as nice, and I'll just end up disappointed after seeing what it could have been.

[quote="Landshark, post:36, topic:20067, full:true"]
Did you remove your grip tape and replace with a new sheet after you were done?
[/quote]

yea, it was actually the first thing I removed for 2 reasons - firstly I knew that Ill drill through anyway for the inserts, 2nd it was really cheap grey grip tape with very low grip. the whole board looked bad with it and since its a board without concave and bindings, I knew it wouldnt work for me when I carve on the slip limit of urethane wheels. its really annoying to constantly reposition your feet cause your foot position keeps changing little by little. the only grip where that never happened is vicious for me - put your foot where you want it and carve along for 1hour :heart_eyes:

hm, I can just encourage everybody to try themselves - all these things arent very hard and it helps to have somebody like me to talk about the issues one had on the way - it took me 2 tries for this kind of enclosure too and I learnt a lot about working with fabric on these kind of sharp features. Im sure next time Id be done on first try - so you build up a lot of very valuable knowledge along the way - and the costs are nearly negligible:

forming an enclosure with wood is basically free - or you can print a form beforehand for more complex enclosures. then you can start making enclosures with glass initially (which costs nearly nothing!) and once you have something that is nice, cover it with one layer of carbon for looks. I always got 1-2 layers of glass on the inside anyway to avoid shorting - carbon is really conducting very well.

all it takes is some dedication and patience, because setting up everything is probably 2-3 hours and then its 24hours waiting for the result. :smiley:

guess you could stack batteries, but then the slim looks are down the drain. basically double height segments would allow about 80-90 cells in total - at that point you need to be careful through - trampas are made with flex and energy returns in mind - if you have a very thin board like me (14pl), you can theoretically bottom it out - easily with bindings and jumping, probably a lot harder with just carving but with some rough ground, bumpy sidewalks and when pushing outwards hard it might be possible too!

in that case Id try to build the enclosure by using slim segments in the middle of the board and increasingly thicker segments towards the trucks! that way you wont bottom out on your battery and you still have everything below your board!

hm, its not super easy - the initial things you need sounds like a lot:

resin: http://shop1.r-g.de/en/art/100100
glas I usually buy aero quality, since its cheap anyway: http://shop1.r-g.de/en/list/Fibre-reinforcements/Glass-fibre/Fabrics/Twill/&suchbegriff_6=Aero&ButtonName=06 there is also blackened glas which is probably kinda cool! :smiley: 
for carbon finishing layers I use spread twill, because its already slightly flattened and makes for a smoother surface: http://shop1.r-g.de/en/art/190230-ST-100
otherwise just 200gr/m^2 twill: http://shop1.r-g.de/en/art/190230-NA-120
or any 200gr/m^2 unidirectional for craziest strength per layer. unidirectional is quite stiff though, youll need proper vacuum bagging to use UD carbon imo!

for vacuum bagging:
vacuum sealing tape: http://shop1.r-g.de/en/art/390171
vacuum bag: http://shop1.r-g.de/en/art/390160
bleeder layer: http://shop1.r-g.de/en/art/390190

there wont be any wire under the battery! Ill use nickel strips (4 ontop of each other for serial currents). at the right point it will extend by the width of my flat wire so that I can bend the strips by 90°. then Ill solder the flat wire sandwiched by 2 nickel strips each and the flat wire will bridge the gap between segments by forming a simple "U"-shape and the enclosure segment gap sitting in that U.

Im also organizing the battery in a way that "+" and "-" pole end exactly at the largest segment with the vescs - so there wont be any long wire running through the whole length of the battery.

Ill probably start working on it this weekend, then youll see what I mean with fotos! :slight_smile:

its 5 smaller segments for the battery (each segment can carry 2x 4 cells for a total of 10S4P, organized in 5x 2x 4P), and the larger segment for 2x vesc, loop key/electronik switch (probably not the latter, dont trust in these and they steal Wh), receiver and whatever else I can think of. :slight_smile:

thats the layout - last segment can fit either 4.12 vesc or any of the new formats - thats why its slightly larger than necessary! that picture also illustrates how small a trampa actually is - its kinda hard to fit much more below it in a segmented flex layout! :wink:

well, its overexaggerated, but since these mosfests have a higher inner resistance than a 10awg wire, youll have some losses there ... and extra heat. its just a handful watts either way.

there are other reasons for me though - I nearly lost one battery because a switch broke and its fallback was "always on". bad weather, so 1 week later i checked the voltage and I hit 2.5V/cell.

from that day on I save the space, Whs, heat and money for a shitty switch and go hard on/off with a 10awg bullet connector loop key. it sparks, but I havent had any issues with it in 5000km on several boards ;)

@whitepony I have several builds with switch, breakers, loop key and or electric switch. Loop key anti spark is the best! They didnt brake under water. Consume no energy. Cut off charges for sure. No current limits. They just rock solid. More important with a proper placement and a cable, it could be transformed into deadmans switch.

Have you considered a extra switch alongside your bullet connector with a resistor so you don't get a spark. I say that because I've lost a esc just connecting a battery, probably bad for capacitors. I was also thinking like a momentary switch that you press with your pinky while connecting the bullet connectors

[quote="Mobutusan, post:72, topic:20067"]

well, there is SOME thinking in these connectors by now :sweat_smile: first of all: they are enclosed in 1.5mm thick glued shrink tube thats really indestructible and hard to get off. this sits in sugru (partly seen on outside, mostly on the inside), which is an awesome non conducting and quite robust material. so nope, not afraid at all that something just wears out and shorts ultimately.

the rest of safety comes with the layout itself: if you check my picture vs diagram, it doesnt match, because the diagram was a lot easier to draw like this. the key (hah) difference is: left connector in my boards picture is battery "+" connection. right port on my picture is battery "-" charging connection. if these 2 touch, there will indeeed be a lot of smoke and tears. i designed the charging wire to evaporate instead of anything else, so its easy to replace should that ever happen!

you switch on the board by connecting middle (vesc "+") and left (battery "+"). if middle (vesc "+") and right (battery charging "-") touches, nothing happens at all.

if middle (vesc "+") and left (battery "+") touches, the board is on. 

so either way, nothing bad happens except for when the 2 outer ports touch - which isquite unlikely! you can see, this is different in my awkward diagram, where neighbor mid left shorts the battery. THATS bad design cause it might happen on accident or so. i just drew it like that for simpliciy sake.


hope its more clear now :slight_smile:

today I made the segmented battery - was a lot of work cause I used 8 nickel strips for each 4P1S pack - 4 strips per serial connections. its a lot more work than just soldering some copper wires ontop of one nickel strip, but it looks cleaner and feels more solid as a pack.

few pictures of the progress:

added cardboard stickers for additional safety @ plus poles

one 1S4P pack with nickel strips extending beyond the pack for the segment connections:

since i want to bend the extension of the strips by 90°, I glued adhesive felt sheets on the cells to protect them from the sharp nickel strips

now I started soldering the segment connections with superthick braided copper wire (about 10mm wide, 2mm thick):

did that for all aaaaand done. at the enclosure segments where the braided copper wire is running, Ill dremel some resin out to seat the connections flush with the enclosure base:

finally adding some shrink tube - and I was quite generous - just heated it up and pressed the segments into the enclosure - shrink tube easily gave in where it had to and stiffed up when it cooled down:

The idea of the flex flat wire is pretty clever. I'm going to borrow it for my urban carver build which I'm planing to work on in a couple of months once I get the funds. 

There is going to be a good flexiness on the flat wire part, but how are you going to avoid flexiness on each group of 4 cells in order to avoid the strips from braking? Even though there are 4 nickel strips there's no guarantee those won't brake as the board flexes 300 times a day.

[/quote]

an enclosure segment does not really flex, only the flat segment interconnections. thats due to the design of the enclosure! even if the board might flex a little in those segment areas, the enclosure will not. worst case the bending board will lift off the enclosure slighty by applying pressure to the 2 middle cells - but the trampa has tons of camber. some mild pressure will only build up after it bends beyond the "flat" point.

tiny steps today - Im not in a hurry since my vescs and mini remote are still on their way anyway. 

started the day with dremeling the braided copper wire channels into the lower resin areas. you can see very well that in the lower part of the interconnecting segments (beneath the wood blocks that I used to form the segments in the first place), there is quite some resin and also air. got enough room everywhere now for the copper wires :slight_smile:

next I made male/female 5.5mm bullet connector units

which i then shrink tubed with the thickest glue shrink tube I had. you can also see the 5.5mm bullet connector 10AWG loop key. its my first serious dual motor setup, so I went slightly overboard with wire thicknesses and connectors. :stuck_out_tongue:

the idea was to stick out the female part and have a short male connection on the inside of the enclosure to allow swapping components more easily. on my single motor boards, I had VERY little room and most of the stuff was hard soldered. now I got a lot more room to play with and Im using it for some component flexibility.

drilled 9.5mm (!!!) holes into the enclosure which fit the 5.5mm connectors with superthick shrink tube perfectly - can barely move them in an out. fixating with sugru at a later point, since somehow I didnt have any sugru anymore. for the picture the male-female-units are just stuck in there!

at the sides, I got my triple -++ ports for charging and also for on/off with my giant loop key. you can see that I stuck the male-female units far in at the side which fits the arriving braided copper wire perfectly, as its just coming through under the thick shrink tube of the male-female ports.

What VESCs are you going to run? BLDC or FOC?

I still don't get why don't you use an antispark switch, on a such a beautiful build, the small details always add up, even though the loop key is a clever and reliable solution, an antispark switch looks way nicer in my opinion.

How did you actually managed to melt xt90s? At first you made suspicious about vedder's anti-spark and then basic xt90s. I thought i would like to try something fancier than xt60 loopkey which i have used so far.

not sure what ever happened to that xt90S. other people reported it got very hot when it wasnt fully plugged in - my guess is that a small resistor (the one that supresses the spark) it the sole connection and the rest didnt really connect. some brought some mysterious polarity into the game which I dont believe up to date.

for me it happened twice with an xt90s - got hot, started melting, game over.

about vedders antispark: i have never used that. so far Ive tried torqueboards antispark which worked fine up to date since more than 2 years. and an alien power system antispark, which I killed TWICE now.

my summary: screw all that crap, go simple!

The only reason to use a full AntiSpark switch is stealth. Other than that a XT90S should work fine - although it seems like people have mixed feelings regarding them. Besides @whitepony I have not heard of a lot of cases that a XT90S has melted. Not inserting it fully might cause obvious problems though.

but that will have open slits and holes so that dust and dirt plus water can get inside. @whitepony's enclosure seems much better suited for the intended purpose (and also looks better). You should look into manufacturing a similar one instead of just offering a panel that needs to be worked on and have end caps made.

problem is that my enclosure isnt very generic - its suited only for my kind of battery layout. i share your thoughts about the trampa enclosure, but for many people without access to vacuum, this is a good start. you can always wrap your components in cling film and just use the slitted enclosure as physical protection.

I am also wondering if the thin slits are actually wide enough to allow for flex. The paper @trampa showed the flex with, is only able to flex because the "parts" left and right of a slit can move above and under each other. With thick carbon (additionally mounted to a deck) this is not possible anymore. The only way then is to have enough distance between the faces.

@trampa: can you show how good the actual carbon flexes?

There are two different slit pattern, one for bending upward and one for bending downwards. This allows the enclosure to flex in both directions. The enclosure is very sturdy and impact resistant! 4Ply Trampa magic fiber.
I just lay a thin (0.5mm) silicone sheet inside the tub and everything is nice and waterproof. The end bungs will be shown tomorrow. They seal off the ends very tight and splash proof. 

We think its a nice and generic product that can be made to any length and requirement and basic tools are enough to sort out your custom battery box within 2hours.

This is my method of closing off the ends:

I usee a 20x25mm plastic L-Profile and some 2mm thick EPDM foam (single side sticky sheet material).
I stick a strip of the EPDM on the inside of the battery enclosure, followed by two more strips, leaving a gap, so that the L-Profile slots into that gap.

The cable outlet holes  are made wider (8mm) and then I stick some rubber (bicycle inner tube) on the inside of the L-Profile. A tiny hole can be cut into the rubber, using the revolving punch pliers. Now you can pull the cable through the rubber and the cable outlet will be sealed off.

How to put a nice thread into a Trampa Deck. Actually you can cut threads into our decks, so you can also cut repair threads! Wind them in with some epoxy resin. Grip tape can be attached once all threads are made. Think twice before you attach the grip tape. Finish your board first! The last thing is the grip tape!

phew, got home from 12hours work and now I fiddled for 6 hours straight to finalize the board. :sweat_smile:

it was a LOT of soldering, one complete rearrange inside the electronic segment, waterproofing the enclosure with neoprene band, setting up the 2 vescs, then putting it all together and doing a quick maidens ride in the rain.

turns out my phase wire exits and triple on/off/charge ports were taking a lot of room in the wrong spots - and all of that just so that the phase wires would not cover up 2 enclosure screws on the outside :confused: in the end i had a LOT less room to work with than initially planned.

I got the 2 vescs cornered now under the protective felt sheets, 2x 2200uF external capacitor bank instead of 6x 680uF stock capacitors (which just took too much room) and both vescs are connected to these capacitors in parallel. hope this wont end badly, since the 2 vescs are directly coupled now to ONE smoothing reservoir. 10awg wires and all 5.5mm bullet connectors didnt help with the available space either - shouldve just directly soldered everything together instead of single 5.5mm bullet connector units. 
the receiver is set up in the opposite corner next to the capacitors - went for ppm splitter instead of can cable, because I was a little afraid of killing vescs by accident - the receiver seems far enough away from strong currents, didnt have any issues with reception on my quick run.

the whole enclosure is sealed with 2mm thick and 2cm wide neoprene band, that compresses so much under all these screws that you cant really tell from the outside (I can take some pictures tomorrow). I found that the capillary effect with 2 very well fitting surfaces really sucks in the water, so you really need something to break this effect.

for the maidens ride in the rain hmm, where to begin? I ran for a total of 5min, then the rain got even stronger and I fled back home. my first impressions were: 

* camber of these trampa boards still a little strong, need to stand in the middle of the board to really level it out. I felt like it might grow on me though with pushing outwards in turns, because its fairly flexy afterall. couldnt push too much with fresh electronics and wet roads!
* very turny, maybe removing the yellow dampas wasnt a good idea afterall with the dual motor speed! 
* running the motors as dual foc and the board is REALLY suprisingly silent - also expected the direct drive gears to be louder than the belts. couldnt really tell much of a difference to be honest.
* amazing coasting!! didnt think the drive gears would coast THAT well :scream:
* pretty high top speed - was setting the board up, so that i would hit 48kph with the 125mm trampa urethane hub wheels. well, now I still got the 7" pneumatics and with the 1:4 gearing, 230kw motor and 10S battery, this is 60kph+ :stuck_out_tongue:
* nearly forgot how strong dual motors are. set up 40A battery -10A braking per vesc and fully throttle/braking is really strong.
* pneumatics suck, Im really an urethane guy :joy: didnt counterbalance the stupid valve, so I had annoying vibrations from the wheels. the immense grip makes riding a little boring, because youll never ever slip kinda and it feels so disconnected from the road. flexy board and soft trucks is one thing, but its still very direct. pneumatic wheels are always somewhat spongy and all the precise nice urethane ride is gone. @trampa gimme those urethane hubs!!!! 

fingers crossed for better weather tomorrow

ok, it actually started to grow on me, like I already expected yesterday. we got a lot of wind, but not much rain so i was able to run one full battery now. the direct drive is AWESOME, really best thing that happened to mountain boards in a long time. shouts out to @esk8 @Nowind who brought this to the market!!

pneumatics still suck though, I just hate it. need to balance the tyres - the stupid valve wobble is driving me mad. and since Im carving like a madman, the tyres already have pretty heavy wear after just a single battery. :expressionless:

suprised about the 14ply board - its the lightest of the trampa urban boards and with my 82kg Im not really a feather, but the board still feels juuuust on the edge of being too stiff. no clue how others ride with 16ply+ :astonished:

trucks still need tuning - i ran without dampas and it was too soft, I put in yellow dampas and it was impossible to ride any turn (this is really something for bindings only). @nowind pointed at pre-tensioning which I kinda overlooked until now - gotta play with that later when the battery is full again.

with 2 motors I find myself to ride much more aggressive - quite amazing brakes with 2 pneumatic wheels and 2 motors :stuck_out_tongue: the battery is actually getting slightly warm which has never ever happened to me before really. :hushed:

Put the springs in outer position and tighten down the adjusters until they sit flush with the deck. Also try dampas in the back (inner position) and no dampas in front truck, outer position. 
Flex is s matter of taste. We have 110KG riders ordering boards. Some like a plank, some like a trampolin.

How much inflation do you put on the tire? Try 65PSI. The beauty about the pneumatics is: No Vibrations, smooth gliding, hard pack (trail) riding. Horses for courses...

I think overall 4x nickel strips are better than 1x nickel strips and some copper - alone for the soldering heat. pack is a lot more solid too!

think the heat is just from the load. pneumatic tyres, a lot of speed and quite aggressive acceleration/braking - currently I still enjoy the dual motors - didnt have that in a long time now :smiley:

ended up at slightly earlier than flush position - feels really good now! :slight_smile:

what I really hate is the stupid valve wobble - on my first eboard (evolve carbon), i added weight stickers that you use to counterbalance car tyres. think ill have to do the same for the trampa hubs until Im finally getting my hands on urethane hubs! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:


[quote="Eboosted, post:112, topic:20067"]

wont happen, i was motivated to build up this board by direct drive + urethane trampa hubs - thats what I will run in the end. direct drive is AWESOME, I love this so much. nice coasting with 100% grip, no belt slipping, silent drive anyway, splash and chip proof - its simply perfect!

valve wobble and excessive wear aside, pneumatics can be quite alright and I kind of got used to them again. reminds me of my evolve carbon AT - just ride over anything, sidewalks, sticks, chips, road, nothing matters, and full carve all the way.

problem is, with the crazy grip of pneumatics I carve even harder and pneumatics just wear down so quickly then. on my evolve I always had to swap a full set after 200km - it got quite costly and was also annoying.
___________

overall this monster keeps on growing on me - love the torque, love the speed, enjoying cross country capability, switching sidewalks and street a lot. with the adjusted spring tension, the board feels a LOT better - its a night and day difference. now I can actually play with the flex to adjust a carving radius which wasnt possible before, cause the trucks would just cut in super hard. with the new feeling of the trucks I have to say that the flex is actually quite spot on now (now that I could actually use it for the first time) :heart_eyes:

first 100km down now, very lucky with the weather. Ill just order a few sets of tyres until urethane will be available! :stuck_out_tongue:

You need the pre-tension on the springs. When you compress one side, the opposing spring will sit to loose, when the adjuster is not locked down. It makes all the difference!

Unfortunately, I don't ride trampa AT hubs, just Evolve GT (with various 7" evolve tires and various 8" mbs tires) and @psychotiller (with Matco's).  @whitepony is correct as usual lol, evolve no longer uses MBS hubs for GT (only Gen 2 work with MBS hubs).  Yes, I was surprised the evolve hubs also work with 8" mbs tires and 8" inner tubes.  I have had good experience with the evolve GT pneumatics, and wear down has been OK typical to other pneummie tires.  Not sure if you are contemplating the evolve roadie slicks or knobbies, but @trampa should be able to say if they fit on his hubs.

What @trampa really needs to tell us though....is where are the uro 125mm hubs he promised us!!!!

balanced the wheels with about 10gr adhesive weights opposite to the valve - its not 100% perfect, but already significantly reduced the wobble.

also ordered a set of evolve gt wheels for testing - tried a lot of pneumatics in my life already, not expecting the wonder wheel but maybe it lasts a little bit longer. :confused:

last picture in this thread now that shows the board with all final touches after its first 100km. all screws in, all charging/switch/phase wire ports in, neoprene band between enclosure and board is not really visible. think I might use all black shrink tube on the motor wires - current state is "stock setup" from italien @fottaz .
thanks to the well fitting surfaces board vs enclosure and the first time I use this really wide (2cm) neoprene band, this is probably one of my most splash and dust proof boards of all my builds. the 5.5mm bullet connectors are waterproof too (no small hole inside that sometimes in there to let air out/in), the direct drives are pretty well sealed too. not worried to use this on wet roads to be honest :slight_smile:

keeping you updated on changes, but all in all Im done here and very happy with the results. I enjoyed how the board shaped up for me ride by ride and I really liked how the proper spring setup started to let the flex shine during hard carving. I also enjoy the dual vescs - last time I ran a trampa with dual vescs, it felt weak and I had a lot of temperature issues. now with a separate electronic compartment and the shortest possible 10awg battery/vesc connections, I dont have any issues at all anymore. feels all very solid, strong brakes, decent acceleration ... not nowind wheelie stuff, but enough to let you grin a little. 

looking forward to long term testing of the direct drives now :heart_eyes:

@whitepony i wanted to know about the batteries on the left i saw when the batteries were finished that they looked covered together with one sleeve. Not like the other 1s4p batteries. Did you separate them or did you just joined them together with a braided copper wire?

4 days commuting to work (20km daily) and the rubbers are nearly done. and I even stopped carving hard 2 days ago. shitty rubber simply does not work for me ... :neutral_face:

Ill use up my 2 evolve wheel sets this month and put the board on hold until @trampa brings out urethane. 150-200€ pneumatics per month is simply not acceptable.

nope, had them on my first trampa, also had a few different mbs wheels, been through a lot of rubber with my 768Wh carbon AT 3 years ago ;)

rubber has no chance against carving, its like constantly braking hard sideways. but without carving I might as well ride a bike ... carving4life!

That's greatest downside of pneumatics... I didn't have a chance to ride my MTB much from over a year now (my endless quest to find an ultimate eMTB ESC 😂, hope VESC 6 will be my holy grail) but I managed to kill one set of tires anyway. From my experience I must say that cheap industrial tires I bought seem to wear down waaay slower than softer grippy dedicated MTB wheels ( I think You should look more into this, zabi tires is manufacturer I'm talking about, they're from Poland so there is a chance they will ship them to You). I have them on my caster board, really nice CHEAP street tires, and the best part is their price, 5€ for piece :D 

@Idea can confirm my words, he also is really happy with durability of those tires.

changed to evolve tires now and added some cheesy white tire liner for a more sportive look :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

the tires make a better impression than the trampa 7" to me - they are less rounded with a much wider contact patch in the middle, so maybe they actually last longer. they definitely look a lot better than the wheel chair trampa pneus :joy:

ah yea, nearly forgot, the tires are a perfect fit for the trampa hubs (no suprise i guess)!

Another method how to build a nice flex enclosure. 

With regards to tires: We use a different internal construction to assure high PSI capability. That ads to cost.

Anyone wanting to make urethane rings: You need a lot of expensive moulds. Once the urethane is hot and ready to be shot, you want to fill as many moulds as possible. Small wheels small moulds, massive wheels, big moulds, big price.

heh, so many messages :smile:

been riding the evolve wheels today - they feel better than the trampa wheels. the reason for that is not grip or anything, but they are more stable against lateral forces when carving. my guess is thats because the trampa 7" wheels are quite a bit more narrow compared to the evolve wheels. ontop of that the evolve wheels were balanced better. had quite a wobble with the trampa wheels despite counterweighting because the tire on the hub wasnt perfectly centered. the evolve wheels were seated really well on the hubs and all of them ran very precise with no wobble at all. too bad they are also quite expensive :frowning:

evolve: very wide patch, quite stable in lateral direction!

trampa: more narrow and more rounded patch on trampa wheels. didnt have a better pictures to compare these two!

you could copy my enclosure and give all segments double height :stuck_out_tongue:

in the official @trampa build thread, frank wants to build a 11S4P battery and if you check his enclosure, thats probably as much as you can distribute along the length of the board. if you want more, youll have to use a double layer 18650.

I still dont think 80cells is a good idea :stuck_out_tongue:

that sounds like too few cells. i could fit 40 cells in my segments PLUS a large segment that has the volume for 2x vesc6 (just that I screwed it up with the large 5.5mm bullet connectors.

your 11S4P = 44 cells seemed very reasonable for a one piece box, maybe even 10S5P?

Hey @whitepony I know I'm a bit late but where do the balance wires go + side - side or does it matter.  Also where do they go on the 2s4p end - thanks

@whitepony doesn't usually use a BMS on his builds, so there aren't any balance wires. Where you've circled, the batteries are connected straight across.

that's 11S4P. The one side is 6 cell blocks long the other 5 cell blocks long. Take the 5 cell block side as an example for the balance wires. I also have the cells all pointing to one side with their plus pole to allow the flex. Your layout will put strain on the cell block connectors.

can I do it without vacuum? what is soaking layer (what material)? Can I apply soaked layers of glas? Can I make it only with glas, no carbon?
if I understood everything right (sorry if I take too much time, I don't speak english very well)
1.making wooden form, mounting it to deck with tape
2.covering it with separation foil
3.using wooden blocks I apply and secure layers glas
4.I soak glas
5.I put it to vacuum bag
6. next day I remove it from vacuum

hehe, well, to be honest: not only do they look good, but they also seem to last longer than the trampa stock wheels. Im running these tyres since about 200-250km days now (around 10 days riding) and even though there is now just a hint of profile left, it really took a while.

actually Im really liking what the board has become for me - the moment weather seems to be semi stable, theres dirt on the road or the streets are still wet from the night, Im running the trampa. the capsuled drive is PERFECT, absolutely maintenance-free. the enclosure is really great too, completely sealed - overall its just a great allrounder while my vanguard single drive is still my preferred good weather carving machine. 

its a good mix these 2 :heart_eyes:

So they are almost done and hold up for about 300km?
Not bad but I hoped it's more than that because it's much thicker than the trampa ones. My urban carver build is not finished yet but like you I'm waiting for the 125mm urethanes, too :sunglasses: because I'll use the urban carver for 200-400km every month and can't afford to switch tyres all the time.

On my MTB I use trampa treads hard compound and it seems that they last for about 400km (maybe even more if the timing of swapping the front and rear tyres is perfect)

WP loves to carve hard, so rubber wheels don't last long. His trampa's only lasted for about 80km I think...so the 200-250km is a pretty big leap for him.

its always hard to compare back to back - I accumulated the kilometers on the evolve wheels over a longer period of time and I think I only carved really hard on just a few days - on others I was in a hurry and pushed the board hard on acceleration/braking instead. :slight_smile:

@rich if you dont carve a lot, pneumatics will last a LONG time!

But joking aside I won't carve too hard but when they are done I'll take the original tyres and gonna carve as hard as I can and call it the " @Nowind day ". Once in a lifetime everyone should destroy new tyres in one single day :joy::joy:

Dude, what brand of 6355 is that? I tried the 6374 with @Nowind mini direct drive, it was just a tad too long (the shaft to fit the motor pulley into the enclosure). I could have maybe dremel'd that part. Even so, the tail end of the motor sticks out too far and hits the kingpin.

Yeah I saw your pics... your motors are 6355... they are like only 55 mm length wise. Mine are 74mm. They hit up against the kingpin nut. 

One could dremel the nut, but is it worth it? I will keep looking at the problem but it seems maybe only the dymond gtx 6374 which has a smaller than 74mm body is the only 6374 that fits with Jenso's mount. Not sure. Definitely any 6354 / 6355  (54 or 55 mm body) motors will fit like a charm.  These mistakes and shipping stuff from Europe... its all a valueable le$$on. I got to measure twice before I order next time.

I sent him an email a few weeks back about the same and other stuff but he has been awol and I haven't gotten any replies.  Maybe he is on the vacation?

I ordered this from Trampa because I couldn't wait any longer...

So how does that work. You have to cut slits in it right? I wish that was done already when you bought it :(

Blah, it seems like it should be so simple to get the right carbon fiber mold. But I don't have a vacuum pump to make one.

Yes there are two build threads on this forum that explain the process, you have to create slits.  It is a bit of a headache but the material is the same that Trampa uses for it's boards which is indestructible. I just got mine... I believe they made it a little too thick but it still works.

If I had to do it over again, I would have ordered Kaly's ABS enclosure which is about $60 and comes with the mounting hardware:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/trampa-street-carve-nyc-style/15363

I think it's possible to also create that enclosure with a 3D printer -- ABS spool is cheap... about $50 for 3kg so you could make many of them. But I would just order from Kaly his price point is very reasonable.

Downside, dude is very busy so who knows when you will get a response.

the wood blocks I bought were 18mm tall (its a standard size when you buy them in one of those hardware stores). its fits the 18650 cells perfectly, especially when you use some foam sealing tape on the contact areas board <-> enclosure.


this weekend I opened the board again after driving it daily for 2 weeks now, even through rain. I had some issues with the alien handheld controller since the beginning - in some areas where I had high voltage lines going above my head, I had strong disturbances of the signal, sometimes giving me full stop and things like that. it also sometimes happened when I carved really hard and I remembered that I didnt decouple the receiver power supply from the Y-split PPM receiver cables (both vescs were powering the receiver in parallel - uhoh, bad pony!!). so I changed the PPM split to single short PPM and CAN connection of the 2 vescs and carefully adjusted the layout so that the PPM cable only crosses high current silicon wires perpendicular ... without noticeable changes but it felt better anyway. then I swapped the APS remote for a miniremote and all my problems were gone instantly. its such a good remote and its great to ride the board without having to fear signal cutouts. screw aps - everything they got either breaks or is crap to begin with. :expressionless:

since pneumatics is the only thing you can ride in germany at this time of the year, I decided to build mud/splashguards for my trampa!

formed a wood block slightly larger than a new full pressure evolve gt pneu:

4x layers of 200gr/m^2 carbon with a very flexible vacuum foil

and done! took me a long time actually cause forming that mold wasnt easy, clearcoated it, then 1 splashguard -> cure 24h, remove from woodblock, sand, cut. its been a lot of work and i didnt have much time atm. 

anyway, happy with the results. testrode them through soaking wet roads and they work very well, nothing on the board, nothing on my pants! 2 more to go and its kinda cool that they can be as easily attached to the driven rear wheels too. :slight_smile:

generally speedring -> large stable washer -> splasguards -> washer -> nut, ie its connected to the nonmoving parts. to make this more solid incase of impact, i used dbl adhesive tape between all rings/washer to add to a little more friction. works very well, been going in heavy rain at full speed by now!

Hey @whitepony Sorry to revive your thread. I'm wondering how your board has been now that some time has passed. I'm thinking of doing something similar to your enclosure, however I'm worried about the connections between the packs. Even though its braided copper, wouldn't it eventually break apart with all the flexing of the deck?

the board still runs exceptionally well, really no issues even though i often ride in wet conditions and basically all winter now. the flex battery connections havent worn either yet, i checked recently when i swapped out a receiver for another remote. the flex per segment isnt really all that much, its not like you constantly bend the copper by +-90degrees. :sweat_smile:

I use 0.15mm strips - because if the strips are thicker they are harder to spot weld
and if you do a mistake - they just "glow" away faster than thicker strips.
