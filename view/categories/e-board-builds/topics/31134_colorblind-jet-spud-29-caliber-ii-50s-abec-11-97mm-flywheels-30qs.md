To start, this boars is damned weird to ride, not bad, just vastly different from the 40im deck with AT's I've been riding for the last few months.   It's tons of fun, but I feel a little like I'm drunk with so little real estate to plant my feet on.  @treenutter has spoiled me with the Caldera drop deck ðŸ˜€.

I'm using the dual motor controller from eBay (http://www.ebay.com/itm/Dual-motors-longboard-skateboard-controller-with-remote-ESC-Substitute-/302332736118?var=&hash=item46646f7276) at least temporarily.  I wanna see how it stands up to hard use.  

The 2 things, other than deck size, that I'm really digging are the 97mm 75a ABEC 11 Flywheels and the Freebord S2 Bindings.  

These are the best thane wheels I've ever ridden, frikkin amazing.  Throw your flywheel clones away, get these NOW! ðŸ˜€. http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/product/abec-11-flywheels-97mm-75a

The bindings are going to take some getting used to.  Getting my front foot in position to kick then slide in the bindings is a little weird but I'll get it in a couple of days.  You wanna be locked in and able to.pop the entire deck?  Get some.  https://store.freebord.com/s2-bindings/

I'll post an actual build sheet and more pics when I get some free time or home.

A couple of additions...

The reason I named it color blind is the silver deck, green wheels, red volt meter, etc.

The eBay controller is actually pretty damned good... surprisingly.  The acceleration is as smooth as a VESC but the brakes are a little squirrely.  I like being able to see the battery status with the remote.  The remote itself, while it looks similar to the nano-remote, doesn't suffer the same dropout issues and has a little better tactile response.

No clue if it'll actually last more than a day, but I'll post if it doesn't.

There's no way to do dual diagonal on the ESC right?
Where did you get those prototype **ABRC** 11 Flywheels? :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

You could extend the phase wires for one motor I guess.

I have also the Ebay ESC just to look how it performs. Are the 3 LED dots on the remote the battery left in the board or the controller battery?

I think so.  I'll run my battery down today and see for sure.

Similar thoughts here with my eBay esc- buttery smooth acceleration in beginner mode (literally from a standstill or with slight rollback) and zero dropouts or other issues thus far with the remote. I'm running the dual version with Carvon v2's and the only problematic area seems to be the brakes. If you slowly apply the brakes until the thumb trigger's fully down, the force seems to stay constant (i.e. quite light) for 3-5 seconds until it suddenly increases and fully stops the board. It's not jerky or anything, just a bit unexpected. In my experience, I'd recommend keep the remote on beginner mode; top speed appears to be quite similar, but the acceleration and breaking are vastly improved

The breaks are not great, but they aren't terrible.  They are stronger than the throttle is.  I am not running sensors yet, haven't had time to make the cables yet.  I have heard that will make a huge difference.  Ill let you know.

Did you connect to the eBay BMS?  Do a search for hall sensors, you'll figure it out quick.

From the eBay seller...

I have verified.  Fully charged the remote and board, ran the board down to 30% and then fully charged the remote,  Shows only 1 light, then fully charged the board and it shows 3 lights.

The only 2 things I would improve, in the short term, is the remote and breaks.  I would use a slightly larger remote with more travel on the throttle control (like the Benchwheel remote) and make the breaks a little less aggressive.

The ebay esc is holding up well for me...I've ridden it well beyond 20mph with a 10s3p space cell and dexters hubs. Oh i say it's almost required to add a heat sink if its hot...i covered the back of mine with little heatsinks.

I have tested this yesterday. Rode of a bridge with 2 leds on the remote left, while braking the 3th led went on so I think the esc has regenerative braking :ok_hand:

I'm really not a fan of short decks, 34 inches is about as small as I am comfortable at speed. If I ever build another sound it will likely be a single motor build at 10s, grocery store commuter.
