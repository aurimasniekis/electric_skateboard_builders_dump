I currently have an Evolve Bamboo Gt (modded by LHB) and then a dual 6374 190kv 12s beast and all I care about is my next build. I’ve always had interest in Hub motors and don’t necessarily want to break the bank on this build but would if it was worth it.

Can anyone attest to the Quad ( 2 dual esc’s ) from DIY eboard. I was wondering what kind of specs I could expect from that. Would anyone have any budget builds that would be a fun project for around $450-800. 

Would like 22+ mph (preferably 25mph)
10 mile range is all I need!

Do you want the truth or what you want to hear? lol

It's worth every penny to do a quality quad vesc (chaka 4.12 or his custom vesc, focbox, or vesc 6). Chaka does a custom quad vesc, a pretty penny, but been over 2 years, 2000 miles and still strong for me. Only recently have I had to replace a few super capacitors from broken pins, but that's more on me for the way I abuse it.

You'll get FOC (so almost no motor sound), regen brakes, and reliability. Again, not every vesc is equal. So there lies the key. I hear good things about axle vesc, but I haven't tried, so can't say.

Quad motors are great btw. It's like a 4wd car. Once you try it and really ride it, it's hard to go back.

@Mattmccrary8  I have their dual hub esc and it works pretty damn well senorless with koowheel hubs. But I'm pretty sure it will probly work better with their hubs since it's preprogrammed for it. 350w koowheel hubs vs 500w diyeboard hubs so its more power. But i do get up to 19mph and 7-9 mile range /w 10s2p full throttle half time. With 10s4p setup i basically had double distance. My wife easily gets over 24mph but scared to go faster. She weighs far less then I do though im at 180lb. I been using their dual esc  for 2 months now almost everyday and i can say for the price you can't beat it. So im pretty sure their quad esc is the same quality as their dual. I'm definitely picking one up for my next build.

QUAD VESC and FOC :heart_eyes::kissing_heart:
........:stuck_out_tongue:

Jeah: _"worth every penny_" :money_mouth_face: , tho in 2018, might we have any alternatives to your custom one still?

I thought wouldn't it be great to have a quad FOC-capable VESC which you can connect either to 1, 2 or 4 motors. 1 for like hydroplaining kiteboards n' stuff :star_struck:

I was wondering. How do you build a quad hub? you would have to buy 2 sets of hubs but then do you switch out the top part of the trucks or is there a few makers of quad hubs? I want to build a DIY quad build personally sense I saw one pull a car on YouTube.

You use 2 sets of hub motors and 4 single escs or 2 dual esc's.  Usually can bus to link each pair and split ppm to link the 4.  Or use 2 dual chinese esc with the link cabling.  I would do a completely seperate front and rear using unities and with 2 receivers and independent batteries.  Go for it.  Or buy a meepo GT

Well i cant afford the meepo GT so i will build one. I have a set of trucks coming in by the 30th. So when i have some extra cash ill get the 2 dual vescs from ebay.

I would still be very into a VESC that could do either 4, 2 or 1 motor setup with division of power. Nice universal bang for buck imho

There are plenty of dual vescs around these days. I think pretty much everyone does one.
