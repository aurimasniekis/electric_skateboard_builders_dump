I am looking for a non-flex boosted board / "Loaded" Vanguard type deck. Anyone know of anyone that's making or selling this type of deck? 38"x8.5" specifically. I would have thought with the popularity of that style there might be a plywood option out there somewhere but I am failing to find it anywhere.

Takes a couple weeks for them to make it though
