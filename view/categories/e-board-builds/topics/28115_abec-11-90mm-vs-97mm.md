Ok so I have a couple questions, where can I get my hands on the 90mm abec 11’s?

Does anyone know if evolves 97’s are just as good. I’ve been running 90 and 97 abec clones and the ride is way to rough. I need to add some butter to my rides!!!

I have some really good 90mm wheels that have great reviews. You can find them here:

Looking to buy 90-97mm wheels

I'm running a set of 97mm eBay clones and they are pretty good. I believe they were around $50. For quality reasons I'd buy the wheels @JLabs is selling though.

Yep I linked the thread with reviews (you can click on the box and it will take you to a seperate thread). I'm not sure the timeline on the new release for abec.

I heard 6 weeks until the new superfly 107mm? @ChrisChaput is the guy to ask.
I am just wearing in a brand spanking set of 97mm Abec 11s and they are certainly buttering my ride very nicely.

If that’s the case I’ll hold off on everything

If you want butter - you want the softest largest wheels you can fit.

Deck shape and wheel clearance is usually the biggest limit/issue (wheelbite sucks).

I'm a huge fan of the 75a 97mm legit flywheels.  I have clones too, and they work great for the price, but for *the best/softest/butteriest* ride you can't beat legit flywheels.  Regardless of what the clones claim - they are not as soft as the same duro flywheel.

I second that.  I've had mine for a while and they are still the nicest wheels i've ever ridden on.
