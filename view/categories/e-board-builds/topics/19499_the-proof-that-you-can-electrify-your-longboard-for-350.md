Some short facts in the beginning: This build was made by me and is (of course) improvable. After building there are some things I would change, but I‚Äôll come to this later on.
Since I am a poor student and also don‚Äôt have access to 3D printing, CNC, or other ‚Äúheavy‚Äù machines I did it really DIY style at all.
EDIT: the 350$ is without the longboard itself. You'll need some flywheel like wheels and Caliber or Paris trucks and some deck. 

So how come the 350$? Here‚Äôs my build in a nutshell:
Electronics:
Turnigy SK3 5055 430kv Brushless Outrunner Motor	------------  50$
Turnigy 5000mAh 3S 20C Lipo pack (2x, so 6S)	------------------  40$
Alien 120A 2-7S EV Mini ESC BEC	-----------------------------------65$
	Alien 2.4Ghz Electric skateboard remote control 	------------------50$
	Quanum E4 Cube 50W Balance Charger	---------------------------20$
Mechanical parts: 
	Alien motor mount with Pulley system--------------------------------120$
	Toolbox with a grab handle from a hardware store	------------------5$


Miscellaneous: these things aren‚Äôt important if you either have them already or don‚Äôt wanna buy them
	Cell (Voltage) checker							2$
	HXT4mm Battery Harness Series Cable					2$
	Electronic remote switch (LED ON/OFF)					5$
	Dual Ultra Bright LEDs (Red/white for back/front)			5$

So here‚Äôre some advantages and disadvantages of my build. 
The motor has way to less torque. It gives me great top speed but I need to push before the motor can push me. 
The tool box neither looks good nor provides good air circulation or safety for the components. Also I don‚Äôt have a switch so plugging cables is necessary.
The good points being the lightweight and the small size of the board. The motor provides amazing speeds when having enough torque! 
And, my main goal, the board is cheap but functional! If you have access to machines you can also build the enclosure and the mount by yourself to save another 60$.

Improvements: Buy a 63mm motor instead of a 50mm one
Buy a good enclosure with air circulation
A switch and charging ports would be an extra!

This is my first article, if you‚Äôve any suggestions please let me know! Pics will follow and links too if requested.

By the way I'm sorry for the "-"s being before the price, I couldn't help it. Someone please tell me how to do this properly lol :smile:

nice! Hope you enjoy your "little" buddy. Thinking about a mini build like this myself for the fun of it and for portable commuting around the lakeside. But an EMTB build sounds just oo good :slight_smile:

btw: have you ridden it already? 6s and inclines (light) sounds like something that wont happen ?!

Good Job! @Davey Nice to know that there are build options to fit any budget.
And I like the way you overlapped the shrink tube on your bullet connectors.
Now all we need is a ride along video.

The ---- dashes ----- are fine as is, if it bugs you, you can always just type in the prices first, then the description.

Nice small build. Having a small budget can do wonders on creativity.

Nice list, its pretty good.
Tbh its better to go with 63mm based motor like you said, that would be additional 20usd.
But you can have the 30usd mini remote from aliexpress therefore the cost is the same.

This build satisfy me alot at the beginning until water issues arrive, battery not big enough and lipo dying so quickly so keep those in mind :smiley: also the brakes of ESC is too loud and not so strong.

In overal this is a perfect guide for newbie to begin with, any improvements on each of the parts would be so ideal.

- Newb Alert. its 350usd without the longboard set. So in the end its still around 500usd (excl build time and tooling).

And he don't counted the shipping on it. Alien Shipping to America was 39¬£ when I bought my parts

True, Brazil is terrible to import things, My Bms and my charger are stopped at International Revenue Service (We call it Receita Federal) and I can't finish my build...
Expect have a good grade at Toefl and go to a University in Usa or other country.

probably a bit on the high side.
(not saying it wont work because I know for a fact it will)
its gonna pull some amps.

Indeed I did not. Shipping for me was 5$ from Alien power systems and I didn't calculate the shipping for every country in the world..

Oh yeah. The ESC gets warm/hot so I need to build a fan in it :wink:
After buying I read that the maximum kv you should use is like 250-300, but yeah 430 works pretty well after the start.

I have built a board with that 430kv motor as well as a 280kv motor, and the 280kv motor helps to get it moving from standstill, while the 430kv boosts up the top speed. its hecktic fast.

Tell me more about it please. So there's a 430kv one in the back and the 280kv motor in the front or both in the Back?

Ah got it - thought quanum was the remote. Sorry!
Still: The longboard costs 100$ pretty quickly (calibers 30 each plus deck and wheels)

I would definitely go with the 63mm one if I could do it again. 
The Alien Remote is really nice! Super lightweight, handy and LED ON/OFF button included. The included Lipo last quite long and the connection is steady, the trigger well functioning :heart_eyes:

The box is water and dust proof. I cut holes on the side to stick the motor cables trough. I'll use hot glue or silicone to cover the unused space. Then there won't be any dust problems. 
Lipos last surprisingly long, I can ride for 1,5h on medium speed (like 20-25kmh)!!! I don't know what you mean with the breaks being loud, but mine aren't that loud.

And thanks for the advice, I changed the title :smiley:

Hi guys, if you need high quality parts at good prices I will ship to Italy, Europe and US  
Please visit www.eskating.eu , I've just developed a new motor mount with best price of ‚Ç¨ 44.99 (Carbon Fiber components)

It's very possible. My first build was less than $300 with all brand new parts. I shopped around a lot though.

@davey they are both in the back. 
You can search UDR on this forum. Or here is a video of a drag race between it and a conventional twin 280kv board.

Just had a quick run! The battery (6S 5Ah) last pretty long, about 80 minutes! :innocent:

And I learned something: you should always have your remote fully charged. Mine was fine and the indicator said "green light" (what a pun) but the connection got weaker so I needed to sit on my board to keep it lol
