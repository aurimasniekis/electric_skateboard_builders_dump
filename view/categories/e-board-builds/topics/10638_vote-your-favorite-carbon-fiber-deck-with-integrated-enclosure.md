I have a couple of requests that I should make CF deck just like enertion's or evolve's. I love to design one and make one look at it but when it comes to the ride, it might NOT so much.it'll be stiff/hard and cracks easily with the hollow inside. 

What about the price? is it budget friendly? No. I was surprised that enertion pull it off under $400.That's only possible in China.

I'd like to hear your thoughts and who wants to pay $400 for it.

For the design,I have great ideas.

I'd gladly pay good money for a quality Carbon deck. I think enclosures are one of my weakest points when building a board. I like the idea of an integrated enclosure.

crowd source the demand for designs, there is definitely a market for this if you can pull of the production.

i really like the look of wood, which is why i'm drawn to the carbon underneath / wood on top type decks, so not sure i'd be one to buy, but hell if you make it sexy and easy and it looks like those parts, i think a lot of people would start liking CF!

Right. You have DUCATI I used to make some parts but NOT these.:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:  It shouldn't be too hard if you have the parts to make a mold from.

looks great, reminds me a lot about the alien cf deck though! what do you use for designing?

problem is that, while the board promises smooth vanguard flex purely from looks, it will be a stiff plank! you could be the worlds first to make a flexible carbon deck with incorporated battery!! for example with a segmented enclosure or front/rear compartments!

It's fusion 360 using sculpt mode.

I haven't seen alien cf deck . Do you have the link? I googled it but there are too many alien skateboards shops.

Yeah, it's definitely vanguard inspired. I like it that much.

It has to be stiff. It'll be awesome if it is flexible. I even bought the flexible resin to try.

I second LEVer. Dropthrough. 

What I would really like is some good slim CF enclosures. The size of Enertion's Space Cell is great except that it's too long if you have a smaller pack and the buttons and inputs are on the bottom instead of the side. Make 2 different sizes of streamlined CF enclosures and I'd definitely be down to drop a bill on one.

A cf version of the Jet Potato 29" with integrated enclosure would also be cool.
[/quote]

yea, I think that would be quite a hit! :sunglasses:

If I could forge my dreamboard, it would be very close to the vanguard from a flex/dimension pov, but ful topmount without bottlenose for spray/goo protection. I really like LONGboards - the further I can stand away from the trucks, the better it is for my knees! :slight_smile:

@Jinra @LEVer - Working on a 32" CF Deck. Until I have more "work space" 41" was way too big to store inventory. Hopefully shouldn't be too long though.

Tried to go smaller 28" doable but I wanted to stick with a 10s3p or 12s2p. I think 32" is a good medium.

Hope to have it a bit before Christmas. This is just a prototype so some things might change from the drawing.

@MasterCho - Nice work. More CF Decks would be awesome :) I wonder how many people would be interested in a $400 deck. Eventually, I'm sure. There will be many more options for decks as traditional longboards.

It would also be awesome to have a deck for integrated 12S3P 26650 cells. That can give you 15 Ah which would be a long range deck. And because of the length of a 12S it might be a bit more flexible than other CF boards. But maybe i am the only one who would like that.

Your design looks pretty amazing!  That said, having riden CF decks for the better part of the decade, I can tell you that pure carbon fiber boards are a poor choice for skateboards.  One of my composite decks is 100% carbon fiber and foamcore; while it is incredibly strong and responsive, it transmits all of the road vibrations, and your feet are literally numb after riding.  And this is with shock risers and plush wheels.  This was a ~$350 deck... and now it basically just sits in the corner.

Compare this to a board I ride every day... Rayne Demonseed Deelite.  It has carbon fiber stringers with fiberglass plies laid over a wood/bamboo frame with foamcore.  It is light and strong, but still has great vibration dampening characteristics.  My point here is that it is not as simple as "carbon fiber all the things!!!"

Carbon fiber is a high strength, high modulus (stiffness) material.  Using a flexible resin doesn't change these inherent properties.  You'd be better off incorporating other fabrics, such as fiberglass and kevlar, which have high strengths but lower modulus.

I agree, the Carbon Fibre decks do look awesome, but yes the properties of carbon fibre don't necessarily make it the best for riding.

This video might explain a bit more about each of the material's characteristics:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHXVf0SaJpA

I would be interested in a Basalt fibre deck with integrated enclosure if it were available...  It would look (more) like carbon, but would have properties closer to S-glass.

If this approach were taken, and depending on the how much flex the designer wanted, the battery enclosure may need to be reinforced to combat longitudinal and torsional flex. This could be done possibly by including strategically placing narrow tubes of carbon fibre, or 90 degree aluminium angle around the enclosure to maintain rigidity.

Thoughts?
```

## \#33 Posted by: MasterCho Posted at: 2016-10-05T16:17:20.102Z Reads: 588

The beauty about layering up is that you can vary the strength/stiffness in different areas with no limit.

  There are so many materials including carbon fiber with different weaves and directions that you can use to create any shape,flex, and stiffness.

It could be labor intensive process depends on how much thoughts and designs you put into it.

Why not have a lid with a rubber gasket that attaches to a lip on the edge of the enclosure area; similar to a tupperware lid. This will make it easy to remove, yet also waterproof. Not sure how easy this would be to implement though.

the board looks a little chubby! is that a 26650 version or 18650? maybe its a visual impression, because the edge doesnt appear slim, but thick & rounded like a big ship! 

I also like the more rectangular shape of the original spud, because it covers the wheels completely - a great spray- & mudguard. my rain/winter board will be my spud for that exact reason.

p.s.: im stunned by the rate of 3d art you create! youre really awesome, i guess this is actually your profession?

It was a quick mockup. You are right! it was 35mm thick :flushed:

 I always worry about wheel bite so slimmed it down. I never thought of the splash/ mudguard function.

 It is really fun doing it again I can't stop modeling!:grinning:

youre going to 3d print it first?  that sounds hard and expensive.  

how about using carbon for the board and just fiberglass for the compartment, or a blend of some sort so as to keep it flexible?

Yes. I have done it for a 22-23 inch long enclosure.

Yes Hummie, I am considering different materials as well.

I like the look of CF but to make it less stiff, I use less CF layers that means it becomes weaker (easy to crack).  Kevlar or Glass fiber is more impact resistance because less dense material .

For this enclosure I used 2 layers of Carbon/RED Kevlar cloth and one layer of the thick Glass Fiber cloth.

Then, reinforced edges and corners with another layer of Glass Fiber Cloth.

Update.
I think that the main advantage of compact deck is to be getting battery packs swapped easily. So I was thinking about using Magnets then I found a small latch that 'll be used.

I'm gonna second that. All **screws, buttons, ports, etc. should be on the bottom** or side of the board so you aren't stepping on it, but if you must put it on the top, your design looks sick. Just please don't put a power switch and battery charging port on the top, too! Leave those two on the bottom or side. Having to access the battery from the top isn't thaaat bad, just looks cleaner without any seams on top. 

That said, I WANT THAT DECK! Looks sick! WIsh it could fit 10S4P but I LOVE the shape of your design and with the wheel flares hopefully you could run outboard motors without the need for extra risers.

It would be cool if the  very ends of the board were covered or made of something other than carbon fiber so that they can get scratched. A removable/swappable piece of hard plastic that snaps on and wraps around the ends would be clever. Have the carbon be narrower there so that when the 'plastic snap on end caps' are on it fits flush all around.

Titanium or plastic would be a good material, I think. That's what rollerblade '[grind plates](https://www.google.com/search?q=grind+plate&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwik-qb6gObPAhWHsFQKHVSABzAQ_AUICSgC&biw=1435&bih=796)' are made of and those take a ton of abuse and are designed for a similar function (to get scratched). 

They could fit on like  those Dell laptop snap-on colorful cases did. However it's attached, it should be made to not alter the overall shape of the board. The board should be made 'thinner/narrower' where they attach so that when the 'grind plates' are attached on the ends of the tails, they blend into the board.

Not that you'd ever really need to replace them, but if you wanted to sell the board and make it look as fresh as possible, you could put new ones on. I imagine plastic ones would run like $15 MSRP for a pair. Production cost could be under a dollar.

If it's a spring loaded button or a tubular style lock, I'd be worried about dirt and grit getting in there and making it stick or not function smoothly. Debris interfering with a mechanism like this would only be worse if it were located on the bottom of the board.

I really like the battery display, even if it's not smart and only approximates when not under load. It's also nice to read the board's battery level without turning on the remote and syncing the two. 

I would definitely want a charging port. I'd be charging this around 5-10 times a week. Removing the battery each time would be a PITA. It'd also increase the likelihood of a user error messing up an internal component by accessing the guts so often.

The plan was that the lid is shaped in opposite direction of the concave so that once it gets pressed(flexes like spring loaded), it locks in place in the latch and sealed on the edges but I decided not to do it, I chose the safety over the convenience.

And yes, I agree that it could be interfered too. I wouldn't take the chance.

@chinzw   I  wouldn't use PLA print as a mold,in the de-molding process, It could be damaged.
It needs 3 molds, for the top,bottom and lid.  

The enclosure will be 22mm deep(thinnest I can go)

The edges/frame will be 5 mm thick all around the board(1 inch wide)with carbon fiber sheets and the rest 'll be glass fiber this means the edge is solid instead of hollow.

I don't get u. @MasterCho. You want to use ur 3D print repeatedly?  I can't imagine.  I imagine u could make a hard silicone or maybe fiberglass mold using the 3D print as the plug/pattern.  It would need some support inside maybe need to combine silicone with beams or integrate a mother mold somehow.  maybe 3 parts.   So then ud have a mold u could fill with expanding foam and make the board core and then do an infusion like you were doing before?

What are u going to do w the 3D print? 


@MasterCho a three part fiberglass mold for an infusion? I guess u haven't gotten there yet but have it planned.  If I were going to do a three part mold it would be the large mold you have with just two inserts that were removable after cured. I'm guessing that's it.  still the stretchlon covering everything like normal.  The inserts making it easier to form sharp curves for the enclosure. Maybe my strechlon isn't stretchy enough.  


I still haven't come across a really concave drop deck

Inserts maybe for drop thru holes that would go to the bottom of the mold.  I forget what model of plastic sheeting I used but with 25inh of mercury it seemed to have pulled into all the sharpest corners well but maybe inserts would be better 


My biggest worry is not getting resin to the bottom of he mold and it just carries across the top.   In my failed attempt last weekend it seemed from the top that resin had covered 3/4 of the mold but opening it up it hadn't gotten down to the core.

Maybe someone said it already but what about the carbon blocking reception? Can u simply solder on to the end to lengthen the antenna?

[quote="jmasta, post:26, topic:10638"]
having riden CF decks for the better part of the decade, I can tell you that pure carbon fiber boards are a poor choice for skateboards
[/quote]
I don't understand why everyone wants carbon fiber, when I feel the same way. Pure Carbon fiber is too stiff to me. This is why I choose to build my own hollow dual channel  deck from the ground up out of Canadian maple veneers. I'm sure you can still make an awesome board with CF. honestly, materials for a wood deck are super low. The woods only $50 and the glue is about $20. Man hours in shaping and assembling would be most of the cost in a wood deck. But it can be done, that was one of my goals to determine. One other benefit of wood decks is you can still put graphics.

Gl with the decks. I gave up enclosures at the beginning of the year, and I hope there's a trend in that direction, as I think it's less problematic and asthically more pleasing.

I haven't experienced any signal loss with CF deck and enclosures, I think because I have been using mixed materials with CF.

I assume the use of 2-3 layers of CF(200g) should be very minimal but I would avoid using a high density carbon enclosed case.

I guess most of the people want carbon because it looks so darn cool but it seems that the best for riding flex is fiberglas... I've spray painted fiberglass black and after lamination, it looks JUST LIKE carbon fiber. Helps keep the costs down, desired flex and keeps the cool factor.  just a hint...

Which 10s4p fits? Pretty sure I had compared both the Enertion and DIY 10s4p dimensions at one point and they were both a little too big in every dimension for your enclosure. 

I'm thinking of Carvon V2.5 97mm dual hub, 10s4p, dual VESCs, and your deck. All black, no belts to muck with, high top speed...seems like an ideal setup for my needs. 

Really like those car bumper/hood fasteners you found. Can't wait to see more progress on this deck!

I thought I did mention that I have decided not to use the latches this time. I need more time to test it in a real situation. The lid covers 80% of the deck, it should be securely locked in place, just 2 fasteners aren't enough and the latches swivel too.

Now, the compartment has been extended to 19 inches/490mm long without the latches in the both end.

Since it's a low profile (22mm deep) any BMS on the top of batteries might not fit on, either it should be on the side or without.

Hopefully, I can make some decent progress of it on thanksgiving week.:wink:

Very interesting project. Great work @mastercho ! Looks nice. 
It's similar to our deck that i've mentioned here: 

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/stealth-bomber-31-5-custom-deck-12s2p-26650-cell-single-carvon-v2-5-chaka-vesc/6475

We have our prototype finished, it's made in full wood+two layers of carbon fiber. We are testing now different fasteners mechanisms for the lid. Quick Latch - seems like a good option but I think we will go with push-to-turn fastener. 

I'll post more pictures of our projects in December. I am waiting for Carvon Hubs 2.5 -  to put them on for pictures. 
Our decks will be made in 28" and 33" - with two different battery compartments to choose from.

Thanks!
It's fun to see what will look like once it' done.  I think the resin works better than the primer on the printed parts, it smoothes out the surface without sanding too much and hides the lines pretty well and makes the parts stronger to work with. However, I might have to do spraying primer on the other side to avoid from the drips of resin. 

The molding process is quite easy once the prototype is done with a good finish on the surface.

It's too bad my vacation is almost over :tired_face:

it's a 3D printed custom enclosure in PLA with nuts on the inside; so no nuts will be visible on the enclosure below the deck. I just added epoxy until it's tacky, then carbon fiber... waited and then epoxy. I could have used my vacuum pump to limit the epoxy quantity but in fact I managed to get only the necessary epoxy; so I'm not adding so much weight. 

I just did that for my upcoming Bustin Bonsai Cruiser on 76mm Amhyowheels Akashas.

just got a few minutes to quickly sand the enclosure. It's not finished yet, but the result is encouraging. I could continue sanding and get a new epoxy coat to have a glassy finish... or just go for the gloss varnish...!

Thanks for asking.
I am waiting for the weather to warm up here in Chicago so that I can work on the molding process in the garage. The room temperature could be critical for curing the resin; I will be using polyester resin, which has harmful fumes. Because of this, my garage is an ideal place for this process. But since it's been around 40 degrees in my garage and 20 degrees outside, I can't really work on it. I need the temperature to be at 70 degrees for at least two days for the resin to cure. Unless, of course, I get an oven for it.

Wow, so glad I discovered this thread. You guys are doing amazing work. And I just ordered a Jet Potato 29" deck a few days ago, it's a sexy little board. Can't wait to see more.

have a meb s, and TB carbon deck.. i like the meb s, but it cannot fit focbox, or tb vesc.. its my favorite board and has a great ride feel,  but b/c of size i will have to wait to get an esc that will fit.. the TB carbon is an amazing board as well.. plenty of room for whatever you want.. the only issues i had were me as a crappy builder, need wide trucks also.. =3

Trampa is very tight lipped about they composite they use in their decks; so your guess is as good as mine.:confounded:
