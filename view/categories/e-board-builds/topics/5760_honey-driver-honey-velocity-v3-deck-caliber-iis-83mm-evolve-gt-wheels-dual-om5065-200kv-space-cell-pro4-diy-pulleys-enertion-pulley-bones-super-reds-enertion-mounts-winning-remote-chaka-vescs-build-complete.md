Since I finally got all my parts besides the Space Cell, I've decided to start my build log. The board will have both VESCs in the back per the available space in the Space Cell and have a 5.5mm extension wire that goes to the front motor. The extension is currently a bit long as you can see, so I may try to cut and resolder the leads.

I'll be using the 83mm Evolve GT wheels if my pulleys come in time, otherwise I'll stick to my kegels for now (FYI if you like kegels but have ABEC pulleys the contact pitch of the GT wheels is the same! Pretty much the same wheel with different spokes). 

I'm missing keys for my motor and am not 100% sure how I'm going to attach the pulley yet. I do have a dremel so I may drill a small notch on the shaft for the grub screws on the pulley to fit; though this sounds difficult. I may also need to do the same thing on the trucks for the motor mount.

@Kaly's deal was too good to pass up, so I thought I'd snag one to see if I like it. I originally got the Benchwheel one which is the one I'll probably use since it has a 800mah battery vs winning's 500.

The mount is literally as close as it can be as the carbon fiber plate is already hitting the trucks which is perfect as the belt is firm, yet spongy in tension.

As per @whitepony's suggestion, I've reversed the pulley and plan to (somehow) drill a little notch into the motor shaft for the grub screw. Will also be getting keys for it. I've also used a dremel to drill a little notch in the hanger for the mount's grub screw as well and loctited the mount to the trucks.

Sorry for being a complete ignoramous but help me understand why you're drilling into the motor shaft? Is the pulley from @torqueboards not a simple plug and play (or slipon and tighten) with the OM motor? The mechanics of this situation escape me. I'm planning on going single motor 12mm so wondering if I'll be up against the same challenge

The key will help the pulley rotate with the shaft, however it's not secured from sliding around the shaft (toward/away from the motor) so I'd like to drill a small notch for the grub screw to sit so it doesn't slide around. At least, unless someone tells me it's not necessary :P

You mean grinding the trucks for the Enertion pulley? Or for the mount's grub screw? I haven't received my Enertion pulley's yet so I'm using Kegels w/DIY's mount that doesn't need truck modification. As for the grub screw I just stuck my dremel down the hole on the mount (see pic) and drilled a little bit, took off the mount and continued drilling until the grub screw sank into the hole just a little bit (about 1mm).

10-4 on the grub. Since im going monodrive and 12mm belt I've read and seen in a video elsewhere on the interwebs that the 3D printed pulley screws thru the kegel 80mm require grinding the caliber shaft a bit otherwise the Bolts of the pulley will rub. Unfortunately DIY doesn't yet have a 12mm pulley available for those wheels. Pretty tough to find actually

@Jinra  why did you choose the enertion mounts for your build?? also exactly which wheel pulley are you using enertion or diy, and if enertion why? because im trying to avoid those because of mod needed which im not a fan off doing also where did you get your motor pulley from 

i ask all this because all im missing is my pulleys and mounts

im thinking diy pulleys with psycho mounts but arent sure atm i think enertion costs more due to shipping atm

enertion's mounts are a bit lighter because they're half carbon fiber and they fit 50mm motors. I currently have diy wheel pulleys for kegels but will probably switch to enertion's and chop my trucks because i want to use my 83mm wheels and the pulley is a lighter plastic.

it works, it's just a little small so it's not a snug fit, but it does what it's supposed to. If you can find 3mm square stock, I imagine that would fit even better.

Small update,

I felt the center distance was a bit too tight for the belts, but the mounting bracket was already hitting the trucks, so I decided to grind down some of the hangar to give 1-2mm for the mounting bracket and ease up the belt tension.

Perfect!

I also decided to try my hand at getting the sensors working since chaka doesn't offer his adapter yet and I found super cheaper JST 5-pin headers on [ebay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/131589536983?_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2648&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT)

I soldered the headers and connected it to the motors and it works great! The only problem was that the VESC has 6 pins on its hall encoder header (6th pin is Temperature which doesn't exist on the motors). So I took the power pin off the JST plug and placed it directly into the 5v pin and plugged the JST header to the corresponding pins on the VESC. It's hard to explain but see this pic:

As for the front motor, I needed to extend the sensor wires so I stripped a CAT6 (maybe CAT5E) cable and soldered them to the JST wires. The colors didn't line up so I tried my best with this...

1. i believe it was 1/4th inch. Don't make the same mistake as me and try to widen it much further. My holes are a little loose (that's what she said) and the nut doesn't grip the wood very well. I'm going to fix this with wood glue.

2. No thread locker, it has enough tension i think, plus I'll be opening it up to tinker.

3. I just bent them lol. Like i said silicone wire is very flexy.

Took the board for my commute to work today (~4 miles). It's been great, but tougher to handle than my GT; though this is probably due to me not being used to it yet. Acceleration is amazing and braking is better than my GT. Top speed is definitely higher as well.

I had an issue where the remote would seemingly cut out for a couple seconds, then start working again. I'm not sure if this is a connection issue, or if there's some fault in the VESC or maybe it's rebooting for some reason. I'll have to investigate this further. It only happened twice. I'm not sure if it's related to me using 43v as max input voltage, but I doubt it.

Settings for those curious

I'm using the winning remote at the moment. I ride a lot of hills and through a ton of wind on my way back, but I'd say 12 miles through all that. However! I was accidentally running sensored instead of hybrid, so I'll probably have better range now that i switched it.

What kind of range do you get on your GT doing similar riding?

I'm kind of surprised to hear you say the estimated range on your build is only 12 miles.

Also, how do you like the Calibers vs dual kingpin?

## \#50 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2016-07-30T04:16:16.220Z Reads: 586

```
Well i went 3.7 + 3.8 + .4 + .4 miles and ended with 32% battery which is 8.3. After the math I should get 12.2 miles for 100% of the battery. However, like I said, I went through a lot of hills and heavy wind resistance so that's not surprising. I also, ran on sensored the entire time which is inefficient at high speeds Who knows how much I would get on flat ground running hybrid mode.

My GT gets about the same, but it's hard to tell since the battery meter on the GT is very bias and doesn't reflect real world value. 100% to 90% drops very slowly (99% after 4 miles), but after 90 it goes to 60-70 a bit faster, then after that it drops very fast (especially after 40%). I'd compare it to the range I've been getting thus far on my board.

I love the dual kingpin on the GT, it makes turns very pleasant and I have had zero trouble controlling it at high speeds. However, my DIY board goes much faster than the GT so I think I like the stability of calibers for my DIY. One thing I do miss about the trucks is the length. My GT's trucks are a whole 5-7cm wider and it makes for much more confident turns. I sometimes feel like I'm going to topple over on my DIY when turning too aggressively.

I took it for a test run in hybrid and no more cut out issues! Hopefully this has been resolved for future, longer runs. I guess running full sensored at high speeds causes the VESC to freak out and reboot or something.

Yep seems perfect for this board. The only problem was some of the weather seal got completed shredded when i drilled through it. Not a big deal, next time I'll hole punch it before drilling :P

Hurray, cut out issue *seems* to be fixed (knock on board). However, I had a scary incident today where my brakes wouldn't respond, then the board accelerated by itself for a second. Had to hop off but didn't fall.

Anyone know what might've caused that? Currently using the winning remote and I've set the min/max pulsewidth correctly. Running "Current" mode. Safe start and median filter both checked.

I had my board accelerate on its own yesterday at around 20mph and didn't feel i could slow it down so bailed before it got going too fast. Made it two steps and then rolled on to the pavement, scrapped up the elbows pretty bad. Thankfully had helmet on.

Here's a video of my ride home at about 70-60% battery. I was going against some pretty strong head wind and didn't full throttle too much since it's a biking trail and both my hands are full. Sorry for the shakiness, hard to keep it stable.

EDIT: did some maths. My board's top speed (weighted) is 31.6 mph at full charge which drops down to 27mph at nominal voltage. I'm 79kg/175lbs.

It was around half throttle, but there's no difference between half and full at that point since the supplied current is already maximizing efficiency. I'm thinking of ways to bring the top speed to 32mph, but i'm not sure how I want to achieve this yet.

Hey @jinra we're about the same weight -- just got back from pushing my board around the area. It's about 75 degrees down here at the beach today. I found a nice long hill to test the setup at speed and I kinda got the wobbles a bit going fast. I've cranked the kingpin down a few times since I got the board but I was wondering if you eneded up putting different bushings than stock in your calibers?

I actually got these because they're super hard.

Though I still leave a bit of turni-ness in my trucks. Keep in mind some of it is just natural control you'll learn. I'm sure I would've been fine at 29mph with my stock bushings as well. I was okay going 27mph on my dual kingpin trucks on my GT. Also, when you start getting the wobbles, it's better to speed up than slow down as slowing down tends to exacerbate the problem.

I've always liked the high rebound bushings from Venom/Riptide/BloodOrange.  Each have something like this chart to help you get the right bushing for your weight:

I like this chart since it gives you some setups not just duro hardness of bushings - i like a elim/chubby on bottom and barrel or cone on top (i'm a heavy bastard at 265/120kg).

After a weekend of riding, I can confidently say my cut out issues have been solved. Thinking back I think some of the issues were due to the CAN cable coming loose, I just gave up trying to position them just right and soldered them on with some heatshrink. Added ferrite rings for the CAN cable, receiver cable, and front sensor wires for good measure.

Sorry for the thread hijack @Jinra!  Great build and love the pics of your setup w/ canbus.

@t1m0007 - a huge difference.  Depending on the setup i usually do a barrel or elim on bottom (board side), and a lighter weight duro on top for a bit easier turn, but the high rebound duro bushings really help bring it back to center easily.  Top i go barrel or cone if i want a lot easier turn.

that and carrying a skate tool so that as you get going faster you can stop and tighten down if too loose.  Not much of an issue on a skateboard, but i've found that really helpful on e-boards where the speed range is so much bigger (cruising at 5-10mph vs hauling ass at 20+ - all on the same setup).

Bad news! Soldering the CAN cable worked well.. too well. The cable ended up bending my CAN pins from being stuck in that small enclosure and it ripped off two whole pins on the slave VESC! I've now given up on the CAN and am using my second PWM output on my receiver to go direct into the second VESC, hope this works out better :slight_smile:

2 rows for 2 PWM signals! (No worries that ferrite ring is now properly insulated and added some padding on the receiver so the ring doesn't smack it)

Also, one of my OM5065 motors has been giving off a weird scratchy sound when it spins. I ordered another one from chaka as a replacement and backup and will get this one fixed/replaced!

A word of warning for speedsters and dragsters. I was racing @evoheyax this past Sunday and we full throttled it to compare acceleration and speed. Unfortunately, the fuse on the Space Cell blew and sent me flying. I always suspected the fuse seemed a little small ever since I got it and now my suspicions are confirmed! I'd feel much safer with a 60-80A fuse on there, but unfortunately 40A is the biggest fuse for the size. I decided to chop off the fuse and run fuseless for now.  Interestingly enough, I've climbed some very steep hills for a long period of time and never blew the fuse. The thing that finally did it seemed to just be hard acceleration.

Max speed doesn't take as much current as steep hills and hard acceleration. I'd say just avoid blasting the throttle from slow speeds and avoid very steep hills. My primary recommendation is to just get a larger fuse holder that can hold a 60A+ fuse (I'd use 80A myself). You can also get rid of the fuse altogether. That's the route I went, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.

Hey @Jinra, sick build! Its a great reference for my build. 

When you setup your motors for sensored (accidentally) and then hybrid. Did you use VESC's motor detection tool? Also how did you determine the wiring for sensored mode (BLDC's 3 wires)? Thanks!
```

---
## \#91 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2016-11-04T01:57:31.423Z Reads: 338

Yea you have to do motor detection to get the integrator limit and bemf coupling parameters, along with sensor orientation. Order of the phase and sensor wires doesn't matter as long as it's spinning the right way and you do detection for the sensors. There are 3 combinations of phase wires that will make it spin one way and 3 that will make it spin the other.

Hi, I know it's a build of 2 years ago but I was wondering do you know if the order for the hall sensor cables matter?

I know that on the VESC one pin is for temperature (I guess Maytech has the same order than yours since is 4.12 hardware version) and I have to leave it empty since I do not have the temperature sensor.
