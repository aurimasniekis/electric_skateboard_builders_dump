Hi everyone. 

I am on the look for a deck for my new board build. I will be using the deck with a dual motor setup on 218mm tourqeboard trucks with 6 inch Wheels.

I really like the Evolve deck types. But i am looking for something either custom build (with battery room and such) or a standard but nice deck with good price 

i live in denmark in EU

Trampas are HUGE, but also cool

For that 150 you`ll get an totally awesome deck, for a reasonable price in my eyes. Trampa has nothing similar in this category...

150 for a deck sounds fair in my books, the decks i run are around 200 - 300 for something like that.

If your lucky you could find a really cheap Evolve Bamboo GT Deck and maybe even an enclosure and add some foam to it, i paid 110 for mine and already had the foam to extend it with.

Pretty cheap

It will be about 160€ wich is a good price for a deck with this class.

That figure includes the enclosure it's a very good price, less than a commercial deck alone
