Hi everyone!

I've wanted to build a electric long board for a few years, and now that I'm headed off to college I figured it was time.  This is my first build, so if you could check over my parts list to make sure everything is compatible/decent that'd be awesome (prices are shipped).  I know there are a TON of first build posts, but I've done a bunch of research and just need some feedback before I order.  I've seen a few first-build horror stories.

I'm trying to spend around $250 to see if I like esk8ing (I already have batteries, a motor, charger, connectors/wire, etc. since my dad was in to RC planes).  Since I'll mainly use this board in college, I wanted it to be small (32" deck).  I'll be running at 12s.  I also have a few questions at the end.  Thank you!

**Extras:**  key ignition? would be cool, truck tool($3), batt. level indicator($4)

**TOTAL:** ~$241

**Questions:**
1) Is 32" too short of a board?  The wheel base is only 19" and I know they get wobbly at high speeds.

2) What length belt should I buy so that I can experiment with pulley ratios but will still work with the HK motor mount?  255? 265? etc.

3) How fast should I gear it for?  Considering I'll be on a college campus and riding through town, should I shoot for around 25 mph (40 km/h) max?

4) Can I save money anywhere?  Other part recommendations are appreciated if there is a better bang-for-buck.

5) Should I go with 50° or 44° trucks?

Thanks in advance everyone!  Love this community. I will definitely document the process and post as I go.  Also I have a 3D printer/know how to use CAD so if anyone needs something printed PM me.

1-you'll hit erpm limit and ruin your esc. Either get a lower KV motor or go 6s.
2-for HK mount I suggest going with their trucks, just upgrade the bushings to your liking.
3-get bigger wheels, 90/97 from AliExpress fit around 35$. I have a link of you want.
4- go with mini remote, it's reliable and cheaper.
5-you don't want to ride 40km/h at your campus with such short deck. Dangerous

1) Oh yeah I forgot about that.  I'm worried about not having enough torque / the higher amperage running through the system.  I'll try 6s out and if I like esk8ing enough I'll buy a lower kv motor.  
2) Their trucks are out of stock.  Will the motor mount not work with calibers?
3) Bigger wheels = higher speed but yeah I'll take a look if you want to send the link.  What's the reason behind bigger wheels?  Nicer ride?
4) Link?  I could only find them for about the same price as the GT2B
5) 30km/h better?

I have a topic where I show that it doesn't work on Calibers for me.
[Here](7.25inch Black Skateboard Trucks Aluminium Longboard Bridge Skateboard Parts Skate Board Trucks  http://s.aliexpress.com/z67n2IVj?fromSns=Copy to Clipboard) should be the same ones.
Bigger wheels, better and safer ride.

Don't limit the speed, just try what is comfortable for you

Actually you can try @dickyho new mount for Paris /clones trucks but idk if you need to file them a bit.

Thanks for the advice @Grozniy , I found some cheaper 97mm wheels that I'll get instead and decided to 3D print a motor mount to fit the calibers.  I'll reinforce it with metal rods.  Also will be ordering the mini remote
