Hey e-riderz !!

Another one :blush: 

Because I'm a fan of Hamboard and have always wanted one, it would be even better to make it and electric!

The main idea ... I just want to enjoy cruiser, carver, surf cushy from time to time. Without constraint with the big unevenness by here, or during passage on roads more disgusting ...
I hesitated for size and shape and then I said, go make yourself happy guy !!! (I always could re-shape step by step, test ride after test ride).

**The setup:**

_Deck:_ Custom style surf 70s, fishtail - size: 59 "x 17.7" is 150 x 45 cm
_Trucks:_ Evolve Supercarve - custom bushings setup
_Wheels:_ ABEC11 Flywheels 107mm 74A black
_Transmission:_ Evolve Wheel Driver 38T x 15T
_Motor mount:_ Evolve at the rear/custom at the front
_Motor:_ Racerstar 5065 140kv 
_ESC:_ VESCs ... dual FSESC4.20 
_Batteries:_ Graphene 10s 5Ah 45C
_Remote:_ GT2B mod Madmonkey

**What comes out of it:**
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/capturesurfmad.jpg?w=720
Looks perfectly cool, and I certainly could set up the FSESC parameter cool and low..

In the end it's really great to work! It feels like shaping his wooden surf at the old school: Mrgreen: **I took a lot of fun!!!**
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/img_20180803_192257l.jpg
The deck is composed of 10 folds of laminated Okoume (outside). **General Shape directly inspired by the Hamboard Fish**. In addition to a string of 5 additional plies and 30mm thick riser pads to make room for the carve with the huge mega wide fat flat deck, the flexibility of the Supercarve and the big wheels 107. All go!

The **front custom mounts**, I drew them for the occasion, because besides not wanting to expose them with the engines like front bumper (if I took the evolve mounts standard), I also have the constraints quoted at so it must be far from the deck, but far from the ground anyway!
With the double bushing it's a pretty long plate anyway ...

Just received the Dual & Mini FSESC 4.20 : 
https://youtu.be/BpDI-VHIQt4

As always for the moment what holds the build is the enclosure ... under this liner!
Already a little one take me so much time to set up :smile: , there I feel like if I was making a boat hull: lol:
I was looking for a new fiber to test, I will try **Basalt fiber**.
I will probably head to a pack Graphene 12s 16Ah 30C (yum!) ...

Just to have an idea, with a 35 ° LONG TRAMPA Mountianboard Deck (total length tips to tips 960mm) : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/img_20180825_191953l.jpg?w=720

BTW, the setup will be **AWD** :star_struck: My 1st !!!

Thank guyz !!!

I will really start next week, I make some little vid to show the FSESC 1st overview in hand (like the one in the 1st post, I edited the insta video for a better youtube review/unpacking :blush: ).

https://youtu.be/P-4u8C89qmc

I polish the board, it gives him even more relief ! Beautiful !!
But I got some research work to do, I have to think about the grip-tape ... and also the enclosure !!... Hard time here :smile:
 
But this WE I got the rebuild of the Darth Vapor for the sailing..!

Hey e-riderz !

Hooo, I got a so good feeling on this ... 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/img_20180911_171504l.jpg

So, ok, after 3 pack battery, I think I find a "good" setting for the dual FSESC 4.20...
On 10s, with 20A motor and batt max, 90 absolute Max in BLDC, I got no problem, no faults, no heat :blush: haha easy ! And no sensor on the slave, switch motor make the same result, weird.
...But can't wait for the AWD set! Actually, it needs to much full throttle :smile: And I need more ass kicking !!!

https://youtu.be/xOmKXNf4hME

The 1st ride (see below), set to 40A motor max and 30 batt max, I got OVER CURRENT.
At 30 motor max and 20 batt max, got over current too. Sometimes but only uphill at 25A.
And with 20A is ok, no more faults, I make a full battery a with this setup tonight, fine. And I will continue all the WE. it's really a shame cause there is a big difference with just 10a. 30a feel better but need to ride really cool and so you don't passe any uphill whitout over current...

Just still got Metr.Pro disconnection: I make a ride of more than 12km and it records only 3.7km...?
https://metr.at/r/C3mDk
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/screenshot_20180914-205106__0a.jpg
I see that when my phone has updated, the parameter for the "battery save" was reactivated, so I put it off again.
But ... the apps still continue to disconnect ... Maybe you got another idea @rpasichnyk ?  (I have share you my log).
It's set on my slave.

And here you could see the 1st ride, with some OVER CURRENT ... In just 300m I got 2 alerts, and during the 1st ride more than maybe 10 faults ...
https://youtu.be/N4MDDkcgLOg
https://metr.at/r/Py3CR
So I will not recommend you using the dual FSESC for an uphill or crazy powerful setup.
Maybe it's a good option for the little dual hub or smaller motor like this 5065 for a cruising board (or an eco / long range setup...). OR AN AWD !

thanks for sharing the videos!

Can you snap some pics of your truck and risers ? How loose can you go without wheel bite? 
I love the surfboard setup. Inspired to build myself a fish too!

Thanks mate !

I have a picture of the bottom,.. not the best for seeing rise, I would do another tomorrow, but I'm ashamed, it's done with the tear (sorry don't know if that expression means something in english) I do not have enclosure and everything is placed underneath without finishing ...
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/img_20180911_171556l.jpg
I made sure to not have wheelbite, and the radius of plating is pretty amazing! I can turn around in a street, I'll do a little video of that :blush: 
For those who may be interested, I have made a jpeg on scale to print :wink::point_right: [**here**](https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/surfish.jpg)

I have made something like this for the front trucks, so I could reverse the mount :

Do you have to halve the values of battery min and max because you are running dual? Maybe that's why it's causing the over current error code? I know it's required fro TB vesc running in dual but I'm not familiar with FSESC4.20's settings.

Hey e-riders !

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/snapshot_22.png
More ride this WE, yesterday it record nothing ... Today I got the only 2.27km (cause I think about stopping the run before entering a shop). Then it restart correctly, I made my ride then arrived to house, check the apps, I see that it was not "open" (apps restart or something like that) and the module passed to "connected" (when he was already there and started it at the start of the run) so I know it records nothing ... once again ... and no record recorded again GRRRR
https://metr.at/r/OLwiw

**Pleeaaaaaze e-riderz I need help !!** I disable the battery saver as well as the app saver in background, all,... I think I try all... And all I want is to could rec. my ride :pray:

@rpasichnyk , I share you my log ;) 

**If someone got the same experience and find the good way to go please share me !!!** :blush:

:v: :sunny: have a nice day all !

Sorry 3B6 ! I missed to answer you ...
Hum ... don't know actually if it's dual problem, but I'm installing two Mini FSESC now to test it so I will see if it's a dual problem or anytime with the 4.20 HW.

Hey e-riders,

So, I try .... hoho I try !!... But nothing work ... in CAN, I can't run dual, and one won't pass sensor detection.

So I reinstall the dual, and at the last I made and will made I guess, it faults again !
This time it Overcurrent in dowhill when I was braking ...
It was super scary ... I taste a bit the ground but all good !!!

Did someone could help me reading and understand the log here?
https://metr.at/r/ibcSQ
I was braking and suddenly it passes from -38 to +50A ? for the dual set at 20A Motor and batt max itch? :thinking:

Thanks for your help !

I will try FOC I guess regarding to all the user using it with apparently pb ... But I got many uphill around here and with dual 5065 you play more with the triger I guess ... (reminder : 10s5Ah - Dual 5065 140kv - 15 x 38 T 15mm belts - 107mm ...)

I looking to find my old iPhone5 to maybe get Metr.At work one day ... cause I make pretty stressed test, so sad to can't share it. I faults I got are not recorded, got to recreate the situation and abuse a bit ^^

Hi e-riderz :wave:

Got my Phone not crashing Metr.at anymore! So will make full ride report soon :blush: Thanks to the community Roman and Hexacopter and Surfer from his good tips !!! 
**Lock Metr.at apps on Android if you encounter some issue with no recorded ride** ;)  
https://metr.at/r/ZvL4k

It needs to be ridden pretty coolly for not faulted but it's still cool to get a soft board.
I'm sure we will find a way to ride it definitely safe soon ;) 

Bonus today :smile: a little vid !

:upside_down_face: ...but my eMTBoard miss me a bit :sweat_smile: or the power.

I guess it is the end of this big surf-skate deck for this year!
I'm going to split it and upgrade some part for the winter season :

1. Lighter and more flexy deck > I'm thinking about my Arbor Axis Koa
2. Change the flywheels for air tire > Superstar hub and as usual coupled with Primo Stricker 8" ... maybe 7" roadies to lower it, I have to test.
3. Find the good deal by BoardBumper for : 2x gear 66T + 2x belt + 4x standard longboard bearing hub adapter for Superstar rim. All around 50/55€ at elektro-skateboard.de 
4. Change this Dual 4.20 and set 2x new 4.12 vesc
5. Now I may need an enclosure ^^ 

Photo and rebuild to come :v: ;) 
Good WE & Good Ride !

Hi e-riders !

Ok, so... It almost looks just like I want (except there is still no enclosure ^^) 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/img_201016_1373.jpg
But I'm a bit disappointed here :unamused:

I would like to upgrade from urethane wheel to air tire,
so I buy this BoardBumper kit and well follow [the video setup](https://www.boardbumpersshop.com/installation-videos) (even if I'm not at my 1st build :blush: I am a good student!).
But nothing goes easy or aligned correctly with itch other or spin round or fit well.

The wheels bearing aren't sitting properly in this plastic adapter and there is only some mm sit and the end of the bearing is just not supported (in the bearing adapter) ... weird!
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/rps20181017_032702.jpg
you could see the gap
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/rps20181017_124606-e1539773343843.jpg
You can make the rim not spinning around on the trucks just by hand, so I couldn't imagine when you ride on it :scream_cat:  

When you set the wheel drive is not and can't be aligned to motor gear, due to design :
 - Cause this little 5065 motor got an hole (not keyway) to set the grub-screw in place and hold the motorgear fix on the saft.
 - Then the wheeldrive that come on the 10mm axel of the Supercarve hanger can't be moving forward more than that on the hanger.

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/rps20181017_124537.jpg

I set all like in the vid, then make the wheels spin freely and shaking everywhere making the board bounce ^^
**Belt move and come naturally in place, but not the good one** : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/rps20181017_032729.jpg
same on the other side :disappointed_relieved:
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/rps20181017_032753.jpg
Always **got 3-4mm of the belt outside the wheeldrive** ... 
And **it start to rub against the collar of the pinion (sprocket) and the mount** ...
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/rps20181017_124556-e1539773331196.jpg
But here I could solve the issue with another motorgear.

Another big problem with it ... **the tension of the belt is no longer adjustable !!!**
the motor gear is to close to the wheel drive and there is no space to adjust it. Really weird for a AT kit (even if there is many tooth engage) !

I guess this isn't ridable.

I let the dealer shop and BoardBumper know about the issue, and the response is :

> _The customer has the gear spaced to far out. It should be aligned with the motor gear. He needs to remove some spacers behind the drive gear bearing._

haha :rofl:... yes, it's why I emailed us ... and like shown in the picture above ( and that I joined them) there is nothing removable to make some more space from the wheel side.

> _Also the aftermarket motors and motor gear he is using has different gear placement compared to stock motors and out motors. It causes the motor gear to sit to close to the motor mount. This causes issues trying to align the motor gear with the drive gear. For the belt to run true they must be perfectly aligned with one other._

Ok, so that I already know > to change my motorgear but nothing about belt tensioning.

I got no problem with the Evolve street kit, 38T wheel drive this this same Evolve-like setup...

Did Evolve motor get a long shaft and a keyway? Can one adjust the alignment of the pinion on the motor axis/shaft with the 66T AT kit? Make the belt tensioning possible?

I answer them, since no news, I transferred again my email back on Wednesday.
Plus they did not respond to my cancellation request. 

This kit just didn't worth it ... 
I make 5km and the belt shred so much that it brake, let me go home with one little motor and the other one spinning freely (yes, I know, I wouldn't walk all the way and it was the slave motor).
I will put my 107mm back !

too bad :v: :tired_face: I really like how it was looking ...

My bad, I shouldn't give a try without changing the motorgear... I was wishing I could swap wheel/belt like on an Evolve setup without some other custom. I couldn't wait to ride a bit AT. But I should! Now I have to order another belt or ...
Maybe got some ideas for the futur :blush:

Hey e-riders !

So, I put the old setup of MADSURFER on the arbor because **I needed my ride dose** : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/img_201cvb.jpg

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/img_201df.jpg

I wasn't able to do the same full-throttle ride as on the big super long flat hard-stick custom deck of the MADSURFER ... and **I seriously miss space on this 40" deck** :smile: I'm kidding (a bit) . .
 But it's a lot more transportable now and feels a lot cooler for my feet with the shaped deck and for my knees with the flex!
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/img_201sd.jpg
Also, I now ride with 30/-25 Motor and 30/-25 Batt (Max/min), going easy on the throttle when going uphill and it's all good with the Dual 4.20 (and I find a bit more fun with this little extra power ^^).

And I don't loose time after the fail of the AT version, I come back to my actual fav transmission : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/img_2018_17510_1.jpg

**I just really need my custom mount more than ever now!** To make this fit :P 

[quote="Riako, post:10, topic:67049"]
I have made something like this for the front trucks, so I could reverse the mount :
[ ![|690x388](https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/aamadmount.png?w=720)](https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/aamadmount.png?w=720)
[/quote]
It should more look like this : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/evolmount_20_02-00_customiz57044829.jpg
A little bit heavier than the 1st version posted, raw finish, no chamfer/filet or anodization. But style adjustable, reversible and for 50/63mm motors.

And I come out of an old project that I had teased for a while in _No World Only Pic Topic_ To mount longboard type bearings (22mm) on superstar rims (28mm).
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/img_201020a.jpg
Still a little DIY on it (need to adjust a side of my adaptor ... maybe I will put it on a motor then spin it and try to sand at the same time ...), **just need like a slight bore but outside and it will soon fit the hub I hope!**

Good WE all :v:

Hey Jerry,
Nice, you should love it as me iI guess if you think about electrifiy it (I :zap: mine after a summer of push in drop-through mode with Caliber and 62mm I guess).

I mount it topmount for now because the Supercarve trucks + Evolve motormount + this front and back (tail+noze) deck make "motorbits".
Now I should not get this issues anymore with my custom mount (:crossed_fingers:)

Before that I try Maytech hub & Ronin truck on it :

Lot of space under the drop-through + 42.5° CRonin + 90mm wheel :

_Edit : I think maybe I should start an other Topic to let this MAD SURFER on topic ? (as I prepare a completely different setup in the end ... And the MAD SURFER will see the day again in the spring season !)_

For the motor shaft, since it has a groove for the set screw, why dont you use a dremel like tool and grind a little of the shaft till it gets a little flat so you can move the motor pulley either direction and then the set screw will sit against the flat part of the shaft.![image|499x499](upload://pOphyCbf0Hr1wqqonqt35aC4F9B.jpeg) ![image|499x499](upload://pE8fncwv5EYWmw1DGsewZjeBfGm.jpeg)

 I say I should stop posting here, but I'm a bit lazy this WE ... :blush: 
 
Just a little vid about the AT setup, before the upgrade :blush:

@Tampaesk8er , thanks for your feedback mate ! I don't have a photo I think, but the 5065 motors already got this little flat along the shaft. It is my bad, I did not move places and so it breaks the belt under 5km ... I was lazy, thinking I could swap wheels like on an Evolve setup I guess :smile: Nevermind, with chain it should be aaallllllllll goooood !
 
I'm moving place right now, so I'm a little lost in my stuff, but **I have my custom mount !**! :yum: ! I will show you at the end of the day !
But I will install them the next Weekend now ... :v:

Hi e-riders !

To start :blush: Another pic of the actual daily setup : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/img_2014_1729.jpg
So far so good for cruising and carving around.
But I will put everything back in order as in the beginning and just keep the awesome and funny setup of the MAD SURFER like my last urethane wheel setup (until next summer).

Ok so, that's it, I moved!.. still a lot of boxes to unwrap, re-arrange and organize :sweat_smile: 
(But still a lot of Home stuff to do)

Also, as I said : 
https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/img_201_2017.jpg

I could now if wanted :

1. Set the MAD SURFER in AWD/4WD mode as it was originally planned, with the reversed mount for the front and not expose motors as a bumper.

2. Or just pass to 63mm motors ...

3. Or set my Overion 36T iso 06B chain, with AT wheels on the Supercarve truck.

So, as already said I will let the MADSURFER as it was, simple & good enough for cool cruising :

The move revealed to me tonnes of stuff that I would like to reuse for the season coming.
Also, I need mooore power/fun! And I want to know, how this Arbor Axis could be ridden and looks with MTB trucks, now I have my 30° riser-pads ready!!
Still got the new DarthVapor/NoNameYet to finish ... :exploding_head: ... haha so much to do but moving is so fun too, I got an entire region to re-explore after that :blush: !!! 

to follow ...
