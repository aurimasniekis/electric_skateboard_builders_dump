Hi everyone!

Fist of all excuse my english please.

I'm form Spain and want to share my experience. After reading and reading y i feel (almost) ready tu build my own e-board.
Thanks to everybody in this forum!!

I have learned a lot here but **I need help with batteries and charger**. 



PARTS:
**DESK**: I'm going to use my cheap longboard ([Madrid Weezer](http://www.euroskateshop.es/shop/madrid-weezer-collage-3918p.html))
**MOTOR, TRUCKS, WHEELS, MOTOR MOUNT**: [Enertion kit](http://www.enertionboards.com/diy-electric-skateboard-kits/single-motor-mount-pro-kit-plus/). I think motor is 190Kv
**VESC**: from [esk8.de](http://esk8.de/)
**REMOTE**: Niko Kama
**BATTERY**: [Zippy 5s 8000mAh] (http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__38302__ZIPPY_Flightmax_8000mAh_5S1P_30C_EU_Warehouse_.html) x2. 10s in serial
**CHARGER**: I don't know. Could you help me please? Something about 40€ would work?

How should i charge the batteries? Could I charge both batteries with the same charger? I didn't find posts with tutorials about it.
Of course, I want to make it safety, so i have this link to make a [loop key](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/how-to-anti-spark-xt-90-loop-key/204). I'm not sure what it does. Prevent Sparks? What sparks? when turn it on/off? I need something more to make it safety? _EDIT: I must add a fuse too?_

I'm waiting for parts to arrive. Thanks to you again!!

To be updated ;D

Buenas, supongo que hablas castellano, pero un buen cargador que te recomiendo es este

@ArmandR De precio está perfecto! Sabes si con ese cargador puedo cargar las dos baterias en serie a la vez?  O cargo primero una y luego otra?
Thanks!!

The one you linked is not a Nyko Kama and is likely to not work with the VESC as a remote

[/quote]

When you will plug in a >6S battery to an ESC the capacitor will load instantly and that results in a spark. To prevent the spark we put a little resistor between the battery and the esc that the capacitor just loads slowly and no spark happens. Otherwise you will fry your key over the time because it will destroy it with every spark.[quote="raxell, post:1, topic:5237"]
EDIT: I must add a fuse too?
[/quote]

You dont need to but it is much safer! If somehow your setup should draw more than the fuse allows it would just turn off. You will need to replace the fuse then but the over current do not destroy your esc. That way you can buy a new fuse and safe a complete esc.

No estoy muy seguro pero creo que si, tienes que comprarte un parallel board, se hace todo más complicado, yo cargaría una en una, tardarán lo mismo.

I have been receiving pieces so i'm going to update this thread.
I am waiting enertion parts yet

I have added an anti-spark switch from [esk8](http://www.hellray.de/shop/#!/eSk8-de-Sparkprotection-Power-Switch-mit-Sicherung/p/59817445/category=15255004)

Yees!!, finally, after two months I have my enertion parts.

All it is working:
VESC OK
Motor detection OK
BUT!! my Nyko kama don't connect. The red light flashes and turn off. I didn't try nyko kama before in a wii so I don't know if it is broke or if I have to do something to turn it on.
Maybe I have too long cables in the receiver?

I'm going to show my VESC setting. I could not ride it yet, I need nyko kama connect with the receiver and I am working in the enclosure.
Are my setting ok, please?
I don't want hard brakes

Two things:

- you need to set max input voltage to 57V in the motor tab (it's on 42V now which might lead to errors) 

- check if your Kama receiver is connected correctly (sorry, it's German, but should be clear anyway):

Ooh nice!! I think a have conected nyko kama wrong. I started in pin number 1. I'm going to try it after dinner.

I have to set max input voltage to 57v? even with 2x 5s batteries? Ok, I'm going to change it. Thank you very much!!!

And guys, what do you think about this? good idea, bad idea??

If you think that the motor doesn't really have power at low speeds then set the motor current to 60 A or 70 A.
You will feel a huge difference.

I have a 40A fuse. It has nothing to do with motor current? You mean motor max, really?
Thanks

Good to hear that it works! :slight_smile:

Make sure that the cables towards the motors at long enough and not rubbing against the exit point from the motor can, else they could short. But it's a nice design idea.

Edit: motor max current is independent from battery max current, so no worries.

Ok, VESC updated!

It works perfectly. Thanks guys.
I will watch the cables under the truck. I am going to print a plastic piece to fasten them at the exit point.

Now for try it at home

This is awesome!!! Thanks all of you for the help!!

I love how it flows... It has much power that i have never ever reached the max yet. I don't know if it is good for the VESC to skate in max throttle.
Can I limit the throttle to 80% in VESC? I'm using nunchuck.
@elkick your VESC works so nice! 

Question 2: Can I connect 4S and 6S batteries in serial to get 10S?
like this?

[/quote]

Yes you can. I dont know what 80% will be but you can set "motor configuration" --> "motor" --> max erpm to a value below 60k to decrease the max speed

Yes you can do that easily because  both batteries have the same capacity **and** discharge rate ;)

How fast do you skateboad?
Do voltage give the batteries in series?

- I use niko kama as controller.

- Yes, I have batteries in serie 5S+5S
