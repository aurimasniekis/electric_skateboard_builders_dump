I've decided copy @unik and build a tiny board with fat off-road wheels, but finding a Jet Spud has been difficult since they discontinued the line. As luck would have it, I live in one of the remotest outpost of the empire (ie. I live in Australia), and sometimes things move slowly. Searching locally, I found possibly the last stock of Jet Spuds that are commercially available. 

I know the Spuds are popular, so if you're looking for one you might want to try here .... http://www.extremeskates.com.au/brands/jet/jet-spud-29

I would suspect that supplies are limited, and I don't know if they ship internationally.

They haven't really discontinued it. The new one is called Jet Potato 29" and will be in some Australian stores soon, although I talked to Extreme Skates and they said they might not be getting the new ones in.

Anyway, I ordered a Jet Spud from extreme skates, it arrived well packed and in good condition. The Spud actually didn't come from them though, it came from GoSports Australia (the distributor). I contacted gosports months ago and didn't get a reply. Will contact them soon and see what the price is.

This is great news. If all goes well, I can see this size format being popular in my family so it's good to know it'll be around for a bit longer.

Yes I agree, and it was also relatively quick. I usually order from MuirSkate.com and I had some trepidation about ordering from ExtremeSkates ... worked out well, though. I'd definitely order from them again in the future.

That's a good point ... to be honest, I didn't even consider that.

I think you can even buy most parts off him.

i don't want a direct copy .... I'm thinking of using the direct drives from http://esk8.de rather than belt driven.

The sizing (of the drives and motors) might be tricky on such a small board ... Might work, might not! :)
