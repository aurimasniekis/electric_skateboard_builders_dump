Since I began my building addiction last fall, I have re-done my build swapping parts to try different ones and began accumulating lots of *extra* parts üòÖ I've sold off many of the various parts here on the forum, but last week I realized I was only missing an esc and remote to have another operational board!! Soo, i ordered myself one of the new maytech 100amp escs with aluminum case and a mini remote. The motor I had failed on me months ago while riding so i figured itd work sensorless. I got busy making an enclosure (I made it a bit too big lol) and painting. The battery was recently swapped out of my lava board and is a 12s3p lg hg6 capable of 90amps cont., though im only using 65 with one motor. Ordered a 6inch 18w 12v led flood light and red laser for $20 to hardwire with a buck converter. Rode it 10 miles yesterday and it was amazing!!üòÑüòÑ Today i did an foc detection just for shits and giggles and it worked flawlessly!! Its raining so i cant test, but trips me out that sensored bldc wont detect, sensorless works perfect, and foc sensored works perfectü§î anywho.. heres some pics

Any idea why the motor failed on you?

I recently ordered maytech 6374 170kv sealed ones and reading this has me abit worried :disappointed_relieved:

@Wraith, the motor had a sensor issue in bldc but ran perfect in sensorless and have it in sensored foc now... so not sure whats up but foc is soooo quiet üòç these motors seem to be quite robust wherein you can still keep riding if the sensors mess up

That does sound like they are quite robust that way! Hoping mine run without any issue and keep running even if there is just like yours. Odd how the sensors work fine when in Foc. Got some Foc magic at work with your motors lol 

I believe many motors in the market are rebranded maytechs anyway which leads me to believe theyre a solid brand as alot of builders and companies use them! Maybe I‚Äôll do a GB just so I can get 10 and put custom design on the cans :laughing:

Definitely recommend them, and the new 100amp esc has built in power switch and comes in an aluminum case. The old 50amp super escs didnt run foc too well, but this one does so flawlessly

If I might ask, where did you source your 100 amp esc from? I'm looking for a good seller of them. I just got done with my first build that was an esk8 mountainboard and I'm already looking into another one but with this one being more portable lol

This is a blank deck from skateshred.com, dowhill racer i believe and yes it is front wheel drive. The reason for that is making my encolsure too big haha but i made it work @Lionpuncher
