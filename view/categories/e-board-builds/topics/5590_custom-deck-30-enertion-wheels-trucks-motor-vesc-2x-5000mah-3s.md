It's as cheap or expensive/time consuming as you want it to be. Search for enclosure, mount, or read the build threads for ideas. I did a mock up on a 30" with kicktail and I was popping wheelies, be careful!

Take a look at your batterys ''C rate'', should be at least 20C in my opinion on a 6S5Ah battery.

Well I had the same issue, but I did not have access to a vacuum former. I bought a sheet of plastic  and heat it in the oven und used a harder kind of stirofoam as a negative and laid the heated plastic sheet over it and formed it using gloves. It turned out better as I accepted, but there are some small curves on the edges, but other than that, it is a very easy and fast way to make a custom enclosure :)

I hooked it up to a little 3s today and it was enough power to get me down my drive nothing compared to my evolve but it was fun on a little board

Also I made an enclosure out of abs today and it works great I just need to save up and do some jobs and then buy some batteries

Just can't wait for my batteries to arrive and then go out shredding 

Could anyone give me a rough estimate on range 

I weigh 50kg and it is 6s 5000mah

Since that comes out to 111 watthours, seems like your max range is about 5-6 miles.
