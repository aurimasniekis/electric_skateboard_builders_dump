Sounds good @delta_19 what BMS will you use? How do you plan to connect the cells (solder or spot-weld)? 

I'm also curious about the watt meter and how you'll integrate it, is there an advantage to this one over one of the volt meters or coulometers that others are using?

@XIII added

@treenutter no bms using sleds like before, they work and let me remove dead cells. the wattmeter is the same as a coulometer really its just all contained in to one unit.

so the plan, the plan for my board, the one made just for this board, the board plan.
so i live on a 48 hour day world thats why im posting now...

rear single drive motor with a custom battery and TB ESC/VESC. the plan is to plane a flat spot on the board and glue on the vape sleds then make a lid with a piece of sheet metal to help get some of the heat off. from there attach the esc and mount the trucks and motors on some shock absorbers. the wattmeter isnt permanent so im just going to make a quick disconnect for it and longer leads.

schematics

ok so in order of what happened.

no response from maytech on the vesc.

got the vape sleds in but no nickel strips so 2 more weeks till i can start the the pack.

board stuff is in but screwed up an only ordered one set of bushings not two, shite.

so for this board im starting to think its duel motor time just dont know if i want DD or DR really leaning for DD because the bigger motors i can use is a huge plus. i also need a lighting system and being a avionics tech i like to make my own circuits so plan for doing that is in the works. diagrams and schematics soon

If you have the possibility to try DD do it.
I tried it two times now and I cant imagine a worse concept.
Torque steering is real and I don't care what anybody says who hasn't tried it.
Believe me it really really really really sucks so bad IMO

your the first person i have seen say DD sucks. ima try it on the test board and if it does suck i can go to DR and just have a motor on either side of the trucks. 

but updates,
leds ordered: 400 inbound
sk3 6364 245KV ordered: 1 inbound
new caliber 2 44dgr trucks satin blue: 1 pair inbound (was gonna use the green ones that i own[pair in op] but they are chewed to shit)
and grade A samsung 25r5 18650s: 50 inbound

i have the deck, sleds, shock pads, bushings, screws, and nickel strips here.
I own the esc, mount, grears, and wattmeter.

now the diagrams

Are these the batteries? I noticed each battery has 2500mAh and you have 40 of them which means you have 100,000mAh? How did you wire them - parallel or series? What kind of battery enclosure did you use to put them all together so nicely? It's very aesthetic! How far can this go with that long of battery life? Are these batteries rechargeable and with what charger/adapter? I am very new to the community and am working on my first build. I want to use it for commuting/cruising purposes to go long distances. Do you recommend I should use similar batteries? 

I gladly appreciate any advice/tips! Thanks!

10,000 mAh

its a series parallel array, so i have 10 groups of 4 wired in parallel then i wire the ten groups together in series to make it 10S. 

is 370 watt-hours so i should be able to get 34KM never gone that far on it though.

yes, samsung 25R5 18650 cells are rechargable and, because they are just in holders like you would fine in your tv remote for AA i use the following to charge.
https://www.amazon.ca/Nitecore-Rechargeable-Batteries-Integrated-Displays/dp/B00M7W27PK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1466976333&sr=8-1&keywords=nitecore+d4+digicharger

http://efestpower.com/index.php?ac=article&at=read&did=413

do i recommend it, yes and no

if you do your research then you could build a pack like this but it is something that could fail easy and kill people if you fuck up. so for your first board i suggest lipos for R/C cars then when you learned how to make an 18650 pack go for it.

Hi, thanks for the information!

I think I'll go with LiPo batteries then. Do you recommend anything other than Zippy 5,000mAh or should I just go with that? Also I'm a little confused about something: If you have 40 batteries that each have 2,500 mAh, how do you only get 10,000 mAh? Does this have to do with the wiring?

Thanks again

when battery=ies are connected in series only the voltage they output increases

when connected in parallel their capacity and amperage increase.

What would have happened if you connected them all in parallel? Would you have gotten a superrrr long battery life?

Also, do you recommend anything other than Zippy 5,000mAh or should I just go with that?

if you connect them all in parallel you would get tons of life but no speed, motor may not even move

and zippys are good cells to go with.
