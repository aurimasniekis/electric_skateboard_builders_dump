I have a Raptor 2 on order but i want to build a board for $1000 or less, the board is for cruising not super high speed but it has to have the power to pull me at 285lbs. No hills where i live, but this will be my second board for me or anyone that wants to ride with me when i get my Raptor.

Dual 190kV 6355 motors should give you a good amount of torque with a higher reduction ratio. What kind of top speed are you looking for?

Honestly 25mph would be alot im not looking for high speed runs id want more range if i could.

With out any hills a single 6374 should be enough a single motor leaves more money in the budget for a large battery pack but I'd ask @sl33py

I'm riding 8s with a 170kv 6355 motor (160 lbs). Powerful enough, no hills. 6374 with 15mm belt would be enough

So a 6374 with a 16/32 set up would be good enough? What about battery should i stick with 10s4p like the raptor or should i go for the 12s4p that torqueboards have coming soon?

Hey @Battosaii!  Fellow big guy here at 265-270 lately.  I ride single motor setups frequently w/ my Marbel (50mm motor) and board i built for my GF (Vanguard Flex 1 42" - 190kv 8s 6374 15/40 gears).

On the flats they both move me along just fine!  I would of course dial in good quality bushings setup correctly for our heavier weight - huge improvement in quality of ride and when carving in particular.

I was pretty amazed how well my Marbel moved me up some steep hills as i had low expectations w/ a single 50mm motor.

Single motor - definitely stick to 15mm belt setups.

I'm very close to completing my second dual motor setup since my old dual 50mm e-GBomb was stolen a year or so ago.  I'm also playing with DIYes new 218mm caliber clone trucks - and setting up a dual 6374 setup for pure stupid power...

I like to gear down as much as possible to keep speeds reasonable, and get maximum torque for hills.  not that i'm going up big hills all the time, but i want the ability when needed.  

I would go with 14/15 / 40t instead.  As long as you are running larger wheels like 83/90/97 to clear the bigger 40t wheel gear.  dual setup 12mm, single setup 15mm.

Battery - depending on your ESC for 12s vs 10s.  If 4.12 VESC i'd stick to 10s with 190kv to avoid the 60k ERPM limit which can/will kill your DRV chip.  If VESC Six - then you can run either and exceed 60k ERPM.

Batteries are tough - you can go Lipo - better power/density and less voltage sag if you get higher quality High C cells (30c - 65c usually if staying above 5000mAh - lots of amp delivery capacity).

If you want plug-and-play simplicity of 18650 cells w/ BMS - i'd suggest quality cells with more in parallel to provide enough amps for a bigger guy.  12s4p would be great - depending on cell chosen.  The new 30q (rated 15A, some show 20A), or VTC5a (tested 25A by mooch) would be my choices.  60-80A delivery for 30q, and 100A for VTC5a.

OR stick to lipos...  My 5000mAh 30c lipos are "rated" 150A delivery (a grain of salt and likely marketing), or some A-Spec 4500mAh 65c rated nearly 300A!

Hope that helps.

If you go for a single 6374 with low speed high torque gearing just make sure you get 15mm wide belts, you'll need those to transfer all that torque without the constant need for tensioning to prevent skipping

yeah go for single motor right now. If you don't like it then buy another one. instead of spending the extra money. I have a single 190 kV motor 16/36 with 12 belt. Most parts from DIY. You can list the part that you're planning to buy. People here can help you lower the cost. And if my parts arrive in time, I will try to get a heavier guy to ride my board and see how it holds up. I'm 120 lbs so I can't tell you if 190kv and the gearing ratio would work but be patience and I will get in touch with you.

@Battosaii and @gee - I am a heavier guy, and i can skip a single 12mm belt _easily_.

I would stick to 40t wheel gear for lower top speed and more torque.  It's not an issue with the 190kv motor, but gearing and belt i would lower gearing and wider belt.

then maybe i should just go dual for less chance of belt slippage its more costly but id rather not have to run into belt problems with a single because of my weight and ill stick to the 40t wheel gear.

15mm is fine - you don't need to run it super super tight, but snug.  You can always add a second motor later - if you go w/ 6374 your options are diagonally on the front truck, or switch to DIYes 218mm Caliber II clones.  

Definitely recommend the 40t gears.  and 14/15t motor gear to help keep speeds reasonable.

Have you done a speed calc yet?  what wheels, motor, gears and voltage?

I ended up getting a really good deal on a Raptor it had everything i wanted at a price that was too good. Should i upgrade the pulleys? for my weight or should it be fine because its a dual motor?

saw that on the other thread.  congrats.

You should be fine as is - depending on gears used.  If you can fit 12mm dual belts - great.  But i rode dual 9mm belts for quite a while w/o issue...  So i'd ride it as-is and then futz with it only if needed.

GL!

thank you im so excited, i do want to build my own thing in the future though. My raptor purchase came with an extra battery with a faulty on off switch ill have to inspect it my self and if that is all thats wrong ill fix it and have the most expensive part of my next build lol.

Hey I am planning on using the Vanguard Flex 1 for a build too. Can you outline all the parts you used for that build? I weigh 230 and would be needing the same requirements as you. I'd like to stay around 25mph with a distance of 20 miles on a charge. Thanks in advance!

So i am a big guy (320lbs) and this is what im using: 

Board - Trampa street carver, I went for the titanium axles and 16 ply deck and it is great. it feels strong but a bit of flex. dont think it would be possible to break, plus it has a lifetime warranty. 
Drive - 6374 190KV motor + FOCBOX. Trampa motor mount / pulley kit. im using the 13/37 pulleys, 15mm belt and 90mm wheels, this should give me a top speed of around 25mph. The pulleys look very heavy duty and i have not had any belt issues yet, even under full breaking down hills. i haven't yet found any hills near me that are a problem which i thought might be concern given my weight.

Its been great so far and would recommend.

Hey Jean - easily done.

If you want a flex 1 build you should be set.  The biggest challenge for us "normal sized" folks is flex.  Even the flex 1 is still flexy and can be a PITA.  I've had to redo my battery fixture a few times and finally have it dialed in.

I second @ducktaperules recommendation on power, but would go with a beefy standard setup using DIYes extended axle trucks (possible dual motor), or standard Caliber 2 50's for a single motor setup.  And a single motor setup, geared down correctly, works fine for me (and i'm bigger than you, but a bit less than Duck).

I'd use the following:
**DECK**: Flex 1 (might reinforce and sink wires into deck top w/ CF on top for more strength and less flex (still on my to-do list now that my GF's board is Ex-GF so mine))

**MOTOR**: 6374 sensored motor - 190/170kv range.  I also have a [SK3 149kv](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-149kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html) which runs great, but i really am enjoying the smooth sensored motors more now.

**MOUNT**: I'd get one of the beefier ones offered here by folks.  My current favorite is @korryh's mounts.  Save some serious $ over others.  DIYes are good too.

**GEARING**:  15mm belt for single, dual 12mm if dual.  go as low as you can go.  I like 40t wheel setups, with 13/14 on the motor.  Gear calculator: www.esk8.it

**ESC**:  VESC/FOCBOX/VESC 6.  Pick your poison - Direct FET and heatsink would be first choice.  Chaka, and tons of others out there to pick from.  Just depends on your budget.  

**BATTERIES**:  Pick one.  On a budget and not super comfy DIY - i'd still go HIGH C Lipo's.  If you have the $, want to fiddle and build your own 18650 pack - just get good cells that can provide 20A+ each and do 4p minimum (IMO).  

I'd go 8-10s depending on ESC.  12s if you have enough sk8 skill to manage the power (gear as low as you can go).

Range - 10wh=1km.  Build/Find a pack w/ approx 320Wh or better for your 20'ish target.  Hills/racing/heavy will impact, so over 320 would be good if you actually plan to ride 20mi.

I'd find another Vanguard build you like and clone it the best you can - highest form of flattery and tons to choose from!

HTH - GL!

Did I hear my name called - thanks for the shout out @sl33py.  @jeancarlosmosq I just made some mounts that fit diys extended axle trucks perfectly with stainless motor mount arm.  The motor mount arm has a couple holes if you want to add a tension bearing for the belt and is about a half inch longer than my usual mount arms in case you want to upgrade to bigger wheels and pulley.  I only have 2, if you want to try them out they are yours for 50.00  per mount shipped anywhere in the US.
