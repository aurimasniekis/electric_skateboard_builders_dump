Going to be mocking this up over the weekend then making the CF battery box on Sunday.

A post was just made about going over 28mph on the airless tires. Used zip ties to secure wheel to hub.  I can see that turning into one sweet board.

Ok looks like top speed is going to be 25 lol. This is a commuter board so that is fine by me.

35 is a good top speed

I think I will shoot for 35, but the Vesc's are TB and might not be able to take it without a heat sink.

What trucks/bearings/hubs are you using on this build? I was under the impression the airless tires are not a standard size and only really fit on the trucks that come on the complete boards/kits that @diyeboard sells. I have one coming in the mail and want to upgrade the deck to a drop thru, and possibly upgrade the motor mount to one where I can adjust the belt tension.

The carbon fiber board was no good with belts so I switched it to a bustin board. Also am going to save the Lipo's for my 4wd Carvon. Switched to a 12s4p pack from TB.

May I ask what modifications you had to make to allow the motors to fit on the Torqueboards trucks and mounts? I recently bought the @diyeboard 10s5p AT complete with the 6" airless tires. I love the board but I know that belt tension is a huge safety issue and I would like to switch to something like the Torqueboards mounts and trucks.  I plan on keeping the everything else pretty much the same. The tires fit perfectly onto the truck with the lipped bearings and stock pulleys? I just realized you are running single drive with a TB Motor... Why did you keep the pulley on the hub, is it attached?

This whole build changed into this:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/1/a13c4d46bba05c19b0ce94b2f10547b4efebf230.jpg" width="666" height="500">

I am using the torqueboards 215mm trucks and the reverse motor mount kit. This fits the Airless tires, but they expand off the hub past 25 mph so I had to switch to the abec11 superflys. I will still be able to switch to the Airless tires but I have to limit the max ERPM so my tires stay on the rim. 

The only issue is that the motors on the DIYEboard kit are not 63mm motors and TB motor mounts only fit 63mm. 

I actually ordered this:
http://www.diyeboard.com/6-wheels-allterrian-electric-skateboard-power-truck-diy-kit-p-619.html
and a esc and enclosure for it so I can test it out. I might just try to drill a hole and mount a idler pulley on it. We will see once I put it all together.

answer to some questions:
Tires fit great on TB trucks. Hub is attached with 4 screws that I could take off but this is a dual motor setup now.

I saw some zip tie pictures from someone with airless tires. Had like four or five each rim to hold them on.  Not ideal but better than watching a tire roll by at 25+ mph.

It was too cold to go above 20. Wind chill plus 15F. Has so much more room to open up. I want to program the throttle ramp before I go to 30+.

I actually decided to save the graphenes for the Orange Carbon board they are laying on. They are waiting on my 2 Carvon v4 Speed Drive XL for a 4wd beast. But seeing as how fast this one is I will probably just do 2wd.

I was talking to the manufacturer of the airless AT tires and he said most trucks will not fit the airless all terrain tires because of axle length being too short. Did you have a problem using the stock hubs and lipped bearings/pulleys with the torque boards trucks and mounts or did you switch to the psychotiller hubs? I read through your thread, so I'm sorry if you already posted this info and I missed something...

The wide trucks have a longer axle that requires and extra spacer and a few speed rings.

Stock hubs and barrings work fine on TB 218mm. Just have to find a board that doesnt get wheel bite.

Okay, what about pulleys @jreamer? I am looking into building a board with a single motor that fits the 6" airless AT tires. I am going to do a drop thru mount. Could I use Caliber II trucks and motor mounts with these wheels or are the axles not wide enough? I am happy with my board but I want to build a lighter one that I can switch from the AT to regular wheels easily. I am also using a longer deck than the 36" one that was provided by DIYEBOARD. I put together a parts list on Torqueboards site and it was over $500 without the battery. I am just looking to do a basic build and have a budget of about $300. Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions.

It depends on the board. I would only use extra long trucks with the 6 inch tires because I like the wide base. Makes me feel more stable being so high up off the ground. 

You can just order the 218mm TB trucks and then source your motor mounts elsewhere. The TB trucks are just extra large Caliber Clones so they fit any Caliber motor mount kit. You can search the forum but I would recommend UNIK motor mounts. Best in the business.

Also for 300 will not be able to get a battery or a motor that are strong enough to work with AT wheels.
