Currently reading up on all the parts and thought I would use this thread to document it and get advice and tips.

I live in the UK, which could effect getting some parts

Most prices are rough guesses at the moment.

Hey. You can buy 90mms clones for 20£ from aliexpress
Pulleys you can get from this forum for 40£
You can get keda 6355 190 for 36£ from hobbyking
Go single belt drive
Mount get from this forum from boardynamics for 36£ including belt
Calibers from bluetomato for 40£
18650 will cost you 3£ each from nkon
You don't need a charger if you use bms
Probably you will spend 600£ in the end.
If you want links,I can put them later

thanks! thats really helpful. Is there anyone / where that sells a few of the bits together? Saves me paying P&P to lots of places?

Who would you recommend for the VESC and remote?

Hk Sk3s are known to pack a punch and I can vouch for them. My 6374 192KV gets me up to 35mph on flats and has decent torque on my 97mm wheels and I run 9S lipos. 

The 6374 motor is about £70 IIRC. Downside is you need to use a dremel to shave a flat spot on the shaft or drill a hole if your pulley has space for a grub screw.

Other upside though, at 8mm, the shaft is easier to find a pulley for.

Edit: Should also note, the motor did this whilst I was weighing an easy 95Kg, 104kg with my gear. I'm cutting for a fight and sittinf at 84kg now so expecting to hit slightly higher top speed on my next test. 

You can get good torque with smaller wheels or larger wheel pulleys.

Ok. Any brands you would recommend?

What shaft size is best?

Do I need a sensored motor or not, what does that do?

Thanks,

If you save ££ on some items, you should get FOCBOX from enertion.
And you need an enclosure

Nothing wrong with a 10mm shaft. But a 8mm shaft will be more compatible with most pulleys on the market. 
Sensored motors are not necessary. The sensors assist in easier transitions from a standstill. 
In my experience, motors don't last too long. Find an affordable one and run it hard. Ex: keda 6355 from hobbyking, tacon 160, or a smaller racerstar 5065 from banggood.

Happy to pay the upgrade if it's worth it.
It's either £140 from street-wing.com or £117 from Enertion, but I expect their shipping will be more to the UK?

For the enclosure, I'm going to shape my own mould and Vac-form it from polycarb or PETG to match the board.
I'd like to run the wires under the grip tape to hide them. Is there a special truck mount that allows them to come out neatly?

As I am going single motor I was thinking the larger 6374 would be better.
Why do you recommend smaller?

Larger is better for torque, speed, efficiency. But a smaller motor is still effective. I weigh 70 kg and only ride single motor boards. One of my boards has a small 5065 motor and works fine, top speed +22 mph. My other board has a 6364 motor and has more torque, but less top end speed. I used to run a 6355 motor with success as well. 
6374's are selling for over $120. There are a few 6355 options for under $70.

And that's a really good deal on that deck! I'm working on a cantellated tesseract build currently.

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html

If this is the motor you mean seems really good value for £65.
I thought the HobbyKing motors got bad reviews for quality and burn out?

The 6354 is only £15 cheaper so I'd rather go bigger and give myself headroom for better top speed / acceleration, depending on gearing.

Seems like the SK3 is a good options!

Keep in mind that the sk3 motors have a different mounting pattern from other motors. Sk3's have a 32mm (I think) mounting pattern. Whereas most motors and mounts have a 44mm mounting patter. Other motors like the OM5065 and racerstar 5065 have a 38mm mounting pattern. 

So make sure your mount is compatible with your choice of motor.

Expensive for a riser. I'll stick to normal ones and just drill the board the the cables.

Do trucks come with risers or do I need to order them separately?

I'm in Finland. Have to pass on your kind offer for now. Just bought an loaded vanguard so can't throw money away on an other deck for now. But let me know if you neef something from the north and I'll help you if needed.

Edit. Going offtopic here but need to show this :stuck_out_tongue:

Slow progress but so far my deck has arrived and is super nice. I'm looking at colour options for wheels and trucks and if I might shape it. 

Ordered the Focbox and mini remote in the Cyber Monday deals. 

Welcome to any tip offs of other parts?

I’m in the the process of making a mould for an enclosure for the truncated tesseract. I don’t know if the shape would be similar. Hopefully I will make the first enclosure tomorrow. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/f/1f33a5c29ce93374f427912e29979281b59f71da.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/9/d96e974b9ca9abcc3d1d46c06a9d2204288709cc.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Welcome to the slowest build ever!

Can't edit the original post any more so here's an update.
Picked up the Enertion Nano-X Hand Controller
http://www.enertionboards.com/categories/wireless-hand-controller.html
and FOCBOX in the black friday sale group buy.
Cheers, @monkey32

Deciding on a motor is tricky. Lots out there but doesn't seem to be clear  information on which is best?

It's probably easier to say what I currently have! :smile:
So I need everything apart from deck, FOCBOX, and remote.

Going to pick up some new Caliber trucks, bearings, and ABEC 87 / 90mm clone wheels online.

So still on the look out for;
Motor + Mount + Pulls / belt 
Battery + BMS + Charger + switch / port / read out

I'm in the UK so either somewhere with high quality parts in UK.
Or somewhere abroad where I can get lots of the parts in one hit.

I was looking at the SK3 motor from HK, but its not sensored, and seems to to use that which a high quality VESC.

I could use Torque Board, and get a motor / mount / pully in one hit.
How do people rate their motors?
Or ollin / others ?

Depending on Battery, but the best BMS you can get is from Bestech - they are in China but they have english representatives which are familiar with this forum so you can probably send them an email and get a good experience.

I have a mount, but its one-sided - and is only good if you ride goofy. For belts anywhere is good.

I realised that Trampa's wearhouse was not far from me so went round this morning and picked up some wheels, 90mm, 76a, black. A set of Caliber 2 trucks, 10" 50 degrees. And some Trampa ceramic bearings. 
Top blokes, really helpful!

So I'm now up and rolling, just under leg power!

No. I can get it to touch if I lean right over.

Looking at other threads they are talking about using 1/2" with 90mm and a Tesseract.
