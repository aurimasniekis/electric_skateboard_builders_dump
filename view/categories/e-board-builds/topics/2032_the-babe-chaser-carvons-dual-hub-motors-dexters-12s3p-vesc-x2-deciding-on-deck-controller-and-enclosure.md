Hey Everybody!
I'm new to this community but this is my second build. I'm a freshman engineering student in College so still kind of a noob.  My first build was a single drive Enertion mount/motor/ Mamba monster 2/ LiPo batteries/ Loaded Vangaurd/ 2.4ghz controller. Pic later.

I'm looking to do some serious upgrading for my second board and have done quite a bit of homework. So far I've settled on Carvon since it's much cleaner that a mount and belt and frees up space, Dexter's 10S3P (he's been super helpful in this process), and 2 of his VESCs. 

Battery - product/electric-skateboard-battery-epower-pack-10s3p/
Motor Hubs -http://www.carvonskates.com/store/p20/CarvON_V2_Dual_Hub_Motors___Front_Truck___ABEC11_90mm_Wheels_Set.html
VESCs - product/vesc-the-best-electric-skateboard-esc/

I'm just starting to order parts but still haven't decided on a Deck, Controller, and enclosure. 
Deck - I'm looking for something along the lines of a mini-cruiser. I want something smaller than my Loaded Vanguard but still able to handle high speeds. I'd be riding around campus and to downtown where there are cracks and definitely places to wipe out so I was leaning towards a kick tail.

Controller - I want to go with a nunchuk. So I was thinking the Nyoko Kama but I want decent range on the controller 50ft+ or so and wasn't sure it could handle that. So I was thinking of disassembling one hooking up with an ATtiny and 2.4ghz transmitter. 

 Enclosure - Dexter is in the process of making some but I haven't seen them and want to explore other options. I like a lot of the work @pyschokiller does with enclosures. 

I'll be sure to post some photos as stuff comes in!
Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated! :smile:

Compare Carvon with @Hummie's hubs

@Michaelinvegas I was picking between those two and ended up going with Carvon for a couple reasons.
1) Now they have non clone authentic ABEC11 Flywheels, which are replaceable I believe vs just the thin layer of lower quality rubber for the hub 
2) I have inclines which I have to deal with  <- Not sure how they compare here but I saw videos of Carvons killing some inclines. 

3) For my next build I wanted to try something new with those hubs :smile:
I was gonna try to build a tiny electric board with no controller. Most likely one of these: http://www.pennyskateboards.com/us/shop/by-size/penny-original-22-inch.html  

I'd have to use a VESC and a small battery pack. It would be a push board except it would calculate the back current to see how hard you pushed and then multiple that by a factor input that to the motor and then slowly fade away. That way it'd be like a "propulsion" board that would just enhance normal riding and make coasting much less work. Be perfect for my college campus going in between classes.

Right on....


You thinking abt doing a Zboard type or a push assist like @lowGuido (  http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/low-guidos-hack-board-for-science-now-with-push-assist/870/73?u=michaelinvegas )

You mean a penny board like this ? http://s.aliexpress.com/6J3E3Uzm

I don't like riding short wheel base electric decks .... I built a 36 inch with a small wheel base...hang on to your hats.... That thing is the dart master lol...it can lay you on ur rear if you don't have you body correct on a quick start with no push off ... I guess a little one would be ok... But couldn't get the full enjoyment of the motor....maybe a real long deck with no controls .... That's what I'm thinking abt making nexT ....

Yea similar to the first link you posted except no button - it would take whatever speed you pushed to input a bit of current to your motor to make your deceleration close to 0. So I have a small board in mind for use in between classes.

Carvon is a good choice. Plenty of torque and speed and the braking is very effective. 
I would recommend going with the dual motor kit and 10s or 12s battery.
I'm running duals with 12s myself and the power is amazing!
I am also using Dexter's Mini RC 2.4ghz remote which gives me excellent control at all speeds.

Thanks for the input! Yea, I just ordered my duals. Should have them in 2 weeks! Excited :smile: 

You have a pic of your setup? I think I'm going to go for 10S since I want a smaller board... What size is yours?

Highly recommend the Carvons as well. In regards to pushing - definitely the way to think about it when riding the hubs. It enhances normal riding and coasting and without the drag, you can be really stealthy especially when you set the VESC on FOC. It's nearly silent with the hubs. I'm running 10s on both single (29" board) and dual hubs (36" board) and did some riding on a college campus this past weekend. Very fun!

I like wide decks with long wheelbase.
This 39" deck is 10.25 wide and  the wheelbase is 33.5
I can loosen the bushings and carve like crazy or tighten them to go fast with good stability.

I've thought about trying the vesc esc's. How well do they handle heat?
Im running the torques board esc's. The heat sinks get pretty warm and the hubs sound just like little jet engines!
Also, will the programing software run on a Mac computer?

Serpac enclosure from Mouser electronics and torquesboard esc's from Dexter.
If i'm not mistaken these esc's can handle 120 amps each continuous.
acceleration is impressive with dual carvons and 12s lipos. And thats with a 185lb rider.
I have to lean forward when I'm punching it or get dropped off.

So I looked it up and a 5 degree slope is like a 9% grade.
Better to run 2 singles. then if one breaks, you only have to replace one. And I think its better not to have them stacked.
They dissipate heat better this way. Which is also why I mounted them outside the box.
Ive gotta go get some ZZZZ now.
Cheers.

They do have an app although I haven't tested it.

For mine since some of the streets have already been measured before. I base it off of the main streets which have a percentage of incline.

I've used http://www.findhills.com/ to help get an estimate.  I noticed it tends to bucket includes greater than 9% into a "9+%" bucket, so it's not too useful for steep hills.  As I'm in DC, this is probably fine, but for folks in hillier terrain, maybe using something like Strava to record your ride and then looking to see in % grade.

I would say just be thankful you live in a flat area. 
I wish I did. 
Riding on level ground is more fun than hills in my opinion. 
Riding up hill a lot causes things to heat up. 
My Esc's and motors get hot if I'm going up hills a lot.

One thing I like about the Torquesboard Esc's is that I can pull over anytime and adjust the programming using the program card which fits in my pocket.  
Would be great if someone would develop a smart phone app and wifi dongle for the Vesc. So you could adjust it on the road.

Braking is also much stronger with duals. 
I'm running 12s Lipo and Torquesboard 12s Esc's

## \#33 Posted by: LukeM Posted at: 2016-04-05T06:54:08.359Z Reads: 228

```
@broshi you can do it several ways.
1) Connect Lipos in series (2 6s or 3 4s etc.) -> Easy way
2) Take apart the Lipos and connect them to just make one big pack. I wouldn't recommend doing this but am not super knowledgeable about it either. I'ver heard of people doing it with the 18650  

@torqueboards sells 12s batteries but they are not Lipos

Anyone have some advice on what size deck I should be going with?
I don't want a monster board. Something a good size which I can comfortably carry and go fast on. 
So far I like this one the best:

It also comes in a 38" size, not sure if that will make too big of a difference though, thoughts?

"In short, LiPo’s provide high energy storage to weight ratios, are capable of fast discharges, and come in an endless variety of shapes and sizes."
http://www.rchelicopterfun.com/rc-lipo-batteries.html
Read that.

The way I see it is you can get the relatively same specs from a different battery pack (18650s) but your gonna need more cells for the same results. If this is your first build I'd recommend not going with Lipos since you'd need to buy a separate machine to charge them and will overall just require more work.

Best to connect 2 6s packs in series and charge them separately. 
I use 5.5mm bullet connectors to easily connect them for service and disconnect them for charging. 
Note: I've noticed that running 12s seems to put a strain on the Esc's and can cause over heating in situations of prolonged heavy load. Like going up long steep hills. 
You might consider trying 10s instead. 
I just recently cooked one of my Esc's doing hills. 
Running 12s is like running on the edge of the Esc's limitations.

I would spend the extra few dollars on the 12s pack for this build. There have been cutout issues with 10s packs and dual Carvon Hub motors. Plus it's only a few bucks more from Dexter so well worth it in my opinion.

Running dual motors on 12s. 
The power and acceleration is intoxicating!
It's amazing when a 185lb rider can fly up hills going 28+ mph. Higher voltage also means less current so the motors run cooler.

I went with Dexter's  ( ^^ Torqueboards ^^) 12s3p Pack..

( product/electric-skateboard-battery-epower-pack-12s3p/ )

Mainly because he was so helpful with my build, but also because it's basically the only premade 12s pack that I have seen anywhere that is plug and play, has everything you need in a pack, is well built, and uses quality cells. You could also make your own if you have a lot of free time, the tools and skills to do so. I do not meet two of these requirements. :stuck_out_tongue:

I'll release a tutorial too unless you guys happen to release one before me.

It's unfortunate since my first packs have been riding solid for 3-4 months now. But I guess that's what I get for trying to swap out those switches for a more prettier switch :slight_smile: 

The 80amp fuse is nice though.. It's just big.
