Hi guys

I'm about to build my first DYI eSk8

Only had a raptor2 before - nice board, but I wanted Direct Drives

After a long time not knowing if I should risk a buy from Carvon, there are now finally DD's coming out
I guess I was the first person who ordered @torqueboards new DD Motors (I was and am really hyped :slight_smile: )

Also ordered me 2 focbox unitys and a photon remote, as i wanted to have a remote wich shows me me my battery stats in a usefull manner

<del>Now I don't really know what deck I should choose. I want to be able to mount pneumatics when Dexter brings them out, to go offroad and to have stability for ful speed riding (50kmh)

<del>I was thinking about an Landyachts Evo, but I'm not shure if it'll work with pneumatics and if it is suited for offroad rides
So my current idea is to get something trampa like, as they are especially for offroad and i guess with that they are also trimmed for high stability

Edit: I bought me an Evo, from what I've seen it should be perfect

For the Battery, I want the biggest :stuck_out_tongue:
I want to use my board for traveling after I finished my apprientice ship next summer, so I'd like to have a range arround 100km
Would be nice if it's doable with 1 pack, but I'm also ok with having spare packs to change (1 big battery preffered)

Enclosure: eBoosted Evo or Evo DS


My idea is to have both sides separate -> front motors have their own focbox, receiver, battery and back motors have it the same
So one side could "blow up" and I wouldn't have to worry instantly as I still would be able to use the other side of the board
What do you guys think?

A second point is a BMS, what sugestions do you have here? Is there a good charge/discharge BMS?

thanks for any help!

In an application like this wouldnt it not be a bad idea to Have some kind of connectors on the ouside of your enclosure connecting the Battery and focboxes(just an example of what it could be between, please let me know if this is bad for it) that, in an emergency (say your board starts to full power accelerate) you can pull so you dont get injured? 

I worry about breaking everything so I figure just in case it decides to go haywire, I should have a plan. 

Would this require something to be soldered to the focboxes incase the caps fill up after I disconnect the battery? 

Sorry if this isnt the right area but your board just made me think of it. Please be careful with 4wd also, I think after @Battosaii went down on his 4dw evo we all see that its kind of excessive, and might even add to failure rate. Be safe :)

100km on pneumatics would be insane. Are you thinking top mount, bottom mount or both for the battery ?

I fell because if a mechanical failure that was compunded by the extra grip of the pnumatics wheel and that wheel beeing up front. 


I'm just amazed that the belt didn't snap instead of the motor mount bending.

i think you would need somewhere excess of 16p with 30q's for that kind of range

Absolutely mental

EDIT: i checked, would need to be 19P at 12s
EDIT 2: thats about 10kilos in 18650's!

hmmm... maybe yes, but it would be an exposed wire and if there is some rain... better not
also if I have both sites separate 1 should still be alright (at least I would hope so) and could be used to slow down the board

my plan would be to bring the board to flip
wait a second, if I use pneumatics they will be bigger than the board...

don't be sorry, it's always good to share your opinions, especially on safety

Not informed about what happend with @Battosaii's board, but i guess he had it built as one system? I'd say yes, on such a setup it might be more failure prone. But for me the dual system idea is to prevent bad things to happen, if one side goes down or makes some shit

Will try to stay as safe as possible - currently researching on armor
Do you know any good wrist protection?

Interesting wish list, and I suppose it's great to aim high ! 100km on AT wheels is probably going to be optimistic (at best). Certainly will be if you like the look of stealthy boards and standard under deck battery enclosure mounting. Of course anything is doable but the results won't be pleasing on the eye!

Looking forward to seeing how you progress on this project.

Totally agree. It's just I like stealthy boards, and whilst I get why mtb esk8 need top mount batteries, I just don't like the look of metal boxes inbetween the foot placements. This is probably the only way you'll get that many cells needed for that much range though.

Without to promote myself 😅
I‘m running a quad with pneumatics and nothing sides separated from each other
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/ice-crusher-16ply-holypro-4w-chain-drive-mtb-4x-6374-170kv-aps-quad-escape-steering-damper/65823?u=andy87

If you want an insane range I wouldn’t recommend to go quad. It’s just not really efficient. The same with chains, they cut you range over belts.
I have 2x 12s 5Ah lipo packs and I get like 12-15km out of them.

What you could do is to split your battery in two parts. 
A12s8p in a Eboosted enclosure under your deck and a 12s8p top mounted. 
With it you can also connect the two sides independently from each other.

I don’t run a bms as I use a balance charger for my lipos, but I use a fuse for each battery pack to save it up.

I‘m not expert on dd, but how you want to mount them on a trampa deck!
The deck has a 35degree angle on the nose and tale.
Normal longboard trucks will not fit there.

Is that just with belts or also with DD? As I imagine that 2 or 4WD wouldn't make much difference in efficiency

Ok so please bear with my absolutely terrible, probably not even electrically correct diagram, but I hope it makes what I was explaining more clear :) ![oh%20jeez%20dont%20judge%20me|690x346](upload://sSumgbLbEtaAXMfmNsh0kAY12N8.png) 

It would basically just act as a second loop key from the Battery to the ESC thats in an easier to reach position, maybe even ontop of the box? Using right angle XT 90s you could get a decent seal..... :D

its an 'oh shit' rope to pull :joy:

No focboxes in there...
But yes i can just pull it out if I want.

It’s an xt90 anti spark plug. 
It’s not likely that it’s pulled out on speed if I don’t do it with my own hands
And even than the power just drops and the board rolls out

@Battosaii My battery should be big enough, for choosing cells with less performance but more capacity

@Pedrodemio Are you coming to the Paris event this july? Will ride my way there from switzerland
Why the NCR GA? It has "only" 3350mah

It's 12S9P or 12S10P if it fits, in the bottom enclosure
And 12S14P in the box on top

Kind of too far away for me, but would love to go, a trip like yours should be awesome

This is the best place to compare batteries 

https://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/Common18650comparator.php

If you put the GA and the 35E you will see they are the same, and you can find the way cheaper, there is a guy selling them here really cheap, bought mine from him a few years ago 

What I really encourage you to do is first go small, maybe a small Lipo and do some tests to see how much you consume and how much current you pull to decide on the final configuration, consumption varies wildly depending or rider, for example, there was someone here that with 6,5” pneumatics running of high pressure that used less energy than most people on thane

I say this since you may be able to reach your 100km goal only with the bottom battery

Or if you go with Gummies and just the bottom you will certainly reach that

hmmm... now I have 3 cells which i don't know which to choose
I guess it's not the LG M36, as this is slightly worse in comparision
In comparision of the 35E to the GA, it looks to me that the 35E is the better cell

Also I think I'll buy it from nkon and there the 35E is slightly cheaper (2.65€ vs 2.75€)

And the goal of 100km is long gone
it's now a goal of 240km :blush:

if battosai did 80km on 12S8P, i guess i should be able to achive it with my 12S23-24P

PS: wheel wise I'll start with TB110 and maybe buy their pneumatic kit when it get's released

If it’s cheaper go 35E, it’s been a while since I check prices

Just take a look at https://endless-sphere.com/forums/ if you find any cycle life tests for the 35E, and ignore some you will find for the GA since people charge them way to fast

But with that amount of cells, tidings not too fast and with big pressure tires or Gummies I think you can pass the 300km barrier

Just buy some charger(s) that can charge it in a reasonable time, with an 8A charger that you can find easily it will still take around 10h to charge

Another tip, if you will not camp in the middle of nowhere far from power, there is a point that you will just be carrying dead weight, if you ride 6h a day with an average of 25 km/h, you will do a maximum of 150 km, and the rest of the 300km range is there doing nothing

Just saw you comment about the TB wheels, you will definitely break the 300km

will check the forum

i now bought me two 4A DC Jacks and an 4A charger. I also thought it's a little bit less for my setup, but i only looked up eskate sites and this was max. maybe i should check somewhere else
Important for me is; to only have 1 charger, as i don't have space when traveling

If I'm in the middle of nowhere, i'll just sleep there (i hope the middle of nowhere has a river)
I'm normally (at least with my old board: raptor2) riding at 50kmh/max speed. but we have good streets here, so probably will be slower somewhere else
Also I can carry the dead weight like a suitcase with rolls, so it's still not nice to carry it, but it's at least not so bad

also i don't have to use 300km a day
i can split it up into multiple days, depending on how far i go

how is it
if i decide to keep my top and bottom batteries separate; would i be able to load them simultaneously with one charger? would they finish together or would the bigger pack finish later?

Yes, but there is lots of ways to do it

Will you always be using both of them? never take one off the board?

Maybe I start with only bottom, as i'll be riding in switzerland. But from august it'll be both all the time

Them I would make them completely separated, with one BMS for each, the top pack would only have a positive and negative wire that connects to the board, but you will have to very careful to check that both are at the same voltage when connecting or there will be fire
