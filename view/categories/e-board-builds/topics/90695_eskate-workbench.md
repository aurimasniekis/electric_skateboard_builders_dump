Esk8 build for a workbench. Have a big plastic 8 by 4 table in my room taking up to much room. Built to hold 2 boards under
Has a secret compartment top for crap. Planning to add drawers under for other little things.![20190415_185307-01|591x500](upload://mpF4tisYMxOLYGRNPxdtWTxm0tf.jpeg) ![20190415_185301-01|671x500](upload://dqham3qE7okbEqg6niOKb2DDFte.jpeg)

I built something similar a while back. I made the walls from 3/4" cement fiberboard and filled the edges with grout. Its a fireproof charging and storage safe for my boards. My trial version had a crap load of fireworks set off inside of it and all that got out was smoke. I would like to think it would give me enough time to react and prepare a solution....

I have 2 workbenches.

One has no space to work on it and the other, let's just say it was not made with electric components in mind. I have to cover it with MDF to work on it.
