I have really been wanting to build some badass custom board, and by that I mean not buying all the parts prebuilt for me, like the enertion kits (by the way nothing wrong with them they are great that was my first build). I just want to do the real deal DIY, so this will be my second build. I am by no means a pro and will be needing a lot of help. This will be a long term build so maybe a couple of months. I finally talked one of my professors to let me use the schools equipment, so I have access to tons of fun toys to make this a very special build, so if you guys want to throw some awesome ideas my way I'll try my best to incorporate it into my build. I plan to make a battery that swaps out easily so I can keep a spare in my backpack. Definitely gonna have a duel motor set up, gonna try to design a mechanical brake for emergences, lots of lights, and thats about all I have for now.

What kind of equipment do you have access to from your school? That way we can give ideas

Seems like a lot of work. But that's half the fun of esk8. 
Looks like you're missing motor mounts and controller. 
Good luck

To start with multiple CNC machines, lathes, tons of different 3D printers including resin printers, drill presses, saws, belt sanders. I think there's more I took a quick peek today that's what I can name off the top of my head 

And haha thanks I'm going to try and make my own mount if not probly go with enertion mounts and controller maybe a gt2b mod

Check out EL wires, I am planning on making a tron board for my next build. [Inspiration](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKr2UAvB5uG/?taken-by=longhairedboy) comes from @longhairedboy.

yeah i'm working on an EL equipped one right now for a customer who wanted a rain proof commuter with a TRON theme and foot bindings, fenders, and headlights for commuting to work in the wet season. I'll be working on that a lot this weekend actually. I'd love to keep it for Maker Faire but he's been waiting long enough already.

if you decide to do something like that you might want to consider http://www.elwirepros.com. They're SUPER helpful and their stuff is pretty reliable and fairly inexpensive. They helped me out when i failed to understand anything about this stuff and burned up a few components. They have small 12V inverters that work very well with a 12v UBEC. 

they'll tell you this 100 times and print it on everything they send you: DON'T POWER UP THE INVERTER UNTIL ITS CONNECTED TO tHE EL WIRE. I did that. i have a couple of dead inverters now. lol

100% silicone sealant will keep anything out of your box. Even you if you're not careful. I've been using it to keep the crud out of my boxes for the last few builds. I'm tired of dirt and moisture getting into there. But since you mentioned you want to quick swap batteries that may not be the way to go for you. OF course if you build your pack big enough you won't need to swap, you'll be sick of riding before it runs out. 

i like the Samsung IRN18650-25R cells. You can't beat the price/performance ratio there. They pack a mean punch at around $5 per cell depending on how many you order. 

batterysupports.com has a wide selection of BMSs and chargers to match, and the chargers come with charging ports of you get the ones listed for ebikes. if you go with a 4P or 5P pack you should totally get the 4amp charger. It will charge a 12S4P in about 2.5 - 3 hours. Shipping from China is a bitch, but it will get here within a reasonable amount of time, and you don't have to order two of them and call it a sample. 

If you don't get a BMS with a built in e-switch, get a vedder switch from somebody, they're more compatible with regen than the flier switches, although the flier types do hold up pretty well depending on where you get them.

Ok I was playing with some of the 3D printers getting max size on each platform and with the board dimensions from custom boards I can go with 12s2p and thank you for a battery choice I'll check them out on liion wholesale site.

I'm not saying that axle's VESCs are bad. But I would definitely consider an Enertion or Ollin Board Co. VESC. I wasted $100 on a VESC that threw me off the board after a week of use. Turned out it was manufacturer defect and I was SOL because that company assumed it was user error and I didn't have the experience to notice the defect.

$170 for a working VESC is a lot better than $166 but eventually buying the $170 later.

I know it sounds like a lot, but get the warranty.  It's really worth it. Especially if you are new to this.  These VESCs are still in beta and small errors cause major problems.

Ok small update I'll be 3D printing the enclosure for my battery I'll be printing out of a carbon nylon filament should be tough enough I'm currently making it in inventor I'll post up here when I'm done and I bought some of tht el wire stuff omg I can't wait this board is going to be awesome.

The board came looks amazing, I got to say I'm a little worried about routing into it's a little on side the thin side

I had the same problem with Enertion vesc 3 broke due to manufacturer fault but they won't refund, one caused me to be thrown off. After the paypal claim was closed and I still requested a refund (as is my right) they have stopped contact. 
I would suggest OllinBoard VESC
Enertion seem to be hit and miss as what's good and what's absolute shit but from what I can see of the chaka VESC he's really thought it all through when making them, they fit so nice into the space cell enclosure (where as enertion vesc are a pain to fit) and the shrink wrap around it is much nicer, it's also cut around each port unlike that of the plastic wrap around the enertion vescs

I took a super long break from this. I recently started up again, and was going to update when it was finsished but the wait for parts is killing me so I'll post what I got and update later 
First I used the enertion motor mount file that @onloop posted thanks again I think this mount is rock solid 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/8/18df0552538925fba3d0ff75d9374684862816dc.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/3/63e19601d0825792c7ed90efe55e7fbb92a033a6.jpeg" width="666" height="500">
Then 3D printed a vesc enclosure off of thingaverse 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/8/68edef3ed1a450fc9a327df28132be149e3917f0.jpeg" width="375" height="500">
I loved what @longhairedboy with the el wire stuff so I took a dremel and went to town 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/9/c9206a13fd38ccfd37362548187fc92c9457245d.jpeg" width="375" height="500"> 
After that I just made a second motor mount for my second motor 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/1/b1a1030fc8b8a9273135c71337c09bbf9d1e9a71.jpeg" width="666" height="500">
I really liked the idea I saw from a few people and decided to route wires thru the board
 <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/3/63949892673eded8060a390c26c53f5477c68288.jpeg" width="666" height="500">
unfortunately forgot to take pictures of tht but @longhairedboy has a really good topic about it.
After I did the channel I placed the wire and started epoxying every thing down I think the wire came out really nice but I heard it's a weird pattern
 <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/3/330f31faf71a6b1b70d62d4a7f172b107024f244.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/4/34f4dfac0de9280252392bad63f697c445b4de53.jpeg" width="375" height="500"> 
Then I just wanted a picture of it together and put the wheels on 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/c/acc4c9f16c9aa2c9efa9c35a0ad910e3bb8cdd1e.jpeg" width="500" height="500">
Finally got the battery from nykon actually came kinda quick (like a month)
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/9/994ab4ba7c5ea7acbadf7bd31fe300e1f0c014c5.jpeg" width="375" height="500">
Soo that's where I am at. working on wiring the battery waiting on vescs, and bms, charger and a few other things if you see I did something wrong or want to provide some tips on soldering the batteries together that would be much appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask I'm not an expert but I can try and answer.

No the enrtion file is a solid works file but I used cam software to write gcode. Yea I can send it to you but it won't be all that good if your machine can read it what cnc do you have  I coded it for a personal tormach with the he new Linux operating system
