This is the shopping List for my planned e-longboard build. I don't have a Board yet but i probably going to buy a used one. I have added the cost at the end of the items they are in Swiss francs and are about the same as USD. 

**ESC**

I have ordered this VESC, it seems to be as reliable as the maytech one and it is the cheapest i found
- FLIPSKY FSVESC V4 50A SK8-ESC w/ 5V/1.5A BEC for Electric Skateboard RC Car Z2J1 **69.-** [(ebay)](https://www.ebay.de/itm/FLIPSKY-FSVESC-V4-50A-SK8-ESC-w-5V-1-5A-BEC-for-Electric-Skateboard-RC-Car-Z2J1/382473004835?hash=item590d2ae723:g:JQYAAOSwWDBbCRIQ)

First wanted to buy this one but missed the 4. July sale
- FLIPSKY FSESC 6.6 based upon VESC® 6 + Aluminum Case **145.-** (flipsky.net)

**Motor**

Least expensive 63mm motor, not sure about the quality. It should be possible to run it at 12s.

- KEDA 63-64 190KV Brushless Outrunner 10S 2000W **52.-** [(hobbyking)](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/kd-53-30-high-voltage-brushless-outrunner-190kv.html)

Same price as the one from ebay but the phase wires seem to be much thicker. The D-Shaft is not ideal because i dont know if the pulley will fit.

- 190KV SL D-shft: 190KV, sensorless, D-shape shaft **55.-** [(aliexpress)](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/BLDC-outrunner-motor-6368-190KV-280KV-620KV-22-48V-large-torque-for-electric-balancing-board-scooter/32844026701.html?aff_platform=link-c-tool&cpt=1520538469571&sk=E276Qnm&aff_trace_key=00e458c216a34e03a1d0f4a33b5df405-1520538469571-09558-E276Qnm&terminal_id=306dd57aef12402188e2b6c964965c37)

Good price and kV but the phase wires are too small, i would have to replace them sooner or later. This Motor also has a D-Shaft, so im not sure if the pulley will fit.

- High-Efficience-Brushless-Motor-170KV-C6374-Electric-Skateboard-Longboard **54.-** [(ebay)](https://www.ebay.com/itm/High-Efficience-Brushless-Motor-170KV-C6374-Electric-Skateboard-Longboard-/173372466337?rmvSB=true)

Cheap but not enough power, maybe good for a dual motor setup?
- New Arrival Brushless Outrunner Motor N5065 270KV 1665W For DIY Electric Skate Board 1820W 320KV **30.-** [(ebay)](https://www.ebay.ch/itm/Brushless-Outrunner-Motor-N5065-320KV-For-DIY-Electric-Skate-Board-Kit-K7E1-K5C2/253253277278?hash=item3af712565e:g:E3cAAOSwDEtaBnoG)

Seems to be a good motor, but because its over 65.- i would have to pay high customs tax.

- turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor **80.-** [(hobbyking)](https://hobbyking.com/de_de/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-192kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html)

**Board**

Not decided yet, i will probably go for a used Board from ebay, they are cheap here **30.-**

UPDATE: I got a Globe Spearpoint Bamboo, bought it second hand for  **22.-** [(pictures)](https://www.sportmania.ch/de/longboard-globe-bannerstone-bamboo-red-8501.html)

**Remote**

I will not use that remote. There are a few threads on this forum about it and it seems to be very unreliable.

- 2.4GHz 2 Channels Wireless Fernbedienung Empfänger Für Elektrisches Skateboard **34.-** [(already ordered from ebay)](https://www.ebay.ch/itm/2-4GHz-2-Channels-Wireless-Fernbedienung-Empfanger-Fur-Elektrisches-Skateboard/162652095618?hash=item25ded20482:g:HYYAAOSwT~ZZsjih)

I did not hear anything bad about this remote, its not as small as the nano but should be more reliable. Its also very cheap.

- Radio 2.4GHz Remote Controller + Receiver Binding Plug For Electric Skateboard **16.-** [(ebay)](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Radio-2-4GHz-Remote-Controller-Receiver-Binding-Plug-Electric-Skateboard-/263454389014?clk_rvr_id=1590417121276&rmvSB=true)

This one is even bigger but its the most reliable.

- HK-GT2B 3CH 2.4GHz Transmitter and Receiver w/Rechargable Li-ion Battery **28.-** [(hobbyking)](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingr-tmhk-gt2b-3ch-2-4ghz-transmitter-and-receiver-w-rechargable-li-ion-battery-1.html)

- DIY Remote with Telemetry [(link)](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/diy-trigger-style-remote-with-telemetry-complete-guide/48231)

**Motor Pulley**

For 8mm or 10mm shaft motors, should not go smaller than 14t.

- 5M 12T-60T Timing Pulley Without Step Synchronous Wheel For 15/20mm Width Belt **4.-** [(ebay)](https://www.ebay.com/itm/5M-12T-60T-Timing-Pulley-Without-Step-Synchronous-Wheel-15-20mm-Width-Belt-/162868464086?var=&rmvSB=true)

**Wheel Pulley**

I need a big wheel pulley for my setup, most kits come with 36 or 40t only so i will have to print one or modify

looks solid. With that short of a belt, not too many teeth are going to be in mesh with the motor pulley, which is something to keep in mind. Then again, i'm running a similar belt length 2x9mm with 15t and 44t so you should be alright

I wonder why they include two belts 265 and 255 in the kit but its the cheapest for ABEC wheels that i have found. 

I'm a little bit worried about the Remote i have ordered. I read to late that there seem to be reliability issues with this version.

I'm still unsure with a few things, maybe you can help me.

1. Which motor should i choose, the 190kV 6368 is offered on [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/BLDC-outrunner-motor-6368-190KV-280KV-620KV-22-48V-large-torque-for-electric-balancing-board-scooter/32844026701.html?aff_platform=link-c-tool&cpt=1520538469571&sk=E276Qnm&aff_trace_key=00e458c216a34e03a1d0f4a33b5df405-1520538469571-09558-E276Qnm&terminal_id=306dd57aef12402188e2b6c964965c37) sensored or sensorless, would you go with sensors? Or maybe even with the 170kV sensorless from [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/High-Efficience-Brushless-Motor-170KV-C6374-Electric-Skateboard-Longboard-/173372466337?rmvSB=true) it seems to be bigger (70mm) and they claim more power (2900w)

2. Is the 5M14T pulley to small? Should i go with 5M15T?

3. Are the clone wheels from [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1Set-4pcs-97X-52mm-Cruiser-Wheels-Fits-Longboard-Long-Skateboard-Drop-Cruiser-SHR78A/32398103317.html?spm=a2g0s.8937460.0.0.48212e0efnqJUl) any good? Or do i have to worry about wobbling and worse?

4. Will the [48T wheel pulley 3d Print version from JohnAlbrecht](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/flywheel-48-tooth-wheel-pulley-download-cad-and-stl/33773) fit on the 97mm abec clones? Can i even go bigger like 50T? Is there maybe a aluminium or stainless alternative in that size?

Thank you!

The BKB 6374 190kv Motor is solid as a rock, sealed can too.  I have a set I've been running for over a year.
https://buildkitboards.com/collections/motors/products/6374-190kv-motor

The TB 6374 190KV is also great, I have a set on my Bludgeon/6 Shooter build and another set on my Gear Drive build, no issues at all.
collections/electric-skateboard-motors/products/electric-skateboard-motor-6374-190kv

The BKB 15t 15mm Motor Pulley is only $9, a lot cheaper than most places, 15t 15mm is the standard for a single motor build.  
https://buildkitboards.com/collections/pulleys/products/15t-15mm-motor-pulley

Or you could get this TB pulley kit that has the motor & wheel pulley plus a belt.
collections/electric-skateboard-pulley-belt-combo-kits/products/36t-kegel-pulley-15mm-combo-kit

The BKB motor mount is simple and it works well.
https://buildkitboards.com/collections/motor-mounts/products/motor-mount-1

Get the [36T ABEC Pulley 15mm Combo Kit](collections/electric-skateboard-pulley-belt-combo-kits/products/36t-abec-pulley-15mm-combo-kit) instead (KEGEL pulley won't fit in the wheels) :slight_smile:

Yes its going to be a single build, i dont have the board yet but there is an Auction for a Globe Spearpoint Bambo that finishes in 2 days. I will probably have to do a custom motormount because the trucks will not be compatible with the mounts they are selling online.

@legend27 Cool, thanks im definitly going to check out those shops.

I would stick to 8mm Motor shaft set up .. also I find that 14/40 gearing is the sweet spot for decent braking and acceleration with a 190KV single on 12S .. It will pull a 15/36 or 16/36 but it will take 300+ feet to stop from top speed

Finished the motor mount and attached the wheel pulley. Sadly there was not enough space to leave the tracks drop trough..

Now im waiting for the belt. I'm also thinking about how to buld the case for the battery and esc.

I had to make some improvements on the board and the motor. 

The motor mount was flexing and the belt started skipping so i welded a small triangle in place. It is better now but the belt still skips when braking hard so i will probably add a idler pulley next.

The second problem was that the motor started breaking unexpectedly, i first tought that it hits the mount or board somewhere becaus this happend only wheen steering in corners. 

Then i realized that because of the movements the copper strands in the motor rubbed against each other and created a short. 

I opend the motor, cut the bad copper strands and soldered silicone wire in place. I also fixed them with cable ties so this problem will not reproduce.

All in all i am not too happy with the quality of the KEDA 63-64 Motor, its still working but other than the cable problem, there is some wobble and i had some set screws come loose.

Mounted a big 13s6p battery, its crazy fast. Sadly the ground clearance is too low, its like a lowered sports car and speed bumps are the enemy. 

I added more reinforcements to the mount because it was still flexing a little bit. Its rock solid now.

I managed to shred my first belt while driving over gravel. But whats even worse, the stones got into the motor and destroyed the windings :frowning:

Dang I have just finished my first build with this same motor!
Will definitely watch out for gravel and maybe add a 3d printed cover..... 
Looking good though, my 100mm boa wheels are ordered
