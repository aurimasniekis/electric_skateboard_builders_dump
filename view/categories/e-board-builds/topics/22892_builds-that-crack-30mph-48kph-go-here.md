Break 30 on the flats with these tires, my urethane is calculated for 40mph when I get the time to machine the wheel mounts.

Dropped the rear stear to 2 deg. Broke 40mph on gps and finally held the throttle wide open. The race board rode straight and stable. The reward was the math was very close. Time to add some gear. Next goal 45. üèÅ<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/a/6a2bd1d06965624bced047d1a5fa8520c639f40e.jpg" width="690" height="419">

@MoeStooge  Can you explain the steering mechanism of your board?

It looks very unique!

I wasn't happy with the axle walk that the trucks had and developed this three link steering system from my background in open wheel oval track racing. Easiest way to explain:  Axle pivots off an adjustable heim joint that allows ride height adjustment and also controls the track centerline of the axle. Two adjustable radius rods are mounted to pick up points on the axle and frame triangulating  the axis that the axel rotates on. Raise the radius rods on the frame pickup points and this increases the steering. Lower to reduce steering.  This setup reduces axel walk to zero and allows me full adjustability of front and rear axles. I can make it turn a 9' circle or flatten the radius for controlled high speed turning.   No dampener on this run but in the works.

@MoeStooge  Sounds really good. I hope you make it one day to explain it in details with maybe some tips on how to make such axles at home too..

Do you also need to weld some parts or you can mount them using other options, such as screws etc?

Yea, hand fabrication and welding required. I have a bolt on version, should be done in a week or two for wood deck application.

My experience has been, as rear stear is decreased, stability increases. My 36mph run  had 8deg of rear stear and was unstable. With 2deg of R stear 40 felt as stable as 20mph.

Its horrible for vibration. 
like its a great board. its super fast. But it is super stiff. if you dont like vibrations dont get carbon fibre.

I'm actually selling mine because It's too hard and too fast for me.

Put a disclaimer on that when you sell it. It's a killer for sure ü§ò. Do the hub motors with the rubber sleeves add to the vibrations?

[/quote]

i'd say so. I have added pig piles soft risers under the trucks and they definitely make an improvement.

![20180419_185407|281x500](upload://wVzhEI4rxx7UdcgbMSvahuXurZW.jpg)

37mph on this guy. 1.6:1 gear ratio with 90mm flywheels.

Reaching 37 is not exactly easy, I have to tuck tight and low but it happens most rides I take on roads... Whereas oddly enough just reaching 35mph is quite easy with a moderate tuck. Dual 6734 / 30A each is plenty enough torque for me. It climbs pretty much every hill in my area without slowing down on the steep ones and still accelerating pretty darn good up even the moderately steep hills... which makes me happy.

I'd love to get a 12S and pump 50A to each vesc at some point, drop down to 1.5 or 1.4:1gear ratio. I miss the days of bombing mountains and doing downhill competitively. This board gets me so much closer to that feeling than I can on analogue, but still its just not there yet. I'd love to be able to push past 45mph easy if I gave it the throttle for it (and had the Ps for enough brake force to compensate, since I haven't tried sliding one of these yet).

This one consistently gets me to, about, 32mph. The Strava app shows me going 42mph at some point, but I think it was probably a glitch. :grin:
