Finally finished my eboard. Took 40 min to put together. Finding the right board took weeks.

Parts;

Enertion pro drive+ motor  and truck kit
Enertion space cell pro4
Enertion Vesc
Honey Velocity 42 inch deck.

Just finished up taking it for a spin and i have to say its pretty impressive so far. Tomorrow I'll take it for a long ride and share my thoughts.

Not sure what it's call but got it from Enertion. It has a little ring hold

This one. Like the feeling of it. Not sure why it's an old model.

You had influence in my decision :) 

Thank you. Good recommendation!

So far with only the mono drive I've clocked 38 kph with more up its sleeve! I've completed 24km on one charge with 40% battery remaining. I weigh 95kg. Are these good numbers?

So far I'm loving the board with the exception of what I believe to be interference/jamming on the odd occasion. Which I've discovered is irrelevant to the battery status.

Has anyone had a similar experience? Is the receiver and winning remote to blame?

I've posted about "stuck throttle" or unresponsive brakes using the winning remote before and know a couple other users here with similar issues. I've switched remotes for this reason and have been doing well with my new remote that I plan to sell on here in late october/early november.

As for range, sounds like you're getting decent range with it! You should be getting about 36km per charge going on flats.

Thanks @Jinra , what remote are you using?

Awesome, thought it was good for my weight. 

Anyone wondering if one motor is enough, rest assured. The Enertion pro drive + carries my frame up some decent hills and I haven't felt much heat (maybe because it's winter here). Credit where credit is due @onloop. This is not a fanboy post (if you think it is read my posts around my purchase)  just some assurance to those looking to move into the diy but don't have the budget for 2 of everything.

You can get one from http://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/handheld-electric-remote if you want it right away. I think it's an older revision though. You can also order through benchwheel directly, but it may take some time to get to you.

You will be very happy. Make sure you thread lock everything properly. My motor mount got lose yesterday and damaged the gearing on the wheel. Good news though. Ordered 2 replacemence last night from Enertion and they posted this morning!!!! Thanks @EnertionSupport .

I bought red and blue. Where do you think I should use blue (semi-perm) and where to use red?

I only use blue and it's good for everything, just make sure you give it 24 hours to cure.

Great, now I don't know what to do. I ordered the "old" remote from Enertion when I was getting parts, they refunded me $20USD and sent me a "better but cheaper" Winning remote. Hope I don't die

I'm not sure if it's an issue with all the winning remotes, but I know mine had issues. @Lizardking0069 confirmed it wasn't the receiver and was actually the remote giving him problems. 

It works 99% of the time, but occasionally it'll get stuck or not respond to brakes for 1-2 seconds, which to me is enough to warranty not using it. It never got stuck at high speed, but I was more worried about brakes not responding because since you don't know at the moment that they're not responsive, you brake more, and when it finally kicks back in, you're braking way too hard.

Thanks for the slight reassurance @Jinra, I'm using a carbon fiber deck from Hi5ber so I'm already afraid of potential signal cut off. 

The receiver they sent me with the remote doesn't have an antenna hanging out of it either, not sure if I'm supposed to solder a wire to it myself.

It has a PCB antenna, which should be enough. I soldered on an extra antenna to mine to see if it would help, but alas, the problem persists.

It's not extremely bad, just be aware. Especially when off the board so it doesn't take off on you.

Just doing some testing over the last 2 weeks and found some tips for the winning remote. Riding to drop off and pick up my drycleaning I noticed interference occurred in 2 particular locations. The board would have a mind of its own. Now I removed a ring I had and released from holding the grip in my palm basically holding the unit with 2 fingers and it eliminates the interference. How are you going with your remote?

I noticed mine had issues when I got off the train. Only tested twice, but happened each time. Swapped remotes after that.

still haven't done enough riding to see issues. I just rebinded the remote to fix the "fail safe" feature since the board brakes when I turn off the remote while it's running. That's fixed.

I'm limiting my speed and distance right now since I still have to open it up and make a few more adjustments

For me it's the same place every time till I release the grip which I'm sure as a result provides better connectivity. Still waiting to hear back re benchmark remote from a supplier here in Australia.
