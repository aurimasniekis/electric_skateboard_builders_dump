# Trampa mountain board. Buy or build?

So I have been eyeing the 2019 Trampa mountain boards.
https://www.trampaboards.com/2019-pro-belt-driven-electric-mountainboard-p-25948.html#
They seem to have an improved enclosed belt drive and with dual VESC 6 the price does not seem too bad.
I don't really like the open 6364 motors, but otherwise they look like a solid build.
Another option would be to get the deck, trucks, wheels etc from trampa and build a board with dual focboxes and 6374 motors and e-toxx gear drive.
From a draft spreadsheet I made, it seems the final cost will be more or less the same in both cases.
Also I weigh 78kg without gear (so 85-90kg with everything on including a backpack). I am torn between the 16 vs the 17 ply.
I have no mountain boarding experience so have no idea what I would prefer as far as stiffness goes.
So far I am leaning towards the 16ply as I am afraid that if the board is too stiff it will become very tiring in the rocky terrain we have here.
I am open to any ideas and suggestions.

e-toxx gear drive all the way ;)
iÂ´m 85kg and very happy with 16ply.
not too stiff not too flexy as for my taste.

You have to weigh in the hours here, theres considerably more tinkering with one of the options. Also getting everything in the same parcel and time is always a nice plus.

Personally havn't tried trampas own closed drive, bet its awesome. I own an etoxx spurr drive tho and have nothing bad to say there either.

Getting a prebuilt board is definitely easier for me. I have no problem building it myself but honestly I would rather spend my limited free time riding it. Plus I would not have to ship a hanger to Germany and order all the other stuff from various vendors.
This way I only have to build the battery (probably 12S7P 30Q ) and until then I could ride the board with the lipos I have for my RC helis (2x 5000mAh Thunderpower packs and 2 x5000 Turnigy packs) as long as they fit in the battery box.

I bought a complete deck from them, a couple months ago... Just missed the new belt drive system... My weight 75 kilos, 16 ply, 154kv motors, 2 Vesc 6, 4 6000mAh HRB Lipos, 14 teeth motor pulley (I have bought 15 teeth to commute within my city). Very fast shipping, great price, high end quality....My only concern are the motor mounts, they are big and bulky, and I was pissed of that I missed for little the new mounts (much better of course). So, yes I will probably buy the new Emtb from Trampa again and again, but if I have to replace the 2017 Pro motor mount of my almost new board, I will buy the E Toxx. Also you should look at the new Trampa barrels, instead of the spring set up for your trucks. Hope this help you with your decision... Over all .... I am extremely happy!

I've been there some weeks ago!! But I decided to do it myself... surely it takes more time and lots of hours, but I reckon I'll end up with a better product, my trampa is on its way and I'm using 2 focboxes in an aluminium case from Servisas and chains, sprockets and the rest of the stuff needed it'll be ordered soon.... sometimes I forget if my hobby is riding or building my rideðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ that's just my opinion as noob here!

And you'll have more pride as you ride. Half of my joy while riding is the pride and hard work and mess ups that we're along the way. I don't have the same connection with the boards I bought ready to ride

Looks good.  But don't you just love Trampas write ups?

we have calculated a potential rage of well over 50 miles (calculated in my head &amp; needs to be testing before 100% claiming - need a Crash test Dummy to try the range out if anyone has the tome to give it a go!!) but of course this option will not be cheap &amp; there are plenty of alternatives of batteries if your beginning to run on a budget...

This is an English company btw

I have made it this far in life by not believing everything I hear or read. :wink:
If I go for a 12S7P my guess is the range will not exceed 40km.
I mean I barely get 30-35km with my 12S5P with psychotiller sixshooters and smaller motor the way I am riding my current board around where I live.
Imagine a board with bigger off road wheels, heavier, slightly bigger motors and 40% more capacity but used off road.

I understood your post and agree with it. It seems like a draft that needs editing before making it to press.
I just had to answer about the claimed range since, well I just had to :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Hey Schulerbible. Any idea what this guys parts list is on his MTB or were you just sharing the e-toxx drive?

P.S. I'm a NEWB and want to build something like the video you shared. How do I figure out what he's running?

But how about google the stuff:

I got another question.
What would you choose? 136kv or 154kv.
I will definitely use the largest motor pulley Trampa provides (15T) to get as many teeth engaged as possible.
According to this gearing chart the 154kv would give me a top end of 52km/h which since I am not @Kug3lis think will be too much for a mountain board and I am afraid I would lose torque and overheat the motors more easily compared to the 136kv. I live in Greece and during the summer it can get really hot.
On the other hand lower turn motors can usually output more power so I may get a more powerful board with the 154kv.

i didnÂ´t overheat with dual sealed 190kV on 11S.
for me i can say iÂ´m happy that i have now dual 170kV and 12s and can push my board over the 50km/h when ever i want.
i would take the 154kV as long as you donÂ´t go crazy offroad.
if itÂ´s too less torque you still can change to 72th wheel pulley later.

Same internal structure as the SK8 and similar to SK3. Made by the same manufacturer most likely.

Compare the complaints about these motors with any other sealed motor and you will realize it is one of the best options for 63xx we currently have, even though that may not be enough with the motor amps and voltage some of us are using.

If the motor becomes too hot there are a few settings that can be tweaked. If these motors survive the high temp abuse instead of disintegrating like so many others, they deserve a  top 3 spot :stuck_out_tongue:

Not to mention, no shitty warranty service like 50 percent off on the next purchase or sending it back to China.

It was referred to as semi sealed by a few.
Anyway, those whole pulled them apart noticed similar internals compared to the turnigy offering. That includes the fan Frank speaks of.

The true purpose is motor axle support.

What kind of specs are you seeing from this board (speed, range, etc) also which batteries are you using? Lipos or li ion and which ones ( what arrangement of batteries and which brand) also what range and power do you see from each type of battery and which would be best to use.

## \#55 Posted by: taz Posted at: 2019-03-31T07:45:34.842Z Reads: 66

It is a 30Q 12S7P.
Range is around 40-45km.
Top speed, don't know, don't care.
It is a mountain board, I got it to use off road for jumping etc so it is geared for torque not speed.

If I want to go fast, I have my Evo.
