Hi there guys I am looking to build my 1st Board in the next couple weeks. I was a boosted owner but sold that just recently and decided to go on the DIY route since I want to have fun doing it and build a smaller board. What I am looking to get out of this board is to be able to ride up the hills near me and for a good distance on flat ground. The Dual+ handled my hills pretty good on Pro mode not to sure what % grade that equates to but want something similar. I am also wanting a 20mph speed not sure if I chose the right components to reach my desires let me know what I can change to do so. I am 6'2" and weight 150lbs if that helps in any way. Also I am going with enertion parts because they seem to be all I know about and I have a 10% off code let me know if there is other stuff out there that will beat it for the price or out perform it for a bit more. My BUDGET is not set but I really want to keep it under $1500 if possible with taxes and such.

I would just buy a raptor, you are using almost everything Enertion and have a budget that fits the price of the raptor. 

If you are in the US I would go with  much better service and very good quality.

The Raptor would be a good option and would beat the boosted dual+ in torque,speed and range.
If you are determined to build your own,  then I would recommend getting 2 5s Lipos and put them in series for 10s
10s will give you the power and speed your looking for but I doubt that 6s will.

If you have a 10% off code that you could use on the Raptor, That's a good savings.
And go with dual drive if you want a real hill climber.
