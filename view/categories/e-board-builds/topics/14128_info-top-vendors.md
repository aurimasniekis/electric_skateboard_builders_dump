I myself live in Belgium and i'm always spending tons of time to just find a good vendor for certain parts.
That is why I think it will be handy to have a list with top vendors for certain regions.

If you've made a purchase, or found a vendor somewhere that looks promising then please post their info here:
> **- Continent**
> **- Country**
> **- Vendor type (electronics, batteries, motors, decks,...) (can be more then one)**
> **- Vendor name**
> **- Vendor site/location**

PS.
Other posts will be deleted, just to keep this topic clean.
Feel free to pm any user for further info about a vendor.

Kind regards.
