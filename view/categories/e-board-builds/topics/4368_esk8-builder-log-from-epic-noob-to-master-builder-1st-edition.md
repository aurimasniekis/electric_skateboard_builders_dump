Hello gents,

1st of all, I would like to thank every single one of you who have shared their experience building eSK8 and/or eSK8 components.  Without you, I would never have done what I am about to do...  Build my own!  Unlike certain people, which shall not be named here today, _(Referring to the saga over the weekend)_, I did my homework :smile: and educated myself. Quite a lot actually.

As I said in the introduction thread, I am an epic noob.  However, the information, links, images, people, warnings, do's and don't found here made me a neophyte ;) in less then a few weeks. 

Now it is time to test them new sea legs O mine!  Yar! ...  Here it goes...

Everyone, meet Sweetness (Yup, I'm naming her!)  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c6098f3302406849eeeba487070c895bcf2aea3e.jpg" width="550" height="309">

Sweetness is a Loaded Fat tail, flex 1.  Being I'm 175 pounds shes not too bendy which should keep the LIPO safe. And look at the curves on her Caliber trucks! Perfect for DIY's incoming motor mount!  She will be SWEET! 

Another part I already have in hand is this little pearl (Got it for 100$ CAD!).

I found it in a RC shop in Montreal (Canada), where I'm from. It is actually a 245kv according to the manufacturer.  I'll have to grind a flat on the shaft.  Not sure I am ready for a Keyway just yet.  

Anyone ever used a Power HD motor? I haven't seen the brand mentioned in any post but the brand looks legit... http://www.chd.hk/ 

I'm going for a VESC, which I already ordered from @chaka which should be sent in a week or so.  Everything else is on a UPS plane or truck somewhere around the world.  I'll keep updating this topic as I progress and will possibly youtube the whole thing.  If I do i'll let you know. 

Stay tuned....

Question for you guys.  I keep finding quotes here and there about 9mm belts not being strong enough on strong acceleration / breaking.

I know for a fact that the DIY kit I ordered from DIY comes with a 9mm belt.  

Now for the question...  Is DIY's pulley wide enough to support a 12mm belt?

Bahahaha! WELCOME!!! to the forum. You may want to add a second motor and esc for 9mm or just buy a new 15mm belt and pulleys. The second option isnt expensive at all.

Thanks for the warm welcome :)

Guess i could also configure the VESC for slow acceleration and light breaking for now.  

Is it me or what I just wrote doesn't sound fun?

Any suggestions on where I could get 15mm pulleys (abec flywheels) and belts from?  I don't remember seeing those on @torqueboards store?

Because 15mm is cooler! :sunglasses:  Actually if you own caliber ii's with a 15mm pulley you'll have to grind a flat spot on the hanger to make it level if I'm not mistaken.

Ahhh! No grinding my precious ;).  

@Michaelinvegas 12mm would work.  Actually, I'm sure my incoming 9mm from DIY will work also.  I'm just looking for backup plans in case the belt does snap.

Have any links to share :).

@psychotiller do share also.

Ok, so I couldn't handle the excitement of working on my eSK8 yesterday.  Here is an update on my build.  I think it goes to show how much you guys have been teaching newcomers.  I had little to no stress handling all the following steps.

1. I started with the DIY V4 mount and pulleys & wheel
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/028504a7582c07ace77055704d4844f65ec92908.jpg" width="550" height="309"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/e1ea9858b419ab08774007ad29b20eebcbfaaeb3.jpg" width="550" height="309"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/5e136fa7e47366e4db2438917d09f718eb1b49ad.jpg" width="550" height="309">

2. Mark the pinion location on the drive shaft and grind flats. As suggested by the Intrawebs, I wrapped my motor in a TON of tape.  + added extra eye protection.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c1ef818c7aa6559e4aebe1465f86f99c96fc3ceb.jpg" width="550" height="309">

3. Remounted the whole thing with added thread lock.  I used Blue, will it hold?
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a97f0d9f331b87a6fcd8f02655c23f3e3a338f87.jpg" width="550" height="309"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/02692c5fb41dfb71f62e6b2d3a307af8cb31db20.jpg" width="550" height="309">


Voila, that is pretty much it for the mechanical part of things.  @torqueboards  V4 kit is really sweet and I strongly recommend it.  Not that I am a pro or anything ;) but I am having so much fun doing this, I can tell you now, this is the 1st of many. 

Moving on to the electrical

Here are my mean green batteries. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/0eedc8c35b892d2d7dd660373d6018eb44455297.jpg" width="550" height="309">

My motor only supports up to 8s so I went for 2 4s 10.0ah which I'll put in series.  Both came with XT90 plugs, which I had to swap up with XT60 for consistency stake.  

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/87a77b735d36e04fd9012b4446b2a9fd659be43e.jpg" width="550" height="309">

If you have to do this, ALWAYS DO ONE WIRE AT A TIME! ;).  Again, something I learned from you guys.

That is pretty much it for now, I'll start building the wiring and enclosure next while I wait for my VESC from @chaka. 



----------

And now for a few questions.

1. For my Antispark loop key, should it be wired on the Positive wire or negative wire?
2. I got this fuse box (below), should it be on the positive or negative wire?

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/9/9c4f93b3957fded0b6df27e7d0fca3342d8648e1.jpg" width="550" height="309"> 


Note, I intend to add both Loopkey and fuse on the wires between the VESC and batteries.

Thanks for the help guys.

Normally everyone uses the positive wire but it does not matter that much... But keep in mind that the XT-90S is not polarity safe. So be carefull that you will plug/solder it in correct!

[quote="DeathCookies, post:29, topic:2383"]
Today I rechecked my wiring and did find the mistake... I just soldered it like the wiring you have Seen before. Exactly like the wiring diagramm and that was my mistake. 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/optimized/2X/7/7e282727778eecae40ff5fbf95f60c1f66e747b0_1_479x500.PNG
In that wiring the polarity of the xt90-s loop key will be wrong! In the diagramm there is a Red positive cable to the left and the black negative on the right. But when we Look at the Battery cables they go the other way to the Esc... So i changed the polarity and blow my xt90-s. Thanks for the Input! I really appreciate this forum :wink:
[/quote]

Just look at the loop key! This diagram shows a wrong wiring for the loop key. The cables in this diagram needs to be switched.
I hope you get what i want to explain :D

## \#33 Posted by: Maxid Posted at: 2016-06-10T13:48:22.942Z Reads: 218

Do you mean that it has to be like this:
http://www.electricrc.co.kr/shop/images/ETC/AMASS/XT90S-03.jpg
with the resistor being on the red +line?

Also I don't think that a loopkey would care about polarity. Why should it matter? it just connects two lines and lets current flow through. It does not have a load attached to it but is just a "switch" - and it does not matter how you mount a switch.

Also what do you mean by "But when we Look at the Battery cables they go the other way to the Esc"? They are not different. You connect + and GND just like the batteries present it to you. I am really confused with what you are showing us here and don't see the problem in the diagram.

Edit: I also just read the entire thread about the polarity of your loopkey. Everybody told you that there is nothing wrong with the wiring and that there is no polarity of the loop key. Why are giving false information to other builders?

@EpicCel - The hub of the mount or clamp is towards the inside/center of the truck.

Last photo it looked correct though.

LOL! Yup, good catch and no, it is still reversed.  Works pretty well though ;).  I couldn't get the clamp farther into the truck for some reason without requiring grinding, which I didn't want to do on my beautiful Calibers.  

So I guessed it was the other way around.  Guessed wrong.  Think it will cause issues?

## \#40 Posted by: torqueboards Posted at: 2016-06-10T15:58:49.055Z Reads: 209

Is it because of your motor and short motor shaft why you did that? That's one of the reasons why I didn't go 15mm. Going 15mm, everyone would have to use my motor or a motor with a longer motor shaft.

It would be much harder to fix your board with the bolt holes on the opposite side and not as much clamping force to secure the motor mount. I'd personally mount them the right way IMO.
```

My shaft is actually just right.   I'll still do the tweak.

Quick question, do I really have to grind the truck to get the clamp in?  Or simply lightly hammering it in could do the trick?

Thanks again.

I started on 9mm and ate the belts during braking.  Depending on how fast you ride you normally need to stop faster than accelerate.  If someone pulls out in front of you ect.  I also started on 12:36, but there wasn't enough tooth engagement on the motor pulley (was trying to keep top speed down).  I went to 14:36 and that helped some but kept eating belts.  15mm now and on the first belt still.  Stopping from 25+ mph is more important than getting there in my point of view.

Are you using the heatshrink is that why you can't get it in more?

You should be able to get it in all the way before the tapered center.

Here is a little update for you all.  

So, as you know my batteries are HUGE.  I need range so I want doe these. 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/0eedc8c35b892d2d7dd660373d6018eb44455297.jpg

Problem is finding a case / enclosure to put these things in was quite a challenge.  I finally found this at Home Depot...
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/576d044ccde731e499b8d0fdc1dc2aca6791c8b5.jpg" width="550" height="309">

I had to Dremel the crap out of it and cut out a few holes for my fuse and XT-90s Loopkey. Good news it, everything fits perfectly and I still have a lot of clearance under the board thanks to the 90mm Flywheel clones. 


----------

Now for attaching the whole thing to the board.  Drilled 4 holes through the board and inserted a truck hardware.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/17290235ed236092bf5930f8f5e4ee7fa17fa32d.jpg" width="550" height="309">

Since this boars has a bit of flex, I added 4 rubber grommets so to give the box a bit of leg room.

And here is the result...

Next up, wiring and eventually the VESC, which has yet to ship.

Stay tuned..

Good evening eSK8ers,

Yet another update on my 1st noob build.  Now that all mechanical elements have been completed, I jumped to electrical.
I prepped all the wiring and enclosure to welcome my VESC once it arrives.  (Possibly shipping this week... cross fingers).

Here is the battery box with all the wire, fuse and loop key stuck in glorious hot glue!

Got it all wired for 2 X 4S in series.  As suggested by @Blasto , positive goes to my fuse then my XT90S loop key then across to the electronic box, which as yet to receive its beautiful VESC.

The box is already nicely separated which is sweet!   

And voila, this is what it looks like with everything closed up and ready to roll.

BTW, this thing will flex nicely with the dual enclosure, it keeps everything from snaping.  Im loving the spring! 
I'll shoot a few seconds of footage soon to demonstrate.

Man, I can't wait to ride it!  I can't get that VESC fast enough!  Please @chaka do your magic and send it over so I can enjoy this baby soon.

Have a nice evening all / rest of the day everyone

Hey eSk8ers,

I love this AWESOME community!  @Blasto and @JohnnyMeduse came over today to do  lend me a freaking VESC!  A VESC! They got my board going while I wait for my final VESC from @chaka.  

This, my friends, is what I call a community. I also learned a few things about soldering correctly ;).  Thanks guys! 

I went for a ride just now and MAN does that thing fly compared to my E-GO.  The acceleration is a bit slow, I'll have to tweak that, but the SPEED!  Mans the speed is SICK!  

I hit 30kph and stopped there.  Its late, getting dark.  I'll try it again tomorrow.

What an awesome day this has been...
