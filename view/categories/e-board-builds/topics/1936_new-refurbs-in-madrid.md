I'm following him on instagram after i saw him like some of my stuff.  there's some crazy shit going on over there for sure. Loving it. 

and yeah you can totally hot glue cylindrical cells together. There's nothing wrong with that. They're already encased in a metal cylinder, they're not like foil pouches which *gasp* are often just glued together, if they're even glued... multistars are not glued, just shrink wrapped. As long as the whole thing is encased in something its all good for the most part.
