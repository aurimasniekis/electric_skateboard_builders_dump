The long awaited Hyperbeast build finally started. I'm naming this the Stealth Bomber because literally everything is black and I dont want to alter the matte finish of the deck anymore and I will be bombing the SF hills with this thing. Original plan was to sand down some parts to return to this render with CF showing at the wheel weel and edge. but realized that would require taking off too many layers (few Polyester, thick Epoxy then Carbon)

* [Raptor 2.1 hubs kit](https://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-direct-drive-hub-motor-kit-r-spec/)
* 12s5p VTC6 Custom Cell Holder to fit 60 cells in a Single Stack enclosure
* Bestech D140
* Waiting to get a feather remote to finish the build, Will be using my modded Nano X for the mean while.



Just bolted the Hubs on and already Sexy AF

Testing the 12 cell Stagger stack holders. Very Staggered to decrease height.

I can only fit 5 of these holders in the small enclosure so either 10s6p or 12s5p. But I aint not p***y 45mph advertized 90kv hub here I go. 

![image|255x500](upload://45co15ARGEmWuzADcFILVCSY79l.png)
The wiring is the most annoying. I need to do a Serpentine and then route the end back to the front. which I made a big champfer at the empty spot. Also have to edit each Boxes to add divider for and raised buttons. The lid was never a flush fit to begin with so I'm ok with what I have. 

![image|489x268](upload://ygTJn4eD4Cn1ymIXzP60p6e3TBe.jpeg) 

There actuallty isn't a lot need to be done. Mostly just the battery building take the most time. then I will just drill holes for the 3.5mm bullets (eventually I want to cut a bigger hole and glue a MR60 as the external phase wire port). Drill 2 holes for push button and charge port and that's about it.

I ran out of Orange PETG so used the clear ones I bought cus I can't waste anytime. Goal is to have a functional board by Friday. Clear PETG is definitely less flexible but compression is still great.

Wired up 6s so far

![image|246x500](upload://nyymM1VsmPz5MKUWXHCuUytfwev.jpeg)


Update (1/24/19):

Took many hours to wire up the battery and the BMS. The cell holders with braid on the side (insulated with fish paper and ducttape) is a tight fit in this box.

Ended up just eye ball and drilled 8 holes and and fitted the phase wire through. The wire are just long enough to reach into the box so I use heatshrink to hold them together.
![IMG_20190124_034835|666x500](upload://8J1DjuUgzUT6pAymwETdhIZBQMy.jpeg) 

Here's the electronics. BMS just flowing on top for the moment and unity double sided taped down. Haven't drill the holes for the charge port and power button since I havent decide where yo pull them.

P.S. If these hubs break down and I don't hit 45mph I'll declare @Hummie > @onloop. atm I view them as separate category product since hummies are only 84mm but has Centrax CP.

That’s a convenient way of building a battery pack, but Is this reliable(cells contact done by pressure)? Would there be any need for spot welding or soldering? How would you connect the bms wires?

161C motor temp yikes. 

Do you lose a lot of torque when they get hot?

Within the first 7 min they already reach 90C. 

Very noice build though. I also wonder how well the compression fit will hold. Time will tell.

Yes they do get hot really quick. partially because I was "stress testing" (mostly just for fun), 70% throttle going up to 25mph and breaking for the next red light. I know if I went 15-20mph I dont have to wait at all but I was having so much fun. partially I do think these hubs are very inefficient, metr told me I was doing 28Wh/mile during the second posted ride. not sure how accurate that is. I will do more testing.

When the hubs gets hot you really dont feel a difference until it hits temp throttling.

The cell holders are solid. I ended up soldering to closer all the ends of the braids and then melted the solder while the braid is in position. the solder melts and bonds with the cell holder and got stuck to it. I was surprised at how well it did. besides from my poor jst crimping job, which I fixed later yesterday, and initially unbalanced cells (0.2v difference) it performed quite well.

Yes those hubs are incredibly inefficient, I got quite similar results. You are lighter than me, in my case they heat up quite fast even in the 15-20 mi/h range.
Let's see what the new Unity firmware will bring, Enertion says it's because of the wrong Beta.
How is the coasting or freeroll on yours compared to the Hummies? I was surprised by the strong drag.

Coasting is definitely better. I thought they already fixed that beta value. I found out about it in one of their production video. I would assume they have defaulted the value to the unity. (Althought the UI still defaulted to 12 pole pairs.)
```

## \#33 Posted by: goldrabe Posted at: 2019-01-25T14:11:31.466Z Reads: 210

```
Is the new Firmware already out?
I was just aware that they suggested setting the Beta to 3900 by yourself. But for some people, including me, it will not fix the problem because the motors show temperature differences of  more than 40°C across them. Bara said this could be from dodgy thermistors. But as you said no stuttering and powerloss even at 160°C so I hope it's really only the wrong Beta. 
Nice build and I am looking forward to your comparison! 
Btw. how is the efficiency of the Hummies?

Finally, I replaced the lid. Old lid was too thick and flat af. All 8 holes for mounting the hinge were literally unusable. They all striped within 2 weeks of use. Screws fell off during a ride and I was scare AF that it would short something. 

Update:
* New lid clad 7065 1.5mm 21.125"x7.375" (should've gotten 7.5")
* Pop rivot to permanently secure the lid to the hinge.

Still need to do:
* Laser cut grip tape 
* Drill holes for push button and charge port
* Cable management

The only bad part is the new lid is a bit too flexy. I think I need to add a stripe of metal in the middle to stiffen it up and pretend that's meant for W concave.

Maybe put a foam or fiahpaer to separate the lid from electronics.

Yeah I'm too tired to think right now. Need to stop the lid from bowing up. Need to see if changing the underside of the lid to a full sheet will make that worse.

Well but did you actually stand on top of it? Otherwise I would maybe get a bit thicker lid so you can actually bend it to the shape you want or just add the layer underneath so you don't see it from the outside

I'll try the "W concave" beam first. Hopefully it would work. I really don't wanna make another lid. Maybe I can see if I can remake my battery to make it 1mm shorter. It's pushing the limits right now. Also not going down from 12s5p.

I see and why not stiffer only the edges (lateral) . I see quite thick foam there. You can add 1mm lid there and thiner foam.

Totally understand that you want to keep 12s5p otherwise why doing it :grin:

Yeh I saw the watt they suck. They are not really efficiently but I am sure powerful. I also see a lot ofbfmdofference compare to different motors I have tried. Some of them can really demand 1,5 times more current. Usually it comes down to more heat production

Still owe you guys a raptor hubs review. I'll get it done soon. Raptor vs Hummie comparison will take a little longer since I would prefer to provide Metr data for both on the same setup.

Old lid was too thick and flat af
[/quote]

Is the thickness the primary reason to replace? If not, you can use the steel lid with the pop rivets, and get the good fit back? You can add foam or plastic under the grip perhaps, to give more shape, if you hate the flatness.

Oh I see the lid has the threads for the hinge screws. Damn. Maybe another way to deal with it is to countersink the holes on top, get countersink screws, and add some nuts to the bottom?

If the material is steel then the easiest way it to get them welded together. Just few ponits inside at the level of the screw and threads and they will never move again.

I am not sure if it's just because of heat production. It's also a function of rpm and torque(assuming other factors are same). Let me see if Matlab has some simulations related to this.

Yeah the lid was too thick to fit my 12s5p boxes. And I really dislike the fact that it's just a flat piece of metal. You probably can use countersink screws but I like my pop rivots better :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

I'm sure it's just bad reading. Shoot! I totally for to to bring my temp gun again. I adjusted the beta to 3900 as @Deodand mentioned. Not sure if there's an official fix yet. The trucks definitely don't feel that hot.

Looks like consumption improved a bit, or just riding style, even so, almost 19 Wh/km

I don’t remember if I posted this before, but you can find the correct beta yourself, measure temperature and thermistor at ambient, then get a hair dryer, or a oven if you know that it won’t get above 70~80°C and leave it for an hour or more until the temp stabilize, measure resistance and temp of the motor itself again and plug the numbers here

https://www.daycounter.com/Calculators/Steinhart-Hart-Thermistor-Calculator.phtml

Another theory I have, the beta is correct, but the motor is getting so hot that it’s out of the thermistor valid range, I think the standard method of measuring beta is doing the procedure above using 25°C and 75°C, the datasheet say what temperatures were used

Let’s say we are actually at 120°C, since the equations that relates resistance and temperature is logarithmic, the error can shoot out of he real value really quick for extremes

EDIT: what I said appears to be true, take a look here https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/education/docs/datasheets/10kThermistor.pdf

Just as an example obviously, but at 125°C for this particular thermistor we have an increasing error

I think it's more of just style. we werent going fast at the beginning. cropped down to just the solo ride. (5:12 - end). it comes down to about 36 Wh/mile


I understand the increase inaccuracy at the extreme ends of the thermistor spec curve but still a little confused about how to measure beta. to get resistance value do I probe across the temp and 5v of sense wire?

Sounds like the replacement lid is just too thin. 

Perhaps you could hurdle over the lack of concave problem and the strength problem by building up a a layer of epoxy to simulate a concave, adding rigidity in the process, maybe add a backbone into it

I could understand the reason for the fall from the video. Was sudden speed wobbling or what? Good that you don't look too bit up. For a fall I did last year at way lower speed I got more damages than you. I would guess you were going pretty fast.
Recover and come back soon!
