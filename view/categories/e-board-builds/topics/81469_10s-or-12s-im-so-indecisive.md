I've read dozens and dozens of the countless posts on this topic and now i am adding one more for people to have to sift through (sorry about that).  My project has been going on now for several months and I literally change my mind on size and type of battery pack daily.  Now I'm at a point where I have to make a decision.  I hope the picture I attached posted, but if not, I am building a mountain board which I intend to use on and off road.  I am really not interested in going fast since I am old and no longer bounce.  My dilemma is due to me weighing 230 pounds and even though I don't want to go super fast I know that a higher voltage = lower amps which in turn = less heat.  So naturally I think 12S, but then I get worried about how fast this thing will go so the cycle of indecision revolves.  I'm sure that I am over thinking this.  Please, before being harsh and telling to just use the search function, I have and most posts deal with you younger lighter (170lb-ish) folks and most seem to be on street wheels.

Here are my specs.
MBS ATOM mountain board
203mm inflatable wheels with - 84 tooth pully 
Dual 6374 BKB 190KV 3200watt max 70amp motors -10 tooth pully 
FOCBOX Unity on preorder
15mm wide belts

Thank you very much for your help!!!

You will want to go fast eventually, just if not now limit some settings.

its also more risky. running at 12s is 84% of the vesc max voltage, id say 10s is a good balance of top speed and torque, but if you want pure torque 12s is definitely the way to go.

@Strobi1 the unity should do 12s no problems btw

More voltage means less current. As long as the ESC can handle the voltage, higher is better IMO. With Unity the 12s seems a no-brainer.

Why not 11s? If you can‚Äôt decide take the middle way. 
But one thing I have seen is the 10th motor pulley. Are you sure that‚Äôs gonna work out.
It‚Äôs a very low count, so belt slippage could appear.
If so you will need to go up 14th or similar.
So top speed would rise and as you don‚Äôt want that I would rather go with 10s.

Never mind about 10s 12s where did you get that motor mount and far more info on that thing there is necessary.  chop chop 

Cool build btw and 12s or you will probably regret it.  Just because the board does 40 mph does not mean you have to ride it at 40mph but the torque is easier to gear for with the extra voltage.  Future proofing.  Good luck.

Fair warning the stock tires on the atom 90 are absolute shit. Wore to nothing in less than 100 miles for me, left me stranded on a group ride. Also you‚Äôre gonna want a bigger motor pulley for both speed and prevention of jet slippage. And go 12S if you can afford it, it‚Äôs more fun

With 190kv 12s lion 10:84 on 203mm wheels you'll only get about 20mph. You'll definitely want more than that. I say 14 or 15 tooth motor pulley and 12s (for less heat) that'll get you to about 27 mph (maybe a little less because of weight)

I went 10S and regretted it. 

Waiting to buy a 12S battery at some point. 

At least on 10S I can gear the kind of speed i'd get on 12S, but not only am I already pushing more amps for the same wattage on 10S than 12S, gearing for speed on top of that just further increases the amp load. 

Go 12S.

I say take the 12s to get the motor efficiency you will likely want to counter the weight. 

Going too fast could happen on 10s as well, there‚Äôs no way other than self restraint to stop you going too fast In either case.

You will maybe have to learn some bouncing but mitigate that as much as you like with gear and self control & in time skill and experience 

From another old boy who does not bounce any more either

I am older and fatter (215lbs)

It depends what you want to use this for.  If you want a toy, probably 12S, if you want a tool, then 10S.

I'd go 10S.  10S is ridiculously fast, don't let anyone try to tell you it's not.  12S is 20% faster than "ridiculously"

You're feeding hard square waves into inductors with hard absolute maximums of 60V on the gate driver pins.  If you exceed 60V for a millisecond, it's toast.  Current and voltage have different failure modes.  Overcurrent breaks things slowly as they get too hot and can't cool fast enough.  Overvoltage breaks things instantaneously with a "pop" and is unforgiving.

If it wasn't for the rating on the gate driver, I'd say sure go for 12S or higher if you feel like it but for now we have to deal with that until we start migrating to the DRV8353.  Then folks will just want to use 20S instead of 18S....

WOW!! so many replies!  You guys are Awesome!  Sounds like the overwhelming conclusion is 12S.  I definitely understand the over voltage concerns of @b264 but Enersion doesn't seem too worried about using a 12S pack on their VESCs.  This board will be my source of transportation when overlanding, but also a toy all of the time I'm not.  @dareno so far all I've done (besides a bunch of research and shopping) is build the motor mounts from some plate aluminum. ![IMG_20190110_223731|690x316](upload://slEdlbBf4eCBl4hY7fzWSyEDe9n.jpeg) I mashed up a bunch of stuff that I found here and other sites and let it evolve into something I think will work well.  A bunch of you mentioned the extremely small pulley on the motor side of my build.  I am using 500mm x 15 mm wide belts in attempts to increase tooth engagement and surface area on these tiny pulleys.  This made my mounts really tall which I don't really find as aesthetically pleasing as something compact, but I hope that will prevent me from needing to add a tension pulley.  I have a few different pulley sizes (12, 15, and 20) that I will play if I shred these belts :tired_face: @anorak234 I've already noticed that these Atom wheels are less than stellar.  I have one wheel where the tire mounts out of round by over 1/4 inch!  hopefully, I'll only have to swap out the tires and be able to keep the wheels.  Now, not to hijack my own thread, LiPo or Li-ion?  LiPo is the easy button for me since i'll be top mounting these and they will pretty much be plug and play, but I have something drawing me to building a Li-ion even though I have none of the equipment to do so ( I guess, I just hate myself).  I have read a  lot of arguments back and forth about charge cycles and Li-ions being able to handle the amp draw better.  All I can see for my build is that li-ions are considerably lighter.  Thanks again for all of the replies!!!

Many people even do 13s on Focboxes, so 12s is perfectly safe imo. (I ride 12s too). As I understand it, the more cells you have in series, the less current you need to draw for the same wattage (which the ESC will convert into whatever speed you need.) Lower current per cell is always better for your battery in terms of longevity and heat. Also means you have better regenerative breaking. ~~So, depending on your enclosure, go for the option that minimizes current drawn per battery cell. In most cases, 12s will be that configuration.~~

~~If our ESCs allowed us to go with even higher voltages, I'm sure we'd make use of it ‚Äì even if we didn't need the extra speed. :)~~

Edit: For any given wattage, because each cell always has a constant voltage, irregardless of your configuration, each cell will be pushing out the same amount of current. (12s6p will be just as good for your batteries as 6s12p) So, if you don't need the speed of 12s, then go for the configuration that allows you to fit the most cells in your board. If that ends up being the same number (12s5p or 10s6p), then go for 12s, because it will give you the option of increasing your max speed if you need it. :)

some lipo's are able to handle higher amp draws, but if you go for 4P with Li-ions it shouldn't be a problem.

@rusins not sure about 13S but 12S is indeed perfectly safe and better for your batts in the long term.

Not quit sure about that, running vesc at higher voltages also produces more heat even though drawing less amps, because your drawing the same amount of watts

12 s just has the ability to push harder because it's not hitting the current limit of a motor compared to let's say a 6s

No, because the ESC changes output voltage going to the motors for you. :)

Edit: But IIRC, it is more efficient if the voltage conversion is close to 1:1 / if you go at max speed. Going at max speed will increase your range, or at least I think I've heard that somewhere.

This shall do

[quote="lowGuido, post:15, topic:44459, full:true"]
higher voltage does NOT equal lower current. in most normal applications higher voltage actually equals higher current.
its ohms law V=I*R
so what no one ever mentions is R! you actually need to change the load in order to get lower currents from higher voltages.

so what you should be saying is: similar torque can be had from a higher voltage with lower current if you use a lower kV motor.

however with the same motor and un governed torque you will always draw more current with more voltage.

this ‚Äúhigher voltage = lower current‚Äù thing is missing half the equation and its pretty misleading to the noobs.

Yeah my electrical theory is weak at best.  I get how all the pieces relate in Ohms Law .  I just always go back to not needing as beafy of cables to achieve the same wattage when using higher voltage versus higher amperage.  Once all of that hits the ESC and flows to the motors it gets murky for me.

In the battery wires you‚Äôll have  to run more amps if running a lower voltage and want the same wattage. In the motor it‚Äôs all the same and just as hot and same amps needed. In the esc lower voltage is more eff but at full speed u have no switching losses so more efficient.  So u could run more voltage n be less efficient when at reduced throttle vs lower voltage and full throttle. But that‚Äôs a real exception

Ok that came out wrong, what I meant to say was not that you won't achieve the same wattage, but in order to be able to achieve the required wattage without significant voltage drop or creating too much heat and melting you insulation off of your cable you will need a beefier cable if you have high amps and low voltage versus high voltage and low amperage.

Yes true, higher volts, less amps for the same power. So for the same power you don't need as thick cables. Cable thickness is only related to amps, not power.

Think about it, 100V @ 1A = 100W, only need a thin cable. 1V @ 100A = 100W, but you need a very thick cable. In fact the cable needs to be 100^2/1 = 10000 times the area or more because of the lower surface area vs cross section.

So whats the point in arguing about 10s or 12s. The battery size doesnt affect the output of the esc and only increases its possible output.

This entire thread contains nothing but answers to your question. Ie the differences between 10 or 12s.

Once you go 12s, 10s will never satisfy you completely. 

10s is not bad but leaves you wanting more once you know what more feels like lol

I need some help. 

I'm doing some calculations to decide wether or not to go 12S4P or 10S5P on my next build. On every spec it seems 10S5P beats out 12S4P. The only spec that wins on 12S is max Wattage after taking into account voltage drop at nominal voltage, and motor and vesc amp limits.

10S otherwise wins regarding voltage sag, max amp output, total watt hours, and the limit becomes motors and vescs at high wattages. 36mph @ 10S, 43mph @12S. The differences are not huge, and I might want to go faster, and saving two cells worth of space with 12S might be beneficial... Just dunno. Thoughts?

You have it nailed to a T, the bump to 12s, without the addition of another P group wont possibly win against a similar 10s layout ON PAPER

Dont forget that the additional voltage means you can decrease your batt max, meaning potentially squeezing some extra KMs....

I would only say 10s and a larger p count if you were feeling dissatisfied with your last battery OR youre not running a Unity/Vesc 6/Vesc 6 derivative

Thanks for that idea, I checked what the load would be per cell to reach a certain wattage for each config... 10S still barely edges out. Hmm.

I'm guessing it's always just edging out in favor of 10S5P because of the two additional cells, and  the higher 12S voltage allows max Wattage to surpass the 10S due to efficiency of higher voltage in that specific case.

interesting! Iooks to be mostly preference


An MTB/pneumie build would benefit from the torque bump if they wanted to upgrade their battery and not the drive train... Seems like a pretty niche benefit :man_shrugging:

personally i would go for 12s and then gear my drivetrain accordingly.

The stats say go for 10. If you‚Äôd go 12s though you would also go 12s emphasis on go and your fun would stop a lot sooner. More P count would help then if that‚Äôs an option. 

When the speed and power is available you will definitely want to use it. 

I run 12s6p and I run it hard. I could go for a run and only be able to get 25km out of them. I should also be able to get 60km out of them but damn that would be a slow and steady ride doing 25kph I think and no hard take offs. 
I‚Äôll never try that.
