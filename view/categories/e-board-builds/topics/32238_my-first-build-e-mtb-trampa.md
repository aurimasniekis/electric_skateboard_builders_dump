Hello, i'm new in the world of electric skateboards.
I want to motorise my trampa mountainboard and have browsing this forum, youtube and several sites for a setup of my own to build.
**Can you tell me if this is a good setup for me?**
I weight about 84 kg and my board is about 7kg.
I live in Belgium, a flat country but i want to go offroad sometimes...
I have 14years experience on a skateboard and 10y on a snowboard, so am not a beginner on boards.
**Also i need a charger for the batteries below in my list, wich is one recommeded?**

Disclaimer: I am not an expert. These are just my suggestions:

Motor mount: Never heard of them before. Check out @Nowind , or @Idea for some quality options.
Motors seem good, although I think you could go a bit higher with KV.
Those VESCs will probably not be enough. Check out VESC 6 if you have a lot of money.
If you make a 10S battery with those, range will be short. Like 5km...
Remote looks ok, and XT90s are fine too.

Hope this helps...

@jbalint1122 Thanks for your possitive critisism :slight_smile:
I found this electrical setup from somebody on youtube.
I can change this setup because i didn't buy anything yet.
What do you suggest which is affordable like this setup?

E-mountainboards are not known for being affordable. @Idea has well priced motor mounts, and if you don't care about slightly worse startup and braking, you can go with something like an Fvt 12S sleeping lion ESC. It has more power than a regular vesc, but it is less customizable. It is the same price though. As for batteries, you don't have to go 10S if you want to same some money. Just buy two giant 4S packs. Like 10000mh.

Yeah i've Just found out about the motormounts of Idea. His set is less expensive then the parts that i found. Definitely going to buy those. 

About the batteries: found these on hobbyking. Please take a look and tell me if they're good or not.

you can try, but the general agreement is that lipos with a <20c ratting will sag and are not good for our purpose. Maybe with a huge 15c pack and small motors you might not notice...

do you plan on running 8s or 12s?

this is my setup
http://esk8builds.com/photo/view/?id=1

- my batteries are 35c and i didn't feel any sag...

- i use the same motors and i'm happy with them

- i'm using VESC but I mainly go for asphalt

i didn't recommend you the scramboards motor mount (i have it), i recommend you the motor mount by @Idea it's better

@Cobber, i'm still researching what would be a good setup.
Didn't plan anything yet.
The links i posted on all the parts are for me to calculate the total price of the build.

@tueboard, yesterday i found the thread of Idea's motormounts and i'm loving those! They are cheaper and look more robust then the scramboards. Definitely going to change my plans untill i'm sure enough to finally start buying.
First up is the motormount from Idea.

Out of interest, did you consider buying the whole (minus battery etc) kit from Trampa? Something like this?

@cobber yes, thanks for the feedback
@munkyheed i allready have a trampa board. i don't find a kit from trampa without a board. i want to build my own setup instead of a bolt-on kit

@Stefanj about programming card for MAX6. I think it's [this card](https://www.hobbywingdirect.com/products/led-pc2c?variant=172030922)
But i am sure there are many alternatives.

About your battery and charging system.
I see you going for 4x4S batteries. Probably, 2x in series, and 2x parallel, so you will get 8S, 12Ah.
It's nice, but you have two/three options regarding charging it.

**1 option - Pain in the ass** :smile: 
you have your 4x batteries, you have to open the box each time, and charge every battery with 4S charger separately. One after another. It takes time, and you have to disconnect parallel and series wires each time.
you have to buy charger with integrated power supply, but 4S balance charger is rather cheap.

**2 option - less pain in the ass, but stil**l :smile:
you have your 4x batteries.
you have to open each time box to charge it.
you connected, all the balance wires into one plug (there are some threads regarding how to do that), so you have to connect one plug to the balance charger, and all power wires to one plug, same it goes to the charger.
you got one big 8S battery, and you probably need 8S, charger. **It's not that cheap**, and usually needs power supply (the charger is only charger, and that charger needs DC power supply to work)

**3 option - best, but needs BMS - battery managment system.**
you connect all the balance wires to the bms, Power wires also
( this setup is the best with the 2x batteries. If you go with 8S i suggest to use 2[x 16 Ah 10C Turnigy Multistar Battery](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/multistar-high-capacity-4s-16000mah-multi-rotor-lipo-pack.html))
i don't know about voltage sag with max6 esc, but i have those two batteries in my Trampa twin motor setup with VESC contollers, and i have no voltage sag.
I have 6364 motor's, and i am heavy as hell, and all working fine.

Anyway, you have your batteries, connected to the BMS.
Pluses:
BMS protects the ESC from too much current in case something go wrong, or motor short.
You dont have spark, when you connect esc to battery
You have charging port on the battery case, so you dont have to open the box all the time.
You just connect XLR plug to the port on your box, and wait for the battery to auto charge.
It's the easy mode system, most commercial boards use these
BMS prottects and balance each cell, from overcharge, or too much discharge.

I think 120 A BMS is enough for the ESC, but i am not sure, since i use 2x VESC

[BMS -  an example from Aliexpress](https://pl.aliexpress.com/item/12S-120A-version-S-lipo-lithium-Polymer-BMS-PCM-PCB-battery-protection-board-for-12-Packs/32796917556.html?spm=a2g17.search0104.3.25.PLgIqz&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_5_10152_10065_10151_10068_10304_10307_10301_10137_10060_10155_10154_10056_10055_10054_5470020_10059_100031_10099_5460020_10338_10103_10102_440_10052_10053_10142_10107_10050_10051_5380020_10171_10326_10084_10083_10080_10082_10081_10110_10111_10112_10113_10114_143_10312_10313_10314_10078_10079_10073,searchweb201603_2,ppcSwitch_5&btsid=32c5aaa5-be17-4151-b27a-039d00ecb478&algo_expid=359bb9fb-c6e2-41b9-99f7-8cf9566248ee-3&algo_pvid=359bb9fb-c6e2-41b9-99f7-8cf9566248ee)

[Charger](http://www.batterysupports.com/lion-lipo-ebike-charger-c-46_50.html) - i can't access the site from where i am, so not sure if the link is correct, anyway you need 8S 33,6 V BMS charger, 4-5 Amps.

You can look at [my build thread](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/first-build-twin-sk3-6354-260-kv-trampa-urban-carver/25856/12), to see how i did my trampa boards, with BMS/LiPo batteries.

I want to add, that although i am heavy(120 kg), and i use pneumatics, My board have a range of about 18-20 km, with this 16 Ah, 378 Wh battery.

Ofc, that's my opinion. Some will say, that if you go BMS, it's best to use Li-Ion 16850 cells, like LG HG2, but that's more expensive.

I suggest to get some information's on this forum, mainy about batteries, cos rest is fairly easy :smile:

Good luck!

Hey Tomash,
A big thanks for the big help!
Currently i'm gathering all the components for my first build. I'm sure i can find all the answers to my questions on this forum. 

I think that bms is worth putting on my to-buy list as it would be easier to charge the batteries.

Thanks a lot!

Hey @Tomash i've been thinking about your recommendation of the 2x Multistar High Capacity 16000mAh 4S 10C. I want to use these instead of my earlier Idea of using 4xZIPPY Compact 6200mAh 4s 40c. But the first question that pops into my mind is: 10c x 16ah = 160amp if u put these on max6 160a. Isn't this a little too close of frying the ESC's or is this still safe?
```

---
## \#25 Posted by: Tomash Posted at: 2017-09-11T00:26:35.434Z Reads: 217

```
Nope it's not too close, because not matter what max Amp, battery can output, esc or vesc, won't take more than it needs.
If the esc is rated for 160 Amp, it usually means, that it can output that much current as it's maximum value, or continues current for a very short amount of time. But it' probably never do that, since motors are rated lower.
Usually esc or vesc, take maybe 5-6 amps continues, and when it's needed, usually at start or when go uphill, it take more, i don't really know, but probably no more than 30 amps for vesc, and maybe more when you use esc. i don't really know how much in case of ESC, cos i didnt ever used one.
Anyway, then is when BMS comes in handy.
If you have your discharge gated by bms (your power to the esc goes though BMS), the BMS limit your battery to it's rating. Than mean if you have 120 A discharge rated BMS, it mean, it wont allow more current to flow to the esc, and can prevent the frying of esc or motor in case esc brake, or motor short's out for whatever reasons.

Probably best to do as Nowind suggests with the batteries. He probably has more experience with these things than anyone else on the forums. Most likely to end up with a gutless little vagina board with that low of a c rating.

I have a trampa with 2 ezrun 6 aswell.
Powered with 4x 4s 6200mah 40C Zippy Compact. This guys deliver the power without much sag. 
Don´t cheap out on poor low C Lipos - take the big guys and you won´t have any problems when you encouter your first pothole in the woods ;)
If you only run on streets without hills, you might be ok with some multistars, but trust me, the zippys are an other league ;)

Ok, Just watched the video(@work, lol) and think i understand his method of charging. But how does this work with 4x zippycompact
(2 in series, 2 pairs in parallel)?
How does the balance cables need to be connected? Can somebody draw a diagram of this?
This is the drawning i made this morning of the batteries...

Perhaps I misunderstood the question (jst kinda buzzed through the comments), but I use this for charging multiple 3s packs at the same time. Works well.

I think you misunderstood me, i'm not going to use the jst for main power. I will use it the first several times to charge the batteries outside the board untill i make the "in-board charging system"...

If that charging board is the right one, what charger do you propose to use for charging the 4 batteries (zippycompact 6200mah 4s) at once?

We have a nice carbon box in the make. Available soon. Balancer leads out, 3x XT90 outs, simple, nice efficient. Have a look at the Graupner Ultramat 18. Cheap, 12S capable, 90W power supply built in, port for 500W external power supply. Best charger if your pocket isn't thick. I use an old server power supply to speed up charging.

I get your point of using a heavy charger but why do i need a 12s charger? I'm making 8s2p from those 4 batteries, right?

It would be Nice to charge the pack when it's still in the board, i get that. But since my skills about this are limited i need to learn a lot. I'm starting with  simple removable packs and charge them out of the board. Later on when I tested the board and when i'm more sure of my capabilities. i will probably build in a bms or some sort of jst cable like @lowGuido.

@Nemesis thanks for following this thread, i Will keep the posts coming as i'm researching and start building. Maybe need to start a seperate build-topic with decent title?!?
Post a link to your build-topic if you can, i'm curious!
The batterypacks look nice! Mount em without an extra case, that would be bad-ass...

Charging through the balancer leads takes ages. You can only charge slowly, since the cables are to thin. 
Two 6S charger cost as much as a cheap 12s charger. I would go straight for the real deal.

You can use one of these for charging: http://www.progressiverc.com/parallel-6x-xt90-charge-cable.html 

And one of these for balancing: http://www.progressiverc.com/parallel-6x-balance-adapter.html 

You'll have to disconnect your series connectors first, but at least you can leave the batteries on the board while you charge. This is what I've been doing with my 8s build (not sure if it's the safest way to monitor voltage though). Just have the balance adapter hooked to a cheap cell meter. Most of the time I'll charge all 5 batteries through one channel, unless I'm in a hurry then I'll split two packs off to the other side.

No it all just stays on the board lol. Would definitely like to come up with a cleaner looking way of monitoring cell voltage. Figured it was that, or have a separate cellmeter for each pack. 

With it hooked up like this though, if I have one cell drop below the rest, I question whether the meter will really pick up on it. I'd hoped that the meter would scan all the packs for the lowest cells, but I'm assuming that's not actually what's happening.

Seems to work fine for balancing multiple packs through the charger, so I'd hoped it would be the same case for monitoring them.

@benjammin please tell me why you want to monitor your cells with one cell meter? Doesn't your balance charger monitors each cell?
If you are charging more batteries in parallel aren't the cells balancing each other out? They become one big cell for the balance charger, right?

Yeah no worries man, shit's confusing. You need a cellmeter for when you're riding to know where your voltage is at. Like I said above, I'm still not sure what the best solution is for monitoring multiple packs at the same time while riding.

Perhaps someone else will chime in with a better understanding of this.

Is that problem occuring that often that you need to monitor it while riding?
Always tought that the cells discharge pretty evenly when in use...

But anyways, that post you made with your pictures, you proposed to buy those 2 parallel cables(xt90 and jst). Isn't the paraboard doing the same without being that flexible? I understand why that would be easier in use but i think i don't mind getting the packs out of the board for charging...for now 😋

Yeah that board will do the same thing. Just makes it so you don't have to pull the packs off to charge.

Charging through the balancer leads takes ages.
[/quote]

Thats not really true. It depends on your definition of ages I guess. Balance leads are usually 22AWG Which is good for 7A and thats more than most chargers can output anyway. All my chargers are 5A max and i think the biggest battery I have takes 4 hours to charge.  Which I think is reasonable. Total cost of two B6 chargers $20 and a 10A fast charger for 12S is like over $200. I know what I'd do.

paraboard will make charge time longer than two B6's
paraboard requires that you remove the batteries from the series configuration to charge, or else smoke.

using 2 batteries in series you can keep them connected up and just charge via two B6 chargers you can make your enclosure such that you can still access the balance leads and charge the board in half the time without having to open or disconnect anything.

I haven't used either but i was looking at the same two Imax B6a variants as you, i would go for 2x Imax B6A+ "the black ones" but would look for a supplier thats is local-ish to your location and reputable, in case of  returns as there are many clones of both chargers some work fine some don't and some are dangerous.

I think Hobbyking sells genuine ones but their returns/customer service is known for being poor.

Edit..... or keep an eye out on this site for secondhand bargains, like this 8s charger with power supply http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/open-box-parts-vesc-motor-motor-mount-gt2b-wheel-puellys-8s-balence-charger/32562

You can charge those packs at 1-2c,thus 5a is a bit low, but if you have the time to wait. The ISDT chargers over at banggood deliver a bit more if it's within your budget.

That's maybe a good upgrade. But can i supply power with this for both chargers? Cause that would be nice since i want a small "set" for charging  my batteries.

Linked to the wrong product, sorry. That's the power supply that would go along with the charger (isdt charger).

The charger itself delivers 15a, thus you would have one power supply (link above), one charger and most likely a balancer board to charge both Lipos at once.

My way is a cheap 8s BMS for charging only.
Having 4x 4s Zippy Compacts, putting 2 in parallel and the two packs in serial.
I post some pictures when i find some time soldering that together.

@telnoi thanks for the clarification, now i understand!
@TarzanHBK I am considering a bms after I finish this build. First i want to keep it basic but rolling. Then i Will see what i'm missing. 

I was trying to order two Zippy Flightmax 8400mah 4s2p. Which are in the uk Warehouse. Apparently they can't ship from there to belgium! Does somebody know why? Does anybody know other webshops where i can find these batteries?

Had the same problem- i´d liked to get my hands on the nanotech 8s from UK and they responded, that they are only able to ship these to UK. All other countries have to get them from International Warehouse or EU, if you are from EU.
I ended up with the 4 4s 40c Zippy Compacts, which are really the best thing to put on the board after the nanotechs. So i would strongly advise to buy these!
BMS for charging only is the cheapest option to charge the batteries after the option with two imax b6.

Hey guys,
It's been a while since i posted something about my build. So here I am. This morning my max6 ESC's arrived! They were at the customs for too long!
Every time something new arrived I need to check it out. And as always some questions about the part rises up. 
I saw that the leads from the battery to the esc has some kind of series connection and i was wondering if i can chop it off and put 1 Xt90 there.
Also how do i connect the receiver to the ESC's ?Since there are 2 receiver cables and only 1 receiver...

Hey, have not seen that cable connection before on the MAX6, mine came with two cables and no connectors.  Chop it off and put what you want, I soldered both my ESCs together, so only one XT90 plug for both.

As far as the receiver cables, use a good quality y lead like the photo and take out one of the positive connectors out of the servo plug, so only 1 esc powers your receiver.  Tape the other for future use.  Hope that is clear.

Yes, it's clear as day!
So use only 1 possible lead for receiver. 
Only 1 question, what color is the positieve lead for the receiver? I want to solder the cables for the receiver together instead of using that y-cable...
I Will

Yes, i'm planning to replace the plug with xt90. But somewhere i Read that one antispark plug was enough for that kind of safety measurements. I'm planning to make a loop key using one antispark Xt90 plug. That seems enough, @anyone, correct me if i'm wrong....

Yeah i also think its not necessary but....
i think im going to do it anyway as the extra cost isn't that great, but i'm not sure if there is/are any negative reasons as to why its not common on builds... :thinking:

The main reason is if i'm truthful, i have a feeling if something goes wrong while i'm riding, i may pull the wrong end of the "Bat to esc power cable" out in a panic mode,  so would like to protect both disconnects.

kinda planning for my stupidity and if others/friends have a ride..

Hey guys,
I'm almost finished my build!
I still need to do the wiring in de batterybox.
But i need to make the wiring really compact to make it fit with the batteries in the box.
So the 4 batteries need to be connected in series and in paralell.
I was wondering if the order of serial and parallel made a difference. 
Does it matter that i connect the batteries first in parallel and then serial cause this Will save me some space. I Will try to find a drawning of the way of wiring to clear it out...

I found it online and used it because i looked correct in the first view.
@lowGuido helped me with it and he said it was shorted out. He gave me a corrected version of it.

Yesterday i made my small wiring loom for it.
Made the last connection and tested my board for the first time! After a quick test i saw that one of the wheels was turning in the wrong direction. I swapped the motorwires and it was fixed. Then tried it in my indoor skatepark.
It was a blast! Didn't test the range or topspeed because it was raining and the free space in my skatepark is limited...
