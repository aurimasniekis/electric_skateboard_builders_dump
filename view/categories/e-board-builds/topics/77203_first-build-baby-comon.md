Hello there. 

I had my rather nice mountain bike stolen from me at my house a few months ago. However as luck would have it my renters insurance(Renters insurance is wicked cheap, I recommend it) covered my losses and better yet kicked off my funding of my first mountain board. 
I haven't touch a skate board since 2004 but the second I saw on of these bad muthafuckas I had to build one.  I have named this board the kamikazi(It's not spelled the right way I know) because I'm fairly sure the second I touch the remote I will fly into traffic.
 This site has been a god sent for research and resources. I appreciate the help and quick responses from the people here. 
Being my first build I went with the basics for a mountain board. Don't have the tools to fabricate any of the parts myself so everything I've picked up can be found on here or a few clicks away from here.

There is a sliding cost for shipping. I'm in the USA and this is what it took to get this. I'm also under the impression I have a lot of redundancies in this system. When completed I will have 2 power buttons and 1 key.

Why would you have to power buttons and one key you can have one loop key and your done

The xt90 could be connecting battery to vesc. And the bms or anti spark could not have cone with a button.

I would as min skip the antispark.
Just have seen so much of them burning up in last time. Made me a bit scary to use one...
And you have a top mount box.
The xt90s loop key would be more than enough,
You could even bridge the switch on the bms.
More switches means more things that can fail while operation.

I agree that more switches in the line mean more opportunity for failure. For me that's the point. I'd rather a $55 switch burn up on me than $260's worth of escs.

The loopkey does everything your 56$ switch does do too. 
Just to look from the electrical side.
The only advantage is the optic and maybe more convenient to switch on/off.
Your eswitch will not save anything more than an xt90s. Ok, maybe if you have a build in fuse in the e switch, but this fuse function you have in your bms too.

so between that 12s lipo bms and tx90 anti spark switch I don't need the 100a switch?

if you use that xt90s as loop key, than no.
even if no, the e-switch in your bms does the same thing as the 55$ swicht does too.
