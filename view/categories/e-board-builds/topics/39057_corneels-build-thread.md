Probably too high kv, torque will suffer, might be hard to start riding. Not saying wont work, but people tend to use below 300kv for.motor

Check esk8 calc, u should.aim for speed u desire to get. http://calc.esk8.it

What gearing / wheels u planning to use?

Way too high kv unless you go with 100:1 ratio
