Also, I'm looking at some reasonable sized hills in my area, I want to go a nice speed but definitely need torque to go up those hills. What do you think about the one I chose?
Looking forward to hearing from you guys. Thanks!

Looks good, if you want a bit better motor look at the DIY 6374 190kv. Also I would recommend a mini remote instead of that nano remote. I also recommend using all one type of connector so you don't have to get confused with different types, good luck!

What connectors would you recommend? I'm thinking of just going with the xt90s, and why not the nano remote? I like the fact that it is smaller, are their known problems with it?

Just updated the motor, what do you think about that one? I'm looking for decent speed but more to go up hills, and will this work well with the batteries I selected? Should I run the batteries in series or parallel, from what I've taken so far it seems people are running them in series but wouldn't that give you a higher mah with the same voltage? Do you think gonna need more voltage capabilities for my set up? Especially to go up those darn hills! lol Do you guys think the mount will work with the Gullwings? I know lots of questions!

As for the speed, I would add another 3s battery in there in series to increase the voltage and give you some more headroom on that side.  That motor should be pretty good on torque otherwise

Im running 2x3s in series like you plan, so 6s. And my motor is 260kv and gearing 1:3..... So with lower kv numbers, you need more voltage.

got it, what about with the sk3 245kv recommended by IsTalo, would that work well with the two batteries and power me up a hill with a pretty decent incline?

## \#11 Posted by: IsTalo Posted at: 2017-07-03T19:11:14.155Z Reads: 154

```
Of course I can, I'm here to help you. A 190kv is a good motor, but 190*42v gives you a lot of Rpm. But 190*24v give you the half of that Rpm, so half of the speed to your build. A 260 kv motor is made for a 6s battery, It will have enough torque and speed with the right gearing. That is why a 190kv will not be that good for you

Use the @, then I can see the post. A 245 kv motor will be enough to go to 15 to 20% grade hills, but there are some other variables, like, if you use a 90mm wheel? It will give you more speed and less torque.

[/quote]

Wait, are you sure of all that pieces? One mistake that I did was buying everything without research and now I have a lot of problems

I recommend you buying a Li-ion pack, It is more expensive, but when a Lipo have 300 cicles, a Li-ion have 1000. Also the Pack that is on the link come with a Bms, Battery indicator and a Power switch. If you have a bit more dollars I really recommend this, because I bought Lipos that are swollen now. 

http://www.chiboards.com/shop/6s4p-samsung-25r-pack

The guy also make cheaper packs, 6s3p is 300 dolars I think, send him a private massage @barajabali

or buy at Diy, seens to be a good pack and you have the same shipping

Right now my build is going to cost about $425, those battery packs are way above my budget, but they are a great option if I had the cash to spend. I am mostly sure of the parts, I did a reasonable amount of research but the reason I posted here was to confirm with you guys if they are all compatible and will work.

Yeah, just take care of that Lipos, seriously, Your build is good

**You just missed a important part of the longboard, the wheels**, also that motor mount will not work with sidewinter trucks, they are made for Calibers trucks

Stay away from the nano remote if possible. Get a GT2B and a 3d printed enclosure for it.

Its the same kv as the motor listed... However, a Sk3 213kv or a 245kv would work well with a 6s setup.

It has been known to be unreliable and have dropouts, however the mini remote is about the same size if you remove the wheel and it is rock solid. I would use regular XT90 or XT60 connectors for everything because you can't accidentally short your batteries by plugging them into each other as you can with bullet connectors. I would only use the XT90-S for an anti-spark loop key.

**WARNING**
The IMAX charger you linked to on Amazon is a FAKE! Be careful they are inferior Chinese clones.

I had one, slowly the balance ports started to break and now it's bricked and I can't use it.

An IMAX B6 should be around £40-50 and the B6 writing should be 'gold' and in italic. Also, it should have a genuine shiny sticker on the back that has a code on it (that you scratch off) that you can verify with SkyRC's website to check if it's genuine. Also the bullet connectors on the side of the unit should be gold and not silver.

Could you send an amazon link possibly for the correct Imax charger? I figured it might be a knock off, thanks a bunch for pointing that out. I forgot to post wheels, I have a complete (non electric) board already. I REALLY want to use my gull wing sidewinder 2 trucks, does anyone know of a motor mount that will work? Or maybe I can alter the diy motor mount. I do have gearing and a pulley, it's included in the motor mount kit.

Yes, that's a genuine one. If You look at this photo, you can see the bullet connectors are gold. Also it's about the right price.

The only thing they're not showing is the bottom where the sticker would be.

Or maybe I could even just use the top section of the caliber trucks with the second pivot point, do you think the caliber top portioom would fit to replace the top portion of the sidewinder 2s?

The Lipo Y series connector  you listed has deans style plugs, you want one with XT90's or plugs that match the batteries at minimum. Otherwise you have to remove the plugs and put something else on, at that point your pretty much making it from scratch.

Any recommendations? Wouldn't you have to solder regardless in order to put them in series? Or should i be putting them in parralel? The videos I watched showed them being wired in series but wouldn't 11.1v be way less than ideal? I have these listed... isnt this the corrrect XT90?

@Irdesigns, awesome, I have everything shipping right now. Hobbyking has already shipped. I should have everything in about a week. Luckily I was able to use my $200 Amazon credit to buy all kinds of connectors, trucks, wheels, HK-GT2B remote controller, a UBEC and a voltage meter/low voltage alarm. I am wondering how important it is to have a UBEC installed. Also, I don't have a power switch... I know what a goof. What should I do about this? I heard DIY's power switch is easily fried, have you heard anything about that? I'm getting the GT2B, I'm probably gonna end up using it as is for a while, a bit clunky but I don't have access to a 3D printer ATM. 

...Thanks everyone for your help, how fortunate it is to have a forum like this around. :) It feels good to know that anyone with the desire to build an electric board has access to this generous community of individuals who enjoy making that happen. I probably would have ended up going with some awful china prebuilt kit if I didn't have such easy access to so much information and advice from you kind empathetic veteran board builders.  :cry:
