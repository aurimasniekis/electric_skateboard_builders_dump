Still testing out the final parts but I will update as I go. STL files are on thingverse here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3419647

Enjoy and let me know if you have questions. I can print these for you as well, shoot me a message if you're interested.

Good so far but I have been waiting a few months for a new Focbox Unity and Enertion has stopped responding and wont refund my money so it's just sitting at the moment.

Nice job.  They look pretty good.  Maybe post some pics of the final product.  
Also - After messing around with many filaments - You might use PETG as apposed to ABS or PLA.  Its stronger than both, and fairly easy and forgiving to print.  

Another option for strength is pause-printing  carbon fiber inserts.  I don't have a link at the moment, but... In your model make a void for a tube (square void).  Then when the print is at the top of the void, pause the print, insert [carbon fiber rod](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20190704041255&SearchText=carbon+fiber+rod).

Just an idea.  It looks great!  Post some pics, let us know how it works out :slight_smile:
