Really love the ride the vanguard gives.
Heartbreak when I had all those drama's with vescs and motors but with some help from the community I was able the get the vesc's fixed and found the short inside one of the R-Specs.
So - here it is - revamped !

Ronin on the front - still using a caliber on the back - don't have mounts to suit the whitepony okp method
Bought one of @Eboosted 's awesome battery cases and crammed a 10s4P sanyo GA pack in there @14aH
 The vesc case is not from Alan, the quality of his enclosures are mint, that's a 3D print with texture paint.
I should have bought the vesc case from Alan!
The worst thing about the enertion nano remote is that when it binds - its really good !
Fking thing won't bind through the PLA enclosure,
Wonder if I used lead paint :thinking:
Anyway I've soldered the ppm cable to it and it's poking out in front of the vesc enclosure.
Will get another GT2B`
some build pics

Epoxied the cables in place - 10awg - then hidden

Batttery, BMS and anti spark switch - damn thing failed. dropped some solder on it while soldering the charge port, flash, dead.
Replaced the fets and it breathed again - once.
Using a loop switch for now. :angry:

Top speed I have reached is 45km/hr. Has more left but it gets a bit floaty with the flex 2. Have put on weight since I started riding these things.

Sweet board @Jebe!

Love the vanguard graphics you've done under the grip tape ;)

How'd you do that?
