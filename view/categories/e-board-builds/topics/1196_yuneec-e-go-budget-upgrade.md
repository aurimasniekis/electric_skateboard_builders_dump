Hey Guys,

So after shooting some video of my DIY build with the Yuneec E-GO, it became very apparent that I could barely keep up and get exciting high speed shots because of the 13mph top speed. I'm looking for a quick & dirty ie: CHEAP way to boost the performance as I'll probably only use the E-GO for occasional filming and not for daily transportation. I'm okay with the risk of ruining a perfectly fine entry level board.

P.S. I know this has been mentioned in the ES forums but just wondering what tips the fine people of ESK8 may have.

id probably chuck a VESC in it and keep the existing battery/ motor and see how it goes. 
if you need more power then you can upgrade the battery.

Hey RPB, saw you thread and just had to pipe in.
I also have an yuneec ego that was my first E-board. It was pretty exciting at first buy now its just not fast enough for me.
I also contemplated trying to upgrade the Ego.
Unfortunatly, the battery is only a 22 or 24 volt system with built in BMS. And the motor is only a 400 watt censored motor. 
The main concern here is amperage draw. If you want more speed, you'll need a higher wattage motor. 
Seems like an easy upgrade but its not that simple because the battery's  management system and the proprietary electronics are designed to handle the amperage draw of a 400 watt motor. So if you slap a 1200 watt motor on there, you will likely cook the BMS or the speed controller or both. 
The yuneec ego is a good commuter board because of its range and dependability.
If your wanting more of  a recreational board, I suggest that you sell the ego and buy the parts to build your own.
I have built my own with dual hub motors and a 12s lipo battery setup that delivers insane torque, acceleration and top speed!
You can build a single hub motor  e-board with 6s lipo that will go 25mph
check it out at carvonskates.com

@lowGuido yup I did think about a VESC but since I'll be using it as a "beater board" I'll probably lean towards a battery upgrade

@Namasaki totally with you! [Just built a single Carvon hub and lovin it][1]. Working on a dual hub next. I guess what I'm saying is I'd like to convert the E-GO into a "beater board", something that I will ride holding my camera gear in order to film my "prettier" DIY boards. From what I recall on ES, there were some folks who were slapping on 8S and 10S Lipo's and getting some performance juice out of it, riding hard without blowing anything. But you make an excellent point. It's a perfectly fine commuter board that will hold it's value if I don't tear it apart.

I just found your video of your single hub build like 10 mins after posting my replay. Didn't realize you'd been there done that. Really nice build! 
I wish I had found out about Diy and Carvonskates before buying the Ego. Now I'm just trying to sell it for a lillte more than half of what I paid.

For what it's worth, the EGO is a small investment (comparatively to the Boosted) for a taste of what an electric is like. I actually have a few friends who are perfectly content with their stock EGO which is cool, to each his own. I'm not quite sure I would have had the same urge or commitment to pursue a DIY build without putting a bunch of miles on the EGO and tangibly comprehending that I wanted more out of an electric that wasn't just based on speed but also something that was tailor made for my physical specs and creative tastes.

Hobbyking.com has the zippy 8k 30c 5s packs for 77.96 and if you sit on the webpage looking at it for a little while, they will pop up a message offering you a discount! I just tried it and after looking at the page for 2 min they popped up an offer for 73.76 each. 
There shipping costs are very reasonable. I recently ordered 2 Zippy compact 6s 5k 25c packs and they came fairly quick.

Well, if you only going to change the battery, then you can always put it back the way it was later. Just save the old battery connector.
One thing though, I would recommend  spending a little more and getting a dual bank charger so you can charge both packs at the same time. especially with those high capacity packs.
I use this one and it works great!

Also I just noticed that the SkyRc charger is only 6 amp.
You'll need at least 8 amp for a 1c charge rate and those batteries have a max charge rate of 5c

That's a powerful charger but the reason for the price is that it is DC only input. 
So you would need an external 12v power supply that would cost more than the charger.

Thanks for the help @Namasaki @DeathCookies I decided to get some EC3 connectors and test if my Space Cell could work on the E-GO. I'm not quite sure if anyone has tried that yet. Maybe @onloop has some insight. If it does perform better I may just pick up a 3rd Space Cell. Will keep you guys posted on it.

There was a thread on Endless Sphere a few months ago where folks were using 8s and 10s Lipo's and getting 20mph out of the EGO but it seems to have died down. My plan now is to keep the EGO's stock motor and ESC housing and add on a Space Cell using an EC3 connector.

Hey RPB,
I can't wait to here the results!
I'm gonna go check out the thread on endless sphere. 
One thing you should know, which I found out when I was tinkering with mine is that the stock battery is set up a little different than the space cell. 
Where the on/off switch turns the electronics on, not the battery.  The battery leads are always hot. 
So either lipos or space cell, you'll need a switch to turn the electronics on. I don't know if you've ever dismantled yours but there are 2 high current wires and 2 low current wires coming from the battery box. 
I'm assuming that the small wires go from the switch to the control module. 
Good luck.

From what I remember from the thread, those two small wires are temp sensors and had no effect on the Lipos with stock ESC. The Space Cell has a contained BMS, power button and fuse so should be ok to connect direct to the ESC leads unless I'm missing something.

Yes,
Upgrade to 10s and Vesc. 
And while we're at it, might as well upgrade the 400watt motor. 
This is why I suggested selling it and building another Diy.  Trying to supe up an ego seems like false economy. 
Ive decided to just sell mine. I posted it on Craigslist for $450 and I have a potential buyer coming tomorrow.

@lowGuido @Namasaki great points, just want to emphasize that this is to create a beater build just used for filming, not to supe it up with false expectations. This is also based on one documented case of someone blowing their ESC from 10s and one who seems to have put theirs through the ringer and is still going. But who knows as that thread appears to have died. If I manage to get better footage filming with an EGO 10s, taking care not to overuse it, that's worth it to me. If I blow the ESC and end up replacing it with a VESC, still worth those moments of filming than building a completely new build from scratch that I will only be using to follow my two other builds. If I had the disposable income to make a board from scratch purely as a follow vehicle right now I would, but for now experimenting on the EGO for research is doable for me at this moment

I totally see your point of view and I am very interested in the outcome. I agree that it's worth trying with the stock electronics. About the guy who fried his, 
I'm thinking, it lasted a month before dying so he probably got over confident and started driving it hard uphill and just overheated it.

I ended up frying my ESC with a 10s7p Li(NCM) pack.

I would suggest something closer to 8s to start, but I was at 27 mph and climbing crazy hills for a 1x 400watt motor setup.

I had a wattmeter inline, voltage only dropped from 37.7 to 36.1 during the 1 mile trip (30minutes) and only a few watts got eaten up hill. It was cold out (Boston, MA) so I can't say if anything heated up, but I'm waiting on my Yuneec rep to get back to me about parts.

I think the stock battery is already 8s. 
Maybe the voltage didnt fry the esc. 
Just overheated it with the heavy load going uphill

Still hasn't come back to life.

For reference:
19 years old, 129lbs, 5'7-11" (I broke my back over a year ago, so my height changes a lot).
Largest hill scaled: Packard Ave (from Powder House Road to Capen Street NE) [42.407084, -71.121659]
Weather: -6 degrees centigrade with -10 degree centigrade windchill. Boston can be cold and unforgiving. Nothing was hot or smoking when I stopped. No melting motor enamel, so its the ESC.

I only realized I lost power as I was going downhill and regen braking died. I slid around an uphill corner before I exceeded 34mph and managed to get off without losing face.  The old modding/teardown post we're referencing discussed the contemporary E-Go mosfets as F3205zs which should have been able to handle the voltage safely. They clearly changed hardware (because 6 mosfets are now in the battery where the power switch now resides) leaving a couple behind in the ESC compartment. I'm not going to open mine up now, but if it gets repaired I certainly will. The original ESC featured amp limiting (15 Amp max draw) with a 130kv (ish) Delta Wye motor (30-50 amps safe).  Every motor I have received from Yuneec sounds different - which leads me to believe that they're trying something different each batch.

I'll do some modding on my spare motor and VESC since I'm down a board until Yuneec CS geta back to me.

I just ordered the cable in question:
http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/9-pin-waterproof-connector-for-motor_1631444931.html?spm=a2700.7724838.0.0.jcNz90

The 3 phase wires pins are 14 AWG single core, so max VESC current would be 24Amps, but I don't know the actual wire gauge within the cable. I'll stop at 15 amps and later at 20 amps.  The remaining 6 pins connect to 5 visible wires in my spare motor (BL, RD, GR, YL, BL) which should be sensor wires (GND, 5V, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3) excluding the white thermal wire as per Jacobbloy's notes. 

VESC to Yuneec Motor should be a simple change - If I get it working, I'll post a sensor pinout for the 9-Pin.

EDIT:  Just chatted with Jacobbloy, VESC can identify the pinout for me. When the wire arrives I'll give it a test and come up with basic VESC config.

It works.

I'm waiting on better JST connectors so I can finalize the mod, but its solid.  The wires are factory color coded (pin out is super easy because the VESC can auto detect the phases).  Building housing for it under my deck is a priority.

Max amps are set at 15 and things are running pretty cool.  I'm reusing the Yuneec battery (built in BMS with Switch).  I can post some pictures when I put my JST connectors on and make it look nice.

**Notes:**

* Running on FOC (sensorless works, but the Hall Sensors won't detect properly) and feel like a silent ninja.
* Wire crimping for Hall Bus was annoying (added a dab of solder and things were OK)
* Housing complete. Waterproof + Wattmeter. Watt meter sticks out, but the VESC has the same profile as the original ESC.

**Steps:**

1. Order the 9 Pin waterproof connector cable.
1. There are three large colored wires - solder them in any order to the motor pads on the VESC.
1. Connect the smaller wires to the HALL bus for sensored operations

## VESC Settings
**_Still Being Tweaked_**

* Motor Max/Min: 60/-20
* Batt Max/Min: 20/-60
* Absolute Max: 130
* Battery Cut off Start/End: 25.6/24.0 (My battery is full at 29V and is "empty" at ....V)
* Detect your motor and run it in FOC if you can't get your Hall sensors to work.

@kaiser The ESC latches into the battery. Unscrew both and just lift out the ESC.

 @RunPlayBack The performance with my settings has been good - I drive around DC (up and down hills for about 26 miles over 9 hours with 2x 15 minutes wall plugs around 25V). FOC is slower than BLDC it seems, but BLDC is unreliable with this motor without working Hall (Idk why, but its something to investigate).  Until I know more about the battery's BMS max output, I am capping the VESC draw at 25 Amps - I'm going up to 30Amps tomorrow.

30 amps from the battery has been fine more or less - no damage or heating up thus far. The phase wires are a tad thinner than many so I would suspect that you'll want better wires - so with the original Yuneec Motor/Cable you'll want to be careful. 

That is the correct cable. With JST clips you can try to connect the motor to the HALL bus, but it's tricky.

Don't mix the cells and I'm not sure the Yuneec BMS is flexible enough to be used with alternate battery cells. Have you built a battery pack before (I can give you some pointers)?

Hi,
i have two yuneec boards but one has connection issues. Could i combine them to make a diagonal drive driven by the same battery? I figure that with the ESCs limited to 15 amp each I would not pull more than 30 from the battery. It would be a heavy board but may handle the 12 degree incline in my neighborhood more easily. No idea about top speed, but more than 11mph... Any thoughts?

@KMeyerson I'm thinking about doing this myself, but I did have a couple clarifying questions--

Was the top speed changed at all with the VESC or is that still limited by the E-Go's battery voltage?

The 26 miles you mentioned I imagine has to be with charging (you say "2x 15 minutes wall plugs around 25v"). Did you really only charge for ~30 minutes to go the 26 miles or am I completely reading that wrong? Even though the E-Go battery is pretty big, that still seems like a lot of distance w/o at least one complete charge...

Also, regarding braking with FOC-- is it noticeably different than the power of the stock E-Go brakes? I was doing some reading and it seemed like w/o the Hall sensor working, only the regenerative braking works.

And one last one-- the BMS is connected to the E-Go battery, right? If that's true, then would this mean that you can still use the existing power switch and wall plug?

Thanks in advance.

Sorry, I didn't see this reply.  The original cells in the 7s3p battery have a max contjnous discharge port cell of 20amps. That said, I rode single at 30Amps without issues - but check your motor for cooling issues. The voltage will affect top speed, but these motors are wound with a low kV (which means that your top speed can be influenced also by the current you pump through them).

When I burned out my original Yuneec ESC, I was going close to 30mph up hills with this battery. With the VESC limited to 70Amp from my custom battery (cont.disch of 70, pulse 120) and 20Amp motor for 10s, my max speed is something like 14-18 mph.  If I push my motor current to 30Amp I get more speed but I stress the motor more.

No, that's accurate.  The original ESC battery cut offs might be higher that mine. My VESC cut offs are based on Cells @ 3.5V and 3.3V.  Additionally I was riding in DC with flats and hills (easy regeneration, my Nisan leaf (poor 70 mile battery) doesn't lose much battery in town except via climate control). I also am light enough that I d get about 18miles with the original ESC.

I'm using sensorless FOC quite successfully and more smoothly than the stock ESC. I will say my settings confuse me. My regen starts at -160Amps and that give me a smooth, gentle stop at any speed (my custom batteries are LiFePo4 which can take a lot of abuse if the regeneration is ever that much). I can't get the hall sensors to work (I've tried wiring them in different configurations all to the same effect. If you get it right, lmk?) But they have no effect on the performance it would seem.  Smooth. And quiet at low speeds, same at 19mph.

That is correct. I hope to but a 10s2p setup in this space as well.

Huh, very interesting. I may just try it out then. I just was going around a trail around here (perfectly flat, around a lake) and got ~11 miles before I had to leave, but if I remember correctly I got the low battery controller vibration around then, so I only get around ~12 miles total. I'm pretty light, so I'm a little surprised I don't get a little more range.

Even if there's a marginal improvement using the VESC and stock battery to bump up the range to their old 18 mile claim, it'd be worth it to me to perform the mod. Later down the line I might swap out the battery too but at least this would get me half way there for now.

Thanks for posting those photos, and I'll let you know if I can get the hall sensors working. I've seen at least one person claim he was able to get it to work (on EndlessSphere), so it might be possible.

I recently purchased two yuneec e-go from ebay. One was in perfect working order and the other one had "connectivity issues" according to the ebay listing. Well I finally had a chance to open up the defective e-go to see what was the issue. 

The connectivity issue was actually a defective battery. The board didn't turn on. The remote control that came with the board worked perfectly with my first board.

I opened up the battery and here is what I found. The BMS had some of the FETs (or diodes?) melted of from the solder from their base. They had also melted off the blue plastic shrink wrap that held the battery together. I soldered the FETs back on but that did not fix the battery. Next I tried to charge the battery but it had no effect.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/4/477fdeea40cc2cdddeb12b814915198eba6f440c.JPG" width="375" height="500">

I checked the battery voltage and it was 6.2 volts on the blue EC3 connector. This is waaaaay too low for a 7S lipo, it comes out at less than 1V per cell. This means that the cells themselves are completely discharged and, I'm afraid, beyond salvageable (I think?).

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/00822ed0aa7189848310fc8f33d9496c97cfc32c.JPG" width="375" height="500">

I also checked the fuse in the battery. Its a 30Amp fuse. The fuse was in good condition and had continuity as confirmed by the cell voltages. The 30 Amps was as high as Yuneec designed the battery to output and I can assume the ESC should be capable up to 30 Amps.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/b09dce0e14ee4bbafe7edb014e79fa1da4c5ef77.JPG" width="375" height="500">

I checked the ESC and motor by unplugging the battery from the working unit and they work perfectly.

Therefore, I'm left with a Yuneec E-GO that only had a bad battery/BMS. 

I'm thinking of getting three (3) lipos with  3000mah to 5000 mah and a cheap lipo balancer to function as my bms. That way I can build a lightweight 9S1P battery and be over the original 7S but below the 10S people say burns the ESC. Hobby king sells a balancer board where you can plug in up to 6 batteries and they will all charge while balanced. I plan on getting a super cheap balance charger from turnigy for battery management.

I'm planning on using the original switch and the VDC input jack to power the lipo balancer to charge the battery. I'd need a new 12 VDC wall adapter as the cheap turnigy balancer will not take the 29 volts coming from the original yuneec wall adapter. 

Also, the drive wheel is overmolded onto the gear itself so there is no way of removing it. The wheels themselves are not particularly heavy or bad. I may end up keeping them.

I may change the bearings for biltins.

The deck is actually flexible once the battery is removed. It is also not particularly heavy. I think I can reuse it, but I would attach the batteries and cover in a way that does not hinder the flex. Otherwise I may get a Never Summer Heist board which is super flexible and really light.

Any ideas suggestions are welcome.

Hiya!

Did you notice how the Yuneec BMS has an open balance port on the BMS? I'm building a BMS based on their slim, pretty board using the higher voltage version of the Texas Instruments; BQ77908A Multi-Cell Lithium-Ion/Polymer Precision Protector (http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/slusav5a/slusav5a.pdf). To be honest, 7-8s is the safe range to keep using your Yuneec hardware.

To reuse the battery pack case (power switch and jack), you should make sure to really fill in the area around the switches/ports with hot glue or waterproof kitchen caulk (to prevent water damage).  The switch CANNOT BE USED DIRECTLY TO CONTROL POWERFLOW. To use it, you connect it to an antispark switch/circuit that acts as a relay (otherwise your switch will be a instant flash fire hazard).  You can disassemble a LiPo pack and fit it into the Yunneec's cabin, but you'll have to make sure its safe from puncture and water and that all of the parts fit.

In your position, I would suggest you ask someone to vacuum form you a box for just the batteries and antispark switch and run battery wires over/under the board. I have one working yunnec battery, a battery shell, and a 10S I'm using with my fully modded Yuneec. If you end up deciding you don't want the Yuneec battery shell, I'd be happy to take it off your hands - they're flexy enough to fit some firmer boards.

Swapping the bearings is a good idea - but you should remember that some cheap bearings can be pretty effective.

While you have the yuneecs as they are, put ducttape under the ESC and cover up points where water can leak in (Bottom, LED side, and switch side).  Yuneec should not be able to say that you can ride through puddles/rain.

I weigh 128-130 lbs, so my speeds were more or less 15mph.

With the VESC using FOC Sensorless I could power the motor up to 20Amp (which is 2/3rd the Batteries 30Amp fuse).  That took me like more or less 17-18 mph and infinitely better hill climbing.

With VESC using BLDC sensorless I would power the motor up to 30Amp (100% of the 30Amp battery) and that still only got me to about 18mph (hill climbing was killer).

Increased amperage helps if you need more torque, however it's not going to increase your speed as much as increased voltage would.

I got rid of all the heavy unnecessary hardware bloat. Tomorrow once the shoogoo is dry ill check the weight as compared to the original yuneec.

The weight reduction is around 1.6lb +\- 0.2. I'm using thr bathroom scale so its not as precise as I would like. However the 1.6lb +\- 0.2 and new weight distribution make the board feel much better and certainly noticeable. They advertise the yuneec as a 13.9 lb but Its actually a bit heavier. Starting weight was 14.4 lband final weight was 12.8 lb.

So i had a chance to ride it briefly. It is certainly faster. I have to measure it but at least 1-2mph more. There seems to be an issue because the breaks work intermittedly and the motor too. It may be on the controller side since i belive the slider is dirty. One thing of note, with the bear trucks I got speed wobbles very quickly. I tightened them down a bit. 

The motor clearance without the housing is as shown on the photo:

Left turning is limited in the rear truck. My solution is to tighten the rear more than the front. I may also trim the plastic in that area to provide a bit more clearance. Also, add rubber spacers instead of the foam I used. The ride was rougher than the original yuneec.

I ordered some white flywheel clones 83mm to lower the weight and ground clearance even more. I think I can make it work based on the extra clearance I have. Do you know where can I get a drive gear that works?

It's a bit tricky, but I used an Evolve drive gear and a 220-5M belt. The belt was just a hair tight, so I made the bolt holes a bit longer by about a mm to bring the motor slightly closer. I also drilled out the center of the drive gear so the bearings would slip all the way though, then I epoxied the the drive gear on. I used a combination of 4 bearings, a spacer, and a few speedrings to get the spacing just right. The bearing setup on the wheel itself is standard and besides glueing the gear onto the the wheel, it didn't need any mods. I also had to grind out the inside edge of the gear so it would fit over the plastic bump on the inside of the motor mount. Works perfectly though.

Ordered the gear through their site.
https://evolveskateboardsusa.com/collections/spare-parts?page=3

I'm sure their are other gears out there that will work as well. Just need it to be for a 15mm belt. Since the gear is a few teeth smaller, you end up with a slightly higher top speed, but a hair less torque. It's not really noticeable though. The softer ride makes a huge difference. 

Here's what it looks like.

Fascinating. Do tell us about the ride quality with the softer wheels.

I have a new Formlabs 3D printer (SLA, therefore each print is essentially a single piece).  I might try 3D printing their drive gear and adding a locking mechanism for flywheels.

The red jst connector coming from the battery to the esc is actually a thermocouple. It is used to measere temperature and can be seen on the app. The new batteries can handle more than enough current and dont even get warm, but the motor gets a little hot. So I removed the thermocouple from the battery and placed it on the motor. Now I can see the motor temp from my phone.

Basically finished the yuneec ego rebuild. I changed the belt to a 9mm from a 15mm and it freed up the drivetrain immensely. It felt almost like a regular board with the lowered roll resistance. However, breaking makes the belt slip. So there is a huge tradeoff. 

Finally, how would you guys protect the battery wires to the ESC? Picture below:

I have the original yuneec enclosure but its long and relatively heavy and will hinder flex on the new deck. That is why I chose to go with the boosted design and distribuited the weight with the battery on the front and the motor/esc on the rear to allow flex in the center.

To protect the batteries I looked at some tupperware and electrical boxes but these dont have the aesthetic appeal im looking for. So i ended up ordering a carbon fiber sheet and epoxy from ebay for $35. It should be light and cover only what I want to cover. 

I still have the issue of exposed wires on the center of the board. I'm thinking of getting some flat speaker wire and double up (16 awg isnt enough) to transfer the power and not have the wires exposed at the bottom. The wire is a little expensive at around $46.

Another option is to route a canal in the center of the board and hide the wires in there and cover up with tape. I would need a router and dont currently have one.

No, it's a security/exploit tool I use in the shop and for work.

Today I rode my modded 8s yuneec ego. The motor got super hot and started smoking and dropped out intermittedly during the end of my ride. The esc was barely warm though.

I knew the motor wasn't in the best shape since it had signs of heavy use. The mounting plate had a little play with respect to the rest of the can, and the bottom of the windings which are exposed had a dark color and didnt look right. In addition, the inner stator rotated a few degrees whenever I rotated the outer can.

I may have to replace the motor but I'm not sure which would fit the yuneec esc other than the original motor. And now that I had a taste of speed (~16mph I think, didn't measure) I want a 20mph+ board. 

Finally, I recommend to everyone to put locktite on all screws. I lost one of the titanium screws and don't have spares. I thought the nylon inside the nut would prevent slippage. Nope.

So I am officially putting up the yuneec esc, controller, trucks, belt, mount and wheels on sale. I can also include the defective motor and defective batteries and battery cover and motor cover in the deal along with other miscellaneous things. I'm asking $200 with shipping included.

Yeah, Yuneec Motors will fry quite easily. They lack thermal sensors and without cooling a burn out was inevitable. 

I haven't tried to use another motor with the ESC, but its a neat idea (can't see why I should try it though).  I don't need any more Yuneec parts right (for now at least).

Sorry friend - but more power to you for trying hard and documenting everything!

Treat yourself to something nice - I'm thinking 10s2p (10Ah) + ESC + Motor Mount + 6355 (ball park like ~$300 if you use LiPO and don't use a VESC).

Funny thing is, I had placed the temp sensor (thermocouple) from the battery and had mounted on the motor mount aurface to get temp data.

Yeah, the temp sensor doesn't matter at all to the ESC. Real shame too - but I guess the battery heat was more concerning.

Hubs sound great, but I'd wait till VESC 5.0.  The current needed to push hubs just isn't good enough through the current mosfets. DirectFets will be better for current and heat issues. You can also try what some of us did to get here - strap and RC ESC to a board (and that does tend to work!)

You cannot communicate with the Stock Yuneec controller.  It's a basic I/O device that, while very simple and probably easily hacked, is already trash and highly likely to break.

Hub Motors that are faster than the Yuneec E-Gos motor don't seem practical.  If the Yuneec motor went 40km/hr and the hubs maxed out at 30km/hr then go ahead.

The yuneec can certainly go faster. You could potentially eliminate unnecessary weight and remove the fan from the motor. That alone gives you around 1mph more. Also change the stock bearings as they are terrible. Finally, getting a larger wheel like the flywheel 97mm clones will bump the speed a couple of miles more. You could potentially get ~15-16mph with those mods.

Nope, because the Yuneecs ESC uses a very "yuneec" hall sensor setup in the motor. Swapping a different motor in isn't quite possible yet.  The VESC can't use the new Yuneec motors with sensors either.

New Problem:

I'm at the point where I think I will sell both boards and build a mountain board instead, because this is just getting a little ridiculous. Before that, I'm going to send yet another email to their useless support and try to send in my board (128 Miles) and both motors.

Just took it out-- doesn't really feel like any sort of top speed improvement, even at 28A. I haven't measured it exactly, but then again I never really measured the stock ESC top speed either. Definitely a bit more aggressive when I throttle up, but I have to adjust some of the settings.

Can't really test hill climbing quite yet because everything is still kind of just sitting on the board and I'm afraid it'll just fall off on a hill. Once I secure everything I'll give it a go.

FOC is noticeably quieter, which is pretty cool. As far as I can tell the hall sensor is working because the startup is really quite smooth, but I'm not 100% sure on that. 

Won't be able to try range either for a little bit, but probably within the next week or so.

Anyone who's done this before-- am I configuring the VESC right to increase the top speed, or is it just the battery voltage limiting the speed? I just changed the motor min and battery max amperage to 28/-28A.

Try raising the max amperage to the motor.  Also, BLDC is generally faster than FOC in my experience with the sensorless Yuneec.

Update: Yuneec is supposedly sending me a RMA despite being past 6-months. Also I got disconnected/hung up on four times in the process.

Raise it from 60A? It's currently set to:

- Motor max: 60
- Motor min: -28
- Battery max: 28
- Battery min: -60
- Abs max: 130

I originally thought that the 60A didn't matter because the battery max was 28, meaning the motor could never get more than 28A regardless what the motor max setting was. Is that not true?

The battery supply + capacitors.  The VESC doesn't always do what it's told.  I rode with higher settings and had 18-20mph speeds (still in development).

The motor value might be for each phase. Remeber that the "400W" motor us a 1K motor by design but lacking in cooling.  So 28Amp to three phases vs 60Amp to 3 phases.  No real risk in testing since the battery is fused. I also ran with the battery capped at 35Amps for a while, but I never saw amperage near on my Wattmeter.

For your problem with the nuts n bolts on your board coming loose, I would suggest using rubber washers. I have a few non-electric longboards that kept losing bolts and as soon as I put rubber washers in between the nut and the wood the problem stopped. I think it has something to do with the friction of the rubber holding the nut in place

I went out and actually measured my speed. Pretty much a constant 12-13mph, regardless of the settings I choose. Even BLDC vs FOC (both sensorless) are pretty much exactly the same speed...

Then what did we do differently?

I kept stock except I swapped the ESC with a VESC. I ran Sensorless FOC.

By chance is the sensor array limiting the max speed by falsely making the rotor seem like its going faster than it really is?

I'm not sure. I also just swapped out the ESC for the VESC, no other modifications.

At first FOC was detecting the hall sensor, but since switching to BLDC to try it out, I can no longer get FOC to detect the hall parameters anymore (reports a bad reading), so when I measured I was riding it sensorless.

My current settings look like this:

I would advise against running on 10s. Folks at endless sphere ran on 10s and burned either the ecu or the motor, it wasn't clear. You might get away with 8s, but don't remove the shroud and fan. Keep in mind this is a 5555 motor, meaning its 55mm in diameter, so its on the small side and does kot get rid of heat easily.

Yes increasing the current will increase heat as P(watts) = U (volts) x I (ampere).

More power = more watts.

The ECU has 2 x 35v 470uF capacitors this means that you can't go over 35volts.
If you power the ECU with 30 volts and you accelerate (raising the Intensity) P (watt) is going to increase proportionaly, but it is not because you have a bigger capacity in the battery that it is going to deliver more Intensity because this is managed by the controller which tell to the ESC how much current to send. (Like an ECU in a car, it's not because you change put a bigger tank that you are going to send more fuel and your car is going to go faster). Does it make sense ?

Yes, but youre forgetting to account for motor load. The 400w yuneec motor has a hard time pushing people heavier than 130lbs past 13mph.  The stress of pushing heats up the motor.  More watts going into the motor will result in more heat waste watts.  Just mint the stator temp since rewinding is not really a good option here.

Is it the mount that's wobbling or the motor case? If it's the mount, then there's two places where it's attached. Behind the wheel is where it attaches to the trucks. Those screws are held in with nuts on the opposite side of the truck mount. If that's not attaching well, you just need new nuts. If you open the small belt cover, there's 4 screws that attach directly to the motor on the other side. If the threads on the motor are stripped, then you need to go to a larger screw and re-thread the motor. 

If you're referring to all the small screws, those are just for the case. If they strip, it's just plastic, so get some larger screws. There is one screw that attaches the case to the truck with a nut and not the mount.

I have the Abec11 90mm 75A's on my EGO and the difference it pretty significant. I think they're only making 78A's now. I have those on another board and still quite a bit softer than the stock EGO wheels. The streets and sidewalks here are crappy so the softer wheels makes for a less jittery ride and gives you better grip. Quieter too. Just know that all wheels are not created equal and a 78A of one brand may be softer than the 75A of another. I think the EGO wheels are 83A's. So if you go for clones, just make sure they are substantially softer, otherwise as gibs said, you might not feel much of a difference.

[This](http://mitrocketscience.blogspot.com/2011/08/hall-effect-sensor-placement-for.html) is a great starter article on the subject of hall sensor placement.  I haven't measured my Yuneec (should be on its way back to DC, they accepted it for repairs).

> ... The above value, m, gives you the number of mechanical degrees that you should space each hall effect sensors apart (for 3 hall effect sensors, that's a total arc of 2*m mdeg). If m is too small for your liking, you can multiply it by any integer value, e.g. 2, 3, 4 etc..., to get other spacings that will work with 120 edeg motor controllers. (While the hall effect sensors will no longer be exactly 120edeg apart, they will be a multiple of 120 edeg apart, which will work, too).

Idk any real specs/engineering specs about the EGo2 sadly.  If you give me some, I can help more.

Torque (turning force) becomes linear force at the tangent point (basically, the spinning becomes pushing where the wheel touches the ground).  The conversion of torque to linear force is dependent on the radius of the wheel (simply stated, 100mm is a 11% increase in radius). You will go a little faster because the wheels have a greater circumference, but the motor will be more strained. Given that I have burned out my EGo V1 motor many times, I would be cautious will how much you stress it (I weigh 130lbs + 20lbs back pack at max).

If you're riding flats and do not plan to climb any hills, go for it. If you've got a few hills in your commute, I'd see how it fares a few times on a smaller slope before powering up it. If you do nothing but hill climbing, you've got the wrong board to ride (I say this as a engineeing student living in ice cold Boston who has burned out plenty of Yuneec motors).

If you want more math about making it work or just playing with the numbers, let us know and we can walk you through how to give us the information we need.

It works great but I had to set the direction to "Reverse" in the ESC config. I could probably reverse it by swapping two of the phase/hall wires.

Does anyone have the motor disassembled to confirm the actual wire pairs for both the phase wires and the hall sensors?

Hey everyone,

I have considered all possible ways of upgrading the E-go, and my best best would be to run a 10s LiPo setup with my board. In case 10s fries my ESC I will buy a VESC anyways.
I still cannot decide wether to put 2x5s 8000mah (https://hobbyking.com/de_de/zippy-fligh ... p-30c.html) in series or get two 10s LiPos with 4000mah (like these https://hobbyking.com/de_de/zippy-compa ... -pack.html)

As 10s chargers would cost me alot more money, I would stick with the 5s ones at first.
My main question here would be whether just to use these Zippy compact series Lipos, as they seem to be cheaper and well, smaller.
While the large ones have a discharge rate of 30C, the smaller compact series LiPos only have a constant output rate of 25C or sometimes even 20C. I was wondering how much the C rating matters in this case and whether 25C would make a big difference in terms of speed when compared to 30C. I dont know how many Amps the motor draws with people that have been using 10s, but perhaps the lower 25C ones could still supply the board with enough power like the 30C ones.

With everyone here using the normal type LiPo sizes, I'd like to give Zippys compact bats a try as well, Im just not sure whether they will be enough for a 10s setup.
UPDATE: I just realized the "Compact" LiPos are only available as 10s 5000mah for some reason. Look like Im forced to get the Zippy 5s1P 8000mah ones, put them in series and see how it goes!

Hey guys, ok so I'm upgrading the battery on my ego2 to at least 9S2P maybe 3P (LG MF1 2200mah/10A). Unfortunately only got one quite fast ride down the block with it, about 2 seconds applying full break and ecu died. Opened it up and one of the IC between the 2 big caps blew up. New ecu is on the way. I am using a BMS with the battery, is there some current blocking required with a nonstock BMS or something else that can be done to the ecu to disable regen, which I think is the issue. For those still interested in modding the battery on the ego2 you can get an empty battery casing with switch and power port from yuneec for $30, I got 2 so I can have pretty much swappable batteries and everything looks stock

Alright so the IC that blew up is the TI TPS5450 5A DC buck converter.
Anybody have a clue why?

I will check the battery but it does not give any signs of life. I currently do not have any other battery to test ESC and motor.

What I understand from this long thread is that:
1-  it seems fairly difficult to re-use the motor and the ESC if you intend to upgrade the battery
2 - The motor lacks power ( and has a very unusual plug)

So I think I will just keep the mechanical parts and put a new battery, VESC and motor, and see how it goes. I kind of like the board itself. What is the max size of motor you can put on the motor mount?
Can you re-use the remote (I could not see where the connection is on the ESC)?

Reusing the remote isn't exactly out of the question.  On both of my ESCs however, the NRF module was built into the ESC itself.  It is possible to sync the remote to another device, but I was unable to make much since of the ROM I dumped from the ESC's AMTEGA beyond the motor control and timing algorithms.  If you'd like, I can probably find and send you a copy of it (you'll want a copy of IDA or a similar binary to assembly editor).  There are no comments in the code so you're really on your own there.

I bring this up because in the very unlikely case that Yuneec modified the firmware of the NRF modules, you'll have to know what pipes and channels need to be tapped. You could purchase a Nordic NRF developer kit ($120 ish used) and read the firmware settings and recreate them on a new chipset.

Again, there's a lot of labor involved. I'm thinking about designing the original boosted ring remote concept in SW and getting it working.  I'll be using NRF with basic encryption and frequency hopping as well as a spring loaded wheel, much like the current boosted remote. Yuneec uses a resistive slider, but that would experience a lot of wear as a ring style thing.  I'll look into how to use the magnetic rotary encoders for this.

The 5450 is a 36V max input part. It converts the battery voltage to 5v (or 3.3v or whatever, I haven't checked) to run the board and electronics. 
http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps5450.pdf

A 7S battery is ~29.4V.  If you run a 9s battery, you're now at 37V.  It's going to fry that part eventually even without braking. 

Drop your 8S tops. 

When you brake, the voltage shoots up to charge the battery, probably 40-42V or so, so you're going way over the design limits of that part and toasting it. 

Even with an 8s battery, you will still be frequently frying that part.  

Something you could try is adding a 36V zener diode as a bootleg overvoltage protection mechanism on the controller input. I suspect this is what kills the regulator in regular use as well - if you have a fully charged battery and try to brake, the voltage will go up even higher (because the battery is full and doesn't accept charge, the voltage gets higher). 

You'd want a BZX85C36 or similar.

Replaced ECU with Focbox upgraded to extended firmware, nano-x and ble, running in FOC mode with stock motor beautifully. Tweaking with stock battery for now, once I max out it's potential will switch to 9S.

It's much quieter when riding it, near silent at certain levels. If I think of a safe way to record the motor while riding I will 🙂

I have to say breaking is awesome, I'm still tweaking settings but I can stop from full speed(16-17mph) within 2-3ft smoothly enough to not fly off, it can break hard enough to stop on a dime at any speed it's capable of going, which was fun to find out 😉

Hi there, 
I have bought a second hand ego for only 50 euro's. The battery was dead and i think they have cut some of the balance kabels....but I am making battery packs so it was easy to make a new pack :) The only thing is that inside the bms the e-switch is not working. Does anybody know where i can get a new official bms? Yuneec only offer a new batterypack incl bms for 300 euros :confused:

Did you check that the 30A fuse was not blown?

I blew mine out after installing a VESC. My wife broke her arm because of the crap bluetooth latency on this board. now i use a PPM controller, and a VESC and 3d printed a new enclosure. :)

I blew the fuse when i ran the motor configuration running an old firmware which drew more than 30A from the battery on accident, and had to repair it.

If you have a yuneec ego and are not satisfied by its performance, know that in order to make an upgrade that worths it, you need another ESC (the Yuneec ESC is very fragile and will not handle no upgraded motor). If you upgrade it to a VESC, you can only safely used a 7s battery if you are planning in keeping the same motor (that motor is also so so! at 7s it get hot as hell, that's why there is a fan on it. It's pretty well covered up, you never really know it's hot). Now you are thinking of upgrading the motor too. Well, that battery pack uses high capacity cells, with a low current draw, so the crazy amps your new VESC and motor need will heat them up too much. Again, that's why that temperature sensor is on there causing "slowdowns" to your yuneec. Better yet, another motor will also require another mount! That mount only fit the Yuneec motor. You will need a longer belt and the right pulley. By the time you realize you should 've built a separate DIY board, you already messed up your Yuneec!

Hi to all! I know the thread is old, but hope there is still someone that can help me. First of all, i still learning about 18650's and bms and electric vehicles, harvesting batteries and have good ones right now, so i have some questions. I can buy ego for 50 bucks without battery, charger, and remote... For start i can use iphone as remote thats ok, but for the batteries and charger:

1. I want to buld 8s 3or4p battery pack, what bms to use, any suggestions? I read here that any of them can be used if battery pack goes directly to esc... In that case esc can handle current? What are amp limit from batteries to stock esc? Batteries are from harvested laptop cels, branded and around 2000-2200mah, still dont know exactly c ratings but i see that stock batteries are low drain? Or maybe is better way to use bms that have curent regulation so i can limit let say at 25amps?

2.Can i also charge battery through same bms (like just plug 30v power adapter to bms) or i need balanced charger? In case i need balanced charger (allready have imax b6) can i separate batteries in 2x4s?

3. What about breaking, i dont need charging, just need breaks to work, that control esc too?

Sry for my bad englis, and thanx, Filip ✌️

Welcome!!! 3 or 4p should give decent current (Except if the batteries) are too used, so make sure to test them (something like this should do it: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07428G1G2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
I suggest you get a bms, wire for only charging and run the power leads directly to the ESC (that's doable). https://www.ebay.com/itm/8S-8-S-33-6V-18650-Li-ion-Lithium-Battery-BMS-Board-29-6V-Polymer-Balance-Board/132712504773?hash=item1ee6481dc5:g:5bgAAOSwrFxbUryD

[/quote]

Not sure what you mean
If you are using a VESC, you don't need to know your battery capabilties, the VESC will figure it out when you run detection.

[quote="PhillStone, post:244, topic:1196"]
(like just plug 30v power adapter to bms) or i need balanced charger?
[/quote]

An 8s battery is fully charged at 33.6V, so you are gonna need a 33.6v charger to charge it fully. 30V will stop charging at 3.75v per cell (instead of 4.2v). If you wire a bms, you don't need a balance charger. Go with the bms (Balance chargers suck for skatebaords because you can not leave two batteries connected in series while charging with balance charger)

[quote="PhillStone, post:244, topic:1196"]

If you want it easier and simpler, leave it as a 8s pack and wire a bms

Newbie question:
The ego2 is currently on sale for 199€ in pink.
I bought one and of course I would like to get closer to the boosted board in speed but especially in power uphill (am kind of heavy). 

Would it work to get another cheap ego2 and attach the additional powered truck as front truck and somehow reverse the motor?
I’m not sure about the electric side, the another problem could be the board turning/twisting because the power comes from front left and back right which could lead to falls.

What do you think?

Thanks
