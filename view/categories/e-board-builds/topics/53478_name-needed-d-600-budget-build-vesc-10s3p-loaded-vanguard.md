Hi, 
So after spending some time in the Forum I decided to build my own board :smiley:
So I just wanted to know what you all thinking about it. Just a quick sidenote I´m 13 years old and from Austria so 
 I´m already sorry for any misspellings :smiley:
So those are the parts that I choose. :slight_smile: 

* Diyeboard Loaded Vanguard Clone [http://www.diyeboard.com/38%E2%80%B3-longboard-deck-loaded-vanguard-clone-bamboo-and-maple-deck-p-581.html](http://www.diyeboard.com/38%E2%80%B3-longboard-deck-loaded-vanguard-clone-bamboo-and-maple-deck-p-581.html)

* Diyeboard 10s3p Battery

* Diyeboard Single Drive train [http://www.diyeboard.com/single-belt-drive-1400w-n5055-motor-power-truck-front-truck-kit-p-421.html](http://www.diyeboard.com/single-belt-drive-1400w-n5055-motor-power-truck-front-truck-kit-p-421.html)

* @Martinsp  Refurbished Vesc

* Nano X Remote eventually @BoostedBuilder 

So if anyone has any suggestions just leave them under this topic :smiley: 
**By the way is there someone who could make me an enclosure for this whole thing preferably in the EU** :smile:
