Sick ! I've been waiting for an Icarus build ! Would take that deck over my vanguard any time :blush:  If those weren't that expensive I would go for one immediately !

I think OKP has an Icarus but doesn't want to electrify it

Yup! Love the Icarus! Drop though is a huge plus, the Flex is perfect and you feel super locked into the board with the grip and concave.

I can't blame him. It was super tough making the decision and actually making it electric. It's such a good board for normal riding!

Great work but it hurts me to see Icarus' wings covered up like that :cry:, He does not need electricity, Icarus can fly!

Reference: Icarus and Daedalus

How do you like the flex on it? Do you have flex 1 or 2? How flexy is it?

You have to be running 12s in FOC that thing whispers , sweet build buddy.

@Eboostin I'm 145lb and I have Flex 1, I think it's perfect for electric boards. I'm going to save up and buy a flex 2 as a regular board.

@Plumb77 No, The Motors are just super quiet it's on the BLDC, I try not mess with FOC

I'm not a fan of drop through decks, but that is a beautiful build.  I might have to try one just to see if I can get used to it.

One more thing, what is the distance between the drop through openings (space for enclosures)?

Hey!
My Bad I missed the comment.
The spacing is 4 1/2 inches between enclosures. 
With a little redesign of the cases you can get that space much larger!

Hey, no problem! Thanks for replying.

My interest was more in the length from drop through slot to drop through slot. I can only find wheelbase online which doesn't accurately reflect the space between to put enclosures.

The blue line length <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/e/2e00e74e53ade8c2056fec142dfda6a91907c0d3.PNG" width="500" height="500">

Thank you. Really like your build! 

How is the voltage sag with 12S2P?

nice to see the icarus. I set up mine with ronins, great versatile super light board that even can be pumped really well with ronins. felt like I didnt actually want to electrify it. :stuck_out_tongue:

some dremel work required for ronins though, but it was totally worth it:

not sure why loaded has the icarus mostly equipped with paris, I really didnt like those at all. :confused:

@Eboostin It's not bad. when the battery drops to 20% on the screen that's where I start to notice it. But that's around 14 miles in to a trip! If I accelerate slowly at that point then I don't even notice it until the cut-off occurs on the VESC.

@whitepony Honestly this board is so good I'm going to buy another one to keep as my push board. It does not need to be electrified! Paris are fine. I prefer Caliber and have never tried Ronin but I wanted to use these old Limited Paris trucks I had laying around and thought they would be perfect on this board.

awesome build, I would recommend less angles on your box because it breaks (a bit) the harmony of the beautiful Icarus shape.

@oriol360 @whitepony

Have you tried fitting 90mm wheels? Everything I keep reading says 80mm max.
```

i can try 90mm and post pictures in 1-2 hours. in the woods with the dogs right now :blush:

update: no chance with ronins and centered wheel cores, but ronins have comparably high lean. probably other trucks, offset wheels or stiffer bushing might work. worst case scenario you just make it work with some dremel action! :smile:

Thanks for the quick pics!

The black wheels and black ronins look money. 

Hmm on the dremeling...

@oriol360 I'm planning to get a icarus build running :) Would you see any problems running the board with caliber trucks and a 6374 mounted(Kegel wheels) ? Or would you say there is not enough space to run a belt system

You shouldn't have a problem as long as you can mount the motors in the back.
similar to an Evolve board.
