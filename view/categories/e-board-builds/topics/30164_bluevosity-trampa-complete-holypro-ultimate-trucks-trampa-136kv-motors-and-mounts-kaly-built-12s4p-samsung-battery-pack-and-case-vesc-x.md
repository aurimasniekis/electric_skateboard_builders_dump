Undertaking my first "build" of an eboard.  Went in for the Trampa Holypro. I'll be using this to commute and also using the rail system, so wanted to try to keep it as light as possible for a big eboard. Gotta be able to carry it up and down stairs! 

I'm pretty early in the process, and as any newbie I've had a lot of questions, hope to get some of the answers I've found down here and hit other questions as well.

Step one for me was making sure to solder the BMS sensor wires in the correct places on the battery.. Confirmed with @kaly that this was the correct ordering in correspondence to the labeling on the circuit board

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/e/4ed2b88aab519103f4287ab43089644bac6bdd78.jpg" width="375" height="500">

After that I picked up a[ Hakko soldering iron](https://www.amazon.com/Hakko-FX888D-23BY-Digital-Soldering-FX-888D/dp/B00ANZRT4M/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1502285716&sr=8-3&keywords=hakko+soldering+iron) from a local electronics shop. (love it!) and used it to solder extra length onto the sensor wires. Then double checked to make sure corresponding wires would reach their solder points.  (there are plenty of soldering "how to videos" already.. somebody have a favorite to insert here?)

Next was to get going on some alterations to the deck and battery case.. Got the case squared up to the deck and laid out where the threaded inserts would be located. Put masking tape down on the edge of both the deck and the case for easy marking, making it much quick to relocate the case after drilling.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/b/9ba682c6769653b2d214dfdf23d15911c7123e55.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Made marks for realignment and drilling.. sorry no photos of drilling, but first I drilled the wholes through the battery case, then I realigned it and clamped it back down to the deck, used a drill bit back into the holes to start/mark the hole in the deck.. switched to a larger bit and drilled the holes in the deck.  

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/5/a5b990970db498b758904bd41b8cfde9fbd9a2f2.jpg" width="375" height="500">

So the holes are great for reducing some weight, but I'm doing a bottom mounted battery, so can't have it exposed to the elements. 
started by masking over the holes at the top of the deck and then masking at the bottom.. only cutting the tape at the bottom.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/4/f43d41c605e67f28afdd0146acd705d2342a79bf.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Then I filled in the holes with expandable foam.. I had some from smooth-on, so just used it, but if you go this route I'd simply use insulation foam from Home depot.. This will fill the void while staying nice and light.. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/8/a8fc9d4701019c89c10afc241ee05bb845e06d9a.jpg" width="375" height="500">

easily cut the excess foam off with a scalpel. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/7/374a60eaca35ecbfc5d4f2727aedc3e715831f63.jpg" width="375" height="500">
Then dug out about an 1/8 of an inch (currently working from the bottom of the deck)  I want to make sure that this is completely water tight, so multiple layers of material will be used. Also, created a bit deeper trench around the edge, as this is the most crucial space to ensure adhesion with the next layer. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/3/d3fae300b6220ce9b2424383631c5b3548f6854a.jpg" width="375" height="500">
Filled in my trench and coated the top with PC-7 <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/f/af8e1d0b9e4e7758743b536aed5313d1c11633c4.jpg" width="375" height="500">
Not photographed is after the first cure I spoted some little holes, so I ended up doing an additional skim coat.. all sealed up now. and this is basically where I'm at..

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/0/f069d29b2effb1de1159b0d7b84df37ec421bb26.jpg" width="666" height="500">

The PC-7 is all cured I had also drilled the deck and implanted the threaded inserts.. I also used PC-7 to insure they remain secure for a very long time.  With that done and waiting for the wires to arrive for the next steps I decided to put the wheels on and push it around a bit.. makes me even more excited to get this thing some power..

One thing coming up that makes me a bit uncomfortable is extending the motor sensor wire so it's long enough to reach the VESC-x.  The connector on it is already the right size, so my plan is to snip the wire and solder each wire back together long enough to reach and then heat shrink that back together.. this seams to be the cleanest approach, but is a bit more surgical than I've experience prior to this.  How does this sound @trampa? I think I've read somebody doing it this way but it was awhile ago, anybody actually done it like his?

Yesterday afternoon my [heat sinks](http://www.ledsupply.com/led-heatsinks/half-brick-heatsink-black-powder-coated-finish-with-screws) arrived.  I had a flat piece of Aluminum from @Kaly, but 
1) I'm about 187lbs 
2) there are some sizable hills on my commute, and 
3) I live in HOTlanta GA.. 
I want to get as much heat out of the box as possible while maintaining a water tight enclosure. 

So this morning was altering the box to fit the VESC's and the heat sinks: 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/d/fd8c95b64b7556e6efde8800678a1dd05658b51a.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/3/b32ae89ed9ba061ef4d35992d483c630634eda62.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/7/e7ac776e8fe904dfc96bcebf3f654310c84bd71e.jpg" width="666" height="500">

First was to make sure it would all fit and where the holes needed to be drilled etc.. 
Then mark out where the heat shrink would protrude and cut the inner box out.
Then cut one line for the last fin of the heat sink and used the spaces on the sides to hold the heatsink in place.  Then I know for sure it won't be going anywhere.
I could have been a bit more precise with my cuts, but I've got black [Sugru](https://sugru.com/) coming soon that will fill in the void really well, make it water tight, and is heat resistant so it shouldn't disconnect when the sink heats up.   That's all I've got time for today.

Some progress was made over the weekend. Most of my orders arrived, but still waiting on a couple small things. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/1/911ff0f9a1d460b425bdb4becd54b5be5661baa8.jpg" width="375" height="500">
There's a lot of double/triple checking that things fit.. After planning on placing the charging port, switch, and usb extension on the same side, I had a change of mind.  Instead of crowding that side, I decided to reduce the size of the heat sink on the BMS to make room for the switch on the opposite side of the enclosure. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/a/ca1050336a4178f35a2f608a80b2eacf8c448527.jpg" width="375" height="500">
Got that cut and ground down so cords could run over the top and an xt60 connector could fit in the space to the side.  (also not shown is that I filed and sanded all the edges smooth so they wouldn't cut into any cord over time)
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/c/ccc97944a23dcd72eeefe5e81fbb8b7c2e60edce.jpg" width="666" height="500">
used some thermal paste between the sink and BMS and then heat shrink to secure it. After that, cut out the fins to enable better heat dispersion. 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/4/d4f08bcff1b91bcd6c2641025d3efc0e66788fa0.jpg" width="666" height="500">

The motor sensor wires weren't long enough to reach the VESC-X controlers with the @kaly under deck case.  I spliced the cord (nerve wracking) and soldered all ends to a longer length of wire.  
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/5/85307e710f46431d89693f77da3b7a8c38673884.jpg" width="375" height="500">
I know that brown heat shrink isn't pretty, but it all ends up in another casing eventually so I'm not too worried about it..  all extension solder points done and secured in heat shrink. now it reaches no problem.. (not seen is temporarly taped the VESCs in place and mounted the battery enclosure.. connected the sensor wire to the VESCs and had the motors in place.. stepped on the deck and push to simulate the tightest possible turn.. measured how long the cord could be pulled and gave it another .5 cm to be sure.. and that's where it was cut.)

My black Sugru showed up so I got the heat sinks permanently attached. as well as the battery indicator 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/8/988e13ba8042aac2a8768830cca408eb1ed391dc.jpg" width="690" height="459">

Also made the rest of the modifications to the enclosure The only other thing permanently installed is the USB extension.. the charger and switch can still be removed, for now.

The holes at the top still had foam exposed as I only used PC-7 at the bottom.. With the arrival of the black Sugru, I used that to seal off the top.. Black on black.. :) 
With the motors off I also removed the belt and took it outside for a roll around.  Wanted to feel the carving and test turning radius.. I had ordered Dampas but decided to take them out, ended up setting it up with inner spring position on the front and outer spring on the back. No Dampas.. We'll see how that feels once this thing has power, but seems like the right feel as of now.

Triple checking on this, but the positive is the top one and the negative is the lower one, right? This is the D/C charging port (back).

I'm soooooo close to having this thing working! Super excited.  I've just done my first test ride!  I'm running into a problem that you might be able to help me with..
My sensor wires were too short to get from the motor to the FOCBOX so I spliced them and soldered in these wires:
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073QJZ3PD/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

They were 26 awg. it was the  closest I could find that came in a set like this.

So when I plug the ESC  into the computer and go to set it up it detects the Hall, but when I set it as either FOC and then do the Hall detection and click "Apply" then write configuration the motors get really jittery 
Then I tried BLDC and used sensored mode and they chop all over.. 
Finally I got it running using sensorless in FOC.  I think I could also use BLDC and sensorless.. 

Now I've just done a test ride and as I put load on the board it stats to get a little choppy at higher speeds.. maybe I'll switch to BLDC but FOC is supposed to be smoother? 

@Jinra you mentioned the sticker was wrong, but the cable from the motor is set to fit into the FOCBOX sensor port.. So the sticker being wrong isn't like the wiring is actually incorrect causing this sort of problem, right?

If you follow what the sticker says you're sensors wont work since one of them wires is plugged into the temperature pin. You have follow the PCB, but the correct order is..

GND, HALL3, HALL2, HALL1, TEMP, 5V

## \#9 Posted by: Darby Posted at: 2017-08-20T00:16:34.574Z Reads: 256

```
and that's the order the wires come in on the motor at the start? I spliced and lengthened each sensor wire, I haven't changed the plug at all. Is the color coding for this order standard? 

I think the jitters that are happening right now might be the battery dying. I'm charging it now and will see how that goes.  The meter was reading full but everything just been wired and I didn't try it after use.

I'm having another problem with my voltometer.. doesn't seem to be reading correctly: 
First I tried wiring + on meter to + after the loop key
and - meter to - after the BMS
(basically did both on the xt60 just before the ESC)

That option showed full battery even when the battery wasn't full.  Until it was all empty then it showed empty.

Then I tried + on meter to directly into the battery +
and - on the meter to the + just before the ESC 
(As diagramed in the attached file)

That just gives me nothing.. 

I'm trying it when the loop key is in.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/1844c22ce5cd37d31ff2644bed9b2d27968f685e.jpg" width="690" height="388">

That voltage display you are using is 12V, you need to connect it to the last 3 cells of you pack (via the balance leads)

The good news is that that display is pretty robust, i jammed 50V in it while testing it (thinking it was 12S). Realized after it was 12V, during this build http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/arch-s-build-log-kaly-nyc-build-dual-6374-focbox-12s4p/25995?u=blasto

Just a quick update on the Hall sensor settings.. I don't know if I was just doing something out of order or it was because the motor wires (three power wires not the sensor) had to be shuffled around a bit to get things lined up, but I went through all the steps today to get it set up in FOC with the Hall and it was great. I changed my motor settings a bit too based on some suggestions from Trampa.  Screen shots: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/9/b99d150f73f839eabe8586a76143d6b911ca3b13.png" width="690" height="343"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/9/19e653c3fc96ebb3a69ddbe79bcac1ddf1fb6061.png" width="690" height="338">

I only have to get my controller calibrated on PPM now.. it's close enough to work as it is, but I should do the adjustment.  
Braking was so much softer at high speeds on my test ride.. Feels safer.. I don't think I'm hitting my highest possible speeds yet, and it's plenty quick at 50amps max. 

 I'm getting a little wobble, but I haven't been on a board in awhile still think I'll move the springs on the front back to the outer position. With the commute I'd rather a little more stability than a nimble turning radius.. not going to get that anyway... 

I had my meter on the xt60 again, so I just cut it off and threw some tape over the little ends.  Didn't want to re-solder that thing AGAIN.. I'll throw a piece of heatshink over it to ensure the tape stays put.. and will need to solder some length to the meter wire to reach the spot it's supposed to be in.  

Should have this thing all wrapped up early this week..

aahh.. that's what the difference is.. at the dual.  will do! Should I set it at 25 to match the 50 motor max?  When I set-up in the first place I did it directly to each ESC via USB.  At this point if I change settings, I can FWD over the CAN, right?

When setting up, be carefull when doing CAN fwd'ing, it will overwrite the sensor table. That's the tricky part with sensored setups, the sensor table is different on each motor on a dual setup (all the time)

I would recommend to have your motor max from 50 to 80A on each (depending on your riding skill level) and your batt max under 30A on each

80A?! that's a lot, no? Kaly was suggesting 60A  Perhaps I'll throw it back there.. My skill level with the body on the board is pretty high.. throwing the thumb into the mix is odd, but that's only been a few minutes of riding at the moment.

I think I'll just stick with doing the motor set-up with an opened up board and doing it individual.  I don't see myself changing the settings all that often once I get it dialed in.

60 it is then! :) a little fear in one's life keeps things interesting.  just have to know when to employ it. 

So as you're on the same set up and riding at 60A can I bother you for your spring positions / dampa or no dampa? I ordered some greens when I bought the deck just in case, but currently they are out with a outer position in the back, inner in the front.. but thinking I'll try outer/outer.

So I had my first ride from my studio to campus today! fun, but a little scary.. the acceleration is a bit intense.. I don't mind the top speed being high (kinda like that) but it gets there a little too early on the trigger. Feels like it wants to be at the drag race!  What can I adjust to smooth that out a little?

I have 130 in the absolute Max value in the Current Limits.. If I click the Slow Absolute Max box will that create a softer transition, or lowering this value?

So I just realized that little switch on the enertion nano controller I have that says "slow" and "R-spec"  I've just ignored the "slow"  but it dawned on me that I could also make that adjustment to try things out.. ya.. well.. that's hardly "slow"....ha.. not on this set-up anyway. now the acceleration is manageable on the throttle, I don't fear my legs kicking out on the slightest touch..

I also want to make a note on here for anybody using this thread to help do a build.. I purchased the antispark switch from DIY.. This was a HUGE mistake.  Don't do it! First time on, and it just stayed on, wouldn't shut off.  Contacted customer service.. Radio silence after forwarding me to a setup video as if it were my fault..

I mean sure, I almost blew my battery meter, but that really would have been my fault! ;)

With the start of a new semester the board was being ridden, but wasn't actually finished up.  Wanted to give it a few rides before setting the ESC's down tot he heat sinks (because it's easier to access prior to doing that) and obviously didn't want to lock in all the wiring until the motors were done being sealed up.  
Now I'm happy with the controller settings.. dropped it down to 50 max motor and changed the motor min to 40.. 
I have the enersion controler and on these settings I'm currently using the "slow" setting and it's fine, I anticipate being able to control the "R-Spec" setting after a few more rides and being comfortable on the board.. at 60 max and 35 min the thing was semi manageable on "slow" but I wasn't ready for it, and I didn't see the need for the "R-spec" mode ever.. and then the breaking was way too soft on "slow" but ok on "R-spec".  

Now that I'm happy with the settings I've opened it back up to finish things up and get it sealed from dust and water.  Weather stripping the edges prior to adding a thin plastic later over everything (obviously need to wait until the motor sensor wires are through to do that.

Also got some Black Sugru to fill the holes where the cords come into the box. 

Last thing I need to finish is wire meshing the motors, waiting on some additional machine screws for that. I got the front done as per instructions on @trampa 's build thread: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/official-trampa-diy-build-thread-street-and-urban-carve/22294

Also needed to alter the mount for my Blitzu front light. I'm adhearing it to the front of the board but it was bouncing out of the mount.. drilled into the mount and the light where it slides into the mount and glued in some magnets.. this should keep it from bouncing out.  Need to reahere it to the board afterward. Using Sugru to do that.

I haven't been on for many months. Busy with work etc.. The board has been great to ride as a commuter vehicle. Attached is the complete set up.

On thing I would not do if I were starting over is dropping in heatsinks on the VESCs when using an ABS plastic case, the material can not handle this modification and I have a small crack on both sides.. It's been holding in, but I'll need to change the battery case soon. (to be clear, this is not a flaw in the case but the modification that I performed that it couldn't deal with)

I purchased the batteries spot welded and shrink wrapped. I think I had to order the cells first and shipped them to his location, but you'll want to check w/ him.
