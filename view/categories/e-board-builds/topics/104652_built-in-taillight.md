Hey Guys. So I'm a deck with a built in taillight/brake light. Do you think people would want decks like this??![Message_1575761617408|281x500](upload://q25TpOKTsWI5NwxcNkXh6Kj678F.jpeg) ![Message_1575761557184|690x388](upload://5wnC1RI9CVS6lLrdzLF7KPizeke.jpeg) ![Message_1575761648867|281x500](upload://kUHQhN0atJhnd5KZuVi0le4d6re.jpeg) ![Message_1575919759176|690x388](upload://zq1UgtUpKkAHBZCBMYGNolwuCXe.jpeg)

Well it's my own wood deck design and build. The lights going to have 7 red LEDs. Different patterns and all come on for braking. I wanna start building Decks with electronics imbedded out of wood. Even Cncing my entire battery enclosure out of same wood pattern!üòâ. Lined with prepreg. Can't wait!.

Well that is suprising!
We are very open about what we think over there, if a design is bad or can be greatly approved or a better alternative already exists then we will say it.
What is your username over there?

i think some people like the all in 1 look and very nice work btw. Big thing i want to see is REACTIVE lighting. brakes and turn signals sound silly but could be a life saver. Would be awesome if they looked cool too and didnt get in the way.

Seems these lights are shining upwards, wouldn't that blind someone else?

Is it a taillight company? Seems like an odd thread to announce this.

You should move to the alive forum mentioned above.
