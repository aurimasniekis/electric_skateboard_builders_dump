Just wanted to say thank you to the forum for all the help and info with getting this project done. It‚Äôs been pretty much 7 months to the day that I decided to have a go at building an esk8. My end goal was to have something pretty small and powerful with a kicktail - I live in a small town with lots of really steep hills. I‚Äôm really happy with how it‚Äôs turned out.

Fibreglass. 3 x 300g layers of matting and 1 x layer of surface tissue. I rubbed it down and spray painted it but it looked terrible. In the end I sprayed it with 3m Shultz under vehicle protection. It‚Äôs a hard rubberised and textured finished. It‚Äôs looks professional now üòÇ![image|375x500](upload://nrrN8xP2qzM78N9Tnf2y5LjFmiE.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://3ZfR66HRDmuAejzcWSOKtjkkeZP.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://8nWPe9OaX6RkWA13LIhjrbv3CV0.jpeg)

It‚Äôs a very fine stranded fibreglass matting, typically used as a final external layer. It helps hide the coarser strands that is in the 300g matting. You use it the same way as the other matting - put it over your mold and roll the resin in.

What pulleys are you using? I'm trying to find a new set.

And that's a super clean build.
