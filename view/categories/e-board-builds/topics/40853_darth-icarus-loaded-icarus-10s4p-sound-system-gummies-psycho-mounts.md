Let's not talk about pushing it.. it'll be fine. I'm 127lb and hardly stress big motors. Which also means I don't produce alot of Regen current because I don't have alot of mass. ;) 

Sit back and enjoy, it's happening. ;)

Side note: actual mechanical kv is not 190. See post #1 parts list.

That battery array could lead to too many issues:

1. The enclosure would have to be flareless, no flares no support for the holding screws
2. A squared flareless enclosure would be possible but your deck would look really bad, chunky and fat
3. The icarus is extremely flexible, so that array will lead to issues, too many vibrations and thousend of flexions could lead to broken wires and possible fire
4. I suggest you use a two segment enclosure like the vanguard, but with two battery enclosuse in order to fit the amount of batteries you need and leave the center free

[quote="Deckoz, post:1, topic:40853"]
note the 10mm bearing on the shaft as the mount will have an integrated bearing
[/quote]

Why...? There is already a bearing between the shaft and the stator housing which is hard mounted to your motor mount. If anything you're just introducing extra friction into the system. If the two bearing are not aligned perfectly, they will cause a side load which will lead to either bearing becoming seized eventually. 

I don't see it. Am I missing something???

Have you ever had to replace motor bearings? Pressing them out isn't fun. Having a rider for the shaft will allow the fulcrum center to be closer to the pulley. Decreasing leverage against the motor bearings.

Why else would Boosted do it other then to increase the lifespan of motor bearings? Also..the friction from two bearings is negligible

Did you look at psychotillers new mounts?

I just ordered Surfrodz 200mm hanger trucks. What angle base plate did you get? 

Also, how did you get the 80mm axles?  I only saw 70mm from Surf Rodz.  Psychotiller includes 90mm axles with his mounts, but I don't know if I will need the 90s with a 200mm hanger (his full kit with the trucks includes a 176mm hanger).

If I'm not mistaken.. Psychotillers are 176mm hangars with 90mm Axles. I would get his...but they simply won't clear the deck for me running drop through...would probably be fine for top mount.

[/quote]

Thats easy...ok, easy enough. 
I'm not a big fan of flanges and had thought of these alternatives already.

You could do it a couple ways. 

1.  The better way...  take a skilsaw and set the angle at 45°.  Set the depth at around 3/8"/10mm , and cut a channel out of the deck on each side. 
 But wait!!  You need to hot glue a guide to the deck to make it acurate, as well as practice on some scrap unless you're very competent with a skilsaw.. But wait!!!  You might want  use a thin kerf blade.

Then after test fitting, mix up the resin and insert your Aluminum strips or flat stock carbon, or the glass/Kevlar or whtever flat stock you made and prefer. 

These^^ are visible (on the outside) when your enclosure is installed.  (abs or kydex or glass, or whatever). 
Cap on the rear of the enclosure.
Use T-nuts or sex bolts to attach it to the stingers.
to remove or install the lid, unscrew it, remove the front truck and slide it in/out. 



This other way is easier, but meh... becuse 90° Sides.. 


Get some 1x1x1/8" aluminum angle. Cut out the deck so the flat side sits in it flush. 
Glue/screw it to the deck, and make your enclosure go over them. Screw the encl to the angle. 
Done.




Edit: where are the oh shit bars getting installed?

It's fairly easy with an arbor press. I've never had an issue but then again not everyone has access to an arbor press....

Gotcha! I hadn't thought about that. I guess you can't get any closer than the thickness of your mount plus some clearance so you would decrease your lever arm by that much with an extra bearing.

I've never seen a boosted other than from far away. 

[quote="Deckoz, post:14, topic:40853"]

[/quote]

That isn't the issue. Lets say your rider bearing is slightly off center from your mounting pattern, I'm talking tenths of a thousand of an inch. With the two bearings so close together, you have very little room for misalignment before you induce a side load on your bearings. At this point you are inducing the issue you are trying to avoid. 

I've had this exact issue on propulsion drive trains in uavs. You end up over constraining the assembly. 

Just something to watch out for! :)

Was thinking about going flush to the edge, and having machined/threaded inserts into the glass, with screws going through the deck like truck hardware.

Oh shit handles are gonna probably end up towards the rear of the middle of the board... Wherever they make the board balanced

Since this is an expensive build, you could 3D print the enclosure, SLS using shapeways, the print they use for white parts is big enough, its going to be 200 plus dollars, but you can make an ultra custom enclosure that is also slightly flexible

Haha yeah..just I can never find good bearings that aren't half the cost of the motors after shipping. So the laziest outweighs the effort of finding good NSK bearings, waiting for them, replacing them.. or buy a motor and don't wait... Or decrease the fulcrum length by the thickness of the mount by adding a bearing...

I printed in PETG, it's still flexible with the deck, but on flexy decks eventually the layer bonds break and the enclosures become squeaky. If I did another it would still be PETG or Nylon...maybe even TPU..but would be almost impossible to print a full board enclosure in TPU... 

I'd stay away from PLA and ABS filaments for enclosures too.

Thanks, I will think about it, I’m using abs since my printer can’t handle nylon or other materials that would be better, let’s see how it handle

Another option would be make the sides that attach to the board 3D printed and the top an aluminum or carbon fiber sheet, at least this is my plan in case my enclosure fails miserably

Just reading the spec list I think this might be really really hard... You can check out my build thread in which I used the icarus. I went for a 10s4p setup and the usable room for application is really tight.  However I was only using 1 layer of cells. You might be able to stack 2 layers but it will still be hard. Plus it might look extremely chunky.

Do you shape foam for a fiberglass mold plug?  If so, what do you use to seal it before waxing and mold making? I am shaping a plug from foam (So much easier than wood... in someways).  I ordered this duratec surface primer to hopefully seal the plug so I can polish,wax it, and make it rigid enough for vaccum bagging.

Use Bondo to fill it til smooth. Then spray it with gelcoat. Sand and polish the gelcoat to a finish. Then wax the snot out of it for a few days. Spray it with pva mold release. Then gelcoat  and apply fiberglass. Your foam part that was originally bondo'd and gelcoated is essentially a positive buck..

Note I said spray the part with gelcoat to make a nice finish like painting

And then the later part applying gelcoat is done with a brush and thick as recommended by the container..

Little update:
 So I purchased a Loaded Icarus and a Landyachtz Evo that has been sent to @Eboosted to design some custom enclosures.  Looking forward to  seeing what Alan comes up with.  So I'll be holding off on building the battery until after I receive the enclosures.

Also look what has shown up.
- 50T SuperStar pulleys @Nowind
- Focboxes after having an invalid tracking number for a month
- 13S Micro BMS for charging/balance only
- Photon Remote @Wajdi

So now just waiting on
- Gummies & Superstars from @trampa
- enclosure from @Eboosted
- @SORRENTINO to finish the motor mount design
- Me to finish building the Mini Mill CNC to cut the motor mounts

That is extremely flexy, you need a dual enclosure or a segmented enclosure like this one in order to allow the flex of the board.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/68cnInR.jpg[/img]

However if you make segments you won't be able to run 13S as you will need more space between the packs to allow compresion/expansion.

On a segmented enclosure you need 53cm to run 12S
Each segment has an approximate length of 8.85cm
For 13S you will need 7 segments of 8.3cm that's a total of 61.84cm just for cells and BMS
You will need an 8th segment to fit two VESCs
You will need a 9th segment for switch, receiver and charger.
An 9 segment enclosure should be aprox 80cm

Well...don't think a segmented enclosure would work if it's that long. 

What about 

4s4p  in 3 rows for 12s and the 13th S in the nose under the BMS...where a normal full size BMS would go.

Vanguard style...but this extends to the center further then the first option

The second option is much better, it wouldn't matter if it extends more as long as the clamping points remain at the center allowing the rear part of the enclosure to stay straight and keeping the battery pack safe during deck flexion.

Keep in mind that flex decks are a challenge to work with, you need be extra careful as fire hazards are more probable to happen.

The side to side camber of the board flattens during flexation. Make sense as the two "halves" can flex independently with silicon wire connecting them. Vs Nickel making a solid block across like the first.. I didn't think about it til he said it and I remembered building the vanguard.

The Icarus is shorter then the vanguard so there is gonna be more flex closer to the trucks which in turn would be above the packs... The vanguards flexation is more towards the middle of the board.

@Eboosted correct me if I'm wrong

Yeah, if you mount the cells vertically you will need to connect them with bent nickel strips and due constant vibrations/flexions, I'd estimate 30000 per day they will brake in the first week no matter what, that would be the optimist option, the negative, most likely to happen option, would be a short between the positive and negative leads, take note that they will be touching each other hitting constantly, they will definitely cause erosion, a short and cought fire.

No it doesn't 3/4" gap on the camber is not fitting "well" 

The entire reason I purchased a board for Alan is because gaps like that is asking for issues and road junk to work it's way into your enclosures. A dedicated form fitting enclosure is need if you plan to have any longevity of parts and minimize maintenance over time.

Hey man...

I didn't read your thread. But I also had the Vanguard enclosures in hand for a friend's Vanguard build and put them on the Icarus myself.

Sanding them would not leave enough room as the center has a 3mm variance with cells only to account for heat shrink ect on the pack. Sanding would make the pack not fit. As well the gaps...the gaps

So, I've been meaning to try out new firmware

But basically Metr + AckESC-Tool 3.100 = wireless setup

I flashed two of my focboxes with 3.100, then setup UART and CanBus ID/Send status only.

The results - being able to completely configure escs wirelessly including motor detection.

Perimetr has pretty much all the settings. Including motor detection.

Metr has modes, mappable logs, wireless pass through to PC VeSC Tool. Android Wear and apple watch support. He also added the ability to add together telemetry from all the vescs found on canbus to be displayed on dashboards. Check out the metr.at thread.. :)

I have one metr.at module on the slave. 
-for vesc tool tcp pass through, just set can fwd and the ID as normal and you can configure both independently provided you have already setup Can ID's and send status
-for the modes, it auto detects all vescs on the canbus string and will apply the "mode" to all escs

Couldn't use/don't need to use two...as my master has a photon remote plugged into uart ;)

Yep

Was using metr, photon and ack 2.54 before - so Perimetr didn't work for acks firmware, modes didn't work in metr, but they did in acks app...like metr better...having to disconnect and switch apps was a pita

But now with ack 3.100, metr and photon. Perimetr works on all 3.xx firmware with the metr module, and metr has wireless configuration from PC. Modes also work now.

I just realized I may not need the backing plates...

I'll test fit them when I receive them as I'd prefer not to sink the hardware washers into the board...but for now this works for mock up purposes..the washers on the bottom will be a backing plate instead. Before the nose guard and nut

Hey there, thanks! The backing plates are for when you run drop through, normally the trucks are above the deck and the deck hangs below, so all your and the decks weight rests on the nuts. The backing plates allow you to "sandwich" the deck in metal to give it more meat/surface area so over time the mounting holes/drop through cutt out doesn't break.

As far as a plate for the top when top mounting the trucks on a drop through board.... probably a 3d print or hand cut plate would do the truck

So been thinking about how to install lights on this build. I've gone ahead and made the front mount. Used the heads off of some zoomable XML t6 flashlights that are pressed into tpu mounts and will be wired in series to a meanwell ldd-1000h along with tail lights once I figure them out.

Figured I'd add how I made them here. 

Start off with a couple XML T6 Tactical Zoomable flashlights, with the heads removed.  These are 3d printed TPU mounts I made slightly smaller then the heads measurements then heated and pressed in.

![IMG_20180114_115149|666x500](upload://zmwn4rZZgw3SJDOQn2hdEhzN3od.jpg)

Drill pilot holes through the TPU mounts into the aluminum heads, secure with a lock washer and screws. The TPU will act like a shock pad does for trucks and allow the mount to flex and keep the hardware tight.

So been working with my buddy @SORRENTINO. Still prototyping with HDPE. But we've got the SurfRodz sleeve nailed down and square and within 0.005 tolerance.  Now to start on a few versions of the plate, and make the axle press.

The goal is to utilize no set screws or drilling of the precision trucks.... Gonna be making the 'key' next  essentially the key will be a bearing spacer with a body to press the mount onto the taper off the truck creating a "pressed fit", with access to the axle set screws. So literally no alignment, slap it on, screw in the axle, set the axle set screws and your done.

Hey @Cobber ! 

Yep all my boards have precision cups(Brand: Atopic - due to the inner sleeve that keeps the washer in place, no other precision cups has this..just top hats from other brands). I run them front and rear.

PS the grit all over is because I pack everything with wax for silence 👾
![IMG_20180122_195701|374x499](upload://b3XBXR1UMjfskPen0AmfBbHVC8o.jpg)

I've been on and off riding these surfrodz when they're not being used for prototyping. Threw some 74mm blood orange 82a Morgan pros on them for a little freeride. Trucks feel like heaven compared to anything else I've tried(I've tried Ronin and caliber precisions). The flipable hanger to adjust the rake is awesome as the calibers and ronin's didn't have this, or the axle options. Either way I have two sets of 176mm with 50mm axles on the way for my analog boards, and another set of 200s on the way for the Evo. I really really like how they respond. :D

cool, I have a couple sets of aera's (k4 & k5). I put some atopic sleeved flat washers on my k4's (50/50) roadside (93a boardside, 90a roadside barrels. Symmetrical setup I kick around town on a rayne reaper). 
I was talking to michi about bushing setups he was using and he kept telling me I was going to ruin my trucks? or the kingpins at least?
aera king pins are only $2.50... but so far have been fine. Have you noticed much wear?

the precision cnc machined washer sleeve does not have much play to the kingpin (that is the point of using them). Michi felt it would be too tight on a precision truck with all round machined tollerances and it would wear a groove in the kingpin and then the trucks would not perform...

Ahh, well that could only really happen if the washer is harder than the kingpin..I don't think that's the case
If anything the washer should wear

I haven't noticed much wear or ever even broken a kingpin...I ran these on some caliber2s and Paris as well over a year. Still tight around the kingpins. 

It's good practice to replace the kingpins once a year anyway.. but I love the restriction these cups give compared to regular or other precision cups, as I can run super soft bushings and have zero slop and throw the board out. 

I understand the concern as it puts more pressure on the kingpin..but so do spherical bearings for the hangar hole..

![IMG_20180122_202229|374x499](upload://mvzlhE8ruEIrNwIbKdUva3uv1pX.jpg)

But I do see a slight amount of "compression wear" on the bushings when removed from the cups(a short ring that was pressed into the cup)...but that is normal and hasn't really affected bushings life as I only tightened my kingpins to the point I can barely spin the boardside bushings with my fingers.

no you have hardened steel v aluminium...
the steel polishes up where the sleeve moves but that is it for me thus far & I commute every day on that deck.

Kingpins are hardened steel

These washers are 916 stainless. So they are softer... But neither have polished any of my previous kingpins or grooved. And the stainless hasn't deformed.

Yea..

Ever seen a garlic cleaner... It's a rubber thingy you put garlic in and roll it and it cleans the peels off for you..

I just slide the bushing in and grab it

If the washer is off the kingpin I just pry the washer off while holding it in that thing with my nails

Halfway on the kingpin pop it off like you'd use the axle to pop out bearings without one of these

Anyway...
Since this is the super cruiser..time to start fiberglassing the foot stops for more riding pleasure.

So tiny update.

@Eboosted is putting the touches of epicness on the enclosures

Got aluminum on the way. So hopefully will have the motor mounts cut soon.

I've cut out wooden pieces of the bases of the foot stops, and will be making the MDF circles this weekend so I can start fiberglassing. Once I'm done these kicker speaker pods/foot stops will be painted black and using some spray on poly and glass frit to make them "look" like they are "gripped" and keep the top of the board blending together.

I also got a message from Ted @trampa letting me know the gummies are delayed a bit. Hopefully they resolve the issue soon. But for now, I have time to wait as I have lots to do on this build before it even hits the road. I've gone ahead and requested if they would send the superstars and other items in the order while waiting for the gummies to finish mocking things up.

Hoping I can get more traction on this build and the remaining pieces soon as I'm itching to ride this super cruiser...

Flexy, precision trucks, head and taillights, and a 2.1 sound system, on gummies... My dreams of an "ultimate"  cruiser are so close...and just out of reach for a bit more time.

No idea... I feel like the board would eat the sound.

These speakers together can do 60w rms/ 100w max all together. And the rear enclosure is about 8in³ sealed  to tune the sub at ~56hz and the front 12in³ ported for the full range... it's pretty loud.

I feel like a vibe speaker wouldn't be loud enough except when your not moving or going slow..

So looks like plans are changing. After a few months of waiting. I've received yet another email from @Trampa that there is no definitive end date to the production of the gummies. This is really disappointing as I've purchased NoWind's pulleys in advance, ($105), as well as my gummies/superstar order being $294. 

Trampa stopped using paypal, and no longer has the funds in paypal to refund me, so I'm not even sure how or when I'll get a refund at this point.

So looking like $400 wasted on a dream and down the tube. Looks like I may end up having to pick up another set of 107's and Metroboard Pulleys for this build(shell out another $260 for wheels and pulleys), if I want to complete this in a realistic time frame.  

blah....

Gummies have almost as much thane as 107s @LukePL. Half of it is inside the bead of the hub. When they are installed the two halves of the hub supposedly compress them into place.

I don't mind participating in pre-orders. As long as communication is kept open. Which it was throughout the entire process. I've had good experiences with alot of pre-orders in many hobbies.

It's the ending that sucks. When your offered a refund due to delays. But then after you start the process of cancellation it goes off the deep end. It's disappointing.

I won't necessarily say "No to all pre-orders" as good things do come from them. Just all angles of these processes need to be smooth.

This thread died a while ago due to some setbacks. But

@psychotiller now offers press on surfrodz mounts
@trampa actually has gummies in stock

Since this build has been on hold, basically since December,  because I'm picky and really kind of want what I want I've waited patiently and things have come to fruition.

Few changes
- 10s4p as to make room in the enclosure for the BMS and Audio Amplifier
- SurfRodz colors, I'll be selling the single Purple and Green 200mm, as I stole the other half of the set for the Evo, and picking up raw baseplate and red hangars
- superstars will be white with red text and red spokes.

The Icarus and Potato are both running 10S, as well as the E-Bike I am building for my wife. While I don't need another 10S charger in the house, I did need some more BMS. And to follow my other builds, I've moved away from full-size/large BMS's

All my builds are sporting Micro Charge only BMS's. So for anyone looking for a super-light, and super small 10s BMS:

So it's about to feel like Christmas up in here.

In transit
- Acid yellow Pass
- Gear Drive for the Evo
- Rest of the parts for the Trampa
- New set of surfrodz for this build
- And most importantly the Gummies for this build 😍

Last piece I need to order is @psychotiller mounts and possibly 90mm axles depending on the where the pulleys sit. So that's TBD once the gummies and new SurfRodZ show up.

Also thanks to @anorak234 and @Namasaki for updating the OP with the current build specs.

I know y'all probably aren't as excited as I am. But 6 months after having the idea for this build and waiting for parts to be made, and seeing this finally start to come together as a whole is 😍😍😍😎😎😎

The gummies are only 50mm wide.. so 25mm to center of hub. I could probably measure 107s to the center... Either way I've never seen superstars on surfrodz so having some trouble envisioning the spacing without mocking up. Maybe you have relative measurements for your six shooters. But likely it will need 90mm axles I'm guessing.

Soooo I'm sure everyone I curious to see Gummies on surfrodz

Parts used
Trampa 12mm bearings
Trampa gummies
Trampa 10mm scooter bushings
10ID * 12OD * 15mm L bearing spacer ground down to 14.7mm

http://www.trampaboards.com/bearing-conversion-spacers--fits-12mm-bearings-to-10mm-scooter-axles-x-8-p-335.html

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N414RJM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_koZbBbHN2XVSW

Trampa Superstar are designed for trampa trucks - which use a compression ring, and a hard stop on the axle.

On something like a surfrodz this will not work because surfrodz keep the axles in by having a solid contact with torque across bearings and spacers, to tightly bind them to the truck, keeping the axle tight. So a compression ring designed to flex will allow the axle to walk out.

Here is the completed assembly
![IMG_20180524_175534|666x500](upload://n2mIyFo8x3YgmmF2ETW33ctRt79.jpg)

![IMG_20180524_175349|374x499](upload://1kkg3cyiq3OmF90HmrRu4xFQ0mX.jpg)

Cranked down tight with a normal trampa spacer would pinch the races. This ends up being the perfect spacing.

![com-resize (2)|300x169](upload://dOaHbQ8iRigykj1AmEvI0NlH1Zn.gif)

Ps I just mocked this up on the front of the Evo as I'm still waiting on the SurfRodZ for the Icarus. So I haven't tested them yet :P

Nah there will be no wheel bite whatsoever on the Icarus with 200mm Hangars and 90mm - or even 80mm axles if the pulley fit on 80s

I like the Color too. It should look great on red and raw SurfRodZ I'm waiting on.

There's not wheel bite on. The Evo either..which is why you see alot of evos on the forum with psycho six shooters.. gummies are only 5"

You talking about the gummies? They are compression fit. The hub halves do not seat together. There is about 7mm of compression. So tightening the bolts of the hub mates the two halves and locks the urethane in place.

I rode with the gummies up to 40mph on the Evo the other day. They aren't gonna spin off or expand.

Quick trip to anyone that got @psychotiller press in mounts.

These mounts are really nice. I had a tiny basically non-issue sliding them into the axle.  These are power coated so you don't wanna chip it with sandpaper as the chips will spread. Grab a hobby knife and slice it clean away on the axle ring surface.

Hello Everyone. 

It has been a long time. I started this build over a year ago. It has stalled many times. I could feed you guys all the reasons in the world why. But the real answer is results.

I have assembled my fair share of vanguard builds. While the boards ride great. It doesn't matter if it's a DIY or a boosted, the enclosures affect the function of flex. Long story short. I have not pushed to complete the build until I solve flex, in an effort to retain as much character of the deck as possible.

So what does this all mean? Why am I writing this... Well, I have had a lot of time to think, and then even more time to understand ideas working them out. 

In the next few updates that I post to this thread, I will be

- Showing my build methodologies, which you guys have already seen, with a couple new tricks
- Sharing new methods of sealing enclosures
- Sharing a new method of wire management, and enclosure mounting for flex decks
- Exploring Automotive Finishes (Catalyzed Urethane 2K Clear) with polishes and waxes

While I have basically everything for the build, there are a few items I either just ordered, or need to order. Expect less frequent, but large updates. The build is actually on the assembly table, and no longer on the shelf of "let me keep thinking about that".

I'm using Alan's enclosures still, but you are on the right path. Add lids, mount below the deck. Use threaded rubber vibration isolators, which allow the enclosure to move as the deck flexes vs using solid rods/screws.
