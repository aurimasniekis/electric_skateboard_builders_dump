The Ownboard W2 is very attractive except the torque is a little low for my liking.  I am new to building electric skateboard but currently own the evolve Carbon GT.

My goal is to have a long distant flexy board with long range and high torque.  Top speed of 21/22 miles is acceptable.

I was hoping someone can help me.  I was thinking about buying the Ownboard W2 and swapping out the entire motor, trucks, gears, etc.  I think they use 5045 motor.  I would swap out with Caliper truck, torque mount, and 6355 motor, with 97mm Abec and 40T gear.  Does anyone know if I would get more torque?  Will the default ESC still give me sufficient power I need for the bigger motor?

Or I can try to just swap the wheel gear out.  I think they use 36T and I would swap it out for 40T -3M.  Is that even possible?  Would that buy me much torque?

My last option is completely build a DIY from the ground up similar to Foosted board but seems a little daunting.

Any suggestions?

No, youâ€™d be bottle necked by the esc. Better off to start with a fresh diy.
