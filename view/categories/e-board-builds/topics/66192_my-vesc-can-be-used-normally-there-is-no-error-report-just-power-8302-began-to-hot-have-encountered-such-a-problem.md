What kind of vesc do you have? Also, a few pics of your vesc might help identify any possible problems. 

Screenshot of your vesc setting would be helpful too.

What's your board setup and specifications? wheel size, battery configuration, vesc, etc.

How did you test to make sure there was no faults?

Hardware 4.12, firmware 3.73ã€‚PPM or UART can control the motor to turn normally. When the 5V is directly input, the current is 0.12A and there is no short circuit.
