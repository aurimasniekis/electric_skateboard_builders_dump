Been researching and planning on building an electric skateboard since beginning of last year.
Original idea was I wanted something stealth with long range but I slowly got more and more carried away and ended up with this.

I wanted to try document parts and total cost as best I could to help highlight how quickly everything adds up and how expensive building a electric board can be with quality parts.
So I have added almost everything I have purchased for this build not including the price of tools like a spot welder for making the battery or soldering iron.

I have only just gotten everything togethe and not even taken it for a ride and already wanting to change things.  
I got distracted from my original idea of a stealth board that is almost indistinguishable from a regular longboard, 
<del>So have already purchased some Carvon V4 speeddrives to replace the whole back end with.</del>

![JustKiddingNoCarvonForMe|553x500](upload://pOVbPMJoSxc9cbatVmUFhYQhWpQ.png)

[spoiler]Guess not ..[/spoiler]


And want to replace the deck with a [Hyper Beast](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/hyper-beast-36-inch-deck-with-integrated-enclosure-update/42562) deck by @NAF, or any kind of similar style sealed bottom deck for a more regular longboard look if I can find any.

Still have a small details to finish.  I did want to channel the deck and run the motor wires through, but now that I want a new deck and carvons/quality hub motors I'm waiting before I do too much more work in case I change it all.

If you get a new deck, do you plan on selling the never summer reaper? Or keeping it? If so I be gladly willing to purchase it
