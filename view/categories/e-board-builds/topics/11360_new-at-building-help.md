I am trying to make a board that can go about 20mph. I dont have any hills where  I live. I want a starter board nothing to fancy or expensive. I am looking to spend about $300 for everything. I have wheels trucks and a board. I want a decent range one that will get me around a college campus. I weigh about 120. what motor should I get I have a long list but dont understand anything. what esc would go with it and what is the best battery.

Don't waste your 300 bucks... Save a little bit more and build something for at least $600.

The budget is kinda low, manageable but the quality wouldn't be great.

You'll need to find good deal for motor mount....
Buy 260kv or lower Turnigy SK3 motor at hobbyking
Buy 2x 3s 5000mah 20c Lipo battery with ImaxB6 charger and voltage alarm
No need to buy BMS for cheap build while also using lipo
Get cheap RC car remote GT2B from Hobbyking / buy mini remote 40usd from aliexpress (small is handy to carry)
Ofc get some connectors and cables, XT90 12AWG minimum cables from Hobbyking
For esc, try buy VESC, otherwise get those 120A hobbyking ESC

I am not sure if it would fit 300 usd, probably it will cost 400 - 600 usd to be more reasonable.
The problem with 300 usd is that, it might be doable, but more for experienced builder.
With 300 usd, if you drained / shorts ur lipo / burn ur esc. You have no board and budget for parts replacement.

If you just need the batteries, esc and motor then just get:
VESC, SK3 192kv, 2x5S 5000mah batteries. That would be about 250$

Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 3548-840kv
[/quote]

840Kv is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much for a esk8

You want 320kv or below

and if you are getting 200Kv or below go with a 10S battery

So go with this

https://electric-skateboard.market/product/esk8-starter-kit-motor-esc-controller/

$152.00 + $44.21 + 44.21= 240.42 US$

VESC from torqueboards or enertion (those are the cheap ones), or ollin if you can spend an extra 50$

with 10S and 192kv, with 16/36 pulley ratio you will get 30mph, with 14/36 you will get 26mph

Well in my opinion the best way to spend excess money is on the battery. Get a custom one from @barajabali, he's well known for the quality of his work. Lithium-ion is wayyyy more stable than lipo and lasts up to 4 times longer. You could get a bms as well if you are a fan of one-plug charging. Other way to spend the extra money is on the esc. FVT works but it not customizable, VESC's are pretty adjustable but have a learning curve. If you go that route, get one from @chaka

y'all got me a little confused with all the information. I did look at ollin from what i have read its good. i am also looking at VESC BLDC Speed Controller from DIY electric skateboard. for one of those i would need a motor which 190kv 6374 but that is on back order. which other motors would go well. and batteries Turnigy 5000mAh 5S 25C Lipo Pack i would get two of those. I checked out chi boards but the website was confusing. how much are those batteries? what is a equivalent to that?

battery

what chinzw said earlier about 16/36 and 14/36 what does that mean and does it still apply? also what is a bms?
```

## \#21 Posted by: chinzw Posted at: 2016-10-18T18:55:44.086Z Reads: 40

```
14/36 is the gearing ratio, you have 1 pulley at the motor shaft (14 or 16 teeth) and a pulley at the wheel (36 teeth).

A bms is a Battery Managment System, it monitors your battery cells, balance charges and protects from over-charge, over-discharge and over-current. Also, its a pretty cool solution for single plug charging, keeps things clean and tidy

Depends on what top speed you want, 14t is 26mph, 16t is 30mph. Torquboatds sells them too, but depending on your wheels you might need a custom 36t one.

As for sparks, it's an XT90S or an anti spark switch, depending on how much you wanna spend.

I think you were asking about the BMS tough lol, get 6s 60a from supower

Edit2: here's a build for 350$: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/340-budget-steel-frame-6s-li-ion-bms-build/11370

If you want to go cheap, use the Anti-Spark XT90S as a loop key, just search the forum for "XT90S loop key". As for the charger, if you're gonna use a BMS then you use a laptop style charger, you can get them from supower.

BMS: http://www.batterysupports.com/22v-24v-6s-60a-6x-36v-lithium-ion-lipo-battery-bms-pcm-pcb-p-478.html
