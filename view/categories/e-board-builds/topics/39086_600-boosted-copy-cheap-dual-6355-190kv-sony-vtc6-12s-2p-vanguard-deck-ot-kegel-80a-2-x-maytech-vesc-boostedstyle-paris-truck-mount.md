Totally true :joy:gonna give up on the aluminum shield, i found this on taobao.com.
costs about 95rmb(14$), look ok but not very cool though.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/3/13ce9aa7412fb699ada6faf65f2085782f9ec918.png" width="690" height="394">

to the untrained eye that would definitely look like a boosted board! you could also definitely 3d print them and add some fiber tape on the inside for reinforcement

I've never get my hands on a real boosted board :cry: not sure if i can make one thats better than the 14$ one, i do have a 3d printer though, the problem is 3D modeling, seems hard to draw the boosted shape, is there any existing stl files ?:scream:

Quick update :grinning: A friend sent me his boosted board for battery fix :laughing:, so i have the opportunity to inspect the real boosted board, and soon i will releasing the 98% accurate 3D model of boosted boards enclosure ,currently still struggling with 3d modeling, the model boosted made was a nightmare for engineer since the model doesn't even have any flat surface! :scream: thats why they look fantastic! Im gonna try and bring u guys the most accurate 3d model. Here is a picture of the latest esc enclosure i created.(took me 5hrs :sob:)<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/e/6e0222241256deb1165e836a9c1f263d0d480665.png" width="592" height="295"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/2/523db28c64c2cabbc8a8ce3b2c9bf0bd8b52f142.png" width="638" height="394"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/0/7001b7f2f6b9d0abd7d38cf4ba4b3c596e6a1b6b.png" width="629" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/2/22f1de0ea390783514080a5b5af7ea7023537135.png" width="690" height="429">

Thanks very much sir!  Looks like it's a 6354 instead of a 6355 (which is fine), but I can't tell if the the the KV and whether these are sensored or not.  Those 6354s might be nice on some calibers!

At the bottom it says they make custom KV (170-260 or something like that) so I'm sure you can write it either in the description or to them by e-mail!

Those prices are crazy cheap. I wish I could read anything on the page beside numbers though.
It seems that they can just build you a custom motor, different size 6374, 6364 and 6354, with custom KV, interesting. Too bad I can't find that in Aliexpress or Banggood.

Yep! mine was customized to 190kv (5$ extra), and hall sensor(1.5$), it is a small company,
basically they have all the parts, once u place an order, they assemble it as u required(shape size pole kv)  and ship it within 1 day, pretty amazing for the price.

What do you think of that motor ? I see the shaft has a flat spot, right ? How much was the shipping ? (sorry for all the questions, I'm just quite interested and I've never seen anyone talk about those motors)

Thanks ! I'll keep that in mind. I'll try to contact them and see if they speak english, it might be easier to order that way.

Exciting update！
got a salvaged boosted board v1 dual for 250$
The original owner lost his remote control in an accident，the battery is working fine，but the esc is most likely fucked up. anyways very happy about the price！for 250$ i got

A boosted board deck（120$）

caliber trucks (50$）

dual motors（60$)

pulley wheels & belt （50$）

original motor mount（ 60$）

A123 12s1p battery with bms and boosted enclosure（150$）

esc enclosure with heat sinks（20$）

4x inheat wheels(50$)

the estimated price is about 560$

what a deal！

So next，try to buy a remote control and ship it back to China，and fix the esc

You have a V1? You can redo the wiring if you don't want to rip off the stock grip tape. You just need to get some grounding braid to replicate what is under the grip tape.
