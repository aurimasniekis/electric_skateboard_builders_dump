Hello :D 

I haven't really put time into thinking of a good name, so Spuderoo(Spud-err-ouu) will have to do. 

Parts list:
* **Deck** - Senderized Spud (@Sender )
* **Battery** - 10s2p Samsung 30q (@hyperIon2 (I believe it was you who built it? :P )  
* **VESCs** - Maytech Super VESCs 50a (@hyperIon1)
* **Motors** - Predator Board Dual Hubs (@Bobby)
* **Enclosure** - Spud Single Stack (@Eboosted)
* **Remote** - Nano-x (@hyperIon1)

I'm writing this up after a 3 or 4 mile cruise, and I can't wait to get back on and keep riding!!!! I love this thing! 

Admittedly, with my clowny-ass feet, the Spud feels a little on the thin side. I think that's just me coming from boards like the Evo, and Kiss of Death, which aren't nearly as concave.

On the upside though, this board is surprisingly powerful for 10a batt max on each vesc, it climbs the hills I need it to, and does so with ease :) 

A final thank you to everyone who helped collaborate on this project, I really do mean it when I say that this wouldn't  have happened without you guys. Thank you.

They are going to be swapped out before summer ends, but I'm still unsure of what I should go with. My battery is pretty much my limiting factor as Hummie hubs require higher amps to be 'fun', and I've been recommended against going with the e-lofty drives because the hanger is quite long, killing my turning radius. 

I guess I'll have to keep an eye out.... or maybe just convert to belt drive :joy:

@Sender that spud looks great, well done.

I'm thinking of putting my aging wowgo  hubs on my spud, are those 90mm you have?
```

Yep! 90mm.

I use riptide tunnel risers, although I don't think you need such a tall riser. A 1/4 inch should be perfectly fine... I can't comment on using the hubs without the risers, so here's a picture so maybe you can make your own assessment.

So clean and compact. Love the carbon/frit top. Since you couldn't think of a more personalized name, imma just call it the 'Lil Spender (Spud+Sender+little+spendy). You can call it that too, if you want. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Glad you like it. I know it's kind of weird, but one of the little joys I get out of all these builds is the fun of finding a unique, personalized name for each of them, since they're all so different. Sometimes people figure out the perfect name and nail it right off the bat, but if not, I'm always happy to help...if I can think of something. Funny thing is that I've never really felt the need to name any other machines in my life, but Esk8s are so special for some reason, that I'm constantly trying to think of the perfect names for all of my boards.

I hate naming things after something that already exists.... I've really got to put some effort into naming my next build :P 

I cant keep the same theme and just call it the Kalyeroo :joy:

Agreed. You can't just add "roo" to the end of every deck name forever. Unless you're Australian, then I guess you don't have a choice right? Australian state law or something? :rofl:

But your build did inspire me to go belt + Carvon dual diagonal on my Spud project, which also inspired a name for it, so, thank you. Don't ask me how my brain made so many different turns to get to that decision. And yes, I know your board has hubs, they look nice and perfect for the purpose, but I just don't have any hubs to use, so on to Plan B. 

Back on topic, how do those hubs ride, and how does that Enertion front truck/wheels feel? Does it ride better than regular non-"precision" trucks?

Hey, sorry to like your post and then ghost... Lol

Just got back from work. 

I think the hubs ride pretty decently. I oofied and owied when I went over some bumps only previously traversed by my 107s, but that's to be expected. Speed and torque wise, I actually found on my way up the hill to my work that the 10a I set them to is probably just above the average current I need to get up the hill, so I'll likely bump it to 12a each and be a happy camper.

I really don't have a lot of experience with trucks. Previously I've only ridden caliber 2 50s and Paris clones on my push longboard

If I had to comment on these trucks, they're 'ok but not amazing' - the exact same way I would explain Caliber 2 50s.

It's 1030pm where I am right now and the only light in my room is a tad yellow, so I don't think I can really do it justice right now

That being said, I'll post some pics I just took with and without flash, and post some more for you tomorrow :)

on a side note(hehehe), my Note 8 has an uncharacteristically BAD camera. I think its been fucked up from the box... lol

Maybe one day Ill take out my DSLR and do a photo shoot with both boards when theyre done :joy:

Alright guys, I would really like advice on what to do for this.

I noticed when I was assembling the board that this wire on my BMS isnt all that soldered on. The right wire. 

 pic >

 ![20190516_190340|690x335](upload://3sn1sOw58YqbfJgSPcMYQBU8ipt.jpeg) 

Should I slice the shrink wrap a little and solder it again? What techniques are available for this kind of situation? I can solder decently well, I just dont know if theres a 'best' way to attack this.

Secondly, When opening my board after about 8 miles ( I want to bump the vescs up to 12a each), I noticed some paint on the balance wire spots within the pack... Its certainly not burnt, the black paint has just rubbed off. 

pic >

![20190516_190204|243x500](upload://usVFLimQqH5sxYJuAtOLkR6BV7Q.jpeg) 

Should I add a little foam on these points specifically? Currently everything is padded besides the battery, I couldnt get a good enclosure fit with the whole thing foamed. 

Looking for input, advice, anecdotes. 

Ill be xposting this to the noob thread as well :P

Nice bulld man!
Why changing the hubs? They can handle much more than 10A :smile:

I think your 10S2P is the only thing which is limiting you max battery amps? 

I have a simular build but I used the ownboard hubs and their esc and I made a 10S2P 40T pack (esc puts out 22A battery current) but It's enough for my little Tayto deck.
It's the perfect commuter board for me.

The battery defo is the limiting factor, but for a little campus cruiser / job commuter its perfect :+1:

I call it my fatty weave, but that was just a joke spawned from a shitty hair day

no clue what the real name is :joy: 

Its definitely a mixture of light greens and greenish whites, I think it looks better this way, compared to a solid colour. It gives it depth

It is spring green glass frit, but some are lighter and darker than others.

It is a wide tow CF.  It was a real bitch to work with, but has a really cool look IMO

[/quote]

If its charge only and not many amps are going through here, I think it is actually fine. It only bothers me that its not straight with the edge of the pcb, so some force could be put on the wire from the side. You could redo it to make it look neater but I think it will do the job as is.

Def put foam across the whole thing. Those spots will quickly wear through from micro vibrations. Its like an orbital sander in there.

Thank you! I was worried my cry for help would be buried :joy: 

I cant fit the foam I used for the rest of the board over the battery, do you have any recommended thin foam? If not I suppose I can just try my best to cut it in half

Went for a ride to CVS to get snacks... and my heelside VESC isnt spinning my motor or connecting to the VESC tool >:(((((

I cant imagine what did it in, as it was working before I set it down, and just wasnt working as soon as I turned it back on again after I left. 

Blue light still turns on.... >:((((( 

E: I smacked it and it works again, for both the motor and VESC tool

what a world.

Im so serious though, I thought it was broken D:

But really, what could have caused that? It powered on, but refused to spin the motor or connect via USB 🤔 

I just hope it doesn't happen again, or I'll have to buy more escs x_x

Would you recommend a wider hanger that comes with direct-drive on the Spud? I've been recommended against it but I feel like that's one of the easiest upgrade paths as I wouldn't need to change my vesc settings

E; wait sorry I thought that the carbon build you had was on a Spud / tayto

IMO no, because the dd hangers can be pretty long and the spud is only 9.5 inches wide so there will be quite some protrusion of the wheels from under the deck. the 200mm surfrodz hanger I chose to match my dd's is already a bit long for my taste on the 9.75" wide deck I have.

Up to you though, there's not a problem with long hangers, just have to watch out for kicking them if you're pushing. It's more of an aesthetic thing but it does change the truck geometry slightly. You can compensate with bushings.

For anyone interested in how this board performs, this is my route to hit up CVS for snacks. 

![distancespuderoo%20(2)|690x376](upload://rPcFVlu7k86AFlXMWqCU6iMd3Ko.jpeg) 

I used the blemish tool on the street names, idk. Call me paranoid :joy: 


In total its about 6 miles, and drained my battery from 4.12v to 3.74v. 

Motor max: 30a\
Motor min: -30a\
Batt Max: 12a \
Batt min: -4a

I could probably get better mileage but I dont want to go slower on main roads, and my average speed was around 18mph
