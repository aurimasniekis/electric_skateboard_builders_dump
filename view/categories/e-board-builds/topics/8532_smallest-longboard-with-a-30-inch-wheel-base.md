Looking for the smallest board with a 30 inch wheel base not sure where to look I have taken a look at the manufactures I know such as Arbor, and Loaded. Let me know if there is something out there that is relatively light and has a 30 inch wheel base thanks.

Try jet longboards. I have their jet spud and it has 24" wheelbase and 29" long.
