I finally decided on my components. Thanks @Der6FingerJo, @rich, @AndyBigD and everyone else for help! Starting my "Velcro Board" build page. First, why Velcro Board? I want to build an electric eMTB that can be easily converted to normal MTB, so that I can use the motor for getting to kiting spots, remove the motor/battery/ESC and use the MTB for kiting. More about that [here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mtb-with-easy-to-add-remove-motor/49317). It will be something that's easy to put together and take apart again, same as velcro. Plus, I think the build will rely on actual velcro heavily. :slight_smile:   And I kinda like the name. So Velcro Board it is... or it will be... I hope.

To do the conversion, the plan is to have two hangers and two pairs of wheels -- motorized and normal -- and swap them.

I will keep this page updated as I progress in my build.

For now, here's the list of components and expected budget:
- MBS Core 94 (already have it; used one for ~280 EUR)
- Extra set of MBS ATS 12 trucks with MBS wheels (80 EUR)
- [Idea MBS ATS 12 mount](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/motormounts-kits-for-trampa-e-mtb/15502) for 1 motor (176 EUR)
- [Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 - 6374-149KV Brushless Outrunner Motor](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-aerodrive-sk3-6374-149kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html) (62 EUR)
- 4x [ZIPPY Flightmax 8000mAh 3S1P 30C Lipo Pack with XT90](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-8000mah-3s1p-30c-lipo-pack-xt90.html) (125 EUR)
- [ESCape](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/hw6-4-based-esc-escape/37579) (~172 EUR)
- [HobbyKing HK-GT2B 3CH 2.4GHz Transmitter and Receiver](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingr-tmhk-gt2b-3ch-2-4ghz-transmitter-and-receiver-w-rechargable-li-ion-battery-1.html) (20 EUR)
- 2x [IMAX B6 DC Charger 5A 50W (Copy)](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/imax-b6-dc-charger-5a-50w-copy.html) (31 EUR)
- Power supply for the chargers (~15-20 EUR)
- Various small parts, wires, connectors, etc (~25 EUR)
- Shipping (~40 EUR)

Total: ~1000 EUR

Looks nice! Be sure to use really broad pieces of velcro. I use 100mm Velcro strips for my Batteries and they work beautifully.

Seems like a solid list!
So are you going to fit the twin motor mounts but only fit one motor? See no reason why not!
And are you planning on getting the 62T or 70T Wheel Pulley for that mount?
Only reason I ask is that with 168kV, might be geared too high with the 62T, 70T seems about right...
```

Thanks! Yes, only a single motor on the twin motor mount for now. I might add second motor later though.

For MBS, @idea currently only makes 72T. That makes for 4.8:1 gear ratio with 15T motor pulley. It should be capable of doing [~50 km/h](http://calc.esk8.it/#{"batt-type-lipo":1,"batt-cells":12,"motor-kv":168,"system-efficiency":85,"motor-pulley-teeth":15,"wheel-pulley-teeth":72,"wheel-size":200}|), which seems a bit scary. Wouldn't 149kV actually be a better option?

Ahh, 72T is it. Could still potentially be a bit on the high gearing side, especially if there's only one motor.
Top speed around 45 - 50 km/h;
![image|690x385](upload://gXGayDcF0j0n41iQodeIPb0MyM2.png)

149kV might get you a bit more torque for running with only 1 motor, speed drops to around 40 - 45 km/h;
![image|690x385](upload://cBklRtda5quQDXgOxUFtrkfl5dn.png)

Range should be a respectable 20km with 8Ah

I'm a fan of not speccing you board for speeds you wouldn't want to reach anyways, so i think this is good. Makes it a bit more efficient too.

k, I'll go deeper into the subject. I'm afraid of buying a velcro type that is too strong and will simply rip the adhesive part off. This has happened with the stuff I got that was supposed to be ''industry strength.'' Since there a multitude of brands, it would be good to know what has specifically worked for you.

I'd agree with this. Go 149kV for now, give you more efficiency and more power for the speeds you'll want to start out at.
If you to move to 2 motors, and are happy with the speed but want even more power you can get a 2nd 149kV. If after some riding you decide you do actually want more speed, then get a pair of 168kVs...

40 km/h is more than enough for me. OK, going with the 149kV instead. Order submitted. Thanks!

Nice! Don't forget to file a flat spot on the shaft for the grub screw of the pulley.
I have 150kv and 1:5 gearing and that's totally fine. Usually I ride between 25-40 km/h, sometimes above 40 km/h but then I'm scared to fall and don't feel comfortable. IMO It's better to have some torque instead of crazy top speed :sunglasses:

If you use your 2 chargers at the same time don't forget to unplug the serial connection of the 2x 6s Lipo packs (2x 2x3s packs) otherwise you will kill one charger, both chargers, or the lipos :wink:

Had a mistake in my range calculator (I had input of Wh/miles but was putting in values for Wh/km).
With that corrected you are probably looking at a range of around 15km with an 8Ah battery.
Obviously the range calculator is heavily based on assumptions;
Energy Usage is just an estimate, and Useable Pack Energy assumes you can only really get upto 75% of the Energy out of the pack. (i.e. you'd be putting around 6000 mAh back into your pack when charging, probably a fair estimate).
![image|427x178](upload://A9M1eZredq9DEv5PqBDwDHThBHM.png)

If you genuinely need 17km, you might be able to achieve it with efficient riding, but you may need a higher Ah...

Hm, I didn't realize I couldn't use 100% of the energy in the battery pack. OK, it will probably be tight. We'll see. I have already placed my order. I could maybe make an extension battery pack (with less mAh) to carry along in a backpack and swap the batteries.

I still hope the 20 Wh/km is for off-road while I'll mostly be doing on-road with not many hills, so I'll be able to do better than 20 Wh/km. Anyway, I will test it before worrying about getting more power.

There's two spots I usually go to. One is about 7 km far and the other about 8 km. I may need to stop using the latter. :smile:

Don't worry about range.
With my 12s 8Ah lipo i have a range of about 20km.
When I ride like here in the video it's about 18km, my record with such a pack was 23km :grin:

EDIT: forgot to mention that I discharge from 4.2V to 3.5V per cell to get that range

When you discharge Lipos slower than in a FPV Copter it's safe to go with a lower end voltage. A friend once killed my new 1300 5S Graphenes by discharging them to a half empty 3S battery during  150A punch outs :rofl:

I discharge my board lipos to 3,7V if i can, but if i need a bit of range at the end to go home i have no problem with 3.5V/cell.

That's terrible. I park next to Tesco every now and then. Never had a problem. Must have been very bad luck or your license plate. People here tend to be rather xenophobic.

Yeah, I go to Nové Mlýny often for windsurfing. I have heard that Neusiedler See is much better for kiting though. I believe that one is your area... or used to be. Never been there, but I'm definitely going to give it a try this summer.

We should do eMTB meet up. We live so close that we could almost make it to the meeting point on boards... with a few battery pack upgrades... and using kites for most of the way. :smile:

It would be great but there are only 2-3 spots where it is allowed to start. And you have to wear a t-shirt with a number (beginners in pink) :joy: On the weekend there are thousands of kiters, that kills the fun for me.

I have 2 Kites (5m² soft and 9m² tube)  but never tried it in water, only on land. Instead of buying full kite equipment I decided to go with e-mtb which I can use night and day instead of very seldom. Glad that you found some spots for landkiting.

For sure, the middle point is 70 km away. I need 2 more batteries, then no problem. But what do we do on meeting point with a bunch of empty batteries? :rofl:

It's actually a perfect size. It's 100x200x75 mm. The ZIPOs I'm getting are 24x167x69mm, so that's 96x167x69 mm for four stacked along the shortest side = perfect match. :smiley: Unfortunately, there's no space left for a VESC. :frowning:

Made a battery box! It's probably a 30 minutes project for most people with the skills. Well, I'm an IT guy. I have never really built anything. I have helped my kids with lego a few times, but that's about it. So, it took me about a week. It's as bad as it can be. There are no two pieces that align well. The paint is uneven. There are some extra holes where I drilled at wrong places. And I think I made it higher than necessary. But, it's a battery box! :smile:

Maybe you could add some foam to the sides of the box to dampen any vibrations the lipos might be subjected to?

Don't worry, you can redo it later if you want. As @Der6FingerJo mentioned I would add neoprene or foam to secure the batteries. Also add a gasket between the 2 parts of the box otherwise it will rattle and debris and moisture can enter. And maybe you find some edge protectors because it could really hurt if your leg touches an edge when falling.
```

Thanks for the tips guys. The batteries are a pretty tight fit, but I'll try to squeeze in a little bit of foam.

A gasket sounds like a very good idea.

I also found these very safe looking edge protectors: https://goo.gl/images/SkwHTd :smile:

BTW, the box is meant for both batteries and VESC. The VESC will go under the batteries. On the last picture, there's about 2.5 cm of space under the batteries. The space at the sides is for battery-VESC cables. The batteries won't sit directly on the VESC. There will be some space between them. I hope that helps to reduce heat, though I'm not really sure it will make a difference.

I suggest doing it the other way around, Vescs on top. It´s better to access and you don´t have to worry about batteries damaging them over time from vibrations. Also like you mentioned better heat dissipation. 
If you want your wires to exit at the bottom, simply route them down at the sides.

XT150 connectors soldered on! First time soldering. The first connector took me like 2 hours. I just wasn't able to attach the cable to the connector quickly enough. Then, once I finally managed to make a solid connection, I realized I forgot to put the plastic housing on the cable first. :sob:

Nevertheless, by the sixth connector, I can do it all in a blink of eye! I mean, a slow blink... like 10 minutes or so. :slight_smile: 

I'm still not sure whether I should put XT150 on the last two cables. I have purchased some AS150 as well. I'm thinking about using those instead and connect to VESC directly. Is that a bad idea?

For charging, I have two iMAX B6 chargers and I plan to break the 4x 3S to 2x 2x 3S for charging. I could then either use the alligator connectors to connect to the charger (they came with the charger) or make charging cables with one AS150 male, one XT150 female for one battery pair and one AS150 female and one XT150 male for the other pair. Given my excellent soldering skills, that shouldn't take more than full afternoon. :slight_smile:

So I got this great idea to attach the velcro to the board with glue only because "I won't drill into my nice and shiny board". As a test, I glued some velcro to a piece of plywood first. It held on fine. How different can it be with a board, right?

It only took a single test to find out. Now my shiny board looks like this:

![IMG_1078|375x500](upload://zboN5T4xl3AMYnHWpnQGu1tRiW7.JPG)

... which is clearly much better than having a few tiny holes in it.

That sucks :weary:!

Use a black edding and try to forget it
Your velcro seems very weak and is not even self-adhesive. No way that could work with this tiny stripes even with perfect velcro. Also the paint on your deck is a problem. Furthermore I think your enclosure will come apart after some rides because of the structure ( wood screws only).

If you don't care about how it looks I have some suggestions.
Take some black gaffer tape and wrap it around your box that will hold it together and it won't come apart, maybe it wiggles a bit one day but no battery or vesc is leaving the box (that happened with my very first box :laughing:).

Because you want to take the box off for kiting I think the easiest and safer way would be to use 2 straps and some high density foam (or camping mat) between deck and box. There are also velcro straps available, the one in the pic would be too small but just to get an idea what I'm talking about.

The velcro strips on the board are only to prevent moving the box from side to side. In addition to that I'm using two straps that go around the box and the board (probably similar to what you're suggesting). That seems to keep it in place really well. Will post some pics later.

The box is glued together. The screws are only to reinforce the joins. It seems pretty sturdy. Plus, I'm not going to abuse my board the way you do. :wink: Still, wrapping some tape around just in case sounds a good idea. It's not that I don't care about how the box looks but I think it can hardly get much worse. The tape might actually improve the looks. :grinning:

The velcro strips on the board are only to prevent moving the box from side to side. In addition to that I’m using two straps that go around the box and the board

Ah alright. Maybe you can use an antislip mat between box and deck (additional or instead of foam). Also good that you glued the box, too.

When my electronics left the box it happened because a friend tried it the first and last time. I couldn't know that he goes full throttle instead of braking and crush into a concrete wall :laughing: For such cases it's good to have a sturdy box.

As promised, here's some pictures of my super sophisticated velcro mounting system. :laughing: 

Here's how the box looks on the board. It's sooo bulky and awkwardly shaped. This is my v1. Will need to at least trim the height or (more likely) redo it completely.

![IMG_1079|690x299](upload://bRQHS65APXGqfvKe6LYzEbWfmVm.jpg)

![IMG_1080|690x329](upload://kCly0tobEAVy2mjPOP8YiIxAi8E.jpg)

I have two velcro straps on the board and on the bottom of the box.

![IMG_1084|304x500](upload://w1jTTygng7oFXr4TuYdEA220vl.jpg)

Two long straps are attached to one side of the box by screws and go under the board and attach to the other side of the box with the velcro adhesive part.

![IMG_1082|350x500](upload://pjzp3OqYL7oKUfQP3kDUMhdmQmH.jpg)

![IMG_1081|373x499](upload://AdLKh3jS3JHbM3koCAe89L96WuF.jpg)

After unmounting the box, I can re-attach the straps to the sides so that they are not in the way. The bottom pieces and the straps that go around are the same velcro... ehm... sex? I mean, they are either both male or both female. Not sure which is which as far as velcro is concerned. The point is, they don't stick to each other, which is a cool feature. That's not a coincidence! :laughing:

![IMG_1085|637x500](upload://Ao0BGrHTrD4kXzTvgC8sb4aCj10.jpg)

Here's also some gasket that I have added as @rich has suggested. It's just some window gasket I found home. Probably won't keep the color for very long. :) BTW, this is with the batteries sitting on the bottom. I think I have space for like 5 more VESCs than I need. :slight_smile: I actually may need to call this "v1 early alpha". :laughing:

BTW, the attachment may look weak. It's just 4 thin pieces of velcro. But it actually feels pretty strong. I tried lifting the board, shaking it side to side, even flip it around. The box wouldn't move at all. Of course, how well it will do on an actual ride may be a different story (especially when hitting concrete walls :laughing:) . Will just need to test it to find out.

Yeah, starting to look good. I think I should be at least be able to do a test ride when the ESCape arrives.

I'm figuring out the phase wires now. I would like to be able easily detach the battery/ESC box from the wires. First, it will make taking things apart easier. Second, I can then leave the MTB in the storage and only take the box to my apartment if I need to charge batteries. I found these [MT60](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/mt60-3-pole-motor-esc-connector-set-12awg-black-male-female-2-set.html) connectors that look perfect for that purpose. 

On the motor side, I'm not sure whether I should put female 4mm banana connectors or solder it on. I don't really need to be able to detach the wires at that side. I haven't been able to find any relevant info on the forum. Any advice, guys? @Der6FingerJo @rich @AndyBigD

Connectors seem a better option to me. I won't need to cut into the wires coming out of the motor. Might be relevant if I ever want to sell off the motor.

I would strongly prefer individual bullets over those mt60 connectors. I used them once on a Longboard build and they were mostly a pain in the ass. way too small, awkward to put together and pull apart and generally not very trustworthy imo. At least with somewhat bigger motor wires.

Hm, OK, in that case I could only use connectors near the motor and if I need to take the box with me, I would take it with some 30 cm of wires, which probably isn't that bad.

My only concern is that I'm going to disconnect/connect frequently and with individual connectors I will need to do 3 connectors instead of 1. Plus, there's a risk of swapping them up. That's why I have considered something like MT60.

I say go for it, I'll be using MT60s on mine. They're just 3x 4mm bullets in one plug so why not? Perfect for what we're trying to do with simple removability of parts.
I plan to cut and solder extensions on my motors that bring the cables to the box, then make my own ports/sockets on the box to connect MT60 & 2x MT30 (sensor cable)  for each motor. My motorised hanger will then just have one long braided cable bundle with 2 sockets to plug directly into the side of the box.

Everything is possible but soldering bigger wires on smaller connectors is no fun.

XT60 and MT60 (=3,5mm bullets) are best to solder up to 14AWG

4mm bullets up to 12AWG

XT90 (=4,5mm bullets) best up to 12AWG (10AWG is also OK)

5,5mm bullets (140A) up to 10AWG

All of us are waiting for MT90 which would be best for esk8, Hobbyking can you hear me?

I found a company making custom MT90 connectors, I would order a connector for 3 phase and 6 sensor wires in one connector, how cool is that? :heart_eyes:

![customMT90|690x412](upload://ze84A5jm7GHi5TlCiYRwjamou54.jpg)

Designing a new battery / ESCape compartment to replace that wooden skyscraper I have built. :laughing: 

This one is the other extreme -- low profile, but taking up the full width between the straps. Not sure how well that will play with the board flexing. My idea is to put a lot of foam at the bottom to allow for some travel as the board flexes.

I'm also not sure whether the lid can actually be 3D printed. I have sent it to a friend who has a 3D printer for considering.

Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Using these is really asking for a short circuit. I'm going to keep as much insulation on the wires as possible and maybe add some heat shrink as well if I can squeeze it in.

The connector has two parts. The other part is plastic only and it has little plastic separators inside, which should keep the wires away from each other, so it's not that bad.

Of course it works! Good old Russian engineering. It's practically indestructible. :laughing:

To be honest, I find it a bit of a miracle that it still works. It must be like 50 years old. Only recently I discovered it has a battery. Of course it must have a battery! How would it measure resistance without a battery. Silly me. Anyway, the battery was of course long dead and leaked. The multimeter still worked though. It doesn't need a battery for measuring voltage. Then I replaced the battery and it can even still measure resistance. Indestructible! :grin:

It didn't flow across the wire, but I believe there was enough between the wire and the metal and it was hot enough. It might have been better to use a bit more of solder. I was worried about using too much. First, things are really tight there, so excess of solder would likely get in the way when putting on the cover. Second, I was afraid that if the solder overflows, it might create a short since the connectors are really close to each other. I'm pretty new to soldering.

The wires hold on really well. The question is if I can get enough amps through. Is there an easy way to measure that?

Done the first test ride! And it worked! Yay!

My ESCape finally arrived today, so a test ride was a must. I was a little worried about configuring the ESC, since I have never used the Vesc Tool before. But it turned out really easy. The hardest part was to overcome the anxiety from connecting the thing with the full load of 12s lipos to my not exactly cheap laptop. And the second hardest part was connecting the RC receiver since I didn't have the right cable. So I had to get a little creative with jumper wires. :slight_smile: 

I also tested my new extra sturdy cardboard battery box and attached it to the board with a very securely looking blue string. :laughing: (It was getting dark and I couldn't find anything better.)

Since I have anticipated I would end up with a setup of that kind, I kept the max motor amps at 40 when configuring the ESC, which turned out a good idea. I still didn't have the balls for doing full throttle.

And it worked! I made it to the end of our street and back (with a few stops for reconnecting the jumper wires :)). And even with all that makeshift stuff, it was already a lot of fun. I can't wait to putting things together properly and doing a longer ride.

I made things a little more properly. Still temporary/testing setup, but already such that I can take it on road without worrying it will fall apart at the first bump. I got a proper JST connector (turned out pretty hard to find in my city) and made a simple lid for the batteries using cardboard and some black tape.

Today I took a longer ride -- about 3 km. Good road only. All worked well. The board gets a little wobbly at higher speeds and more wobbly when braking. For braking, I believe it's the single motor. For high speeds, it might be the trucks. The steering is pretty sensitive. I never noticed that when riding off-road with a kite, but it's all very different on the road without the kite. Also, my back leg hurt as hell. I'm not used to riding in the same direction all the time. :slight_smile: Overall though, I'm very happy with the board so far. It might take some more tweaking and getting used to a different riding style, but it looks very promising. I think it will be perfect for my kite spot commutes.

Oh, BTW, starts are very smooth. I don't have a sensored motor so I was worried about starts being too rough, but with ESCape in FOC mode it's not a problem at all. It starts very smoothly even if I go full throttle straight away.

I have done a 10 km ride today to get a rough idea of the range. The voltage in individual cells dropped from 4.2 V to ~3.9 V, which should be ~60% of the total capacity. It was on a good road, almost no hills and I drove very slowly. Still it looks like the 16 km I need to be able to cover for my commutes will be doable.

Today I went to my favourite kiting spot to see if I can make it there and back. I made it there:

![DSC01438|690x460](upload://iaGWcElXEI5tZUCkizVrnXDf01f.jpg)

I wasn't sure if I'll make it back as well. The cells were around 3.8 V, so it looked promising. On the other hand, I took a shortcut through a cucumber field on the way there, which started as a lot of fun... but then the path got narrower and narrower. Near the end, it was just wide enough to make it through with very precise driving, which I wasn't quite able to do and I kept hitting the plants. At that point I accepted the defeat and pushed the board for the last ~100 meters, which wasn't that much fun anymore... So I decided to go around on the way back, which would be some extra distance.

Nevertheless, I did make it home and still with ~3.7 V in the cells. Total distance 19.7 km. Here's the route:
https://en.mapy.cz/s/2MnWU

BTW, as you might have noticed, my board went through another evolution step. I put the ESCape into the same compartment as the batteries. Here's a few more pics:

![DSC01442|690x460](upload://8kY6M8ZKZC2Y0IOJhL6tIQfumtB.jpg)

![DSC01439|690x318](upload://dBNh0fgrJdb243hsohWMjivFy0k.jpg)

Here's how things look inside:

![DSC01443|690x460](upload://iSJBZGAu0apKfpXJHFCqqUcIq2P.jpg)

At last, I didn't use the the MT60 connector for motor wires. It's actually pretty hard to disconnect. I just used 3 bullet connectors instead that I labeled with a piece of yellow and green tape. I figured they are easier to deal with than the MT60.

And here's the board with the electronics removed. This is very easy to do. Just remove the two straps and carefully lift the box, which is held by two pieces of velcro at the bottom.

![DSC01444|690x460](upload://pfhoAA0tin8b2ptr7keVbONlq5g.jpg)

Now it's just a matter of swapping the motorized trucks for an extra pair of unmotorized (that I don't have yet) and the board is ready for kiting!

One other small upgrade I have done is a small window in the lid to see the battery voltage indicator and the LEDs on the ESCape and the receiver... In fact, I made it big enough for the whole ESCape to be seen since it looks really cool and I didn't want to hide it. :slight_smile:

![DSC01446|690x460](upload://bifoSzbjzr3qpObw7CXGopWTGI2.jpg)

So that's it. I think I'll replace the cardboard with something more water resistant at some point, but the build seems good enough to be used in a good weather already. Time to order another pair of trucks and wheels! :grinning:

Looks good dude! Very neat and tidy.
I've decided to bail on using the MT60 motor connectors too, just going to have a long lead hardwired into my central box and keep the standard connectors at the motor end.
So you got 20km on 8000mAh? seems pretty good going!

I have considered that as an option as well. One thing I didn't like about that setup though is that I wouldn't be able to seal the connectors (easily) and I was worried about a short should I get caught by rain and the connectors would get wet. There's a little bit of metal poking out of the insulation on my motor connectors. I guess I could just fix that, but having the connectors inside the battery box seemed a better option.

I suppose in your case the cable will go through a hole drilled in the box so connectors inside the box wouldn't work.

Yeah. That's better than expected. On the other hand, I thought I had some padding with the 3.7 V left in the cells, but after some googling now, that's actually pretty close to depleted. And that's with new batteries and I was riding pretty slowly. I'll need to find some shortcut that doesn't go through a cucumber field. :laughing:

I decided to test the board max speed today. It turned out to be "more than I can control". Fortunately I did have some protective gear, so I only got some scratches and a dislocated joint on my left thumb. The doctor just put it back. Ouch. Hopefully it's not broken. Still waiting for the x-ray.

I may need to tighten up the hangers for stiffer steering. The board got extremely wobbly at around 40 km/h. I wasn't able to control it. I'm also thinking of getting a full body armor. I had my backbone guard, but nothing on my side, so I have an ugly bruise there. Plus, it hurt quite a bit. :sweat_smile:

Gloves instead of just wrist guards might also be a good idea. On the other hand, ones that would protect fingers against fractures and dislocated joints would have to be really stiff and that wouldn't work with the remote. One glove for left hand only? :slight_smile:

I tried to tighten the kingpin nuts following my recent crash and it made a HUGE difference. The board is nice and stable now. All the wobble is gone. Turning is still fine. Very happy with that change.

I have also played with my ESCape settings. I increased the motor max amps from 55A to 60A and limited the ERPM instead. The rationale is that I don't want to hinder the uphill performance, but I prefer to have some reasonable speed limit. I set the max ERPM to 35k, which I believe should limit the speed to 40 km/h. I haven't tested these settings yet.

AFAIK these ATB skate trucks are not good (stable) at higher speed, I wouldn't exceed 35 km/h. With trampa channel trucks without dampas I get speed wobbles above 39 km/h. With yellow dampas no problems up to 49 km/h (top speed).

On the positive side, it doubles as a wrist guard. :smile:

Those look nice. I have simple inexpensive wrist guards. I mean, apart from the one I'm wearing all the time now. :slight_smile:

They didn't help with the thumb injury, but I'm afraid the Hillbilly gloves wouldn't do any better in this case. I got the thumb tip joint dislocated. That one would be naked even with Hillbillies. I think I just need to get better at falling. :slight_smile: The thing is that I ride goofy, but I'm right handed and thus I hold the controller in my right (=front) hand. That made me instinctively go on my free left hand when falling, but I twisted awkwardly as a result of that. I think that if I went on my right hand and right side and slided that would have been better. I should probably learn to use the controller with my left hand.

I'm also going for an upgrade with my protective gear since I got pretty ugly bruise on my side. I ordered [this one](https://www.absolute-snow.co.uk/V/Demon_Flex_Force_Pro_Body_Armour_Top_M_BlackGreen-(135111)) today.

I feel like I could do a bit more than 35 km/h now after tightening the kingpin, but I'm not going to test that until the top armour arrives and the thumb heals at least a little bit. :smile:

Alright now I understand how it happened. I know it's the instinct to do that when falling but better to have impact on the full forearm (if it is protected), crashpants and back protector. 

Since I have full body protection I try to avoid to take the full impact with my hands/arms because it's not necessary.. Or you can do a fist when falling to avoid any dislocations.

Looks good but I think it's supposed for wearing it underneath clothes. I don't know how it looks after one single crash in summer. You can look for MotoX protector vests. I bought a used  O'Neal with hard plastic shells everywhere, I can shred stones with my back without any damage beside some new grooves. I'm more concerned about the mesh between the protectors :laughing:. But maybe I'm not the average rider because often I ride like I don't care and that leads to falling. I need durable protectors :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

@AndyBigD Wouldn't changing the whole truck actually work better? Here's my thoughts. Sure, it's 4 bolts to deal with and dealing with them is not easy since you need to hold the nut while tightening the bolt. What if you put the bolts upside down though and glued them (or better, welded them) to the trucks. They would then be sticking up from the trucks all the time. You just put the board on and tighten 4 nuts. No need to hold the bolts. It seems to me that would be easy to do. Not sure if it would be faster with my trucks but I bet it would be faster with yours. No hassle with springs. No worries with how tight the kingpin nut should be.

## \#112 Posted by: AndyBigD Posted at: 2018-07-20T10:07:20.185Z Reads: 83

Yeah I had originally been back and forth between both options.
Main reasons against changing the whole truck were as follows;
It's fiddly to deal with the nuts within the Baseplate.
(Welding bolts in can't be done as Baseplate is Aluminium, bolts are Stainless.)
I had thought about modding the Baseplates with pressed in threaded inserts but not that confident on this idea.
I'd need a complete spare truck which is more expensive and heavier than just the hanger.
I have a spare hanger, but I don't have enough parts to run a full spare truck.

Springs are easy to deal with once you know the knack. I regularly change dampas anyway depending on riding locations/conditions, and can complete a change within minutes. Not much effort to then change the hanger. By changing the hanger regularly, it also has the added side-effect of regular inspections of the kingpin bushes.

Such upgrade! Many power!

I was happy with my single motor drive, but then I got stuck in the middle of a hill several times. Once you have to stop, there's no way to get going again with a single motor. Also the off-road performance wasn't great and I constantly had some wobble in the rear truck, which I thought was due to the single drive.

So I decided there's time for an upgrade. And so it happened that Idea had the motor mount on hand and stewii had a few ESCapes left from the last group buy. It only took about a week to get all the parts in. I didn't even have time to get a proper CANBUS connector.

I took the board for the first ride today and it's great! The improvement in the uphill performance is enormous. I tested it on the steepest hill I could find in my surroundings. It must be at least 20% and it's paved with cobblestone. The board made it up like it's nothing. I could even start in the middle going straight up.

Off-road is also great. I took it through high grass. No problem at all, even when going uphill.

Only the wobble in the rear truck didn't go away. In fact, it's even worse now. I think I need to balance my wheels. They are both quite a bit out of balance and that's likely the culprit of the wobble. It would make sense that the second drive made it worse.

The wiring is becoming a bit of a rat's nest. I'll have to do some refactoring at some point:

![DSC01504|690x460](upload://aEYee6tiDZaPG8zFLeGcmbL8gCt.jpg)

The only issue I had is that the motor driven by the slave ESC refused to spin when starting a few times. I attribute it to my CANBUS wiring, which currently isn't, ehm, exactly the most solid one. :smile: 

![DSC01505|690x460](upload://849Lx3md4q7toy6O1rIC2F0FV2N.jpg)

I already ordered the proper connector, but I'm just too impatient.

Overall, the upgrade was definitely worth it! On the other hand, it's also a bit scary. Before, even if I went full throttle when starting, I wouldn't loose balance. There's no way I could do it now. At one point I accidentally pushed the throttle a bit harder than intended and the board rushed forward like a wild horse. I managed to keep the balance but it was close. I definitely need to go easy on the throttle now.

The only thing that yet remains to be seen is how the added power affects the range. I hope I'll still be getting close to 20 km on road. Otherwise I will need to upgrade the battery pack as well, which will be a bit of a challenge. I guess I would need to replace it completely since I can't really see a good way of adding to the four 3S LIPOs. I should have listened to the advice of the more experienced ones and get two 6S LIPOs instead.

Niiiiice, that's proper balanced :grin:

Just 2 hints from own experience, take pictures of your front wheels, too.
After some time you'll loose some of the balance weights and with the help of the pics you know which. Otherwise you have to balance the wheel again.

And if you e.g. change a tube then mount the tire exactly as it was ( you can take the MBS logo as reference). Otherwise it's no more balanced. If you switch tires you probably have to re-balance.

Mainly the imbalance is from

If the tires are balanced (some are, some not) usually 4x5gr weights opposite to the valve do the trick

A few upgrades. I made a new cardbon-fibre :wink: lid for my enclosure and added DAVEga.

The lid is from cardboard again. I just added a self-adhesive carbon foil. It's actually a pretty good material for building a top mounted enclosure. Reasonably sturdy, yet flexible and dampens vibrations. Plus, it's cheap and easy to work with. And doesn't look bad at all. Not sure how well it would work for bottom mounted, but I think it could as long as all components are attached to the deck and the enclosure doesn't carry their weight (which I believe is generally agreed to be a good practice anyway).
