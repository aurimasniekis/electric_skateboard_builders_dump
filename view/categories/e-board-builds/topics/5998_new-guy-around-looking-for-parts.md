Hi Rom, I'm from Israel too. I don't know if it will help you but I have a [build list](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/landyachtz-canyon-arrow-lipo-8s2p-10a-vesc-bms-charging/4299) with prices including shipping to Israel. also, we have a [hebrew facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/esk8Israel/) if you want to join.
I recommend buying some parts from Enertion because they have free shipping above 250$ (and in Israel you have 17% tax above 75$).
