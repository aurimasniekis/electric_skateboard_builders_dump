```
I have not gone out and bought everything. I simply want to know if my set up is going to meet my needs.

That being said I am going to go with a 14/36 pulley set up, A 190 kv motor size 6355.  My wheels are fairly small at 73 mm diameter with spokes so I can mount it . I most likely need to make my randles trucks flat to mount my motor.I have a deck already.

As for batteries I don't know what I should go for. Everyone says just grab some lipo's and stick them on your board.  I am skeptical about the graphine batteries. I don't think there that reliable from a scientific standpoint.

What potentially I would want to do is do half parallel and half in series. This makes things a little more complicated, but I am thinging of doing 6 batteries in series that on one side are connected in parallel. I am aiming for 12 s 
How many batteries do I need for that?
The reason I want to pair parallel and series is I want a fast board, however I also would like a  decent range.
Does this build work and suggestions are welcome.
I want to be able to go 25 miles per hour with a range of 20 miles.

i'll say before someone else does. use search! lol
also  http://calc.esk8.today/

also randles and 73mm wheels will suck.
@psychotiller has the only randal mount that doesnt.
you still want kegels or flywheels.

unless you have a serious workshop, then do whatever...

@thebeast   I would stick to 10s with 190kv motors, with 12s you'll exceed the erpm limit on your vesc (assuming you're going to use a vesc, which you should.)

73mm wheels are pretty small, which will result in a rough ride and lower ground clearance.

With brushless motors, current is torque, not speed. That means that having larger batteries that can supply more power won't give you more top speed, it'll jsut improve your acceleration and ability to climb hills.

Voltage is speed, so for a given motor kv and battery voltage, the only way to change your speed is by changing your gearing (pulleys) or your wheel size.

Assuming you go with a 10s battery, 10000mah should give you around 20 miles of range, and if you use 90mm flywheels or similar with that 14/36 gearing, you'll still get about 25mph. Since 5s 10000mah packs are huge, I'd recommend going with two 5000mah packs in parallel instead. So you'd have 10s2p, for a total of four 5s 5000mah packs.

You won't hit the eRPM limit with 12s and 90kv due in inefficiencies. Pretty much every LHB board runs this setup, and I was personally using 10s @ 230kv on mine.

At 100% efficiency The erpm will be 63500, but you will likely never hit this, unless you go full throttle downhill

I am aware of the Erpm calculation, but like this other guy said only when it is 100% efficient and going down hill will I hit the Erpm limit.

not a single problem (knock on wood) as long as you limit erpm and uncheck "limit erpm with negative torque"

That is the size of the motor. Series is more for torque vs. parallel is more for longevity. Parallel is what tesla's use. Tesla's have around 1 million battery cells which is why they are able to draw so much power.

Ya I think electric long boards are more for short commutes instead of being transportation. Especially since long boards are not recognized as being the same as a bike. A bike is more accepted on roads. While it would be sick to be able to ride your electric long board next to a motor cycle, however I don't think too many people have the leg strength to hang on going 30 Mph.

No, that's wrong. You can have a very high voltage setup, but if it doesn't deliver enough amps, you will have no torque. 

The more voltage you have, the more power you can draw, **IF** you have a battery that will support the current required.

Why do you think there are 8s setups on here hitting 25+mph? They have good gearing and plenty of **current**!

A top of the line Tesla has about 970 ft-lbs of torque at the wheels, because the battery can supply about 1300 amps at full blast.

Don't use series as a capacity Indication. Use Watt hours, do the calculations and use Whr pretty much explicitly when speaking about capacity.

You can make a 6s2p and a 12s1p. Both have same amount of capacity , but according to your logic, the 12s has more capacity? Wrong.

No one has ever said that. I didn't realize I had to a it out for you. Do some reading. 

12s1p has 12 cells, 12 in series and 1 in parelell. 12*1=12

6s2p has 12 cells, 6 in series 2 in parelell. 6*2=12.

Sane amount of cells, same amount of capacity.

Although I hate the word capacity.

1 cell could have more capacity than 28 cells. Capacity is not a measure for energy - Wh is.

A 8s system on a full charge can go faster than a 10s. However, the range, aka how far you can go on your board, is lower on 8s.

Dig into a little about Ohm's law and electrical power and see how current (amps), voltage (volts), power (watts), energy (watt*hours) and charge (amp*hours) are all related.  Then check back

The way the battery is configured does matter, but it's not the **ONLY** thing that matters. You have to look at the whole system. You could build a 12s2p pack, or you could build a 10s4p pack, or this or that. 

Range is measured in miles. Efficiency is watt-hours per mile.  So assuming X efficiency, Y watt hours gets you Z miles. You can build a pack any way you want. As long as the system can handle it, **if the pack has the same watt-hours**, it doesn't matter if it's 4s, 6s, 10s or 20s, the range will be the same. 

To get the same watt-hours, the total number of cells will be the same. So a 6s setup with the same watt-hours as a 12s setup will have twice the number in parallel.

I do know this however every one besides you doesn't think so. I think before you talked about making a 8s2p pack could go the same speed as a 12s 1p.

It can, IF you get the gearing, wheel size and motor kv correct.  If you're going to use 18650 batteries, both 8s2p and 12s1p are pretty weak though. Assuming 20 amps per cell, that would get you 40 amps at 8s or 20 amps at 1s. 12s2p or 10s3p would be better, especially if you want 20 miles of range.
