## The Intro

As it says... the name of this project is `The Noob`... First board... first build. I'm not a longboarder/skater... but I do snowboard quite a bit... Hopefully that experience will help with learning to ride :smiley: 

## The Plan

Mostly building this board as a commuter. I work in a downtown area and the parking rates are crazy. I figured that I could park at a bus station a few miles away from work and ride my board in. 

I tend to go a little crazy with my hobbies and I fully expect I will want to build another board after this one. My plan is to build this one with parts that could possibly go on a shorter deck in the future... and upgrade this one with higher quality/more powerful parts. 

## The Parts

### Undecided parts
Deck - I'm not sure what to pick for a deck. I'm 210ish pounds and will have another 10 pounds in gear when I ride back and forth to work. When i snowboard I'm a big fan of laying out big, high-g, carves... my guess is I'll also enjoy that style of riding on a esk8. 
- Assumptions
  - Will need a stiffer deck for my weight
  - Will want a longish deck for stability
  - Will want something that my feet can really grind into

Wheels - Everyone recommends the Abec Flywheels... now I'm just worried about size. I'm leaning towards a 83 or 90mm wheel... top speed isn't a real priority... I think I'd prefer torque.

Motor Pulley - 15t or 16t?

## Questions
- Am I missing anything major from my list of parts?
- Any parts that are NOGO? 
- Any Suggestions?
- Deck recommendations?
- Wheel Thoughts?

Thanks for reading my wall of text!

Check out this deck, it is very much like a snowboard in design and feeling.

 I would also go with the Flipsky dual 6.6, the 4.2 has had some problems, as well as the flipsky motors. If you want cheap motors, go with sk3 (Hobbyking). If you want better quality motors, spring for dual 6355 Torqueboards motors. Bigger wheels are always better, so you should grab the 90mm flywheels, and 16 teeth motor pulley will be slightly better for torque.

The motors etc have been ordered already hey?  Good deal that too.  The 4.2 is a bit funny on 12s I believe but 10 should be fine.  They have good back up though so hopefully you should be good.  
With that little battery you are not going to be running high amps so you're not going to be breaking any speed records or indeed stressing out the esc too much.  It will be the first thing you upgrade later though. (the battery) 
I weigh in at 220lbs and the vanguard is just a bit too flexy for me.  If you know anyone with a boosted have a go on it and see what you think. I like the sector 9 bintang better for my weight.


 ![image|159x318](upload://wUiyRWzpAQaiCT9PRkzrAU6Ju67.jpeg) 
For laid out carves you want some dkp trucks be honest. Shame you already ordered the mounts because evolve trucks with @marcmt88 mounts are the business for carving about but you could go dkp up front and caliber on the rear just like this guy did.

Any Suggestions?
[/quote]


10s2p is not gonna deliver much power without noticeable voltage sag.
You really need a min 10s3p and preferably 10s4p or higher.

I just installed a flipsky dual 4.2 on a deck, make sure you don’t go over 30a for the max motors or it will cut out...

My only suggestion is if you like the board tilting aspect of hard carving on your snowboard then you may want to consider caliber 44's instead of 50's. High G+high speed carving on 50's kind of feels like shit lol.. i come from a wakeboarding background so I prefer my whole body and my feet to roll and lean as one. On 50's you will be doing a lot more leaning in your ankles to compensate for lack of board roll/rotation! So you should either 3D print or buy some wedges to lower the kingpin angle or get some 44's. I genuinely believe they will better fit you riding style. Good Luck!

Yeah... i did a bit of reading on up on the Flipsky Dual 4.2... it looks like as long as I stay with 10s batteries and in BLDC it should work out fine. I'll be stick to 10s while I get comfy on the board. I'll keep the Motor recommendations in mind when I start upgrading this board :smiley: 

I'll take a look at the Sector 9 Bintang... the price seems to be a lot lower than the Vanguard. 

I haven't bought the trucks yet... I'll look into running DKP up front and Calibers in the rear. 

Thanks for the recommendations!

Caliper rears will not be the same length as the evolve dkp trucks in the front if you go with that build, you would need to get the Tb 218 trucks if you want the same width

All good my friend.  As I said all you will probably want to do is upgrade the battery to a minimum of 4p so you can run some more amps through there.  Good start though.

Thanks for the headsup on the Flipsky problems... My understanding is that with the 4.2 as long as I stay with a 10s battery in BLDC they should run decently for a beginner/intro board and most of the motor problems came from the 637x motors... I'll keep the motor suggestions in mind for when I upgrade. 

I was leaning toward the 90mm wheels... sort of a goldilocks pick. I'll also pick up a 16t motor pulley... any suggestions on what vendor to go through?

check out this deck. 

https://gordonandsmith.com/collections/skateboards/products/38-fibreflex-pintail

so flexy you can jump on it and hit the ground no problem. closest thing ive ridden thats a smooth and flowy as a snowboard. 

as for wheels, its all about application, if you plan on riding bumpy, holy, rocky roads, go big.  if its smooth paved paths, go small.

broooooo fr? So I'm so sad, I sold it about 3 weeks ago. Had it since i was 15... 2009 Hatch. full sti drivetrain swap out of a 07 JDM imported wreck, blouch 440 @25psi on E85. Fortune auto coilovers with 25mm F&R sway bars and a 2015 Sti steering rack with some 17x9 Enkei RPF1's on michelin PSS's! Car was a fucking riot. Since college i just don't have the time or funds to support it anymore. Sold it to one of my best friends though! So I get to keep an eye on it now :) an IAG stage 2.5 Short block is about to go in it lol good shit...![image|666x500](upload://94AX6tngDwSDILreirG7H5T1fiA.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://6F1YuqP4Gi6geBT03UmtjA8ilQw.jpeg)

You can get some flywheel clones off amazon for about $20. The real thing is way more expensive and honestly the clones work just fine. You can get a motor pulley from anywhere, Torqueboards or buildkitboards will work fine

Everyone says clones are fine but I’ve killed cores in literally 6 different wheels from 3 different sets. So literally half the clones I’ve had I’ve broken the bearing housing part of the cores. Granted... I slide them stupid hard and frequently buttt I’m only 125 pounds so I just cannot recommend clones anymore. I got 83mm abecs about 2 weeks ago and that classic thane can be slid all over the world which is great and so far the cores are holding up great. Yes it’s 2 to 3x as much but it’s genuinely worth it on safety, especially with him being over 200 pounds. It’s also worth it for ride quality and slide/grip consistency. I’d just suggest getting some real abecs or some wheels with kegel cores. Clone cores just cannot be trusted!

Got the board all together.. found that the 10s2p was lacking... Ordered up another Ownboard 10s2p to run in parallel to get a 10s4p. Needed a new enclosure... decided to try some new stuff.. brother inlaw just moved close and he's got a CNC router.. so I designed a new enclosure in Fusion360... carved it out of pink foam and fiberglassed it. 

Unfortunately I didn't realize that the Bondo resin I used was Poly Resin and eats foam. :D Turned out okay all things considered.

Done! Mostly :smiley:

Bluetooth modules from Flipsky are NRF based so need to replace with some HM10... Will flash with Ackmaniac firmware at that point. 

Will need to remake the enclosure at some point... probably after my next build. Need to buy 2 more screws... dropped them and can't find them.

Great looking build man! The fiber glass resin on the foam....yea I learned that one on of the last layers of the first deck I vacuum formed....warped the whole deck on the end that the foam got eaten away.


How's the board ride? Is it meeting your needs as that last mile?

The board made it about half way up the hill before stalling out. Perhaps I have some settings configured incorrectly... according to a quick calculation... Its an 60ft elevation gain over about .1 miles.. for about a 10% grade. Board should be able to handle this. 

I'm using MManers settings from here: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/flipsky-dual-fsesc4-20-info-review/71079

You can paint on something like liquid latex to act as a barrier if you want to use this sort of foam. Or even masking tape will work. There are PU foams like surfboard foam or boat building pu foam and insulation foam which won't get eaten by the polyester resin.

Yeah.. I had started to cover the buck in tape when I got lazy.. I had assumed the resin was epoxy and not poly resin... I dont think epoxy eats the foam.

I'll look into latex or a different type of foam next time.. thanks for the headsup.
