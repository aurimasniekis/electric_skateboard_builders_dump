Thanks to any and all that helped me learn and answered my noob questions. This thing beats the pants of my boosted v2 with 100mm boas.

Very nice build

@Sn4pz, those are the new @marcmt88 idler-connecting rods-X sloted-mounts (we generally call them _Janux_ mounts by the way :yum:). Best custom mounts this side of the Milky Way. :ok_hand:

Nice build man!  My favourite pastime is scoping new builds and this one does not disappoint.
Is that a tb enclosure with a carbon wrap?

Thanks! And yup it’s a copperish carbon fiber vinyl wrap. Not the best I wana redo it. But it looks good if your not scrutinizing it.

Looks good to me.  Its a good call as those shiny enclosures don't really do it.  Carbon all the way!!

And I already broke her. Anyone else see this with Caliber II’s? Should I just get some torqueboards 218’s? 

Thought I could roll over some steel plates with the 107’s but didn’t think this would happen...

Update! Sooooo I went a lil ham after I finished the first iteration of this build. I bought a stock Lacroix and built a DIY Lacroix after that. All while that was going on I was messing with different set ups for this battery/motor combo:

First was wider trucks, I put tq board 218 hangers on it with riptide pivot cups and caliber II baseplates. Then I tried a deck swap to a Landy Switch and used angled risers to run mbs trucks and air tires:
![image|281x500](upload://mKHrisy4Ip8sMCMrvYhgnh0Lflg.jpeg) 

I wasn’t a fan of how high it sat so I put the thane back on it with the 218mm trucks. Then I quickly realized it wasn’t the height I just dont like drop decks at speed. That brought me to what I think will be the last deck swap and close if no the final iteration of the board:
![image|375x500](upload://vTFXFZ459dyO3EmVcIkOh0YSp8X.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://i1rwXUDyTPhw0x6t3Ii62BysFwp.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://5kRiPRWnlkW7HsPfiUjvRr1NKpb.jpeg) 

It’s a Valhalla Sell Out with a Rodger Bro’s foot stop.

I’m super happy with the feel of the board now, I think I’ve found the sweet spot of truck positioning but I may experiment with moving the rear truck up even one more position. This deck also doesnt tire my feet out on rides longer than 20 mins the same way the arbor highground did. That highground became my deck for a Boosted deck swap I put together.... it’s for sale if anyone is interested:
