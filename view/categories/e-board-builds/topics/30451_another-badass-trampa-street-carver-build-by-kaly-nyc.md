Finally picked up my Trampa Street Carver from the one and only @Kaly and I'm absolutely blown away! Build quality and the attention to detail is ridiculous! 

Even though I've only spent a few hours on it today, I love it! It's crazy fast so I'm just getting use to the power curve and the boards carving characteristics. 

I'll report back once I get some more ride time on it. For the time being, here are the basic specs and some pics...

Trampa 14ply Street Carver deck 
Trampa Vertigo front and rear trucks
MBS 100mm wheels 
Dual Kaly.NYC 6355 230kv motors 
Dual Kaly.NYC motor mounts & pulleys 
Dual VESC-X (Ackmaniacs) 
12S4P battery w/ 60amp BMS
Bluetooth dongle 
Individual motor on/off switches

Beautiful! I love the 14ply deck, perfect amount of flex after bolting the enclosure. 

I wonder how he did the hexagon grip tape design. 

@kaly is a great guy, I'm really happy with his customer services and quality of parts

I actually did the grip tape myself. Bought a few packs of laser cut hexagons from the guys over at gripgraphique.com 

They also sell other styles and designs. Check them out and tell Gordon at Grip Graphique John from NY sent ya!

It's my first time on them, and in all honesty I was a little worried about "street traction" due to the design, but they're actually not that bad. @Kaly also lent me a sent of shaved down green MBS wheels to try as well. I'm going to give them a go later this weekend (if the rain holds off) and see which I prefer better. If I like the shaved ones, Ernesto said he would shave down mine, so we will see.

Beautiful! Careful about those rear trucks on the non shaved wheels :stuck_out_tongue:

I'm trying to figure out how the battery meter was done on the bottom. Care to show some more pics?

Also looks like there is a power button, xt90 key, and 2 individual motor switches. What does the power button do if there is a loop key?
```

You'll have to reach out to @Kaly for details on how the battery meter was made, but as for having both an XT90 key and power button - the power button is what you use to power on and off the board, and the XT90 key acts as a safety cut off for the boards. 

Ps... I swapped out the black knobby MBS's for a set of green shaved MBS's (on loan from @Kaly) and man they really have some serious grip! Gonna have to shave down mine asap!

Hi @DucatiGuy 
We meet at @Kaly 's house , I mentioned using bindings , and we briefly talked about the @Ackmaniac app.ðŸ˜€   
I have since switched from MBS wheels to AT wheels
I have to get used to the hight, taller , and torque curve different

Hey Robert! 
I spent the better half of the weekend getting acclimated to my new board. It's definitely a beast and I'm having a blast with it. 

I haven't gotten around to setting up the android app yet. Hopefully this week I'll have some time to tinker with it. 

I've never been on a board with AT wheels, so I'm looking forward to it. Kaly should be getting my set in sometime next week or so. I'm sure there's going to be a learning curve with them as well. 

Considering you rode to Kaly's, do you live nearby?

Hi @DucatiGuy (John)
Yes I live within 4 long blocks of Kaly.. not much of a ride in terms of electric skateboarding
I hear you with learning and adapting to the board .
I haven't gotten used to the air tires yet.. there are imbalances on each tire, I have to sort though. With stickie weights . And also Trampas inova air tires are not the best for high speeds( not perfectly round) IMO.. 
Kaly likes the air tires from Evolve. They are better quality . And can inflate to 50psi less rolling resistance , unlike Inova 's 36psi
Well hope to get together for a ride one day soon 
By.. have funðŸ˜œ

Wow!!!! That is one fine board. How much does it set you back? In AUS dollars?
As well have you got any pic of the controller? 

Cheers

I'm curious to know how much this was too. Can I have first dibs if you ever decide to sell? I'm looking around for a board and checking out parts to build my own too.

The Kaly built Trampa Street Carver board, in a 2 in 1 configuration (pneumatic and urethane wheels), with 4A fast charger, and remote is comparable in price to that of an Evolve Carbon GT. 

Have no plans to get rid of it anytime soon. I love it! Thereâ€™s really nothing else like it.

Custom machined upper hardware (wide head bolts), in combination with a set of o-rings, and front / rear bike LED lights I picked up on Amazon.

Simple, relatively inexpensive, and most importantly - it works!

No, you don't want to use rubber bands. You need a good quality Buna-N or Viton type o-ring, which won't rip easily in such an application.

Wondering Is the steering more sensitive by comparison to the caliber2 50degree trucks.

Btw I'm on total ore of this board

I wouldnâ€™t say theyâ€™re anymore or any less sensitive. It all depends on how you set either or up. The Trampaâ€™s have a lot of adjustability, so you can really dial them in.

I have a love hate relationship with Trampa decks. These builds are sexy as hell. but riding them felt awkward because of the arched stance. I guess wont be bad once you get used to it

You need to try the ultimate wide trucks + carver base plates + HS11 deck + front truck mod for inner spring position, the board is really stable at high speeds and the turning amazes me everyday, no need for bindings at all and you get used to it in minutes.

I understand the concern but my feet would rest in the corners of the front and back of the deck rather than anywhere in the middle of the deck I have large feet and I need to brace them on the edges that's why I like a drop down  Board

Ernesto publishes his full bill of materials on his website with pricing and links to each item (he's the real deal):

https://www.kaly.nyc/street-carver-by-kaly (at bottom), or just click here:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/hvtz5jkhwrxvay5/city%20carver.pdf?dl=0 

Frankly speaking, Ernesto is not charging enough. :slight_smile: 

Note: Ernesto's setup distributes battery mass (12s4p, 48 cells, Samsung 25rs) underneath the entire surface of the platform so the _Kaly City Carver_ handles differently than a 'factory' _Trampa Electric Urban Carver_ with an outboard Zippy battery (which unto itself is excellent and feels very fast and fun).

That happened to me also wry the carve deck, but with the hs11 or HollyPro you will ride on the center because of the shape/length
