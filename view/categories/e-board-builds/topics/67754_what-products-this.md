Hi everyone,

So I was just on Instagram and the following post came up. I'm just wondering what on/off button they use (image 3). Anyone got any ideas?

That's a standard clicky led ring light.

Search "SPDT LED button" to find a TON.

@MrDGOrman I don't believe that's what the finished product is going to look like exactly, as far as the color of the deck goes, but that is the Finix by Arc Boards. You can check out their website here: https://www.arcboardsev.com/ üëç

Cheers guys. I'm only interested in the on off switch and not the board itself :slight_smile:
