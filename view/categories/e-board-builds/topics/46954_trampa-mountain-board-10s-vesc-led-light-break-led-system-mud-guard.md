I made a battery case and a VESC case with a 3D printer.
And added a mudguard and braking LED system.
There are two 10S 9A batteries under the deck and can be replaced.

In Korea, it is fashionable to use colorful LEDs by turning down the main battery voltage without an individual power source.

What a gorgeous build! How long did it take to print those mud guards? I'm hoping to do something similar.

Dude, that is an awesome build! Way to personalize your board and make it stand out! 
How are you powering your lights? Do you have a separate battery?

Is it just me or do the holes on the motor look like a hazard what if a rock fell inside?

Oh and the build looks great! If you did not use all them lights you would have more range right?

@LunarKim Those mud guards and light housings are awesome!  Any chance you'd be kind enough to upload the STL files to Thingyverse to share with the community?  I'd love to try a print out of Nylon 910 and post it here (with due credit of course :)
