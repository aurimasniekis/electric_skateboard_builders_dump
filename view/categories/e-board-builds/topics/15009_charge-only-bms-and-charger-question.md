I've ordered just about all the parts for my first build, but I had one final thing I wasn't sure about.

I'm building a 10S2P Basen 26650 li-ion battery pack, and I'm planning on using the BMS only for charging.
My question is, since I am only using it for charging, will a BMS like this one work?:

And will that battery/BMS work with a 6A charger like this one?:

I wasn't sure if 6A was overkill, but I couldn't find much in between. Want to charge fast without breaking the bank.

If anyone has suggestions on a BMS or charger for my build, that would be appreciated.
