I'm down. 2 motors rewound, sensored, and in place on the board. And just finished a third motor rewind.

Would love to try out my new trampa cruiser but it is the last hooraa before my littles go back to school. We just need to check off roller skating and Santa Cruz (again) this weekend.

All is good. Just did the first spin with the 4 rewound motors and I'm back in business. New top speed should be around 34 mph now (just did 30 mph on a less than half charged battery).

I am vegan non-binary Trump supporter, is it OK if I show up ?

Will you guys make fun of me ?

Are you guys planning on having a vegan option at the barbecue ?

Also I can't eat honey because its from :bee:.

Thank you

Theres 7 people confirmed on the facebook page and a couple more non-facebook users going. So I'm guessing about 10~ people. I can make the reservation at Burger Meister, but I unfortunately can't attend :(

EDIT: actually @evoheyax you might want to make the reservation since I can't put my contact info down since I'll be out
