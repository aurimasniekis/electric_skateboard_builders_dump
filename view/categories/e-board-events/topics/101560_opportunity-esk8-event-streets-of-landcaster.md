Calling all Esk8 racers :
Our community has been invited to participate in an exhibition race at the 11th annual 'Streets of Lancaster Grand Prix'. This is a 3 day shifter karting event sponsored by Toyota that pulls drivers from across the country to compete for bragging rights. This is a rare opportunity to showcase how Esk8 has evolved and grown into a sport worthy of its own place in the exciting world of extreme sports.  The owner of SKUSA, the premier karting association in the US,  is offering us a night race on Saturday, Sept 28th to include announcer, cameras and big screens highlighting every turn for an audience of thousands in addition to a spotlight interview to promote our sport & sponsors.  We need at least 15 riders with boards that will do 30 mph or faster to commit by this Friday, Sept 13th in order to secure our spot at this event. There are no entry fees, insurance is covered by the promoter, the event includes street party, live music, car show and great kart racing. Check it out at www.streetsoflancaster.com and contact Moe Stooge with any questions and get your name confirmed on the roster!

Quick update.  The Promoter presented "us" as a racing group to the City of Lancaster. THEY LOVED IT.  Green light with the city ‚úîÔ∏è.  The Insurance seems to be slowing the process.  I don't know what issues are in the way but it's being worked out.  We Currently are not in the show yet pending Insurance approval.
