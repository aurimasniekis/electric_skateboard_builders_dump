Is 7,000sq ft indoor skate park big enough to race in?

What do you see as limitations?

What kind of track design?

How may people would be a max in a race?

Would longboards be able to make it?

Talk to me

shortboards, really carvey beasts, slides, etc. would be awesome on a circle 8 (or some other overlapping shape) track.

what if we made deck size max rule?

Another alernative to deck size rule would be to put down a few cones to test the minimum steering radius required and if the board passes its fine

I think a max of 33in is probably a good rule.  Anything over 33in is not gonna make tight enough carves or be very easy to slide anyways.  

You could also do heats, where you match 4 people at a time, the winners moves up the bracket to be matched in a group of 4 again, until eventually you have a last race of 4 people and that winner is the overall winner.

Tack design will be tough.  Just off the top of my head, I would suggest a figure 8 with tight curves to limit top speed and really test a riders carving and sliding skill.

Wheelbase, truck/track width & bushing height (lean) on a skate truck dictate turn radius. Not deck length.

If you'll don't want to race against Moe you should just say so...

Wheel base is related to deck length tho...

No it is not!

Why do I have 31-40 inch decks all with the same wheel base? :thinking:

you cant fit a 30inch wheelbase on a 29inch deck. Unless i miss understood what wheelbase is.

The place where the holes are drill are the dictating factor but generally the longer the board the longer the wheel base

I feel like you're discriminating against my 48" deck and it's super horrible turning ability.

Let me be clear here, I do not want to race against Moe üòÅ.

Aside from that, it's kind of like the rule about truck with. You don't need y trucks to make a stable board but you can make it stable board much more easy with wide trucks.

I think the same applies to cars and slides, it's easier to do on a shorter board.

Here's an idea.  Find a compliant indoor go kart enterprise. You can hire these places out usually and only use the parts of the track that suit.  

 Back in the day I organised a pit bike race at a local kart track for all my silly mates but no one made it round the first corner.  Still a lot of fun though.

Humm ... this indoor challenges me... now let think about the surface...skatepark or race track....

@RunPlayBack do you have some feedback as to the riding conditions when you had your event? Was it too slick? Was the course to short? Too tight?

What kind of skatepark surface are we talking about here concrete?
What about what they use on schools tracks?

Hey bro... yeah that was a lot of fun. It was awhile ago but let me see if I can remember a few things:

- It was a GoKart track meant for Sodi GT5 Indoor Racing Karts based-off a racing designed chassis equipped with 6.5 HP Honda Engines, slick racing tires and hydraulic brakes.

- The hairpin turns were killer and some riders were at an advantage depending on stance.

- Carvon EVO was a little too big for this kind of track, a Jet Spud with some softer bushings was probably ideal.

- Weight and height didn't have a huge effect on outcome more than experience and confidence.

- It was fun doing timed sessions and the organization made it "feel" official.

- It was competitive but overall everyone just had a good time because we never did an ESK8 race before. Even the owners and GoKart regulars were interested in watching us.

Kart track makes a great venue spot.  Speeds don't get crazy and the course, techinal. Definitely equalizes the boards and makes a riders track where maintaining momentum is King.  The 42" wheelbase (106cm) raceboard steering adjusts well to kart track racing.   Park track racing? I could have a sauce ready for October. ![IMG_20180411_213648|616x500](upload://A6bGK9z9mDRM2dY3uVtZiHyWdIj.jpg) ![IMG_20180414_173446_223|320x292](upload://lsFUZ8cvymFYk6ZoDWJGBmibIz9.jpg)

@RunPlayBack & @MoeStooge how about slippage? Reduced speeds, less cornering grip...all seems like it would be a difficult condition to race

The Kart track I raced on in Colorado was an epoxy overlay with an abrasive grit like surface. Urethane had surprisingly decent grip.  Some kart tracks I've been on spray a syrup to tack up the track while others leave a polished concrete slick surface. It just depends on the track.

The place I thinking of .... (and you know what Im talking about) has smooth floors and wood...thats what I am working on at the moment...

If racetrack is too slick... it may end up looking like the keystone cops üëÆüèª on Esk8...although funny...not fun for the racers
