Hey guys!

I've been living in Amsterdam for a bit over a month now and have obviously taken my board along with me. The fact that there's bike paths literally on every road means it's longboard heaven! Absolutely amazing to ride here.

Are there any others in Amsterdam with eboards? Anyone interested in a meetup?

Utrecht over here! 

I know of 2 people in amsterdam with e-boards. One has a Z-Board, the other has an Evolve Bamboo. 

We have a little group on facebook https://www.facebook.com/groups/592964250809183/?fref=ts (feel free to join, think it is time we organize a meetup!)
