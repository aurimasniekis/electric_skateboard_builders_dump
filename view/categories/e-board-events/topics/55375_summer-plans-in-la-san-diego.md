Waiting patiently... I've been itching to join a group ride and am hoping to make time this summer to drive down to the LA or San Diego area and test the limits of my now fine-tuned board. Just wondering if anyone was planning a few meets or group rides down in that area for June/July?

Download the “TELEGRAM” app. Then come back and click on the following link. We can get a SoCal group together that way. 

No way I would make it to anything that’s not weekend. So no go on the 21st since that’s a Thursday
