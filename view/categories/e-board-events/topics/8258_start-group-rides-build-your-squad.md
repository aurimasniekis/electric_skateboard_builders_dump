I posted a poll a little while ago abt How many of your friends e-sk8? If the numbers above are any indication of our hobby....We got some work to do 

It's time we organize. It's time we share how awesome it is to ride.

Post up an invite here, FACEBOOK, Craigslist etc....Invite other DIYers and owners of pre made boards to ride....It's a great opportunity to meet other riders and to exchange information, and to see other builds face to face.  Also, invite people that don't have an eboard (if you have an extra board) to ride with you to experience the thrill.

It's also a great way to share your cool ride spots and discover new ones!  Who doesn't like a little adventure?  Meet up with other riders from other cities and even countries.  

So, take the initiative...be a diplomat for e-sk8.  Show people what you love abt it...Weather it's the building process of the board or just riding ... Share.

Think of what you can do to help spread the word....and DO IT.

⭐️Don't forget, safety should be our #1 concern Helmets are a must 
⭐️⭐️Take lots of videos and pictures and share them
⭐️⭐️⭐️ ENJOY the RIDE

I can 100% agree with you. We have a nice little group of potentially 8 riders.
Schedules never allowed to have a full squad ready but we got some tours in in a group of 3-5. And its a thrilling feeling to go for a cruise, stop, eat and drink something and then drive back home. just so much fun.

I mean I am just thinking aloud here. But switzerland is pretty central in Europe. I am lucky enough to have 3 different places we could stay, depends how many. So potentially with a big "IF", we could arange a riding camp of sorts. 1 week or 5 days cruises in Switzerland. I mean i drove regularly to sweden and Danmark for freeride/downhill events.
Just thinking out loud here...

There's a [trail review on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/50fq99/trail_review_chief_sealth_seattle/) for a trail known as Chief Stealth. Sounds like a great trail.

As part of the review they mention the a Seale estk8 group " ... Seattle eSk8 group had their August Group ride on the 6 mile long Chief Sealth trail in south Seattle."

I haven't lived in Seattle for many years but for those that do, I thought this might be a way to connect with a local crew.

I need a squad. Right now its just me and my son terrorizing the hood with our board testing. I know somebody has to esk8 in the orlando area but damned if i can find them. Miami, Tampa, Jacksonville... all very inconveniently located peeps who are hours away. 

Maybe i'll just build some boards with follow-me functionality and put mannequins on them. 

:musical_note: :notes: I'm so lonely, I just got to let you know :notes::musical_note:

Spring is coming and summer will be right behind it.  

Look at the poll....Almost 75% of you know nobody else that rides esk8.  What's that abt? 

For those of you that love esk8 and would love to have more of your friends....What are you doing to promote Esk8? 

Hope you guys get together this summer and ride.

As few of my friends start building their own boards after riding one of mine.
So I start to build my German-Saar esk8 squad team. 
Also a local Facebook group helps! Print some shirts with FB adress on it and ride around. People start looking and start asking questions online and maybe one or two are going to join your squad ;)
