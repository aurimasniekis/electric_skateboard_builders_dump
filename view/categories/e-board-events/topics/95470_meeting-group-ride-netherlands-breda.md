Hello people, I recently move to Breda, and I bring my DIY skateboard, and I trying to see if I can make a group ride, for know new people and see the others DIY skateboards, or another DIY vehicle. I prefer in Breda but if the majority of the people is from another city can be that city.

See you ;)

Heey Pedro,  You're in Breda do am I ...so you ride your electric skateboard through town correct? Since they are illegal in the Netherlands I have been reluctant to buy one... I was wondering what your experience is with the law enforcement in Breda?

Thx
Marcus

Hey marcusraptus
I ride almost every weekend, if the weather is good. 

And the police here are very peaceful.
I pass some times by the police and never be stopped
And I don't ride to fast of course, max 15/16 I know it's illegal but I don't abuse as well
