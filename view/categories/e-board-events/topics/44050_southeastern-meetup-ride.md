Just wanted to get the dialog started about an eskate meetup located in the Southeast, specifically Atlanta. We have a fairly large group that rides weekly here, and I'm stumbling upon more potential group riders every time we're out cruising. At the Raptor2 event last fall we had over 20 riders, granted some were from Florida. I'm thinking Spring or Fal might be ideal due to the hot/sticky Summers (bring extra GoldBond), but I'm down whenever people are available. If you'd like to see some of the awesome riding we have just a few blocks from my front door you can Google Piedmont Park, The Beltline Trail, & Freedom Parkway Trail amongst many other bike lane roads as our city is becoming more and more pedestrian friendly. Anyways all are obviously welcome and the only thing concrete I have in mind is if we do this we need to have shirts/hats/koozies/sweatbands/etc to commemorate our awesome meetup. 

Anyways what do you guys think? Any preference on season or format? Maybe some of the guys who have organized these in the past could give some tips. Thanks in advance

I'm in Birmingham, and would love to go to ATL for a group ride.  I think spring because Fall is too damn far away!

I don't see any reason why we couldn't make that happen at least with my current schedule!

I have a few extra boards if anyone is left out. If you're lucky you can ride my sweet modded Meepo deck swap...it's pretty gnarly

Well someone who likes to be in charge should really start tossing some dates and locations around and we can all vote for what is best for us!

No issue here.  I will make anything happen that everyone else decides on.  Flexibility is literally my biggest job perk!

I'm a systems engineer.  Just a fancy title for designing communications systems, mostly fiber networks, pots, voip, etc.  Its pretty fun stuff, I get to see a bunch of different industries and meet people that do some out-there jobs.

Twenty Ninth works for me.  It's your home field, you set the schedule.

I'll bring the "HELLO MY NAME IS" stickers.

And if custom printed sweatbands are prohibitively expensive, maybe some vinyl stickers?

Lol I love it üòÇ I‚Äôll wear a sticker for sure. This sounds great. What would be sweet is if we could find a routine meeting schedule that works for everyone. Once a month would be sweet!

Once a month would be a bit too often for me personally. I could be down for once a quarter or something.

It's a bit of a drive, but I'll try to make it. 7 hour drive. 500mi. I'll need more batteries.
