I was vacationing from Bronx New York to Orlando Florida with wife and pooch and discovered Lake Baldwin park , witch has an awesome dog park but most of all a 4 mile loop around the lake.
The bike path is a little narrow for esk8 speeds. But I rode in the street speed limit is 25mph so I had. I problems with cars.üòä
 Sorry about the video from YouTube . It plugs juice bike. But the view around is to get the idea.

eBoarding on the Daytona Beach FL 8/27/17. All-Terrain tires recommended, but the sand should be hard enough for Street wheel eboards; just have to push start them...
