That's an awful reason not to let someone post on a forum xD Their loss if they're in NYC and want to go out with a large crew of e-skaters. For anyone who is interested the events are on Reddit electric skateboarding, The Evolve Forums, Community Leiftech as well as facebook under NYC Boosted Board riders (but anyone with an e-skate is welcome)

I see this as a pinned post, but then events are not posted on the link mentioned here, but on the main forum where this is pinned. Just a FYI ;)
