Due to recent election results, I've relocated myself and my family to the UAC base on Phobos, the remaining moon of Mars, which despite being mostly inoperable and infested with cyberdemons is in much better shape than the US will be soon.  But i'm still doing business primarily in the Orlando area of Florida.

Put this out on Raptor owners thread.
Saddle Brook, NJ
Usually I ride in NYC as parking there sucks and easier (and faster) to get around by e-board than drive or Uber. There are a lot of really nice parks in NJ. Have not got a chance to get to the Shore with it yet though. There are Boosted Board all over the city.

Welcome!

Yeah, let's definitely plan for a ride... maybe when it's above 10 degrees outside. :snowman: A few of us rode down the Capital Crescent Trail from Maryland into DC, about 8 miles one-way,

The DC folks put together a separate thread here: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/washington-d-c-metro-esk8-enthusiasts-meetup/11321

We can discuss dates and meetup spots there.

I'm working on a new build this winter, but should hopefully have it completed in the next few weeks as parts come in.

Near 75 and Lovers Lane (near north park mall, about 5 miles north of downtown). It looks like there are a couple of people around here, haven't met up with anyone yet though (board is still being built + it's been too cold). Looking forward to some spring time rides with some new friends though.

Santa Maria, CA

Have only seen one other rider in town so far I think he rides a Boosted V1

Although a ton of people are picking up the motorized bicycle hobby I left 4 years ago. Back then there was one or two other guys and now I see one 4 out of 5 days on a short 2 mile commute to work

My buddy got married at the church that is by where the science building is now and he got nervous so we went to Kate‚Äôs for some drinks and we walked in in tux‚Äôs and the bartender asked why we were dressed up and I said oh we are going to a wedding and the bartender just looked at us and said oh. And realizing how it sounded we said not to each other and everyone in there laughed and bought us shots.

[quote="ZachTetra, post:5796, topic:9559, full:true"]
Got the parts for a 12s4p and a bunch of the p-packs got ripped apart in transit and I can pull the damaged packs apart with my hands

Should I pull apart all the packs to be on the safe side?

Edit: NVM I absolutely have to because they are all about to short out across the positive terminal

Someone please refer me to anyone near Delaware who can weld tabs to these‚Ä¶no more than 2 hours by car
