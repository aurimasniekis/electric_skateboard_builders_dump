Ok. So there are some options for meet ups. Given the limited range some may have, we may want to do a shorter trail that can easily be lapped a couple of times and is conveniently located near the power outlets of a state park and also a mcdonalds

There is a bike trail off of exit 108 in Sanford, at Gemini Springs state park,  that rides through some of the prettiest camping and wild areas i know of around here. The total length of the trail is only about 4.2 miles each way from the parking lot where we would meet up. There is also a mcdonalds right there with outlets and french fries, and within the park itself are bathrooms, vending machines, a big open field, and some outlets. 

Here's a link to the park and ride lot just outside the park right before the head of the trail that dips into the park on google maps: https://goo.gl/maps/nt47STcydiv That's where i usually park to ride there. But we may want to meet up in the park itself to accomodate those with lower watt hours.

## PARKING


There are two places to park. 

**PARK AND RIDE**
This is the park and ride just outside the state park. It sits directly on a segment of bike trail that goes directly to the park. If you have a higher watt hour board, as in more than 300 watt hours, this is where you want to go:
https://goo.gl/maps/nt47STcydiv


**GEMINI SPRINGS STATE PARK**
aka Gemini Springs Dog Park. Ironiclly i don't see a whole lot of dogs there, mostly people with balls and drones. This is the actual park. They also have parking. I figure the people with the lower watt hour boards may want to park there because the beautiful segment of trail that we're showing up here for cuts directly through this park.  There's a pavilion near a field next to the parking area that has a few outlets for charging, and trail access is right at the driveway. 
https://goo.gl/maps/WKBcrDzc3c12

My suggestion is that we meet IN THE PARK but park our cars in either place. ITs about a 5-15 minute board ride from the Park-n-ride to the actual park depending on how fast you ride. It's worth it if you have the extra watt hours. 

I will be there in a white LHB t-shirt with my crazy yellow board so i will be hard to miss. I'll also have my regular derp helmet with the red skull and crossbones on it. 

Me and the fam are camping out at the park saturday night and doing some midnight trail riding with our new sets of Shredlights. That is also and option if anyone else would like to join up for that. Hopefully we won't be eaten by bears.

---
## \#52 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2017-05-02T12:39:39.796Z Reads: 57

```
no big reason. Its just a longer ride on the trail from the park-n-ride that some people might enjoy before the actual meet. I'll be parking at the park-n-ride and riding into the park in time for the meet up so we can corral everybody into a proper mob before engaging in proper mobbery.

i put a heat sink on the top of my deck so i can just pee on it when the board overheats and keep going. It requires that i drink a lot of soda though, which causes me to gain weight, which causes the vescs to do more work which causes more heating, so i have to pee more, which means i have to drink more coke, which...

PRo Tip: Walmart sells these 150 amp twin outlet inverters that will push a typical 4Amp fast charger provided you wire it directly to the battery. We have one in the RAV4 right now. It would also be a good idea to keep the car running.

too bad the TSG group buy isn't over with already! i can't wait to have those helmets. 

SO PUMPED. 

@ralphy @oriol360 you guys coming? Oriol this is where we met up last time. 

I'm bringing stickers for everyone and also, one t-shirt that somebody will have to earn with an achievement of some type that i haven't defined yet. Possibly Best Bail or Best Slide Into Tree. If we do the Bush Ate Me acheivement i'll probably just end up winning the shirt because i pretty much always end up in a bush on this trail. It's kind of tradition for either jake or i to hug a tree of fly through a bush at speed so that wouldn't be fair to anyone else.

Just signed up for ESK8.  My girlfriend and I have been eboarding for over a year and love riding all over Florida.  I see you guys organized a ride event on May 7th; we would love to join the next one in Florida.  Does anyone know when the next one will be? Is their a calendar link or do I just need to watch out of posts?

We are based in Tampa bay area.  Please let us know...

Cheers,

fuck hurricanes. The 4pm thundershowers make most hurricanes look tame. 

Let me tell ya'll about hurricanes. I grew up on the coast of Mississippi. Camille ravaged my neighborhood before my pops moved in and knocked up moms. When I was two, Frederick tore a hole in our yard and dropped a tree on our neighbors house. When i was 9, Elena ripped up our yard and i had to pick up limbs for a week. I slept through most of it. Then there was Opal, George, a few others and then Katrina. Katrina was a nuclear holocaust to the coast of MS but everyone was looking at Louisiana because they blew thier seawall money up thier noses and got pwned by Neptune. I watched a house float down the street in front of me. Drank a case of beer on that one. 

But these goddamned afternoon thundershowers will fuck up your whole week throwing limbs and squirrels everywhere, ruining esk8 testing, overgrown lawns, power outages so no netflix, and everything is just saturated. 

Ok so in retrospect maybe hurricanes are maybe almost as bad and i'm just used to partying the whole time they happen.

I will help gather the forces of Skatan. 

Hey if you want to save on Hotel fare i have a couch. A really big couch. 

Since Watt hours will vary, i suggest Gemini Springs as the riding venue. That loop is less than 8 miles. Pretty much anyone can do that run and its super pretty. We could also hit up a 15 mile loop that has a mid point in downtown Winter Garden where we could get pizza and beer.

we should probably meet up at Gemini Springs and then do the after party somewhere else like my house or something. There's another trail about 2 miles from my house but Gemini Springs is just gorgeous. we could recharge and hit the second trail if we wanted or just chill.

Florida ESK8 meetup for Aug 19 2017.  Can you give me the address and time.  I'm seeing a map with latitude and longitude.  Does this sight have an event calendar like facebook?

We created a facebook group called Tampa Bay ESK8 squad so we can plan event rides for the Tampa area. As a matter of fact we will be meeting tonight 8/11 to go for a ride on the Riverwalk in downtown Tampa at 8:30.  You guys are welcome to join us.  We are meeting at 1501 Doyle Carlton Drive Tampa FL 33602.

The link is us cruising up and down the Courtney Campbell Causeway (day) and Riverwalk (night) last weekend.

Nice,lads!  👍 @longhairedboy wish you would film at least one of your builds,from making the deck,to piecing together components,making a battery etc 
I just love to watch things being built as well as building things myself, i get a certain satisfaction from it rather than just buying off the shelf products!  
Also your videography skills are up to par!

Thanks! I have a CC subscription and i use the hell out of it. I'm no stranger to Adobe products or using a camera in general, but this was my first time with a Go Pro and one of their gimbals. I usually iphone it.  I haven't looked at real video cameras in probably 15 years though because of lack of money and then phones got good so obviously this tiny thing blew me away when i actually saw for myself what it was capable of doing right out of the box. 

A complete build video would be complicated. But i am already working on how i want to do it, so its good to know it will be received well when i finally get started recording it. Nothing sucks more than working on something knowing it may not even get watched. 

I actually have a few orders i have to complete from the start right now so maybe i'll just set up a cam and dump the footage each night and then worry about editing out the mountains of extraneous footage later.

Could tell you were using a gimbal smooth footage!
I'm watching the rest of your vid now,the burnouts and donuts got me lol! 
I figured the reason you haven't filmed a build is its just time consuming,but I'll look foward to it in the future then.
The trails in florida look wicked btw 😎
