Hi Guys,

we'll be riding in LA from the Santa Monica pier to Venice the 25th and from Venice to Santa Monica the 26th. You can either enjoy the ride with our Linky (we have three free to use) or just have fun together with your e-board. We have some tshirts, stickers and cap to give away at the end of the trip. 
So:
- 25th Santa Monica pier (north side, outside of the tunnel) - 6 pm meeting point - 6.30pm start
- 26th Venice beach (muscle beach, near the basketball court) - 6 pm meeting point - 6.30pm start

Let us know here if you will join us!

Cheers!
