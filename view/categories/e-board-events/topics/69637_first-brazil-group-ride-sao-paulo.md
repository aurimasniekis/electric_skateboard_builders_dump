Not sure yet,

What do you think @Quiles

I'm not from S√£o Paulo but go there a lot, the routes I took so far is the Paulista Av. when it's closed for cars on Monday, the Minhoc√£o that's is also closed for cars and rod in Ibirapuera

We just need to see how far people can ride and find charge points for those who need

Anyone knows if there is outlets in Ibirapuera? I can ride 40 km on one charge so anything goes

@Vanarian Thanks, are you from here also?

Quantos tem skate el√©trico aqui no brasil? Ando h√° quase 1 ano e nunca conheci ningu√©m! 

Costumo andar no Ibirapuera, por√©m ultimamente estava muito sujo!

Na Paulista dia de domingo √© quase imposs√≠vel andar, de t√£o cheio que √©, j√° fui algumas vezes tamb√©m!

Para quem n√£o conhece as ruas de SP, s√£o p√©ssimas e dif√≠cil manter uma rota!

E ai Murilo, te mandei mensagem no privado do nosso grupo

Eu conhe√ßo umas 10 pessoas que tem por aqui

Ja andei em S√£o Paulo algumas vezes e alguns lugares √© bem ruim mesmo, a descida da paulista por Ibirapuera √© umas das piores

Que Skate voce tem? ou montou tambem?

Will take my GoPro üëçüèª

Would love to make some drone shots, but I think is asking for trouble flying on the places we will ride
