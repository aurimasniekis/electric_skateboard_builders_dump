@Jinra and I were aiming for a ride this Sunday anyways. Half of GG park is closed to car traffic on Sundays, and the main roads are butter. So it's a great place to meet up on Sundays.

haha, I wish I had hummies motors running now. I got a short in one of/maybe both of the back motors. I was running sensored for a week or so and man, that board was a beast.

Running the 4wd carvon v2's. They would be half bad if I could sensored them, but without sensors, acceleration is weak, but top speed in pretty crazy.

Basically, not ready for a 41% grade hill. Wish we had another week. Were putting together the first of the big motors this week, but they likely won't be ready by Sunday.

Keep us updated! And @Jinra maybe if something is actually happening you could potentially make a fb event page that way other people will see that there are actually people coming? Just a suggestion.

Hey @evoheyax, Looks like the SF marathon is tomorrow and goes through GG park, do you know if it's closed to bicycle traffic as well?
```

no idea, will look into it further. But most of GG park is part of the marathon. GG bridge, and the embarcadero.

It says 5:30 am to 12:30 pm though, so maybe it'll be ok later, like 2 pm?

Man, I wish i could have come down there and rode with you guys. Seems like conditions were perfect today. How was the ride? 

That's a pretty solid sampling of different boards there too. :thumbsup: If only there was someone with a MTB/AT boards too...:thinking:

You have the worst luck haha. you should build a 30q pack. So much space in that board, might as well use it!

I actually rode home, haha. Did 9 miles in total on it. But I went a tops of 15 mph the whole way, so it took a lot of time. I watched the temps carefully and waited at times for it to cool.

It was good though, I had a great time on the short ride and talking to Micheal on the way back was nice.

If I go 25-30 mph the whole ride, I get 5 miles. If I go under 15 mph, maybe 20 mph a few brief moments, I get 9 miles of range.

It's funny you say that Jinra because it's kinda true. The amount of shit that has gone wrong since I started building boards... Nothing lasts more than a few rides with me before something has to break, except hummies motors so far. I had a good 8 months there with out a single problem, until my wheels started falling off while riding a few months ago, lol (a problem of the plate not being big enough and too low duro wheels with no core, all of which has been fixed for the v3 motors).
