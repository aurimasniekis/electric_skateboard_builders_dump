I'm actually bringing my board with me.
My brother, sister and I are driving, so that allows me to bring it along.
Staying for a week as well.

Kept my $50.00 by six inches. Artie was a good sport. I got out a board and a half on the start and he tried coming around on the big end but ran out of track.  A great day and fun ride. Chuck was flagging the race and he may be the oldest Esk8ter at 64 years old. he made the 7 mile trip today... that was his board I was riding in the right lane that smoked Artie. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZVPOK6QCJo  Good times. Any one out there that wants a race, I'm a player..

It's here dangling on a string like a carrot if you want a crack at it. Bring your boys, (and girls). It would be a fun afternoon and we will 👑 some fool, King of the esk8 street or queen. 👍

LA county is one big urban sprawl that doesn't stop till it hits ocean, mountain or desert.
