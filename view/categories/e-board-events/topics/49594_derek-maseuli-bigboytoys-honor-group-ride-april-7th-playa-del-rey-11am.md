Joe (SoCal Legend) posted this on Facebook. Derek was a brother to many of us. He left us, his family and loved one way too early. If you can make it to this ride in his honor please join. 

Playa Del Rey is 10-15 minutes south of Santa Monica. If you are elsewhere, consider starting a group ride in Derek’s honor this day, we can make this an annual DerekRide!

Lol yeah. It’s a bit odd to have this ride in Derek’s name without a helmet

I just checked the weather for Carlsbad and Oceanside. Same rainy icon on Saturday. IF I show up I might just have to bring the Boosted XR since it's the only one I'm willing to ride in wet conditions (Don't judge)

@thisguyhere Did you & @joeadams101 @DevoCut want to stick with original plan? I’ll join since I needed to head up to LA later in the day anyway. So LA Beaches works well

I think Dave @psychotiller  might go to Carlsbad since that’s closer for him

@Exiledd_Top how about you!?

Looks like no LA county peeps are going. We should get another ride going soon, maybe Huntington or Newport Beadh which would be between everyone here.

RIP Derek, I know you used to come to the North Shore of Oahu for the surfing competitions.  Solo ride for you, from a place you used to love.
