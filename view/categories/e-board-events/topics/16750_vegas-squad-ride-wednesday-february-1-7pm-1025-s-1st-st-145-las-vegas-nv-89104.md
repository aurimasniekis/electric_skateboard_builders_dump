The later the better since the probability of me staying late  at work on our presentation day is good - so a late ride would ensure my being able to be a part of the cool kids ;)

I cant guarantee that I will get off at 6 - but its so nice to ride during the day - I hate punishing everyone with the cold just because I want to skate with you all - I went on my first day rides today in a long time since my schedule - so nice in the sun

You know I'm in this shit!  Yes! üòÇ  Later works a little better for me so the wife and kid can decompress a little after work/school.  If not it can be a shit show and everyone's in a mood.

Haha, he stopped by my crib to grab a spare motor belt after work that was around 7:15p.  He did say he's been swampped at work.  I may have a buddy on FB that I can also hit up.  Not a diy guy but willing to ride :slight_smile:

I used a 10s lipo and I know @KlethBane has a 12s.  I don't like taking it below 3.7v.  I'd say that's about 7-10 miles depending on how we ride.

Haha, man, I've had some bails on this board for the 4 years I had it.  But, adding a motor changes everything, LOL.  Note to self.  Get off the board if you are messing with your camera.  Such good times!  I can't wait till more :slight_smile:
