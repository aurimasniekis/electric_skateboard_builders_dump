Hey guys. So far we are a group that gets smaller all the time :frowning: sofar we are left with 3. Already found another driver from around zürich that would potentially join (@Howser). So I wanted to know if a few would like a stealthy group ride on some nice roads somewhere in central Switzerland.

Hello 

I am also from kanton zurich, but I do not live in the city, but near to it. I am currently a gymi student and I chose to build an electric longboard as my graduation work. If you like and if I am free, I'd like to join :slight_smile:
I've got a brother, who hasn't got an esk8, but would like to join as well if one of you has got another one which he could borrow, would be awesome. If not he could come with his unmotorized if that's possible...

Really looking forward to it :)

Good morning guys,
I'm returning to Zurich today and I hope I will have my board either already delivered or some day during this week. Depending on when you schedule the group ride and if i had some practice rides (my first time on an esk8) I would love to join.

congratulations! Will be like x-mas and birthday! Weather is beautiful too!!!!
Better to avoid the city on Saturday because of the street parade ... 

There might be an ad-hoc ride tonight, nothing else concretely planned. 

Suggest to PM your number to @michichopf, then he can add you to our whatsapp group.

Just to let the rest of the world know that there is a small but pretty active group in Zurich riding and having a good time: "the electric outlaws":-) 
Evolve GTs, Raptors, DYIs, hummies, old Evolves, singles, doubles, hubs, belt drives, top mounts, drop throughs, captn slow, some medium and a little bit of fast ... 

If you want to know more, just post here. 

If you want to join the rides, drop a PM with your phone number to @michichopf and he will add you to our whatsApp group as we don't want to promote our rides here. We are outlaws after all ... !

Hello everyone,
I'm new here and just wondering.
Is it true that riding esk8 in public area here in swiss is illegal?
```

Hello @Ghopapranawa,  welcome here.  

Esk8ing is legal in Switzerland,  but only if you are not caught.  :innocent:

There are no laws governing eskating,  so if you do get caught and the police is in a bad mood...  Your Case MIGHT end with a "verzeigung".  
Or you might get a minor ticket...

So far there have been cases of fines for esk8 of 450chf to 650chf (2 cases that i've heard of) and the case of our friend from the forum who got a 45CHF fine for normal longboarding.

I’m heading to Switzerland on June 22nd. Due to the difficulties with shipping battery, I plan to bring my Esk8 minus the battery pack and searching for a new or used 12s battery to use. It would be great to explore this beautiful “neutral” country on an Esk8. It may not be feasible as I cannot bring battery back with me.
