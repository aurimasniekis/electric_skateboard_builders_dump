Camping. No camping at the course. Camping will be at Daniel Engals property.

I just found out from Daniel that the rider camp will be at his house. Not on the hill. His house is about 30 minutes from the hill. Can you let the E boarders know so that there is no confusion. I guess there is no camping at the hill.

Daniels address is

Rider Camp: 620 Glenwood Ave Bakersfield CA 93305

We might want to have top speed range classes.  30 - 35, 35 - 40, etc. Really depends on how much time they give us. Might just be another 20 on the starting line. :grin: I'm fine with that. It's hella fun either way. :+1:

I‚Äôm totally stoked on how quick the roster is filling up. I will bring a generator in case anybody wants to bring their charger and charge up there batteries. I will also bring a couple gopros and an old fisheye handycam to pass off between riders during practice runs. Also I just bought a radar speed kit to set up on the hill somewhere. Not sure how it‚Äôs gonna work yet. But I will probably need a volunteer  to stand there and pull the trigger. Preferably across from one of the photographers. Also I will bring some rear foot stops if anybody wants to try them out before the race. ![image|631x493](upload://9EpQntbXOOGLUFOMQIOzbQiQggX.jpeg)

 This thing is pretty cool. It constantly update with new speed and will hold max speed.  But it definitely needs to have somebody with it on the hill because it automatically turns off after 10 minutes.

We're guests to the DH racers. They close the hill to traffic when the track has riders on it. It's not my place to say. You could talk to Daniel Engel the Promoter.

Fortunately the green leathers still fit and I am already used to getting low in the turns from a (relatively) high top-mount deck. Working on a metal remote with a slide puck on the bottom and a "rail-lifting" feature so I can grab rail AND put a puck down on both heel-side toe-side turns ...

Its an open road race. No turns tighter than a car can make.  Not familiar with your setup but, if your comfortable and confident in your current setup at top speed üëç.  If not there is work to be done. If your setup is unstable, dewedge the rear to 35deg, put 90a rear 85a front bushings and skate at the speed your comfortable with. Armour and a good brain bucket should be a priority.

For skateboarding on urethane wheels, downhill skateboarding with slide gloves and GS on steep hills are great ways to learn about riding at the edge of traction and beyond. For pneumatic tires you always have a motor and doing laps on both a tight and loose figure 8 course will give you an idea of what you and your board can do.

**Electronics:**

Skatronics is the working title of the electronics brand that Dave Dirickson and I will share. For now browsing to Skatronics.com will forward you to https://psychotiller.com/collections/battery-packs.

The plan is to put all of our electronics under the Skatronics brand so expect to see that on battery packs, motors, ESCs, remotes, and standard enclosures.

Dave puts together "Psychotiller" builds that include his SixShooter rims for pneumatic tires, pulleys, motor mounts, clamps, and custom enclosures.

**Trucks and Decks:**

We're about to launch a new series of HeXL precision trucks in both RKP and TKP setups. The most common hanger widths are 220mm and 240mm, but we can make them any width we want. Baseplate angle "splits" are available in both RKPs and TKPs. You heard that right. If you like how carvy TKPs are but don't like getting the wobs at high speed, try a 45¬∞/35¬∞ TKP front/back split. The TKP baseplates come in 30¬∞, 35¬∞, 40¬∞, 45¬∞, and 50¬∞. If you like how stable RKPs are but don't want too much rear steering, try a 50¬∞/30¬∞ RKP front/back split. The RKP baseplates come in 20¬∞, 25¬∞, 30¬∞, 35¬∞, 40¬∞, 45¬∞, and 50¬∞. All trucks allow for tall (.750") bushings but if you want to retard steering you can always use a standard (.600") bushing and a ThikCup (or other shim). All hangers use our hex clamps and basic motor mount plates.

You're going to see both Dave and me using two different versions of the Jet KillShot - a 38.0" for TKPs and a 40.5" for RKPs. The standing platforms are identical and have that nice "radial drop" bump that the outside of your feet can easily locate. The RKP deck has longer ends for a longer wheelbase because compared to TKPs, RKPs shorten the axle-to-axle wheelbase by more than an inch on each end and we don't want wheelbite.

```
Whether it's an RKP or a TKP, I always make sure that there's an elliptical cutout around the bushing seat so the hanger can lean without colliding with the sides of the bushings. It's amazing how many people screw up the design of a truck in this area.

There are a number of _good_ ways that you can "tighten up" and/or "stabilize" a truck:

* Use a firmer bushing durometer
* Use  shorter bushings
* Use larger diameter bushings
* Use cup washers instead of flat washers
* Use a baseplate with a shallower steering angle
* Use a rakeless or flipped (reverse rake) hanger
* Use wider hangers 

But with some designs you get part way into a turn and the hanger interferes with the side of the bushing, or the top (cup) washer collides with the hanger, or the hanger is sloppy and sloshes around the kingpin. Many designs don't allow for FatCat, Chubby, Fat Cone, Stimulator, Eliminator, Keg, or other step-diameter bushings.

When you combine a good bushing seat design with a good bushing, you have the most and best options available. My FatCat Bushing (patent pending) is the only bushing that fits the bushing seat properly AND changes the ride characteristics when you invert them. Note the problems highlighted in yellow at the bottom when you flip other bushings upside down. I can use the Fat/Fat configuration to stabilize the rear truck and a less restrictive configuration in the front to steer better. Brad Miller from Riptide poured the first prototype FatCats in 3 different duros. :arrows_clockwise:  With 6 _top_ bushing options (3 duros times 2 orientations) and 6 on the _bottom_, there are 36 options for the front truck and 36 for back for a total of 1,296 bushing options per board.

This is what I get with the surf rodz rkp and it starts irritating the hell out of me. If your new truck deals with that problem (from the picture it looks like it) and are as wide as the surf rodz (I have mine on my psycbotiller build with his shooters), then I am in for one of your first sets! :)

I mapped out the race on Google Maps and it looks like it's less than 1.5 miles. Does that sound right?

Camping. No camping at the course. Camping will be at Daniel Engals property.

I just found out from Daniel that the rider camp will be at his house. Not on the hill. His house is about 30 minutes from the hill. Can you let the E boarders know so that there is no confusion. I guess there is no camping at the hill. 

Daniels address is

Rider Camp: 
620 Glenwood Ave 
Bakersfield CA 93305

Awesome.
I've been in talks with a few different companies that do stuff for the downhill guys.
And while they are very interested in what we are doing they still see esk8 as boosted boards and meepos.
They aren't ready to invest into our Market until they see a bit more growth.

Great first day with a great group of people. It wouldn't have turned out so well if three of us hadn't been wearing full safety gear. Crashes on Esk8's are no joke! I walked away from mine, but wouldn't have without my full-face helmet, slide gloves, and level 2 full motorcycle body armor. I also got some great safety tips from other experienced riders, big thanks! If you like this sport and want to keep doing it, safety matters.

We had fun though and that's what we liked. Special thanks to Daniel and his family for opening up their pad that was really cool. More of these events all summer would be cool. Maybe I can convince hesperia.. I'll post the Revelwaukee rebuild after I nap for about a week haha. Sorry we had to leave so early. We had the family to get back to. Ride safe out there.

I get that, we weren't trying to compete either... but it would have been a waste to go and not even ride up the hill so we just stayed in the back and cruised. We certainly weren't there for any fame or just to be seen, it was just some fun. I think saying you were disappointed in us and stuff or criticizing our speed was uncalled for is all.

I really enjoyed watching and being a part of this with all of you. What an awesome group of people. I am honored to be racing with you all. eSk8 is anyone‚Äôs game. There are so many things that can go wrong for any one of us when riding these boards. I managed to crash on both practice runs. As good as the asphalt and mountain tasted, I am glad that we were all able to cross the finish line at race time. This 1st place bearing is for all of you and eSk8. 

This was only the 2nd uphill eSk8 race. I think it would be a good idea to give slower boards a head start depending on time trials. This way it would even out the odds at the finish line. The next race is at K1 speed center in Carlsbad. It is a super fun track that anyone with a 20-30 mph board can win.  My only suggestion would be to loosen up your trucks and practice some slalom in your local supermarket parking lot. So. Stay safe and let‚Äôs have some fun. 

 See you guys there.![image|690x459](upload://cJHHVrpL5lxakyIhX9INHABrWxQ.jpeg) ![image|374x500](upload://VbddmpIHppZybkgaKVqYANlugs.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://sb8l9UtHR8MABXGsYlZ1QchtZYU.jpeg) ![image|472x451](upload://c39Um45G4AEYOgmWHXvzU53d1SH.jpeg) ![image|690x459](upload://qMC4SkpIU6IqYoxxoBoQu6lNzMq.jpeg) ![image|690x459](upload://ccznSxjwdSjTclMGTj8fccxfWEG.jpeg)

Maybe inrunners should get their own race?

Why are inrunners not getting more love since they seem to outperform the usual outrunners?

Are they more expensive? Are these custom trucks the only ones that fit them?

Which board was in the inrunner first place?

I have often wondered the same.   Unfortunately  the current vesc based esc cannot handle the inrunners E-rpm.  Gearing options for Belts and chains would be difficult. They are more efficient and make more watts in a smaller package. There is a lot to love there. Just need a good delivery system to feed it and drive system handle it.

Stooge race Board V3. FWD took first. 

Stooge race Board V2. RWD took second. 

 I have had really good luck with both inrunner and outrunner motors with RC car ESC‚Äôs, not eSk8 esc‚Äôs. But I only tried one eSk8 esc, didn‚Äôt like it, and went back to RC. 

The main difference that I found is... in-runners really take a beating over outrunners when hitting road debris. As far as going fast it all boils down to your SETUP. Voltage, KV, gear ratio, wheel size and duro,  and of course the size of your balls are what makes a good fast board.  Outrunners dominated the podium at the Evolve World Cup 18 but that didn‚Äôt stop several people from running inrunners and really giving outrunners a run for there money. Stooge Race Boards was one of the top competitors for the gold. But like all e-boarding. Shit happens. Inrunners and outrunners both managed to make the podium in the last two uphill races. eSk8 really is anyone‚Äôs race.

I'm going to gather the pics and videos I did manage to get this week to make a video from. Unfortunately I spent more time working on my board than anything only to find out the my battery was fucked so I didn't get to ride it. So I spent more time drinking beer and hanging out. Got to meet a shitload of cool people!

The boyz talking about skate shit.

Psychotillers hotel room full of boards. I finally got to ride a couple of them and they're fucking nice.

Given that the event coordinators were perfectly okay with them tagging along for the ride, perhaps you should be as well, as a _spectator_. They weren't even on the roster, just there to have fun and experience a unique event. 

Your perception of their intentions are not their own.

Damn wish I would have just stopped in. I was passing Bakersfield on the 5 on Saturday and almost stopped in for the group ride.....instead kept going and got caught right behind the 30 car pile up on the grapevine. They ended up forcing us off the freeway at the base going up.

Ended up having to go backroads to the 58 through cow country.... ended up right next to the track almost but it was dark and I‚Äôm didn‚Äôt know if anyone would still be there

Found the culprit as to why I couldn't run the Bakers race. @DerelictRobot is fixing this shit right now so we can ride. There's always next time.

Good morning all, from the posts and discussions in the Cali outlaw series there are two things I would be really interested to see

1) A rules discussion for racing and possibly classification categories - perhaps by total weight of the setup and rider

2) A infogram that contrasts a great inrunner setup compared to a great outrunner setup, complete with wiring diagram, can someone here provide that?

One thing to think about would be speed bracket classes. 
Make a standing speed jig that can check wide open throttle wheel speed (mph) a board makes.  20mph 30mph 40mph bracket classes. Tech would be checked immediately at the top of the hill when a competitor finishes.  Disqualification would be when a riders board breaks out of their respective speed bracket when inspected post race.
