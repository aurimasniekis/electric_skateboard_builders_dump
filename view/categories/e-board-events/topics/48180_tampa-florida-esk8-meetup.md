I'm hosting a ride across the Courtney Campbell Causeway with the [Central Florida eSk8 Squad](https://www.facebook.com/groups/249507372223716/) on Saturday, March 17th. If you're in the Tampa Bay, Orlando, or Clearwater area, come on out for a (possibly) 10 mile ride. It should be a great time! Check out the FB event [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/786805144850390/).

Man! I was in Orlando last week with my Raptor 2, I was supposed to get my replacement battery pack but the guy that had it went out of town all of the sudden. So I'm bringing my board back to Lima without even ride it once :frowning:
