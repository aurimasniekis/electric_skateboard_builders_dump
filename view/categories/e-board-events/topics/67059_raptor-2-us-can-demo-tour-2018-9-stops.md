Hi all! I have been posting about it on our social pages for the last couple weeks, but I know not everyone has time to check the channels. 

Enertion is doing a US/CAN Tour soon! We'll be covering 9 cities, including the Esk8 Renegade event in Vegas next month.

The following is our event itinerary:

SEPTEMBER:
LA - Sept 15th
San Francisco - Sept 16th
Chicago - Sept 18th
New York City - Sept 22nd
Toronto - Sept 29th

OCTOBER:
Montreal - Oct 6th
Vancouver - Oct 14th
San Diego - October 18th
And finally Las Vegas, where we will be joining the Esk8 Renegade event. Oct 19th-21st.

Full event info on fb: https://www.facebook.com/enertion.boards/ (Go to events tab)

Jeff from Enertion will be joining me for the first two (LA,SF) and last two (SD,LV) events, so if you want to meet the guy who created the focbox unity, this is your chance. 

Bara, our head repair agent will be joining the Chicago event (naturally).

We'll also be joined by the LaCroix crew in New York and Montreal, if there's anyone also interested in meeting those guys as well!


There will be some small prizes to give out and we’ll also be organising night rides throughout the tour closer to the day of the events (or maybe even on the day).

Let me know if you've got any questions. Cheers!

I did purchase a raptor 2 and happy with the purchase so far. It’s didferent than my DIY board. Raptor has great starting torque and it was fun riding hub motors vs belt motors. The brakes are touchy but strong. Have a fun ride
