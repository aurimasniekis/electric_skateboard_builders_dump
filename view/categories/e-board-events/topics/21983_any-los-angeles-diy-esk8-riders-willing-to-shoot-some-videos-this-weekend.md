We went to downtown LA today and there are some nice bike paths. Lots of hills so dual is recommended. Well probably go again sometime next week

@saul @Titoxd10001 **Guys how about riding today at 5.30 PM - LA RIVER BIKE PATH.**   Would that work for you ?

Here is a map where we can start. We need some ugly industrial landscape for the movies :slight_smile:

didn't see this in time, 
but yea thats the path I was talking about. a few really smooth sections for speed runs.

up the hill on elysian park is my new favorite spot, but you need a belt drive or dual.

Me and another guy did the Riverside run on your map yesterday at 3:30 pm. There is a hell of a whoop section about 1.5 miles in to it. Section of tree roots under the asphalt. Definitely an under 20mph section. Fun watching him get through it over 20. Saw a coupla e-boarders going the opposite direction, a fun run for sure.

Sounds awesome. All I am really looking for is some bridges and lot's of concrete. No greens, trees or any of the sort. 
So is there anyone who is down for riding on Thursday ? Let's shoot a nice video boys.

@saul did you by chance ride through chinatown last weekend? saw someone going down broadway going east.

i'm in downtown but super swamped this week and weekend.

i also saw someone on an eboard with pneumatic wheels bombing up temple a week or so ago...i wonder if you're here too...?
