Talking with DH promoter/skater Ryan Farmer about an uphill race/freeride at his DH event January 2019. It's a great opportunity to build a bridge between communities and use a closed course for fun and competition.  Ryan is onboard and likes the idea. I need individuals committed in order for it to work.   https://m.facebook.com/events/433405593843526.     ![Screenshot_20181026-110143|281x500](upload://mDlbL9YwebBrt2OQBG521tEbJNK.jpeg)

Camping yes! Promoter (Ryan Farmer) said. Yeah you can, just show a little early to figure out a good spot. Camping is at the cafe but not sure if there will be room out back there, depends how long it is.  Maybe the side of the cafe there's a big lot, if not there you can at the race course it's like quarter mile up the highway.   
There are also state park campsites near by.

Thanks my brother, I appreciate that.  

Would like to be one of your first Stooge Slicks customers, that's for certain.

This 13S Evo can scoot like Markus' new board, yet it is simply beyond my level of skill to keep this board as stable as @mackann demonstrates.

Changing over to @OllinBoardCompany Ronins to see if we can smooth it out a little. Will start a build thread.

Thanks again, sincerely appreciated.

Was my thought at one time, but I‚Äôve recently been putting my new build through it‚Äôs paces and high 30s feels nuts on a straight smooth road. I don‚Äôt think I have the amps on a 12s7p 30q pack to power 14k watts worth of outrunners. I‚Äôm happy being pretty damn fast, but not the fastest for now.

Yup. Those double king pin trucks are not made for speed. Go split angle on the Surfrodz RKP's if you want to be stable at speed. I have 50 in front and 45 in the back. Super stable at 30mph on the Redember Obeah.

Man, I think I need to hold off my surgery for this. The more I see this, the better it‚Äôs looking. I can‚Äôt miss this history.

The question is what should the next motors I build focus on?

My only issue with uphill racing is it‚Äôs all going to be about who can go the fastest. Acceleration can be garbage and you can still win.

Without full leathers, it‚Äôs suicide to go above 40 mph, and dangerous above 30 mph. How many people here have full leathers?

I would assume there's going to be more than a few switchbacks and acceleration is still going to play a big key, unless it's just a long straight away uphill. which I doubt.

If you look at it, it‚Äôs about 10 kv change per turn. I‚Äôm looking for about 100kv. If you look at it, I‚Äôm going to do 2 less turns and shrinking down the stator should shorten the wire also, which will increase the kv also.

Can't wait for this though!

Edit: although I do what the overall shape of it finally:

![image|666x500](upload://yi2G6pmUljzfEfa35KqVs9GEtbm.jpeg)

12s 25ah battery is ready, as is diebiems. Just need escs... why does frank have to charge so much? I push a trampa  vesc6 in my ebike (after breaking 3 flipsky6.6‚Äôs) and it‚Äôs put up with 60a con no issues. 80a con though and it‚Äôll over heat after about 2 miles uphill. So I‚Äôm hoping to get 240a total for 12 kw of juice.

Hard. I was doing 80a con for miles at a time. I did the same with the trampa vesc 6, it would overheat, as did the 6.6, but it has been good for at least 1500 miles so far (I do over 50 miles per day for work on it). The 6.6's all lasted about 200-300 miles each,

My actual voltage is 52.4 full charge also, a bit higher than 12s because of the odd voltages of headwat cells.

Each are seeing around 4000 watts con for miles at a time.

This thing is taking off now. Is becoming our own Pikes Peak, Monaco GPrix or Indy500!

Dude what's the diam of your stator BTW?
@Hummie what's yours too? Are you packing 40/50/60mm diam stator ?

I'm trying to check if my Franken motors would be beefy enough or not. Or if they need big brothers. Diameter at this tiny size plays a lot about torque output and heat saturation, right?

 I use hummie hubs. I invested with hummie to help get these motors made, and as such, I'm lucky to be able to work with him to build custom stuff. He still owes me quite a bit (but it's cool, I love seeing where they are going), but I just keep telling him just get me parts to make more motors haha.

The stator is a 4752. It's not the biggest diameter but it makes up with the length.

I'm still not sure how length plays into cooling. Jason said a while back longer stators will have more heat issues. I don't honestly know if that's true or not, since I haven't had any heat issues with my v4 hummie hubs. I'm so glad they are finally getting out the door and people are experiencing what quality can deliver!

I see the idea, but I see the line blurring a lot. I think if you had a baja board show up for example (cough cough), it would be game over for everyone else in the production class sine it's a decently sized 4wd vs 2wd boards.

If I managed to get a 4wd hummie hub board into "small" production, would that then quality as a production board? I feel like the line is a bit blurry, that's all.

I think everyone should just go at it together and compare the results at the end for what it is. Give a prize though to the fastest production board, like how evolve gave a prize for the fastest single lap.

I think classes as a whole are tricky, because it's like comparing apples to oranges. Board A could be 12k watts, with a top speed of 40mph, and board B has 6k watts with a top speed of 25mph. The 2 are really in a different place, but how do you split them apart?

My advice, just build the fastest, most powerful death stick you can and bring it to the hill, haha.

When companys vest an Intrest in racing competition it drives markets and innovation.  Yes, I would run as a group with the small # of boards in this first of a kind event. Separating into two heats may  be better. Having a podium for the production boards is a necessity.  Gonna be a great weekend of running and bombing the hill.

How many classes should be at those races? How about.... 

**Unlimited** ...for highly customized boards (Stooge, etc)
**Heavy** ...for standard production AT boards (Baja, Velox, etc)
**Production** ...for standard production boards (Hoyt, Ollin, LaCroix, Enertion, Evolve, etc)

Probably best to keep it to one class for now and then make changes if needed after this event. For instance, our "production" board tops out well over 40 mph.

Eventually I think we should have classes based on battery size, similar to displacement classes in motorcycle racing. Any other class designations should be for the level of the riders proficiency.

 I agree with class racing but, I do not believe battery  size should determine class by it self. There are so many different variables. Wheel size, gearing, motor Kv, wattage.  We should probably use something like that Esk8 calculator  and put people in class by  calculated top speed in miles per hour .  Plus or  minus   One.

 But one thing I learned at the evolve world cup is you‚Äôre only as fast as the course will let you be . A 50 mile an hour board can only go so fast around a hairpin turn.

No. It is the same angle as my 1st gen  landyachtz EVO. It is just a little higher for heal support under hard throttle. For hard braking I use a front foot stop. Together they help a lot. I‚Äôll bring some to Barrett. You can try it out. Or PM me. I only have a couple left in stock.

Your right, It is an old Shoei motorcycle helmet. Great helmet to protect your brain. Especially on a motorcycle. Not the best for esk8. But, When I first started doing 50mph speed runs on the e-board, I knew I needed something better than my protec, half dome, skate helmet. So the Shoei is what I ended up with. 
Skateboarding has come a long way in the last 7 years. There are several full face helmets out that are light weight, full face, and offer more visibility than motorcycle helmets, that are perfect for skating. Right now I use a skydiving helmet. It is ok for a full face helmet that offers a lot of visibility. I don‚Äôt think I would want to crash at freeway speeds with it. But it works fine for cruising around at moped speed.  ![image|666x500](upload://bgmKsfu2kHwlbwRAsjJ1NFnlh2K.jpeg)

It's not always about winning. I personally think no one will be able to beat moe and his crazy boards. I don't think I will win. But I don't care. It's more about participating in an eskate event that will be historic for the industry and getting to ride with the socal crew again! It should be fun, even without a win. Though I'd love to win. Based on what moe's told me about the trials he's done in the past in going uphill, you won't have a chance if you can't do at least 40 mph. And I'm maxing out at around 30 mph.

I feel more competitive in track racing, where it's not all about your top speed. It's more about torque and the riders ability to turn on a board. This event will be more about who has a fastest board that they can stay on imo.

Wish you were making the trip.  Win or lose this first ever event (for me ) is about testing and learning. Talked with Max Capps today about the Course. There are speed sections on the bottom but the majority of the course will be at 30ish mph.  There will be hotlaps and riding on Sunday as well. This is an opportunity to  bridge build between DH and Esk8.  With the music, food, racing and beer this event alone will be worth the trip.  Hope you change your mind. Hope to see you there.

Front drive. With the weight removed from the rear axel the truck can recover more efficiently increasing overall stability.  Braking grip is more efficient. Downside is Heavy accel under 20mph will break traction.

Recover from a turn I guess. . With the front truck doing most of the turning I‚Äôd think w that logic id want to have the motors on rear truck since the rear truck turns less.   

Possibly the truck being heavier would give more stability and you‚Äôd want that weight especially on the truck that is doing most of the turning.  And since we turn with the front the most front drive gives best stability. Heavier weights at the end of the axle like with hub motors especially would work to counter any input. Any input from rider or road would be smoothened.  

With weights it would reduce how fast you could turn ultimate but in realistic use with the added stability at least better for non-racing at the .001sec. Maybe. 



. I think this is why I‚Äôve never gotten a speed wobble w front wheel drive.  It would have to get some really big forces to flip the hanger back and forth vs a light weight truck n wheels with the same tightness of bushings

Thanks Mo! My issues were a ground loop I hadn't noticed in my bms, it was throwing over current faults when hitting the brakes at only low speeds. Fixed that with a newer smaller version with no possibility of ground loops. 

Then I'm testing a couple of the new maytech dual's and somehow they burn out two receivers! I confirmed that today with a second set of flipsky 6.6's. Not getting any ppm signal in the vesc even though the light is on confirming bind(that offbrand mini remote). So now I'm waiting for a set of g2b's to come in so I can get rolling.  Its driving me crazy how much work I've done on this build and little mistakes like this bring me to a screeching halt. No worries though I'm confident we can be rolling this week. Btw do we pay now or at the track on race day?

Weight of an object determines recovery time. A weighted object needs more opposing force to self right. Instability comes from the rear.  If a weighted hanger begins ocillating vs a lightweight hanger. The light weight hanger will be easier to recover.  With the drive dynamic removed from the rear it simplifies the function of the rear hanger for high speed application and allows it to do it's job which is to track with the front hanger. Not saying rear drive is bad. But if your objective is to go fast and straight a lightweight rear hanger is better than a driven heavy one.

A weighted object would also need more force to get out of line to begin with though. 

Why you say instability comes from the rear?  I feel like many things could cause instability and the front could also be responsible.  it seems you‚Äôre more likely to become unstable due to the front truck as it is more maneuverable.  All in theory

...and there's Mt. Hamilton ascend (4.200 ft.), the grand daddy of them all, south of the bay, east of SJ (by Alum Rock Av.). 25 miles of the most beautiful scenery in the BA, mostly empty road and the last segment the stepest and technical incline with alpine type gradient to ultimately reach Lick Astronomic Observatory where you can see a vast portion of California for miles. Been there, is spectacular!

I can‚Äôt get away with last second dodges and cuts in city traffic that otherwise make a fairly quick street board fun and faster than a car. 

True, I do have to have the suspension tightened up to hold anything over 30 without getting wobbles and hard breaking dips the front if you aren‚Äôt braced for it well before. 

 It doesn‚Äôt fit in my car, and I feel stupid ubering to off-road areas where it really shines. I know, drive a more practical car.

It has been a bad couple months for my DIY eboads. The GMR M80 pictured is still sitting on the shelf. The motor I had quit and the replacement did not arrive in time. I ended up riding for Stooge Race Boards. Barrett Junction is not an easy hill for any board or rider. I have a lot of respect for anyone willing to battle that hill up, or down. Stay STOKED my friends and I‚Äôll see you at the next hill.

I agree that the starting line was way too narrow. Seems that it wasn't actually a single line but multiple layers, therefore the guys in the front line get an advantage.

I'm wondering why this group wasn't split into two, have two heats, then a final run? Probably a lot safer too.

Really doesn't seem fair for the guys in the back.... Unless they have a @MoeStooge build

@onloop Agreed. It was pretty stacked up, we had a few riders nearly colliding right on the take off. 

That entire track was fuckin rowdy though, the start was the least of most people's worries I'd imagine. Those final hairpins are certified butthole puckering.

Would like to speak on J-Morgans behalf.  Track had bad and treacherous race lines. There were spots where the surface would washboard,  literally creating an air gap between your feet and the board.  Talking with Max Capps there is a race line that needed to be followed to have the best surface possible. Experience payed to know the track. Justin and Jason had a heads up race all the way till the last 3 turns of the 1.8 mile course. Justin saw a gap open on the outside near the ravine and made his move. Bad Surface sent him off course and down the ravine. Justin said he caught a power pole and stopped him. No broken bones or sprains. Spoke with him last night, he's doing well. This course was difficult and technical. Call it a lack of experience or  bad luck, I can say it takes a person with grit to try and pull off a pass like that in these conditions. When he could taste victory he pushed out of the comfort zone. Justin has committed to run the Bakersfield Up and I feel he will be hard to beat on that RedEmber 44" Woodie. Pics by Brad T Miller

Indeed we are lucky to get as much as we do. Hopefully sometime in the future we can get another uphill race near San Francisco. San Diego is at least 8 hours south and Maryhill loop is much farther. Long state. But yes I know we have to share.

those cart tracks look hella dangerous to me.   if I wanted to actually go as fast as I can around turns theres a good chance I could slide out or fall off and those barriers on the side look like theyre for low to the ground karts that have people buckled in and not standing bodies.   we need a track like they do in formula one or something where we can slide out and  not into a barrier or a pole.    I think only a mater of time before someone gets really hurt.   At least on a road their might be shoulder or ...Id rather fall off a small cliff than hit a barrier or pole.   If the guy who went off the cliff in this race had hit a pole or barrier it could be seriously a downer for the event and the sport and of course him.

The guy went off the cliff and a power pole saved him.  Ironic.

Well I think a dorsal + full gear on this type of kart track (note that there are more corners than straights) means short bursts of acceleration and no higher speed really. This should be fun and technic, plus you get lot of torque to play with. 

A cliff is deadly too, lucky for the rider who caught the pole. Don't know much about Junction race but around my town cliff falls means game over.

But I get your point, a track with wide borders to slide in case one falls is definitely safer.

It was actually a really sweet run but you had to stick to the good sections. I'm going back next year just to ride the road if nothing else. With that being said, the road isn't for everyone. You need to enjoy challenging conditions to get a thrill out of a road like this.

I also have a larger "race drone" that carries a gimbal + GoPro on the nose.  It gets some pretty smooth footage while still being able to fly through tight spaces.  

The challenge with a curvy road course is that I can lose video feed if my drone goes behind a large obstacle.  I'd need to find a spot to fly from that provides an unobstructed view of the course.

Where is this bakers race going to be held at?

Too bad @psychotiller ‚Äòs poor action cam didn‚Äôt survive the practice run with me behind @JAYSTCB. It would have recorded a jump off the stooge board front, tumble underneath and a bounce into my chest after. 

I was responsible for breaking the cam that preceded it. The least I could have done was try to grab it. (I thought it was chunks of kicked up asphalt)    üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I was expecting the road to be much worse than it actually was. The biggest surprise for me was finding that a wider wheel did better than a large diameter wheel. My thinking is the wider wheels are able to stay above the valleys because they can reach more peaks.
