Not sure of anyone's schedule and the temps at night are getting better...

I'd like to plan a group ride for September so we can put in our calender.

Plan is to start at the Stratosphere and head down to Downtown....buzz the tourists ... And make our way back to the Crown & Anchor in the Art District for some drinks

This is open to anyone that will be here when we pick a date.

Once we pick a date I'll post up on Craigslist to invite maybe more DIYers or boosted or evolve owners

If it's a Saturday or Sunday night I'll be there. 
I think it's important that I tell you all that I was stopped by an unmarked cop downtown last week on my way to work. Since we are going to be in that area, it's important that we have bright colored clothing and a tail light mounted on your arm or head. 
We don't need to stay on the sidewalk, but even at a DEAD four way stop all traffic laws must be followed.

Lol well if you go against lights...walking, biking or skating they are gonna stop you ...and I got stopped with party lights and everything....why because I went through lights ...but that was to get away from an accident scene ....
I don't wear any lights except on the board...passed a million cops and never a problem .....

As long as we aren't breaking laws ... We will be solid

Edit: and for sure I ride more reckless than you ... I almost never ride sidewalks....

```
The sidewalks have the best waves though. Honestly, I think any electric mobility device faster than 10mph should not be allowed on any sidewalk for the safety of the pedestrians, but having power means explaining power, and I will not break the illusion with local pd that my device is essentially a toy. This is why we are allowed on the sidewalks of the strip as long as we move at walking speed, but that's no fun.
