Recently arrived in Munich with a couple of friends while doing a Euro Trip and was wondering if there were any e-skaters in Munich who are up for grabbing a couple of beers and having a good time? :)

There was a pretty good Mexican restaurant when I was there...I wonder if it's still there? 

If it is...it's pretty good!

as a starter for a night out and for someone who never been to munich before I suggest a visit @ http://www.hofbraeuhaus.de/ it's super touristic but to the same there is always a bunch of locals hanging out too :D not to forget that they will serve you a beer in a proper glass and some fat food which makes a good base for more beer!
