I think I'm actually going to make it to San Francisco for the Raptor 2 Demo on Sunday. Anybody else going?

i'll be there.  it's literally 3 blocks from my house.  just checked on the location and especially tomorrow that area beside the road is designated as a roller skating only area and will the packed with rollerskaters if it's nice out.     If doing ovals at 5mph with elderly rollerskaters looks like fun keep it to a few laps max as they will get snappy

I might go. Doesn't look like I can rewind these motors fast enough though. Winding motors is harder than I thought. I wish I had another week, or saw this earlier than 6 days before, lol.

Cool. Looks like there will be at least a handful of us there. I'm gonna try to get there around 1:00ish. Should we do a little informal group ride after the demo? Like around 2:30-3:00 or something? I still have yet to ride with another actual human esk8er. Lol.

There was a "bay are eboarders" group as well before the one I made, but they don't seem to be active as my request has been pending for weeks.

Winding isn't hard but taking the old stuff off is.  
@Jinra
All are rewound from the root cause of  magnet wire to motor lead connections that weren't secured well enough and broke

Might rewind it in time but be there regardless.  And will bring a carbon/wood deck I've been getting made with a 13mm cavity on the bottom  if anyone is <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/2/025604e0f5fc271014524b4324260b8b38c3a7f7.jpg" width="666" height="500">interested. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/4/14a634a99485d119a6f312e8b08b7d06ff3e622d.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/3/43e357540641097b762033580a4adea414389cfe.jpg" width="375" height="500">

[quote="Jinra, post:10, topic:29787, full:true"]
What are you rewinding for?
[/quote]

Was trying to rewind for today so I could race the raptor 2 today, but it is taking too much time right now.

Once I'm done winding, I need to doing a thin epoxy coat and then, sensoring them all will take a full 8 hour day. All in all, I'll be done by mid week likely.

If the kv is too far off the first motor from the rest, I'll have to rewind that too. The resistance should have been lower than before, as I aimed for 27 turns, though I think some are 28, some are 25. The second motor, I was more consistent and accurate.

I'll post some pictures when I have a chance. Not sure If I'm going as I have a bunch of friends going white water rafting today at Russian river. The only reason I wanted to go was to see the raptor 2's power vs hummies motors. And since I can't, eh...

I had to rewind 2 motors because the enamel finally broke down and a wire in each motor broke, causing a short.

I figured while I was at it, might as well do the other 2 also. Good chance to put in higher heat motor wire and I can hopefully raise the kv to around 100 kv, which should get me up to 30 mph with the 83mm wheels, instead of hte 26 mph that 80 kv does.

I was bummed last week when I lost a drv on a speed controller the night before the long beach event but I still had a great time. You should definately still go if for nothing else than to meet Jinra, hummie and the other local guys and test out the Raptor 2!

What a nice board!  By far the best hub motors I have ever rode. Huge battery. Great turn out.

My kv was too high to hold a candle to the gt and raptor's acceleration, but at least i still came out on top with speed!

Yep passed both boards by about 50m. Moja said my board was one of the nicest boards he's ridden which was a great compliment for me, haha.

I definitely had way too much fun riding @Jinra board. I could feel that the settings were well worked out. 

Overall, I was surprised by the power of the raptor 2. It blows any other production board away.

I don't doubt that it can be beat. It's powerful though. I can't wait to see how hummies hubs compare now in terms of acceleration. I think that wide contact patch really helps  transfer the power to the ground (as does 4wd), and 4wd with wide contact patch will hopefully be amazing.

It was good to see everyone too. Nice to meet you @Moja
