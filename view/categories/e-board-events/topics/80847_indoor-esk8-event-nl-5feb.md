I would love to go there but it's a pitty that it is outside the holiday period and during the week. I'll probably take a day off to make it there. @rey8801 @pjotr47 will you also go to the Fatdaddy event? It's not that far from home :slight_smile:

I would also prefer during the week but  taking a day off shoudln't be an issue for me. If it is the same track as on the incoor karting's site then it looks really really nice btw...

Really nice truck. I think that bindings would help a lot for sharp turns

Haha, I'll definitely come :) I hope my trampa is ready. I am still waiting on parts :/ 
If somebody wants to go and have no car; I can pick up you around brussels / antwerp

@davidbonde It is just making some fun, No competition only riding, talking and eat/drink 

Because it is in the week it is difficult, In the weekend it was unpossible or we must pay a huge amount off money. Now it's only 12.5euro the person ;)

Hi guys. I am the guy thats been arranging it so far. Tijl (fatdaddy owner) has really given it the extra touch we needed to make it a big event. There will be NO racing because of safty rules.
Its a fun day riding i am sure there will be some who want to race but we can talk about that on the day its self. I would like as many people as possible to etend and be helping funders of this amazing event. There will be tech tips and advice about many things. Possibilities to test boards and meet other esk8ers. If u have any questions just ask but allso inrole and help fund this event and join us in the whatsapp kart track groep. More info will follow in that chat groep from this thursday after i have spoken to jack owner of the kart track.
Remember guys safety first
Cheers aaron aka (tricky)

There wasn't really anything to say bad about this.
Track was good ("Watch your head!!!" and of course wood is a bit more slippy), turns were doable, clean surface,... Edit: of course there was that one or 2 guys that dove into the pavement (I see he liked one of my posts already hehe), but just a few scratches (our Evolve Belgium guy was lucky he was wearing a full face helmet though)

People working there (on their DAY OFF!) were very friendly.
Participants were friendly (I left most of my stuff unguarded and all over the place.. still have all :smiley:) and in my eyes really paid attention to each other.
I was able to test some boards I would never consider buying or testing (was impressed by the Riptide by the way, Evolve was nice too (that remote though), my buddy liked the TeamGee,..)

I could do this for a living hahaha Sk8 all day :laughing:

Cool event..(saw awesome facebook pics) didnt know fatdaddy had such major eboard store in EU.. I guess we dont get to hear about it on here since it is not as diy oriented, as it is for pre-builts..

Non the less.. nice work organizing such event and hosting and operating such eboard store also..
