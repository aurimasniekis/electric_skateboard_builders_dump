Hey folks,
everytime i have the problem that i do not know which user lives in my near area... I thought it would be a great idea to create a map with all active users of this community.

https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1ThkzkzXa5nLdO4Po8Bp7VSDnWGQ

**Please feel free and insert your location with your nickname!**

If you do not know how to add your address to the map then just watch this little video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7azoaTtRjYc

That way we can better build squads ;)

I hope many people will insert their location.

Off topic:
I really don't like the UI of the ZeeMaps, I can't zoom using mousewheel and so on.
We could use native Google Maps feature for that ( https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/ ), what do you think ?

Use Double Click for zoom and right Click for reverse zoom. If you want to make something else you are free to do it. 
Imo this map is sufficient. It does all what we need ;)

You are right, it's sufficient, but if we could improve it, why not?
I have migrated the map to the Google Maps, feel free to use it:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ThkzkzXa5nLdO4Po8Bp7VSDnWGQ&usp=sharing

Everyone has access to modify the map, just add your markers.
There was, however, a problem with migrating few users, there is a list:

If anyone of you likes this software more than a ZeeMaps, please add your markers manually.

I have already changed the link in my first post. I just have used zeemaps because it was the first result for me. I did not want to spend time on finding the perfect map because i have no time atm.

(a little teaser: I / the esk8 database team will publish the database in the next days when everything works as planned)

So i like you engagement very much for finding a better map :thumbsup:

Hi, just go to https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ThkzkzXa5nLdO4Po8Bp7VSDnWGQ&usp=sharing
Then, find the location you like and click the button with marker icon under the search bar.
Then just click wherever you want. It will create the market for you. You can then edit and rename it, upload img etc.

I will upload a video ( tutorial ) how to do that soon.

If he is doing exactly what I did in the video, then I  cant really give him any other advice, I can add the marker for him once I get on my PC. 

Others have not reported any problems and added their markers without any problem, I dont know why it does not work for him :/

Maybe a idea to convert the locations to a area close to them or something.

Not sure if that made sense, but esk8 aren't the cheapest. You can see people their adress right on the map and you know. People with bad intentions could just look on the map and rob people. Probably won't happen but just the idea behind it. Also privacy i guess.

Just place your marker in the middle of the city for example, like I did.
You don't have to place it right next to your house.
It's up to you if you want to share this information.

I'm just manually converting your data, removing all the data from the table and converting it to coordinates.
Why? Because current map is using two different location identification systems.
The first one is based on the address provided in the table ( export from old map ).
The second one is based on the coordinates ( created by Google Maps ).
I'm currently merging those together so I can remove all the fields and not have duplicates.
This will make it much harder for anyone to easily export your locations to human-readble text.
Better for your privacy, but the data can't be used for anything else than showing markers on the map.
It's taking a lot of time tho as most of the job is done manually by editing the XML ( KML ) file.
Gonna update the map soon. All the changes that were done after midnight ( last hour ) will be lost.

After about an hour of work, I finally converted all the data. *Pheew*.
This was harder than I expected, there are literary no tools for that ( probably very specific "problem" ).

Some stats:
18 regular expressions written for parsing the data in different formats
4 different formats of data used during the process of convertion
~ 300 HTTP requests sent to Google ( developer API, used to transfer CSV locations to coordinates )
2 cups of coffee drinked
```

Hey guys,

I've lurked on this forum off an on for a while and just found this thread. I ended up buying an Evolve board earlier this year just because it's what was easiest for me to get a hold of in the UK and I didn't feel confident in building my own.

A few months after starting to ride I made an forum for evolve owners and e-skateboarders in general. As a part of that we've also got a map section that some of you may find useful for finding and getting in contact with other riders nearby.

https://evolveforums.com/usermap

Some more detailed info about it here

https://evolveforums.com/threads/member-map-browse-the-globe-for-other-electric-skateboarders.178/

We also have an events section if you want to setup local events that you can invite riders to, and they can RSVP. There's a lot of us based around London and we've had a few custom build riders join us. I've just noticed that @mrjonnyjones is on here! We also get a suprising amount of Scottish riders making the trip down south to lots of our meetups, and I see a few scots looking for others on this thread.

Even though it's called Evolve Forums we welcome any e-board riders. We've got a fair few boosted owners, mellow board, and a few other board brand names I've seen thrown about along with some cool custom builds. It doesn't matter what board the others have once you get cruising :sunglasses:

I apologies mods if this comes across as spammy at all, it's not my intention at all. I hope it's not against the rules, I just wanted to share the map in case anyone finds it a useful tool to help find a riding buddy nearby seeing as there's still not that many of us about.

I've added myself to your map too @DeathCookies! I love the icon you've used for all the riders :smiley: I need to look into doing something like that.

:slight_smile:

Nope, I've bumped into them a few times and they've always been cool.

Once I was with a group, the police asked me to get off and walk as it was technically a pedestrianised area, then they saw the rest of the eboarders were heading off into the distance and so they said 'Ah forget it, off ya go', and let me ride away :slight_smile:

I find that as long as you ride safely and considerately to those around you, they won't give you any hassle.

Ok, cool! As of this moment it is 4s 7600mah 290kv motor, and a cheap esc. I'm upgrading it to 6s tomorrow tho, when I receive another battery. Also in a week or so, I'll receive a VESC, and will upgrad to that.

Last time I tested it did about 25 km/h and had a range of about 20 km.

I know of a couple more ppl building their boards in Malmö right now btw!

Looks good! Nice enclosure! whats that motor mount?
I will be making mine, currently experimenting in how. Just shaped one using a heatgun. Was hard alot of work and didnt turn out perfect. Also messed up abit. (Dropped heatgun so it landed and melted the plastic :( And my saws blade killed one edge of it. 

Gotta have 2 enclosures due to my flexy board..

I still gotta shape it / smoothen the edges etc, but was first try...

I have a new Evolve Carbon GT 2 in 1, and I have been having a lot of fun with it.  I like building things, and tend to build a bunch of stuff for fun.  Over the years I've built a tube guitar practice amplifier from schematics, a bunch of little ham radio kits, RC planes and helis, and most recently a laminated modern long bow (archery).  Making my own electric longboard just seems like it would be a fun project.  

I have been using my Carbon GT mostly for fun, but I can foresee a few applications as a platform to get some cool camera shots from.  I'm a motion picture and TV director of photography.

Great idea guys! I've wanted to do something like this for a while now but finding the time to get stuff like this done is a bit of a mission sometimes!

Well done for putting in the time & effort!! :nerd_face: I like the skateboarder pin design; was this your own creation?

I think this thread should definitely be a sticky for all to see if it isn't already!!

I have added my location on the map although I have not completed any esk8 builds atm; Just a small initial thought but maybe there could be an extra pin option added on the map to represent 'esk8 Riders' who have completed at least one build? (e.g. A green skateboarder pin?)

Consider this a BUMP for the topic! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Hi guys, I would like to kindly ask you to enter your nicknames in a format [a-zA-Z0-9_-]{3,30} or in other words: use alphanumeric characters ( uppercase allowed ), underscores and dashes, min. length 3, max. length 30.

If you already entered a name that doesn't follow this format, please edit it.

When I started the map we currently use, I never expected it to grow that big. Now, I'm working on a better platform for our map ( it will be open source, written in Java ( backend ) and Angular ( frontend ) ) and I will convert illegal characters ( including spaces ) to underscores. This is needed so the URLs ( map.esk8.xyz/rider/{nickname} ) work properly.

Hope you can understand.

Hi, just an update on the new map.
The progress is slower than I would like it to be, mainly because I have very little free time lately.
The application server has been deployed and is running.
Source code for the server is already available on GitLab: https://gitlab.com/esk8portal/esk8-server

Temporary viewer: http://map.esk8.xyz
An UI to add new rider location will be available soon.
More advanced functionality will be available later, once the frontend is properly coded because as of now, it's mostly hacked together in a plain JavaScript. Any help with the frontend would be highly appriciated!

Feedback or feature requests are welcome.
```

You can now add yourself to the new esk8 map!
Just right click anywhere on the map, enter your nickname, send the form and you're golden!
You can add more details like description or images if you wish. Some of the bbcode tags are supported.
Looking for someone? Use the search functionality in the top left corner!
Do you prefer different kind of map? You can choose between multiple maps in the top right corner.
Anything missing you would like to have there? Just let me know.

https://map.esk8.xyz - faster, more secure and easier to use than ever before

It's faster - lightweight UI, less data transfers, no unnecessary and confusing functionality
It's more secure - nobody can mess with the whole map anymore
It's easier to use - explore, search or add yourself in seconds without a hassle with this new, minimalistic UI

All riders added by Sept 9 have been migrated to the new map automatically ( with some manual work ), there is no need to do anything if you already added yourself before. Because these markers have no email assigned to them, you will not be able to modify them. You can PM me if you want to claim the marker.

Marker modification functionality is still in progress, it will be available soon.

Old map has been deprecated at this point.

Hi, thanks for the feedback.

I don't quite understand though.
If you enter invalid nickname, you will get an alert telling you so ( unless you disabled alerts for the page ).

/rider/{nickname} URLs are not implemented yet on the client side and the whole UX needs to be improved.

I havn't had enough time lately to do that but as soon as I have some spare time, I will rewrite the thing to angular and finish the UI, including the ability to modify the marker ( if email was provided ) and better search ( or GIS features in general ).

So when I tried to add myself I entered my username from the site. added my email but had no idea what to input for the URL. wasn't till I saw that post that it was clear to me at least that I needed to follow that format. Hope that helps. I wish we could get this added as part of the site as a whole. even if it was more general. I have my city and state added to my account profile and it would be awesome of we could pull that info from the site to populate the info on the map in order to see how many people  are near you. It was kinda depressing to see that the next closest builder/rider is 50 miles away lol

By entering the location, I can reverse-geocode the town, county, state, country, etc. - thus no need to enter it.

If you don't want to share the exact location, just put the marker somewhere in the middle of a town ( like I and many other people did ).

You will be able to lookup riders by the areas I mentioned above, this will be a part of the GIS.

As for the URL, it's explained in the modal. Your nickname in a rider modal will become a link to this address - you can put your profile URL, instagram URL or whatever URL you want there.

The required URL pattern: https://gitlab.com/esk8portal/esk8-server/blob/master/src/main/java/xyz/esk8/portal/util/RegexPattern.java#L4

The explanation you quoted was unrelated to this.

Thanks for the detailed report!

Okay, now I see what's the problem with the URLs.
Domain `.builders` is not a recognized as a valid TLD due to it's length - will fix this now.

About the modal - I know about this issue although I havn't decided how to fix it yet.
I think I will just create a modal that will slide from the side covering 1/3 of the map and display the selected location by rendering a marker on the coordinates that the user clicked. Still havn't figured out how to deal with mobile devices, will need to think more about it.

Are you using the new map software available on https://map.esk8.xyz?

The first post wasn't updated for quite a while and we switched from Google My Maps ( which has no permission system ) to this solution due to vandalism and people not knowing how to use the GMM properly, causing me headaches.

@DeathCookies could you update the first post, please?

Could be, although the old map includes an information about its deprecation since the launch of the new one, maybe I need to make it a bit more clear.

Hi, I do apologize, the software can't do that yet.

I will implement this functionality tomorrow, user will be able to update it in a similar fashion to changing a password - you will receive a link to change it to your email address ( if you provided any - if you didn't, let me know and I will assign it in the software ).

Web client should receive an update too!

Hi, I unfortunatelly didn't managed to get everything done as the UI work took me significantly longer than I expected, so the major update will be postponed.

What I can show you though is the new web client: https://map.esk8.xyz/next/
It's a complete rewrite of the original client to Angular with a completely new UI.
It's still missing a few core features and you may encounter some bugs - please report them if you find any, feedback is more than welcome.

There will be a short downtime until the DNS is fully refreshed around the globe.

There is no wrong one. The old server has been shut down. If it loads, it's the new server. It may not load for people that visited it recently as the computers cache old DNS ( domain -> server IP ) records and refresh them only ever so often - reboot usually solved this.

Okay, I've installed Chrome and can confirm that the new beta client doesn't work in it, I will figure this out and include a fix in the next beta release.

Till then, you can use the current stable client at https://map.esk8.xyz.

Hi, as you may've noticed, there was no update for a while due to severe lack of time on my side. I made a tough decision to abandon any community projects I run, esk8 map included.

**IMPORTANT**:  domain esk8.xyz ( used for https://map.esk8.xyz ) will expire in 15 days and I won't be renewing it. If anyone wants the domain, take it. The project will be moved to a subdomain of my main website, I will post a link later.

Feel free to take over the project and import the data from the API.  
Publicly available dataset: https://esk8.xyz/api/rider_locations  
I will NOT disclose any personal information that people entered ( eg. email ).

If anyone wants to take over the project, I will provide the full source code.  
Backend is just a simple Java (Spring Boot) application connected to MySQL spatial database  
New frontend ( https://map.esk8.xyz/next ) is written in Angular/TypeScript  
Legacy, dirty viewer  ( https://map.esk8.xyz ) can be downloaded directly as it's not compiled.

Just a quick update, like I mentioned before, the domain expired.  

As there was very little traffic ( I could count unique monthly visits on fingers of my hands ), it made no sense for me to keep the domain - someone may find a better use for it.

I didn't wanted to shut down the website, even though it's no longer maintained, it works and sees some visits so I kept it running but instead of having it's own TLD, it's now located at https://esk8map.patrikgajdos.eu.
