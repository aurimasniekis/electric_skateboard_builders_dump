Hello guys I recently finished my first build. I've been cruising around, Venice Beach, CA, Santa Monica, etc. All I see are booster riders. Looking for some people from ESK8 builders that are around LA who are down to meetup and cruise on the weekends! Let me know where are you guys located in California, I am pretty sure we can form a little group or something!

Hey dude! I'm in Mar Vista by the santa monica airport, I'm a vesc repair away from having my board completed. I'll give you a holler as soon as I get it running! 

I totally know there's two more DIY guys in Venice that I've seen on Rose near 5th/6th street, but I don't know if they're on this forum.

There are many good places to skate here.
Mission Beach board walk (very busy this time of year but really fun with wide cement paths right on the beach. sandy in spots though)
East Mission Bay Park(park setting and less crowded)
Father Juniper Sera Trail (smooth asphalt road that winds through mountains with lots of uphill/dwnhill.
Silver Strand bike way (runs from Coronado to Imperial Beach and is about 11miles long all flat and mostly straight)
Lake Murray is out( I got chased out of there cuz they don't allow any motorized vehicles)

These are not all, just the ones Iv'e done.

Looks like we blew a primary trace with the reverse polarity event.

Luckily it only burned this section. Usually the sections between the fets will vaporize too!

I tinned what was left of the trace and soldered a section of nickel strip in place for the repair.

The miracle was that nothing else was fried!!?? Your VESC is good to go!

Holy cow that was so fast! I'm so relieved to see that the damage was so small, I think its definitely a testimony to the quality of your parts. This has been, without a doubt, the best customer service I've ever received on anything in my entire life. Thank you so much @chaka, I really appreciate the thorough explanation as well! I can't wait to get this thing on the road!

I think we should set a date in early September? How's that sounds for all you SoCalers?

You guys can park in those streets a few blocks away since u have the boards, just ride out to the lot for meet up instead of paying a hefty parking spot. Save it for lunch or dinner snack or even beer. I wish I could make it guys but I'm stuck with work and it will take me hours to get out there :(

I also hail from oceanside, You guys could ride the strip on the oceanside beach as well as a couple bike paths that connect coast highway and the beach. Also,Highway 1 is a great bike route. After downtown Carlsbad it overlooks the ocean and has a separated bike path which is pretty sweet along the bluffs and beach. I liked the mission bay bike path as well but it is little bit of a drive from Oceanside. It might be cool just to ride down Highway 1  to Solana beach or Encinitas for beer/food and then grab a cheap coaster train ride back to Oside station from Encinitas or Solana Beach. So you are on the west side of the road the whole trip. Here are some other ideas I keep around, but some are dirt/gravel. http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/San-Diego-Magazine/April-2015/San-Diegos-Top-50-Trails/

mm didn't bother checking for that since its just open streets, not a closed loop.
When I did it a couple years ago on my bike there were a few guys on gas(two stroke) bikes conversions. I think they just want to keep that stuff out.

along the path is just tons of people and volunteers...so i'm riding it! :sunglasses:

I should be there by 9:00am. however, I am running into some issues. I was going to bring the Trampa EMTB but decided to go with something safer (not for me, but for other people, I might run people over haha). So it is either the boosted board v2 or CGT. I want to bring the CGT because the BBv2 range sucks. however, the motor plates have cracks ( I already have the newer version on  hand but I cant pull the damn pulleys off haha. good news tho, I have a set of spare new motors but it is 2am already. I might just risk it and take the CGT with cracked motor plates, I have been riding it as is for a few months. I have a feeling it might finally give come tomorrow.

Ciclavia was fun, managed to find other e-skaters, one with a trampa and another with boosted and me with a mini and we were weaving through the bikes at speed. We should definitely plan a group ride for the next one in June 11 in Glendale.

@Michaelinvegas I'm probably down to meet up in April

i want to gear one of those, the torque would be stupid lol

It's def a solid build, you will see. And it may be like those others but it's not...it has sick torque but it seems limited by the esc ... prob because of heat...they did do an software upgrade and it pulls nice and strong...

Need to remember this is for the general public, so it's definitely tame

the things is theres only a small group of weirdo who care about esk8 lol.
i'm shocked how many people ask about it, then **don't want to try it.**  :sob:

its a nice board tho, and it seems to have won you over,  i would take it over a boosted. but i'd need like 4-5 batteries to get the range i'm used to. lol maybe i just ride too much to not build. :thinking:

Lol they are scared to eat shit in front of a total stranger and it's our personal stuff...so, I get they are scared to break it... see if it was an official demo session....lines

I'm always a careful who I let ride...people say my trucks are set loose ... and they are pretty wobbly... Dave could barely ride my board around the parking lot. And when I got on the inboard the trucks were so tight...lol 

Yeah I like inboard. Deck is a great shape. Really comfortable, and some concave for carving. Build quality is outstanding. Remote is the best I've used and its a thumb throttle...I hate thumb throttles. And the ride is great, it actually feels like it wants to go faster...but like I said ....it's limited by the esc...now if you put a vesc in there lol I think it would even more awesome.
