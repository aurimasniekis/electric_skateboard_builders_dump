@ra.rend @KMeyerson @surprisebirthday  

I figured we should probably get our own thread and stop spamming the roll call thread with just our local specifics...

I'm good for Sunday 10/23/16, pretty much anytime. As far as location, I've got no real solid route ideas- I'm sure we can find some interesting places in Old Town Alexandria or downtown D.C. (mall area?) What kind of range do you guys have? I should be good for 10-12 miles, but can bring a charger as well.

I can't go more than 3-4 miles in the Boosted, my Yuneec is out of commission due to water, and my custom board has two Jacob Hubs one burned out and the other sheared off the motor cables.

Yeah... $3000 in boards all not working. I'm aware.

Well at certain point we all experienced broken parts and unused parts that might add up close to 1k usd / euro. Still DIY project is a DIY project, fault is right behind the corner if you're inexperienced or not careful enough.

Capital crescent trail might be a great ride

I wouldn't add my 10s 11Ah battery to any of these boards.  Yuneec eGo burns out every time I hook it up. Boosted would lose its warranty that I'm about to cash in on, and the Jacob Hub board would struggle with only one wheel.

You get the picture.  :-/

Love that we're organizing a ride. I'm tentative for this weekend, but would love to since the weather looks like it'll be good.  

I get about 10 miles, riding Hummie's hubs and a Space Cell, 10s3p. 

Capital Crescent could be good as mentioned, but if we did that I'd recommend an EARLY ride, like 8am latest.  I've ridden my bike on it at around 10am and it's pretty packed with runners, walkers, and cyclists.  Otherwise, would probably be a serene ride along the Potomac. I'd say start in Bethesda and roll down to Georgetown.

Other ideas?

Also, adding @Mr_Mahal

The only place I'm relatively familiar with is around the mall (free parking in front of the capitol/botanical gardens, easy metro access as well), but it'd still be more of a free-form exploration ride as I don't know of a real solid route.

 It's been a few years since I've been down the CCT, think it'll be too busy? I'm game to try it out, where would a good meet-up/parking spot be in the Bethesda area? Is the CCT what hooks into the C&O towpath as well near Georgetown? I forget how much of that is paved, I've only ever biked it and never cared about that before.

Sold my GT, so I'm down to 4-5 miles. I've ridden all around the monuments, and eventually caught too much attention riding with a buddy and got warned not to ride anywhere around the mall. I haven't done the CCT, so I'd be open to anything.

Anyone near College Park?  I just got the Bamboo GT for my campus commute.  I always seem to be late now b'cause I can't help but take the longest route possible.  The campus is a freaking amusement park for an all terrain board w/ rolling hills and a hundred miles of sidewalks and footpaths.  I highly recommend it for those of you in the area!

Yeah, I'd be down for a group ride some time.  This weekend, 2/18 or 2/19 work for me.  After that weekends in March, starting with 3/11.

Mt Vernon Trail would be good.  It can be pretty hairy with cyclists and runners at certain stretches though, so going as early as our wits can handle would make it more enjoyable.

Alternatives:
(1) Capital Crescent Trail, starting in Bethesda, MD and ending in Georgetown (7 miles).  Would need to take metro back up to Bethesda unless if you have a battery that can take 7 miles uphill. :smile:  This can also be busy near Bethesda.
(2) Metropolitan Branch Trail, starting at Union Station and ending at the Dew Drop Inn (2.5 miles, ending with beer and food).  Pretty clear and open for us.

I can go as early as 9AM on Saturday 2/18, maybe 10 will be good if we are aiming to grab food after the ride.

Dig the idea of beer/food but 2.5miles doesn’t seem far enough. @bshow22 has a Bamboo GT that should make it there and back, we can also recharge in Georgetown, maybe go to Thunderburger (opens at 10am).

Sounds great!  To confirm: Quartermaine Coffee, 4817 Bethesda Ave, Bethesda, MD 20814.  It's funny, sometimes when I do bike rides, I stop by Bethesda Bagels which is right next door!

I'll, uh, be the guy with an electric skateboard.  I'll PM you my phone number just in case.

@scrant @ra.rend @Mr_Mahal @KMeyerson Just FYI.  @scottkellum and I are going to ride the Capital Crescent Trail this Saturday, 2/18, starting at 10am.  

Meet location: Quartermaine Coffee, 4817 Bethesda Ave, Bethesda, MD 20814.
Time: 10am EST
Destination: Georgetown for food/coffee/drinks 
Distance: ~8 miles

It's mostly downhill with a few small hills.  I can help people find metros or other transport back to where they need to go.  Any takers?  The more the merrier!

I like BWI Trail. It's 11 miles and some small hills but not that bad. Problem is once you finish a lap you're kind of in an awkward middle ground of whether you should continue or stop. Maybe for range test just do a smaller 5 miles loop somewhere. I can't think of any right now.
