Hi folks,

ESK8FR and the Carve Electric Skateboarding UK group have joined forces to organise what will be one of the biggest (if not the biggest) European events of the year.

![image.jpg](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/6/d61a9ad6e569c538cd4a4374252c5f43e4a0fb11.jpeg)

We are planning to meet up for a weekend of e-skating fun from the 11 to the 14th of July, in and around Paris.

We‚Äôd love it for as many e-skaters from other countries as possible to show up and make this the best event possible. We‚Äôre also obviously extending the invitation to the manufacturers, with different sponsorship package types available.

We‚Äôre a few months away, but it‚Äôs best to organise things with time. Please spread the word in your own groups and let me or @okp know if you‚Äôd like to help organising or if you want to share your ideas. We‚Äôll waive any event fees for volunteers willing to help us for the whole duration of the event, so let us know if you‚Äôd like to help making this event a success!

**PROGRAM DETAILS**

![image.png](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/1/11344c73c0a0369e9097f908fc468d1b62f111a5.png)

We‚Äôve finally came up with a rough budget and, because unfortunately great events like this have inherent costs (sound systems, generators, insurance, health &amp; safety, etc) we do need to charge a small fee to each participant: ‚Ç¨20 will give you access to the venues and activities, as well as to the ‚Äúvendors village‚Äù. We‚Äôre thinking of making a run of t-shirts for the event for a small price, so do let us know if you‚Äôre interested in buying one.

Again, this is very much an event by the riders for the riders, so we‚Äôre not expecting to make any profit at all‚Ä¶

FOR VENDORS: we‚Äôll be ready in the coming days with a sponsor pack, at which point we‚Äôll be able to start contacts in order to organise your level of participation in this event. The sponsor package will come with a tiered system of participation, which we‚Äôre positive will be of your liking. Do note that this will be the biggest event this year in Europe, with vendors from all over the world already committed or very interested in taking part. You will not want to pass on this opportunity of showing your kit to the community and to check on what the competition is doing!

**ACCOMMODATION DETAILS:**

Auvers sur Oise is situated just north of Paris, so you‚Äôll be within commutable range if you do choose to stay in Paris. If you do so, we‚Äôd recommend to stay north of Paris. Auvers sure Oise has a few places to stay:

* The local camping park, with plenty of space for tents and very reasonable prices;
* Hotel des Iris, small nice hotel in town;
* Hotel Lemon (Mery sur Oise/Cergy, 3 miles away), which is cheap as chips (¬£31 per room per night) but seems to have less than positive reviews;
* H√¥tel Restaurant Campanile Taverny (a couple of train stations away), with reasonable prices;
* A few B&amp;Bs in the area; also, AirBnB accommodation seems to be quite cheap in this area;

**TRAVEL DETAILS**

Can't wait for this man

I will have my trampa done by then so my street board would be free but I fear the Parisian streets will call for AT and not an 85mm street setup!  The other issue is lugging a trampa and a 9KG street board as well as my other stuff through the underground and then onto the eurostar.

@ricardo I don¬¥t know which plans you made so far, but if there is an opportunity that vendors can give different boards for people to try/testdrive, that would be a cool thing (sure only if there is an interest from vendors side too)

The program is yet to be defined, but it makes all sense to have a space for the vendors to show their stuff, possibly on the Saturday afternoon/evening in a place where the general population can also access.

If any of the French peeps knows of a good cheap warehouse, maybe we could have some sponsorship type program to cover those costs... :-)

85mm wheels could do just fine !

Not yet mate, but based on our previous trip I'd say:

Thursday:

Small night ride (for those who arrive early enough)


Friday:

Afternoon ride (more park based, like Bois de Bologne)

Night ride (passing through the big monuments)

Partayyyy!!


Saturday

"A Day at The Races" - we need to find a venue that would let us do some kind of competition. Need help for this!

Vendors/Manufacturers on display - again, need a venue. Need help to secure this, ideally at the same space as the event above. Willing to consider sponsorship...!

Partayyyy!!

Sunday

Morning ride through the city (depends on the Bastille Day celebrations, I guess?)



This is just a skeleton idea for the weekend, we're obviously open to suggestions and help!

[/quote]

I have spread the topic in a Belgium/Netherlands whatsappgroup. 

I see you are coming to Amsterdam? Do you want that I invite you in the group? So you can meet some guys in Amsterdam?

Awesome!

We're working on trying to find a venue that is good enough to host both vendors and a competition but I must say that, given the initial response we've been getting in here and elsewhere, we'll need a bigger venue than what we were originally thinking... 

@ all Paris based skaters, let me know if you have ideas for a suitable, insurable venue!

@ all vendors/manufacturers, we may have to look into sponsorship / partnership in order to cover costs, as we are determined to make this a free event to all participants... PM me or @okp or @BigBrit if you are interested in having your name well displayed throughout our posters and venue :-)

I am not from Paris, so I do not know exactly where but maybe we should look for an athletic track. Can be open or closed (to be safe in case of rain). It will give us the freedom. It usually has a big parking space, easy to insured, track for competitions and space in the middle for vendors and parties, is far from the houses so no problem for music ecc...
There are several for sure in Paris. Probably in different size too.

There are 2 big central park next to Paris; Bois de boulogne and Bois de Vincennes. 

Vast majority of time, they hangout around the park bois de boulogne.  Me, I like to cruise around the Vincennes. Because is more less busy and more open road for a normal board and off road track. During the weekend of the summer, most of the road around the park are closed off and car free. 

If you like to go for a long distance cruising around the historical with less crowded. I prefer to go out to Normandy. 

But Ill see what and how will cedric/erik/alexis organizing for the community.

Good news guys,

I just got confirmation from the Hotel Paris D'Issy that we'll have a 10% discount on any bookings if we use the code "ISSYPRO"!

We're still waiting on feedback from a couple of other hotels in the area, so I'd advise you not to pull the trigger just yet.

I appreciated what you say but it's not that far: we stayed in the area last year and it only takes about 20 min by underground to get to the centre. Plus it's near @okp base and way cheaper than if we get anything closer to the centre (please remember that it's Bastille day weekend!).

We liked the area and it actually provides us with interesting routes along the river to the centre...!

Hi guys,

Just thought I'd update you all on the latest developments. There's been a lot of work going on behind the curtains (thank you @okp, @BigBrit, @CarveBillyG!) in order to ensure that we can offer an awesome event to the community. We're now in contact with different venues for all-terrain setups as well as street setups and news will be coming soon on this front. There's currently almost **200 people** interested or already confirmed going to this event, and there is a lot of interest from different manufacturers and brands associated with e-skating.... and it's still February! **It's going to be big!**

With regards to accommodation, I can now confirm that the cheapest deal we could find is the **Ibis Porte de Versailles Mairie d'Issy**. Other hotels have come forwards with discount codes, but just couldn't beat the Ibis rates.

While we understand that brands and manufacturers want a fixed plan as soon as possible and want to "get in on the act", we need to make sure we present to all a coherent, feasible and (most of all) awesome plan for the weekend. We can then shout out to the community for support. Please be patient... as the saying goes "Rome wasn't built in a day"! We count on you to make this the best European meeting ever, and something we can repeat year after year. 

The important thing is that this is an event created by e-skaters, for e-skaters. We all want you to feel welcomed, have a blast and plant the seeds of friendships that can last a lifetime.

Cheers,
Ricardo

Let me introduce you the all terrain area. This is the upcoming 2020 World Cup MTB area and we're gonna use it for our all terrain event in 2019. The area is huge (in my back there is a bigger space) and we'll be able to draw all terrain flat tracks and loops. So many options here. Hotels are also cheaper than downtown Paris. Ability to camp on the spot. A paradise for MTB riders !

![26219376_10213720937951012_2615577124704155584_n|690x388](upload://nSfwn7hAV7eiXymrnMULVJfOPq4.jpeg) 

For the street area, I'm checking if we can get a athleticism loop or area so everyone can stay around on Thursday, Friday nights ... and Sat night in Paris for the night ride and Sunday morning ride.

Well that's some insights of today. @Nowind what ya doing on 12/13 July ?!

We're in the process of  defining budgets (as you might expect there are costs involved in organising this sort of stuff!) and at some point in the near future we'll be reaching out to the community and the brands for both help in manning the event and sponsorship of some description.

We want to have as many e-skaters in France in July, so we're aiming to make it as cheap as possible without detracting from the experience. More news to follow soon!

Hi guys,

We're making progress on the planning front so I have news to share (I've also updated the first post on this thread). 

TL/DR: 

1. Found suitable venues for AT and street
2. Accommodation details updated
3. Have a plan for the weekend
4. Female organisers are welcomed oto join in to plan girl focused events
5. We've had loads of interest from vendors and are finally ready to be contacted
6. Price of the event ‚Ç¨20. Because this sh#t costs money, unfortunately.
7. Website will be up in the next couple of weeks
8. Volunteers to help setup up the venues very much welcomed!


**PROGRAM DETAILS** (these will be fine tuned as and when we firm up details; we also welcome suggestions and feedback!)

You are obviously welcome to join in every activity so that the community spirit is stronger, but not tied to participate at all and can do your own thing, at your own time and risk. 

Thursday Night:

- Arrival to Compi√®gne (you can take a train from Gare du Nord to Compi√®gne)
- Pub/Bar night (to be confirmed) so that everyone has a chance to meet up with each other

Friday/Saturday:

- Day at the tracks (all-terrain and street setup), with competitions/races and prizes, as well as time to try the tracks at your own pace. Vendors will have their own area to display and demonstrate their latest wares - we've had a lot of interest from vendors, so this is likely to be a major point of attraction during the weekend!

- We're on the lookout for girls who want to organise their own activities, as we've been contacted by a few to that end. It would be awesome to count on a strong female presence, so please do contact us if you'd like to try your hand at organising something cool for yourself!

- Evening rides around Compi√®gne (tbc)

Sunday

- Trip back to Paris and morning ride in town - This is Bastille Day in France, so it will be nothing but historic!


_____

**PRICING:**

We've finally came up with a rough budget and, because unfortunately great events like this have inherent costs (venues, sound systems, generators, toilets, insurance, health & safety, etc) we do need to charge a small fee to each participant: **‚Ç¨20** will give you access to the venues and activities, as well as to the "vendors village". We're thinking of making a run of t-shirts for the event for a small price, so do let us know if you're interested in buying one.

Again, this is very much an event by the riders for the riders, so we're not expecting to make any profit at all...

FOR VENDORS: Please contact us in order to organise your level of participation in this event. We have a tiered system of participation, which we're positive will be of your liking. Do note that this will be the biggest event this year in Europe, with vendors from all over the world already committed or very interested in taking part. You will not want to pass on this opportunity of showing your kit to the community and to check on what the competition is doing :-)

_____


**ACCOMMODATION DETAILS:**

To reflect the fact that, after much searching, we've finally settled on a venue (Compi√®gne, north of Paris) we've decided to update the accomodation details. You are still welcomed to stay in Paris, but preferably you can stay in:

- The actual venue for free if you bring your own tent (please be aware that you'd have to make your own arrangements regarding recharding your boards and phones, and also regarding toilet needs). If you do prefer to stay in the venue, do let us know so that we are made aware of how many tents to expect;

- Hotel F1 Compi√®gne, which is cheap as chips (¬£23 per room per night) but seems to have less than good reviews

- Hotel Ibis, which is still cheap at ¬£52 per room per night and has better reviews

Ffs mate, this is exactly why girls tend not to be involved.

We think it's important for girls to participate **with their boards** and, while it would be great just have us all together in the events, female e-skaters I've spoken to would like to also have their own thing, at their own rhythm.

My girl just read your comment and saud "oh,why not have a wet willy contest then?"

Also, out of the long update text I wrote, this is what you chose to write about? I was expecting a bit more feedback on the event itself. Ahh, well...

Can I just clarify so as not to book in the wrong place, this is Compi√®gne which is about an hour north of Paris?
I wouldn't classify myself as a vendor but could very likely bring a stack of enclosures along.

@bigben city is Compiegne in the north of Paris.

@sk8l8r  yeah ! camper vans are welcome as we have a big area available on the all terrain foreseen area.

yes, I was amazed when I went on this area last monday. This is a "real" mountainboard park so it may look soft on the photos... but you need some balls to jump in but you also need straps. That's why, we have plenty of options here. We'll for sure design a esk8 all terrain tracks with modules and of course ask for what you guys are looking for (suitable for boards without straps) but this could be an awesome track. 

Remember, everything here is for riders by riders. We do whatever we want to have a blast.

The street area as Ricardo said is under exploration in the City. I need to meet the representatives of the city to see what we can use. 

But you got it, we are really looking to bring diversity to this event so everyone can enjoy different tracks with different requirements.

But that's just one side of the area... we can also create a bigger loop around it as a track

General question about recharging batteries at the mtb track.
There is enough capacities to get your packs charged up again?
I guess most of us would need as min one recharge what could be an issue if 20+ people would want to charge at the same time.

I agree. 

I can give more feedback like excellent work I‚Äôm really looking forward to this event. 
Now I no longer have to follow the Colorado event with envy because that is exactly the sort of event I wish we would have in Europe and now it is being realized by the likes of you. 

Great work. 

As for the make light comment, I did not think about this event as something for men only or only men activities involvement before you mentioned girls and women. Actually girls was the key word for me to decide to make light of it.
 
You didn‚Äôt mention it was a boys event before and I thought it was strange to suddenly separate this thing gender wise. 

So what is this activity that shela‚Äôs would like to do at their own pace then that appearently boys do not?

I think gender should have been left out of it since this is an event for all of us.

No worries mate, no harm done! I'm not a native English speaker, so some language confusion may be at play.

We just want to promote participation from everybody and if that means having a female-only event to bring them to tge fold, so be it. I too dream of the day when we won't need gender specific events in order to be able to include everyone! üòé

Are there some people who come to Paris by plane? Last Saturday we had a group ride with some people from Belgium & Netherlands. A friend of mine gave the idea to rent out a few battery packs. If my company is running, I might want to rent out some batteries to the people who do not have the possibility to take one with them.

When are you planning to have it up and running? And what types of batteries will you be renting out (to fit which boards)? 

My feeling is that the sooner you're up and running the better so that we can attract more participants and, in turn, you can attract more business for yourself - we have a sponsorship program and you can have your own little place in the "vendors village" where people can meet up with you and get a fresh battery.

Drop us a line! :-)

I have thought to build some 10s3p's and 12s3p's (for sure samsung 30q) but it can be difficult to build them according to the dimensions of the people's enclosure. So I was thinking about a small pelican with velcostraps. So that people can but it between their legs. 
![image|375x500](upload://7nBMLNfwBXJLyyxnoawFakmRFn1.jpeg) 

Yeah I know about the vendors village, but my english is not that good  :see_no_evil: I think also that not everybody knows that I am only 19 years old :grinning:

I am definitely going to wear a sweater or shirt with my logo on it so that I am recognizable and anyone who have questions about batterys can come to me :wink: 

I will let you know if I want to borrow a small space.

@Andy87 What pack do you want? I can maybe work something out for you. So that you can rent a pack for a small price.

I‚Äòm running mainly lipos. Size factor is not the big thing as long as it can velcron fit between my legs on a trampa.
My issue with a 3p pack would be that the discharge is too low and everything over 3p is probably too heavy to jump.
Non the less thx for your offer!

Hi, the latest update regarding the European e-skate meeting in Paris (July '19) is in. Hope to see as many riders in there as possible! ;-)

https://www.facebook.com/events/292512948120585

Unfortunately, and due to circumstances beyond our control, we are no longer able to host the event in Compienes. Over the last few days, after a titanic effort from the French team, we've actually managed to secure a better venue, closer to Paris and with the full support of the mayor of the town.

The main events' location is now in **Auvers sur Oise**, a place better known for its connections with Absinthe and Van Gogh. We've managed to secure the roads next to the school area for the street events, a large compacted soil and grass area for the off-road and ‚Ä¶drumroll please‚Ä¶ **a secret underground area**! We're super. super excited about these venues! 

It‚Äôs great to see the amount of interest generated with potential sponsors so the good news is that we will have plenty of space to welcome all in the ‚ÄúVendor‚Äôs Village‚Äù, including a testing area where yourself, your family and friends can check the latest industry developments.

We‚Äôve also managed to secure electrical supply (you won‚Äôt run out of juice!) and toilets (the only time you‚Äôll pee your pants in will be of excitement, when you arrive to the venue)

In terms of accommodation, there‚Äôs the Hotel des Iris and a camping place in town, as well as a cheap hotel (Lemon Hotel, 3 miles away) and a bigger hotel a couple of train stops away (H√¥tel Restaurant Campanile Taverny). There‚Äôs also plenty of small B&amp;Bs around and AirBnB alternatives. We know that this creates a bit of bother with cancelling/re-booking accommodation, so we do apologise for any inconvenience.

The draft Agenda is as per below, and we‚Äôre nearly ready to initiate contacts with sponsors, as we‚Äôre preparing a great sponsor pack. The event website will be up and running very soon, ready to receive your bookings.

![image|690x466](upload://2scajkEczA9ch1S1MrxdlqCnghv.png) 

Enjoy,
Esk8FR &amp; CarveUK

Hi @anorak234, thank you for helping out. The message I want at the start, replacing what is in there at the minute is:

" Hi folks,

ESK8FR and the Carve Electric Skateboarding UK group have joined forces to organise what will be one of the biggest (if not the biggest) European events of the year.

![image|690x259](upload://uy3b7aVNbxINwuzUlmLfs4jHhRv.jpeg) 

We are planning to meet up for a weekend of e-skating fun from the 11 to the 14th of July, in and around Paris.

We‚Äôd love it for as many e-skaters from other countries as possible to show up and make this the best event possible. We‚Äôre also obviously extending the invitation to the manufacturers, with different sponsorship package types available.

We‚Äôre a few months away, but it‚Äôs best to organise things with time. Please spread the word in your own groups and let me or @okp know if you‚Äôd like to help organising or if you want to share your ideas. We‚Äôll waive any event fees for volunteers willing to help us for the whole duration of the event, so let us know if you‚Äôd like to help making this event a success!

**PROGRAM DETAILS**

![image|690x466](upload://2scajkEczA9ch1S1MrxdlqCnghv.png) 

We‚Äôve finally came up with a rough budget and, because unfortunately great events like this have inherent costs (sound systems, generators, insurance, health & safety, etc) we do need to charge a small fee to each participant: ‚Ç¨20 will give you access to the venues and activities, as well as to the ‚Äúvendors village‚Äù. We‚Äôre thinking of making a run of t-shirts for the event for a small price, so do let us know if you‚Äôre interested in buying one.

Again, this is very much an event by the riders for the riders, so we‚Äôre not expecting to make any profit at all‚Ä¶

FOR VENDORS: we‚Äôll be ready in the coming days with a sponsor pack, at which point we‚Äôll be able to start contacts in order to organise your level of participation in this event. The sponsor package will come with a tiered system of participation, which we‚Äôre positive will be of your liking. Do note that this will be the biggest event this year in Europe, with vendors from all over the world already committed or very interested in taking part. You will not want to pass on this opportunity of showing your kit to the community and to check on what the competition is doing!

**ACCOMMODATION DETAILS:**

Auvers sur Oise is situated just north of Paris, so you‚Äôll be within commutable range if you do choose to stay in Paris. If you do so, we‚Äôd recommend to stay north of Paris. Auvers sure Oise has a few places to stay:

- The local camping park, with plenty of space for tents and very reasonable prices;

- Hotel des Iris, small nice hotel in town;

- Hotel Lemon (Mery sur Oise/Cergy, 3 miles away), which is cheap as chips (¬£31 per room per night) but seems to have less than positive reviews;

- H√¥tel Restaurant Campanile Taverny (a couple of train stations away), with reasonable prices;

-  A few B&Bs in the area; also, AirBnB accommodation seems to be quite cheap in this area;

**TRAVEL DETAILS**

no worries, keep in mind that we have started from scratch this journey and build this progressively. Today we went super early in the morning to Auvers to meet the council and district representative. Setting such event in a public area take a huge amount of work and dedication, significant personal money and time including creating of an association to host it etc etc

We do it for the fun and huge envy to meet you all and have a blast together

For the all terrain, it's gonna be perfect for an evolve board and have options for hardcore riders who ride "real" mountainboard.

the website will be up soon, but we really need all your support so this event can be 

The street event/track is also going to be insane with some slide contests and carving/slalom with a great area for sponsors to give their boards to the test. We've secured a place today for it and it will be in a place which is in the center of the city. Huge public coverage and interaction.

Can't wait !!!

So I'm looking at a temporary alternative. 

Any of you guys got tools to carbon fiber layer dip 3D printed parts? Around 250x60x6mm max footprint.

I'd like them to at least survive the summer and be able to hold up to at least 40mph. Let me know if we can arrange something, I'll pay the materials of course.

We're stoked to announce that, while there are a large number of brands in discussions to become sponsors for the Paris Event, **LazyRolling** is the first brand to become a Partner to the event, and you will start to see their logos on promo material soon. 

They've also kindly agreed to donate some prizes for the competitions! Yasss! :-)

I'm able to lend some lipos to 1 rider (and maybe 1 another later) who can't bring lipos with them for this summer event. The service is **free of charge**, of course, I'm not doing business, **just trying to help** others. _Take good care of what is lent to you and all will be all right_ ;)

What I can lent :
  - **2X 5S 10Ah Tattu 15C Lipo** (capacity is actually a bit less)
  - **3X 3S 8Ah Zippy Flightmax 25C Lipo** (just in case because I don't think a lot people would use 9S but I do :slight_smile: )

Maybe a new thread can be opened for lipos/li-ions loans between riders for the event. Obviously, this offer is for people who are sure to come this summer and who don't have any other solutions for lipos travelling.

Hi all,

Please have a look on [http://www.pari-roller.com/](http://www.pari-roller.com/)
this is a weekly event on friday night that cross Paris for 3-4h session with security, supervision...
I used to do it for years, we use to see rollers, skateboarders, one-wheel ...

it is free, with security to close the roads and secure the race, they are doing stops to take a breath, and regroup slower and faster...

I'm bookmarking the website.

Cup planning goes down in 10 hours right ? I'll impatient to see it.

Btw @okp can I bother you a bit with advices on how to laminate carbon ? 

I haven't had success with getting somebody to do it for me so I'll give it a try (and hopefully end up with something solid enough).

So far I plan to use Sicomin 3k serg√© 193gr sheet and Sicomin resin & lacquer + pressurized bag and a small airpump from an aquarium. Are Kevlar scissors mandatory ? Can't I just use my Dremel?

Also is sandwiching 3d printed parts a good idea ? I'll make a PETG shape or HIPS.

Is the shiny finish just for looks or I need to polish resin so it is stronger (less irregularities)?

hey ! a quick update as we are progressing. The website went through some slights updates of content and we are now going to open the registration. The main challenge we have is to get the funding to pay for the fixed costs, like safety, insurance (it cost an arm and a leg). We also plan to put some timers but it cost another leg but we'll make it ! 

This is going to be a meet up from a global community; people are coming from everywhere and even some you tubers are also coming. This will be a good blend of what the community is about nowadays and I really like that ! All the money captured will directly go into the event. 100%.

In terms of sponsors that are giving prizes and supporting the event, Frederic from eBoard is joining and I also got an helmet from Ruroc as a prize. People from Arcboard are also going to participate and some other great names are coming. 

We're looking to have an event t-shirt but you know, we are pretty bad at graphics or visuals. Website was already a nightmare to get it online. 

We thought that it would be cool to reach out to the community for people to design visuals for the event t-shirt. All the sales will go directly into the event (100%) and the name of the winner will be written down on the t-shirt for credits and will get a huge hug party from all the people attending.

So, who's in to design some visuals for the t-shirt of this event?

The key drivers are obviously : electric riding, sharing, racing, community, van gogh (Auvers is Van Gogh city), Paris, Eiffel Tower and have to mention "It's Electric" and "Carve UK".

Thanks folks !

Great work mate and to everybody else involved so far! I'll happily have a play at designing the T-shirt. It's worth noting that most T-shirt printers will need a CMYK 300dpi image to print good quality shirts.

I'm also more than happy to donate It's Electric stickers for the event! Let me know if that would be welcome? Happy to sponsor too!

Cheers!

Hi mate, It's great you are willing to help out and possibly join what is now a really good group of sponsors! I'll send you a PM with some details. 

In the meantime, I'd also like to shout out to the community and see if anyone would like to volunteer to help us run some of the events, setting up the routes, etc. We're not doing this for profit and we're definitely running on a shoestring budget, so anyone willing to help out is more than welcome. We'd obviously waive participation costs, and throw in some small freebies to show our appreciation.

We did try to keep prices to a minimum, but we were not able to cover the budget with the sponsorship. The insurance for this event alone is around ‚Ç¨2000, and there are other significant costs, which bring the total budget to around ‚Ç¨5000. We're not making any money out of this ...üòï

The prices are fine. My question is more related to the activities.

From your pricing it looks like you're charging for contests. You might want to look in to that because I'm not coming to take part in a contest, I just want to have a cheeky ride with friends and drink a few beers. 

So do I just not buy a ticket?

That's a good question, abd something that the organising team is actually debatinv internally. Would it be a goid idea to have a cheaper "general admission" ticket, giving you access to the tracks at off peak times and to the night rides?

Call it a spectator ticket and charge ‚Ç¨10 no board and ‚Ç¨20 with board or something like that. It will encourage casuals like me to attend and give you guys a revenue from bystanders and guests of riders. 

This should help alleviate contest costs and pay for things. Easy enough to implement I'm sure.

Really happy to announce that Evolve France is not only supporting us throughout the event, but also kindly offered to organise the Thursday night ride! 

It will be a good opportunity to test out the new GTR, and check for yourself whether their claims stand ground ;-)

Buy your tickets now at www.itselectric.fr !

Highlight of the day coming from 3D Servisas. Aurimas is also giving prizes for the event ! This super cool gift will go directly to the winners.

Here we go ! **One FatBoy mini urethane gear drive with 2 x FatBoy 240 hangers and both ABEC & KEGEL adapters** ! 

Thanks a lot for the riders @Kug3lis @3DServisas

We really value the input of the community and we listened to your comments. As a result of that, we now have a "casual" pack which gives you access to the tracks so that you can try them before and after competition times. We very nearly called it the " @brenternet pack" :-P

Additionally, I'm pleased to announce that access to the "Vendor's Village" is FREE, as are the group rides. So... it's all down to yourselves to book whichever tickets suit you best at https://www.itselectric.fr/paris-electric-skateboarding-cup-booking/ and make this your own event.

On a side note, we welcome any volunteer who can help with the running of the event, and we will waive participation fees for those helping out. Let me know if you'd like to help a brother! :-)

Perfecto :ok_hand: you would have had many more participants if you'd called that but the crowds might have been overwhelming.

Now there's room for another casual ticket. It's the same as the current one but ‚Ç¨150 and includes 20 drinks tokens üòÇ

I know for a fact that some/most of the people booking for the competitions won't be there to win at all cost, they will be there to have a bit of fun and to feel the atmosphere when participating in the event. 

Anyway, you can always get a "@brenternet pack" (wink wink!) now and upgrade at a later time (just drop us a note if you do that)... but we do intend to raise prices closer to the event time.

hey - Loaded and Slick have decided to support the event too. Loaded is giving some cash that will contribute to pay safety, insurance. They are also giving some prizes for the riders. Slick is giving some gear too.

I also take this opportunity to give a huge thumbs up to my bro @Kaly that will be also supporting this event/meetup/jam session - whatever you wanna call it - and make sure that you can drink a beer with him face to face to share the love and vision that each and everyone has about electric skateboarding. He's working on making this venue and hope he'll be there with us.

We have launched the production of bracelets yesterday (this will be festival like bracelet). We are going back in the school area that the council is providing us for the street event. This area is pretty wide, in the center of the city and has different areas that will contribute in a creative street track using natural obstacles. I'll take this opportunity to film some footage too.

For all the sponsors, partners, don't hesitate if people buy stuff from you to get this opportunity to give it face to face in the event. I don't know if that's too much of work, but you could also organize group buys (or aggregated orders) that can be delivered face to face too. These are just ideas to take the benefit that everyone will meet at the same place and also save cost + provide more than just "selling" and give the why directly to the end "consumer"/rider.

I think that can be also good if you come with some extra parts in case of people that want to buy them directly. 

Probably something to explore !

Between us, organizing this, is really super interesting but a really hard work. It also gives some insights about how some ESK8 shops, sometimes so called "biggest whatever shop" act in the background. No-one is here to oblige anyone to give something, especially if this something goes back to the community (which feed their business) and our event is anyway non business lead by design. I'm just proud that super small companies / or one-man army that have our passion in their guts and which are often coming from DIY don't have short hands and deep pockets compared to these kind of "biggest esk8 shops".  

Cheers guys and Happy Friday.

Super stoked to have the opportunity to see Ernesto @kaly in person! 

I'm obviously not going to get any prizes in the competitions, so I can see the "Sponsors Village" becoming like a one-stop-shop where I can buy everything I need for a new DIY board...

- Remote from Trampa (Please bring a Fleshlight with you @trampa!)
- Deck from Loaded (Confirmed Competition Prize)
- Unity from @EnertionSupport 
- Wheels from Slick Revolution (Confirmed Competition Prize) - not sure if they have a tag in the forum?
- Trucks from @Kaly
- Drivetrain from BioBoards @mackann  and @3DServisas (Confirmed Competition Prize)
- Battery pack from @e.board_solutions 
- All other bits and bobs from StreetWing @DavidBanner
- Board bag from AlterBags @Grievor (Confirmed Competition Prize)
- Helmet from Ruroc (Confirmed Competition Prize)  - not sure if they have a tag in the forum?
- Hoodie from LazyRolling @RobinLazyRolling (Confirmed Competition Prize)
- Some nice stickers from Esk8StickersUK @mrjonnyjones (Confirmed Competition Prize)
- Or, then again, I can just pick up a Mellow Drive (Confirmed Competition Prize) or an Evolve GTR and ride away to the sunset! 

This is truly an event by the community to the community. Rock on! It's going to be AWESOMEEEEE!!!


Disclaimer: This is just my personal opinion and you guys are all smart enough to understand that all the suppliers above can sell you the above items and much more. At the end of the day, it's up to you to decide what's the best board to suit your needs!

@okp @ricardo @CarveBillyG @BigBrit I've been working on a T-shirt design!

Below you'll see two options for the rear of the shirt, with another for the front. My initial idea is to have a large design on the back, and a smaller one on the front. Let me know what you think, any feedback is welcome. If we keep it to one colour (two maximum) it'll make production costs as low as possible, as only one or a max of two screens will have to be made at the T-shirt printers. Screen-printing offers the best quality and lowest cost, especially if a few hundred shirts are being made.

Thank you for your help mate!

If it isn't too much effort, I'd make the tower smaller, include the title "Paris Electric Skateboarding Cup 2019" and have separate logos for CarveUK, Esk8FR and It's Electric.

What are your thoughts @okp?

well done. I'd say that from my standpoint, I don't really care about having so much credits given to the organizers logos. I don't work hard to get my movement/community logo or group logo on it. I just don't care. It's not about, me, esk8fr or whatever. It's about the purpose of what we do : bring riders together and promote diversity / knowledge sharing in a special place (Paris/Auvers).

I would probably refocus it towards this purpose, the why : a global community of riders and builders meeting for a cup, a jam session, getting people together in an event called Paris Electric Skateboarding Cup 2019 hosting people coming from all parts of the world.

The t-shirt should reflect this identity so people get good memories. I will follow the approval of the community on what they think best represent this, for them; and be proud to wear it.

Really great effort! I do like them, but the only thing is that it has no mention of e-sk8.fr

I kow @okp does not care about it but, truth be told, the French collective has been fantastic in the organisation. Any chance you can incorporate their logo somehow at the front?

Just having a quick coffee break and I added the ESK8FR logo. I also removed GET STOKED!... because I'm not sure I'd wear a Tshirt that has that on it :rofl: @ricardo @okp Hopefully this design is OK now? If anybody else wants to contribute a design feel free, there is however limited time as they'll need printing by the It's Electric team ASAP for next month.

@mrjonnyjones Well if I had to change a thing it would just be design of the "a" letter. It's just personal opinion but I would make it symmetrical, like more "squary" (i guess you can say this word ? i don't know xD)

![14|690x82](upload://uu4S1HwBuNWAqvn6xKdDckZhJrO.png)  

I did this really quick just as an example of what I think about but you can do it wayyyyyy better if you got something to directly modify the font's vector

EDIT : also the lightning strike made my OCD come back because of it's position but I guess it's just me x)

EDIT 2 : tried to solve my OCD :

Guys, my proposal. I think that the skateboard can be improved, the nose and the battery compartment to have a more generic esk8 look. if someone is motivated to improve it or propose another version, I can send him the source file with pleasure !

Hi folks, we want you to have the best event that we can provide for. Because we have limited manpower running the event we have decided to close the ticket office on Friday (28th June) so that we can deliver the best event possible to the ones already committed to join us on our journey.

We want to thank you all for all the support you have given us so far (participants and sponsors alike). The response has been overwhelming so far, and we've already sold more tickets than what we expected at this point. So, if you really want to come, buy your tickets soon at [https://www.itselectric.fr/booking/](https://www.itselectric.fr/booking/?fbclid=IwAR28hiqxzM7E9YaMzOddWI_9QWM-kggrFfY7-a6UpX_bMH6Gx6a5KI_5-mc). We reserve the right to stop selling tickets earlier than Friday if we see that we are selling more tickets than we can handle.

A couple of announcements on the way: First up, meeting point and ride on Thursday:

The meeting point is the Long Hop Bar, 25 Rue de Fr√©d√©ric Sauton, and the route can be found in here: 

https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1f8Wgkl65UROySEDOV6hBEjz4yA2nXhjb&hl=fr&ll=48.83983797565055%2C2.3711276000000225&z=13&fbclid=IwAR11uwJmqFiLSxIxSstRMN7-sbgnuGbEBd9dTYaA7Dt7giHQFEZZ-KsyM0s

It has been prepared by the good friends at Evolve France and it's a cracker of a route, with three different distances for different kinds of riders/ranges - more details coming soon.

Communication from Evolve France regarding the #esk8Cup2019 Thursday evening ride:

"Meeting from 7pm to The Long Hop Bar, 25 Fr√©d√©rique Sauton Street. Closest Subway is Maubert Mutualit√©. Start of our ride at 20pm.
It is a 35-40km ride with 2 shorter options for those with less range. First ride group, 15km. Second ride group 25km and finally, for those with more range, 10 to 15km more to ride 35 to 40km in total.
There is a dress code for this ride : Ladies ride ! Its not an obligation, it is for fun only. It‚Äôs very easy, all men are girly dressed ! Just for fun.
Last thing, I plan to prepare some energy drinks (based with rhum :)) to share 2 times in the ride. An other time, just for fun and to celebrate our epic ride."

Beautiful prize, wow! :heart_eyes:

In other news, **for anybody that is driving into Paris**, I only found out today, you need an [Air Quality Certificate](https://www.certificat-air.gouv.fr/en/).

It's only a few ‚Ç¨ and you will receive a sticker in the post (but not in time for the ESK8 Cup). So ensure you print off any emails you get sent as proof... or have them on your phone.

For those of you wanting to share all your pictures and videos (and check out all submitted media) head over to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13AD95ClHEc0DozvKV_kPdvKMxee2BxJJ

If you do want to upload media, or submit it to the Drive, please contact Michael Reid via the Event Whatsapp group or via Facebook. There's a good chance your media will be used by the BBC: they did a couple of interviews on site and filmed for a bit, but couldn't stay for too long so they want more footage.
