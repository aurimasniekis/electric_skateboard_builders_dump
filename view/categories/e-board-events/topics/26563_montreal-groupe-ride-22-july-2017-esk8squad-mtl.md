HI GUY....

I'm planing on a BIG event Saturday the 22 July 2017 (or if it is Raining could be reported to the 23 or later) in Montreal... It would be a 10KM course around the Canal Lachine, and a little BBQ at the end, the starting and ending point are at Basin number 4.

@Arch and I will be there! As @JohnnyMeduse mentioned, I'll probably be trying out one of your boards since mine will most likely not be ready.

Dude you should see if you can find a cheap rate at a hotel... think @Kaly is tied into the NYC esk8 guys...they are young and have boards and are adventurous...maybe they could road trip up?

Enertion is saying that they'll be in Montreal for Raptor 2 demos on July 23. I'm just wondering if they will still be participating in our group ride on the 22nd?

If I had to guess I would say JohnnyMeduse the Wiz himself will be hosting both events. Just a guess.
