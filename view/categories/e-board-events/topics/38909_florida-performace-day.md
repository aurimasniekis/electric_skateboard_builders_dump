Going to be taking some boards down to Florida in January to visit the great and honorable @longhairedboy. Bringing a friend, so I thought why not try a little south east group ride/performance day?

Just posting up gauging interest seeing if people would wanna come. First or second weekend in January.

EDIT:

OFFICIAL DAY IS JANUARY 13th. MESSAGE LHB FOR DIRECTIONS.

Worst case: We ride wild and free like a bunch of disorganized hooligans!

Seriously the bike paths here are amazing. Bring your watt hours! 

We may be able to do some street racing on a not-too-busy road that jake and i always test on right next to the house. Speed limit on that road is 30, and the cars are kind. I'm also going to look around and see if i can find some dead zones we can liven up. Several neighborhoods are in construction in the area which means  fresh streets with no houses. We might be able to do something with that too.

Iâ€™m down. I live about 45 min from LHB. Heâ€™s not lying, the trails around here are bad ass.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/2/d27e01fda6416c34c8297104c50ee5ac4cf0daf2.jpg" width="230" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/6/f6f3b929758333d545279cb5064e40ded6284fa9.jpg" width="230" height="500">

We could have a hell of a game of follow the leader. Last man standing wins beer on plant street in winter garden. 

Not sure what the rules are, but beer. Also anyone who wants to park at my house and carpool to the trail head is welcome. I can seat two extra people. 

Also stay as long as you like. We can after-party at the shop, recharge, and go for a night ride too. 

Also i'll bring the "recharging rope", which is basically a ski rope i made for towing peeps with dead packs.

I am free both of the first weekends of January. So whichever date we can get the most people to come to would be the weekend I come down. I have a day drive down and a day drive back so trying to make it as fun as possible. 

Jan 6-7th or Jan 13-14th

Left coast we call it the "tow rope of shame."  If the SPD group can be of any service or assistance, I think we'd be glad to help.

Ocoee. 20 minutes west of Orlando or about 12 miles from downtown proper. 

If we're good with meeting up at the shop to carpool and condense and just chill until everyone gets there, I'll PM coordinates upon request to anyone wanting to attend. Hit me up and i'll send you my address. Otherwise you'll have to buy something from me and look at the label when you get it.

let me have it for a minute. I'll stare at it menacingly until the bolts and i understand each other. 

There are also other tricks we can try. There are many kinds of thread locker, some of them aren't even thread locker. Plenty of substances can clog up threads and prevent vibration. I've even twisted in a drop of hot glue before.

Probs gonna do the December bicycle ride thing, forgot the name, so at least I'll get one group ride in.

The influx of Esk8rs in Florida is increasing exponentially its fucking awesome. On campus at the begining of the year no one had an Esk8, now there's ~30-40 guys with Chinese shit and some bad ass one wheels.

Hmmmmmmm, I could do something crazy here and fly over from Belgium. It seems like my current miles can cover the biggest part of those costs. I would bring my R1 or R2. But the biggest favor I need is someone borrowing me a battery for the weekend. I'll take good care of it.
Or if you could arrange a date up for in like 6 months, then I'm sure I can get the flight totally for free.
All because I would like to meet the amazing and utterly famous LHB and get baptized by skatan.

At this point there are a lot of IF's on this game plan. 
Flight needs to be available, R2 needs to be delivered (december is pinned), boss needs to give me holiday.

What if it will be raining ? I know it's florida, but still. I cannot just cancel something like this a day up front

So when I shoot for it, I would like the battery for the weekend. If anything happens to it, I'll gladly refund whatever costs. I would be flying 30h plus, not just for a single day of boarding. :angel: 
Could you PM me the location, so I can figure out total costs for hotel and car rental and so on...

@Battosaii. I gladly lend you my steez if I'll be running the R2.

I'm afraid this plan is not going to work for me. But I'll look forward to another possible trip to Florida maybe later in the year.

First reason would be the set-back for the R2. I believe Battosaii is in the same boat. Second part is no possibility to get some free days. It's busy as hell at work. So I hope you guys will have a blast and to be able to get there some time later this year.

i'm going! And so is Jake. And probably Matt, the other guy in our squad. 

And it looks like 4 people on Facebook are going. 

There's going to be a lot of trail riding, beer drinking, and probably even some very disorganized drag racing on the nicely paved street next to my house.

My girl would have to ride my outdated Raptor 1 with old batteries im bringing an extra space cell to make the journey lol.

Im trying to work out the kinks on my Raptor 1 but the remote is failing and Enertion again is taking their sweet ass time with sending my black friday remotes....

@longhairedboy worst case scenario do you have a board my Girl can borrow for the ride?

i have tons of footage coming! just as soon as i can stitch it together. The ride was beautiful and no one had to be towed. ITs the perfect way to get back to the party after stuffing our faces with pizza and macaroni at the Plant Street Market in Winter Garden. Thanks @Guido for the beer!  

The turnout was great! we had everything from a sick ass custom TorqueBoards based Evo to Jake's crazy ass 13S surfboard monstrosity, Evolves, and everything in between. there was even a Gen1 Raptor out there in single drive!

The Carvon Evo prototype was misbehaving half the morning, i eventually eliminated the issue the next day. Bad connection on the can bus and a bad connection on the sensor wires. Both easily fixed but super annoying. Got some really good feedback on that board while it was behaving, however, and i really appreciate it! That's her third from the right in the pic that @Battosaii posted. I've already scraped the box up doing some pretty extreme curb testing to see what the clearance is like. Dont; worry, that actually is a pass. Other boxes seem to suffer far greater damage when I intentionally slide down a curb edge on the box, the rounded profile helps a lot. 

Thanks everyone for coming!

Raptor 2 would have it off the line but the carvon would take over once the Raptor topped out below 30mph, which would happen almost immediately lmao

simply put, nothing is going to take a stock raptor 2 off the line except a non-stock Raptor 2 or possibly @Battosaii 's nasty fucking DIY evo, or maybe one of my four wheel drive monstrocities if geared correctly. 

The R2 drive system collects pink slips like a motherfucker. Can't wait to run that shit at 12S.

Well I'll let you guys know once my R2 comes in but I don't thing my Evo would be better off the line not untill I fix my hall sensors problems so I can run hybrid.

so it only took most of the year but i finally dumped the footage from my go-pro and got it down to about 10 minutes or so. I added some color and mood because that day was just white and grey and washed out and everything was dead, like my soul.

Agreed. We do need to have another one. Maybe in the spring? January was a bit cold.

It was a bit cold but I liked it.  I'd rather be cold I can put a jacket on but when your hot there's really not much you can do to prevent being a sweaty mess.

I'm down I'll have my 4wd Evo set up by then.

I promised myself I'd be back up there when my raptor 2 shows up. So spring might be about right.

Well I recently put some Focboxes in it and was running it in FOC mode with 6355s and let me tell you it's still faster than most boards lol I was having an issue with one of the 6355 motors with the shaft slipping on the motor so I have it taken apart I was thinking of selling it minus the Focboxes cause I ended up using them in a different project.

Nice I'll try that tonight when I get home, I still need an esc for it maybe I'll get a unity lol I may sell it cause I have too many boards now and it just sits for the most part.
