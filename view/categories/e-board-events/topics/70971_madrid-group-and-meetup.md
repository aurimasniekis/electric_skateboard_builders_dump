Hola todos!

I posted a few weeks back about moving to Madrid. Now that my modular board is fully re-assembled from America, I'm ready to ride!! 

That being said, any of you in Madrid interested in meeting up or getting a bit of a local group together? I'm thinking some group rides etc.

Look forward to meeting you all!!

Un saludo,

Marcus
