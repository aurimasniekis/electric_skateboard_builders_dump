Assuming I don't seriously hurt my self on the long ride I'd be willing to meet up the next day to skate.

Wow this place is amazing I'm just taking a break at the halfway point the path is shorter than I thought from where I parked so 12ish miles instead of 17  I still have 58% battery and I'm about to head back
