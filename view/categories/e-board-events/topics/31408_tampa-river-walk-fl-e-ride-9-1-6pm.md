@tyhuelle Thanks for posting this! 
 @itsmikeholland Great! This meet up is on 9/1, but we might do another when you're down here so keep an eye on our FB page. It's called Tampa Bay eSk8 Squad.
@Guido Sweet! The more the merrier. I'd love to do an Orlando meet up sometime so let me know if there's ever another one.

What are the ranges on your boards btw?

@marsrover001 Great! Thanks for asking because I hadn't thought about it. :blush: We should probably meet at Water Works Park. That way we can ride down the River Walk and back again. That's about a 5 mile round trip depending on how far down the Walk we go. I'll put the new meet up location on the facebook event page. See ya there!

Got too hype, this route is about 5mi long. All "greenways" which should mean dedicated bike paths. But I don't know Tampa that well. Heard @longhairedboy and @Guido were coming. Should be a party.

yeah we'll be there. @Guido is picking me up from work and we're headed down there.   I got my 30+ mile board with me and some extra belts so maybe i can just tear around this place like a mad fool. 

bringing my go pro and gimbal too, so maybe i'll play camera man for a while and catch some of this ride. IT should be good that time of day.

What's everybody riding? I'm bringing old Ru. Been riding this one about a year now. I've even got special high performance speed metal chunks stuck in my thane. And maybe even a high performance shard of glass.

Ok so.... i just found this thread and realized this ride happened in September... LMFAO

For whatever reason, my Go-Pro footage had the creation date as August 17, not September. So last night when i found this footage on my go pro i put August in all of the titles. 

Whatever. We can pretend it happened in August, right? lol TIME WARP!!!
