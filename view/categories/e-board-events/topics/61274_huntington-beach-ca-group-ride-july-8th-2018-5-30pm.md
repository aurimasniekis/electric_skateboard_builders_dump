It‚Äôs funny @Mikenopolis cause the Boosted Squad doesn‚Äôt really allow non-BoostedBoards to post on their page or let non-Boosted boards in their photo shots...we invite them to shit and they don‚Äôt come.

Not meaning to promote divisions but honestly all BoostedBoard group suck with their exclusion rules

They get zero love from the Esk8Squad

Never ride without the brain bucket!!!! Whether 3 Blocks or 3 miles, i make sure helmet is on. Not only for my safety but  also so my son sees a person needs to be responsible when enjoying hobbies that are dangerous. No exceptions!!!

It's good to be used, better than then be left to collect dust on the shelf.
