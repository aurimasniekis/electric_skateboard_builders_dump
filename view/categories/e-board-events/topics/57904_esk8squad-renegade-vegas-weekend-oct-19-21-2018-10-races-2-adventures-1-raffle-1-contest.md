Let me add more details as to where you will be riding.  The planned location is Art District and Downtown Las Vegas/Fremont area.  There is light traffic. There are parts that do have bike lanes, but most of the time you should have a clear road to ride. Please adhere to all traffic regulations as to not draw any negative attention to ourselves. This should be a great intro for many of downtown. The route can be modified to extend the distance of the final route if all of you would like that to happen.

The Poker portion of this event takes no skill. You will be drawing blind. Your fate is with the gambling gods.

Any questions?

The final format for this portion of the night is stil in the planning stages, but should be a lot of fun for everyone to participate. This again will be held in the same area as the Poker run. And allow you to hyper-sightsee downtown and get some great pictures(video too) to boot! Some Treasure sites may require you to dismount your board and walk your board. At each Treasure site you will be required to take a photo or video to prove that you found the correct treasure. Of course you need to be in the picture... so each one is a selfie. You will tweet and post it on IG with the hashtags noted above. This will help provide me with a time stamp of your proof. And serve as testament that you having a great time. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

These races will be done off the streets. These will be done on remote paths in Vegas about 20mins from the hotel. The location is remote but not far from civilization. You will be able to see the whole Las Vegas valley. It’s a beautiful run. And there aren’t just one.

There will be a total of ten races. You may enter all of them as long as the boards you are using meets class A or B requirements. (class A faster than 24mph, class B slower than 24mph top speed)

The idea was to keep people of the same skill level and speed in the same group regardless of the board they ride. We will do our best to make each class as even as possible so everyone has a fair shoot at a prize.

You will have an opportunity this day to ride all the paths....they are miles long. The paths are crack and rock free. They all have a soft shoulder, but all have enough room if you need to pass.

Please note you will have the ability to charge you boards. You will need to. The distances of the races willl be long and will test the voltage sag on your board. The runs are on smooth ground but the paths varies in elevation. There are parts that look like a big pump track, there are parts with long sweeping down hill........just remember....you gotta come back up. 
As for views, yes you can see all of Vegas. The rest of the rides...its like Esk8ing on Mars!

This is planned at a park. And as it says its a BBQ. At thiis location you will be able to cruise the bike paths and parking lots. It’s a big park. The paths are fun to ride since it windes through a desert portion of the park. For those with AT wheels...this is a cool place. Take a trip around the huge pond along the gravel path, hit the wide open grass. 

We will close out our weekend with good food and company. And do our last $ raffle that will include a free next event entry!

PS power to recharge will be provided

Day of Arrival: First day

The first day of the weekend starts in the evening on Friday. Hopefully, most of you are able to arrive by the late afternoon. That will give you time top off your battery and head out. Again, we will have aome type of power source for you at the starting point.
If you are unable to meet up at the first game, you still can catch the Treasure Hunt. 

There will be opportunities to recharge your boards at various points.

This will be an interesting competition. 

I have not decided on the firearm of choice yet, but to keep in tradition, it will be some type of rife.  You will have an opportunity to practice during the day.

The shooting area will be at the starting point for everyone to watch. 

Everyone must wear eye protection.

PS RIFLE = Airsoft or Pellet rife

Tips: Riding Downtown Las Vegas

Don’t ride under the covered walking area of Fremont street. Definitely off limits. You must walk your boards.
Otherwise it’s pretty open season. Sidewalks and roads are fair game. Just watch for people. Follow road rules when on the street. Obay all traffic signals and signs. And just stay to the right if a car comes. All very simple rules. But will make for a fun and safe night.

Tips: Hollywood Races

These are bike paths open to the public. But are not heavily traveled. So from time to time you will see someone. Make sure you make them aware you are there and about to pass them. I have never had a problem blasting by someone. Just like a biker....Just yell left or something that will let them know you are about to smoke them.

Are there blind spots? Just keep right on anything that looks suspect. You should have enough distance and angle on the paths to see what is coming.

So, obstacles are part of the game...if people are in the way...get pass them quickly and safely cause there aint no do overs 

Night Races

You better have lights. It will be pitch black. There are zero lights on the path. I will have glow stick markers to help you if your lights go out...but other than that...so...get a big ass light for this ride...it will be like blair witch on Esk8


Wildlife

There are the typical desert things like scorpions and 🐍...i haven’t seen any but I know they are there...Rabbits...and coyotes...those i have seen. Just so you are aware 

There will be of course plenty of h20 and power...and don’t worry youll have a good lunch too

Places to sit and hide under the shade
There are various picnic tables in the area that we will occupy. There will be places to sit, eat and ride. You may bring your own gear to set up. There will be plenty of space.

There are porto johns/out house (i will have toilet paper and baby wipes).... i will have our own area if you would like to wash your hands with clean water

To be honest...it probably would be wise for people to have their cell phone on them when they ride the trails or race.... people will be out of peoples view...and will be miles away from the starting points...
Just don’t need anyone som how getting lost out there...

In terms of distance....

Lets just say...a boosted rider will have to recharge fully after the longer distance race.

I don’t want people having to kick or walk to make it to the end...but definitely want them to wring out as much as they can on their runs and enjoy the open ride longer than a few minute dash.

Please note!

There are a total of 10 races

You may enter all of them as long as the board you are riding fits the basic speed requirement in each race.

So if you have multiple boards.....bring them...it will be a very busy day for you....plus having the extra boards lets you ride more often... the trails are there for you to explore and enjoy.

Lol...if you’re board is motorized...you’re in!

No brand hate...It all about All of you and Riding.

That’s why i made 4 ways to win $ without having to be fast.

The greatest thing about the Hollywood Races...is that when you guys race...a few moments later you almost forget you are racing because of the distance and the views. At whatever speed you tackle the course, I promise you will have a killer run.

Sunday will again be a chill day...no racing...

but each of these places I will take you be a little different and should satisfy all types of riders.

I did my best to find the lowest cost alternative to stay in Las Vegas.

I could of gone with a more contemporary hotel...but the cost would be a bit much...for this initial event.

I do realize that people may have other preferences...but for those with limited means that want an adventurer... I think this is definitely it

First Day

Below is the general area both the poker run and the treasure hunt will take place.

You will basically have free reign in these areas. Roads and sidewalks the main exception is the covered area of Fremont Street. There should be almost zero foot traffic in this area. Traffic will be very light as long as you stay away from Las Vegas Blvd...thats just too busy....but there are plenty of streets that run parallel that are wide open.

Basically you guys can run a muck as long as you obey traffic like a bicycle when you are amongst any vehicles.

Can you ride like a nut??  Sure...It would be very unlikely anyone would say anything as long as you don’t do it if front of a cop....All I can say is choose your moments if you decide to have a spirited run...and be careful....although I tout that the ride will be a fun Crazy, “Safe” adventure in downtown....we are in public.... but we aren’t racing....

The poker run was designed to be a mini tour of vegas...at your own pace...you guys make it from stop to stop....and get to see shit...no rush...so we shouldnt be mobbing the streets as we move location to location..the only mob will be at the locations we stop to draw cards...and those will be probably at a bar or public location where we wont draw negative attention...

The treasure hunt is a little more hectic...but should fan you guys out in the same general area and let you see things that you might have missed when you cruised around ...don’t worry ill make it fun and not a pain in the ass

If you note....the X is where we will set up......the red circle is the playground 

No car traffic...very little people....no cracks...no seams...no rocks....

I will have plenty of h20, toilet paper, baby wipes. There will be picnic table seating under covered areas.
I will feed you guys a good lunch ill make sure you be fat and happy...

This is only 25mins from the oasis hotel zero traffic

I will of course help ship them back you! Of course you pay for the shipping but I will bust my ass to help each of you get you boards back home safely and quickly.  I have a UPS shipping around the corner from my home and a US postal office not too far.

Let me add....for shipping...apprenently shipping from Las Vegas to California takes only one day through UPS. So basically if you send it before 3pm from Vegas...you should have your board the next day.

As for other states I don’t know. i just have experience to Cali. They do have a service at the ups where they pack it for you at an extra cost.

Pro Tip when shipping:

 Before you box the board cover it in plastic wrap. You can wrap the remote as well as the battery charger snug to the board. That way nothing is loose in the box. Also if you need cushions...hit the dollar store buy pool noodle and cut that up...use the plastic wrap to keep them in place.

Drones:

If you have drones that you want to capture video....the Hollywood races will be your best bet. There will be very little obstructions for you to fly. With awesome scenery. Everyone’s photos and videos should be amazing. If you have the follow me feature you should het some killer shots with little fear of your drone crashing into a pole or structure.

No drones at the BBQ since it is very close to the airport.

RC Cars

Bring them if you want. You can run them on Saturday and Sunday

I would offer an extra room if this hotel wasn't on the opposite side of the strip, and then some! The rooms we get are like one bedroom apartment with living/dining room, washer, dryer and full kitchen. We used to get two conjoined rooms and have family holiday gatherings in Vegas. Haven't been there since the child.

The only time you guys need to worry about a car is getting to the locations once in Vegas. And thats gonna be easy. 

Car pool or uber/lyft or taxi  we are all gonna make it to all events. Hell or high water

Its Saturday and Sunday that you need to have transportation.

On Saturday you will head out in the am to the Hollywood location till the afternoon. It will be up to you to leave and come back for the night races or you can stay. I will have food/drink,  bathtooms and power. You can ride in area if you want to hang out.

On Sunday it may turn out to be a Vendor day....while we are at the park showing off everyone stuff and wrapping up the weekend and riding all over the place. There are paths and large parking lots to just rip around right next to our BBQ.

There will be plenty of parking and hopefully get some other vendors to come and show and hang on Sunday.

Any help you guys can give getting some other vendors to participate would be awesome.

Ollinboards reached out to me and let me know he’s coming... that’s a good sign about the event

Just remember the poker run and treasure hunt will be starting around the Oasis Hotel. You guys will be running amuck in freemont, east Fremont, and art district areas for both events.


Essentially from the Stratosphere to Fremont Street that a vast area that will be able to steet ride and check shit out 

As mentioned...most of the streets are wide open ...really the only place you shouldn’t ride is on LV blvd ...there are empty streets that run parallel to it ... so need to possibly run over

I'm going to be there. I'm shipping my boards to the hotel and flying out. I wouldn't miss this shit for anything. Hopefully by then i'll have two to bring, its about time i got Jeremiah on one of my boards.  

I'm bringing things for the contest pots! Shirts and danger manuals and stickers and shit. 

It sounds like Red Ember, Ollin, Psychotiller, and LHB will be there. Maybe Carvon will show? And maybe ABEC? Because now it's starting to sound like a REAL fucking party. 

I can't wait to meet as many of you ass clowns as possible. I'll forget your names a lot, and you'll make fun of me about it. It will be great. 

My second marriage was in Vegas, and we stayed at the Luxor. Had one of those stupid limo services pick us up and cart us through the chapel like cattle. I swear the Addams family butler was the driver. Obviously that shit lasted.. hahahaha fuck that crazy ho. 

See ya'll there!

Well remember there are cash prizes, also food/drink will be provided at the locations Sat and Sun, as well as power and other crap we need. All you need to show up with is your helmet, boards and chargers...I got the rest covered.  

Although I am working on getting sponsors...this event is driven by you guys Purely.

Definitely...if this works out well..I am sure we will get more interest and gain sponsors...and thus reducing future costs to you guys...

I do plan to take this meet up further. Make it a regular thing. I think Events like this just keeps Esk8 interesting for everyone. We need to build a community with other Esk8 communities.

I would like to meet up.  I have an original Meepo with a deck swap to bamboo white wave deck. I also have GTX bamboo with off road and 97mm wheels, and a trampa under construction  I down for riding in vegas.  Not much for competition. but I will straight up race anyone.  Never rode in a pack with other electrics. I ve been riding for 30 years.  Any time you want to do a Venice beach Ca. ride I,m down.  There is already e-scooters everywhere. Our e-sk8 boards can overpower all that I saw.  About every 30 min I ran into someone that had an electric skateboard. Never seen so many in one area. there is also a tradition skate park there too. lots of surfers and skaters  I.m from Phoenix Az.  where your almost never see any

[/quote]

I hear you...but in reality it’s more about building a community and doing something with your Esk8 other than riding it around the block by yourself. As mentioned there are races( only one day) but you guys won’t be making left hand turns in a circle. You will be sent off on the course...you ride the course at your own comfort level. And enjoy the ride. 

Plus you won’t be racing all day...but you will be able to venture off and ride the trails...charge up...eat, drink...ride so more...

Don’t forget there are night races...which will be rather an adventure 

I promise you all majestic rides. Fastest or slowest ... in the end won’t matter much.

On Friday night...yes there will be a pack....

Let’s touch on the Esk8Squad Poker Run.

You will be sent to various locations to draw your cards. 

This is not a race.  

The path will guide you to various locations.... It will be up to you to decide how you want to get there. It will be a gigantic loop taking you through the art district and Downtown Las Vegas. There are many various streets/sidwalks that you can take to get to the same points. 

There will be tons of video and picture taking opportunities giving you amazing backdrops making anything you shoot dope as fuck

Should be an epic time lol

Trust me man .... these are all good dudes... it will be an esk8 nerd orgy.... the conversations on Esk8 will be freaking endless. 

I’m hoping to have @JohnnyMeduse back down here...you can bug him about vescs maybe set up something with him if you need something fixed.

Me and @MoeStooge are chatting.. he’s coming down.. you can ask him all about his 🚀 rocket stick...and check out his amazing rig.

Ive reached out to you guys. The best in Esk8. You aren’t just riders. You are builders. Some better than others...but who cares. This entire time is about learning and enjoying your rides with each other. When you get this type of group together, tech talk gets mixed in with good times. Not a bad combo

So....Sunday is the close out day...its a free ride day and day to chit chat, eat, ride, raffle and whatever you else...its open to all (except the food/drink and raffle that’s only for you guys)

We have Riptide @Alphamail, Ollinboards @chaka, @psychotiller , Red Ember boards @treenutter , Kaly.NYC @Kaly and @longhairedboy

Sunday is a good opportunity to show your wares and sell some products. Feel free to invite your customers to Sunday....just make sure they dont eat our food lol 

Also, i am considering changing the location of Sunday to the location we are holding the races. I have a feeling you may want to ride the paths again. Plus you will be familiar with the area and set yourselfs up accordingly.

![image|345x500](upload://jpX5Gz3cr4d0jd9pIZFvpTIoo5l.jpeg)ESK8SQUAD POKER RUN
*this is NOT a Race*

 You must visit ALL stops to draw your cards.

 The winning hand is determined by standard poker hand rankings. There are no wild cards. There are no “5 of a kind” hands. 

 At each stop, each player will draw a card. You may not pick the same card twice, you must place the card back and draw again.

 In the event that there is a tie, there will be a play off. High hand wins. Winner Take All

Royal Flush: Run of sequential cards from Ten to Ace, with all cards of the same suit.

Straight Flush: Run of sequential cards, all cards of the same suit, but not Ace high.

Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same rank e.g. four Aces, four Kings, etc...

Full House: Three cards of the same rank plus a pair, e.g. three Aces and a pair of Kings.

Flush: Five cards all of the same suit.

Straight (Run): Five sequential cards, not of the same suit.

Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank e.g. three Aces. Three Kings, etc...

Two Pair: Two sets of pairs e.g. a pair of Aces and a pair of Kings.

Pair: Two cards of the same rank e.g. two Aces, two Kings, etc...

High Card: If you have none of the above, then the highest value card in your hand plays.
 
Notes:
 Aces count high for all hands, e.g. a pair of Aces beats a pair of Kings.
 In a straight, an Ace can count low (e.g. A, 2, 3, 4, 5) OR high (e.g. T, J, Q, K, A) but NOT BOTH (e.g. Q, K, A,2, 3) is NOT a straight.
 If any card drawn is a duplicate of a card previously drawn, that card must be re-drawn. No hand can have
duplicate cards (e.g. you cannot have more than one King of Hearts in your hand).

Where's all the money going towards? Just towards prices. Comparing this to SPD 1 which was free and SP2 which was free to compete. Since it was free vendors generously offered skate parts as prices. 

People are traveling from far away to this and still expected to pay $250? Cant  even consider going  because  of  this, just a broke persons perspective I guess. How many people have registered for events?

Unfortunately food, food delivery , drinks, rentals of generators, gas ....and alot of etcs ( thats a secret)... i gotta make sure we are self sustaining out at the location. There aint no hitting the store real quick

We are up to 20 or so ... I do anticipate hitting my limit of 45 by August

Please note as of yet...I have zero sponsors chipping in...wasn’t my aim to snag free stuff to give away and haven’t even asked personally. All ive basically done has reached out to various Esk8 groups and companies to participate. I totally hear what you are saying. Unfortunately some of the things we need...I don’t own. ....and I am not gonna ask anyone here to bring extra stuff they don’t personally need. I want you guys to bring your Esk8 gear and whatever else you wanna bring...and that’s it...zero worries. You will be fed the entire time we are together on Sat and Sunday... and it ain’t gonna be some cheap hamburgers and hot dog meal either. 

My goal based on our October event...is to do it again. Yes...cheaper for you guys.... i am definitely thinking forward and trying to make it Reasonable...and sometimes putting a little skin in the game makes it better

And yep there are cash prizes, and i know most of you aren’t true racers...hence the other ways to win back some without racing ie. Poker run, Treasure hunt, raffle and contest...none of these have anything to do with speed but everything to do with fun. So, add some of the prizes up...and it’s possible to recoup some of the fee...if not more..If i get some sponsors, it will definitely sweeten the pots

Did some Recon the past few day in the areas you will be in...
I am totally amped for all of you. 
Downtown Las Vegas is looking awesome. The sights and sounds of the ride will be intense. It will be Friday night. He sidewalks will be filled with visitors. We should make for quite a sight for people in passing. Then gone. I have decided to guve you guys a suggested path when I give you the map of the poker run, but you make take your own if you wish. The suggested path will be designed squeeze out the most fun on the ride plus guide you away from possible traffic issues. I want you guys to be able to be on the move as much as possible when getting from point A to B...I don’t want you guys stuck making a left turn while waiting in an intersection. There is alot of going stright and making a right lol 
Safety is my number one concern with all of you. Second is to blow you away with a fun experience. I have no doubts thatbit will be.

I visited our race location as well....Happy to say...yep should blow some of you away.

I think I mentioned, races will be directed north. The AT race is located next to the start point. The rest of the area, which is two paths are yours to play with. The shortest of the paths take you down to main park entrance. That is a fun ride down and up. The second will take you all the way to lake Las Vegas. That path is long close to 10mi one way, longer if you actually go to the lake area. So, 20miles round trip...perfect pavement no seams. You will all feel like you are the kings of the world.

I feel like that is a reasonable amount, esp with everything going into this event.  Id rather see the money plowed into medals or something rather than cash rewards for races, but that's just me.

Like a gold eskatesquad medal would be awesome.

If it's $250 for travel and accommodation then that's not bad. I could probably even split that cost with someone. 

But a additional $250 doubles cost. $250x45 expected guest (minus~750 prices) is a lot of money

My comparison is to SPD1 and SPD2 which was free for mostly everyone. Grateful to those that put that together Derek and Moe

Lol really 

I am so use ti living in Vegas I guess.

Medals are awards are great...but this is a Renegade Event... 

When we get this more official...sure plastic trophies and medals for everyone...

Cost is relative. For some $250 is a fancy dinner for two. To others its two week worth of groceries. I totally get where @Titoxd10001 is saying.

Theres alot we doing new ... i dont think they have been done. Poker run, Treasure hunt, biathlon and how we are gonna do the races..more like Skiing rather than a full blow mob run. And again I repeat you be fed...and let me add to that more than that I wont serve you just Hamburgers and Hot dogs which is a large expense. You will have all sorts of stuff planned. Food, fruits, snacks, candy drinks to keep you powered up all day. We will have a food stand for all of us. Like a mini store on both days. You get what you want and leave all day long. This I feel is very important because where we be and how long we will be out there.
Some of the time you will be racing. Alot of the time you will be exploring the rest if the trails and coming back then going out again. So....there will be tons of riding on Saturday & Sunday...it will be ridiculous I just know it. None of you will be able to contain yourself once you get on the trail.... if you think this is a nice flat trail ....it is....but with with dips, turn, long gradual down slopes, straight aways deep into the desert.

Plus some other stuff as well which is a surprise.

adding a barrier section like a bicycle cyclocross race where you have to jump off the board and run over some obstacle and back on the board sounds cool.   a dog on a leash section you have to get through maybe.

All I can say is by all means tag along. But part of this whole weekend is to participate, learn and bond with these esk8 freaks. I totally get it, if you have certain time, family or financial limitations.

All I can say is if you can swing the time, money and effort to roll out with us....Can’t see any reason you wouldn’t (NOTE my n’t for the record) want to join in the reindeer games.

  However, a caveat will be bringing my five year old. Don't get me wrong, MF'r ripps and has his own board!

But, I am reaching out to see if there are any wives/girlfriends/daughters who are down to babysit some so I can tag dome on with the boys if we come. This is a strategic move to get permission from my wife!

Really who’s gonna fuck with him hahahah

No worries not even on Friday night is a problem...you will be in public areas at all times..so no age restrictions....there are kids with families everywhere...even at 3am hahah...



Oh let me add if there is traffic downtown ....is not heavy traffic as you would imagine, you may even consider it light...because it moves.... it will be very safe to use the bike lanes to pass any cars...there will be parts when you have the whole street and sidewalk to yourselfs....by 8pm the entire art district and parts of downtown are basically a ghost town... there will be dark alley ways as well....for me its super safe because I know every inch of where you guys gonna be....for you guys...it will be a fucking thrill ride lol

There is. It just takes FOREVER. 
When Greyhound hits Southern California it has a lot of stops and feels like it takes forever.
I'm fine with the bus honesty. Would like to spend as little as possible on this trip, so trying to get ahold of old friends that live down there for a couch to sleep on.
And I've gotta get someone hired asap that can cover me for a few days.

Let’s talk racing

Long race - 

about 7 miles - one tunnel, two bridges 
Out then back - fairly flat - gradual inclines - smooth, but some points have course sand but light - all bike path

This is a preview of the first mile of your race. After the tunnel there are two more bridges. From start to finish it’s about 7 miles - no street - all bike path

24mph B-class race.  How are we going to police the 24mph Cap.  Could take the course range and if you break out of a 24mph avg speed it's a disqualification. Could also have a 3rd party be radar gunned to verify top speed. Or a combination of both.

In the mean time, I can do my job anymore since it's physically demanding.  MURICA!

I don't see you on the group. 

Once you have the app running, click the link I provided from your PHONE and it should open the app and join

EDIT: Go into the Telegram app and SEARCH for “RenegadeLasVegas”

OK, I just changed a few settings and made the group public. No idea why the link stopped working, a few people joined earlier

Go into the Telegram app and SEARCH for "RenegadeLasVegas" to join let me know if that works

Please dress accordingly.  The evening are cooler feeling that the temp says due to lack of humidity. So definitely be prepared for being chilly once the sun goes down.

It all starts by meeting 6pm-7pm Friday Night we Rally at Atomic Liquors on East Fremont 

Poker Run sheets will be distributed at that time.

There is plenty of street or parking lot parking if you want to drive to the location. I will have a generator for you to charge up if you need to - plus drinks and snacks - so travel light.

This a poker run. Not a race. You will be stopping at various points to draw cards.

If you have not squared up with me, pleas do it by then.

A few sweet prizes for the winner.

..... 

The treasure hunt follows after the Poker Run

OK, you are persuasive.  My China trip was extended an extra week and came back too soon to go direct Vegas and too late to jump back on a plane without a family revolt lol.  Really bummed, had been waiting for this forever, now have to wait another year.  I will see Michael at CES and try to recreate the routes at least haha, but not the spirits of eSk8 shenanigans past.  Maybe @Kaly and I can convince Michael to so a Spring version in NYC to complement Fall Vegas!

Had to settle for consolation prize of Broadway Bomb this weekend in NYC, barely able to find parts to pull back together Evo 4wd sixshooters build from Evovle World cup trip.  Also finally got that reconfigured and actually working lol.

Kudos to you guys, jealous here!

Hello all we put together a new group on Facebook  which was inspired by the inclusive vibe that dominated the Las Vegas gathering to do the following: 

"The purpose of this group is to push the development of Personal Electric Vehicles (PEV's). This includes but is not limited to 1, 2, 3, 4, and above wheeled, as well as non wheeled PEV's. What you choose to ride is your choice, there is no right or wrong here so show us what you got and what it can do!"  

We would love to have you all a part of it!
