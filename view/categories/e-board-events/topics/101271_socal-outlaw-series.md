Looking fwd to the 2020 season. Had a good time with the SOS series. SoCal riders progressed to a formidable group that will rival all comers.
We had production boards batteling DIY and some surprisingly fast competitive Urethane Racing which was very entertaining to watch.
We had @psychotiller, Lazyrolling, Riptide Sports and Skate The Wedge support for both points Series along with cash payouts for podiums in both classes at every event.
Race format and rules were kept simple. We ran qualifying, heat races and Mains. The racing started around 9am and we had checkered flag and podium before lunch. A quick hit and git on a borrowed surface with no shut downs.
The fast and furious group will continue to grow but 2020 will be with an emphasis on an entry level class.

The ‚ÄúBomber Class‚Äù will have a qualifying time Cut-Off limit to seperate itself from the ‚ÄúPro Class.‚Äù

A portable transponder loop timing system is a goal for this season.

The Objective for 2020 is to have a place to develop your raceboarding skill and equipment. Success with SOS19 showed us that Raceboarding can be done from the back of your car for a couple of grand in equipment. As grass roots as it gets.

Would like to see more manufacturers getting involved backing riders.
2020 schedule, ‚Äúin the works‚Äù

Any input, potential race spots, format changes or thoughts are appreciated üèÅ
