I saw the Vegas Renegade event that took place last week, oh how i wished i could be there!
Unfortunately i live on the other side of the world, but luckily for us, the country has a monthly 'Car Free Sunday', where the city has a closed off car loop so that people with different mobility devices can legally ride on the roads for the day. 

This gives us the opportunity to meet up for the day to catch up as well as skate. Here's what went down


This one's a Bamboo GT, deck swapped with an Evo painted red, and Eboosted's enclosure.  ![20181028_091646|690x388](upload://ln7OE6sCRSuwK7z4PCG8n9agyRA.jpeg) 

The Hoyt remote, and it does feel really nice as what many have mentioned on the group buy thread.  ![20181028_090132|690x388](upload://bCgy1vH7wTV8M18An8JTq3p8WET.jpeg)

The Haggyboard drive train!! Got to see it in person. The truck hangar is wide! Almost as wide as an Evolve truck.

Graham with his Trampa, and with @Nowind's Helicals. But he's running BLDC... couldn't hear the silence :man_shrugging: ![20181028_100820|690x388](upload://rFbqgoVfLYS1iS3xCVdmbzfxA1R.jpeg) 

Then two hours in, it RAINED??? Retreated to the Mcdonalds nearby
Was an extremely short ride, due to the sudden weather change, but it was great to meet and catch up with everyone.

This event was also to meet and collect stuff from group buys etc. My bag was full of stuff!

I'm not sure if they're in stock yet. I heard many have been trying to get hold of them as well.

360 shot taken on the Insta One X![1|690x360](upload://kp3sfM2VT7T8bUFvK2uVlLnhZ6V.jpeg) 

This shot we found that Chris was the only one without a full face helmet so one of the guys took the courtesy and gave him one :joy:
