So if you’re under 21, there’s no way you can win?

I think exception for the under 21 would obviously be in order.

Thanks for pointing that out, I'll add something.

Great news guys! Eric from Shredlights out of San Diego CA has offered up a combo pack to the winner! That's 80 bucks of waterproof lighting that mounts on any skateboard, guaranteed to reveal those pesky bandits in the woods and increase safety stats by 10 points!!

if you're under 21, you automatically enter a challenge mode in which you have 5 minutes to figure out how to scam a beer, and if successful, you can still take the cup. During that challenge mode, people over 21 must pause drinking then compete with each other with full mugs if the challenge mode fails.
