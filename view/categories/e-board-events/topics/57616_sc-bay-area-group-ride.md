Hello folks! My name is sun and I am the social coordinator for the Santa Cruz Eboard club (sceboards.com). In collaboration with the generous folks at Inboard. Our ride will be next Saturday on 9th at 4:30pm at
[701 W. Cliff Dr, Santa Cruz, CA 95060]. You will be able to test out the Inboard Monolith 1 or just come on the ride! Feel free to just show up but an RSVP would go a long way (RSVP by shooting me a DM).

 Thanks everybody and happy riding!

Sorry, unfortunately it's too far from me, and I have no car to get there with my board.
