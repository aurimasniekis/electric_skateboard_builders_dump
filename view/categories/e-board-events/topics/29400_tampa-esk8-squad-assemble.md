Let's get organized! Calling all eSk8ers in the Tampa Bay area. If we can amass enough esk8ers, we'll organize a meetup! Come show off your latest board, exchange tips with other builders, or just enjoy a casual cruise! Let's make this thing happen! Feel free to introduce yourself and/or suggest possible meetup locations/dates here.

@Michaelinvegas Hit us up with eSk8 Squad Tampa merch! :sunglasses:

If we could get at least five or six people to come ride, I'd call that a success. First off, where? Downtown River Walk maybe? A bike trail? Somewhere between Tampa and Orlando? Secondly, when? And thirdly, who can come? How many Tampa eSk8ers are out there?

JoAnn and TyHuelle are usually up for a ride.  Our favorite spot is the Courtney Campbell Causeway bike and walk path along the ocean.  We will ride anywhere (City Walk/downtown Tampa, vinoy park/downtown St. Pete, Bayshore blvd, Dunedin causway, Howard Park, any bike/nature trail, etc...) since we have both street wheels and All-Terrain Tires.  Also love trips to Daytona beach...

Cheers,

Ty

Where is that spot? We will sometimes do Flat woods and 7 Oaks.

Cheers,

Tyhuelle

Hi @jess.t.moody! Thanks for starting the thread! Should we start a facebook group to help plan meet ups? Haven't seen one for our area yet and happy to set up! @tyhuelle

In Orlando but will travel to Tampa, or anywhere in Florida for the matter. I can also host a group ride here in Orlando - the bike trail is a few blocks from my office and goes to downtown, also lots of cool spots around Disney.
