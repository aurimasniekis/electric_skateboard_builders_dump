Anyone going to Veko2018 here? I haven't checked if they accept electric boards but I don't see why not at least on the fun rides. I'll prolly head up there this year and it would be fun to meet up with other esk8ers there. Hopefully my board is ready by then also :)

This event takes plage in a really nice part of Norway. I’ve never ridden “Stalheimskleiva” that they are having the longboard events in but it’s pretty sick. I drove by today and I’m not doing that without breaks lol 😂 

A video showing some more of what’s going on during this week.
