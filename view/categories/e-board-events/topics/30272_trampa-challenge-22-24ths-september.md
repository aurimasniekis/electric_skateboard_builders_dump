We want to announce the upcoming 2017 Trampa Challenge at Hales Superbole Bike and Board Park.

The Trampa Challenge will be part of The 'Heart of The Hill' festival. 22nd-24th September at Hale's. 
We are running an exclusive electric mountain board obstacle race this year!
But it's not all about racing and competition:

Three days of music over three different stages, beer and food festival, camping, beatbox and graffiti workshops, comedians, flood lit big air best trick freestyle bikes or boards (Â£200 first prize!), 4 man ATBA BX races and more!  Keep your eyes open for updates and the ticket sales which will be out soon. 

Hale's has been alive for 10yrs this September! Get down and celebrate with us!
