Lots of smack talk going around about who has the fastest board. Well it's time to prove it!

**Date:** Sunday, August 13, 2017 
**Time:** 10am
**Location:** 23600-23840 Madison St, Torrance, CA 90505-- https://goo.gl/maps/uwxWFXtVEh42
***Helmets required for official runs***
**Performance Tests:**
50m race (test of acceleration)
Top speed radar test
Figure 8 time attack- 50m cones x 5 laps (test of acceleration and turning)

I will bring my cameras and get some video of the event. I'll also bring a radar gun so we can accurately measure top speeds. The records will be recorded and shared so that others can try and chase after your best times. 

We will have 2 classes. 
**Stock class**- For production boards. Open to discussing the rules, but I think small changes like pulleys or wheels are fine, but no changes to programming, batteries, or motors. 
**Open class**- For custom boards. Do whatever you want to build the baddest beast around. 

So who is in? 

Confirmed so far:
@NummThumz
@MoeStooge
@BigBoyToys
@pennyboard
@thisguyhere
@psychotiller
@DaviDjembe
@ChrisChaput + waif
@mccloed
@Titoxd10001
Only lets me mention 10 users, but the following also confirmed:
EliteEBoards
JetskiMark

Do we need a wheelchair class? Bring your boards and a jockey. I'll still be waiting on my Raptor 2, so I'm willing to hop on a spare board.

Added. It will be fun just to be out there and watch the action. I can probably use some help (if you are open to it) with cameras since I will bring a couple out there.

Tentative? Do or do not...there is no try. :slight_smile: Completely understand about the confidence. Make a couple of runs and watch some of the good riders and I guarantee you will be a better rider at the end of the day.

lol!! Jason is the only one really smack talking. No big deal... that's his style :joy:. But I love what you're organizing @NummThumz! I'll be there with my V3 setup. We should also test the "smoothest" riding board and the one that handles best as well... all good things to consider besides just top speed and acceleration. Cheers for organizing this! Looking forward to skating with you all.

Sweet! I think the figure 8 test will give us an idea of handling. It will depend on the board and the rider. Open to other ideas to get at the smoothest aspect.

Performance Tests:

100m race (test of top speed)

[/quote]

May I suggest that you don't make two out the three "performance" tests drag races?

Maybe keep the 50m or 100m drag race but then have a "top speed race" where each participant has ample room to build speed and get a "radar gun" time in the books. Then focus on something where you have to be able to corner over a much longer distance.

All this emphasis on doing a "stunt" that's over with in a few seconds doesn't make a lot of sense to me. If it's something that we never do on our own for fun, we shouldn't act as if THAT is the essence of electric skateboarding. My 2 cents ...

@chaka  Ship me a dog for this fight and I'll drag race it on your behalf!

## \#16 Posted by: NummThumz Posted at: 2017-08-03T07:12:18.839Z Reads: 145

```
Sure. I'm open to that. So maybe keep the 50m for acceleration. I think the 100 would basically go to the board with the top speed anyways. Then add a top speed run with radar gun speed as the measurement. The figure 8 time attack is going to be about cornering over a distance. I think that one should be 5 laps...maybe 10, so it's really about getting into and out of the corners and putting some speed in before the next turn. Does that cover the cornering over a longer distance?

Right now I'm reaching out to my 75 pound waif of an ex girlfriend to see if she still has the knee pads and leather outfits that I bought her. She can jockey my rocket in the drag race. I don't look nearly as good in drag ...

What I am interested in is testing the performance of what really matters. How fun is it to ride and how long does the ride last. 

My boards are way too easy to reconfigure for a drag race, everyone will say I cheated because I switched my drive pulleys for each event! Maybe if I do it fast enough nobody will notice?

I called this out in the initial post when I talked about the stock class. Pulleys and wheel changes are fine. I'm also open to talking about what we set as "rules."

As I think about the programming piece, that will be tough to monitor so I am thinking we need to allow programming changes as well. Others agree?

  I'm happy my  Secret  location  could be of assistance!! Should be a really fun Area. I've been going there for 10+ years no problems. I'll see if I can get down there this week  and  double check the conditions / road surface. Location Is a parking lot on the backside of the airport. I look forward  to seeing you all and the turn out of this gathering. So I can have a better  understanding  of the needs and wants of the Esk8  Community, riders & people attending a ESk8 event. FYI  I am currently in the works with putting a full scale  esk8 event together at a legitimate venue this year in Southern California  including : vendors, Booths, demos, music, food & Esk8 activity . I Just met with the venue today to  Walk the grounds  & work some details out Including  Venue cost, event Insurance, event Date etc.  And O Boy does it sure look promising.  I also invited some people to the August 13ths SoCal performance Day  on my  newly created  IG page @EliteEboards  so pls  expect guests

Somebody needs to take the reigns. Got some promoter advice. 1 Make it about building the novice and box stock classes.  If you have the board counts in the lower classes the elite class happens on its own. 2 Keep your rule book razor thin.  Thick rule books ruin board counts. 3 make your word law. Racers are whiny bitches if you let them think they can sway your rule. Be clear how your show is going to run. Draw the line in the Sand. Listen to the Racers but don't change the line during an event. Don't be afraid to say "if you don't like the way things are run, go run somewhere else." If your consistent with people they will know what to expect and they will respect what your about even if they don't agree with you. 4 as a promoter you have to be an island. Removing yourself from groups and clicks will keep Racers from having a bias perspective of your business. Good luck👍

Run whatcha brung. Yeah we're shit talking about whos board does what. More importantly it's about getting people like you on your Box Stock boards making runs. The not so fast make up the majority and the numbers are more important than the speed we make. All we gotta do is find another Box Stock guy and your racing. I hope 10 Box Stockers like you show up and run.

I agree. RIght now I have a Boosted D+ v1 that I will be running to see what I can put up with a stock board. I am also waiting on the R2 to arrive...so another excuse to do some runs on another weekend in the future. Having some extra hands with cameras will be a big help! Don't stress about the type of board. Getting some practice will help and we will be establishing metrics for a bunch of these stock boards.

I think Jason is on his way to China...or at least that was the plan on his last update. And Moja is in Portland for the 13th. Don't think we will have a Raptor 2 at this event...but there's always next time.

Hey guys. Yeah I'm in China now. Got a few factories to visit tomorrow then planning to build 50-100 Raptors by end of week. Fingers crossed everything goes smoothly, praying for no problems....

@Hummie @Jinra saw you guys on one of Moja vids in sanfran demo event.. looked like a great day, bit disappointed I can't be there. So now you guys have a taste of the raptor 2 performance. So what do ya think?

Hey Jason,

The Raptor 2 is really great stuff. I loved the great initial torque and the super organized internals. extra wide thane have me confidence to negotiate turns without fear of slippage.

The hubs are very powerful as you say, though the ride is noticeably more bumpy than my 75a abecs. Though this is to be expected. 

It's unfortunate the remote still has to be calibrated every time you turn it on. Not a major deal, but a bit out of place considering the refinement of the product.

Another thing that threw me off (except the raptor) was that the power "button" wasn't really a button at all, but a flip switch. It was a bit misleading as i was trying to press where it was already switched to and it totally looks like a button given the waterproof cover.

Acceleration wise it definitely beat all the contenders out there including myself. I only wish there was a dual 6374 setup in low kv to go head to head. Unfortunately my motors was too high of a kv to keep up. Still glad I was able to hold my own in the speed department though.

Lastly, Moja and co went out for a night ride in SF, but unfortunately the fet or something on the switch blew on the pre production raptor 2, leaving it in always on position. He had to take off the enclosure lid and restart the receiver. He assured me this was fixed on the post production model however.

The post production board was nice and quiet. Torque was great.  Top speed was maybe 26 it seemed but didn't test.  For me the board felt higher and more unstable than I like. 
I heard there were 3 crashes throughout the day. 

wish I had the new MOTors so as to have a hub to compare against.

For Sunday, we should have enough cones and people to set up a practice area and a separate spot for the official runs. I'm thinking we should do the top speed run and 50m acceleration tests first so that we have full battery charges for those. Then do the figure 8 time attack last. What does everyone else think?

Also, how do people feel about pushes on the 50m race. Personally, I don't think a push or two will make a difference, but some people have felt like a push is an advantage. Thoughts?

I dont think everyone has sensored motors so a push would be required for some. 

My setup is sensored though, so either way is fine with me. Between my brother and I we have 100 cones so I think we are good no matter what we wanna do haha. Should we consider a course with a few turns since we have lots of cones? A figure 8 doesnt sound as fun but it would be easier to replicate for future events if we wanted to compare performance. Thoughts?

Ohh and a 100m drag would be great too since we have Raptor2 performace number to compare  for the 100m from Moja's drag video.

I think doing the top speed run 1st is a good idea as well since our speed drops proportionally with voltage.

I like the idea of using the figure 8 so that if the guys in NYC or SF or Australia or wherever want to compare to our times, it's easy to replicate. But AFTER we do the figure 8 runs for everyone that wants to log a time, we could do a road course or something just for fun.

We will do some sort of road course setup at the end of the day for fun. I'd like it to have an equal amount of left and right hand turns to make it equal for goofy and regular foot skaters. Not sure what fits that bill, but will check with google and see what I can find.

I could be wrong but I think with a course that consists of a speed run or 2 to 4 x similar radius corners, say a figure 8 or a oval, the limitations to the Stooges setup will not be exposed because he will dial in gearing/ handling to suit. In fact the potential is there to dial in the handling for a specific radius or distance for example, this is what they do in dirt track...
But hey what do I know, i'd like to see a eSk8 race in a velodrome.
I'm not saying the Stooge will win, but neither will he be embarrassed, his approach while different is not novel. Depending on the trial it may suit best? and by having a specific setup it could be best or worst... and with that thought the Stooge is the only one I've heard mention they are doing shakedown runs to get set up for Sunday. What I would put money on is Moe is a racer and over the day he will tune and adapt to find speed cause going fast is fun!

Posted about performance day on Reddit and someone brought up ciclavia taking place that day. They shut down certain streets in LA to car traffic and allow walkers and bikers (assuming eakate is allowed too) to use them instead. It's happening Sunday from 9-4 and runs from San Pedro to Wilmington. Don't think it will impact us, but might be an option for those that want a cruise after the days events.

Yup, Gt2b for us as well. I guess it's possible but not likely.  What I suggest is we do an all stand beside radio check. Every one and all boards on. One at a time 10' wide open throttle then full brake stop. Any other board twitches hopefully we can find it. Best to be part of a pit meeting. Glad you brought it up.

wondering why the air tire would get better grip than a pu wheel.  could it have just been the trucks with the air wheels were looser or you could lean into it more or something?  now I want to try that course.

You're only as good as your contact patch. The air in the tire or the trucks were not the factor. Rubber grips better then PU, that was the factor here.

Rubber tires are way grippier than urethane. The trick is finding low rolling resistance with rubber that is comparable to urethane.

Today was the most fun Ive had since I started esk8ing. We had a great group of guys out there! We saw a ton of different styles and approaches today and we all learned a ton. There were definately some mean machines out there! I cant wait to see what everyone will bring to future events! 

Speaking of which, let's keep this momentum going and start planning our next meet up!  My brothers been talking with our local kart track to see if we can set up a day for us to use their track for an hour or two. Would you guys be intetested in that for a future event? And how about a group ride in the meantime? I know a few ideas were thrown out there today( trails in the OC, San Gabrial river, some spot in the Santa Clarita, San Fernando valley area, etc).

Special thanks to @NummThumz, for putting in all that work today timing us and meauring speeds. You're awesome bro! 

And another special thanks to @ChrisChaput and @pennyboard for trying their hands jockeying my beast!

@MoeStooge, thanks! The friendly competition really added to the excitement today. I'll have to think hard about what to do for next time cuz I know you're gonna bring the heat! But I think you must have missed my last figure 8 run just above 49 secs! 😎. Your top speed was untouchable though, Im not even sure Id want to go that fast if I could! 😂. Also here's a link to a live video from yesterday of my 300lb gorilla self beating your 10.2sec 100m run from today with a sub 9 sec pass. 😉. Who knows what it would do with normal weight jocky! I cant wait until the next spur gear vs hubs showdown!

Pulling down the footage to my hard drive as I type this. Love the idea of planning some new events in the near future. We could shoot for 1 event per month or so. The kart tracks sounds like a great idea. Does the track have walls or runoff into the grass/sand?

i made it through security at LAX! Customs in Barcelona will be the real test. Got pre-approval from British Airways for my flight from Barca to London, getting through security in London will be an adventure as well. I was just super chill with them and offered to field any questions they had about any of the components. Took about 20 minutes of wiping down my suitcase to get the okay

I was able to review the video and here are the results as best I can tell. Some of the video on the figure 8 was out of focus due to people walking in front of the camera. Next time, I will have a better idea of where to set up. I should have at least one clear run of most people. I think I got the names right, but lots of people were switching jackets, so I may have mixed someone up. Once the video is ready, you'll have a chance to correct any of the ones that I got wrong.

**Top Speed Test**
Moe- 72 kph (44.7 mph)
Ian (Artie's board)- 55 kph (34.2 mph)
Will (Psychotiller's board)- 53 kph (32.9 mph)
Derek- 52 kph (32.3 mph)


**50M Dash**
Chris (Derek’s board)- 5.50 sec
Ian- 5.97 sec
Derek- 6.09 sec


**Figure 8 Time Attack (2 cones 20m apart; Start finish 5m behind first cone)**
Derek- 49.19 sec
Moe- 50.63
Chris- 52.65
Matt- 57.4 
Ian- 58.97
Will (Psychotiller's board)- 60.15

**100m**
Ian- 10.22 sec @ 54 kph (33.6 mph)

I think an awd like @BigBoyToys but with pneumatic wheels would be the ultimate set-up, cause right now that board is limited only by traction and rider ability, and pneumatics would solve the traction problem and make it more stable for the rider as well.

I didn't know I had his other motor out while Ian was doing his speed run.  It was a Single Motor run.  Sooo top recorded speed for a single motor  in the USA?  Maby we should sanction our runs like  Southern California Timing Association does for Bonneville.  Make em official.
[/quote]

I can set the esk8tests.com site up for tracking the different records that we want to maintain. Single engine and dual engine make sense. SCTA has all sorts of classes based on motor type, frames, streamlining, etc. But they have also been doing this for a long time and have gathered interest slowly across multiple classes. I think we start simple with a few classes (stock, modified) and motor types (single, dual, quad?) along with an overall. We can always add to it as interest grows.

**Video update-** got a bunch of editing done last night. I think this will end up being 4 videos when I'm done. The first one will be an overview of the day with the fastest run in each category. Should be ready this weekend. Then I will do a separate video for each event (top speed, 50m, and figure 8) with each person's best run.  Those will take a few days to put each together. I think this will be the best approach because it will keep the total video time of each down and give a chance to measure the views on each event to see where public interest lies. 

I did interviews with a few people that day, but the wind made them difficult to hear. Moe's is useable but the rest won't make the cut. Lesson learned- I'll bring a mic with wind screen next time. 

For anyone that made a run that day (or whose board made a run), post any details about your board that you want here and I'll add it as a text in the video so people know what type of board did what.
