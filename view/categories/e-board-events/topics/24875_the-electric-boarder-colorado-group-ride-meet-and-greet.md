This is our first meet and greet for our growing Colorado community, come out bring whatever board you currently got working or want to show off and we'll take a short ride up the Platte river road trail, and can come back for some drinks, a bite of food, some socializing, board sharing and get charged up in between to ride more. Bring your charging cords, I'll try to remember to bring a charging bar so we can all charge up some places inbetween. There's really no set end time, the way I usually did these in NYC is we would ride a few miles, hang, re-charge/socialize then ride some more. 

 If you can't make it at the very beginning contact us in the whatsapp group to get a idea of our location along the way, you are welcome to join any time of day as long as people still have a charge and want to ride. We'll be meeting up in the parking lot of the Target since it should have adequate parking for anyone who needs a place to park a car, and its close to an entrance to the platte river trail. If you absolutely cannot use whatsapp to contact us please PM me on here or on facebook and I will give you my direct number to get in touch with us.
