Wuz good Esk8 peeps! 

Putting together an early evening group ride. Meet and mingle around 4pm on April 12 and skate when we all think it's time. Hopefully the weather will be awesome. 

It will be a nice chill ride by the ocean. 

Inboard is still checking if they can come down and bring the Van-O-Boards down and will let me know.

Jerry at Carvon will be making a cameo appearance as well! 

Hope some of you can make it out, it would be awesome to meet any of you! 

Let me also add, (if not coming to ride with me wasn't enough) I will be giving away a set of front and rear Shredlights....courtesy of Shredlights!
----

So, there will be a giveaway for a complete set of Shredlights (2 front lights and two rear lights - that's a $79.98 right there!) I'll figure out a fun way to win them!
