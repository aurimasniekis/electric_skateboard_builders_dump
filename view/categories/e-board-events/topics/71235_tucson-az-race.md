Hi all, 

I wanted to gauge whether there were people in Tucson, AZ who were interested in having an esk8 race.  I was also curious how many esk8ers there are in Tucson.  Anyway, if you are an esk8er in Tucson, leave a reply; it would be fun to put together a race or a group ride of some sort, or just see how many there are.

Thanks for the reply.  That would be awesome. So far, doesn't seem like there are enough for a race though, lol. I hope there are more esk8ers in and around Tucson.  If anyone else might be able to make it please chime in.

Tap the Boosted and Evolve pages on F-book.  There's possibly a few knuckle heads in those groups near you I'm sure.
