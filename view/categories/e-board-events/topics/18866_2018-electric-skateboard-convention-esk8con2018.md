I had some time to think about an electric skateboard convention and incorporate some of the ideas that I‚Äôve had ‚Ä¶. So, here are my thoughts‚Ä¶.I hope you can amuse me and follow my thought process along. I‚Äôll do my best to keep it concise. (I warn you know, this ain‚Äôt short)
 
In my opinion, electric skateboards are divided in groups‚Ä¶DIY built boards and Production (pre-built) boards, which are divided further by brands i.e. Boosted boards, evolve, acton, inboard etc.‚Ä¶The list seems to get larger every month with a new esk8 company popping up.  Although we all Esk8, we are divided by a kind of brand loyalty, which keeps us divided.

**Convention**
**Noun**
**1.	A meeting or formal assembly, as of representatives or delegates, for discussion of and action on particular matters of common concern.**

https://www.facebook.com/events/260834791028210??ti=ia

Simply.  We need to unite.  DIY and Production need to be under one flag per se.  Sure, everyone involved in Esk8 has got their own angle...but at the end of the day, no matter which Esk8Squad you roll with, we all Just SHRED.  And that is what we all have in common.  We love esk8.  We love it for the ride. We love it for a million other reasons‚Ä¶especially those of us that build them.  

As DIYers we take pride in our builds, no matter how crappy it looks...We made them.  We love our babies! Our passion for esk8 shows.  It shows in how we interact with each other.  We take time to explain to complete strangers, how we did what we did.  We motivate each other.  We have built a virtual community, a DIY Esk8 neighborhood.  And the ‚Äòhood‚Äô is getting bigger. 

The popularity of Esk8 has grown over the past few years, and seems to be really accelerating in 2017.  We‚Äôve seen recently new Kickstarters from our favorite vendors, companies on Shark Tank, a bloom of Chinese manufactures with esk8 offerings.  Also, there are more people going the DIY route. But it‚Äôs still not common.  We are in clusters, pockets of builders and riders spread around the globe. But this is how trends kind of go‚Ä¶Those pockets, become areas, then regions‚Ä¶till it‚Äôs everywhere‚Ä¶It sounds like a fad.  I don‚Äôt think it is.  

We‚Äôve seen esk8 touted as the ‚Äúlast mile solution‚Äù‚Ä¶ How true is that?  Do you look at your board and tell yourself, (in a hipster tone) ‚ÄúEsk8 is great. I don‚Äôt have to huff it back on foot!‚Äù It is so much further from that, for most of us these days.  If we could really put a FLUX Capacitor on our boards, we‚Äôd ride till the wheels fell off or couldn‚Äôt feel our feet anymore.  

We are a community of DO‚Äôers. We get it done.  ‚ÄúBuilt. Not Bought.‚Äù  Someone posted here on the forum one time.  I thought to myself, ‚ÄúThat is so true.‚Äù (of course on varying levels) . We are ambassadors of this hobby.  We try to bring people into our squad.  So, it make sense that this interest in having a huge shindig, bringing all of esk8 into one parking lot was born on this forum.  It‚Äôs a great idea.  I love it.  And it has been on my mind before, but wasn‚Äôt sure if it was the right time to open my mouth.  I guess this is a good time.

I‚Äôd like to again, propose that we have a convention in 2018 that brings in as many aspects of Esk8 in to the fold‚Ä¶.My way. LOL‚Ä¶. Here we go‚Ä¶.Let me begin by describing in general what I would want to see‚Ä¶I‚Äôd like to see all the major players there.  Representing their company.  All the DIY Esk8 Vendors and other smaller companies involved in esk8 in some way. I want races.  I want build competitions. I want guest speakers. I want demo rides. I want group rides.  I want it open to the public.  I want us to be covered by the news.  I want a group picture! Lol  

How do we get there? 

First, as mentioned above, we need to unite.  We need to organize ourselves under one body. We are stronger as squad than as individuals.  We as a group need to be recognized.  It will help us influence major players to attend our convention.  And that in turn will make it a more attractive for other Esk8ers and Noobs to attend.   SO, we need to grow it.  We build on esk8 as the core foundation.  It‚Äôs how we all roll. And you know when people see you, they wish they could have their own and roll with you.  We are the example, because it‚Äôs the coolest thing they‚Äôve ever seen.  So, we all must be ambassadors, marketers and even sales people.  We need to promote Esk8, so we can promote the group and our convention. Sure, there are boosted and evolve groups and they have their ‚Äòfanboys‚Äô.  But we can still shred the same path. So, why not just do that? We need to project a sense of community within all the different factions of esk8.

Second, we need to build a team working on all angles of the convention. Date, location, vendors, sponsors, events, event locations, logistics, batteries, hotel, marketing, and costs. We also need a team to constantly promote our Esk8Squad to individuals and groups by any means. Like through social medial, facebook and Instagram and other means such as merchandise. This will increase chances of having an awesome turn out for a convention.

This all takes time and money‚Ä¶and obviously help from anyone of you that is willing to lend a hand in your own way.
 
 As we progress forward we can adjust things to suit our needs as issues arise.  But we need to start.

And I‚Äôm going to start this thing off by asking each of you to fill out my google form.

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2eRd2g5zrQZ45YC-07PSJoTkXpZrl-QOQk2KYYGW8btXjsg/viewform?c=0&w=1


It‚Äôs a slew of questions.  But also, it will show us how we currently stand.  Please fill it out even if you will not be attending. 
I will be adding more updates and ideas on this thread‚Ä¶.and use this to talk ‚Äúout loud‚Äù‚Ä¶. This is about as much typing I can do for now...as we progress I will expound on my ideas and provide more detail.

I think it's about time we unite, compare, and learn from each other. This forum started out as a great resource for the diy community in the sense that there wasn't much out there at the time and there where a few products that most people wen after (like SK3 motors). Now, the options for motors for example are broad, including hub motors now. On a forum, it's hard to compare motors for example against eachother. In real life, we test them, and thats one benifit I could see to the community from an event like this.

I agree thoroughly. I think it would be great to get a large group of us together in somewhere Iike Las Vegas or NYC this year, but I worry if we aim for something so large, as was discussed in the original thread, _this year_ we will be disappointed. Aiming for 2018 for something as large as we are all hoping would be wise to allow for proper planning.

Also, quick question on the questionnaire....on the question about batteries, is 9s more common than 10s? 9s is listed but 10s is not and it seemed a little odd to me.

OK, good push start @Michaelinvegas !  By organize under one body, you mean form an association org 501c etc?  Surely there is something already in place?  If not, then who is this Uwe Schall who registered all the esk8.org esk8.info etc?  Maybe he is on this forum, speakup?

This sounds awesome. If it's in Vegas, I can bring my family (Wife and 2 y/o)  as it's hard to leave the kid at this age. We have a timeshare off strip and can probably can get a second "room" (it's like a one bedroom apartment with living room and kitchen) if a few people (or family) wants to stay there for a small fee of $500 for 7 days. I'll have to talk to the wife as it's hers.

Totally understandable. I figured knowing the 10s count would be more useful for you than the 9s count...I think I've seen maybe 1 or 2 9s builds.


...also, you have email on there twice.

thank you everyone....


and let me explain my reasoning for choosing Las Vegas over any other destination ...

It Vegas. It was made for conventions.  Plenty of hotel and Timeshare options (as @Mikenopolis mentioned) all relatively close.
Nothing in Las Vegas is FAR. At the most it should take you no more than 30 mins to get to your destination within the city.  
There is plenty of parking at any location we stage our events at...Park, University ...on the street....No issues
Plenty places to explore.  Ride from the Stratosphere to Downtown Fremont on the street with minimal street traffic in the day and evenings. (smooth all the way) Huge parking lots.(UNLV has a great one)  Parks with paths, we have them in nice large loops.  Tons of food options from Fancy to simple.(helps those with tight budgets) if you fly in....Mccarran airport is on the strip.  You fly into the middle of Vegas, literally. Almost ZERO rain.  We have a n% chance that we will have clear skies.  Night rides are safe and fun while street riding.  With minimal lighting, just a flash light in hand...you can take a night tour for Downtown Las Vegas...(yeah, I wanna do some sort of ESK8 beer/juice crawl mixed in with a treasure hunt)  A lot of people can just drive here. We will be meeting at various spots, and the easiest way is just to drive since can we get to our destination in less than 30 mins.  So driving time will be very limited.

These are the main reasons for my suggestion, there probably a few other reasons that I forgot to add.

I think it's good to plan out for next year as I simply can't make it this year. At my work we can only have 4 people out on vacation at a time and we pick dates based on seniority so I can't get any time off on the good holidays and need like 6 months notice at least.

Yep...and that's many other people issue as well....lead time is so important on events such as this.  Especially, when members are coming from far away.....oh....and let me add another reason.....

we got stuff to do 24/7....Seriously.  So, if you are bringing friends and family with you, they will have a multitude of things to while you are busy with the convention.  Hit the pool, shopping, sightseeing and of course gamble (i dont gamble)...and after hours...if you wanna hit a club and do a little group air fist pump to music...you can do that...concerts, shows...hiking, biking, golf...if you wanna shoot over to Pahrump and go see a hooker....Yeah you can do that....
It can be as chill or as crazy as you like...a few of you know the later lol

The idea is to have a two or three day event....but Invite all of you to stay longer and bring your friends and fam to Vegas and enjoy it as a true tourist and not as an Esk8er....If this the only Vacation you can take...I wanna make sure that you get the best bang for your buck!  I want zero clouds, nice mild temps during the day and at night. (yeah its possible!) I want you to enjoy my adopted city to the max.

[/quote]

Something like that....and thanks for your suggestion but I think I wanna start something totally new rather try to modify and instroduce a new culture in something already established.

A few months ago I created @Esk8_Squad on Instagram. It was meant to promote Esk8 as a whole, DIY to full production boards by reposting Esk8 Instagram users uploads to the @esk8_squad page.  Essentially aggregate all the electric skateboard  posts under #esk8squad.

https://m.facebook.com/Esk8Squad/
https://www.instagram.com/esk8_squad/
https://mobile.twitter.com/esk8_squad

Also @KlethBane has already acquired www.esk8squad.com for us ... it's not created yet and not linked to our FB page as a temp 

So, I've been busy posting on @Esk8_Squad when I'm not on here.  (some of you are like üòÆ) 

So, another proposal I suppose.....

Be part of the Squad.... the #Esk8Squad 

You can still divide parts of the #Esk8Squad to each group like Esk8Squad Boostsd, Esk8Squad Evolve , Esk8Squad Carvon. Etc......

I was playing with some designs for shirts that we could all have

Also, over the duration we will need to fund the convention via various means .... this is only one part of the revenue stream

OK, that works as well.  Definitely need to make a new mark not fix something legacy.  esk8.org was just suggested url perhaps available for an 501(c)(3-6), squad is cooler.  Assumed you need an entity at some point if this progresses.

And yeah...it looks better when an entity is booking a convention and not a bunch of  Yahoos on electric skateboards 

It's part of the whole idea of bringing it all in under one umbrella

The convention is a wonderful idea, but doesnt have any legs when prospective sponsors or vendors look at our show...it's better to say it's an Esk8Squad convention rather than a bunch of dudes running around Vegas in Esk8

So for sure this will be an outside event.  It makes no sense to have and Esk8 Convention indoors.

The reasons:
We need a large area, like a parking lot.
How are we gonna skate?
Many people are driving
Most likey vendors will have stuff in cars or vans and prob have a tent.
Food trucks 
Demo areas
Event Areas
Staging areas
also I think its important to have a swap meet area

Right now the only place i can think of having it is at UNLV

Im not sure of any costs right now but will reach out to them shortly...And find out the requirements to reserve the location for the type of the event we are having.

I am thinking April or May 2018 ...We will have a good chance for awesome weather during the day and night....

Im def thinking this will be a two day event...

first day is a vendor, demo, meet up, race show-and-tell kinda day.....that will be held in a lot.... that will be a very long day.....and look to start at 9am and end around 5pm .... then move the event to a free evening event like first friday as mentioned...most likey i will request vendors to be mobile...so they can pop up shop on the street event.......There will be food at both locations....so you wont go hungry..The evening event is a chill evening will a group ride downtown....there will be tons of people....any vendors that show will be mobbed ...we will def need to advertise here in Vegas...Time to leverage some old relationships....

Day two: Will be at a diffrent location....Looking to hire a TACO guy to make tacos....So, its a BBQ....Im kinda set on this location....Its all the way east but 20-25mins from the strip but plenty of smooth road to rip....and access to a huge paved path....totally safe....I think this is the best place to attempt an off road race....since its not in the middle of no where...and miles of free parking

Day three is a free day or if you want....ESK8SQUAD TREASURE HUNT....I'll do mu best to make the grand prize super sweet...like a full esk8 kit or if lucky a full esk8

This is the best location I've found so far..on weekdays....
since theres about a mile of empty parking lots along the bike path on the north end. :sunglasses:

it would be easy to make the event look good on video. which helps build for future events....
Theres also a massive hill that would make a great race track...

Anyway Last summer with at the group ride ...man...that was too many people in our way...couldn't really open it up till past Santa Monica pier .... and the sand on the concrete made me ride more cautiously the. Normal 

But there's so much to see and do... it is a great place ...but I def think a regional spot to do So Cal meets 

I just took @KlethBane on a ride this morning to a spot.....It's miles and miles of open path ways and if you want street riding just ride the road to the area ... super light car traffic with super wide roads  .... go as fast as you want

If you want an offroad race at a dirt track you can come to Germany.

Kai, the admin of the German esk8 forum (http://www.elektro-skateboard.de/) organized the dirt track championship for the last tree years. If there is enough interest, for 2017 hopefully again.

This is the link for the event:

@Michaelinvegas what about indoor go kart racing venues? There are 4 to choose from.

The big benefit of indoor is weather won't impact the event. They should also have ample parking, staff, food and facilities. 

They will also have lap timing equipment and probably some public liability insurance too.

Also, as it is indoors it will make it much easier for exhibitors to setup their stalls securly for the weekend (assuming the venue has a resonable sized floor space to accommodate the usual 3x3m spot, you will need to check) Packing up and setting up twice would totally suck.

That is a great idea for a venue....

And will see if we can incorporate that....I'd like to have it as outdoors as possible since we ride mostly outside .....

So I know we"d need a lot of cones and sidewalk chalk hahahha 

There is actually an out door track that is a nice size...but I think I wanna create a standard track like one that @RunPlayBack made last year...that way the course can be easily replicated so people can set up to practice the course .... so when everyone meets up...people are 100% race ready....anyway that's a whole other discussion.....

I'm thinking of ways for us to be corralled but yet have tons of free riding space, vendor space, vendor demo space, race space, swap meet place ...etc....

You guys want something that will knock people's soxs off and you get to call it your own.....I'm working on it lol

[/quote]

Outdoors is fine, just **very risky** if bad weather strikes, also your select vendors/exhibitors have a much harder job operating outside, they need power & internet facilities, if the conditions are not ideal your vendors/ exhibitors are less likely to show up. 

my advice is to cater for exhibitors first as they are paying the big bucks & covering lots of the expenses.

Also the more vendors the more attractive it is for punters to show up.

So, please let's not let this idea die. We need to generate more interest as time goes by

I kinda imagine a track with chicanes but with longer straightaways to allow for top speed and enough room to slow down and make the next chicanes ...

I want to be able to showcase how exciting esk8 can be .... so def looking for a large area with plenty room .... im hoping for a short track, long track and one emtb course .... as well as demo area ... and a free ride area (just an area or loop to ride casually .... so it's a lot of space I'm looking to take up.... I want you guys to take full advantage of riding your esk8...

The indoor idea is a hedge against the weather ... I see @onloop's  point... I will say again...it hardly rains here...to the point where's it hard to remember the last time it did ... no joke .... the odds are in favor of awesome weather next year in April-May... it is that sunny here

But I will def try to have back up plans ... to insure this event can happen rain or shine ....

I have some experience with national motorcycle rallies (sport bikes) and setups that draw about 200-400 people.  For us it's all about riding and people, less about the gear and vendors, though we find ways to incorporate that.

In the motorcycle world the events are split.  We hold rallies to ride and hang out, and hold motorcycle shows for vendors, to see what's new, and to buy stuff.

I think you may need to figure out what you want to get out of the gathering before you can start planning.

How most of these types of rallies go:

**Planning**

* An event planner/manager (Michaelinvegas) - someone who comes up with a plan on a website, document, something that lays out location, dinner, raffle, date, activities, accommodations, safety, costs etc. This can be broken out into a few different people if necessary, but with an event this small (initially) that‚Äôs probably not necessary.

**Costs**

* Members pretty much pay for themselves.  Travel, hotels and food are paid directly by attendees with some deals worked out ahead of time by the planner. 

**Location**

* New place every year.  Try to move around the country to ride new roads, but also to give people who can't travel far the opportunity to come. 
* Usually a weeklong event, but I think 4 days total over a long weekend would make the long travel "worth it"

**Hotel**

* A single hotel/motel large enough to hold everyone.  Event planner works out some deal with room reservations and discounted prices.  This becomes the gathering point.  
* In the morning before the rides, and at night after the rides people can meet in the lobby/bar/etc and hang out.  

**Food/Dinner**

* At least one night some sort of group dinner is planned (and catered) in one of the lobby rooms.  Everyone pays (planned ahead of time) around $20 for food.  

**Raffle**

* After the dinner, a raffle is held. Everyone gets a ticket with the meal, and can buy more tickets if they want.  Proceeds go to the "group" for future rallies and prizes.  Prizes are usually donated by vendors or bought with group money.  Prizes are small (under $40 usually, and averaging around $5-10).  Shirts, kick stand pucks, spray cleaners, stickers, gloves, battery tenders, and misc trinkets are usually given at motorcycle rallies.  For the larger rallies, we have 5 or so "big" prizes.  Usually gift certificates to motorcycle vendors at $50-500 depending on what gets donated.

**Rides**

* Routes are given out by the event planner.  People don‚Äôt have to follow them, but many do who don‚Äôt know the area well.
* People split off into smaller groups of 4-8 with a group leader and head out for the day.
* The reason this is done is that everyone rides a different style/pace.  Large groups become difficult to keep together and waiting at stop signs mess up the ‚Äúflow‚Äù of the ride.  For esk8 this could be long and short range riders, and maybe an off-road rider group. 

**Events** Outside of the actual rides, have some group events ‚Äì quality over quantity here.

* 250/500 ft drag races ‚Äì have someone with a stop watch and record results.  Do it by class (or voltage, 6s, 8s, 10s, open).  Try to keep it simple.
* Slalom course with cones (timed)
* Vendor show-off
* Give the opportunity for vendors to show off their stuff (one vendor at a time)

Just some thoughts ‚Äì come up with your plan first then ask the community for changes ‚Äì you will have to drive this thing if you want it to happen!  You will also have to edit yourself - be realistic about the number of people attending and the complexity of the event.  

I'm sure I'll be there!

Working on this and more:

Right now I have been reaching out to different sponsors and vendors .... one a week 

As for Locations: 

I've been discussing that with people here...and will be out next week to check the condition of the properties for our use. Parking lot and indoor options. I have a few places that I will check: UNLV, Downtown area across from Atomic liquors, sunset park, wetlands park, silverton casino and the Las Vegas Convention area 
Only the park locations are not near hotels 

As for website ... nothing yet ...but a domain has been set up... also I have place a temp event on the Facebook page for esk8squad https://m.facebook.com/Esk8Squad/ 
Here's the invite for the event https://www.facebook.com/events/260834791028210??ti=ia also this is where I think I'll post most of the confirmed info 

Documents: Gathering it all... I'd love to be able to put expected vendors and companies on a poster type thing to show people as well as location and map of venue with all locations on the map 

Activities and dinners: 

I hope to have a slew of activities that you all can participate in or opt out of ... it will be totally esk8 centric...so be prepaired to be esk8ing a lot in the evening as well so back packs and extra batteries 

Accommodation: I'll prob set up a code with one or two hotels .... I'll give you a number and a code like Esk8Squad... you get a group discount ... this is prob the best way the first year till we have a real registration set up and I can go to a property and say we have X-amount of rooms ... it's still possible but would require some housing management 

Costs: that's on going. I don't think I wanna charge the public, but I do need to make something to cover all costs to hold the event .... I'll need to think of something like selling tshirts 

Safety: helmets a must when racing, or riding throug the event required.... it sure what else on that one

I've also reconsidered how the days will be played out.....

I figured this:

Friday arrival:

Meet up at first Friday in our esk8 area for opening ceremonies.  That would be around 7pm. Bring your esk8 if you want. I will see if the vendors will come out for a weekend long event and would open up the trunks for demo rides at the first Friday  venue.  This way we can invite those people to come check us out at our Meet up. It your opportunity to stretch your legs eat, drink...and talk esk8 with peers and noobs that will come and ask a million questions....

First Friday ends at 11

Saturday: vendors and sponsors and food trucks set up at location 
I imagine various logoed production board cars and tents 

9am start: opening ceremony of the day

First race at 10am various individual and squad events  

Through the day various events, demos and food 

We end it around 5 or 6 ....then it's free time....but will create a short evening esk8 event around 8 or 9 to end up at a bar or restaurant so you can bounce out after or keep it going....

Sunday: we do it one more time...finishing all the races ...more fun rides and demos ....and closing ceremony then final meet esk8 grand meetup for drinks someplace that evening 

How does that sound?
```

Also plan to have a build competition....

There will be a theme ....

There will be guidelines on what components to use...

Winning will be based on theme ... best interpretation 

How closely you stuck to the spec guidelines....

And performance 

The judges I hope can be the various vendors .....

Of course we will have the people choice award...

Any thoughts?

Lololo it was going around it was fun....

But I've thought abt it ...and I'm going to avoid a tug o war or hill climb race unless it's part of a course....

And the reason is....I don't want to be blamed for having an event that could break your stuff .... plus i want to avoid any break downs ... I'm gonna try to make so you guys can use ur esk8 to get around .... 

I'll leave hill climb as a demo for vendors .... maybe we get something that tilts to various to degrees and at your own risk

Baja Brings a good point, my intentions is to rent out some boards out for the day, it gives us also the opportunity to invite the general public who I don't think just bring there esk8 with them haha. Also provides those traveling a option to still experience the event without to much hassle.

I know man I know you can do it ...

Def looking to make this legit ...

Another reason to pic Vegas ....it's a vacation destination...
Sure there are lots of other places but it's tough find a place that has tons of parking, tons of parking lots, with attractions super nearby, with lots of options to ride and explore safely, and tons of hotels.

I could do LA...my issues are open areas and parking, near hotels which we hold the event and traffic...we couldn't be as concentrated and people couldnt dip in/out easy and come back ...

Vegas offers the opportunity to have another vacation outside the convention...so Vegas is multipurpose.....
If all goes next year...we start planning a new location the day after the convention and ends.

I'll also add other activities to share and let you know what other things you can do in and around Vegas

Also keep in mind I'm also try to keep things easy and simple...

I want you to be able to use your esk8 ....  plan is to have recharge station at the venue ...kinda like a coat check to charge...prob be a small fee to hold and charge your board...as well as battery rental options....

In my mind it's very feasible for non-vendors to just leave the car at the hotel...but most will drive.  So looking for places with plenty of parking and places to adventure near by...cause a parking lot is only so fun for so long....a night downtown is a piece of cake...because of all the places you can ride and places you can park....I don't want you guys saddled with having to pay for parking or even have issues with finding parking.

I'm doing my best to cover all the bases...and to make this trip a fun and affordable one.  Conventions can get expensive. So, little fees here and there eat away at your budget. Could be the difference between taco cart or bar food.

It is abt just enjoying the days...and checking out what other people ride...like I said pre-built or not, we all shred electric.

I'm not sure how young you are with your "youngest esk8 builder" moniker bit but I'm pretty sure BB became mainstream prior to DIYs. Besides performance, many people started DIY because of BB's high cost. So if anything, we have BB to thank for making us look for alternative esk8s. I'm not sure how we have contributed to them. Them finally adding more battery/range is not exactly copying us.

I wasn't talking about the battery changes. Ever since the start they based their boards on innovation that a few people on ES were doing. All they did was put it into a consumer available model and make it look pretty. I'm not bashing BB, but you can't say they did all the innovating

I was talking about popularity as well. BB was the advertiser that drew in more interest so they definitely helped the diy community in that sense....ok let's get back to the subject of convention

Thoughts on OneWheel @DaviDjembe?
[/quote]

Sadly, as cool as the one wheel is, I don't think one wheel should be considered in the same league as an electric skateboard.... it's more in the balance/segway category...

However, i do believe that this skateboard expo has the potential to be a huge event that will attract all kinds of products to it "eventually" - build it & they will come.

.... so maybe after the first year or two once you have a feel for the punters that show up, I would suggest possibly expanding your scope of eligible exhibitors to basically include suppliers of any electric vehicle that the rider stands on top of (probably not scooters though? - but never say never.)

Another alternative brand you might eventually contact is golf board. 

The goal for me initially would be to try to keep it exclusive to skateboards only & pray that it is viable & grows rapidly with this niche alone.... but if it stagnates don't hesitate to open the doors to more alternative product categories. For this to be successful it needs to be a profitable venture & the revenue comes from exhibitors & ticket sales 

People don't show up if there are not enough cool gadgets from heaps of cool exhibitors! & exhibitors don't show up if attendance is low. 

ALSO: I 100% agree that all the major skateboard companies get notified about this, helmet companies, shoe companies like VANS etc.... These big well-established skateboard companies need to start accepting that esk8 will eventually be a huge revenue stream for them...

I'm going to have to drive there. My boards aren't allowed on planes, and if i'm going to show up to something like this, I need to bring boards. Exotic boards. Of ridiculous power and configuration. Not to mention booth stuff like t-shirts and stickers and samples to put your hands on. 

Fairgrounds would be a good venue. Maker fair was awesome at the fair grounds here in Orlando. Wherever it is, it needs to have lots of pavement. Decent pavement, and plenty of parking. And room for food trucks. I need tacos and Swedish meatballs and corndogs and funnel cakes. 

And i'm not saying it really has anything to do at all with esk8s, but a Gravitron blasting Aerosmith and Poison wouldn't hurt either.

@Michaelinvegas I love this idea and I'm here to help if I can. Have you thought about having an indoor location as a part of the event so that we can have panels and\or presentations from vendors and builders? Imagine someone from Carvon, @onloop, @psychotiller, @torqueboards, or  @longhairedboy breaking down a build and sharing tips and details. vendors could reveal upcoming products, maybe we could have a few video screenings, like @RunPlayBack's "Session Error."  

I love that there will be a lot of outdoor time, but I think a chunk of time to convene inside might makes a lot of sense. 

Another thing to add to your list: you might need a medic tent throughout the event. There are bound to be some falls with this many folks riding in a single place. Some hotels can connect you w a vendor that will handle it. 

Also, a quick thought about legal; make sure the convention is set up through a business entity and not just yourself as sole proprietor, else any problems that arise will become your own personal liability :slight_smile:

Would it be worth inviting any board/truck/wheel makers...they'd be all for kicking
[/quote]
@Michaelinvegas Yes! Not only are their products (and their IR&D budgets) essential to our interests, they also have the money to help sponsor a major event. If you only look to esk8 companies I think you'd find that many are in startup mode and sponsorships aren't as likely.

[quote="treenutter, post:175, topic:18866"]
indoor location as a part of the event so that we can have panels and\or presentations from vendors and builders?
[/quote]

I'm really targeting an outside venue, with some sort of indoor option as back up.  I'm just worried about space.  I'm not saying we need a Speedway race track...but I know...we will need lots of running room so to speak. I we need an area for just general free riding, demo area and race track (one or two) ...plus vendors will need to get set up...and packed up quickly...and would be ideal for them to just drive to their designated location and set up shop...instead of loading and hauling...I've seen too many conventions and the amount of effort to lug shit from the truck to the location is a whole other pain in the ass.  

Drive up, pitch tent, banners, chairs and tables...and whatever other marketing material hey have ....and of course boards....it gives them a place to lock things up if needed....acts like a home base so they can bring coolers and stuff they need to be there all day and night....

We will need to have some sort of arena for talks etc...so we will need a PA system ..

Another thing to add to your list: you might need a medic tent throughout the event. There are bound to be some falls with this many folks riding in a single place. Some hotels can connect you w a vendor that will handle it.

If you can find a venue with a little of both, that would be ideal. The Orlando fairgrounds has outside areas, inside areas, and partially covered areas. It made Maker Faire a much better experience i think. It didn't have quite enough pavement though. But something like that would be great.

I love the idea of this convention! You are absolutely right in saying that that we need a united front.  I think that an event like this will be crucial to growing the popularity of Esk8s.

I've been starting to lay the groundwork for an event series for people to ride their Eskates around a temporary road course.  Safety is my number one concern.  The courses would be marked with thin plastic bars about the size of a ruler, so there is less risk of eating pavement if you go off course or hit a marker.  It is also going to be a time trial event to prevent any accidents and injuries that may result from wheel to wheel racing.  I've begun drafting the rule book, looked into timing systems, gotten lawyers on the liability waivers, etc.

You seem to have a few good options for the race portion of the convention, but if you are interested I would love to set up a road course there!

Yeah, the insurance wants the entire dynamic area fenced off and the track a safe distance away from the fencing.  I am planning on using snow fencing if they allow it as its cheap and lightweight.  If they are going to require metal crowd control barriers or actual fences the cost is going to sky rocket....

@Mikenopolis the possibility are huge.... @AdaptProducts is of course welcome 

As @onloop and Dave at inboard mentioned there are other companies that could participate in their own way....

So.....if any of you have a special relationship with anyone skateboard related and you think they would benefit from coming....reach out to them for me and report back here.

I don't have any marketing materials at the moment for you to share, only the idea for the moment.  Pretty much this thread is the document.

It will take a little time to get things down in a format that is presentable. But it will come.

Next week I'll be meeting with a buddy of mine and seeing if I can enlist his help.  He's currently on CBS radio locally and has had a local tv show. I've done events with him in the past, but he know nothing abt esk8...but he also has a lot of connections with businesses and stars .... we shall see

Lol yeah that's a given .. but I was only referring to people off the street type thing...we will have a big push to locals to get numbers and the social media exposure we want when it's here...and that will happen in any city it will be held at ....but I just don't want people just wandering up and taking a ride...basically I want it free to look, but cost to ride. It puts a little skin in the game for these folks.

For you guys ...yes there will be a cost and it will be a tiered cost .....but that because I'll have various convention type packages that include stuff...cool stuff that you can use before, during and after the convention...yeah there's gonna be a tshirt ... but I'm thinking out of the box...I want to definitely add value when you pay for something....and have cool stuff so it make you wonder what ideas I have...

So, if there is a cost, I will make sure you get something in return and not just access to the event.

As for racing, there will be some sort of fee per event. That will help offset the cost of equipment, trophies üèÜ and man power....and if we are lucky prizes.

As for contests, not sure....I'm hoping that a sponsor will come in and offer a complete board or equipment....that would be sweet.

@Michaelinvegas :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: holy crap I've missed a lot!  I'd love to lend a helping hand with anything!  You've got a lot of great ideas out and ready for execution.   Just my 2 cents, I agree with @jaykup and his perspective for a general outline/format for the conference (a lot can be added or subtracted).  For my day job I travel to different states as a vendor for government conferences.  As a vendor we pay between $200-$1000 just to set up.  It depends on type of sponsorship and the size of the show.  The attendees also pay some sort of fee for conference overhead. The show and lodging is usually in the same place for convenience and then there are normally planned afternoon "bonding" trips and dinner.  On the last day it's usually some sort of vendor recognition and paid dinner.  Anyhow, that's just a suggestion as I've seen this format work well from state to state.  Also, as things start to progress and I add more content to my YouTube channel, [Big Kids](http://bit.ly/BigKidsYouTube), I'd be honored to do some advertising/media focused on the conference on the channel.  If you like we can hash out ideas one night and I can add it to my schedule of videos I have planned for the year.  I'm all for the esk8 community (bias toward diy :wink:) getting together under one "roof".  This is gunna be so wicked!  I'm going to sleep now as I've just read 200+ entries in the thread, LOL :joy:

@nmagz3 thanks....

Yep last week had a meeting with a buddy of mine and discussed different formats. We also discussed the possibility of "locking down" East Fremont street for our use.  He's been involved with some of the concerts/events in DTLV that require street closures and has produced a few shows here in town and also is currently on CBS Sports radio.  I've known him for over a decade and have created events in the past together.  Also, he knows everyone in this town....every restaurant/bar and casino in downtown and Vegas area. So, Jonathan is almost essential. He's my one degree of separation from people that have a vote in yes or no. 

One of the things we discussed is format...Convention or Festival..... he says festival...and I tend to agree.  Especially if we plan to allow the public to attend. 

Definitely exposure is great. And we can discuss. Ill be leveraging all my old relationships with clearchannel, and other certain news people that I know when things are more solid. Jonathan has access to his radio audience and other media outlets.  .... So, yeah...we can figure it out...because I will be creating content for the Esk8squad YouTube channel to support Esk8Con going forward.

Far from it. There way too many pieces at the moment.  Let's put it this way. If we want to close down the area....50k let's us own it...plus permits and such....so, need to partner up with someone down there to help us piggy back on the permits they already have....That will save us money and the pain of working through all the permits for the event. So, been reaching back out to some peeps that have some pull....and also building on the relationships that I currently do have...me going to Cali is indirectly part of the whole process of reinforcing the convention idea to the folks here, others that I have invited and vendors such as Shredlights and Inboard.  The response has been great, with shredlights providing free lights for a giveaway and Inboard trying to make it out to come ride. 

Lol help... would love help....

Let's see....we have @DynamicLabs on the races
@barajabali is going to be the battery master 
My bros @lowGuido and @JohnnyMeduse are behind the awesome #Esk8Squad logos ... huge props to these guys
And a few others that have sent me DMs...so awesome üëèüèª 

It's a rag-tag bunch at the moment. SO....YES please help me. I'm not going to say no. Lol

Just an idea, but it would be cool if there were some place or person where people could ship their batteries to before the event, then pick them up when they arrive. Like a battery will call. At least for those of us in the U.S. I have no idea how much harder it would be to ship batteries from other countries though. Even better would be to leave them with that same person in the same box with a prepaid mailing label and said person could drop them off all at once to be shipped back after the event is over. Maybe charge a small handling fee for the service to make it worthwhile for you...uh...I mean whoever it is. :grin: That could take some of the pressure off of one person having to supply basically all of the batteries, and for those of us that have extra batteries, we could ship those too and share with our homies. To me, it seems like the battery logistics are going to be one of the most challenging parts of this venture. Super exciting though! Can't wait to see this event materialize.

I just had a thought. Given the DIY nature of the forum, would it make sense to invite OSHW "maker" companies to exhibit/sponsor the event?  Maybe even have them produce parts on-scene as demonstrations?  

Companies like:

[Openbuilds](http://openbuildspartstore.com/)
[SMW3D](https://www.smw3d.com/)
[Inventables](https://www.inventables.com/)
[Carbide 3D](http://carbide3d.com/)

[Prusa Research](http://www.prusa3d.com/)
[Printrbot](http://printrbot.com/)
[See Me CNC](https://www.seemecnc.com/)
[LulzBot](https://www.lulzbot.com/)

[OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/)
[SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/)
[Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/)
[Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/)

[Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/)

[UNLV Engineering](https://www.unlv.edu/engineering)  <- ME, EE, Tech Commercialization, CompSci students/faculty

[Make](http://makezine.com/) <- Maybe write an article for these folks around the event...
[Hackaday](http://hackaday.com/)  <- Maybe write an article for these folks around the event...

Also, maybe get [Syn Shop](https://synshop.org/) and [The Community Tool Chest](http://www.communitytoolchest.com/) to come out?  Are there any other hackerspaces/makerspaces in Vegas?  Since this is a community event it only makes sense to try and build these local connections - maybe even arrange an outing to one as part of the event.

Also, can we get some analytics from the owner of this site to show potential sponsors the level of interest in this sport at a state/national/international level?  I'm not even sure who to talk to.  It would be very helpful in making the ROI case to sponsors.  Maybe organize a survey or surveys around CNC/3D printing/electronics/CAD/CAM to gauge interest.  I have access to SurveyMonkey at work, maybe I'll write something up and get this started.

There are a lot of related companies...esk8 ain't their mainstay.... of course the offer will go out...but it is up to them to see the marketing value in coming.

I do foresee traditional skateboard/longboard companies making an appearance (eh hem... @ChrisChaput üòâ) we are also thier consumers. So, def want the wheel guys, truck, deck guys to come out...we need to start assimilation (I sound like the Borg.... Resistance is futile!) we need to be recognized as Skateboards and Longboards are recognized...hence growing esk8. And growth in esk8 means that your favorite skateboard/longboard company starts selling esk8 specific stuff...which is good for them. I'll give you an example: Shredlights before were targeting skateboarders.  In comes Esk8. Since my group buy...they evolved their product to fit Esk8. Look at their website. Changed. Now the have an electric skateboard pack. Definitely more esk8 friendly than before, which made no mention of electric Skateboards in the past. Shredlights sells more lights to Esk8er's than traditional skaters now. And look Eric putting the Shredlights weight in to the #esk8con....

So, there is a possibility that there are other companies that have the vision to make a presence.

That was kind of the point. She has acronyms to describe the patients who come in regularly for their doses. She has a great story about a guy who was complaining of leg pain after surgery.

But I don't want to side-track the thread with endless ER stories...

Sorry gents yeah life gets in the way...

A few things ive been dealing with since the summer and has kept me from going balls out....

My dad was diagnosed with cancer of the intestine and liver and has been going through chemo the past few months as well as my mom... So, had to split to Texas a few times and the holidays have been just busy since Thanksgiving....so hence my lack of involvement in the fourm the past few months....

Kids go back on Monday so...hope to back at it next week with some energy. Got to visit my folks this past Christmas/NYE and they are doing good which makes me feel better about things in general. 

Anyway, ill see what i can rally interms of rooms and events to make it a fun weekend for all. 

I guess ill keep you posted

I realize the nightmare of organizing a Convention can present so I for one as an exhibitor at such an event would be happy to attend an informal first run attempt where we all get together at different public venues to try different things.  I can bring a large selection of what we make for everyone to experiment with and to more fully understand what RipTide does in terms of our compounds and shapes and how that effects handling for whatever you would like your board to do.  It would be a tremendous learning experience for us also and afford us the luxury of R&D in preparation for a more formal 2019 Electric skateboard Convention.

Argh I really want to go - can't make Friday but maybe Saturday and part of Sunday. 8 hr drive each way assuming minimum traffic for me. That would put me in Vegas at 11:00 PM on Friday in best case scenario.

yo can we move this to mid march (I kid, aware that that's probably impossible)? I get two and a half weeks off from the 9th to the 25th... and I'm already in LA on the 10th so that'd be easier too.

Alternatively I can make any event in SF

Okay so I'm pretty sure _something_ will be happening. 

Will it be a huge convention with a whole array of companies represented? Doesn't sound like it since the time for planning is getting pretty short. I guess that might have to wait until next year or maybe later this year?

But there sure will be a bunch of eskaters doing group rides and talking tech.

What‚Äôs the status of this thing ? Really interested, also willing to help in planning if there‚Äôs any help needed. 

Cali seems like a safe choice if this even needs to be able to take off and become annual thing (if we want to prove to sponsors that it‚Äôs a good investment) . Sponsor wise maybe we could incooperate some companies outside but relevant to ESK8ing (Samsung , Regular Skateboard companies, Hardware shops, Lyft etc) 

Has anyone tried to contact Boosted? They surely have the most pull in the Common ESK8 community and having their name behind anything draws good attention.

**ANYBODY INTERESTED IN HAVING THIS IN BAY AREA CALIFORNIA?**
-I live in Pleasanton, CA, and with the likelihood of this happening in Vegas seeming to dwindle, I'd like to formally propose moving this event to my hometown, as it has a few very important things needed:

1) KEN MERCER SPORTS PARK
-this park is closed to cars on Sundays, leaving a **1.5 mile long, straight, flat, and recently paved road** open to skaters. This is where I do speed tests for my boards, and I think it would be a great place for a sprint race. I can upload some pictures of that later. There is also a 2.5 mile track that surrounds the park which is relatively peaceful to ride on.
![DJI_0003-S|400x300](upload://kj46TCNlu3IHQiO7V4EKLMwnCOC.jpg)![DL52SxJVAAAdiL_|690x459](upload://doIS1D8WA2hqZ1SQEk68xR1ryGQ.jpg)

2) LOADS OF PARKING LOTS
Right around the corner from my house are several office buildings, many of which are closed for either renovation or because companies move out. Especially on a weekend, where nobody is at these buildings either way, these lots become **a **g**old mine for flat loop tracks.**
![commercial1|407x309](upload://8j2PyzK03W5elzRaw03Hu5pR1yY.jpg)![pavement-maintenance-corporate-office-parks|690x458](upload://yEF90esyLsWqhxnEriqaks9Jo0Q.jpg)

3) HILLS
-Most of Pleasanton is rather flat, however there is a ridge about 3 miles from the park called The Preserve that has huge inclines (I haven't measured exactly, but I remember watching some poor soul try to take a meepo up the hill, it did even worse than my single drive. They're pretty damn steep). Great for hill climbing competition, a little less extreme than some of the San Fran roads that @evoheyax deals with, but well paved.

![trail-us-california-the-preserve-trail-at-map-17934608-1504473976-300x250-1|300x250](upload://hMArMxGUB4FvwwrNyiOx8jFQvGH.png)![02 AM|690x447](upload://vWvHyvCRp4xADJ5cHts9D6tMAuM.png)![34 AM|690x399](upload://bfqfxk9u1qKGmUUrGmeel1ObN3M.png)![07 AM|690x360](upload://m4ZyFXXPty3qc8sBXBmHm3cSqje.png)

4) IRON HORSE TRAIL
-Pleasanton is right along the arroyo, which means that there are plenty of curvy offload trails, as well as a 30+ mile adjacent track called the Iron Horse Trail that starts right near my house. This would be great for a range test competition.

I fully support this idea. BART goes out to Pleasanton, right? It's fairly centrally located in the bay area as a whole, and has a lot of open space. I don't think having the event in San Francisco itself would be a good idea due to the congestion and parking issues. Nowhere to park and nowhere open to safely ride are my main concerns there. I would envision people flying in to San Francisco or Oakland airport, hopping on BART (subway) and taking it directly into Pleasanton. Plus, there should be a lot more and affordable lodging than you would find in San Francisco. Let's do it!!

I am not in favor of hijacking this thread but i am in favor of having an event this spring.  No matter where it is, RipTide and I will have to travel so all is good.  Las Vegas has a lot of strong points as well as locations in Cali.  The access that Pleasanton seems to offer  is a very strong point.  San Francisco, especially GG park: 

THE BEST TIME TO BIKE AT GOLDEN GATE PARK
While the park is enjoyable at any time of the year and day, one of the most safest and least disruptive times to bike through Golden Gate is on Sundays. This is when the major entrance to the park during the week, which is situated at JFK Drive, is shut down to cars and completely open to pedestrians and bikers. Holidays also see the closing of this main Golden Gate Park auto pathway. During this time, the area swells with an abundance of bikers, walkers, joggers, runners, and roller-bladers. An assortment of major sights about the park is also easily accessible by bike at this time.

On Sundays, the park officially closes John F. Kennedy Drive from Stanyan Street, which leads to the Panhandle, extending all the way to the 20th Avenue area.

I live down the street from GG park in san francisco and parking around my house isn't bad and can almost always get a spot on my street.   I don't have any housemates anymote except for my girlfriend and we now have a couple of rooms that are pretty empty.  If we did meet in GG park I'm happy to host as many people as want to cram in. SF and gg park have a lot to offer visitors.   It would be jammed but could fit like 20 people w pads n sleeping bags. Not luxury but convenient n free.  The free section on craigslist rocks n I could stock up on couches or mattresses.

TBD on if/when I‚Äôm hosting it. Step one is getting @Michaelinvegas‚Äôs blessing, and after that I‚Äôll have to get permission from the city so that curious cops know that we aren‚Äôt causing trouble. I‚Äôm thinking Spring break or later, to make it easier on everyone. It would be a 3 day thing, starting in the afternoon on a Friday and ending on Sunday.

Yes, he has not logged into the forum for over two weeks.  He will be back when its right for him, he has our best wishes always.  If people need to make plans, make them and assume he will try and feather into them as he can, when and if he can.

I am closing this topic, since the meeting place and idea has changed a little bit - a new one with relevant information will be started shortly, and the topics will be merged later if it becomes advantageous for the understanding of members that might potentially go to the convention.

@Michaelinvegas is still making plans for this last I talked to him. Working on getting convention room rates and I believe has a venue spot in the works.  I can say it's been a rough winter but will regroup, organize and get the ball rolling.

Lets get some proposed dates for the mid - end of summer? Ive waited over a year for this event so I'm determined to make it happen. 

We need enough time to accumulate vendors, and allow time for people to purchase tickets ahead of time

A while back I proposed to move this to my hometown, given that we have all needed amenities and plenty of space, as well as a perfect convention center. Got word from Mike that he is still working on it and not to move on just yet. I‚Äôd ask that we respect his wishes until we hear otherwise.

Please tell me you're joking. Casey would probably not go to this, he'd probably view it as beneath him. And we don't really want him there either. The only thing he's done that's good for the community is raise awareness about e-sk8, but the fact that he bashes on any board that's not a boosted board, and refuses to wear a helmet when he rides, ends up hurting the community more than he helps it
