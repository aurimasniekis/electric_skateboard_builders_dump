Has anyone tried E skating 17 mile drive at Pebble beach? It's near Carmel and Monterrey.

I'm pretty sure my Ollin Flux could make it the full 35 miles R/T without charging.

I bicycled it years ago and its low traffic and stunning scenery. Often very windy also.

Curious how smooth the pavement is or if Clint Eastwood or somebody has banned it.

edit: just heard from someone who drove it recently in a car and was sketchy with traffic, narrow lanes and off camber turns and people driving too fast. Oh well.
