It's freezing cold in Germany, but I honestly hope for the weather forecast to be true (around 8°C) on February 17th so we we will be able to test drive [The Hyperboard](http://www.faradaymotion.com/hyperboard/) in cool area -[ Fab Lab Berlin](https://fablab.berlin/en/) on Prenzlauer Allee.

See you on Friday the 17ths. I'll bring my pocket rocket. Hopefully the snow is gone till then.
Das Parkhaus am Gleisdreieck ist aber immer gut für eine Fahrt - und immer leer.
