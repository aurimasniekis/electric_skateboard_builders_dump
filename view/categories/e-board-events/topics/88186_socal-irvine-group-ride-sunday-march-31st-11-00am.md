FYI. Chris Noble posted a ride in Irvine. This is right next to the Quail Hills trail which I love. Should be an awesome ride

Simon, You lost your shoe right? This is the place ðŸ˜‚. I almost ate it the other morning attempting to ride the dirt trail. The rain washed away a lot of spots

Hey, do you know how long it is, I would like to come but the only board I have is the Landwheel and as You might know, the range is really limited

Not sure what route Chris plans to do. But generally group rides do 7-10 miles and then stop to charge and have lunch.

@KaramQ  looks like a 10 Mile ride then charge you might need to get an Uber unless you got two chargers for the LW...or three batteries

Yikes, Iâ€™m going out of my way to go all the way to Irvine, i probably wonâ€™t come then. Wish I could but the Landwheel can hardly get 5 miles for each battery

Yeah a lot of boards are not meant for our group rides. Out of all my boards, only one is for these
