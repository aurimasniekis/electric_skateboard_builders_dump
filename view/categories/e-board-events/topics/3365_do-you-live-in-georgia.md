Looking for other E-boards in Georgia. So far just a buddy of mine with a boosted board and I ride. We both live in Forsyth county up north. @cj1556 lives in south Georgia. Who else is in Georgia??

Hey @FLATLINEcustoms can you re-categorize this under eboard events to keep it tidy ‚úäüèªüòÑü§òüèª

I wish I lived in Georgia...so much green trees ... I miss riding with a lot of trees around in the hot weather ... Sometimes you get that cool spot in the road...totally refreshing

Never thought about that @Michaelinvegas, seems like crickets would be all around here as well. I have so many people asking me what I am on. I just thought everyone watched YouTube or read articles on the internet...

Dude we might as well be riding ufos ... It don't matter if you are in country or a big city ... You always get people looking at you like you have your fly down....We all here assume that the average Joe knows abt electric skateboards...they don't ... But they all seem to remember seeing a gas powered one lol... Ain't that odd

I remember seeing gas motor mountain boards when i was a kid but didn't stumble across Eboards until looking at power wheelz for my 5 year old in walmart and ran across the $200 altered board. then 20 min on the net and realized how big all of this has started to get. KRAZY

Yes but plans have changed. I first got in on the 149kv sk3 sale and was planning a 12S build. However, I'm now waiting on the G160 I just ordered to show up and will be using it instead and doing a 10S build. Deck, trucks, wheels, pulleys are on my work bench. DIY 12S esc, and G160 motor should be in the mail. won't be long and I'll be posting my 1st build thread!

There is one right near my house that is a nice paved path along the river. They are finishing up building a bridge  across with a paved ramp up to the bridge. So I'll be able to ride that path easier instead of having to drive around to access it. But besides that my campus at Western Carolina University and the surrounding area.
