Spoke with one of the event promoters for Backside Brawl and we are go for a race on Saturday.

 The event date is tentative at the moment but should be concrete very soon. We will be making updates here and on the new facebook page as things unfold! :call_me_hand::checkered_flag: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/315497705771336/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/315497705771336/)

Up for grabs. SRB race drive. Will only be sold to someone who will put it on the hill. You don't have to be fast, you don't have to be talented. Only requirement is you build it and either have someone or yourself  race it with us at the Backside Brawl.

I don't think my new board will be ready by the 19th but I'll do my best. 

This time I'm leaving behind 10s and going to 12s because no matter how hard I push everytime I race you, I lose to your top end.

Copy that. Roster adjusted.
We're going to run the race with a new format that allows 15mph boards to compete with 40mph boards. Race will have a consistent rider competing for podium at the finish line. 
Hope to see all boards at the hill racing.

Still on the camping fence. Should be a great event.  I may have a board that needs a rider. Hope @chaka is bringing his boardstack. Get some of the DH crowd running the hill.

My boards sold faster than I was expecting and am currently working on a new one. I don't think I can pull it off by the 19th (maybe). I might have to back out of the race we'll see.

Yeah, I will have a few extra decks to ride. Super sketchy racing an unfamiliar board but I think there is a good place to ride on the other side of the hill. Plan on doing a small group ride sometime during the weekend!

Any board I ride that doesn't have straps or some sort of bindings is scetchy as fuck. I'm not a real skater, lol. I wouldn't be very competitive durring the races without them but I'll show up incase there aren't enough people racing.

It was a blast. This hill will definitely put your board and body to the test. During the race, I hit some sand going around a turn and slid out. I could not make up the time. It was a blast seeing and racing with everyone. I like the way the time trials turned out. I think it would be a good idea if we all got 3 or 4 practice runs before time trials next time to get comfortable with the course. I can bring a generator and set up a charging booth at the bottom of the hill if needed. Let me know. Can’t wait to do it again. You guys are awesome. See you at the next one.
