There is a night time group ride happening on this Saturday May 5th in central London which i am helping out with on the night (i.e. I will actually make it to this one unlike the last few which I had to miss due to Street Wing obligations)

It would be great to see any of the members here who can come along and represent the DIY community.

route is along the embankment so a great chance to see London landmarks at night.

we are meeting at 8pm on sat 5th may @ St Pauls Cathedral - churchyard, EC4M 8AD London, United Kingdom

Excuse me while I pop out the  back and shoot myself :joy:

Looks like it's a closed event for the FB group members only, I dont have admin rights so I can't make it public. I will remove that link to the FB group as it's just confusing
