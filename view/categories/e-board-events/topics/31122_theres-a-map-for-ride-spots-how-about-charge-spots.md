This is not to encourage loitering, Im just in a foreign country and dont speak enough of the language to make sure they are comfortable with me using their outlets, I think it would help to add places in your local area that are cool with you charging while you eat/drink or do the thing you go there to do. How does everybody feel about this?

edit: this is for spots that arent libraries, what are your cool cafes and bars that dont mind you charging up while youre there?

I agree, this would be good to know if there are available outlets on my ride route...

Im hoping this gets enough visibility to end up as a layer on map with ride spots. Itd make it way less stressful traveling with a board if I knew I wasnt gonna have to go home between charges

It would probably end up being a map marked with all the Starbucks...

Are you all plugging in a huge aluminum charger with fans blowing, 800w? Or laptop style charger and sit patiently for 1 hour?

We should add to the map its funny i know here in ireland u just might get away with knocking at a house and asking them to charge it they might even give u a cup of tea<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/3/d3f04ffa7ecf6825433f08084d05295a134df915.jpg" width="137" height="97">
