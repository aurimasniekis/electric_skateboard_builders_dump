Hi! Would anyone be interested in participating in a track day on either a go-kart or autocross style course in the Southern California region?  It would be nice to be able to push the limits of our boards in a controlled and relatively safe environment, rather than on public streets and trails.  

There would be a registration fee to cover the costs of site rental and insurance.  It would depend on the number of people interested, but expect to pay over $50.

It would be a time trial style event, with enough time between the release of riders to make sure people can safely stop if someone falls on track.

Participants would be split up into run groups and will have to work the course at least one time during the day (to help with start/finish, timing and scoring, corner workers, etc)

There are a lot of other rules and details to flush out in the name of safety and organization, but I wanted to see if there was any interest before getting too into it.

I would love to, only problem is logistics of getting my board down to cali.  Wanted to do this for a long time but renting out a good go kart track is bloody expensive.  CAll ahead and make sure their insurance will cover esk8s (there's no way they even know what they are lol) when I called local tracks they seemed pretty wary of it.  Let us know if it happens!!!

Awesome idea!  I'm in Vegas and with the family I'm not sure if/when I'd be able to get out there.  Where are you or the track located?  Keep me update on your progress :slight_smile:

I'm in Orange County, but the place I was thinking of is the Auto Club Speedway in Fontana.  I've set up a few autocrosses there in the past, so I'm familiar with the layout and what would be required.  There is also CalSpeed Karting at the same location which could be another possibility.  The old El Toro air field in Irvine could also work, but the last time I was there I remember loose rocks coming up from the runway which may be a safety issue.

Oh man, this sounds awesome!  So these places are okay with eSk8ers?  What did it take to set something up like this.  Just seeing if it'd also be doable in Vegas.

I have no idea if they are okay with eSk8ers.... :sweat_smile: The autocrosses I've set up were for cars.  If we had the proper event insurance and paid the site rental fees I doubt they would care.  And if we put on a safe event, and left the place cleaner than when we came, it would set a good precedent for hosting that kind of event again in the future.

I was hoping to shoot for early May, but it really all depends on the level of interest... We would need enough people to go, not only to spread out the cost for the event, but also to work all the positions necessary to make the event run.  Over 50 could work, but closer to 100 would be better.  We would also need some people to step up and assume some leadership roles like safety steward, registration, tech inspection, etc.

Yeah, the Porsche track is beautiful.  I'm open to anywhere really as long as the rates are reasonable, although I do think a tighter course would be better suited for an eskate.

I'm going to post this up on my face book page, and the electric skateboard page. 

You should draft the sign up sheet. Hopefully your crowd will gather. I know 10 people that will be there.

i'm not sure a car track would work at 20-30 mph...

But I have been dreaming of a road version of this track!

The labor and money involved to build something like that would be too ridiculous without a sponsor like redbull to fund it...

It would be about a size of a go-kart track, with one or two straights where you could top out.  The rest of the course would be tight and technical and really force you to work on throttle and board control.  A course made of cones or lane markers would be best; that way if someone wasn't going to make a turn they wouldn't have to bail, they could just run off course, slow down, and re-enter.  It will be an event where the risk of injury is minimized so people can really focus in on honing their skills.

Think autocross or motogymkhana.

There is totally a velodrome right down the hill from me (Marymoor park) - I'm planning to max out the freeride on it soon as it comes in :-D  No idea if this will be cool or just make you dizzy going in circles.

Surprisingly, I would think there would be more interest in a track day with a structured course with timing . Let's face it, the ultimate test of your build and ability it to test it in a controlled environment against others with the same goals and mind set. We need to do this and beta test a race day. I am in for any help I can offer up. Maby a Saturday night think tank of like minded individuals is in order... SoCal

I thought there would be a lot more interest in this as well.  It's still happening and I'm shooting for late August / early September.  I hope it turns into a "If you build it, they will come." kind of situation.  I'm hoping this will turn into a international series with world rankings for riders and constructors.

Here is the location I'm working on securing and the proposed event layout.

@MoeStooge 
 I would love your help.  I know you have a lot of experience in racing, especially with Midget cars.  I could use someone who knows how critically important safety is at the track to be the Safety Steward for the day.

I could also use some input on the rule book for the series, and the Tech Inspection checklist.  Here is a link to the files if anyone wants to go over it.

Also, here is the website, but nothing is really on it yet...

Would like to see your plan come to fruition. Got to build numbers and interest first. My opinion would be to keep the rule book as thin as possible for as long as possible. I think this bolsters numbers and more importantly innovation. Safety should be Paramount. Hate to say it, it's a lawyers world  and it's more about the promoter or club covering their ass then safety.

Awesome! :smile: 
At the moment I'm trying to get insurance coverage, but it's been a struggle to even get a provider to consider it.  The event will be a no go if I can't get the insurance so things are kind of on hold until that happens.  I'm still shooting for a late August date, but it may be pushed back depending on when things start falling into place.

Yea its actually a double spiral one up and one down.

My single belt could only do 2 floors since it's a hard left with some banked sections. 

And rest of the huge lot had an easy/long way up and down too.

Thanks for the lead, I'll contact this company today.  The insurance requirement is per venue.  All of the large open lots in Southern California require insurance policies with very high liability limits.  Insurance companies are willing to quote the event at a lower liability limit, but not at what the venues are asking for.  The go-kart track they are using may have a much lower insurance requirement, or none at all.

I contacted the company you posted.  They can cover the event, but at a very high cost; more than the rental of the venue itself.  I may have to eat the loss to get the series off the ground... I have two other brokers trying to search for competitive rates. Hopefully they can come up with something better.

Thanks!!  I'll gladly take donations, but you could still run the course at your own pace if you wanted.  It'll be a time trial event with the riders spaced out, so you'll have little risk of contact with another rider.  Since it will be on a closed and groomed course you'll probably have a lot more fun cruising without having to worry about cars, pedestrians, debris, etc.
