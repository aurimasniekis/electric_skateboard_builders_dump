The first meeting will be this Friday!  I am really excited and I hope to bring a bunch of new engineering students and other smart and helpful members to the forum.  Plus I will make a bunch of new friends that I can skate with!

My dream is that I will have enough people that any time I want to skate I can find someone else who wants to skate with me!  The problem now is all the Boosted Board riders around here can't keep up! :laughing:
