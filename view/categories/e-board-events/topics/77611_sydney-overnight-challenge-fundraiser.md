Hey everyone. 

So my friends and I from the Sydney Electric Skateboard group (Australia) will be riding 120km this Saturday night from Emu Plains to Cronulla. We will be riding in intervals of ~20-25km and will be charging for approximately 90min at each charge point. 

Thought we might try to do it for a good cause and raise some money for the not so fortunate this Christmas. If you could donate to the link below that would be greatly appreciated, every dollar counts. 

All proceeds go to the Youth off the Streets organisation, helping struggling teens and families out of difficult times.
