I'm traveling to Sydney from 8/20-8/27 if anyone wants to meetup (and perhaps loan me a board :stuck_out_tongue: ).

@Jinra
There's a bunch of us in sydney, check out the Sydney Electric Skateboards facebook group (we also have a whatsapp).
We usually have a group ride on the weekend plus some people ride together in the day/night during the week as well.

I don't have much time during the week, but I do get off at 5pm on weekdays, and I have Saturday all to myself. If anyone wants to play tour guide and has an extra skate, it'd be much appreciated!
