Check out Evolve World Cup, if they can do it then we, as a way bigger community, could organize an amazing e-Board world cup.

Meeting people around the world with all kind of crazy builds, make all kind of activities in 2 days time, would be an extremely satisfying life experience.

So, who's in?

I was thinking about this idea just the otherday.....

**I really think it has to happen!**

Majority of Enertion customers are in usa. This probably means most esk8 riders are in USA?

In terms if international access maybe Australia is an option also.

This biggest issues is battery transport....

SWITZERLAND mate. no Law concerning batterys since we are europe but not EU, you don't need certifications here :)

Edit: And yess, group rides are fun to relax and have a good time, but some serious riding in a group/competition setting sounds exactly what I am missing :)

Here are the premises:

1. In order to cover organization expenses such as:

- Meeting/convention facilities renting
- Development of a battery renting program like Evolve
- Velodrome/e-Board circuit for competition 
- First aid program (in case of emergency) 
- Media coverage

Registration would have a cost

Proposal: USD 150.00

2. Country must have

- An average consumer price index
- Easy international access
- High concentration of e-Boarders 
- Several skateboarding routes with good pavement
- Several off road routes
- Light/easy law enforcement for e-sk8s
- Good lightning for evening riding

Proposed cities:

- NYC (great e-Board population, laws prohibit the use of e-boards in cycle paths, bad weather, expensive hotels) 
- California (great e-Board population, strong laws against e-boards) 
- San Francisco (great e-Board population, nice roads for long rides)
- Miami (nice weather, good roads, cheap hotels, small e-Board concentration) 
- Berlín (strong laws against e-boards, nice e-Board users concentration, nice roads, expensive city for foreigners, easy meeting point for all Europe)
- Las Vegas (Great facilities for conventions, cheap hotels depending of time of the year, great riding routes, small e-Boarders concentration) 
Sponsorship from main vendors could also be included in order to cover organization expenses. 

I'm down to be part of the organization and considering the average age of e-Boarders is 40 I'm possitive this dream would come true pretty soon.

I didn't know about that, thanks for that @ElskerShadow, but I guess it's still more expensive  than any USA city because of your exchange rate, if I'm still wrong Berlin would be a great city. 

Paris is definitely more expensive but a beautiful city to ride in.

The USA definitely has everyone beat in terms of riders per country. We (USA) also have many vendors that can provide battery rentals (Enertion, DIY, MEB, Polar, and Bara Jabali). 

I remember having a thread for a USA meetup and California was winning, but I think New York is also something to consider.

Actualy the exchange rate is not so bad those days. So it should be okay. Paris might be expensive but it's an amazing city to ride.... not any laws against esk8t ( the only time Cops arrested me was for asking me where to buy an esk8t so you see how much we are resteicted ) and we have a few miles along the seine with amazing pavement to ride.

Don't let this die. Let's talk about dates. I'm thinking June?

Also, I could do something about the battery pack rental program. As long as it. Doesn't cost me money then I'll host that service. It would be on a reservation ahead of time and a prepay.

I'd suggest to all participants to build a travel safe battery pack as mine for this special occasion, here is the design you could all build prior traveling to the meeting:

https://youtu.be/bbdLbZDogqg

This specific pack is a 10S4P with 370W/hr, if you unplug all XT60s you will have 92.5W/hr on each individual pack, perfect for flying.

@barajabali if you could build these packs with no/minimal earnings you could help people to travel with no batteries, buy them upon arrival and take them back home. We could work something out if there are enough participants to cover a big 18650 cell purchase. 

Another idea would be to ship the batteries to the organization staff a week prior traveling, staff would ship the batteries back after the meeting. This would only work affordably for people living in USA if the meeting is there.

I agree to set up a date, on May NYC has a great weather, on June there is the Evolve World Cup, we need to make it before them or people who Evolve boards won't come.

The comunity should choose a date once a year for "WEBMUD"  World Electric Board Meet Up Day or something like that name, this would help sort of promoting comps, meet ups, and saftey all over the globe, having a once a year date helps organize others into creating these events around that date and as such allows for more events to pop up organically and gain momentum into something bigger hopefully such as sponsored world comps. JMO.

Berlin would have the advantage of Tempelhof, the former airport right in the center. Now a park, you have two runways, each 2Km long and a circular taxiway, 6.5km long. All smooth and nice. Google map it!
We also have the skate nights, a legal way to e-skate 30Km through town, escorted by police blocking the roads just in time.

Also think of this: If you want to change laws you got to show up and demonstrate, do media coverage etc.  So Its probably best to do the event in NY or Berlin. Two towns with strong links and internationally known. Ny is very expensive BTW. California is nice but you guys already have a law allowing e-boarding. Nothing to gain...
Berlin has the media and the government.
Germany has a program to fund e-mobility and a car industry of scale, looking for innovative stuff for marketing their future e-strategy. Tempelhof is btw the location of the e-mobility summits in Germany. The formula-e does a stopover in Berlin etc.

I would suggest to think in this way: Where would such a event have the biggest impact.

It is a freestyle Festivel, with park skating, streetskating, bowl and pipe. And they seemed intrigued by the idea to have the first open race/competition for E-boarding. But talks are slow with them. Could be an alternativ mayby for poeple around switzerland...

Vegas, it's cheaply accessible, and finally enough space for a large scale event, I'm sure people like me would be driving to setup a booth or so, so perhaps we could even schedule carpools as well, as for battery rentals, repairs, I'd be remodeling a trailer similar to a mobile workshop for those who could use the extra hand!

I knew you'd be the guy to start this off right. 

If we got 100 people to show up how much do you think this even would cost? I'm thinking we should get a small convention center for booths maybe. A couple places to ride. Maybe even just get a hotel convention center and get a deal with the rooms. 

What do you guys think?

Obviously it will be better if I'm able to book the rooms and meeting place in one spot. We'd get a better price....

Summer is the best time to book because it's not convention season .... but it's hot ....

Does anyone have an idea what month?

And you can think outside the box a little .... we could make a meet at a park and tail gate it to save money and still have tents ....like a festival .... and I could see if I can get food trucks to show up....
It all depends 

If we coincide it with first Friday in downtown Las Vegas we could ride around down there and troll the locals lol and they already have the food trucks and places to park and ride

If we build it around a free event ...we would draw in more people to esk8 and def draw interest....and of course be cheaper all around....and only rooms would be an issue .... 

If it happens I do know a few news people in town and maybe we could get some coverage

And this is First Friday

It happens in the Las Vegas Art district every 1st Friday of every month

Basically you can ride on any street from the Stratosphere hotel all through downtown Las Vegas/Fremont street 

The traffic dies at 7pm and it's open season on all the streets from the stratosphere to Fremont

@Michaelinvegas

A tent style festival would be so sick! It would be cheaper and we could allow for a lot more people to come while enjoying being outside and still have booths. 

You should just do exactly what YOU think would work and organize it. I will help you. Don't take polls i think lol just go for it

Sorry to weigh in so late on this, just back from travels. I agree it should be where there can be critical mass in esk8 numbers attending, and local support in organizing.  For me, that would lean toward NYC, SoCal, or Vegas.  Lots of other places make sense, I just spent over a week in Barcelona and it is world class as far as a city to esk8, but aside from amazing place to esk8 I know we wouldn't get the number of attendees it deserves. Happy to help if it ends up NYC, but as others have noted there are some challenges to making it work seamlessly here. If @Michaelinvegas is willing to tentpole Vegas for us, I would support that. Same if someone in SoCal, from SF to SD, wants to take the lead in organizing there. Either way, I am In for attending regardless of where!!

June or July would be good as well, we just need to make it hapen and not let it die in oblivion, so that's the reason I chose a date in 2 months.

BTW the first meeting doesn't need to be a huge one, we could get together with the people we could gather and, as we learn on the way, prepare next year massive gathering worldwide.

I kinda finally read the whole thread finally....lol

Ok. Here's my two cents since I have a minute to chime in

I think to truly have an international event ... we will need to def have to have more lead time...having one in 2017 would be nice but would almost be rushed and wouldn't meet the criteria for a convention....and I don't think you guys want to make it a glorified group ride......what I sense from the group is a full fledged esk8-centric convention with the major players in production boards(boosted, Metroboard etc) and the dudes that support diy esk8 (@torqueboards, @psychotiller etc...)  , skateboard vendors (Deck companies, wheels,helmets, etc), battery companies .... I dunno what else oh people like @longhairedboy and @barajabali that are building custom builds....man do you think anyone would show up?   

Yes Vegas is not ideal for the Summer...you'd all burst into flames 🔥It would be more suited if it was April-June or sept - oct ... it's either too hot or way too cold.

If vegas ain't the place I'd have to vote for some place in Cali ... of course I'd love NY and would love to do a gorilla raid run through the streets of Manhattan .... plus the chances for better weather are on Cali's side .... NY can get pretty iffy depending on the time of year - rain sucks 

Anyway...I have a few other pennies to throw in and ideas for all of you to consider

But must tend to the kid for the moment

Some good ideas and observations here, I would agree that the May date seems too soon to be realistic (at least for me lol).  So looking more like June or skip over summer and have Sept/Oct Fall in Vegas or Socal or NYC.

On @Michaelinvegas point, I do think we are shooting for convention-style event but worried if we put it in a 2018 mindset it will get lost.  Rather do an OK round 1 late 2017, fix it and blow it out round 2 in 2018.

I mean ther are two options really:

First: Its a community organized event, base on mutual trust and effort to organise all of it (venue, batterys etc.) Potential to be an awesome big family gathering of sorts, but with the chance to fall trough or become semi sucesfull.

Second: Keep the Idea, get a team together from all over to work on it of and on for a year, get Enertion, Evolve, Acton, Ollin, etc. involved, get a venue where they can open a stand with boards to test/sell and even rent. I think since our hobby or I would like to call it a sport soon is so small, we need to get the strongest players involved.

agreed, I have done some work in event managing and planing and those things are more expensive and take longer than you might think. I want this sport to suceed, I want it to become more than a hobby and a nice forum. ANd for that reason I am in talks with 2 huge sport events who might host us in switzerland, germany and I also think an organised event with all the major players is the way to go. Not just for exposure, not just for publicity reasons but everyone involved would have the best experience. The companys wuold have huge marketings profits from it, poeple would have an awesome event. If we were to follow such a plan, a group must form with ca. 5 poeple. Kepping it small so it actually works.

everyone gets asigned tasks and a timetable to fulfill those, one talks with the companys, 1 organising the venue, 1 organising hotel and food for a group , 1 clearing up all the legal stuff, permits (getting a closed of range for a race), 1 being in charge of organising the allrounds, like medical emergency team (stuff can allway happen) public relations, coordinating mediacoverag like interviews etc. And last but not least 1 who oversights the whole thing.

I myself would be intrested in taking up such a project with motivated poeple but with the disclaimer that I would stand for it to be held somehwere in central europe. I know this might be strange weird, but I am a student and can offer my time and knowledge in this regard but a week or so abroad in the usa is a financial plunge i cannot take.

I think 2017 should be worked on a local level and we look towards the future for a truly international meet.

Local or regional meet ups are definitely easier to set up for 2017.

I feel the groups don't need to large and can happen in any city.  But for 2017, why don't we all plan to meet up and ride a specific day? No, we aren't all together physically, but definitely in spirit! 

Like go skateboarding day .... June 21 .... just random groups skate on that day.... Maybe we should have our own day? Shred Electric Day!

Just an idea to keep 2017 alive.

Michael, I also think we could work it on local level, but at the same time set up a host location, so people from anywhere could come to join the biggest group. My vote is to set it up in 3 months in Socal, nice weather and good e-boarders community, I think the majority could afford this city, weather forecast is nice between May and June, being May cooler than June.

My idea would be to just wait for people to come join us, I bet we could get a medium/large group even though there would be no big arrangements.

If we get together at least we could plan the 2018 convention with street marathons, AT competitions, boots from vendors, etc!

That's what the "..." meant. Stay in Canada America is batisht crazy. The laws are different in different states and they change sometimes without notification. I was able to get a permit to drive with a parent when i was 16 in NC then got my full legal liscence at 18. Also some places it is illegal to drive a skateboard. No but really come visit just be safe and ask questions as you might meet the law on your journey. In some places like Asheville you can legally skate some places but not others or at least that was a law 2 years ago. I really don't know for sure. It sure is beautiful here though, mountains, trails, some basic freedom, beautiful views. I am happy to host visitors too if any one wants to visit let me know. Peace ~J.A.P.
