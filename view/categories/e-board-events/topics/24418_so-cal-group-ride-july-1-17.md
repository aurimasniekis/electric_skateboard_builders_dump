Ok, so the boys want to group ride Venice to Santa Monica and back on July 1.  Being a holiday weekend and the amount of people flooding into this great ride spot, my thought is, could we beat the flood by doing this early.  I would like some input from anyone familiar with the area as the best way to rig this ride day and nail down a meet and greet time. The ride is about 6 miles. Start point at The Venice Wailer, To the Santa Monica Pier and back. Open to All

Parking $6.00, lot opens at 6am.(hopefully the Google Earth photo isn't 5 years old). Meetup time 07:30am to beat the crowd. 4 riders confirmed.  If your gonna make it, post it so a head count can be made. Artie wants a 150' drag race rematch, says eating a salad or two will ensure a win. I would like to instigate more of this behavior.!

Glendale this time, super smooth streets! 4-6 lanes wide! an one of my favorite down/up hills/tunnels.!

We're gonna run the bike path on the boardwalk.. The early start will hopefully get us down and back before it gets jammed with people.

@Kensteverson My first e-sk8 group ride was this run, on my first build. Ate a motor, did a face plant when a stray napkin caught between my gears and had to make a batt swap toward the end.  I have made a few improvements and looking forward  to a problem free ride. Still gonna bring the "Tow Rope Of Shame". Glad to have you along.
