a little birdie told me that @Arch will be there also!

Did not get much response from the dudes on the FB page, guess they're afraid that their BB will get eaten on the track  :hamburger::raised_hand: :maple_leaf: :fleur-de-lis:!  even though i would like to try a BB haha

@rwpino 

Online is probably your best bet, but if you need a hand with your build, always willing to help out.

Thanks!! I have this idea from long time now and I want to build my own electric longboard!!, the first problem is my weight (230 pounds ) I need a motor (or 2 ) capable of move me

1 big motor or 2 smaller will do.

Get a 6374 Sk3 from Hobbyking and you will be fine.

I think at 230lbs going dual would be better, but that will drive the costs much higher.

But you can come try out our boards if you want, we have dual 6355, single 6374, dual raptor2 hubs, dual hummie hubz and dual all terrain 6364.... slight addiction

Ollinboards came out with a custom 6384 made by Turnigy sk3 , ..but much more expensive .

Hey everyone!

I'm located in Montreal too, in the Mile End. I'm interested in building/buying a board too but my issue is similar to rwpino in that I'm concerned about my weight. I'm closer to 350lbs though. 

I've been trying to read up and see what sort of built would be best suited for me, be it long board or a more rigid traditional, how many motors, etc etc... There's just SO MUCH information out there that it's tough to wrap your head around it ya know? Any suggestions would be HUGELY appreciated. I just want something that can get me back and forth to work and maybe around the mile end. I don't need to go up any major hills or anything but some speed would be nice and of course decent mileage. 

Thanks so much for any time you could spare to share your knowledge. Cheers!!

I should be ordering most parts today.

So far my setup is:

10s8p -> Going to have this built shortly. Either 8p or 6p.
VESC-X -> Ordering these 2 today or tomorrow
Board -> Landyachtz switch 42 to order today
Trucks -> Caliber 2 fifty. Ordering today
Wheels -> MBS All terrain to order today
Motors -> dual 6354 260Kv Turnigy to order today
Mounts -> diy electric mounts I bought today
Pulleys -> Bought these today as well.

I have to figure out the remote to order.

I'm looking for a distance ride.. no tricks, slides, etc...

For the vescx hit me in private I got a few up for sale, with a great deal üòâ

Also for the board and deck... I don'y know where you're located, but you could easily find them without the hassle of shipping in a local skateshop like Rollin

Hey Guys,

I was looking for Esk-8 enthusiast in Montreal and found your post.
I have almost finished my build but **I still need to find a spot welder for my battery pack.**
Anybody here willing to rent me one for a day or two ?
