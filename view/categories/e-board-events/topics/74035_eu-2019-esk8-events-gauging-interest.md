In the last time a lot of events took place in the US.
From all I have seen it looked like a lot of fun.
So what I want?
I want some events in 2019 for all of us living in the EU or close by.

IÂ´m not saying I can oganize an event, but I want to get the ball rolling and to find out the real interest should be the first step into the right direction.

If you like this idea and ready to join an EU event than please push the like button and leave a comment with your thoughts about it
-location
-time
-how you could help organizing
-etc...

I know there is a big Esk8 community in France doing group rides and 
other events. Maybe @okp has some tips for us too ;)

As you said, the location should be where the esk8 community is bigger. Also where the law is still grey area, the weather is good, the pavement also good.
Date wise, European summer. Between June-August

The legal situation is definitly a key factor.
Maybe we can also organize an EMTB event somewhere on a MTB track upsides the road.
I would also like to see something like battery and board sharing.
I know a lot of us have 2 or more boards or Lipos to share.
That would give more people the opportunity to join a group ride

Great idea, Though I live in the Netherlands and unfortunately electric skateboards are illegal to use on public roads here (including sidewalks). So far my experience has been that the police condone the use of electric skateboards on an individual basis. I wonder how they would react to groups of E-boarders :smiley:

I think this we better shouldnâ€™t try out ðŸ˜…
The negative feedback on something like this would probably restrict us just even more.
If we canâ€™t find a location where we can drive on the road we can still try to organize an race like @Grozniy suggested on a kart track or similar.

One of my inspiration is the Evolve world cup...or rather the fact most of you arenâ€™t allowed to participate because you donâ€™t ride Evolve.

Buying a brand name, basically gives you automatic entry into a community supported by that company.

As opposed to DIY and smaller companies, you are an island to yourself, with people like yourself spread out over the continent.

Trying to figure out the logistics of this is insane. None of you will be able to make this happen without teamwork. It has be a multi country effort. I see it no other way.

So, many facets to think about. Location, activities, food, lodging etc....all have to be factored in to make the event accessible to as many people as possible.

That is why I suggest organizing locally, then reaching out to other larger groups to help organize and be involved an international event.

I guess there are many ways to skin a cat here, but you need to work within your means. Lotâ€™s donâ€™t have money to throw around, so that has to be taken into account as well as personal time. 

Lots to think about, but better as a team than by yourself like I was.

Thanks for you input!
Iâ€˜m aware that itâ€™s going to be a lot of work to organize events.
Thatâ€™s why I started this thread to find out if itâ€™s worth it, I mean if there is really an interest in the EU members or are those just a few.
If there is an real interest I hope we can form a small team to organize the different parts together.

Iâ€™ve already had a chat with @okp and @LazyRolling about events.  So, it is in there head.

If one of them takes charge like I asked them to...they will need everyoneâ€™s help in the EU to make it happen.

There was a huge effort to get boards shipped. Letâ€™s not forget that.

For example: @LazyRolling sent boards without batteries. @psychotiller sent batteries for them to rent.
Except for a few, I took receipt the boards and whatever else they didnâ€™t want to take by plane. I delivered all boards to the hotel.  

After, i help ship boards back.....as well as a lost helmet â›‘ 

For most it was a three day affair. For me....it was probably a week or so of Esk8Squad Renegade related activities.

Thats great to know how you guys managed the thing with the batteries. I can imagine that it was a lot of running to get everything sorted out.
I had an similar idea already described more up.

To find a way to share batteries and/or decks will make it more easy for people to join.

Hi guys, 

I would be glad to help with this in Spain.

Laws are also changing there as we speak, cities are adopting new legislation to include all sort of Urban commuting vehicles (esk8, electric scooters, monowheels, Onewheels) in the traffic rules. Now, the central traffic authority in Spain (DGT) has been requested from the government to rule this on a national level. the project is in progress.

@Andy87 , when you say event you think about group rides or specific racing events (sports) like the one  https://www.esk8b-dtm.de/ referred by @visnu777 or both type?

I think that ideally, we should define the format, the options, the details and build a model that we can repeat in different European cities with the support of local team members but where the core team would also travel to each event. 

I can be that local team member in Spain, one of the advantage we can have in the south of Spain (Andalucia) is the weather, it's possible to Esk8 all year.

The average temperature is around 11Â°/12Â° C during the winter and 30Â° C during the summer, which makes it possible to enjoy Andalucia all year round.

Let me know your thoughts.

Hi @camarondelax !
ThatÂ´s great to hear that there is some more interest as it was shown till now on this thread.
I wasnÂ´t referring to any specific kind of event.
Just gave some idea.
Group rides are a one day thing and better to organized local.
My thoughts where more about a long weekend event.
A meet up with different activites. 
This can include an offroad ride, a street group ride with dinner somewhere, an race event, some kind of games, maybe even a workshop or visit a local ventor at his place.

Hi @Andy87, 

I'm all in dude, i think it's a challenge and I don't have experience or haven't been able to attend any of these events but I'm excited.

Where should we start? 
Define the duration, the content? 
build the core team? Join efforts with reference such as @okp ?

By the way, where are you from? 

I look forward to collaborate on this!

I really like the idea, I would sit in a car and drive a few thousand kilometers for something like this, and probably there would be some of you guys that I could pick up on the way for the final destination. 

I could help with 2D/3D animation, bringing some projectors with me so we could do 3D mapping on the event. Basically anything related to video. 

Let's make this happen.

Russia. DonÂ´t worry I donÂ´t want you all to come here :joy:

ThatÂ´s a good question and as I donÂ´t know the answer by my own I started this thread in hope we get some creative people together. 
Unfortunatelly the respond on this thread is quite low.
So we even canÂ´t find a direction to where to set the location.
I think we first need to get some more people involved before we can start to plan something.

Great Idea @Andy87! As far as I know 5here are also a lot of Esk8 riders between Belgium and Netherland. I am in a whatsapp group and I can see the Google maps with their locations. In Belgium is legal BTW if you want to take it into account :wink:

Yes Andy, I am one of the people from that whatsapp group. We are working with some people for a BE/NL community. 
What do you want to know? :slight_smile: 

Btw: Belgium is legal. Max 18km/h maybe next summer 25km/h. 
I will fix a groupride in the summer.  I know some people from the Belgian television. I will try to fix a film crew.

Hey @pjotr47 !
I donâ€™t want to know anything specific for the moment, just some more people getting on this thread here to discuss about events we can plan for next year in the EU.
At the moment there are a lot of small groups in different cities and countries and I hope we can get all (or as min close to ðŸ˜œ) together for one big evening.

The Carve Electric Skateboarding UK crew are planning to go to Paris at some point next year, preferably in spring time.

An event either in Paris or London would be supported by us. We can normally get 25-35 e-skaters on rides, and the number is growing well!

Keep me posted if you need any help organising.

Where ever it will be i think iâ€˜ll need to fly non the less. But if somebody could borrow me some lipos for my trampa I donâ€™t have a problem with it.
Shouldnâ€™t be an issue to get the trucks and wheels in the luggage and the deck I can just take with me in the cabin.

Yeah, that's a good point. 
Flight tickets to Malaga can be very cheap if you can use one of the low cost airlines to that destination. 

Last time, it only cost me 35â‚¬ to carry my 2 e-boards in a box as sport equipment with Ryanair. 

And we will be sure to find sun there ðŸ˜Ž
