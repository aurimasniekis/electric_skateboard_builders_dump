Super late posting this but if anybody's in the Bay Area or can get here for a weekend...

![Flyer%20-%20Facebook|690x361](upload://et8ZC200M0uvkzg8TM68PQi1uk6.jpeg) 

Estimated participation 50+ people just from Cali, plus the New York crew is flying 10+ of their finest out to NorCal for the group ride of a lifetime. Possibly even bigger than the brands ride we did last year!

We're getting ready to take over the streets and ride all day!

Meeting place is the Exploratorium on Pier 15 on the Embarcadero at 1PM on Saturday, January 19th. The route involves fast downhills, steep uphills, and 25 miles+ of pure eskating bliss. Prepare your <strike>butts</strike> boards. Mark yourself as going if you can at this ***Event Link***: https://www.facebook.com/events/359479988145750/ 

There's also a speed demons run at 6PM at the Pier 1 Starbucks for speed freaks who wanna ride fast and explore the city in good company. We're taking a concat'ed route around the piers then zigzagging through the city for some nighttime fun. Not for the slow. Mark yourself as going if you can at this ***Event Link***: https://www.facebook.com/events/373551173189721/

Hope to see y'all out there!

Yours truly, http://baesk8.club & http://www.nyceboarding.com/

I wish this wasn't planned for the same weekend as the Barret Junction. I've already committed to driving down to San Diego for the Barret Junction.

Would love to join this group ride, but eskate race history? :P

It's tempting. It would give me a powder day tomorrow. instead of 10 hours of driving. haha

But I've been super hyped about this event for months. No turning back now!

Just depend on the board if it‚Äôs a evolve il recommend 97s wheels but if you have diy build you should be fine with AT

Weather looks OK on Friday so the streets should dry out, weather looks OK on Saturday for the ride at 60 degrees.

yup.  I chanced upon a large group coming out of gg park once that quickly ducked into the coffee shop beside whole foods and left no trace.  


o shit I just read its in 5 hours!  thought it was tomorrow.  I still will probably make it.  burnt the 6.6 flipsky esc and switch in a new one...and cure a quick glue on enclosure.  shit maybe I need faster curing glue.  very doable.

cool will do that.  and the glue will cure.  syched to see the mob and the respose.   thinking of bringing a panhandling sign and cup attached to the deck to raise money for more batteries.  no im not going to do it .  but if I dressed like a total bum and brought out the nastiest remote and duct taped a sign on..i like it

maybe a costume is in order. .  a super long cape.  ill bring my old cassettes for trailers.   or are we low key.   with a mirrored visor on I could be comfortably ridiculous.
