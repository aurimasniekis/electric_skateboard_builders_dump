**Here goes:**

Due to some family issues, @Michaelinvegas has not been online for a while, and I am doing what I believe he would want us to do in this situation.

This thread will be detailing the progress and an open discussion about the 2018 Electric skateboard convention that I would like to host in my hometown of Pleasanton, California. When I first presented this idea, people seemed to be onboard because Pleasanton is right at the end of the BART line that spans the Bay Area, and it has plenty of facilities for us to use. Previously, I wanted to use the Ken Mercer Sports park and The Preserve for most of our events, however in doing research and after contacting the city for a little introduction to my idea (nothing has been approved yet, I'm working on it), I believe it is best to use another area at my disposal:

THE ALAMEDA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS:
![1960pleasanton|690x430](upload://gYZGgkws7Uj1HTrqGF7TiPtFQ2w.jpg)![alameda-map|690x451](upload://zx6F6NnlgDDfD54nOSM5eyzIDzL.jpg)![pleasanton_fair_action_08041|690x401](upload://zCtpU0JmFiXxrcvBp6eNdZVyUNf.jpg)![Alameda-County-Fairgrounds|690x460](upload://bw71PJsJn47Y8Rjt4vGORPrwE2Y.jpg)

This area is huge, and it hosts hundreds of events every year, it's been around for decades and is well known for car shows and of course, the Alameda County Fair. It is available for rent, with a permit and at a decent cost, but I believe it is an absolutely fantastic facility that would support tents from hundreds of vendors in the several large conference center buildings:
![Alameda-County-Fairground-1|650x250](upload://1mdhoCjCZJTweLEK1e7O5Xtvdzl.jpg)![d8213a56-5a34-453c-b79b-255954bf9c56|300x200](upload://lYgnsUz3DnC9AkhsGoTJbhuToO0.jpg)![Alameda-County-Fairground-8|650x207](upload://eVKFEVPinAaJDG50QsxYNQ5lH8p.jpg)

It also has something that may be of interest to those doing offroad racing: A dirt horse track! This surrounds the beautiful golf course, and is open for use if we rent the property (at extra cost). 

I will however need funds and experts who are willing to help me, and I am working hard to get this rolling but any help from vendors who are willing to contribute or at least show up and rent a booth (I.e. @treenutter, @longhairedboy, @psychotiller, @oriol360, @PredatorBoards, etc. .) would be greatly appreciated. Let's see this happen!    

**FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T READ ALL OF THAT:**
The idea so far is simple:
-Get sponsors from anywhere possible to rent Alameda County Fairgrounds for the weekend 
-Host during a weekend in July (I know it gets hot, but we can manage and the larger buildings ARE air conditioned)
-Have access to the conference center so that vendors can display new technology and developments
-Have a swap/trade area
-Use one of the large (and well paved) parking lots for sprint competitions as well as loop track competitions
-Use the horse racing track for off-road competition

I'm also thinking (in rough numbers at this time)
Entrance Fee for General public:
20$/person
10$ if you're a racer

Prizes for winning races are TBD
Price for booths for vendors is TBD

Thoughts? Concerns? Questions? Willing to help? Let me know.

We are now going to make this the official esk8con topic!

Just an update:

With a few delays on the original esk8con area and date, we've decided to move the event! I'm still open to other options if people want to consider alternative locations, but I do truly believe that Pleasanton is the best place to host, and I will be contacting the city to start this thing! Anyone with:
1) backgrounds in event planning
2) a legal education
3) any esk8 related interests or business
4) a connection to this forum or its administrators in any way
is welcome to join the effort! All help is appreciated

I am so in...in fact I know city people in Pleasanton if you guys need to network..

I want to point out there's some hills for climbing right near the downtown and fairgrounds, along with some other great features of this place...perfectly accessible and situated for such an event and the bay area group had over 45 riders out at their last group ride, so there is no shortage of eskaters in the area..it is a prime location, melting California (skating) with Silicon Valley (technology) without actually being in the heart of the bull and traffic in the bay area...

Shoot me a pm with anything I can do to help... ![Pleasanton-Downtown-Sign|690x323](upload://o2VP41pvuBrzgpBfE1COu3QmgiH.png)l

@anorak234 Can we get a roaster for those interesting in attending so we can see the interest. An event like this needs at least 100 attendees. 
Are we looking at a 2 day weekend event?

Great idea, I'll get a roster going. Also yes, 2 days seems reasonable. 

@akhlut I have yet to hear back from the people who I contacted last night about when the event center is open, however given that I have a school-related event in august, and that the Alameda County Fair ends July 4th, I'd say its reasonable to conclude that this would take on a weekend near the end of July.

I was looking into that as well, they have a great area that we could use for a hill-climbing competition. The only problem I can see with that is that it's not close to any bart station, which makes it more difficult to access for riders in the bay.

Very true, it's over on Stanley which is also another great test as it's a long highway with a bike trail between two cities...what about east Dublin near the Bart? There's an entire new town there that might be interested in such a convention...fair grounds is the best but I bet it's costly..that place is event central...

I can take a look at that as well. I know that the Fairgrounds will probably be expensive but I also have quite a few connections within the Pleasanton community (considering I live here), so let's see what the prices are and if we can secure a discount before crossing it off the list.

Another alternative if we do end up at Shadow Cliffs, I can also arrange for transportation from Bart to the area at low cost if needed.

I probably won't be able to go but I know someone in the bay area who JUST started to have interest after testing some boards at the SF Worlds Fair Nano last weekend. I think he's starting to think about getting his first board. But if he doesn't , I hope some of you will bring more than one to share :wink:

Hey @anorak234,

I'm one of the admins of BAESk8 (Bay Area Esk8), and the organizer of that 50-person group ride people are talking about. I wouldn't mind helping out in the organization of this event if you're still interested in help!

A few things I can already see right off the bat:

* Liability is #1. The event needs to be insured in some way. Liability waivers are a start, but there's no way something won't go wrong, and even if you make everybody sign liability release from death or bodily injury waivers, there's no guarantee the organizers won't be held responsible in some way if something catastrophic happens. Hopefully nothing happens, but hope isn't legally binding.
* The Alameda County Fairgrounds is way too large a venue for an esk8 event. It's just not realistic. There are probably only a couple hundred esk8 "vendors" in the world, no more than 50% are going to even consider coming, and much fewer than that are going to actually end up coming. I would go as far as to estimate that only 30-40 vendors max will end up showing, and that's assuming the event gains enormous traction.
* Considering this is a very grassroots event, the timeline is way too tight. I think it would be a stretch for a localized state event, but for a global event that needs advertising and other budgeting, a planning committee, space renting, big finances involved, and countless moving pieces, starting to organize an independent global convention now and planning to have it take place in essentially four months is unrealistic. The event has a better chance tagging onto another semi-related event. I believe personally the more realistic route to take is to be a part of San Diego Comic Con. There might be some overlap between attendees, people originally going to SDCC could join, and people who're coming to the esk8 portion would be able to do tons more things besides just esk8. It's really a win win.

I have more thoughts about this whole thing in general, but people actually want me to keep blabbing :) Just as somebody who's been involved in lower level planning of semi big events in the fighting video games scene, these are some of my observations...

Precisely this. Pretty much everyone on the Discord is in agreement that the only way for this esk8 event to gain traction is to join a pre-existing convention. Preferably one with a geeky demographic, who are presumably very receptive of the concept of electric skateboards.

The venue holds numerous events at the same time it is so large, we wouldn't be using all of it, just a hall or two, or a building near the front. I have gained the contact info of a key person in charge of booking them and gave it to @anorak234 already...

That depends, it's a fairly open fairgrounds, but is so large that events can be up to a mile apart, lol
I have seen crafts shows go on in a hall while they were racing cars on the parking lot or having a model train convention too...there's different entrances for each area, but if you really want to walk over and check out the knitting, I don't think anyone would stop you.

Here's the entire area:
![alameda-map|690x451](upload://zx6F6NnlgDDfD54nOSM5eyzIDzL.jpg)

Here's the area we'd use (bc it has the paved lot and it's easy to get tents set up on the grass)
![41 PM|690x453](upload://dQgyQBEWD4TdINtzhGN1SRJxWs9.png)

And for off-road competition, we can use many of the open fields and dirt paths right next door at the Patelco park for free

@sofu and others here have brought up some excellent points and I would like to offer some thoughts on what a 2018 ESK8CON should look like conceptually.

sSk8.builders is a community of enthusiasts that are driven by the joy of exploring where such a vehicle can take them.  This segment is in its infancy and many of the people here will go on to make great contributions in build technology, electronic's, battery life and power modulation, deck technology, truck design, soft goods, safety equipment as well as developing high performance riding techniques.

All of us have something to offer and to separate us into two categories Vendor / Attendee is not doing either category justice.  I am interested to attend to learn as well as help, not to sell so I suggest we organize this as a conference, not a trade show but a place where we all come together as equals to share our respective experience to shape the future.

All we need to do this are public places to meet, greet and eat.  We won't need insurance, a rented venue or any of the countless details and expenses that a traditional Convention demands!

I think the question that you raise, then, would be if this will be a con for esk8 builders specifically as you seem to imply, or all eskaters.

If the latter, there are other groups to consider, for example, people who buy them and ride them, instead of building them, in which case they're going to want to be able to meet and greet the vendors of the boards themselves as they're as of now typically actual companies.

I personally agree very much that we're still at the very beginning of a grassroots movement. I do think there's a want for medium scale gatherings as evident from the amount of people who attended the [meet & ride event I put on](https://www.facebook.com/events/132199254271789/). I don't think we want to do a global convention right now considering we already missed the golden period for cheap air tickets and have set the date too soon. I don't think many people will be willing to travel for a global esk8 convention right now. I don't think we need to rent out anything at all, but should instead do informal regional gatherings until the gatherings physically can't support the amount of people anymore.

My earlier comments were more for *if we do decide to go the convention route*, and even there I have many concerns... So I do agree with you @Alphamail 100%, and would even extend your sentiments to include the parts of the community that are not on esk8.builders :)

I'm going to have to disagree on that. Insurance is always a good idea, a rented venue ensures that we don't get angry people trying to kick us out, and the idea of having an official Esk8con is something that I love. If other's don't feel the same way, I can stop looking for venues to rent. That being said, I just spent the last 4 hours exploring possible venues and came up with some pretty good results. Video will be up later today explaining my thoughts and providing enough information so that everyone can form their own opinion.

I'd love to have it "esk8 builders only", but at the same time we can get a lot more attention if we expand to include everyone. As it is, I'm considering asking a few established esk8 companies (I have some potential connections) to help fund the venue. That means food trucks, security, helping with energy usage and rent, etc.

**Overall:**
I'd ask everyone to wait on making final decisions, considering I'll have a video out later today with much more information. Thanks!

But not on a community front. We have a few gathers up (NYC & BAESK8) but nothing meant to draw the entire international community by the community. If this event is only for ESK8 Builders, then you’ve cut down a good amount of people, even if you say anyone can come. And while the builders forums are plentiful , it is in no way the majority or even big enough to justify spending money to reserve fields/places to ride, equipment, insurance fees, etc. Both the pre-built and DIY community are built on one another , with one another, and progress when the other makes progress. To not turn this into a ESK8 convention and only a builders convention is insane to me

I'm not sure that's the attention you want, but I wont argue the point.  You are at risk of losing the audience you/we want if you get 100 prebuilt vendors and 3 diy vendors.  I'm not trying to start anything, I just didn't think that was the purpose of this thing.

[quote="Michaelinvegas, post:1, topic:18866"]
In my opinion, electric skateboards are divided in groups…DIY built boards and Production (pre-built) boards, which are divided further by brands i.e. Boosted boards, evolve, acton, inboard etc.…The list seems to get larger every month with a new esk8 company popping up.  Although we all Esk8, we are divided by a kind of brand loyalty, which keeps us divided.

Convention

Noun

1.	A meeting or formal assembly, as of representatives or delegates, for discussion of and action on particular matters of common concern.

https://www.facebook.com/events/260834791028210??ti=ia

Simply.  We need to unite.  DIY and Production need to be under one flag per se.  Sure, everyone involved in Esk8 has got their own angle…but at the end of the day, no matter which Esk8Squad you roll with, we all Just SHRED.  And that is what we all have in common.  We love esk8.  We love it for the ride. We love it for a million other reasons…especially those of us that build them.

Why?  I find that building is almost as much fun as riding.  Prebuilts have nothing to offer me, they typically use the innovations that we discover and very seldom actually contribute to our community.  I don't see the common ground with prebuilt manufacturers, maybe prebuilt riders.  This is for them... [electric-skateboard.club](http://electric-skateboard.club)

That sounds great, and as a general philosophy I am in total agreement, but we are talking about a convention.  A defacto business entity, at least it shouldn't lose money, so outlook planning and management has to take that into account  You don't see milk fans at a milk producers convention, there's a good reason too, they like to drink milk not make it....there is no impetus.  

If yall want a convention for esk8, that's another matter, I thought we were planning a convention for esk8 builders.  I'm happy to take part, even put up some of the cost, but there needs to be a clear project plan in place if this is going to be successful.

This is true, but I'm thinking that most of us are not going to be able to drag our workshops along with us to actually build something from scratch.  :(

That being said, I think there is an opportunity for some subject matter experts to give talks and demos.  I'd do a demo on taking a design to 2.5D aluminum part.  I think I might be able to line up a sponsor for the CNC too.  Just need a decent PC and a projector.  Or even a 3D printing primer for those interested in that topic.

I see this as an opportunity to learn from one another and have a great time while doing so!

For you. Others would disagree. Prebuilts like Boosted and Evolve has inspired people to make better boards and clones. Hell prebuilts are the reason for many on why they’ve become builders or Filthy Commisioners (me 🙁).

So wouldn’t you want to include more audience base that draws in more money to subsidize (I’m bad at words) the cost ? Builders, while wide and large, are in no way big enough nor have the funds (travel, hotels, etc) to faithfully subsidize this event. If anything , you want builders AND pre-builders.

But the idea of this wasn’t founded on “let’s have a builders convention”. It was founded on the very premise of combining **everyone**. Builder and non-builder. Boosted or *acton*. Hell even if you had a freakin onewheel. Even a stinkin alibaba board. 

When @Michaelinvegas started this, he didn’t want a convention based on whether or not you’re a builder. Dammit he just wanted anyone and everyone who had a god Danm board to have a good ass time. The basis of having event only for builders and nice and all, but that is not nor was It ever the basis of what this idea was founded on. (My fault if I’m sounding aggressive bro)

Just some general info - both weekends in July that we were looking at have been taken, so now we’re looking at September or October. Hopefully it’ll get set in stone early enough for people to hop on early prices for flights. @zeno the lists of both members attending and vendors attending are not official, they are just to gain a general idea of who might want to show up so that I know how much space we need. Soon I will be contacting vendors asking individually, asking what the level of interest is.

I say it should be pushed back for next year in order to see all the options available (like whether or not to make this an independent thing or joining an already happening program like @sofu recommended). I know everyone's eager to have it this year, but in order to pull this off, this has to be planned down to the T.  

This way people can plan out their vacation days and travel plans better & like @Alphamail said:

At this stage I'm not sure why we need to build this event from scratch.  Can't we piggyback onto an existing event?  Makerfaire San Mateo/NYC/Detroit seems like the natural fit, and it would provide a built-in audience that might actually grow **_this_** community and provide an alternative entry point to skateboarding/longboarding.  It should also allow us to make contacts with potential future esk8con vendors who may want to sponsor such a convention.  Vendors like inventables, shapeoko, autodesk, epilog, lulzbot, etc.


I totally get the want to have a dedicated convention though.  Look at [MRRF](https://hackaday.com/tag/midwest-reprap-festival/) and how it's grown over the years.  But those guys started small - really small and grew from there.  I honestly think that this first dedicated esk8con should be about building community (riders/builders/vendors) and preparing for the _next_ esk8con.  Try some things and see what works and what doesn't with a limited group of people.  Call it a trial run and learn as much as possible.

Got a call back from both Shadow Cliffs and The Fairgrounds today. Shadow Cliffs said that they don’t cater to events like this, but the Fairgrounds would love our business, given that we use a few different spaces from out original request (that have still more than enough space). 
**Here’s what I was sent:**

All calculations based on 2 day weekend event, with setups and tear down way before/after

Building C 14100 square ft - 3600
Festival paved lot - 9000
Commerce court (green area) - 1200

Total: $13,800

Other info and pricing:

**SO HERE’S WHAT I’M THINKING:**

Rather than pay for a paved parking lot, since this is probably going to end up in September or October anyways, let’s just rent one larger building (thousands of dollars cheaper) and make the entire event (including races) indoors. That way everybody is in the same space, which also makes security super easy. I’m continuing to look into sponsors as well to bring down the cost. Tickets are still looking to be about 20$/person

I still stand by what I said above but I would like to add that an entity that can drop 2K to 10K on such an event will want to control the message and the dialog to maximize their investment. 

I am so much more in favor of a builders, designers, tinkerer, hobbyist, enthusiasts, networking event that embraces the vibe of eSk8.builders.  I personally have very little interest is seeing pre-packaged completes from the present and recent past, I want to help shape what is to come and see people realize their dreams to build the new generation of eSk8 gear.  

It is likely that several new companies would forged from attending such an event.

no worries, I just think all esk8ters should be invited if they're not interested they won't come but you never know who's interested in learning. I'm a big guy 260 lbs and was researching boards for like a year and pretty much all the production boards limits were 240-250 or I would have gotten one as I didn't know about this forum. It was a eye opener and I have met some cool people on here. I also met a bunch of cool people at my first group ride in San Francisco. I was the only one on a DIY and they loved my build and invite me on all of their rides.

@Brianr058 @Cobber

Here’s the basic breakdown:
It’s looking to be at least 12K to get this thing going. That’s a lot more money than I’m used to working with and that’s a lot of money to have to make up. Ticket sales are going to be 20$ a person, which means that the easiest way to recoup that 12K is if 600+ people show up (all profits go towards next year). If we can get more people to show by inviting a larger group of people and not limiting to DIY, that’s exactly what we’re going to do. That being said:

1) vendors will largely be DIY or smaller companies.
2) there will be exceptions for known companies that have sold or are selling both DIY parts and completes (I.e. enertion, diyeboard, etc)
3) if we need to fill the rest of the space, it’ll be filled with any food or skate vendors we can find. 

And finally... nobody should be worried about people who want to compete and have complete boards, because all of the DIY boards would leave them in the dust anyways. For that reason, I see it as illogical to exclude them

And what ever total you come up with now you will exceed. So plan on having a additional 20% of funds for contingencies as a minimum. 

Have you got anyone to put a number on insurance yet? I would expect it to be thousands if you can find someone open to the cause. Thing is soon as you say it has never been done before you might as well add another "0" to that thousands figure. (So the following figures are overoptimistic)

I think a realistic figure for viability of a event this size would be around $20k, so at $20 a ticket that is 1000 punters needed to be viable.

Has anyone ever come close to doing anything on this forum that involved 1000 people in one geographic area?

What is the largest group buy or ride someone stateside has organized for example?

With motor racing and sport in Australia the cheapest way to get insurance is to form a club and have the insures all be members. 

For example as a member and qualified coach under the Australian Weightlifting Association my fee is only $20pa and I am insured to coach Olympic lifts. Even with a university degree as a individual PT this would cost me $1200.

Motorsport is similar...

might be something worth exploring when trying to cross that bridge :thinking:

I'd bake in an extra 30% on top of what you were quoted.

Also writing a tips and tricks on how to fly with the board would be helpful for members. Raise the cost of the ticket to $100 and get some sponsor swag. If you get a large enough group you can pull some bigger names to show up and perhaps sponsor to help offset the costs.

PSA:

After more conversing with some of the representatives in charge of the fairgrounds, they don't want us racing inside the buildings, and when racing outside we would need additional security and insurance, all of which is ridiculously expensive. 

Earlier in this thread, certain individuals mentioned that it would be better to simply find an area where we could bring our own materials and host this for free, and at this point I believe that this is simply the better option. There are many areas in Pleasanton where we could do this, however I do believe that there are probably better locations in the Bay Area or elsewhere. Does anyone from this area have any suggestions?

Kind of off the wall but what about Lake Tahoe.  Plenty of bike paths and trails on the North, South, East and West shores and if the timing is right not a lot of crowds and its not too hot yet.  Each side of the lake has unique things to offer and plenty of public space to meet.  Good excuse to head up to the lake!

This area also has a underground DH scene with outlaw races, they would be a good source for advice on such operations.

I know of more than a few places for such an event, between the bay and Tahoe there's many places. Long bike paths like the iron horse or the sac river trail, both can harbor long group rides without car traffic. We have mt diablo and tam for uphill, Donner pass, Tahoe, all would be awesome venues..

In reality, you need nothing but a place and a date...you put all of us in one spot at one time and it's a convention..no cost at all, we all ride at our own risk all the time, now do it together, invite people..done..oh and take pictures..

Sacramento has outstanding weather for it, a 32 mile long bike trail that's legal for eskates, a convention center, international airport, cheap hotels, expensive hotels, bunch of crazy one wheeler people, close to the giant group of riders in the bay area and centrally located. The more expensive option is the iron horse trail, it's straight and boring, closer to the bay, I don't know the legalities and I'm not on speaking terms with the rangers like I am in Sacramento. And it's in some of the most expensive area in the bay area, so there's that..

We have a local rider group on Facebook Called "California Electric Skateboarding", it's mostly the greater norcal area, Sacramento, chico, davis and so on...the bay area eskaters have a super active and defined group in San Fransisco and they have group rides almost every day when the weather is nice..but riding there is a little harder for people from out of town who don't know what to expect and they only shut down the roads in the park on Sundays, otherwise it's a hill filled danger fest for the inexperienced in San Fran traffic..although there is an established group of guides...

In the mid summer months long safe bike trails that can ackomidate large groups of riders actually doing something or going somewhere besides circles in a parking lot are very rare, I've looked all over for them and Sacramento, the east bay area, Chico there's a few rare places..

I'd have to dive into info about Tahoe, but the riders I do know of there, bomb the hills on the hwys and roads...not really conducive to a group eskate ride, but there might be some longer bike trails open in the summer months. The Sierra got hit with a late snow storm and just beginning to recover, the water is high and we might get more spring showers, but we will begin to dry out quick. 

The bridge work in Sacramento will be done by June opening the trail back up to downtown. We've been cut off from some of the best routes due to an old ass bridge getting updated..They cut off some of the most important part of my route for about 5 months and I've been hating it...it would be be nice to smash it with a ton of people once is opens back up again, it's beautiful smooth bike path through river front parks and history, curves enough to make it fun and long enough to challenge anyone because it goes all the way from downtown Sacramento for 30 miles past hundreds of parks and sights all the way east to Folsom..

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedediah_Smith_Memorial_Trail

The Jedediah Smith Memorial Trail (or American River Bike Trail) is a paved multi-use pathway that runs between the confluence of the Sacramento River with the American River, just north of downtown Sacramento, CA, and Beal's Point at Folsom Lake, north of Folsom, CA. The trail is 32 miles (51 km) long, and is used as a major recreational destination, as well as a commuter artery for cyclists. The trail is considered one of the longest paved purpose-built bike trails in the country. The trail is maintained by the County of Sacramento and is painted with mile markers placed at every half-mile increment.

I am going to grab one of the construction workers the next time I pass the thing and ask them if they are on schedule..

I’m really wondering how many people are going to go to this now. This weekend’s memorial ride in SoCal had like 10 people, I think 7 were from that area who all rode Evolve. Not saying anything negative about the people who didn’t show due to location change resulting in a 3 hour+ drive round trip. 

@MoeStooge How many people showed up at the Colorado gokart track race? It looked kinda empty from your video clips.

Had 8 racers.  Numbers we're thin but was a great facility and I think they are on to something with the indoor kart track.  They rigged it with the owner to run their series on Sun morning before business hours. Had a good time and I believe once they get a race day format figured out it will take off. Oh yeah, urethane surprised me and had relatively decent grip on the kart tracks abrasive surface. ![IMG_20180411_213648|616x500](upload://A6bGK9z9mDRM2dY3uVtZiHyWdIj.jpg)

When: ??? (X-games)

Places/trails:
Long runs
-Soo Line trail (paved)
-Paul Bunyon trail (paved)
Short runs (3mi loop)
-5 city lakes with dual paved paths
-10,000 other lakes most with paths

Facilities:
-indoor/outdoor go-kart tracks (nw burbs)
-skate parks (public and private)
-some smaller city ski hills (good for mt board)
-great conferencing areas near hotels (Example, mpls convention center)

Yeah I really would like this to happen as well. Any chance that this event will actually take place this summer? I'm willing to make the long drive.

Not at a moment - I’m caught up with a few things at home. Between finding a place to host, getting the word out, and somehow getting vendors to show up, I’m going to have to step out

I'm interested in getting this going. Can I suggest we make a committee  and let's meet in person and break up the responsibility. One person can not do this alone. I'm willing to help. I would love to see this take off. This is how Comicon started in a one room basement  now it's multi city. If anyone is interested  in forming  a committee to try and get this off the ground PM me and we can find a meeting place. Let's start with that first.
I don't have a lot of money but I have a very special  set of skills.
I live in N.Calif. Bay area on the peninsula.
