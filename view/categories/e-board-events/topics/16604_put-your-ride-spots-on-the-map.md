A while ago I made this thread...But it was missing something........a MAP!

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/whats-c-l-to-do-or-see-on-an-electric-skateboard-in-your-city-share/3994?u=michaelinvegas

So, I was inspired by @DeathCookies global map of our little Esk8Squad....I decided to create this MAP.....
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WvdewFUp0bUnrexDFlvTqGuhT9I&usp=sharing

I hope you guys help me fill it in with some great ride spots around you or ones that you have been on.  Hey....you never know when I'll end up in your neck of the woods!

Just click on the link....search for the location in the map search bar....locate the place and click +add to map.....You can add photos and a little description.   I'll be adding some spots on the map with some photos and descriptions, take a look.  I entered a few around Las Vegas.

I really like the idea, because I'm always looking for new spots to ride, but wouldn't it be better to integrate this as a new layer to the user map? Maybe divided into onroad and offroad spots?

Yes, I do think the same. Just thought it would be easier if you have everything (people & spots) in one map.

I like the idea of combining people and spots in one map. Should be easy to distinguish: people by symbol and the spot by a route (like in these cycling maps, e.g. gpsies ).

Actually there are already some layers in the usermap (can only be seen in full screen mode), which can easily be switched to invisible if things become too messy.

A bit side topic.. but this got me thinking :slight_smile:

 Do you know what would be cool (?) -

Once the VR type glasses become more widespread.. or something similar like ''google glasses'' comes out.. **that the ''risky'' spots on the road is marked somehow.**. 

Though, this probably would require some sort of high level connectivity and precise location marking to work..

Though this was just an idea I got the other day when riding in some shitty streets :slight_smile:

I know there are a few ''navigation'' apps, which are quite precise to tell you of obstacles / situation ahead of you (like blocked road, car accident, police etc).. so would be cool, if at one day it would be possible to mark the ''dangerous'' spots on the road, so others can avoid them :slight_smile:
  
This is taking into consideration that eboards get more and more popular.. and the city governments wont be able to keep up with suitable infrastracture / roads to safely ride with them on the streets / sidewalks and elsewhere

Just my 50 cents into the future :D

Central Florida rider here. None of my West Orange Trail stations are on here. I'm adding those and the Gemini Springs Spring-To-Spring trail, which is the best trail ever. That one is ideal for typical 220 watt hour 6S to 8S packs as the entire loop is just shy of 9 miles, which is about the range you'll get at fun speed on a new pack that size. I managed to do it twice on a 10S 270 watt hour pack (space cell) but at lower speed. It's also mostly wooded and curvy and gorgeous. 

This video was shot at Gemini last year, mostly on my phone:

Who added sugarhouse park in Salt Lake City?! Seriously couldn't be a cooler spot. It's about a 1 mile loop on super smooth road with cool turns and a few hills. It's a full on wide road but a car drives on it only every 5 minutes or so, so it's pretty much all yours! Seriously recommend it to anyone who comes to Salt Lake at any point. And if so let me know and we'll meet up!

@Dougieman1001  Im not thinking that someone with more electronics knowledge than me, could rig up 'vibration sensor' which many of us could easily copy, then by riding on streets, this sensor could log our Gps position and maybe some other data and tell how shaky or bad the roads are there..

This would create the **Ultimate Esk8 Map** _of good roads and little vibration_

So I was in Alaska recently and the amount of paved trails they have is amazing.  They seem to go for miles out of every reasonably sized town.  Specifically Anchorage, Seward, Homer and a lot in between.

I had a brief fantasy that maybe the Iditarod trail consisted of a lot of paved bike trails and that a group with support could esk8 the Iditarod, but turns out it now goes from Willow to Nome and the locals say that the route is mostly marshland in the summer.

I had already started working on my design for a dual motor ultra-long range mountain board when my dreams were dashed.

A great informative map with lots of potential; Thanks for creating this!

I will add a few spots once I get my 1st e.board build completed... I have a few ride spot ideas but will not add anything until I can confirm they are fun/smooth locations etc

Also thanks to whoever posted the Bournemouth (UK) info, ( @WeeChumlee ?)  especially the ''Starbucks Plug sockets'' location as I will definitely be making a trip down to Bournemouth once I am up and Riding! :smiley:
