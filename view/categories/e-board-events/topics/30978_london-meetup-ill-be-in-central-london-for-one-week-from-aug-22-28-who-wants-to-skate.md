Hi team! Im visting from Los Angeles. Looks like Im staying about 2 km south of the river, however Ive got about 18km of range and a 5amp charger to get around. Never visited as an adult, would love to meet everybody in London to talk esk8 and experience the streets of London! Whats everybody think? I have no plans and will literally just be skating everywhere and charging wherever. Lets figure something out!

Sounds good! I didn't make the last one but may be able to make this one...

North of the river has some good ride spots.... Hyde park and St James' park too...

@itsmikeholland what sort of skating do you fancy?

as @darkkevind mentioned Hyde Park is awesome for smooth footpaths and long rides or do you wanna hit the streets and skate past some icon London landmarks?

The embankment would be great as long as there's not too many roadworks... See the needle, the eye, big Ben & houses of parliament. Go over the Vauxhall bridge and then go back on the south Bank towards the Oxo tower.... Good ride!

I think south bank will be too crowded, you'll be slaloming between people. Hype park it's much larger and less people to avoid.

depends what time we hit the streets. A night ride along those spots would be killer! 

But during peak times Southbank is hard enough to walk at a decent pace :)

Hi everyone! I would be down for a night ride to see the sights without the crowds, what days work best for everyone? Tuesday and Wednesday night seem like they would be ideal for avoiding crowds. I arrive early Tuesday and leave early the following monday. I have absolutely no plans at all and wouldnt be opposed to even taking the train out to brighton or somewhere way out of town for a day ride. Its completely an open book for me!

this is the board Im traveling with. I have 10s4p 360wh and a 5amp charger so I can quickly recharge for more range if we stop at any bars or something. 23rd works for me! should we make the 23rd official? whats a good location for everybody?
Im staying 2km south if the river and can uber wherever is best.

oh whoops I spelled 148wh wrong! i keep forgetting my cells are only 1000mah and not 2500mah 😉 so far no issue from LAX to Barcelona, I also have a preapproval from British Airways that I can show TSA if the Barcelona airport gives me issues.

I would say let's meet at Queensway station ( Central line) and there is less people than at let's say Marble Arch. It's just by hyde park. Then we can ride around park and then off somewhere else. And there will be plenty of pubs around to pop in for a drink and chat ;)

Ohh and if you guys have any parts you wish to trade/give up because you have ordered them in bulk from China and have spare or don't need them any more you are welcome to bring them in. 

I for example just received 6x dust covers for my charging port from China. Need only two, three.

I'm happy to gift them to anyone who needs one or two.

PS. they work with this female socket

There is also male on sale on this listing. 

Very sturdy and good looking port :D

I might have some more random stuff lying around as well :) I'll have a rummage.

I went for a skate and checked out Westminster, Waterloo, South Bank Area.

Westminster bridge is pretty scary, the cycle lane is a bit of a joke, it's about 2 foot wide which means you are trapped between a barrier and buses, taxis, cars, probably not the best idea for anyone who isn't comfortable mixing it up with traffic.

Southbank is a nightmare, the whole area was swarming with people, absolutely no way to skate at all, that said it was Sat evening so probably about the busiest possible time.

The great news is that there is a brand new cycle way on the Embankment, which is a done properly, away from traffic, lovely and wide and oh soooo smooth!

@MontPierre yes I was thinking of you in particular, we don't want to lose anyone on the first outing :slight_smile:

I think we will be all good if we stick to the cycle way, it's as safe as the park when it comes to traffic, there are a few of us to keep our eyes open for road warrior cyclists - if we move to  the side single file and let them past everyone will be happy I think

It is smooth, not as much grip as Abecs as you can imagine, they're only 25mm wide compared to 50mm flywheels, but enough to be honest, I don't ride mega hard or carve loads.

I tried bigger wheels because of the roads, cycle paths and pavements around where I ride are atrocious!

Electric skateboards are a grey area here. There was a case this or last year about a guy who was drunk on his 4WD Eboard and the police wanted to charge him with DUI but case was thrown out by the courts because they believe 'no reasonable person would see him as a road user'.

I've passed police cars and foot patrol and never had any problems. As long as you're safe and considerate you should be fine.

The police are stretched real thin here thanks to budget cuts, don't give em a reason to talk to you and you'll should be fine.

If you see a bored policeman (these are a particularly troublesome breed), just kick when passing them at a reasonable speed.

As long are you aren't endangering others or yourself I don't think they care.

It was a single motor build with a black fibreglass battery box (lol could be any one of 100 boards). We crossed paths one of the most dangerous cycling sections in London, so you can imagine what it's like to board on :) Thus I didn't get much of a chance to chat as I was too busy trying to stay alive.

To be fair I was on a dual+ Boosted going up a hill, I don't tend to take my DIY's onto that road after I had a battery fail that almost killed me.

Guys, I've just realised... We put our boards through a heck of a lot yesterday, some terrible surfaces, bumps and kerbs, stop-starting around the pedestrians and fast riding on the lovely smooth tarmaced cycle paths....

Not one issue with our DIY built boards at all! Give yourselves a pat on the back! You should be proud of your accomplishments! :slight_smile:

Ha ha great! As I mentioned before, I would havre stopped to chat for longer but we were in the middle of the road and thats not a road to mess around on.

Yea, Victoria Park is a incredible esk8 location - made better that it's 5 mins (esk8) from my house. Dat surface quality!

I'm there a few days a week so ping me a message if you're every there or need somewhere to charge your board.

Anyway, welcome dude, perhaps you can make the next meetup?

Thanks mate. Yea I've been planning to head to a few but something else always pops up. I've launching an electric bike business on the side which has been keeping me really busy.

They are e-fixie's (technically single speeds). Weighing only a little more than an unpowered bike and with a useful range of 20miles, (based on the upper median round trip London commute). They formally go on sale in 2 weeks (although through word of mouth with my beta testers I've sold most of them before even launching the site 😅)

Check it out, the battery is hiding just behind the models leg.

@itsmikeholland I have a question. Just looking at your photo again on the bus in the photo thread... How come you decided to rear mount your motor? There's plenty of space underneath your dinky deck to mount it under it?

great question! because i mounted the trucks to the kicktails without any risers, i wasnt able to get the motor high enough off the ground. it was getting smashed up several times per ride! having it rear mounted on the kicktails puts it much much higher off the ground. let me get some pics real quick..

i wish i had a better pic to show of it mounted inwards, its at least half an inch higher rear mountrd even without risers. Youre using risers on your kids board, right? If you try it without the risers youll maybe see the difference it makes because of the kicktails

Yeah you're right about the tails on my other board, if I didn't have the risers I don't think I'd have the room to mount under... I'll have to have another look...

I'm looking in to this solution for clearance and a little bit of suspension!
My only worry is sideways tortion... Hopefully annealing the steel several times will make it strong and springy and not let it twist when steering...

If im not mistaken isnt there a truck similar to this design already? Im pretty sure it works well! Do you have the equipment to fabricate this at home?

Yep Avenue trucks, but they only work with their own trucks and up until recently didn't have a wide truck option.
I'm thinking this would work with ANY truck with the same standard hole pattern.

It's a hub motor, motor and gears are part of the rear wheel. This was to keep the maintenance low and stealthiness high.

I can't make that one though, not because I'm really ill at the moment, but just that I don't have the time at the weekends :frowning: Not so close to a previous ride any way, the Mrs wouldn't like it :D

Data point, got the battery through Gatwick with NO QUESTIONS! Didnt preface or mention anything about it, just kept my mouth shut and was ready to kindly answer any question they may have had. bag literally went through just like a normal suitcase. I assume this is highly YMMV but worth noting that this is the 3rd airport that has given me no trouble
