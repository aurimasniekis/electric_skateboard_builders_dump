You've all been waiting for it and we're finally ready to get this whole thing moving! The Electric Boarder Colorado event will be a 4 day event with a 5th optional day for the people staying long. Thanks to build kit boards for getting us our early deposit. 

**_The dates have been set for June 12th to the 16th!_**

The fees will be set at $75 for early registration fee which ends last day of January. The normal fee will be $100 per rider, also if you pay full price during early registration versus the $75 fee I'll make sure to throw in some swag upon your arrival, however, this is not required and I will accept $75 fees. 

Looking for volunteers as well, if you're interested please reach out to me to discuss and I will give you $20 entry for the 5 days.

Sponsors who are interested in setting up a tent or stand for their products at the event, we will set up areas for you on multiple days, fees will be set at $400, if you are the owner of the company your sponsor fee will cover your rider fee as well. I will also be setting up stock races for sponsors who want to let people try their boards in a stock race. These races are specifically for you to show off your boards and give riders a chance to try them out on a track.

If you are the owner of a company and don't want to pay the sponsor fee then just come out and ride and show your stuff off in person and no tent.

Please send me your full name or a clear identifier so I can get you in our registration for the event. The fund to register can be found here at: https://paypal.me/pools/c/8ak4nDqu78

Feel free to PM me or comment here with any questions.

Article I wrote on the upcoming event: https://www./2018/12/21/esk8-squad-mountain-thunder-colorado-2019/

(Edit section) 

#1: All paying sponsors will be listed as official sponsors for the event and will be added to posters etc...

 #2: Event promoters, these are sponsors looking to put more funds than the required $400 for the event. If you are interested we will be doing higher tiers for vendors who contribute a large amount and will give them first choice of tent spaces during daily setup and promote your company to the top on any ad posters and can discuss other benefits. If this is an interest for you to be a direct promoter for the event, please contact me to discuss further!

#3: Current event sponsors: 

LongHaired Boy/ Esk8 News
Build Kit Boards

#4: Website coming soon with more information!

I'm in, but need a more firm date as this is a 1800mi road trip and most likely a week to take off work.

And if things go good, I'll be doing it in a rebuilt vw bus so gotta leave 4 days early to account for breakdowns. lol.

I can't give an exact date until we can set an exact date, that requires funds. If the dates really don't end up working for you I am more than happy to return those funds to you though. If 25-40 people went in immediately I could set dates by end of the week. Best case scenario we make the deposit by January if that doesn't happen.

By setting up areas for vendors, do you mean proving a tent and tables (likely rented) included with our registration? Most people will be flying and it‚Äôs not economical to ship or buy that stuff there.

We would definitely be looking at providing you with those resources if you cannot bring them. But yes, vendors will be able to set up stands to show off and sell products. Were looking at permits for washington park the first day which has tons of foot traffic and lots of people with loose wallets in the area.

There may be a local company willing to rent the typical tents and tables/chairs that these things usually have to vendors. It may be as easy as just connecting the vendors to those people. then all the vendors would have to bring are things like table drops and posters and shit. OR you could proxy that service for a small fee to make it simpler on the vendors.

@Lunasi, ive switched jobs to a bowling alley off Peoria and Iliff in Aurora. If we decided Aurora was a place to ride, I'm sure we could have a stop there for food, drinks, bowling, chatting and charging. We'd have to reserve it as we get a lot of league play. If interested let me onow and I can talk to upper powers about it.

I probably wouldn‚Äôt do any races but would love to come to meet everyone.

$75-100 is for all 5 days, you're helping us afford permits, insurance, prizes and goodies and other good stuff, your deposits aren't just going to two race days. 

Also I'd like to point out that we're offering all vendor/sponsors the opportunity to have stock board races of their product. If we get an AT board company with extra boards you could stock race one of their decks.

@Lunasi you had said they park gets a lot of foot traffic would it be better for the vendors if the event spanned a weekend as I would think more people would in the parks over the weekend and make more business exposure for the vendors.

As for everyone else that attending the Vegas weekend how did you get your boards there as most of up have batteries that can fly on planes. I was talking to my wife and she said if we don‚Äôt got to Maine that we can go. Might just bring a non powered board so I can carry it on the plain.

Hey Bri, 

The only concern is we're trying to afford the two race days during the week because the rates are much lower. The day in the park would be the first day of the event because it's really a time for people to meet, greet, drool at eachothers boards and cruise around. I can certainly look into that but it would likely have to be a Sunday as the race days would then be Monday/Tuesday with the 4th day being the mountain ride day. I also figure people would prefer to be here at the end towards the weekend so they can go out at night and enjoy bars/clubs or whatever else. Lots of stuff to consider!

The site looks huge.  The race done on the little go kart track before seemed pretty ideal allowing people to get up to only 25mph with a lot of turns and a test of riding abilities more than if the board can do 50mph.

I think we‚Äôre more of an urban sport and like to see an event in the city.   Somehwhere we could easily ride to and the potential audience would be more interested.  Not many people are as interested in the rurals of Colorado as in the cities no?

Yeah I purposely chose a track that actually lets people take advantage of their board versus cruising tight turns at boosted speed. This event really focuses on the builder community and most want to burn rubber on the track. There's multiple races throughout each day and sponsors who bring boards will be given stock races to show off their own product, those races will be skill based as everyone will have the same boards that go the same speed. Also if you've ever raced on a smaller go kart track you'll quickly realize you can only have 2 people on the course at a time or collisions will happen. For a event of potentially 50+ people it would take a long time to run 2 person races all day.

Well we're doing full day rentals on both tracks in order to maximize on the amounts of races and riders so we should have ample time to do whatever we want and don't need to worry about cutting down to save money. This event is really sponsor driven which is why we cut down the cost this year to save you all money. I've spoken to a few sponsors looking to give more funds and be direct promoters for the event and that gives us more ability to supply you guys with a badass event and not have what it costs us being a concern. Honestly the more you can all speak to whatever connections you have with companies and get them on board the more we can do for you. PM me if you need my contact info to reach out, discuss the event further, send my information to company owners.

If we can get a more big names on the books we can really award you all more for coming with prizes and goodies. This event is all about you guys having fun, getting to explore all the names and brands in boarding, riding with people from across the world and making connections!

I'm going to be honest, not really into riding on a cart track. It would be great if we spent a weekend crawling though the city instead of taking off an entire week of work to loiter around a cart track. 

Ideally we would make these meet ups about getting together and enjoying each others company as we traverse some awesome locations.

The event is all just about having fun, we've got 5 days set up where 3 focus on purely riding and the two race days we'll be doing rides in the city the second half of the day, this event really is focused on the having fun riding and the racing aspect is just a simple extra addition so we can all show off a bit. The race days are seriously just to enjoy yourself, that's why we're doing stock races for all sponsors so people can try your amazing boards you're all building.

Also more information coming, but this may become an extended event as we're partnering with our local one wheel group who has connections to go-pro games and may host additional events within a few days before this begins!

I'm going to assist anyone that would like me to in shipping thier boards to the hotel or wherever we end up. I get much better rates than you will if you just walk into a post/fedex/ups office. I can usually get a four foot 35 pound box of lithium packed board across the country for well under $50 by ground. So depending on the size of the box you find, I can send it pretty cheap. Most complete board shipments actually cost me under $40. 

the plan is to set up a ship-to location and then have everyone send their boards by ground via fedex a week in advance, then i can do the same in reverse on the last day when people are getting their boards back in their boxes. 

I can take paypal to cover the shipping.

That would definitely be something to look at.  I'll just carry on my charger and charge in the hotel room.  Maybe one year we can do a beach area.  I would love to do a jersey shore one mainly cause then I could just drive. But also I plan on buying a house and have a board shop there so then everyone could just send there boards to me and I'll store them at my place or at my work and arrange pick ups when people get in.I do like the sound of this being a thing each year. At different spots around the country so other can join in.

Yes, and yes. Probably just $5 for the time. I wish there was some way to help everyone with boxes for their boards in order to reduce shipping further but unfortunately that's not possible. Just find the tightest fit you can to reduce volume.

The race in Vegas turned into a shit show. I can see why people who were there and had never seen a race before would be turned off by the idea if it.  As for people who wouldn't miss racing if it "vanished from our little community." DH racing is where the stability of what your riding came from. Developed and made safer by people driven to win in competition and paid for with blood, sweat and ingenuity. Racing is definitely not for everyone but everyone benefits from those who have raced.

Hey you Moe. My comment was personal and not meant disrespectfully in any way at all. I have a tonne of respect for your engineering, your dive and passion for competitive esk8 and if anyone wants to race they can have at it. That's why I said I'd watch with a beer, it does not interest me in the slightest to compete in all of this.

With all of that said, when I made that comment the focus of this thread had been racing, which correct me if I am wrong, is not the point of these events in general? If it is then I am happily wrong, I'll watch you guys leather up and take loads of pictures for my mastabatorium when I get home :smirk:

The focus of the event is not racing though, 2 of 5 days we're going to be there are at a track, the second half of those race days will be night rides, almost 70-80% of the event is group rides. People keep misinterpreting this because the race days are what we need to lock to set dates, because of that I haven't announced as much of the ride days yet. None the less, I'm hoping some sponsors will run stock races and if there's boards you've never tried you'll have an opportunity to hit a track and try it out.

‚Äôm going to be honest, not really into riding on a cart track. It would be great if we spent a weekend crawling though the city instead of taking off an entire week of work to loiter around a cart track.

I'd vote no on this.  racing may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it would be good to see people throw down and have a good time with it.  And it would be good to see the mfg's boards out there competing.

just to be clear, keep the racing.

and the track can be used for things other than racing.

The point is to get them there safely, would be a short slow paced race and hopefully the riders would be wearing lots of padding. Do it on some slow chinese boards maybe instead of people's main decks.

It's just...the rider in front controls the rider behind.  No visual cues.  And when one inevitably crashes the remote is either going to go to zero throttle or 100% throttle if the crashing rider clenches the remote.  It's a recipe for disaster.

maybe a goofy race?  or a kickpush race?   or a reverse throttle race?

there will be plenty of casual riding and exploring and partying and all of that fun stuff.

It's interesting how everyone is in it for different reasons. Some want to race, others could care less. Some want to ride through the streets, others feel it's too sketchy.

I love it all. But lets remember, this is a vacation. No need to get hurt, so take your best effort and dial it back a bit. That's been my approach lately. I defiantly let myself get a little too crazy for the evolve world cup and I almost ran into a wall at 20 mph on that course at one point. The goal is to have fun, and it's hard to have fun from a wheel chair... Unless said wheel chair has hummie hubs on it!

Yep, it's fantastic. I'd say it's about 90-95% smooth pavement, a small amount of small gravel/dust in a couple corners and some patched up minor cracks every so often. Nothing that won't just make racing it even more exciting... I couldn't think of a better closed off location to ride. @Lunasi and I weren't pushing it hard today either, gonna have to gear up for that üòéüëå

I can't wait... If your brakes are good, I could easily see hitting 45-55mph on the straights.

Good to hear! Trying to get my wife and my friend (Who lives 30 min from the track) to let me know if they wanna do the event with me.

We are coming out there for the dates...just not sure if everyone wants to be there the entire time.

So question: I know I am going to be there for all of the days. But if my wife and friend only want to come check it out and maybe do a group ride with everyone one or two days, do they need to pay the full fee?

Still have s lot of plotting to do on the event schedule so I'll have more information up soon. Riding will likely start around 11am on the 12th and will go until the end of the night on the 16th. Vendor/sponsors will want to arrive on the 11th in order to get arranged early on and also for a special sponsors dinner the night of the 11th before the event. I'll probably throw a small group ride on the 17th as well for any stragglers that haven't left yet.

So my wife, 3 kids, and I are road tripping to Co for 2 weeks or so with the highlight being the Thunder in the Mountains.





I am trying to figure out if we want to do.

1.  a camper van and get a small lockable trailer to load up boards

2. A big camper and tow the Subie Outback out there too.

3. Rent a truck and a pull behind camper 



Any recommendations?

That's a great question I hadn't even thought of but is very valid. For IMI there are spectator fees I have to pay for every person who comes so I think a fair number would be to set it at $50 for a spectator fee, children/teens of parents can attend for free.

@Lunasi I had an idea for a contest over the weekend.  Some small cars in a parking lot, in neutral with a driver behind the wheel.  You get 4 guys on their boards behind each car and have them push, first over the finish line wins.

I came up with this while pushing my wife on her bike up 4 hills while riding this weekend, it actually did pretty good :slight_smile:.

Working on our day 1 permits for a park but coming up on a lot of issues locally since the rental e-scooters basically got all electric vehicles banned from parks until they pass new legislation, so that screws any parks in the entire Denver area. We're looking at other options but one of my thoughts specifically was taking over a multi layer parking garage, what are your guys thoughts? All the vendors on the bottom and people can just ride the garage all day as they please, centered in the city near lots of beer stops.

Also time running out on early registration! IMI motorsports complex has been booked and we're currently working towards permits for lookout mountain which I'll have video up for soon, with a review of the TB direct drive.

Hey guys, 

Sorry if it feels like there's any delays. We've been working with the punches and trying to get some things set in stone but this is definitely still happening. Right now were just getting ready to do a big promotional video for this, the official website we just got up about a week ago, you can find it at TheElectricBoarder.com with all the information on how to sign up for the event.

So far the only delays we had were trying to get permits for some of the Denver parks which we discovered would be a no go. I am not deterred by this however, we have some fun plans for the first day around the city and it will be a meet and greet day as is. 

We definitely still have confirmation on the 2 days at IMI motorsports complex. 

Current (signed) sponsors for the event are , Build Kit Boards, Longhaired Boy, Colorado Cadi and TorqueBoards and we've discussed submissions with multiple more companies. The only thing holding anything back is we're waiting on you all to sign up and get your asses out here to ride for 5 days!

Working on a hotel this week and trying to find a discount for the group but if you're eager to get your shit booked feel free to find anything down in Denver near the light rail and you should be able to commute around Denver to any local stuff easily.

Any more questions, feel free to ask me :slight_smile:
```

This is what I am most psyched about anyway TBH, riding around the city with my buddies!


Thanks for the update and all the effort that goes into something like this.

I've got some bad news. (_TL;DR: I will not be able to ship anyones boards to this event._)

My aggregate shipping provider has made some changes that are pretty devastating. 

Because of my schedule (basically three jobs with family and kids) and because of what I ship (big lithium batteries, boards with big lithium batteries) I can only use a certain very few carriers, and only one of them makes any damned sense to use: FedEx. UPS has an awful reputation for destroying packages and DHL simply isn't present in my area unless i want to schedule regular pickups during hours that i can't possibly be home. 

At some point over the last couple of days, my shipping provider dropped FedEx, which will basically force me to pay full price on shipping via FedEx manually and remove it as an option for selecting as a carrier on my store.  

This will affect my builds, the builds i'm doing for other esk8 companies, and the evolve mods. 

But most relevant to this thread, it means i will not be able to provide a cheap way to get your boards to Colorado. Unfortunately, we're all on our own for now.

2 months out, I'm getting so exited! I really hope I can finish my MTB in time but IDK if that's possible with my meager pay and the cost of the overall trip. I probably need a 4 amp charger too since 2 amps takes 8 hours to full lol.

I've been getting quotes from shipping container manufacturers and it looks fairly reasonable to have a custom sized crate made to fit 2 boards. (~ $250 total round trip including container cost) It's more than I'd hoped but at least I'll have a good box for future events.

off topic here... Kinda glad I have scheduling conflicts that prevents me from attending...but did anyone else get fuked in income taxes this year? Now I'm relieved I no longer need plane tickets and a week of hotel cost.

I'm interested in the hotel cost just to see how much this would've cost. I can't wait for the 3rd annual Florida event!

Y'all got to this just before I got moving today :stuck_out_tongue: Was just about to do a big update.

Let's get started then, everyone is asking about hotels. The hotel deal is set up and they have rooms on reserve for us until May 12th. You can still get a room there afterwards but the prices will go up after that date. 

**Hotel Details**: 

Hometowne Studios Denver (Glendale/Cherry Creek) 4850 Leetsdale Dr, Glendale, CO 80246

Reservations open for rooms with single and double beds until May 12th

Contact: You may either contact Angie Preston at Angela.Preston@whgextstay.com and let her know you are part of the Electric Boarder festival group (You can also call her at 720-210-8893 but only during reasonable hours please). You may also call the hotel directly and also refer that you are part of the ride group at (303) 333-2545.

Reserved Rates and Availability: 25 single beds are available currently for $64.99 for weekly or $74.99 daily. 8 doubles are available currently at $84.99 weekly or $94.99 daily.


**Event updates**: Not much has changed from the original vision. We realized with current laws set out by the rushed legislation of electric scooters that certain things are a no go, for example park permits. Because of that day one has just been re-visioned as a ride day instead of a park day. That means there's 3 set ride days for this event, day 1, day 4 and day 5, all with different locations and fun to be had. 

Most the information you guys need to sign up is already up here, but if you're looking for another place for it you can find more information at TheElectricBoarder.com or reach out to me on an individual basis. 

**Currently signed sponsors**

* Build Kit Boards
* 
* Longhaired Boy
* Red Ember Boards
* Colorado Cadi
* TorqueBoards
* Kali.NYC

**Sponsor Contract update**
We've lowered the fees on the sponsors and tried to make a more equal playing field for all players. Contact me if you have any questions about this.

**Current Sign up Fee** 
$100 for ticket without swag/goodies
$125 for ticket with swag/goodies

**Payment Link** https://paypal.me/pools/c/8ak4nDqu78

**Extras** Special decks being made for prizes by @mmaner and @Sender

3rd batch = shipping after April

Now, 3rd batch is "shipping may or June"

Note shipping, not receiving. I'm seriously considering buying one from the second batch (someone's gotta have one) and selling the 3rd batch when it gets here.

Then again I'd have to ship 2 boards so maybe it's a blessing in disguise?

And check out this bad boy. This is a Red Ember Soma that is going to be up for raffle at the event. Still needs frit and the bottom to be finished.

It is going to by $5 for 1 ticket, $10 for 3 tickets,  $20 for 7 tickets, and 20 tickets for $50.

All proceeds will go into a beer/other festivities fund for all of us there, so buy a lot of tickets.

Wow, I can‚Äôt even believe it‚Äôs already 5 days in and over! You all have been so amazing to hang out with this year and I feel like I make more friends every time I come out to these. I really want to thank all the sponsors and riders who have been really wonderful in coming out and supporting my event, I appreciate you guys more than you know. I‚Äôm really looking forward to putting together another event for you all this coming year and can‚Äôt wait to see the community grow more. From the bottom of my heart I already miss you guys and I wish we all lived in a place called esk8 city where we could ride all the time together. :yum:

Please post pics and vids for the community to see! :grin:

Thanks so much for putting this on Corey, I'm dropping my boards off at Fedex this evening and wish so much I didn't have to and that I could have a few more days of this. Everyone from this community made it a great vacation for me and I can't wait for next year's event in Florida. 

I'm pulling that last of my footage off my camera and there's a lot of great stuff. I'll be sending it to TheElectricBoarder and Tishawn. I'm sure there's something in there you will want.

Hahah thanks big guy!!! It was fun trying to keep up with you while you casually carved the entire width of the track but still continued to move forward at 30mph!!! It was so cool to put a face to the names here and see the boards.


Like I never knew @Sender rode something that sounds like a fucking chain saw.

@Saturn_Corp

Awesome Joeben! But it seemed like I was behind you most of the time! You definitely like to send it a bit more than me, and i was 100% amazed at how well you ride.  the only thing holding you back in the slightest is motor heat! And maybe sweaty socket syndrome.


I really had a great time everyone. I‚Äôm still not sure how I lost my remote but definitely an easy fix. @Lunasi did a great job and put in a lot of work to make this event what it was, and for that we thank you so much Corey!






PS
Thanks to the 5 or so guys that tried out the meepo! I know it wasn‚Äôt exactly exciting compared to the new la croixs or anything but the price/performance ratio is still impressive in my eyes and I appreciate you humoring me!
