went there for a visit last year, really nice place. 

however, not sure if i could handle living there permanently, the isolation would either fuck with me mentally or make me really happy...

i could see my self-running a microbrewery or something & just be talking about beer with folks all day.

Excuse my American education, for a second there, I was wondering why the Raptor 2 has a demo ride in JUNE. 

I changed the date format just in case
