Hi, 
Nice post, it's a pity you didn't receive any reply from other riders back then.
I'm sure there is more now who may also be interested in Meeting up.
If you check my profile you will see the current organised Meetup, it originally was about Electric Unicycles, but from time to time Electric Skateboarders and Scooters joined us, so now we changed it to be a meetup for Electric Rideables in General.
If you see the previous meetups, we have done others out of the city centre previously, we plan to do more of those this year, this coming one the 13th May is in the city centre for about 4km and then for longer for those who still have juice (all skill levels and devices welcome, even if with small batteries :slight_smile: )
