Hi Enertion, My name is Chris Sherman and ordered a board from you way way to long ago. Why havenâ€™t you sent it to me in any of the 5 different time lines your company has promised me. I have sent easily close to 15-18 emails in the past 3 months and havenâ€™t heard a thing from your company. In fact the guy Adrian I finally got in contact with for a day just ignores me after his first few messages. He told me a month ago I would receive it in 3 weeks. Itâ€™s now already been 4 weeks and I donâ€™t have it, and he refuses to email me back. What kind of customer service do you have. Why are you guys not shipping my board I have already paid for. Why are you scamming me. Extremely insulting customer service on your end. Where is my board? How much longer do u really want me to wait. I mean Really?? You give me timeline after timeline and your company still canâ€™t honor that. I am tired of waiting. Ship me out my board already. If I do not receive mine this month I demand a 110% refund for false advertising on your end. My bank is already tracking. Respond already and quit ignoring your customers.
