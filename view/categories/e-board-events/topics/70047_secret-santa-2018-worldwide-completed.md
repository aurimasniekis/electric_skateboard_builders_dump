The time has come to start the preparations for Christmas :christmas_tree:
As @Youssless created last year, i would like to continue it :D 


Guidlines:
- Worldwide/zone specific. if you would like to participate, bear in mind that you might have to ship your gift overseas.
- 3 days reading time and 50 received likes to be able to participate
- Minimum value of the gift 15USD
- You can send your unused parts or buy and gift new ones, your choice :sunglasses:
- Create a wish list with what you would like to get
- create a gift list of what you can gift
- Write your address in the form. I'll not come to your door with a chainsaw :smiling_imp:
- Chocolates of your country/region are mandatory. This way if the gift is shitty, at least you'll have something sweet :rofl:
- Best wishes card is mandatory. pictures of your mom are accepted :stuck_out_tongue:
- what to give for users who have it all or who own a esk8 store? In the wishlist, write also your hobbies. be specific. This way you can be creative.
- Be creative. Comsumbles items are welcome, bearings, loctite, bushings, griptape, drugs, condoms, the usual stuff
- You can even buy something online and ship it to your drawn person. 
- Sex toys policy: if you decide to give one, keep in mind that other members might get jealous. If you're all set to gift it, clean it first :stop_sign:
- This is based on  mutual trust. If you want to participate, your honour will be at stake if you bail out. No-one will be responsible if a gift wasn't received/sent. What i could do is just let the sender know that the receiver didn't get his gift yet.
- October is to think, get ideas and sign up for the Secret Santa event.
- 1st of november will be the draw of names.
- November is to get/ship the gifts
- By december, everyone should have their sweet package waiting :gift:
- This way we avoid busiest time of the year of the parcel companies.

Any sugestions are more than welcome :innocent:

Here is a pool to choose:
[poll type=regular]
* Worldwide Secret Santa
* USA & EU separate
[/poll]

The way it was done last year. It was made so no one had to ship overseas. Some did due to their wishlist and who had it. 

It wasn‚Äôt really random. @Youssless did an awesome job figuring who had what to give and who needed it to make the gifts more useful. 

I‚Äôm down for the 2nd Annual Esk8 Secret Santa!

Btw American commercial chocolate is generally too sweet but like everything else our best stuff is not commercial products but hand made stuff.

May be it should be split by countries or atleast US and UK EU. Might help those who want to join but can barely afford shipping cuz $10 is good but the shipping to other countries can go up to or around $23 for something small. Anyways just an idea

@Grozniy

looks like the way this drawnames thing works is you have to enter everyone's info into one secret santa group.  so you'd still have to collect names.

---

looks like you are, are you just using this thread to collect names?

u wanna use this form to collect names?

send me your gmail email address and i'll make you owner.

 @jasonbhuynh, last year I didn't participate by missing 1 like
 @Rod12579, yes
 @Skunk just don't send broken trucks :smiley:  
@Lambjr088 I just made a pool for people to choose
 @mmaner group can be set up only when I have all the emails
 @Tamatoa, that's why you have about 2 month to save some monies for shipping
 @thisguyhere, yes please, thanx

shit, 50 dont go far in esk8.  but if we just giving rando stuff then 20 is fine.  shrivers salt water taffy and some mints is a good start.

Everyone just gotta remember it‚Äôs the thought that counts. I was matched with someone who got what I had to give and he needed/wanted it. And I received the same....all the way from the UK. 

A wish list is good, but don‚Äôt set your expectations way too high since there are those who have a smaller budget than others. It‚Äôs about the giving and helping out as well.

@Andy87, no. If we decide to use it, I'll add everyone and start the draw. Then you'll receive and email to join. Then you can write your wish list online. But depending on the outcome of the poll,  I might have to match people by continent or make 2 groups in that website.

Please god just no one send me a dildo that would by far be the worst gift ever unless your into that sort of thing.

Personally I feel like the minimum should be a bit higher.  Last year there were few gifts in the $10 range. Hell, a lot of us will be paying that much in shipping alone.  If you get me, I guarantee my present will be worth well over $10.  Thats a weak ass grandma price that is a bit of touch with how little a buck buys these days...

I've only been on here few months, haven't even built a board yet.  Don't really have extra, or old parts laying about. 
I'm probably gonna end up just buying someone somthing new. Definitely over $10.
No moonshine decks unless you get me one too.lol

No but where I live they have huge profit margin. For example, i bought a palm router overseas for around $130, the local shop sells it 350$. Only difference is the local shop gives me 6 months warranty. And they are authorized reseller of the brand so they probably get them cheaper than I paid it at retail price.

I‚Äòm from Russia and as we live close to Estonia and Finnland it‚Äôs very common to drive there and buy stuff tax free.
As i heard they will reduce that tax free value to 500$ from next year. 
The thing is that usually the shipping is expensive, so the money I save from taxes I can spend for the shipping.

So this is interesting. We have 98 voters for the poll and 50 form submissions. The plan is to match people on 1st of November but I might start it before.
Edit. I just looked through the last year secret Santa and they were 48 people. I would like this year to have more :)

i got a baggie full of loose cables and shit, like jst-5, voltmeter, some loose nickel strip.  it was trash but then again i just recently made use of it so it turned out ok.

Important question about this little guessing your own Santa contest.
Do they need to guess before their stuff arrives or are they allowed to guess after they receive their gift because I'm pretty sure whoever gets mine is going to know its from me.

Yeah I am definitely siding with you on this plus your box is 33 lbs so no telling what would happen to that thing. So it would be in everyone's best interest to put there return address on them because some of the stuff is worth more than the 100 buck fedex or ups would offer you if it was lost.

yea!!! 
When did it change to mustaches in november?! Like "Movember" or something like that.

I read an article a while back that if a package of Oreos (made for the USA) was accidentally sold in the UK, the company would be fined almost $250,000 for ingredients that have been banned and outlawed in their country as being "dangerous for human consumption"

Well....you did eat at a Wendy's. Its not the shit there, its the lack of actual food that passes any sort of quality control.

Now they are probably one of the "better" quality fast foods....but half of the shit the serve is pumped so full of crap and preservatives. I think Taco Bells beef is only a few steps up from the quality that is approved for dog food here too.

Understandable that you are disappointed in your gift if you find no real use to it, but we have to remember that the intention of this is to give what we have and can. It's not necessarily about purchasing something new as a gift. Often times, someone's trash/excess is someone else's needs. Maybe you can make someone else happy in the freebie thread. Maybe the new/unused part was from this year, last year was anything goes? Personally I would rather get a working used motor, than a $25 bag of XT connectors :thinking: know what I mean?

I went overboard because that drone just wasn't being used and Mike wanted it since last year but didn't want to take the plunge, can't blame him since I rather spend that amount on gear drives or batteries. I just made this as an reason to gift it to him.

i hope this makes you feel better. i was going to wait but, i had my mom open my package and havnt been to her house to see it in person but we got similar gifts. mines higher quality but same idea of parts that were tried to be used/or used and then regifted. 

tbh, i was stoked just with my personal note and the thoughtfullness of a stranger sending me some gear to add to the misc pile!

for reference, im sending gummies to my santee. i couldnt be happier in giving someone a cool ass gift that i know they'll  enjoy or at a minimum be able to turn around and sell and get whatever they want.

That is a really nice gift, did you actually ask for a deck and enclosure? Next year I should dare to ask for nicer stuff. You are really lucky! Also, no offense, but I don‚Äôt know how that is supposed to make him feel better. Not that I think he is right but your gift cannot compare.

i asked for nothing. if i want/need something, i buy it so theres not really anything i "need"

i understand mines nicer but its the same idea behind it and i think we have similar situations to items that we dont "need" and im happy that someones thinking about me. im curious what that user's age is. i use to act like that when i was sub 20

I think that there should be an age requirement.... obviously its based on the merit system, and the worst that happens if youre outed is you cant participate until you do meet the requirement?

Screw agw limits. Set pricing tiers. Tier one: Used-50 Tier two: 50-100 Tier three: 100-fucking amazing drones. Choose your tier and be matched with another on that same tier. Easy peasy lemon squeezy

Edited tiers

I guess pricing tiers would be okay.
But then you have big dogs giving gifts to big dogs. I kind of like the idea of some of the bigger vets and more experienced members giving amazing gifts to rookies.
Maybe just don't participate or don't give an expensive gift if you're not willing to receive a minimal gift?

I think it's all about giving.
 It depends on the receiver if his wishlist was specific and on the sender if he has the means to send what is needed. 
If someone doesn't know what to give, they can always contact me and I'll ask for specifics.
I don't think we should limit too much who can participate,  that's being greedy imo.
But bashing publicly  is not correct.There is always the possibility to send a PM first to me so I could help. It's the same as vendor bashing.
About this gift specifically:
It's is possible to build a beater board for super cheap now.
Just get a discounted sk3, short board, some belts, cheap HK/flipsky vesc, some lipos and voila. I'm sure you could even get some parts for free on freebie topic. An awesome board for a friend/family to ride. Or to take on a trip and if you loose it or something, it's not a huge loss.

Shipping is likely difficult for me and whoever I‚Äôm matched up with so I‚Äôm honestly fine if I don‚Äôt get anything. I don‚Äôt have a high value gift either cause my budget went into my first build which isn‚Äôt done yet and I really dont have as strong financial background to begin with

 but I tried to make the most out of it and hope it does help the person out. I enjoy the giving more than receiving anyway.

I know I‚Äôm not @mmaner santee but I think I‚Äôm just as excited to see what he sent after he had said it was 33 lbs because that can be nearly anything including a 33 lbs sex toy.

Just wow. Ungrateful much?
Instead of complaining, try and make something cool out of the stuff or give it to some kid who wants to build but needs a leg up.
I think "unused" means parts that you are not using. Not that havent been used.

What makes secret santa fun (for me):
- Being a secret santa
- researching
- secretly giving someone a nice surprise

What makes it less fun:

- People constantly revealing themselves to their santees because they are not modest enough and need to boast about the super expensive stuff they can afford to give. - Stop posting pics of what you are giving and put a friends address as the return address if you are serious about being a secret santa.

- People filling their wishlist with really greedy wishes and only participate because they hope to get one of these super expensive gifts.

- People even complaining about what they received. 

If you start banning ppl for not sending expensive gifts or introducing price tiers, everybody can just go to the shop and buy their own gift. That way they don't get "cheated"
This shouldn't be a competition.
Imo there shouldnt even be a wishlist, except on santas request if he is absolutely clueless on what to give.

I do believe having lists is a good way to go, but perhaps next year if you want to put high price items on it, you should also include affordable small items. You still end up with cool things you want/need and might even get a big ticket item, but your santa still has good ideas if they can't afford something big.

Wanted to share....

Skunk‚Ä¶you bastage‚Ä¶LOL I sent you a safety care package to ensure you stay alive awhile longer‚Ä¶maybe even till Christmas.  Band-aids, Floss (used), Reflective Tape( less than a role), Batteries (that size you always wish you had), Chocolate just in case you are diabetic, expired Gummy worms (as I wanted to see if you would really eat them‚Ä¶2 years ago Halloween candy), and Silly Puddy just in case you are short of duct tape as Silly Puddy has a 1000‚Äôs uses. LOL‚Ä¶

I was just hedging my bet like if you died before x-mas I was shorting your stock however sent a care package to your advantage.Santa works in mysterious ways.

Remember Christmas is for both coal and presents‚Ä¶continue to be a good boy and share on the board and the Elves will do the rest.

Enjoy @Skunk and feel free to post your real North Pole Gift...

So because of so much love around here, I had an idea.
It's called "Merry Christmas"
The goal is to everyone having a gift that they can put to use.
The way it could work is:
- the fund that @Skunk made for my gift, can be used to keep donating some monies
- means that anyone can donate as much as want to this fund
- then everyone who didn't receive a gift or didn't get a useful gift, can apply for a new gift
- these people send me PM and we will evaluate if it's eligible
- to keep it simple, me, @Skunk , bearded angel @mmaner and mom @anorak234 , could decide about each request
- the priority will be for whom didn't get anything, then for those who were not happy with what they got.
- certainly there are members who have a lot of extra unused parts that they could give away.
- so everyone who has extra parts  that they don't mind giving, we could pay for shipping from the fund.
- or we could buy something 
- for this I would just need a new form (excell)with few questions.
- the request deadline would be until 31st December and new gifts would be shipped/bought until 15 January.
- all the remaining funds could be donated to a charity foundation or could be invested in some esk8 related manner.

I hope I didn't make this too confusing
Please give your opinions

The fund is already closed, but opening another is not an issue. @skunk and I decided to sit on the remainder until the secret santa was over, in case someone didn't get a gift, then figure it out. 

We discussed a lottery, and a couple other things. There's $62 remaining (I think, I'll need to double check).

I think the no gift solution is good, not so sure about the ‚ÄúI think my gift was shitty‚Äù thing, maybe if it was truly shit and was communicated by pm only?

Wow - so excited. My gift showed up at the doorstep, the amount of thought put into the thing is really incredible.

Now I have Gummies and good pneumatic tires that will last me a while.

![image|374x500](upload://rRplA7Ey5XBS9kobAR9csTSimzq.jpeg) 

Also somebody really took the time to figure out what my favorite things are, because 
1) I LOVE stickers. So every single one will be put on my mountain board.
2) idk if it was guessing or my Santa found a post of mine from a while ago but Haribo Coca-Cola bottles are my favorite candy on this earth.

No, it's not a real courtroom. They flew us down to LA. On the day of the shoot they bring you to a CBS warehouse with the Judge Judy set right next to the Joe Brown one. From the outside it's just bare 2x4's, but inside it looks real. Then they pay actors to sit all day as they film case after case. Our was filmed about 45 minutes and they edit it down to the best 9 minutes. Then they pay the losses for the loser, which is why they ever agree to come on tv in the first place

He did actually do landscaping; very ironic. I think he just got scared at the time, and certainly may have been drinking but I don't know.  A few months after the show aired on tv my brother spotted the distinctive car driving in Portland and he pulled up alongside him signalling him to roll down his window. When he did my brother yelled "watch out for those fences jackass!" and sped off.  Oh, I can only imagine what was going through that guys head. Makes me smile

This summer, after I built my first esk8, my 12yr old tried to ride the board while sitting on it. She lost control, went way too fast (18mph on the sidewalk before I could even shout "stop") fell off and the board slammed into the side of my neighbors car denting it. haha. Since then she won't ride it, but will let me pull her with a rope while she's on skates. Baby steps to get her back on a board ;)

I have a RING camera doorbell. I hope it would a deterrent, but my wife said it probably attracts people because our house now looks like "it's got something worth stealing".

Anyway even without the doorbell you can download their app, enter in your location and it will show you ring owners who post their recordings....Soooo much mail theft after black Friday and Christmas season

I've already made a microwave spot welder, which I haven't used yet on my pack, so I could switch to using this one if it doesn't work out.

I'm such a free bird in my job, what's it really like being in an office space like that? I imagine there are some benefits that I can't get access to. I am field based and so spend most of my time in client's buildings and sites.

I actually like cubicle and office prison. A lot of people here actually have remote working privileges so we can work at home of wherever we like as long as we are connected. I can't work from home, too much distractions. I often work at the Starbucks across the street
https://youtu.be/EKEeHREK2nQ?t=22

Best perk of working in an office space is we have a bunch of empty cubes here, one is basically where I build my boards. I get access to USPS, FEDEX and UPS materials and postage at a discount. Oh, I send stuff here so lessens the chance of package theft.

I used to travel for work, got tired, SoCal traffic makes that very hard to do .

Those are some pretty serious perks :open_mouth:

I'm quite fortunate where I live, I very rarely run into any real traffic. My customers are all pretty awesome and I don't sell anything so they enjoy seeing me. Also I'm super fucking devilishly handsome, some days I get really tired of men and women both hitting on me and pinching my extremely muscular butt.

It's a hard life (hard like my butt, not sure if I mentioned how toned it is)

OK, so I¬¥m a bit lost now...
Do we have sombody french here?
My parcel to my santee should get to the US but stuck in paris CDG according to the tracking data, already since 15.11. :scream:
So idk, maybe the tracking number changed after the parcel reached france, it¬¥s still waiting to be proceeded, or it is lost....
I tried to get in contact with the french post, to ask about the status, but unforunately my french is like not existing and I don¬¥t get any information.
So if we have somebody here who could call the french post and ask about the status of the parcel that would be just great!
If you would be ready to do that, just sent me a pm and I let you know the tracking number.

If i hit 25 mph I loose it in just a few seconds and then it goes back home, which is the last place it took off from.  The scary part is that it doesn't follow the same path back, it just goes and there's always houses and tree, and god forbid, cars in the way :slight_smile:. 

The Follow Me function works really well, I'm surprised at how well it works, but you cant outpace it or it can be problematic.

the taffy is...taffy.  just a ton of flavors.  the mint rolls melt in your mouth.  the chocolate mint ones are my fave.  the fudge is rich and velvety - two flavors, marshmallow and rocky road.  both are great!  

man, i wish i could send a pizza.  light, airy crust with a slightly sweet sauce and heaps of mozzarella.  baked in a 3 tiered rotating oven at some ongodly temperature.  shit cooks so fast its insane.  but seriously, best pizza on the boardwalk and thats saying something.

and the beers.  cape may brewery is great!  but slacktide is my favorite, and they just started canning or else i'd have sent you more from them in the care package.  they all good!

the only thing i missed was the local distilleries...maybe next year.

Its lots of cool random but well thought out stuff, like a bluetooth module, some 3d printed stuff for a basic build like a bezel for a volt meter, some loop key prints, and these cool small micro bindings. 

My dog's wouldn't let me take a decent pic, they were either running over everything or fighting in the background!!

Yeah that‚Äôs tricky. Once they get over a 100 quid I‚Äôd be very hesitant to open it too especially if there are only so many left on the planet. 

Then again it is just a drink and can only be drank once. Also if you have a bit of money, like a million in the bank it gets easier. 

I say open that one up on the next special occasion. 

I had three bottles of the glen dronach 2002. They‚Äôre all gone now. I got married, my father passed on, and I had a baby.

Literally the day I opened it, I got an add on facebook for that same brand!!!

I love those things, I used to carry a bandanna with me all the time, called it my "windshield" for my motor cycle. My dad is a long distance runner and he gave me one of those to replace my bandanna and I've been using them ever since.

Seriously, this was an awesome gift box, gotta buy some abec pulleys so I can try out those big ass wheels!

I'm a swiss army knife here at work. I work for a global distribution/manufacturing co. I've done marketing, sales, graphic design, IT, R & D, QC, ect... I just took over our creative department where we design and manufacture hot rod parts and other things. I'm lucky enough to be able to switch around and learn new things. :slight_smile:

Not hiring for anything other than warehouse help right now. We're getting ready to move this building to a brand new building.

Confession time: I've been super busy and the local post office has been swamped because of the wildfires and haven't got my git out yet.

To make up for it I'll find something nice online today and order it directly to my santees address so they at least have something cool before Christmas rolls around. I guess it's time to slack off from work for an bit and browse retail sites ;)

That's awesome. I work in data centers but I've been trying to move into the more "corporate" side of the house. I have a degree in marketing but I've never used it once, kinda random path to get where I'm at now but I really do enjoy my job. 

I just feel a little stuck right now because I've been doing it for the past 5 years and I'm comfortable, but I think I need something new soon!

@MrHappy and @pjotr47  were there tracking  numbers given to you by @Grozniy and what was the last record that the numbers say.  Also have you sent your packages and your santees received them dont need who your santees were just if they have received them.  @MrHappy where are you located @pjotr47 I know you are in Belgium.   As I would contact the courier as they are accountable for your packages.  And where your packages crossing the atlantic as it could be held up by customs.  That tends to be the real pain in the ass when shipping international as the contents descriptions are super outdated/ very generalized.

Well as you can see one of the packages is bigger then the other so one has a ‚Äúpackage‚Äù within a package if you remember part of @Sn4pz present to me.  I had to regift it because it is the gift that keeps on giving.  So hopefully the person recieving it has a sense of humor if not sorry my bad it was a joke.  But both do have a personalized gift to each person in it as well.

I could never guess the amount of money for the time I spend on boards. I usually sand the board before stenciling on the design that takes about10-15 minutes. Stencils take about an hour the longest took 2 hours. Then woodburing can 2-4 hours longest took 6. Then if there is color about an hour for that. Clear coating doesn‚Äôt take me a long time just a lot of drying hours over the course of a week with sanding with 800-2000 grit paper.  And most of my boards sell for $100-$175. But I don‚Äôt have the client base or popularity to charge more for my boards. But everything is done by hand

@Grozniy are the people who where the Santa‚Äôs for the several people who haven‚Äôt received a gift yet established members. Like atleast a year/ more than 6+ months or were they all newer members.

Just trying to figure how we can eliminate this stuff from next year. Also do we know that they all got presents.  Maybe after Christmas and we have a tally of who got presents and who didn‚Äôt we can expose those who didn‚Äôt send a gift and bring them out to be tarred and feathered and public shaming

Yeah, shipping companies loose money left and right. They are constantly evaluating methods to cut cost. Essentially, if it's international and not shipped using a priority method they will all leave it sitting until it's convenient. 

It sucks as that attitude is responsible for hundreds of small businesses going out of business. When the business is gone the shipping companies make less money and then treat non priority shipments even worse, causing more businesses to fail. 

Sad and unfixable, assuming no new methods if inexpensive fast shipping, as shipping companies in the whole give less than a shit about anything it her than profit margin.

I think that doesn‚Äôt make so much sense.
I sent 4 packets on the same day in the beginning of November. 3 of them to USA.
Same day, same post office. Two arrived after 1,5weeks, the last one still on the way...
So even if you sent things early you never know what happens on the way.
If you want to make sure your santee has the present in time you need to set the deadline to October or don‚Äôt include international people.
Both are not the best options.

I think October is fine to start as it seems like most of the not received gifts are international.  Maybe next year we can set up international with international cause it really seems like the issue is come from or going to a international county from the USA. Or maybe people from neighboring countries paired together. It sucks that it is so hard to ship stuff international because the cheapest way for international is non priority but then you just hoping it gets there before Christmas.

what¬¥s for you international?
for me international is different than for you.
and i need to say i¬¥m a bit against that idea that US only stays in the US and the rest of the world should sent to each other.
You can always decide if you ready to ship worldwide or not.
But maybe it makes sense also to just pair people which ready to ship world wide (not sure if you did so already this year @Grozniy)
So if people sign up for worldwide they also should expact to get the present later than otheres.
And in general, where is the problem to receive things after christmas?
I mean, for example our christmas is anyhow first in january...
and if you get the present already in november, or only in january totally doesn¬¥t make a difference.
to move the start to october will just move the presents to come more early and take away peoples opportunity to use the black friday to order some presents for there santee.

@Grozniy did that this year were people who wanted to ship world wide were put in with others world wide.  When I said start in October I was meaning the whole Secret Santa process like it did this year.  Where October is for saying you want to join then November you are give the name. I don't mind if stuff comes after Christmas but others have seem like they would like it before and I'm just throwing out ideas to speed up the process.  We cant say that if you are shipping it international then you have to do priority because then that adds to the cost of shipping and depending on what it is it could be become very expensive  

I had someone contact me about the bearings I sent out b264 and the cheapest international available right from the  manufacture was $99 for international UPS.

I refuse to ship or receive outside eu .... 
Shipping is hella expensive,easily above 30‚Ç¨ that leaves very few money for a good gift.
Receive is even worse . Customs office will hold my box and make me pay for stuff i might not need. 
At least in my case internacional is not a choice

That‚Äòs your good right and totally understandable.
Just don‚Äôt like the idea that we fix this decision from the beginning.
For me for example it‚Äôs not an issue at all to ship worldwide and I also don‚Äôt mind to pay for things I maybe don‚Äôt need.

@briman05 you've lost the spirit friend.

When gifts arrive doesn't matter, worried about shipping costs? Buy something in the country and ship it locally, or give something small and light from your stocks. None of that matters. It's about giving what you can and participating in the community.

Splitting the community into one nation vs 191 nations is not a solution in any community spirit. The world is big.

First up just let me say this is just how I see it.
I respect everybody's opinion. WE are all in different situations..economically physically.

I think the timing eg: Oct decide...Nov do it. Is perfect.
You will never be able stop random events that cause fuckups.

Yes I new it was going to be expensive to send, insurance etc
I felt I was representing....me...my country....this community the spirit of Christmas.
I actually ended up spending nearly 4 x what I said I would...lol

I'm not wealthy..far from it.
I got one hell of a kick out of sending something that hurt a little bit to give.
But I felt really good about it...and I know it was appreciated.

Weird how candy is not worldwide. I grew up with Maltesers living in Hong Kong and London. When the family settled in the US I got that Whopper crap. 

Maltesers finally made it to the US this past year after being here for 30 years. Last few times of travel I brought back a few sacks of those balls![image|375x500](upload://oxwZqQJTHTGcGjeZ1WoYaj9bRty.jpeg)

I have to side with with @Skunk on this I think @Grozniy did a truly great job this year and has set the bar high but even though he did participate this year it was only because there was a person how backed out.  I know there are still a few people who did not get a gift but I dont think it is because someone did not send it and it is more of a postal service fuck up.  I have offered and so has Skunk to take the reigns with the 2019 Secret Santa as it shouldn't become a job for someone to do each year.

I knew it was a joke I was just saying that I agreed with @Skunk that it should be a new person taking the lead.  I should have said agreed not sided so my mistake.  I am actually very organized when it comes to stuff like this.  You don't have to be an ass hat about it.

If @Grozniy has a tracking number for you that would be great or at least maybe your santa can provide a picture of the receipt if they still have it.  I would hope that they would have been able to send it out by now unless they just got there package and said screw my santee which isn't right.  Once we get into February maybe we can talk about this because I know of atleast 2 people who dont have a gift but atleast one seems like there is in transit.  Maybe we can see when you santee was last active and they havent been active since we blacklist them from future secret santas.

The sad thing is that there will always be people trying to scam people who are good hearted people.  I have talked to @Grozniy about increasing the minimum and try to make it better for the people who have been in it in the past because I know @skunk has sent out gifts to people who were butt hurt about what they got and that isn't right.  Everyone comes from different financial backgrounds and age ranges people need to be happy with what the get because it isn't about sending a $10 part and hoping to get a $100 item its about sending someone something that they may need to finish a build or to start a future build.

Idk how it is in Belgium but in Germany and in Russia you can ask for a special search request.
You need to fill out a form and give some information and they will look explicit after your parcel. If you have information where the parcel was scanned last time it shouldn‚Äôt be an issue to find it.

Believe me, you do not want to know how retarded the people of the Belgian post are. They constantly put the work down, the post office is monthly for unexpected things. 

I'll give them a call back tomorrow, and the next day and that day after... I know it was the last time in the brussels depot... So they can search behind it until they find it...

If you really paid for the missing presents by your own than it is not right at all!
If mine is not shipped yet, take it back please.
If it¬¥s shipped I will refund you or spend the value of my present for the next year bowl of missing presents.

It shouldn¬¥t be your task to stand for lost packets or people that just didn¬¥t fullfill there part in the SS game....

There should be some money left over in the collection for your gift @mmaner should be able to say how much but you should atleast get money you put out finishing it up.

Glad you liked it Andreas.  I'm pleased to say that I'm happy and proud of everyone that participated and sent awesome gifts. AFAIK only one person didn't get the gift and I hope this year everyone will get one.

Ride hard and stay safe
