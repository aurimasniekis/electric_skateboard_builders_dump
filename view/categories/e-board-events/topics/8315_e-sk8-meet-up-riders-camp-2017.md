Hey guys.

So @Michaelinvegas made a thread about starting more groupe rides and in general start the conversation. That got me thinking and so I am now starting that conversation. Everything with big "if's" and "maybys" but you got to start somewhere.

So the Idea would be the following. We find a week in spring/summer 2017 where poeple would like to make a trip and ride with other poeple. So basically what I am proposing is the following: 

Would poeple be intrested for a riders camp in switzerland ?
Beatiful locations , we can visit almost all of switzerland in a week, beatiful rides etc. What I could offer in terms of budget care is offer the place to stay. Depends on how many we end up being we would either stay in Zürich or Bern.
Mayby it sounds far fetched for the most of you, but I used to go anually to sweden and danmark for freeride/downhill events. Switzerland is also just an idea, but would be cool if we had a set week that could become tradition for an international meet up in Europe. I mean bikers, cyclists, skaters and even beatboxer have them so why not the esk8 community in europe ? (In the offchance that someone flys over the pond, they are ofcourse welcome as well :slight_smile:) 

Is there intrest for that sort of thing ?

Great idea! 

People,  don't focus on the obstacles.  

Focus on the positives.  Police? Let's either find a place where they don't care or legalise the event or dodge them. 
Battery on planes? I heard there is a guy in the US that builds custom packs.  Maybe he has a good solution...  :innocent: 

Is there interest? 

What would interest you?

There are so many private places or military training grounds that are open to the public if you are really scared about the police. But im asking in generall is the interest ?

Wrong statement @longhairedboy 

Sell some boards to European people and deliver your boards personally.  Save on the shipping.  

Play some gigs while you are over.  

That should pay your trip.

Just an idea....


If there was some sort of way to borrow or rent batteries in different cities.... Crazy idea but would solve the traveling on a plane with it....

Hobby stores? RC clubs or associations?  What do you think? Could you reach out to these people and see what could be worked out?

No lie, I would totally be willing to meet up in the US. Like a huge meet up. I would load up my car and drive. 

It would most likely be in California which is super far from Chicago but I'd still be down

@Michaelinvegas,  that's the spirit! 
@barajabali -  I know! Was just teasing you. Start developing fly ready battery packs and they might fund your trip..

Play gigs,  deliver boards and keep the shipping costs to pay for the tickets.  The rest must come from the presumably huge marketing budget.  

In honesty,  I fully understand your concerns,  having family as well.  We are burning enough money already with our stupid hobby.  

Just trying to promote a "yes we can do"  attitude.

if there was a small powerful charger it'd be nice to travel across the country by board using backroads stopping in coffee shops to charge and hotels or hostels to sleep.  If i had money and time.

some of us are meeting sunday in san francisco in golden gate park

Yeah but I could actually put together an event out here in Vegas, sorta like a convention...I still got plenty of friends in Hotel Conventions....

And I can take you guys for a little tour that really no one aside from a few people have done...

https://youtu.be/Fewd3fPczUk

It depends on the groups response to this.....

The bigger the group the better I think I can make it

Doesn't CES feature all the latest in personal electric vehicles? I've only been to NAB but I could see similarities in that you have the big mega booths with name brands then other areas that are a mixture of DIY, overseas companies and US based booths. I hardly ever hang out at the Canon, Panasonic, etc. booths because its fun to tool around and mix it up with the smaller vendors.
