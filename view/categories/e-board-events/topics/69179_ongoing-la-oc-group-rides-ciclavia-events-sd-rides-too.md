EDIT: Since CicLAvia has events multiple times a year. I decided to just updated the thread title to the next one. 

Upcoming event will be on December 2nd 2018 - If I remember, I'll post the meet up place that the BoostedLA group decides on.

Planning to!

@joeadams101 and @LEVer said he would come too. But if the past taught me anything, they will be late to whatever time is set and my board will have issues :joy:  Gonna have the InBoard as well just in case that happens again.

Boosted Riders are planning to meet up at 9AM at [Philz Coffee - DTLA] Is that the plan for you as well?

This weekend? Im in mike if you are since me and my couple buddies made it down to venice to late for the raptor event two weekends ago. I just hope my extra R2 battery or my new R2 comes before then but it's not looking good at this point even though they said both would for sure 110% ship this week! I can use a buddies board though worst case.

You can ride a push board, but prob wont be able to keep up with the Boosted group.  And with the boosted group, it isnt just boosted boards, all boards are welcome.  It will be cool to see all the custom boards.

going from downtown to hollywood will be rough without an esk8, it's largely uphill at a low grade.

now, returning from hollywood to downtown, that'll be fun because gravity.

one could, possibly, take the subway from downtown to hollywood then just ride down.

i'll do my best, i'm going to take off when my friends arrive since they'll be riding my boards.

in terms of parking, there's paid parking lots dotted all over downtown.

and street parking should be free everywhere on sunday, but can be difficult to find especially with this event going off.

i'd recommend just driving around, find street parking even if it's far away, and just ride to philz.

Hey guys, Ciclavia is this Sunday December 2, 2018. Let's meet at the same place as last time since there's a cheap parking lot diagonally across the street, intersection of 7th and Hope St looks to be at the beginning of the route (map on first post). Meet at 9AM, roll out at 9:30AM?

Boys and Grills ! ..slight off topic. I badly want to go as well..but is there anyone in LA who could help me out switching 4 dead cells in one of my packs ? My whole setup just died because of those bad cells. @psychotiller or anyone who could help ...any chance to buy spare 4 x LG HG2 from you and use your spot welder for a second ? I suck shit at electronics or soldering but I could probably use @Titoxd10001 soldering iron to finish it off.

Looks like I can't edit the original post any more. I just updated the thread name to the next one. Maps isn't out yet but it's gonna be in Culver City on March 3rd. Hopefully it would be more or a straight route instead of this zigzag we had.

@Michaelinvegas said he'll be down in SoCal sometime this month who wants to plan for a ride on that weekend?

in the summer when the dodgers are playing, they shut that whole route down to prevent stadium parking but accessible to people.  so we can hit that up without worrying about traffic.

@DEEIF   You plan one. Decide on a good safe route 10-15 miles (with a place to stop and charge if more) and post it in THIS thread.

Everyone who can travel within the LA/OC and SD area should be following this thread

Who’s up for a SD group ride?
@Bobby @PatRocks @RedBaron @Arzamenable @Boardnamics

A few months back, me and @Bobby went on a group ride with the evolve crew and it was fun until my boosted ran out of charge. Paradise point got food and got a spot where we can all charge our boards. The ride is 12 miles on total and 6 miles 1 way. What do you guys think?

I WILL, however, throw any evolve marked items into the fucking Pacific ocean if they make a scooter.
