I've been seeing all these people lookin for meet ups but it seems that everybody in CA is down south (water stealers! :laughing:). Is anybody farther inland of the Bay Area like Pleasanton, Dublin, or within 20 min? If so, let's cruise b4 Summer is over ðŸ˜Ž

I'm in Rohnert Park, near Santa Rosa. So close to the rest of the bay area, but just far enough enough away that I almost never leave Sonoma county.
