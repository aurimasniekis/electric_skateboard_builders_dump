So I'm walking my kid around town in the pram so my wife can get some shuteye. He's sleeping now so I can catch up on mail etc! So all the roads I would ride close to me are totally empty so early on a Sunday - and the thought hit me, why not do a breakfast run on proper tarmac (not the bloody pavement which you need big wheels for)??

Anyone doing that already?

Anyone in London up for a Sunday morning meetup and a proper run?

I've got no idea. Could start with Hyde Park, or could find some roads that are a bit more adventurous. 

@RunPlayBack has some cool videos of him in parking garages - that could be cool if we can find one big enough - slalom & heats!

I wanna cruise and get enough straight for some speed, and get to know folks!

How about you guys?

Yup parking garages are fun, usually empty industrial office spaces on weekends are good. The best one by me has security patrol on weekends unfortunately :(
