**EDIT: It‚Äôs showing that it will be 101F on Saturday. Jerry and I are changing the time to 5:00pm!!!**



A few of us are planning to ride on July 7th starting at the "Shady Canyon Trail Parking in Irvine" Just look that up on Google Maps. It's right off the 405/Sand Canyon exit. Plan is to meet up after lunch time at around 5:00pm and head out by 5:30pm there are three parking area close to the start of the trail so circle out and park in the other lots if necessary. 

This city is filled with awesome trails to be discovered. I mapped out this trail (the bottom red line) which is only about 4 miles long, but I looped it around and found a few smaller trails that eventually loops back. From start to finish it's just a hair under 10 miles, there are some dirt pathways parallel to the cement for those who are into that.

Who's down to join?!
@DevoCut @LEVer @Exiledd_Top @Titoxd10001 @psychotiller @mccloed @thisguyhere @chris.hunt @anorak234  who else is from SoCal?

Checked out the trail this morning. Noticed motor issue after 4 miles and had to turn back. Hopefully get this fixed before the next ride.

It was awesome riding with everyone! üòé The route / trail was beautiful too.

Looking forward to making my way out to Irvine again soon! Hopefully next time with my Arc Aileron V2 instead of the Ownboard. ü§ì

Niiiiiice! Ok, sweet deal, thanks for the heads up! I Will definitely plan on coming out tomorrow then. Where is everyone meeting at again just so I know? I was already planning to go for a ride so I wanted to make sure it‚Äôs ok to bring a few peeps to add to the group? I ride daily but this will be my first group ride so please let me know if there is anything I want to make sure that I bring with me tomorrow or just my typical riding things.....? Thanks again in advance and can't wait to meet and ride with everyone tomorrow!

In my books there are no limitation on who is ‚Äúallowed‚Äù in group rides that are posted. The more the merrier. Just bring helmet, water and charger, fast charger if you got one. 

Joe and his crew from SD/Oceanside are Evolve riders so might go for a second ride after if their battery is still good
