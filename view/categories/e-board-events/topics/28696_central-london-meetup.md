anyone interested in a Central London meetup and group ride?

there are a few UK based riders in the uk-esk8 facebook group that will most likely be up for it, given enough notice and subject to wife/family approval.

please reply to this topic if you are potentially interested, if there is enough interest i will sort out a date and location
