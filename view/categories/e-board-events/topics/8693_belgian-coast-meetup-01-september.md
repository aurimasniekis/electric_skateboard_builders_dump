As I live in Germany, the next coast is located a three hour drive west to Ostende, Belgium. So two friends and I will be heading there tomorrow morning, 01.09. with our longboards (mine is the only esk8, so i´ll be towing the other two :monkey:).
We´ll be staying there till friday afternoon and we´ll simply camping there a litte bit southwards in the dunes of Ostende.

So if any of you belgian people are interested of skat´n a bit at the beautiful coast there, we´ll be happy to meetup!!

Anyone up?
:monkey:

I live just a couple of hours away from the belgian coast, but My esk8 is probably only going to get finished in a week or so, so I don't have a ridable longboard atm either, I hope you have a lot of fun and I'll try to join you if you come to belgium again :)

Sorry buddy, would've loved to join. Unfortunately I've gotta work ;-)
@all Belgians replying here, we've started up a facebook group, if you're on there, send me a PM so we can add you.
