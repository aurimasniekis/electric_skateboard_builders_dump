Guess what? 

I'll be in San Diego next week!  Last minute change from A Texas trip.

Let's ride! Talked with Eric at Shredlights and we're gonna do an evening group ride! On Thursday at 9pm and tentatively is gonna be in the Gas Lamp...if that changes I'll post up here.

It's been abt two years since I last rode in downtown SD...it should be fun.
