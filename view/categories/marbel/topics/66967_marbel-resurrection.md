How do you like it with the vesc? I always like the deck but components lacked

```
so I just got the Vesc and just learned how to get it working but I still need to figure out how to fine tune it... like soften the brakes and increase the top speed. 

any help pointing me in that direction here would be awesome. 

I miss the Marbel remote they really did a fine Job with it .
I may be able to install a nano remote inside the Marbel slider  remote I think it is only 3 wires to swap the roller to the slider .

I'm stoked about it

Idk. 
I think when he said " how did you do that "
He like myself thought the pack broke itself open like that.

Oh no , I think I still need to play with the regen settings or something because the power crashed going down hill and the battery pack was mad hot . It seems to be charging ok now but I had to open it up and investigate.

Ha !

Agreed. I’m almost ready to start building my own packs. 

I looked up that cell number and found nothing. I wouldn’t be surprised to find a AAA battery stuffed inside these bootleg cells
