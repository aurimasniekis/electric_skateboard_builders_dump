If I recall, it's 2:1 (30:15)

Marbel is 30:12

I got the gear to fit but I still need to slice about 10 mm off the inside of the wheel so the belt  doesn't rub. then it will fit the Marbel and my Carbon GT. I need to circumcise these wheels. Just a little off the tip.   L'chaim!!

Anyone have some ideas on how best to do this? I may try a belt sander before calling my friends rabbi.

What do you mean DIY has them?

The gear won't fit the wheel with a spacer and/or the axel is not long enough.

Belt sander will cause heat and start to melt the neoprene. 
Use a coarse belt and grind only for 1-2 seconds at a time letting it cool between and rotate the wheel 1/4 turn each pass. And don't push the wheel down on the belt. Let the weight of the wheel do the work. Good luck

I haven't personally tried it so take the suggestion with a grain of salt.

You could try spinning the wheel with the motor and using a wood plane to remove the urethane evenly.

Dude,I have a planer and I just so happen to have an electric planer too. Never thought of that .  Thanks . Do you have an example of someone who has used a plane on urethane? 

I have seen people use a belt sander. 
Maybe I will use both.

Wear a respirator if you decide to use a belt grinder.  Urethane dust is nasty, and you don't want to be inhaling it

I would try to cut the wheel first.  Grinding down urethane never seems to go as smoothly as you'd think

 Brilliant idea to use a plane!!!

I used an electric plane and it worked like a charm.... and it fits the carbon GT too.  Thanks

They are caliber clones I think that Marbel modified to fit their mount bracket. These monsters fit like regular flywheels but the inside thane is too thick so I had to shave it down. I put it on the front evolve truck and used it as a spindal to hold and spin it while I shave it down little by little .

Awesome job!  How much did you have to shave off, can you post a closeup if the reduced one next to regular one for comparison?  Thanks!

Looks like it had to be planed down past the inside bevel, but only by 2-3mm more?

You actually don't have to cut it as narrow as the 97 mm wheels. I eyeballed it and stopped shaving it down when it fit. I love the Marbel more than before. higher top speed and smoother ride. It roles over everything. I may cut out the beveled area on the other wheels too since it is not making contact with the road and serves no purpose , adds weight and makes the wheels wider than they need to be causing wheel bite. Its a waste of thane if it is not on the contact patch.

How clean does that cut look!?

I guess you've to change gear ratio to get decent torque for hills? like 40t+ wheels pulley

Not really. The board still has enough torque for NYC since it was designed to have 100mm wheels  and has an app to customize torque and acceleration. This board is made to be very light and with a 195wh battery good for A-B rides, not a torque monster. Maybe a bigger gear (40t) would be better for this wheel but I am not crazy about the added wheel weight. i think the 97mm wheels may better suit this board.  I need some time to appreciate the nuances to see what i like best. I am going to cut off the bevel on the other two wheels to reduce weight and even them out.

I settled on 44T wheel pulleys for my 107mm build, and 15T pulleys on two 6374 motors diagonal on 12s. When I get an enclosure I can do some real performance testing in NYC streets.

I Liked my GT on 97mm and also fitted 100mm MBS ATLB off-road wheels onto evolve which were interesting. Have not been able to get the 107mm onto Evolve GT though, need to find a way to get those cut down like yours but don't have access to an electric planet or anything like that lol!  I do have sets of 107mm wheel pulleys for 48T, 50T and 56T 3D printed if you are in NYC and wanted to try a higher gearing ratio.

I would be happy to cut your 107s for you and I would love to try a bigger drive gear. If you'd like, send them to me (to Queens) with return postage and I'll slice those bad boys down for you.  You have been very helpful and welcoming to the new guy. I'd be happy to hook you up. I still have to cut the other two so I can get it done while i'm at it. 

In regards to the Flywheel gear, Thanks! Now that this 107 is the same thickness as the 97 flywheel  I need one gear that fits the 97mm wheel profile, and is 15mm wide.  Which number of teeth worked best for you with the 107mm wheel?  Marbel is 30:12 for the 76mm wheel.  I guess I also need a back retainer and screws. Do the 3D prints hold up? how wide are yours. What are they made of, ABS? Maybe you can steer me in the right direction.

On thiniverse  what is the difference between the "thick" one and the regular one? I think I would have  to use the bolt on option if i don't have much axle length for the enertion type gears that hold a bearing. Isn't there an aluminum CNC'd option

Sorry for slow response, on the road this week until Friday.  Appreciate your generous offer to cut down my 107s to workable size like yours.  I would like to take you up on that offer.  Regarding flywheel gear, I have an embarrassing large number and range of pulleys made, in various #T & 9-15mm width, PLS & ABS, in 80-100% infill, 100-200 micron layer, etc. I can take a look at what I have, and would recommend and send what you want, once I get back to NYC later this week.  Thinking ahead, with cutback 107mm wheels the MBS thick spoke/retainer version 15mm makes most sense.  I have had best experience with 44T on 97-100mm, stock motor pulley so far but let me look at what I have to confirm.  Yes the bolt on retainer is way to go, rather than peel back hanger another bearing width <g>.

No worries.  I sent you my  home address.

The Marbel uses a 225 belt and my GT uses a 250mm belt. I think the GT is a ~32-36t (please correct me if wrong) so a good ballpark number for a 40 -50 t should be around 260-275??? Maybe you could point me in the right direction. 

How do I determine which length belt to get if I upgrade the wheel gear for the 107s? It would be cool to continue using the 250 (GT)belt for both boards and get the correct gear to accommodate that. I fitted the 97 mm flywheels with no significant torque loss for my needs.  I just wonder if there is a way to Measure it accurately

Note to all New Yorkers trying to modify their 107's: 

Prior to discovering the electric plainer option to slim the 107's down I was considering catching the Staten Island ferry to visit a Maker Space in SI, just a few blocks from the ferry terminal, to use their Lathe or Sander  or other, to get the job done.  They also have a 3D shop. The place is worth a visit and still on my list.

here it is:

That pic looks familiar!  

Cool you got this working, but i'll stick to max 97's until they provide the 100mm (eventually?!?).
