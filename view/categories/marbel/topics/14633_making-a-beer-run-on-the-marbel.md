I just made this account to say that this is basically the reason i built a board. The guy at the gas station thought the board was the coolest thing he'd seen in years. Unfortunately my board got run over on one such run! :( When i get the money to buy a new deck, trucks and wheels, ill post pictures of my next run. Here's to good beer, and better boards!
