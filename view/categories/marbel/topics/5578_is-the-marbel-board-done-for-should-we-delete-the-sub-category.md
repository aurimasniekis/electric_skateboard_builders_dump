# Is the Marbel board done for? Should we delete the sub-category?

I have noticed in the last couple of weeks that:
1. The Marbel board has gotten less and less attention
2. Marbel in general seems to have failed miserably

The Marbel board was a great idea, but it seems to be that the product itself has fallen short. I have now read/seen several reviews online involving just how bad the Marbel board really is. For example: 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/69960e0c44a83a6ac9120b4b9b6586a04e1959d6.png" width="281" height="500">

Also, I have noticed that no other topics have been placed in this category at all, and therefore would like to request that this specific sub-category be deleted and that the few Marbel topics that may exist in the future be placed in the 'others' sub-category, given that the community agrees. Is anyone against it?

Ride mine all the time as well.  Working really well.  Can't wait for the app and 100mm wheels next...

I've had a couple issues, but they sent me return label and turnaround was 1-2 days once received.  So about 2-2.5 weeks before i could ride again.

To get 10-12 miles and only weigh 10lbs...  just can't beat it.  I love my buddies boosted dual+, but it's heavy in comparison, and i only get 4-5miles on it (not even in top performance mode).  love the smoother ride (softer wheels and flex of deck really is awesome), and dual motor just dusts the marbel on acceleration... but FOUR MILES!!!  :(

Like others i'm really frustrated by the lack of communication and updates from Marbel, but they do make a great and unique offering to the e-board market.  The new v2 Dual+ from boosted - if they can get weight down and increase mileage - that might be the Marbel killer...

Yeah, i've got two small annoying issues - so thinking i might send it back, fix and ask them to swap to my 100mm wheels (even without app). update firmware etc.

the belt has rubbed on the belt guard - no issue yet, but it will break (and i can replace it - no biggie), and the guard slightly rubs on the inside of the wheel.  Again - annoying, but don't' want to lose my board for a couple weeks when it's finally nice weather to ride!  I need to finish my 2 other builds and then i can spare it.  need 2 eboards so GF and i can ride in the evening and relax after work!

I spoke with Misti and am getting the "any day now" response - so your guess on the release dates.  Frustrating.  If it didn't run so well otherwise i'd be seriously pissed.  but again - 10-12mi and 10lbs...

 What I love most around here is the obvious bias title for Marbel and even the GT.   I understand that this is the Enertion site but **if** there is a Marbel section then shouldn't it be inviting constructive discussion rather than promote dislike and intimidate Marbel owners?  Just a thought.  

Are there really no other Marbel owners around here?

I don't think anyone was bias against Marbel in the beginning but after a few months it became clear that the product didn't live up to expectations and every review I found online said it has serious quality issues. The only reasons that I want to remove the Marbel subcategory is because nobody has ever posted on here, and I don't think that the creators of Marbel will be in business long enough to fix issues in a new model

 I think there intention was to make a dual eventually because there is enough room in the board for more batteries and another motor it should be easy for them once established and get the app out  this industry is blowing up. 

 If I could let you go for a ride on it you wouldn't say that.  The board is no joke. 

I am not a wordsmith but if you have any questions about my marbel I would be happy to answer.
What do you want to know?

   Which other board has caused such a tremendous stir? Of course there is interest.  The board has been highly anticipated and created huge expectations. Even with all the new boards that have come none have caused as much debate as the Marbel because of its balanced combination of three reasons. Range weight and speed or else no one would have been talking about it so much.  There is no section here on the Bolt or even half dozen chinese brand that are going to give boosted a run for their money in a few years. 

Marbel was just a balls and a speculation pick. Bad press wouldn't stop a juggernaught industry like this.  You can put a rubber band propellor on a an old Nash and sell it for a thousand bucks.  I can't believe I just said Nash... I'm  old! It just took a little balls. I don't think the chinese boards will fail before they figure it out either, to be honest. And they don't even have online storefronts that are spell checked. I wish more american companies with big balls would pot up and give it a go. 

It seems that Marbel has big balls. I like big balls and people like big balls. 
It seems that even upper-class society thinks that Marbel was "god's gift to ballroom notoriety. I always fill my ballroom the events are never small. the social pages said they had the biggest balls of all."

I just need  those 100mm wheels.


Has anyone here ever owned a Nash?

the problem with marbel is that they suck at communicating what the hell is going on and they fail to deliver. I actually had a marbel order at one point but got it refunded after a couple weeks of having no idea what the status of my order was, and reading lots of bad reviews on the people who did get their board.

I know that was nuts!  Forgive me to say that I think cooler heads prevailed in the end anyway.

Don't you see what happened now in retrospect?

Crowd funding can be tricky but the hysteria when they started shipping was partially fueled by social media and all the competitor influence. The "tail is waging the dog" on this enertion forum too.  It was addicting like a reality show. I had to check in everyday to read the blogs. Honestly Misti musT be a ninja to take all those hits. Customer service jobs must suck!

When the hysteria hit, it was too easy to be mad or scared so it blew up. This young demographic was particularly impatient for a crowd funding venture like a new electric skateboard to hit the market with out all the heavy stuff under it as it was known for .
 I kind of compare the Marbel hysteria to a "run on the bank".
If you don't remember what that is, Remember in the old christmas movie "Its a wonderful life"  when the town caught wind that the bank was struggling it caused big fear and everyone in town went to the bank to pull out their life savings. Naturally they were scared but if you pulled out too soon old man Potter  would get your deposits and then you would really be screwed with no safety net. Well that is literally what happened. So they slowed down and personally handled each case one by one. I never lost communication even though Misti would tease me more than a prom date. 

The name of the game for happiness as a rider is competition, the more the better. Literally everyone has a shot at the title in this sport. 

Here is a short clip of the movie scene classic that helps explain what I think happened with Marbel as they had to explain your investment.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPkJH6BT7dM


Now old man Potter's got your money.
I guess at this stage of my life I expect delays because that is life as I realize it.

 I had to send it back a couple of times but it is so good that I was just pissed it took two weeks to get back. 

Just give me those 100 milly wheels.

i should have signed up here sooner. :)

I'm sorry I meant "which other NEW board companies have caused such tremendous stir" for their release.
Trying to establish yourself as an american based manufacturing contender was a big deal. Still is.

Experience means everything in this infant market. I think that is why Boosted has focused on perfecting their original model.  The V2 only needs to be headache proof to corner the market while everyone else creatively catches up to the "Ford Model T" (the boosted of its time)

I'm guessing they learned a lot from marbel's case and this is why they are taking very carefull steps and have had delays.
But they hype on the M1 is still quite big

Thats how it was for marbel with the first couple of months of delays until they started shipping .  As you know it got old but it desn't mean it will fail. The test for inboard will be when they release their product.

There were aspects of my Marbel that I liked but I finally sold it and moved on. 

I had the BMS and pack completely die. Had to replace some other electronics. 

FYI, I figured out right before I sold it that they used 44 degree base plates with 50 degree hangers which is why it is impossible to get the bushings to sit flush.

I switched the front to 50 degree calibers but then they wheel bite with 97mm abec flywheels which worked on their Frankenstein combo. I believe this is the reason that the board is less stable at high speeds than other reverse kingpin trucks I have used at similar speeds.

Nice what did you get when you sold it? 
By the way how do you know it was a BMS that died if you can not open the board. 

I got it last August I had to send it back a **bunch** of times the first few months. It wasn't too bad though no problems lately. I would usually be back on the board the next week and they extended my warranty 6 month. I just want the app and wheels now but this time it is supposed to be coming upgraded with some new "never seen" features they want me to try out. 

I think I got the carbon GT arriving next week. Cant wait, but honestly I still think I will probably be grabbing the Marbel more for quick errands and commuting because it is just so practical. It fits in my locker at the gym is a lot easier to carry. The remote slips in my back pocket and i don't worry about sitting on it. The weight makes it as practical as a regular 38" longboard and its about the same top speed as the GT. But I am stoked to try the GT torque and sidewinders for long weekend rides down to the beach.

I heard about the trucks. I still need to take a look at them but I haven't noticed a thing. I got the trucks dialed in at this point.

Nice summary.  I just sent my Marbel in for it's second service/issue.  I had the power button fail on me for the first issue, and it's been great since then.  The belt rub was annoying, but waited to send it back for that.

I was riding w/ a meetup group and the front motor pulley came loose (luckily on the flats).  Looks like 2 grub screws hold it, one is missing, and the other partially stripped out (slowly - lots of warning).  So back it goes for 2nd trip to Marbel and added teh belt rub item to fix at the same time.

They already extended my warranty 6 months, so i'm pretty happy still.  Annoying - yes.  Could i fix it myself - sure.  But with the belt issue i figured i'd have them do it all at the same time on their dime.  I waited until this fall when riding weather is less frequent (PNW = rain).  If it takes a week to get there (Lipo=ground shipping), i'm in no rush now at least.

@eboostin- i asked for them to swap to the *ever pending* 100mm wheels, but doubt they will.  Would love to hear more about the 97mm flywheel swap - one of my favorite wheels!

@Lebram - how is the app doing?  i'm waiting to be included on Android - haven't been contacted yet to test.  

Still love what the Marbel does - rides great, only weighs 10lbs, has substantial power even with only one motor.  A great package overall.  Stealth and the issues i've had have been pretty minor so far.  Still a fan.  Especially love the modes and ability to hand to someone in a beginner mode.  My biggest want with DIY boards and VESC.

I just took the motor cover off. They grind down a little more of the belt cover and it doesn't rub but i keep it off so rocks don't get in there . it isn't really necessary.

I didnt get the beta app yet. 
Doesn't some one make a gear that could fit and hold the ABEC flywheel?

It's not too hard to do. I put Kegels and Flywheels on my board. 

All you have to do is make the slots in the wheel bearing opening for the Marbel drive gear. I think the Kegels fit the personality and gearing of the Marbel better.

The Flywheels worked great too but raised the board up quite a bit and in turn lost some of the low, sleek look of the marbel.

The stock blue wheels don't seem to be very high quality.

I had not thought of doing it myself. That's awesome. How do you make the slots? What tools ? Can I do it to some 97mm flywheels? I'll do it tomorrow if you show me how. Did you order an extra wheel pully or use the same one? mine seems to be stuck In there pretty good. You just made my day. Thanks 

any chance you can make an instructional video? I think a lot of Marbel riders would love to know about this .

He said he sold his board, so doubt he will have the gear to show us.  I did look at some different wheels that have that standard'ish shape to the core of the wheel.  I actually have a spare marbel wheel gear (for faster swaps if i ever get the 100mm wheels!).  Might have to go look again.

Last time they repaired it and had it back in the mail in 2 days.  Slow ground shipping it won't get to them until at least the 11th... (holiday delayed it shipping out), so we'll see how quick it is this time.

The way I did it was to insert the Marbel drive gear in the wheel as far as it could go. Then I found a socket that was about the diameter of the bearing hole. So the stack goes, wheel, marbel gear, socket, then brass punch. If you have a large enough brass punch, you don't need the socket. 

Give the stack a couple good hits which will indent the plastic center so you know where to remove material. Remove material. A sharp knife, chisel, dremel, file etc works well. Once the material is removed, insert your drive gear and you are good to go. 

To remove the drive gear from the original Marbel wheel, use a brass punch or socket. Put the drive wheel on two pieces of wood or you can use two other wheels, then give the drive gear a few taps from the front and it will pop out the back.

The one bad thing about the wheel gear is that it has low teeth count (30) and is aluminum. I found that it transferred a lot of heat to the inside wheel bearing. 

Before I sold the board, I contemplated getting a set of Caliber II trucks, an Evolve 32T wheel pulley and new belt. 

This would have fixed the mix matched hangers and base plates as well as the bearing heat issue.

I have the evolve GT gear too but it is too long to fit the Marbel axle as is. The  Axel is not long enough. Is it the same as the rest of the gears that evolve offers for older models?

Did you have any problem getting the gear back on the original wheel? 

 I guess I'm just concerned about cutting the notches wrong but I always have 3 more wheels to try again. what tool did you use? I have a Roto zip that should work along with a chisel. What tools did you use?

No issues going back to the original wheels.

Like I said, give it a few taps in the new wheel and it will make the marks in the plastic of where you need to remove material.

Take your time and you'll be fine

The flywheels are smoother. I have 81A and they're great.

Great . Honestly, a simple ruler would work I don't want to pop out the gear if I can order the correct chisel size first,  I already have the flywheels. They make  specific size chisels . So thanks.

 I can notch it like eboostin described.  And make a clean-cut with the right size tool for a couple of bucks

I'm thinking one of these two. I measured it with a ruler and it appears to be 6mm.

I realized the wheel hub plastic is much too hard to chisel it with big clean cuts.  I was afraid it would be too brittle.  The Roto zip worked like a charm!  This may be the third time I ever use that thing but it's basically the  Dremel . Once you get it close enough you can force the gear in there and when it sits flush it's perfect.   I see no reason to ever use the 76 mm wheels again unless I'm trying to power side 180° But I don't have those skills so.. 
The best part is knowing how easy it is to modify the wheels you like with this gear design. It's all about versatility. 
Thanks for the help and inspiration guys. This was exactly what i needed to make the board perfect.

I sent it back more times than that.  I was in the first batch of boards. They extending my warranty by six months and they have been good about getting it fixed at least.They have hooked me up with extra belts, bearings, charger and i haven't dropped an extra dollar since i bought it. They once Even sent me a new board before receiving the returned board.  I think they are waiting on a final part to get the latest boards out.  I hear lights are coming.

The boosted will be great when it has more range. The weight of the marbel and bigger wheels makes it hard for me not to appreciate.

Marbel has tried many belts you just got a bad belt. For a single drive it puts out a lot of torque. you just got unlucky.

Agree that boosted is a great board.  Just not mileage and weight.  New v2.0 much better range (with extended battery), but still pretty heavy.

Just got my Marbel back from 2nd return/repair.  first was a dead nose switch (think it was damaged in shipping maybe).  This last was the motor gear spun out the grub screws (one stripped).  They took care of a rubbing belt and new belt guard to prevent it rubbing again.  

Back on the road again!  I don't jump or really abuse the board, so can't comment on @Brando134's experience.  I'd ride something else if you want to beat the crap out of any board.  like a regular skateboard or longboard.  But that's just me.  This is a 10lb 12+ mile board - which i can't build myself.  Once the electronics fail and it's out of warranty i'm definitely thinking of dual motors and some fun w/ it though!

The same way you do it everywhere else. drag the photo into your message or upload the pic to imgur.com and post the link here.

You can start a new topic to discuss the other board brands. I just want to see the money shot of all your boards together.

Im dying to see what is inside. I think it will be very telling. 
Doesn't the motor shaft have a flat spot to keep the grub from slipping.

Is it a new belt cover? Is it a different size to accommodate the larger wheels? got a pic?

They extended my warranty for 6 months - so it'll be a minute longer...

I didn't remove it fully, so not sure.  I'm going to check the new one in the next few days (raining and can't ride anyway).

Belt cover looks identical - just has a bit better clearance so the belt doesn't rub.  not fancy.

hey guys, is the Marbel board really as bad as what I hear? I'm new and I've been researching this stuff and I thought the Marbel would be good, but I also saw that Acton is now coming out with the qu4tro and it looks pretty cool for like $400 less. what do you guys think?

You should look on quality rather than cool looking in first place, the new Acton is still in development and nobody knows if this will be any good. At this price point they have to cut some corners and that may end in low quality and/or performance.

Marbel seems to have gone from not delivering on orders to not taking orders for boards at all. I take that to mean it's discontinuing operations. Too bad they never got it together; it was a nice, light package.

maybe they are working on 2nd gen?

it better be a dual drive because $1400 for a single is crazy!

The Marbel is not for sale now as they prepare to reveal Gen 2 "soon". It will have lights more power and will be more refined. This industry is a marathon not a sprint to the finish.

Its also my understanding that remaining orders have been offered the updated board...and more.

 I would not have shipped it yet either but  Now it rolls well.

I really hope it is a dual too but their niche has been the trifecta of weight/ speed/ range  and I fear they will need to refine what they have before venturing onto the next step. Making it a dual will really compromise that holy trinity and I think its not in the cards yet. 


I suspect there is more space in that carbon deck to fit more batteries but even if they simply perfected **this** board it would still be competitive in this market... for now.

you a motivational speaker?

Is that how the saying goes? "If at first you don't succeed, then why don't you just give up"
They spent the last 3 years learning and fine tuning.
Everyones is getting the 2.0 now
A bigger 63mm motor more battery more range, more speed.  101mm wheels and now lights. 


Here is little vid I made on my original Marbel.

@Lebram My point was that waiting so long for a product even given its so new is unacceptable and also very unfair to the intial backers. Was asking what happened to 1.0. Dont they need to deliver that before calling a 2.0. Come on.

Everyone gets the 2.0 . I'm more impressed that they decided not to send out to international backers until it was perfect. There are too many companies now sending out half baked boards now. In the end that is all that matters.

I ordered the new marbel 2.0 board in January when it went on sale and still haven't received it. Tried emailing the company and calling for the last two months to see what's going on and never heard back from them. Any advice? Just file a dispute with my credit card company. Looks like this company is one big scam

This is a very common story.  People have had success getting a charge back thru PayPal or CC if you're within the 90 days or whatever policy.  If you are unable to get a refund - it's possible that you get a board eventually and will probably like it (if 2.0 fixes the design problems)
