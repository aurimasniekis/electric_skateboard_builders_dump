So I’ve been procrastinating this thread since I joined. Mostly because I wanted organize my thoughts to deliver the whole picture. I decided to just give the just of it because I need suggestions. What can I do?

It all started over 3 years ago. Boosted had just ended their initial Kickstarter and was taking preorders. I came across Marbel thatclaimed itbwas just behind boosted in their release date. So I decided to preorder a Marbel. Probably one of the first preorders after the Kickstarter campaign ended. I won’t even go into how many times we were lied to about when we would get our boards. Contact was ended after money was received and refund requests were ignored. Long story short, about 11 months after the date I was told, I received the long awaited Marbel 1.

Got on for my first electric skateboard ride and boom broken. A piece that was holding the motor in place fell off. Apparently this happened to almost everyone who received a board. This was before I knew how to fix issues, So under warranty it gets sent back. It takes over a month each time the Marbel has to go into the shop. Once I get it back about 5 min in and it breaks again, had to get shipped back across the USA to Florida. This happened 6 MORE times, only lasting a few minutes each time. This isn’t an exaggeration. After the 4th time they said they would not pay for return shipping and I had to pay the 100 bux round trip. After the 6th time they literally said “we know it’s under warranty, but at this tome we don’t know how to fix the problems you are experiencing, so we will not be repairing the board”. At this point I asked for my money back which resulted in over a year of ignoring my emails. 

I would send about 3 emails a week for over a year before receiving a response. Finally in October of last year, I get a response saying, we are making the generation 2 and if y I send in your broken gen 1, we will upgrade it to the gen 2 for free. 

Great right!? I can’t believe I fell for it. Once they received the board they cut all contact again. This was a year ago. In several emails I asked for my old broken model back so I can be done with this nightmare. The only response I ever got was simply “no”. 

So what can I do? If you read reddit there are hundreds of people that have tried letters from lawyers, and other legal action. The letters are ultimately ignored and to continue you’ll end up paying far more than the board was worth. Class action lawsuit? Well there’s been talk and it never happened, so until that seems likely I need another option. 

They are in Tampa, so if I wasn’t all the way in CA I would just go to their office and wait. At this point I’m at a loss.

Any ideas?

How did you pay them? Id say if it was through paypal or a credit card just claim the cash back and cut you losses.  sounds like they have done a runner

Claim what cash back?  Payment was made years ago.  There is nothing to claim back.

I know over here in the UK we have some power if we pay through a credit card.  quite literally you call up your credit supplier and you make a claim - some thing along the lines of "they took my thing a year ago and wont refund me" then if the credit company agrees with that they did something wrong, you get your cash back and the company that is in trouble now deals with your credit company

For paypal its simmilar but not the same, as paypal actually paid them, not you, you paid paypal to pay them (if that makes any sence) 

as im writing this @Chase just made a good point,  but if you can get a recent email saying pretty much anything, you can reopen the case (or atleast I beleive)

Edit: I actually know fuck all about how this stuff works, im just piecing together the information my mother (30 years mortgage adviser) has told me over the years.

Unless your hellbent on revenge I don't see it being worth it

I recommend taking the L, get another board, and be auspicious of any movements by an Mabel employees who try to "resurge".

Yes straight up said no. They have always been very rude and belierant when they choose to respond. Once I was waiting for my board to be sent back for 2 months. When I finally got an answer to my question “has my board even been looked at or has it just been sitting around the shop? The reply was “your board is just sitting around the shop”.

I am sorry about your loss but Marbel is not the worst scam. At least you got a turd.
Stary is the worst scam ever. Over 1000 guys lost all their money. NOTHING. Not even shippings. Kickstarter washed hands and looked away. They have taken half a million $usd and run away with total impunity.

It could be done really well too. A topic only leaders can post in (to avoid community lynching and vendor bashing) and all that's in there are post in regards to know people who have harmed or scammed out the esk8 community along with post and evidence to support such conclusions.

[/quote]

Just a couple of quick points here: you're talking about a Section 75 refund with your credit card company. 

1. They are jointly liable for the purchase under UK law, so essentially they bought the board because you paid with their money - and so because of that they get zero back from the retailer, they refund you and then take the hit. The product is often destroyed, and I do mean destroyed.

2. They will ask for the board to be sent to a third party (which you have to find and arrange, as well as covering any incurred costs) for inspection to confirm it is non functional. If you don't have it for any reason at all, even what is described above, no payout.

3. If in any of the communication the company you bought from offer to make the product right, even if its the first time out of 6, no payout.

4. If you have consistent dialogue, like they responded to you three times total in three months, no payout.

Essentially you get where I'm going here - A section 75 claim sounds amazing but in reality its just a massive waste of time and energy to get back where you started.

I've always been wary of kickstarter for this exact reason. Paying upfront for an essentially beta product by an unfunded startup with no investors/track record sounds like a really bad decision.

As for what to do, brah its been 3 years lol. That moneys gone, probably the board too. If I were in your shoes I'd be reverse scamming them out of spite/revenge.

Wow man so many people go screwed. I had almost the same experience except when they announced the 2.0 I was told to keep the 1.0 they sent me the 1.5 and that they were going to send me the 2.0 when it was ready. So I got 2 broken turds instead of one. I ended up DIYing them both with VESCs to get it rolling again. which there was some way I could help. you should aggressively persue this with you credit card company. I don't think there is  a time limit.

What pisses me off the most is how they told everyone in June  they were going to "get back to you in 24 hours" and just disappeared like a crackhead who owes rent. I laughed.
Some people here got caught twice paying for an upgrade to the Marbel 2.0  I feel like I was one of the more fortunate ones only because I mades video of the board when it worked. I was a huge supporter trying to keep the dream alive but now I realize they were never very interested in developing the product. Their second iteration was really only a rendering.
I say that I feel lucky at the end only because many people walked away with nothing while I have 2 Marbel boards. I payed $1200 just after the kickstarter and got the board a year later with tons of problems. I remained patient and they just kept fixing it . last summer Finally when It broke down for the 12th time they said just keep it "do what you want with it .... we are sending you the Marbel 1.5 with a larger motor and new wheels and wheel pulley. and the Marbel 2.0 when its ready.....I'll even upgrade you to the 2.0 Twin... I appreciated you support"  it was significantly stronger but it had the original problematic motor controller. Since then I have updated both boards with DIY parts, one with hub motors  but the Marbel 1.5 motor is still working and it is still my lightest board with any pull.  I noticed right away that the Motor mount (metal plate enforced ) and pulley cover was 3d printed. It is still holding together . I let it slide because I figure its a prototype.  They kept my hope alive by a thread. They explained they were developing the 2.0 and had investors and raised funds. A few months later in the fall after no updates I emailed them and got no response.
There are people re-invested in them and got screwed again. I knew after the first year when they decided to not update or make corrections they were just waiting it out till they could just slide out the back door.

Honestly even hearing about it makes me sick. They tried really hard to get me to send them money to “upgrade” to the 2.0 when I sent in the old board. They just scammed everyone in the beginning and then came back for more money. The last time I heard from them was like 2 months ago and was told I would hear back from them “in 24 hours”. It truly makes me sick that they got away with this.

Matt Belcher wasnt even a skater. His education was in Carbon fiber composition construction or something like that. I think this Marbel board idea came from seeing people make enclosures and he though he could build something better. I think he saw a kickstarter opportunity and gave it a shot after teaming up with other guys fresh out of school. Honestly I think it had the makings of a good idea but there was no plan for RD. I don't know but to go out the way he did was cowardliness.

Wondering if the Marbel headquarters exists. I sent an email saying I’m coming to Florida to wait where they receive mail to settle this in person or go to court. I’ll end up loosing more with plane tickets but I can’t stand to let this go. Especially after they conned me into sending back the broken gen 1.

I don't get it Did you call your bank or credit card company yet? I am curious to know  how this pans out.
It doesn't matter how long ago it was because you paid for and upgrade recently. you are protected either way. I don't understand why people can't get their money back. I found a fraudulent charge on my mothers credit card where she was charged a small amount every month  for **years** and they refunded all the money.

Will never happen after the first year of believing I would get a board. These guys are obviously a scam and be happy I didnt get shafted for more money. Surprises me that gofundme can turn their back on it too

It’s definitely becoming a strange world. Before this happened I couldn’t imagine a company being able to take thousands of dollars from customers and never fulfill orders. Now, I hear about it all the time. 

I can only assume Marbel has left for good, and at this point we have little to no chance of getting outlet money back. It took a while to sink in and accept I had been scammed. All we can do at this point is try to be cautious when placing preorders.

Personally if I ever need to do another preorder, I will make sure to have my money back long before the the card chargeback option has expired.

I feel for you man, and all the other Marbel customers that got scammed. Who knows,
maybe karma does exist.

What this companies need is a good bitter potion of publicity. Some article in Newsweek or Times telling all about their scams and then you'll see if some of them try stunts like this in the future. Until somebody takes these drowning companies and put a hose right in their mouths they will never learn to respect us kickstart costumers. Just likeee..... thatt. :smiling_imp:

I feel like this is going to be an ongoing scam until things like Kickstarter or preordering becomes more secure.

Marbel doesn’t care about bad publicity. I’m prettt sure they don’t even exist anymore. People have gone by where they claim to have an office and there was nobody working there.

Yeah, but if you warn the entire continent (not to mention the rest of the world who reads Newsweek) about this practises, these scammers will never change their tactics thinking there are enough fools all over the world, a big part of believers of their BS to empty their pockets. You'll see, when everybody starts to become aware of the shark infested pool these kickstarting campaigns are, companies will start to take us more seriously and not like now, some powerless, timid costumers, afraid to raise their voice; some scared Esk8 DIYers willing to lose their money now and then, here and there. :roll_eyes:

you literally can do nothing.

you paid 4 years ago.  Paypal/credit card usually has 6 - 12 months protection

Assuming they wasted all the money on production or legit straight up scamming
- emailing wont work
- lawyer letter wont work.  (You pretty much signed away all your rights when you backed with crowdfunding.  You didnt buy shares, or invest in the company in any way

- the most you can do is maybe threaten/shitpost on all their social media, family, friends, glitter bomb, general turd throwing.  (If that makes you feel better)


People need to realize to expect this when you are backing crowdfunding projects.  There are some excellent companies and products, but also plenty of noob entrepreneurs with zero experience in mass production manufacturing and waste all your money on rookie mistakes.

I don’t know if anyone will be reading this and I myself did not read every message in this topic, but after some research I managed to get a hold of one of the ‘team members’ of Marbel: Louis Meschino. Sadly, he was scammed too, he only made the video’s. He was never paid for it. Here are the pictures of the conversation I had with him. Let me know what you think...!

I don’t know how we can live in a country where the dude isn’t getting criminally charged. Bankrupt, but then left with a lot of money and avoided people, fleeing the state? I get sick of every time I hear about this company.....or Carvon

I paid for my board July 2015. Never received it. I sent letters in the mail and emails to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and they got back to me, saying there is nothing they can do. Marbel is just a scam, day-light robbers! They got out with million of $, and never delivered their products. I don't know how this is legal? How did they get away with it ?

Yeah it’s a scar that I’m still trying to get over. Carvon did the same thing

New industries unfortunately attract sharks.  Sometimes its just inexperience and sometimes its deliberate.   Fortunately now we have reputable companies out there offering decent products but we still need to be very careful of crowdfunding ventures because as you poor guys have discovered there is little to no recourse.

Feel for you guys I really do.

I was scammed by Matt also. He never delivered shit. So when I came back from overseas (military) to Jupiter, Florida...the family wanted to hit Busch Gardens. At first I was like that was too far, but after knowing Marbel was based out of Tampa I figured this would be a good way to kill two birds with one stone. Possibly get my money back to help pay for the theme park. Yea right.

After we had some fun we loaded up to try and find Marbel. The original place listed was non-existent but I asked around and a nice gentleman told me where his “shop” moved to. After some driving we ended up in a warehouse area and I found a door with the Marbel logo. Of course it was locked on what any normal person would consider normal business hours but I was determined. 

I went next door to his shop and a buff dude gave me the 411. He said he has seen them riding around out front on boards from time to time but this dude empathized with me because he was prior military and didn’t like hearing my story. I was airing dirty laundry with this bullshit company. 

While I was inside talking to this dude my father and law started banging on the glass to Marbel. In a way the cops would. Everyone was packing heat if things got stupid since we were out of our hometowns. Guess who walks out? Mathew Belcher. He goes on and on about trying to make things right and this and that. His bullshit was seen right through and after all was said and done wrote me a rubber refund check against the business. I tried to cash it just for fun knowing more than likely it wouldn’t clear. Of course it didn’t. Came back insufficient funds. I wasn’t surprised. This dudes a complete loser and not worth going to jail over. He’s doing things that end up getting you killed. I’m sure I’ll be a suspect when this dude ends up in a body bag. I’m fine with that too but at this point I just feel he has it coming. Hopefully it’s painful when it does and involved kneecaps for principal. 

Good luck but know at the very end...you got scammed just like the rest of us who gave hard earned cash to a POS.

By the way Boosted is solid and ended up being the answer! I have two of their boards and have had zero issues with them. Best part is...that I have called twice and both times actually spoke with someone. Planets ahead of Marbel. Lesson learned.

Wow man, thanks for sharing all that. Atleast that means that he’s able to be located. I’m gonna copy this over to the other forum if your ok with that.

I don’t know how the hell someone can get away with all this and not be in jail.

businesses go bankrupt every day usually with outstanding debt.  This is the whole point in setting up a business/corporation so people cant sue your personal belongings...

That’s a little different than intentionally taking money that you know won’t be paid back. It’s fraud and you can’t just hide behind a business license. Secondly he’s going around writing bad checks. You can’t just create a business, start taking orders, then once you pocket all the money claim bankruptcy.
