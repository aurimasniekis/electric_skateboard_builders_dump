Hi!

I have ordered a ownboard kit but I'm not going to use the esc and battery enclosure.
They are new and not used.

I need the charging port so that will not be included, the lcd voltage display will stay in the enclosure.

Just letting you know that it might be a while until these sell at this price since eskating.eu has pretty cheap enclosures at the moment. :eyes:

Wow nice and yeah that's true they have good prices for their enclosures.
I was just trying this price again because previous time they were quickly sold for the same price.

I think I'm going to drop the price to 20€ :wink:
