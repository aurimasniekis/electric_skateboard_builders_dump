Good looking out @Michaelinvegas, I got excited thinking I had missed an offering from HK!

But isn't that actually a good thing? All the cheap pulleys from stores like [maedler](https://www.maedler.de/product/1643/1616/1001/zahnriemenraeder-htd-5m-fuer-riemenbreite-9-mm) are with a 6mm hole until 32t.

The issue is snapping the shaft , but never used a 6mm shaft ....

If you noticed, 6mm shaft is hardly mentioned and places like Enertion and DIY Skateboards don't carry 6mm bore pulleys that I know of

yeah I noticed - but since the industrial pulleys all seem to have 6mm bores it could be perfect for beginners on a budget. Get one of those motors and a pulley for 4$, drill a hole in them for a grub screw and you are basically done.

Yeah get you...but motors such as these best left alone ... Especially if you have the NTM 50/60 that has 270kv and 8mm shaft...and is $20 bucks less

Anyway...moving away from 50mm cans, aside from chakas ...to 63mm only...

I have used 6mm shafts on a few builds.. they are alright. but I have snapped 2 of them (after hundreds of km of riding) replacement shafts are only $5

Weird it says 1288g on [this](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__672__663__Electric_Motors-63mm.html) page but 858g on the actual product page. If it is 1288g that's over 3 times the weight of an Ollin motor!
