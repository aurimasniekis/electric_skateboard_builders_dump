After months of testing motors from various manufactures we have finally found one that can endure the punishment of asphalt a debris. The 50mm diameter also provides much more ground clearance than most motors currently available. These motors feature sensors but work excellent in unsensored BLDC mode. 

These motors are currently in production and will be ready to ship in about 2 weeks. They have a surprising amount of power, easily powering a 200lb rider on a single drive. We are offering these at 10% off  the regular listed till the end of the month while we take orders on our first production batch.

Use this code for 15% off: OM5065

You would only be able to fit 2 of these in a Dual Diagonal configuration with standard trucks, and it can handle 10s according to @chaka's specs.

## \#5 Posted by: chaka Posted at: 2016-05-17T18:56:46.461Z Reads: 708

Yes, but you will need wide trucks to fit them on a dual rear. Dual diagonal would be fine on regular/narrow trucks. We have tested them at 10s and 12s but more testing needs to be done before we can advise using 12s.

Depending on your riding style you may get away with using a single if you use a heavily reduced gear ratio.

They also have great heat transfer into the motor mount, would be nice to develop a water-cooled motor mount to utilize this. 

@Michaelinvegas Thank you! The factory specs are a bit higher than what I have listed. Me specs are based on actual usage and motor temps on a single drive.

@delta_19  These are great little motors and they work really well so they definitely disprove that 50mm is inadequate. They are actually on the verge of being too powerful for the current drive systems.

@ecuadorche Sorry about that, our credit card proccesor will do that sometimes. You were only charged once ;) Thank you for your order!

so standard 10" calibers are out for dual rear unless you have extended axels and a couple of spacers, which could limit your choices of mounts. What mounts are you recommending and on what trucks? I like the idea of a wider wheelbase, so i want to try it out.

They are similar to the motors evolve is using but they are made to run at a higher voltage, really wish we unveiled this sooner since this model has been available for several months but we needed to be sure our changes would perform as expected.

 We received the confirmation on 12s yesterday so we are adding a 170kv motor to the first production order. I'll have the listing up later for those who want it.  

They are really powerful motors for their size. A single easily takes me to 25-30mph with a properly configured VESC. Really hit a sweet spot with the VESC. You can run them at their peak output and the VESC stays well within it's operational temperature range. This factors into why these motors do so well on hills.

@CRABOLSKY @ecuadorche  We will have v1 of our mount out next month if everything goes well but we might have to move them into production sooner if @torqueboards is discontinuing his v3 mount. I really hope he keeps that model, it works really well.

@HTownBomber That goes without saying!  If you buy a motor and a VESC it  will come pre-configured in BLDC mode.

@ecuadorche Yes, they will come with pulleys and a belt. Everything you would need. one detail is they will be made to fit caliber trucks only. The adapters for the paris trucks need a little more development.

@Michaelinvegas Noted ;) did you want to switch to 170kv or stick with the 200kv winding? If you are going 12s I recommend 170kv.

You might fit these on a dual rear if you go with some 195mm paris trucks. Dual rear is esthetically pleasing but I don't like having that much weight on the tail end of my boards. Dual diagonal drives spread the weight more evenly and the board responds much better when hitting sketchy pavement.  Having said this I am still open to building a dual rear to find a suitable truck/mount/ configuration if there is enough interest.

I should add that these motors are roughly half the weight of an sk3 motor and I really noticed a big difference in ride quality having switched from a 149kv sk3 to this form factor. Gaps and rough pavement feel much less aggressive than when riding with the big sk3's. The main reason for this is due to the difference between sprung and unsprung weight. Motors in eboarding are considered "unsprung weight" so finding the balance of power to weight is really important when deciding what motors to use.

No, not at all. We made a note to your order. Just to clarify you want the 170kv motor, that would be my choice on a 12s single drive. If you went 200kv at 12s I would suggest going with a dual diagonal drive.

We are coming out with 2 different drives/mounts. The first one is pretty standard 9mm belt and lower price, should be more than adequate for lighter riders on a single or anyone on a dual. 

The second mount is designed around a machined caliber truck and a 15mm belt with a fully supported wheel pulley.  This will take a little more time, we are still working some details. You will be able to swap wheels or rotate for even wear by removing the axle nut alone. The drive system remains intact. I'll post up some photos after we lock down the first run on the machined components. Shouldn't really say much more until we get the production run all lined out.

I've been scratching my head trying to figure out how to dual mount these motors. So far only mounts I've seen that will work are @torqueboards v3 mount and enertion's mount. However with Caliber II trucks, they can't be mounted side by side which leaves a front-of-axle and back-of-axle setup if you want both motors in the rear axle. However, Enertion's mount won't work for this since you can't change the angle of the motor mount which will leave the motor and mount resting on the floor when you mount it behind the axle. 

Guess I might have to pick up the v3 mount though I much prefer the v4 or Enertion's aesthetically :(

Sorry about the messy website guys! This will be changed shortly!

I'll also be building a new website as well.

v3 will fit the 50mm motors. However, these motors are 5065 with actual length being 70mm.

These won't fit on dual rear. You will have to ride a single and/or a dual diagonal setup.

The v4 motor mount to be only two pieces. There needs to be a separate motor mount plate for 50mm and 63mm.

I switched over to 6355 so it's more convenient to ride a dual rear setup. The 63mm diameter motor can also take more heat than a 50mm.

Evolve is able to use these motors on a dual rear with no issue since they have a much longer truck.

The original one is substantial weight. Gives the front end some more authority but heavier to carry.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/aa9f15696c1fff67affd30e2b4969a57086dc97b.jpg" width="333" height="500">

Thanks for stopping by Dexter! Sounds like V3 will be sticking around! 

@Randyc1 They measure 70mm not including the shaft so a dual rear is difficult to accomplish on conventional trucks. Luckily these motors are plenty powerful on a single drive. I have been punishing one on a 12s single drive cruising at 28mph with ease. By far the best motor I have paired with the VESC, very well balanced.

If anyone is dead set  I am pretty sure we can fit a dual rear on some 195mm Paris trucks with the addition of 5mm spacers. Either way, a dual diagonal is the way to go for better overall performance and weight distribution. Sure, dual rear looks sweet but it gets really sketchy on loose or rough asphalt. I really have to adjust my riding style to keep it reined in.

From an engineering perspective. I already really appreciate the increased protection they have, but what makes them special in terms of how they work compared to the 63mm motors or motors like the prop drive 50-60? I'm confused.

@torqueboards not everyone rides in clean manicured cities.  Every other motor I have tried ends up with shredded windings in less than 100 miles. This includes your little 230kv popper. Admittedly, I ride on asphalt and at 30+ mph the motor is constantly being peppered with rocks and sand. 

There has been a lot of speculation that these are the same motors that are on the new evolve that is coming out. They are not, these are larger more powerful motors and are suitable for a single drive budget build or a dual diagonal beast.

@makepeace Right now we are focused on developing the 50mm motors but we will bring a similar 63mm to market once we push our racing mounts into production. The 63mm motors are too powerful for the thin mounts available now. I have bent or broken every mount I have tried when pushing 63mm motors to there operational limits. They are also out of balance when it comes to the VESC and it can be difficult finding the right settings to keep the vesc from overheating on hills when using large motors. This will all change with the V5 VESC.

No, it doesn't have a third race like the sk3. It doesn't have as much power as an sk3 either but it is also half the weight. It is a decent single drive but if you plan on climbing something steep on a regular basis you would want two of them. A single takes me up to 25-28 mph on the flats but it will get a little hot if you push too hard for too long but so do the sk3 motors.

 I'll get some videos going soon showing how well it climbs. Best feature on this motor is the protective rotor housing. I have logged several hundred miles on them and the stator windings don't show any signs of damage.  

If you are wanting a decent cruiser with good top speed a single works well. If you want a beast with too much power that will climb anything and rocket to its top speed in a couple of seconds get a dual!

You will have no trouble on a dual drive. I weigh around 185-200lbs, at my age you fluctuate with the seasons. I can easily climb anything my single sk3 can. In fact I can climb longer hills on this little motor because the VESC doesn't overheat. My current setup is 16/36 tooth so I could get even more climbing performance with a little more reduction. 

And remember you are buying from OllinBoardCo. If you don't like it, send it back. ;)

@bigben Same cans but the windings and stator have been changed on the motors I have had made.

I have been getting a lot questions on gear ratios and performance of these motors so I though I might add a few details to help riders fit out the rest of their build.

Single drive - Aim for a top speed of 25 - 26mph, If you are geared to hit 30+mph it will climb poorly and the motors will run a little hot. Best to build a dual drive if you want to hit these speeds and keep things cool regardless of motor size. Due to wind resistance we use over double the wattage at these speeds. No way around it. You can do it but you should regard the build as a hotrod and expect less life from your ESC's and motors. So I recommend a 14/36 tooth drive on 80-83mm wheels and 14/44 tooth drive on 90+mm wheels.

Dual drive - A dual drive system is much more forgiving in regard to drive train ratio. For the average rider 26mph is still screaming fast so follow the above single drive suggestions and enjoy some massive climbing power with a decent top speed and great acceleration. You can always modify your gear ratio at a later point for a higher top speed without stressing the system but be advised things get very dangerous around 30mph. You will want to have the appropriate skill level and protective gear before even considering it. 

I do want to say that I do not recommend anyone gear their boards to get close to or exceed 30mph. I know I am a bit of a hypocrite but I simply cannot recommend anyoneto take these risks.

Lets say you are running 200kv at 10s. You would be geared to hit 33 mph! A dual wouldn't be stressed too much but a single drive will start to overheat the VESC and your motor. During climbing the motor will also not be working anywhere near an optimal rpm which starts somewhere around 5000rpm and goes up to 8600rpm. 

Some of you may have already experienced what feels like a throttle boost when riding your board hard. It is nice to be able to hit this sweet spot while climbing at a moderate pace while still retaining a decent top speed at 8000-8600rpm.

When you do make sure you drop it down to 14 tooth motor pulley.

9s would be around 24 to 25mph - 14/36 83mm on 200kv

If you can't find a 44 tooth wheel pulley you can drop the motor pulley down to 12 tooth but it may skip depending on rider weight. Of course a 15mm wide belt drive would eliminate this issue.

But where do you get a 36 tooth 15mm wide wheel pulley that'll fit flywheels?

Yes, if your mount supports that. Enertion's mount, for example, would not work because it won't mount behind the axle.

It is round inside. Uses up to four m5 set screws. I used 2 and it's solid as weld. The fit on the clone195s is disturbingly perfect. The real Randal's need to be hit with a file. Barely though. They are like .4mm thicker than the clone. I made them for the clone though because it's a nice 195 with roomy axle. The cool thing though is it sets up true. No more traveling belts!
I took a not so rough average between pulley and wheel combos. Also the bracket can mount inside or outside the flange to work with 9mm and 15mm pulleys!

hmm, I experience exactly that on basically every run with my 15/36T single 6355 tesseract. kept thinking about it, but couldnt come up with anything. always thought thats its the vesc going from soft exit to normal mode when the mosfets drop to sub 80degree.

whats the real reason for this "boost"?

You are hitting the sweet spot on the motor, similar to a power band.  I have experienced it on car esc's also.  Having tall gearing makes it more pronounced.

but what does sweet spot mean? how can you explain such a significant torque boost? first time it happened it nearly threw me off cause it came really unexpected, by now I know fairly well when it happens - always around 40kph, which is about 6000 motor rpm of the 6355 r-specc.

in theory I thought the typical motor diagrams look like this:

hm, maybe it is 2 different things here - for me it usually happens after getting from slight/moderate full load inclines to full load free riding: picking up speed, current plummets, mosfets get below 80degree and boost sets in when the lower temp threshold of the vesc is not active anymore. at least thats my working hypothesis!

its really a problem i have since my closed carbon enclosures :neutral_face:

2. I ordered the DIY mount and was supposed to get the v3 because I read that would definitely work, but they sent me v4 (accidentally) will the 200KV still mount properly?

What 15mm motor pulley works with this motor? Enertion's does not have a grub screw. Would DIY's work with this motor shaft?

They arrived last night! Give me a day to calibrate your VESC's and I will send you all a tracking number when the go out. The shafts are keyed so DIY's pulleys will work fine with these motors.

I have tested on FOC and it works but it is a big risk, BLDC gives much smoother operation on these motors. 

If you are dead set on using FOC then you are better off using an sk3 motor with low kv. Those have given me the best results so far in FOC mode.

I have not had great results on the bench in FOC mode with these motors so I have yet to run them out on the road with FOC enabled. I plan on doing more testing soon though. Once we get ahead of VESC orders I will have more time to sacrifice some hardware for the cause :fearful:

I hear bench tests and real road usage for FOC can lead to widely different experiences, so i wonder how these things will perform in a real world setting. I'll probably stick to bldc for reliability on your VESC and motors.

Yeah FOC is very finicky. Like I said the only motors I have had good results with have been the sk3 192kv motors to be exact. You do lose a lot of top end speed in foc so not too much to be gained.

Plug it in and detect hall sensors in VESC setup, that's it. It helps with dead start acceleration, but that's pretty much it. I'd like to use it since i'm often stopping at lights uphill, where I sometimes can't kick hard enough to get it rolling much.

[quote="chaka, post:152, topic:3409"]
Some of you may have already experienced what feels like a throttle boost when riding your board hard. It is nice to be able to hit this sweet spot while climbing at a moderate pace while still retaining a decent top speed at 8000-8600rpm.
[/quote]

this thing keeps nagging in the back of my head. i have this very pronounced boost with my 6355 rspecc 190kv, i experienced a similar but less pronounced boost with my sk6374 168kv - both in bldc mode, both kicking in around maybe 90% of max rpm.

foc however does not show this behavior, its a clean smooth run from 0 to topspeed. only checked on sk, once i feel like opening up my tesseract ill try foc there as well on the rspecc to double check. 

might be a bldc/vesc and not a motor thing? i just cant really think about any mechanic in a motor that is supposed to generate a sudden torque jump. :confused:

I was on vacation at the time when I sent that email.  I made it clear that I was away from my computer. That quote was directed at jinra, this is why it is best to get your info through email rather than a forum post.

 I have very little patience for rude behavior and have refunded your order. Your refund will show up on your account within 5 to 10 days. I think it would be best if you do business with another vendor from here on out.

June 9th was 26 days ago???  I understand this is still a long time to wait but I am not some big box store where you can use rude language or get pushy and expect continued service.

 I am a builder/fabricator/designer and dealing with an upset customer is not my strong suit. I actually hired a customer rep for this very reason, and she does just that, represents the customer. If you had sent an angry email I would have forwarded it to her and you would likely still be getting your order but you decided to continue to inquire here.... repeatedly. I don't mind this as long as you remain courteous. 

As far as I am aware we are the only eboarding company actually building a factory. Eventually we will be building everything "in house" and we will not be held down be a motor manufacturer's production schedule but this is still a long way off for us... or not, we are growing much faster than anticipated.

I understand I should be contacting you guys by email, except when I try to I never get a response with the one exception from a week ago where you said you believe my vesc was ready and you are waiting for the motors to arrive.

That's more than just a business right there. Btw all his products actually meet their deadlines and still have great quality so go buy from the others so u can wait a nice 5 months for a single part

Not sure why it matters when i joined but I have been a long time reader and only have an account as i needed to DM someone on here.  You apparently had a good experience and that is great but that was/is not the case for the poor guy on here who got his order cancelled simply for calling Chaka out on a lie.  This isn't the first time that chaka has done this either.  Rather than admit he is wrong and correct the issue, he simply cancels your order no matter how long you've already been waiting.  How is that ok ?  Put yourself in that guys shoes and tell me that would be ok with you.  For the record, i appreciate Chakas contributions to the community, he is brilliant.  But that doesn't mean he can treat people like this.  It's not ok and someone had to say something about it, as the folks who are waiting for parts don't want to get their orders cancelled by speaking up, which is understandable as they've already been waiting long enough.

Moral of the story: Keep your business dealings professional, no matter which side you're on. It is well known in this industry, especially with small 1 man companies, that shit happens (frequently), situations change, mistakes are made, promises made in good faith can't be delivered on for any number of reasons, and delays are to be expected. It's how you deal with those situations, on both sides of the table, that define the outcome. There are no guarantees that things will go the way you want, or that you'll get your product when you expect it (for both customers and vendors). 

Personally, I know that in my job, I do my best to remain professional under all circumstances, and do my best to keep all of my clients, coworkers, bosses, etc. happy. But unfortunately, shit happens, and I can't always provide my services as timely as possible. But when it comes to my clients, I'll gladly take daily phone calls and emails asking for status from those who keep their cool, are understanding, and remain pleasant and professional. However, as soon as someone starts getting pissy with me and comes at me with "WTF, where the hell is my order, you fucking liar!" or something to that effect, I'm done with them. They can hit the road and find someone else who will put up with that shit. 

So, everyone, keep playing nice! :slight_smile:

@chaka going off your recommendation for pulley sizes (36/16t) for a mono drive on that calculator you shared. For some reason 12mm Belts are greyed out. Any idea why? 12mm is as fat as I can find in the US (Miami Boards Wheel pulley, DIYs motor pulley) Also- should I be concerned about the teeth in mesh warning?

Re: center diff . I was going off of something I read about distance on DIYs site. I haven't a clue what the distance will actually be with the OG Pyscotiller mounts, 3D printed kegel 36t and and a 16T from DIY. Both those pulleys are 12mm. @torqueboards has 3 sizes of 12mm belts on his site. category/electric-skateboard-parts/pulleys-belts/timing-belts/ Am I way off base here? I'm only finding 12 and 9mm sized pullies readily available in the US so I have to assume there's a belt that will work no? Any idea of what center distance is right? Or more to the point-- what size belt do I need?

Really isn't a good idea to ride faster than 25 mph without suiting up in leathers or other riding gear like tech denim and a moto style jacket or long sleeve reinforced shirt. This is one of my favorites: http://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/speed-and-strength-rust-and-redemption-armored-moto-shirt

Having said that, I would suggest going with the 200kv motor on 10s but 170kv might perform a little better with big pneumatics. so it is a tough decision.

Not done with the build yet, but should be flat ground. My reasoning is that boards tend to hit their max efficiency pretty easily given that the Raptor with its theoretical max speed of 45km/h seems to hit it pretty easily. My Evolve GT hits 26mph as well, which is about 1 mph lower than it's unloaded speed (27mph).

Dual. Single would probably get the same as well assuming it has the power to reach near max efficiency. Going dual motors mainly increases torque/power not top speed, though it can increase speed if a single motor doesn't have the power to reach high efficiency. Build log here!

So when controlling from the control panel on BLDC tool (bottom right), I couldn't get duty to go past 50% for some reason. I only got 82% duty cycle by using my remote. 

After I switched the phase wires around, I am now getting higher erpm (with remote)! Though still not as high as 200kv.

The proper way to evaluate the results from realtime data is to divide the power by the motor current to find the actual voltage being delivered to the motor.

In your last screen shot we are seeing the power equaling 15.6W . We divide that by the motor draw of 0.73 amps and we get 21.4V

Now we take the ERPM of 27856 and divide it by 7 pole pairs and get an actual rpm value of 3979 rpm. We can now divide 3929 rpm by 21.4V and we get 185.5kv but we are only running at a duty cycle of 94.4% so we need to calculate for that. We take 185.5kv and divide by 94.4 and we get 1.97 which we now multiply by 100 to find the actual or estimated kv of 197kv.

The actual kv of these motors measures around 203kv with a calibrated instrument. There seems to be a small margin of error when measuring with the realtime data plot on the VESC.

I got a slightly different number for the KV before calculating 94.4% duty cycle, but still landed almost exactly@ 197kv.
15.6W/.73=21.4V
27856ERPM /7=3979RPM
3979/21.4V= 185.9Kv
185.94/94.4= 1.97
1.97*100= 197kv
Sounds perfectly reasonable to me. Totally checks out.  :thumbsup:

Do not try this at home!!! Traveling at speeds above 20-25 mph is extremely risky. Skateboarding is inherently dangerous and can cause serious injury or death even at moderate speeds.

I had a few users wanting to know if they can run the 200kv version at 12s with the VESC V4.12 so I fitted one of my 12s boards with a pair on 16/36 on 90mm abecs. The torque was a little lighter but they still climbed a 10% grade at 20 mph, Might try a steeper hill later today. Top speed was a little over 37mph in a full tuck and the motors were hot but I could still hold them in my hand after the high speed runs.

 I still recommend going with the 170kv motors at 12s but the 200kv motors seem to be working fine. These motors perform best if geared to top out at 30mph and under, if you really want a high speed beast you will want to wait for V6.xx VESC and fit them with some 6368 or larger motors. I'll use this board as my daily driver for a few weeks and make sure no faults develop.

@Sboard342  You can do the ying yang style of mounting. In my opinion it doesn't look esthetically pleasing but it works. I am a big advocate of a dual diagonal setup for weight distribution reasons. The rear end will wash out fairly easily in a dual rear and when it does it is hard to bring it back.

@Sboard342 You will need at least 140mm-142mm of space for a dual rear so it looks like randals might be the solution for you. The actual length of our motors is 70mm when you included the shaft collar.

The cool thing about the clones is they don't require any milling. Perfect fit.

One more route is the surfrodz tkp trucks. I have mounts for those on my site as well. 200mm

This is interesting information. It's really got me reconsidering going with a dual rear config. 
Maybe a dual diag is in the cards for my build. Back to the ol' drawing board. :persevere:
I'm a little bummed the Buck195s won't work for dual, but maybe that's the universe trying to tell me something. 
I'm personally trying to go with as much USA made stuff as possible on my build. 
@Chaka In that video where you are running a single drive 12s 170kv, you seem to be tearing up hills with ease. How powerful are these 5065 motors? I'm around 220lb could I get away with a single drive build without killing my motor or VESC? Maybe OK for a casual cruiser?

If you reduce your gear ratio to top out around 20-25 mph a single will get the job done but you really want a dual to get good performance at 220lbs.  If you go dual diagonal remember that you can extend your motor/phase cables to reach your forward mounted motor. 

Edit: If you keep your VESC's together you can also save space by sharing a capacitor bank. If you have trouble fitting 10 awg motor cables you can drop them down to 12 awg. I don't recommend doing this on the battery cables but the phase wires on a dual will be sharing the load plus these smaller motors don't pull extremely huge amounts of power.

Hello, I'm wondering if anyone else has had this issue (below), or if i am doing something wrong.  If anyone could help me get this sorted out, I would be eternally greatful. I have the 200kv Ollin motor to use with my 10s setup.  I have Vesc version 2.18 and am using the corresponding BLDC tool.  I decided to use a 3s battery to setup the motor "FOC" style in the BLDC tool as I've heard of issues with higher capacity batteries during Vesc setup.  Below is a list of steps i took exactly, but the issue I'm having in short is with the second detection parameter in the FOC tab, I just keep getting "Bad Detection" when i click "Measure A (Req: R)".  

Here are the steps i've taken exactly so far in case it helps.

1. Connected Vesc to motor, didn't attach sensor wire.
2. Connected 3s battery (balance charged and verified voltage) to Vesc.
3. Open BLDC tool, verified connected in BLDC too.
4. Clicked "Read Configuration"
5. Inputed 10s Battery limits, clicked on "FOC" button up top and clicked "write configuration" (could this be the issue as I have a 3s battery connected for setup on the vesc ?)
6. Clicked on "FOC" tab on the left
7. Clicked on "Measure R and L", measured successfully and got these values ;
R: 0.03002
L: 23.28
A: 0.000000000
8. Clicked on Meaure A (Req: R) - got bad detection error.

I've had that happen, not sure why.
I've found after I do the first measurement I wait about 10 sec before I do the 
next one and sometimes it takes 2 or 3 tries
also I reboot evettime I switch between FOC and BLDC

But 3s might be too low for the motors also I'd think you'd want 6s minimum

Honestly you shouldn't be messing around with FOC. A lot of VESC's have burned up the drv chip in FOC mode and unless you know how to use a hot air gun and replace chips you will be severely inconvenienced with repairs and replacements.  But you could get lucky, it is just a huge risk.

Excellent tips! Would it be advisable to make sure that the power and phase wires are the same length for both motor/VESC setups or am I being too OCD about stuff?

I wouldn't worry too much about different lengths but you need to be sure you have very short lengths bettween the capasitor bank and the vesc.  I have seen some builds out there with several inches of cable bettween the two and it can be harsh on the vesc over time.

For anyone wanting to hook up the sensors. You'll need a different header to use as an adapter since the one that comes with the motors don't fit or align up to the VESC.

I ordered these http://www.ebay.com/itm/131589536983?_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT, but you may want to get a 6-pin one so you don't have to do what I did and remove one of the wires to fit directly into the 5v lead. However, I know that these fit well with the VESCs.

If you get the above you should remove the red and black leads and place the black one where the red one was. The red lead will go straight onto the VESC as shown. Once you place the JST header into the VESC, the flange on the header should secure the red lead as well. From there just solder the header on the other side (make sure it lines up with the motor's JST).

One thing to note is that the motor's JST header fits on sort of backwards of how you would expect, but is otherwise snug and secure. The missing pin between 5v and hall1 is the temp data which isn't present on the OM5065.

Thanks @torqueboards and @bender for your responses.  I figured that might've been the issue and rolled the dice on that after i posted.  I should've posted a follow up with my solution.  For the record, if anyone is having the issue i was having, changing the battery values to match the battery you're using during programming resolves the issue. Also, checkout @torqueboards [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJFHsRtLtnI) as it is the most complete setup video there is on how to setup your vesc.  Thanks again.

well you can increase length or width like that, but then you'll make it skinnier the opposite dimension, which will result in more jiggling or the stock not making contact with the pulley.

That would mean Chaka is using 18mm instead of 21mm square spacing.

18mm square = 25-26mm circle
21mm square = 30mm circle diameter
31mm square = 40mm circle diameter

Standard 50mm are usually 21mm. SK3 50mm are 18mm.
Standard 63mm are usually 31mm.

@Chaka can confirm?

The only reservation I would have about the Enertion mount is the Carbon fiber plate that the motor is mounted on. I believe that aluminum would be best there. It acts to draw the heat away from the motors and allows the trucks to become part of the heatsink. I feel this is a nice benefit overall.  Very cool pic from @Jeff's thread....

I came back from work today with very heavy wind resistance and up some hills. When I got home my motors were burning hot to the touch. I'm using chakas motors with Enertion's mount.

In contrast, my GT with similar motors has only 1 motor get pretty hot, but not nearly as hot as chaka's. I agree that using aluminum (and thermal paste!) for the mounting plate is probably a better idea.

Thanks! I'm surprised by how well everything ended up working together. I've been tinkering with all the mechanical parts for the past couple months while waiting for the SCP4, but once I got it, I just drilled some holes, mounted it, and everything was pretty smooth from there.

The only issue I had was the random cut off when accelerating, but I think I fixed it by changing to hybrid mode (vs sensored).

Best to keep your gear ratio down so you only reach a 20 mph top speed on a single drive setup. This goes for almost any size motor unless you have an ESC that can handle the load. These 5065 motor are a perfect match for the v4.12 vesc, Go larger and you run into overheat issues.

Depends on what you are trying to accomplish, esc capability, battery size and spec...ect. Our motors are great for dual diagonal builds or singles with more gear reduction. They have plenty of clearance and are very stealthy if that is what you are looking for. If you want top quality and price isn't a barrier look into some Plettenber motors or some Kontronik outrunners.

If you are building a single drive you would need to be very careful with what gear ratio you choose. As I said previously,  these motors are best used in a dual drive application.  Speak with @trampa he has motors that are similar to Plettenber outrunners. Or get a large sk3. Big sk3 motors are wonderful on a single drive builds but they can cook an esc if it isn't up to the task.

However you can have the most powerful motor in the world and it will only be as powerful as your battery pack will allow. There are many variables.

Your motor has 5pin and VESC takes 6, because this motor doesn't have temp wire.
I had the same problem yesterday with the Oliin ones (and @chaka helped me out) , but it's an easy pin-out. The connector for sensors is the one near the capacitors (see diagram),.

Wires: Black for Ground, Red for 5v and the others can be used in any particular order before motor calibration. Just leave the temp wire unplugged.

Firstly, and as I'm sure everyone here will support, congratulations on your preparedness.  

Every responsible rider knows to put a smoke detector near their DIY at a minimum.  Well done.

Our most responsible parents and spouses also keep big-boy fire extinguishers next to the entry point of the room where our charging racks sit.

You've got some work ahead to get that smell out.

- anything that's a porous fabric, including carpet, sofa - it really depends on the length of exposure to The Demons Within, yet I'd advise replacing (if possible); if replacement isn't possible, wash with...
- everything else that's not a porous fabric - walls, floors, ceilings, etc. - mix an unscented, de-greasing dishwashing detergent into a 5-gallon bucket of water, add quite a bit of baking soda, and scrub everything at least twice, allowing to dry between cleanings
- lather, rinse, dry

For the hand, try lidocaine (in a pinch, Ambesol works)

Best of luck my friend.
