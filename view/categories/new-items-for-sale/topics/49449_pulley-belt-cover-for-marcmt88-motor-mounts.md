Many of you who bought my motor mounts have been asking about a pulley cover.  After many weeks of testing different models, I finally decided on one.  They are machined from a solid rounds of Acetal Delrin (POM), **not 3d printed**.  Cover can be retro fitted with any of my marcmt88 mounts.  I will include a template for the mounting holes.  The height is 7/8‚Äù or 22mm, fits perfectly with low profile 15mm wide pulley.  If you have a protruding lip pulleys, you would need to bore a hole on the center of the cover for clearance.  

The price for my pulley cover is $25 including US shipping.

FYI:  I also carry low profile HTD5M steel motor pulleys 14, 15, and 16t but currently are out of stock.  New inventory should arrive sometimes in April.

Nice work! This will certainly last longer than a 3d printed cover

Are the pulleys still available? I'm interested in a pair of 15T 15mm with 8mm bore shipped to Germany.

2 15t pulleys are $30 + $15 shipping to GER.  Not sure if worth it.
