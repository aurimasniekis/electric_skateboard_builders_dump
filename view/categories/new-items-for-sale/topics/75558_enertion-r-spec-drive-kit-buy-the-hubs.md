Cannot help myself, but i totally dislike the different wheel sizes. It is something like a miracle to me.

Not worth imo for $900... just buy the whole raptor at that point, you can part out the rest and it'll probably still be cheaper

edit: in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if thats exactly what they're trying to get you to do

@Grozniy, remember that time you said maybe $500! Lol.

But, at least it is the new drive train and not the old 2.0 stock.

Also, this is the initial posting, BF deal may be pretty sweet.

I'm sure he would only offer this during this BF. So I don't expect a price drop.

They were always going to be around 600 us.  900 aus.  Thats not bad really.  Carvons are a 1000 aus and not available and theres nothing else comparable out there.  Before you start @b264 I know ones a hub drive and the other is direct drive but they have similar power characteristics so comparable.
Hummies are cheaper and look like the best of the bunch but you will have to wait.  Maybe black friday will bring some reductions.  Who knows?

600 us. 900 aus
[/quote]

This is a critical error, because I immediately thought is was USD for some reason .... which means @onloop's customers (in Freedom Unit Land) might be scared away by a price that's actually not as high as they think it is.

Put an "AUS" on that price :smirk:

So after doing some site playing it seems to be the higher price. This is all in aus bucks. This means that if you try to emulate a raptor 2.1 with those price points you will get.

Drive    $1237.50
Unity    $410
Battery $399
charger $68
remote $39

Total equals  $2135.50  Without a deck or enclosure.  

Raptor 2.1 complete   equals  $2159

Buy complete guys and get yourself some free shit
That is a real shame tbh.

Much better off buying complete and selling off the deck and the battery.

Unless prices drop for BF.

I also would like to know the planed delivery time and how it is if you add a unity. Will it be shipped only when the second batch unity‚Äôs are ready or separated?

We have allocated 100 focbox unity for use with these drive kits. We believe majority of people will add the unity on considering the crazy low price of $199usd. 

Simply add the unity to cart with drive kit and you automatically get the discount.

Drive kit price will be revealed soon.

Yeah I don‚Äôt need the drive train but the unity for 199 üò±üòÇ dann now I got thinking again.
