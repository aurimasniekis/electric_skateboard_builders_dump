Hey, guys as we have a lot of leftover material we made some X truck brackets.

This is 6mm height. At the moment it's only in black, but soon will be red and other colors.

@Kug3lis would you consider making the screw counterbore hex in shape?

To capture hex head screws so we can tighten/loosen with one tool.

is this even possible with cnc... Maybe not hex shape but with some flats to capture the heads?

This always drove me nuts. Especially if the screw is phillips, which cams out. Getting mad just thinking about it. I'm just about ready to try welding a cross bar on truck mounting screws...

Of course truck mounting hardware is typically imperial #10-32. I don't know if people in non-imperial countries are using #10-32 screws...

Well, it's possible to make hex shape but not with sharp edges but would have bit roundness, but flat surfaces should still hold it I guess? But don't know have to ask :)

I guess, could drill/mill out a small hole at each corner, to make the roundness a negative space rather than a positive.
