Since I waited so long for it to arrive I already changed my setup to a trampa VESC.

So I will be willing to sell the Focbox Unity for the price to cover my costs.
I am looking for 260 € excluding Shipping.

I am from Austria. Shipping to Austria and Germany is around 8 € for the rest of europe I will have to check the online calculator.
