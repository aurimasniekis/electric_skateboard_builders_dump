I just submitted for a purple TBDD plate. I am not married to the color if you have minimums for production.

No minimums for the colors. But we need to get at least 10 to get the order in with the factory

Hey guys, I thought that the google form was capturing emails automatically. If you've submitted your pre-order info, I'll need you to go back and update the form with some additional information. Thanks!!

```
What is the increment of adjustment? 2.5 degrees or 5 degrees for each smallest adjustment in angle? Also, What is the axel height above the mounting surface, and does the axel height change when you go from 0 to 60 or does it stay the same?

The axel height depends on the truck that you’re fitting into it. I’ll have to double check the increments. It’s been awhile since I’ve opened the file.

Am I right in thinking I only need to attach the hanger to your base plates? Have you got a pic of all the parts included?

Hey guys, I set up an order sheet on the site. If you have any questions, or if you’d like to split your pair and have 2 different kinds of base plates for different hangers, let me know.

Adding the ability to order singles instead of as a pair. We still need a few more orders to make it work.!
