Hi, can you give me more details like postcode, city etc. The shipping would be expensive from Indonesia. Anyway i don’t want to sell the wheel pulleys only, i want to sell them all for 60$ + shipping (if you don’t mind the cost, i could check them for you). Btw you could get some 12mm pulley from eskating.eu, or maybe from unikboards.com, closer to you i think.
