I recently posted this in "No words...just pictures" thread and got a few likes.

Seems like you have attached a sticker and applied much heat?

It's dye-based ink. In other words, you can wash it. Not a sticker, but I did apply much heat :).

What size shirts do you wear? These are Hanes men's small, they fit on me but they're too long imo(about 5 inches past my waist). I'm 5'6" 125 lbs and Kid's XL 14/16 usually fit well.
