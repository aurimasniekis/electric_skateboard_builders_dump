I originally ordered 2 just in case, but I only ended up using 1. 

same thing as what I used on my build here

**To be clear, this is 1 mount, and DOES NOT included the bullet connectors or any kind of wiring.**

The other one is for sale --saves you a ton in shipping from France.

$22 shipped to the 48. (im in San Diego, so can meet up and knock $5 off shipping.)

from the site, unbranded, single riser with space for 5.5mm female bullet connector.
