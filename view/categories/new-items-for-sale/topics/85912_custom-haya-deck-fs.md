Ok guys. Gonna keep this short and sweet. I put this up in the other place too...



I am doing a custom Haya for someoneâ€¦ maybe you?

It is a standard Haya deck that I am going to customize to give it more character.

The lid is going to be CF with glass frit, which I am just finishing up now.

![20190303_073203|690x384](upload://em7Pf3pWiWZnjixh45ul7QjgTpW.jpeg) ![20190302_104513|690x335](upload://quFlOarJkdwQb1SIinFg7HAMp3l.jpeg) ![20190301_145312|690x335](upload://6s1W2sRAt2rkiq8kW586wKX2VmN.jpeg) 

The ends of the top beyond the edge of the lid can be finished in CF to match the rest of the lid, or painted, I will leave that up to the buyer.

The bottom I am going to leave unfinished as I want to be able to customize it for whoever gets it.

There are a LOT of options here. But essentially it will be a fabric lamination chosen by you or even custom designed by you. You want your avatar with lightning bolts behind it? Cool.

You own a business and want your logo? No sweat.

Want the lyrics to your favorite nickelback song just like it is tattooed to your upper thigh? Ok, I guess

Or you can just select from one of 750,000 options that are already available.

I am going to post some examples of some of the projects I have done for people to give you an idea of what it looks like.

Also, things like changing to polished hardware for the lid is of course doable too. Can even imbed subtle reflectors in the epoxy for increased visibility.

Here are some examples.

Here are some examples of some custom fabrics coming in or being worked on (@mmaner does all the design work, so your deck will be touched by an angel)

![20190302_110708|668x500](upload://7NkefEKxYMQ5QHxGrWDxvDGvy3r.jpeg) ![20190302_110648|666x500](upload://eYc5ZopRzThcCWUzdJHv7o4jKIA.jpeg) 

This is a detailed and time consuming process. So donâ€™t crucify me at the stake for the price point.

Custom Haya $425

That includes shipping (within US, international, we will figure it out) and all custom costs (within reason, lol).

Please hit me up if you have any questions or want more details.

Turn around will be approximately 3-4 weeks after the fabric is selected and ordered (most of that time is waiting for the fabric). This is unless something unforeseen happens of course.

How I want to do it is take a $200 deposit on PayPal so I can get the fabric you select ordered. Then finish the project while sending you progress updates. After it is complete, you will pay the balance and I ship out the board to you.

The deposit is just to protect me so you donâ€™t change your mind and leave me stuck with a custom deck with your ugly face on it or somethingâ€‹:joy:.

I guess this wasnâ€™t short. My bad.

If I can get someone to scoop it up, it will be so ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥!  I have some stuff I could finish it with here or even a Sender Skates design @mmaner made.  But it will be so much cooler to get it to someone all tricked out to their liking!

Fuk yeah! Glad you got the price worked out. This level of customization is worth every penny. Plus no need for grip tape

Thanks man!  For people who send me a deck it is in the $150-$200 range.  I am trying to get some cool stuff and offer it up like this.

It is tempting to just finish the decks in a cool way that I like and posting them up for sale, but I think it is cooler for people to be able to really personalize it.


We shall see if there is even a market for this kind of thing though. Worst case scenario, I just keeping skinning stuff for @mmaner!ðŸ˜‚

Just wait until I finish up a new evo for him!  It is going to be simultaneously epic and a harkening to the past.  Just waiting on the deck from Muir and the fabric to come in!

I still haven't built out the skull deck. Waiting for six shooters and battery build. After that I got one more Hummie build. That will be my 3rd and final Hummie build for a while (famous last words ðŸ˜‚). 

Urethane Belt. Pneumatic Belt & maybe Enertion Hubs?

But wouldn't this be dope on the bottom!


![20190306_092722|690x335](upload://aDtQ8VZkSaqK31Y57HLEU9sSgVf.jpeg) 


I have this on hand.  That makes turn around a lot faster. And since it is already here, I could finish it out for $400 including shipping in the US.


I would still rather make it custom on the bottom for someone, but I ordered this fabric a while ago because I do like it a lot.  Grungy feel.
