Getting rid of two small decks that I'll probably never use because I'm just not comfortable with short decks so one is enough for me both are new. Shipping would be around $15 in the US I think.

[NO LONGER AVAILABLE] Penny 32" Deck  - $50 shipped, I have another one I kick around, good for that. Not sure about electrifying though.
