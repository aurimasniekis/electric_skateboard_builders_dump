This is great !!! At 80 euros, I take a set (2 pulleys) ! I'm France and can pay you any way (I prefer SEPA transfer, if UK is still in SEPA zone ;) ) and any time you want.

2 weeks later they are here. Pictures uploaded on the top of the thread. Thinking I will open a preorder for the pulleys, what do you guys think?

The pulleys I made now are all reserved for people and they will hopefully get shipped out in the next few days.

I also knocked off $5 the total price so a set is nice $75. Quantity discounts included. 15% off for 3 sets, 20% off for 4 sets

Thanks Mike ! This is a very valuable information for me. My motor is around 200kV and my motor pulley is 15T, it seems it will be enough torque in the end !

I saw Timo sells the 2-in-1 kit with 60T for AT mode and 32T in Street mode and the motor is the same for both mode but now, I'm sure it will be good. I tried the calculator but wasn't sure anyway.

These SKF bearings are the shiiite. The tolerance on them is outstanding, almost no wiggle on the axle and they fit perfectly in the pulley. Only thing is that they stick out 1.5mm from the pulley. Any ideas how to make them fit better, if possible @moon bug ?

Check the width of the bearings

They should be 11mm wide

Found the reason:

The hub is protruding inside the pulley. So to fix it I would need washers between the hub and pulley on the hub bolts

Ok are you using the 1mm washers that come with Bergmeisters?

I've tested fitments and it's all good

Washers between the nut and hub? Ben's wheel had them so I assumed..

I'll supply pulleys with the right washers this time.
