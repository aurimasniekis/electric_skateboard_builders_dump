Hi Guys,

Trying to clean out some of my stock as I'm moving away from the Esk8 game due to time commitments.  Looking to sell kits in multiples.  You can still get a single kit, but there won't be any discount.  Refer to my other thread for any questions on the kits.  I've sold many of these kits on here over the past 1.5 years with many happy customers.

2 Kits = $35 per Kit = $70 ($10 Savings)

Where did you source the unmodified pulleys from? Ebay? It doesn't seem to be complicated to use the same raw material and modify it to use on Kegel style wheels. Cheers

I had these custom made from a manufacturer in China.  It would be easy enough to do Kegels, but you would need to order a large quantity.
