Yesterday I wanted to buy a Focbox and a nano controller so I went until the stage of putting in my address and the total shipped was €160. But since today is black friday I decided to wait and see if prices would drop. 
Today I did the same thing with the price drop for the focbox but the total ended up being €163 because of €37.00 shipping which for sure was not there yesterday :thinking:

They said they had them in stock then. They didn't. The global shortage had nothing to do with them stating "in stock" items. As in, they already physically had them. The shortage is a moot point and it's not applicable.

I'm asking what's different and what has changed since then.

Actually, the reason for the delay last time was due to the fact we fired our project management team & our stock got lock away due to legal issues.

...which in plain christian language means 7-10 weeks, no? ...or should I say months? Why would most need 10 Focboxes? I'm not a stablished builder who required such amount of FBxes, so I will not get free shipping with one FBx by no means. $99 dollars for a unit + $42 dollars shipping = $141 per unit!  

Where was this Joe who was recently selling Focboxes here in the forum for $135 bucks? :thinking: Better get in contact with one of those guys and will get the Focboxes at our doors in 6 days! Last year I bought one of those, brand new from a forum member in Minneapolis for $150 ...arrived in 7 days!

Enertion shipment kills the whole deal. 10 Fbxes or nothing.

I was at the Evolve site trying to get a $50 Enclosure which supposedly end up in $37.5 after the 25% BF rebate... here in the US... well, with state tax, shipment, air quality discount, 30 year earthquake tax, the Olympic games in 2078, etc... the thing goes back to $50 again! So is surreal, you cannot blame Enertion neither (well their shipment predictions are puzzling). BF down the drain.

Man you complain a lot. Don't buy from us then.

Or buy more than $299 worth and get free shipping, then you can sell the 2 focbox that you don't want to a local dude and offer free shipping and make a profit and everyone wins.

Instead your deep internal sadness for life drives you to moan endlessly. Such a downer.

You have ruined black Friday

Yup. Facts man.

Not saying we are perfect, but the truth is making these  type of motors is really difficult. Huge amount of trial and error is required. Years of work needed. 

Just look at how hard hummie and carvon (and enertion) have had to work. Revision after revision is the path to success in this category.

I've probably got another two or three further revisions planned, another few years at least.

Ask the freight companies. We don't control that

What we can control is the distribution structure we choose, at the moment we ship direct to customers from our warehouse in China. Because we are a fairly small operation we don't have leverage to reduce prices. 

What we must do is build better distribution models. As the industry grows there will be more opportunities to optimize our distribution. Ultimately this will reduce cost and speed of shipping.

If it's any consolation, I think torque boards DD motor may be electro-mechanically better than carvon. The key difference is TB designed the motor specifically for the application. Carvon were always adapted from normal outrunners or retrofit hubs.

Motor design is critical to making a strong reliable direct drive train. You must have a fully customized design.

...je...je.. ...really? You make it sound like space science. @Hummie my friend, works in his basement! ...and his motors are made with his own hands, he cooks all that thing in his kitchen and when finish, he himself sends every single motor thru the nearest post office, sometimes walking the distance because his board is not working or smthng. So you telling me that @Hummie's hub motors not only beat the crap out of the competition (you, Carvon) and is playing at the same technological level as you guys, all from a kitchen in some basement in San Francisco, Kalifornia... and... 

What have you done all this time then? ...with all this ko-ka mania chinese b..!  your space science, "2 or 3 years ahead" of everybody, when this guy with his limited, very limited resources (but tons of knowledge and ingenuity) is leading the way with his fantastic @Hummie motor made in a San Fran basement, hummm..? C'mon Jason, time to land your space ship, man.

The inventor himself the day I was at his place... :point_down:

I really like what hummie is doing too, once again a fully customized motor design is critical to success. I personally rode the first ever hummie hub motors, actually rode them side by side with jacob hubz, compared to what he has now the advancement has been huge. Clearly Hummie has done the hard work and I'm sure it will pay off. I'm sure as he ships more and more we will see the proof of this.

Have you guys considered a partnership with @Hummie? If I were you guys, I’ll sponsor him and I would sell his hubs on your website as alternative, then in a year or so, you can decide which one to keep ;)

Really?? That's like Nike selling Adidas, or Adidas selling Nike, on their own homepage as 'alternatives'...!! 😂 

Regardless, @onloop I caved and ordered another UNITY on top of my pre-order from Aug, plus a couple of focbox as spares (as you do). Do pre-orders get shipped at the same time as BF deals ? From this allocated stock?

Left message on order form saying I'm fine for focboxs to ship with the UNITY(s) when they're ready, so just curious how this will play out....

Was looking at getting a couple of VESCs and a remote for an upgrade to my Bamboo GT, been checking around for several days and then yesterday morning looked at focbox again and bam!! Sale. Cool perfect timing. Happy with the deal so the normal "who gives a f##k about black friday" became "Yey Black friday rules" :):metal:
Well just this once.

Made the R-Spec drive purchase. I'm hoping they won't break in 40 miles like my last 8 sets (10 including a private purchases). Really hope they ship within the 7-10 days instead of the 3-6 months like last year. We'll see I guess. Testing integrity at this point.

If 40 miles per motor is it's lifetime, then yeah dude. But from what I've seen (video incoming. tomorrow is sunny) with the latest silver motors, anything over 25a per motor stalls on full throttle and is enough to throw a person off. Testing to see if my assumptions about your testing/qc is correct at the moment. Because we're only 1 set out of 10 so far.

I have a pile of Enertion motors (because I’ve diligently supported your company for a few years) in my home and none of them work right.
[/quote]


Your definitely a unique character bro!

Yeah I acknowledge it, we have sent you SO much hardware, we also trusted that you could make the stuff we sent you work as intended, which in hindsight was a mistake as some assemblies have specific requirements. Either way, according to you, literally none of our products work! (Despite the fact hundreds of people have working enertion stuff)

We even sent you a brand new complete board, which doesnt work either? all this done for free under warranty, actually the cost to support you has been significant, we certainly haven't profited from you we are negative profit. 

Please know that we have always listened to your feedback and have continually tried to make improvements based on your experience, thank you for helping us.

But honestly, I don't think we can actually meet your standards! Not at this price point anyways.

......Even now, you continually find "faults" the last complaint was that the quality of the plastic used on the PH connectors was, according to you; "squishy like a gummy bear" - seriously bro we don't have control over the plastic used on ph connectors... lol

You either have really bad luck, totatly suck at building eboards or have such high standards that literally everything you look at is immediately considered inferior.

Now you go and buy more of our "shit" - it just doesn't add up.. lol 

I'm seriously thankful for your new order! Still don't understand it, but I won't refuse it.

Maybe you can slightly readjust your standards and acknowledge that this world you inhabit is not yet perfect.

Our gear isn't 100% perfect, there is plenty of room for improvement, we always work to improve our stuff and if people have problems we always do our best to resolve issues as fast as possible and with minimal if any cost to the customer.

We really need to hire you as our crash test dummie/ beta tester.

Never blamed you Sean. I certainly think we could have fixed your problems quicker though, asking you to do repair work for us was not smart, there are some tricky things that you may not have fully understood and perhaps this has meant more issues than necessary. 

Even our assembly factory had problems building this product, too many highly toleranced parts fitted together is not good design, we have had to make many design changes to ensure assembly of this product is very simple, previously it wasn't which in some cases caused major faults when done incorrectly.

>Sean, If anything you have helped us.

>We know we had issues, and you love to remind us, and we have constantly worked towards fixing them!

At very least you should acknowledge this, or perhaps shift your focus to some positive thoughts you seem to have a heavy bias toward negativity.

You keep jabbing us about faults that were found and resolved from 1 - 2 years ago... it's like giving your adolescence child a hard time for peeing their pants when they were 2 years old. It's not constructive, in fact it is extremely detrimental to our business.

This is really a question for yourself to ask, you are an early adopter of new technology, what is your tolerance?

All I can say is that we haven't given up, we continue to push forward, we continue to make improvements, we continue to grow and we continue to have growing pains and make mistakes... there is also plenty more room for improvement too. 

So, you can choose how this makes you feel, you can choose to focus purely on negative, or perhaps only positive, or maybe take a balanced view. In the end its your own state of mind and your life, it doesn't change our plan.

Also, We allocated 100 focbox unity for the r-spec drive kits, we haven't sold 100 yet. There is a good chance there will be stock available to cover everything.

I really want to agree and believe this to be true most of the time. However, public feedback is vital information for customers. It can get messy and I see why you would recommend this. However, sometimes mentioning it gives you better results especially if others are in the same boat.

 I agree. However, if they don’t respond or ignore you, what can you do? In stock should be in  stock. I fall in the “waiting” group for items in stock that were supposedly shipped. customers should be informed so they can choose the waiting game. Refund not option.

I have 2 that always run.  At least 2.  Never quite managed to get more than that because I always forget some stupid little component that takes 3 years to arrive and have to steal it from another build or I sell one.  I did have 4 running concurrently a month ago but 1 I sold and the other one broke.  Seems 2 is all I can manage.

Edit;  I have 6 if you include the skeletons on the bench.

@sender 🙏 we definitively need your DIY thesis 😌🙏😌 can’t see that drama...
DIY means Don’t Impatient Yourself...
If you want something now on this moment than go to a local shop and buy your things there.
If you order or „pre“ order than just expact some delays for product, shipping, customs and delivery.
We all want our builds to get ready...
And we all pay a fucking lot of money...
So you not alone.
@onloop , @Deodand and @CarlCollins do a very good job with updating people here how things going on. You get more updates than with any other company....
You seriously expect that you get a separated update on your order. Here in the thread?
You made a group buy with 20 unities? 🤔
I guess no...
By the way, enertion has a 24/7 customer service... I think that might be the right place for you to ask @tardyparty7

Take a chill pill little man.  My son is 11 and I would love him to be as keen on this stuff as you are.  He just likes going silly on his scooter.  Tried to get him into it but seriously one thing that he tries to kill himself on is enough.  Sorry about the earlier post i had no idea how old you are.  Not patronising, just an olive branch to keep you in here learning.  Good on you for standing up for yourself.  Just chill now though.  This can be a brutal place.

ok take all we said with a bit a distance...
you 12 and it´s an other story, but in general, just have more patience. you not the only one who wait things and orders and pre orders just take there time. if that´s not your thing, DIY is not your thing.

Man... I would like to have had that much money like you have when i was in your age...
I was delivering news paper with 12 ... made 25$ a week...
no way that Í could afford something like a unity in this age!

@CarlCollins whats the logic in the order numbers? I see some here having the tracking number already while peeps with a lower order number have to wait until January (is it jan as you say? Because anywhere else i read Feb?)
Im #226xx and #216xx. Not trolling, just wondering (i expect 1 of the 2 at least to not have a tracking number due to the discount at that time) also makes it easier to plan my builds.. Thx

@hoeksame1
You have all wheels and shipment is over 1 KG, that's why we have to choose a different shipping channel to ship them securely, 
Current condition is
All of your items are shipped (group buy order)
We haven't got the tracking ID yet due to the different shipping channel

This channel provide safe and steady delivery but sometimes delays the tracking ID>
I already talked with Menno (Group Buy owner) about it.

So I am sure you will get a tracking ID tomorrow
