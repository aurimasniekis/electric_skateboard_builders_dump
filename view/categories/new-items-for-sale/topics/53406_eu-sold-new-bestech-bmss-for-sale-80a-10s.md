Soooo these are left over from a group buy I did that didn't work out as planned because for 3 months Bestech didn't have stock of the ICs needed to manufacture these cutoff voltages:

Over charge detection voltage: 4.20V+/0.025V 
Over charge release voltage: 4.10V+/0.05V 
Over discharge detection voltage; 2.80V+/0.05V 
Over discharge release voltage: 2.90V+/0.1V

I am selling four 10s.

Not sure what you mean. Balancing the pack is the whole point of a bms.

I have seen BMS that only serve as over charge and short circuit protection.

Is it just an ON/OFF switch like in the Evolve GT enclosure that would work with the BMS? If se, I would love to have one of those in 10s shipped to a German address.
