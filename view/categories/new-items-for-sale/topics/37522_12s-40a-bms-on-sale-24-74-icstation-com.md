While looking for some lower amp BMS's for a 25 amp board I am building (because I didn't want to waste a 60a BMS on it) I ended up running into a sale, which ends in about 2 days, at www.icstation.com, and figured i'd share. Compared to batterysupports.com 30a at $39, it seems like a pretty decent deal. 

12S 40a = $24.74

I found a new member discount code of 8% as well = "Newmember". That ended up making it worth paying the $25 for DHL instead of $0.00 air mail which will take 2-4 weeks.

The newmember code?

I added it, then clicked continue and it took off 8%. I bought 5 of them though. I don't recall there being a minimum purchase. If you add 5 to the shopping cart, add the code, and click continue, do you see a $12 +/- discount?

I forgot to add the link to the BMS:

Thanks for the share!

I also searched for a 10S BMS, [here is a deal for $11.24](http://www.icstation.com/polymer-lithium-battery-protection-board-module-with-temperature-protection-p-12157.html) (originally 14.99) 20A. I guess it's a good deal if I'm doing a charging only BMS solution?

Also, when I inputted the code it said it was applied but in the checkout page the price didn't go down for some reason.. there might be a minimum price for it to work?

Just wanted to point out, using a Bestech BMS you get  a built in E-Switch, which saves you $40-$60 as you don't have to buy a Vedder switch (or its variants).  A loop key is always cheaper, just wanted folks to understand the actual savings depending on your build specs.

Hmm I am having a hard time finding a board that allows adding an e-switch. I don't suppose you have a part number for a 12s (doesn't matter the amps) so I can compare with other options?

Sumbitch.

I have the 12S BMS listed above, and didn't even realize I could put an E-Switch on it and already bought vedders.

I'll use that e-switch on the 25a BMS and call it a day. Keeps my costs down. (I am hoping to sell the 25A boards locally. The batteries I got are cheap but are low amps.)

but powering everything via a bms eswitch requires that its powered on during charging, right?

I have the bestech bms in a build but still have a loop key so that I don't need to have the vescs powered on during charge, which for me can take upwards of 6 hrs

good find, I'm in correspondence with donna @ bestech atm about charge-only bms modules but these may work, cheap too....

Yeah, I just read that too. I am weighing the options. I don't know whether that's a bad thing. I guess it's up to the end user.

I am 99% sure i've basically wasted my time putting together battery testers to check capacity (in this specific case), but I am also concerned how accurate my testers are when I do actually need to use them.

I am finding all of the batteries are actually within 5% capacity. A 1950 MAH battery ended up reporting 2050 the next time I tested it, but I believed the charger had charged it to 4.20v without checking it, but I also believed the tested repleated down to 2.80, but I am finding no matter what volt I us, it only brings the cells down to 3.2 and sometimes 3.1v, so there's obvious a variance. 

Now that I am making certain of the before and after voltage, they are all between 2050-2150.

Total waste of a month waiting for parts from China. YAY!

You mean esk8.de? They have a Vedder SparkProtectionSwitch listed for €29.90 ($35 USD).

I'd be happy to buy a few at $25, if you know where I can find them. I'd honestly rather do that than have to keep the board on to charge it.

Plus € 4.77 / $5.53 USD.

We're right back at $40 via the http://www.hellray.de site (I was redirected to it via the "shop" link on eSk8.de

That's still cheaper than $60+shipping though

Actually, I am wrong there. The original €29.90 included the vat. My bad. Still a better deal.

I thought I bought these, and ended up realizing I never finished the transaction. Went back 10 days ago and finished the purchase.... and they have still not shipped yet.

I don't think I will be buying anything from them again. This is redic. Glad I paid for DHL. At least i'll get them this year.

They received payment 10 days ago. They have yet to ship it. Not to be confused with "not be delivered yet", they haven't even processed the order.
