Jens, I am totally interested... question though... you think if I get these motor mounts from you + the 60-65 tooth wheel that Trampa will be putting out for a Superstar/Hypa hubs... it will work with the 125mm gummies?

I have your mini direct drive and I think they will likely be too big for the 125mm gummies and may ground rub as the gummies wear.
```

Hey 
The Mini Direct Drive is build for the Gummies !
Outer Diameter is 95mm so you got alot clearence for the 125mm Gummies.

If this Beltdrive fit with 60thooth i dont think so...
Working on some 44 Pulleys for 107mm Flywheels, will look for compatible ....

Good timing. Looks like the JTAG BMS is getting close to completion, and the motors from APS just shipped after being on backorder for 10weeks. Might get this build finished in time for summer (Australian summer) afterall üòÅ.

I will take a set of your motor mounts for the Trampa Street Carver -- I am going to try those MBS 100mm black wheels. Something to f around with until gummies start shipping.

If you still have in stock, please send me a Paypal for 294‚Ç¨ (you have my info) ;)

Thanks @Sender

Depends on which 6374 ... 
you know they sometimes just wrong labeled like Turnigy SK3-6374 which are 5984 

But in generall i tend to no it will not fit
Check this picture :

I get some Motors this week which will have similar dimension as the Aliens.
I will check whats work in the actually version

In generall i realized that the original Trampa pulleys are super wide : 
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/c/6c133ad68e69a5b8ce77f44ad20172432f16cb9d.JPG" width="666" height="500">

The left is the @Titoxd10001 pulleys,
 so if you decide to go with a pulley design like this i could do some wider Braces for more clearence 

Here you see how much you can gain with regular sized pulleys : 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/1/b144c305c1526ec5884643f6e37ea9f60c990fb8.JPG" width="666" height="500">

Okay i also used some speedrings to bring out the wheels more, using some milimeters of the threads.

Here are some pulleys i made today, its 44thooth for bigger wheels like Abec 107mm and Trampa Gummies : 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/d/adf5ccae79d644a9cd4cd7a0f6438f855794345b.JPG" width="666" height="500">

For Trampa Gummies i combined the pulley with "Hub Adapters" from the Direct Drive
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/2/72897804ec24e8b6bcbf96d36912a91dbb8a7235.JPG" width="666" height="500">

By using this bigger wheelpulleys the use of the Idler is really tight/ not good...
Running it without : 

Gummies on Superstar on this Beltdrive :

Just my luck - you come up with all this extra-special sheet after I place my order..lol 

Please let me know when you have those for sale - I will take a set of the 44T abec and a 44T set for the gummies.  

Also if possible can you send me a can of `Total Power Grease` with those (4) pulleys - if you are allowed to ship it to the US.  I found they have it on amazon.de for about ‚Ç¨14.50 but they want ‚Ç¨50 for shipping!!!

Thanks

yeah sorry this continious improving of stuff/parts have to come to an end :joy:

Cant ship this Total Power Grease, but dont stick to this to much Dude.
Any Acidfree quality grease will work, you will not kill the gears :sunglasses:

For the Abec107 i think this 44 is really nice size...
For Gummies maybe 50T would even nicer, could be mounted direct without "Adaptor"

Yeah as long your wheelpulley isnt bigger then 40T it works very nice with the Idler.

Yap is ok Dude.
What would you prefer for the Gummies ? 
44T on Hubadapter 
OR
50T direct for the Superstar Hub?

I like the 44T with hub adapter is better for the street carver mount i think and the belt/motor pulley. 

You mentioned that 50T is nicer?

But, I'll let you make recommendation and go with that.

Nicest for full function in meaning of a mounted Idler is to go with not more then 40T
Give me some days, i will come up with differnt options...

And my order too when it's ready -- do let me know (just a reminder :slight_smile:)

1) 2 x hub adapters
2) 2 x 44T pulley for gummies
3) 2 x 44T pulley for Abec 107 mm 
4) 2 x retainer ends #3
5) screws

Thanks! 

Actually wanted to convert my mini direct drive on my carver to work with my E-MTB trucks + Holypro.  The plan is move the mini direct drive to the E-MTB and use the street carver mount on the carver board setup. But I will leave that for the future so you aren't overwhelmed.

This are your parts, some more screws not pictured (-;
send ya an Invoice/request

Yeah lets seperate the new wishes from the actual order (-;
All you need is an machined MTB Hanger... if you go with INFINITY or VERTIGO or ULTIMATE its up to you... order from Trampa, let ship to my place, i mill the surfaces and ship to you...20‚Ç¨ machining +shipping

sounds good ?

Got your invoice. Payment sent!  

I already have INFINITY trucks -- Let me think about what to do with hangar -- maybe ship mine to you and then you machine it and send it back.  Or maybe it's just cheaper to ship from Trampa to you and I will have a spare one.  I will also need 2 x 10mm motor shaft gears to move the direct drive to the E-MTB.   My 6374 APS are 10mm motor shaft.

BTW, the parts look sweet -- thank you again :)

Sorry if this is obvioous, but would there be any issues running the gummies with 50t pulley along with your mini direct drive?

Mini Direct Drive is a Spur gear system.
The 50t pulley is a Belt drive system.
Its not compatible with each other.

There's the obvious part, I am an idiot.  So that means that you could run the gummies with the mini direct drive? Or would there be ground clearance issues?

No problem Dude,
in the end i build the mini direct drive for the gummies :yum:

Its more then enough ground clearence for a street setup IMO , smaller then the Hub

Look :

@gogomrrobot
shipping your hanger from US could be to expensive...

Yes it's $66 one way from the US -- way too expensive.  I will wait a week or two (to give my wallet a rest) then have the trucks sent from Trampa to you.

These mounts and pulleys came. They look and ride really well. Been blasting thru the urban jungle here in the ATL.

Everything from Jenso is just so well engineered. You can run abec 107's with these, slicks, gummies and of course pneumatics as well ;)

The gummies run like velvet so smooth and they run over just about everything

I was worried the anodisation would cover up those glorious tool marks, but they're still visible üòé. The mounts look awesome in their raw finish, but everything else is black and my colour coordination skills are poor...

The guys at the anodisation factory were pretty happy with the 7075 these are made from. I couldn't tell them what the Trampa centring rings were made from though, so they got classified as 'cheese' grade aluminium making the batch unsuitable for hard anodisation (the rings may dissolve).

Don't ever leave @Nowind üòÇ. These mounts are a bloody work of engineering art.

Yeah, can't recommend enough Jens @nowind work. It's masterpiece and worth every cents. You should also look at his last direct drive helical video. You just cannot be better than him at what he does best : innovate and have a blast.
