Certainly one of the finest examples of Enertion's breakthrough design available for sale, anywhere in the world.

Purchased here on our forum from a fellow professional for $1200, plus PayPal fees, plus insured shipping fees; asking the same.

Trade offers for similar condition stuff happily considered :) 

EXAMPLE, I'll add $1300 cash for a KingSong 18XL (black or white)

Specifically seeking GoPro Hero7 and GoPro Karma Grip.

Thanks all :)

As they say in The Road Warrior, it's the last of the Interceptors. :dark_sunglasses: 

I had planned on upgrading it to the new Raptor 2.1 drivetrain with a Unity...

Hope it finds a good home. :)

Its a classic and as such should stay as is.  Built in australia in a garage by a lunatic.

@topcloud

I am located in the Bay Area and will buy it from you. 

I have an OG Raptor, but it doesn't hurt to have a backup board and of course will be in excellent hands. 

Feel free to direct message me otherwise.

:slight_smile:  if @MatrixWriter is a friend of the fam...  I'll throw in a brand-new set of Surf Rodz TKPs unmounted (black and green) (2018 SR Summer Specialz colorway), free.  Very happy this could go to an R1 driver.
