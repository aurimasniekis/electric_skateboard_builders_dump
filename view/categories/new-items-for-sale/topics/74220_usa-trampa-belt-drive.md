![image|375x500](upload://hbRs0sDple7hZTJTM8PQveVCnBu.jpeg) Hello everyone,
I’m clearing out some extra items from my shop so I am selling my drives. The were mocked up once but never ridden or even spun with a motor. I know that they are 1 generation old so the price should reflect that. 

Comes with 2 motor mounts, 2 belts, 2 wheel gears and the motor “cages”
The only thing that isn’t included is a motor gear which can be bought for $5 from eBay or trampa.

can you post a pic of the other side of the wheel pulley?  I want to see how difficult it would be to mod to work on SR RKP's.
