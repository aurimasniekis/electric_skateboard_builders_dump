How much for a set of black wheels shipped to France?

Edit : Would you make a price for 2x wheels? I need to match 2x 90mm hubs.

No, I sourced them to keep the costs down. Maytech are not that cheap imo

Whats the weight on these things?

I am building a single belt drive 6s2p and want it under 5 kilos total so weight is a priority :slight_smile:

They are quite nice imo, not quite in the same class as abec’s but better than any other clones I’ve tried. Hopefully some people will be able to offer their opinion after trying them. 

I am confident people will be happy with the feel of the wheels and the price too. 

👍🏻

The pulleys that are on the way, allu wheel and steel motor? Hard to gauge from price but they included?

About 1 kg, I will double check when I get home. 5kg?  that’s not much weight to go round. I do like the idea of light weight commuters

Yes alu wheel and steel motor. I haven’t finalised exact price yet. But about £15-£17 for a set (1 motor pulley and 1 wheel pulley) they are a few weeks away still, on a boat somewhere 😕

Plenty, I won’t be running out anytime soon. Buying a few helped me keep the costs down. Just need to sell them now 😂

The wheels came in

These are absolutely incredible for the price. If abecs and caguamas are 10/10, these are a solid 8 for a 1/3rd of the price.

snap these up before the sell out :slight_smile:

97s or 107s/110s possible from your supplier? I think you'd have a much bigger market for those
