Recently I rebuilt my Raptor 1 and decided to hex grip it. I hand cut way too many hexagons and had just enough to cover another lid. I had a new lid that I will not be able to use anymore and decided to grip it as well. 

Just seeing if any Raptor 1 riders would like to update their board. 

Keep in mind that this is their 10 Non countersunk hole lid. It’s that fiberglass one that doesn’t interfere with RF
