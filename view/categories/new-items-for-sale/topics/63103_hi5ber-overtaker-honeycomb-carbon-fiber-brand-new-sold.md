Hello,

I am selling a new Hi5ber overtaker. It has the honeycomb carbon fiber weave. I had originally planned to build a carvon board but decided to go 4wd. The board cost me $290 with the honeycomb weave. Ill sell it for $200 bux plus shipping. Brand new.

I’m going to drop the price to $170 to bring attention to this. That’s $120 less than I payed and it’s still in the box brand new.
