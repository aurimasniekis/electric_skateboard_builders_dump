Some of you may know I made this enclosure for my board a week or so ago. 
I made a mould for it to make them out of fibreglass. 
It seems a shame not to use the mould again, would one of these enclosures would be of interest to anyone?
If not this one would it be worth my while making another mould for a different shape or size?
I've got a 10s4p, large BMS and two older enertion VESCs tucked in here. It's easy enough to drill and Dremel to put switches and plugs etc in and can be made in any colour. 
I have contoured it to the shape of my deck but I used foam rubber to take up the inconsistencies in a different shaped deck.
The flange was left large on this one but could be cut down considerably.
The external sizes of the enclosure are 550mm x 150mm x 45mm + whatever size flange.
¬£45 for a bare enclosure in a solid colour plus postage at cost to wherever you are.

cool case! I would have definitely been interested had I not already ordered from @psychotiller this week

it's great to have a potential new UK based enclosure supplier!

I definitely think you should do boosted style enclosures too for people with flexible boards.

I'm about to get a vanguard or a clone and I'll be having battery up front, ESCs at the back...

How'd this process work ? Do you think you could make a mold of my split style enclosures ?

It's possible to do that but it'd seem a shame to rip off someone else's work?
Isn't there a lot of unusable space in an enclosure like this? More form over function? I'm thinking about making a two part so any guidance on sizes would be good.

Mhmm I made it to the exact dimensions of my 6s4p and the other side would be 4s4p+single vesc/switch/display/plug. But I could design the front one to fit an 10s4p. Similar to @Eboosted enclosures. Would be nice to have a split style option in the EU/UK. 

Would you need the part to be hollow ? How is the mould process working ?

I made the plug (the shape i wanted for the outside of the enclosure) from wood then built up primer coats. Then rubbed it down and polished it. Fitted it to the board with wax for the radiuses and made the mould from this.

Hey Dave, since I'm all crippled, I haven't shipped your enclosure yet, while I appreciate your business, I see you like that other enclosure. Did you want a refund to buy the local one? If not, I'll ship tomorrow.

sorry to hear you are "all crippled" at the moment @psychotiller - hope you get back to fully operational capacity soon.

thanks for the update on the enclosure. I'm good to wait, if you could send when you get a chance that would be awesome.

@bigben how does fibreglass deal with deck flex? i seem to remember reading somewhere its not a good combo  ?

In my opinion fiberglass enclosures handle flex better than abs but nice abs enclosures are much more easier to produce.  When abs cracks it's game over but when fiberglass cracks it still holds tight thanks to fibers. But with shape of enclosure you can affect how well it flex.

The enclosure is rigid, I've mounted mine on 8mm foam rubber so there is a bit of give there. My battery won't flex so best that my deck is reasonably rigid too!
Fibreglass will flex without braking though. I made my kids a few boards and they've held up well. I don't know if you remeber the older fibreflex boards? Some of them were solid fibreglass.

With as many abs enclosures as I've sold I'd think I would have heard if there were issues with them cracking... even if they did though liquid abs cement would fix it.   
Both abs and fiberglass can be flexible.

I've found ABS glues really well with the right cement/glue. Also you can hot weld it.

A plus with the fibreglass enclosure that sticking in other components like an XT90-s with epoxy is easy peasy!

Those double kingpin trucks' shape are suitable to any of the motor mounts on market or did you make a motor mount yourself?

I cheated and found evolve hangers with their mounts. 
I'd probably go with @psychotiller wide trucks if I built another one.
The double kingpins don't feel inspiring at over 25mph so I'm waiting for some different bushings to arrive.

Started making another mould to make another enclosure to fit the landyachtz deck I've just got. The mould I made first time was made for a deck with a very different shape to this one so, I made an enclosure from the existing mould then cut it down to fit the contour of the new deck. I stuck it down to the deck on tape then waxed it up and added a fillet of wax around the edge. The blue bit is the first coat of gel to make the mould. I've now got the first coat of fibreglass on the mould so I'll build it up to thickness on Monday. Possibly get the first new enclosure out of the mould a little later in the week. For this build I'm thinking of using 5x 2s lipos with a BMS which should fit in perfectly.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/b/cbc71f4fb43348e51756376b1dab3315f81b5897.JPG" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/0/7087bf2538b4a21190210b1638a7316e87c58511.JPG" width="375" height="500">

Hey, Im in the process of making a fiberglass enclosure. Ive got my wooden shape made but im kinda confused about the order of making the final enclosure. I know if I covered the wood with fibreglass the inside would be smooth and the outside rough... so, am I suppose to make a fibreglass mould from the wood, then use that mould to make the final part (as the shape has now inverted)? OR, is the mould made from that blue stuff then the fibreglass is put into that?
```

Hi,
What I do is, once I have the wood shape I coat it in a a primer. Then rub it down and polish it to a high gloss. This is the finish you will have on your enclosure so the more time you take with this the better! Then wax it with mould release wax 6 times or so with an hour in between coats. 
Then you see the blue stuff which is just gelcoat and layers of fibreglass which makes the mould. After that you can make an enclosure from your mould. It‚Äôs a long process!
Good luck. Send me some photos if you can, I‚Äôd be interested to see them. 
Cheers
Ben

Im looking for an enclosure thats 465mm max. Im in UK and Ive tried kydex... heatgun not ideal. Crinkled corners. Pretty crap looking. Ive also bought 3 different planter trays. Ive looked all over and Im kinda struggling to find anything I can use/buy. Ill have a 10s4p in there with a small BMS and single VESC. I cant believe this is the hardest part of the build! lol.

Would go nicely with the 30mm enclosure made to fit this deck.

Awesome enclosure, pretty sure it would survive being run over by a car. The rest of the deck wouldn't survive mind :smiley:

It's Bens low profile enclosure, was able to squeeze in 2 x 5000mah 3S and AlienPowerSystems ESC all inside.

There are so many things I want to ask about in this picture...

What made you choose to mount everything up front?
Have you had any issues with the insanely long phase wires?

I leave it at that,  Interesting build, kudos.

Batteries are mounted up front to distribute the weight for carrying.

Not have any side effects of having long phase wires so far, what sort of issues do people tend to have with them?

```
Long phase wires lead to desyncs..


However the lower the kv the longer the phase wires can be as the delta is larger because the bell spins slower. It also depends on the refresh rate of the esc... A 1000hz esc will desync alot easier then a 32khz esc...
