I think @Mikenopolis might have been after one of these if I remember right. And he has a big head so it might be the right size too.

I doubt you got the new version (will be available from this September I suppose).
Shockwave from last season had a confirmed sizing issue:

Contact Ruroc, they will send you new version (which is supposed to be better fit) when it becomes available.
