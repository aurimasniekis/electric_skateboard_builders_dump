2 brand new Flipsky 6.6 VESC. I purchased these from the Hummie group buy a few months back, for a build that never happened. I opened one package to look at the VESC, but that is all. Nothing missing and never used. The other package is unopened. 

$100 + shipping per or $190 + shipping for both.

shipping should be at least $50 from California to Australia with the cheapest option by USPS. Global Express (1-3 bus) > Priority Express ( -5 bus) > Priority (6-10 bus).

Do you guys ever use parcel monkey? On the face of it you could get a 1lb parcel shipped from US to Australia for $20 with DHL?
