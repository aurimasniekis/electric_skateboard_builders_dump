Hey all,

I've got 2 unused VESC's laying around here. Originally wanted to use them in a Trampa build but figured a FOC-box would be a better option for the situation.

They're from  and haven't been powered on a single time.
Firmware 2.18, together for â‚¬175

Shipping within the EU, buyer pays shipping. I'm located in the Netherlands.
