I’d take them both if I can sell a set of psychotiller’s 5065 220kv motors. Only been on bench, I had issues with motor detection, but I think it might have been bunk ESCs. 

I can’t keep accumulating parts, but 2 in, 2 out is good. 

I’m in SD, I know at least one person on this thread was interested in them. 

I’ll run detection, list them on forum. I’ll be your back up buyer in a week if not sold.
