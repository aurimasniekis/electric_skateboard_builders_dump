We have been working to put a line of affordable MBS  eMTB KITS and PREBUILT to offer the community. With all the high dollar options we thought it would be nice to have some MORE AFFORDABLE options to offer in general and in the kits.

We also wanted to use as may small DIY vendors as possible to help the community and keep something here.  MBS has been a standard in the MTB world, and have taken notice of what we do here. Maytech has as well. With these two big manufacturers, we have added @hyperIon1 battery packs, @Idea gears and mounts, @Eboosted enclosures, and @hyperIon2 building skills to bring you 5 eMTB kits with a prebuilt option for all 5 kits.  

Each kit is different and offers different levels of riding and investment.  
  All the components are available and tested here on the forum, nothing to design or wait for manufacturing. Kits will ship in weeks and prebuilt orders longer depending on the log. wait time will be determined at the time of order.

We have 5 in production now awaiting parts

OUR GOAL

We have always wanted to bring 3 core eliments together. 

QUALITY in the products we sell and use.

AFFORDABILITY in not overcharging people for quality 

SERVICE in backing the products we sell and use with quick response times on PM, emails and phone calls. We do not leave you to the manufacturer if a product has an issue. We do our best to replace it for you and deal with the manufacturer after. 


Everything will be up on the website soon. 

I will also gather photos of the components to post and soon we will have our DEMOs ready. 

We welcome your thoughts and commits

This is awesome to hear. I have the mbs colt 90 already built out and absolutely love the final product. That's a great price point too. 

@hyperIon1 battery, @idea motor mount, @mbs bones

@hyperIon1 has always been top notch when it comes to helping the community with builds. I am glad they took the step into prebuilts. 

They are helping me finish my MBS.  I will always recommend them as their customer service is fucking legit!

I know it, Its definitely a breath of fresh air.  We are slowly trying to build a community here in Texas. I also have a great line of suppliers and I also handle all the repairs for enertion Rraptors in the lower states and soon the entire USA. I have contacts for motors, CNC products and 3D printables. Hit me up and maybe we can help each other......

 

just text before you call
