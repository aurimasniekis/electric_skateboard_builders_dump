I made this enclosure for[ my latest carbon fiber mini cruiser build](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/a2esk8-mini-cruiser-30-carbon-fiber-deck-single-carvon-v2-hub-motor-12s1p-lifepo4-vesc/5543) so figured I'd throw it up in the marketplace if anyone is interested in building this kind of battery system. I find LiFePO4 cells have smoother, more efficient discharge power and are the safest type of lithium batteries as they will not overheat, and even if punctured they will not catch on fire. The cathode material in LiFePO4 batteries is not hazardous, and poses no negative health or environmental hazards. Due to the oxygen being bonded tightly to the molecule, there is no danger of the battery erupting into flames like there is with lithium-ion. I'd recommend this strictly for mini cruisers and small builds. The Apone V1 is designed to house up to 12 A123 26650 LiFePO4 Cells, a BMS, voltage display, power switch, charge port, a single VESC and a standard 2.4ghz receiver. Motor holes and edge trim are optional.

Exterior Measurements: L: 13.5" W: 7.5" H: 2"
Internal Measurements: L: 11" W: 5" H: 1.75"

@RunPlayBack Do you have any tutorials or videos on the making of your battery pack?

I haven't made one yet but @treenutter has a nice thread on building battery packs. It's super helpful and inspired me build my own pack.
