sept 8 edit - sale of these mounts is being suspended as they're nearly gone and keeping some on hand for contingency reasons. thank u all for purchasing. 

-

Starting a new, normal buy thread for these motor mounts I took over from Shogu12 out of the original group buy.  You can see the original thread [here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eu-us-22-carbon-motor-mounts-anodized-aluminum-clamp/20795).

I'm reselling these at $34 for the complete set, with $3 shipping within the US, $10 Canada, $13 rest of the world.

Also selling complete hardware set for $5 shipped within the US, for those of us who got these mounts with wrong sized hardware.

I'm using Nylock nuts for the clamp and arm bolts.

[**`PLEASE USE THIS FORM TO ORDER`**](https://goo.gl/forms/M4n6VvrsndOa7N7c2).

You don't even have to alert me once the payment is sent and form is submitted, I'll be on top of it.  But feel free to drop me a PM as a reminder.

I can confirm this fits both the normal Caliber II trucks, and Torqueboard's 218mm caliber clones whose hangar is just slightly larger than normal trucks.

[/quote]

i'm not sure, i had 50, 10 are already called for and it's been a solid two days since i got everything in.

don't think it'll continue selling at this rate but doubt i'll have these forever either.

For those who've paid and I promised shipping today, I'm sorry it'll have to be sent tomorrow. 

I was tied up at work and couldn't make the post office. 

I had everything ready to go, just need to drop them off at the post office:

i think the holes are for an idler, if you're into that.

the black bolts are what shogu sent.  the stainless steel bolts are what i got in their place.  you can use either, and have extras for fun.

the stainless steel bolts are sized correctly since top bolt hole is longer than the bottom.

The extra holes are for the pulley cover. There's supposedly a shape file around d for 3s printing g but I can't find d it.

Tnx.
I found some design flaw. 2 Mounting bolts and nuts are incredibly hard to access when hanger is on base. I strugled much before i realize to remove the base plate. Silly me.
Second, when u push carbon plate all the way in it rubs against the hanger.
Third 255mm belt is impossible to use with 36t 15t gears.
Extra: impossible to get thicker than 15mm belt on these mount with original 10" caliber. Either have to mod, or need extended ver.

Um im little worry that the carbon part might slide and belt loose its tention. Although i tighten it with long arm ranch

Just wanted to mention the mount works great with stock caliber and the 15/36 pulley set with 15/265mm belt being sold by @johnny_261, no modifications necessary

Here you will find ZIP with design files for this mount. I included pulley cover I designed from [here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/enertion-like-motor-mount-clone/31561/39?u=silentexception) and stuff Shogu12 made. Have fun!
