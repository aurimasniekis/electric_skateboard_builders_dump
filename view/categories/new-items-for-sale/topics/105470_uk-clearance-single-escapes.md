Doing house clearance and since no longer have time for esk8 i have for sale:

6 x (never used) single ESCapes, recently tested and with 3.66 firmware with black anodised housing
£100 each or £190 for 2 plus shipping

I also have a variety of ICs and other electronic components that populate the ESCape if anyone is interested.

Hi Stewii, I could definitely use those components and maybe a few pcbs.
Ive been working up a stock pile to have them populated en mass.

@stewii Do you have a pair of single aluminum cases or one dual case? I've got a couple ESCapes that have the OG 3D printed cases and would love to upgrade them to aluminum or even better, one of the heat sink cases.

Do you know if this only applies to the ESCapes or the ESCapes, housings, and various IC’s @banjaxxed?

@berno3 if you ever see ESCapes anywhere for sale, they will be sold in less than 5 mins. I am happy owner of a pair for more than a year and a half and they are perfect.

Okay got ya! That is good to know. However, I was wondering if anyone knows whether @stewii also got rid of all the extra IC’s and housing he had for the ESCapes? I was able to get some PCBs for the ESCape and was hoping to get a deal on the components
