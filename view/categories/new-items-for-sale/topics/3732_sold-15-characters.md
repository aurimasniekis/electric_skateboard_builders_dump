This goes for $350 on the CarvON site with a build time of 1-2 WEEKS.
Save $50 and don't wait 1-2 weeks.
**$300 shipped conus**
I've decided to make all my builds with pneumatic tires after going too slow over a crack and falling for the millionth time. Make my loss your gain.
Also, funds from this will go toward the last few parts I need for my Urban Beast build.

what kind of pneumatic build are you thinking? like a mountain board? or the more smaller scaled 5-6in tires? Also if you happened to find some good 5-6in pneumatic tires, mind letting me know? I've been trying to find a replacement for my 5in pneumatic as the hubs aren't spinning very well.

I know @psychotiller designed wheels around that size, so he might be able to hook you up. I'm using 8in pneumatics and my build will be more of a commuter board rather than offroad build (even though it will easily ride off road). It's kinda like the new Evolve GT carbon.
My custom deck is almost done :slight_smile: so I'll be updating the build thread soon.

how used is used? do you have a picture? I would be interested but I need to know what the condition of the wheels are in first. My current set of 5in pneumatic were bought used and they turned out to be unsatisfactory with the hubs spinning out of sync and tires and tubes all messed up.
