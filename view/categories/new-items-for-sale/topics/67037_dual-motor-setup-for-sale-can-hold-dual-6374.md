I like what Dicky is doing here. I've messaged him and suggested sending a couple of these out to respected forum members to bash and review.

Dicky is the type of gentleman that could finally make budget builds decent and reliable.

That's amazing, my motor mounts cost more than this whole set alone and im pretty sure most people on here share the same sentiment.

I donâ€™t think people would mind receiving the parts and do the assembly themselves as long as that set up can be used with 6374 you should be able to sell the parts. Trucks with longer axles would probably be popular here.

I think I saw they were 216mm but not 100% sure on that. And I've yet to apply loctite on my "For Science" build I wanted to test how tight the Paris mounts actually were - I'm pleasantly surprised they've not moved at all.

this truck is a paris clone, with 205mm hanger,  49mm axis let out on both side.   so you could consider it as a 235mm hanger truck.  very suitable of putting a bearing inside a wheel pulley.

quality not particular good, but is ok. paris clone, you know...

No, this plastic pulley are enbedded with the wheel, can not replace. need to replace the whole wheel if needed.  if want it replacable, can use my aluminum wheel pulley, but more expensive.
