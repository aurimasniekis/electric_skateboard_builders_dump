Supply and demand? 
Sure you can order one right now.
When will you get it tho? 
Yeah price is high but some people are impatient. 
Or maybe it never sells

The kind of guy who would pay $400 for a Unity, today, is the sort of builder who'll want to be "first" to install it into his Acton Q4tro, and halfway through a weekend, discover he needs a second Unity.

This is Enertion's forum with a big banner ad at the top for Unity, and, as the others have stated, the kind of buyer you're looking for is on Reddit and to a lesser extent, eBay.

Good luck to you, I am sure you can sell it for that price elsewhere.

Respectfully, that's bullshit.  Here's why...

1.  This is a community of builders.  Everyone on this forum should have the single minded purpose of learning and helping others learn, and helping others to build.  
2.  The vendors we have are fair and typically bend over backwards to help, and mostly they sell stuff we cant get anywhere else.  Those that don't do this aren't around for very long.

Beyond all that, this guys is trying to make a quick buck.  That's fine, whatever.  But it is not in line with the spirit of this community, and I for one will not be helping him when it is build time.

I disagree with that. While I believe everyone should *aspire* to help everyone out, no one should be dogged to do so. It's like open source vs closed source , while open source benefits the community, a developer should not be dogged on for wanting to keep his work closed source and sell it as the price they want to. What determines if they should succeed or fail is how people take this and what people are willing to pay. This guy offering to sell the unity at whatever price he wants infringes on one, especially when there are other cheaper avenues to buy it. If a buyer thinks the price is unreasonable , then they have the full right and capacity to negotiate to a more reasonable price. If they decide to not to the research and buy the thing at such a price , then it's their own fault, not the guy , not the community , theirs.

True , most do indeed. But this guy ain't necessarily a vendor , he's a guy that willing to sell the unity at a price it will never reach. He has no obligation to the community to sell at their want, morally, or guidelines wise as far as I'm aware and in exchange the community has no obligation to buy from him. As long as he ain't forcing anyone to do anything , then _he_ isn't doing anyone wrong.

That's just how first come first served works. Everyone had the equal opportunity to buy from enertion, what one does to what one decides to purchase is no ones fault. It sucks for the people who ended up being in the second batch yes, but let's not act like he's the reason they ordered after him or that he should feel bad/responsible for it.

I think if there's someone who needs this ***badly*** then they will be very happy and appreciative that it's available ***in-stock right now*** and that they could pay extra to get it now.  Anyone who cares about price can just order from enertion.

Not trying to prove it's incorrect , I'm just saying I disagree. I don't see it as a asshat move because he doesn't have an obligation to sell it at any price. Hell it could be the last unity on earth and he *still* doesn't have an obligation to sell it at any price but what he decides. And it's all because like *he* doesn't have to set it at a reasonable price *we* don't have to buy it.

I always think it’s funny when people get offended by prices. If it’s too much, it sits. This situation isn’t unique to esk8. Launch models of specialty cars get marked up, limited edition shoes, etc. If he bought the entire first batch then came here selling them at $400 then I’d see your point @mmaner but sounds like he bought one and changed his mind. If someone will give him $400 for it and he can buy the prebuilt he wants then who cares. Buyer got a unity without waiting and seller gets cash for the board he wants.  

There’s no right or wrong here so if you think he’s a douchebag, agree to disagree.

Lol @ everyone losing their minds.

Why would he sell it below market price? (market price for the first batch selling RIGHT NOW not determined yet) That's like throwing away money. 

If he bought 10 and is selling all at a markup my feelings would be different. Clearly not the case though.

I'm receiving one for free and am willing to sell for 2000 euro's excluding shipping. I'm in first batch and will send it within 2 months of receiving it. Don't like it? GO HOME.

Still helping anyone I can on this forum, it's the kind of guy I am.

Hey guys still kinda new here but can you keep this thread on track so you don't discourage buyers? Its obvious that you can click the link to the exertion site and see that it currently sells for 300 so if someone wants to buy it at 400 thats their business :smile:

Sure it’s his thing and nobody is forced to buy it.
Just it’s not the spirit we need in here.
People help each other and sell things for a fair price and don’t use a actual short in production to make fast moneys...
People here sent each other stuff for free just because they want to help.
People write long build threads to help each other for free.
People sitting here hours and answering questions for free to help others get there build ready and don’t burn down there house.
That’s what this forum is about.
Not the „hey I have something I know you want, so give me all your moneys and it is yours“ attitude.
Look up the secret santa thread and you will understand which people are here and than hopefully you understand which people should better spend there presents in other places.

I dig it, no worries here.  My issue with the price is that (im reasonably sure) he got it free and is no reselling it for an abnormally high profit, coupled with the fact that he's never really contributed anything.  

I feels like taking advantage to me, but I'm sensitive to these things.  Anyways, I'm done wit it, all is good.
