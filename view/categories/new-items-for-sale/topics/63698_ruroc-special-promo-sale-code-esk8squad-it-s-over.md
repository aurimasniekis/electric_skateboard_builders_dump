Shipping is not "free". Is this something that needs to be fixed or was that a miscommunication? @Michaelinvegas 


My total came out to $205 shipped

To get $185 shipped, Ruroc would have to make the code 28.82% off

Woohoo! Just ordered. Thanks @michaelinvegas! You ruROCK! :metal:

Onyx is fine. Just wanted to make sure the Chrome wasn't available. Probably too flashy for me anyway. This one still looks very Vader, so I'm good with that. üëç That hydrodipping is pretty awesome though.

Don't these helmets get hot?? They're made for snowboarding, how would they do in 90+ degree weather?  they look awesome though, but not sure about the comfort part.

Also the RG1-DX is still $326 WITH the code :(  Only the boring black onyx is $185

Haha my bad.  Honestly I want the chrome one just cuz it looks sick, but that one is still $300+.  I would have paid $185 for it.  Their website also states they are launching a new line sept 1st, wonder if they will have further discounts on the older models.

Checked with them yesterday about the code and this is their response.

Extra codes but the website payment seems down.. 

ruroc loves the support spam.  All from sending one email saying the website payment was down.
One email requesting i signup for zendesk and another 3 all saying my message was received.

As I mentioned yesterday‚Ä¶ its done‚Ä¶

No one should be trying to purchase using the code unless I personally tell them, it‚Äôs ok.

If I do give someone a pass‚Ä¶ that up to ME and Ruroc. Shouldn‚Äôt it?

If I have a helmet in my basket from the first hour the deal went live with the coupon code still showing as valid when I woke up this morning, what say do you have if I try to buy it or not?

So why are you saying no one should be using the code right after I mention I am unable to get past the payment system of there site?  
And that is with or without a code.  So it has nothing to do with this coupon, shit on there site is just broken.

All I've done was try buy a helmet and when I have had trouble with trying to pay, I've sent a support ticket letting him know there might be something wrong with the payment system.

Of course that‚Äôs fine.......

The hammering I am Referring to is in relation to the code not working...not if his site is online.

So...

I am sure he will fix it... I think he maybe a little tied up shipping out all the orders that we Just crushed him with....

He will fix it.

The site is a little wonky. But just the payment and checkout parts. Seems crazy that it's so hard to actually give them money.

Honestly all he really needs these days is like a BigCartel site and use that... definitely would make his life simple rather than trying to figure the back end
