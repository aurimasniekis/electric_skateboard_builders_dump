They are the new black ones with the receiver cable/socket soldered to the FOCBOX just like in the photo you posted @fraannk . Man that is a very neat build in that photo

I haven't had a chance to update the images on the website - must do that, thanks for the reminder :)

Isn't that the Raptor 2? I would hope it to be neatly built :)

Hey! You're in my living room! These are from my R2! lol. I have a few of the very first versions (VESC-X's) and now these newer ones in my R2. Here's an older pic of the 1st version Vesc-X in my DIY board for comparison.

oh yeah. so it is! I was too busy staring at the placement of the electronics and the wiring to notice the deck.

I had the chance to try an R2 a few weeks ago, very impressive...

Yes it is! 

Looking even slicker than before and the new soldered RX plug is a great touch.
