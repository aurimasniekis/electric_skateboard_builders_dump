@ajaynagra 

I am not quite sure if things got mixed up a bit (with the other group buy) - in total I was planning to have:

- 1 set of 90MM 75A Wheels
- 1 6374 Motor
- 1 Mini Controller

I hope it is not gone missing with the forms and everything ;-)
As for shipping - would it be possible to get all parts shipped together?

That's right, 40T - 42T would be ideal for 97mm, but it's not a big problem.
Maybe @ajaynagra could tell us if there is possibility for 40T as well.

27.50€ for the wheels

Sorry for the delay

Today i paid so it should arrive tomorrow according the lady on phone.

No need to rush, group buys may take a long time, that's a statement :slight_smile:
Just to know, do you think we can receive the stuff for the 1st week of september? I received an invite from a local longboards maker who builds premium birch decks (250-300 euros each) to check out some stuff he shows on the 12th of november, and I want to blow up his stand with an electric board! Could it be possible?

So in a week or so i should ship your items

## \#204 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2016-10-28T17:38:25.599Z Reads: 107

the evolve 32T pulley fits into orangutan kegals, they have a 33T for flywheels. I've used both with much success. But their flywheel pulley is for genuine flywheels, not clones. 

Basically any pulley designed for flywheel clones will fit flywheels, but not the other way around. In order to get the 33T evolve flywheel pulley to fit into clones i did some extensive dremel surgery. First the teeth had to be shaved down to fit into the spokes. Then i had to chop the belt surface to fit 9mm belts so i could run dual rear motors on caliber trucks.

Hi thanks, it's come to my realisation that I was sent the wrong length m5 bolts, I ordered 50mm and received 35mm. 

I have sent these packages but there's nothing I can do to solve this.

It's not a huge issue since you can still mount the pulley with the 35mm bolts but it means you will have to do it like this:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/4/14ca3c22cdd6a0a2cdc72e91fdcfd16e1ca3388d.jpg" width="375" height="500">

I know it's not ideal and I wish I checked before sending, but if you want to buy the bolts yourself I can help you with that

Got my wheels. They are softer than the Enertion wheels (which are 80a). Already tested them, despite it being cold outside. Love them! Didn't think that 7mm bigger and a bit softer wheels would make such a big difference. Now I can ride waay more comfortably on my shitty roads.

7 inch is the truck length. The axle length is longer. The turning angle seems to be 50 degrees.
@ajaynagra maybe you can get a nice discount for a group buy.

Hi - just planning my first build and depending on price I would be interested in:
Wheels (90mm)
Anti Spark Switch
Remote 
Pulley Kit
VESC
Maybe a motor mount (planning on making this from scratch but happy to buy if price is ok)

I might be interested in a % battery display (planning on 8s2p lipo set up?)

I'm either going to a CNC plywood one designed by @Maxid and make some changes. Or I am going to get a carbon fiber <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/8/18ee12da39ca2cc13a675888b3286ac736e5ece6.jpeg" width="375" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/a/8a62b27923afd5d22b0c23f45c2007c4c0a616ff.jpeg" width="375" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/e/0e720bedbe85d0045b6e3af34c4412c40d6f1a47.jpeg" width="375" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/e/3eaddda52e0067e96d2d0da0b51673988f673695.jpeg" width="375" height="499">

@ajaynagra., I sent you a email at eupolar, saying I did't recive de Items. Half hour later delivery woman showed at home. :slight_smile:

Unfortunately the Esc wasn't included.  :slight_frown:I supposed that while you was playing Tetris triying to fit everything in the box you left it outside by mistake.
