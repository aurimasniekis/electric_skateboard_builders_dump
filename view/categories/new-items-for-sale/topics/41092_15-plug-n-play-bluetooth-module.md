Wassup peeps. Just wanna know how many people would be interested in a ready2go hm-10 bluetooth module for $15+shipping. they are great for troubleshooting, saving some time, changing modes, and just being to lazy to get off and check board voltage (yes, your not the only one 😉). Anyways, it would be a preorder type deal until I could get the funds to keep stock myself. lead time would not be long (less than 2 weeks).
goal is 15 preorders to get this thing rolling. if you preorder but we do not reach the goal, 100% of your $$ **will** be refunded, no questions asked.

click that to preorder!

A little OT, but I've got another potential product idea along these lines.

[Vedder's recently added support for the NRF51822](http://vesc-project.com/node/234) SoC into the VESC Tool (Desktop + Android). Right now it's a little work, you'd have to wire up one of the ebay modules much like you are with the HM-10, and copy the firmware over using a STLink. More details on his [GitHub repo](https://github.com/vedderb/nrf51_vesc). This and a cheap BT 4.0 USB stick, and you should be right to setup your VESC wirelessly. Just an idea...

A quick couple shots of what they will look like!
a few differences - on the ones that will be shipping...
...the heatshrink wont be charred
...the wires will be together (instead of "loose" like in the picture)

I've not used a BT module with my vescs as yet so this will come as a daft question.
Are these modules something like these?

this next run of modules will have clear polyfelin covering the modules, black heatshrink over connections and last but not least, red and black PET braiding over the wires. should look super aggressive and clean (as aggressive and clean as a bluetooth module can look 🤣)

Okay, I'm deffinetly interested in picking up a couple of these modules. Just walk me through it, so I get this module, plug it into my VESC which is running standard 2.18 firmware, open the eSkate VESC app on my phone, and then connect to both vescs at once and change the settings, monitor them, etc. Or can I only connect to one VESC at a time?
And am I missing any steps?
```

---
## \#131 Posted by: GrecoMan Posted at: 2018-01-20T01:13:33.533Z Reads: 96

```
1. Plug in to UART port
2. Open BLDC tool
3. In the PPM tab, change to “PPM and UART”
4. Connect to your phone
5. Open app
6. Hura! You’re done!

pretty sure for dual vesc monitoring you need 2. I personally only use 1, stats on the 2 vescs should be near identical.

oh yea, can only connect to 1 vesc at once.

order today, ship tomorrow. 😉

What do you mean by basic settings? Basically what I'm looking to do is monitor the vesc, and change modes, IE: change batt max, motor max, and start-up boost, that's about it

Oh and follow up question, can i use these bluetooth modules to connect to BLDC tool on my computer?
