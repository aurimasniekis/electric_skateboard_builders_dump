Top of the day boys n gals,

We got in stock  **(in very limited quantities!!!)**  our new press-fit pulleys

Each pulley is CNC milled out of a solid piece of POM and can be used on  **both**  Evolve GT and TB218 trucks. T he pulleys include a bearing(s) that ensure(s) a perfect fit on the truck’s axle.

**For the Evolve GT trucks, we use for each pulley:**

* **1pc**  washer +   **2pcs**  of  **16100-ZZ**  bearings
* **1pc**  of 295mm long / 15mm wide / HTD5 timing belt for the 49T pulley (when used with a 15T motor pulley)
* **1pc**  of 320mm long / 15mm wide / HTD5 timing belt for the 55T pulley (when used with a 15T motor pulley)

**For the TB218 trucks, we use for each pulley:**

* **1pc**  of  **638-ZZ**  bearing
* **1pc**  of 320mm long / 15mm wide / HTD5 timing belt for the 49T pulley (when used with a 15T motor pulley)
* **1pc**  of 340mm long / 15mm wide / HTD5 timing belt for the 55T pulley (when used with a 15T motor pulley)

Both bearing types that sit inside the pulley and on the axle share the same outer diameter of 28mm….so they can be easily changed out to swap between TB218 and Evolve GT setups.

The area on the drive pulley where the belt runs on is very wide (22mm) with a single flange. To avoid having the belt move sideways on the Evolve GT setup, we will also include a belt retainer ring (spacer ring) to ensure that the belt is always perfectly aligned.

This retainer ring is not needed on the TB218 setup, because the motor mount itself can be easily adjusted.

The retainer rings in different sizes can also be downloaded here: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3855745 ](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3855745)

(Further .step files for different widths will be added within the next few days)
