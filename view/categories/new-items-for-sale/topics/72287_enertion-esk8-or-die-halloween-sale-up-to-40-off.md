It really depends on sell through rates, it's extremely costly to bring new product to market so normally the first few batches of any new product relies predominantly on multiple successful pre-sale campaigns.

If the sell through rate is similar to the first batch, which we believe it will be, the 2nd batch of Focbox unity might be available around middle of march 2019

If we a really on point the earliest would be late Jan 2019

The prices are great. It’s a good deal but history is you have a bad track record on delivery times. 

I wish you did not and hope you fix that and restore confidence. 

On the other hand, I had a good customer support from enertion for a remote that was not even bought from your site and got it replaced free of charge. 
That was awesome keep that up as it should be.

Re wheels; yes it's been difficult getting enough quality wheels to supply the demand.. we just placed another 20K order for wheels, so soon all our supply problems will be in the past.

I need a set of 97 fronts, but the shipping is $28. More than they cost.

Hi there.  It’s all good brother.  After I was lied to in three different occasions with a “they’re shipping next week” answer and shipping never took place I just went ahead and let my credit card company handle the issue 
I was really bummed thou.  Prices were amazing but what good is that if I can’t even get the product 
Here in the community we’re all about getting our stuff ASAP.  

Oh yeah.  It was about $2,200 purchase including a complete board. But again.  Times change and what seemed appealing today might not be later on.  

If you guys value one’s opinion.  I’d say.   Do not sell your product unless you guys have it ready to go or can keep up with promised time lines 

I only say that Because over time that will give your company a bad reputation.  And it’s great that you guys do apologize when shit goes wrong but that doesn’t make it alright to have peep waiting for extended periods of time 

Just saying 

You guys have great product btw.  All of my boards run on focboxes and reliability is second to none 👍🏼

Thanks for the advice, let me know any generous investors who want to give out some some free cash. Lol..

Sadly bro we wouldn't exist if we only sold stuff that we had in stock. We are forced to do presales.

All of our money comes from selling products, you can't make product if you don't have money. Suppliers don't do shit without money.

Even the FocBox you love so much started out as a presale offer. Now we have it instock 90% of the time.

Actually it isn't as the seller could actually include the taxes in the price, which probably is a bit more complicated on their side than not doing it, and it would raise the price... Or there is the option to bulk products to "local" warehouses, that would possibly make the price raise a bit less, and this might also mean you need a lot of stock.

This wasn't my point though. I only wanted to give a bit of perspective, that even a 40% sale might not do anything on the price for the buyer, if he /her is hit with import fees and taxes.

Hi Jason.

Is it a mistake or not that there's no 97mm outwheels available to purchase? I understand you don't have them with the new urethane yet, but from what I understood, same thing with the 100mm crossover and yet the outwheels is available for purchase. And so are the 97mm front wheels.

I'm asking because I'd really like to buy a 97mm set of the new urethane.

In my opinion, people will still buy complete boards and diyers will buy the parts. So more monies in ;) but it means bigger production runs for the company

Shipping to Russia is a hassle. We tried it in past even FOCBOX got stuck in Custom for days.
They are very strict.
We are constantly figuring out a way to ship to Russia.
We will enable shipping to Russia once we have a stable shipping channel for it :slight_smile:

Yes please 🙏
I orderd before from Eu reseller without issues at the customs.
My experience with russian customs so far, just don’t sent things with UPS and don’t sent things with express shipping. UPS can’t handle custom documentation well and express orders in general get more attention which leads usually to longer waiting time.
Just use a company which hand over the parcel to russian post service like EMS and everything should be fine.

If you need somebody to try that out, let me know, i‘m ready to test your shipping options 😉

 @EnertionSupport

 I receive package from Halloween sale from @onloop sale thread but don’t receive most expensive item... focbox. Submitted claim online enterion support and they asked me to take pictures of the box. What?

Edit: missing 4 wheels crossover outwheels for rear as well 😪

I hope this is resolved quickly and I have my focbox and 4 outwheels for my build. This was my first purchase from enterion and I am disappointed to say the least. It seems the things I read about them do have validity.

Waiting patiently for another ??? (1-2 months?) for an in stock items to get to California...
