Hey Everyone!
I’m excited to share this here.
Just wanted to announce that battery packs have just gone on sale at Pitbull for a limited time.

50% off!

[Click here!](https://pitbullelectricskateboards.com/collections/black-friday-cyber-monday/products/12s4p-lithium-pack?variant=21588837302330)

3 types of cells to choose from
EVE, LG, and Panasonic

High capacity packs

Why so cheap? I accidentally order way way way too many cells in my most recent order.

These cells have all been tested and approved.

Quality brand name brand new cells. 
I’ll post an exclusive discount code to save even more in the comments below if this gets an encouraging response.

Thank you!

Agreed.  Can anyone vouch for this guy?  Seems like he would only be making like $75 tops after the cost of cells & bms...

Not to mention shipping cost & nickel strip.  A well built battery takes about 3-4 hours minimum and that's if you are really efficient.

I was planning on making my own battery pack, but if these prices are for real, I don't think I'd be able to resist, lol!  Wish they offered some different cells though.  I've found a source for Samsung 40T's and they are like $6.  Certainly a bit pricier then a $4 Samsung 30Q cell, and it's not 50% more power then a 30Q, but I think it'll be worth it :slight_smile:

I’d actually be making much less than $75. As I said in the post, i ordered too many cells by accident. In order to pay off my PO, i had to borrow money and put everything I have towards this. I’m just trying to price them to sell. It’s much more important to me that i quickly pay back who i borrowed from than it is for me to make money off of the extra cells i ordered. 

I am thinking about offering DIY kits in case some people want to reduce the price further and assemble it themselves or use a different BMS.

Let me know if anyone has any questions. 

My phone number is also on my website. Feel free to use it.

Case and point, so whilst that is suspicious (along with this https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/pitbull-esk8-board/75092?u=totalgeek9224) I figure that there is no harm in giving the benefit of the doubt and having him have the opportunity to prove himself. Last time I checked, on his website, the only picture for his batteries was a 3D render of a battery pack. I know if i was gonna buy i would love to see what im actually getting.

I pretty much want a clone of this pack I have but with better cells:

You’re absolutely right, photos are needed. I’ll be back at my office tomorrow and plan on taking some photos of some packs. 

I post the items for sale this weekend from home and didnt have any on hand to photograph.

I’ll update the product pages tomorrow (well seeing as it’s almost 2am, i’ll update the photos later today).

So sorry for the delay with the photos. The holidays and family events override my scheduling. No excuse though, I should have anticipated that. 

Here's a few pics I was able to grab earlier.

![IMG_3119-1s|391x500](upload://pLaLrzT40HMpVVkYtJg9oXw9keo.jpeg) ![IMG_3111-1s|666x500](upload://hvYFiXxF0VtArtuWtJy4Awn85Sf.jpeg) ![IMG_3115-1s|348x500](upload://sPfpbOnFwBgc43HAEt6SLYnWpua.jpeg) ![IMG_3120-1s|375x500](upload://cSApJcwNYbSw7OR0nh5C9koLJj.jpeg) 

The battery pack in the blue wrap in the photo is not a great example as it was a custom arrangement which called for the BMS to be external and laid perpendicular to how it would normally be if it was wrapped with the rest of the pack. 

Most of the cells I have in stock (overstocked) are in packs like you see in the photos (double stacked). 

I'll try to get some more photos tomorrow if I can get away for a minute. Might have to wait until Friday. 
Just to let everyone know, I'm going to keep this sale going through all of next week. Don't feel rushed to make a purchase. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for getting sales, but I want my customers to feel confident when purchasing through me. 

Also, if it lends to my credibility, I'm also the owner/inventor of NoriLights.com, which has been operating since 2012. Since then I've shipped over 4000 Nori Lights to over 3,400 customers in over 42 countries around the world. 

Before launching Pitbull, I was working as the lead tech consultant for Liftboard. I had several assignments while working for them, which included quality inspections and also developing prototypes for future versions. I really enjoyed making those prototypes, and I began getting requests from friends, then friends of friends. It continued to evolve into what is now Pitbull Electric Skateboards. 

By the way, the name Pitbull was inspired by Back to the Future II, specifically the scene where Marty tries to return the borrowed pink Barbie Mattel hoverboard to the little girl, who replies "Keep it, I got a Pitbull now."  =)

I respect this website, and it's community. And I appreciate everyone being so cautious. Makes me excited to get to the point to where I am not a stranger. 

I have a lot of exciting stuff coming up. And some of you have seen some of my recent innovations, those of which I plan on sharing in more detail soon.  

Thanks everyone for being patient and open minded with me. Please continue to share your thoughts and concerns, ask questions, and let me know how I may be of service. And if you are in the San Diego area, hit me up. Let's go skate. 

Happy Thanksgiving 

-Chris

A quick note: I have just enabled Paypal payments on PitbullElectricSkateboards.com.
Also, you can save time by simply typing in PBeSk8.com instead.

And I am making some changes and additions to the site tonight that will help with navigation and browsing for products, as well as adding some requested options, such as BMS discharge by-pass. I hope to get these changes implemented tonight. In the meantime, if you place an order and have any requests such as BMS discharge bypass, simply add a note during checkout. I will reach out to you to discuss if needed before shipping your order. 

Thanks everyone.

Just to update everyone:
I have added discharge bypass as an option to the packs. I also made xt60 or xt90 connectors a selectable option on each batteries product page. The batteries are also now accessible from the home page and directly from the navigation menu.

A link to add a battery charger has also been added to each battery page. 

And photos of the build process will be captured and posted this evening. 

The sale will continue to run all week. And in celebration of Cyber Monday, i would like to share exclusively with the members of this forum a discount code to receive an additional 15% off of the sale price on these lithium packs. Use this coupon code during check out:
**wackywavinginflatablearmflailingtubeman**

This code expires tonight at midnight.

I know a lot of you are waiting for build photos before making a purchase, so I will really try to get those posted here for you soon today so that you will have enough time to take advantage of the additional 15% off deal.

Thank you everyone!

Yes the LG and Panasonic are 10A discharge, and @martijntje42 is correct, the EVE are something like 7.6A discharge if I recall correctly. I'll admit i had never heard of EVE before either, but apparently, from what I've read, they are used in Segway products and other mobility applications. They test well with low internal resistance. But yes the discharge rating is a little lower than the other two.

Nu, there are people who are fine with 40a. 
For me it would be min 40a too less and I also wouldn’t recommend anybody who is seriously interested in a high performance board to use so low discharge rated cells.
But that’s just my opinion, doesn’t mean that people can’t be happy with your packs.
Don’t get it wrong please.
I don’t know about the prices for your cells in US, but I can get 48 (12s4p) of those Panasonic or LG for 110$ and 130$ new from nkon.
With bms and all other stuff plus work time it’s now a ok price.
People who would pay the regular price, which is the double of the actual price, i‘m sorry, but I really can’t understand.

Do not buy from the User named **Money** AKA **Chris Flynn** AKA **Owner of Norilights**

I live in San Diego and attended UCSD ....purchased a board from him locally. He has ZERO idea what he was doing and delivered to me a have unfinished broken product. I had to throw away most of the parts during the rebuild due to his inability to match parts for proper fitting. He welded/glued the motor pulleys to the motor shafts, stripped the setting screws of the pulleys, ruined the esc's with a horrendous soldering job. It was the only time I have ever been burned on a purchase on craigslist. The dude is a fraud. Nothing about his product looked professional, not even the wiring or layout of the internals.

He bought the CHEAPEST parts you can find top build me a $1400 skateboard. Do not expect him to produce a quality finished product. If I had the time I would have taken him to small claims court. Avoid at all cost.

You're the piece of work, Money. 

If anyone needs details concerning his POS work pm me. I'll tell you all the details you need including the original craigslist Ad. Dude is a complete fraud. He used the cheapest parts, then dumped the remaining stock on craigslist seeing most of his motors failed after little use.

Looks like i might even have the original txts too, so again if anyone is interested pm me. This trash doesnt deserve to do business on this or any forum.

You burn one customer Money, be ready for the consequences. I told you if I ever see your work craigslist or otherwise I would be there ready to put out the word how you robbed me. 

You should have delivered a finished product.

Hi Money,
I am interested.  How do I pay for these batteries?

Do I need to wait until Black Friday, or can I send you money for four of them today?

He has ZERO idea what he was doing

haha, I can vouch for this.
@ChrisW I hope you are joking.  
I checked out his "shop" a few months back, it was an absolute disaster. I'm pretty sure they're "repurposed" Lime scooter batteries too, lol... you're better off stealing them yourself
