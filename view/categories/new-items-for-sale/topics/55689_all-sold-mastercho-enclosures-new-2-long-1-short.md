Purchased and ended up not building with them. Really been cutting down and selling off parts. Was somewhat hoarding ESK8 parts :persevere:

$85 shipped for long, $75 shipped for short

I’d recommend clearcoating and polishing these if you want a perfect finish. Otherwise, they are pretty good quality.

If you're wondering about the long one it can fit a 10s4p, two vescs, and more. These are awesome enclosures. 

@Eboostin. If you have these tomorrow. I might buy another long one. I just have to convince the wifey that I need my esk8 allowance for the month to be raised a bit. ;)
