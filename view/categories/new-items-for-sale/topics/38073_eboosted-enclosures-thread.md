Hello guys, I've been offering Loaded Vanguard enclosures for a while now, but as I build more boards I have other enclosures for sale as well, so I'm making a thread with my enclosures portafolio:

I have several requests to make a Loaded Vanguard 12S enclosure, for all those who would like the benefits of a 12S battery whether you are building a new Loaded Vanguard with loads of range, torque and speed from the start or want to upgrade your current vanguard equipped with 10S, this is the perfect time.

Personally since I tested 12S, I can't go back to 10S anymore.

12S Vanguard Battery enclosure
US$ 70
Here is a comparison between the 10S and 12S battery enclosure.

I bought a set for my Boosted Clone build some months ago! I have to say they're amazeballs and I couldn't be happier. They're incredibly rugged and seems easy to waterproof. 

Highly recommend them!

I'm trying to build a 10s6p and a 12s5p for people that have requested it.

However, I'm finding a lot challenges in order to have a nice sweet enclosure that look perfect, I could do any type of enclosure but not all of them will seamlessly blend with the deck.

If there's an option that would fit 60 cells but won't be visually appealing, I definitely won't ever build it. 

A two cell layer enclosure will look terrible and would have a really bad ground clearance, unless you make an enclosure boost board like with two segments. 

Runing cell horizontally would allow me to run a 10s6p or 12s5p but there wouldn't be any space left for the switch, BMS, wires, xt60 or xt90 connectors, maybe only for tow VESCs or Focboxes.

You could plan to run the VESCs on a different  compartment on the top of the deck, as on a Trampa EMTB,  and the connect the motors, but if wouldn't be a 12s5p enclosure anymore.

If you try to run the cells vertically, almost no deck in the market will allow 10 cells vertically, you will have to get a deck with at least 9" on the thinnest part, that's a pretty fat deck, so that's also not an option.

I understand the issue you don't want to make something huge, ugly and bulky. I haven't found anything that will fit my pack that doesn't embody all three of those. Would it look so bad to add little height to it though? Perhaps just as a prototype? You could support such stacked configurations where the cells are right on top of each other and so you get some space savings? I'm sure you've thought of that though. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/3/83b54987b2796cee4ccb9265f6ef40a1022d5a88.png" width="690" height="277">

when you interlock the double stacked cells it only comes to around 30mm high... not 36mm like some people assume.

one more cm to the enclosure is not that bad. and this is crucial for all the speed junkies trying to pull crazy amps with awd :slight_smile:

heck alan you should do this just for me so we can see what 13s6p does !!!!! lol

Maby using battery enclosure on both sides. 10s3p on each side? It would be tight but I think it's enough place. Than you would have place for  2 vesc on each side. Drop bms, use a balancing board only. They are thin and won't take any place.

Or maybe you can keep the flare on the front as that’s what the evo deck does anyhow...

This^ !!!!!!!!! Alan I looked at the bottom of my deck closely and the shape side to side is pretty basic. Just slightly curved downwards towards the edges. So little than when screwing it down it would probably flex right against the small curves. 

The real issue is if the enclosure including flat parts is more than 24inches end to end. Then you start getting really into the drop where you’d almost have to have the deck to design it. I don’t suppose fiberglass will bend very much and mold to the deck contours.

I could shorten this one at leave it at 20" total external, but you will have 19.5" of available space to work only, that means it would give space for a 10s4p tops.

I could also sand out the center flares, but you will only have holding points an the corners

@Eboosted looks like I'm grabbing one, I'll get some exact measurements tomorrow when I'm installing 2nd motor 😋

@Eboosted am I crazy to think that this would fit?

You could...but there would be no room for BMS unless you have a micro BMS or external...

@scepterr it won't fit that way... You'd have to take two of the 4p packs and spun them sideways... Up top like..<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/7/97d0316d24c1ccf59eb977bc716a2524243b97fd.jpg" width="666" height="500">

@deckoz wrapping your batteries with kapton tape will create too much heat inside the pack, if you have the means to control heat inside the batteries it would be ok, otherwise I suggest to remove some kapton and use heat wrap.

I'm working on a slightly longer vanguard battery case, it would allow a 12S4P configuration, with BMS, charging port, capacity meter and switch.

All those with 10s vanguard batteries could use this as a spare battery pack but with 12S or maybe even a permanent upgrade

LOL I just almost spit my drink all over the screen! 

Well you already showed me that it would fit easily in your 12S universal. So all I need is you to do is create a universal evo deck (one piece) which dozens of people on need. I’m running a tiny 13S BMS that is smaller than a 4P pack. So right now I’m sitting at 20.5” end to end on battery. Add 2.5 inches for Focbox so that brings me to 23” of useable space on the interior to make this 13s4p work on evo. 

This wouldn’t be a custom tailored suit for my crazy 13S project. I can fit my components in the same space of a universal setup of someone wanting a 12s4p evo enclosure, which I would think is 99% of the demand for this unicorn of an enclosure that for some crazy reason isn’t being produced yet in a one piece version :stuck_out_tongue: 

It’s not even really that difficult to fit I don’t think. As you can see here in @psychotiller enclosure that I believe has 25” of internal space :) this would be exactly what I’m looking for if it was one piece.

Large enclosures are 2 pieces because they have to be...I've tried to explain that but I'm not sure if you understand why.  A 33" oven only gives about 22" of space to put a sheet of plastic in there. Then there is the rack in the oven that holds the frame, that holds the hot plastic...You end up with 20" max if you get a good form because it's hard to stretch a mold all the way to the edges of your sheet and still get a good seal.

There are vaccuum forming machines that can be ordered with a max plate of 27". We may order one. But until then, 2 piece abs enclosures are a necessity not a choice.

But for the record. There is nothing fuctionally wrong with 2 piece enclosures the way I do it.

That bigger oven tho :stuck_out_tongue:

I fully understand it is just because of size constraints for the oven you are using. I just wish you had a bigger one as I really like your enclosure design but the middle part but clearance is way more of an issue with this deck vs others because of the aggressive drop. That’s lip in the middle is asking for it :) 

I might just end up with your 2 piece soon anyway because I’m really anxious to get to riding haha

Alan feels it would be cheaper to buy a used or new Icarus vs shipping the board.

I looked into it. It would cost about $78 to ship the board one way to Peru. 

Maybe as a community we can organize buying Alan the boards required to make the molds.

If anyone wants to, I will split the cost of an Icarus and Evo to purchase for Alan to keep, and make molds for us. 

@treenutter I'm not level 3, how should I go about fund gathering from other members to send to Alan so that he can purchase the boards directly. 

@thisguyhere would you be willing to take part?

12 packs of 4 parallel each, connected with dual 12awg soldered wires.

The wires run through the center of the enclosure which have a lower profile than the perimeter where the rubber gasket sits on the deck.

Well, even though if you don't use a gasket the center dividers are lower than the borders, so there is plenty of space for thick wires to connect the packs. 

On this build, the Phoenix, I won't use bullet connectors buy xt90, so if they unplug and connect again due vibrations they won't spark just disconnect. 

I would also use an antispark switch with fuse kindly donated by Atilla @esk8, I owe you a big one my friend

I will also stick the packs with the enclosure with 3M double sided tape so they don't move, mitigate the vibrations and allow an easier disassembling for inspections.

I will use a 12s balance monitoring system with buzzer from Mtech shipped FROM Germany with the help of my friend  @nowind

The deck will have 1 ply more than the urban carver deck to reduce the flex a bit and reduce the flex of the battery.

I'll start a build log as soon as I have the board runing on the streets

It's better to have the weight of the batteries at the bottom because it's the natural state of the beard and it'll stick better with time.

It seems the total length of the hs11/HollyPro deck and the street/urban carve deck are exactly the same. The only difference is the rounded corners.

If that's correct then I just need to wound the corners. 

Can someone please measure the total length between the edges of a carve deck? Is it 69cm? Just to confirm :slight_smile:

For all those who needed a procedure to mount enclosures here is the one I used that gave me great results:

The holes must be drilled when you have your enclosure on hand, I never ship them predrilled because it's almost impossible to make a perfectly aligned hole after a predrilled one. 

This is the correct procedure:

1. Cut 4 small pieces of double sided tape put them on the border of the enclosure, where it'll touch the deck

2. Align the enclosure on the deck where you want it to be and stick it

3. Mark the drilling points with a pencil, use a ruler for accuracy

4. Drill the holes through the enclosure and deck with 5mm brad pointed wood drll bit

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/e/ae96d8a01e215b69f67faa09a8227b55a1da0c03.jpeg" width="443" height="332">

5. Remove the enclosure and drill a 7mm holes on the deck only, to allow the mounting of the nut inserts. 

6. Install nut inserts from top to bottom, turn by hand until you can't get them in more. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/a/ba4a021b2f8b39ca89210d3d6d4f903b60a4134f.jpg" width="666" height="500">

7. Screw one M5 bolt on the nut insert completely and then keep turning until the nut insert is completeky flushed to the deck surface, thus will help you to make a perfect thread on the deck without braking the nut insert itself (do not screw the nut insert by using an Allen wrench directly without doing this procedure first, of the muy interesante will brake) 

8. Remove the bolt and nut insert

9. Reinsert the nut insert again from top to bottom, this time with the Allen wrench, it will go down smoothly, without forcing it or braking 

10. Install enclosure with M5 bolts from the bottom

No template needed at all, perfect fitment

Is it possible for you to adjust the design a bit so that there’s a “channel” that runs down the center of the enclosure? Like a small dip in between each battery segment to run the balance leads. This should minimize, or eliminate any potential running of the leads against the top of the board. Or is the enclosure deep enough that there’s a gap between the top of the electronics and the board?
```

There's a lot of space between the enclosure and deck, you can even fit 12AWG wires between packs so there's enough space for balance leads as well, at the sides of the enclosure there is also more space to run charger wires or battery capacity meters.

Just found this thread, and man, am I happy about that. I've just ordered a Trampa Urban Carver and I have been struggling to find a suitable battery enclosure - look no further - yes! Thanks Rob69de for your initial post.

One quick question though: I am planning to use LiPo for batteries and I am not sure whether they will fit in the enclosure. Can you provide internal measurements of the enclosure for the Trampa Urban Carver?
[These](https://www.smc-racing.net/index.php?route=product/product&path=67_152&product_id=126) are the batteries I will be using. I am planning on a 10s setup, so 5 of these will go in the enclosure, along with a BMS and dual Focbox.

Comes in perfect condition, in best protection stuff... not take long from Peru to Germany...

Fits perfect for a Trampa Holy Pro Deck

Fits also very nice on a Trampa Short Deck... but you should not shape your Short Deck like a  Hamster on Meth .. like me :sunglasses:

This was a clever design, you can actually have more discharge on a 12S3P on Sanyo 20700 (90A) against a 12S4P on 30Q 18650 (80A)

I couldn't make the test fit properly with 20700 cells and 4 FocBoxes, I only had one FocBox and 18650 cells, but as you can see there is plenty of space available, so it should fit no issues.

I just want to make sure the length, width and random meassures of my enclosure matches your Carver deck, let me know if you could PM that in order to confirm 100% at least the external dimensions.

I'm starting today with the design of the carver enclosure, it's always difficult without the deck. But @barajabali and I figured out how to digitally extractcand shares 2D models for any deck. 

@mikenyc send me a PM and I'll send you the instructions

i'll just hang this out there, ill even deliver a deck to you eBro! (@Eboosted) 
Loaded tesseract... but I want to use ollin mounts so it needs to suit duel diagonal or 4wd.

anyone else interested?

One advantage with a tesseract enclosure is they build three decks off the same mold just changing the nose and tail. So it will suit three loaded boards.

Ok guys, someone is traveling from USA to Lima next Thursday and he had offered to bring a small deck to me but only if he receive it by Wednesday 21st, I'm traveling to ATL on Sunday 25th, so that leaves me 3 days from Friday to Sunday to make 3 enclosures for the Jet Spud or/and whatever deck you want, it's tight but I'll make it happen.

I spoke with @jlabs and he might be able to ship him the deck, otherwise hope anyone could ship it, if someone wants to colaborate please request me a PM to send you a shipping address in Atlanta.

I really like how clean your enclosures look.
It's hard for me to get an idea of how big the enclosures are.

This is my setup and the dimensions of it. Do you think you have any enclosure that would fit ? The vanguard 12S battery enclosure maybe ? Or even 10S?

If you need even more room, just to be on the safe side, I'd suggest you get the 12S which is slightly longer but has the same width:

![image|666x500](upload://hHVQUr2zl9thrZmIYf06Axe0wZE.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://uBBJ2rt6hus7ndEnJVgoiFkBkJN.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://wokP5dcgh7ru936cF9UK6wd5Oa2.jpeg)

What i mean is an enclosure ( maybe one of the models you already have, just a bit modified) to integrate with the box so you can have the cooling fins outside the enclosure and the rest inside. I dunno if i am clear on what i imagine

Edit : how can I fix this backward pictures issue ?

Edit: that exactly what you said lmfao I am dumb

[/quote]

let me guess...using an iPhone? For some reason, after all these years, iPhone's pictures still shows up upside down when I imported onto a PC but not on a MAC. 

Anyway, on your phone, go to edit, rotate your picture once, save it, then rotate it back and save again, then upload. that seems to work

worst experience i’ve ever had:
was rocketing up a hill full throttle past a biker, full speed stance and the cocky wave as i passed him. got to the flat at the top of the hill and slowed down for a stop sign. took about 15 years to get going again because my vesc was thermal throttling. the biker passed me in a casual position and gave me the cocky wave...
i turned and went right back home

karma is a bitch.

Don't waste your money guys. Many years ago I was taking tablets that were supposed to help with my memory. After I finished the first bottle, I went to the chemist to buy some more. I got there and the lady asked what I was looking for. I couldn't remember the brand. Figured I was wasting my money if I couldn't even remember that.
Now I just blame my memory loss on old age and alcohol. Seems to get me through.

If there was a lip about 5-10mm going completely around the enclosure just before the fins, then it would be easy to mount to the bottom of an enclosure with a hole cut out and could be sealed with a rubber gasket and secured with screws from the lip going around the case.  I would really like to do that to..

Take a look at the new dual enclosure made for the ESCape.  It's got just what I was suggesting, about 5mm lip all around the enclosure, so it could much more easily be exposed from the bottom of a enclosure.  Though if you look at the post I just made on that same thread, there is an even better solution IMO now for how to cool your ESCape's enclosure and additionally mount it on your trucks and therefore save space so you can have even more batteries!

I can make any enclosure you want if you ship the enclosure to Miami, I have a freight forwarder there with shipments 3 times a month, however i usually take the board back when I have a friend going to USA or I travel to visit my mom.

I could always ship it via postal service but it's usually more 80 bucks.

I also like to work on enclosures that at least 3 are going to be ordered, so custom enclosures for only one deck are always a lost on my side.

Hey @Eboosted What are the chances you have an enclosure for a Trampa carver deck that will fit a 12S4P 18650 with a Vruzend kit? I don't have a spot-welder and like the ease of assembly and maintenance that comes with the kit. I will most likely use a double FOCbox or HW6 controller but these can go on the tail of the board if necessary. Looking for options at this point. Thanks!

Hey, do you have any of the Vanguard 10S4P and VESC enclosures that you can ship to US? I'm looking for a split enclosure to hold 10S3P of 18650s + BMS in one and 2 x FOCBOX + receiver in the other, and it seems like your enclosures would fit this stuff.

Edit: also figure I should mention I'm looking to use these on an Axis Arbor deck, but that's pretty similar in shape to a Vanguard, so I don't suppose there'd be any issues with that, right?

Thanks for the heads up, I didn't know it was against Paypal policy.

_Keep in mind the following PayPal policy which prohibits surcharges..._

_4.6 No Surcharges. You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal as a payment method. You may charge a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services, as long as the handling fee does not operate as a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-PayPal transactions._

Yeah really it means nothing as the fee's just get passed on to the consumer in some way no matter what. Maybe it just makes them look better compared to credit card companies that do the same thing idk.

I used socket head Because I like the depth of the heads, less likely to strip, or had the head torqued off. Counter sunk are also typically wider when in combination with a fender washer. So size was a thought too. Using M4 socketheads with fender washers is the perfect width for eboosteds flanges.

No... But I use the m4 throughout the build.. motor mounts. Motors etc. Easier to buy packs of 200 and use it throughout. As motor mounts and motor screws are always socket head on my build... More so multipurpose purchasing..

For me its what Decky said.  But Also, I like the socket style because it just feels more secure to me.  I own a rock climbing gym and some of the holds we put on the wall use socket bolts and some use countersunk bolts.  The ones with Martini bolts spin more (we dont like that).


I know this doesn't compare to this application at all, but just why I have that mindsight.

## \#438 Posted by: Deckoz Posted at: 2018-04-21T22:57:51.290Z Reads: 389

```
Additional, at the peak(center of the deck), it's an additional 26mm @taz. Measuring the thickness detached doesn't tell the whole story. As when I torque it down the enclosure pulls itself outward and flatter. I.e when I lay the enclosure on without bolting it. I can push down in the center and there is a gap. Once I bolt it, It pulls the enclosure outward with less of a curve and compresses the batteries against the deck.

Hello, unfortunately no, those are 70 cells I don't think any of my enclosures would be capable to hold such a high number of cells in single stacked enclosures and I only make single stacked ones. Nevertheless, the Jet Spud 29" double stacked (in the works) should hold 60 cells, a full BMS and two focboxes plus electronics.

Yes he does...

Thats how the
- EVO, soon Falcon
- Icarus
- Zenith
- Spud

Etc came to be. Normally he requires a minimum request quantity so that making the molds is worth it. I believe Minimum is 3 or 5 enclosures, and needs the deck to make the initial bucks & mold. 

Pretty sure his current options are

- Landyatchz Evo
- Landyatchz Evo Falcon (coming soon)
- Sector 9 Bintang
- Hi5ber Zenith
- Loaded Vanguard, 10s and 12s options
- Loaded Icarus 10/12s
- Never Summer Reaper
- Trampa Street Carver bottom mount
- Trampa HS11/Holy Pro bottom mount
- Jet Spud 29"
- Universal Flat enclosures 10s, 12s

Most have been commissioned by forum members :) and his work is amazing... You've seen my Evo enclosure ;)

They fit with enough space after the rubber gasket so I'd say it has space for 26mm of height.

I need at least 3 enclosures to cover the cost of the mold fabrication.

This is the first time someone asked for enclosures for these decks. The Earthwing  can use the universal 12S enclosure.

hmm, i wonder if the 10s4p universal will work with my deck, the landyachtz switchblade

http://landyachtz.com/switchblade-40-mountains-blue

i'm using a dual foxbox setup, would those fit inside the enclosure with the batteries? or would i need a separate enclosure with a phase wire for them

my big concern is the deck isn't all that flat on the bottom and bowls up near the edges, wonder if i can just put some shims under there and get thick weatherstripping

It will hold a 12s4p and 2 focboxes and a 60A bms

The Universal might work better.

The enclosure is flexible, so no issues tightening the sides with bolts.

Hello 135mm on the big ESC pocket.

Here's a picture of two focboxes and 12S 60A Battery Supports BMS, they fit like a glove, if you can give me the siuze of the Bestech 80A BMS I'll look for it.

Measurements are : L120mm * W80mm * T20mm

Think it's too wide to fit your enclosure.

No that BMS is huge, you could remove all 8 cells from one pocket and use it for the BMS, it will fit perfectly, but you will end up with a 10S4P

I dón think it's physically possible to mount thst BMS with a 13S4P battery uner a HS11/Carver deck.

I assume it’s a double stack version of the 12s4p one? 

I was searching for an enclosure that can hold at least 10s6p for an upcoming project on HS11 and was thinking a single layer of cells under the deck plus a [ultrabox 206](http://www.uwkinetics.com/products/206-ultrabox) for vescs and antispark on top, next to the motor mounts would be great. Keep the clearance high by having just a single layer of cells under the deck (plus a small bms d140 or equivalent) and have all electronics on top at the rear.

I think we have a few people keen on an enclosure specific to the Talon... @kylem21 @adman ? Myself. Next would be to find a cost effective way to get a deck down to @Eboosted so he can make a mold. Any ideas? I'm in Canada.

Best way to fit everything under the box would be a double stack hs11 under tray, you will have space for a full bms, 2 x 6.4hw ESC and plenty of cells. The good thing is you won't need to position any electronics underneath at all.

Thanks for the write-up Adam.  

It was great to show Adam around our factory is Seattle.   If there is enough interest I can arrange a group tour.   PM me if you are interested, and I'll see about setting up a date for it.    It would need to be on a Saturday. 

In case anyone is interested I had Adam stand on all our boards that seemed like good candidates for electric:

Century 36, GT 40, Ruse 39, Shadow 37, Spirit 30, Talon 37, Vega  36
https://www.subsonicskateboards.com/collections/factory-decks-completes

These boards can all be purchased as factory boards, or customized for shape, layers (including carbon fiber, texalium, or fiberglass), finishes, laser engraving,  and custom grip tape.

agreed, I for one really want the talon, but I'm likely to just end up getting the landyachtz evo because @eboosted already makes enclosures for them. If we could figure out how to get him a board to make a mold so he can make a custom enclosure than I certainly would be buying a talon. @Subsonic_Paul

Hey guys small update, Paul just shipped a Talon deck to my mom's house. That's an awesome gesture so I just want to thank him publicly, I should have the enclosure design pretty soon.

Let me know what kind of enclosure would you prefer for this deck, single stack, double stack, lambo design, pacific rim design or simple flat. 

On the other hand, there is also a posibility to design a  a pretty slim enclosure over a routed deck with channels for the motor wires.

I'd be keen on one like the Evo, a single with the lambo design. Especially it could fit at 10s5p. Its a stock downhill flex talon (black stain). I plan on running dual 6355s 2x Focboxes and a 10s5p 30q with an external BMS. Unfortunately I don't have the tooling to rout the deck but that would be sweet. Thanks Paul and eboosted for making this happen.

can't wait to receive my urban carver enclosure, and trying to make some sketch to prepare the fitting in it.
I don't know for now if i will fit a BMS in it, and i am thinking of a Danny's DieBiems  in it.
Can you give me the exact dimension of the big hole? or just a photo with a reference
would it fit a DieBiems with 2 VESC?

@osbor it depends on what enclosure you request and the currently available stock.

For instance I usually have stock in TX location, if this is the case shipping to USA takes 3 days.

If there is no stock I make it by hand in Lima and it takes around 7 days, then you need to select international parcel 15-20 days to ship or for USD 30 more you can select DHL (2 days international).

So, do you put a tracking number on stuff you ship?
I'm realizing that my temp housing place has a kinda poopy package system where if you don't grab the package within a few hours of it arriving it goes into a locked room. And the only person with the key is in another building a quarter of a mile away and has to walk over to unlock said room.
So knowing exactly when things arrive is imperative

The key to the so called copy room is held by the leasing office agent, there are two buildings for the apartment. I'm in the lesser building. The leasing office staff is spread real thin so about half the week the leasing office ib my building is closed and the leasing office agent hangs out in the leasing office of the other building...and she has to walk over with the key in hand to unlock the copy room, and she periodically comes over the put delivered packages into the copy room.

So I gotta see the package has arrived, and grab it off the package drop table before she locks them up

This other enclosure is very special because it was requested by @bigboytoys the same week he past away, so it was designed and manufactured with a lot of pasion to detail and plenty of love.

Trampa HS11 DS
[img]https://i.imgur.com/tn5vqnW.jpg[/img]

It's not as thick as I though and it should hold double stack of cells for a crazy 12S8p, 11S8P if you want to run quad motors.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/PABuWGE.jpg[/img]

I changed the design for a more symmetrical/eye-pleasing one, now it has a big compatment on the sides where you could mount a big BMS for charge and discharge and two rows of cells, the sides are bigger as they are less exposed to flex forces.

Yes. This is the prototype, I'm making a batch of 6 ATM, let me know if you would like to reserve one or just order it from the website:

I could also include a 12S8P battery pack made out with Samsung 30Qs with the enclosure.

have folks attempted securing these enclosures with industrial strength  velcro all the way around the perimeter of the enclosure?
for that you'd want to velcro the battery pack to the deck directly of course, so it'll reduce a lot of weight the enclosure would need to bear

reason i'm thinking velcro is to have no visible bolt through, yeah, but it also makes taking the enclosure off far easier and far faster in case of an emergency
also the number of bolts used seems excessive, that's a lot of holding force for a couple pounds of stuff

Even the bolts will back out, you need to use loctite.

Velcro is a really bad idea from my point of view, taking the enclosure appart will force it too much and you will end up with both sides of the velcro in your hand.

Besides the velcro won't stick back with the same strength

Even though there are not much things under de deck, take into consideration the continuous vibrations on everyday use, you won't believe how much stress the holding points had to bear.

I like the idea of top mounting the electronics. Less holes to cut into the enclosure. This works especially well on a mountain board. The enclosure is also less crowded, which is always nice. Maybe you can go 13s with the extra space!

Here’s the condition that my enclosures arrived. He said he was working late on them. Offered to replace it, haven’t gotten it after over a month. Got a refund though.

That makes no fucking sense. 

I'm not sure why you are expecting some sort of special treatment or demands.

- You realize you let him borrow the decks
- making these takes time
- you are impatient, asking for expedited services outside of his normal operation. 

You have a guy here who takes the time to make these molds and figures out logistics of getting enclosures to the US for his mom to ship out. Normally he ships a large package to his mom and then she separates and ships them to all of us. 

You asked, and demanded for expedited service, which meant Alan spending his own money on a flight with his regular shipment. Instead of him spending money on posting to his mom,he spends almost 6X the money on a flight to bring enclosures in, to deliver them at a faster rate.

When really, you could have had some patience, given the man the deck, like most of us have as courtesy for taking the time to make the molds, and in general not have been such an asshat.

Can't believe this is my first post in days, and only posting now because I literally cannot support any of the bullshit you are saying, or the way you talk to people. Loose your attitude, learn some fucking patience.

Edit: You know what you did, and what you've said. I won't repeat that here. So don't bring up this nonsense here. Really showed alot of character on you're part 👌.

I also had a bunch of unexpected expenses with this, the threat of having to toss my deck in the trash in Mexico, and I accepted the shipment for 2 others in New York.

That's quite a gap, all the way around, how do I go about addressing this?
Get a strip of real thick neoprene and get various length screws that'll clamp down it but not too hard to flex it?
Start going at it with a hacksaw bit by bit until it's flush? Although I don't know how I'd properly measure things with this method....

it's looking like this could all work if i just cut a "haunch" into the enclosure at the four corners where the deck seems to dip down a bit, the foot holds essentially. but again i don't know how i'd measure for that kind of a cut to make it precise

If to use epoxy only on the front and back it shouldn't be too much.
You don’t need to fill all area. Just restrict the area you fill out to the frame. Like 2cm or so.

On the sides big neoprene should be enough.
 
If you have access to a 3D printer you could print a layer for the front and back. Or just take some wood, cut it and file it till it fit our needs.

the advice from @mikenyc for a box is one I would suggest, it would stop USPS from treating it like a frisbee that's for sure :smiley:

i've gone ahead and looked for a box online, and this is the closest I could find that would fit most enclosures

https://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-11386/Corrugated-Boxes-200-Test/30-x-20-x-6-Corrugated-Boxes


only about 2.50$ per box, with the decrease chance of USPS destroying an enclosure. If I could go back, I would gladly pay 5$ more as it would save both the customer and seller time and money.

thank you again for the enclosure, couldn't be any happier with it @Eboosted

I’m not sure how shipping works in Lima or other countries. In the US, FedEx has free boxes. I’ve shipped out 5 decks so far with those boxes. Just get that large or medium one. Open it flat and flip in around so becomes a plain brown box. Do the same with two more boxes, taper the ends of the middle box by cutting the end flaps and connect the boxes together. Pad the ends, then tape up the whole thing. ![image|436x500](upload://vHWLIrBsU19SfBsACpNeW91Lqyf.jpeg)

yeah but you can use the 1095 box eitherway, since Alan sends it thru USPS priority mail..

the problem comes with flat rate boxes, those can't be folded/cut up/ changed from their original shape if you use the same company to ship them.

the 1095 box is essentially a free box shipped to your house you can fold in anywhichway and still ship it since it's not flat rate.

@osbor I'll post it here as well, other people might benefit from it. 

Try heating the part when the enclosure needs to bend with a heat gun, give it just enough heat so it doesn't deform too much. 

Buy a can of spray matte black paint in order to make it look brand new after the process.

Even though these have been painted with acrylic paint you can use this brand and it matches the color perfect, you can get it at Walmart.

oh, i should switch to this thread as well for added visibility

should i put down some kind of insulation over the deck underneath the fiberglass? i’m a little worried the heat might warp the paint or deck rather badly.
or do you heat it off the deck then quickly move it to the deck to press?
also, what about putting the whole thing in a 400 degree F oven for a few minutes to get it toasty THEN form?

Yup worked pretty well. Took the angle out of that part of the enclosure letting it like flat on the deck, which almost entirely closes the gap around the perimeter. There's still a bit of a gap but the tightened screws should close that 

![IMG_20180628_215456|666x500](upload://i9Q38E6QZkkZfaaiFMJ38oUuN1v.jpg)![IMG_20180628_215438|666x500](upload://4tQzPrzsd5Al0Vxhag7sK5jlEX2.jpg)![IMG_20180628_215442|666x500](upload://8x7WT23ZBgYce8PNvQYbKGIsm4W.jpg)



HOWEVER, something I just realized, the instructions for the mounting nuts are for the older kind with teeth on them you screw in. The mounting nuts I got press into the wood. The instructions say to use a 7mm drill bit, but is that too thick? It seems like the nuts will be too loose in the wood...but I'm just not a good judge of relative diameter

On these new inserts you need to use epoxy, let them dry overnight otherwise they will strip. 

I see the heat gun truck worked but the paint cracked, I suggest you buy some sandpaper and paint it with matte black spray paint, it will look perfect.

Drill the 7mm hole, put some epoxy in the hole, then press the inserts in and remove the excess epoxy?

Yes. But use the epoxy around the inserts, press them on the deck until they are fully flat to the surface, do not remove the excess until the next day when they are really hard and brittle this way you could just crack them out with a flat screwdriver and a hammer

![20180722_002040|690x388](upload://tvlUmKXyXnQVuT9VzFfIIdXrnyv.jpg)

![20180722_002104|690x388](upload://wONzjg8mxuXrvOc70w8ttIt9Mnt.jpg)

Fish paper won't stop the balance leads from shorting when rubbing against the bottom of the board, especially if they are compressed. It doesn't look like there is enough clearance between the bottom of the deck and the top of the battery.

channels in between each battery compartment (as seen above) would prevent things in the picture below from happening.

Are u not using a weatherstrip between the enclosure and the board? That'll give u an extra couple of mm to play with.

it comes with a mandatory $20 gasket, but that's just so the enclosure can have a more snug fit to the deck since it's not a precise fit. i'll post a picture of the solution I had to come up with later today when I get home. it's not pretty, but it works.

No, the 20700b are too big, maybe you could mount them sideways and try to fit a 10s3p.

@gmurad if you want a truly high discharge battery you need the Sanyo [20700A](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/sanyo-20700a-30a-3100mah-20700-bench-test-results-a-great-performing-30a-3100mah-battery.784543/)
 30A discharge not the [20700B](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/sanyo-20700b-4000mah-20700-bench-test-results-a-peek-at-the-future.775809/) which has a maximum discharge of only 16A.

Got my Jet Spud single stack in the other day.  It looks fantastic and fits the board perfectly.

What it doesn't fit is 10s3p of the NESE modules as I was afraid of.  I see these 3 options, what do you guys think:

1) Figure out a way to lift the single stack enclosure ~3/4" (~20mm) so I can fit 2 stacks of NESE modules

2) Buy a double stack enclosure and sell the single stack one

3) Buy a 10 or 11s3p spot welded battery from someone (@JLabs I know it's past the group buy but is it possible to purchase just the battery?)

4) (extra lazy option) Just swap my Wowgo Mini stuff straight to the jet spud and use the rest of the stuff I bought for another board.

What do you guys think?

@osbor is it weird to reply a month later? probably
I had the same problem, didn't realise the deck I ordered was drop down :flushed: but i love them both so i made it work.

sanded down the edges, mostly on the corners to make it sit closer. made this thing out of wood to hold the motor wires.

+1 for neoprene but wouldn't mind something a bit more rubbery. I find that once it's squished it takes a while to un-squish.

also, +1 for loctite. i lost a screw because I was too lazy to re-apply after opening it a few times ...whooops!

Hello Lee, unfortunatelly that cell would be too think, not even a double stack 3 row cell will fit because of height and length of each pocket, you need a custom enclosure, I'll be happy to make it if you get at least 3 guys interested.

Where are you getting these cells from?

Why are you getting the 40T (I'm gessing because of availability) when the 30T has the same discharge of 30A per cell and it's smaller?, just less capacity, you can also get the NCR20700a for also 30A of discharge and I do have an enclosure for it?

$ 5 to $ 7 in Alibaba.
Everyone's argument says that 30Q is good.
I own Raptor 2 and EVOLVE battery Mod and I understand the merit of 30Q.
I am interested in stepping up to a faster board and using 40T.
I have seen some pictures of your enclosure.
40T12S4P, I think that width and length probably do not matter.
I did not know the influence of the height of 3 mm so I asked a question.
504ｍｍ ｘ 140ｍｍ ｘ 21ｍｍ
691.2 Wh.
I think that is good.

The 40T and 30T are the same size, both 21700.  Also the 30T has a higher discharge at 35A and 3000mAh, while the 40T is 30A but 4000mAh.  Personally I'd go with the 40T over the 30T for the extra capacity.  I don't think the extra 5A discharge the 30T is capable of will make much of a difference, they're both putting out a ton of power, more likely that they'll rarely need to be working at full power... or whatever you would say, lol.  I'm terms of size though, I think the new Sony VTC6A is something that should strongly be considered.  It's a 3000mAh cell and 25A.  That's pretty close to the larger sized cells power but still in an 18650.  I'm keeping my eye out for that one :wink:

I'm super excited. After weeks of design, thowing design to the trash and go back to the drawing board I finished the Moonshine Sidekick enclosure, an enclosure for the most beautiful deck I ever had, it has the best characteristics perfect concave, perfect 35" length which makes it very portable but not much so it has a great stability for high speeds, has a useful kicktail and a sweet shape.

The enclosure was a challenge because I needed to fit a 10S4P at least and kicktail decks do not have much space between the trucks, you could also fit a 10S5P but you will need to mount some electronics on top of the battery but it has some space space to do so.

I've rode alot of deck this thing is my all time favorite deck I've bounced mine off a concrete wall the board is 20 pounds and does 40k ..a co worker/friend bugged me for  weeks wanted to try the board ..I finally said fine go hurt yourself then ..he has never skated a day in his life...BIG MISTAKE...well he lost control paniced in a wobble from a stone.. hit the throttle it went out from under him full throttle into the wall did two flips landed broke the battery pack in inside the enclosure from the brunt force..but the deck has abosolut nothing wrong barly like I mean barly a dent on the urathane rail on the nose...it is so tuff it unbelievable... MY TRICK DAY I DESTROYED ALOT OF DECK OFF CURBS stairs and walls...not landing tricks properly... moonshine say it's bullet proof and water proof I can tell you YES it is..by far one of best boards ever built to date...the stability and the foot  placement is perfect you can ride it hard or just cruise and push and carve all day as your feet don't get stressed from the shape of the deck..the rocker in the deck make it feel much lower then your average DH RACE DECK...unless a drop down will be lower...but it so nice for pushing and foot breaking...and the kick tail is perfect..the original deck was a 38 outlaw ..then ppl want smaller ..so the SIDEKICK came into play...34... this is the same like how Evo and the Evo falcon came in to play.40 evo and 36 falcon...because the short down hill racing board are going faster and have more power sliding control then the longer ones now thanks to technology..this is by far one of the best deck out there for our applications folks....ITs FUCKING LIGHT AS FUCK.. WATER PROOF ..IT HAS... PLASTIC RAILS ...TO SMASH OFF CURBS AND WALLS WHEN LOST AND OUT OF CONTROL it is .....UNDESTRUCTIBLE....
PS sorry for the novel..ppl should nknow about this beast I'm so stoked ...when are you taking my money @Eboosted

Well he had an early version of the new sixshooters he called Wobblies that sold at discount to make room for the final perfect version of new sixshooters.  No issues with those, though I did a touch of balancing on my originals ones (even ore-Wobblies, original design) way back ago. Nothing more than one would expect if you strive for beyond perfection lol. 

Congrats on your build and win!

@Eboosted Hey Alan (and fellow Vanguard 10S4P enclosure customers) - I finally got my battery from Kevin Dark, however even though Kevin managed to make a 10S4P Sony VTC6 pack as flush as possible, the actual enclosure could do with being 10mm deeper! I feel a bit deflated to be honest, as now I have to use some kind of rubber gasket to fill the gap, so it won't look as slick as the [photos on the website](https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/loaded-vanguard-enclosure-set-10s4p/).

![IMG_20180823_172754~2|690x306](upload://q38WeMoAZ8lfdKHb2eZhKowUMZ9.jpg)
(BMS protrudes ever so slightly, but does move to make the battery flush)

![IMG_20180823_172922|690x388](upload://AfzymNCfQ4mXoUPS3tMmwt4jX7w.jpg)

Does anybody have any further suggestions? Outside of potentially using a different enclosure.

Sorry to be negative, but this is the reality of the 10S4P enclosure that I have.

The BMS has it's own reserved space on the top compartment not over the battery, this will take quite some space.

Like this:
![wyF2PHY|666x500](upload://hsVlt9MFJgYNUTxTo9UCn8vBgAq.jpg)

Can you ask Kevin to modify the position of the BMS?

Did Kevin installed the battery in an offset array?

Hi Alan, I believe the problem actually lies with the curvature of the deck, the battery rocks from side to side on the apex of the curve. Like I say, if the enclosure was roughly 10mm deeper, with the same curvature that you've managed to mould into it, it would be perfect :-)

@Eboosted @mrjonnyjones

The BMS isn't a problem here, it's pretty much the same depth, of the cells. If you wanted to @mrjonnyjones you could cut that black tape and move the BMS wherever you like. Just thought it would be better than hanging loose.

Food for thought... VT6 cells are a fraction bigger than 30q cells...

## \#840 Posted by: Jc06505n Posted at: 2018-08-23T18:11:31.187Z Reads: 316

Then I advise relocating the BMS to get that space back. Also , you should put neoprene besides and below the enclosure to ensure that the components are moving around so much and to form an absolute gap between the enclosure and deck

edit: 

>Alan the BMS isn’t on top of the cells you realise? It’s at the end…

Ah in that case the problem is most likely the slightly bigger cell sizes adding up . While you might lose some clearance (nothing smallrisers wont fix) neoprene is the way to go

@Eboosted Alan, can you confirm that the enclosure has been made with 30Q 10S4P batteries in mind? I've tried the BMS re-location and it has made zero difference with the front of the battery 'rocking' on the apex of the deck - I still have a gap between the board and the enclosure. The only other options are to use a gasket (which will look visibly poor in my mind) or change my plan and use a different battery - as I love the look of your enclosure design. Thanks!

I did indeed see Kevin's comment, thank you. I would quiet honestly prefer not to use a gasket, because as far as I was aware when buying the enclosures, the enclosure was for a '10S4P' battery - with no mention of 30Q cells only. So I'd prefer to try and work with @Eboosted to get it looking as stock as possible without a gasket, as I love the look of Alan's enclosures as they are in the photos on his website :)

true it is a 18650 based battery, weird that vtc6 cells are slightly bigger then 30q.. i think if @Eboosted was aware of this he would specify meant that it's only meant for normally sized 18650 cells.

Approximate dimensions that I found on [IMR Batteries](https://www.imrbatteries.com/)...

**Sony VTC6:** 18.5mm x 65.2mm
**Samsung 30Q:** 18.33mm x 64.85mm

So they are slightly larger, but really not by much. Multiplied, though, it could have a snowball effect and create a slightly larger battery overall compared to using 30Q cells. This is what I'm a little annoyed about, but I'm sure there's a way around it... even if Alan can create a new enclosure that I'd happily pay for... however I could be being naive with regards to tooling etc.

With regards to Alan not knowing Sony cells wouldn't fit, for sure there would be something written on the website... I guess this is a learning curve for us all :rofl:

@never4getf150forums @mrjonnyjones

Yes, all 18650 cells have a variation in size from one brand to another. I thought it was more than this but having measured the two is seems the 30q are only 0.5mm smaller than the VT6, so I imagine is not the issue here...

What's weird is that there is so much gap in this instance, even more gap if you line the enclosure with 1-1.5mm of sound and vibration deadening neoprene.

I've pointed @mrjonnyjones in the direction of some 6-8mm rubber strips that can be used to make a gasket in this instance.

But for future reference @Eboosted, personally I'd make the enclosure at least 5mm deeper to allow the user to use neoprene on the deck side, as well as the inside of the enclosure.

I had the same problem. It isn’t the pack it is the enclosure I think. Neoprene have fixed my height difference. The white pack is a 10s4p. The gap between the deck and enclosure was to big. So I had made an 10s3p but still there was a problem with height

Yes, I saw your previous reply to @Eboosted. Alan's been fantastic - he's basically dismantled his Vanguard to re-shape the enclosure! So all of us that want to make 10S4P Vanguard builds will be able to do so, he's adding 15mm to the depth of the enclosure. I felt 15mm was enough to clear the battery and neoprene layers :)

Loving the sidekick enclosure. I’ve only seen the pictures of it on a blank deck.
Any with trucks and wheels?
Can you mount the motors forwards?
[/quote]

On the first version of the enclosure and 83mm wheels I wasn't able to mount the motors forward:

[img]https://i.imgur.com/py1hMeO.jpg[/img] 

I'm doing a modification on the enclosure and moving everything more towards the nose, this will give me enough space to mount dual 6355s belt driven system. 

I'm also designing a 12s5p moonshine sidekick enclosure that could hold a big 80A Bestech BMS for charge and discharge and vesc6s

Hello guys, quick update.

About a couple of months ago @Subsonic_Paul sent me a deck to work on an enclosure, it took me several weeks to complete the design but it's finally out.

Couldn't be happier with the final result, here is a version with heatsink:

Question to the heat sink.
Maybe you already answered but I missed it out.
It it made for any special esc? Or is it individual just heat sink plate where you can mount any pcb? Do you sell them already? 
If yes, only in combination with your enclosures or also separated? What will be the price?
I also would be interested to see the inner side of the heat sink.
Looks great by the way! Very nice work 👍

You can buy them [here](https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/dual-focbox-heatsink-installed/), it includes the cutting, installation and the heatsink itself.

 (totaling up to 10s4p) BMS (Approx. 53x63mm) and [Focbox Unity](https://www.enertionboards.com/focbox-speed-controller/focbox-unity-dual-motor-foc-controller-esc/) ? 

BMS: 53x63mm
FocBox Unity: 19x68x117mm
N.E.S.E 2s4p module: 22x74x188mm (with bolts on both ends)

Knowing the diameters of the enclosure interior space would be of great help. :slight_smile:

On the top of the Evo you have 185mm of width on the bottom part, just above the vesc compartment, you have 150mm of width. So unfortunately a 10s4p made of NESE modules won't fit on the Evo enclosure, Focbox unity will fit perfectly as well as the BMS. 

Nese modules take too much space, you are better off buying a boss lever spot welder, make a 12s5p and save money at the end, you just need to loose the feeling of fear to the challenge

Ah, dang. 

Just out of curiosity - would I have more luck with the new Subsonic Talon?
As I already have a set of NESE modules and wish not to spot weld my battery, just so I could still bring my board on flights. If the Talon can't fit the NESE modules either, I just might have to start spot welding my batteries and lose the ability to fly. These are just so amazing looking enclosures and I'm looking to upgrade my setup to be a bit more of an eyecandy.

Thanks for the reply! <3

I made short stop and adjusted only the rear truck and the stability was improved even more, the good thing is you can turn a lot on low speeds, you just need to press you heal/toes further down and it would turn around a  coin.

How do you make them so beautiful? How do you make those lines? 

If I had to guess, those lines are a part of the mould and your mould has a lot of tiny holes in them to pull the molten plastic in and conform to the tiniest of the detail on the mould.

EDIT: Ah so all these are fiberglass, with putty applied and painted. Nice!

The Vanguard 10s4p enclosure is the enclosure I have sold the most and had no complains in the past however if you are going to mount a a 10s4p made of Sony Vtc6 you need to choose that variant which has more height because those cells have a higher diameter than regular cells.
```

---
## \#948 Posted by: jaatis Posted at: 2018-10-01T14:16:59.395Z Reads: 317

Just out of curiosity I measured multiple cells of VTC6's and 30Q's and many of the VTC6 cells were actually thinner or the same diameter. There was as much difference between each brand's cells as there was between Sony and Samsung cells, if that makes sense. So in general I wouldn't say VTC6's are bigger.

Anyway I'm definitely considering your beautiful enclosures for my next build :slight_smile:

Hey @Eboosted!
I need an enclosure for my deck and your yet spud ss enclosure already comes close to what could fit under my deck.
The thing is that in the middle part it’s only about 20,5cm.
Do you think it’s possible to remove a bit from the side to make it fit?

4 Focbox 12s8p, fat boy antispark and enough space for a charge only BMS. This enclosure is huge. If I was going 2wd I could have fit a 12s10p

My new enclosures arrived, they look great! Thanks Alan!

Just in case anyone is wondering, the 12s Universal Enclosure is a dead ringer for the Evolve Bamboo deck.

https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/12s-universal-enclosure/

Here is a picture of the enclosure just sitting on top of the standard BGT enclosure.

I'd say yes they can take, however the The Evolve BMS will cut power down a lot as it will restrict the current flowing to the motors, so my vote is for a dual VESCs

@blackship, on that deck you should use the hs11 enclosure SS or DS, it has the same length of the hs11 and holypro 35.

Have you seen @Chopper64 build, he used the [MBS Pro Retalion](https://www.mbs.com/parts/11418-mbs-pro-95-deck-retaliation) it's a gorgeous deck and the HS11 enclosure also fits like a glove :scream:

[/quote]

The Trampa HS11 was a really nice deck because it had no holes on the center, this was good for waterproofing the battery pack and electronics, the carver deck is nice too but it sits to high from the ground for my taste, looks a bit goofy, the hs11/HolyPro 35 looks like a race car close to the ground. Lastly, the HolyPro 35 deck is the same as the HS11 but you need to cover the holes with fiberglass or epoxy, the result is also nice but some people won't buy it because of this, if you use urban thread tires the looks is awesome, low but not as much so you can run over all speedbumps on the street.

Here is my trampa holypro 35 with holes covered and urban threads, I love it:

I guess they think we might be running an international drugs ring by infusing the resins with drugs??

One sheet of high grit and one of low grit count sand paper:

1. Sand the part you need to cover and clean it
2. Apply car filler with the putty knife, let it dry well
3. Sand it down with low grit and finish it and detail it with high grit
4. Clean the surface and apply spray paint 20cm away from the target and let it dry

Enjoy a brand new enclosure whenever you want even though you have scratched it over curbs :sunglasses:

So uh, since you bought a Kut-thaka, will you be making an enclosure for it? :joy:
[/quote]

The Kut-Thaka has a really small wheelbase of only 17.5cm, I'll have to make a custom enclosure for it, but the ammount of batteries will be very limited unless I go double stack.

If I go double stack I could fit a 12s4p which would be crazy fast for such a small deck, may a 10S3P could be squeezed in a single stack there but with no space for BMS.

I'm sorry I meant 17.5", but that's with the inner wheelbase position. Would anyone be able to meassure the wheelbase with the outter position?

Did anyone try fitting the [Trampa HS11/HolyPro 35 DS](https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/trampa-hs11-holypro-35-ds/) enclosure on a [Trampa short board](https://www.trampaboards.com/35-short-mountainboard-deck--drilled-edged-fitted-with-jessop-grip-tape--a-marine-grade-stainless-steel-hex-head-bolt-kit-p-871.html)?

Looking at the differences between the schematics of the Holypro and the Short boards, the only relevant difference seems to be the width of the mid section, which is 226mm on the short board instead of 230mm on the holypro. I guess it all depends on how much margin is there in the mid section. Or maybe I'm completely overlooking something here? 

I saw @Nowind (Hi Jens) [post above](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eboosted-enclosures-thread/38073/192), but his short board is cut exactly at that mid section and he was using a slightly different enclosure, so I'm still not sure.

Cool! Can you share some more information / pictures?
What PCB did you use? 
It looks like you are running the balancing leads "traditionally" (and not using the PCB). Is that true?
Can you share how you connected each 8p pack to the PCB (I only saw 4p packs)?
I can't spot the serial connection. Did you use a bride mash wire? If so, can you link to it?

Thanks in advance.

I was able to mount a 10s3p with dual focboxes and a charge only bms, you could fit a 12s3p with no bms otherwise you could also squeeze it on top of the focboxes.

@Eboosted I saw you are making an enclosure for 12s4p 20700 on the Trampa HolyPro35 deck. Will it be the same as for the Trampa street carver? I'm building a 10s4p 20700 pack with a bms (same size as 8*20700 cells) and Focbox Unity. I have made a rough fiberglass enclosure for it with 16 cells in the 1st pod then 3 pods with 8 in each then the last pod is the same size as the 1st and has the electronics. When it breaks I'd like to get one of yours to really finish off my deck.

This is where I got mine. The price per Wh is a bit higher but the package shape means I can get a 17Ah 10s 4p in  400mm of battery length instead of say a 30q pack with 15Ah 10s5p taking up 450mm of battery length. 2mm thicker and 10 mm wider to gain that much battery capacity in a shorter pack, that's still got for around 80A, That's worth the few extra dolarydos for me.

On the 20700B you can only get 15A on each cell for a total of 60A on a 12S4P form, discharge is too low for a Carver deck with pneumatics from my point of view. I rather use a 12s4p made of Samsung 30Q 18650 or even Sony VTC6 instead for 80A discharge.

If range is very important to you a better choice would be a NCR20700A, that on a 12S4P array will give you a craxy 120A of discharge, that'd be EPIC!

The Moonshine sidekick DS enclosure is ready :grinning:

Can't wait to try this beast on the board, it has a lot of room for a full size BMS and 2 VESCs 6.

As the Sidekick is a motorcycle inspired deck I came up with a a grip tank bike design for it:
[img]https://i.imgur.com/MKs4lIr.jpg[/img]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/IH3ZFyd.jpg[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/JLllq9v.jpg[/img]

The enclosue is able to hold more than 60 18650 cells, however a 12S6P would be perfect if want to run a full size BMS even the BIG ones plus two FocBoxes.

If you want to go crazy and need extremely long range you could fit a 10S8P, completely unnecesary for everyday use but there are a lot of insane guys around here so they might find this a pretty nice starting point.

At the bottom I left a flat surface in order to allow an ESC aluminum heatsink fitment.

I have both, they are similar in size. I think the spud is wider.

In my limited time with the kutaka (which is still non electric), my preference is still the spud (electric), but you can't ollie a spud as easily.

Some of my other friends love the kutaka because of the very usable tail.

Yes, it's definitely more compact than the spud, way narrower, looks sleek. The enclosure may have a double stack enclosure otherwise you won't be able to mount anything larger than a 10s2p, I'd love this deck with a 12s3p, a 12s2p made of ncr20700a would be ideal for 60A discharge and two focboxes.

## \#1113 Posted by: erikringsmuth Posted at: 2018-11-25T22:28:33.380Z Reads: 311

I'm new here (first post) and am trying to spec out my first build. I want to do a Loaded Vanguard build with a slight variation from other builds I've seen here. I want to use the FocBox Unity combined with the eBoosted enclosures and 10S4P battery.

* FocBox Unity https://www.enertionboards.com/focbox-speed-controller/focbox-unity-dual-motor-foc-controller-esc/
* eBoosted 10S4P battery https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/10s4p-battery-for-loaded-vanguard/
* eBoosted BMS https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/bms-for-charging-10s/
* eBoosted power port https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/dust-proof-power-port/

I don't have any electrical experience so I'm wondering what's involved wiring this up. @eboosted the battery says it comes with a XT60 connector and the BMS mentions it includes the labor for wiring the balance leads to the battery.

If I get this setup, do I just need to connect the battery XT60 to the FocBox XT60 or is there other wiring I need to do?

Thanks, Erik

I talked to @eboosted in the past. You need to wire your own BMS, but to be honest, soldering shouldn't be that hard. You can pm him and talk about including an anti-spark switch and charging port.
```

I will wire the balance leads of the BMS for you, this is the hardest part, you will only need to locate the charging port where you want it and run the negative to the BMS and positive to the battery. 

The battery will have an xt90 so you just plug it to the unity to the extension wire on one end, (you need to make it yourself as the length needs to be measured on your own build) and the unity at the other end. 

It's extremely easy to do that

So today I'm releasing the Evo 39" DS V2.

The difference between this and the V1 is the length of the nose and tail which gives you more room for inwards motor mounts for both 4WD and 2WD applications.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/U6nXeEC.jpg[/img]

As you can see it has the same central shape as it's prececesor but still wraps the microdrop but will give you more room.

This enclosure should hold a 12s8p no problem

@mackann shipping tomorrow

No, but when my battery was in the single stack, I guess I may have had a litle more foam around my battery than that(I know yours is not built yet but I asked for my pack to be waterproof** :slight_smile:), I was having clearance issues with bolting the battery to the deck evenly, without putting high amounts of pressure on the enclosure

** As much as possible

There is plenty of room between the batteries and deck on the Spud SS enclosure, no clearances issues at all AFAIK.

@chase the Spud SS 12s3p is great but you won't have space for a BMS unless you mount it over the cells, I haven't tried that but it might be a tight fit.

Hello man, sorry about the lack of response, I though I had responded everyone. 

Your order is still on hold because it was placed with a Black Friday discount coupon, as I stated on my BF sale  thread, these orders will be fulfilled in February, because in order to offer these prices I have to consolidate a big order quantity. 

If you are in a rush I could put you in front of the line but you will have to waive the discount.

Let me know

@Eboosted have you been riding your sidekick much now that the double stack is on there? 
Hows the clearance in turning in the front?

Hey guys, I'm in the process of mounting the ESC enclosure to my Vanguard Flex 1.

I'm just a little unsure of the placement. Does this look ideal, or would you recommend it being closer to / further from the motor?

I'm a little worried about the wiring getting too stressed whilst turning, and subsequently wearing out. ![20190109_173731|281x500](upload://xlOEBGiLeQeci82ahBG2pbn16Z8.jpeg)

This is the worst way to make the wires exit the motor, they will short in no time due to the insulation wearing out

The best is to exit them facing the hanger and do a large bend and them route into the enclosure, also is good practice to hold the motor wires to the mount as soon as it exit the motor, this way it can't get damaged by rubbing into the motor itself

About the enclosure position, you can put it closer to the motor, just make sure you still have a gap when turning hard

@odysseus position it a little lower so the shape of the deck follows the outline of the ESC enclosure, but take into consideration the motor mounts won't touch the enclosure on full leans. 

M5 x 20 works good on the Vanguard

I suggest you don't do that if you want to attract too much attention, inwards mottors will give you not only a sleeker look but it'll be very easy to grad the front frucks and carry it like a carry-on luggage.

Wire your phase motors differently, look the forum for pictures

Run the wires from the motor back towards the truck, then turn and go to the ESC.  It's less flex and wear on the wires.

Also, I ended up using M4 x 20, which seem to have done the trick.

At last, finally I finished the Loaded Kut-thaka enclosure, I chose to make a DS from the begining which can hold a 12s4p, two focboxes and a BMS, or a unity, o didn't choose to make an SS enclosure as it would only hold a 12s2p which might not cut it for the mayority of people.

Hope you guys like it.

So made a couple of tests and it seems the HS11 SS will fit the almighty Samsung 30T 21700 cells without issues in a 12s3p array in which case your will have a maximum discharge of 105A instead of 80A of a regular 12s4p of the Samsung 30Q cells.

Hey Eboosted, How were you able to secure the heat sink so clean? I was thinking If I could find someone to make a bottom heatsink for the unity (not needed but I at least want to relieve as much stress that the unity can possibly go through) that I would do this to the Single Stack Jet Spud enclosure.

AH I see the you said it's epoxied.

So I’ve been working with @Subsonic_Paul a custom enclosure for their beautiful Century 40 for a couple of months and this is the final outcome.

https://www.eboardsperu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20190225_154356.jpg

I’m really proud of the final product as makes this beautiful deck even nicer. The design process was long but worth it, it went back to the drawing board several after several unsuccessful/average attempts.

The Century is a pretty long and wide deck, however it doesn’t feel too long or wide under your feet. This specific design allowed us to create an enclosure big enough to fit a 13S5P made of 18650 for a maximum discharge of 100A:

![](https://i.imgur.com/k5WdCJq.jpg)

if you use the Samsung 30Qs and, if you are are insane and need a crazy discharge you could fit a 12s4p battery pack made of the newest Samsung 21700 30T cells, that crazy setup will give you 140A of maximum discharge.

You cannot mount the motors on the inside. They will only fit on the outside because of the wedge. Take it from me . I have one. Only if your mounts are very small in length will you be able to fit them on the inside.

Edit: Also would a pre order for 2 help speed along development?

What mounts are you using. I've found that If I turn my motors inwards, i hardy get any clearance. 

How much clearance do you get with this setup is what I'm interested in knowing. Also love the channel for the cables. Maybe i need to use a bigger riser?

Hey Alan and @ducktaperules is this happening? is somebody sending Alan a carver deck to model off? I would also be happy to pre order as well, for a 20700 carver deck enclosure. I would send my carver deck but its impractical as I'm in Australia.

after a long time looking at the cost and performance of 18650 and 21700 cells i ended up coming to the conclusion that a 12s4p 18650 was the best "bang for buck". 21700 would give more Wh but at an increased cost per Wh and increased weight.
Then at about the same time i as looking kaly made his enclosures available through his website so i ended up ordering 2 of his 18650 enclosures for the carver. he also has a 21700 version but it only fits the hs11/holypro. the kaly enclosure is cheaper but shipping costs more, as i was buying 2 i only pay shipping once.

The wires you'll need to run down the sides of the P-group have to be insulated too.  So much insulation.  There isn't really a such thing as too much fishpaper, but beyond 3 layers I'm not sure how much you're gaining.  It's mostly that there will be a bunch of little things that can't touch a bunch of other little things

A 12s4p is the perfect battery, it will also give you more range than a 10s4p and will accelerate way faster, people always think than going 12s vs 10s will make your board to ride at extreme speeds that's not correct at all, I regularly read people comments saying "I'm not going 12s because I don't plan to run insane speeds", as if the only variable to run fast is the battery and nothing more. 

You could run a really fun board by going 12s and using a really high gear reduction. For instance, on my Sidekick I run 12s5p on 2:1 gear ratio, 190kv motors and 85mm Caguamas, max speed is 51km/hr and the full throttle acceleration puts a smile on my face everyday.

What about the strain of 12s on the VESC? 

[quote="b264, post:8, topic:44459, full:true"]
Because the parts used in the vesc circuit shouldn’t be run that high, especially with a reactive load like motor windings. I’m not trying to run my controller on the razor edge of what’s possible because it increases failure rate. I’d prefer if the board failing on me was kept to an extreme minimum, especially if it means I lose brakes and definitely if it means a $150+ part is the thing failing

Lots of people run at 12S but I also hear of lots of failures. To me, not failing is a very important metric and thus I can’t consider it. Most consumer electronics are designed with a 40% margin at least, the components in the VESC being rated at 60V and 63V means 8S would meet that criteria, so 10S is already over the normal. 12S is too close

It's not a myth; the DRV8302 is only rated at 60V.  On applications like this, real engineers never push the parts past 60% to 75% which means 42V, especially driving highly inductive loads (like BLDC motor windings) using square waves (like VESC)

Of course, if it's your face that might hit the street on any malfunctions, you are free to design yours however you'd like to.

You are right, it's not a myth is very frecuent problem found on some 4.12 VESCs when used at 12S and FOC, so my mistake. Nevertheless, from my own experience and several others, I've been pushing FocBoxes for years at 12S and never had any single DRV8302 error to the point I feel pretty confident and happy to suggest people with doubts about going between 10S in BLDC to 12S in FOC, to choose the latest.

Just devils advocating here.. but... 

DRV8302 Spec maxes at 60V
Assuming TI's Electrical Engineers are 'Real Engineers' which means that they would also apply the 60-75% max rule to their component when specc'ing. 

Wouldn't that mean that the DRV8302's real max is 80-100v? Which would also mean that if you took 60-75% off the 60v... you'd really be at like 30-40 percent of the 'real max' rating?

My deck is ordered but hasn't even been pressed yet so I can't say how well it fits.  No damage though.  Looks like an enclosure.  Feels pretty flexible in my hands - which I was hoping for.  So far so good.

Those are TKPs.  Engraved with "Blue Shark".  The bushings they came with are too soft for a skating world tank like me.  I'm pushing 90 kilos, not the 70 kilos these things are meant for.  I will put in stiffer bushings (I like the hard insert Bones) but I still think I might need to add risers to keep the widest corners of the enclosure from hitting the ground.

Speaking of sharks, these are the motor mounts @akhlut designed for me.  I love this community.  It is so smoove to tell engineering friends I have parts coming in from around the world for my skateboard.  I'm always quick to mention Peru.

They were intended for that.  It is the "Flying Tigers" logo.  The Flying Tigers were three squadrons of fighter pilots and aircraft that volunteered to fight for China against Japan under US command before the US joined WWII.  The logo is cut to go on either side of an aircraft nose.

The height to width ratio only works on the front of the enclosure because of the longer sloped flat there.  I will push the two stickers together.

@Eboosted Hi Alan, has your website been hacked? I just went on to get the Vanguard enclosures link for somebody on Facebook and I got a load of strange stuff pop up, it happens whenever you click a link to take you to a different part of your website! Below is just one example:

It seems like there's some kind of malicious code opening or attempting to open a new pop-up page on your first attempt to click the top menu.

If I close the pop-up I can still navigate to where I'm trying to go but something fishy is definitely going on. 

Did you set the website up yourself or did someone else?

https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/85683/hacking/wp-live-chat-plugin-bug.html

I think it might be this. Says you need to update the plugin for your Wordpress site to fix the issue.

Why do I think so? Because in the HTML page under the comment "WPLC custom JS" there's a script that gets included. In your browser's dev tools under sources if you open yourservice.live/javascript-mini.js there's a line
`var _td = String.fromCharCode(a bunch of numbers)`
and then the next line evaluates that. Those numbers are just there to obfuscate the malicious script that runs.

I've heard from others in the web dev industry that wordpress sites and their plugins get security flaws like this constantly. If you can, move over to something else in the future :wink:

To quote from the article I sent:

> Since “admin_init” hooks can be called visiting either /wp-admin/admin-post.php or /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php, an unauthenticated attacker could use these endpoints to arbitrarily update the option  “wplc_custom_js”. “

So you should go into your site's admin panel or what have you, and find that option (wplc_custom_js) and reset it / remove the attacker's malicious script include / maybe clear it?

Edit: Brent's suggestion is probably the best, you can never be too sure that's the only thing the attackers had access to.

Edit no. 2: Realized there's a [dedicated thread about this.](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/looking-for-help-from-web-experts/94344/6) Whoops. Mods can move these messages over to there if they care.

In the middle of all these website hassles, @Eboosted noticed, without me asking, that I had placed an order and the shipping was more than the cost of the parts.  He refunded most of the cost of shipping that was standard on his site.  After I already paid it.  I really appreciate that.  It is not very often that a business reduces their advertised prices without even being asked.

Hey @Eboosted,

My HAYA deck snapped when I stood on it but I had all my build planned for it over months. Now I'm looking for another deck and wondering if you have any enclosure that would work

The layout was going to be something like this:

![image|690x335](upload://x4sc5heLBQlZorkjBTJBik9p2IM.jpeg) 

It needs to be at least 23mm high and ~674mm long.

Thanks

Hey man, unfortunately I'm really far away in Sounth America, so the shipping is usually high, I even pay some of the shipping cost to EU in order to keep it acceptable.

The best way to lower shipping cost if to order more than one, you can make also a group buy I sell several enclosures to UK a month, you just need to put some people together

Hello guys, I'm pretty excited to release the new HS11/HolyPro SS enclosure for 20700/21700 cells.

This enclosure request has been made so many times I lost count, this was a challenge to create because the Trampa HS11/HolyPro deck is very narrow and the length was not ideal to fit 21700 cells. However, I was able to completely redesign this enclosure from scratch and made it long enough to hold a 12S4P made of 21700 cells.

The design has an extended flare on the nose and tail, which not only allows to increase the pockets length but to help a perfect seal for waterproofing making it ideal for rainy days.

Now you can fit Samsung 30Ts for an insane 140A of discharge on a just a single stack slim enclosure, Sanyo 20700s can also be used and they fit like a glove.

The Vanguard 12s can accommodate 12s3p made of 21700 cells, this will give you 105A of maximum discharge which is more than a 12s5p made of 30Qs,but it will requiere a 6mm rubber gasket

Interesting.  I plan on getting two enclosures from you. One evolve and the other probably the switchblade.  I assume you provide both inserts and gaskets with each enclosure purchase?

Currently he is making an enclosure for the 40" with room for 12s4p of 21700 cells, but I'd love to see the 38" get a version in the future as well, because the 38" is the perfect size for a board imo.

I'm sorry about this but your project needs a really thick enclosure, not all enclosures look good on double stack, the deck needs to have curves and subtle shapes in order for the enclosure to to make it flow and look good such as the Evo DS or Trampa HS11 DS.

That's why I decided to make a 12S4P 21700 on the switchblade single stack

My latest creation, the @longhairedboy Witchblade, a freaking huge enclosure for power hungry skaters with a beautiful design that matches the agressive design of the deck, the enclosure looks really flat but that´s just part of the design because on the inside is huge and could hold a 12S5Pmade of NCR20700A cells or 12S5P of 30Qs

Yeah, that was suggested over on the cool site. Its likely the best solution for a production mold, just means a little more investment of money and time learning how to do it... both of which im a little short on right now 🤣

Definitely keen on trying it though. Would a silicone 'skin' in a fibreglass mold be the right idea? Or just a straight silicone mold? I imagine you would need to use a lot of silicone for a straight silicone mold to hold its shape well enough...

Th HS11 fits the Kaly perfectly.

Hey @Eboosted I'm looking at buying the 12s4p enclosure set for the loaded vanguard. Im just wondering if the measurement for the case height is accurate, because it looks like there's around 1.6 inches of clearance? I have a pack that is 1.5 inches tall (30q's stacked vertically, not offset like in your builds) and I don't want it to be crushed, I suppose this also depends if the case is slightly flexible.

My second question is would the esc case fit a flipsky 6.6 FSESC? It's a bit larger than the 4.12 esc's you've listed on your website. It looks like it should be good but do you have measurements for the esc case?

If the battery is not offset then it might not work, you may have luck adding a rubber gasket from my shop. 

Send me the meassures of the FSESC and I'll tell you it it fits

Can you share any examples you might have of people using the 3dservisas heatsink plate with your vanguard VESC enclosure? 

I'm just trying to see ways others have done it so I hopefully don't have to start cutting it up 👀

This one: ![20190923_182224|243x500](upload://fZnGD1DMlcjDldjNOTD1aUxmxEC.jpeg) 

Which is approx:
 * Whole size: 150mm <small>(5.91")</small> x 80mm <small>(3.15")</small> x 28mm <small>(1.1")</small>
* Heatsink size: 135mm <small>(5.31")</small> x 65mm <small>(2.56")</small> x 6mm <small>(0.24")</small>
```
