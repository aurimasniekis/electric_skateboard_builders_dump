Hi everyone...
Sadly I‚Äôve decided to gave up my build, it‚Äôs really hard to import batteries to my country Indonesia. eventho‚Äô some of you already try their best to help me üòä thank you (i didn‚Äôt have the knowledge to built one my self üòÅ). I decided to sell parts that i‚Äôve already bought. They are all new and never been used, i want to sell them all (not separately), so if any of you interested and want to make an offer, just DM me. Shipping will be from Indonesia, kinda expensive so thats why i‚Äôm not selling part by part. 

Here‚Äôs the list:

Trucks: Caliber 50 Black x2 (45$) ***SOLD***
Wheels: Trampa Stickies 90mm Black (90$)
Belt: Enertion HTD 265-5M 12mm x4 (30$)
Wheel Pulley l: Enertion 36T 12mm x2 (30$)
Motor Pulley: 15T 12mm (15$)
Remote: Enertion Nano-X Controller (70$)
Speed Controller: Enertion Focbox (130$) ***SOLD***
Motor: Eskating 6374 190KV 3250W Sealed Sensored with keyway and JST adapter (110$) ***SOLD***

***i also have some support part that i could give you for free, such as riser, wiring mesh, glue, screw/bolt for enclosure, anything needed for the build just DM me***

shipping all items from indonesia to US/EU/AUS are 80$ for 3.5kg, but i‚Äôll take the additional cost, you can also check them by yourself. ***READ THE UPDATE BELOW***

You can try order 4x 5s1p lipo's to make a 10s2p battery. This will make it a lot easier to ship them to Indonesia. Still requires some knowledge on how to assemble batteries but it's very simple. Just plug stuff in. Not too experienced with Lipos though, @GrecoMan can help.

All you need to know. Good luck.
