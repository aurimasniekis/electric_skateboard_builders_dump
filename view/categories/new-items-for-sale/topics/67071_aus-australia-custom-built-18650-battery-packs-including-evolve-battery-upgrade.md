Hi All, 
I am now offering a battery build service to Australian eSk8'ers looking for 18650 battery packs. Sorry can not post overseas due to Frieght laws here. Details of a battery build for my Bamboo GT can be seen here: [Bamboo Upgrade](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/evolve-bamboo-gt-12ah-battery-upgrade/65235)
I have a choice of cells
Samsung 25R's, Samsung 30Q's and LG HG2'S. I can get others but there would be a 2 week lead time increase.
I am based in Perth but can send Australia wide for $35 which includes postage insurance. That means 100% money back guarantee on non delivery of battery.
The most common cell used is the 30Q's, prices are:
10S3P $390
10S4P $440
10S5P $520
Quotes provided for all other build specs. I use 0.2mm pure Nickel strips and 4mm2 flat copper braided wire for cell connections and 12AWG for power leads. Choice of power connectors available. 
For Evolve battery swaps an Evolve compatible BMS 11 way connector is fitted as well as the AMASS power connector. BMS balancing wires are 24AWG.
The cells are taped together with fibre reinforced tape and shrink wrapped.

The BMS power connections can come with SUPRA gold plated bullet connectors to give you an easy swap for future batteries or hot swapping a second battery, no solder changing. 
I have also designed a battery cover extension for Evolve Bamboo covers to fit the extra long battery in without moving the BMS location. This is free with 10S4P battery packs.

Hey @Marsen, how many parallel nickel strips do you use, and do you have a photo of an unwrapped pack? I'm interested to see the copper braid.
```

## \#5 Posted by: Marsen Posted at: 2018-09-05T09:33:40.379Z Reads: 299

I use 2 Nickel strips across all four cells and then weld the copper braid piece on which is another Nickel strip with the copper pre-soldered ![Braid|690x422](upload://fdLXFxT4f50ktBskkszU5NzWRCK.jpg)
This is not as long and only covers the three cells of each group of 4.  Therefore it's two nickel strips for the furthest two cells then three strips for the closet three cells as the current is increasing as you go along. The copper connects between cell 3 and 4. 
Does that make sense?
I'm building a pack over the weekend so will post more photos as I build that one.

Yep makes perfect sense. Have you done a replacement pack for an Evolve Carbon (not GT) before? I'm thinking of a 10s4p 30Q as my battery is on its last legs.

No. I've done 4 Bamboo batteries and 5 custom built boards (all using 12S), one with a split pack( 2x 6S4P). Also battery packs for a guy that makes ROV's and a couple of packs for a robotics company in Perth.
Using the flat braided copper makes the pack a couple of mm narrower so it fits in the Evolve case easier on Bamboo boards not sure what the width is on Carbon boards. The BMS balancing wire runn on the top edge alongside the silcone power lead from the positive. I don't like how some run them through the middle between the two rows of cells.

Hello Krazor,
Yes I can fit it into the enclosure with a BMS if you want, have done a few DIY 12S builds. I am just about to order some 12S BMS's from Bestech with E switch. It's an upgrade from the D223v1 which is popular on esk8. Haven't got a price yet waiting on a quote. What enclosure do you have?

no enclosure yet, this is for a DIY Trampa build im working on. going to be ordering it soon. i was thinking of a flexi under mount enclosure with battery BMS and anti spark power switch installed. a price would be great, i plan on putting it on 17ply 35º HOLY PRO MTB Deck from Trampa. i would like to fit 2 FOCBOX esc in enclosure as well. would love to make it water proof too. i dont have any particular enclosure in mind, though if you do i would love to know your thoughts.

im looking at something similar to the build cody00 made in his post here

Hey @krazor, I have a Trampa Urban Carver with the enclosure from @Eboosted. Mine is set up as an all terrain mountain board. I've been talking with @Marsen for some time and he built me a 12s4p to suit the enclosure. My ESC's, etc are mounted in a separate case on top though. 
I have seen some builds with the ESC's included in the enclosure so I'm sure it is possible, but it would mean changing the way the batteries are laid out.
As far as quality and advice, etc, you will find it hard to find a better person than Mark (@Marsen). If anyone can make it happen, then he is your man.

That looks like things are crammed in at the controller end. The battery fits easily enough. Same enclosure as Ants. Ant has had to pack out around the battery to stop vibration because there is plenty of room just the length of the battery makes things tight with the electronics. There are so many enclosures to choose from, checking out what others have done is your best guide. Then pick what best suits your needs.

@krazor - If you haven't seen it yet, have a look at one of the builds that @rich has done: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/urban-burro-trampa-carver-14ply-mini-vertigo-trucks-10s4p-vtc5-with-bms-dual-sensored-6355-aps-130kv-esk8-controller-1-1-idea-motor-mounts-4-0-trampa-underboard-tray-7-pneumatics-and-125mm-gummies-on-superstar-hubs/66503

He's managed to get everything to fit in the enclosure to give a very nice, clean build. He's a good guy and I'm sure would be happy to give you advice on how he put it all together.

Thanks everyone for all the kind words, its a build im thinking about doing witch is on the fence, still goat get pricing on Battery enclosure, Motors pullys and gears. so far without these items its just over 3k which is on the pricey side. so looking at dropping the price any way possible without sacrificing quality or building it over time =)

Yeah man, the cash is a big issue. If I would have known how much this was going to cost me, prior to going into it, then I'm not sure I would have gone through with it. Plus, you have the wait time on parts, etc....

I must add, that the satisfaction of making your own build and being able to customise the way every component fits the final build is pretty cool though. 
Nothing like stepping onto your board, and riding, knowing that you have made it all work.

Thanks, yeah it's good there's a few options for batteries out there. I kept my prices the same as tinniesinker rather than be in competition. Most of the batteries I'm making are for Perth guys. Esk8 is a great source of info. I love all the different mods people are trying on their boards. I'm keen to build a carbon board from scratch, I've made surfboards before but never used carbon fibre. I'm also working on a bolt on 6Ah battery booster for Evolve boards too. It's easy to get addicted to this stuff and perhaps a little carried away 😂

Still back and forth on planes with the day job. I enjoy building batteries plus it's a way of paying for more projects. Saving up for a cnc router next, keen to do a diy one rather than off the shelf. I'm half way through building a vacuum forming machine at the moment, so got plenty to keep me busy.

im trying to find pricing on parts at the moment currently its looking between 3.5-4k to build though i need to ensure i can get higher speeds than my WoWGO board, i find top speed nice and all but i think its only really usable around the city and short trips im looking at making this build as a speed freak type of thing. still haven't picked motors mounts and drive system style yet but im probably going to look more into belt drive and some alternative mounts, they are very expensive for no reason might even end up CNC my own mounts if it turns out to be a lot cheaper. looked at hobby king they have motor mounts for $13

Hobbyking mounts are only for Calibre II trucks, they won't fit TB218 properly and are also nonadjustable. Quite a few people have use this mount by @dickyho https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/CNC-motor-mount-for-50-63-motors-for-DIY-eskate-electric-skateboard/302775190943?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=601716797808&_trksid=p2060353.m1438.l2649
It is proven to be a decent mount, cheap adjustable, with idlers, you can message him for a longer mount which is great for reverse mount, which I currently use

Just a thought. If top/high speeds are your priority, then maybe Trampa is not your best option? The Trampa decks seem to be more popular for those who want a smooth, carvy, experience, or for those (like me) who want a board for all terrain.
If you want to build a board with top speeds in mind, then there are probably some better suited options.

[/quote]


That's a really hard question to answer. I've seen some builds with the Trampa gear that are getting some good top speed, but from what I understand, you have things like the flex in the deck and trying out different Dampa's to get the best results. Eliminate the flex in the deck and also the spring trucks and you have removed two main factors.
Also, as also mentioned, the ecalc app can give you some good baseline data. I've used it as a guideline but as with all things, nothing can beat real practical data.

Bottom line, if you are looking at a 3-4k budget, then make sure the gear you want is the right stuff for you. The deck and trucks can make a big difference. 
Use the search function and find the guys on here that are looking for speed and talk to them. People such as @Kug3lis and @Cobber spring to mind, but there are others on here as well.

thanks for the advice.

i was talking with a couple of guys on one of the facebook groups and it came down to a more practical approach which i was happy to do which would consist of these

5:1 ratio with Turnigy SK8 6374-192KV Sensored Brushless Motor (14P)
12s5p 

this should get aprox 50kmh speed and 35km distance which im more than happy with, what i was looking for before was more of an unrealistic reach which i now understand but having these specs would be comfortable also.

Definatly not expecting to reach my expectations, though it would have been great if it were possible. but the next best thing is also fantastic as i posted above, 50kmh 35km distance 12s5p 5:1 ratio with 175mm Tyres

these specs seem pretty good to me. not that i would be able to ride for 35km but not having to worry about running out of juice is fairly important.

Hey Marsen

What's the lead-time on a 30Q 10S4P with 10way balance connector? My BMS doesn't use a negative balance lead. Same layout suited for Evolve GTX enclosure. Postage to Sydney.

Let me know. :slight_smile:

Hi Daniel,
If I had the 10 way connector then 1 week till postage. There are lots of different type jst connectors do you know which type it is? 1.5mm pitch, 2mm pitch. XH, PH. The possibilities are many.

That, good sir, is a fantastic question. And I don't know the answer to that. I believe it's at least JST XH, and my guess for pitch would be 2.54 if that's a thing.

Here is the link to the item I purchased if that gives you a better idea. If not, don't fret. 10 balance cables taped off and labelled accordingly would also be sufficient. I can then terminate on my end. If that's not up to your standards and how you operate, however, I absolutely understand.

Hello @asuras,
I keep a large stock of 30Q's but have just ran out of HG2's as I had a wholesale buy and they took the lot. I have requested an invoice for a new order on Friday so hope to hear back today so I can order them in. It will be a couple of weeks for them to turn up. If your still keen then I'll book you in for a 10S5P build for that week. I'll message you when they are here and then again on build completion. I am giving a 3 week lead time at the moment due to the present work load which should work out just right anyway. 10S5P in HG2's is $540, prices have increased recently because the exchange rate has been slowly deteriorating.  @TinnieSinker lives in Brisbane you could see if he is still working on batteries and get a price from him as he is local. More than happy to make one for you tho so let me know.

Hi @Marsen, I am interested in having a 10S4P 30Q pack made, the details are:

- it's for a scooter that has a plastic tub underside, so will have to send dimensions
- from my measurements, 10 deep x 4 wide, with the batteries vertical (brick shape) will fit
- this is my very first esk8 build (bear with me), single 6374 motor, already have a Focbox
- ideally if I can get it made with a BMS, then I can source the appropriate charger
- I am based in Melbourne

Let me know if that sounds possible. Cheers!

@MrFidgety  Most things are possible, it's just a case of what fits in the enclosure you have. Let me know what configuration and layout you want and I can build it. I buy Bestech BMS's and also a smart bms with bluetooth connectivity. You can give me a call and we can talk about what you want. I've PM'd my phone number.

Hi @asuras, I have some HG2's on the way if you are still interested in a battery with HG2's. They will be about another 2 weeks till they arrive.

Hey so I was looking to get v more range out of my evolve CGT and I'm v looking for the biggest pack I can fit in without modding the desk itself from what I read, 10s4p fit resy but I'm woundering it's a 10s5p of 10s6p will fit

If someone could let me know that works be great

From what I've read, you can fit a 10s5p with some squeezing and rearranging, I think. I don't have a source for that but have read it somewhere

I have done a post on the Carbon GT battery upgrade.
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/evolve-carbon-gt-battery-upgrade/74126
The only bms that fits with a 10S5P battery is the new ones without an Aluminum heat plate on it, you will need the spacer for the rest.

30q batterys are only good for 15A so they are not acceptable for a 3 or 4p pack for the evolve GT board as they can pull up to 80A at full noise. as well you say you use 0.2mm nickel strap x3 plus 4mm2 tinned copper braid. what width is you nickel strip and your braid. by my calcs you are very under rated for the GT. as far as i can see no one sells 4mm2 copper braid less than 2mm thick.  i can tell you with those dimensions it will not fit. evolve made sure people people wouldnt be able to retro fit 18650 batterys to there CGT with out spending big dollars on copper welding techniques to keep the width down. also a tip, dont make the mistake that many have and choose to not insulate the outer edges of your pack sufficently so as to be able to fit your pack in a CGT. the Carbon fibre is conductive. you are basically installing the batteryinto a metal box with a thin layer of soft easily scrathed laquer on it. vibration = fire in a poorly insulated carbon board battery.

Don't know what happened to all the posts replying to maker's comments on battery building so I will reply again just to clarify a few things.
1. The 30Q is rated to 15A continuous and 3000mAh  it will do 20A continuous but will fall short of 3000mAh it will also heat up quicker. By the time the battery has reached anywhere near dangerous heat levels at 20A per cell it is fully drained.
2. I have tested my 0.2mm Nickel strips to 20A on my West Mountain Radio analyser and it only reached 38 degrees C far lower than the cell itself.
3. The copper braid is 1mm thick and 6.5mm wide, in theory that makes it 6.5x1mm = 6.5mm2. This is not quite correct in reality as the braid is less densely packed together compared to stranded wire so it is calculated by the square mm of each strand times the number of strands. I stated 4mm2 in the post of the build but made a mistake and I've been using 6mm2 all this time. It's the same thickness so I will continue using the 6mm
![Copper%20Braid|633x500](upload://lCNpgwm73eOYqf3f29E9x7afx5n.png) 
The Nickel is 10mm x 0.2mm and as you can see there is a couple of mm on either side. The copper is also soldered to the middle of the 4P bank of cells so that the Nickel has to cope with a max of 40A and even then it is only for a length of 9mm. As I stated before there is far more heat generation from the cell than the resistance of the Nickel.
4. An 18650 battery pack fits in a Carbon board quite easily as I have done numerous times. I used several layers of Kapton tape then reinforced fibre tape and finally shrink wrap. Well insulated!

Hi Frank,
the Carbon board upgrades are the most popular ones I do. The 15Ah battery has been an awesome upgrade for this board. If you have a new one on the way I would wait a while and see how you get on with the stock battery. When new it should still give you a great ride. The only thing that may be an issue is if your a big guy. If your 90+ Kg then the battery will sag quite quickly on hills See how you go. If you want to change then I can make you a battery in just a couple of weeks.

I own a bamboo GTX and a CGT both with very little ride time. As terrible as this sounds I can't wait for the performance to dwindle so I can justify the upgrade. I weigh 85kg, yesterday on a relatively small but steep hill my bamboo completely cut out (was repeatable), is this the voltage sag we are talking about? Will the 18650's remedy this? 
Great thing that your doing, keep up the good work, it's appreciated!

The most common reason for it to cut out is the voltage sag, where the voltage drops too low and the board shuts down. I have also seen where the temperature sensor is not in the right place and falsely shuts down the board for over temperature. The 18650 batteries using Samsung 30Q's or the LG HG2,s and Sony VTC6's these are all top range batteries that will maintain a higher voltage under high current loads. This prevents the low voltage shutdown that can occur with the Evolve boards.

Which cell do you recommend overall?

## \#79 Posted by: Marsen Posted at: 2019-03-10T09:45:28.388Z Reads: 84

```
It is a battery cell temp sensor so should be on one of the cells. I recommend the Samsung 30Q's. Not as good as the Sony VTC6 or HG2 when new but they have a better cycle life so even after 50 recharges they have the same or better capacity. They can cope with a 20A demand for short periods so can match the other two for that. If you want something to be able to pump out 20A for longer then go with the VTC6 but lets face it at 20A per cell load the thing will be flat in 7 mins so you just don't need it. Especially as they cost about 40% more. Esk8 needs a high capacity cell with good high current performance for short periods. I have used all three but prefer the 30Q because its such good value.

I run a battery booster for my evolve, a couple of us in melb do it.  With the low output 4-5amps charging on the fly you get a lot of energy from the boost pack,   I have a sagging cgt and can still get 40k’s on at’s with a booster.

Yep. Big sucker!
I built a 12KW battery pack for my house with it. I’m off grid and running on solar and batteries. The power company wanted $40k just to connect to the grid a few years ago when I built my house so decided to go solar instead.

Dude that's amazing. Did you simply hook up your pack to the inverter and off she went?

Pretty much, just a few things to change on the settings and away we went. The BMS caused a few issues so I disconnected it and went with a high power balancing circuit. All the protection is controlled by the inverter. I have been running it for about 3 years and SOH is still 99%

Hey Marsen,

Just wanted to ask whether you would be interested in building batteries for any other types of applications?

I'm in Perth myself. My partner and I have been working on a custom e-bikes build and were looking for someone who can do a battery pack for that built with 18650 cells.

Would you be interested in getting involved with that?

Hi Paul,
Yes I would be interested in looking at building e bike batteries for you. I have made batteries for e-bikes, ROV's, Drones, telemetry equipment, Vacuum cleaners, power tools and 100Ah deep cycle batteries. The last e-bike battery I built was a couple of weeks ago and was 72V 27Ah to fit in a F.U.T.R. Alpha bike.

Hi Jimmy,
I usually recommend the 12Ah battery. This uses Samsung 30Q cells which are good value and have a well proven track record with esk8. You can go for a 14Ah battry similar to the GTR battery but I have found that it doesn't have the power for large hills or heavier riders of over 80kg. You will need to fit a spacer or rout the board to get it to fit. I am making single piece spacers which are much better than the 3D printed ones way less fiddly to fit. I have made a video of how to install an 18650 battery, I am using solderless pushfit connectors so the process is much simpler to do.

Hi Marsen,

Just joined this group and found your post on battery upgrade. Had my bambo gt for about 6 months now and would really like to upgrade the battery to a 10S4P. Is this what you’ve managed to do ? Do you need to change any of the other components like the bms or motor board. I’m in the UK so unable to buy one of your batteries but would appreciate any advice or help you can give.
Thanks mate

Hi @Maverick, I believe there are a number of battery builders available to UK riders. I recommend the 30Q option which is a 12Ah battery. If you have watched the video then you can see what is entailed to install one of these batteries. They give you a much better range and output current with far less voltage drop than the standard battery so less sag on those hills. The original bms and controller are used and the bms is double stacked with the esc. A few riders don't like this, thinking that there is too much heat build up which will fry the electronics. I have been using a layer of barley paper and double side sticky foam which seems to provide sufficient heat insulation to prevent this. I have installed dozens of these and sold many more with lots of repeat customers and recommends so it must work :slight_smile:
**A word of warning**: this battery upgrade and the extra power that these batteries can provide. There is no extra current or higher voltage as the battery has the same voltage as the original and the current is controlled by the esc, however the old battery will sag and drop preventing you from riding for long periods in GT mode. The 18650 battery will be able to provide the power for much longer and there will be heat build up due to longer continuous running so there have been many reports of these batteries killing the motors or electronics. It is not the battery at fault it is the under rated electronics. ie the bms is rated to less than 24 amps continuous. Not a problem with the old battery but potentially an issue with a new high powered battery. 
So with great power comes great responsibility. If you want more range and more power you will need to upgrade more than the battery or ride conservatively
