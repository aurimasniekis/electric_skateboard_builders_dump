Sorry for messing up your thread, I didn't want to, I was already talking to Scrappy, about the Dark Matter motors, cause I think they look badass.

According to your pictures, those motors look very similar to Dark Matter, and I guess they are similar good quality. I really wanted to get some high quality motors, because I didn't want them to be the weak point of my build (I hope I get there soon).

Best wishes for selling those motors, and of course I think you two made a great job with the B-BOX, ESCAPE :slight_smile:

Would be cool to have more people like you, @stewii  @scepterr, @JTAG and @fedestanco around :slight_smile:

Sorry for being a bit off topic

Since the kv rating from the manufacturer is usually slightly off, you can test the kv in the VESC tool by typing kv into the terminal.

For the main power lines yes. Always wondered for the motor phase of they still need to be so big since there are 3 wires.

They still have very large amounts of current going through them.  Double 10AWG battery and triple 12AWG phase leads is pretty good.

The only complaint I have with the two I received is that the leads seems to be a bit short. I think they’re 100mm? 150mm sounds a bit better.

Firstly, what if folks aren't using FOCBOX?

And secondly, yes, it is actually better if half of the wire isn't too small.  Resistance is cumulative *and* the bigger wire can heatsink the smaller wire.

4mm?  Isn't 5.5mm standard

The only thing I've ever heard of folks doing with 3.5mm and 4mm connectors is cutting them off and soldering 5.5mm ones on [or 8mm ones if you're @GrecoMan ]

Connector Current Ratings
Now that you have an idea about how thick the wire needs to be based on the current flowing through it. You also need to make sure the connectors you are using will also be able to handle the current.

JST connector861 - up to 5A
2mm bullet connectors - up to 20 Amps
3.5mm bullet connectors - up to 40 Amps
XT60 connectors524 - up to 60 Amps
Deans / T-Plug272 - up to 60 Amps
EC3 connector364 - up to 60 Amps
4mm bullet connectors - up to 70 Amps
EC5 connectors785 - up to 120 Amps
6mm bullet connectors - up to 120 Amps
8mm bullet connectors - up to 200 Amps
