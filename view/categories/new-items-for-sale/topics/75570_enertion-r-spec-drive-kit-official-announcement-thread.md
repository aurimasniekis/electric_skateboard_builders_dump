**Unparalleled Performance & Hassle-free installation was our design objective!** 

This is the same Drive-train assembly Enertion is using for Raptor 2.1 builds, the Enertion R-SPEC DRIVE KIT comes fully assembled, as pictured below. The NEW motors have a 15mm steel axle & the motor/hanger assembly has integrated copper heat pipes to help extract heat directly from the core of the motor into the oversized aluminum hanger. The Hanger is 7075-T6 CNC billet aluminum with heat fins machined onto the majority of the surface to improve heat dissipation. These new cooling features result in 8% more torque during hill climbing. The motors also have built-in thermal sensors, when paired with a FOCBOX unity, you can create your own custom throttling profile to maximize performance without risk of damaging the motors when you are pushing maximum current.

I expect the drive kit to take a little bit of time not as long as the focbox last year because the price is higher so some people won‚Äôt want to spend that on the drive. The focbox was so cheap that everyone could get it.

Actually, have 1000 of these motors, we will wait until end of month/sale to see how many kits are sold, then do the assembly for that amount specifically. Shipping will be in first week of December.

We also have allocation of 100 Focbox Unity specifically for these bundles.

@onloop, Ben Glenn on FB is building a quad drive R2 for the Barrett Junction Uphill race. Would be cool to see that guy get some Enertion Factory backing for the big race.  He hauled ass at the Redmond race for P2 finish on a Raptor2. Wide open throttle for 4.6miles he said.

You know how we can buy the rspec drive kit together with the focbox unity and save 100? I was told that my order for that specific pair would be shipped January.

What I'm trying to clarify is, are people who are getting just the drive kit getting it earlier than the people who ordered the unity bundle because the unity would take longer to ship.

I was about to place an order for set of hubs and another unity in addition to the 2 that I ordered the other day.

You can get a couple of long screws or bolts with the same thread, then cut the head off and slice a small slit in it for use with a flat head screw driver. Then you can re-use them as alignment pins. Should cost less than a dollar.

I just use these two skinny torque's screwdrivers to align the out wheels. With some practice its relatively easy. Just make sure they're small enough to fit into the screw holes.

It's the type of cooling that is normally referred to as a heat pipe. It's the type of thing you have in smartphones, laptops, PCs. No other industry (that I know of) refers to this kind of cooling as liquid cooling. That name is normally reserved for a system where you have a pump that circulates a liquid (that stays a liquid) from the hot part to a radiator.

I just finished my maiden ride on the R-Spec Drive Kit Unity bundle. 
They are so much more powerful than the other Hub motors I tried! (generic Meepo style and Maytech)
Thanks @onloop for making them avaiable to people like me who already have all the other parts and bits needed to build a board! 
Just a few things I noted, the drag of the motors is stronger then from the other hubs I tried. I guess it's because the R-Spec motors are way bigger and have stronger magnets. They are also a bit louder especially when braking, but the brakes are strong and nicely gradual.
On my first run I didn't maxed out the top speed but on bench testing with Unity UI the motors maxed out at 38 km/h with a 10S5P 30Q battery @Deodand is that a inaccurate measurement or the max speed I have to expect with 90mm wheels? 
The push to start feature is really well implemented, I had a generic ESC with that feature and I hated it because every so little movement on the motors would wake the ESC and make a beep! Honestly I thought I will never going to use it but now I love it! 
Is the 125¬∞C max motor temperature the recommended setting or am I better off reducing this value? 
Once again thanks to @onloop and @Deodand the Unity is a big step in the direction to make diy esk8 building hassle free and accessible to everyone. Just a price point around the 150US$ mark would be a awsome future goal! 
Now I am waiting for the Metr. Pro module to work to be able to record and post more findings.
@CarlCollins thanks from a happy customer for your guidance through the purchase!

Hey, the speed estimate is definitely wrong :slight_smile: on the HUD page there's a little gear you can click in the right side of the page vertical center. When you click  that this screen will pop up: 

![Screenshot_20181222-171415|230x500](upload://jpvewRxCw7jJ981j0PzHH87V7La.jpeg) 

That button test erpm-rpm is what you are looking for. It will become clickable when the board  is connected to the app. Essentially have 10 pole pairs not 14 so once you run the calibration routine you should get a number of 10. You can also just input it manually if preferred.

I used all default values suggested by the Unity. The settings are depending on your other components too. What max. discharge is your battery capable off etc.
I have a 10S5P 30Q battery with a 70 amp BMS, so 30 battery discharge amps for each motor is fine.
The motor amps, I left them just at the default 60 / -60.
But during my first long run 20km, I ran into overheating problems after around 6-7km, with the settings how they are. Today i will open my board again and use the Focbox tool instead of the UI to see properly what I am doing.

No, it slows down considerably and in the HUD tab of the Focbox UI the temp. readings are over 100¬∞ C. But at this point everything can be error on my side. I used the UI for the first time , so my settings can be off. I will set my board with the Focbox tool now, because that is what I am used too and will see how it turns out.

I am running 10S, so can't tell you for 12S specifically. The motors are getting hot quickly, so not more then 60 motor amps per motor are recommended. The battery amps, I would not go more then 30, I think 20-25 amps per motor are preferred. 
Watch your motor temps closely, mine where at more then 100¬∞C after about 7km riding in cruising speed. 
I still have to find the sweet spot between heating and performance. I hope that enertion is publishing some recommendations for those motors. 
Let me know your findings I am a bit baffled by the heating of the motors.

It seems like the cooling solutions aren‚Äôt solving their heating problems? I talked to a rep over their chat and while the unity was tested it seems like the new urethane and motors weren‚Äôt thoroughly tested and so those receiving them are the ones doing the testing. When I asked roughly how long the urethane would last before needing to be swapped I was told they had no idea. The unity seems to have been more thoroughly tested and I‚Äôm not saying this to bash enertion, but I‚Äôm honestly curious why they can‚Äôt solve the Cooling problem with their Motors, by now it seems like it‚Äôs either bad design of the motor itself or ineffective cooling issues, perhaps making the motors themselves larger or switching out the thin wire for thicker wire may help idk? Maybe I‚Äôm misreading this whole thing but I really wanted to see these hubs succeed

My Unity drops bluetooth connection every few  second, but this could be also a problem with my phone. I tried to test it with my Laptop, but on the Windows UI bluetooth is still not working.
Enertion was certainly under time pressure with not too many human resources and first priority was to meet the promised schedule.

I've been running enertion hubs (4 or 5 sets of them, can't remember I've been through so many now) for a year and a couple months. Nothing but over heating issues, bearing issues, QC issues, ect... Seems like they've been rushing into things without any testing other than riding down the street a few times. I have a brand new set (silver motors) that only lasted about 30 miles before they started dying. 

I was really hoping this new truck and hub combo would work so that maybe I could finally get my R2 working (I ordered over two years ago) with them finally. But these reports so far look exactly like the same ones posted a year ago. Bummed that I'm already into this for $1500 and I've only gotten around 180 miles on my R2 in a year because of the motors always breaking down. Bummed...

**These new improved motors cannot overheat when paired with a Focbox Unity.** 

The motors have a built-in thermistor and the Unity is constantly monitoring the temperature. The Unity will dynamically adjust the current to the motors if the temperature raises past the preset safety limits.

For example, The magnets inside this motor are rated to 150c & the Focbox Unity will automatically start to throttle the current at 85c and full-cut at 140c. This means the motor cannot exceed the temperature rating.

The motors also have integrated cooling pipes to further improve the heat extraction and cooling.

The R-SPEC hub motors are one of the fastest, highest torque output motors currently available on the market, the reality with high performance direct drive hub motors is they will heat up. If you prefer less heat simply detune them by reducing max motor current.

It's the exact same reason we have temperature control systems and heat sinks built into the Focbox Unity. Because high performance electronics that have high current throughput will heat up.

The great news is that when you buy from Enertion you have a legit warranty that covers manufacturing faults. We have these motors in-stock and faulty units can be replaced quickly. If you need help simply contact our 24/7 chat and we will assist.

@tardyparty7 aren't you a young guy? I'm like 175 lbs and don't have much problems with heat in my 2.1 hubs. 

You can ask pretty much anyone at the Vegas event I was up at the front of the group rides for most of it zooming around. Anyway everyone has different riding styles but I find the hubs thermals to be pretty solid the way I use them.  I think maybe for heavier people or after big extended hills you'll see some power sag for awhile after. 

I will say I'd put money down right now that if you put thermistors in hummie hubs you'll see the same temps but there just isn't any throttling (since there's no thermistor). I know they will argue with me to the grave on it, but until I see some evidence to the contrary I'll stand by that claim ( roughly same winding resistance kv and amp limits numbers don't lie).  Right now with default temp settings the unity goes up to around 120C everything in the motors should be good to 140 but I like some safety margin.

My motors paired with the Unity started throttling after being 5-7 km into my ride, the Focbox UI  showed temperatures of 100 on one and 85¬∞C on the other motor. When I tried continuing the ride in R-Spec mode the motors suddenly loose power and only the slower mode is working. Even after a break for several minutes the board never gets back to it's initial performance. 
Please, I would be so happy that you show me my fault and I can use this motors as intended! 
I  don't want to bash neither argue, my comment towards @tardyparty7 was just to make him aware not to overheat his motors with the 4.12 Vesc since those don't have thermal throttling build in. 
But after seeing @onloop riding up steep hills with weights added and pulling cars you wouldn't think that those motors can't pull people who weigh more than 75kg for an extended period of time on flat ground.

I have the same bluetooth drop-outs on the Unity. I think it happens when braking, would need more testing to be sure.

On another notice. Doing motor detection from the android app is not recommended. As only 1 motor will be set to Hall sensor. The other one will be set to sensorless. Atleast, that happened to me today.

The same happens when doing the wizard on the more advanced Focbox tool. But you will be able to adjust it correctly on the FOC tab. Deodand already mentioned it will be fixed in the next update.

Regen. brakes -15

But why is the Hall sensor dead now?
Shall I check each motor individually?

Can you @EnertionSupport please release a guide to setup the  drivekit 2.1... motor max amp, motor brake , i think it will help lot of people here ...

Same problem with mine, this is in 5 degree celcius weather. After one kilometer of riding temperatures reach 85c. 

When I pin the throttle while on the board for a few seconds temperatures can spike 20+ degrees celcius. Hence I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs the urethane insulating the heat since there‚Äôs not enough time for the heat to travel to the can. 

This was the case with the previous silver motor, and the new ones now. 

I suspect it is a settings issue because of two reasons.

1. As per the pictures of the internals ive sent above, motor seems really well made. Shittier made motors would heat up less than this.  

2. I‚Äôm not too sure about this cause I‚Äôm not a motor expert but I try to read up as much as I can 
This motor isn‚Äôt typical to most motors vescs run ( 20 poles vs 14/28, super duper thick magnets( might have an effect on the characteristic of the motor?), and almost zero magnetic field leakage(even a m3 grub screw couldn‚Äôt stay on the can) hence might need different settings to run optimally

How would it be software now? I've had the same overheating issues (not to mention other issues) with all Enertion hubs for over a year now. It's not software. I'm sure they will eventually decide that real world testing will provide better results.

I would change the value of Beta value of Motor Thermistor. 
Heat up those motors with riding, take an actual temperature reading with an infrared temperature reader then adjist that beta value so the app readings match the same temperature.

No I didn't try jet. The answer I got is that Enertion has to do more testing  themselves to find the sweet spot between performance and heat.

My hands are quite accurate in reading temperatures, if I can't touch it's too hot!
But seriously, the heat which gets dispersed from the truck is insane. Those temp readings are for real and not a bad beta value.
The screenshot from @12meterkuk looks like vesc firmware 3.38, so he is not using the Unity with the same temp. results.

I thought mine were too until I got an infrared temperature reader. 

60 degrees is hot. 90 degrees is hot too. Both will feel like they‚Äôre too hot to touch. 

I‚Äôd at least try this to rule it out. Your other option is a motor that can‚Äôt be used very well or that enertion will just send you new ones with the same problem apparently.

Yes, I am somehow fearing that everything boils down to rider weight. 75kg and under are fine and everyone above that will have to deal with thermal throttling. 
Sadly I don't own a infrared camera nor do I have access to one, but I totally agree with you, it would be interesting to see the actual temps.

I have a temp gun. Although can and truck temp is different from stator temp so not sure how I‚Äôm gonna check it. 

I am confident the readings are accurate as they match room temp when not in use. Unless the readings don‚Äôt rise linearly.

put the motors in the oven, set to 60, 80, then everything will be the same temperature. Measure air temp->motor temp.

They aren't linear, best is to do as @AlexBE said, oven or a hairdryer aimed at the motor/truck for a long time for the temperature to stabilize, them you compare the reading with an external thermometer

Even better, measure each motor beta value, measure the temperature and resistance for  two different temperatures and use this calculator

That is a very useful calculator! However..... @Deodand , I calculate a motor beta of 5046, the android app only allows me to set a max of 4380. edit: for anyone interested, this is a SK8 6354 140kV.

Add it to the list!! Would also love

* auto connect
* auto read of parameters, ie going to the config page should display the parameters on the connected unity, not placeholders

Unity Firmware:
* Turn off BTLE or disconnect before turning off main FET switch. To avoid low voltage display in phone app. When I turn off the board, I like to see what voltage it was at when I switched it off. The current functionality causes the BTLE connection to still be up, and the battery voltage to decrease to ~10V before the connection is lost.

@onloop @Deodand what's the erpm to rpm factor in these hubs. are they 28 or 24 poles (so 12 or 14 pole paires)??

Normal Vesc Sensor wire adapters like this would work. 

https:///collections/electrical-connectors/products/vesc-sensor-wires
They are available from many different vendors.
 
The female part is JST-ZH 6 Pin 1.5mm pitch.
