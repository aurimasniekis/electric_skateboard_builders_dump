I think so, or inflatables.

I'm still using 90mm wheels and 9mm belts!!

Guess I'm just a Dinosaur.

I'm really enjoying smaller wheels over big these days I was going to post a wanted on 90mm or 83mm abecs. I'm guessing postage to UK is going to kill the value? Can u check

Well the feel is atleast so much better. I upgraded from 90mm hubs to 200mm pneumatics.

But what's interesting is, that my feet hurt quicker on pneumatics compared to hubs.
