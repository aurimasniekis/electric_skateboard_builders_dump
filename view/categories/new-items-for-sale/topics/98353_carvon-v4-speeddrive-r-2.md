They are new, never installed or powered up. I had hopes of building a 4wd board but life got in the way

$700 + shipping per or $1,350 + shipping for both

Carvon drives were already pricey, and now there's zero chance of support in the event that something goes wrong (not there ever was any in the first place, but now people know that).

You're probably going to have to lower the price by quite a bit before someone bites.

Why no interest??  Are you by any chance selling both?  or only 1 set?

It really is gonna be a tough sell. If something happens to them, noone to fix em.  Especially with Torqueboards having a better product with support for the same price.  


I feel your pain.  I dropped $700 to Carvon and don't have shit.
