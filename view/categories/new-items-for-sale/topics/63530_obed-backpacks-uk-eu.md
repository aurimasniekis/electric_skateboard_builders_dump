Slick Revolution have these in stock, just a heads up because they tend to run out fast and vanish for months on end from everywhere.

I own the Giver. My deck is pretty wide so I had to make some strap extenders to be able to strap it into the backpack. It works fairly well for carrying your esk8. You can tell it is handmade in a small shop setting and the quality is really good.

When that first went up I'm certain they were in stock. They might have sold out in that 24hrs. Perhaps a small stock to test the waters?
