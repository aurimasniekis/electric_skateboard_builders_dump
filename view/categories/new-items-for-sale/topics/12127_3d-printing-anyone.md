So i have a 3D Printer and i have never really used it much. Recently bought some new Pla and abs filament. If anyone wants something 3D printed (an enclosure or motor mount etc) i can print it at a very cheap price along with great qual! I can ship internationally and shipping all around europe is â‚¬6!

Do you have any pictures of your work? I think it would be beneficial to any one interested.

I'd suggest a picture of a complicated part like the blade runner pistol to prove precision and a series of functional parts like the top 10 electric longboard/stresstest parts in thingiverse.
