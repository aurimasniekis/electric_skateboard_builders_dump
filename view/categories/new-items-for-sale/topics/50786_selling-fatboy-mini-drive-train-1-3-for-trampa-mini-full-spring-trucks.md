Finally FatBoy Mini Gear Drive v2  for Trampa Mini/Full Spring Trucks is now available.

The gear drive now allows to use lubrication, by minimizing available volume inside the enclosure, adding oil filling port, V-ring and stainless steel plates for preventing dust/oil getting in/out of the case for motor mounting/wheel gear/hanger mounting adapter.

Also new tooth profile, for more silent operation and better efficiency.

I guess I need to find a small box on payday Friday to wrap up my hanger, this is great.

Ps. Hopefully th e 8mm motor spur can fit on a 6374 motor that has a 10mm collar per the other drives(not sure which thread it was I saw it on). I have two 'dark matter' motors left just for this

This is only for motors with width of 63mm. You would need to send in your mini hanger to machine it.
