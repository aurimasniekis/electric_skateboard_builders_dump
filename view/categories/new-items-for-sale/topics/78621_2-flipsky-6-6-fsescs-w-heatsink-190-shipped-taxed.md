I don't work for flipsky, but this has to be a pretty good deal. They're in theory offering buy one get on free on any 6.6 FSESC, meaning you can get the heatsink one for $155, ship it for another 20 and tax for another 20 for a super cheap dual 6.6 setup.

I just saw this on Facebook before. It’s so bloody tempting. The problem is I’ve seen lots of people having problems with the 6.6s. Mostly over current on acceleration or braking

Yeah I’ve heard of that one too. Apparently some issues can be fixed by running the no hw limits version, even flipsky recommend it

Its 15.00 for the US but do you just put one in your cart or do you do 2 cause it doesn't say nor is there a code for it.
