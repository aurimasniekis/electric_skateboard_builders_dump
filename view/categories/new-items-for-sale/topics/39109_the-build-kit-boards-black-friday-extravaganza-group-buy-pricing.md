I love them! Especially paired with an Apple Watch or android watch. Looking down at your wrist to see battery voltage and range is awesome! You can also change modes on the fly to Pro with lots of torque and top speed or ECO for max range but less torque and speed. And now there are apps for both IOS and Android.

12mm is probably enough for most, especially if you have an idler. But Im quite heavy and ride like I stole it. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: I also think 15mm helps the motor pulley last a bit longer.

Not a big deal but when you advertise something as 18, it should not be 18.99. Feels like a cheap tactic to scam people...

Not a deal breaker but yeah.... you know what I mean...

I do not believe you can legally collect sales taxes for your state fin the sale is to someone not in PA if you do not have a physical presence in the state. I know my company charges sales tax for people who order items and are from NJ NY and WI because we have a physical presence in those states.

I've cancelled my order. 
You need to pay your taxes. Your customers should not. 

I bought a domestic product, why am I paying import taxes on it?

As far as income tax, we all pay it. You pay 3%? I pay ~32%. It's a tax based on how much money you make, not on the product price...

They are 83mm to the back of the shaft 'bump'. Im not doging, just swamped atm. If you have questions ping me on the live chat, I have that up and ready to respond. 

@briman05 @PXSS It's my first year doing this. Im the first to admit I dont know everything, especially when it comes to taxes. Please dont use my lack of knowledge against me. If you want to PM and discuss taxes further, I would love to learn! 

On the point that I pay the taxes; while i do make profit on the parts, its not as much as others. The tax would add up quick at the end of the year. So i just have it set at 5.9%..

You plug the connector into your VESC (i have a picture if it on the website) and then you change one setting on the VESC and download the Android or IOS app. Pair it to your phone (very easy) and then you have real time data of your phone or compatible watch

You can't assess random taxes to people. If you feel that you need 5.9% more on every item to be successful, raise your prices by that much. You'll need to charge sales tax to PA residents if PA has sales tax

I was really, really hoping you would match torqueboards pricing on the 6374 motor.  They are selling for $100. You have raised your price from $120 to $140.

In fact this whole Black Friday event you have has been a `reverse` Black Friday if anything.  That $10 off coupon said `$10 off your first $130 order` then right at 5pm EST which I have been eagerly awaiting all day... the offer changed to `$10 off your first $180 order`

It's OK I am all about supporting the DIY vendors and the little guy but again totally unexpected and a little disappointed after such a long wait.

And really I don't know why as a GA resident I have to pay PA sales tax... that doesn't seem legal.

Again I will let it slide... I am a nice person. Just please ship to me Jet Spud 29" board at the end of November as promised.

Thank you

- Loyal Customer

[/quote]

These are much, much higher quality.. They are a new motor and were more expensive, thus the price increase. 

I'm also not sure why everyone is hating on the tax now. I mean I have been selling for almost 5 months and only had a handful of people ask me, now it seems to have blown up. I may just take eboostin's advice and eliminate the tax.

I will ship out the Spud's asap..

Yes I figured the motors were nicer and did think they did look a bit different than the last 6374 motors you had up on there. I mean I do like the look of them more than the TB's.

Well it's fundamentally like the whole big ecommerce game is like... I avoid the stores for the hassle... and I pay shipping for online... but avoid the tax if I am out of state.  Even the only reason I buy from EU because I don't have to pay the 20% VAT tax.

Again sorry I don't mean to sound like a D-bag... I know you work hard (and I want the vendors on here to do well)... good luck with the sale.

Thanks for answering ~ !

Thanks for the reply and your feedback!

If you got your order in today, it most likely shipped! (will drop off at the post office tomorrow). The VESC Bluetooth modules were a big hit, if you want one I wouldnt wait. I also have a good amount of motor mounts left! (I ordered A LOT of stock).

Yeah I'm pretty sure it's illegal to charge fake/inappropriate taxes.

As PXSS said, your taxes are yours to pay, not for your customers to pay. You should raise prices to cover your expenses.

The only legit tax here should be sales tax, and only for residents of the state(s) your business has presence in, and you have to send that money to the state.

It's up to your out-of-state customers to pay their own local taxes.

I feel stupid for not having noticed on my several purchases lol.

Sorry, not really trying to be negative, but you could get in trouble for this.

I just want to provide quality eSk8 parts :pensive:

This was my first purchase from you since you started the new website otherwise I would have told you earlier!

The old website didn't charge taxes out of state iirc. I always paid what you asked plus shipping. 

Needless to say, I was a little harsh and have kept my purchase since you had already printed a label for it and I didn't want to be a douchebag and have you do all that work to then cancel...

I hope you get your stuff sorted out soon. It's always been a pleasure dealing with you previously
