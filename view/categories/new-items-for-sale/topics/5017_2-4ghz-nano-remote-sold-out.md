Hello

Looking for smaller and more comfortable remote i found a nice option to the already good remotes available on the market.

This is a  hobbytech mini remote and here are some of the features of this remote :

2.4Ghz Frequency 
2 Channels ( nice to pair with receiver controlled on/off switch for lights or horn)
it comes with a 3.7V 500mAh battery and USB charging port
Wrist Strap
receiver


Impressions:

i've been testing it for 3 days now and have like 80 miles on it.
so far it have been reliable no issues at all. even in wifi and cell phone tower crowded area ( midtown NYC) and a lot of other electromagnetic interference.

about the finish and feel. the construction feel sturdy and the finish is  aesthetically decent, the best part is that it fit nice in the hand and the pocket, it will take a little getting use to it because is a thumb wheel remote.

it comes with surprisingly good instruction a binding cable and a receiver.

Sale Price $55.00 Free shipping in the continental USA.
Limited Availability.
if interested PM please  
here are some pictures

The throttle is sensitive like any other remote. The difference is the use of the thumb to operate it. 

It has a throttle trimmer and besides you can change some of the settings on your ESC ( timing - brake force - punch ) to make it work just like you wish. 

Something to have in mind is that it will take some ajustment from the user because it's a different way to operate it, to hold it. In short a different way to do the same, it may be more confortable for some and not for others.

```
The only downside of this controller is that suffers from interferences from speed cameras, I guess it's on the same band of speed cameras RFs they are using here in London, UK. Even when fully charged, I pass near speed cameras and the signal hiccups a bit, 1 second ok, 1 second not, the only thing that helps is really getting the controller near to the board when It's losing signal, also now I know where it happens so I prevent that, I guess it's because the antenna is not extended like in the other RF receivers, they thought it was overkill but they didn't think about interferences... but overall it's very compact and it doesn't looks like a gun! Recommended.

I'm sorry but I don't know what is a  steez button ? ? Plz let me know what is it :slight_smile:

You can use that button for a receiver controlled switch. 
One like this

```
@Kaly If I'm not mistaken, steez is the term thrown around here referring to a remote's ability to maintain a throttle setting, by holding down a button like on the Nyko Kama Wii remote. It's like cruise control, but maintains throttle position instead of speed, and disengages when the button is released. That pinky button looks like it would be perfect for that, if someone knew how to add that functionality.

@Kaly interested to see how these mini remotes work out and if we can use the extra buttons. I also ordered a few from hobby tech awhile back but yet to get delivered. Coming with a few Maytech Steez and mini 2.4 receivers like torqueboardDIY and psychotiller seek, but from China.  Still searching for a good small format remote that works in NYC reliably without dropouts or interference.

You would need to add an extra circuit to the remote that just resends the throttle value if the button is pressed, but thats lame & impractical.

If the vesc had an input for a second PWM input-signal that would enable cruise control if pressed, you could just plug the second channel in and you'd be done.
But sadly, AFAIK this feature isn't added to the VESC yet.

@philipp
I have a friend in Chicago who will bring mine (that I still have to pay and tell @Kaly about :blush:) to Germany in July.
If you don't mind the wait he could bring both and I'll send it from here - probably a lot cheaper than directly from the US.
Think about it.

Edit: Although you would have to pay for shipping basically twice - well I guess it depends on how much direct shipping from the US actually is.

yeah but he would have to pay the shipping inside Europe which could be kind of similar than the added charge for your international shipping (depending on the weight and size etc.). That plus the added time and the "hassle" of giving me money without knowing me personally and so on might not be worth saving 5$ in the end. If international shipping from the US would be 50$ then it could be worth it I guess, but if it is only a 10$ surcharge then probably not.

Damn, 2 days from New York to California! Didn't think that was even possible with standard USPS shipping, but here it is. First thoughts, it's definitely "winning" in the size and lack of droppability departments. I also kind of like that the receiver doesn't have an antennae flopping around. It is tiny, but it feels very comfortable. It's my first thumb controller, so I'll have to test it out later and see if it makes my thumb go "up".

And the always fun controller comparison photo.

And sadly, the pinky button is actually for binding, so the steez button dream is dead. Lol. Not a big deal at all. It was only a thought anyway. The 2nd channel is actually a on/off switch on the back of the remote. Perfect for switching lights on/off or something.

Sure thing, I'll install it this week and give my feedback. But as far as how it feels in my hand, it's pretty awesome. Granted, I'm not a big guy 125 lbs but it's the right size for stealth in the city. It's almost like they took the best feature of the EGO and Boosted remote and put it into a no frills casing. I like the short throw, thumb throttle via a knob which is a much better design than Boosted's long throw thumb dial in my opinion.

Most of these generic remotes use a 1S battery in about 500-800mah. It's fairly easy to find a small pack like that to solder on.

Today i encountered 2 issues with the remote 

First the remote comes already bind to the receiver, but in some instances the binding process need to be repeated, this is because of the fail safe feature of the receiver that needs to be calibrated. This manifest itself in this situation:

With the board On, if you turn Off the remote, the motors will start spinning without input. This is because the receiver needs to record the NEUTRAL position (mid throttle ) of the remote.

**The Binding procedure is as follow:**
  
1).Check and make sure all the wires are connected and that the REMOTE is OFF,insert the bind plug into CH3(Bind) on the RECEIVER. 

2).With the REMOTE OFF. Switch on the ESC, to power up the RECEIVER, red LED light will flash. 

3).PRESS and HOLD the bind button on the REMOTE and then turn the REMOTE ON.

4).You should notice the REMOTE and RECEIVER LED light go from flashing red to solid red.

5).Once you see a solid red light, the binding process is complete, Then without turning the REMOTE OFF or touching the THROTTLE pull the bind plug out **(for the receiver to record the throttle mid point, neutral, to engage the fail safe)** 

6).Then you can test it again by turning OFF the REMOTE and the RECEIVER LED should flash. By turning the REMOTE ON the RECEIVER LED should go back to solid red. 
  
Before RIDING ,it's better to test the fail safe function in the RECEIVER ,if the motor didn't move,so the fail safe function is in good working condition, if the motor is moving,you have to repeat the step  No.1- No.6 above

THE OTHER ISSUE IS REGARDING THE ON/OFF SECOND CHANNEL FUNCTION
this one was pointed to me by @omaryunus because until then i had not try it yet on my other board with this capability. The issue is that **the receiver controlled on/off switch are not working with this function.**

I examined the receiver by testing the voltage on all the PINS, and everything was in working order. Then proceeded to test the Signal from the second channel of the receiver. By connecting the receiver second channel to the VESC signal input PIN and connecting everything to the BLDC tool in the PC.  Once there went to the App Configuration TAB sub TAB PPM, then check the box for the display pulsewidth (ms) here:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/60cd6a48ac8656ec39b873532c03891f90623b7d.png" width="690" height="463">

Turned the switch ON/OFF multiple times and the VESC register input from the receiver, the VESC seems to be registering 55% of the pulse but it was registering it even after the switch was off so don't know what is that about. 
Most of the receiver controlled switch will complete a circuit when the radio channel passes 50% so far i don't know why this behavior but i emailed the manufacturer and will report later.

Hey Kaly, I noticed the same thing but I was able to calibrate it using the trim control with a tiny screwdriver. These settings worked for me to match neutral on transmitter off. I LOVE this little controller.

Minimum Pulsewidth (ms) 1.12

Normal receiver installation just use a ferrite ring

@Kaly  Quick question, how/where is ferrite ring/toroid installed?  I assume this is on deck (my remote is tx only), but my esc and receiver are tightly configured with less than an inch of ribbon wire between.  Is that where it goes, or antenna?  This is way outside my wheelhouse!  Do you have a picture of an install so I can make room and copy?  Thanks!

## \#92 Posted by: Kaly Posted at: 2016-07-05T23:51:39.292Z Reads: 358

You need to wrap the ESC-receiver wire around the ring. That will clean the signal and prevent any drop from the remote. 

This is a good examples <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/5e90811bdba536240c004e38d7a4cb25ed0dc3af.jpeg" width="355" height="327"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c92cf26861ae6ae54a378efba4e4f82f7363dd4d.jpeg" width="274" height="184">

Hmmm, so to be clear if the wiring connecting my ESC to receiver is only 1" long (because the transmitter is basically sitting on the flip side of ESC pcb with a heatsink ontop) in constrained space, then I am SOL?  Would adding length to that wiring just to wrap around ferrite improve or worsen the situation, because you are increasing wiring where there was very little wiring potentially being interfered with?

IMO you can add Leight to the wire by just enough to wrap it around the ferrite and will improve the situation by eliminating the noise in the signal.

Hello 
Everyone I just received 30 more pcs of this remote. The price increase $5 dollars in order to cover a little bit. 

Still free priority mail 2/3 days via USPS within the USA. 

For our the international brothers will be $45 + the shipping charges,  the USPS have a international service that cost $13.25 to most contries, it just do not have tracking. 
(the lesser price is to offset a little of the shipping cost )

If interested PM me to receive paypal addres. Will appreciate if the @name is included in the paypal comments. 

Thank you very much to everyone that have buy a remote from me. 

Have a good weekend. ;-)

I'll have to get a black leather jacket to go with it. Maybe put my echo dot on the board so that it can talk to me. This is gonna be the nerdiest esk8 build in history. 

The winning controller board and battery will slide in to the powerglove keypad housing with room to spare. I might sub a bigger battery even. Definitely want to get a small OLED screen and use UART output from the VESC for voltage/speed info. LEDs and EL wire are probably in order to make that glove light up like a Christmas tree.  Still brainstorming about how I can use those buttons. I'll take pictures and post a build log when I get further into it.

The VESC can be programmed to output telemetry data to the UART port, but it's not gonna get back to the controller with existing hardware. The Gt2b is only sending information in 1 direction; from the transmitter in your hand to the receiver attached to the VESC. 

This beautiful workaround from @NerijusM sends speed and voltage data back to the controller with a couple arduinos communicating via bluetooth:

Yeah I'm not sure if the flex sensor will be able to handle any abuse. As with most cheap electronics, I bought a couple  so that I can experiment without fear of being stranded if one goes out. That includes the controller itself; great deal from @Kaly.

Just a general remark: 
Please do the binding process exactly as described above! Else the fail safe function sometimes won't perform like needed. Just test it by switching off the remote while giving throttle and see if the motor goes into neutral. If yes, everything is ok. 

But it happens frequently that the remote either goes on full speed or full brake when loosing reception or being switched of during use. And that's not funny!

the issue with the failsafe feature until now looks like it is with the factory binding or interference while in storage either way, once you receive the remote, Do the binding process to ensure it is correctly set up. 
So far once  repeated the binding process, it have work flawlessly.

I installed the remote today and have to say that compared to the mad munkey I don't like it at all.
Binding was painless but right from the start something was weird:
My Car ESC usually only starts its beeping initialization after you turn on the GT2B - with this remote however the beeping starts even when the remote is off :hushed:
Next thing is that even though the travel is so short I have to turn it quite far to get the motor to spin - this leads to the rest of the acceleration being controlled with only a very small throttle range left --> it is way too sensitive. 

With a VESC this might not be an issue because of the acceleration curve - but for a Car ESC it is really dangerous. On my first go the board almost threw me off due to the sudden and way too high acceleration.

If anybody has an idea how to fix this please let me know. I like the size and ergonomics but right now it is unusable for me :frowning:

I have a car esc and I had the same experience, so I returned it. I would suggest buying a better quality joystick from digikey or mouser and replacing the stock one. You will get a smoother response curve. Make sure to measure the resistance of the pot and get the joystick with similar values.

For car ESC. Need to play with the settings, you can do the following : 

- reduce the neutral range of your ESC to 5% or less. This I'll shorten the throttle thump displacement. 

-Reduce timing to low. 

-Set Acceleration to low or medium. 

- if available on you ESC settings reduce the motor punch.

On the remote side, set the trimming to your preference. 

One more thing, this is a thumb operated device different that the gun like remote  that we use before. 

Please just do not jump on the board without first getting a feel for the throttle, you can do this by putting the board upside down and pressing the remote to gauge how hard or soft you'll have to operate this device. 

That way you can improve your riding experience with a new device that is use in a different way compare to the one we are Confortable using so far.

Agree with @kaly. I'm running on a Torqueboards 6s car esc, with 3% throttle neutral range, and medium to high timing & acceleration, and it works great. The throw of the thumb stick is short, but completely usable throughout the range for me. I did have to turn the throttle trim all the way to the left though so the motor doesn't run when the stick is in the neutral position. Don't know if that part is how it should be or not, but that's a different thing.

I had the same issue with mine. I found that the bottom of the thumbwheel was getting caught since it was riding to close to the potentiometer's metal case. I cut a really small piece of plastic off a credit card and stuck it in there. It raised it about a half mm. Just enough to nicely clear the case. Cruise control eliminated!!

I have been having an issue with the remote cutting out. Gotta fiddle with it a bit.

Did anyone find a way to make the throttle curve less twitchy? The very first half of the control slider (like 5mm) control everything with my setup (up & down, both directions) and this caused throttle boosts several times already, almost throwing me off... very nervous riding this way. I used the trim screw and max/min-pulse to try and tweak it out but this is as smooth as i could get it. Maybe i should lower my motor amps so they don't punch as much?

Unfortunately I did not. Changed back to the GT2B yesterday after trying out the recommended settings for my car esc.
Motor timing and neutral range reduction did not result in any significant improvement and I found it to be highly dangerous to use this remote for my current setup. The throttle is so unpredictable and sensitive compared to a GT2B that when I push off of a standstill and want to accelerate I have to move my thumb so carefully that it takes a really long time to get to the point where the acceleration actually starts. At this point I have already lost a good amount of speed or might be standing in the middle of the crossroads - I mean it can work but compared to the mad munkey it is just not as good to use. This might be different with a VESC where you can set the acceleration curve in detail. For anyone with a CAR ESC however: stay away from this and get a GT2B!

@stuxtruth @Maxid i'm using a VESC and i've been playing with the min/max-pulse in the PPM settings, but it takes some work adjusting the settings, going out to test it underload, come back and repeat the whole thing.
I guess i'll still have to find the sweetspot because other people seem to have fixed it by making the min/max-pulsewidth wider than the reach of the remote. If i cant find the sweetspot, i guess i'll just order a madmunkey case for my GT2b :)

@Justin Have you found a solution yet?

In the first few days of esk8ing i didn´t get those throttle boosts because i didn´t ride that fast and my throttle didn´t leave the first half of the lever travel.

But now, feeling more safe and comfortable even at higher speeds till 40 km/h, i frequently notice the abrupt throttle bursts that are unpredictable and very dangerous. I didn´t crash yet but i assume that´s just a matter of time. They even occur when i move the throttle as careful as possible. :confused:

For those using the VESC that are having some issues this can help, please follow it in stated order. 


Before connecting it to you board give it a full charge. 

- 1.  Connect to VESC and configure receiver in BLDC tool. 

- 2.  Once receiver is configure, take a small screw driver and trim the throttle on the remote to your preference.  

- repeat the binding procedure to ensure proper neutral position. 

- 3.  Them One more time connect the VESC to the computer and configure the receiver limits again in the BLDC tool. 

It seem that the min/max pulse width changes a little bit (in the remote) with the trimming of the throttle.

## \#176 Posted by: Jinra Posted at: 2016-08-08T15:28:27.582Z Reads: 233

I noticed min never changes but increasing it increased the neutral and max. I have mine set to 2.16 max 1.11 min. This way neutral is the perfect median between the two values.

Make sure you re bind the remote after adjusting the throttle to reset the neutral position for the receiver. If you don't, turning off the remote will result in acceleration or braking.

But isn´t turning the trim screw just "moving the pulsewith"? Does it change the behavior of the acceleration / breaking when the limits in the BLDC tool are set to fit to the trim setup?

## \#178 Posted by: Kaly Posted at: 2016-08-08T16:52:38.006Z Reads: 225

The behavior seems to be cause by the way the VESC interpret the signal and that This remote changes the signal once trimmed. 
So the VESC interpret that as a different remote, that is not properly configured.

Yeah, the receiver light goes solid.  I've tried turning the board and the remote off and on again to verify it still is bound.  I've tried rebinding multiple times, and each time it looks like I'm successfully binding.  I even got a second Winning remote to try again, but got the same outcome -- a 0-value pulsewidth in BLDC with no reaction to the throttle.  Since it happened to me twice with two different remotes, it feels like user error... or just really bad luck. :)

we have the same problem.  looking over these instructions now I dont think there's anything new 

"
That's a very common problem with the winning remote: the default "fail safe" is sometimes set to full brake in case of loosing connection and that's not good! Did you test the fail safe function yet?

Here are some steps I collected a while ago:

Please test the fail-safe functionality (like moving the transmitter as far away from the board and checking if the motor shuts down if out of reach). If the motors doesn’t shut down or applies brakes, please perform the following steps for binding and calibrating:

Check and make sure all the wires are connected and that the REMOTE is OFF. Insert the bind plug into CH3(Bind) on the RECEIVER.

With the REMOTE OFF: switch on the ESC to power up the RECEIVER, the red LED light will flash.

PRESS and HOLD the bind button on the REMOTE and then turn the REMOTE ON.

You should notice the REMOTE and RECEIVER LED light go from flashing red to solid red.

Once you see a solid red light, the binding process is complete. Then without turning the REMOTE OFF or touching the THROTTLE pull the bind plug out (for the receiver to record the throttle mid point, neutral, to engage the fail safe)

Then you can test it again by turning OFF the REMOTE and the RECEIVER LED should flash. By turning the REMOTE ON the RECEIVER LED should go back to solid red.

Before riding, it's better to test the fail safe functionality again. Leave the board powered on and switch the REMOTE off: if the motor isn’t moving, the fail safe function is working, if the motor is moving fast or abruptly braking while throttle is applied: you have to repeat step No.1- No.6

So it appears that channel 2 isn't working with the switch on the controller...
I've hooked it up to LED strip and turned the switch on and off from the controller but the LED strip remain on.
Anyone got a fix on this?

My "winning" recieved stopped working after having worked correctly before. To be fair, I think I blew it by putting a battery backwards. I changed to a hobbyking 3ch reciever and that one worked perfectly.

Pairing is the same as the winning remote. Just connect the esc to ch 3 on the reciever.

Soldered an antenna extension onto the pcb antenna on both the remote and receiver (no pics on receiver). Hopefully this will stop the stuck throttle/no response issue I've been having.

I've been trying to remedy this issue since i got it and my latest attempt (above) still doesn't solve it. I'm to scared to ride full speed due to how unreliable the controller is. I'm not sure if it's the remote or the receiver, but my money is on the remote.  

You said you're using the gt2b recovery right? If you're still having these issues, then it just be the remote. I have the exact same problem. The remote will get "stuck"when throttling, or not respond to braking then suddenly kick in and almost send me flying forwards. For the next few seconds the remote will be sporadic. No idea why this is.

I might have to pick up a new remote

i don't think so, definitely no electrolytic caps. does the gt2b have them?

How did you all manage the fact that accelerating and especially braking with this remote requires a veeeery sensitive thumb?

Since i´ve only been skating in industrial areas or bike lanes so far, i really can´t imagine to use this remote on roads with high traffic because while using this remote in these stop and go situations the only thing in my head would probably be the fear of crashing because of a short twitch with my thumb.

Does the VESC have some kind of "soft start" features?

You need to get a switch that can operate the lights.
