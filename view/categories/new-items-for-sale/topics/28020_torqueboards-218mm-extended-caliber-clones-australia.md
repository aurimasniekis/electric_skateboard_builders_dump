I'm looking to grab some of the extended caliber clones from TorqueBoards:
diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-218mm-trucks/

However shipping is a bit of a killer at 40USD flat. Is anyone else in australia interested in ordering together and then splitting once it gets to aus (only about $10 postage AUD then).

Edit: Have enough people, but more are welcome to order as well!
Please fill out the form so i can figure out postage for you once they arrive in australia.

I ordered to Hong Kong and shipping was $50 and is closer than Australia! But yeah it does suck for us outside the US. Surely there is a few people that want these in aus, I think you will get some interest. I think torque should set up a Europe warehouse and an international warehouse in Hong Kong, we have real low shipping rates here.

Yep, it sucks. Most of the eskate stores are in UK/USA/EU. Enterion was here but no DIY anymore.

We have a rough total of 4 trucks so far, 2 more and free shipping to aus meaning they will only be $50 USD + $9-12 AUD australian shipping (or free if you want to grab them from me in sydney CBD).

There is so much room!! I am running a set of @psychotiller pneumatics along with 10mm spacers and have pleennntttyyyy of room. I am running 12mm gear on dual 6374 and 15mm may be possible. It will definitely work with dual 6354!

you guys will love these things!  If it weren't for the slightly larger hangers it's stupid simple to fit.  With the odd size hangers you can either grind/file the mount clamp, or the hanger - i filed my clamps.  

Kudos again to @torqueboards for making these available!  cannot wait to rock dual 6374 + 107mm e-flywheels and 12mm belts!!!

@longhairedboy @flywithgriff Should have 15mm pulleys in a few days. Also have a reverse motor mount if you want to ride a drop-through or similar.

@sl33py lol yeah, wish they were exact.

AU Shipping :( = Expensive lol.

The clamps I got specifically for the 218's fit perfectly. I should have reverse mounts delivered in a few days.

Will send out invoices tomorrow.

@Bataleon - They should be fine. I don't think you'd need to file them as they should have a bit of play available since they're a two clamp setup @overint

Just an update on the postage situation, sendle managed to miss pickup 2 days in a row (was from my work, they never came), so they said they will pick them up on monday guaranteed.
Auspost packages went out on friday.

Is there anyone interested in ordering these bad boys to Europe? If we can get it over the 300USD and get a free shipping that would be great. I am located in Slovakia and would be interested in one pair so only 240USD or 4 pairs to go :D :D
Inside europe the shipping should be around 9€ from me to you. :)
