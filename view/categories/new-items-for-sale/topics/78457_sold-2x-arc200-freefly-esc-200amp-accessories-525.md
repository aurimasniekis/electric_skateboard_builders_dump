I picked up a pair of Arc200s for Barrett, but we're switching plans over to a 4WD build as our backup so realistically these beauties are going to sit on my shelf until I pick up my hydrofoil project next summer.

I figure rather than let them sit I'd throw them up here to see if anyone else wants them. These are brand new, only one has been opened just to do a basic power-on hello world test, firmware hasn't been updated yet even. 

I haven't had time to dig into these much, they are more complicated than a VESC by a good margin so I can't recommend these to those that aren't comfortable with more advanced firmware setup. They're ridiculously powerful at somewhere around 10kW of output power. 

Asking $525 shipped within the US, international would be additional shipping cost. Includes about $70 in additional cables, only purchased about 2 months ago so well within warranty.
