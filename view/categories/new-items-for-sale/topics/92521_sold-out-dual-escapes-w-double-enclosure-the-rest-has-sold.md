So the only thing left is the dual ESCape's with enclosure.  To just add to it a bit, I'll also include these cables.  Worth like ~$18.

Hey, just have the dual ESCape's with enclosure left and I'll include a few cable and a pack of xt90's.  Cost me $325 just for the main items, not including cables and etc.  Will do $300.  No lower.  They are brand be and haven't even been turned on.  Completely new.
