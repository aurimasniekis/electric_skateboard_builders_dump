I'm fairly new here, so cant post to New Items for sale or Group orders...so i'm posting here.

I'm having some batteries made for me and was going to sell the one that doesnt fit, it will be brand new.
They will include all the accessories: power button, LCD screen, BMS, Charge port, Charger

I'm thinking $220 is an awesome deal.  I'll post pictures/video/facetime once I have, but I may make this into a group buy if anyone else wants one, two or more.  

Note: I'm probably a week or two out from getting these but will keep you all posted, just wanted to help the builders all out as I couldn't find anything even close to this for less than double.

```
which cells are those exactly?
3,5ah is quite a lot for high discharge cells.
where you got your cells from? is it a legit source?

which bms you will use? for charge only?
if no, what will be the max discharge current?

the same for the power button.
how much amps the switch can handle and is it a fused switch?

The thing is if you get a 40a bms which you will use for over current protection you can already order a new helmet too.
If you still search for a bms, bestech makes good ones.

I've ordered these.  I should have them in a week or two, a few days for production and then shipping... and #%#$% shipping is crazy!

I'll post pics here when they come in.  I'm eagerly waiting all my other parts.  Hopefully i'll get some cruising in before the snow hits here.

I've decided NO power button, and LCD screen separate and not connected.  My thoughts are, I want good protection and i'm buying an anti-spark with button anyway.  And I can hook up the LCD to my switch myself.

Spec's are:

10s3p Samsung 30Q INR 18650 3000mAh 3.6V
36V 9Ah 
BMS (unknown...but i've asked for bestech)
LCD Battery Screen (standalone)
Charge Port
Charger 4A included
(no power button)
XT90/DC power  connector

Chat with you all in a week or so

It's big because they flattened it out so the BMS is not on top of the Samsung cells.  

Dimensions are great for my enclosure:

```
$212 including 4A charger, (shipping/customs/tax is about $53 of that) i bought 3 total and ran them through my business account in order to get them shipped to me.  

It was about $35 less per pack if I went with generic Matrix branded batteries, but I wanted genuine Samsung 30Q's, and they were custom built for me, not on shelf, so paid a bit extra.  

If they turn out well, and it looks from the pictures they are very good quality and well made, well padded and laid out, I may do a monster order for everyone and a few different layout configurations.  

It sure as hell beats paying $249 for a 10s2p from some of the eskate vendors and that's without a battery LCD display and w/o fast charger.

I think I negotiated quite a good deal with the vendor compared to their listed prices:

Batteries arrive on Tuesday. (also the day after my fence pickets arrive, so i may be busy building a fence for the wifey) Yet my heart wants to finish my board :slight_smile:

I asked some very specific questions, as I take care of all of my things, and Matrix gave me this response:

**Battery Maintenance:**

After charging the battery, it is recommended to remove the charger immediately, 
   Although our charger and BMS have circuit protection design.
   Prevention is necessary.

Avoid high temperature, low temperature and moist environmental storage.

Charger should choose good quality and suitable voltage/current li-ion battery charger, 
   Original charger is best choice.

If the battery is not used for a long time. It is recommended to charge once every 3 months.

If you want longer cycle life, it is recommended that batteries should not be full, charge 70-80% best.

Charging time is 3hours for this pack.

I want to know how many layers of nickel are on the series connections. Thatâ€™s what defines how good the pack is. 

They can use cells capable of 100a but if they use single layer nickel it ainâ€™t gonna last long thatâ€™s for sure

![Ampacity%20Chart|603x500](upload://xkf1v4b7PE6nrnCWUnBYzNSm20v.jpg) Well Iâ€™m pretty sure the general rule is 15mm x 0.2mm is good for about 15amps, that is based on the table I have. So really you want 3-4 layers on the series connections. 

The better way is nickel on the p groups and silicone wire on the series connections as that handles a lot more current. Another option is using pcb boards on top of the p groups and nickel strips or wire connecting each side to the pcb then linking the pcbs together with 10awg wire
```

this would be the quick n easy way to bring your pack up to par for current consumption... and only requires a soldering iron

Have you checked the internals?

I have not cut open my battery pack, and dont really feel comfortable in doing so.  I want to keep it well sealed/shrink wrapped and padded as it is in my small metal enclosure.

Looks nice but between of cells the are no any space (holders). It will makes degradation cells about 35% faster than usuall..

How does that work? Do you mean it will keep them cooler by having cell holder?

Sure, holder is like radiator

The reason the pack is long is because they soeciffically did not put the BMS on top of cells in order to keep pack cool. Most of the retail batteries I see show the BMS on the cells. Matrix does not recommend this. Also i havent seen many cell holders in retail battery packs only custom ones built by DIY. I am impressed with they quality and packaging of the pack compared to others that seem to be very fragile and inwould worry could come apart.

i think youre gonna need airflow between the cells for anything close to radiator like cooling abilities...especially since almost all packs are shrink wrapped... now i dont have the research on this, nor do i care enough, but im not feeling like using cell spacers vs not is going to give any major increase in life span... id say dont full charge a pack and that would be a better route to making cells last longer... that aside, after building a few packs now i dont seal the bms in the pack any more... i wire the pigtail with enough extra length so the bms can be mounted above the pack..or literally above (on top) of the pack...but i like having access to wiring in case i need to diagnose any of the parallel groups.

I may start a new thread for the battery as this one is quite ancient .
