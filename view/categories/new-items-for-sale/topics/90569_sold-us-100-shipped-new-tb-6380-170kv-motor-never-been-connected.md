<b>Update:  1 motor sold.  Selling Remaining Motor for $100 shipped in the US.  Let me know if you have any questions. </b>

Bought about a month ago for my first build.  Unfortunately that build is being postponed and I need to sell these.  They are brand new and have never been connected.   Asking for $245 (save $25) shipped in the US.  Let me know if you have any questions.
