Funny how it was never sold at the "normal" price, i feel like it was never going to be $300 it was just a marketing ploy. I bet if they mass produced these in bigger numbers they could still have a healthy profit at under $200 and would absolutley dominate the market. But you need to produce alot and have them widely available.

For sure! I would like to know the real price of it (not just pieces but in production, like Stewii did)

If anyone wants a single Unity for a even more discounted price, I can work with @DarkVortex and get you my basically new but portless Unity, it comes with all the hardware and is confirmed to work

I have one from the second batch used for less than a mile but the USB-c port is non-functional

Basically you can get a Unity for under $200

If we are being honest with the current price of vescs and quality, the unity seems to be worth every penny at $200. 

Of course If you create a great product, you're going to try and get as much money as you can for it. I can't knock the hustle.

For the people who paid before the sale and haven't shipped yet, can you just offer them an "upgrade" price to cover the rest of the $400? Then there's no orders to cancel. And not even more orders to fill since they're in cue already. Just flag their orders to add a 2nd Unity. Seems way less complicated and better for everyone. :thinking:

I'm in the UK and this works out to be £300. When I went on the site last week to buy one it was £180. £30 difference isn't worth it in my books.

They should just produce more and sell them cheaper because it'll be cheaper for them to buy. One of these at £150 base price would be an absolute steal and they'll be flying off the shelves. They'll still make a handsome profit with them aswell!

I don't know. Maybe I'll make an order when it's the "BIG SUMMER DEALS"...

I think it's a good offer once Enertion tighten up on promises, last time I checked Enertion has sales approaching $2m pa, it's nice to know that the $24k p/m payment to shippers is no longer a problem, but maybe having a real & loyal Enertion presence in the factory where they are made and fulfilled would be something Enertion as a company planning to get bigger could look into. 

Simply build it into the contract as a target, late shipping = cheaper cost to Enertion. Then failure to deliver on time is unacceptable to the factory owners, someone else will suffer and get the BS we ultimately have to swallow. Maybe this is already the case in which we see only the delays and not any benefit.

From a business strategy perspective the timing to coincide with Easter although cute, does not fulfill the remit of catching people when they are into a fresh paycheck, which is why I think this could be extended a few days.

Go Enertion?

In Aus should end up just under 300 AUD to your door each

* **Total Items:**
2
* **Subtotal:**
$397.98
* **Shipping:**
$29.11
* **Coupon (10%)**
-$39.80
* **Grand total:**
$426.03

426.03 USD to aud = 595.87

(looks like if you pay in USD using a 28 degree's or similar will get a better exchange rate then on their site)

I'm on the fence about getting one, if someone in SE Qld (preferably Toowoomba) wants to go halves that may push me to commit. Send me a message

@banjaxxed it looks like you can either have free shipping, 8% off or 10% off but can not have free shipping and a discount. For me it works out better to pay shipping and get 10% off.

Oh true for some reason it stopped showing in USD as it had before for me. Had me confused but still for some reason is now more expensive from what I saw before. 367$ USD with the warranty is approaching 400$. Not sure if that includes shipping though.

I ordered two but I no longer need them.
When they arrive later this year, it will be in Germany.
I paid 182 Euro each incl shipping.
There will come 19% VAT on top of it any maybe a customs handling fee.

If someone is interested in one or two please send me a message.

I fly beginning of August to US. If they come by end of July, I can also bring them to US.

it´s not like it´s the one esc on the marked... even not the only dual esc on the marked... 

If you need something fast than don´t preorder. easy as it. 

you got the timeline, end of mai-end of june they will sent it out. 

if you familiar with enertion preorders and there sheduled timeline, you could start asking in the beginning of July when they will ship your unity. before it´s just a waste of time and even if you ask million times, they will not sent you your unity faster.

Hi  `*|FNAME|*!`

**We know you've been craving your Unity for some time now, and we know it hasn't been easy!**

We've been working hard behind to scenes to improve the testing methodology we use on each Unity, as well as making the test process more efficient overall, meaning we have been able to optimise our Unity production line.

This now means that your order will be scheduled to be on its way to you near the start, rather than the middle, of July.  **You can expect your tracking information to reach you in the first two weeks of July.**
