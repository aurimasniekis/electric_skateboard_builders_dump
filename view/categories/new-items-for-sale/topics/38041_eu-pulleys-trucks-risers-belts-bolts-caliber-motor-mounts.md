Hi guys, I have some unused leftover parts for sale.
I will ship outside EU, but without parcel insurance ( can be expensive ), it's at your own risk.

Shipping costs: https://cennik.posta.sk/en - select country from "World" button ( + packaging: < 1€ ).
I don't mind to ship the package using any method you want. 
Untracked / uninsured shipping methods are at your own risk.
Or you can pickup the items in Bratislava if you live nearby ( eg. in Vienna ).

Bank Transfer / PayPal accepted, preferably friends&family mode, otherwise you pay the fee ( calculator: https://www.shopify.com/tools/paypal-fee-calculator ).

I can ship to Israel ( at your own risk as it's outside EU ), it would be 5€ untracked, 7.30€ tracked.
To London, it is 2.80€ untracked, 5.50€ tracked.

It's 5 euros for set of bolts ( 4 bolts x 2 trucks, so total of 8 bolts & locknuts ).
It's the price I paid for them ( incl. import duties I had to pay ).
I am selling these items non-profit ( sometimes even loosing a bit ).

Hi, I'm sorry, but this is pretty old thread and the mounts are no longer available. I should probably update the first post.
