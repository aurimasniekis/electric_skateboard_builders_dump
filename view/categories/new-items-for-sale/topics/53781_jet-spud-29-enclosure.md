Hello guys, I'm designing an enclosure for the Jet Spud and I need some feedback to fnish the design.

1. Would you rather have an enclosure for reverse mount motors or enclosure-side motor mounts? Take into consideration the reductio of wheelbase in case the enclosure is in the inwards position.

2. Would you rather have a light-slim enclosure or a double stacked cells one

3. Would you like a division between the cells and electronics or just big space for everything

4. Would you mount ESCapes (taller enbclosure) or regular FocBoxes/DIY VESCs (slimmer enclosure)

I would like one that allows inward motor mounting as I think it takes the look away from the board with motors mounted in reverse. Also, double stack tickles my feathers a little more and dosnt add that much height, and it would allow the escape. Oh yeah, and one big pocket :blush:

Yup, agree with @jlabs. The inward mount would add to the sleekness of the small deck. Necessary for a nice cruiser/short range build.

If you could make something like the one made by Unik but a bit thicker in the middle where it lowers a bit and maybe a few cm higher for the vesc part ill be your first customer for them if i have the money!

I'll definitely do a symmetric one?

Might make two versions a thin-light one for small battery and a double stacked one, both for inward motor position.

Keep the feedback comming

Could you make the enclosure 7.5" wide? The Vruzend kit needs a little more space than usual.

I could try but the enclosure would be super wide with no flares to hold it in place.

Could be cool, and a huge success.

Topmount means risers for big wheels and lots of height for doublestack. But I feel spud builds beg to be light.

So both single and double?

The VRUZEND module has a width of 22mm:

https://vruzend.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cell2-1-149x300.jpg

So 8 cells could fit in parallel for a total of 176mm (6.93") my enclosure is 185mm wide, you could also fit 10 18650 cells instead with just glue and some fish paper.

Following with interest :wink: Definitely I will think about the double stack,dl due to the high of my battery pack with BMS. If you need an idea for the size I designed a bigger version of the Unik's enclosure. You can find it here DIY Skateboard Spud Enclosure found on #Thingiverse https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2867594 (although I need to gain a bit of height by using two 3mm layers of gasket around the edges) Super curious to see the final result.

Maybe @eboosted and I can work something out as well so I can sell and ship them with Spuds

Would be easier for him because it’s less to drop ship and easier for the customer because they only have to order / get a shipment from one place. Seems like a win win to me

Me my self using vruzend v2 for this spud deck, for 10s2p 2rows it almost as wide as the deck. If you want thinner enclosure you can not stack the bms on top of the vruzend kit, so the longer side of the enclosure need to be configure also, a bit tricky using this vruzend kit since it took a lot of spaces on this short deck. I’ll be posting my built thread later (for your reference) maybe could help. I will consider @Eboosted enclosure without vruzend kit for more sleek look for this deck if i do spot welding my pack. 😊

This is my design to fit a Space Cell v4 + 12s BMS + 2xFOCBOX + AntisPark all together.

![IMG_20180429_104627|690x298](upload://dK1qAMk38jnu7OONqvbsp9J3W24.jpg)

Below the FOCBOX case I plan to place the Antispark + the wirings so it goes up to expose the fins out of the enclosure.

![IMG_20180429_104710|690x255](upload://7tNnjlajFOeAJpYb4USQHZK4lJE.jpg)

I feel is still a bit longer than it should (it takes some space of the wheelbite marks on the deck) but... I don't see any other way of doing it.

![IMG_20180429_104644|690x302](upload://uJh1qJb3if3nbJ55MIgsJLW4ZiY.jpg)


@Eboosted do you think all these shit will fit within any of your enclosures? No way, right? :slight_smile:

Man that's big. Make sure you want have problem when turning. 8f you see the enclosure I made it really take all the space between the wheels without reach the cut outs for the wheels. I agree that with a big bms is impossibile to fit everything in a small enclosure.

I'm sorry to say but no enclosure will fit all that at least not in the layout you went with. 

I'm making a dual layer enclosure so you could fit double stacked cells on one side and BMS, electronics and focboxes on the other side, this way you could have mounting flares

The rear will have wire covers on each side of the base plate for dual ESCs 

Final enclosure could be ready this weekend

No I don't. I am using regular weather seal and cutting a channel in it for cables.  I have some rubber sheat I might use thoug instead...  Then after everything is all good, I will through a dab of silicone where that cable gap is.... thats just my plan though, take it for what it's worth.... pennies on the dollar

One thing i want to mention. Enertion and TB enclosures both easily cracked because there was no reinforcement on the lip. If you added a thicker rim where the screws would go, that should prevent stress cracking.

At least you can hide a spud purchase from the missus easier...sigh I like it but too much on back burner, lovely enclosure

Beautiful! I'm planning to use a Jet Spud with @marcmt88's motor mount. Will the enclosure have issues with contact for let's say a longer motor mount? I would refrain from a reverse mount in fear that the motor can will hit the ground.

Uhm, do you have a picture of the motormounts?

I've tested a good clearance with @torqueboards inwards motor mounts.

You could always use risers to clear the motor mounts from the enclosure

They measure 99mm, 96mm and 88mm from top to bottom.
I would like to check if long motor arms like these will have an issue with hitting the enclosure 
but i'm thinking some ways to tackle that is to angle it away from the enclosure more and use bigger wheels.

I would install those motor mounts in reverse position, I don't know if they will hit the enclosure otherwise, remember the wheelbase on the Spud is extremely short, every milimeter is useful and shouldn't be spared, even less when you can easily use shorter motor mounts.

No way they fit, they are too long, you should mount them in reverse position.

The Spud enclosure double stacked is ready.

@stormboard1 I don't think it would fit, you will need to mount them double stack in order to fit  but not flat. 

Check the meassures on my website

How thick should the gasket be to make clearance on the single stack spud? I forgot to order one when I got the enclosure and now I’m going through amazon.

Just a couple is millimeters. Have you tried without the rubber gasket? If you tight the screws it could seal

I have. It would be putting a lot of pressure on my battery and won’t allow any padding if I don’t get the gasket.
