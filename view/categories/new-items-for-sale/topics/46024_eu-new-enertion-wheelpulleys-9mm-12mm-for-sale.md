Love these pulleys. Far superior to the bolted pulleys. No more vibrations.

How come? Did you change the bearing to 8mm?
```

## \#10 Posted by: SilentException Posted at: 2018-02-21T13:46:47.688Z Reads: 138

```
Evolve uses standard 608 bearing. Even though the 218mm truck axles are longer, there is not enough left to put on the wheel nut.
```

They use a slitly different bearing in there pulleys for a 10mm axle, though if you can't put on the axle nut, it's not because of the bearing, and that's very weird : (
```

## \#12 Posted by: SilentException Posted at: 2018-02-21T16:32:05.624Z Reads: 132

```
Yeah, you can use both 608 and 61900 (6900) bearing on Evolve pulleys. 10mm bore one is 1mm narrower but that wouldn't make any difference in fitting the wheel on the 218mm trucks.

Anyhow we wen't off topic but I am still interested if these Enertion ones fit for sure?
