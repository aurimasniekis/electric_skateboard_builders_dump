Hi everyone, this summer I started a project together with my father. We set to build a DIY friendly integrated deck designed specifically for builders. 

It all started when my father found a company that produces raw veneers and presses furniture parts such as chair rests for example. Thanks to one of their high pressure presses that has a 920mm radius mold we can press a deck of the thickness and length we want at a competitive price. 920mm results in a comfortable radial concave. 

After pressing the decks they are CNC'd by the same company. 

After this step the decks are finished by hand, so we can't guarantee exact tolerances. Nonetheless each deck will look perfect to the naked eye. 


**Features:**
- 36" Deck (925mm) in Beech wood: Haya in spanish hence the name.
- 9.6" (244mm) wide: Limited by the veneer size for now. 
- Symetrical 
- Radial concave
- Flush mount 
- 3 different wheelbases
- Integrated cable routing for up to 4 motors. Perfect for 4wd or dual diagonal. 
- 2 Routed segments of 674x76mm (26.5in x 3in). That fits even NESE Modules. Enough for 12s4p on dual config. 
- Depth of 22.5mm. Enough to fit 16650 to 21700 batteries and Flipsky V6 ESC's. 
- Lid (Prob. 1mm laser cut alu) with attached gasket: 1,2mm compressed. 
- Deck weight (with inserts) sub 2kg. (Final lid weight still unknown...). All incl.  way sub 3kg.
- Produced locally in Pamplona (Northern Spain) where I come from. 


**NOTE:**  It's still an ongoing project. I will keep everything posted on this thread: Deadlines, Prices etc. I will build a first 10s4p dual Focbox prototype in 11 days and test everything myself. 

If you got any questions please let me know. 


Here are some pics of CND'd **raw** prototype boards and some with finished woodworking. They still don't have the final sanding nor any Epoxy and PU coating on. We intend to keep the natural white color of the wood on the finished product.

These are beautiful. We need to see the concave though and lid!!! 

Keep up the great work, the idea behind this seems like the ideal board to me. Super nice, can't wait to see the 10S4P test

If any of you experts has noticed a little knot on the top veneer you are right. This was a production mistake: All backsides should look clean, without any optical imperfections.

This deck looks amazing and Im curious to how it feels when riding.
I see that there are slots milled out for the truck baseplates and would a belt drive still be able to fit on the deck or does there need to be a riser between the deck and the truck?
And do you want to go for a kicktail?
```

## \#23 Posted by: bevilacqua Posted at: 2018-09-15T21:56:56.912Z Reads: 732

Because of the mold geometry we can't add a kicktail. Creating a custom mold would be to expensive at this point. 

It depends on what motor diameter, mount lenght and wheel diameter you choose ;D. But no worries a belt driven setup will fit for sure.

quick test: this is with the raw cnc'd deck, the finished one has a little bit more of clerance. 
Trucks: TB 218 
Wheels: 6 Inch, similar to SixShooter Pneumatic wheels
Riser: 1" (25mm) (just a constraint dimension) 

edit: I changed the distance between the bearings on the wheel dummy. gives a litte bit more of turn

We are limited to beech wood because that is the material the company works with. Nonetheless beech wood also has really good properties compared to maple. On some regions it is even more difficult to source, maybe thats why there aren't more decks made out of it.

To maintain simplicity and lower cost the lid will be bolted directly to the top, so no hinge mechanism. This also ensures batter waterproofing. 

Cut it 3 pieces, 2 for the ends (hold by 2 truck bolts) and a big one in the centre. This way you dont't have to unscrew your trucks to service the board. 

Most of our enclosures have multiple M4 bolts holding it up, the benefit is that everything will stay in place when opening it :D

The divider on the board will be problematic for people that use dual vesc or equivlant like the unity.  Can one end of the board not have a divider to allow for that plus a BMS?

Maybe remove the divider towards the ends or one end?

The unity being so slim would allow to guide 3 of the motor cables to the other pocket when installed sideways. 

Connecting both pockets wold affect too much the overall structure. Even if the lid holds everything together. I don't want to be responsible for broken decks :sweat_smile:

Edit: A dual Flipsky 4.12 would also fit

I stared at first post again :) So the lid goes flush to the edge of the deck, and also into the truck mounting holes, to cover the phase wire cavity? I'm curious how much work to get the lid off :slight_smile: 

It would be nice if there was a pocket for all the standard ports/switches. I usually run a loopkey and a XLR charge port, but sometimes it's a 5.5mm port and also a e-switch. I hate to make big ugly holes with my drilll/dremel/chisels in this thing :slight_smile:

Well, the lid means dangling wires and really difficult water ingress protection.

I prefer a bit more of time to unbolt some extra screws than a gasket with inhomogen tension. Protecting the electronics from water ingress is prio 1.

We thougt about offering some kind of charging port / swich hole but as this is a DIY forum any everyone has different preferences we decided tho not drill any hole. It saves us time and money to potential buyers. 

I hope I can post a pic of the lid tomorrow.

I personally wont dill any hole: Push to start, timer to turn off. Charging port prob. wired throug the motor channels.

Hi Sean, sorry I've edited the post a bit, maybe I wasn't clear enough. 
The concave of the deck is created by a 920mm radius mold from the company that presses the decks. It's not a longboard specific mold as they don't have anything to do with skating.

Using a already existing mold gives us the opportunity to press low quantities at an affordable price

No need bro, I can easily go out and find any skateboard deck I want, just none are integrated enclosures including a kicktail. If I was to make an eskate specific deck like this with integrated space I would embrace the hybrid do-it-all deck designs, especially if i couldn't alter or add to the design later, because I could always cut away to make different smaller options

I know that you want the best skateboard experience and those are cool decks but I can't find a way to make a reasonable kicktail on that kind of deck. @NAF did it but amount of work kind of killed it in a long run.

We will probably have everything sorted out around mid. October. So shipping in around late October. As everything is done locally (even custom cardboard boxes) we can produce the decks quickly and ship them out as soon as we can. 

There always can be problems but the main part, the wooden deck, is practically sorted out. We'll maybe test to orientate 2 plys in the same direction to see if it offers any vibration dampening, but thats all.

The flush mount is quite deep so there is plenty of room to use shockpads. Although it shouldn't be stiffer than say for example a downhill board. 

My regular board is 18mm thick, thats 7mm less than our board. And it hasn't got any milled pockets.

Lid can be countersunk more so that the bolts don't stand out at all. Also the bolts in the pic have a quite wide head. 

Hope you can appreciate the mellow radial concave. 

Plexiglas pics will come later. 

Edit: The actual lid will be cut in 3 pieces as already mentioned. 
Edit**: Also forgot to mention that the hole on the ends (centered) is not gonna be in any production board.

Wow that is a very nice piece of craftsmanship was curious do you have pictures of a deck with internals?  Battery, esc, etc... also would modification of the internal stringer be necessary for dual esc?  If so how much integrity would be compromised?  Just thinking ahead for mounting a Unity dual drive.

Really like the channel and porting for phase wires.  This board would be so stealth with @hummie hubs or Carvon etc..

That would be cool. My logic is that any top lid will require fixings, which will detract from the stealth look of the deck and take away a bit of the prettiness.

Access from the bottom through a flush base will keep the board looking really slim and stealth and doesn't need as much attention to aesthetic detail as it would do for you making a fancy top. It could just be a simple flat cover.

Out of interest, why is it harder to produce? I'm ignorant to the process.

Everyone has there own thing they want and me the hole on top never liked it as it always felt hollow or flexible or something.  So many electric skateboards lose the nice ride of a nice wood deck with bolted on beams or sadly their battery becomes the beam, but still they‚Äôre a board n pretty much feel like one but the few completely integrated decks I rode, one I forget but with those avenue clone shock absorbing shocks, it was an aluminum I-beam I was riding.

But hopefully u make something better!  I‚Äôm curious how the bamboo would do

You can buy it directly from @agniusm at:

http://18650.lt/index.php/product/n-e-s-e-module/

Just choose DieBieMS in the dropdown. Your option is to print them yourself, if you have a 3d-printer, and buy only the hardware from @agniusm. You will find the drawings in the "Resources" page on his site.

Let me clarify.  

I meant epoxying magnets to the underside of the lid which would be attracted to a sliver of sheet metal inset in the structure of the deck.  This would allow you to make the deck lid from any material.

That's the concept.  How (and if) you execute it is up to you. :)

Way to expensive to produce. But this is a builders forum so we would have no problem to offer a deck without threaded inserts, any magnet with a 5mm diameter would fit.

Question for **USA** Guys: 

Shipping 14 Boards costs me almost exactly 100USD (24h UPS Express shipping). -> 7,15$/Deck. 

Would anyone be interested in REshipping them locally and making some $?
Each deck would come individually packed so it "should" be just putting a sticker on and dropping them all at the post office (or letting them pick up). 

Cost= 7,15 + USA-Shipping + Tip 

Individual shipping should be 35-45USD. 


Note: I did not do any deeper shipping-cost research yet...

I can take care of it if no one else wants too.  It will likely have to wait until the weekend for me to ship them all out as the PO by my office will not accept anything over 12oz because of some asbestos crap, don't ask me what the correlation is I don't know.

Shipping for a board is usually around $16 via USPS 3 day priority.  I'll check with UPS as well before, might be cheaper depending on the distance.

Sorry USA guys I made a mistake yesterday :disappointed:. I misinterpreted the shipping conditions (because of the poor explanation of the comparison-site...). Pricing for 14 boards is way higher than expected. 

We'll prob. stick to individual shipping after all. Easyer at the end. 
We will keep searching for the cheapest/best value option (this also applies to the rest of the shipments).

(This is directly out of the CNC. They still will have a more pronounced chamfer in front and sides that has to be sanded out) 


Today we'll also test-fit the first prototype laser cut lid. If it fits making 30 more should be quick. 

Gaskets are on its way, as well as the M4-Stainless-Steel (Black) Torx bolts for the lid.

we had to do some modifications to the hole pattern on the sides of the lid. The CNCd Model was some mm off my computer model. 

We also now will bend the lids to shape so that the gasket-board contact stays the same on the entire perimeter.

Hi Guys, 

PRICES: 
**Note: With this prices we are still in a negative overall balance. It's piced to cover raw material cost and external production (laser cutting / cnc'ing and so on). The CNC fixtures aswell as earlier prototypes also cost money. All the finishing work also is barely taken into account. We are aware that this is the first batch, however I am confident that not many changes will occur in following production runs. 
This pricing will be **only** for the first batch. 

- HAYA V0 Integrated Deck (Gripped*): 165‚Ç¨
- HAYA V0 Deck (w.o grip): 160‚Ç¨

*Griptape: Jessup 10" Griptape (Medium grain size). The one shown in my board. 

The Deck includes:

- Aluminium Lid
- EPDM Gasket attached to the lid
- Stainless Steel Torx M4 hardware for the lid in Black 

SHIPPING Prices: Will follow in the coming days. (Im a little busy with uni. work). I'll probably DM personally as shipping costs will vary depending of the county. 

Best, Mathias
```

No need to give it away. Personally, I would place more value on more decks in the future, than saving a few bucks.

Much thanks either way for all your hard work.

Also as I said, only minor changes (prob. optical) will happen, it's not like we are selling an unfinished product.

Small update: 

Everything is on track except the aluminium lids. The company that laser cuts them for us has to do some restructuring and won't cut us the lids till Friday. 

All decks were sanded to the final shape. 

My father is now in the process of applying the protection coatings to the decks. First 2 layers of Acrylic polyurethane outside/inside and then 2 layers of bi-component scratch resistant polyurethane. In-between will be the silk screen printed logo. 

If the lids are cut on time we will start shipping the 1st of Nov 01/11. Starting with outside EU (As shipping will be a bit slower) and then shortly after the EU-boards. 

I'll be sending out a Google form in some minutes in witch you can choose your configuration (Grip yes/no, Logo yes/no). Please respond within 72h as we will start silk screen printing soon before applying the anti scratch layer. 

(More details in the form)

** The form was sent to the emails you provided.

It kinda evolved to this last version. My brother and father have seen it on the decks and they found it better. 

If enough people want the V1 logo I could can talk to my father to make a 2nd silkscreen (If it is too much work it will stay at only one final version. )

I would be interested in this deck however I would want it as just a CNC'ed deck with the lid and no clear coat or screen printing because I would want a huge design on the bottom of the deck with a woodburner. However, I am guess that this is European beech wood and it can in rare cases cause nasopharyngeal carcinoma when burnt so that would be a no go.  If you ever do this in deck in maple birch or bamboo I would definitely be interested.

I could send you a "naked" one in the future. Maybe we'll play with some finishing veneers of a different type. DM me in some time and we could talk about it. 

I kinda like that our deck is shown in its purest form. Without any other types of veneers that are used just for aesthetics.

With it being Beech wood I would not want to risk my health when burning the design into the deck.  I will suggest using a spar urethane as the sealant as it helps with UV and water protection and really brings out the beauty in the wood grain.  It is my sealant of choice for my decks.

Overseas guys. I can include a Invoice with a reduced value, lets say for. example 55‚Ç¨ inkl. shipping on the Box. This way import taxes should be lower. When paying with PayPal you could just make 2 different payments and show the one marked with 55‚Ç¨ at customs.

EDIT: Apparently for US Guys its not a problem:

[quote="moon, post:366, topic:68132"]
An informal entry is the entry of goods valued under 2500US$ and **does not need** to be cleared by a customs bond as it is designated for mostly personal importations. The amount used to be 1000$ before 2013 but the threshold has been increased to 2500$ since then.

Wider yes. Deeper maybe max 1mm at your own risk. Should be possible to mount though. I did even put some 2mm foam ontop of the diebiems 22mm enclosure. 

Production units will be 1,5mm deeper than mine, so it should work. 

I intended to make this deck as universal and furure-proof as possible. This should include 21700 :grimacing:

Otherwise just carefully drill a hole wherever you prefer. Similar to what you would do on an ABS enclosure.

Hi everyone, sorry to bother again, but we decided to use the solid version of the latest logo design. Everyone that has seen it in person prefers this one compared to the lined one. 
I hope you don't mind the change. This is also the logo that all future boards will have. 

(This one is printed in black on a transparent sheet, **final ones will be white**)
**I'll post a pic of a printed one in 1-2h from now**

And second: we have to modify the silk screen as quickly as possible as the actual one is a bit to thin :/ (We were not expecting to have the latter issue)  

We are working as hard as we can, it's just the ups and downs when you develop a new product

Good point: The gasket on the bottom of the lid helps, but if the components are loosely mounted it will resonate. But, if everything is mounted with padding it will not make any sounds. 
I had that exact issue when building my board. In the end, it was dead silent.

Here's an idea I've been thinking about. Acrylic lids to showcase the innards of our builds. Or metal lids with cutouts/windows on where the channels would be. Similar to PC case side panels.

could be done. I can share the lid pattern: that way it could be easily DIY'd. 
@Blacksheep asked for it too, we are just too busy right now. Maybe as an option in the future. 

Would look dope for sure.  
Oh and acrylic would shatter instantly, ours was super fragile. Better go with clear polycarbonate.

@moros your deck is coming with mine to Munich, then I'll send it to your home. Decks without logos will be shipped starting tomorrow. 
The rest will start shipping some days after, we had to wait for one last silkscreen. The logo is becoming a bit of a PIA... (Sorry, combining everything with a day job is a bit difficult sometimes).

We'll start shiping overseas decks this thursday. And European ones on Sat/Monday.

Quick manual. Will be updated over time. 
V0.1: 

https://www.dropbox.com/s/8naaj30fu04tz0m/HAYA%20V0%20Manual.pdf?dl=0


Important note: The lids are directional, this means that they can be mounted only in 1 position. Do not flip them over or turn them around. Even though the deck is completely symmetrical they had some off-placement of the lid holes when CNC'ing. This does not affect the overall shape of the deck nor the ride quality

no Idea, you should have gotten a DHL-Express tracking number (They send it only to the person receiving, I don't get them). Check it here: http://www.dhl.com/en/express/tracking.html

Spanish customs are apparently quite strict (and slow...), even with packages that leave the country, so that may induce some delays.

Well they never attempted in the first place, lol.  From what my tracking history shows the package never left Spain.  That would suck if they had already shipped it over the pond, but they usually have to wait like two weeks after the first delivery attempt.

the issue seems to be one missing document DUA (Documento Unico Administrativo) that has to be included on top of the customs declaration. AND it has to be presented by a customs agent that we would need to hire.

Any updates on your end?  I just checked tracking and nothing has changed, so I'm guessing from that and what you just said you'll have to get the decks back so you can get that paperwork included with it?  Man that's such bs, like I've shipped things internationally before and they told me exactly what I needed to include for paperwork..  So they just let you send these decks and they didn't bother to tell you that you needed to include specific paperwork!?  They are slacking in their job responsibilities, lol.

To be clear, I'm not upset with you I'm just venting, lol.  You guys have done an incredible job with these decks!  So many things on this forum end up taking forever, so the speed you were able to get these built and shipped out is absolutely amazing :slight_smile:  Hope to hear some good news soon, fingers crossed, lol!

I kinda have updates. The customs guy that I contacted said that we needed one specifix extra document. And the shipping company told me that there was missing one thing in the declaration-invoice (totaly diferent form what the other guy told me). 
All the Customs-declaration invoices have been sent to them again, so now I just have to hope that they get through. 

The decks were not sent back to me, but to the shipping company that took them from my hometown to Madrid. Zeleris takes them to madrid and then DHL takes over up to USA. 

Im also super pissed because they didn't tell me anything until I contacted them...

I will be keeping an eye on the shipments. I'll ask the shipping company again tomorrow. 


Side note: What makes it a bit more complicated is that the shipping is organized by an online portal and then is handled by 2 different shipping companies. Both DHL and ZELERIS told me that it was not their issue (as I wan't their client) and that I should contact Packlink (the online portal) which hasn't even got a telephone-assistance, only mail and chat... :grimacing:

So you think you'll be able to get things sorted out without having to actually receive the decks back, or you think you'll have to personally receive them to put the paperwork with them?

Little tips for those who don't wan't to make holes in the board. 
First buy @Martinsp push to start antispark switch with auto off. 
And put your charging port here  ( only in single or dual config )  ![15428963099409017920035196986462|375x500](upload://11NAQwmaVK2ea2diupONIOYjdoP.jpeg)

the diebiems NESE module does fit, so the normal battery modules should fit too.

I'm sure you already appreciate this but sometimes it's good to hear it.

Strike while the iron is hot, there's a bunch of people here who really wanted to get in on this first run and it's clearly been a success. You guys should focus on pumping another run of these decks out asap while the build thread hype is strong.

Just my opinion :call_me_hand:

Your are right, this time it was just too much manual work for my father. The goal is to make almost everything with the 5 Axis CNC and not just (70%). 

As soon as we know how and where we do it we could do another run.

Edit: I also want to collect feedback from the first betha batch. And that is just a bit complcated if 10+ decks are stopped in Madrid :(

I dont want this to be a just a hype product. Our goal is to slowly grow over time, maybe start with custom molds, experiment with materials and so on.

They were returned, this is the same that happened to Blasto/Uriah/MikeNYCs boards.

I suspect that they never actualized the original documentation (my ID was missing).

They will handle it back to DHL today or tomorrow I hope (with the corrected Docu. I sent them over a week ago‚Ä¶) and it should pass customs that way on the second run.

I‚Äòve been messaging them every day, but almost nothing has happened‚Ä¶

Sorry for the extreme delay, I‚Äòll let you guys know if I have updates.

EDIT: (In case this has caused some confusion) 

They were returned to ZELERIS, the shipping company that picks up the packages at our home and then handles them to DHL for the international delivery. All of them are still in Madrid.

Yes, full leaning with Ronin cast trucks, and you right about normal riding, but I think for slow carving I have to put more risers, also thinking to late a bit the wheels,  I will modify whatever is needed to skate the Haya deck, I love it :) 
The Escape fits inside, but no the jst connectors, they got too compress with the lid.
@lukepl the ESCape is the ones from the very first batch and assembled by hand ;)
The thickness with the top pcb is 2cm.
By any chance can you mill them couple mm? I just started to look around my city to use a CNC service with the worst luck in years.

That sounds like a better idea. You might need extra space for the wires coming out of the ppm after it's flipped. But you could route small groves for that, which would be a lot easier than routing the whole pocket out. Trust me, milling these pockets out again is a pain.

There should be space, dont worry it it squeezes them a bit. I also use Cell-Holders + bus bars/balance leads on top. (And my proto deck should have 0,5mm less than yours).

The foam is 1mm thick. Should be ok for that gauge wire.

Yes, what Preston said, look for some markings on the lid/deck made with a white sharpie (A and X in my deck). 

Other than that try to first guide all the bolts before you torque them down. Starting from the sides going (symmetrically) inwards when bolting it down.

So, brace yourselves, after calling again Zeleris we found out that the packages will be returned to us personally today/tomorrow, they are already on the way from madrid to our home. 

Im so fcking angry with Packlink, because they did not tell me anything. Aparently they never got any new documentation and even Zeleris told them last 28/11 that they would send them back to us. 

We will sue them for sure. :face_with_symbols_over_mouth::face_with_symbols_over_mouth::face_with_symbols_over_mouth:

We will send the packages out as soon as they arrive. Probably via the spanish post, as they handle customs internally without any 3rd party interaction. 

I'll give you more updates in some hours.
I hate this situation so much....


**UPDATE:** 

They have arrived.

So, we will bulk send them to Germany and then I'll send them all out from here via DHL directly. 

By now I already have an International exporter license and a registered company in Germany. This way nothing should go wrong. **And It still will be quite faster than the regular Spanish post.** 

Shipping them with DHL-Spain is x2 more expensive than in Germany, and I refuse to go the packlink route.

So, I managed to prepare the packages in sub 20min to be at the post office before 12 PM (Closing time) and got there by 11:55 :D  

The packages look a bit beat up because of all the traveling back and forth, but all should arrive in good conditions. Also, my taping-work was a bit rushed too, sorry for that. 

This time I included all the documentation x4 in each box, with exporter number, ID No. etc. etc. 

If you didn't get the Tracking No. by next Monday max please let me know via PM and I'll send it to you.

@bevilacqua 1st dumb question and my fault, I span the deck and lid around so many times the obvious thing happened, not sure which end of the lid fits to which end of the deck. 

One side definitely looks more aligned but I thought I would ask, the funny thing is the numbers marked on the deck and lid are at opposite ends if I choose that way, is that correct?

pick the one that looks "more aligned", every deck was a tiny bit different. This was caused because the vacuum suction wasn't 100% perfect then the upside of the deck was milled down. 

There should be a marking on the lid and deck with a white marker. something like 11 and 11, on the deck its harder to see. 

looking really good :)

ok, was to check if it was like mine, but its a stupid question since all cast ones have that angle :sweat_smile:

I guide my charging port (on paris trucks) through the baseplate hole. I intended to use a 3d printed holder, but I was lazy and just filled it with silicone.

weird, because it was shipped with the lid on... can you tell me what deck no. it has? maybe my father knows more

Edit: wait, @mikenyc, is it that it seems too long? 
my father didn't want any gap on the ends. That meant that on some decks the fitting was really tight, pressfit-like tight. 
 If so, try sanding both "noses" of the lid a tiny bit.

Use rubber ended grip clamps, they will flick it past the edge. That worked for me 10 mins ago. Don‚Äôt use the screws to do it or you could thread ‚Äòem 

Not a bad idea Pat, didn‚Äôt try that trick

Main thing is that all holes align before screwing anything in

Down the road we‚Äôll be thankful for the ingress protection such a tight fit allows

Haha I've explained this in other threads and PMs I don't know how many times but here you go one more time. 

I bought two cause I thought "holy crap these are awesome!!" and reasonably priced. What a DEAL!! I bought the max I could by because I tend to stock up when i see something good at a good price point. I don't want to sell anything. I want to build two awesome stealth beast boards. That being said every object is a commodity. When humans saw that I purchased two they filled my box with PM's to purchase. 

My value of the board - given quality of craftsmanship, unknown timing of next production run and my own desire to build is double what I paid......that is having seen the product and touched it, if I did not have one of my own I would be willing to pay my asking price 330 euros, for any like good of this caliber. 

I am not actively selling anything but I do have two and if you wanted to make an exchange for one of my two Haya beauties I would be willing to part with it for the given value. I'm happy either way and will still have at least one of the first built up and being ridden in the coming two months. 

laugh about the price all you want - these boards are lush and given scarcity paired with their sex appeal that is my value 

@bevilacqua- you have a super fan and I will gladly support any further builds of yours and your family. Thank you 1000x over.

I'm looking at compression packs just because I would like the ability to pull individual cells for replacement or balancing, also what I haven't as yet seen is cell level fusing, that would be a stretch goal 

I found a compression design on thingiverse but I only managed to make it slightly shorter since SCAD math would not be my area, thinking aloud via pictures 

N.E.S.E packs are a couple of mils too tall unless modified, that's a power bank print which use the same height dimensions afaik

There is about 20.5mm to work with without any padding.

that little spool is for fuse, yes I have braid, 8 AWG or sheet options for parallel, BTW big amps flow through the series connections, you only need like 10mm nickel between each cell in a parallel pack

I get you, and in fact the same person made series sleds but of course they will only work on button cells which I don't use

I can weld them and use Chakka's cell level fusing design also on thingiverse

But that defeats the purpose of thinking through the process looking for new ideas or improvements

I am aware that the design need to be suitable for high discharge <-> parallel packs edit: the high discharge flows in series

this is my pack. You would need to have individual copression tabs, maybe its eough if you cut/isolate them (NESE ones for example). Then solder (spotweld) the fuse to a common bar.

You still solder onto the cell. I believe @banjaxxed is looking to make a pack like the winflys or NESE where the cells are still removable. 

I saying this I would be interested to see what is actually required to get a 30q to actually catch on fire... Maybe you could fuse P groups on 3-4p packs depending on the individual cell tests above?

Yes this is the idea you get it! Nice pack there btw

I completely get that for a good connection there are many factors worked out by @agniusm which led me to buy his hardware, in fact I do have some poron/dimples left over.

However that is cheating, I may do that but I would like to see what I can butcher together first

In fact I agree with both of you @Friskies, I do want removable cells AND fusing

Here‚Äôs another cart which has a good size height wise but spring is too weak, maybe a union of the two designs along with something to make homemade dimples

you can apparently spot weld fuses as well:

-Solder to braided wire

I'm pretty sure it's only necessary to fuse one end.

The positive terminals are actually easy to solder if you use a quality iron, good flux and solder.

The negative terminal is the whole body so it sinks a lot of heat. The positive is isolated from the body so heats up quick, and doesn't heat the actual cell, but if you leave the heat too long the plastic parts for the CID will start to melt.

You should only need 1-2 seconds to solder a fuse wire though. If I was being paraniod, I would:
- lightly scuff sand positive terminal
- flux a positive terminal
- apply 63/37 solder using a largish tip, no more than 3 seconds. 650-700 egrees. Form a small mound. Cool the area with a moist (not soaked) sponge immediately.
- tin the fuse wire
- flux the terminal
- do the joint. Should take like a fraction of a second.

@banjaxxed. Whats the reason for the fusing? Only tesla does it and the rest of the world somehow manages go  arround without them. Cars, laptops, tool packs, golf carts etc. I mean 99.99% of the market that uses lithium cells dont use them.  I can point you where this madness started(my colegue) and even he admited after a while that individual cell fusing on bikes is overeoveroverbuild let alone skateboards.
Internal shorting is so rare, it just makes no sense what so ever.
Even worse, cell fusing on small packs is dangerous. I suggest to watch some vids from elithion by Davide. They make high end BMS'es and are competent.

Recently Someone in here made a New pack with New batteries. Somehow  two cells from the entire Pack got damaged or were damaged. these two cells dipped below 2,5v... A cell Level fuse would have Safes the healthy cells some cycles (because of the p group balancing behaviour) 
So cell Level fuse cannot be over build when such things Happen. It wont Happen as often as other failures but you should not count them out. But they arent neccessary too.

Don't think cell level fuse would have made a difference here.

Cell level fuses would save from some types of catastrophic fire causing failures, but then the whole system needs to be looked at in light of these fuses. It's not a clean winner. there are trade offs. I think it can make sense in a large pack with lots of extra space and a super smart BMS. I think it can cause more harm then good in small packs that are built like non-cell-fused back in all other ways.

I like how in @bevilacqua's pack the fuses are mostly visible to the naked eye. One of the "bad" things about cell level fusing is, it's hard to tell if a fuse disconnected. Being able to see it is not foolproof but it helps.

Cell fusing would save from overcurrent or short or internal short. The bad thing is that if one fuse blows on such small pack, that current will be pulled from smaller count of cells which will cause chain reaction. Not a problem of 2 cells blowing in couple hundred cell p group, but pulling 40A from 4 cells, 2 blown fuses means twice the current for remaining cells and in unlikely situation where the fuses dont blow on remaining cells or cell caused by increased current, you might light up the whole pack on fire

Actually it would be the opposite. If right fuse(rated for right current) is used then, the fuses would just burn out and prevent the cells from over current. 

Although it might be dangerous to suddenly lose battery while riding, but then you get to save your pack. What would be ideal is for the bms too somehow detect that the fuse has melted and warn us to make repairs.

I think we could possible be talking about two different things lol. I was saying that the bms detects its overdischarge limit by measuring the voltage of the cell. That‚Äôs why most say 2.8v cut off and such. 

This means that if a fuse blows the bms will still stop that p group from over discharging because it will drain faster than the rest due to lower ah. Once hitting that LVC the bms stops all discharge. 

An example of this is with power tools. You know when your drill battery is almost flat and you try to put in a screw or drill metal drawing high current and the drill cuts off. This is because the high current dips the voltage below the bms LVC and it turns off. However if you take it away from the load and try again it will still function but not with any loads applied.

Yes, I did the same check, but they are much bigger. I just talked about the small M8 style version. If u go for a bigger hole, there are plenty of other good plugs...

EDIT: I am wrong there is a 8mm version in 7A, but it looks strange... I guess its used for mounting on a grounded hole or something... so its not very convenient for our purposes. The next one is a 5A Version is not good looking and has a 10 or 12mm core. No information in the data sheet. Do u find a nice one in 5A? @bevilacqua

I created my fist version of the raiser with the XT30... just exchanged it because @bevilacqua showed me the small dc 5.5mm plug... 

Maybe I ll upload the XT30 version as well...

Heh, not sure what you meant there. The holes on the side of the base plates are too small to fit the 3 phase leads and the sensor wires. They might fit if I remove the sleeve protecting the wires, but I don‚Äôt really feel like doing that. I might make some longer wires and run them from the inside out.

Hi guys,
got a noob question regarding the Haya board and trucks but first, let me explain what the talk is about:

This is a 1905 photo of the very center of Milan (Italy).
http://blog.urbanfile.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Siamo-in-Corso-Vittorio-Emanuele-verso-San-Babila-1905.jpg

What has changed in the meantime:

![pavimento|666x500](upload://n9TtLSsJUsoe4JWkPCyf61oGncq.jpeg) 

![2018_MIlano_Pav%C3%A9_10|667x500](upload://dLjY1QCVSq88NvGTjCOCFjFKqHk.jpeg) 

![2018_MIlano_sanpietrini_1_Via_Medici|667x500](upload://dhiWefNCC6JJLBt2Ki3EKMgJV9t.jpeg) 

It's called "pav√®" and we love it (don't ask why). Pav√® is not everywhere in Milan but the very center is full of it. So every time I go from point A to point B with my first build mounting ABEC11 107 mm flywheels and I have to pass through the center, I need to carefully plan in advance the route in order to avoid it. 
I'd really like to spare me this in the future.

Now the question:
Do you think possible to transform the Haya board  in a sort of Trampa style "urban carver", maybe with dampas/springs? If yes do you have any advice regarding the choice of the trucks, possibly EU based?
```

Sure, and it should look pretty super awesome :+1: 
With some 30/35¬∞ riser to work with the mini spring trucks. (maybe the mbs matrix 2 are even better to carve with - or add some elastomer damper upgrade to your spring trucks like MBS is not compatible with 22mm bearing of your FW ... it's start to make a lot of part for this change.
An air wheel will work better on this. and could be set on the tb218 (maybe enought lenght to avoid wheel bite).
Sorry I just leave my ideas and felt. I like your plan ;)

I really would avoid trampa/MBS trucks, with 30deg risers it would be super high, maybe your best chance is to get FB240 trucks from Kug3lis and maybe some gummies or 6" pneumatics at max

edit: @venom121212 suggested  MBS ATS 12 trucks, those seem like they would work

Just kind of 'ape' the LaCroix setup for what you want.

* 6 inch tire/hubs (see Bergmeister deal thread)
* MBS pro trucks with orange blocks/hollow trucks. **Edit:** I forgot LaCroix difference, this is non-tipped deck so yeah standard trucks for sure
* @Rithblu  @Idea  @marcmt88  mounts, research and choose

15mm+ belts unless you decide gear drive in which case I would really, really hook up with the upcoming @riverside.rider @nuttyjeff combo offer

Also @moon is doing something 

Alternatively look at the hub drives with pnummie adapters popping up everywhere.

But you do want 6" pneumatic tires, I think your teeth would fall out even with Gummies

The PCB idea is really good, maybe even for flexy decks

Will each cell be connected to the PCB or each P group? I thought of printing some supports for each cell, each is glued to the PCB and the cell glued to it then wired/fused

How are you going to do it?

Each individual cell will spot welded on the pcb, the P and S connections will be done on the pcb. The tracks are wide enough to safely pass 30A. Im not a believer of cell fusing on these small packs... but it could be done.

Once the cells are installed, i left a gap to insert fish paper in between each S connection. Then i‚Äôll inject RTV silicone to ‚Äúmount‚Äù the cells on the pcb

hey guys! finally managed to get myself some money to buy two Surf Rodz RKP 200mm with 60mm axles and 45¬∞ baseplates. That was tough I and finally forgot going directly via Surf Rodz. I went as most of the time with my friends at Sickboards. Colorwise... we went a bit on the wild seduction side. Pink & Gold. Yes I know.

For the wheels I'll put some 85mm blue Otang Caguamas.

I'll put some Epoxy 2K Matte on the deck to protect.

For the setup, well. I may be heading towards a dual rear UNiK setup 6355 ; 15/32T on 12S4P? That should be decent.

For the mount, I'll modify one of my UNiK dual core and get a new pattern for the Surf Rodz. 

Of course, I'll go for a build thread !

Would anyone also be interested in a raw option? (would be cheaper of course) 
- naked deck with final sanding
- inserts, lid, bolts and foam separately (all needed to finish a deck, except wood finishing)

I think the raw one would be without logo, or maybe optional if it can be printed over non-treated wood. Although the main objective of that deck option is to minimize the finishing work (witch takes surprisingly a lot and its done mainly by my father in his off time)

[quote="Deodand, post:619, topic:64944, full:true"]
If you go down a big hill on 13s and exceed your max speed for a sustained time the unity will not handle it. The DRV is rated to 60V, it has protection against transient spikes beyond 60V which seem to be doing their job very well, but a sustained applied voltage beyond 60V is likely to end badly.

That is the extreme of extreme cases. Running on the upper limits of the hardware comes with that risk. If you are concerned I would just get the warranty and you should be fine. If you can't blow it up in the year you probably never will. 

It's just the limitation of the deck. They have made use of most of the available space. If you want more you really need to go wider with something like the recurve and run a third channel with some of @Chaka's vescs - I'm doing this for a 12s5p 4x4 build.

Not soon I think, I'm really busy with Uni-work till the end of the Month. We have pressed veneers for 4 prototype decks. Before I leave Spain in 10 days we'll have something to play with.
 I also found out that the company that presses the decks has an open mold for a deck with some camber... and we have some ideas regarding that shape too. Next week after christmast break we'll visit them to see if something can be done. 

The kicktail deck would loose roughly 70mm of battery space, leaving 2 600x~76mm channels, making it longer wouldn't make much sense as the flat kicktail would become useless

I am running 13s and I live on a 14% grade hill. I dont go down the hill at full battery often. Usually I unplug at around 52-53v since it's better for the longevity of the cells and the last 10-15% takes forever to charge anyways. When I'm at full charge, I go down the hill slower than usual so that I'm spending charge to brake instead of Regen. Regen is a bell curve you get optimal Regen at certain load. 

As for 60V hardware limit, I run no_hw_limit FW on my 6.6s I have accidentally hit the brake on the full charge twice and the VESC faulted and cut my brake off. Honestly I was going so slow already I just foot brake my way down the hill. Went back and read the fault. 57.9v peak, so I raised my over voltage cutoff to 58V now. I like playing the risk if you haven't notice. Haven't had an issue with 13s cutting off since then.

So i orderd Magsafe connector..

The connector can plug in both ways.

The first 2 are magnetic and the last 2 are not but it would be very easy to make them so with some 3D printing. One can even get the pogo pins separately and make an array trapped in a 3d printed connector.

@bevilacqua if our boards that we ordered in round one are not found can we just apply the payment we sent to you for the next production run?  Would that be acceptable with you?  I don't think I'll need my HAYA until the middle or end of March.  I'm in no rush here.  Ideally I'd like the first batch production board but can wait until the next run providing you would be able to ship to USA by end of March.

Expected updates for **V0.2**:

- Wider channels: 82mm (vs 76mm) to fit 4 20700 cells in parallel. (Will have to test rigidity, but should be ok)
- Slightly deeper wire channels
- Maybe 1ply more to add 1mm depth ? **Feedback from builders?**(My proto has 1 lees than yours, but I have 18650s...) 
- Nose shape change (see posts above) 
- The raw deck option (that includes everything but wood finishing) will cost a big chunk less

- Did I miss something **simple** that would improve the deck? 

As mentioned, the production should start the last week of feb.
Also, I have not calculated pricing. This time EU guys pay taxes (19% :/). The rest 0%. I will try to squeeze the pricing as much as we can (still not calculated, sorry for that)

Edit, now renamed: **HAYA HB92** 

(short board will be HB83/2 not decided yet)

I think we will leave as it is, the design cannot include traditional wheel wells, because we would cut into the compartments. The new nose helps, but there is not much more to do

@StefanMe uses 105 rubber wheels (skullboard ones?) on TB wide trucks. Going wider helps too. 
 
Or, you use brackets like in @sofu 's stunning build

I have one suggestion to throw in the mix, have you considered just making the entire top layer the aluminum plate. I would assume this would be easier to make and wouldn‚Äôt require much fine tuning to get the lines to meet up nicely.

One more thing, add a bit more ‚Äúgap‚Äù where the wood and the aluminium meet. I couldn‚Äôt get the cover to fit back on flat once i removed it (didnt notice if it was like this to begin with) 

Had to file down less than a mm on each side of the wood to get the lid to sit properly.

The early prototypes where like that. The idea behind baking it a 3 piece system is enabling the openig of the lid without loosening the truck bolts. It would be easier to make, thats true...

both ways work, there is a hole for those who want to use a footstop for example. 

One of the last ideas was to make the edge pieces "bolt-on" too. They could be swapped if the nose gets damaged, and could maybe even integrate a bumper.

I like the idea of full alum top. Trucks could mount under the plate.also it would be better from water proofing as you dont have to worry about gravity water seeping in top seals....

 Altho i would think that would put a lot of stress on the bolts/screws for the lid while carving. The trucks kinda lock the plate with rest of the deck, and prob take most the shear forces. Course i could be over thinkin that.

He is powdercoating the lid, so that should be dope!

we still got no CNC prototypes of the shorter board (they are super busy). Hopefully they finish it before I fly home in ab 2 1/2 weeks. I'm bringing the components of my other boards to swap decks (Dual 5065/Ronin /VTC6 10S3P/ 4.12HW). 

Inspired by @neiru37 I'm hoping to design and print some NESE-Tab based Plug&Play modules to make it a flight friendly board.

Note: the original intend was to use 2 pillars to press fit into the hardware holes. I never got it aligned and we hot glued it instead.

Hi Justin, Im flying to spain this Friday, I'll visit the company that presses the decks to find out when exactly we coud start production. All should go pretty quick around the end of the month. But since the last time I have no news. As soon as Im done with some UNI stuff this week I'll open a google form in case some of you guys want to reserve a deck.

You should be able to do it without the added ply, try to be careful with the depth. Also widen it symetrically If you decide to expand the channels.

Yes, we are waiting for a CNCd sample to test the alignment of the lid (We changed the hole pattern of the sides). 
As soon as we receive it we could test it and give green light for production. We will be able to  produce limited stock on the first run of the updated shape. Expected production kickoff is around mid-end March. 

We will deliver them like the HB83 short board, with 3 coats of 2-component poly matte varnish and non assebled.

Target pricing will be +-150e (maybe a bit more for EU folks because of taxes). 
Shipping would be around 40‚Ç¨ Non EU and sub 20‚Ç¨ EU. (No snail mail) 

In order to avoid shipping problems to the States we‚Äòll do a test shipment. 

I will open a G-Form shortly (today or tomorrow) if someone wants to reserve a deck. The rest will be stocked for our upcoming website.

Best, Mathias

P.S: Sorry for the delay but our manufacturer had more workload than paned.

(Note that the bolt positions will change, the deck in the image is a sanded down version of the original shape)

I will post some images after we receive the CNC testsample. The nose is a bit more pronounced, this makes sanding it much easier and helps a bit with wheelbite. 

1ply is added for 1.2mm more depth, and the internal boxes are widened from 76mm to 84mm to allow up to 4 2X700 cells in parallel.

Planning battery options here. From what I read in a previous reply the N.E.S.E modules were 2mm too tall to fit in the first run of the HAYA deck. For the second run there is an extra ply for 1.2mm extra depth. So they still won't fit, can anyone confirm?

So, all the decks are already pressed. CNCing (maybe) starts next week, pob. at least one sample to check the milling tolerances an adapt those to the alu lid. 

That being said, I dont want to be over confident, prob shippign will not start before the end-ish of April. There are a lot of small production steps to undergo before we have a finished product. I hope you understand that. 

If you got any other questions feel free to ask.

@neiru37  The Haggy trucks are pretty long, not sure of the exact length from axle to axle. Maybe @riverside.rider can chime in with the dimensions. Only problem next if its long enough, is that you need to use a different gearbox because of the truck profile difference.

did a quick simulation with fusion and 2mm gives a Security Factor of 2.3, at 1400N dead center on the board, which is borderline imo. 4mm will probably do the trick.

New bolts, no torx anymore (we have some left, message me if you prefer them). Added benefits are a smaller head that fits better the countersink and that the lid can be emergency opened with a skate tool, no need to carry a TX20 with you.

Good news: 

It seems like they already started with the milling of the decks, **I will have the final confirmation tomorrow or Thursday**. This means that we'll probably be able to finish them on the Easter break and start shipping around the end of April / Beginning of may. 

(This is assuming we can laser cut the lids before the 19th) **

Also vacuum bag a thick skin of carbon to the bottom for more stiffness and mostly looks.

This time we could maximize the chamfer using longer milling bits (looks stealthyer). This, plus bigger inner channels means that we dropped 400g of weight even with the added ply. 1,64kg (kitchen scale...) 

Sadly the new 1,5mm lid will add some weight when compared to the 1,2mm original one. 1,2 material is rather exotic an almost nowhere in stock.

**Production update:** 
(we are running a bit behind schedule because of the shitty weather this week + making 60 instead of 30 also takes more time) 
- All decks received 2 varnish coats and a consecutive sanding of the interior
- We corrected the lid hole position to match the contour of the CNC'd holes and now we are waiting for them to be produced. Expected in 1-2 weeks according to our personal experience with them. Till then all the rest of the production steps should be finished.
- We epoxied the threaded inserts of almost all the decks (until we run out of inserts) 
- Sanding of the backside has started today, after that the decks will receive 3-4 varnish coats, the last one being a harder anti scratch bi-component acrylic polyurethane one. 
- I visited the metal polishing/finishing shop of the father on one of my friends and we decided to machine-sand all the lids to obtain a more professional looking finish
- After the lids are sanded we plan on applying a matte/satin protective automotive clear coat 
- We ordered stainless steel bolts (same type as the black ones) for those who want a all-metal raw finish of the lid. 

**Changes:** 

- In order to ease production, making the machine sanding of the lid possible and reducing the final price the **alu lid will cover the entire top surface**. We believe this will also help to water-proof even better since the lid covers the entirety of the top surface. **(will post pics soon)** 
- The trucks will be mounted beneath the lid. Accessing the internal components will remain easy. 
- We planed to sell the deck like a DIY kit but we decided against it. Some of the production steps such as epoxying the inserts and applying the gasket to the lid (no chance of error) can be a bit too tricky for the final builder. This means that we will rise the price of the deck form 150‚Ç¨ to 160‚Ç¨ (190‚Ç¨ for European customers because of 19% german TAX). We hope this is understandable considering the extra work.  
- All decks will have a silk screen printed logo (same as the last time) in dark-Gray (probably with a metallic accent mixed into the paint). If you don't want a logo please inform me as soon as possible. 

If you got any extra questions I will be happy to offer further assistance

Best, Mathias

Varies wildly depending on what all is done to it and materials selected. 

But, not cheap unfortunately.  You don't want to know how many hours went into this bad boy, lol.

But in the 175-250 range typically

[quote="RedBaron, post:1334, topic:68132"]
previous pictures showed the lid screws bending into the lid

If you torqued the truck lids too much, like I did, that could happen. Although it does not compromise the lid stability. Will not happen this time since the lid will be only bolted on with smaller M4 screws.

Actual status: 

Wood part is finished: All decks Have 4 (I believe, maybe 5) coats of varnish outside, and 2 inside. Logos were printed too. 

Only thing left to prepare are the lids, which we have sadly not received yet. Preparing them will be a matter of max 2-3 days since the sanding part is done by a machine and applying the protective varnish coat is done rather quick with a paint sprayer. 

My father is going to call the laser cutting company today to ask when exactly they will be finished. As soon as I hear form him I'll post it here.

@RedBaron @skatardude10 

I almost forgot to tell you, the **V2 truck recessed mounts are 2mm deeper than the original**: The thickness of the deck (in that exact point) is 12 mm.

You can pm him or post here for a short board I think. Standard size might be sold out.

Also, @bevilacqua, can you send me files for the short board so I can try to see if I'll need 240 or 260mm trucks to reduce 110mm bite?

The head itself of the screw is smaller (same lenght), it sinks deeper into the countersunk hole. 

Yeah V1 should be very simmilar, the lid is 0.3mm thinner but that should not matter that much

**BAD News**.... It seems like there were some layer bonding issues at least in an isolated issue of the HB92 (**V2**) deck, resulting in a cracked deck. The test samples I tried were as solid as the ones before, so I hope it was just bad luck and a gluing error of the guy that pressed the deck...

Eitherwise, please when you receive the deck bolt the lid on and try standing/riding/slightly jumping on it to test that it was not a batch-problem, which would be the worst case scenario for us :/ 

Best, Mathias

:raised_hand: It was me who had the deck crack :sob: 

On the + side @bevilacqua was super responsive, offered me options and resolved the issue very professionally and to my satisfaction.

Basically after admiring the deck for a few minutes I put some caliber II trucks on, put the lid back on and just before going outside to push it for a bit I stood on it to do a "pre-flight test", as soon as I shifted my weight a layer separated from the front all the way to 1/3 of the deck and then it cracked. It was very painful to hear that noise.

It shouldn't matter but I weight between 220 and 230lbs depending on the day. I hope it was just an isolated issue and that it works out for everyone else.

I initially just propped up some trucks under some risers to test. lol, I know just standing on the deck flat on the ground isn't going to stress the layers at all. Regardless, incase that wasn't clear thanks for the heads up. and... fuck I am sorry about your board BTW... :crossed_fingers::crossed_fingers:

I bolted some trucks on and took it for an analog ride a bit ago, same thing... board seems solid. Hopefully this is an isolated case and we don't see this happening much at all beyond this one time. I'd hate to hit a small crack and have that be the jolt that knocks layers loose, time will tell. 

Now I just need my TB-DDs and I can finally finish this thing :smiley: 

And, board feels great... very bouncy, rebound-y in a very stiff package. It's hard to describe, the only thing I can relate it to is a carbon fiber foamcore (3 ply maple top) speedboard I used to ride, though maybe a tad bit less flexy. Great work on the decks Mathias (and father!)

250lb, 6'7" beast reporting for duty.

Just got my deck today. I did some bounces on it, inching closer to the middle each time (but not anything crazy, didn't want to TRY to break it), and it seemed fine.

One question though: how are we expected to ride this? This isn't a skateboard, it's a piece of ART üòçüòçüòç

Serious question though: I've seen the risers, but has anyone already designed bumpers for this model? I would hate to damage the ends.

Good to hear. What size wheels you got on there? Any wheelbite  issues?
It looks like nothing but keep your eye on this also.

107mm flywheels... Wheel bite? Yes, With the Paris truck up front, and because it's relatively loose. I'm thinking that the TB-DDs when they come in will widen the trucks enough that wheel bite won't be an issue anymore, hopefully. 

About that small gap, even though I'm not worried, do you think a dab of super glue in there might be effective? I don't have any wood glue or anything. I might just leave it as is.

Such a dream to build in so far... Good I want to get this thing on the road! I am away from home, so no 3D printer means I'll have to hold off on custom risers and bumper pads and stuff. For now I'll just do my best to secure the parts that hang out (charge port, loop key) just to get riding. Maybe I'll pick up some sort of rubber lining to protect the nose and tail in the meantime.

I was trying to find my pms with Mathias but he told me the base plate mount was I think 2mm more recessed on the v2 and I do believe he told me to go with 3/4th inch risers or larger for the large 110 wheels. The TB trucks are a tad wider so that will help a little. I'm starting to lean CAD just to make all my esk8 ideas come to life so if I come up with something for the haya I'll share üòâ

Got my Haya built out, with temporary drivetrain for now just to get riding... single motor until the TB DDs arrive. It looks like I am going to have to do some shortening of wires when the DDs arrive, or cut the cap bank in half to fit everything I want in there.

At 55A load, the VTC5As only sag about 1-2v... so much better than my last 25r build, which would sag like 7-8v at least. 

First ride out I just had the focbox stuffed in there willy-nilly, and I noticed there were quite a few thermal throttling situations. When I got back, the bottom of the board where the focbox is was **HOT**. Also, noticed quite a bit of clacking inside the board... so back to the drawing board a bit it was.

Second run out, after padding up the batteries and other components, the clacking inside the board was eliminated.

Secondly, I flipped the focbox and applied some noctua thermal paste to the bottom of the focbox, and cut a square out of the lid's foam and cleaned up the adhesive with alcohol for a clean and smooth metal contact, with squishy foam underneath the focbox for a press fit between the focbox heatsink and the lid. This time I only noticed one thermal throttle after a long while of full load, and the focbox cools down really quick too! Thinking about adding some heatsinks to catch the wind on the top of the board, although I don't know if that will do any good since most of the lid except above the focbox doesn't seem all that hot. 

Either way, using the lid as a heatsink is working great for me... and when I get my second focbox in there, I anticipate no thermal throttling at 100A load, since the one only throttled at 57A battery load after a while of full throttle pushing up a hill.

Also, LOVING THIS BOARD! If I could make one change for a revision, it would be slightly more concave, increasing towards the edges. I might make some edge wedges to put under the griptape where my feet are at some point.

Sadly more, about 5. We think that it is due to the stacked pressingng of the decks in the heated mold. The ones in the center probaby did not get enough heat and the glue did not catalyse properly (more or less comfirmed by them). 

In addition they applied glue only to one side of the veneer (manually and not with a machine due to the veneer size), wich prob led to spots without glue.

Hi, 

as some of you might already know some of our HB92 decks have cracked/de-laminated. 
I have heard of 5 issues by now. Last week I visited my parents in Spain and we finally got to talk with the guys that press/cnc the decks  (emailing does not work very well with them).

-------------------------------

**Possible de-lamination causes:** 

- Stacked pressing of too many decks: 

The glue used in our decks catalyzes with heat when pressed in a heated metallic mold. The issue is that the decks stacked at the ends heat-up/harden much faster, thus preventing the heat propagation to the rest of the stacked decks in the center. They were in a hurry whilst producing them so they could not even confirm us how many they stacked. 

- Single sided gluing: 

By norm the veneers used in wooden pieces (they do a lot of furniture pieces) are glued in a machine, and the glue is applied on both sides. Our deck veneers are too big for the gluing machine, so they glue is applied by a worker manually, and apparently they applied it only to one side. This potentially may have caused spots without glue. 

- Design change **(Theory for now, not confirmed)**:

Lastly, it is possible that the design change weakened the strength of the deck to some extent: we widened the channels by 6mm and the outer chamfer angle was slightly steeper this time around, consequently leaving less wood to support the rider weight/abuse. The prototype sample I tested at home withstood my weight and hard jumping fine, but I weigh ~70kg. Jens (NoWind) has that deck right now, he told me that he intended to use brackets so we sent him the proto deck to be safer (he ordered one after we heard of the first cracked deck). I asked them to make me another sample just to be sure, I'll report back as soon as I get it. 

@NoWind have you tested the deck? with brackets too?  

-------------------------------

Future of HAYA:

I would like to openly apology, I am sincerely sorry for all V2 HB92 owners :pensive:. We do not know how many boards were affected, so we encourage you to test the strength and report back (we already sent an email after hearing of the first incident), don't be afraid and test it as hard as you want. Naturally all cracked decks will be refunded instantly. 

We try to be completely open and we are sure that something like this will not happen again. It is quite a hard hit for us, but we will try to learn from our (even if they are indirect) mistakes. 

We will not do any pre-order runs anymore, it creates stress, decisions get rushed and it potentially induces errors/mistakes. We will only sell decks when we have them in stock (if there is still a demand for them) and we will take our time to test each batch/design iteration properly. We'll also QC all decks from now on. 

Thanks for reading, If anything is still not clear please ask here or PM me. 

Best, Mathias 

------------------------------------------
-------------------------
-----------------------------------------
Note: HB83 decks are **not** affected by the gluing issue. Neither are V1 decks.

Anyone has a deck in the US, you can send it to me and I can reinforce it with CF, colored FG, or custom fabric.


This will increase the integrity.

Dont worry, that piece was glued afterwards manually.
It does not affect the structural integrity of the deck.

Its not glued perfecty because of the manual clamp force. If water or humidity gets in it can loosen the glue (just plain wood glue)

Its also the reason of why we used a full alu lid in the v2s

My personal deck had it and I think @Surfer s deck too...

It's sucks but Matthias has been incredibly professional about it. I think not okay isn't the right words.

He's literally giving money back and saying keep the deck, something that can be MADE to work after the fact if you want to. He's definitely lost money on this community project at this point for something out of his control. Don't take your anger out on him.

Not really sure what you're getting at there. My sweet summer child, if this is what you consider 'angry' perhaps you should get out a bit more. 

I think 'not okay' is putting it mildly when the failure rate is as high as it is (20-25% now?) and some of them haven't even been ridden yet I believe. 

I think being apprehensive to ride a board because you're concerned it might fall apart under your feet is not something one should have to deal with. Maybe you feel differently. 

Mattias has been very good with refunds I'm sure, still doesn't change the fact that the product is dodgy.

@bevilacqua Thanks for being an upstanding member and adressing issues right away. These circumstances are a bummer but dealing with a forthright, well intended human, that builds and sells awesome custom shit is refreshing. 

Last I checked this is a builders forum right, gentlemen?  Vendors and buyers on here should be aware of that. New products take time to check quality and durability. This forum (often) is beta testing for products prior to larger, more public runs as is evident by our understanding of problems occuring primarily in V2 runs. Anyone on here should understand this. 

Please can we not devolve to insults and keep these threads on track. I‚Äôm as guilty as anyone of getting worked up on occasion but its not productive. Lets focus on how to apply our DIY knowledge to fixing problems with these kick ass toys/tools we use.

@bevilacqua Can you possibly work out a group deal with @Sender to skin the decks instead of a refund? Mine creaks when I bounce on it but it hasn‚Äôt cracked...yet and I‚Äôm hesitant about how hard to bounce. I have a feeling once I hit something going 25mph, it‚Äôs going to spill guts. 

I‚Äôd rather have a functional deck than a broken one and a refund, so maybe this would be a win-win solution for everyone.

I believe @Sender leaves the truck mounting area clean but I imagine if you needed fiberglass there he might be able to do it. I don't think the actual decal skinning would work out there. This is before the epoxy skin coat with the design on my board. the design will cover everything in white.

I am 95% positive this is the failure point. 

![image|690x388](upload://dBL5l6mnv5MQ5U6BcpGS4wNqKYt.jpeg)

Delam-ing layers is not easy, unless its already started. I can easily delmainate down the rest of the deck now from whats delam'd. That small point is where it started, and it makes sense as that one spot taking the load from the trucks + rider weight + least amount of glue-able area will pop first and cascade into that entire layer delaming.

I feel like there is a possiblity this wouldn't have happened if this sharp point were rounded planar to the face the baseplate sits on. For example in CAD, adding a fillet to that hard edge bottom-most the deck that surrounds the baseplate cutout would do it. I wouldn't want to round the perpendicular edge closest to the center mass of the deck, only the two outer edges. Does that make sense? Dunno if i'm describing clearly. In 3D printing, warping happens from sharp corners- same concept here.

Here... something along the lines of this [purple lines]:

I'd definitely extend it into the cavity. It would make sense to do the cavity first in fiberglass then overlap it with the big piece into the cavity. With the trucks mounted and rider's weight, it would sandwich it all together.

But feel free to do it  gentlemen!  Every little bit helps.

And the FG is reinforcing that place to a degree as it is all the way to that point and wrapping. Everything white is fiberglassed.

I skinned an already broken deck. 1 layer of 350g/m2 GF with a vacuum bag that I stupidly punctured when trying to push some epoxy out... (quick n dirty work, about 60min...) I also epoxy coated the interior. 


I shot a quick video, will do more testing next week and I will transfer my daily to it. 

I was wearing 2 backpacks with about 30kg of weight, about 106kg or 233pounds. (maintaining balance was a bit tricky....)

Hi, I've been a week at home working with my father and I have some small updates. 

We are in the process of **skinning** the **remaining decks** that we have (about 5 of each model), 2 plies of 80g/m2 biaxial glass fibre. After skinning they are sanded and we plan to paint them with a 2k automotive paint (*RAL 9021 Grey* matte color) and add a lined logo in glossy black (still waiting for the paint, will post pics in some days)

We also met with the CNC guys and they agreed to make a **small batch of replacement decks (V2.1)**. I will modify the design a bit to ensure that even **if** they make a small mistake in production (which can happen) the board will remain structurally stable. Expected changes:  HB83 -> Internal width of the channels reduced from 91mm to 86mm // HB92-> IW 81mm to 79mm and a reduction in the chamfer angle. The finishing of this batch will be exactly like the one before, no glass fiber, natural wood with a multi layer of polyurethane varnish. They will be tested extensively before any replacement deck is sent. 



**Why are we doing this?** 

**->** We want to be able to offer **replacement decks if any other deck fails**. Those who need the original internal channel dimensions can receive a skinned deck and those who could use the slightly reduced space can use the V2.1 decks. 

-------------------------------------------------------

**Note:** it will take some time till we have 2.1 decks. These will be **only** replacement decks. 

I am sorry it took this long, as some of you might know I study in Germany, whist my parents are in Spain, where we produce the decks. Doing things via Skype and phone calls has its limitations among other problems, that's why I decided to stop making decks till I'm back home, which will take probably more than a year, maybe two. I'm still motivated, and passionate about esk8, I simply want to be involved directly in the process. 


Best, 

Mathias

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/haya-hb83-shortboard-progress/80337/193?u=bevilacqua

Did the same testing with a freshly pressed HB92 deck today. Held up very well. (the leverage was a tiny bit bigger because the deck was only bolted to the nose)

Like on the hb83 the V2.1 will have a slightly reduced inner channel to ensure the stability even more. I don't want to risk anything on any potential replacement deck.
