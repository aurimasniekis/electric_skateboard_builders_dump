This is a Set of Brand new never used Orangatang Caguama blue wheels with bearings. I got this about 2 weeks ago and was really looking to start using it but I need to pay rent payments. Kept for only two weeks since recent purchase in a smoke free home and adult owned. Please message me with any questions about the item. This item can be shipped out next day and is 100% as advertised in working order. Thanks for looking and god bless! :)![17%20PM|376x500](upload://ol0vCrv3gAEt8K6mOv8axzbdKPx.jpeg) ![22%20PM|378x500](upload://59NSAZ5cpgavNz4PXZGQYhTISPw.jpeg) ![26%20PM|373x500](upload://kKI1MbRc6cyrQwFCu1XrE57C0So.jpeg)

Yeah I would NEVER want a piece of metal and rubber to be in a smoke filled home or owned by children

Personally I think it's a nice touch from the seller. It's kind of icky when I purchase things that arrive at my doorstep smelling like stale cigarettes 

Then again I would giggle if it smells like pot smoke... Double standards I guess? ðŸ¤·

Looks like I may may have been ghosted by @Rdz990, paid for these wheels 24 days ago, been pm'ing them directly and through Venmo and no response for 21 days so far.

I knew I was taking a risk as they hadn't posted for 2 years, if anyone has any info on Rdz990 please send me a PM :slight_smile:




thanks!

3 weeks ago he apologized for the delay and said he's really busy so maybe that is the case,

i do like to hope for the best in us humans, we'll see
