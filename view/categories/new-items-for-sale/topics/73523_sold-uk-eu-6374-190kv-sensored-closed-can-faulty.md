Hi

These motors were damaged from shipping or they have manufacturing defects. None of these motors have been used.

One motor seems to spin freely and has little/no problems.

But the other motor has a chipped magnet.

There might be other things wrong with the motor with the chipped magnet. But the other one seems to be fine. 

I guess only buy this if you need spare parts or know how to fix stuff like this.

Please make an offer

Unless you pimp these motors to the max they will always have "little to no problems" at best.
