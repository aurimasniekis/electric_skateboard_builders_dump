I'm selling a Bell Super 2R Helmet.  It's a medium.  I took it out of the box, threw the box away and tried it on, but I've never ridden in the helmet, so it's new.  

It has a camera mount on the top and the jaw piece is easily removable.  Light weight.This is a really nice helmet, but I decided I want to pony up $$ and get a TSG Pass with visor.

$110 Comes with the cloth storage bag and I'll ship it to you free USPS, in the CONUS.  Let me know if interested.

Thanks!
