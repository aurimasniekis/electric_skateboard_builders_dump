I ordered a bunch of 10S battery equipment and have some left over parts after my last few sales. If anyone wants a custom 10S battery, let me know! I usually use 30Qs but I can do anything. There is a showcase of my work in this thread: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/us-30q-10s4p-for-399/61573/5?u=brando

A few quick quotes for 30Q packs. This includes eSwitch, percentage gauge, plugs, charger/port, and BMS.
10S3P: $329
10S4P: $399
