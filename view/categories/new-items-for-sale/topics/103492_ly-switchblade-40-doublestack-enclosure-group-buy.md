Hey guys!

Making this forum to start a group buy to get EboardsPeru to make a double stack enclosure for the LY switchblade 40"! Here's the link to the single stack

https://www.eboardsperu.com/product/landyachtz-switchblade-40-enclosure/

But I want a double stack. I reached out and Alan said that he would make a custom one if I can get to 5 buyers. If anyone is interested, sign up on the forum below and once we reach 5, we can get our enclosures!
