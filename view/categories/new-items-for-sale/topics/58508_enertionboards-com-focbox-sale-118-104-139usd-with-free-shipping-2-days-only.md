For everyone who doesn't get emails from Enertion, they are having a  [Focbox sale](http://www.enertionboards.com) with free shipping for 2 days.

For now you can also get an additional 8% off with coupon code: **XcStEg**
But I don't think that will last long before it gets removed.

Do you know where it ships from?

Don't fancy being suprised with import tax

$138 isn't much cheaper than the $155 I can get from @longhairedboy or @jlabs who ship incredibly fast (local, United States).

Unikboards seems to also be matching their sale price.

Unless things have changed, they ship from China.
My orders from Cyber Monday got delivered to me in Germany with no added import tax, so you might get lucky.

If you are fast and use the coupon code before it most likely gets removed, it takes the price down to $128USD with free shipping.

Both [BKB ](https://buildkitboards.com/collections/speed-controllers/products/focbox?variant=8114030575732) and [longhairedboy](https://longhairedboy.com/collections/all/products/focbox-electric-skateboard-motor-controller) have them for $155 and listed <del>as out of stock.</del> BKB has them as out of stock in the description but listed as available at the bottom of the page. 

[UNiKboards ](https://www.unikboards.com/en/boutique/focbox-motor-controller/) has them for ‚Ç¨139, when sale price with coupon is ‚Ç¨109 through Enertion.

Of course with anyone buying in the EU there is the chance that it will get VAT added on to it when imported, but you can also get lucky.

Just woke up and realized the sale was today. I changed the price down to $139. I also just got tracking info for my next batch of FOCBOX so I will most likely be the fastest to ship in the USA (compared to directly ordering from Enertion).

I just asked and they said that they label the package 140$
so unless you are REALLY lucky you will pay the fees

I've got too many focbox cases - 5, enough for 8 individual focboxes, but only 5 focboxes spare.

For me I'm going to sell off a couple of cases and get going on some H/W v6 or Unity when the time comes.

Useful post, wonder what the Unity will do to focbox pricing

They always say that in the chat. Everything I received from Enertion was crazy undervalued. Remotes were valued at $2 each and FOCBOX's at $35 I think.

Be careful guys. Chinese holidays are coming up, so delays will most likely too! I don't think shipping will be earlier then early August ; )

It's not, but if you don't need them right away and you want a few 8% plus free shipping plus 138 each, I just saved ~60 bucks with no effort

A backup or two is sane. I'm expecting the unity to retail around the ‚Ç¨200 mark for adoption purposes, then slightly higher and this price ^ to be the new focbox median but who knows

Yea that is because it is only ¬£104 without VAT, add on VAT and it makes it ¬£124 then another ¬£9 for shipping and your looking at a total of ¬£135 or ‚Ç¨153.

Everyone is talking about matching Enertion prices but ignore that they are also offering free shipping and currently have an additional 8% off voucher.
Making the total price ‚Ç¨108 | ¬£95.37 | $128USD shipped.

If I was looking to buy a focbox I would rather get it from Enertion directly and most likely avoid having to pay VAT.  Then even if it does get picked up you're still paying less or equal to what it is being sold in the EU for.

![VAT|344x500](upload://ApSmXywQEevHn4MYgRUyFKtUMQ3.png)

Thats with DHL taking there ‚Ç¨10 cut, so without that it is even cheaper and still less than whats being offered in the EU.

Grabbed one but not in stock till 25th - AUS Price was not great @ $202AU ($149.00US)
Tossing up between this and the similar priced Flipsky Ver 6.6 with built in antispark switch.
But better the devil I know..
Really hanging out for a UNITY for my next build.

I ordered two of them on a whim, and they arrived 6 days later from China via DHL. 

No letter in the post yet about import taxes, but you never know........

I suspect the flash sale going on might be to do with the Unity release (maybe)....
