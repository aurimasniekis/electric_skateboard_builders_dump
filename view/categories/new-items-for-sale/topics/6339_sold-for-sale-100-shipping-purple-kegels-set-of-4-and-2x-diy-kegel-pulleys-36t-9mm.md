Sorry, I think it'd be too hard to sell the other two so I'm only selling the Kegels as a set of 4. If you need them you should pick up the set so you have spares!

Yea, perhaps on my next build. I'm hoping for wider calibers to hit the market by then though. If only I could score an old boosted board to dissect..

This looks pretty nice :nerd:
The clearance on dual outboard looks really nice, perfect for jumping off sidewalks :head_bandage:

I was only planning on using these for a single drive but with the dual pulleys already on there i'm getting tempted to make it a daul 6355! on funbox 190mm rkp trucks. but really it will proabably be a single 6355 on calibers :thinking:
http://www.funboxdist.com/store/trucks/

I think they should fit since its only 9mm blets.

you can fit dual 6355s on calibers, just look at the raptor or torqurboards kits.
