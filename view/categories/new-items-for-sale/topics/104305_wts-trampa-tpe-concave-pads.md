I initially 3D-printed these TPE concave pads for my MTB but decided to head into another direction. I would like € 35 for them. Offers are welcomd aswell. Shipping with DHL tracked: in EU €10 euros Shipping outside of EU estimate of maximum € 22.

50% infill, 5 perimiters (2mm wall thickness) and 0.1500 layer height. 

They feel really great on a flat deck like a trampa board! And can even replace bindings. They can fit multiple decks because the pads are flexible and the TPE can be cut rather easily with a sharp knive or scissors. You can attach them with strong double sided flexible tape or glue them on.

Here are some examples from forum members:

50% infill, 5 perimiters (2mm wall thickness) and 0.1500 layer height. The 2mm wall thickness and 50% infill makes it near to solid but just so that its still a slight bit cushioning.
