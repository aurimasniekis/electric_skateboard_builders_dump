Here we have some deck protectors, I have sold a few to some close forum members but that's about it. Made a few extra to sell to the public :slight_smile:

#  $23/set Shipped Worldwide
### I can also provide the skateboard hardware for $1.50 / per set
##### You just need to specify the length of the bolt required, and the the colour of the bolt, natural or black

1 set = 4 pieces :rofl: @Andy87

Here girls, this is the start of a new trend in Esk8. @topcloud and I (@pixelsilva) are riding on the tip of the spear with this one! The carbon I-Things are all on my man, @moon :uk:

very rare, out of production deck called a Koastal Skillet.  Sickboards still has a couple.

This kit has all new Real Riptide green bushings on the way, a few more tricks.  Enlisting the mighty @bigben on a rounded Spud enclosure for it.

This is just a prototype of what I think a small Evolve should be with @riverside.rider's perfectly-sized wheels for SuperCarve.

FWIW, I think Evolve missed an opportunity when they passed on this size wheel for SuperCarve; it brings out everything good in the SuperCarve and hides a lot of bad.  I think with Freebord S2 bindings and the new bushings (I'm going max duro at the top to make it perform a bit more predictably) this little beast will be favored all Summer.

To protect valuable decks, these Moonbeams are /perfect/.  Unlike metal and plastic, carbon fiber Moonbeams will not stick to the deck - there's no creaking, no surface damage, no breaking, just works.

I'll take two more pair btw, my brother and thank you for making these.  Big fan!

The force is such with drop through mount like that that the force is spread from the nut to the underneath of the deck, this spreads the load

Looking good

You can do the other side but looks mostly

When I nearly just bought one I added more and more to the cart. They stopped letting me add them to the cart when i got to 20. Perhaps they have a few left? This might start a stampede?

that's crazy cool haha - perhaps Sick bought them all on some kind of insane sale where it made sense to ship them to the Netherlands.

Koastal changed hands, if memory serves, purely speculative yet could have been a liquidation.

Maybe we can get them all, put your enclosure with it and sell them as Evolve kits with Moonbeams, Bergmeisters and the like.  

An all-forum Kickstarter... how incredible would that be, an esk8 Kickstarter that actually delivered.

New Koastal is still around however so that could be good publicity for them, too.  who knows. :)

Any ideas. 1.5 inch is 38mm + 2mm~ for the moonbeam. So 40mm?

1", 1.5", 2" are safe choices :)

The skillet is a bit thin, so I selected 1" Shorty bolts that fit perfectly into the Evolve baseplate, above.

The 13S SuperEvo that I briefly owned, with the monster risers and underbelly enclosure, would require 2".

I got M5 hex flat bolthead 40mm but they turned out a little too large so I grind them down to 30mm (1,25 inches). Here you can compare against the standard Evolve truck mount plate 27mm (1,12 inch) M5 hex countersunk bolthead.
