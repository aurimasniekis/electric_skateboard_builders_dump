Brand new arbor longboard highground 36 gt icon

I bought it for a build but the concave was not what I expected.  This is a downhill board, I wanted a beach cruiser.

$60 OBO .. Free shipping to USA.

Have you ridden it dude? I have one and love it!
With my foot across the deck the "W" pushes in to my arch giving me good control, & when I tuck, I point my foot more down the deck it gives me a more level platform for my rear foot. The little rear flare is perfectly placed too. 1st day I got mine it even felt good to carpet skate so...
Add a RipTide inside foot stop and it's a :peach: :

either way...

$60 is a deal for someone stateside shipped if you can't get along with it. :thinking:

Thanks for the tips; I already got a replacement.  Maybe I wouldn't gotten used to it, but the concave was just too much.  I think downhillers have a more parallel foot position .. then it is super comfy.
