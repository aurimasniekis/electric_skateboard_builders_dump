Hallo

It does  not fit the enclosure. It only tested on pc to check if it Works. So that is why the USB cutout.

You do realize your photos say that it has been used? The hear shrink has been cut for the usb and just connections. It also appears the jst connections have been broke in spots. And one of them looks as if it has a burn mark... Brand new never used means brand new never used.
