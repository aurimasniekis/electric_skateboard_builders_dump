I had a similar clamp on design like your mount.
Problem here is the screw facing the street:
![f70b41ec70fce8d3eaf60bad0cd31abf71b8e13c_1_690x459|690x459](upload://addTqh3S7rlOavNw0Rj3wEwQbSI.jpg)

**Keep it as narrow on the trucks as possible** - best way is to have it facing parallel to the street!
YouÂ´ll be hitting rocks and other stuff and this will wear down in under 500km.
Worst case, you face the street because you catched something big - happened to me with this.

You can face the bolt the other way to gain some clearance. The mount itself is already narrow so by proportion it looks crazy stuck out.

Now that I realized it, the bolts are on the wrong way in my picture. I'll fix later

Unsure. They fit perfectly on standard calibers. You would have to do a little filing. The "pro" is that since it's a 2 piece set, you only have to file a portion of the hanger, not the whole thing to slide a 1 piece clamp on in comparison.

going to order a pair. 

what belt length would you recommend?

15/36 or 15/40 pulleys, I'd like to source belts that'd work for both
```

---
## \#18 Posted by: Boardnamics Posted at: 2018-03-18T20:37:52.935Z Reads: 316

```
For the idler setup, the 2 belts I include, 320mm and 325mm will cover this ratios. If you are using big 107mm wheels though it might pose an issue as it blocks the idler.

320mm is good for 36t pulleys, 325mm is for 40t.

If you want to source your own 15mm ones then yeah hope that helps. Thanks

## \#20 Posted by: Boardnamics Posted at: 2018-03-18T23:24:48.309Z Reads: 305

The idler mount comes with 1x 320mm and 1x 325mm both 12mm wide for free.

If you want to order the extra belts I will include them, otherwise I will cancel the belt order.

---
## \#23 Posted by: Boardnamics Posted at: 2018-03-19T01:03:24.717Z Reads: 275

It does, but it has a much less acceptable range. On 40t pulleys, 325mm will work for 14-15-16 wheel pulleys. For uncommon ratios I will calculate for you.

Non idler works fine

Will this mount work with these 113 mm offroad wheels?

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0772K3KRX/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Also is this one long enough to mount in back of the board?  Also called reverse mount I believe, where the motor is mounted behind the truck instead of between both trucks.  I have a drop down deck where the motor wont fit between the trucks.
```

Hmm never seen those wheels before. With the idler I am going to go with no just because those wheels are huge in diameter and also wide which will likely block the idler. The non idler version should work though because wheel size isn't an issue. All my mounts can be reverse mounted.

Idler would have to be around $20 because it includes more hardware and 2 belts.
