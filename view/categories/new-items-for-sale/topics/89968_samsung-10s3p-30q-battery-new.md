Hello!

I am selling a new Samsung 30Q 10s3p battery with a built-in 10s60A bms. 

The battery is designed for an electric longboard.

I built it so that it is flexible, which means that you can build it under a flexible deck!

With this battery you have about a range of 25-30km. (single drive)

The xt90 plug serves as output.

What the xt60 is meant for loading. 

If you have any questions, please pm me. 

I can ship

Price of the battery: 199‚Ç¨. 

Greetings. ![IMG_20190409_191305|666x499](upload://pD8yCOvWXvvqiGD2ItmE67mnvH9.jpeg)

Anyway, do you have any close up shots of the weld points? I'm no expert but I know others on this forum are and could probably tell if it's a good weld job or not.

It's in the used parts section I think, maybe edit and move to the new section if truly new & unused?

Not sure if you used it once or twice to measure range or if the range is just estimated.

What are the dimensions of the battery pack? It looks small enough to fit in place of my 12s2p battery with spacers, so I might buy it from you in a month or whenever I get money :upside_down_face: No promises tho

I think:
200‚Ç¨ is a good price for 10s3p.
For all parts i had to pay: 100‚Ç¨ for the cells, 80‚Ç¨ for the bms, and about 20‚Ç¨ for wires connectors, nickel strips and the heat shrinking. (and maybe 20‚Ç¨ shipping for all the parts). 
I just wanted to calculate this for you guys, because I don't wanna have that feeling that anyone thinks that the battery is to expensive.

Nah mate, others have already chimed in that this is a very good price for such a battery. Just need to wait, because lowering the price will just end up with someone buying it and selling it again at a higher price lol
