Hey guys.. its that time of year again where I sell things I dont much need for things I do need. 

Don’t be afraid to make offers. I just want $$


1)  SOLD @never4getf150forums  **DIY BOARD - $400 shipped in the US ONLY**
The deck is a Vanguard by loaded skinned with real carbon fiber. (Some spots need some work after my latest battery swap) 
Running off of a Vesc-x (Former Focbox) 
SK3 style 6384 motor with Sensors 
97mm abec flywheels
15mm belt system, steel motor pulley with keyway and Aluminum Wheel pulley  I believe 15: 40 
Goldenhusky Antispark switch 
40 amp fuse 
Enertion mount
TB Extended trucks
Ceramic bearings
GT2B mastercho mod remote
XLR charging port, LCD display
**BATTERY**: Current battery installed is from a boosted board. It works fine but with the boosted battery installed, you cant use the XLR charge port and the LCD isnt accurate. You will need to use a boosted charger which is not included. **I would recommend building a new 10 or 12s lithium ion battery for this build.  New battery plugs in and everything works as god intended again**.  IF YOU NEED A PLUG AND PLAY 10S Battery shoot me a PM.

So it only needs new battery and battery connections?

Or the boosted charger.

It works just as it is you’ll just need a boosted charger (I just put the boosted pack on it for shits and giggles) 

Or

You can install a different battery on it and use the xlr charge port and display. (What I would do if I cared to)

I have got a question about your build. You say you skinned your vanguard in carbon fiber. What do you really mean with that. Did you use carbon fiber vinyl or how how does that 'skinning 'work don`t know that term? I am thinking about wrapping my vanguard in vinyl but i am afraid it won`t stretch and rip appart. Will it rip appart if i wrap it in vinyl with the flex off the board? A bit off topic but I am interested in how you did it :) .
