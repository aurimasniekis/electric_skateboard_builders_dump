Hi,

I just purchased and received 2 of the Torqueboard VESCs collections/esc-speed-controller/products/torque-esc-bldc-electronic-speed-controller

they just arrived last week and they are completely new, haven't been opened. I decided to upgrade to a more expensive VESC so I have to sell these. 

Asking for $180 for both of them. Rather sell locally or ship to US or Canada

I'm in Toronto, Canada but should be easy to ship to the US and I would ship within a day or the same day.

Cheers.

@Trdolan03 At this point I'm willing to sell them slightly bellow cost, let's say $90 each.

They are actually better than their reputation
Consider keeping them

I don't think I can ship to Australia and make this worth it, looked it up just now and it's too expensive. Sorry.
