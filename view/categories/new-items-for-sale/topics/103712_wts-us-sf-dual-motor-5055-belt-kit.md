Brand new, never used dual motor belt kit with 5055 motors rated at 270KV. Located in SF

Got these for a build that I never completed. Wound up going in a different direction, so Iâ€™m putting them up for sale.

* 5055 270KV motors
* 83mm Flywheel style wheels
* 35T wheel pulleys
* 13T motor pulleys
* 10" trucks

These are the components used on the Riptide boards. Make me an offer! I can ship but prefer a local sale to someone in the Bay Area.

Those are the same as the DIYE ones so I wouldnâ€™t trust them very much, but if youâ€™d ship them across to the East Coast for $75 I got a longboard that could do with an upgrade

Will do, thank you again for your interest! I'm in no rush to sell and will likely keep this for a badass second build as a daily rider or commuter board. 

If anyone does have interest in purchasing this (for a reasonable amount lol) just shoot me a PM. Hopefully this can help someone out. Cheers!
