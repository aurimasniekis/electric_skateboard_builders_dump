This current enclosure is 3/16” ABS plastic  and was designed with the landyachtz evo deck in mind but may be used on other decks depending on your decks measurements. I'm currently personally using this enclosure on my board with a 12s5p battery. The back cable exit notches and the side drop notches can be removed and the enclosure can be ordered flat all the around. It is also recommended to use a rubber seal. These rubber weather strips can be purchased at your local menards, home depot, etc.. or I can included one for additional $10

Measurements
inside 7 1/4 x 21 3/4 inches
outside 8 1/2 x  23 1/2 inches
Depth 1 1/4 inches 

Price with out shipping
$65 regular w/ or w/o the notches
$70 with the stars
Other designs coming soon.. possible custom orders available (message me)
$10 for the rubber weather strip seal

Your order will ship out from Milwaukee, WI same or next business day priority with tracking in the US for $10

Payments done via PayPal, please message me for an order

Sorry but all purchases are final no returns

$65 is a good price.   I wish you were selling your enclosures a few months back.  Looks great.  Good luck.

I agree learning to make something is the best part of diy. What i build?   Well. I have a loaded pintail dual hub, a loaded deck dual belt drive and a sector 9 single drive.  Like you I chose to make my own enclosures because I could never settle on one design.   I made some kydex enclosures with a vacuum box.
