I bought 3 extra BesTech 15A BMSs awhile back and I'm selling the extras.  I work from home so I can have them shipped the same day you make the purchase.  The cost is $45 shipped anywhere in the US so I'm not making much profit at all after the cost of shipping from China, I just want to get rid of them since I'm not using them. Just message me to buy one.

Data sheet can be found at the following link.  Let me know if you need help figuring out how to wire it up.

That's because it's a charge only BMS. If you want higher amps for discharge too get one with an e-switch.

Yep! Just PayPal me $45 with friends and family and I can send it out tomorrow. ($45 assuming you are in the US, if you are international I have to see how much shipping will be.) My email is morgankuphal@gmail.com. Also message me your shipping address.

```
Yes. $45 each that is, but since you are buying two I can take $5 off since I only have to pay for shipping once. So $85 total.
