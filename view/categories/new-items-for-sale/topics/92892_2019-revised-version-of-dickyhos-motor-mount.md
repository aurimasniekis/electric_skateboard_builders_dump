Thanks, don't need other measurements.

I think the 18.9mm one can fit my insert. (might need file a litttle on the inner side of the insert, or open up a little bit)

the 16mm one can not fit.

I had thought of something similar but it requires two bearings X_X.

Couldn't get the overall length down below 21mm DX.

yes, that is a problem. to install bearing on a aluminum piece, if tight fit will be difficult to take the bearing out, if not tight fit will be  very loose.  not like on plastic, plastic is soft.

you might try to burn it,  then take the bearing out while it still hot.   then polishing the bore a little with sand paper,before install new bearings.

I am currently having this problem. With skinny wheel pulleys, the idlers contact the wheels. Having the bolt indented in the idler will solve this. Cheers Dicky for making good quality stuff!

It doesn't really fit well on tb218 trucks. After a lot of filling I was able to pound the adapter onto the hanger, but since it's stretched it doesn't fit in the mount's hole now. How far can I safely stretch it before it breaks?

Just for full transparency purposes I got the tracking number today and it says "Label Created on 05/20/2019", so doesn't look like it was sent on Friday. Maybe you are thinking of another order?

Either way no worries, once it's shipped it will come fast.

Yes I built my girlfriend a board with this kit. Hasn't broke yet. Seems fine to me. I ride it sometimes and I weigh 190lbs if that helps and I have taken it to 28mph which is her top speed with a 4:1 ratio.

I suppose you could use a different round profile Paris truck, but I would try it with the stock setup first.

Hey dickyho, any chance I could get an estimate of belt sizes to be used with your motor mount?  I have 255,265,330,335,340 and my current mounts don't fit any of them (FFS) and I would like to use some of them preferably.

Try this, make sure you have the right belt type (metric, 5m), pulley ratio (36:15), and center to center (Dicky's eBay page has the center to center listed)

15:36T on the standard caliber mount should fit 295mm, not sure if that is with idlers or not though
```

The short mount should be 290mm, the long mount should be 325mm...if you want to use idlers it's like 5mm more per idler

some dues noted me that they motors got scratch, ask me to make motor guard for my mounts.  did the design today.   humbly ask  opinions of this design here.  

the design is not peculiarly good, but made of laser cut, will have good price.  

now  I still have doubt.  1. still not designed pulley cover for it.  2.  many screws need to twist, not sure if easy or difficult to place the spanner in.

brilliant, Thanks!   So this is design version 2.   much simpler.   the down side is, every one using differ length bars,  very difficult for me to sell.

yes, those adjustalble bars can work.  they only can adjust a few mm,  So I need to know exactly how length bars buyer need. but in many case they do not know how length the bars shall be....

Just make two sizes dual 6355 motor
And dual 6374 motor
U can also make a specific set for ur model trucks and one for Paris/Caliber 184mm
Single motor fits any of those.

I'm looking forward to this caged mount version getting released. I'm looking at purchasing Paris style double kingpin trucks (https://www.dhgate.com/product/1year-warranty-9-25inch-double-floor-longboard/480080614.html#seo=WAP
). I was wondering how to figure out where on the truck to place the mounts? Its kind of a silly question, but I was wondering how you know if the trucks aren’t too far to the right or left.
