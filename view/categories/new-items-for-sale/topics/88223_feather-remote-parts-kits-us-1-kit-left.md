I’m going to be selling some parts kits for the Feather remote created by and with the blessing of @StefanMe. This is a well designed and feature packed remote. 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/featherremote-and-smartremote-files-in-post-577/74084

My parts kits will include fully assembled remote pcb, the assemble pcb receiver, misc such as bearings, throttle spring, hardware, cables, and with the option of the extension board led light controller. End user will only need to provide the 3D printed shell and battery. Links can be found in the thread linked above and/or I will provide. 

I’m going to start off with a small batch as I have some assembled already with just a few parts left due to arrive in the next few days. Based on interest I can have more made in a couple of weeks. 
$130 shipped within the US , + $15 for the optional extension board. Payment by PayPal, buyer responsible for PayPal fees please. 
First come, first serve. Please post interest here or PM for details and availability. Thanks !

That’s a pretty steep price. Maybe more understandable if it’s a finished remote. I’d prob pay $130 for the finished remote but in that state most people would have to spend at least $20 more finishing it.

The shell isn't expensive and if I remember correctly Stefan was selling for 160 euro, I think 130 USD is acceptable for the most desireable part of the system

I personally thought $160 for this remote, regardless of how cool it is, is quite overpriced. Even $110 or $130 is a lot but is understandable given the complexity of the remote.

The price is just that high, because of the quite expensive Feather Modules from adafruit.

I have to pay 60€ just for the two feathers. Batteries, OLEDs, bearings, print parts(filament ect.), PCBs, Software,.... puh... 160€ is not that much. And then there is nothing assambled. 

Defeonitly 160€ is a lot of Money, but believe me... it’s a lot of work for me. Specially the testing and research.

If there is enough interest i'l get another color.

Not that I think this going to actually apply to you because really who is going to come after you the FCC? but just wanted to put it out there:

https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?t=113747

https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/398

Long story short you can build 5 devices for testing etc. and still be in the clear but beyond that it starts to get fuzzy, it seems the more kit like they are and less of a complete ready to go product the better off you are legally (again I doubt if this would get brought up unless you start making 100s, but something to be aware of)

Something that should be known are the connection issues with the current version, if you read the Feather Remote Thread you will see several reports of disconnects. Pretty critical info given how dangerous remote failures can be.

I want to build one myself but can't trust my life to it at the current stage.
```

True there are some with disconnect issues. From what I can tell they seem to be isolated to large metropolitan cities such as San Francisco. I’ve yet to have an issue with mine. The estop function is supposed to kick in upon a disconnect which gradually slows the board down vs a traditional hard stop. I’ve tested this with mine by shutting off the remote without issue. I’m testing a small patch antenna which should further boost the connection.

sadface and PSA for other noobs like me.

Assembling the remote now (@PickSix24 @StefanMe the kit is awesome for assembly). The amazon lipo is wired backwards. I smell the magic smoke. Remote still powers up but the charge LED does not come on. Lots of fun coming up for me. I guess I can buy another feather, or start googling for repair.
```

what do you mean its wired backwards? the + and - is flipped?
```

---
## \#58 Posted by: deucesdown Posted at: 2019-04-21T02:34:35.502Z Reads: 88

```
Yup. + and - flipped. The funny thing is, https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-radio-with-rfm69-packet-radio/pinouts isn't super helpful, the image of the lipo connector is flipped. I toned out the BAT and GND pins after breathing the smoke and confirmed. Flipped the lipo pins, and remote powers up.

I found the charge controller chip, 50 cents, can get it free overnight shipping from arrow.com. It looks challenging to remove the feather from the pcb. Lotta pins there. :) And if it's not just the chip, I've got a lot to learn to debug this.

The only problem I had on mine was the trigger button. It was too big when I use double side tape. I ended up shaving that area on the remote and not use any tape since it stays put when you close and screw everything in.

Sorry to hear that. The feather board is $25 and if you have a desoldering vacuum it’s not too bad. I’ve done it before with a cheap plunger style from amazon. I can also perform the repair for you if you’re interested.

Thanks that's really nice of you to offer. I don't think I'll have any trouble replacing the chip, but separating the feather from the pcb looks like a pain. I'll google to see if there's an easy trick. If my repair attempts fail I'll hit you up.

I've watched a lot of louis rossmann board reuair videos, and have a stereo microscope and everything.

I used the desoldering tool to remove a faulty feather. Basically I used the soldering iron to heat each pin and while the solder is hot, pull the header pin with tweezers. They pull right out. Repeat x 18 or so lol. Once all the pins are out you can remove the feather and then use the desoldering pump on each pcb pinhole to remove the excess.
```

## \#64 Posted by: deucesdown Posted at: 2019-04-21T04:07:02.719Z Reads: 73

Awesome. That was plan A. Plan B was cutting each pin through the plastic, then desoldering the pins. I have the header pins already. I have the solder sucker, but I also have lots of flux (don't delay buy today) and desoldering braid.

It's nice that the feather is open source HW. The schematics and all are available.

## \#65 Posted by: StefanMe Posted at: 2019-04-21T08:08:25.402Z Reads: 75

This is the way to go... my Procedure:

vacuuum the solder on one side, heat up the pin pin with 400C quickly and pull out the pin with small tweezers, vacuum pump the solder from the holes... 

Shit work but the best I can recommend!
