I think I just responded to you on fb. But this post gives more info. Lol. If you rotate your hanger to the street position you’ll get more height on the back

Perhaps =p I may have just responded there also wasn't aware by rotating the hanger I could get more ground clearance. But I already have 200mm Mbs whells on and they are a pain to change since I don't have all the right tools to work with making it a tiresum process. Mistakes were made. But if I can't sell em I might give it a go. Might even try getting risers perhaps too.

It’s actually really easy. You just unscrew the springs on the bottom and pull out the pin in the center that holds the two parts of the truck assembly together.
