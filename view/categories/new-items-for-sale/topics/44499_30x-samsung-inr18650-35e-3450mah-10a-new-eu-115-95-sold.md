Hi,

I ordered 27th December 2017 30x cells for my new battery pack at [nkon.nl](https://www.nkon.nl/samsung-inr18650-35e.html) but now my esk8 built is slightly changing. So I made the decision to sell them. Cells are untouched still in the box .

I will add pictures tonight. Also have the invoice from nkon.nl.

Price: 95,- ex shipping from EU (the netherlands) / â‚¬ 3.16 per cell
