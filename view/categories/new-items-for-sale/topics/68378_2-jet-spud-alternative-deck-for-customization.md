I have 2 blank deck that are waiting for someone to love them enough that they want a custom design on them. Both are 8 inches wide and a wheelbase of 14 inches.  One is 30.5 inches in length and the other is 28 inches. And both decks have kicktails.

Both decks are 7 plys of American hard rock maple. Both are $150 with shipping included to the lower 48 states and whatever design you would like on your deck. 
Here is the 30.5 inch deck ![image|374x500](upload://nLOOaS7toWpbdcJImvaEwSxmbqo.jpeg)

Here is the 28 inch deck ![image|374x500](upload://7xKxLQJD6qYICf0uCPscf08q5R0.jpeg)
