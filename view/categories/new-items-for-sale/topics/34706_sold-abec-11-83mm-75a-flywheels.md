I have a backup pair of new 83mm Flywheels. I'll be selling them $65 shipped CONUS. Also willing to trade them for 90mm Flywheels. If they're new, I'll add $10-15, and if they're used, I'd prefer them to be in decent condition.

that's a really good price $65 shipped.

You might want to re-word the post though cuz it sounds like you want new 90s and $10-$15 for trade.

Ah man I wish I had money for these right now.  That 75a would be so nice compared to my DIYelectric clone wheels.  Best of luck selling :stuck_out_tongue:  Great price too

Very good deal. I have the money, but I live in Europe. Can you make an exception for this time? :heart_eyes:
