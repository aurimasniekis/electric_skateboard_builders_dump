What's up everyone

I'm selling some spare parts that I have lying around, they are all brand new, I'll be selling them at discount price from the price that I got from the original settlers, and will charge shipping at cost. Prices are shown per unit.

**UPDATED PRICES BELLOW!**

There are few pictures on a shared folder on my google drive:

@vitormhenrique Is it ready (as in Plug-and-play)? Also, does it come with the Nyko kama receiver?

 I never used on my e-sk8, it should be plug and play, there is a [calibration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OMyipDXwUIevf9hT1LSHdhx5EEQ6rP9OY-iQ6avuLok/edit) routine on wiiceiver website. It does come with a Black Nyko Kama.

The only thing that I did is test it with my oscilloscope to ensure that it was working (outputting ppm signal)
