They are **new**. I'm trying to get a better discount but so far it is small. The flywheels are so desirable right now they can't keep em in stock. 
They said a new batch is 5 weeks out if you want to wait for perfection but I would consider placing an order with someone before they are in stock.
Anyways they told me 10 percent off and they msrp at 82...so I can get them at 74ish. Plus they are ready now. I have to pay for shipping to me (interstate) and then to you CA to ?.
I will confirm the price tomorrow when I get the pictures. Might give me some bargaining power if they are noticeably discolored.

My 90mm 75A Flywheels are almost at decade old at this point, with thousands of (pushed) miles on them!  If you rotate them properly, these wheels will practically last forever

I might be interested in another set, depending on the price and condition

There is an update. Getting a price tomorrow. They sent the email of the picture to the wrong email. I worked it out with them today. The "discoloring" looks uniform and I can't tell a difference. Maybe a little lighter and yellower? But they look fine so I asked for a price. They said they would need to check with someone and I'll get the price tomorrow.  I also asked when their next batch of flywheels would be ready. They told me they should begin shipping them out at the end of January. Here is a pic of the "discolored" ones. Can you see a difference?<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/4/043ba76f460d0bbfcfb98ed015aacffbe4103369.jpg" width="690" height="388">

And here is an example new flywheels.

I found out today that they have **20 sets of unicorns available!** ...Minus a coupe sets for me. **SO 18 left for y'all**
 I will also save $ by picking them up directly. So you only pay the shipping from me to you.

$70  + shipping from Riverside,Ca. 92507.  ********Price change edit

I need to research shipping. Flat rate USPS might be a good choice? Or UPS.

The word is, Chris from Abec is a stickler for quality and these are not his trademark bright green but a darker green. So he stuffed 'em away.Urethane quality is still top notch. Color is darker.

I want to be clear with you guys that I am making a little commission on these wheels for my troubles. I am remembering Jlabs taking some heat for not making that clear on his buy. I hope that is understandable. If anyone who has already paid  needs to change anything just PM me otherwise Ride on!

@Schulerbible USPS is 35 USD but enertion used DHL to get a box to me so maybe they are cheaper.

Unbelievably shitty news today. 
"Hi Sean,
I was out of the office for the two weeks.  My sales manager sold the wheels to an account.
Sorry,"

She told me the wheels were sitting in the warehouse for over 3 years and no one could buy them. They were not selling them.  She told me that they would definitely not be going anywhere and then her Sales Manager apparently f@#$!n sold them to some account in the Netherlands while she was out of the office. I was specifically told they were going nowhere and I asked for them to hold them. She told me flat out they were not going anywhere. Then every single set gets sold to someone else. I am livid with Abec11.

They told me I can have a discount (which wont be big enough to mend my broken heart) in February when they are back in stock but the situation is complete s#!t.
I can not believe this. Sorry to all those who are going to be disappointed. I did all I could.

well since I negotiated for a cash discount, I have cashed the paypal monies and need to redeposit. For people who gifted money I will just Gift the money back tomorrow evening. For those who used paypals coverage I am not sure. I'd prefer to stay clean in the paypal claim  department so allow me to email them today and ask how I can refund your money including the paypal fee.

Looks like I can easily refund you guys. For every transaction that I refund which was covered by the paypal coverage, Paypal keeps 30 cents for its services. Just wait till tomorrow till I get the money back in to PP. BOOOOOOOOOOO Abec 11 Right now.
