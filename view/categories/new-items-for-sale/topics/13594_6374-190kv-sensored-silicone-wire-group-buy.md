Hello everyone. I have spoken to maytec. The manufacturers of the 6374 motors and asked about a group buy. I was planning on buying one myself and wanted to know if anyone wanted one. 

SPECS
190kv
6374
Silicone wire
Hall sensor 
5.5mm bullet connectors (probably able to change)

Price for 10 is 100 USD each (not including shipping) if people are intersted then I will final price.

Yes I believe so. Not sure on the price tho. Would depend on how many are bought. For 6355 I believe they also have un sensored in stock (not sealed tho) @IDVert3X

I prefer sensored motors and seal is just an added value. Im just scared a bit of overheating when its completely sealed.

Yeah basically, except I sell them for $79 and they will be in stock next week. But I wont post a link because it miraculously gets flagged off topic. I said in the last topic that custom manufacturing was expensive. Even $100 a piece is a total rip off.
