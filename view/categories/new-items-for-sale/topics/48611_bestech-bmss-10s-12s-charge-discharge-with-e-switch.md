I have x6 10s & x6 12s  BesTech BMS(s) on the way,the order was confirmed and paid this morning.  I will be keeping 2 of each, and have given 1st refusal to a couple of local guys, so I wont know the exact quantity until this weekend, but I think I will have 3 of each to sell.  US only, 1st come, 1st served.

If you want one they are $58 each shipped.  This is me making NO (as in 0) profit.  The BMS cost is $40 & $41, shipping is $44.00, PayPal fee is $26.80, shipping from me to you is $7 (tracked priority mail) and 3% PayPal fees from your payment to me.  I do not have an ETA on deliver as of yet, but I will by next week.  I doubt it will take over 2 weeks for them to arrive.

If you send F&F I will refund it.  This is the 1st time I've sold anything other than used stuff, so I don't really want any issues.  If you want in, send me a PM with your email address, shipping address,  model & quantity and I will send you a PayPal invoice.

Thanks for doing this. These BMS charge to 4.20v/cell, not adjustable, right?

It's interesting, the 10s has 84mA balance current, 12s has 42mA.

The 12 actually has 84mA balance current as well, it as a mistake on the spec sheet.  Ill update the post and the list today, let everyone know what the ETA is.

The BMS's shipped 03/26, I should have them in my hands in a week or so.  Im guessing 04/05 at the latest.  I have a list with all of the people that wanted a BMS.  The list is essentially full with a lot of people on standby in case people drop out.  

I will PM everyone on the list when I get the delivery to make sure you still want in, then I will send a PayPal invoice.  I will be ready to ship out the day after I receive them.

The BMS's are here.  I will PM'ing everyone on the list today.  If I don't hear back in 72 hours I'm going to start going down the standby list, so pay attention to your PM's.

I have PM'd everyone on the list.  I am still waiting on PayPal email addresses from a couple of you so please get that to me as quickly as possible so I can invoice everyone at once.

Once payment is made I will ship out the BMS, Spec Sheet, Balance Connectors and some other info via Priority Mail 2-Day.  The per piece cost is $46.90 each + $7.20 Shipping = $54.10.  The Paypal Fee is on that amount is $1.87, bringing the total to $55.97 each shipped.  This is me making absolutely no profit, even losing a little bit so please don't haggle.

I'll let you guys on the standby list know if any slots become available on a 1st come 1st served basis.  I should know in the next couple of days.

Are these for li-ion or lipo? Maybe we could take all 3 to EU because I'm also interested!

Nevermind, I just saw the datasheet. Can you please explain how the over charge detection and over charge release defer? BMS's I previously bought were set to 4.25V, is 4.3V not too high?

Easy, its protection against regenerative breaking causing shutdown and allows for a more accurate balance.  It only allows the 4.3 detection on 30% total.  If more than 30% show above 4.2 it shuts down.
