Yeah so sharp!! dude. This picture of from a post of mmaner, I used this picture as is from the same supplier just different group buy. As I mention I don't have the battery yet since Ajay didn't ship them. I can't wait anymore because I'm leaving the country for Holliday's and probably without my new toy. Btw the motors did arrive this morning, such a beautiful chunk. Thanks a lot Jared.
