@treenutter can you please remove that post

@dickyho the top image is of a swastika, and while I know the origins and am sure you were not intending offence, in most western countries the swastika is a symbol of racism and hate. 
Can you please repost without the first image

I totally get that, I have spent a lot of time in Asia and India where the swastika is commonly used and anything but the symbol of hate that the Nazi's used it  for.

If I had thought you were a Nazi there would have been a very different response :slight_smile:

My friend's mum has a swastika sticker on her car, but they live in Delhi and she is definitely not a nazi sympathiser :joy:

It's one of the many culture shocks us westerners come across when travelling

of cause I can do that, can arrange in next production.  just stainless steel cutting is quite expensive for small quantity. X could not sell higher price,  but the cost is the same as other design.....

Hey @dickyho your ebay description should mention if these are new school or old school bolt hole standard? I mean just list the dimensions of the hole spacing. 

Or someone will buy and then wont fit and they will be really bummed out.
