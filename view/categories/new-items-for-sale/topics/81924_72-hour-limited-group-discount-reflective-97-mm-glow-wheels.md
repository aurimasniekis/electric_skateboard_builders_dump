Im happy with the current size seeing my work board is a shorter deck and im impartial when it comes to cores, but i have way more abec pullys so i tend to lean that way. 
 A wide 100mm+ version would be awesome in the future @LazyRolling

**Super cool product !**
Thanks for your amazing work Mr. D & R !! (don't read Development and research :smile:) 

Just, hope the same as you guys (kegel and +100mm), or when my 107 will last... but it will take time.

More will come in the future, but this is the most popular size for torque and range, so it was natural to begin with that :) 

Its also nice not to be hit by cars :D

Do you have jackets with reflective materials? Then you would be noticed for sure

South Beach Miami? I ride there quite often.

I just ordered a set of wheels I need wheels for my new build and this seemed like a good fit. I like 107s alot but I also like my 90s so feel like 97s would be a nice fit I just hope the wheel is as good as abec 11 lol

I can not see the width of the wheels, can you post a picture of the contact patch? I wonder if there are narrow as the Abec 11

From what I understand it's the same dimensions of the Abec 11 97mm wheels but I may be wrong. 

Never had traction problems with my 90mm flywheels and I carve pretty hard and like to take corners at high speeds. Racing lines are important :slight_smile:

I did unintentionally slide out on 107s during a hard carve but there was Sand on the ground.

I like the contact patch:wheel diameter of the flywheels but not on the 97mm abecs, they look too narrow. 

I wish someone could make the same Orangatang Kegel contact patch:diameter ratio but bigger

By this you mean that these are not clones? You have clones with both thinner and thicker cores.

If wanting to buy wheels and add in bearings it won't let you use the GLOW55 discount code because the bearings already have a discount applied to them.  
But it also wont let you remove the bearing discount to use the GLOW55 code since it gives a better price.

We mean that the wheel pulley you chose for our wheels should be the same as the evolve or abec original cores. If you use a wheel pulley made for clone wheels with thicker core, that won't fit. 

Cheers!

Shoot, I completely dismissed these wheels due to them not having a kegel core, but just realized today that it wouldn't matter since I'm making a new build anyway. If anyone in the EU wants to sell theirs for less than they currently go for, please message me :smiley:
