Hi Brian,
Yes, motor pulleys have a 3mm keyway slot.  Long version would not fit my pulley/belt cover.

I wasn't even considering a satellite setup, but this is such a high quality amazing looking mount system that I'm reconsidering...  Do these allow 6384's (not Turnigy, but an actual 6384 dimension motor)  on the TB and Evolve trucks?  Is there a set for any Trampa trucks?

If the can length of 6384 motor has the dimension of 84mm, dual side-by-side will fit on TB 218.  Turnigy 6374 motors have a can length of 86.3mm and I have shown :point_up: to fit on TB 218.  Please note:  6384s do not fit on Evolve GT truck but **true** 6374s do.

@gmurad I would slide the ring and plate on the truck and snug up the clap enough where it can still slide freely but where it only takes 1 turn to not move.... then install the wheel and pulley with a belt, use the belt to line up the pullies and then snug the ring screw down, rinse and repeat

Thats kinda what I did and worked good...

I also added in a couple mm of extra space for wiggle room n such. Havent moved it since

@gmurad There is no specific measurement how far into the truck hanger to install the adapter because every setup is different, ie 12 vs 15mm belts.  @Holyman92 and @accrobrandon suggestion would perfectly work. 

 I recommend not to tighten the 5 bolts of the motor arm to the adapter until the final installation.  Only tighten those bolts after the adapter bolt has been torque down...and Loctite all threads.

yes...loctite AND wait the full 24 hrs for curing otherwise youll play the inpatient game of re-tightening the bolts if the motor sags from where u align it because u were inpatientand vibration loosened things up. =P

Hey, looking for some advice from others that have these mounts. 

I really thought the dual idlers on these mount would solve belt skipping during breaking. On my commute today It worked for 10 minutes and only on the tightest possible configuration and then it started skipping just as bad :frowning: (during my testing last night I found that only at the tightest position it stopped skipping, even at 1mm less than the tightest it skipped)

So now I have 4 of these mounts, more pulleys and 8 belts and they skip a lot for me. The second set is for a build that I'm just starting. What's the next thing I can try to stop skipping?  If these don't work it will be a lot of $ wasted.

Some stats: gearing is 14/36, my weight without any gear on is 225lbs. 12mm dual belts. 

Going 15mm is not really and option as it doesn't fit the Caliber IIs with 6355s and I would have to spend even more money on Pulleys?


(The belt is not touching itself but it's as close as possible)

Hey Gihad,
At 225lbs running 12mm belts, it's inevitable to get some belt skipping during **breaking**.   The rubber teeth of the belts do not have the capacity to completely lock onto the pulley, especially on a hard break.  Similar to a car slamming on the break bearing down at 60mph comes to a streaking stop even with anti-locking system.  

The positive of running idlers is prevent tooth skipping during acceleration, rides, and  improve breaking.  Have you try compare running with and w/o idlers?

```
With the 320 belts with no idlers vs 330 belts with dual idler I'm getting about the same amount of skipping, a lot of it. I never got belt skipping during acceleration, not even on the DIYEBoard drivetrain which was I wanted to improve upon with these.

I'm not even running powerful breaks here, on the other build that it's also supposed to use this same drivetrain the motors are a lot more powerful (dual 6355), so I guess it might be worse there?

It appears you still have some slacks on the belts.  Install a belt that is 5mm shorter than your current size.

Good eye @marcmt88 . I tried 320mm belts with just 1 idler (required a lot of force to install) and it gives a VERY tensioned setup, almost like a guitar string :joy: but there was no skipping during my short test. Tomorrow I will do a longer test.

 I will try the larger motor pulley with the 330mm and if I can find I will try 325mm belts. Thanks for all the help here and via email.

I get zero skipping during breaking on these with just a single idler bearing, brake side. Im 200 pounds and I am using 15mm belts. The motors are 5065 racestar, so not as much torque as 63mm motors. 

A larger motor pulley will definitely help. I have a theory that your 14t pulley is worn, that might be the cause. Can you take a photo of it? 

I am using 18t / 36t so I think the large motor pulley helps me a lot. Below 15t is not stable as they wear out too fast and skip more easily. Unless they are steel then they last good.

Motor pulleys are steel and new. The key difference with your setup are the 15mm belts. 18T would also help.

Update on my issue with belt skipping. I'm using the long motor arm mounts. I Was able to eliminate skipping with dual 12mm belts by using 14/36 gearing with 320mm belts and one idler pulley. In this setup the belt is very tensioned and range is reduced but no more skipping.

I also got another set as well for a build that I just finished, also with long arm and caliber IIs but with 16T/36T gearing (bigger motor pulley). in this case I'm using 330mm belts and no idlers at all, it's also a tight fit and there is no skipping! At the end of the day it seems that belt skipping has more to do with belt tension. Unfortunately the covers can not be used with if you don't have the idlers moving the belts down but I'm happy I was able to eliminate the skipping.

@marcmt88 Now that the belt skipping seems to be fixed I'm making a separate message for this other issue that I have. 
On both my builds that uses the Caliber II mounts they eventually get "tilted". I wonder if there is anything I can do other then DIYing a cross brace to stop this from happening. The bolt on the C-clamp is torqued down to the maximum, thread locked and waited 24 hours before riding.

![image|690x387](upload://ac7VdbLeGKSXL3p3CetS78ohc2U.jpg)

I noticed the c-clamp never really sits flush on the caliber II mounts so I wonder if this can ever work.

The Caliber IIs? I think it's just the lens distortion in the picture. What's causing the motor arm to be tilted is the c clamp. I wonder what I have to do for the c-clamp to not move.

How tight is the c-clamp supposed to be? I'm not sure if I can torque it down any further. Are the 2 ends of the C supposed to touch each other?

This is how it's setup right now:

To confirm whether your hanger is deformed or not, switch out the clamp.  Same thing happens with the other clamp, your truck's hanger is not symmetrical.

The trucks are brand new and not deformed at all, the same issue happens on my other board that uses the same type of mounts and also has new caliber II trucks. I'm hoping that I'm not installing them properly rather then it being a design flaw with the mounts. Maybe the long arm mounts are too long so there is a lot of leverage on them which causes them to tilt eventually?

I have customers that have brand new trucks with bent axles, deformed hangers,...  After all most trucks are cast, not precision CNC'ed.  I myself have an Evolve GT, brand new, that have an oversized axle.  I ended up lathe it down to fit the bearings.
Please swap out with the other clamp as suggested :point_up_2:.  Let me know how it goes.

ok, got it. 

When I was removing the clamp just now I noticed there wasn't a lot of resistance on the bolt and the other mount c-clamps are all threaded further then this one, so maybe the thread lock didn't take the first time. I want to make sure It's not a problem with my installation so I just cleaned and reinstalled again with thread lock all over the bolt. I torqued it as far as I could and I think I even stripped the bolt.

![image|281x500](upload://6KevSurRl80dFJYyJcBCke8GVcy.jpg) 

If this doesn't hold I will swap like you suggested.

PS: do you have the specs of the bolt handy? Will try to get some in allow steel at the hardware store if I need to switch it again since this one is probably stripped.

Bolt is probably mounted in reversed.  Please note:  the clamp only has one side that is threaded.  Following video show the quick and easy way of installing the mount https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfwuMY0f-B0&t=167s

Bolt is 10-24 x 1 1/4"

The bolt was not mounted in reverse :unamused:

Please don't forget that this is the second build that I use these mounts, I've already learned the install process from your video on the first build including putting the bolt in reverse temporarily with the coin to open the c-clamp but after that putting the bolt back **not in reverse** for securing it permanently.

It would be very difficult to install that bolt in reverse and not notice it during installation, I'm fairly experienced with DIY projects.

Another option is to install a locknut on the protruding thread of the bolt.  That would surely lock down the bolt clamp.

Dual Sk3 6374s setup running 15mm belts works on TB218mm, not Caliber trucks.  There is not enough clearance between the motor arms to fit dual "true" 6374s or sk3 6374s.  

You can run **dual 6354s** with 15mm belts on Cal trucks.

And now upgraded to the new version with crossbars :smirk:
Dual 6355 running on 15mm belts. 

If motor clearance is an issue, add washers where the crossbars meet the mount. I had to add five on each side because i was using @JLabs pulleys which brought the wheel out by about 3~4mm.

Ugh, I hate you all, lol. I was just at peace with the 12mm decision and now you're making me second guess myself,lol. 

I'm just shy of 200lbs (90kg) and like the idea of looser belts so I can push a little if needed. I'll be running dual motor and probably going to order a 14 or 16/36 setup on 90mm wheels. Most people seem to be fine with 12's but I also tend to overbuild on anything I do. I'll give it another day or two... That dual mount is pretty badass though, @marcmt88.

@linny, were you running mid or long mounts with the dual 12mm belts? Also, why did you upgrade?

When i was on the dual 12mm, i was on the short ones because i was using 80mm Kegels. But before upgrading the mounts i hooked on 100mm Boas and they fit fine, so apparently big wheels can fit the short mounts. 

They were getting a bit dinged and beat up due to the small wheels making it lower to the ground. The new ones with the crossbars looked nice and came anodized so i pulled the trigger :joy:

Sorry, misunderstood you.  Standard POM pulleys come in 13 or 16mm wide.  I can also customize to any width.  To order the proper size, specify in "NOTE" during check out.  Please note:  12mm belts are very limited in size.

## \#138 Posted by: marcmt88 Posted at: 2018-10-21T14:49:28.632Z Reads: 116

Speed and torque are based on the ratio of your pulley setup.
For example:
-15/36t has a higher speed than 15/44t.

Width has no effect on speed. But wider is stronger.

Wider pulleys give better torque performance.  The don't effect speed.  For single motor setup, I highly recommend 16mm wide pulley.

Let me start off with the fact that this mounting setup is the tits.![20181110_154918|375x500](upload://n01UAzY46ej8HdZBphqXxgdP1mf.jpeg) 

I did just shave off some delrin from one of the idlers some how on a ride though![15444340994415882917115172155397|375x500](upload://vcxVRTO7SA0GM7vBkCbHYG22FC6.jpeg) 

So, I was cruising around and one side of the mount crept inward along the hanger resulting in a hectic alignment issue that I only saw at the end of my ride.

The only thing I can guess that caused this is that I must not have tightened the clamp enough before connecting the mounting plate.

Ive currently only got power going to one of my motors, I'm waiting for my Unity so I have to check both mounts now.

Ive noticed if you don't torque the bolt down or use loctite, they will loosen every ride.

Cool, I'm moving very soon so I'll wait till I'm settled at my new address till I get in touch.

I'll probably get some extra x-bars that are a bit longer too, so I can get rid of my washers.

## \#148 Posted by: JasperM Posted at: 2018-12-11T02:33:29.771Z Reads: 116

Yeah I've got Loctight on everything and nyloc nuts on the end of the bolts holding the mount to the clamp.

Also paging @J0ker3366
Yea i've had pretty severe issues because I didn't know to loctite the drivetrain completely. 
The wheel pulley has a circular gash deep in it because the clamp -> mount screws loosened and carved into the delerin. 

My idlers keep coming lose, causing the belt to jump into a weird position and destroying the idlers and belt covers. One idler got wrecked yesterday and now looks like https://i.imgur.com/lXezOQN.jpg this (That was all that was left of it when I realised something was wrong.  as well as the other idlers having gashes and having been melted at the top. Both stabilizer bars also fell off, as well as me being stupid and stripping a motor screw which means i'm in a stuck spot. I've already advised @marcmt88 to adjust his advertising to say you must take apart the mounts and add loctite, because I bought the drive train assuming "Meticulously assembled and ready to install on your deck" meant I could install it on my deck and ride, but i've needed to loctite all screws and buy a special pump for the tires.

This is a part of DIY. If thats a problem then you're in the wrong place. I hace 3 mounts from @marcmt88 and have no issues from them. All screws are torqued down with no loctite and nothing comes loose. Check to make sure you hanger mount is fully tightened. You could also be looking @ alignment issues. 

@marcmt88's mounts are solid when installed correctly and securely. WERA Hex+ Allen wrenches, 3m hex head bolts and a little work and you should be fine. If you need an install guide I'd be happy to help.
