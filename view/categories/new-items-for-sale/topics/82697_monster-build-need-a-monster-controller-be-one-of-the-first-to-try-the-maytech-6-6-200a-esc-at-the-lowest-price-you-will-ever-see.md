There is a mistake in the size I guess.
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs 180mm long...
That‚Äôs only what she says üòú

Any news about the ‚Äûdisconnect the CAN bus while powered on and the communication port is fried‚Äú issue? Is this a problem on this units too or is it fixed?

They have been tested in the factory. We are all guinea pigs with this stuff, I'm running one through setup and bench test. The weather here in the states prevents me from running in the field

And what do you mean weather, here in NY its 5 degrees and we still riding!

If the issue was with an earlier version or a different manufacturer making 6.6 I don't believe it would travel this far in design if it was a big problem.

The hw 4.12 based vesc including focbox before v1.7 had the issue, if two vesc have been connected via CAN bus and one switched of or you disconnected the CAN bus while both where powered on you damaged the communication port which means you can use them only with split ppm after as CAN bus didn‚Äôt work.
The latest version of the focbox fixed that problem and also the Flipsky single 6.6 doesn‚Äôt have that issue anymore. 
But i‚Äòm not sure if all vesc6 versions have this fixed. I think the ESCapes still have this issue.

Is is there any other support for the caps besides the little bit of glue between them and the legs?

Yes, I had to remove glue to move them and take a picture. Its a tight space but it has enough glue to hold them in place. They are not bouncing around in there.

... Just don't unplug the canbus while it is on?

Yes, good idea üëåüëç
You can ask here how much people already fried there communication port üòâ
Some because they just didn‚Äôt know about it
Some because the CAN bus came lose due to vibration 
Some because one vesc switched off ...

Okay sure but still, this isn't new hardware so it's not like he could have fixed it afaik.

Imo canbus is too risky I just run split ppm

Considering the original Vesc6 does not have the can disconnect problem, any esc based on it should also not have that problem if it is correctly made.

Yes me I did that.  Not only once either.  Good news is that you just snip off the canbus chips and they come magically back to life.

@Andy87 how are you liking this vesc? I need to grab one soon, and this seems like a decent alternative to what's on the market right now

Didn‚Äôt have much time with them, but the time I had was pretty good. Run them in dual at 80 bat and 90 motor amps and they didn‚Äôt get over 42degree Celsius. I had a stop for 20-30sec and according to the metr data they directly cooled down 5degree, so cooling works well as well as power output. 
But for such a huge vesc that should be to expected.
I bought them initially to run them with my 8085 motors. For 63xx motors Trampas vesc 6 would probably more what I would buy. They just have a smaller form factor and probably can output more than enough amps as well. Price difference shouldn‚Äôt be that much. Isn‚Äôt the vesc6 from trampa not even cheaper? ü§î

excellent point, I have already whispered in an ear that a duel version in one case would be the sweet spot. The PCB isn't that big and with a little work, 2 can be mounted in one heatsink case. Once its designed.

yes, there have been one or two here or in the  forum who tried them out. but i don¬¥t remember who and i think it was also not for an esk8.
i think a proper vesc6 is more than enough for our esk8 applicationts. 
no need to go overkill on that. just adds weight and money.

7" should be the evolve i think. 
I just tried 6.5" trampa urban threads.
they nice for a smooth ride on streets and handle a bit more psi, so probably get a little bit more range out of them over 8".
Wouldn¬¥t use them for offroad though.

@hyperIon1 I  have finally gotten around to installing my set for testing!!! Initial impressions of their performance is stellar, but limited to a few uphill dog-walks. I, like @Andy87 , have not seen anything above 42C, followed by RAPID cooling. Very excited to be a part of this, can't wait to get some intense test runs in!!!
