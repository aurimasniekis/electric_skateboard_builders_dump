Hey guys!

I know this ia bad timing because of Black Friday and everyone trying to get deals and everything, but I have a Deck and Enclosure for sale!

It is a new Drop Through Jet Killshot that I customized with silvery fabric skinning and glass frit.


It comes with a custom Carbon Fiber/Fiberglass enclosure already mounted to the deck with M4 threaded inserts and Fender Washers.


This deck/enclosure combo took many hours of work for me.  I am selling it because I have too many projects and need to clear my bench a bit for some stuff incoming.

This is not for the novice builder.  You will have to drill mounting holes, and yoy will have to drill holes in the enclosure for any battery indicators, switches or charge ports.  

I left the mounting holes undrilled to give you options for how you want to set it up (top mount or drop through).  

No matter what you do, get some x-washer from @akhlut.  Because they add some robustness and look amazing.

The enclosure is damn bullet proof.   Super strong, and can easily be buffed, sanded or you can always blast another coat of clear to restore shine.  The internal dimensions are about 6" x 21" and could house a double stack battery if you use thicker weather stripping.

It fits 10s4p perfectly for a flat pack and has plenty of room for other hardware.

What it includes:

-Completely custom Jet Kill Shot with glass frit

- Custom fit CF enclosure (hand made and bullet)

- Stainless threaded inserts and m4 bolts+fendor washers.

**you must drill your own mounting holes!**

This thing is beautiful, but was also handmade and has minor cosmetic imperfections (like fucking everything)


It is not a light set up, but it is bad ass.

I would like to get $325 shipped, but am open to trade offers or other offers.

Hell, if you aren't a veteran builder, get @psychotiller to build it out for you! üòâ 


Thanks for checking it out, I hope you like "Captain Phasma"

I said $325, i know, I know.  It is pricey.

But goddammit, I spent so much time on this mother fucker.

I know that isn't the buyers prerogative, but still.

The  inserts, fender washers and M4s alone is like $25.  With some extras in case of loss.


But for you Dave.... $10 and a fine lobster dinner with your Mother.





Or store credit, lol.

I think you should still look up Parcel monkey info for @Mich21050 so that it least looks like you're working a little bit.

Hey motha fuckas, Dave PayPal'd me in literally 2 minutes!

Really flattering TBH.

@PatRocks I really need to do a build thread on it.  But more so, skinning stuff in general.  I am getting better at it all the time (still learning shit though, of course). I have 2 more projects in the works right now thanks to @mmaner and @Mikenopolis... they are going to be fucking awesome!!!

I spent most of my free time working on my manifesto, lol.  Please check itnout in the lounge under "Is DIY right for you"

Brace yourselves though, it is long AF and needs some work, lol.
