Hi,
I have these switches for sale. They use direct FETs with a heatsink. They are fairly small (see specs) to fit into minimalistic high power builds. I also have them listed on my website:
http://electricskateboard.repair/index.php?id_product=36&controller=product

You can use this switch to turn on/off your electric vehicle with a nice metal LED illuminated push-button. This is also useful to avoid sparking when connecting an ESC or other load to your battery.

The price I am asking for them is 25€ (includes everything pictured+instructions)+**shipping** which is 4€ **worldwide with tracking** 

**Why should you use it?**
* You can safely switch high voltage and high amperage devices with ease!
* Avoid sparks when plugging connectors together
* Aesthetically pleasing push-button which lights up when the switch is ON

**Specification:**
* Max continuous amperage: 100A-fuse (120A if you change the fuse & 200A peak for a few seconds)
* Max voltage: 13S (56V)
* PCB Dimensions: 49mm*39mm (1.9" * 1.5")
* Push-button: Ø18mm (Ø16mm hole, Ø13.5mm button)
* Wires: power 10cm (input&output), push-button 15cm

If you have any additional questions feel free to PM me or post them below! :slight_smile:

Not sure which ones he is using, sorry. I will try to find his and update this post

BTW: The Fets I am using are rated for over 140A each so theoretically this switch could do almost 300A continuous but lets be real, that would need some crazy cooling and it would drastically decrease the longevity and reliability so to keep it safe I advertise 120A only.

I have been riding them (this last version) for over a month daily. Dual VESCs 6355 10S3P 30Q 46A from battery. But I have done testing using the 120A on lipos but my motors were getting too hot so that was short term, but nevertheless tested.

If a stick or debris hits the off switch, will it shut down the board?

Or does it have a "hold to turn off" safety feature?

Hi can you ship to Ireland.

Will this work with a 6s setup.

What do I need to know before I buy

Also can I read instructions before I buy

If you mean the PCB switch then no it is in heatshrink.
If you mean the pushbutton then it would have to be pretty bad luck because the pushbuton is below the surrounding surface so it would have to fit inside the hole. 
No it is a regular pushbutton with aretation (locked in either position).

Last question. A really stupid question. I have a power switch on my esc and it just shuts off power to the esc so other things like the battery display indicator still draws power so I had to use a xt-90 anti spark loop key. This isn't like that no?

I just solder it before anything else.

The switch turns off everything that is connected after the switch so if your indicator is connected to the output of the switch, it will be turned off.
And instructions are int the first post now.

120A cont. is a pretty big claim dude...

No body has a switch that can endure that... yet

What size is your fuse?

Are you offering a guarantee?
(might need more testing with bigger motors/batteries)

Hope they work out! for your price you will sell zillions!

```
Yes but there are very few people that actually reach the 120A continuous.
The fuse is 80A slow blow, it is less than the max to protect the FETs since it is easier to replace the fuse than the FETs. 
Yes there is a warranty on the switch if it is used correctly. It is hard to give a warranty to a DIYer though as you can imagine because just like the VESC if you short things out it dies and it is hard to tell if it has been shorted since the way these fail is mosfets get "stuck" in the ON position. And there is a lot of ways that can happen.

The worst is that the switch will not turn off. If you follow the instructions you wont have a problem.

Well in case you blow the fuse the battery gets disconnected (the fuse cant tell if the battery was shorted therefore in fire danger or if something minor blew it) And in case you turn the switch off you may still have brakes (I have not tested this, just a theory at this point) because the body diode of the mosfet would conduct and the motors would keep the VESC ON

The VESC turns on even if you dont use any brakes. I tried this with relation to some other thread some time ago, the vesc turns on even if I just push the board without any throttle the VESC turns on, even when just dragging the rear wheels on the ground pulling the board.

Hi, they are actually almost all gone. There are 3 left.
The color of the LED can not be changed unless you change the switch, sorry. You can use any switch off ebay that has the LED rated for 12V, it does not even need to be spdt, just a latching switch.

I expect them to be back in stock in early May. I am currently waiting for any updates from people that bought the first batch, just in case there are any unforeseen issues, I dont expect any since I tested the switches for some time but just in case. This is a one time thing only since this was the first batch.

I will keep you updated here, and @Slippery1980 you will receive email(s) regarding the status of your order of course. 
Thank you, Martin.

Get on this dude, try with at least 5/6p or lipos, 4wd, 6374 min maybe 6384? maybe on a mountain board that gets lots of wheel spin and higher peak currents (vesc 6 is 100 battery amps capable)?

Hello everyone! 
I have good news. The switches that any one of you pre-ordered through my website or here on the forum are ready, just waiting for final testing and photo shoot tomorrow and they will ship out a few days prior to the date specified (1st May). Here is a quick cell phone picture. There are also upgraded specs that you will be able to find on the WEB soon. :slight_smile:

A little later than I wanted but I just was not able to find the time to update this thread. The switches are unfortunately out of stock again but all components are on order, the next availability date is set to 21.5. (05/21).
Pre order is now allowed since I have the date. As always, I included some headroom  in the time but the date may change if something goes wrong. I hope it wont, last batch was 3 days early. :slight_smile:

I am a little behind on PMs, replies and have to create a thread for the refurbished VESCs. So if you contacted me in any way, I will get back to everyone, dont worry. Sorry for the delay.

how much in aud to get one shipped to Australia? Really looking forward to this switch it seems like a perfect solution to my anti spark key. Looking at trying to control it with a pressure sensor so my board turns on when I stand on it and after x seconds of no pressure, it turns off. Should be easy to control using an arduino.

@Martinsp The notes on the site say to connect to the C and NC, this right? So the circuit is normally closed and the switch opens to start the power.

@Linux0701 Thank you for the compliments and recommendation! Really appreciate it. :slight_smile:

@Maxid Do you mean dimensions of the PCB or the pushbutton? Both dimensions are in the product description, if you need any other measurements feel free to ask. 

@JonathanLau1983 Yes the switch (FETs) are normally turned on to prevent the board from shutting down leaving the rider with no brakes in case the button connector disconnects for some reason (it has a lock but better safe then sorry). So yes C and NC is correct, the pushbutton should not be conducting in ON position.

Sorry :confused:
There will definitely be some. I have redesigned it once again to make it smaller but maintain the power it can handle. 

There will be a clearance sale next month since I have some bare PCBs for these switches left so I will put them together to make room for the new ones. Also there are some new very exciting things coming, one of them is a new switch that has not been made before, I already have a test sample so once I feel confident about them I will put it up for sale. :) This will all happen next month hopefully in the first half. :)

Hello everyone,

I am sorry it took so long but I have had to split my time between a lot of projects but here it is, the third version of the switch. The first version was small with a small power output, the second was big with higher power output and in this third version I managed to combine small form factor so you will not waste precious space on your board and maintained the high power output so that you are not limited to use the full potential of your battery! :slight_smile:
You can [pick one up right now](http://electricskateboard.repair/index.php?id_category=24&controller=category)! 
![2|500x500](upload://tTDApm7CPzVdFrogymQOAnU6lGo.jpg)

I am also working on the push to start switch (find out more [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/push-to-start-switch-coming-soon/60879)) should be available soon!
Best regards, Martin.

Hello @Frenchy
yes the switch is rated up to 13S. I saw that you already placed an order, the shipping is usually withing 2 weeks at worst if the "traffic" is high. We do all we can to speed up the shipping so 1. class is on all orders by default.

Hello everyone,

sorry for not replying here or in PMs. I was unfortunately busy moving the shop to a different/new location. We should be back on track with orders and other stuff already. I have replied to everyone I think in PMs and emails but if you have not received a reply please just let me know I may have unintentionally skip someone.

I just wanted to give you all an update on this. I have received some questions if these are still running the same version as the previous batch that turned out to be less reliable than what I was wanting. So to answer it, no we are not using/selling the same switches as before. We have now after attempts at making the older versions work as reliably as possible decided to make a completely new design from scratch. 
Since we have made the [push to start switch](http://electricskateboard.repair/index.php?id_product=44&controller=product&search_query=switch&results=8) that required an MCU on the PCB (which resulted in a very reliable swithc) we decided to use it in these sort of standard/regular anti spark switches. And the results were very good! I am happy with the way the last version has turned out.

So to summarize it, the last/newest version that has been shipping out for almost two months now is smaller, more reliable, and more powerful. We have even stopped using a fuse on our switches since a lot of our customers were asking us to bypass it for them. If you are interested you can read more about these regular anti spark switches here: http://electricskateboard.repair/index.php?id_product=36&controller=product&search_query=switch&results=8 The information should be up to date with all there new changes. 

That is it for the update, if anyone has any questions feel free to ask below or shoot me a PM.


Enjoy your weekend, Martin. :)

Damn I think I’ve come here at the right time xD. Your switch now seems to be perfect in terms of reliability. So this switch adapts the MCU design of the more expensive push to start one right?

If I order now, how long until it arrives? Is shipping still €4 to the US?

Push-to-start and a 45 minute auto shutoff means you don't need a power button or loopkey anymore.

Until/unless the antispark switch fails -- and fails in the closed, "on" state -- then you risk running your battery completely dead, past 2.8V / cell

Right?

Not having a power button or loop key is *tremendously good* for water resistance, though

@Martinsp do these have a "precharge" circuit where it turns on through a resistor first, before the main FETs open-up?  So they are never operating in the linear region?
```

@mtuan293 It is hard to compare them because while they have the same "core" (they switch power on and off) their use is a little different as @b264 pointed out the auto turn off feature for example.

The shipping rates have gone up a little, now it is 5,3€ I believe. The exact number is calculated during checkout.

@b264 yes there is a pre-charge "circuit". Circuit in quotes because the conventional pre-charge circuit consisted of a resistor and capacitor but now it is controlled with the MCU which is better because I can precisely control at what stage of the curve the transistor is held during the time the capacitors on ESCs are charging and for how long.

@Martinsp So is there is a separate FET for the precharge, meaning none of them are ever anything except fully closed or fully open?  That's what makes antispark switches fail

So, for example, one FET turns on but has a 5 ohm resistor in series with the output.  Then about 200 milliseconds or so later, 3 or so main FETs open up

Is that what happens or is that not what happens?
```

---
## \#98 Posted by: Martinsp Posted at: 2018-09-28T20:09:39.895Z Reads: 135

@mtuan293 yes both of them have the pre-charge (more often called anti spark at least on the forum here) feature.
Yes both of them have a heatsink, however with the low RDS-on and the fact that the FETs are not switched on and off repeatedly unlike on ESCs the heatsink barely gets warm under normal use.

@b264 no that is not the way it is in this case. I have seen some switch in the picture thread not sure whos it was but in this case it is that the transistors open partially (so they have relatively high RDS-on) for a moment until the spike is gone and than it opens fully. This happens under 3s to make sure that the switch is fully on before the VESC is booted

"pre-charge" to me means a separate FET with series resistor

I would not expect any FETs in a "pre-charge" system to ever be operating in the linear zone or high-Rds zone

"antispark" would include both pre-charge antispark and inrush-limiting antispark

I think this is an inrush-limiting antispark

I am actually not entirely sure on what the correct terminology in this case would  be.
I think that the three terms mean the same, they are just used by different people. I may be completely wrong here but the way I see it is that the term pre charge and inrush limiting is describing the same thing, limiting the **inrush current** therefore **pre-charging the capacitors**.
And the term antispark is IMO "invented" by someone who is not into electronics and is just describing what the switch does, it makes sure that there is no spark on the bind/loop key.
```

## \#101 Posted by: b264 Posted at: 2018-09-28T20:26:15.452Z Reads: 128

Then maybe we could call them "non-linear antispark solid state control switches with separate precharge path and only low-Rds FET operation"

Confusing the difference between the two could confuse consumers as to what they are actually getting and lead to a long series of questions like this to even know if your FETs are going to be getting hot upon startup or if they aren't...

of course, it's great for marketing purposes :expressionless:

No, thats not the case. The time between OFF and fully on is less than 3 seconds and the power that needs to be dissipated during that period is relatively small. To put it to perspective, the switch would work just fine during the turn on time and under moderate load without any heatsink at all.

This means during "linear operation" or "high Rds", which is the same time when they are disspating energy as heat from inside the FETs

This is opposed to "digital operation" where they are always fully-on or fully-off

@mtuan293 Yes as Kug3lis said, there can be a "spark" which burns the semiconductor inside creating carbon which is conductive and that leads to the FET being shorted permanently.

@b264 I am not sure why you think that the FET can not operate outside of the digital operation?

I don't.  You said that, not me.

I said it gets hot when operating in the linear region.  This getting hot is what causes these devices to fail.  If not for that, they wouldn't ever fail and loopkeys wouldn't be so popular.

That's why I started asking if this one worked that way, but you kept sidestepping the question and attempting to create confusion.  One swift "no" would have sufficed.

I may have not explained what I meant enough. I think you mean when I was talking about the FETs burning/shorting during turn on. What I meant to say is that if you turn the FET on completely right away without limiting the current with higher RDSon you will get sort of a spark or a break through of the semiconductor due to the high current being allowed to pass through. That is why the FETs are not turned on completely right away but after some time has passed and the CAPs are charged.

I dont think I was avoiding answering your question or sidestepping as you say. I said my answer to your question followed by an explanation of why it is so. And once again, I dont mean to create confusion.

Intentionally creating confusion, in the name of more sales, is never a good strategy.  This is a nice innovative product and it can stand on its own.  Nobody expects every product to have every feature.  But we want to know what it has.

Your alternative approach to the same problem is novel and may end up being better.  But you need to be honest.

Okay I see what you mean.
I dont mean to be rude but here is a wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-charge where the pre-charge is described. You can see that while the page is obviously talking about the "pre-charge" there is stated that pre charge function/feature is implemented into circuits to prevent inrush current. So precharge=inrush limiting. So based on that I think that these terms are interchangable and mean the same thing. I am stating the facts, if you think it means something else show me some kind of a proof that you are correct. I will be more than happy to admit that I was wrong. However the fact that you think something means what it does not is not my problem and if you think I am spreading confusion to increase sales you not only do not know me but you think it based on what as of now to me seems is incorrect terminology. Dont take it offensively, I dont know how to word it to make it sound less mean...

So this makes anti-spark well, anti spark right? If not then it’d be pointless since there’s still spark inside to destroy the FETs.

It is an anti spark switch. The spark inside mosfets is just what causes the switches to break if not made properly so no worries here.

Yes I have, I actually forgot to reply to a thread regarding that so thank you for reminding me! :)

Flipsky's switch doesn't have push-to-start.  Push-to-start combined with auto poweroff means you don't need a power button or loopkey which drastically helps in the effort for water resistance.  Less holes in the enclosure is always better.

TL;DR: use @Martinsp antispark instead

Hello everyone,

so finally after over a month of no stock, its here. I have switches ([PTS as well](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/push-to-start-switch-out-now/60879/185)) in stock.

[Here they are!](http://sprusi.com/index.php?id_product=31&id_product_attribute=0&rewrite=anti-spark-switch-with-push-button&controller=product)  

There have been a few changes made but mostly to the assembly process and FW. 
The switches now come with the poshbuttons with power logo, they are nicer to look at and the quality is better as well in my opinion. I had issues with keeping up with these since I can not get them locally anywhere.
I have ordered them from china from a few suppliers and picked the one that had the best quality so there should not be any issues with quality. I test all of them on my own anyway to make sure.

We have also moved to a new site because we have had too many things to change on the old website so it made sense to make a new one since I wanted to change the name anyway. Of course all of our "old" products and services are still available as before and there is plenty more to come. The new website is www.SPRUSI.com and it should be all set up ready to go. Please if you encounter any issues let me know so I can resolve them. :)

Well you got me again. I just ordered one without a button again.

Thank you. :slight_smile:
 Was that without a button a mistake or?

No mistake. Don’t need a button with roll to start. 

I just stated again since I ordered one last time.

Ordered one. Perfect timing @Martinsp. I needed one for my latest build.

I put in an order for a pack. Looking forward to receiving it!

Also, the link in your original post needs to be updated.

Thank you! @boostem  :slight_smile:

I unfortunately can no longer edit the first post nor the title. I am not sure if it is an error on the forum or if it is only editable for a limited time. I am thinking that once there are so many changes that the product is too different I will create another thread or something. But thank you for letting me know.

I can at least edit the title for you. Just post what you want it to say and I'll change it.

I think you lose edit ability after 3 months of no edits, but I could be wrong.

As far as the title, Regulars/Moderators/Admins can edit any title but Members cannot.

Here is a link to a post I made on the PTS thread about static power consumption. I can not copy and paste it because the forum considers that spam so here is a link instead: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/push-to-start-switch-out-now/60879/195?u=martinsp
The measurement was done with a PTS switch but they are virtually the same, different firmware and this switch does not have the potentiometer etc... otherwise they are the same.

Any difference between the older generation AS you used to sell and the current ones in terms of expected power draw when off?

I ask because I have both the older generation and newer gen antispark from you.

The newer gen one draws down my 10S2P noticibly when off. Especially since it's 2P but the older one doesn't.

I think what you are comparing are the first versions which did not have a micro controller so they consumed almost no current. The downside however was that they were easier to damage during installation so I switched to the newer design with MCU

Are the instructions for the newer version the same as for the old ones? I think I thew away the instructions that came with my switch :upside_down_face:.

@Martinsp Sorry but how are customers supposed to get ahold of you? I've sent you a PM regarding an issue I have more than a month ago and since then a few follow up messages - still waiting for a reply.

The issue is that the switch drains the battery on standby like @ervinelin reported.\
In my case it causes an almost new 10S2P battery to drain from full to empty in around 2-3 weeks. Not a very good thing.

I had the same issue and it killed two of my 10s4p Batteries. I didn't know it was the antispark that was killing my batteries 😒
