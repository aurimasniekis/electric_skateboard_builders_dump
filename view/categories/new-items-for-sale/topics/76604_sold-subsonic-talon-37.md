I bought a Subsonic Talon longboard.  It's a beauty, and I was hoping to use it, but I'm devoted to using Ollin's dual-diagonal revolve drive.  There's not enough clearance to mount those on this deck without some modification to it.  The issue seems to be primarily mounting the front motor.

This deck could be could for someone who wants to use hubs or is planning to outward mount motors.  I think it's possible to inward mount them, but it might depend on your mount and you might have to drill some additional holes in the deck to mount your trucks a little further back.  

Deck has never been used.  Trucks were mounted on it, and that's as far as I got before I realized my dream was not to be.

Original price was $155 plus $22 shipping.  **Asking $150** shipped in the U.S. Subsonic has been sold out of these for awhile.  I'm in DC, so locals are welcome to check it out and pick it up.

Here's a couple of builds that others have done:
* [Subsonic Talon | Carvon XL | 12s4p 30Q](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/subsonic-talon-carvon-xl-12s4p-30q/70813) <-- this is a gorgeous build
* [Subsonic Talon Build](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/subsonic-talon-build/58764)

Here's a bad ass enclosure from @Eboosted:

@mackann Isn't this the deck you use on your boards?
