Is the 15mm Kegel pulley kit the same as the 12mm? Also do you sell just the wheel pulley I can‚Äôt use the motor pulleys with my motors I plan to use.

@briman05 Yeah, I haven't added the listing for the 15mm but you can purchase the regular 12mm Kegel and note in the comments that you want the 15mm and we'll send you the 15mm.

Can I do that for the 14T HTD5 9mm Motor Pulley? Also are your 15mm pulleys with an overhang?
```

@BoostedBuilder - No, unfortunately not. The 14T HTD 9mm are overstock. 14T 15mm is standard like our 16T motor pulleys.

@Battosaii @myreala - Sorry, made a mistake on the product listing. I have a few older models of 12S4P with Panasonic PF Cells those ones are $300.00 and the Samsung 30Q is $350.00. Let me know what your order is and if you wanted the PF or 30Q option. You can PM me.

@BoostedBuilder 20T 15mm has no overhang. Looks similar to this one here.

I'm asking since I only have 18mm until my AT tire so I'm trying to understand if your 20T 15mm pulley will fit?
Thank you for the answer btw!
```

---
## \#27 Posted by: torqueboards Posted at: 2017-11-23T21:21:31.158Z Reads: 167

```
It should fit perfectly fine. If you are using our 6374's they would since we have longer motor shafts than typical motors. Just face the hub side of the motor outwards.
```

---
## \#28 Posted by: BoostedBuilder Posted at: 2017-11-23T21:28:10.100Z Reads: 167

```
I'l be cutting of a little bit of the shaft since my AT tire will not fit( In total I'll leave 25mm of the shaft. After the 6.3mm mount I'll have around 18mm so hopefully it fits!
```

@BoostedBuilder - Still finalizing the details but I plan on releasing 6x2 street tubeless pneumatics soon with Reverse Mounts on 15mm wide belts. Hopefully a 7-8" AT option also with the same rim.

i‚Äôve heard good things about FOC on the new FW. Personally I would rate the TB vescs a 7/10 seeing as mine randomly blew while it was in my locker. I‚Äôve never used FOC though.

@torqueboards do you have any wire extensions with 5.5mm bullet connections? I reverse mounted my TB 6355 setup but I need extensions to connect the TB VESC to the 6355. I could make my own but if you have them in stock I'll just order from you.

I never thought I'd go 12s let alone 12s4p but for the price I couldn't say no, if you are looking for a battery imo I don't think you can even build it your self for that price unless you already had parts and equipment to make a battery. 

I'm excited but also sad that now I'll have a DIY that should make my Raptor 2 obsolete lol
