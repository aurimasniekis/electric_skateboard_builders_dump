You may want to go over to the dark matter thread as I know alot of people had been asking on there.  Good to see that these will be coming back.  I might look at getting a set

[/quote]

TL:DR, can they add a dimple in the shaft where the set screw goes in, and change the set screw to a conical shape one instead of the flat one they currently use (see pix below)?

Is there any way to have these made better? According to @JLabs who also sold this variant before there seems to be a slight flaw in how the motor shaft is held in. I bought two from Max, one motor is still fine but the other one has two issues:

1.) the entire motor can moves in and out 2-3mm (with the shaft), only thing keeping it from pulling out is the c-clip,

2,) the grub /set screw that holds the shaft in position doesn't do a good job so it slowly wiggles in after 10 miles. This happened to me three times despite properly using loctite.

Max said he would send me a replacement but it hasn't arrived in time for the group ride tomorrow. I was able to shift the shaft out, there are two FLAT spots where the the FLAT set screw presses on, mine had scratches on it from the shaft moving back and forth. I drilled a dimple on it and switched the flat set screw to a conical one so it actually screws into the dimple. Hopefully this holds up tomorrow,

BUT the entire can and shaft still moves, still not sure what that issue is

I personally like the dog tail set screww that is what they use on the racer star pullies and the motor has a hole just the right size for the dog tail set screw to fit in

I like that little hole. Keeps things in one spot if alignment is good.

Hey Marc, did the magnets get changed? Here’s what was inside the ones off Max

His were advertised as curved too but I think the pics say otherwise, guess he never had a peek inside the can

@marcmt88 I too am curious seeing I just order a set not long ago.

@marcmt88 I know sceperr tested each one before shipping, and he had parts on hand for repairs/ warranty. Will you be offering testing and/or warranty?

@Mikenopolis I told them how to fix the issue, but they don’t listen. The shaft is very likely to slip, if not right when you receive them or after a few miles. 

This is a very expensive motor with a nice markup and I would hate to have you all have the same problems as Mike.

Can't you design a custom shaft?

Mike have you tried retaining compound? If 648 can hold motor pulleys on the shaft with those incredible loads, it help hold on the can attachment side. There's a lot less contact surface though...

Hey Mike,
My buddies and I also been running Scepter's motors, we did not encounter any issues so far.  They are quite a solid performer.  The only thing I could think of is the possibility of missing brass washer before the retainer c-clip as picture below.  This might explain the motor moves in and out 2-3mm.

By the looks of it, it's 100% like the motor I had several severe issues with. 

Shaft moving, magnets coming loose, but the biggest issue for me is the weak metal where the screws holding the motor go, leading to stripped threads in the screw holes. And I did not overtighten the screws, but if you have to screw and unscrew a couple of times, the threads will strip. 

3 out of 4 holes have stripped threads. 

Also, a slight bit of play letting the can move as was mentioned. And it did have the same brass retainer.

Curved Magnets
[/quote]

The magnets in your picture are not curved magnets. 

Curved motor magnets are supposed to be concave towards the inside, enabling for less room between the magnet and the stator. 

These magnets are convex towards the can, but flat on the side facing the stator. IOW, fake marketing.

Like I said, my buddies and I ran the same motors with no issues.  Magnets coming loose probably caused by motor can accidently knocking against the curb or pavement.  As for stripped threads, be careful not to cross threads mounting bolts the first time around.  Loctite is also recommended.

Not hiding anything here... let the pictures do the talking.  Curved or not curved, you guys can decided to buy or not.

Nope. Can never hit anything. 
Maybe 10 out of 14 magnets (if not all) were loose after a few weeks of riding, when motor collapsed totally.

Always used thread locker and the stripped threads only happened with this motor. You can even feel that the metal is not as hard when screwing in the bolts. My other motor (maytech) is rock solid when it comes to the threads.

If this is the same motor as mine, I really hope this issue has been resolved. I actually believe I saw a mention of this on some chinese site selling motors that looked like this, that their new "upgraded" motor was supposed to use a harder metal due to issues with the previous version.

They claim to use thicker steel.

    1) New design 6374 with sealed design and add thickness onto the mounting side, 
    so they can stand any pull strength.

I was interested in getting some of these motors back before the original dark matter was even posted.
They offered a nice looking sealed design for a good price. But I have read a lot of people having trouble with this motor so went for a different design instead.

Can you say where you got your version from? It's quite confusing and murky otherwise.

I bought mine from a european vendor (one year ago), who actually quit selling them (and went over to maytech) since several people were having issues with motor quality/ motors failing.

I got a replacement can from the same seller and motor's actually been running fine with no issues since (apart from the stripped threads) . We'll see how it holds up.

Scepterr motor has the retainer rings. How is that the same motor?
