Whilest pouting because LiIon Wholesale is out of stock on my favorite new NCR20700B's I noticed these 
[Lishen 20700's](https://liionwholesale.com/collections/batteries/products/lishen-21700-lr2170sa-12a-flat-top-4000mah-battery-genuine?variant=16096525254750) are on sale for about half the price of the Sanyos.

Caveat that these are 2 year old cells and they are only 12A, but within those limitations that's a 10S5P 60A  20Ah pack for $227.

For that kind of money I decided it was worth the risk.

As always, no association, just passing along a good deal.

Reporting back!

The bad news is they are not 20700's as they advertised originally (they have since corrected), they are 21700's.  This required re-vamping my battery holders and I'm going to have to raise the trucks a little bit because I'm scraping bottom a bit too often for comfort.

The good news is they are perfectly good batteries in terms of capacity.  I have 10S5P on a single motor (Tacon Bigfoot) running thanes and VESC6 and I have already taken them 18 miles on flat and wrapped up at 36.9v, which means I have more than half the capacity remaining.

I mathed out that in this configuration this is a 43 mile pack.

So this was well worth the $250, esp. if you're looking for something cheap for your MTB build where size and weight don't matter.

Wow that is a pretty great price for a large 21700 pack!
I spent $250 on a 12S4P w/ Samsung 25R + 80A BMS and 3 A charger. (Nkon u-tabbed @â‚¬2.4)
And I'm only expecting 20 miles of range so that doesn't look half bad.
