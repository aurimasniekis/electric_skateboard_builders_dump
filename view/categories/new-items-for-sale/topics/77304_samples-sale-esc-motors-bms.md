Sorry @hyperIon1we don't allow FnF sales through the forum. These types of sales provide no recourse to a buyer if a vendor does not follow through with shipment or if there is a problem.

I would, but you can get them for $75 + free shipping on ebay so it ends up being basically the same

Also don't really have the spare money with christmas and all

maytech duel 50a esc 120$ 2 avaliable

How does this perform compared to the flipsky dual 4.20? Is that the can bus cable (black and white) between the 2 vescs?

## \#37 Posted by: hyperIon1 Posted at: 2018-12-08T19:26:27.682Z Reads: 124

```
the one pictured is a BETA test unit, its PCB is green and the production ones are black. 
correct that is the can-bus external. 
it's simply 2 on 1 PCB with only combined power in/ soft switch
as for comparing to the flip duel 4.20 the difference would be in individual components used to manufacture each.
 They are clones of a different origin in essence

Sorry for a bit off-topic. But does anyone know if the sensor cable on these Maytech will connect properly with VESC and not frying it?
@hyperIon1 did you test the sensors with VESC?
