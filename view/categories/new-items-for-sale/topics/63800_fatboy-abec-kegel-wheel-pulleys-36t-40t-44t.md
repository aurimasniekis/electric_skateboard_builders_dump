[/quote]

Metroboard pullies are this way already but they have a weird quirk where there are 2 total bearings, 1 in the wheel and 1 in the pulley.  Which is not as good as 2 in the wheel and 1 or 2 in the pulley.

These come with 8mm bearing, if you grab skate bearings for 10mm and replace it would fit 10mm. I am not 100% about Evolve truck at general as I don't have evolve anymore to test it out but axle should work if bearing replaced.

That was the size that was already pseudo-available so it was lower priority.  Plus bigger wheel pulley is never an issue because you can always use *more* teeth on the motor pulley, but not the other way around.

Just realized that I wanted to make sure, is the bearing on the gear is blocked or it moves in & out? Picture of example of evolve abec gear, I can't see the picture of your gear on the that angle. The issue is when I try to tighten the nut on axel the bearing is being pushed out and the wheel being pushed in so the wheel then touches the motor pulley. You understand what I mean. Any idea ![IMG_20180809_001346|375x500](upload://5S2KSFWGwux3xtpfJ2pqqcnfnLv.jpg)

Bearing shouldn't pop from the front as its held by the lip. You will need to change bearing to 10mm if you want to use it on Evolve hanger.

Requirements for this pulley is:

Max hanger size is 28mm
Min hanger axle length is 40mm

I wanted 36T gear but I Never thought you will make one, well I lost patience then bought the lowest teeth which was 40T few days ago. The 36T seems like. Common for skateboard so why did you start with 40T? 44T is just too much.. I don't if you ridden electric skateboard but that 44T will decrease speed. Don't need much torque because these motors are powerful can give enough torque even on 36T.

We started with 40T and 44T because people asked for them, and then I got request for 36T version too so on the same go made them too.

Also like I was saying to people before, you can always get bigger motor pulley, more tooths, less skipping..

I would need the Kegel pulley bolt on istead of push fit. I like those really and I am going to add threads to the stubs and machine a counter plate such that I can bolt them on. I don‚Äôt have a long enough axle to accomodate a third bearing. Ideally 5 of 10 stubs would be threads then people can decide whether bolt on or push fit ...

Really wanna order some. They look great 
But seeing my build isn't done I have no idea what pully setup I'll be ruining. 
I have 36t and 40t but I have no idea what it's like to ride any other board then my R1. Don't feel like I can compare what I'm building to what I bought.
Hopefully they don't sell out

Bravo, sir. I've been wanting an aluminum insert pulley. 

Once i get my new trucks in i want to see if these will fit with my motors and mounts. Should be gucci. 

Any hope for a 32 T? or would that small of a variant cause problems with the bolt patterns?

Bought them 32t abec11 last year. You have to vit a bit the Caliber trucks.

Some announcements so that people don't start telling we copied or etc. We are making pulleys for our wheel hubs both Trampa version and longboard (TB218, FB230, FB240) and would also fit Trampa SuperStar wheel hubs. No standoff adapters required.

It will be available in 66T version.

So they supposedly fit, but would I be able to use the evolve 260-5m-15 belt? Evolve currently sells 2 belt sizes, 250 for the 32T gear, and 260 for the 38T gear.

Evolve says their 38T gears should be in stock any day now so its decision time lol

If it's too long though you will need to move down to 255mm

Good question...I used 3 of the M10 flat washer they are 2mm thick... I tried a different one which was about 1.40mm thick and that doesn‚Äôt seem like much but when adding 3 together made a big difference in the space needed... so the ones I used along with the o.g 10mm speed ring gave the exact spacing needed to line the drive gear with the motor gear as if it was stock...![image|374x500](upload://dc3E0rkSLo9Pt2gnvn2zECPKTK5.jpeg)

Have you read the topic at least before posting? There was a discussion about using this pulley on the evolve hanger and it was mentioned that it needs to use washers. 

I can't tell from the picture but looks like you haven't inserted the pulley fully too.

It wasn't made to be evolve replacement.

Hole size wouldn't change the way it fits on axle also it's made bigger so people running bigger axles could still mount it.

Anodization would not change anything as it would rub it off the same as now it rubs off the aluminium. You running way to tight setup probably.

These pulleys are nice but the kegel ones are EXTREMELY tight-fitting in the wheel.  Like, get a sledge hammer to install them, and hope you don't ever have to put them in a different wheel or change the bearings.

Hi! Holes on my wheels look narrow and I'm not sure if pins on the pulleys will fit. I have 3d model of pulley with pins which are exactly fits. Can you compare it if I sent it to you and let me know if it's ok pls?![IMG_20191216_090049|666x500](upload://wnJAWvDeaqkbRvRI81cY7rBMQMa.jpeg)
