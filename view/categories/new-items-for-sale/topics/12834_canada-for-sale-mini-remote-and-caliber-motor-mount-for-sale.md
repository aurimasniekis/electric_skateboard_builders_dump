I've got two new items for sale:

$50 CAD for mini remote like the one here:
diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/torqueboards-2-4ghz-mini-remote-controller/

$60 CAD for 30mm motor mount for Caliber Trucks from here:
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/motor-mounts-45-00-free-shipping-50xx-ollin-and-50-00-63xx/9859

Plus actual shipping costs.

Prefer to sell to someone in Canada since shipping is cheaper/easier.

I read this thread topic and thought i could pick up Canada while it was on sale.  I was planning to buy it then charge $5 admission and grant automatic citizenship to anyone who flees to there from the US.

Don't need the controller or mounts, but I could definitely use Canada if it's still available. What condition is it in?
