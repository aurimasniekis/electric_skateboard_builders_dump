**108 mm wheels by Pramash, 76A durometer, US $ 129 dolar set of four (4).**

Big smooth 108 mm wheels allow it to ride faster and easily go over any terrain. These wheels are good for long distance push. The wheels have the exact same 8 millimeter bearings as the regular wheel bearings so you can use them on any other trucks. 

The earlier you order, early shipping priority you get. Order now to get higher priority! 
Second batch estimated shipping dates will be end of November 2017
