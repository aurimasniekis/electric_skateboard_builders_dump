Details on OESC? That's a heatsink, right? Did you implement any of the improvements on 4.12?
```

OESC is a double layer VESC will all the MosFETS on one side and an aluminum heatsink for cooling and protection.

Before shipping them, I personally program and test each one on a 12S 6374 Sensored Motor setup.

They come with a single replacement warranty if used with my batteries and motors. If you do not use my products I still offer support and can usually repair or replace for a fee. I also offer email support to help you with settings for your personal build dependent on motor and batteries you want to use.

Here is pic of it without the heatshrink and separated from the heatsink.

If you would like more details feel free to always reach out via email or pm.

@mmaner @Mikenopolis  thanks for the support guys!

I was thinking of shuffling the days bringing the batteries to day 7 and 8 and moving the hub motors and Carbon S up, since those won't ship till Jan.

Would love to hear if more people are interested in moving the batteries sooner, let me know and I'll update the deals tonight.

Also been super busy today with yesterday's orders haven't had a chance to update the thread today.

Day 5 Deal - Small Remote just $45!

[/quote]

Sounds good either way. Just make sure you don't post them on the weekend since I'm with my daughter all the time and don't use my phone and computer much!

I assume I would still be able to add in the power switch w/LCD and charge port to the order?

I second that. I just picked it up at the post office this morning. Using USPS for huge battery eh @oriol360? As I was waiting for them to get the box, the the lady next to me was being asked if there were lithium batteries in the box she was sending out. Ironic
