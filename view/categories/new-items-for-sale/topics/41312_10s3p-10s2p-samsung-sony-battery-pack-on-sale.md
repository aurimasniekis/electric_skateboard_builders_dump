Nice to see asian factories getting up to date with the 30Q cell.

But if you´re using a 10s3p, you should not limit your board with a small BMS like that.
10s3p is able to deliver up to 60A continous, so optimum would be a 60A BMS.

Yes we can customize continuous 60A BMS as request. Continuous 25A works with our hub motor and esc.

No, I just asked for the details. They do not even ship them to Norway, so its out of the question for me. To weak bms also.
