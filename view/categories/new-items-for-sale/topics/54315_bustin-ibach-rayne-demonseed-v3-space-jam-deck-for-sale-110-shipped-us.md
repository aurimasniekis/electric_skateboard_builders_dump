Just to clearify witch deck are you interested in?
I‚Äôm assuming the bamboo x ibach. It was shipped with another deck. But yes I do have the box it was shipped in. 
And yes. The shipping is 70 because of the size. If it was a 12x12 box would be way less. 
So I can ship to you for 170.00.
I can invoice you through PayPal. 
And ship it out Friday. 
Let me know what you want to do. 
Thanks

Let me check with my brother on that. I do apologize I assumed you meant one. It would be a great deal but that shipping 68$ is for one. I‚Äôm sure the charge doesn‚Äôt  go down when you double the weight. 
We can shop around for shipping that‚Äôs more cost effective but maybe slower and without tracking. 
Let me see what I can do. Ok.
Thanks
