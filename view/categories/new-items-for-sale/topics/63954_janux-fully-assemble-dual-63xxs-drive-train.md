Dual POM idlers reduce the need for over-tensioning belts that causes premature breakage.  Use of slack side Idlers prevent ‚Äútooth skipping‚Äù and improve breaking.  Second idler further dials in to achieve proper belt tension.  These are custom made in-house in San Diego, CA. from solid round of Acetal Delrin.

Motor arms can be adjusted axially at fixed 0¬∫, ¬±12¬∫, and ¬±24¬∫, no more slippage of motor arm.  It can be installed forward under the deck for stealth or reversed for a cool hot rod look.  

The dual idler, dual motor mount is sported with twin ‚ÄúJanux Flux Drive‚Äù 6354s 190kv.  The high performance Semi-Sealed high motors are rated at 2800W each, perfectly compliment to your 6S-12S battery pack.  Connections are done with 5.5mm gold plated bullet connectors and VESC 4 Hall Sensor connector, no adapter needed to your FocBoxes.

‚ÄúBlack Out‚Äù complete drive train comes with the highly acclamined Kegel Orangatang 80mm - 80a durometer wheels.  Couple with 15/36t pulleys and 15mm wide belts, there is nothing this drive train can‚Äôt handle.

Platforms with established brands.  Well done.  Good price point too.  Mount design is so much better than previous aesthetically speaking.  Would be interested in a wider mount set up for 6374 and over.

Holy shit dude?!
Please make all your aluminum parts anodized! It beats painting it black!
Thankfully my dual mounts from you are getting beat up because the kegels make them so close to the ground. Once i get 100mm wheels i'll get a set of these! You're doing God's work Marc!

Quality DIY eskate at this point: 

1: buy battery... diyelectricskateboard 12S4P w/ 60A BMS or psychotiller battery and psychotiller / eboosted enclosure.... Im sure I've missed other reputable builders, let me know... Is Bara still building batteries or is he full enertion at this point? His website was down...

2: buy "drivetrain" **chhheeeeeeeseee** üòéüòÅ

3: pick ESCs and remote

4: bolt to kick-ass deck of your choosing.

I like. Need to get the word out. More like Legos than even half a year ago. Thanks for doing *goods* work Marc.

There's not enough length room unfortunately. dual 6355 on caliber 10" leaves only a few mm of gap.

However, this [drive system](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/spiral-bevel-gears-gearbox/65255/15) is able to do dual 63XX, but not available to buy yet

The truck is Cal II 10".  Mount has enough clearance to fit dual 6354/6355 motors but not 6374s.  I have 2 different dual motor mount systems, one with Xbars and one without.  Check out my website Janux-esk8.com for reference.

Those look like they come with 2 wheels instead of 4?  That will be a major pain.  They should come with 0 or 4 wheels ;-)

Wheels are almost always sold in sets of 4, so someone has to buy 4 more to have front wheels, then they'd have 6 total
