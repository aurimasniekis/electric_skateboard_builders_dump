Hey folks, 

I managed to slot in something I had on my TODO list. These are motor mounts made out of AL7075 black anodized for Evolve SuperCarve trucks. You can fit 63m motors on these babies.

I'm planning to produce few of them if any interest.

Oh shit. 

Now i really want a used bamboo gtx. 

they take 40 cells. Doesn't say i can't put 39 in there. You do the math on what that means when i throw a set of my totally bitchins on here and dump the shit ESC for a pair of focboxes.....

Evolve has really shitty tolerance (i.e a lot of play in the parts when not screwed) and I'm looking for really low tolerance.

If someone has the Gen2 specs for the distance of the 3 holes that makes a "triangle" I can easily update the design. It's 29mm on Gen3

Measured 19/16 inches about six times previously.  I took 19/16*25.4 = 31.1625mm

Yes @barajabali. But the thing is I've been working with @marcmt88 for a while giving him the feedback (measures) for the custom mount design of my trucks. Although this new mounts certainly come in handy I'm obliged by heart with Marc. He is a great guy always trying to please the costumers wishes. He is been working really hard in developing his mount, receiving critiques, changing this and that and comming up with a great mount that not only will fit the Evolve truck but Calibers, Paris, Enertion, and many more. Really a custom mount maker like you cannot find here often.

Dont forget to measure entire truck's lenght. I'm intrigued about this Gen 3 trucks (??) Mines are 306 mm in lenght, or 30 cms with 6 mm (12" inches). That is a measure from tip axle to tip axle. The hanger lenght is somewhat in the order of 25 cms. or 10" inches.

Like to know if yours are longer truck's than mine. If they are I will think about a future change.

Off course man, you are next in my list. Right now I'm sorting out the motor/mount dilema. Seems that the Ollinboard 5065 170kv are out of stock. They only have the 200kv versi√≥n. So that changed my priority. I then focused muy attention at this chinese motors....

ZWN-6030 QB brushless motor (59 mm x 73mm) ...5100 rpm ... 36DVC ... <50A ... 1600W  (I deducted they are 141 kv, right?) 

...but a complicated 3 screw platform mount, US$ 210 expensive 2 motor buy, low wattage and uncertain kv specs prevented this buy.

For the same price I can get (2) APS 6373 Aliens, right? So this are the motors 'am focusing my attention right now. What do you think?

So they are the same lenght (305 -306 mm). Now the plates holes distance, that the question here (??) ..also the distance between plate needs to verify.

@onepunchboard I have looked into this. I have a spare evolve mount and a motor. But the original mounting holes are just too far away. The new holes you would need to drill are really close to the edge of the original motor mount. There would be way too little metal left. One big bump and drop and I fear it would break. Same thing with a Torqueboard mount. But maybe I am missing something obvious.

Thanks guys for the support. I've modified like 0.15mm to get a total perfect fit (on the triangle holes) but it's a game play has evolve have a love for high tolerance parts. I should be getting the parts in 10 days. Actually in a kitesurfing trip in Brazil. My day to day life is more on the water 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BbrBUiHh2AB/?taken-by=esk8fr

Once I got back home in 5 days, I'll be able to launch a mass production on these and rock n roll !

If for some reasons you have a special request, I can modify the design and make it fit to your needs :slight_smile:

Once I confirm which one fits better the Evolve trucks (for the holes) I'll launch mass production ! I think I'll also be able to have some different colors for anodizing if people want another color than matte black.

hey fam, here we go. I received the new limited batch of mounts today and I'm happy with it. This limited set of 63mm compatible mounts for Evolve SuperCarve Trucks were sold in minutes and will be shipped tomorrow morning to different areas which include Australia, USA, Germany. I'm going to launch a new production to meet the demand. 

You can already reserve yours as of now. I'll get them mid january in quality.

Oh they are very good (price is awesome as well) but sometimes I would like more top speed. I could upgrade to racerstar 5065 200kv variant but I‚Äôve always wanted 63xx motors and up until now u just couldn‚Äôt fit any without making your own mounting plate. I‚Äôve also never tried 6355s and with 190kv I can lower motor pulley to 14T and get more torque so that (maybe) it‚Äôs a bit more efficient while also gaining some top speed. and if there‚Äôs not much difference, I can always switch back and use the 63s on a second build in the future.

The initial version was made for a specific street build sensorless (6355 or SK), but some of the riders wanted to use sensored 6374, so I took the opportunity to get also batches of 6374 150kv sensored and upgraded the mount to make full AT possible, or full street with a huge amount of combos. I added 4mm of extend and reworked the motor mount sliders. I also increase of 1mm it's size which is even stronger (but well that was not necessary)

@okp,

Super dope! I ordered some and tracking is showing its on its way! Super excited.. Motors just got here today and they are HUGE lol I really wanted to have the motors under the board instead of behind the board.. do you think that would be possible with your mounts??

## \#69 Posted by: okp Posted at: 2018-04-06T06:59:48.488Z Reads: 220

hehe, well it is but you need to use SK motors if I'm correct and you need to ask me (when I launch the batch as it's done by the supplier) for a version without the holes; this way you can drill them yourself.

The mounts have seen a lot of interest, can't wait to see people riding them and reporting back. That's really nothing about business but just being proud to have riders around the world riding my parts and combining them with other builders parts, like @fottaz or @bigben or @longhairedboy or street wing ! It's all about diversity.

we love UNiK mounts. Every other mount we've used  has had issues. These mounts you and I worked on for me with my branding have zero issues. Zero. 

I finally don't have to worry about mounts anymore because you rock so hard. 

I expect that these mentioned in this thread are most likely just as awesome, and when people ask me about putting larger motors on the evolves, i mention these as an option first. I'm hoping that i can get to the point where i can buy several sets just to have on hand for evolve upgrades using my motors.

I use V1 with ATs and 15t / 66t (and exact same motors as in that picture).

Edited: just remembered I modded mine a bit to be able to pull them back more and get proper tension on the belts (not needed with a variety of other motors but was needed with mine):

![image|666x500](upload://eYfS7FqnsLYOlU7cUDKBt2wqOrJ.jpeg)![image|690x460](upload://3h2cDwBD39T45crSSGhNQSKZVHv.jpeg)

(Note the outer lip shaved off)

The v2 (that I literally received 10 mins ago, thanks @okp ) allow for more travel on these kind of motors so no modifications are needed.

You have literally copied my mounts without even asking any permission. Is it how you show respect to people that support the global community for years ?

Do you really believe that you will achieve trust and respect by doing that ? You even stole the images from my site.

Friends,

We fully recognize that parts are not "patented", there's only so many ways to make them, etc. - and we also know the price to our community is way more than a handful of dollars.  

@okp's mounts have been purchased by most of us in this thread (and some of us have resold @okp's mounts here, on our forum).  

I love Cedric's designs (he was the true art in UNIK) and as others have stated here, @okp's quality has always been top-shelf.

@hyperIon1 @hyperIon2 Cory, Ben, is it possible for you guys to alter your next order of mounts to look a little less like @okp's?

As an example, @Rithblu did a fantastic job, here (I love the ATC look and I have been waiting for his mounts to come back in stock personally for my LY Drop Cat):

![fullsizeoutput_2328|666x500](upload://z2FaPmlsxg03Twp088PqnglTCmt.jpeg) ![fullsizeoutput_232b|666x500](upload://c3PMUxsJGLkSREPWuHfRGqCAP1g.jpeg) 

![02%20AM|545x500](upload://xkfJj6O4BJYQdpqh6coXv6yasLv.png) 

If the new Hyperion mounts could be altered a bit so they do not photograph exactly like the UNIK mounts, I think we can all get back to growing and pushing forward, together.  

The bond in our community isn't about patents, design or intellectual property; we're here to take care of our friends, customers and/or fans, keep them esk8'ing, so they in turn inspire others and we all benefit as our community continues to grow.  

As always, happy to chat by phone to hug it out so we can find a win-win for the community, if you guys would like (Cedric has my number).

I am stoked for Hyperion's new MBS-first play; so stoked, in fact, that I did not launch this or import Maytech motors for it, so I would not disrupt Hyperion's launch:

![fullsizeoutput_231c|690x373](upload://aXk94O420lPla9DwBQ4AZRCRUjB.jpeg) 

When we look out for one another, the community wins.  LMK if I can help.

exactly. This is not even about patenting or whatever. It's about showing respect to people that have been moving their asses for the community on a daily basis for years. 

These guys have been made aware of that (see post above) and commented that these were not my mounts. But at the same time they are using my images on their site. So it's always good to smooth things, but there is a difference between smoothing thing when you have been made aware or just ignoring it which is what these guys did.

That's the kind of attitude no-one should support and I'll fight against that, even if it has to cost me a travel to Austin to make sure this situation never happens again.

Thank you for your thoughts and if everything was looked at in context and not just the immediate reaction to plagiary, it isn't justified when at one time we did resell his mounts. Now I have apologized to him, taken down his picture and won't make anymore. Wasn't planning on it until recently, but not worth it. 
And so far the pillar of the community has stated his intentions to purchase a ticket to Austin and take care of me or Us. How exactly am I to take that as a brunch invitation? 

Now we are all entitled to an opinion, I can take it. I just dont lay down when barked at for any reason. Maybe if I was given adequate time to correct this may be a different response would have been forthcoming.  Perspective has a place as well and my perspective can and will differ from most especially when all the info isn't in hand.

Thank you.  All of you.

I consider @treenutter Jamie, as with @okp and @psychotiller and @winfly and @Sender and @mmaner and _several_ more of you, lifelong friends.  If Jamie needed me to help him move his family, I'd buy a plane ticket.

If I build 500 Vulkanik Kaijus and sell 12S4P dual 6374 completes for $1799 - am I helping the community, or just myself?  I'd be straight-up competing with my friends, makes no sense.

Just speaking as a dude, what right do I have to interrupt the Hyperion Bros. relaunch with something as pedantic as a group buy?  Cory and I discussed motors a while back and I made it clear: you guys always have right-of-way.

This happens, believe it or not, quite a bit.  I've had the @evoheyax board here at my home for a month, @mikenyc sent me a link he found on Alibaba months ago (Mike and I buy stuff for no reason all the time lol), I received it and already had prepped to redesign when @Winfly told me this design was spoken for, by a total stranger in our community that I owe nothing to. 

I halted work immediately with nothing but good wishes for @evoheyax - the money and time I wasted is in fact, the price of community.  I am positively honored to be working with established brands like Trampa and new brands like MasterCarve and I do this for free, and I do not accept free equipment from friends.  This is the price to keep this community going.

Recently, Jamie reminded me that once upon a time, here, if one wanted motor mounts that they had to /make/ them.  Respect.

Let's always keep in mind where we came from, as we all shape the future of esk8 together.  

Love you guys, be good.

Just we are all clear. I've not seen any agreement going through my eyes that Cory and his brother had the right to resell my mounts. Unless I'm wrong - and I could be - there is a complete difference between an end user customer buying something and selling it, and a reseller. 

I usually deal stuff face to face with facts and sometimes taking a plane to deal F2F with people helps more than anything else (people tend to always see brutality or fightclub behind but talking to people F2F is often very positive, especially because it removes a lot of barriers). That's how you gain integrity and trust over years. I had my own battles too and I failed and also lost few of them. It's human nature.

I fully accept your apologies and suggest to move on. I was preparing a big announcement soon to the community anyway but I need to find time for that. Lately I've been chasing time between the baby, the work, Paris event, videos and some insane food intoxication.

Stay tuned and ride on !

Are you coming to CO?

You need to try this thing.  Hopefully I have some 110s by then...

Or 111s.... if you know what I mean... surely you do of all people.

all I can share is the 111 is truly a new thing - it's not just thane in a pretty shape, it is purposefully designed and formulated purely for esk8, without compromise - and if there's a better way to debut the 111 than on a SenderSkates build, I don't know of it. :)

Empty spaces, what are we living for? Abandoned places, I guess we know the score.

Can anybody tell me if the 63mm Evolve mounts could fit the 50mm Maytech motors? I bought a pair of 5065 170KV sealed Maytech motors from Hyperion a little while back and haven't had any luck sourcing mounts for them to work with the Evolve trucks, let alone they've stopped responding as soon as I mentioned the word refund despite the motors sitting safely in bubble wrap/boxes being basically untouched since receiving them, so still in perfect condition for resale.

Just had a look through his, unfortunately way too pricey for me being in Australia. Torque Boards just confirmed for me that they'll have compatible mounts available in a month so I'll get by on my Racerstars until then.
