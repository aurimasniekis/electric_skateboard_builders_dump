Aw great price. Just bought the unsealed version though so sadly I must pass this onto the next lucky bastard. 
Unless you wanna trade for the mini rc trigger remote which I highly doubt.

They do with 80x10mm axle. @bigben Can you confirm this?
Maybe theyâ€™ll fit on 70x10mm too?

My other concern is that I found that in order to use bkb push fit pulleys, I'll need 90mm axles. I would really like to use shorter axles on tayto deck

Do you know the overall length of these cans with the nipples on the end? I found it pretty tight with the true 6374mm cans. That was with 80mm axles. I was using sixshooters with over 15mm pulleys though and the pulley bolts were close. @sender has had a setup like this on his lacroix I think or of course @mmaner Mr @psychotiller himself would undoubtedly know the way forward.

These motors are 74mm from face of can to end of nipple. Psychotiller mounts, sixshooters and 15mm belts so 18mm or so pulley. 80mm axles.

I have TB 6374's on my bludgeon build, using SR TOPs with 90mm axles and 25mm pulleys and belts.  THere is about 2.5mm between the cans.

its pretty much overkill, but it never slips.  take a lot of what hours to turn those belts though.  with 15mm belts I use 22 wh per mile, with 25mm belts I use 28 wh per mile.
```

28wh seems a lot, Im interested how much wh will my a chain setup use probably less since the tensions is a lot smaller 

Hopefully I will have those numbers really soon

That is per motor right?

Im also running 6in numies, so that means a lot of WH usage right there.

@mmaner those are some hefty belts.. I doubt you'll have any stripped/broken belts. lol Maybe should have went even wider :laughing:

Your joking right?  If I went any wider the 4mm between the motor cans would disappear really fast :slight_smile:.
