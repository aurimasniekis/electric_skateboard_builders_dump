Retails at 540 EUROS not GBP. You're selling it for £80 off, not 140.
Not only this, but unassembled currently the same or very close to the same thing can be purchased for about £450 new from their site.

It’s £540 once you add the cost of the belt and pulley guards (€30) and cost of the front truck (€30) so the saving is £140?

I’ll also add this is unused so brand new and assembled.

You never said you had a front truck, or front wheels? 
Also that cost unassembled includes belt guards.
