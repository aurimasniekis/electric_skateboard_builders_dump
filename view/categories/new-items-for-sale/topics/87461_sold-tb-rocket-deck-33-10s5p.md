As the title states, I have a TB Rocket (Deck) + 10s5p for sale, the deck was never ridden (but the grip tape has a few scrapes along with the CF deck) and the 10s5p has prob half a cycle on it so im calling it new.

The 10s5p was built specifically for the deck as normal you would only be able to fit 10s4p, the cells are Samsung 30Q welded by @psychotiller 

TB Rocket (Deck) 150$

Jeepers 15a

I don't know if Neptune supports up to 15a, but theyre 'rock solid'(-from endless sphere) at higher voltages like 13-18s

And it's 'smart' Bt connection and all that
