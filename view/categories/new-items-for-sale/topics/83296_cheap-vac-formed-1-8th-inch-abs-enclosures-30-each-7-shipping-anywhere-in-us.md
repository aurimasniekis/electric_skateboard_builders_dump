Hey guys, I bought 24 sheets of ABS a few months ago. My local plastic supplier only cuts orders to size if I order a minimum amount and I can't fit 4'x8' sheets in my car.  I wanna get rid of this extra plastic I have laying around ASAP so I lowered my prices. Get 'em before they are gone!

I have 6 different molds for enclosures:

- 1.5"x5.5"x19" for concave decks (Fits 12s5p & 2 ESCs)
- 1.5"x5.5"x19" for flat decks (Fits 12s5p & 2 ESCs)
- 1.5"x5.5"x19" for Landyachtz 38 Switchblade (Fits 12s5p & 2 ESCs)
- Low Profile 1"x5.5"x19" for flat decks (Fits 12s3p & 2 ESCs)
- Mini 1.5"x5.5"x10"  for flat decks

I only have the mold for the mini, no pictures at the moment but I can make one this weekend so I can post pics of it.

Will look almost exactly like the pics I posted just 9" shorter.

Yeah, but I have to charge more because making a mold is a lot of work. What are you looking for? I’ll give you a quick quote.

UPDATE: I am nearly done with everyone’s enclosure who has already paid. They are on track to ship out on Monday.

I will do just ONE MORE round of enclosures, but after that I will be far too busy with school to keep this up. Message me before next week Sunday (Feb 17th) if you want to get in on the last round of enclosures.

```
Honestly, I don’t know because I don’t own a 40 switchblade so I don’t know how much the bottom of the deck differs.

That being said, if you add 1/2 inch foam weatherstripping, it should fit just fine even if the enclosure doesn’t perfectly conform to the deck.

```
Before I made my own, I used an enclosure meant for a concave deck on my switchblade and I just had to add an extra layer of weatherstripping on the sides and it worked really well. It just goes to show that weatherstripping helps a lot even if the enclosure is nothing like the deck. Just not quite as pretty as one that perfectly conforms.

Here are all the enclosures I have left.  A couple have minor surface bubbling and webbing of the plastic as you can see in the pictures, but you can only really see them in direct light.  PM me if you want one!
