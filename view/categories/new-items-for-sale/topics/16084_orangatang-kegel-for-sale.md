Hey fellow E-Sk8 builders,

I have bought parts for my second build. Unfortunately due to finals and upcoming military duty, I am not able to finish my build. I would like to sell my parts, they haven't been used for rides, however some have modifications on it. I am based in Switzerland and I am willing to ship the parts internationally, however the buyer will have to pay for the shipping costs. If interested and regarding price or additional infos, please send me a message and I will respond as fast as possible. 
Parts can be bought as a package or individually.


First Item:

Hummie Hub Motors 200kv with 2 Paris Trucks and two additional tires for exchange. Soldered 4mm male connectors and heatshrinked them. Barely used.
