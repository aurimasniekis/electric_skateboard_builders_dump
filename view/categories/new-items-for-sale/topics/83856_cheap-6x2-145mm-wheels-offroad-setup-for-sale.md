That will be a game changer. It will put pneumatics on a lot more hands. 

BTW, looking at the design of the mounts, why do you remove so much material? Just for looks? Wouldn't it make the mount stronger to just leave as much material without increasing overall size.

For those who already have the cheap ass nummies.

Can verify these are quality! I've had them on my build for about two months now, haven't had any issues with them. The rubber is pretty dense, so no significant impact on range while being big enough to go over any crack or bump. It's a nice compromise between urethane and pneumatics. My board got ran over the other day too, trucks got bent (there was a car on it) but the wheels are fine.

I have two decks, the Vanguard clone for Diyeboard (which is probably the same as yours), it's a narrow deck ~8 inches with an ideal shape. I also have another one from skateshred that is 9.5 inches wide and I can get a touch of bite on my TB218 trucks (slightly wider) with 150mm wheels (essentially the same size) and loose bushings. So while your build worked out nice (and looks great ;) ) I think people should just consider that when picking a deck to use with this kit they need to be careful of width and shape. Decks are expensive to ship/return.

As you can see in the below photo, there's plenty of space between the motors.
My setup is dual 6355 with 15mm belts.
You should be able to fit standard 6374 motors, as long as they're not SK3's which I hear are longer.

Hey guys, I'm one of the people who's been running this setup for the past two months.
To answer a few questions I've seen in this thread.

In terms of handling and comfort, I haven't had the chance to try out true pneumatics so I can't speak to that, but I imagine those will give you a plushier ride. In return, since these wheels are pretty dense, while not as comfy as pneumatics, they are more comfortable than my 90mm 78A BKB wheels were, and I haven't noticed significant loss of range or efficiency. They give me great peace of mind when riding however, since my I don't have to be glued to the road surface as much, scanning for cracks or rocks. I had originally planned to use these only in the winter but I plan on sticking to these year round.

I don't know the weight of the wheels without a scale, but they are on the heavier side especially with the giant 60T wheel pulley in the rear, maybe I could convince dicky to make some cutouts in the pulley to reduce weight.

The wheels are about 1.6" wide, and the trucks are 8" long (the thick aluminum part) with 2" axles on each side, so total of 12 inches.

Based on the spacing of my setup with 15mm belts and 6355 motors, I would say you can fit most dual 6374 motors.

Another note, the bushing that come stock with these trucks are pretty bad (no offense to dicky), I've since swapped them out to Riptide Krank Barrel boardside and Street Barrel roadside, and it's been a much better experience. Do your own research on the new bushing though, since everyone is different.

My board is currently disassembled due to an accident last week, but I'll answer any questions I can.

How fast do you ride? I remember the last set of popular airless tires, many people were happy but it turned out they rode fairly slow. The fast riders found lots of vibration, and fell apart at speed.

My board is capable of 30mph, and I've ridden it at those speeds a couple times.
No issues with vibration or anything else, at least in my experience.
The ones you are talking about I believe had holes in them for shock absorption but also made them more prone to expanding at speed.

so I made a quick build using these wheels - I didn't try 30mph this build was purely to test bigger wheels with a tail - I liked the resistance on these, didn't feel like terrible rolling.

I bought a AWD set with 4 motors - didn't really buy this for the wheels they were just for science : ) wanted to try a 'cheap set' see if I liked the height.

EDIT: I really like the trucks and the mounts , I ran without loctite on them and no moving!

Thanks, Chris.  no problem to pointing out the nagetive side of the product, I do think this is a good way that I learn about what's bad of my stuffs.

by the way, the one you have was the fist sample, it got a little heavier than those comes later.
now the data is:
1 pc of 6X2 wheel   610g
1pc of 60T pulley  260g
1pc of 44T pulley 150g
1pc of extended truck 500g

Just to be clear I'm not defending the "Third Reich" or any of its actions. I actually know what happened and I know people who experienced the terror first hand. 

Uhhmm so the swastika was just associated with something bad bc of the "Third Reich". It actually is a pretty prominent symbol in multiple religions... :slight_smile:

What is the increase in power consumption? Will 1100 watts make it?

I don't know about that yet, haven't start building my board yet 
The wheels have cut for water, but they're definitely not made for deep all terrain stuff
Gravel and small dirt road should be fine

I think someone already tested the power consumption and it's not bad, because the wheel are quite hard (harder than real pneumatics)

1100 watts will get you going but you should maybe consider up that a little
What kind of motor is that ?

It will do I'm sure, you won't be able to climb trees but for easy riding it's okay

the motors seems good, I haven't test it so i don't know, and it's mostly after several hundred km that you see if a motor is good or not

one complain I must admit, the wire are too thin ! Maybe you can change that @dickyho

wire's size is to define the motor's KV.  not like some motors, they have a port to connect those 3 power wires to the 3 wires inside the motor.  my motors' power wires are let out directly from inside the motor. they are the same one as the inside wires.

That's the tricky part
A lot of drop down deck will work, as long as the wheel clearance is enough
Some top mount deck will work (with a little bit of riser), like the vanguard
I looking for a good drop through deck and damn that hard

[INSTANT EDIT (ninja)]
This is not the topic I thought, so it's not the right answer :joy:
But the angle is a thing you must think of, it might (not 100% sure) make the truck more turny but less stable at high speed
Also the wheel clearance is not that great here, if you're in the US look at Skateshred, it's in the same price range (look at the build Basic pneumatic board, it's good you'll see the clearance) 

Yeah it could work but there's several things : 
I would prefer a drop through, to install freebord binding (and have enough space between my feet, I'm quite tall
then the angle on both side might be a little weird, I don't know I really didn't fully understand the effect of angles on the behavior of trucks
Finally this is in the US, it's 45 euros for shipping, so too expensive :cry:

I recently got a metr pro and have been logging it everytime I use my skateboard. My average with the pneumatic wheel is 18wh/km. Dickyho is also selling those or will sell soon.

Iâ€™d imagine that caliber trucks would be a little narrow you might get wheel bite (of course it depends on your deck tho)

Hello guys,

I'm new here and happy to be part of this adventure. I was about to pull the trigger on a kit from @dickyho and after discussing with him he is not sure that it will fit with my deck:   https://www.localskateshop.de/en/mindless-complete-longboard-savage-iii-black-red-drop-through-39-75-x-10-0-inches-drop-through-professional-longboard-with-koston-ball-bearings/longboard-products/skateboard-completes/a-93314/#description

Can somebody give me some advice too?

From what I can tell I think you should be fine, the extra wide trucks make most decks ok in terms of clearance. For reference, I have a [drop through deck](https://www.skateshred.com/wholesale-blank-longboard-decks/wholesale-bamboo-drop-through-deck.html) as well that seems to be quite a bit wider, and I can't really get wheelbite unless I fully loosen bushings and lean all the way.

Hi.  so, axis 35mm on each side.  no,  that can not install this 6 inch airless wheel. need 42mm.
252mm truck is kind of narrow, not recommended with this big wheels.
