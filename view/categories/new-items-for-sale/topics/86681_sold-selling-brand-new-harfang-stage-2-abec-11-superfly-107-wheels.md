Hi Guys,

I'm selling my Harfangs. I have the Bergmeister wheels too but don't really see myself using these wheels instead of the bergs so they'll just keep lying around. I'd rather spend that money on something else.

I bought this from Muirskate for $150 + $50 shipping to CA + $80 CA for getting the treatment. 

Willing to part with these for $260 including shipping. Let me know if you're interested. Thanks!
