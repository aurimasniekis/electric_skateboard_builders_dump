i have 28 samsung 30q cells left. im selling them all for 4.50 a cell or if you wanna buy less than all then 5$/cell plus shipping. preferebly US, not really sure how to send them out of the country

The black marks are from electrical tape because these are the cells I used to design my pack they are in fact brand new and unused
