A local vape shop closed down and I was able to grab some cells from the owners. I have plenty of spares, so I'm selling them off here. 
**If you'd like to trade something for these, let me know as I'm looking for a few bits**

90 LG HG2 Cells - £2.50 Each (Fogstar wholesale = ~£3.55 Each, 30Qs are ~£2.70 each from FS)

Pictures of the HG2:

Shipping from the UK. The HG2s are in sets of 4, sealed in packets (8 have been unsealed), I plan to ship in padded envelopes which are stacked in a box with bubble wrap around that.

I will prioritise people who might want to buy more of them, because obviously I don't want to make too many trips to the post depot :) (Parcelforce shipped because batteries)

Can I ask why you bought these when you can get them from fogstar wholesale uk for cheaper?

Okay well the 30Qs are cheaper from me and so are the SANYO cells, fogstar wholesale does not include taxes unless you go to checkout.

I hate to be annoying, but where do you mean? 
I kind of need to sell to you guys because I have a broken leg, so I can't go to the post box 10 times a day selling single cells to vapers

You're selling undesirable, unknown origin cells for pennies less than reputable stores.

You might need to give it in buddy.

So you're saying they're not authentic, and where is selling them for pennies more?

How are HG2 cells undesirable?

Perhaps that's unfair. 

They are significantly less desirable. Are they authentic? Should we just take your word for it? You've always been so balanced and open minded, maybe we should.

Alright, well assuming they are authentic (I dont actually know, I don't mind tearing down a cell to check if anyone knows how to authenticate them. Given their source is a UK vape shop I'd assume they're legit though)

As for the price, fine, I'll lower the HG2 to £2.50 Each. Find me a vendor selling cheaper and ill lower it again, but i doubt one exists. Ill sell the other cells to vapers.
