Any reason why buying both is more expensive by 20 dollars? Seems counterintuitive if you wanna get rid of these.

idk where youre from but in US shipping from SF to NYC for a 2-day envelope that fits two vescs costs 7 dollars. Unless a canbus cable is worth more than 13, separating it out would make more sense if you want to sell both vescs at once. 

Personally not interested in the items but just tryin to help

i am from India and normal post said 15$ shipping and 5$ for canbus , vescs are already at so much low cost.

if you think about it both the prices are same

one vesc doesnt includes shipping while both does soo its not that much of difference i guess.

no worries, thanks for bringing this to attention

Without, but if you want heatsinks they won't cost much, around 2$ additional

I will do some reading on 4.12bom as I'm not sure what that is. I'm guessing it's just a firmware flash. Who makes these boards as I've seen several different brands with different warranties and different prices.

No, bom is list of materials as 4.1 version had different components on pcb and 4.12 had different for proper functioning of foc , mine is 4.12; its just the version of vesc

I don't suggest buying it. The whole PCB looks sketchy and components not even aligned correctly. Soldering also looks pretty bad somewhere is not even enough solder so I don't think it will even handle large currents, I would not trust it for 80$ bucks... Max 40$
