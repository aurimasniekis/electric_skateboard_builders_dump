Hello,

Around two weeks ago I just bought these kit from Ernesto. I was planning on doing a build, but then scratched it and picked up a second Kaly. They literally went straight to my shelf, and were only moved from the box and never used. Paid $250 to get them shipped to the bay area, (California).

Looking for a price around there and little lower so please shoot me offers. Looking for a medium TSG Pass, maybe a PayPal deal plus other goods you have that would work with my Kaly's? I'm looking for some new tires since I don't really like the grey Trampa ones. And really looking for a new charger for my board since my other one broke unfortunately.

United States only please

Thank You

Let me look at kaly's drawings.  If I can rework the hanger clamp I might be.
