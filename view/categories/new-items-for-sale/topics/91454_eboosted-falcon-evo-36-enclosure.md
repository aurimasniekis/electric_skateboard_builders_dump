It‚Äôs going to be really hard to ship it, it‚Äôll be over 49$ and I might as well just get a psychotiller since he is an hour away

100 USD for this is a good price, considered its brand new. This would get swooped up easily. Maybe you can get a mod to change the category to 'New items for sale' instead of used. Pictures would help greatly too
