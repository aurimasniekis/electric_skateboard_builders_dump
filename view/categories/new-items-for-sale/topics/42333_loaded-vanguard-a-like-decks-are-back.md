Hiya all! I was just wondering to see if anyone would be interested in some handmade (by me) loaded vanguard style decks? I have made these in the past with a press and they have come out amazingly but I stopped doing them for ages and wondered if anyone would be interested in buying any? because for budget builds these are fucking awesome. Iâ€™ll upload some photos tomorrow of a deck that I made a while ago that hasnâ€™t been sold yet and I am currently using one of these decks myself on a boosted clone build. Iâ€™ll enclose some images to this thread if people want. Shipping around the most of Europe is something around â‚¬9. The decks are made of Canadian ply but do have a bit of flex but itâ€™s just the right amount. They will be arched a bit (I donâ€™t know the technical term) and they wouldnâ€™t have a concave on the top. I can sell them in bulk for a cheaper price and for one single deck itâ€™s going to be around â‚¬25/â‚¬30. On the last decks I made, each deck took me around 3 hours of hand work (excluding the press time) so Iâ€™m really not making much after the expense of wood and materials! Iâ€™m just trying to give a little back to the community for everyone helping me so much over the time Iâ€™ve been apart of this amazing family!<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/0/70aaf990dc63dd3897a2c4072dd009b9cf59de5c.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/2/42f2815a085e0d26c465963c67def9352a811d28.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/0/70e43e0d8ea329712d2d9b68995a039550e2cf37.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/9/f936dfbcbf6b3d1c9004139d6e598046584388bf.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/e/8e4c8f50159d6c5f1a98de2ec5ab841835cf3126.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/4/14a706e7728dae035533544f163781040b5cfefa.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/8/98e24be62cb03923ea632f21ac2fcb5f2acdee9e.JPG" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/5/55728852c2117a983c0ec896e39d0d2ac345f828.JPG" width="666" height="500">

I like the idea but would be nice if you make it with a bamboo sheet on top and bottom and me middle ones Canadian maple

Itâ€™s a realt good idea and when i first planned to build the decks, I had that idea in mind. But if I did this then i would have to sell them for around â‚¬70, and at this price, a real Vanguard may as well be purchased

Would you ship internationally? Or would the shipping costs kill the value?

70â‚¬ is not cheap... Loaded vanguard goes around 175usd
I made some skateboard decks while ago with roarockit system and is really easy to use. 
They offer 1/16 sheets/ veneer of canadian maple cross and long grain and bamboo long grain, and better price if you buy bulk.

You cant use thin veeners because your deck would end up a lot heavier than loaded's vanguard...What loaded uses is 1 piece of vertically laminated bamboo...

@Charster10 do you plan using bamboo? because I dont think you can get in 30 euros with that, maybe if you wouldnt use fibreglass, but I wouldnt do that :)

Yeah thats not bamboo :/ How flexy are they? How thick is the deck? Weight? Does it have a concave, doosnt look like that...Any camber?

The decks just over 1cm thick. It is a little flexy but is rather stiff. I canâ€™t remeber the weight, Iâ€™ll weigh it up when I have time

At that thickness you should start thinking about making them with cutouts and an integrated enclosure.

Iâ€™d be able to do this easily, well I would be able to make he cut outs. The enclosures would have to be made by someone else or the buyer

Ok and what kind of wood are they made of? Do you use cross grains? What about the camber and concave? are there any?

Edit: You answered concave and camber in the 1st article...

Canadian Ply. Itâ€™s a nice solid wood, but the finish is beautiful once sanded

There is certainly demand for decks like these...but you would have to use maple veeners :) using fibrglass would be another advantage :) also adding concave would do a lot of magic...

I would 100% use maple or bamboo veneers but at this expense of it, I would rather just stick with how it is now, I donâ€™t see the advantage of using other materials when this one is pretty good

Edit: I would most likely be able to add a concave upon request. I can make other deck shapes upon request as well

Iâ€™ve been doing a bit of research and if someone wanted a bamboo veneer added to the deck I can do it for an extra cost, I think it was around Â£25

most dh boarders donâ€™t like it cause of how flexible it is. flex is no bueno for 45mph+.

stiff decks are great for high speed but flext decks (like the vanguard) are great for mid and low speeds and carving.

it all comes down to preference

I was refering to this http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/what-longboarders-think-about-electric-skateboards/41925
What I got from that is that deck with rocker make sense in our case (fast start and stop). :wink:
and concave of course :)

Yeah i agree, I mean the decks I build is in the middle, itâ€™s a little flexy but still pretty stiff. I can carve pretty well it on it but I guess your right because it is all about preference

I always feel like this when riding a deck shape like this <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/8/28bb198efa5c800a4ac92cefa8ab9679e6f6ecde.png" width="312" height="500">

Sorry for popping in late to this conversation but board construction is something that always interests me.
 
Loaded Vanguards are made up of vertical laminated bamboo and triaxial fiberglass epoxied to either side of the outer stack. Because of the Fiberglas construction the tensile strength of the board is greater. This lets you use a thinner core material. It's the thinness of the board that makes it lite and not the Bamboo material.

Making a horizontally laminated board to the same thickness as the Vanguard from 1/6" maple with fiberglass on the outside will achieve basically the same weight results. 

Both maple and bamboo are relatively the same weight. 
Believe it or not, birch is lighter than both of these materials.

Hey :) I am quite interested in this too, actually I have made a vanguard like deck from bamboo and fibreglass myself :) 

You are right in everything you said...

The problem in this topic was, that the guy was offering nice deck made out of the wood he did not know...which might be problematic since you dont know its strength, if it has any cross support and so on :) 

Doing vanguard like deck from vertically laminated maple could work, but it wouldnt have the bouncy feel of bamboo :) If you would use baltic birch, it would actually not be V-lam...and yea Birch is the ligtest of all free of them :) Some comapnies often use even lighter poplar...

Don't get those decks...
Already made a thread to warn people about @Charster10.  
Payed and then never received anything...

Never pay friends and family at least...
