Hey everybody!

I've been getting some interest in the decks I've made and wanted to open this up to the community in case anyone else is interested. 
I am available for commissions on any custom deck work including duplicates of the Komodo eboards I am in progress of building. 

So far I have the Komodo longboard and Komodo mountainboard platform, both complete with grip that I am able to duplicate for set prices, and any custom work for a negotiable price based on materials and labor

>Komodo Longboard Deck - $150 USD + shipping

>Komodo MTB Deck - $USD + shipping
NOTE: The deck I use to build the MTB has been discontinued, so until I can find a suitable replacement there is only the Komodo longboard available, sorry :nauseated_face:

I am open to alterations in color, amount of visible stained wood, grip tape design or custom lettering (shown on MTB) while still retaining set price (as long as requested changes require no additional material)


Deck info:

Longboard is 7ply Hardwood Maple 40in x 10.3in little to no flex with 175lb rider, mild flex with 200lb

MTB is layered with [Bamboo/Fiberglass/Maple/Fiberglass/Bamboo] and measures 35.5in x 8.5in(widest) or 6.6in(narrowest) and has moderate to lots of flex depending on foot placement on the deck. Example, lots of flex at center of deck, low/moderate flex at usual binding placement closer to the tip angles. Tips are 20deg angles. Comes predrilled for bindings. 

NOTE: The deck I use to build the MTB has been discontinued, so until I can find a suitable replacement there is only the Komodo longboard available, sorry :face_vomiting:

Nice that would look pretty close to the one I've got. Way cheaper too, especially with bulk pricing.
Let me know how the quality is when you get it @MannyM0E :+1:

Nice I'm pretty sure those are the same trucks I have. They are from Maytech if I'm not mistaken and they are pretty robust. Build quality isn't perfect but they work well so far

The deck I used to make that exact board was unfortunately discontinued recently and I only know of one store that still has one or two left and they are asking $200 each for just the stock deck, so after I put work into it it'll be ~$300, and that's if I can get my hands on one before they vanish
However @TarzanHBK found a similar deck that I could make look almost identical to the Komodo MTB and it's only $78 stock, so I could do $175+shipping for one of those :+1:

No pics of diy's board yet since I just became aware of it, but it will look very similar. And yes that's the one I'd be using at the 175 price point. I want to get my hands on one to test its durability before I start sending them out tho.
I resurface the deck for painting, fill any cracks or holes, stain and seal the wood (usually, i couldn't get the stain to work on the MTB since the bamboo was actually laminated so I went with all black), design create and place the stenciling, cut out the lettering and resurface for painting, paint (multiple coats with sanding for durability), then clear coat the deck and apply grip

What is the diameter of the axles on your spring trucks? 12mm, 10 mm or 8mm?
```

## \#13 Posted by: 257 Posted at: 2018-03-11T18:54:35.751Z Reads: 193

~10mm. Mine required light filing to fit bearings on so it's not a perfect 10mm

No I never ended up buying one to test out.. if I remember correctly the shipping was ridiculous from diyeboard so I looked into pressing my own version of it. 

I have a deck press built now that can duplicate the pro 90 I just haven’t done much with it yet. If there’s interest I could look into making a few for cheap as a test run

You got any pics of your press? I'm about to start pressing some decks over here too and I am very interested in making a MTB next.

Please consider me interested. Though I understand if it's not worth the hassle if I'm the only one. I'd take two though, been waiting in vain for MBS to restock.

Thats perfect!

How many ply's did you go with on the final one? I'm going to start pressing decks soon in my garage, its always exciting to see how other people do it!

I want to try my hand at a eMTB but I've never had my hands on one!

Right? I couldn’t believe they quit making such a nice deck! I think if I can get interest in like 6 or so I can get the veneer for a decent price. That’s the only limiting factor is I don’t have a good place to get the veneer

![image|375x500](upload://pSHxIyBrGSvSGRN9f6AGJXR1JCu.jpeg) The first one I did 7 plys of Canadian maple and one sheet of powerlam so 8 total but it had the stiffness of a 9 ply. I think I’d like to try using more cross band sheets this time to cut down on the stiffness

one sheet of powerlam

I've never heard of this stuff.....research commencing.

I was wondering about how well just maple on its own would stand up to the abuse eMTB's go through.

Check out roarockit if you haven’t already. They’re great for doing one or two decks at a time. 
https://www.roarockit.com/veneer/

That’s where I got the veneer and powerlam for the first one. The maple they sell is pretty damn nice, I think 7+ plies would hold up well to hill bashing and rough terrain

I was going to buy through them, but I found a company that its about 3 hours from my parents house, about 11 hours from me. They will give me what ever combo of veneer I want for a really good deal. I wonder if they have the powerlam stuff or something similar to it.

I just need to figure out the shapes that people like on eMTB. Seems like there are only a few brands that everyone sticks with around here. Did you just hand make your template or were you basing it off of something else?

Nice! Mind sharing their info? 

I drew up the template in autocad based more or less on the mbs pro 90 and adjusted it for a forum member who asked for a custom version of it. The press makes the regular pro 90 shape, but it also has room for extra features like a 7” kick tail and grab handles. 

I think the biggest thing to pay attention to about the shape of a mtb deck is the tip angles and what kind of trucks you want to use. The design I’m using has 20° tips which is better for tkp trucks like the ATS 12, where the popular trampa decks are 35° which is more suited to channel trucks. The la croix deck is 30° I think and that seems to work well with matrix 2 trucks that use elastomer shocks instead of springs.

My personal preference is for the low profile 20° tips tho, it just looks mean and sexy at the same time

![image|690x387](upload://vKIyAkMHfFI7ngHATB67OrJ6dxt.jpeg) 

Plus you can always wedge the tips after the fact to fit different style trucks

20 sounds like the perfect spot. I'll have to think about that!

Yea, let me pull up their information and I can get you in touch with the people that I bought mine from. You can request different sizes and different ply lay outs too. Shipping wasn't too bad either.

PM me so I don't forget!

@venom121212  I don't have faith in anything until there is a 'buy now' button when it comes to website business. Personally I'm more keen to get one from someone within the community, and I much prefer the Komodo spin on these anyway. 

I wish MBS was a bit more esk8 focused, but I understand they already have traditional MTB pretty seated. I got excited when I saw them pop into the forums but I'm not sure much came from it.

Honestly couldn't have stated that better myself. I love their designs but MBS is constantly out of stock and rarely a presence on this forum. See the future guys. I really like the komodo deck above at the 20° angle. Buuuut I really love @itsmedant too and want to support his project as well. Guess I'll just have to support both community innovators :man_shrugging:

I’d be interested in a Komodo mtb if the Dylan Warren II isn’t released by mid February, not going with a Trampa deck because they don’t have the hs11 anymore and refuses to sell a non holed holypro. I’d be interested now, but even though I did the focbox unity preorder. It looks like they grouped me into the 2nd batch, which seems to be around the time of the DWII release.
