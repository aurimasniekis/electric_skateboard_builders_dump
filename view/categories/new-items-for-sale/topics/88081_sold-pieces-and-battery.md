But what is it now? You can’t expect people to pay more for something just because you did. They will almost always buy the cheapest option, and considering the cheaper option is from a reliable source you will have to lower your price

That includes shipping, which you can't pass on - either way it's not 200 ;)

I'm in the market for these parts. Depending on where you're located depends on if I can collect them in person. Would like to test each battery before purchase. Make a more realistic price for it all though.

I'm coming to London at the weekend. Kind of upsetting you can't do collections though. Thanks anyway and good luck with the sale.

@Halbj613 if you can’t do collections, have you checked what postal service you can legally send these with ? Be a good idea to check
