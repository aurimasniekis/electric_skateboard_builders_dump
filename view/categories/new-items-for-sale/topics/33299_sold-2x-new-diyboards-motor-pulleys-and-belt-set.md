Hey guys,

I just ordered these parts but decided to go with larger belts for my build and I dont trust their return policy so passing the savings on to you.

Pulleys:
2 x 16t 12mm Motor pulleys $15 each or 25 for both shipped
4 x 280-5m-12mm belts $25 shipped 

Also have a Kegel pulley for sale here: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/evolve-kegel-15mm-33t-pulley-with-bearing-for-regular-trucks/33298
