Have a basically brand new Loaded Tesseract Deck that has been mounted. Just needed a deck to use to test a new battery and motor build out and didn‚Äôt have anything else readily available. Decided to use a different deck for my build.

$175
**** If purchased at full price I will include a *Psychotiller Enclosure for free that fits the deck perfectly ($70 value)

Located in Orange County, CA.

Will ship anywhere a buyer wants to pay for and make sure that it goes out in the mail the same/next day depending on the time of day.

Contact me here or email me directly at jansenfalvai@gmail.com

Word! I'm just in Anaheim Hills so lmk when you wanna swing by.

I would love to go on a little ride when you come by if you're down.... would be cool to see that 4WD build you put together. I live in some good hills that you could really test it on that I ride on daily right where my pad is.

LMK
