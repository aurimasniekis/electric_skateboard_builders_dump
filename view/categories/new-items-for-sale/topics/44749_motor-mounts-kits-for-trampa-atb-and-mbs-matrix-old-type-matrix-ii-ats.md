[My topic regarding the sale of motor mounts for mountainboards](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/motormounts-kits-for-trampa-e-mtb/15502) is over a year now and there is haos in it.
That's why I create a new topic

I offer motor mounts and belt transmissions for Trampa ATB and MBS Matrix (old type), Matrix II,  ATS 
Difference between motor mounts  for individual types of trucks consists in applying other clamping rings and other length of crossbars

Motor mounts for Trampa ATB

I designed the motor mounts a few months ago  for @Eboosted. Unfortunately he didn't manage to install it in the board before the fire  :frowning:

Looks nice.  

Does the street carver version work with the trucks in both positions - forwards for urban and backwards for street?  Also in each configuration can either spring position be used ie is there enough clearance?  Finally can you please provide shipping costs to Australia?  Thanks.

## \#27 Posted by: jga Posted at: 2018-03-19T09:43:31.887Z Reads: 476

```
The ATS is a skate truck that only need a 15 degrees riser if you use a straight board. The Matrix is for use with a MTB type that already has an angled tale and noze, as it requires to be mounted at 35deg.
In terms of performance you will find the same difference as in between a longboard and a MTB.
Springs trucks tends to be easier to turn and adjust.

Does the mount above fit on this old version of the matrix truck with the plastic top truck?

Hmm maybe someone on this site that has the same trucks and hubs @Rithblu @biggdaddyhawk have either of you got the same trucks/hubs combo and thus the measurement?

I can do motor mountings for your trucks, but you need to measure the cross-section of the hanger and the spacing of the spacings with the hubs

I don't know why they shouldn't fit to aluminium mounts from @Idea. I have V4.0 mounts and 44T Trampa pulleys for 125mm Gummies and 60T pulleys from @idea for 7" wheels. The difference in width is about 1mm so it's just about adding or removing 1mm washers from the axle when changing wheels.

Yeah thats the thing i would prefer not to add washers or things like that, a spacer is fine but if things are made to work together from the factory that would be ideal.

I had to put 3 shims under a pulley i bought once and it drove me nuts so i ended up replacing the things to the same brand so it all worked well together.

@[TwinStarShakti](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/u/TwinStarShakti)
I have two types of motor mounts for your trucks

v6.3 - But you do not need idlers, because you have a chain drive.
The price of version 6.3 without idlers is 140 Euro

![image|672x500](upload://kqdZMgdkTdPl2zQ03RNoEqhn7Ue.jpeg) 


v4.5 - The price of the v4.5 is 120 Euro

@huyndreds this is a mount system that would work possibly with the mbs board you mentioned in PM. as the trucks are almost the same i believe.

I have just read through this entire post thread, and am really impressed with your craftmanship. Bravo!

Looking into a
v4.5
With a double set of pulleys (15/60 (1/4) Gear Ratio) and 4 15mm belts if possible :slightly_smiling_face:
For a Trampa mounts and Superstar Hubs.

@taz
I will have to create a catalog of products

For the ATB Trampa I can offer many versions 
v4.5, v5.0, v6.1, v6.3, v6.4, v7.0. v7.1, 7.2, 7.3. 

I have described different versions in several topics
I wanted to limit the number of types but many people want older versions of motor mounts,  so I still do them on order

The basic question is what you build?
A board for city driving or for driving in difficult terrain?
The second question is, what are your hubs?

@CoolRextreme
v4.5 - 120 Euro
With a double set of pulleys (15/60 (1/4) Gear Ratio) and 4x 15mm belts - 116 Euro
The cost of shipping to the US is 35 Euro
Total: 271 Euro

It is not for me.
I am trying to drag a friend that has an Evolve into DIY and we are looking at a Holypro deck with Vertigo hangers with an underdeck enclosure so mostly for city driving with the random mild off road sessions.
Hubs will be Trampa Superstar or the new Megastar which have the same pattern.
If you could make a post or edit the first post in this topic showing all the various versions it would be really helpful.

Unfortunately, I can not edit the first post in this topic. The topic has been over a year and first post is blocked for editing

v7.0 is motor mounts without a crossbar 
v7.2 is motor mounts with a crossbar made of aluminum
v7.3 is motor mounts with an adjustable crossbar made of stainless steel

v7.0

v7.2 - 160 Euro
v7.3 - 150 Euro

The v7.x series it's designed for a 15/60 gear ratio
a double set of 15t + 60t pulleys + 15mm wide belts - 100 Euro

A larger 72t pulleys for hubs can be used but you have to remove the idlers

Prices of motor mounts without idlers
v7.0 - 100 Euro
v7.2 - 150 Euro
v7.3 - 140 Euro

a double set of 15t + 72t pulleys + 15mm wide belts - 100 Euro

Hi, you got the most awesome mounts I got to say, any thoughts on making covers for them too?

I've only used crossbar so I can't say for certain.

I will say this: 

I didn't loctite the mount bolts at first and after trying some jumps and heavy offroading, the mount was able to wiggle vertically a tiny bit but not at all sideways. The crossbars still kept the mounts flush the entire time! I can't physically make the belts slip off or the mount come off the trucks with crossbars on. I absolutely love the crossbars and the stability they give. It makes me smile every time I hear a rock or debris ping against them because it's one less thing that could have hit my motors.

I also made motor mounts for EVOLVE trucks
[/quote]

this is exactly what i need! I recently went down to a 12t motor gear and 200mm tires but the belts are slipping. so an idler pulley would be perfect

can i assume the idler fits with the AT wheel pulley? 

how much with postage to Australia?

oh and will my 5065's work or do i need to get 63mm motors?

@TinnieSinker

The current version is adapted for 63xx motors and 15/60 gear ratio, but I can design a version for 15/66 gear ratio and 5065 motors

The price for two motor plate with idlers is 100 Euro
Shipping to Australia - 28 Euro

I designed two versions for 5065 and 63xx motors

You also need pulleys and belts

Unfortunately, it does not anodise, it just polishes the surface

![image|666x500](upload://shTWRgYUcoP9huJBemBX7PAIqDR.jpeg) 

No, nobody has come up with such an idea yet.

Narrow trucks (mini spring is not the best choice for off-road riding)

minispring is trucks for city driving (Urban carver), and for city driving you don't need full motors protection, motor mounts in version 7.3 are the better choice for this truck
