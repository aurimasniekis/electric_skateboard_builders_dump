He's all about function over form so I think it's safe to say unless you are selling a MASSIVE battery with wheels attached, he's not interested.

Yes function over form in this case would be using it to prevent dust collection, verse letting it sit and look pretty for a buyer (dust wiping personnel)...

Please stop it with that bro attitude of yours

Please do not buy or sell this skateboard. We believe it has been stolen (however, not saying Will stole it). Police reports have been filed, so we would recommend not buying this.

I know right!?! Will bought it off the back of a truck?

Iâ€™m assuming someone stole it off a porch when delivered

Quick update- looks like it is probably stolen not sure yet, as long as there is a way to recoup what I paid Iâ€™m all good, Iâ€™m doing all I can and providing them with all the information they are asking for. I personally did not steal it I just bought it from someone who must have but had absolutely no idea

Keep us updated.
