This has been in the works for almost 2 years now and I'm excited to finally share the first pictures. The first couple of samples should be arriving within the next week. Once I can confirm everything fits (or find the only possible bug, which could be the truck plate fitting), I will be moving for the first bulk order, which should arrive no longer than 1 month from now. My manufacturer is fast and reliable on their time estimates.

This deck was created from the same ideas as the first deck I made my self.
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-rocket-4wd-hummies-hubs-4x-chaka-vesc-10s4p-lg-he2-li-ion-cnc-milled-veneer-pressed-deck/8123

I have tested this design myself and my first deck has lasted over a year and a half with very minor wear and tear, over 2000 miles later with hummie aluminum version, then hummie steel, then carvon v2, and now hummie v4's. The design is quite strong, but will confirm the wood they used is just as strong.

Decks are 100% Russian Maple, not cheap china maple. Why Russian Maple? Maple grown in colder temperatures grow slower, creating a denser and stronger wood. China Maple is grown in warmer temperatures, and thus, why it is often weaker than Russian or Canadian Maple.

This deck is 41 inches long by 10 inches wide. For the samples, the pockets were 22mm deep, 70mm wide, and 558mm long. For the preorders and first batch of boards, the pocket will be 22mm deep, 85mm wide and 650mm wide.

Fit up to a 10s5p or 12s4p 18650 or 21700 (specifically made for the new Samsung 30T cell) or 12s 8Ah zippys.

This deck is ready for 2wd or 4wd. The reverse recession is designed for use with Paris trucks (The same ones used for all hummie motors, including the new v4's). You can bottom mount other trucks (as I did with my carvon v2's in the past). Designed with hummies motors in mind, but can be used for any motor setup.

Theres 3 places to run wires between the 2 pockets. One on each end for the battery wires, and one in the middle for balance wires.

Price will be $180 USD + shipping, which is a great deal compared to chaka's hollow core decks at $500!
Includes: Deck, Lid, Screws, and Screwdriver.

Even a regular professional long board will run you $120 + $40 - $60 for an enclourse + $5 for a screw driver + $5 for hardware (so $170 - $190).

The board does look a bit thick, but it's still cleaner and thinner than a deck + bottom mounted enclosure. When seen in person, assembled, the board does not appear as thick as it does in photos (so I've been told by others on here).

Yes, there are a lot of screws. But once you assemble your deck correctly, you should not need to ever take the lid off again. A small battery powered screw driver can be purchased for around $10 USD also on amazon if you want to speed up the process. I like hand tightening them to prevent over tightening and possible damage to the lid.

Not 100% sure yet, will weight it when I get the 2 samples hopefully this week or early next week at the latest.

I can tell you from the deck I made before, it feels slightly heavier than a 11 layer longboard deck, but not by much. Most of the extra layers are hollowed out, so even though this is many more layers, it sdoesn't mean double the weight at all.
```

It does now! Naming it The Rocket Deck. The core is made of 18 hollow layers, a 3 layer base, and a 3 layer lid, for 24 sheets in total. Bear in mind, these are not the thicker sheets used in tradition longboards, but the 1/16 inch sheets. So it will be around 1.3 inches thick. A bit thick yes, but take away the need for the enclosure, and it's not really that thick. The end result comes out pretty clean compared to an enclosure.

There is a nice amount of concave to this deck. For one, you can see the drop down in the pictures quite clearly. It is a nice pocket. The deck slightly rises in the middle, which also helps to create that pocket. The whole board has a nice concave from side to side.

This is far from a flat deck. Your feet lock in way better than any other electric skateboard deck I've ever ridden.

Let's go through some info about hollow core decks:

Hollow core decks are comprised of really 3 parts:

- Hollow Layers
- Base Layers
- Latch or Lid Layers

The inside configuration can be one of two things:

- A box
- Channels

Most so far have taken the box approach. This can utilize space better, but requires a stronger lid and  stronger base to maintain its structural integrity. Often meaning carbon fiber. This means a board that doesn't flex the same way as a 100% natural maple deck.

The other option is the one chaka pioneered. The channel approach.

Comprised of multiple channels (chakas was 3, mine is 2), the electronics are split, allowing for a center beam that structually supports the board both in torsional flexing and most importantly, providing support for the center of the decks base layers and  lid layers. In this case, your feet are better guarded from your electronics and you have an overall stronger deck that won't fail.

Yes, the lid is 3/16th of an inch thick or 3 layers.

This deck may be thick, but most use a 9 layer ply board plus 22mm for an enclosure. In my case, I use 22mm for the inside and 6 layers of wood between the lid and base layers. Resulting in a thinner deck overall.

I defiantly plan on offering a battery build for the deck in the future. My goal is to slowly turn it into a complete 4wd board, possibly 2wd also.

My recommendation and my plan is to spot weld with 3d printed short circuit protector end caps. Then solder to tabs on the end between the 2 packs.

Before, I soldered my cells with 8wg into a 12s4p and it lasted over a year of almost daily abuse before I over discharged it like a dummy, lol.

Remember, these decks also fit a 12s3p of the 21700 Samsung 30T cell that should be realesed any day now. This means you can get 9.3 Ah at 50.4v with 120 amp continuous discharge! Thats a whopping 6000 Watts!

The aluminum lid is a cool idea. But like Carbon fiber, it messes with the flex of the deck by stiffing the deck. I might mess with one at some point, considering that's something I could cnc in house. Would thin the deck a tiny bit.

Not yet. These are photos of the samples I have yet to receive. But I've made 2 boards myself (both different shapes than this one) with the same design process, and in this case, the support beams are even bigger. They also did the edges better than I did in the past so you won't have any gap between the lid and the deck like my attempts did. Should be getting this next week it seems. Defiantly will be posting more pictures as I assemble one!

If you can send me one, I can custom cnc it out for the ronin truck. I had this design done because it's a stepping stone for me to completes. This is the deck I plan on using more or less.

The first production run will actually have a larger pocket also. I'm trying to push them to 650mm.

That would mean a 12s4p of 18650 + bms + 4x vescs would fit.

The bottoms of these bottoms are also basically blank canvases.

So for any artists who can to customize the graphics or their deck... Could make some wicked graphics!

You can't do this with a regular bottom mounted deck.

I will also offer custom graphics in the future.

I can do some minor mods to these decks to add more features. My goal was a standard enough starting point so things can be added.

I have some smart led bars I plan on adding to the front and backs as an upgrade option.

This is really just the beginning, a lot of options are possible. But I needed the foundation first.

For a no thrills board, the price is really good. With LEDs and other features, the price could jump quickly.

Working on finding a graphic artist to do some graphics for these samples also to show what can be done.

Depending on your battery packs assembly, you might be able to split the pack.

From the sounds of it, like chaka said, battery packs need to be supplied.

I'm working on a source for 30q cells to hold over till the 30T cells become ready.

I want this, thanks for making this available, but some questions first.

Is this pre-order pricing discounted? If so what do you anticipate the normal pricing to be? (btw awesome pricing)

Can this be customized to fit 12s4p? Do you think I can route it manually, and not compromise strength? I'm thinking 12s4p minimum with 30q to feed 4 motors.

The screw holes to hold the lid on, they're just wood, right? No metal inserts? So something like countersunk wood screws, maybe deck screws?

Can you put up 2 more photos? One profile shot with lid in place, and one of the bottom of the lid? The middle support beam is recessed -- I'm curious if there's material to fill the gap on the underside of the lid.

How tall is the cavity?

Where do the switch, charging port, etc., go?

EDIT below is almost completely wrong.
<s>And side note, I believe Russian maple is actually commonly known as Baltic Birch, which is rather well known for high quality plywood.</s>

[/quote]

Yes, I will be charging $200 when I have stock. But I will also be selling with batteries later. If you decide you want to upgrade to with batteries later before they are shipped, I would just charge the difference in price between the two options. I am expecting my price with battery to be between $580-$620 depending on the bms for a 12s4p. I would love to use a community built bms, like the DIEbms. Obviously, that would be more expensive.

[quote="deucesdown, post:30, topic:43832"]

[/quote]

I hope to be able to get this to a 12s4p for the production version. Theres still more room for larger pockets. So I'm hoping to increase the pockets to 650mm in length each, which could fit a 12s4p.

[quote="deucesdown, post:30, topic:43832"]
The screw holes to hold the lid on, they’re just wood, right? No metal inserts?
[/quote]

No, there is metal inserts inside. You screw the lid into metal not wood, so they do not wear out overtime. I have unscrewed the lid on my current boards hundreds of times of the years with no wear whatsoever.

[quote="deucesdown, post:30, topic:43832"]
Can you put up 2 more photos?
[/quote]

When I get the samples, I will gladly put up more pictures. They said they will ship no later than Monday so I should get them some time next week.

[quote="deucesdown, post:30, topic:43832"]
The middle support beam is recessed
[/quote]

It is not. Your getting confused the concave. That's how much concave this deck really has. The lid will rest on this middle beam, along with the outer beams. The lid is just simply 3 layers cut to the shape of the deck with holes for screws to go through.

[quote="deucesdown, post:30, topic:43832"]
How tall is the cavity?
[/quote]

Each pocket is 22mm deep. Right now, the samples pockets are 558mm long and 70mm wide each I might change this to 650mm for the production version to fit 12s4p batteries.

[quote="deucesdown, post:30, topic:43832"]
Where do the switch, charging port, etc., go?
[/quote]

This is something you can solve (or I can solve for you for a small fee). You can't make a product like this with a one size fits all solution. So in some ways, the board is like a blank canvas. With my current board, I drilled out holes on the side for a power switch and charging port. That was with a $20 black and decker drill and some cheap drill bits. Essentially, something most people in the diy world should be able to do.

[/quote]

Couldn't find anything about this on google. If you have any links, I'd love to read about it. My understanding from researching it is that it is not a plywood.

It's the cheapest wood material here. Low density and not very strong. Birch plywood is most common plywood in Poland (you know that country by the Baltic Sea). Plywood is a plywood that is sheets of veneer glued together and hot pressed. Majority of plywood is build from 1,5mm thick sheets and it's made from different kinds of wood. Your Russian Maple is very good material. The best wood is from Sweden and Finland.

The first deck I made was via a vacuum bag, 3 layers at a time.

I moved up and built a hydraulic press and mold for the next deck, which showed to me that there was a better way of making these decks, I made 1 good deck but never rode it.

Now, I have found a manufacturer that has experience making decks for electric skateboards. Funny enough, it just so happened to be the same manufacturer of hummies decks, lol.

I gave them all of the pictures of my work, look at board molds that they had, and gave them all of the detail of how I made my boards. I think they did the same thing I did for the last board, which is press 18 layers, cut them (they used a cnc mill, I just used a jig saw), and then repressed with the last 3 layers. I believe they press the lid separately, but placed them together for cnc milling to get perfect accuracy.

Right now I am waiting on the samples. I know this build process yields a strong deck (the biggest problem with hollow core decks is strength), and the beams are even larger than mine before. Everything else was cut to my specification. And since they are providing me with the screws also, they can confirm the lid indeed fits before shipping. They have already confirmed it fits the paris truck.

Should be getting the samples mid next week. Once I get them, I will post many more pictures. They didn't send me the best of pictures, which is the bottom of the board.

I have found in the 2 years on riding with this design that water does not seep in. I have ridden in mild down pours (been caught halfway, no rain when I start, and half way home, it starts to pour) and no water gets in. I put the buttons and ports on the side of the deck, and in the back left side, water from the wheels misses them there.

Now, I am not calling it water proof. If you submerge it, water will likely get it. But rain shouldn't be an issue at all (unless its a absolute downpour, in which case, what are you doing outside riding? haha).

You could put a rubber seal between the deck and lid if you really wanted. But I don't think you'll gain much benefit, if any at all.

lol, Everyone wants pictures! I know. The best I can do is point you to the link I provided in the first post of my first build with this style of deck, as I wait for the first 2 samples. It will be very much the same structure, just a slightly different board cutout and concave. I will post more pictures as soon as I can.

I haven't tested belt drives but I have a strong feeling with the right motor mounts, it will. There are about 16 layers down to the bottom from the recession. All be it, these layers are 1/16 of an inch thick. So it will be about 1 inch down. Regular longboards are about almost .75 inches thick. So if you have an extra .25 inches of clearance, it'll work.

Hey how about some pictures ? Just kidding:joy:.

Btw: since it may be news to some potential customer maybe offer or link to 3d implants, so they could finish out the lid with the concave of their dreams. just as a thought.

@evoheyax any way to make them top mount? In my view would be only two operations not done

And another thing, are you sure that 70 wide fit 2170 cells? you have to account to nickel thickness, balance wires, heatshrink, etc. at least 5mm more per side

Edit: Just a quick mock up I did, a few suggestions, indeed 70mm is to narrow, the VESC 6 won't fit as it is 70.5mm too tight for my taste, and also, if you increase the the lenght of the pocket bit it is possible to fit 10S5P. If you use the zigzag pattern i used its just 10mm more or 60mm more with a flat layout

Also, I realized a few days ago 70mm is too narrow. This is why the production version will be 650mm x 80mm.

The deck is simply too thick for top mounted. This is about as much as you can get away with already before you have issues with the truck making contact with the bottom of the board while turning.

Making it top mounted would mean the whole deck would be even lower to the ground and give less clearance for the truck. The reverse recession means the trucks are mount onto of the board, but they sit flush with the top of the board instead of sticking up like most drop through decks. Think of evolve CGT... Trucks are mounted like that.

You can also bottom mount trucks too...

No...The deck would have to be milled or you'd have to use a custom truck baseplate. The deck is over an inch thick. And i always thought top-mount is the deck mounting on top of the truck (higher ride height) and drop through is where the truck baseplate is oriented through the deck cutout (lower ride height)

Sorry, I guess I do. Who calls the bottom of their deck the top? Make zero sense. To me, mounting the trucks on the bottom (i.e the graphic side) of the deck is bottom mounted. Not talking to you per say, It;s just confusing to me.

But ok, lets call it top mounted. You can top mount any truck you like on this deck. You don't need to do anything special. Might be a little high off the ground, but I did it with 90mm carvon 2's before and it wasn't an issue.

Heres an example with the carvon v2's with 90mm ABECs with funbox trucks (so they don't fit the reverse recession without re cutting it, which I can do):

This is the first iteration of the deck I made btw, NOT the final deck that is being made now. But the concepts are all there. This one is way more professional looking though.

Something that should help to make it look thinner is make a really shallow chamfer on the bottom side, but maybe it is not noticeable

Do you have any picture with you (or anyone) on top of it?

The thickness is an issue thats hard to get rid of on these kinds of decks.

At the end of the day, you need 22mm to fit a 21700 cell. Then theres 3 layers for structure on both the top and bottom, for 6 layers total. Can't really get away with any thinner.

What can be done is tweaks to make the deck look thinner. Chaka painted the bottom black, and continued that paint up the side to cover the first 4 layers. This made the deck look a decent amount thinner, while not actually making it thinner.

What I could do is make a thinner version for 18650's only, which could shave a few layers off. But then, would'n't fit the  foxbox cause the focbox is 22mm thick...

In the end of the day, it's still thinner in the center of the deck than an enclosure mounted board. In that case, you need a 9 layer deck + 22mm for electronics. In this case, it's 22mm for electronics and 6 layers for the deck (3 for the bottom, 3 for the lid)

I'm not sure, but chakas is wider because he has 3 channels (al be it the middle one is only 50mm wide instead of 80mm).

I This is already extended as much as possible. One option might be to push the screws and metal screw inserts inward a little bit. As it is now, I ask about rounding the edges, but they said it would hit the screw inserts.

Theres defiantly 2 changes so far, which is pocket to 80mm wide instead of 70mm and 650mm long instead of 558mm. If I could push the screws inward so the edge can be rounded slightly, then chakas paint trick.

If you want to see the deck being ridden, this is my deck (not the production deck) with hummie v2 steel hubs. The new deck has even more concave. It's very stable though. Flexes when you hit something in the road to help absorb the shock, but not more than a regular skateboard deck under normal circumstances.

And a bottom mounted deck with a kydex box is sexy?

It has it's own style of beauty to it.

At the end of the day, you are at work downtown and you need to get home work from at the end of the day. You grab your board, put it in the street, now what matters, how it looks, or how it handles?

Are you even going to see how it looks while you ride it? Or are you going to be paying attention to how it is handling so you don't fall off at 30 mph.

When random people look at this, with hummies hubs, they think it's just a normal skateboard but thicker. They are amazed when I tell them it's packed full of electronics and fly away. Your not fooling anybody with your giant boxes on the bottom of your board though.

At the end of the day, it may not fit everyones taste, but no product ever does.

Do you want to fit a 12s2p instead so that it can have amazing curves? Or a thicker look that allows a 12s4p + 4x VESCs.

Do you want something where your feet lock in nicely? Or do you want something that is shitty to ride because theres not enough concave, but looks nice?

I wouldn't call this deck "sexy", but I wouldn't call the board ugly either. Like I said, it has it's own form of beauty. Maybe your change you mind with some graphics on the bottom, since we don't have any enclosures to block the graphics, like bottom mounted boards do...

Have you considered, say a 2mm PETG or thermoformed plastic lid?  It should further reduce thickness and cost.

1. Cut a sheet of PETG plastic to slightly wider than your lid dimensions. 
2. Insert dummy battery packs (to fill the voids in the two hollow channels) 
3. Insert rectangle of PETG plastic into the space for the lid.
4. Apply heatgun to plastic until it deforms slightly to the concave of deck
5. Let it cool.
6. Re drill holes in plastic lid.

Finished. :slight_smile:

But it would cost over $40 per lid in just material cost. Would shave 3mm off, but whats 3m when you have 38mm already...

It is "just a wire" but it has to be an exact length to match the frequency of the wave you are trying to pic up. 2.4ghz use an antenna around 31mm long. 

Then they can other features that help reject noise.

Definitely true! Not only are they strong, but they have a better feel when riding also. Carbon fiber feels too stiff, and rattles with vibration.

Its hard though to make a 100% Maple hollow core deck that also is super sleek and sexy looking. But some times, you have to ask whats most important to you. The coolest looking board or the most practical board for riding.

For me, I want a deck that adsorbs some shock when the rode isn't perfect or I hit a large bump. Even stiff wooden decks do this. Carbon fiber decks never absorb shocks, and instead, transfers the vibrations straight to your feet. This is why 100% Maple hollow core deck was important for me.

Yes, the ppm cable can be as long as you want, the length of a skateboard should be no issue. The antenna can be lengthened but its not as simple, if you buy the same kind of shielded wire, the shielded section can be any length, its just the active (un shielded part) at the end that needs to be an exact length.

If your reciever has that little plug for the antenna you can buy longer ones pre made.

And I'll see if the edges can be rounded but theres no promise there, since it's quite a bit of work. Before the end of the month, the order will be shipped!

Finally had a chnace to take some nice photos. Just some background on these photos:

- The lid in these pictures is not screwed down. So that's why theirs some misalignment/gap issues in some the pictures. Once screwed in place, it will have no gap or alignment issues.

- The final cutout of each pocket will be 85mm wide instead of 70mm wide here. It will also be longer.

- The first image is a comparison of thickness vs a quarter. About 5 layers thicker than a quarter with the lid, so you can properly visualize the thickness.

Now Enjoy!

Thank you for your input!

I've been in talks with them about getting the edge thinner looking.

Theres 2 problems: the pockets and the screw inserts. 

The curve can't start until after the pocket, since it needs 3 layers for strength as a base.

Also, curves can't be too deep near the screw inserts. To get rid of the gaps between the lid and board like I experience on my homemade deck, we moved the screw inserts near the edge of the deck to get a nice sealed edge. This makes it impossible to round though. If we move the inserts in towards the pockets, then it's harder to close the gap.

I will work on it to see what can be done :)

Sorry for the confusion. I have 2 decks right now. Both are samples with the 70x558 pocket.

The preorder is the first production run. These preorders will help me get to the bulk order size I need to do a production batch. And for the preorder, they will have  a 85x650 (not the 82x650 I was planning on) just to give a little extra space in case you need it.

All boards that will be shipped, preorder or after, will have the dual 85x650mm pockets :P

Shipping is real time quotes based on real time shipping costs. For most so far, it has not been that much.

In the past, I left a little gap between the bottom of the base plate and where the deck starts again. Still debating whether to do that or just leave it as it is now, which would require you to drill through the base plate.

why not bore the screws in slanted? It´s a bit more work of course, but that will allow you to take more material from the sides to give a slimmer deckshape.

The reason being they would need to use a 5 axis cnc machine instead of a 3 axis. That would balloon the costs for sure. The whole goal of this project was to create as affordable as possible of a board. This is by far the cheapest hollow core deck ever released to the public. The closet I've seen is over $350, almost double the price.

I have checked and even as the design is now, I can do a 10mm radius on the bottom. I will be modifying one of my samples to see how that affects the looks :)

I definitely want to thin it out...

Haven't tried pneuatics. From side to side, the wood is 4.5 inches wide. So as long as your trucks are 6 inches or wide, I could see it working. Again though, haven't tried it yet.

The decks are being negotiated still. They have been on a lot of holidays this month, so things went a bit slower than I thought. They should be in production any day now. Still trying to get them to round the bottom of the deck to give thinner side profile. I did it successfully to one of my samples and it does look nicer and thinner.

Yes, it will fit. In fact, a 10s5p + your bms + 2x focboxes will fit! Each pocket will be 650mm long by 85mm wide and 25mm deep.

So in the right pocket, you can fit up to 34 x 18650 cells.  Lets say you do 30 as it might be more like 20 or 21 if you use cell holders.

650/19 = 34 cells, or 650/20 = 32.5 cells, or even if the cells are 21mm with cell holders, 650/21 = 30.95 cells.

Now in left pocket, you have 650 - 85 - 85 (2x focbox) = 480mm left. The bms is 120mm, so 360mm left.

Now with that 360mm left, 360/19 = 18.95 cells, or 360/20 = 18 cells or 360/21 = 17.14 cells.

If you keep the cells smaller without those cell holders, you could easily fit 34 cells in the right pocket and 16 cells in the left, for a 10s5p, with 2x focboxes and that 80a bms you posted!

There is sooo much room in these boards... It's crazy but great for powerful, long range boards.

Just an update: I am still working on finishing this first prototype to show you what can be done with this deck. I was able to thin down the profile a bit to give a slightly thinner appearance. I personally like the rounding better, and am aiming for that instead. But either way, I'm trying to make that part thinner.

Should have more photos to post by the end of the week.

I was really hoping to have decks being made by now, but the biggest issue honestly right now is funds. I need at least 3 more to jump in to help fill in the missing funds. My money has been getting destroyed the last few months by hummies motors. And we're starting to assemble those now. I hope we are shipping those by the 18th of this month, assuming we get the wheels and cores right by then. Either way, I'll have a lot of time over spring break to help hummie assemble them all.

If we can get a few more pre-orders, we'll have them in about 2 weeks from the day I pay, assuming they don't have any hiccups with the flattening or curving of the bottom edge. I was amazed they got the pockets to specification as quickly as they did on the samples. So I have a lot of faith in them to get it right quickly. I really want to say no later than the end of March, but it really depends on funds at this point.

If anyone knows someone who might want it, please share and help make this happen!

One feature I plan on offering in the near future is integrated head and tail lights, with the possibility of turn signals if paired with the remote I'm working on: (FYI, I know it doesn't look perfect, but I haven't appiled a clear coat to the sanded sections yet, so I'll look a bit better afterwards)

Maybe it's the OCD in me, but why did you decide to route the phase wires to each axle through one side of the deck? This might be okay for the narrow vesc 4.xx form factor, but there might be placement issues if you had the version 6.

The non symmetrical placement of vescs would also necessitate two different size battery packs. Meaning it would be essential to have a custom sized packs for the deck.

I realise you have probably unwilling to make changes to your prototype, but would you perhaps consider putting two additional channels on the other side under the lid, in future iterations?

So bad news. They said there’s no way for them to bevel it, so we’re stuck with the deck as it is in that regards. The pocket size is increasing though to 650mm x 85mm x 25mm. I have modified a sample to make one pocket 75mm x 650mm and the other is about 650mm long and 80mm wise.

Fits a 12s4p 18650 pack plus space for a bms plus 4 vescs plus powerswitch, Bluetooth and receiver and ardiuno  for the lights :slight_smile:
Yes this board is meant to fit a lot!!

If I saved space better, I could fit a 12s5p + 4 vescs if I used my old Chaka quad vesc or a dual vesc/focbox

Yeah I saw that and this gave me an idea to approach this in similar matter :) I wrote somewhere here about Baltic Birch and I need to add something after more research. There are stronger plywood than this made from Birch but they are more dense and lot heavier. Birch plywood is the weakest but still strong enough for our use. Strength to weight ratio is optimal for our needs.

I'm estimating around $40 to Europe, but you can use in the cart calculator to figure out real time shipping costs.

I like to think of the decks as a blank canvas. You can route it out more, add ports and holes how you want, and most importantly, paint it if you want!

The order should be going through any day now! That means about 30 days from shipping right now.

The changes are:

- New pocket dimensions: 85mm x 25mm x 650mm instead of 70mm x 22mm x 556mm
- Truck recession has some more play to it so they will fit correctly (This needs to be tested)
- Wire routes from trucks to pockets will go to both pockets now.
- Optional: light sockets for an additional $30 (not including lights). Really easy to set up using an arduino nano, a simply buck converter, and some neopixel lights for about $20.

We were not able to thin it out like in the example. But if you want to give it a go, your welcome to try your self. It's physically possible, they are refusing to do it and I don't feel I can give the quality that is needed to do it my self.

Hello everyone. Thank you for those who have supported this project and placed faith in me to get fulfill this project.

Unfortunately, it hasn't been a good past couple of months for me financially, and I did not get very many pre orders which I was hoping to use to help fund this project. The remaining pre-orders have been refunded. You should have your money back by no later than this coming Friday (it's up to how quick the banks process the refund). I'm sorry that this got dragged out as long as it did and didn't result in anything. I thought I understood what a portion of the market wanted, but I guess theres a much bigger market still for bottom mounted decks, as hummie had no issue selling over 70 decks at this point and I failed to even pre-sell 5 (they are pressed in the same mold, cut to the same shape).

I may still pursue this project in the future, but I need to shift my focus away from eskate for a bit and focus on my career.

So just an update for everyone. I do have plans on bringing this deck back in the near future. Unfortunately, the manufacturer of the deck refuses to bevel the edges. But it is what it is. I still think this is a great deck and if one wants to bevel the edges like I did, they are free to. A good wood worker can do a much better job than I did before.

I can't promise any dates yet, but they will be in stock before I take any orders this time as to ensure nothing goes wrong.

Minus the light sockets.

The only other change is better screw inserts.

This batch will not have anything special in terms of cuts. But you can see what can be done if you put some more work into it.

Thank you everyone for staying with me here. It's been a long road, but I'm excited to announce that 20 decks are on there way right now. I will have decks in stock next week, ready to ship! Price will be $150 for deck and lid plus shipping.

Would it make sense to ship one to EU?

Maybe if it costs too much a small GB could happen?

I would really like to get a deck with an integrated enclosure :D

Dang, that looks pretty nice. What did you end up with for the internal dimensions? Might have to get one of these just to force myself to drive down to the city and pick it up in person. How many boards is too many boards? :thinking: cause I'm starting to lose count...:crazy_face:

You need Paris base plates inside, unless you mount bottom, in which case you can use any truck. This was originally designed to be paired with hummie hubs.

You also can mill out more if you wish to fit other base plates. This is very much a blank canvas. Shape it how you want, paint it how you want, frit or grip, whatever.

Is the deck still as thick as the original prototype?

Yes, again, this is a blank canvas. That is why the price is so low. When the deck is refined in the future, it will be around twice the price.

Great news!

Decks are in and they look great! Paris trucks fit inside the deck and bolt holes line up (this was an issue before), and now using much better screw inserts that shouldn't fail (as the old ones did), and everything fits nicely. Pockets are the correct 85mm x 650mm x 21-22mm deep per pocket. Great for a 12s4p with tons of space or even a 12s5p could in theory fit! Also will fit the 21700 cells (this was the intention for high amp draw cells, like the 30T)!

Will be announcing this as a forum only sale with 20 decks, first come, first serve. As stated before, the base will be $150 + shipping/packaging (i.e. Handling). This includes deck, lid, inserts and stainless steel screws (no rust baby)! The next step up is to includes lid pre gripped for +$10. I'm hoping to also offer the option of black gloss painted top of lid with red frit for +$50. Pictures will certainly be coming soon with the announcement.

There is some slight mis alignment of the lid and deck. You could certainly fix this with sand paper and an hour of time (the lid is a bit wider in some places). I'm not interested in messing with this at this time. Again, this is mostly a blank canvas to be worked with. The deck does come with a clear coat that is easy to sand off if needed. This mis alignment in the cut is hardly noticeable while standing with the deck on the ground and is actually perfect for most of the deck. Some corners may or may not have this imperfection.

The final product that I hope to finished with some time down the road will be a thinned out profile and more finishes and frits. This will retail for around $300 as there will be considerably more work involved. This is a steal of a deal that won't last long.

FYI - Some other truck baseplates will work drop through.  TB 218s will fit.
