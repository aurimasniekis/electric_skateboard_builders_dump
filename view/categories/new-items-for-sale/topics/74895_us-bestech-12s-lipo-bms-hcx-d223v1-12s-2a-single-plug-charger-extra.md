Ordered this, then thought it was faulty after wiring it up and it not charging.  Ordered a new one before thinking twice about it and the problem was a bad connection on my charging port. I am located in VA, so there will be additional cost of shipping charge depending on where it's going. 

https://buildkitboards.com/products/bestech-bms?variant=7201537785886 for the datasheet, make sure it's the 12S 50.4V LiPo document

The BMS has actually never been used for a whole charge or discharge cycle.  Rated at 80A Continuous Current, has the following dimensions: 120mm x 80mm x 25mm

It has two wires for the e-switch (loop key or push button), solder pads for  B- (main batt minus), C- (charger minus), and P- (discharge (riding) minus lead), and finally 12 balance wires for whatever 12S lipo configuration you use. The BMS is listed for $40 alone, or $55 if you get the charger mentioned below.

You also have the option of purchasing the corresponding 12s (2A) charger (collections/battery-chargers/products/12s-2a-battery-charger) for an extra $15 in combo with the  BMS, or $20 alone.

**In summary:**
12s LIPO BMS - $40 (alone)
12s LiPo charger $20 (alone)
Combo 12S LiPo BMS + Charger $55
Plug shipping (tbd)

I will also throw in the corresponding panel mount power connector you can plug the charger into for free.
