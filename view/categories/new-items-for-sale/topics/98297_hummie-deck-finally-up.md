Are you sure you got the prices right?

As I understand the 2nd item, the deck which says it comes with the enclosure costs the same as the enclosure only

The prices seem to good to include shipping, especially to europe
But for US it makes sense because they sold at 125$ shipped to US

Single stack. There's an option for the deck, and an option for the enclosure. The enclosure option is not deck + enclosure (to my understanding)
```

I don't get it. The deck was 125usd in the past. Now its cheaper?! @Hummie you said before its going to be around 350usd with the enclosure on kickstarter!?

And speaking of kickstarter... now its indiegogo?

And John Murphy = Humina Shadeeba = Hummie

I am confused :upside_down_face:

can you fit 10s5p with dual fk-boxes? or even 10s6p :D :D

And would Is it alright for EU peeps to buy?

And the biggest question is that 110usd for deck+ enclosure.

theres a screw up on it.   the deck is 110 and the mounted enclosure is 110 as well.   220 plus shipping for both  

I hope no one understood it otherwise.

Excellent.  Now, since I supported at the $110 level thinking it included the enclosure, how do I go about paying the additional $110 to get the enclosure as well?  If I submit a $110 donation can you update my perk to the board+enclosure?

@Hummie  I'll work mine out with you later on in the future. I paid for the deck and then paid for the enclosure. 
$35 shipping on the deck and then charged $30 again on shipping for the enclosure.
And I'll be picking it up locally.
Thanks for what you do.

Can any pro battery builders confirm that they can build a flexible single stack 12s4p battery with BMS that will fit Hummie's board and enclosure, along with a Unity controller?  All the pics I've seen are people's self-made packs.

 the  separate p group pcbs are nice and some people sell those already assembled.   I also have single pcbs with cells on that you can pick up locally in san Francisco but im not shipping them at this point
![image|666x500](upload://aCMirwFrAWuhfG1hdrJoJrentuh.jpeg) 

these flex.  or i could send you cells with the tabs on and you can solder those onto the board.

@Movation I'll get the shipping costs up Tonight to Australia and everywhere else been lagging. 

@StupidDumbFox aha I remember now!   The board and enclose is cheap since u wouldn't have to pay shipping, hum I'll see how to get that option up, I have one battery left with 30q that are used but still have tons of life on the two pcbs u can have for 180.

international shipping is up as well as local pick up @StupidDumbFox
