Hey Everyone,

TLDR; flexible AT canadian maple/CF board with CF enclosure for 72 single stacked 18650 cells. On sale. Now. 

My brother (@pat_arch) and I are launching the Lacroix Board Co. (www.lacroixboards.com) to fill a gap in the market ; high speed, long range, pneu-only, flexible non-mountain board.

We built a 10s4p (30Q) and a 12s4p (30Q) trampa urban carver last summer and got hooked. After 3000km of riding, there were some things we liked and some we didn't (none related to @Kaly 's parts though!). We liked the pneumatics (how they are forgiving at high speed, on uneven, cracked and pot-holed roads as well as versatile for gravel, grass and sand) and we also really appreciated the flex of the board - with the caveat that the trampa deck derives from land kite and mountain boards which need to absorb jumps (probably where the hard-to-get-used-to arch comes from). Anyways, e-boards are not meant to leave the ground so we found the deck to be somewhat misadapted. Plus it has no concave, and we've had various issues with trampa trucks and wheels etc etc etc. 

Long story short we decided last September to build a new e-board from the ground up using our experience in various board sports and the knowledge we had acquired in e-boards.

Having personally been riding snowboards, surfboards and kite-surfs for over 20 years, we also used that experience to build a board that would feel like the best deep powder run. Like surfing at Nazaré. Like kiting in 30 knot winds. We wanted to create a board that would feel so good you'd have goosebumps and nervous giggles while riding it. A board that is fast and that commands respect. And as long as you do, will provide endless daily shots of endorphined adrenaline (we just made that up but fairly sure it's a thing).

Here is our long list of engineering and design constraints;

* Build the GT3 RS of e-boards. High speed. Long range. No compromise.
* Flexible Canadian Maple deck.
* Flexible carbon fiber enclosure (non conductive).
* Must hold at least 60 single stacked 18650 cells.

We designed the deck and enclosure with a big wave surfboard and longboard engineer. The board and enclosure were conceived together. The flex, the look, the feel, all were engineered and designed by considering both board and enclosure, as one.

Fast forward a couple months and we're thrilled to present you the Lacroix DSS60. The Dynamics and Speed Study (we sell it with 60 cells) is unique. The decks are handmade, one at the time. The carbon fiber enclosures are crafted in a motorsports atelier.

The board feels amazing. It rides like nothing else.

So why we here? This site is full of selfless people always willing to help and relentless about filtering the BS (which makes its content so valuable). As a way of thanking you for the knowledge, crazy experiments and general badassery, my brother and I want to offer you the possibility of purchasing our deck and enclosure at a low price to build it up the way you want and give us your feedback. All boards will be identified as "prototipo" as seen in the pics.

This is a one time offer for the members on this site only. This is our very small way of giving back to the community - we know the "prototipo" will make you smile. A lot.

**PRICE**; 

USD$375 + shipping. Payment must be made through the website (https://www.lacroixboards.com/product-page/board-carbon-fiber-enclosure-prototipo). 

EDIT; we had a coupon code at first but we had some feedback the coupon code was not working in some countries. So we now provide the discount directly on the website, no coupon code needed. 

**INCLUDED**;

* Hand made flexible board, crafted from a proprietary combination of Canadian maple wood, thin layers of fibers, topped with a beautiful carbon fiber layer to insure maximum flexibility and durability.  
* Pre-installed German-made inserts and closed-cell recessed foam strip for water resistance.
* Carbon fiber and fiberglass enclosure with pre-drilled holes.
* Stainless steel screws, countersunk aluminum washers and nylon washers.
* EDIT; Clear grip tape 

**EXCLUDED**;

* Hole(s) in the enclosure for the motor wires. You can place those wherever you feel like. If this feels too much for you... We have no clue how you got to reading this far on a DIY forum ;)

**DIMENSIONS & WEIGHT**

Deck;
* Deck length (with tabs): 34.5in / 876mm
* Deck length (without tabs): 27in / 686mm
* Deck width: 10.75in / 273mm
* EDIT ; Tabs angle ; 30 degrees
* EDIT; Deck weight ; 4.4 lbs including seal, inserts and screws (w/o griptape).

Enclosure specs:
* Cell compartments: 3in x 9.25in / 76mm x 235mm EDIT; when building your batterypack, you should keep your overall thickness below 25mm.
* VESC compartment (this is where 12 extra cells fit if you get creative) 5.25in x 9.25 / 133mmx235mm, minus the rounded corners
* EDIT; enclosure weight ; 1.1 lbs.

EDIT; **total weight** (deck + enclosure + hardware w/o griptape) ; 5.5 lbs

**FITS**;

* 60 cells (18650) comfortably (tested and running)
* 72 cells (18650) snug (only fit tested)
* 50 cells (21700) comfortably (only fit tested)
* 60 cells (21700) snug (only fit tested)
* MBS and Trampa trucks - 11 inch to 15.5 inch have been tested with no wheel-bite or heel-bite. If using 11 inch trucks, 7 inch tires are recommended. 8 inch tires might rub depending on tire model). The board is pre-drilled for MBS trucks. If you use Trampa trucks, you’ll need to drill holes for the damper screw (the ones that compress the springs and dampas). 

**EST. SHIP DATE**; mid to end of may 2018, just in time for the summer!

TIMELINE; the discount price will be valid only until the end of the month of March, **i.e. it will expire on March 31st 2018 at 23h59pm**. After that date, decks and enclosures will be available at the regular price of USD$699 + shipping.

Finally, after doing some research on the perfect backpack to transport our boards, we partnered with Osprey - an amazing company that only does one thing, backpacks. If you are looking for a small (22 litres) backpack that can easily and comfortably carry a 20lbs+ board, check it out here; https://www.lacroixboards.com/product-page/osprey-x-lacroix-22l-board-backpack. It has pockets on the waist belt for the remote, an integrated helmet net, a soft pouch for your sunglasses. It fits a laptop and it carries an e-board like it ain't no thang. Oh, and it also doubles as a backcountry ski and snowboard bag. 2 for 1 baby. The backpacks are available now (in blue) and ship right away. They come branded with the LaCroix logo, as seen in the pics. 

The shipping quote you get from the website is an estimate - although we hope not to, we might need to revert back with the actual shipping price and ask you to cover the difference if the actual shipping is higher. Inversely, if it’s lower, we’ll refund the difference.

PS; the motormounts on the DSS60 are the work of art of @Yann with the X-Design inspired by @Riako. Merci encore Yann, superbe travail!

PPS; special craft-beer-filled thanks to @JohnnyMeduse and @Blasto for teaching us a million things and helping us on this amazing journey. You guys rock. Hard.

PPPS; we are looking for an app maker for our board. If you're interested, DM dawg.

PPPPS (this is getting out of hand); the price of 7 inch and 8 inch pneumatics is insane for some reason (350%+ markups). So we decided to do something about it. We currently are selling some 7 inch tires (incl. tubes) at reasonable prices (USD$35 for 4 tires and tubes + shipping) so people can ride freely and treat them for what they are, ie consumables. 

PPPPPS (fuck it, we're both here aren't we!); sorry if much of this info seems to be repeated on the website. We actually drafted this post first and then pick and choosed a bunch of stuff from here for the website - which we launched yesterday.

Cheers, 

Alex & Pat

Wow, this thing looks amazing :slight_smile:
Nice work :)

I just had a look on your webpage, I'm missing some small but urgent info:

- some technical info about the deck, weight, degree of the truck holder ....

Don't want to start an argument, I just know that all DIY-ers want to know what they are beginning with. I'm really thinking on your board as an option, cause I'm just building a board with 60 (sony VTC6) cells, the DieBieMS, 2 big 6374 motors ...

I'm really thinking on redesigning everything around this deck :)

Thanks for the feedback. For the lights, we'd like a simple, clean kit that connects to the vesc so the rear light responds to braking. We're looking at some options, have not nailed the perfect one yet.

Hey Steve, 

good question, I've edited the post to add this. 

Deck weight ; 4.4lbs including seal, inserts and screws (w/o griptape).
Enclosure weight ; 1.1 lbs.

Total; 5.5lbs.

@Arch

It's a really beautiful deck. I've wanted to build an AT for a while but.. cannot stand trampa decks due to lack of concave, and the flex patterns are made for jumping so they're extra stiff.

Couple ??'s
- Board comes gripless? 
- noticed you stated you had issues with trampa trucks, if so what trucks are you utilizing in your completes?
- will there eventually be an option like the deck only option for $600~ but with trucks added to the package?(obviously at a higher price point)

Thanks!
```

@Deckoz 

Thx man.

Geez, you'd think after a post that long we'd have covered all the angles... lol. Good point, I've added this to the post - the board comes with a clear grip tape.

We are using MBS Matrix2 on our complete builds.

As for future option packages, it's not in the plans right now but if there's enough demand for it, who knows ;)

looks great, I like the smooth concave of the board! did you make the cf enclosure yourself or some professional factory production? I made an enclosure like that based on a trampa last year and with conventional layup it was really hard to get such sharp features - would be very interested in how you do that, cause Im working on a 12S7P cruiser with a segmented enclosure myself right now (not for sale, just for me)!

I may be wrong...but it looks like they are using pre-preg carbon... Which is alot easier to layup..

Thanks man!

Our enclosures are made in a motorsports atelier that makes race cars. We managed to get them excited about our project and agreed to work with us. As @Deckoz mentionned, we indeed use prepreg twill carbon fiber and and obtain the smooth finish with a combination of vacuum bagging and autoclaving techniques.

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/blitzu-for-trampa-stl-file-request/28245/37

There are many here who would only use Trampa trucks and so it's not an edge case at all, mbs trucks are probably a minority

As I've been very turned of by Trampa and their business practices/customer service lately, I'd rather not depend on Trampa for anything, making this a much more attractive choice. Obviously also these guys know their equipment, or so I'm guessing, and chose the best set up

 I'm talking about truck choice @mmaner they are far closer than to me than mbs who do have European distribution admittedly, where are you getting the idea that mbs are stronger? Not sure that's on the money mbs use a plastic baseplate iirc

The MBS trucks use a plastic baseplate, but the hangers them selves are far stronger.  MBS trucks have been around for years with far less failures and design flaws (vibration cracks, etc). 

Every trampa I've ever ridden (admittedly not many) the hangers flex, one of the things that turns me off of them. 

I'm all for innovation, hell I wouldn't be building esk8s if I wasn't, but sometimes the available solution is the best solution until new technology displaces the old solution. There's no new tech in mountainboard trucks.

GB = group buy. a level 3 member of the site can take reservation $$ off other users here and use that to negotiate a discounted price off a vendor and avail in some cases of better shipping costs since 1 big box followed by smaller deliveries in the same continent.

In this case however the price is already discounted as far as you'll go so unless there's a clear advantage on the ship then it's just extra work really.

But if you're looking for a EU distributer I could be interested, I'm looking forward to getting one later this month, my wallet needs to breath atm

It can happen to any truck really given the right set of circumstances

If plastic is so durable wonder why MBS decided not to use it in premium product, maybe it's because you can't injection mold a real quality part

Mike I know we're like buddies but if you're going to make me swallow that this base model

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to sell you anything...I am simply relating my experiences.  I know 2 people that have had Trampa solid axle trucks crack, and 1 person that had the hollow core straight up broke.  I've, personally, never known anyone who broke MBS Matrix II's.  Worn out yes.  Scratched to hell, yes.  Broke, no.

well there are both up and downsides of both brands.
Here are some broken MBS things:

I can't get over a structural component like that being made out of plastic, it's true unless you want to make something for really cheap and load up on the price. Not sure what plastic but let's just say nylon, let's have a look at some figures
https://www.makeitfrom.com/compare/6061-O-Aluminum/Polyamide-PA-Nylon-6-10-610

In essence there will be a whole lot of force being applied from the hanger->kingpin->small circular plastic ring on each side of the baseplate, I drew the springs in that MBS were too cheap to put in, sorry I mean that their PU dampers are so much more superior to anyone elses's that they don't need springs
![image|640x400](upload://hDdTXhxrKlLUPy6MMz9NfteyS2d.jpg)

The MBS baseplate is much better at being elongated before breaking, that about it really the aluminium which incidentally is forged increasing strength over cast

Anyway enough with the bashing, MBS has it's place for quasi-rough or street riding, certainly they are lighter given plastic, no springs & maybe a bit cheaper (if you live in the USA).

I have TWO farking iphones, a 5 and a 6, the 5 was a present the 6 is for work, not really bothered I was thinking a nice android when it comes time but they both do their job well and it's important to be able to trouser the phone unlike the behemoths that came out in the last few years.

I love you man, chill

@trampa thanks, do you have the tracking number?

Ps. One last fanboy comment, the whisper on the hanger crack, pictured here
![image|666x500](upload://hIIBoyJSnYUeKD5nmFi0KaZ00qP.jpg)

was determined to be contributed heavily by the use of solid MBS wheels, in saying that I'd say the solid Infinity would not have gone that way if using a solid wheel was important with offroad hangers, god know why you'd want to.

It's possible to break pretty much anything if you try hard enough

@TarzanHBK awwww, it laid an egg

Guys, while we certainly appreciate the passion, we do not intend on entertaining a Trampa vs MBS war here.

Pat and I tested both setups thoroughly (MBS and Trampa) for what we want our board to be, a high speed, long range, pneu-only, flexible non-mountain board.

We’ve found the MBS Matrix2 trucks to be overall much better for our needs, ie lighter, very
maneuverable at low speeds (no more picking up the board to point it in a different direction because the turning radius is much better) and no speed wobble at high speeds (without changing any setup). As briefly discussed, I broke a baseplate on my Vertigo truck and Pat bent a hanger on his. Can that happen on MBS? If the MBS had a hairline crack like my Trampa did, then yes, most probably. Nothing is indestructible. 

This said, in this Trampa vs MBS argument, the crux of the matter generally doesn't revolve around the aluminum portions of the trucks. Nor the fact that the Matrix2 completely deleted the spring (which imo is the real revolution behind this truck). The argument revolves around the composite baseplate of the Matrix2. 

Selling boards that are fast, we have a responsability towards our clients to provide a safe product (At the moment, Trampa doesn't sell boards that include battery-packs. There is a reason for that. The liability risks are real. For any manufacturer). And we take that very seriously. So here's the fact around this liability (which has many facets); we have not been been shown any actionable data demonstrating that the composite top plate of the Matrix2 is weaker than an aluminum plate. No evidence that would show a pattern of weakness enabling us to conclude that the documented cases of breakage are anything else than outliers. To conclude it's generally _weaker_ (and hence potentially dangerous), there would need to be patterns of behavior under similar conditions. We have been shown none. 

So from this situation, we conluded that, at worst, both Trampa and MBS are equal. This said, the ride feel and flexibility, the weight savings - namely by the fact they deleted 2 springs on the Matrix2 - , coupled with the great customer service we had from the guys at MBS made us lean in that direction. 

Again, we're not here to preach or bash anyone, I'm just sharing my personal experience. You may have had a different experience with the company and the products than we have had. 

I will conclude with this; if you've never actually tried a Matrix2 truck and have the opportunity to try one (on a friend's board etc), you should. It feels very different than a spring and egg truck. And after that, _if you still prefer the spring and egg Trampa_, that's more than ok. Not everybody likes Porsches.

As Pat said, we will more than happily accommodate you guys by drilling the right
holes for the build you want - Trampa trucks included. Because at the end of the day, we all just want the same thing. To go out and shred. 

Now if some moderator would be so kind as to flip all this side discussion to another thread, that would be much appreciated.

Cheers, 
A

Thanks @banjaxxed! Clearly had my acronyms crossed. In terms of group buys, as was said, the only place where you would be saving is potentially on shipping. Although keep in mind we only charge _actual_ shipping price (you're refunded if our estimate was too high and you pay a bit more if it was too low). So if we ship one big box of products to ireland, then you have a second shipping price to get the products to your door. I might be wrong, but I don't think the hassle would be worth it. You'd _maybe_ be saving a couple of bucks and that remains to be seen. To me, GB are more pertinent when you can get a discount on the product by buying bullk. Here, we are already offering you the steepest discount we can. We basically consider you guys as a huge group buy, with the caveat that we go through the trouble of shipping to all of you individually, not a single address.

I expect mutiples can stack nicely given the design, maybe have a check on that i.e. does an enclosure with a layer of bubble wrap site into another enclosure? and do two decks sit on top of each other like conference chairs?

We can surely pack them efficiently, although 2 enclosures would not stack perfectly into each other. It might be more efficient and safer to ship 2 fully assembled decks and enclosures side by side though. To be determined... Or 2 decks stacked and enclosures separate. We'll figure something out! ;)

Can you guys predrill for bindings? Also, why is the battery enclosure thicker at the center? Is this just for aesthetics? 

I know its design is not intended for ramps and so forth, but I'd still like to be able to jump on and off of curbs when applicable.

The board has a front/back arch and a heel/toe concave which is more pronounced in the middle.

So in order to have the same workable space for the batteries in the middle of the deck, the enclosure appears to be thicker when looking at it from the side but it does in fact have the same 25mm clearance in the middle.

also, note the board wasn't designed for jumping. The flex was engineered for carving, not for absorbing jumps (although going on and off curbs is certainly not a problem, besides maybe scratching the motormount). Also, I'd recommend trying the board before installing bindings. It's much wider than conventional boards and if you use the Matrix2, you'll find your lean angle will surprise you. Anyhow, maybe you'll prefer bindings, I'm just saying you should try the board without for at least a couple of days before making the call.

A

There's not much room for error! If you want, you can PM me your design and I'll do my best to confirm fitment. Depending on your design... The compartments have rounded corners that might interfere if you rely on only 1mm for clearance, up to you!

Alright, I have a dumb question for ya.  I think it would be cool to have this deck combined with some 6 shooters and Surf rodz RKP (with 200mm hangers and 90 mm axels to accomodate @psychotillers mounts).  

You see, I have these adjustable base plate trucks and I think they will accomodate the wedge...
![20180316_153144|281x500](upload://pNgAVZKeh1fRmxJiZX1QHDY8kvC.jpg)

It could probably work. The board was designed for at least 7 inch tires (or the enclosure will rub the ground when you carve) so perhaps you'd also need some riser. Not sure what @psychotiller 's part is so maybe it would cover that aspect. 

That would be a sick ride though

Regardless I will be get at least one for a build.  I have some rims that would look great on that board. Excellent work guys.

Unfortunately we don't have any pictures, in all honestly, this deck/enclosure setup was designed with pneumatics in mind. As @philvanzu mentioned, you would most likely need risers to avoid the enclosure biting the ground on sharp corners or big bumps.

Just to add to this and to give you guys a very rough idea, when putting my whole 185lbs body on my heel or my toes (to flex the Matrix II Pro truck on 7 inch tires) to simulate a deep carve, I have approx 1 or 1.5inch of space between the enclosure and the ground. So any smaller wheel will impact that space. This is on a very loose truck setting, so it's worst case scenario.

This looks awesome... Just one quick question before I pull the trigger...

I am confused about the wheel size limit. I assume I can use my MBS Matrix II trucks with 8" wheels? Cos you are selling 7" tires, not 8.

Sorry I wasn't clear. The wheel size limit is downwards not upwards. Under 7 inches might work (6 inches might, 5 inches you'd really be pushing it and under that I'd forget about it), but 7 and 8 inches work assuredly as we have tested those.

1 inch riser you would have the same clearance to the deck roughly as a 7 inch wheel...

Indeed, without a riser 5inch wheels probably will be too small and the enclosure will rub the ground in deep carves. A small riser should do the trick. Unikboards made some maybe they would work? Not sure about the angle in the riser, but maybe it would. http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/unikboards-group-buy-trampa-or-mbs-motor-mounts-angled-risers/19842

They are 35deg afaik, there are 3d printed ones on thingiverse which could be changed to 30deg. They would give the clearance you need, if not a riser as well, looking forward to seeing what peops do with this

Ahhhhhhhh, didn't know that detail. So the unikboards riser might be misadapted, I'm not sure. Anyhow, the point is a small riser would be needed for 5inch tires and possibly for 6 inch tires as well depending on how aggressively you flex the board when carving and what type of terrain you ride (on a bumpy surface we would recommend a slightly higher ride height - the enclosure on 5 inch and 6 inch tires might rub the ground during a deep carve over some bump in the asphalt).

I don't think it would be hard to machine, just a lot of aluminum would go to waste as it would need a square block to machine it from.. Plus I think it's not needed that much thickness as it would be aluminum and etc.

Maybe there is already similar form U form profile it would save a lot of work.

Haha! We are advertising only the Deck + CF enclosure on here but if you are asking about our full board, we will be using custom mounts, and custom pullleys. It will ship with 16T and 20T motor pulleys paired with a 62T wheel pulley. Our mounts were designed to accomodate both setups, the rider can choose what he prefers.

Extended torqueboards with mini drives. Thanks for the share, I know that @okp makes risers still(?) 30 degrees vs 35 typical trampa tips, I guess Ivwould end up at 45degs with those using fifty baseplates which I intend using - stock caliber ones and washers. Riptide bushings and pivot cups

Could be a flier

Found them? unfortunately sold out
https://www.valkyrietruckco.com/store/p1/Hildr_Adjustable_Base.html

I think I'll just have to use wedges for the meantime. Ok so I'm doing the math here :crazy_face: 
LaCroix deck: 30deg tips 
Hildr baseplate:  'can be set to any angle between 50-35', then...it stands to reason that even with...errmm

So help me out here, adjusting this baseplate to minimum i.e. 35deg would still leave the hanger angle at an unhealthy 65deg.

So 15deg min of wedged riser in front and maybes 20deg in rear?

I'm really wondering if non MTB trucks are going to work, anyone have experience in that dept? @Alphamail  @Deckoz @mmaner @MoeStooge  @bueller?

I'll look at those as precision might be desirable, maybe they could be reprofiled

Thanks dude. Even if I correct the angle, then the deck height will still be an issue, meaning angled risers may be a more rudimentary method, but also more effective and certainly cheaper, stress-free option

Bumpity bump bump. I know very little time has actually passed, but since we are past the sweet ass preorder phase (thanks for the deal, by the way). Are we still on track for these bad boys by mid/late april? Or will this be like everything else in this game and I should actually be planning for a winter build? 

No knock on you guys OF COURSE, just working on multiple builds, and planning can be a bitch when trying to spend $$$ strategically so your wife doesn't LITERALLY castrate you.


TBH, I like my balls, and I like using them even more, and I really like my wife. 

Any updates during your guys' process would be more than awesome.  I have lucid dreams about this deck, and I am sure I am not the only one!!

HAHA! Well for starters the post did say the shipping date was mid to late May, not April ;-) and as of today, we are quite on par with our estimation. We'll provide some progress and action shots as soon as the sun comes out but it's still cold as balls here in Montreal! We'll keep you updated and can't wait for you guys to have the boards in your hands - keep lucid dreaming, ship date is close!

You guys really threw a monkey wrench at my plans for the Trampa street carver I bought from @barajabali,  The killer feature was the width of the board, I have huge feet and the trampa deck is so narrow. In addition to that my resolve not to get a dual EscApe just melted away at the approach of the preorder end date. I am being taken over by the compulsory buyer's syndrome... damn.

We are 100% laser focused on fulfilling the orders at the moment. As you can imagine, there are a lot of moving parts to this but we are on track to deliver as planned and advertised. When the first units ship out, you guys will be the first to know. As you can see, we're not focusing any energy right now on updating or promoting anything through social media, but rather we put all our energy into fulfilling our orders. Our priority is to put our boards in your hands asap - it's all that matters for now.

Surfrodz RKP
[/quote]


This is just my humble two cents, take it, roll it and do what you seem fit with my opinion, but seriously the "stock" setup is so awesome! My two cents might not be worth its full weight because it is my first esk8 BUT I can tell you this much - I've been pushing an analog Loaded Dervish on Paris trucks, Kegels and ceramic bearings with cones for bushings both top and bottom with almost no pressure on them for a few years now. If there's one thing I was afraid to miss from that setup it was its carving ability. And boy does the LaCroix carve! I wouldn't change a thing, I'm leaning on it in corners like in a Michael Jackson videoclip and at the same time it is soooo stable - 35-38 km/h doesn't give you the spooks because of how wide this thing is. 

As for the wheels, yes @psychotiller has some epic epic wheels and I myself reached out to @Arch and @pat_arch right after I ordered it to ask if I could get the aluminium MBS wheels instead. I'm very happy I didn't. The board looks even better in person, and the whole purist stealth look fits it beautifully. It's bold, it's powerful but it doesn't scream that when you look at it. It sits there elegantly until you press the throttle and then it becomes the beast they say. 

Again, please forgive my excitement and like I said I can only speak about this board compared to the Trampa they lent me for a week before and for my Dervish. I haven't tried any other trucks than the ones on the DSS60 / Trampa / Paris, maybe Surfrodz are as nice, but as it is now, the stock setup feels anything but generic, I don't see how anybody who tries it out could not fall in love with it.

Cheers everyone!

Small note, keep in mind that lots of these folks only purchased the deck+enclosure and therefore have to build their own setup, which explains some of the comments you read here! :slight_smile:

wheels, I dunno, but I really like the ones from @Kug3lis:


https://shop.3dservisas.eu/collections/wheel-hubs
The Surf rodz trucks already have a home on another deck (Red Ember Bludgeon). 


 I just want to at least mount it up with the RKPs and check it out. You know, for science.  What if it is fucking amazing, and I had all the components, but never tried. 

That would be fucking tragic.

Guys, to save you some time and order this in advance. Making holes in carbon fiber is much easier with a step drill. For the power button for example, if you need to make a 16mm hole, you'll have a hard time doing it with a 16mm bit. Better to use something like this. 

https://www.amazon.ca/Bestgle-Speed-Steel-Titanium-Quick-change/dp/B06XNMGV9R/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1526488823&sr=8-4&keywords=step+drill

Once your holes are done, make sure you blow out all the CF dust as it's conductive and might short something in the electronics.

Also, once the hole is made, you'll have carbon splints around the holes. Simply take a small file and file the inside and outside of the hole gently. All the splinters will come off. 

Cheers, 
A

Fancy tape removal instructions:

1. Throw the boxcutter asides,you don't need it
2. Hold box over steaming kettle until arms start to fall off or tape does
3. Peel loosely adhered tape off box slowly
4. Place in frame of your choice

I've been blessed to have owned a few Porsches, most lately the (only) Fabspeed 911 Carrera 4 Black Edition Cabriolet in the world (aka, Darth Vader's Bathtub, 2016-2017).  

I only share this to qualify my first reaction after seeing the LaCroix deck: feels like a Porsche (and miles ahead of any commercial longboard deck).  

In fact, the LaCroix Prototipo feels more in-line with the world's best snowboards than any longboard.  Their thoughtful design choices reflect a clear domain expertise in competitive boardsport; this board feels familiar, but new.  The quality and finish feels premium.  Maybe if Loaded Longboards were Mercedes Benz, LaCroix would be AMG.

Finish is exceptional in every way, and I daresay, even @Ovi's mighty pics above don't do the edges full justice (Ovi's right on the money about the attention to detail, too).  You immediately sense the purpose in design is pneumatic RWD for street and here's the bottom line: just holding it you know, it will deliver.  

Hard to believe this is a version 'Un'. :slight_smile: 

@pat_arch , @Arch : I'm sending this LaCroix Prototipo deck and enclosure back to you next week... so I can claim a spot on your build list for the full LaCroix complete, please.  Nice job guys. -karl

I like the board but I have 2 questions about the complete board

Question 1 it says it uses 60 cells but doesn't say in what configuration is it a 12s5p or a 10s6p?

Question 2 it shows 3 deck options the stiffest being the 200+ option, what about heavier people in the 250-300lb area would the board handle a heavy rider like that or is that too much.

Looking again at the LaCroix, I would actually just go and purchase the complete board, and I should have done this, rather than trying to build my own. Hindsight - such a wonderful thing.....

Guys just go for the complete, it’s still on special and it’s the dreaaaaammmm! Almost two weeks (and around 140km ) riding it and mannnn it just glides like a little cloud, I can’t get enough of it and when you push that throttle it raises the little hairs on your back, it becomes thunderstruck! 

I imagine even if you want to customize it, it’s easier to get the complete with the battery and all and just change the wheels/trucks as you wish although once you try it you won’t want to change a thing ! 

Everybody that tried my board loved it. One of the guys in Montreal tried it and the same day he sold his carbon GTX. I know the GTX is nothing compared to some diy boards here on the forum but again, the DSS60 is a cloud. 

I just today reached 47.1km/h on it and you really have to look at the phone to realize that you are going THAT fast. You definitely feel the kick if you hammer the throttle but in my case I had a very wide street with no cars, freshly paved, so I just slowly built up to it, the board is so stable I had no idea I was going so fast, my top speed usually hovers around 40km/h at most. The only giveaway and the reason I let go of the throttle after that was because the tires start wobbling a little at that speed (still no wobbling form the trucks!) Maybe some balancing beads would help. 

I love the idea of DIY, I don’t own many objects which are not crafted or heavily customized by me but I have great trouble seeing what more you would want to pull out of the board. I mean it’s just a matter of time before I lay down some custom artwork on it and design my own lights, but after two weeks on the MBS Matrix II pros I wouldn’t go back to anything else and I feel bad for everybody running Trampa trucks. The battery is solid, focboxes run smooth. I’ve grown fond of the wheel design and I definitely wouldn’t want to run anything heavier, especially spinning weight. I had to change a belt due to the pitiful roads we have over here in spring, I had some rocks that got stuck in it and pierced it. It took me a while to notice it as it didn’t rip compeltely. I have to say it’s awesome the pulleys are all metal, other than the paint getting scraped off it, the teeth look intact. And it came with two spare belts, so that was an easy fix. 

Bottom line, if you’re not riding a DSS60 this summer, you are missing out. I have to admit it cost wayyyyy more than I was planning to spend. But I can confidently say it’s an expensive therapy that pays off in a big way, I think you would be missing out more on the experience of riding this than on two months worth of rent money. It’s not even about the sheer power most people are looking for in a board, it’s everything about it. I haven’t drove a Porsche myself to compare it to it, but I can tell you it gives me the same dumb smile as driving a WRX through Vermont’s winding forest roads. You are just glued to the road and you want to push it left and right, you don’t even care how fast you’re going, you’re smiling all the way. 

Okay I’m done :) cheers guys!

Got my pair this week, the overion mounts and superstar with 6.5 inchers are already in place. 12 series of 5 VTC6 are all welded up except the last one because I might have to split it :  the Escapes are slightly larger than focboxes. Now it's a race beween the Lacroix and the ESCapes. I need to start meditation otherwise i'm in for an impossible next few weeks.

Hey Ovi,

You’ve got me obsessed over the LaCroix board. After building five boards myself, I never thought I’d even consider buying another complete prebuilt board, but now I am (considering it). The complete LaCroix is very unique and seems to offer the fit and finish I prize...is it possible to pm me or post the videos of you riding it, I’m not on instagram (I’m old).

Off topic, I’ll be quick. That looks like the same 2 led light I have. It’s bright and brilliant and rechargeable. I ran into a problem with vibration on mine. There is a little coil on the pcb just behind lights that will rattle loose and eventually fall off. It’s only two screws to check it out. I resoldered mine and placed in in a bed of HD hot glue then covered it. Hopefully it stays put.

P.S. the rubber seal is a bit of a pain to get back in.

Back on topic 👍

Yeah that would be interesting to explore. However, I'm not convinced of its advantages over a belt yet. Looks better that's for sure, but seems more noisy and finicky to adjust to prevent premature wear. Anyhow, remains to be tested and be seen. Interesting concept, that's for sure.

The only thing I'm not at all convinced by with this deck is the included grip strip. I feel like it would be committing a sacrilege to mar the deck with that.

Thinking of trying out @longhairedboy technique of urethane spar & glass frit to get a better clear grip but I'm terrified of fucking it up somehow. I'm not that guy

and the only way to cancel would be to scrape it off and sand it. Also not sure if it's such a good idea with the carbon borders. 
What do you guys think?

@philvanzu -  I thought of the same thing, and had the same worries. The spray on grip never lasts too long and isn't as grippy either. I wouldn't want to have to sand down the carbon fibre. I bought the Vicious clear tape finally after trying the cheaper Jessup. 

It's not as clear as the Jessup and definitely not as clear as the spray on option, but it definitely is grippy! I killed two scissors cutting this up. I wouldn't cover the whole board with it but I think it doesn't look half bad. Would definetly love to be able to use a laser cutter for more intricate designs.

EDIT: You do have to clean clear grip tape almost after every ride if you want it to stay clear and not brown. I use a moist carpet brush and dish soap to get the dirt out and sponge it dry with a dry rag after. On the photo above, I had just applied it, it isn't quite as clean now

hahaha motivation and patience my friend! I did that the first night I got the board actually somewhere around 2-3am. I have been waiting for about a month to get it and was experimenting with different layouts on a mockup photo and some photoshop. I tried stripes, random blobs, arrows, abunch of stuff until I came back to hexagons. 

- I printed a few different sizes and cut them off to see which size i'd prefer. 
- I then reprinted the ones I liked, I used a blade to cut it out neatly and used the negative shape to draw the hexagons on the back of the griptape sheet. 
- I took some scissors and carefully started cutting the griptape, redrawing other ones as I needed. I went through two pairs of cheap scissors.
- As I was cutting them I was just laying them on the board without sticking anything. 
- When I figured I had enough and covered the main areas, I went back to photoshop and arranged 3 hexagons next to eachother, I printed and adjusted different times until I had the distance I wanted in between them. 
- On my sheet of paper that had the 3 hexagons at the right distance in between, I then put 4-5 layers of scotch tape to make it a little more rigid and I carefully, very carefully cut out with a blade the 3 point "star" that separates the hexagons. 
- I then used that as template to lay the hexagons at almost perfect distance appart. It's a big almost, I am very perfectionist by nature, I had to make peace with my almost perfect cut hexagons and then my almost perfect cut template and ultimately my almost perfect layout - The almost increases exponentially as you go down the line :D I really wish I had access to a laser cutter.
- For the stickiness of it, I guess the vicious tape really sticks well, and also the shapes are fairly big, the board is almost 11" wide so there's a lot of sticky surface under each shape. Also helps to start with a clean smooth board.
- One thing that is useful with these patterns is to start from the middle. I started with my middle hexagon, measured and marked the middle of the deck and built around it. 

These are some of the mockups I was playing with in the beginning, I was working on a Japanese themed board, still in progress, maybe for some more rainy days, as I can't seem to get off it for more than what the charging time takes.

@pat_arch looking good guys!

I ordered a blank deck while ruminating on what type of truck. Since then I did a naughty thing and ordered some trampa mini trucks so as to go for some 3dservisas drives on this bad boy.

Question: assuming my deck is coming blank and not with trampa holes per my email a few days back, is there any way to supply a pdf of the nose/tail to minimise any alignment issue? 

Thanks

Ps. Prefer if it could be factory drilled & apologies for the womanesque mind changing.
I'm going to move the furniture around for a bit now

Hey @banjaxxed, we'll send your board back to be drilled, no problem. You'll have the 4 "normal" truck holes. All you'll have to do is make the holes for the spring tensioner. This said, you'll be able to install the truck on the board with the 4 main screws so those spring tensioner holes will be easy for you to do.

To clean grip tape you can buy a "grip tape cleaning block" or a bar for "cleaning belt sanders and disks". It will work better ;)
I got one delivered to me on eBay for $14, it will last me a life time I think.

This unfortunately is not all that is needed. From my experience it's wire bursh and water, then dab up the dirt via a rag, finally use the rubber to clean.

The rubber alone u can be at it for 15mins and not do much... The wire brush helps loosen all the dirt so the rubber can pick it up

It's a real pain...

Edit: Well, I guess it's not as big of a problem when I thought about it for 5 minutes. Just send what you got, I'm somehow going to live with MBS Matrix 2. People seem to love it and I have no clue about MB trucks yet. Unless @banjaxxed won't convince me to trampa one. I like the idea of larger attachment points.

Mbs matrix 2 feel much more like regular skateboard trucks. They also allow more customisation, their shock block system comes with soft medium and hard blocks and each can be further compressed if you want more stability (but bigger turning circle). I feel the mbs is a better choice if you don’t plan to do extreme off road riding.

I don't have my Trampa trucks anymore so I can't say for sure, but I'm pretty sure the inner hole position of the Trampa baseplate lines up with MatrixII. 

![image|690x482](upload://vlMv9IhaMkNOLj6QYG8nRH766vm.jpeg) 

So if you're pre drilled for MatrixII, you should be able to use Trampa, but not the other way around. DK about the minis though.

Edit: might be better to drill yourself though. It'd be a fkn nightmare if they were just slightly off.

There's room for a 12S6P yes but with 2 focboxes (65x65x22mm iirc). It's the ESCapes' 70x77x18mm that I was worrying about - Since then I carved a piece of styrofoam to these dimensions and it looks like it's going to work - will only be sure when they are delivered though. 

I mostly went 12S because I had a 12S BMS. I was planning a trampa carver with 12S4P at first but reorganised my build around the lacroix deck and just bought 12 more cells since there was room for it.

I finally got my rear truck and modified motor mounts back from Overion (there were a few modifications with the newer series of Matrix II apparently and Yann had to adapt his mounts for it so I had to send my rear truck to him). 
So I was able to quickly assemble the board and hop onto it for the first time.
What an amazing feeling. The flex is absolutely perfect, flexy but not bouncy, absolutely fantastic level of comfort I have never felt like that on a skateboard before. I have the actual luxury of having wood under the whole length of my foot. Not even on my snowboard do I get that ! I'm so glad I dumped my trampa board right now :smile:

Looks great, I’d also flip the mounts and cut down the motor shafts down (if they contact the tire). The way it is now, there is more levarge/side load on the motor bearing

Yellow shockblocks are on the way. I ordered one Matrix2 with yellow shockblocks for the front truck but MBS changed their production and are now apparently delivering all new Matrix 2, pro or not with red shockblocks. When I complained they promised me a pair of yellow ones free of charge.

What modifications were done to the trucks? I noticed the shockblocks on my new set are red now rather than orange. Was wondering if there were any other changes.

I was actually thinking of trading a pair for orange ones if I can, so I will have the whole gamut to experiment with. The reseller told me MBS is sending me yellow ones but I'm still waiting with no news or tracking number so far. I hope they deliver.

edit ... and I believe shipping back and forth to CA <=> Belgium would actually cost more than new ones

As of today, the only public review we have was made by @Ovi in this very thread a little higher up. He can also properly compare a Trampa build to our DSS60 as we lent him a 12S4P Trampa Urban carver build for a week before we finished his board!

@HeyMacfly, @pat_arch
I’ve ridden it officially 495km now in just a few days short of a full month. I can say I tango’ed with it properly. I took two falls (nothing too bad) rode on different terrains, high speed low speed, long rides, I still get shivers when I take it out. This weekend I am at the Montreal GrandPrix (F1) for work and I commute with it here, I definitely feel like a rockstar coming in with my carbon Pass helmet and the slick carbon fibre accents on the board. Everybody including security give me thumbs up as I zip through. I’m pleasantly surprised to see how easygoing cops and security have been so far. I always wave or nod first but they always respond to it. What I love about this board like I mentioned in my initial comments above is it’s so unobtrusive until you floor it. People will give me strange looks when seeing my full face helmet going by ~5km/h and then zzzzzoooomm I’m gone! and I hear their exclamations fading in the back. The pneumatics have saved me so many times now it’s crazy. Wear your helmet and leather/protective gloves! Cheers!

How smooth is the acceleration curve?  I'm really interested but as lame as it sounds I kind of prefer a slow acceleration curve where the board doesn't absolutely blast out from under you if you get a little trigger-happy.  Also doesn't the board roll decently off throttle?  I wasn't super happy with my old Boosted because of how much friction there was with the belts, but I assume the bigger wheels help a good amount with that.  I'm just really happy with this cheap hub motor board (wowgo 2s, actually a great board for the money), because of how silky smooth the acceleration/braking curve is with the boosted copy remote.  Even during carving you can give it some gas and feel totally safe.  I assume with the power that this board has you'd have to exercise substantially more caution.?

@Adam0311 longest continuous ride I took was around 35km and I still had 20%. Depends on a lot of variables though. I once took a 25km and used almost 90% of the battery - wasn’t even going that fast but there was a lot of wind and some unpaved areas.  Sometimes I will push my girlfriend on her bike up the slopes but because I stay at her pace I can most likely hit the 50km range. I have a friend that lives 46km away, one day I’ll take my chances and see if I can make it. I’ll let you guys know

![IMG20180610090306|690x388](upload://bDQNK85lYe1e3utUuvBJkXrRDKT.jpg)

There are 3 styles of adapters:
1. Slide on for front trucks (LED is centered to truck)
2. Slide on for rear trucks (LED is offset to make space for motor)
3. Clamp on for rear trucks (LED is offset to make space for motor and doesn't require you to disassemble the entire drive to install the clamp, uses 2 x M3 screws)

The LED itself just slots in sideways... should be snug enough not to dislodge itself mid ride...

You are right they do look skinny now that I stare at it again after getting some sleep...

They are pairs of 16AWG (for the flex), I was considering the thickest wire I have will be 12AWG, so 2 x 16AWG should be enough to compensate.

Also note that I will unlikely be going at speeds of 40kmh++ as the legal limit is 25kmh where I stay (get caught and they DESTROY your board... no joke)

Maybe I'll bump them up to pairs of 14AWGs....

What would be the best way to tone the acceleration down a good amount tuning the focbox's?  I've been doing some research but some of the stuff is a bit out of my comfort range.  Is the software on Enertion’s site capable of doing it?  I see that people flash that user’s custom firmware and tune it using that, but that seems pretty complicated and I don’t really like how easy it is to mess things up.  I know it’s strange but I really like boards with super mellow curves.  I tried a Trampa setup yesterday and the power was way too aggressive for me, so I’m definitely going to be interested in figuring out some way of dialing it down.

Few options:
1. Power presets with metr.at module (you could set and change limits on the fly) - you could do the same in vesc tool (software from enertion website you mentioned) by limiting motor current
2. Ackmaniac's firmware (smoother curve)
3. Acceleration curve editor in vesc tool (I wasn't that happy with it)
4. Ride till you're comfortable

i recommend trying @Ackmaniac firmware. Much smoother acceleration curve and then take it slow and get used to the board. Give it a few days/100 miles or so and if you’re still not comfortable then reduce your motor current.

I may add that the 20T motor pulleys we use offer a smooth acceleration VS the 16T pulleys the Trampa build you tried most likely had. (we ship the boards with both pulley options)

Also, the Nano V2 remote we use comes with a ''Eco mode'' switch which limits the throttle to around 75%. When combined with the 20T pulley, this translates into a very smooth acceleration curve.

Thanks for all the info.  I guess I should just get more comfortable with messing around with it and go for the firmware flash, but I’ll start out with the 20t and eco mode.  The one thing I didn’t like about the ackmaniac flash was that it seems like if you manage to go over the top speed of the motors the board freaks out if you hit the gas and immediately slams back to the motor top speed potentially throwing you off.  I know I’d realistically never get into that situation but I didn’t like reading about people falling because of it.

@cap7ainclu7ch  - I can confirm what @pat_arch says, I run the 20T pulley. We have some roads here in Montreal that are closed to traffic for festivals and such and security makes me walk. I don't like to carry the board for a long time at 25lbs, so I switch it on "eco" mode and with a bit of practice I am able to make it roll beside me at the same speed I'm walking at with some slight nudges in between to correct direction. Somebody asked me yesterday what kind of dog is that. And yes, in the beginning I was losing balance while accelerating on the non eco mode, but a few weeks later, your body gets used to shifting the weight to keep balance.

@Adam0311 - to give you an idea, my girlfriend has a bicycle and we go riding together. She's not a pro cyclist or anything so whenever there's a steep hill I crouch on my board and grab hold of the luggage frame she has on the rear of her bike and I push her uphill with my board. We pass some of the other cyclists on the road while doing that. they all give us surprised looks because they see her all chill and not even pedalling and are expecting to see her pulling the longboard not the other way around. I was amazed how much power this board has, I can push her up some really steep hills and still feel the board accelerating. It's my arm that starts hurting after a while.

Yes, it does mellow it out quite a bit. So just to clarify, the remote control has a thumb trigger that doesn't work just in two steps go or stop. You can control the amount of power your board receives by how far you push your thumb on the throttle. It does take a few minutes to get used to it but it's not a big challenge. In ECO mode everything is limited. @pat_arch could tell you probably to which amount exactly, but it does mellow out the board quite a bit. So much that I am able with careful throttle control to make it roll at walking speed beside me with no weight on it. My girlfriend when she first tried it out she was going not much faster than walking speed on it. Push that throttle down, and even on ECO mode you will find yourself zooming by at 40km/h albeit with a slower acceleration. But you will see, you won't stay for long on the eco mode. The board is very wide and stable, the learning curve is also mellow :smiley: .Also on ECO mode you might get stuck in grass or on slopes, the torque is limited. 

And to answer your question, the awesome guys from LaCroix lent me a Trampa 12sp4 board they had built last year while I was waiting for mine (we live in the same city) and that board was programmed in BLDC, so everything was a little rough, acceleration, stopping, turning on the trampa trucks was horrible if you ask me compared to the MBS. But a week later, I had gotten somewhat used to it. And I also tried for a few minutes an Evolve bamboo GTX carbon. The GTX had a somewhat destabilizing acceleration for the first few meters and it mellowed out right after. Going back on the DSS60 felt like home. I wouldn't worry too much, just keep in mind everything takes a little practice no matter what you're doing. And wear the helmet! even if your just going over to the neighbour next door.

About 4-500km of street carving madness 😁, I’d say they have another 100km in them. They can last a lot longer if you don’t shred them everytime you ride the board, but I can’t control myself. We don't want you to be worried about doing the same, hence why we sell them so cheap! ;)

And just to add to this, it's one of the reasons we provide a spare wheel with pulley. So you can actually ride on the tires until one pops (from experience, your toe-side rear wheel will pop first, it takes the most beating when you carve like you're Travis Rice) and change it on the fly. It's also why we sell the tires at cost price, so you can ride without caring.

Honestly, there is still a lot of life left in those tires. The initial thread goes away quite quickly, in the first 50-75km or so. After that, you can do another 400km+ on the tires being «slicks» (i.e. sans thread, like in the picture). In fact, until you see the textile layer, you shouldn't worry about it. Just be wary if you ride on rocks because the tire is obviously thinner the more you go - but gravel has never been a problem for me, even on almost finished tires where I saw the textile in multiple spots.

Thanks!  I've ridden a Trampa with the same remote along with Boosted/Wowgo which also use a similar thumb control.  I know I can definitely get used to the power, but I just prefer the feeling of a slower board honestly.  I know I'm in the minority there though haha.  Mainly picking up DSS60 for the carving and ability to not worry about bad roads, and I think it will do that job excellently, so thats why I'm just trying to figure out what my options are for cutting the power down, but seems like the 20t and eco mode are a good place to start.

Erv, I believe you have red blocks in the rear - I found those to be a little to stiff. And if you ordered some orange ones and are waiting for them, in the meantime you can simply drill a small hole through them. Just pass a small drill bit through the hole underneath the Shockblock and drill straight through. You'll remove enough material to make the red block less stiff. Just FYI if ever this can help.

195lbs riding weight. But i like them soft because I love to carve the living hell out of them (video coming soon). My brother, on the other hand, likes them a bit stiffer because he likes to go fast (30kmh+ in average). For me, i like to stay between 25kmh and 35kmh so I slightly compress heel side blocks, but not much. I like a soft set up. Keep in mind this board gets a little time to get used to. It really is like nothing else out there. Just take it slow. In a couple of days, you'll be ripping.

Exactly. The best way we found to describe it is it's a summer snowboard. That flex will actually allow you to do longer rides without fatigue, will allow you to go over potholes and curbs without even thinking about it but most importantly, will flex during heavy carving much like a snowboard in deep powder. And that's really how and where the board shines imho. Anyhow, that's just my own personal experience, I can't wait for you guys to share yours as you become more comfortable on it.

Ah! So my latching push switch has a little LED inside but that meant I needed to wire something from the back to the front of the board... 

So I just used an old 5V colour selectable LED strip that I had left over from my RC quad days, wired it to the spare 5V out from the slave VESC.

Matek RGB LED Board 5050 5V for RC Drone FPV Racing
https://banggood.app.link/urHh0ZJhKN

I removed the dip switch and hard wired it for red.

I then drilled 3 small holes and used clear hotglue to simulatenously seal the holes and hold the LED strip in place 

The only thing it does is to let me know when the board is on, nothing else... 3 dots just cos the strip has 3 LEDs... Figured it would look pretty cool.

Yes, all the boards we ship come with yellows in front and orange in back. Unless you're really light, like 100-150lbs, then we'd put yellows in the back as well. 

I think if you are between 150 lbs and 250lbs riding weight, yellow in front and orange in the back allow enough adustability for just about anyone.

TB218 trucks and reverse drives are not going to work for me although the angle problem may have been not a big thing the drives sealed the fate, that and I think with 218s the pnummie size maybe a problem maybe not with the 7” Innova tires LaCroix sent me, thanks boys

@Sender the double sided sticky tape failed dramatically and I had to put stuff away before kids get back, but if you look at the front truck there’s an angled riser and a Randal baseplate...the hanger is regular Caliber on the front, I think you can do it if you are of the mind with smaller pnummies and long SurfRodz
 
Also thanks for the pnummie bears my girls will be gummin’ for those

Trampa mini trucks are longer than TB218, inside there’s a surprise thanks to the removal of the ESCs we are talking 12s7p or maybe more interestingly 13s6p

**Edit:** I seemed to have mislaid a row of cells there for those calcs ^ :sweat_smile: Ok more to do on what can fit with the arrangement below, but you get the gist, certainly 12s6p is a do-er

Discharge only bms and ultimate spark switch

Backlogged with other stuff mostly life/work, so don’t expect an urgent build thread, just wanted to share this awesome product with even more options

I need to build up cash reserves for more drives, not sure on @3DServisas schedule for next run of mini Trampa drives or if I will be able to maybe make myself afford to ‘enter the silence’ with some mini 4:1’s and a pair of 6384s

Now back to the Trampa HolyPro, geterdone

My longest ride to date! Don’t mind the total time it took, I stopped to drop a box at Purolator and then stopped by to say hi to @Pete and see how he’s doing. The first 23km I went pretty hard on the throttle albeit not continuous. I am thinking carving takes a bit more battery as well because the wheels are constantly being pushed sideways. The second half was mostly on eco mode at around 20-25km/h and the last 3 km were at pushing speed with a few pushes here and there as I was afraid to damage the batteries. 45km total !! I would say it was more like a 37 practical ones :D but still not bad. Maybe for my next battery pack we can fit larger cells and still manage a 10s6p maybe with a focbox unity and a split last pack. I could have ridden for another hour or so if the board could have taken it.

Never be afraid to damage the battery. The board is configured with a soft cut-off to preserve the battery. Before getting into critical low voltage, we reduce the board's power substantially. When you hit that, the board will have like 30% of its power. That means you have 1-2 miles left before the board dies. And even then, when the board is "dead", it's still at a safe voltage so as to not damage the battery. 

TAKEAWAY: ride till it dies. Don't worry about the pack. We did that for you.

Yes, it really can. It's a bag made for doing backcountry touring on snowboards (split-boards) and works perfectly with our board. It's small but really made to carry a load comfortably and even when it's full, the bag remains slim so the board is not far away from you and won't throw you off balance.

Your guess is as good as mine, I think I see some foam/rubber padding on top of the packs. If they are free to 'jiggle' maybe a good idea to put some under as well until there is no jiggle room left.

Using those PCB deck should definitely help keep things solid, if you do decide to use some velcro, do use the strong stuff from 3M.

Personally given all the fires of late I would be securing(&/or foam padding them out) them to stop any possibility of friction causing a short somewhere, also it weighs a lot & you don't want to damge the enclosure....but I think Arch/Pat's opinion would be more valuable.

It's much thiner than kydex I have in my regular board but it has ribbing giving it proper stiffness. It looks like much more susceptible to external mechanical impacts though but durability under battery weight is not a question. I could stand on it laying flat with no harm but foam/silicon for soundproofing is a must. I used double sided foam tape (sparingly as it seem) and I still can hear internals rattle sometimes.

Hey @philvanzu, that sucks. Most likely a bad apple. I've screwed more than 1000 now and didn't snap any. 

In my opinion, if I were to torque a screw that much to a point where it would snap, I think something else would fail first (the insert maybe? don't know). Also, as a general comment, you should not torque the screws too much. The screw should go in easy and when you start feeling resistance when the nylon washer (underneath the countersunk washer) is touching the enclosure, maybe do one revolution (or less), then stop. 

The screws are M3 phillips because as you can see, they sit just a fraction of a millimiter under the countersunk washer. This enables the washer to be on a very slight angle on the sections of the deck that are curved. As the holes for the inserts in the deck are made with a 3 axis CNC and not a 5 axis CNC, the holes are not always at 90 degrees with the top of the deck - sometimes at 88 or 89 degrees. So the M3 screw being just below the countersunk washer allows this washer to move a slight bit and compensate for that 1 degree or 2 degree. 

I know this is some solid geekery but all this to say that if you choose to get other screws, perhaps screws that sit perfectly in the washer (and that doesn't allow for this 1 or 2 degree movement), then maybe some of the screws will not sit perfectly flat on the enclosure. Also, we wanted all the screws to be all black (because aesthetics ;) So that is the reason we used these specific countersunk Philipps M3 screws.

But by all means, if you do find another solution (other screws that would do), please share. This is one of the reasons why we offered the deck+enclosure at the community, to get your feedback and ideas and implement them.

Also, for those wondering, we used M3 and not M4 to keep the hole in the enclosure as small as possible as to maintain its integrity and strenght as much as we could. And after looking at the spec numbers, M3 could more than handle the weight so we went in that direction.

As for replacement, I should have sent you a couple extras right? Let me know if not and I'll send you a couple in the mail.

It's all good, fortunately you provided 20 screws for 18 holes so I'm not in search of a replacement yet.
As I said the screw just snapped and I still wonder why. It was pretty loose otherwise I would have had to dig a much deeper groove to get enough grip to get it out. Probably a bad apple as you said.

It seems pretty common for a fairly cheap remote to be paired with a 'premium' board, but I think the general consensus is that the Nano V2 is reliable... which is the primary concern, IMO.  The only board that comes with a premium feeling, cool looking remote that I know of is the Evolve R2, but I've heard stories about that one freezing or cutting out, etc... I'd rather have the Nano, TBH.

[Here's a review](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/nano-v2-full-review/25159) from another user (from a year ago) and there may be others.  

I would not expect to be blown away by the build quality, though...  If it's anything like the Enertion Nano, it looks and feels cheap.

The Bajaboards have a cool remote with display and telemetry. But yeah, I was generally thinking of evolve. The Boostedboard remote seems pretty well liked, though no fancy display or anything.

Sorry if thats a stupid question, I've just been bombing some hills on my board lately and its fun going for a more traditional downhill feeling and just using gravity.  I don't have much experience with belt setups.  Also in that video Maxaweli mentions a custom battery pack which is more expensive than the standard one, is that an option for the completes or was that just a one-off?

It rolls very well down hill. As for the pack, it's a proto in Max's board. We don't offer it at the moment.

Probably Sanyo NCR20700B 4250mAh - 15A ? interesting. but for the price difference it's not really worth it, you need to almost double-down on cell costs.

Tries some calcs...open to correction, weight difference fairly negligible

60 30Q in 10s6p = 90A+ discharge, capacity 18Ah, 666Wh @ nominal 3.7v cell voltage
Pack weight: 2880g

50 NCR20700B in 10s5p = 75A+ discharge, capacity 21.25Ah, 786.25Wh @ nominal 3.7v cell voltage
Pack weight = 3150g

I don't know how much of a badass the NCR20700B  is for discharge, maybe in real life a 5p can take on a 30Q 6p for discharge.

Personally I'd prefer to get a spare 40 30Q cells for another build at the same cost...

There's one more angle for cost comparison -- cycle life. I think 30q are 250-300 cycles to 70%. 20700B looks like about 500 cycles at similar discharge rates. So that makes up the price gap.

But I'm with you, unless prices come down by a lot, 30q is king.

I think you're looking at about 18Wh er mile, the regular board is looking like a range of ~37mls depending on rider weight/terrain/tire pressure.

The 20700 pack mentioned above would give ~43mls rage for the same set of circumstances.

Would wouldn't wanna stop and recharge the body and board after almost 60km?...I'm a Euro, gotcha there with the old km switch :smiley:

I would be interested if anyone can comment on this board's suspension. I see it does not have springs, how well does it handle uneven pavement, etc. 

I am torn between a fully built board like the DSS60 and building my own board like a Trampa Urban Carve.

@slybarman  Hi, if you're looking for spring suspension, you would need a Bajaboard. Both the springs and bushings in the trucks of the Trampa vs the DSS60 only fulfill the function of steering dampening. The board itself absorbs shocks and vibrations but not the trucks directly. And from that point of view both the Trampa and the DSS60 are flexible decks. The hump on the Trampa is a foot killer in my experience, horrible cramps from the shape of the deck and no concave means you never know where your feet are on the board. In my own experience the Trampa doesn't even come close in any way (Not an endorsed advertisement). However if you're planning on off-roading, maybe there's room for discussion. The beautiful carbon fibre case of the DSS60 is heart breaking to scratch on rocks, and it is closer to the ground than the Trampa board I used. You could always use 8" knobbed tires on the DSS60, but again, I feel it shines at its brightest on pavement, like a Porsche ;)

I got my complete DSS60 last friday. It is a piece of beauty. 

I must say that I am not in any way an expert in Esk8. I have a chinese mountainboard that I used to like but it is over now (ninestep 2000w that i got on amazon). 

The power of the DSS60 is super predictable. I like the acceleration curve. No problem going at 5 km/h or putting the power back after going down a hill. The sound of the motors is verry addictive and not too loud in my opinion. we got verry steep hills in Rivière-du-Loup, Québec. Going up a long and steep hill, i was amazed that i didn't even need to go full trottle to go up... and that is was still possible to accelerate while doing so.  The brakes are predictable and efficient. 

The feeling of carving with a flexible board is amazing. 

I think that those two brothers will be in business for long time. 

Few days and already about 100 km... I would have done way more without youg kids at home...:slight_smile:   

BTW, it's the first time of my life (i am 40 years old) that i take the time to review something I buy. I dot it mainly so people can share my joy of riding a Lacroix and also cause those Brothers deserved it for creating such a refined machine.

Hello everyone.  I just got my DSS60 this week as my first e board.  Been snowboarding 20 years, wanting an e board for a few years and finally pulled the trigger when I saw the DSS60 for sale.

Loving it so far the few times I've ridden it.  It's very powerful so definitely have to use a lot of caution in the beginning with acceleration and braking.

Anyway I have a couple beginner questions here.

1. What app do you use to connect to the board, monitor speeds, distance, battery, etc?

2. What are all the functions of the buttons on the included remote?  Obviously the thumb lever is to go/brake, and the bottom switch is on/off.  Is the up/down switch on the back for high/low power modes?  What about the other two buttons - one near the LED, and the other near the bottom of the handle part?  What functions are those programmed for with the DSS60?

Thanks!

I believe you have MBS 8 inch tires right? Anyhow, we don't use them on ur completes but specially for the rear wheels, you need to be super careful on the pulley placement because if it's 0.5mm out of true then it will cause wobble. We 3D printed a little jig to center the pulley on the hub before tightening the screws and we are going to upload the file to the website in a couple of days so everyone can just 3D print their own little centering jig. When I use it, I hardly feel anything, no wobble at all. Also, if you must, balancing beads work well too; https://www.amazon.ca/DIYK-4-Counteract-Tire-Balancing-Beads/dp/B06W2N5MTW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1530413895&sr=8-1&keywords=balancing+beads

Our tires are rated 36psi but I inflate them at 50psi without any issues.

yeah, those tires are far from precision parts and some definitely are more out of true than others. Those 8 inch knobby tires were not exactly conceived to go at those speeds... As time passes, I think we will have more options in 7 and 8 inch tires that are made for esk8.

Flats are a pain in the butt, as any cyclist or motorcyclist will tell you, no matter how careful you are, they will happen eventually. Slime does help, but it definitely isn’t foolproof. Once you patch a couple tubes, you’ll realize it’s really no big deal.

FWIW, I haven't had a chance to try it yet... and it was under the context of larger bike tires... but I've heard goop tire sealant works much better than slime and supposedly lasts much longer as well (years vs. months).  Not sure if anyone has used that one on 7/8" tires, though.

I don't have a scale so I used the valve caps as measure. I first added 2 and then added another one. Its a little tricky. If you don't add enough it won't solve your problem and if you add too much it can get worse, especially at low speeds. You can feel the vibration almost instantly disappear after 25km/h it's strange it's like a switch going off. For the beads to even out it takes some centrifugal force, and I noticed under 25km/h not much happens and especially if you have too many beads at slower speed they tend to stay all in one spot and worsen wobble. I advise you start with a little bit, ride for a few days and add more if needed after. Also, YOU WILL MAKE A MESS. Make yourself a funnel out of paper if you don't have one that small to fit in the valve already and add a few beads at a time. It helps if you gently tap the valve end as your pour them down. Hope this helps!

I read a review about Nano V2 remote and there is something that worries me. 
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/nano-v2-full-review/25159

"BIGGEST con to this remote is the auto-bind feature. Aside from possibly taking a long time to bind (anywhere from 1-10 seconds, usually faster though) it does not remember PPM positions across reboots of the remote. Once you turn it off and on you have to throttle all the way back and all the way forward after the remote binds in order for it to know min/max PPM. If you don’t do this, the SLIGHTEST change in PPM signal will give you either max acceleration or max braking. This nearly made me fly off my board the first couple times until I figured out what was wrong."

There is a interview with Alex from Lacroix boards >
https://graeme-franks.squarespace.com/lacroixboards-faq

"3) Reading the review of the remote, they say you need to calibrate it every time because it doesn’t remember “Min or Max speed” is this what you do? And how do you do it?

Once you turn on the remote, you throttle to the max and brake to the max. Then you turn on the board, the remote will bind and that's it. So it's just doing max throttle and max brake when you turn on the remote. "

I have two Nano v2 remotes, been using one of them for close to a year. I just now started doing the calibration start (turn on, full throttle, full brake, turn on board). Previously, I noticed some inconsistencies in sensitivity, but nothing harsh enough to throw me from the board.

@Arch @pat_arch  will it be possible to use larger pneumatics? Is a gear drive also an option? Do you also need to calibrate (throttle up and down) everytime? Wouldn’t it be more convenient not to have to do so everytime you’d want to use the board? I’ve got bad pavement in my area with rough cement roads and cracks so I’m concerned about how well it can take those as well as going over gravel and grass(that last part just for fun) but I’m not taking it up a mountain or anything. Just maybe short dirt trails or over grass in parks. I’m considering the DS550+ actually cause the range looks so good!

Calibration takes maybe two seconds and as I stated in an earlier post, I’ve been using the same remote for about 1 year and just (within the past two weeks) started doing the calibration. The remote works fine without the calibration, but it’s a bit less consistent on the sensitivity...never once caused me to crash though and I’m using it on a short jet spud and I’m a tall guy. Bottom line, do the calibration, but if you forget, don’t sweat it.

Thanks @adam0311! I was thinking the calibration was necessary in order to safely operate it. is the calibration a need due to the Nano itself? will switching remotes remove the need to do so just out of curiosity. Also wondering about any security mechanisms in place if there are any? (I work in the Info Security field so its something on my mind for Esk8 in general)

To my knowledge the calibration is specific to the nano v2...perhaps those more knowledgeable will correct that, but of the seven boards I’ve had (six of which I built) it’s the only remote I’ve heard of needing calibration. Remotes can be swapped out quite easily...usually takes longer to remove and reattach the enclosure. That’s the great thing about @pat_arch and @Arch using focbox’s...really no mysteries, nearly any fix or upgrade can researched and addressed via a few hours reading on this forum

My feelings are that a 9" or 10" option for real offroad makes a lot of sense for not too much extra weight.
**9" tire option:** 2.80/2.50 - 4
So you get an exra 15mm in width too, this spreads load and helps stop spinning wheel problems. For me it's primarily dealing with sand, at present I can't even go near anything not hard-packed, but muddy backroads, green lane trails, probably a similar problem

Caveat: I have not tries 8" Trampa mud pluggers yet.

The power would be plenty from a dual 6374 even from a standstill & top speed only increases which is maybe a danger if anything, downside? Maybe a little extra weight but it's largely insignificant on the type of build under discusssion.

You can already do a chain or pulley driven 9" build using Trampa, MBS or DIY printed hubs, I am hoping for a vendor produced hub/wheel drive combo, I don't want to say anything and step on any vendor announcement

But watch this space and save your shekels for concentrated off-road awesomeness

Yep, they fit 7 inch as well. As long as the hub is 3.75 inch in diameter, it will fit all known 7inch and 8 inch AT tires. In fact, the Rockstar2 might not fit MBS's 7 inch tire (which they only sell on a 3 spoke hub), but it will fit Innova 7 inch tires and Evolve tires as well. So when MBS says it will only fit 8 inch tires (and not 7 inch tires), they only refer to their own 7 inch tires, not 7 inch tires in general. It's confusing, I'll give you that.

For 9" you need to use the Fivestar hubs, whether they have the same hole pattern as Rockstar II, not sure.

They do have an extra lip inside to handle fitment of both 8" and 9" tires

Put about 10mi on the board tonight and here are some initial thoughts. 

This board...it’s just impossible not to carve on it. It reminds me of my Triumph Daytona 675, a bike I bought thinking I had the track experience to just thrash, when in fact it could corner harder and faster than I was prepared to, the bike was more capable than I was. The DSS60, right now, will carve harder than I’m prepared to carve on it. Granted it only been 10mi...I just wasn’t expecting it to be this capable at carving and yet feel completely stable at all times...it really is surprising. 

Anyway, I’m going to put some real miles on it over the next several days and then do a little review.

8A for 10S4P 30Q setup at 0,6C rate, where 0,5 is standard charge for 30Q and 1,3C is fast charge. Safe for batteries but charger will be pretty bulky. I’m charging 10S2P LiPos with 4A, starting from 37V in 1,5h which gives around 6Ah that allows me to ride for 20km with average speed of 20kmh (going up to 50). I could always go with lower cuttoff voltage but why bother when it’s full relatively fast.

Actually after I won't really recommend to go over the 4A charger that come with the board, not that the battery won't take it, but some component inside are not conceive with a different charger in mind. Switching the charger for a bigger one comme at your own risk.

Assuming they are not using a 5A BMS, what else would be at risk?

I'm planning on sticking w/ a 4A charger, but if you confirmed the continuous charge current BMS was >= 10A, I (perhaps mistakenly) wouldn't have any concerns using a 8A charger, etc.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT !!! and I won't recommend using any none proprietary charger for any board on the market, because it usually hasn’t been tested, and other passive components (like cable, connector, fuse) might not have the required tolerance.

Even thin cables are already capable od transfering such current, which if you think about, is pretty low regular eskate use wise. Charging at 0,6 C is pretty comfortable for battery either. So what I meant is that there should be only fuse and BMS that might not have required tolerance you mentioned.

DIYers who want to charge their boards at 8A can do so if they build their setup with this in mind. Although this thread mostly covers custom builds made with our DIY kit, I will not comment for everyone’s custom setup but rather for the LaCroix DSS60 or DSS50+. I hope this will avoid any confusion.

We offer a 4A charger with the board (the same one Evolve sells separately as their Fast Charger) and we don’t allow the use of any other 3rd party chargers for reasons mentionned in posts above.

Cheers!

LaCroix in Venice Beach. Rode this beast all the way from Redondo Beach (about 17miles one way). Lost the right front bushing somewhere along the way...surprisedly I could barely tell I was missing the bushing...rode all the way home with no trouble at all. Pretty crazy.

BTW, the bike path in Venice is pure madness this time of year. Spent about 5 min dodging people stopping in middle of the bike path and hundreds Bird scooters laying everywhere before I gave up and turned around.

Craving pretty hard, but nothing crazy, didn’t even ride off curbs because I don’t want to scratch the enclosure or motor mounts. No crashing, didn’t even really feel unstable. This was roughly halfway through 40 mile day. Basically rode about 20 miles with one front bushing, haha! It was front toe side bushing (yes, yellow), adjustment screws is still in there. I was turning some tight heel side circles in a parking lot at one point and I suspect it popped out then, but who knows. 

Appreciate you sending a replacement out.

The screw is flush with the surface, I really don’t know how it came out. There were two instances where potentially it could have come out. The first was while turning tight circles in a parking lot. The second was when crossing one of the wooden canal bridges in Venice beach, I picked the board up by the front truck hanger. It’s a heavy board, so maybe picking it up was enough to compress the one side and allow the opposing bushing to pop out.

Yeah, I watched that video yesterday...I clearly didn’t have the adjustment screw tight enough. 

To answer your question, no, you won’t scrape the enclosure from carving. I’ve avoided riding off curbs though, you’ll likely scratch either the enclosure, motor mounts or both. Everything is pretty robust, I’m sure the mounts and enclosure would it fine, but I prefer not to test it.

I will be pulling the trigger and buying your board in the next couple of days.  Still researching lights that will work the best, here has given me some great ideas, esp the 3d printed thing.

Also wondering what you would consider the best backpack to go with it.  Yes, I know you sell the Osprey Kamber 22, and I agree it's a good one.  But I need something larger for trips to the store and gym.  

I'd love to get an Obed bag but I can't seem to get ahold of the guy and get a response because he never has stock.  Also considering the Kamber 42 since REI has it on closeout at $141.   Any other ideas?  Will the Evolve bag work with a board this size and weight?

It seems to be a somewhat relatable issue even if not « known ». Although I cannot prove it since I was knocked out, after my accident with my DSS60, one of my yellow shock blocks was missing as well. Maybe you were lucky to have really smooth roads in LA but I am pretty certain that the missing part is what threw me off balance at the first imperfection from the road I was riding on. My head (helmet) hit the pavement causing a mean concussion followed by the sale of my board. I advise everybody to carefully inspect the placement of their shock blocks (and the screw underneath) before riding to avoid any serious injuries like mine. I have to say however that I am little disappointed that @Arch says he never heard of it when I specifically spoke with him about this issue when it happened. Ride safely!

You are right @Pete, you did mention to us that you had lost a shockblock after your accident a few weeks ago. However, it was never mentioned that you thought the shockblock was the cause of your accident but rather the result of the board flying off after you hit uneven pavement during your night run. We were made aware only when you told us that you would like to purchase a new one in order for you to be able to sell your board. That is certainly why @Arch and myself didn't even think about it when we saw @Adam0311's post. We are by no means trying to hide anything or even withhold information, this is simply something that we did not think was remotely related.

Now that you imply that it ''might'' have been the cause of your accident, we will only stress the importance for users to make sure to check bolts frequently, these are fast moving, street carving machines, a pre ride inspection is highly recommended to avoid any bad lucks. 

We really hope that you are recovering from your accident and feeling better.

Being knocked unconscious and getting a concussion is freaking scary, can’t say I blame you for rethinking the whole esk8 thing. 

On the shockblock issue, losing a shock block on the front truck does reduce stability somewhat, but I’ve never felt in danger of crashing from it and I’ve probably ridden 40 miles over some pretty mixed terrain since it went missing. I actually suspect, due to the geometry of the trucks, you could get away without any bushings in the front, as long as you rode at a moderate pace...not that I would recommend it. 

I think I’ll follow @Ovi suggestion and stick some hot glue on the adjustment pins.

Wholeheartedly agree with my brother. As we have never experienced a lost ShockBlock after 5000km nor heard of anyone losing one either, coupled to the fact that you yourself had no recollection of what happened, we concluded (and you confirmed that was certainly a strong possibility) that the lost block was a consequence of the crash (a hard one, to boot) and not the cause. As for this new situation, @Adam0311's situation seems to have been cause by human 'error', see comments above. 

Our #1 priority is safe and reliable boards. Period. This said, it can be dangerous (depending on how you ride) and we warn people that do not have extensive experience on boards (of any sorts, whether is be kite, surf, snow, whatever) to be very careful. You unfortunately learned that the (very) hard way and I join voices with my brother in wishing you a good recovery. I am saddened that you have left the sport but I can certainly understand in the circumstances. Stay safe Pierre, 
A

PS: if any of you ever experience a lost shockblock, please be sure to ping us so we can investigate. So far, these 2 cases seem to be outliers with specific causes/circumstances and not a product defect. We can only confirm this by sharing future data, if ever there is any.

Pat and Arch, Would it be possible for you guys, or any reader here, to produce a check-list of screws and bolts that are safety-related? Somme sort of pre-flight check-list.

As for safety goes, my surgeon saw the result of hitting pavement at 40 km/h. No brain injury, lucky-me. I must precise that nothing on my dss60 was defective.

That machine is so confortable and fun to ride... can’t wait for getting back on it...two months to wait... 

I understand this beast needs to be ridden respectfully. I have over-estimate my ability. After an hour of fun, a bit blurred by the adrenalin, thinking that the the battery would have fade... I punched the trottle while carving. Not my brightest idea of the year according to my collar bone.

This is a great point. It's the way everyone should approach our boards. This board was created so that the user is the limit because the board can always give you more. Just like you must respect the mountains and your abilities when big mountain skiing, you must respect the board and your abilities on a DSS.

I've got a question about the batteries.  On your site, you list under the geek deets at the end.  The dss60 uses the Samsung 30 18650s?  And the dss50+ uses the Sanyo 20700s?  Correct.

Basic research seems to suggest that the Sanyo has a higher capacity and a higher recharge rate, or it can be recharged something like 3000ish times and the Samsung is rated around 300ish times.  Just trying to confirm, to help make a final decision

Keep in mind that, I suppose, they use the same BMS and same focbox settings for both batteries. That means that it will spare the 30q because they are 6p and 90amps discharge than 5p 75amps from 20700b. So that's a factor to consider :man_shrugging:

Yes, the Sanyo's have a much better cycle rating, but 30q's are the best (that I've seen) w/r/t the amount lost per their cycle rating among the top 18650 cells... I think they lose 6% over their rated cycle life (most others I've seen are closer to 10%).  The other thing to consider is how you are planning on using your board.  IE: if you only charge to 80-90% and don't discharge it below 20%, then you should be able to extend the cycle life on the 30qs into the thousands as well.  If you're charging to full and running it into the ground (as the other extreme), then the cycle life is going to be a bigger factor.

In my experience (_mostly_ from ebikes), the best way to keep a balanced pack happy and healthy is to keep it between 20%-85% and then once every 20-30 cycles, charge to full and let the BMS balance the cells (otherwise, if you never charge to 100% the voltages between packs can get out of whack).

Personally, I opted for the DSS50+.  Between the cycle rating and how the cells discharge, the Sanyos were a better fit for me, because I wanted to maximize the range while keeping the cells from spending too much time below 3.2v (SAnyos drop off pretty hard after 3.2v where the Samsung drop is more gradual, meaning more of the total capacity is in the usable range for Sanyo's (lacroix has soft cutoff at 3.2v, IIRC)).  

Based on the cutoff limits and some isolated test results, it appears that the Sanyo pack may only have ~11% more range total (down to the 2.9v hard cutoff... which is purely based on Mooch's testing, which rated the Sanyo cells at 16a ~4000mah vs the commonly advertised 15a 4250mah) than the Samsung pack (if ridden to the board's 2.9v cutoff), but the Sanyo pack has 25% more range before hitting the 3.2v soft cutoff, which was significant for me, since that's level I want to stay above, unless forced otherwise.  This also assumes a 'coasting' load of ~15A draw from the battery... a spike in current when running low would cause voltage drops which could trigger the cutoffs sooner, etc (not sure how the 6p of Samsungs handles voltage sag compared to the 5p Sanyos, so that's not taken into consideration).

^ kind of a lot of random thoughts combined with limited testing/rating results + dirty analysis, etc, but maybe that helped answer your question? :sweat_smile:

I have around 1150km on my DSS60 so far and I haven't been too cautious with battery charging, most of the time charging it to 95%, and discharging it to ~ 20%  most of the time but I have been discharging to lower than that a few times lately as I've gotten a lot more comfortable riding it the past weeks. I crave to go further and accelerate harder and climb steeper hills. So far my top range since I have the board was 42km on a full charge, at the end I had 2% left. The last 2 km were mostly assisted pushing so I'm not sure if that counts. I weigh ~73-75KG depending on my lunch. Nowadays I ride about 30-35km on a good day and use ~80-85% of the battery doing that. But there are quite a few hills I go up where I live. And for the regenerative braking, in my experience there's not much going back into the batteries, maybe the BMS is too restrictive or maybe I don't brake enough :D 

We would need to have graphene ultra capacitors in our boards :D https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ2Eo6wl5r0

I will keep you updated on how my battery keeps up with time, from what I understand the price of a new battery is a massive hit to the wallet, I hope I can comfortably stretch it over the next summer as well, but I definitely crave more range already. If my board could do it, I would go on camping trips with this thing. I would love to get 70-80km range out of it in fun mode.

@Arch just found out about your board and spend the last couple of hours doing research.  I'm from Michigan (basically on the border to canada next to windsor), and I'm HIGHLY interested in this board.  

My only reservation is shipping delays and issues.  I just heard that you had a million dollars worth of business already, that's like 450 boards sold.  How will you be able to get these out within the promised time frame of 4-6 week??  Just seems impossible.  

If I order today, what's a REALISTIC ship time?  I've had some pretty bad experiences with ridiculous delays before.

> that’s like 450 boards sold

I try not to count other people's $$, but keep in mind there are other factors to consider like exchange rate (the article referencing a million in sales was likely CAD not USD), plus they were open for a few months selling only enclosures/decks... so without knowing those sales #s, any estimates around complete deck sales would be speculation at best (not to mention other factors like accessory sales, upgrades, etc).

EDIT: point is moot apparently, as I guess the estimated ship time has decreased... not increased :).

What I meant, and this is only an assumption, is that I believe they got assembly figured out to the point where they can accurately predict ETA, given that even the firsts boards they sold were pretty spot on. Beyond that I don't think anybody can guarantee unforseen events, but I hope you get yours soon, it's a joyride! :)

Looking to try out COB light but I heard they don’t last for more than a month because of heat issues or I could reduce the voltage from 12v to maybe 10v.

Essentially, the extra range is nice, but you’re really paying up for the longer life cycle. Treat the 18650 right and it will still last a couple years, at the pace battery technology is advancing...who knows there may be something even better once the 30q goes down.

Yep, it’s not cheap. Not sure what kind of riding you do, but if you like to carve or snowboard...you’ll be glad you spent the money. It’s without question the sweetest carving board I’ve ever ridden. 

@Ovi has several posts on here about the board and I was slightly worried that he was biased because he’d already forked over the cash for the board, but I’ll tell you everything he says about the riding experience is accurate. If you like to carve this is the board for you, it’s that simple. 

It’s also fast and comfortable, but there are plenty of fast boards and lots of reasonably comfortable boards...there are no boards (that I know of) that carve like this thing.

Not really sure. Looks like the adjustment screw may have been a half turn too lose and the bushing popped out under hard carving or turning tight circles. Or maybe I had a bad bushing...MBS says they’ve not heard one popping out before. I’m still riding it with one and have never felt unstable, so don’t really see it being the cause of a crash, but anything is possible I suppose.

I have something like 30miles on it with one front bushing. Not tried taking out the other, but I suspect the stiffer rear bushings combined with the truck geometry allows for more stability than you would expect. 

The only time I even notice the bushing missing is on harder right turns and then it just turns faster than the other side, but feels completely controlled. 

My jet spud with everything working perfectly feels more sketchy to ride than the LaCroix with an MIA front bushing.

@FredSaberhagen You can but you need massive risers. Any wheel below 6.5´´ will leave you with very little clearance. Remember the deck is wide and flexible and the trucks lean quite a bit.
Search through @Sender ´s posts in « Pictures only no words » to see an example albeit without a battery case attached

With the enclosure attached, 107mm wheels, Surf Rodz adjustable RKP baseplates and 1/2" risers.... I have just under 90mm clearance.  

Very close to stock setup clearance IIRC.

I gain a good bit of clearance because the adjustable base plase are fairly tall.

Let me tell you, this board with this setup, gives me the chills.

We are doing a second one with Surf Rodz TKPs (adjustable base plates).  I think I can fit @psychotiller sixshooters in this config.  But my buddy pushed around and road some hills with some 107s, and he wants that instead.

Hell, I don't blame him. It carves and rides like a dream.  Seriously just insane.  I can't wait to share the build process with everybody soon.

@mmaner pushed it around analog style, and I think he would agree that this setup will be next level!!!

Just ORDERED, with Sanyo batteries.  

There were a few concerns I had after trying to contact like everyone who owns the board (there aren't many in the wild).

1) bushings popping out, this could be a safety issue.  I'm still not sure what the verdict on this is, but I'll trust them when they say they've never had it happen and these 2 were instances were just anomalies

2) One person who has the board has some issues with heating or something, it's in the NYC shop with Kaly.  DIY builds always concern me because I often feel like they are in the shop more than you are riding them.  I am hoping this was just because the rider who uses it is an extremely aggressive rider and did things beyond what he was supposed to be doing.  Still no conclusion on this though.  @Arch if you know anything about this, fill me in


Now the wait begins, I'll post a video review on youtube and stories on instagram (photorph85) once I get it.

The situation with the board in NYC is simple. The board had a FOCBOX behaving weirdly (it happens sometimes. One in about 100 I'd say. And when they fail, they fail fast, i.e. in the first few weeks). So we sent a new one and it was replaced. However, with the new FOCBOXes, the board (against our recommendations) was ridden with only a few screws supporting the enclosure. (To be clear, all screws should always be there. If one is loose, take it off, put Permatex blue gel on it and screw it back on. Never ride with anything less than 100% of the screws on at all time. No exceptions). And Max had back luck to boot. While riding the board with the enclosure only hanging with a handful of screws, he rode in a patch of diesel (or other solvent, we can't be sure). So the board was in quarantine for a little while. However, if you follow Max's stories on IG, you can see him riding his DSS50+ so everything worked out in the end ;-)

So this looks great, and 1/2" of risers isn't too crazy.  It seems then that with 125mm gummies you could get away with like 1/4" risers or less?  Does anyone have any data on pulley compatability (it is a 10mm axle at least right?)

Thanks

Thats for 107s.  I think the 1/2" will be good up to 125s with proper bushings.  Haven't tested it though as I don't have any gummies.

I think we are going to put some on one of these if my friends lazy ass will ever order some.  I won't buy from Trampa. A guys gotta have morals.... lol.

Got my La Croix in today and everything is looking solid!  My board came with the Hexagon pattern grip.  There was a good amount in it but wasn't sufficient enough to cover a large area.  Luckily I had previously ordered a whole bunch of those hexagons from Grip Graphique and went nuts with the grip.  Charged it up, gassed up the tires, checked the screws for the shock blocks, enclosure screws all tight.  Ready to take on these NYC streets!  :call_me_hand:

Yeah I love everything about the blade runner aesthetic. My end goal for the board is to have it look like a colourful Japanese toy but without going overboard on the details, keeping the design somewhat minimal. I have a deep appreciation of the obsessive Japanese craftsmanship whether it is woodworking or pottery, or anything creative there are people that dedicate a huge amount of time to details and I thought it wasn’t too far off from what the DSS60 stands for. And yeah the grip... It got dirty beyond cleaning. I still try to clean it after every ride but some of the dirt baked into it. But you’re right it gives it character. It does have 1200KMon it after all

The board comes with a 5th whole wheel actually and bearings so you can simply swap it out if ever you roll on something too sharp. I had one flat so far around 500km, I rolled onto an industrial staple that pierced the tire. Otherwise so far glass didn’t get through and neither did the other tons of sharp debris on our dirty streets. A set of tires lasts at least 600km with heavy riding. And they sell a setof tires and tubes for 35$. I suggest you take out the board for a few KM before getting extra tires, if you’re not carving too hard you can get more than 600km.

I have.  I ended up going with the Osprey Kamber 42.  OBEDs big bag isn't big enough for what I need.  And the Kamber 42 is just the big brother of the one Arch sells on the site.  Figure it will be a good fit.  Though I think at some point I'll order an OBED for more of the everyday commute to work stuff.  He bags just aren't big enough for my mega workout days that I do 2 or 3 times a week.  Weights/swim/volleyball


And I ordered my board this morning, so excited dss50+

unfortunately, with the standard motor mounts you cannot drag it by the front trucks. I spoke with @Arch and he said when they designed the motor mounts they thought about the possibility of the board flipping upside down during a crash and wanted to protect the motors. This brings them too low to drag it by the front trucks. I drag it by holding the motor can. It can be carried like a snowboard on your side but at 25lbs you need the arms that go with it. I'm not a fan of attaching it to my backpack so I try to be on it most of the time even if it means taking a detour

Where all are people mounting a battery meter/gauge? I finally have everything laid out in front of me and I can’t decide where I should mount it.....mount it to the enclosure where’s it’s not visible while riding? Mount it on top of the deck? But I’d hate to drill a hole into this beauty (that’s what she said). 
Id love to see some options or hear some ideas.

Yeah, get a Bluetooth module. I really like the metr app/module, but it’s a little more expensive...$40 I think. Anyway, saves the trouble of mounting a battery meter and you get speed, mileage, wh usage, etc. I ignored the Bluetooth modules for several months, but once I tried it, I’ve added it to nearly all my boards.

Shortest run I got on a full battery to date. Also one of my overall fastest rides. I had to stop in the beginning quite a bit because I was still downtown and had to check directions but the second half of the trip was a joyride on a rocket. My friends had to come pick me up as the board shut down just 2 km before my destination. @Arch I want a bigger battery!!

I got a “under voltage fault” as my board shut down and the efficiency meter cleared up. But it saved in the runs summary. 8.7 for one motor. 

![image|281x500](upload://sXkBotEw1PDuQXgxrKrwn3K8MNX.jpeg)

EDIT: worth mentioning, I had changed belts before this run, the old ones became pretty loose, and the new ones feel a lot tighter, so I imagine more friction. Add to that a heavy backpack, slopes, high wind gusts and just massive sprints, I think I cruised at 45-48/h for a good km or two.

I used to run 50 ish. Now I go much lower, it wasn't very comfortable and I hadn't noticed a significant range improvement, a lot of the momentum was wasted by the vibrations. I now run 40 but i haven't checked the tires in a few hundred kms, they could be a tad below 40. It's definitely more comfortable than running 50 psi and the tires stay more round and vibrate less

I regret not having the Sanyo. I bought my board in the first week the company was launched, I didn't even get that option, granted I probably wouldn't have went for it at that time since this is my first eboard. The advertised capacity with the 30q's seemed already overkill at first. I did already get a 42km ride on my current setup but after 1200+ kms I'm getting quite a bit more comfortable with the board and I feel that I control it more than it controls me so I go a bit faster and carve a little harder and I got used to break full force when I need to, my wheels lock up when I break. So there's a lot more stress on the battery. But also depends on where you live. I live on the suburbs of Montreal, so just crossing in the city is 11km, back and forth is 22, which leaves me about 10km of available range to spend in the city. If your commute is shorter you won't use the full battery. 

@Arch even with 1300km, if we calculate an average of 35km per full cycle, that leaves me at only 37ish full charge cycles. But that is the worst case scenario, because not all my rides used a full cycle. Aren't the 30q's rated for 200 cycles before battery reaches 70% capacity ?

Yes battery life can be substantially increased if you use a shorter discharge-recharge range. The charger only takes it to 41.7 ish and board shuts off at 29V (soft cutoff at 32V). So it’s already protected against any major damage and it’s a shame to limit your trips on a 60cell battery pack just to try to prolong its battery life (opinion).

I received my Lacroix board yesterday in Los Angeles .
Once you try the Lacroix , you will not be able to go back to anything else .
I was actually lifting my head up looking in front of me instead of looking at the road for cracks .
I have been riding Eskate since 2014 and I never experienced this feeling until now .
It's like diving a BMW M4 , everything else feels like Toyota and Honda Now .
The parts used are actually super light so the board is much lighter than Trampa .

That's what I'm planning on doing.  Still got 3ish weeks to go until mines ready.  I did buy the red/white/blue flashies though and the ones recommended with the 3d printed one.  But according to Banggood, I won't get those lights until late August even though they already shipped....  They come from China.  So if you are considering them, buy right away.  They are cheap enough.

Still not 100% sure of what to do for a "to see" light though.  I got a TSG Pass and isn't the friendliest of helmets to attach lights too unless I 3m a go-pro type mount on it.

edit: flashies, are the Thorfire LEDs:

Did they tell you that it's 3 weeks or are you just using the "3-4 week" estimate from when you ordered youred? 
 
Also why does everyone get the TSG pass?  it's for DH lonboarding where you are going fast non stop at speeds of 30+ continuously.  I think there are other full face helmets better suited for esk8.

Just guessing.  He said they are doing 3-4 weeks on building now.  Crossing my fingers.  

TSG Pass is just a very well rated helmet and certified helmet.  And if it's a little overkill, I'm okay with that.  And besides, it looks badass.

And my birthday is on the 21st, so I'm hopeful that i'll have my birthday present to ride :slight_smile:

TSG pass does look cool.  But I looked at the following things in a full face helmet.

-Certifications
-ventilation
-comfort
-MIPS

The helmet best suited for esk8 are helmets like the bell super DH or the fox pro frame, or at least that's the conclusion I came to after spending a lot of time researching and trying out helmets.  They have much better ventilation than TSG pass, they are lighter, they are more protective and have more certifications, and they have MIPS.  Another huge benefit over the TSG pass is that the strap is magnetic, the D rings on the TSG pass are a pain to take on/off.  

I went from predator DH6 full face (similar to TSG pass), S1 helmet, and now for my lacroix I'll be getting a downhill MTB helmet like the one I mentioned above.  

This guy also has a bell mtb helmet.  They may not look as cools as a TSG pass or a ruroc, but you'll wear them actually and they are more functional.

Not sure I'm a fan of the mtb form factor for esk8.  Haven't tried bell or fox racing, but I think your posture in esk8 is closer to snowboarding than dh mtb, where your chin is typically going to be in a different position relative to your body.  Also, fwiw, it looks like the rurocs are significantly lighter than both of those (and TSG, for that matter).  I'm curious why you consider those others to be more functional though... but we might be derailing the thread...

I love my Super DH.  Will be my primary helmet for riding my LaCroix.  Light mounted on the GoPro mount is super easy to remove for charging. Coverts easily to open face for hot days.  Plenty of ventilation.  Dual EPS/EPP layered for low/high speed impacts, along with Bell's custom "mk2" MIPS system (cerified for DH which is a pretty intense certification).  Also happens to be comfortable and has a sweet magnetic buckle.  It's a badass helmet.

Also just got my board.  Thing is a beast.  Super easy to control.  However the rear end feels a bit loose for my taste.  I tried tightening up the blocks, but still carves a little too hard at speed for me.  Should I consider swapping out for the red's?  I like having to really throw my weight into the carve and generally run the front of my boards loose and the rears stiff.  Stock for me just feels a bit squirrelly during turning at speed.  

Otherwise everything is perfect.  So much fun being able to fly over roads I know I'd be crawling on with my crappy hub-motor board.  Really does feel like a cloud.  Can't wait to get the trucks dialed in for me.

Okay after a few more rides and some tweaking I can safely say that this is probably the best purchase I've ever made.  Pretty much everything I've ever wanted for street riding.  Comfortable, controllable, stupid fast, and just overall awesome.  I know its been said many times already in this thread, but if you are on the fence about getting one of these, just do it.  

This thing does the slow cruise just as well as it does a decent impression of a ballistic missile.  Kind of reminds me of a hypercar like the Chiron in that way.  It's a nice feeling knowing that while you are just putting along you have WAY too much power on tap if you want it.  

As for the trucks I've just been experimenting with different tightnesses and have slowly been figuring out what I like.  As I mentioned earlier I prefer a stiffer setup so during high speeds I can still shift my weight around.  I don't like feeling like I have to be super careful like you do when you run them loose.  I know it sacrifices slow speed maneuverability but thats just preference.

I will say the only problem I have so far is in regarding to slow speed braking.  The board brakes flawlessly but once it gets to around 3-5mph the board just locks it up and jolts you.  Nothing more embarrassing than flying up to a light with full gear on with a badass board like this and then almost eating it at walking speed.  Is there something wrong with my FOCBOX setup or is this just normal behavior?  I just started braking early and then rolling to a stop instead.  This is really my only true complaint with the board. 

Also how do I go about connecting to the board via bluetooth.  Do I need to open it up in order to pair it to my phone?

Anyways great job guys and keep up the good work.  You've made a hell of a first product.

The jolt at the end seems to be a software issue running FOC on large wheels... There's a thread on this and no one could resolve it.

Current work around is to just get off the board at the very last second before the jolt kicks in.

Glad you're enjoying the board ;-) for the Bluetooth, no need to open up the board (ever, in fact), simply download any app and go through the pairing process in the app. That's all that needs to be done.

As for wheels locking up at 1mph, as @ervinelin stated, it's a focbox quirk and nothing can be done about it. You'll learn to work around it. I do either 2 things ; slam on the brakes and shift my body weight backwards when I'm almost at a full stop to compensate the lock OR let off the throttle a second early and coast to a stop.

The 1-2mph full brake bugged me at first, enough that I was planning on switching the FocBoxes to bldc mode...which would eliminate the issue. But, after a couple weeks I’m used to the brakes (no more embarrassing moments) and FOC mode is sooo freaking smooth, I’ve decided to leave everything as is.

I tried red in the back and front and I really liked being able to throw my weight when carving at speed, but when slowing down it really manoeuvres like an aircraft carrier. I must say though, at speed, the reds are really fun to carve with. I totally got used to the oranges though and it makes for a much more versatile ride.

Yeah it's definitely a tradeoff and I think I'm already decided on sticking with the orange's and adapting.  Once you tighten them up you can find a nice balance.

It's a shame about the braking but I guess I'll get used to it.  Is there any chance of this being fixed in the future?

Also does anyone have a list of setting's to input into the app?  Like motor poles and battery stats (for the DSS50+).

Edit:
Any idea why the app would tell me I have 40% battery left and then drop to 5% within 3 miles?  Just had to push the board a few miles because I thought I had way more range than necessary just to have it die midway.  I rode around 15 miles to drop it to the 40% so I felt safe riding the 6-7 that I needed but pretty much died after 3.  Is it normal for the app to read it inconsistently?  I was riding pretty hard but had it in eco the entire time so I figured I'd be able to get at least 25+.  Could it be related to the BMS?  Just seems like the board had plenty of juice and then just died.  The app was saying I was using 11wh/mi.

I'm going to pay more attention on my next ride and try to get some better data, but definitely was a bit disconcerting to get such low range out of "40%".

I’d say it’s mostly the riding style. If I base myself on stats he sent me of his ride today, 11.4 miles had him at 39.1V (83%).

If you ride aggressively, you will have less range than if you cruise around, the same goes for any board.

Ok.  I'm curious about what other people are getting on a single charge.  I recalculated the distance I rode yesterday and it seemed like I got around 23 miles before starting to hit the cutoffs.  I wasn't able to go out tonight and finish the rest of the test today, but I'm going to continue riding the same charge tomorrow and report the milage.  

Also my friend had access to a laser cutter and asked if I wanted anything so I ended up with this little piece.  Might try to integrate it into a charging station. :grin:

Seems like your data is inconsistent. You did 11.4 miles using 2.3 volts and then did another 11.6 miles using more than the 7+ remaining volts? Something doesn’t add up. What is your current voltage at?

Maybe try a distance tracking app like Strava or something like that?

Wow, thats gorgeous!!! I’m actually pretty jealous, haha!

Are you carving pretty hard? I know that creates a lot of resistance and eats up Wh.
[/quote]

That entirely depends on how you carve, not how hard you carve, IMO.  You can actually gain speed while carving if you know how to pump.  I was expecting to find more videos demonstrating what I mean, but was a bit harder than I had anticipated. Quality isn't great, but this guy does a good job breaking down a few (including a couple I had never seen before).

Hit 30 miles today with the board at 35V at the end of the ride.  Too much fun, but I think my legs are going to be in trouble tomorrow. 

Also almost got run over in a bike lane going straight through an intersection with a terrible driver overtaking and turning right in front of me.  Be careful out there.  It's hard to comprehend just how bad drivers are these days, I swear I'll make eye contact with people and still have them pull out in front of me.

It's only a matter of time before somebody designs a set of trucks/hangers specifically for our application. My money is on @Nowind. And i'll go as far as to say that I think it will happen within the next 8-12 months.
For me, the ultimate would be a LaCroix deck and battery enclosure  with a  customised drive train designed by Jens.
For me, it has to be suitable for off-road, so the belt drive is not an option.

PSA: for those receiving their DSS50+ and DSS60 since the past week - you will notice we did not include an extra wheel with pulley, nor extra belts, nor extra pulleys. It's not that we don't love you or that we are starting to cheap out. We are simply low on parts so we prefer to stretch out all the parts we have so we could ship more boards and you can ride. When we receive a couple of YUUUUUUUGE shipments before the end of August, we'll send you all a little package by the mail that will include all these little bits. On us, of course.

So I heard a crazy rumor that you guys are doing another group buy on just decks+enclosures!  So psyched! 

It would be a great move, as you could move those quick with not as much work as building a complete?

PS.  I just made this up entirely, but that would be so awesome, because I am kicking myself for not going 12s and would love to build a couple more things off this platform!

Here are my range stats on my first 3 rides on the 10s6p 30q Lacroix:

Weight: 225lbs + clothing, gear and backpack 

All rides started with the battery full.

First Ride: 13km, 38V (Literally went up a mountain on a gravel road, about 4km uphill)
Second Fide: 17.86km, 37.V (Doing some speed tests up to 50km/h and some riding on grass)
Third Ride: 37.5km, 29.8V (Board stopped completely)

(distance, final voltage)

Pretty much what I expected, just above the range that I need.

The mods from nowind are nice but the price is just way to high. Anyone looked at the new unity controller with duel motor controller ? There’s not much info on how advanced the programming is.
I’ve taken my board out on a 40* hill and it took it like a champ I even stopped half way and it still took up speed like it was flat ground. My wait was around 195 with back pack filled with coke and rum 😃

I’ve got a preorder for the unity, but who knows how long till it arrives. 

I was initially very keen on mating nowind’s direct drive to a LaCriox, but the more I thought about it, the less sense it made. More weight, more complexity, and a lot more cost. For a board that’s designed for the road, it just doesn’t seem worth it. It would look freakin sweet though.

I am not at the house to measure.  Also, I am getting 50 red and 50 gold fender washers (smallest packs on prime) and the stainless m3 socket bolts come in 120 packs, so if anybody wants some to replace their existing hardware, PM me.

Hey guys.   I’m wondering what type of range are you guys getting out of your Lacroix 

I have a dss50+ 
I was able to get 22 miles with some juice left going up and down San Francisco with a fairly amount of hill climbing and hitting speeds of up to 33mph on evolve knobbies 

I’m very happy with boards range and performance ![image|374x500](upload://xDygKyL0lmCYgTI0Ckqj4E4xFG4.jpeg)

I've been commuting to work 17 miles and back another 17 miles in under an hour on my DSS50+ for the past 2 weeks and it's been an experience. I'm 225lbs without gear and there are some steep hills involved along my route. I've never ridden to empty but at the tail end of my ride home (15 mile mark) there definitely is a loss of thrust going up hills. I always wait for the charging light to turn green before I leave as this guarantees I will definitely get to where I've got to go... It's the 4 hour wait for that green light that's a killer!!!  2.5 - 3 hours would be nice but 4 hours :grimacing: and that's not from empty either...

The length of the deck is starting to bother me as I keep finding myself feeling for a wider stance. Another 3-6 inches would be perfect to lock in and prevent getting jolted off the board. Hey @Arch and @pat_arch You guys wouldn't happen to have some longer length Prototipos lying around would ya?? If not would you consider making a longer version deck for people with a wider stance?  Then a 12s5p would be doable with no issues whatsoever...  :wink: 

P.S. Took the DSS50+ to the Kaly proving grounds yesterday and had a blast...

On the charging side.  My board has been plugged to the wall for the last 4.5 hours and still no green light 😂

I hear you about the deck length on Lacroix.  Kaly xl carver happens to have the perfect length 
Lacroix could use at least 2 more inches for a better riding stance but it’s still a super fun and comfortable board to ride 

I have to say.   I’m still pretty damn impressed with the prototipo range    Let’s not forget the fact that AT wheels kill your range by a lot compared to street wheels

Are you charging the board at work before coming back? I have the same weight (225lbs) but the max range I got (riding all the way to the board stopping ~29.8V) was 36 km and I only ride on the slower remote mode. Granted I have the 30Q version but still it's 18 km difference, I'd expect a difference (real world difference) of 6 to 10 kms.

The deck length was one of my first observations as well, being 188cm the deck is just a bit short for me to get a stance wide enough that would feel 100% comfortable to handle all the power that the board has, but it's something that I compensate for by lowering my stance more then usual so not a deal breaker but i'm always trying to move my feet further apart. Overall in terms of body pain it's still the most comfortable ride I have even riding 36 kms.

Here is a picture of my 36km range test, the battery died right after I crossed a very long bridge (the one parallel to Champlain Bridge) and there were no roads for cars on the other side, so I had to carry the board back. I made a leash and halfway through I realized I can just push the board manually :laughing:

I’ve had the same thought about deck length and wish for a wider stance (I’m 186cm). When cruising or moderate speed carving, the stance is fine, but about 25mph+ I’m wishing for a wider stance. 

The trade off of course is a larger turning radius and perhaps sacrificing some carving abilities...for my riding style it’s not worth it.

Please don't make it longer! It would turn this nimble Porsche into a long wheel base Bentley for snobs. Pun aside, I understand taller people may feel a little different, I'm 178cm tall, and I would hate to sacrifice turning radius on it. Maybe since you all just got the board, you didn't have time to adjust to it? 

And regarding range I get about 36km as well on the 30Qs and I'm 175lbs. the 20700's are something else.

70% of my ride involved speeds of 25+ mph

Yes Sir Indeedy... I have a Raptor2 exclusive build and it uses the same charger as LaCroix/Evolve so one charger stays at work and the other at home... I always charge up at work before I head back home - I let the board sit for an hour or so before I start the recharge for the journey home. 

 I was asking Pat and Alex for the @Maxaweli 20700B build from the moment I knew it was done. I knew from my Raptor2 experience that you had better get the most Wh possible to deal with the occasional hill popping up and taking the thrill out of your ride. The Raptor 2 can barely make the 17 mile trip home in R-Spec mode... But the Raptor2 is way more subway friendly than the Lacroix... 

I have to check my tire pressures on the Lacroix and maybe use some white lithium grease on the axles and bearings. I've noticed on Summer Fridays as I'm only at work for 3.5 hours (I don't have a full 4 hours + to let the Lacroix fully charge). I let the Lacroix sit for 1/2 hour to cool down so at most I get 3 hours of charging but no green light on the charger before I leave for home... 

Yesterday it felt as if the board went to it's lowest setting around the 15 mile point... It's a slow drag incline for a good 1/2 mile and I punched the throttle but no hyperspace! The sublight engines got me up the hill though... Once it flattened out then the speed started building again.  

On my boosted V2 I can get home (same exact route) using 2 XR(extended range) batteries with 20% left on the last XR battery... but that's on Thane... 1 XR can get me 9 miles on pretty much the flattest part of Manhattan. 1 boosted XR battery is rated at 267Wh so 534Wh in total compared to 432Wh for the Raptor2 vs 666Wh for the DSS60 vs 786 for the DSS50+...  

 I'm glad I waited for the DSS50+ now I just need a longer deck with room for a bonafide 12s5p or 12s6p inside... Oh and a faster Charger!!:wink:
@pat_arch @Arch  

Ride Safe!:pray:t6:

Vibration padding everywhere, wires in orderly lines, double sided tape and/or hot glue on everything, FocBoxes sitting on aluminum for heat reduction.

I got to ride one of these boards around a parking lot today... My God, it's a thing of pure beauty!

I have a thought... To me the board length felt pretty good, but what did get me was the lack of concave. Feeling around with my feet, is it just me or does the center of the deck have slightly more concave than the foot placement spots? I can tell it does have concave for sure, just probably not what I am used to... And maybe this is good for the type of ride this board is made for, but I feel like even if the foot placement spots had a tad bit more concave like the center of the deck it would handle a bit better. Maybe it does handle great and it's just more of a surfy feel I'd have to get used to... 

@Arch, what are your thoughts? Have you guys experimented with adding a bit more concave? I'm sure it would mess with the whole design, enclosure fitting, flex, etc.

Anyways, besides that I thought it was amazing... Low, smooth, powerful... Just all around lovely... My board feels so boring in comparison.

Never really been a fan of W myself... most W I've experienced is that hyper aggressive W though. But, subtle W I could *totally* be into especially on such a wide deck like this.

Problem with  W shape is it remove lots of flex, which made it ideal for stiffen and lighten downhill deck.

I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks this way.

My other two decks are a Loaded Tesseract and a Jet Spud, both if which I have never ever had to look down to know where my feet are, something which I miss on the LaCroix.

I'm wondering if there's something I can add to the deck to give me this subtle concave where my toes are...

If you rode it at Wheat Ridge Park the board was still in eco mode I had 88% battery life left after the aw some ride.

Did a group ride in Long Beach yesterday on my LaCroix, just about 21 miles and had 29% (34v) remaining on the battery. I wasn’t riding conservatively at all, but I did carve less than normal. About 200 meters was through some loose dirt, which was kinda fun.

if you need a landmark or a bit of raised edge to find your spot, can try gluing/doubleside-taping shaped foam to the deck. Something like this:

Just got my board. This is by far the best looking board I’ve ever had.  Before I take it on the first ride, still have to grab a bike pump and fill the tires up with air.  Can’t wait to take this out.

What psi are you guys using for your tires?

I still have to figure out how to tighten and loosen trucks, since these are so different from all the other trucks I’ve used before. 

No stranger to high powered boards but if there are tips before first ride, things I should double check... let me know :slightly_smiling_face:

I’ll do a detailed review in another thread after riding this some.

wow nice! You guys are all getting the Sanyo packs! I'm so jealous now. Should have definitely bought the DSS50+. At the time I did the math in my head and decided that trading 60 x 30Q cells + $300 USD for 50 x 20700b cells wasn't a good idea financially. Ultimately having the extra range is worth a lot.

There was more than one leak on the tire too.

Before reassembling the tire on the wheel, put tire liners it work like magic on my bicycle. 
It protects the tube if a sharp object passes through the tire.  
There several brand, all work well. 
Take one that is wide enough to cover the contact surface of the wheel.

Sorry to ask here, but is there a build log with [this types of tires](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/2-colors-1-pc-Mobility-Scooter-wheelchair-tire-200-x-50-8x2-solid-foam-filled-200x50/32865691634.html?spm=a2g0w.10010108.addToCart.23.656baa95A5Vi4N&gps-id=pcDetailCartBuyAlsoBuy&scm=1007.12908.99722.0&scm_id=1007.12908.99722.0&scm-url=1007.12908.99722.0&pvid=5a89e2bc-92ab-4326-87c7-6ffb71acb4b4) ?

As @Grozniy linked, my tires were solid rubber with ultra heavy mega breaking resistance :laughing:

The tire of Aliexpress is a real tire (nylon) filled with foam. On the tire you see "inflate to 36 psi". I don't know how much the foam changes the rolling resistance but it doesn't look bad. Give it a try.

[quote="Blitqz, post:1196, topic:49051"]
got a flat on the 4th day
[/quote]

I had flats all the time and once twice a day. I was carrying 2 spare tubes and tools in my backpack. It was a PIA. Since I use tire sealant (for bicycle tubes) I had no single flat and it's great to ride without spare tubes and fear of the next flat.

A bottle (for 2 bicycle tubes) is enough for 8x tubes. The first time I used 1 bottle for 4 tubes but that's not necessary. No flats but if the tire explodes it looks like that :laughing:

I had a Evolve GTX with the R1 remote. That remote worked the same way, when you pulled the throttle back you would go forward. I have ordered a Psychotiller custom board as well an it uses the standard RC mini remote. The throttle function on that works the same way, pull the lever back and you go forward, push the lever forward and you apply the brakes. Since I will be using both boards, they both will function the same way and I won't have to remember that I am using a different remote.

For safety reasons, it's better to pull forward to go forward. The reason being is "whisky throttle". When one falls or panicks, the natural reaction is to close the hands, in this case it could be to pull back on the lever. So if the throttle is reversed, board could fly forward :man_shrugging:

On smooth pavement the gummies are super good, real grippy, super reactive, they give a real kick when accelerating and they drag a lot less when coasting. I kinda prefer carving on pneu though, they carve a bit more abruptly, maybe I should try tightening my shockbocks a bit more.

On bad pavement they really stressed my build though, a lot of rattling, I had to retighten everything on arrival.
They feel a lot less grippy as soon as there’s a bit of small gravel or sand on the road, or on irregular pavement… no carving there.

I have to say though it still felt very rideable thanks to shock absorbing risers and mostly to the Lacroix deck and its flex.

Range wise I did get the same range I usually have with 6.5" at 85 PSI, though i had to battle against a strong headwind most of the way, and I did not slow down or tuck it out, just kept my snowboard stance.

I was afraid to scar my enclosure with only 1/2" risers; it's a little lower than normal but it worked, I did not hit anything, even when carving hard.

The SixShooter come in either 8mm or 10mm axle sizes. I'm more worried about the pulleys. The tire size would only lower it 1/2".

The 7" evolve wheels work... You just need to put a speed ring(spacer/washer) 12mm on the rear axel before you install the wheels... I rode the Lacroix over the Williamsburg Bridge with all those huge gaps and No Problemo... I was riding with 40 psi... if the clearance is still an issue then grab the 2mm allen key and move the motor pulleys closer to the motors (I had to do this for 1 of the wheels)... You should be good to go...:+1:t6::wink:

Hey @Arch I'm not a DIY guy but I've been trying to figure why on the website you say "Hollow Axle Trucks" which mean Matrix II Pros but my build doesn't have Hollow Axle Trucks... Instead my build has Regular Matrix II's

I've asked a few of the other Lacroix guys in NYC and they have Hollow Axle Trucks i.e. Matrix II Pros... Please when you come to NYC this coming Saturday to ride with Enertion, bring my Matrix II Pro trucks with you - dunno why you sent a build out with different spec trucks...

**Lightweight construction**  - the carbon fiber enclosure, the springless **_hollow axle trucks_**, every single screw and insert, the list is long... Every measure was taken to reduce weight. 

@ervinelin  Maybe this is the discrepancy that's causing the issue with your light mounts... either way I paid for Matrix II Pros that's what should come with the board... :face_with_raised_eyebrow::thinking:

Thanks for pointing that out. It had slipped me and we just corrected the website. On our first handful of boards, we shipped with the Pro and then MBS went out of stock on the Pros (and has been since June) so if we had waited for those, we would not have shipped any boards this summer. So we shipped our boards with the standard Matrix2 (which are 0.07lbs heavier - 31 grams to be exact - they drill a hole in the center of the axle to lighten the PRO. It's the only difference between the 2). As we don't have any, we won't be able to swap those - this said, please email me at alex@lacroixboards.com so we can discuss how to move forward and make you happy. Also, I invite any other LaCroix owner who feels the same way to do the same. Thanks and sorry again about this, it was my oversight.

They are identical on paper. In reality, they all slightly differ. When they insert the axles on the heated lower hanger, it sometimes creates a small deflection in the lower hanger, creating a very small bulbous area (imperceptible to the eye, but when you try to insert a mount, you’ll see the difference as sometimes it slides on, and sometimes it doesn’t). I’ve had numerous back and forth with @MBS on this and now that Joel is on the forum, he’ll be able to do explain it better than I ;) @Yann can also testify to this as someone who’s handled a lot of Matrix2.

Indeed. The profile of the hanger is identical for all the Matrix II trucks, but as Lacroix brought to our attention (they install motor mounts on a lot of our trucks), there are slight variations in the profile that are noticeable when trying to fit a tight fitting motor mount on.  It's due to our CrMo axle insertion process.  The axle ends are serrated before being press fit into the hanger.  This interference fit apparently can apparently cause the hanger profile to flare out a bit in that area.  It won't stop you from getting the motor mount on, but some might slide on easier than others.  Hope that helps.  Let us know how you go.

Cool to know.. but @BOOSTEDO couldn't even fit a 2 piece mount on (mount split in two and just clamps together). I can understand the slide on one might be tricky but surely the clamp on one can't be that far off that it won't fit.

Something is definitely not right about that.  I noticed on some Lacroix boards our hangers are flipped around (logo facing in rather than out).  @Arch is that they way you do them all?  If so, then I'm wondering it's an issue of trying to fit a mount made for a flipped hanger onto a non-flipped hanger?  @BOOSTEDO, try flipping your hanger around to see if that's the case.
```

## \#1266 Posted by: MBS Posted at: 2018-09-19T12:37:19.996Z Reads: 223

```
PS.  All our hangers are flippable.  It doesn't affect riding performance.  We just do a lot of grinds on mountainboards these days and the way the hanger is normally mounted gives an increased aluminum thickness in the area that gets the most wear from grinds.  I haven't seen too many electrics hitting rails so probably not a worry for you guys (never know in the future though).  Just FYI regarding one of the reasons that Matrix II profile shape is so weird.

You know what... I was looking at that but got sidetracked with the hollow axel thingy... I thought there _must_ be a difference between the Pro and the non pro Matrix II's beside the axel... I'll wait until this weekend (after I ride Saturday with Lacroix + Enertion)... I just wanna ride to be honest... after finally getting those evolve tires on I'm done... I didn't ride my Lacroix for 2 weeks 'cause I was taking apart hubs and messing with tires, pulleys, etc... 

I was waiting for the pulleys but those didn't come at the beginning of this month...
No biggie but it's DIY I guess... @Arch Just let peeps know you are switching up something and no problemo... Now about those missing gummy bears...:wink::laughing::laughing:

P.S. I do have this recurring issue with the brakes. Sometimes the Lacroix will break harshly when you start to apply the brakes. It's almost enough to throw you off the board... I usually stop and turn off the board and remote and re-pair the remote. This seems to do the trick but it happens out of nowhere and is unnerving... I actually thought I had lost my feel for the brakes but it was just this glitch almost bucking me off the board that had me bugging... I don't know if anyone else has had this issue but it's like the clunk at the end of the braking sequence that's related to Focbox. Instead you get that harshness or (clunk) at the very beginning...

This makes sense as I couldn't get the one piece light mounts to begin to slide on... I was perplexed and decided to put my Evolva Lights back on the front trucks... The two piece didn't want to fit either but hey what DIK this is DIY...

Hey @MBS can you make the axel a half inch longer?(1/4 inch per side) Reason why is there really isn't much thread to secure the nut properly IMO on these trucks... The nut is literally hanging on by a few threads (especially the rear trucks)... I could never figure why there is barely enough room given for this. It may be fine for regular mountain boarding but for esk8 there really isn't much room. or maybe a nut that's not as thick would do the trick?

Sorry If I'm bringing up something that's already been discussed...

Peace...

Hi,
I put dozen and dozen of motor mount on Mx2 trucks and yes i can testify noticeable difference between version 1 and version 2 (2018 batch with red shockblock)
I m my own mount manufacturer (www.overion.fr) and prototyped different mounts for others trucks and for different electric skateboard shops as Lacroix🤗
Difference between the 2 versions of Mx2 are:
-Section bigger (few 1/10 mm ) explained here due to axle insertion ...but why wasnt it same for version1?
-hanger longer on version 2
- hanger not centred in the middle of the top truck😱 —> no hypothesis about..
- little assymetric M8 hole position (hole it s not at same place on left and right hanger side—> no hypothesis about..

Conclusions: Mbs reseller would be happy to know exact modification before getting surprise of newbatch🤷‍♂️
I m manufacturing assymetric mounts (one for left one for right hanger side) so I m following modification but it s boring ...you can understand i hope so.
My perception was simply a decreasing quality of manufacturing process🤗
However MBS parts are really really good and stay the best on the market( as Mx2 riding feeling, rockstar hub etc etc ) I invite MBS to work to be better with stocks gestion , distribution and reseller communication😉
Examples:
Sold out parts as Dylan warren boards at this time , no trucks during 6 months (automn 2017 to spring2018) , no hub for months (spring to summer 2018) , no t3 tyres during 2 months (summer 2018) It should be some good indications to go to a new business strategy dont you think?
Boards « Sold out definitively « show clearly a new batch of products to replace , as exemple, dw boards , but as reseller i am i will be happy to be online with🤗🤷‍♂️
Cheers
Yann

Send me a pic if you don't mind.  If it's our hubs and hardware on the truck then maybe something is wrong...  should be just beyond flush.  In the past I've minimized exposed axle threads to avoid damage over time, but if they're actually shy of the nyloc that's not right.  And if an overall improvement is possible I'm open to it.

Thanks for the feedback @Yann . Love your work and appreciate your support for MBS.

Thankfully a lot of your input already made it to us via Alex at Lacroix and we're revising several processes as a result.  You can expect a dramatic increase in consistency soon. 

Request for improved communication noted.  Definitely can do better!

Stock supply issues will be sorted soon. The growth in demand for components from the esk8 community caught us off guard, but we're on it now.  All supply issues should be sorted by the end of this year.  2019 will be STRONG.

Its right the shaft is too short. 

There is supposed to have a minimum of 2 threads out of the nyloc to be safely locked. I always check the nuts before each ride and some time  a quick visual during a longer ride while I wait at a stop light. 

For now, it lock OK but after removing the nut a few times, I will feel safer to put a new nut and loctite. 

In the future, the worst case scenario:  when a new nyloc nut will not work any more, I will have to work on and go with a castle nut and cotter pin![IMG_20180828_042316|690x408](upload://viMhXI84qfWIre4RuSuCkT6mOho.jpeg)

It's very important to calibrate the remote each time you turn it on. Sounds like you're not doing that - it's how the board behaves when the remote is not calibrated. Calibration means; turn on remote, full throttle, full brake, turn on board, remote pairs, you're good to go.

The full throttle and full brake part is very important.

Hi MBS I would like to also mention that on the MBS Matrix 2 that for some reason the left side of the truck dependent on which you look at it the bearing do not fit flush correctly.
There is a wobbly feeling which wears down the bearing a lot faster on that side.
After riding over 50+ miles I have taken off the wheels and the bearing feels loose like they are breaking apart. It’s on both of my trucks. When I replace it with new bearings they do not sit flushed to the trucks, they feel wobbly like the diameters of the trucks are not even. It feels like the further past the wheel bearing moves outwords the more play it has. Is that by design ?

I am in Colorado Denver close to MBS I can bring it by to show you if needed.

I do... I use the same calibration process as with my Raptor 2 and whenever I ride a Kaly... It just seems to do this randomly... Like I said you just don't know when it's going to happen... Maybe it's just my board... It's happen enough times that I've identified it & know what to do to make it go away but it keeps coming back...

Interesting about the axle nuts. I received my LaCrox three weeks ago and had a look at the nuts tonight. It appears that all four are short almost one thread from being flush with the nuts. No wheels have been removed yet. Is this something I should be concerned about? I have maybe 25 miles on the board so far.

So if anyone has seen my build post on the LaCroix, my only real issue is the lack of concave especially where my toes are... I decided to try to do something about that!

![IMG20180923233320|281x500](upload://jgd6zrWUeaAqc5Ao6hw6fdeifP3.jpeg) 

![IMG20180923234140|281x500](upload://7ybRw0IT3mDclv5xM9wXD2AqzUx.jpeg) 

I modelled and printed a 25mm lip right at the corner where my toes are, removed the tape, heat molded it to conform to the curvature, hot glued it down (temporary piece), then glued back the grip tape.

So far it feels much nicer, will bring it for a longer test ride but I think it's an immediate improvement. 

Not sure if I need one for the back, maybe not...

The final piece will be printed in TPU then siliconed to the deck with a fresh slab of vicious tape...

![IMG_20180923_171214_HHT|281x500](upload://7joIuha39TxpHBELTULe9mD9ofa.jpeg)  

@BOOSTEDO Jay, my board came with hangers flipped, logo in, I think that's because of motor mounts and respective grub screw. That's why @ervinelin lights mounts didn't fit. I flipped the front hanger and the slide on adapters fit perfectly. But back hanger is impossible to flip due to motor mount. So I just used rubber that came in the   light kit.

one 12mm spacer on the axel before you put the wheel on... if needed you should move the motor pulley inward (towards the motor) using 2mm allen key for additional clearance. If all esle fails then put on the 16T pulleys like @JohnnyMeduse suggested. - I'm running 20T pulleys with 7" evolve street tires...

OK I'm pretty close to pulling the trigger on one of these and spent the last few days reading/watching way too much about them. I had one of the OG Kickstarter Boosted boards and currently have a Onewheel+ that I'm in the process of selling. There's a lot to love about the OW but at the end of the day you are completely reliant on a computer and when it has a hiccup you're very likely to bleed. 

With that in mind I have a couple questions about the LaCroix that hopefully current owners can answer: 

How well does it freewheel? 
What's the board's default behavior when the remote disconnects accidentally?

Thanks in advance, this is an amazing resource!

Yes Sir indeedy... I was riding like a fool... the inserts definitely help keep your feet planted... and carving is easier than before... I had on some longish sneakers which felt weird but next time I'll put on my other sneaks which should fit right in the pocket. 

On the flipside I kept having to stop and re-calibrate my remote... Hey @Arch this remote is acting up and it's not me... sometimes when I turn the remote on it doesn't flash (blink) green - it's as if it was still off... so i would have to turn it off then on again... I had to re-calibrate my remote like 7 or 8 times after having just done so... It got so bad that others would be blocks away (and I of course could catch up easily...) Methinks I remember seeing @JohnnyMeduse using a nano-x remote with his LaCroix so next ride I'm gonna try and use the one that came with my Raptor2... I've never had this calibration issue with my Raptor2 so it's not me... I even put the remote near the end of the deck when syncing like you showed me @Arch. 

I'm just glad that I have those concave inserts now which dampen the lurching effect of the brakes when I apply them. Once I feel that lurch I know the remote needs to be re-calibrated... I hope it's just a faulty remote... I hate not having confidence while riding my LaCroix...:unamused:

It feels solid when switching on and off (x-axis) but there's a lot of play in the (y-axis) and it will actually shut off(no green light) if you wiggle it in the y-axis. So that's probably the issue...:thinking: @Arch

Hi @BOOSTEDO I didn’t have the issue you had with the remote, but after a few drops, the remote sound like a “ **maracas** ”. (my fault)

I open it and hot glued the components. I took care not covering the welding of the battery, in case I have to change it. 
I also re build, with hot glue, the 3 screws steam. 

It feels stronger now.

Nah both of you are wrong... with the added Black grip tape the colors are Red, Black and Green... These three colors make up the Bandera. The Bandera is the Flag of Africa - the Hon.

I just borrowed a friends Nano-X remote - (My Raptor 2 is currently out for repair @onloop) :unamused:   What a big difference :smiley:... I never had any remote issues with my Raptor2 and wow I was zooming along with my LaKwa once I paired it to the nano-x remote. I didn't have any anxiety over the brakes so it was the first time I rode like I usually do... Due to some construction work being done I couldn't take my normal route to work so I diverted onto the streets and as luck would have it - **FRESHLY PAVED!!!!** I was going so fast it wasn't funny... The Nano-x seems to have a longer throw for the acceleration and braking...but I'll take that over guessing if you're gonna get catapulted at the slightest touch of the brakes. I guess I got a bum remote with my LaKwa... 

 Hey @Arch Please send me another remote!!! - I like the Nano-x cause it works but I prefer the ergonomics of the LaKwa remote. I have a Hoyt St. puck on order so hopefully that will be even better... My Lakwa got _tremendous_ volt sag after about 15 miles of zooming along... I'm 225lbs and the weather was about 60F today sooooooooooooooo I barely made it to work (17mile trip) and that's with the DSS50+ (20700B) :roll_eyes:

Hey @Arch is there a 12s version in the works?:thinking:

Bit late to the show but I agree about a longer/wider deck.
6'5 (195cm) and 220 (100kg)
Longer wider board would allow more batteries  (hint hint) and safer for heal and toe binding issues, which I am afraid the most after having shoe/wheel bite at full speed (normal longboard few years go) and ended up breaking my elbow for the third time. :grin:

I have been a long time lurker on this forum, purchased a LaCroix board about 2 weeks ago. This community is definitely the place to be. Helpful people encouraging one another, and bonding over common goals and shared interests. 

That being said your initial post did read almost like a warning to all LaCroix board owners. It had me do a quick double take,  I think those of us that have seen how beautiful the guts to the LaCroix are could tell immediately that it was a DIY.

I think the build and the repair work you have done is amazing though, and I for one would love to hear more about it.

Yeah - easily done. Either make sure the team at LaCroix actually build the battery pack for you, or, get someone who knows how to build a battery pack to do the job. Such a shame that the 'original' battery pack was of a questionable nature and put into a board with an impeccable history of quality control and customer service. 

I liken this (your post) to purchasing a performance car with a clapped out 'dodgy' engine. Those two do not belong together.
I'm glad you now have the battery sorted and can enjoy the board for what it is.

I am on your side man, but I think this is just a big miscommunication.

You do great work.  Sometimes it is hard to tell tone in a text or on a forum.  I think Johnny was just pointing out that it wasn't a Lacroix complete.  Thats all.  And it might have come across defensive in text form, but I am pretty sure he didn't intend it to be.

You did a great job fixing up that pack, no doubt!

But many people end up on here that probably don't even realize that there is a difference between a Lacroix complete and a DIY kit.

Compared to their internals mine look amateur! 

To you, me, and many others on the forum it was of course super obvious that it was a DIY kit that you fixed up (and fixed up well!), but to many they don't even know what the hell a liion is.  They have no clue what a Focbox is, they don't understand all this.  

Just don't want to confuse the new guys who just... uh...

"Want board. Want good board. Want fast board."

Es8 riders are people too (just not nearly as cool as es8 builders)...  And we must nurture their limited understanding of this so they can potentially blossum into a flower of an Es8 builder.

At the time it was not sure of what to expect and even though I now know it was a good value for the price it was during the offer, that was still a lot of money for a deck. I did not see, like you did, how good of a product it is and after seeing yours and others reviews, I wish I did.

Sorry if I missed it somewhere else, but I was wondering if anyone has paired the Hoyt St puck remote with a stock LaCroix. 

I'm a total n00b when it comes to esk8, pushed wood for a good 16 years of my life though. 

My concern is in something that I read from another forum user:
 "Pair the remote to the receiver. Plug in your master VESC to the computer and reprogram the input’s Min/Max points with a BLDC tool that supports the firmware that La Croix is using."

My assumption was I would replace the receiver and pair the remote. How much more involved is it than that and would anyone be willing to give me some instructions?

Looking at you @Sender be the miracle grow for my esk8 roots and help me blossom!

You're correct. You would need to change the receiver and configure the focboxes again

So it isn't hard, but you do have to do some stuff.

First you need to change the reciever that is hooked up to your master VESC and replace it with the one from hoyt.

After that, you need to pair the remote to the board and reciever.  Which is real easy, you just hold three buttons on the hoyt renote down, then power on the board (different remotes hasve different binding processes, the hoyt binds super easily).

Boom, then you are paired.

But here is the slightly nore technical part.  It isn't that bad, so don't worry!  You need to have the VESC tool downloaded on your computer.

You hook up to the master VESC and then you go into the app settings and configure the "min" and "max" ppm settings for the remote.  This isn't a hard task, but it is important.  You see, all remotes are a little different, even the same brand remote from one particular remote to another really should be reconfigured.

I won't delve too deeply as there are many guides and instructions all over the forum and some on you tube.  Just do a search here on the forum. 

This sounds like a lot, but really is nothing.  This is a good thing to learn and doing it will give you a much deeper understanding about how your board works.

And,  the Hoyt Puck is dope!

For reference, it probably took me longer to type this than it would take to reconfigure a remote.

If you have 2 unity, i’d Say the max cells you’d fit is 50 x 20700. 40 very comfortably.

Ok cool, was wondering if it was split PPM or Can bus.  

Someone with a Complete bought a Hoyt Puck and messaged me about having some issues getting it configured.

I have a feeling he didn't hit "write" after he did PPM limits, but he mentioned something about plugging into the other VESC.

Made me wonder if it was set up with CAN or split PPM.

I figured you used CAN, just didn't know for sure.  

(Of course, I also set my controllers up individually!)

No it is Can, but the second focbox is in slave, so PPM even if it is still activated would not properly work. If he want to change the remote he as to replace the original receiver which is located beside the Master Focbox (under the BMS)

To prevent stripping, get Wera Hex Plus set, if you don't own one already :+1:

I do know that some socket head cap 10mm m3's  will work great on the enclosure of the board as replacements for the stock phillips screws. You can get yourself some m3 cone washers too for a nice visual upgrade and a sturdier hold. 

I thank @Sender for the inspiration there.

Thought I would post this here and go fishing for help from anyone willing to offer it. 

As it stands I have been unsuccessful setting up the Hoyt puck remote with a stock Lacroix board. 

When setting the proper pulsewidth min/max values through the BLDC tool it leaves the deadzone on the remote at a value of 40%, meaning that when the proper pulsewidth values are set i am left with 10 percent brake being applied when not touching anything on the remote. 

I have tried several things to circumvent this, including using the default values for pulsewidth min and max. Doing this does give me 100% throttle and the deadzone is at 50%, but it stops at 23% for min pulsewidth or brake value. 

At this point im really at a loss for how to proceed. Using the Vesc_Tool requires updating the firmware on the Lacroix and I really don't want to loose or change anything about the way the board rides/behaves/it's values throttle curve or any of that jazz. 

I just want to safely use this hoyt puck remote so freakin badly. 

Someone....anyone...please give me some advice im at a loss here.

Nah, basically Hoyt told me to reach out to you, the issue is ongoing as the only other way for me to set up the remote without touching the firmware is to allow a throttle value over 100% to give the remote the sweetspot 50% deadzone or resting rate... whatever ya'll call it when you aren't touching the remote. 

Im not savvy enough to upgrade the firmware and mess with motor settings and all that other good stuff because i have literally no idea what any of it means and the only thing im comfortable with at this point is pairing remotes and setting the values. 

I guess the resolution is updating the Lacroix boards firmware, im just not sure what all that entails and im afraid it's going to ruin the current feel of the way the board rides.

Loosing the nose is what will happen here in a good hard turn.  If the bearing feels good make sure everything is tight and put 20 miles on it see if it resolves itself.  If the bearing is bad I'll send you over a bearing wheel set.  If it's a pocket problem with the hub I'll ship you another hub if you ship the old one back.

#fakenews 
@mmaner Who said I was mad? and it's a 10s5p and it couldn't do 20miles on a single charge. I never said I wanted it to go 50 miles. :thinking:

Furthermore I'm not the creator of LaSag, LaSagne, LaBasura or even LaKwame... (If you don't believe me you can ask @mikenyc)  These are what peeps in NYC have been saying about the board... I even sent you a picture of what some peeps did using some of the above names with a disclaimer up top. I didn't make them - that's people in NYC venting... 

If you scroll up you'll find that I suggested that Alex make a longer deck option for people with a wider stance... I believe someone said it's currently a porsche and they wouldn't want it to feel like a caddy... I suggested a longer deck option would allow for 12s comfortably and those of us with a wider stance... key word **_option_**... @MoeStooge @Sender seem to echo this...

Finally Please keep in mind out of the 8 or 9 LaKwa riders that started the ride: I was the only one who made it to the end....:eyes:

Most people didn't finish that race because of the shitty weather. 99% of Lacroix owners love everything about this board. I can post here at least 100 possitive reviews. Amazing board. Peace. :+1:

If you want 12s just build a 12s battery.... there's room.

Haven't seen much movement here in a while, is this the calm before the storm? Maybe a new announcement coming soon? :crossed_fingers: 

The thing I would want to change the most on my board would be a longer deck. I think the wheelbase right now is around 34" but you can't use the edges since they curve up so the "usable feet area" is even shorter. At 6'2" tall I can't get a wide enough stance to feel comfortable specially with the power the board has. I compensate by riding with a lower stance compared to my other boards so not a deal breaker.
```

A bit longer would be gret...

Like exactly one more section longer. Enabling easy 12s6p builds withouth playing battery origami and it would have enough room for a wider stance for us bigger guys.

Like a "Lacroix XL."

I agree, as a taller rider I'd love some more EFP. With that said, don't be afraid to use that rear end angle to your advantage. I've put a lot of miles on my Prototipo deck, at 6'4" I've found it most comfortable to bring my trailing foot's heel up onto the angled end and use it like a wedge during heavy acceleration or bombing down hills. Think downhill stance, allows you to tuck in lower for cornering at speed as well.

I never tried that (I will), but I do often use the front end angle to maximize my stance and to help lock in.

Trampa hubs... not sure of battery but I'm guessing 18650 30Q... A Lacroix XL would tick a box on my (infamous) list of suggestions but hey I'm gonna wait and see just how many of my suggestions make it into this new model... Maybe I should start an esk8 consulting firm...:thinking::eyes::v:t6:

Never that!! You never quit your day job!!! Speaking of jobs - I actually rode my Lacroix into work yesterday...My calves were burning after only a few blocks... I took it easy and made it to work with like 33% battery left but that cut off had me below boosted speeds - I let the board sit for 2 hours then plugged her up to get a full charge for the journey home(17 miles)... 1/4 into my way home it started raining so I hopped on the subway... The train is about a good 1/2 mile from my house and it's all uphill... When I got to my stop the rain had ceased but the streets were still damp... I decided to ride home and got home with no issues... I turned off my remote then went to turn off the board and nothing!!! The board wouldn't turn off... I tried to look at the battery percentage via xmatic and nothing... Now I have a board that won't shut off - I'm about to open her up to see the goings on... will report back...:thinking:

Hi Guys, New to this  Community, just wanted to say that  I recently received my new LaCroix Board. Adding a picture of it, I took it  for a 5 mile  try out  and I still had a full charge, I haven’t felt that 1 or 2 miles  abrupt stop others are talking about also the remote feels pretty good  and responsive,  don’t think I’ll ever have to do a remote upgrade if it keeps working that way.  I have a GT and a GTX,  immediately felt the difference, I didn’t have to go to far for that.  I ride with my two sons so the only problem I will have is getting them off my new LaCroix.
I think I’m really going to enjoy this board.![image|666x500](upload://zDJIDLEtvLWEMF69pwRrPnaIMNw.jpeg) ![image|231x500](upload://bYeNSADDPzp0juvWJepiYIwCJ4o.jpeg)

Dss60 for sale. About 1000kms on it. The board is in excellent condition. Two remotes included. 
Asking 2300$ us plus shipping. I am from Canada. Willing to ship to Canada or US. PM me for questions. 

Selling since i fell once again. Probably not skilled enough for riding such a beast.
