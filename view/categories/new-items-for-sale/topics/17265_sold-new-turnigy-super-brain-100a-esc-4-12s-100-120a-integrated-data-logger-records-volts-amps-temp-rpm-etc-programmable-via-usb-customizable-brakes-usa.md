## **Turnigy Super Brain 100A Brushless ESC**
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/2/620efeaaf600089ccc87fd83988d2018a0c78db7.jpg" width="565" height="414">
**Specs**
Constant Current: 100A
Burst Current: 120A
Battery: 4-12S 
Motor Type: Brushless 
Size: 69 x 52 x 24mm
Weight: 109g


This ESC is very robust and practically bullet-proof.  It has a large aluminum heatsink and can handle over double the current as the VESC.  It is rated for  **100A continuous** with 120A burst!  Perfect for those high current setups

The cool thing about this speed controller is that it **logs all of your data** for your last 5 rides.  It stores voltage, current, temperature, and RPMs, all of which you can review as an interactive chart.   You can program all the ESC settings over USB on your computer (or with your TX).  Unlike most hobby ESC's on the market, the Super Brain has different braking settings.  



**Look at that heatsink!**

Yes it was sold.  That's why it says [SOLD!]  :smile:

But I haven't heard back on the buyer's experience. I never used it, but I still think it would be a viable VESC alternative if you need the 100-120A current

Well here in the Netherlands having good brakes is kind of crucial. We have good infrastructure but on the other side of that coin we do have a lot of traffic, so yeah.

Thanks for the reply fellows! Ill just buy a VESC in hindsight of learning this information.
