The first one looks a little short to be a 6374 motor.

lol I know I read the spec I think it's really a 60/63 which would explain its ball-like appearance ü§î

I bought the first motor. It's significantly noisier than the Turngy SK3 192Kv.

Far more "whine" in general. High pitched too. Maybe it was just my motor though.

It's prob because of the ESC....

Different ESC make motors sound different

This ebay listing is comical. Dude claims this is a 50mph board in some electric skateboard racing league. 

"It is the only Powered Skateboard that is approved by the NAPSR, National Association Of Powered Skateboard Racing League."

@jedi And he's not wrong, that's a piece of history right there, that's one of very first electric skateboards I believe to be out there and I remember seeing a YouTube video about it they were on a track and I believe I saw @MoeStooge being in it. I do not agree with the price but they did hit 50mph with like this racing track that is small and curved at a angle type of thing

That‚Äôs fascinating. I‚Äôve stumbled across this board or the ‚Äúx-caliber ‚Äú type spec on eBay before.  I chuckled  at what looked like a primitive, ill conceived design, especially when paired with a ‚Äúnational league‚Äù description. 

I suppose the quote about ‚Äústanding on the shoulders of giants‚Äù is appropriate here. My first attempt at a gas powered board 15yrs ago as high school senior was utter dogshit. Never ran, pissed off parents, ruined our weed eater. 

I look at my initial tinkering with boards on Instagram from only 2 yrs ago and I‚Äôm mildly embarrassed. I guess my current build (which I believe is approaching peak esk8 for its class and my subjective preference üòâ) is built upon the burned out drv‚Äôs and skinned knees of these literal trailer blazers. ![image|666x500](upload://gIj6RaahK6IZq8LmdY8qdl0bPh6.jpeg)

A coffee table book of eskate milestones would be awesome. Id buy it or support one on a kickstarter.

That's a big negative there Ghost Rider. I've been messing with Esk8 for maby 18 months.  The track they we're racing on is the Encino Velodrome right here in sunny SoCal. As you can see in the video they are hitting no where near 50mph, maby a theoretical speed. I've been kicking the Idea of SPD3 being held there.    https://youtu.be/C0cNMqGPCa0   ![Screenshot_20180523-050823|281x500](upload://q7YzpWl7PKmM3EP10iw2RGJapQs.png)
