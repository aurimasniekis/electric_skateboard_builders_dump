Not too sure about the protection of the back pad seeing as it's a 2-ply piece of harder/softer foam, but the elbow and shoulder pads are Zeus something or other and are pretty firm and have plenty of cushion. I've heard you can replace the back padding material with something better though so it's got some upgradeability if you're not happy whit it..

I have fallen in mine twice now.  Nothing too crazy, but the hoodie made it to where literally nothing happened.

I think it is worth the final pricetag.

It is quality, and incredibly comfortable for the amount of padding you get.


Protection with looking like a fucking dork in a motorcycle jacket.

Awesome.


And the back pad helped me out for sure on a three roll scuffle fall.  I tried to race a damn sport bike light to light, I was winning, but hit some road BS.  


Get the hoodie now before they are scooped up at the good pricepoints.  The super early birds sold out in like 20 minutes or something.


You really won't regret it.


Sizing wise, remember it is a hoodie.  I like mine a little roomy (how a hoodie should fit) and my XL fits my 6ft 200lbs body great.

Have you ordered one on Indiegogo? then just write to support@lazyrolling.com and it will be fixed. 
If you are thinking to buy and want to change, it's not a problem at all, but you'll need to cover shipping.

I ordered on IndieGoGo. Super Early Backer :stuck_out_tongue: I'll probably write an email, because I just measured one of my hoodies that fit pretty good with sweatshirt and it's 56cm.

@LazyRolling

How does the hoodie fit completely naked, but the hoodie tied around your waste covering your nakedness?


My friend is on the fence and wants pictures.

Fuck. I just ran into like, exactly enough spare cash for this from returning a pair of boots that were poop. Seems like a good investment, especially for college use. At the same time, I'm going to gain at least 25lb ASAP after I have surgery and I presume that's probably enough to grow me out of what size would fit well right now.

Money could also be put towards TB110's or a helmet - I'd never ride without a helmet or gloves with schaphoid protection, but until I'm trying to go super high speed elbows seem slightly less important. Really wishing I didn't lose my nicely padded dual-shell lamb leather jacket while drunk right now lmao

Tough decision, poverty reeks

Haha, you guys are killing me :/.

Trying to find a good way to reply without sounding like a pretentious arseeater.

I'm painfully aware of third world poverty. Being empathetic kinda sucks ass sometimes.  Attempting to fix the earth seems like a nearly insurmountable task. Greed and this article is a pretty good idea of why.
https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/how-a-worm-gave-the-south-a-bad-name/&ved=2ahUKEwiu45ji_8XgAhVI3IMKHWh0ATYQFjAAegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw11fwKzOaU4pssnbzRkDvMk

Anyways, I live in the 8th poorest country in the U.S., I'm thankful for everything I have. Currently in recovery from a life-threatening illness that will shadow me for the rest of my life - even more so - especially knowing there are thousands of people in third world countries with the same syndrome I have without access to the surprisingly difficult treatment needed to help it, not to mention the material possessions I'm able to come home to every day.

Anyways, that aside, I've also never spent money on alcohol in my life. Friends treat me sometimes because I don't get to come around much anymore. Which is why running off and losing the jacket I've had since middle school, grew out of, and somehow shrunk back(lmfao) into sucked even more. 

I'm also super fucking lucky I did well in school and got a dick load and a half of scholarships and grants I wasn't even aware of or else I'd probably be fucked off and done something that would have me dead by this point. I'm in the area surrounded by the places hardest hit by the opioid and heroin academic(I will keep this unedited, to show how bad autocorrect is to change epidemic into academic) - it's legit like a first world glimpse into the apocalypse haha.

Anyways, I don't mean to turn this into a pity blog post. It was insensitive of me to refer to poverty in a hobby like ours - but I'm at least very much aware of how shitty some people really do have it in the rest of the world. Very surprisingly and kinda fucking infuriatingly, the actual severity of it never crosses a fair amount of college kids in my area's mind.
