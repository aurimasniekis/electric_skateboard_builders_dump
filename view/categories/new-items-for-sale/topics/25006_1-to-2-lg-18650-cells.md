Given the specs and picture, I think they're these cells.

http://www.staringpower.com/product/lgdamf11865-18650-2200mah/

20A discharge rating isn't bad, but not how sure how they'll perform. Voltage sag may be large or capacity maybe smaller than indicated

for the samsung they are 22p cells.

I was seriously thinking of getting a couple to try out. the performance wont be very good. but a 10s4s would have about **40A and 280wh hr for <$100 with 2 chargers** 

these are pretty much what benchwheel/liftboard/koowheel are all using. 10A cells 2.2 ah.

I did buy one of these packs (Samsung) to try them out for my sons eboard cause his lipos were starting to puff up and I must say, they work very good for the price. I also bought a hoverboard charger (36v upto 42v) for $10 on Ebay to charge them up, it took less than 2hrs from battery 31% to 100%. Not a bad product for the price.

I did the same!  Very happy with how it performed considering the low price.  I'm using a laptop charger that definitely gets quite hot (but works).  Mind linking the charger you purchased?  Does it get really hot during use?

I purchased one of these chargers and I changed charging plug to a xt60 connector. "Mine does not get very hot" I purchased two of these battery packs and haven't experienced sag yet, i rode 7 miles the other day and still had 48% battery power left.

Ive been staring at these packs on ebay for a couple weeks now, deicide to spring on it based on this thread.... so adding the xt wire to this charger....was it a straight forward snip the end off...separate the pos/neg wire inside and connect? just making sure but seems about right.

thanks!

If you want my honest opinion -- before I can take the seller seriously, they need to figure out how to operate their keyboard correctly.  I mean, I don't trust them with my batteries if they can't correctly operate a CapsLock key.

right on thx... since you peeled it apart would u happen to know how many charging amps you think the bms can handle? I have a 5amp speed charger Im planning on using but dont want to fry it =/

..and one other thing... if I wanted to add a JST plug to connect to a charging port instead of unplugging the battery from the board each time... couldnt I just splice into the lead wires? or am I missing something?  thx

I was thinking on buying 3 packs to make a 60 cell 12s4p 13.2amp battery. 

Id like it as slim as possible, so can you tell me if they can be disassembled but maintain sets of 4 welded together. Ideally id like to reuse as much as i can from the original welded configuation.

If you are only using 1 charging cable to charge, I'm almost 100 percent sure that 2/3 of your packs are not being balanced correctly(or at all).

EDIT: I just mean that the BMS isn't performing balancing features. The cells will still "naturally" balance themselves to some extent(eg: all the ppl running with no bms).

Not if your bus bar is thick enough to not offer any resistance that would affect each pack discharging and charging at the same rate
Each BMS still balances it's set of 10s2p

It can't. Most BMS's only perform balancing when connected to the charger(as far as I know). They should still MONITOR balance during operation though.

All BMS remain connected till charging is done for all, I haven't had chargers shut off if 1 pack gets to full before the rest, that one idles(doesn't go over 42v) while the rest finish

So then you must have your charging port connected directly to the main battery leads(of the completed pack, after parallel connections). You are charging by bypassing the bms.

The only power leads are connected to the BMS...
BMS isn't bypassed for anything
These 4 XT60 are connected in parallel, that goes to a fused charge port and fused/keyed discharge port

BTW I am totally just curious and I'm not attempting to criticize in any way. :grin:

so question.. i have a few of these same LG packs now... and to fit my case i need em 5 wide and 2 high.. i looked at the final 4pack thas mounted on top, based on the last pic (which looks exactly like mine) is basically 2p at the top and all in series at the bottom... right? so if if i fold the top 2 toward the left will the nickel strip bend and hold? then all i have to do maybe re-solder the positive lead wire.. and maybe the small series wire pictured if it doesnt reach or bend right... is this making sense??
```

the top has 2 separate nickel strips, but the bottom has 1 strip connecting all 4 batteries... so if i crack it apart in the middle and fold the top 2 to the left the bottom strip will bend/fold over on its self.. but will it hold?

as in.. instead of 3 pos/neg leads into one connection...

could i connect the first 2 in parallel.... then use another Y cable from that and the 3rd pack??

ill attach a shitty diagram just for clarity.

I hope you do it anyway and see what happens.  I just wouldn't wanna blow something up to try something new.

alright I finally tested the pack and i’ve gotta say... it is amazing!  27a batt. max is enough for me and the range on it is crazy.  only other mod I did was rearrange the packs into 2 cells thick instead of three.  don’t try that if you not god with a soldering iron though.  also **PLEASE** insulate the living shit out of these packs.  I really don’t want another battery fire.  anywhere you see exposed metal, cover it.  I insulated all mine with a layer of foam held on with electrical tape then duct tape over the whole thing.  no fires here 😉

The seller on Ebay slightly misrepresented these cells. I watched the video review linked by @Tampaesk8er. Very thorough review. In the description of the video the reviewer, Richard Loyd gave a link to the LG specs:

http://www.houseofbatteries.com/documents/5216-BatteryLines/LGLithiumIon18650MF1Rechargeable.pdf

It states that the absolute maximum discharge rate per cell is 10A. Not the continuous rating. Still a good pack. Decent capacity for cheap!

So I wonder then if these Sona cells from the same ebay seller which claim a 20A continuous would even be worth looking into if he's using the same sort of BMS on the LG's?   https://goo.gl/4ietNv

Also, it seems if you wanted the 5 pack discount on the LG's he no longer is selling them in the "4 on top" config and it's switched to an even "brickier" configuration.  https://goo.gl/qpWbuZ  Curious to see how easily that can be rearranged

I ended up buying 1 pack from [here](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-LG-36V-4-4AH-BATTERY-PACK-18650-EBIKE-VAPE-POWERWALL-BATTERIES-20-CELLS-BMS-/172630688902?hash=item2831974486:g:nKUAAOSwuspY9YNZ)

While I was reforming the pack to fit my form factor I noticed that these are LGEAMF11865 cells. The [datasheet](http://www.diypowerwalls.com/printthread.php?tid=2006) for these cells states that the max continuous discharge is 10A but the standard discharge is 430mA. I knew I wouldn't get the 500 rated cycles pushing the batteries this hard but supprisingly I only ended up getting less than 10 cycles before the voltage started to drop below 20v under load. 

I just bought 24 Samsung 30Q's to replace these. Save yourself $40 and just get some better batteries at the start.

Note: The only place I could find any information about these cells is [here](http://www.diypowerwalls.com/printthread.php?tid=2006)

So what do you limit your battery amps to in BLDC tool? 10s2p: 10A, 10s4p: 20A, 10s6p: 30A?

what r u thoughts on this? So I got 4 packs running in parallel for my ebike, when i got home before i started charging em I plugged this LCD battery display (cheap one from china) to see what the % was for it. 

It said 55% but i got curious to see if each individual pack was at 55% which hopefully it was. One of the 4 read 14%, the other 3 @ 55%

Ive attached a sketch of the parallel connector I made and hopefully didnt mess that up... but one main wire pos/neg, about 7-9" in length and then spliced in 3 spots where i stripped the wire and soldered the extra connections. Did i do it right and what are the thoughts on the one pack? It was plugged into slot 3 if i remember right.. 

thanks

Put some pictures up of the wiring and joints it's likely a bad solder somewhere or something else silly. Out of curiousity did you test the packs individually first, do a capacity  test, make sure they're matched

[/quote]

ill try and unravel the wire tonight when i get home and take a pic, but testing capacity, if u dont remember we never solved the issue why my stupid ass multimeter wont give me a legit voltage reading... on a AA it reads fine, but on all the lith-ion packs this (or close to it) is the number i get... so even if the number is skewed for some reason its consistent across all the packs so i assume yes theyre all the same.

Ok so no.laughing at my.newbie skills... But.here I go and heres what it.looks.like... Today after.riding the bike and.wearing.em down... And based on previous pic... #4 was dead and no energy.to even.light the LCD... #3 said zero... And #1 and #2 both read 23% which was the reading I got from the end.funnel point... So what r your thoughts? 

It would.appear based.on the limited results that the power drains the pack all together but.the battery closest to esc in the chain gets drained.first.and.it.works its way down the line.
Thanks!

Looks like cold solder joints/bad flow to me
I wouldn't use that wire either, you need high strand, flexible preferred
This is just solder sitting on the wire, it is not "soldered"

The parallel/bus connection should be able to carry the total current of all the packs combined and have some headroom, also keeping them close helps

My "line" for 20650/20700/21700s is being able to have 1 less P with same capacity and discharge as 18650 with same capacity and discharge 

So like 10S3P 2xxxx being same capacity and discharge as 10S4P 18650 30q, etc

I bought 2 LG packs about two weeks ago. I have been riding them daily. I'm charging to 41v and down to about 33v. The other day I rode for 17 miles, started at 40.5, ended at 35v. This was all over Berkeley and Oakland. We have kind of mild grades in the bay flats. I was doing 20mph uphill, mixed ride, up and down. This is on a single Ollin OM5065 with max battery amps at 17 and -8.

I saw some discussion on the cells for sale above- I just got my pack from him today, and mine are still the LGEAMF12...whatever's. So I think he still has them, just make sure you order the right ones? Or maybe add a note saying you're looking for the LG cells specifically? It does look like he's out of the samsung cells.

Also, @scepterr I asked the guy about the amperage of the battery/BMS, and he said it was limited to 20amps, not 10 amps as you said somewhere above. I don't have the means to test it to verify, but could you clarify why you say 10 amps? My BMS is the small square one that he attaches to the side of the pack if that makes a difference. If these are the same cells that the Meepo/diyeboards uses I feel alright about pushing it to 20 amps, but you're obviously the expert

There are a bunch of bms variations that they ship with,if you order 10 you can get get 7 diff BMS, if you cant find anything about it by searching the model #, you can try to look up the mosfets on the BMS to get an idea of what they can handle, I've seen BMSs that do 10A,12,15 and some 20, but the 20A ones were in the very first batch of 50 packs I got, BMS PCB in the middle of the pack, those are impossible to get. A couple I found were 15A, 75% were 10-12A BMS out of 100 packs. 

I think an important factor that shouldn't be overlooked, yes it's the same model # as boards have and packs have you can buy today, but they are MUCH older, stored in unknown conditions...

I've individually tested 200 cells out of the 2000 I got, they are at around 90% of original capacity which isnt bad, but the internal resistance was at least double what the datasheet says, at 1C(2A) continuous 4.2-3.3v these cells get to 70+c easy which is not good. That's why you want as many P as possible to keep current per cell down.

I see, that's good to know. I'm running 10s4p (or will be, as soon as I get the pack rearranged) and the amp limits will be at the BMS's, so 40 max... or 20amps from my meepo battery, and however many from this new one. Just using both BMS's in parallel. Reckon that's a safety issue? I figure if the amp limit isn't as advertised it'll just be weaker than expected, but shouldn't hurt anything I wouldn't think.

If you hit the overcurrent limit the BMS will shut the pack down, likely both, either one after the other or at the same time

You can bypass the BMS for discharge and just use it for charging

Cool. So long as it doesn't light up on me or anything :) I'm planning on getting around to making a 30q pack one of these days, but this will cover me till that happens. Thanks for help!

anybody been testing out the range on these packs and have opinions? i have 4 of these packs to eventually use for a build im doing BUT in the mean time ive been using em in my ebike paralleled together for an 8p... its only a 500w front hub but im only getting like 25mi max before theyre dead (as a whole) and im not throttling hard... is it me or does this range seem low? Id be happy with a solid 30mi before they really started to die out =/

Hey everyone, hoppin in the thread late cuz I just made an account. I've purchased one of these for my ebay board builds. I desoldered the top four batteries to move it to the side for clearance, then soldered wires from the previous nickel plated leads on the batteries back to the same spots on the bms. Got everything installed on my board, and it's been working great. Now i have this issue when I am trying to charge it, the charger has a red led which turns green when it is done charging. for some reason, even when I rewired everything the charger stays green. Do you think i might have damaged the batteries/bms or is it possible for the charger to just be broken? I'm not sure how to check, but I dont have the of money to just replace parts.

i had a similar issue when I located the cells to side for a 5 wide battery... my soldering skills were shit (still are) and the wire from one group to other kept coming loose. id recheck that...or even use your hand and put pressure where the wire is and see if squeezing it makes contact... this all assume the pack is all wrapped up and you cant visually see things... if its still unwrapped and bare then I dunno...

Yeah exactly I made mine five wide as well. My soldering isn't the best and I could understand if i messed something up, but the wires are all in tact. I also left it unwrapped.. should i not do that

it’s fine if you leave it semi unwrapped, just make sure to insulate any exposed metal or nickel.

this is a bad practice (wrapping in kapton) but I did it anyway

I recommend kapton for covering all the connections then heatshrink the entire pack

I have one of these packs and I'm disassembling it to build a 10s2p that's only 1 cell high. Unfortunately, the plastic covering the cells came off when I pried them apart, so now it's just bare metal.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/9/e92ec9fb2c66eb8ac829de3e3305888336f51540.jpg" width="367" height="500">

I'm assuming I need to cover this metal with heat shrink or something when I reassemble the pack? Does anyone know if this bare metal shorts to the positive or the negative? Or neither?

The outer can of all Li-ion cells is negative.
