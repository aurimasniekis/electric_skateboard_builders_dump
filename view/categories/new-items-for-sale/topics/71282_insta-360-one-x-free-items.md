I just finally got a gopro. I should enjoy it before buying another action camera that will probably make me never use my gopro again. Lol
Can't wait to see what you do with your 360 one x. I enjoy your videos on Instagram

I like it for its easy editing from my phone, kinda lazy with desktop. I use gopro for a while but invisible selfie stick is awesome üòÑ (fusion too pricy). I use the previous insta 360 one, but i found that they always freeze when i use it for snowboarding, really want to try this.

after the videos from kaly last weekend i¬¥m close to get a 360 too....
just...i need to stop ordering things...
i didn¬¥t look up so much about 360 cameras yet.
how you guys would rate the insta 360 one x compared to other 360 cameras?

I use the previous insta 360 one, what i dont like about it is the unremoveable battery, battery wont last in the cold (freeze many times), stabilization was so so, stitching not very good if facing the sun, beside that,but i still love it tho, it has a lot of feature like bullet time etc, so fun to bring one small camera and get creative with it. i also like the simple editing apps, like i can do everything on my phone. I use gopro all the time since the 1st edition üòÑ, this one just so fun to skip üòÅ

Anyway i also try the gopro fusion, that one is a massive camera, love it, i think for serious videographer fusion maybe better, but casual shot, shoot and post, insta 360 very enjoyable. And it is so lite comparing to fusion.

gopro fusion, that one is a massive camera
[/quote]

from the pictures of the insta 360 it does not look so much smaller than the gopro fusion. more like more long but more slim. but over all not really smaller

Little off topic...How did you get into Esk8 @XTLA.  In my case my first board was a Hobie flex.  I could pump up a 10 degree hill and prob put over 5,000 miles on it over 8 years.  Now older appreciate the ability to to skate with a little less work.  It is great to see diversity in the skateing community and more specifically someone interested in the technology side.
