As most of you know, i build custom batteries for people.  Thank you to all of the people who ordered from me, i appreciate your business.  needless to say i can be swamped at times but i enjoy the workload.  I am now a bit more available and have extra time to expand and serve more people.  

All batteries come with 2A charger, percent display, soft switch, and the pack itself. the 10s8p and 12s6p come with a 150A BMS as they are intended for mountainboard, they also come with a water proof box.

FREE SHIPPING IN THE USA
SAMSUNG 25 R cells


6s4p 60A 	$363.58
6s5p 60A 	$398.34
6s6p 60A 	$438.25
8s4p 60A 	 $406.13
8s5p 60A	         $457.63
8s6p 60A         $498.83
10s3p 60A	$397.18
10s4p 60A	$455.12
10s5p 60A	$518.21
10s6p 60A	$576.14
10s7p 60A	$679.14
10s8p 150A	$804.04

12s3p 60A	$445.53
12s4p 60A	$520.20
12s5p 60A	$589.73
12s6p 150A	$774.37

I can customize layout
I can upgrade amp max on the BMS
I can upgrade to a fast 5A charger


Sometimes i have extra BMS's on hand and if that the case the order will be built and ship out with a couple days, but most times i dont keep them on hand so it could take up to 3 weeks to get your order. If there is enough interest I will begin to order BMS's ahead of time to reduce wait. YES my prices are 20-30 dollars higher as compared to the Enertion or DIY.  I make these packs one at a time not as a production run so naturally i have to charge more. The benefit of one pack at a time is the ability to make custom packs, I offer the most diverse selection of packs that i am aware of in the eboard market. 

Batteries are guaranteed working on arrival. IF not I will pay for return shipping and fix the issue.  All other claims are subject to review depending on circumstance. 


(im sure there is something i forgot to mention but oh well)

finally somewhere to get batteries if I want to build a tank! lol

Just curious why do you use samsung 25r instead of lg hg2? extra 500mah per cell..still 20a discharge...simular price at those numbers...
```

## \#7 Posted by: barajabali Posted at: 2016-09-10T02:09:19.009Z Reads: 705

```
Yea the LG cells are cheaper and I get a bit more capacity out of them. But the peak discharge is also lower. Aswell as discharge rate. 

It would be a wise idea for me to use LG on my larger packs but I get my cells cheaper when I buy in bulk so I stick with one cell.
```

## \#8 Posted by: saul Posted at: 2016-09-10T02:26:39.935Z Reads: 678

```
Yea I couldn't find the peak discharge numbers, figured that was probably part of it.

 Maybe we just need a small super cap pack to supplement the peak current of batteries...
I think most sites give bulk rates even if you mix cells. but i'm sure its easier to just have a standard since its a side thing for you. for now...

Yea I already have 2 orders of the 10s8p pack. With some variation. 

I have a lot of work ahead of me lol 

These packs are plug and play so crunch the numbers and see if it's really too expensive.  You'll get crazy range out of the 10s8p

I've ordered a few packs now and all I can say is when you factor in Switch, bms, charger and display these prices are competitive. That said, I seriously can't imagine (seeing what I've seen) that these aren't the best packs available.

yup, small standard brick 2A or extra $ for fast charger 5A though some say that deteriorates the battery.  all to say, the charger is not a distinctinve part of this equation because @barajabali has nicely wired BMS and standard charging port for those of (includes me) who are not going to be balancing charging multiple LIPO packs separately every night!  Money well spent here, believe me.

I am getting a much longer deck made, so will have space for the box.

I need a 10,000mAh 9s battery pack. Please quote prices for packs using 25r cells, he2 cells, or anything else you can think of that will work. I am trying to keep price as low as possible, so please pick the cheapest configuration _**that still uses quality cells**._  I want a BMS/PCM and a charger as well. 

I am getting quotes from many different companies. My lowest so far is $280 for a 9s4p pack made with 25r's, including a BMS (actually a PCM in this case), a charger, and shipping.

Edit: As a stretch goal, please quote how much extra it would cost to include a fuel gauge, an on/off switch, and to make the pack waterproof.

A water proof battery pack... That's is not really possible unless you custom make an enclosed enclosure just for the battery and seal it. It won't be cheap... At all.

Why not just make the enclosure for your board water resistant? All you need is a few rubber gasket seals and Silicon sealed ports.

@barajabali Just wondering. I have an enertion dual raptor I just bought a couple weeks ago. I have an extra space cell coming but I'm thinking about buying yet another battery to extend my range even more. And I like to support the people in these forums. Are you able to build me one that will fit it? Am I able to get an even bigger battery in it? I'm new to all of this as it's my first eboard so I ask a lot of questions. ;)

@barajabali 

Sorry for being a flake. For some reason I just totally let this thread out of my brain! But I'm kinda glad now as I'm starting a project to build my first e-board. So I will definitely need a battery made. I have the enertion space cell enclosure http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/space-cell-pro-enclosure/ and am wanting a battery with everything included, power switch, bms, percentage screen, ect... I just want whatever it needs to be able to plug in and go. Let me know how much and what info you need. Thanks.

Well it says the the space cell enclosure will hold 40x 18650 Cells. So does that mean we can get a 10SP4 or whatever the space cell 4 is I guess. I'm so new at this that I have no clue. Lol. I should probably ask @onloop the specs unless you've worked with the space cell enclosure before?

Oh I don't think it's gonna fit unless I can put the bms on top of the cells. 

I think if you're gonna go with a standard 10s4p the SS4 might be a better option for you for price and size! 

I'd like to have your business but I also can't just shove my products where they may not belong

my bad got confused there for a second.  
I can totally make that work.  I do need to order a charger though which would be about 3 weeks to get in.  I may be able to expedite it. 

I stopped carrying stock after i ran out since the season died out

You talking about a charger to actually charge the battery? If that's the case don't worry about it. I have two fast chargers that I got from Enertion for my Raptor batteries. Would those work?

Perfect! I can just minus the price of the charger and you can use the one you have. Can you show me a picture of the port it has?

Hey man,

I don't know how to send a private message so i'm just gonna ask my question here, okay?

I regularly see people with motors that can pull a max om 80A.
Online once read that the max ampere output of a battery is Ah * C 
So for a lot of people i've seen its 5 * 30 = 150A

What am i missing?

Thanks, Bram

C Is generally used for lipo batteries but for liion you'll see a max Cont discharge and max peak discharge (usually given with a time frame I.e. 1 second at 100amps) 

The max amp output is usually given on a pack by multiplying what one cell can output so for the 25Rs it is 20amp Cont, and for a 10s4p battery you'd multiple 20 *4p which is 80 cont

I use double (sometimes triple for extra large packs) 8mm nickel. 4 spot welds per terminal per nickel strip layer. Kapton tape on all edges and completely incased in kapton wrap for wetness protection and heat protection. I use extreme strength hotglue and fiber tape that keep it all together. Also heat shrinked with pvc wrap

[/quote]

yeah.. that's about right. That's very close to what i price mine at as part of a complete because yes, building your own packs by hand can be very tedious and time consuming, and its easy to make mistakes so you have to really pay attention and be vigilant. Glad to see you're charging what they're worth. :)
