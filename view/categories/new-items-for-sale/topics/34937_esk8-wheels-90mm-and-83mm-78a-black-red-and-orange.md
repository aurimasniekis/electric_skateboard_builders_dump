Yes i have see the wheels for 17.99$ and i have see the shipping cost too for 59$
In USA you became the Abec 11 Fly Wheels for 60$
In EU cost the same wheel 85€
Thats the different.

Branding is usually free from the factories ( Maytech even does it for their motors). It means nothing and in the US the 17.99 wheels + shipping is $26. Not sure where you got your dollar amount from.

I think the $59 was calculated by Ebay for the shipping, because i looking with a German account.
