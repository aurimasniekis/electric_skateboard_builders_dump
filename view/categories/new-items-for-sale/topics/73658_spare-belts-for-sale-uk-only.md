Hi everyone,

I've got some spare belts for sale which I've never used.

- 285-5M-15 HTD belt (285mm length, 5mm pitch, 15mm width)
- 275-5M-15 HTD belt (275mm length, 5mm pitch, 15mm width)
- 265-5M-15 HTD belt (265mm length, 5mm pitch, 15mm width)

I've got 2 of each belt type.
Â£3 per belt, plus P&P. UK only.

All brand new never fitted. I bought them as spares incase one snapped but never came into that situation. I'm selling them due to my setup changing and they're either too short or too long.

Cheers,
Daniel
