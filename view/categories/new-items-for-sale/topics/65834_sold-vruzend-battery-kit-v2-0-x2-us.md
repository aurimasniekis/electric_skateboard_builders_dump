Hi folks!

Time to unload some of the impulse purchases I've made this year!
I have two (2) Vruzend V2.0 battery kits for sale. Bought during their kickstarter, and haven't even taken them out of the bag. I had this notion that I'd build my own badass battery, but I've since decided that I won't fux with battery building and leave that to capable professionals. Anyway, on to the details..

**Vruzend Battery Kit V2.0** (enough for 30 cells) includes:
* 60 caps with nickel-plated copper alloy spring contacts 
* 60 nickel-plated copper alloy nuts 
* 90 nickel-plated pure copper bus bars 
* 4 nickel-plated copper alloy clamps 
* 4 zip ties
Note: the V2.0 kit is rated at 20A continuous and 25A peak per cell

Well, technically $33.99 and they charge add'l shipping of $8.96 that scales up with quantity. I'm offering it for $35 flat or $65 for both, free shipping. @kylem21
