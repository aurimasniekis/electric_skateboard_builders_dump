So you want to build a Vanguard, a Boosted Board clone, but with 3 times more range, double the power and Torque and bigger wheels, but you don't have the skills or tools to do everything.

Well, I have most of the parts ready to ship.

Loaded Vanguard flex 3 deck with channels, pre-routed for positive and NEGATIVE for VESC wires.
USD 165 shipped to USA

Are you interested in the Vanguard enclosure?

I could ship those with bolts and screws and battery capacity tester.

Hey I need a enclosure for a loaded skateboard. I was looking at the Icarus skateboard and I would like to know if the Vanguard enclosure fits properly with the Loaded Icarus deck. Please let me know as soon as you can. Thank you and have a good day.

You could use the loaded vanguard enclosure, it will work.

However the Vanguard enclosure follows the shape of the Loaded Vanguard as it was designed for it.

The two piece vanguard set will allow flexiness on the center of the deck.

Is there any possibility there is a 12s4p enclosure that doesn't cover the middle part of the board? Similar to the enclosures that go on both ends of the board. Maybe a higher enclosure that you offer with the same style? Or if there is a possibility to squeeze 12s4p battery in a 12s3p enclosure? Please let me know. Thanks

Are you already in progress? If yes then ignore this- but would you consider selling it if I gave the original asking price? The reason I ask is because I really have no idea how to make the channels myself and It would be awesome to have that done already since it seems like it's gonna be the hardest part of my build.

Thanks!
