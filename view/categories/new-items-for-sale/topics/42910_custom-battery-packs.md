What AH batteries are you using? Looking for a 142x90x40mm 10s2P to replace my current meepo (1.0) supplied battery pack. They list their sanyo tesla cell battery replacement at $295 shipped. Do you have access to the sanyo 20700B cells?

Those cells are like 8-9 dollars a piece last I checked... I came across a thread where they showed you how to get the Sanyo 20700A cells, which are actually much better, you just have to buy like a certain power tool battery pack and then open it up and get the batteries out from there.  If memory serves me right, these batteries aren't even available atm for individual sales, but acquiring them this way it works out to like 6 something a cell.... Very very good deal for the new cell format!  Find the that on here and you'll get a better idea of what I'm saying.

This is a GREAT deal!!!  Carvon sells a 12s3p pack with only the sensor wires and main connection for $500, and others charge over $850 for a 12s5p setup the way your doing with everything included.  VERY reasonable pricing!  If I ever need a battery I'll go through you for sure!

What would you charge for a 12s8p with everything except a BMS and a charger, but built as 2 6s8p  side by side, that can be connected to make it a 12s8p?  This would allow me to use a hobby balance charger with dual charge ports since they don't make one that goes above 10s balance charger.

I've been thinking of foregoing a BMS and having voltmeters and just balance charge often.  It's supposed to increase your battery life by 3x and you get better performance from your battery when you don't run a BMS

Can you please explain why a battery pack without a BMS will be capable of 3x more cycles, compared to a pack with a BMS?

Yeah I just found that, though I think they stopped producing it and I haven't found any others that do 12s.

Regarding the other statement, I can't say from experience as to the extra life of the battery, but I have been burned multiple times by BMS's that weren't working properly and it's cost me many many hundreds of dollars.  This is what I watched, and I've also read many things and posts from people saying the BMS is better left off or they got better performance without one.

You might get better performance sans BMS if you are using a junky BMS or one that is not rated for the amp output you need.   

If you run less than 60a Max and have a BMS rated for 60a, by a reputable manufacturer like Bestech or SuPower,  wired for both charge and discharge...there is so little chance that you will get less lifetime or less performance that's it's barely worth thinking about.

Well the instances in talking about where they failed me were related to my motorcycle battery with bully e in BMS and it was damn expensive...  I'm still up in the air about it though... I have yet to find another charger besides the one linked earlier that is no longer being made that does 12s so I'm still drawn to the idea of having two separate 6s8p batteries that I could have a separate charger port and balance cables for each so I could dual balance charge them at the same time,  and then also be able to connect the two to bring it up to 12s8p.

A 12s balance charger is gonna be tough to find. I have a board that is 6s that I used to use a balance charger on. I eventually got a BMS and use a 2a brick charger now, it's so much easier.

What cell would be best for a 12s5p or 6p setup with the Carvon V4's XL's? I used to hear the Samsung 30Q's, but now with the options of the 2070's and 2170's I imagine there is some new choices.

Battery showed up quick and as promised. Great seller! Haven't been able to test range yet due to weather but the battery charged up and performed great on my short 3 mile cruise.   

 The BMS is not in the same place so the dimensions are off by quite a bit. Not a drop in for the meepo enclosure. I cut away the foam where the battery sits and used a heat gun on the battery enclosure to deform it enough for the enclosure to seal. Worked great. Also the Meepo uses the smaller HT60 connectors and not the nicer larger XT90 that came with my pack. 

Anyway great seller couldn't be happier.

Hi, do you have any idea how much would it be to ship a 10s3p pack to Brazil?

Hey bimmer not that I am looking for myself but maybe if you offered a price for a battery to fit the LaCroix deck/enclosure you might pick up a few extra sales?

I think at most I could offer pre spotwelded 12s1p packs with 4mm bullets and balance wires.

Hi,
About the BMS, you say "Bms charger", so in discharge I would have to bypass it? Sorry, my english is not very good.
Also, what is the material of the enclosure?  thanks!
Forgot to ask: it comes with the on/off siwtch?

Are you still offering to make custom packs? I’m looking to get either a 8S2P or 10s2p pack with BMS, rated for 40A continuous discharge, in a long flat pack array. 20 cells in a row for the 10s2p or 16x1 for the 8S2P. Wondering what the approximate dimensions (Lxwxh) of the finished packs would be and cost to build. Thanks for your help.

Would be great if someone could build the M1 battery for less. They dropped their battery price to $200 so it’s a bit easier to swallow. But it’s still just 12s1p
