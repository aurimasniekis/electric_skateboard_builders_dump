Hello,
**First thing: I'm not a regular member, I work towards it... So i can't take money in front. So if you want a pack, you can contact me. I will make it and when it is made. Then you can pay.**
I live in Belgium so i can ship to the whole EU.

Pack specs:
You can choose your own battery configuration.
For the pack i use 10x0.15 40A 99.96% Pure Nickel. I use always two layers ore more of nickle. So the pack can give enough amps.
The output wires are 12AWG (80A+) silicone wire . An upgrade to 10AWG(100A+) is possible.
The prices below are with heatshrink, output wires & xt60 connector. It is excl BMS!

Extra options:
10 awg silicone wire **‚Ç¨1**
LCD Battery Indicator/Voltmeter **‚Ç¨10**
Switch for BMS **‚Ç¨2**
XT-90 **‚Ç¨1**
**BMS:**
Cheap 40A BM **‚Ç¨10**
**Bestechpower**  
HCX-D336 (10S- 70A without e-switch) **‚Ç¨40**
HCX-D345 (10S- 60A with e-switch) **‚Ç¨60**


**All prices are an indicator, there may be slight changes (cheaper or more expensive) based on the configuration & type of cells**

You can not take money in front since you are not a regular member.
You must make a battery and then sell it.

Asking publicly for now because maybe others might find this useful...

I'm interested in buying a 12s1p battery pack from you (possibly 12s4p in the future), and was wondering if you could use a different BMS from the ones you listed, because not having to pay for both a BMS and an external e-switch seems like an attractive idea, but the one you offer is only for 10s. Could we work out a deal? :slight_smile: Or maybe (as you have more experience) you'd suggest me a different setup? (I want 12s because I'm planning on running 170kv motors :P )

Most BMS's are specifically made for a certain series, but I would recommend trying to get a DieBieBMS that's developed on the forum, it can be used with different number of series.  @Samau18 is making some now, message and see if there is any room for another order :wink:

Hi man! If i had not already bought everything to make my own pack would I definitely have bought one from you. You're prices are really nice :+1: But there is one thing im curious about:

[quote="pjotr47, post:1, topic:53388"]
For the pack i use 10x0.15 40A 99.96% Pure Nickel
[/quote]

How can they take a maximum of 40A? Wouldn't the maximum for a 10mm X 0.15mm be 13.42A

![Cu%2C%20Ni%2C%20Steel%20efficiency%20chart|549x500](upload://67AaXbcHal5oa69BBd33ZyGIqvU.png)

Also: would you mind showing how you weld the 10S6P packs together? and what spot welder do you use?

Hi,

I used a long time the nickle they sell on ebay, It was advertised as 40A nickle. Now I'am using nickle from Nkon.
I use in my packs always, 3-4 layers of nickle so the amp draw will be no problem.

I am using a Sunkko 709ad spotwelder. You can choose how you want the config off the 10s6p pack.
I made all the packs costom made. 

If you want a pack, send me a PM :)

I can use DPD they do only transport over road or I can use UPS. At UPS I have the possibility to declare the li ion packages in there system.

Hi, it would be 400euros incl shipping. The bms have a e-switch so you can turn the pack off without antispark...

SERVICE TEMPORARILY ON HOLD

With pain in my heart &amp; in order to give the best service to my customers, I temporarily pause my work.
The requested orders &amp; discussed price are still valid and still processed.

Unfortunately, people who now make a request for a quotation must be rejected.

You will still see updates of new battery packs and packs from a while ago, but new orders are temporary no longer accepted.

Hoping for your understanding.


I hope that all other battery builders have the time to deal with the extra orders that come this spring and summer.

I hope to be active again within 3-5 months.

Haha whoops sorry! 

Yeah I know my price is good. From the moment everything is back on the point, prices are unfortunately going up a little. I am going to do my best to keep this limited.

It's not unfortunate if you make a good product. That's why the demand is high. Its only right that you should charge more.

I'll be contacting you for my next battery üëç
