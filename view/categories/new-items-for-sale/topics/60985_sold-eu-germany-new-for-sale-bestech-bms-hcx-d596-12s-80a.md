I’m selling a brand-new, unopened 12s Li-ion BMS. It's the Bestech HCX-D596. Those are only sold in pairs from the factory, which is why I have one left over.

**Price**
The price is 70 Euro + shipping (I've paid 80 Euro including shipping and import duties).
Tracked shipping to Germany is 4,99 €, EU shipping 8,89 € (tracked 13,99 €).

**Specifications:**
Voltage: 12s (Li-ion)
Maximal continuous charging current: 20A
Maximal continuous discharging current: 80A
Size (LWT): L120mm W80mm T20mm
with E-switch

Hi,

I am interested in this BMS, is it still available? 

Quick question though, what are you using to charge it?

Cheers,

Nick

Yes, it's still available.

You can either charge it with one of these LED power supplies: Mean Well HLG-320H-54A
Or with a generic 12s Li-ion charger like this one: https://de.aliexpress.com/item/50-4V-5A-charger-for-12S-Li-ion-battery-pack-4-2V-12-50-4V-battery/32822974586.html?spm=a2g0s.13010208.99999999.259.320e3c00UKsHJ6

Both options have pros and cons.

Great, and I am assuming this will also work with a Li-Po setup?

No, the BMS is only for Li-ion. Li-Po's have a different voltage.

Ah, okay, Im a bit confused then, the Bestech link you provided says - 

 1.Protection Circuit Board for 44.4V 12S Li-ion and Li-polymer battery pack;

Yes, they sell both variants, but I'm only offering the li-ion one.

Ah okay, I didn't realise it was an either or situation. I thought that the BMS could be used for either, my mistake.

[/quote]

yes and no.

liion and lipos have different lower voltage but the same upper voltage.

as long as you control the voltage cutoff through the vesc, charging up to 4.2v per cell will work with this module.
