Hello folks! Basically from my first build I have some small parts left, that I am not going to use in the near future, so I thought I could give them to someone who need them faster than Chinese markets, but still cheap. I do not have a lot of them, so I apologize if something will soon be over :laughing: As the title claims, I am going to sell only small parts because I can keep the shipping cost low, for big and expensive stuffs this is not the place. I will update the list if I find something else:

- **Volt meter Battery/Volt display.** You can program them based on the battery set up, plus you can set the display light time, battery Volt and battery %.
![-455736069-1873361819|500x500](upload://r1xbInOInKQopGOQc4ojIFLDghY.jpg)![12519123981715739510|500x500](upload://ipK0v6b3j2I45zN8hfULTgcYn0n.jpg)

Price: **8 Euro / 9.4 $**

- **HM-10 Bluetooth module Android Oreo Compatible**. The module is plug and play. I solder the wires on it, insulate the single pins, then thewhole module (pictures below).
Since most of us will use this module with @Ackmaniac 's App http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-monitor-android-app/20888?u=rey8801, I thought it would be nice give the opportunity to support his work. So if you want to donate, you only need to add a simbolic 0.10Euro/$ to the cost and I will transfer 10% of the total cost to him on your behalf. Of course I will specify your name in the donation.

PS: The remarkable art sketch is a tag for those who wish to donate :wink:

Price: **9 Euro / 10.60 $. + 0.10 Euro/$ to donate.**
 
- **M4 Anodized Countersunk**. Pack of 10. As we all know they bring additional magic to the board based on the color :roll_eyes: I have them in black, red, purple and blue. 

![M4 Countersunk|624x500](upload://ri9L8LttWAw1RcCxBlRZVuykvLr.jpg)

Price: **4 Euro / 4.7 $ (set of 10)**.

(picuture as example, the wires may differ in colors)

Price: **2 Euro / 2.3 $** **SOLD**

- **3D Printing Service**. Since I know not everyone has a 3D printer (it should :sunglasses: ) if you have your design to be printed I can help. Prices differ based on the models and filament (ABS, PETG, PLA). pm who interested. Shipping cost can not be predicted beforehand. 

- **Customizable Parallel Connectors XT60 XT90**. I have few of them already made ,but I can also make it as you like...Female/male XT60/90.

![IMG_20180302_163156|690x388](upload://hh8ILUuahWlGk60sk5sCZDlI66B.jpg)

Price 4 Euro / 4.7 $

- I do also have other stuffs, cable sleeve, screws and bolts mainly m4 and m5. If you need something else just ask, I might have it

:laughing:


**Shipping Cost**:

**Small letter EU** (limited in size and weight) **2 Euro**
**Large letter EU** (for instance for the volt meter or combined items) **4 Euro**
**Rest of the world 5 Euro / 5.9 $**.

No tracking
Based on the items I need to check which one to use.

Ciao ciao...

That's the reason why I have some left. I order everywhere and I waited forever to get them months later. Most of the things I ended up by pay them way too much. That's why the flea markets.

Eveything you order this evening will be ship tomorrow morning... Efficiency :sunglasses:

Yeh I thought I'd a good way to give back to the community. The countersunk are just aestetic. You use them as washer and they hide the screw and you can choose the color for them.

It's true. I actually used them with a rubber washer underneath so basically you can secure the enclosure but still have a bit of play from vibrations.

Yea the countersunk washer. Do you have a picture of what it looks like mounted? Unless you also have a colored screw head, i still cant picture how the washer can hide the screw. Wouldnt it just be a colored ring around the screw head?

Yes exactly, it doesnâ€™t hid the head, you can still see the hex/cross but the washer has a cone on the inside so the countersunk screw fits into it.

Hi, I still have the modules thst requires to be flashed with stock HM10 firmware to work with Android 8.x.x and above, but no time to flash them. So if you need them for Android you Wil have to flash them with an Arduino follwiong the YouTube tutorial. I am sorry I can not help as in past, but I don't have time anymore :sweat_smile:
