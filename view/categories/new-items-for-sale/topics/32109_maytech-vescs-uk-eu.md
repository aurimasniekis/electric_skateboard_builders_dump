  I purchased these brand new, from Maytech for a project that has now been superseded (you know how that goes) I paired two them and tested them with 2 motors, went up and down the street, then left it in the corner of the man cave and did other stuff.

So they've sat there, the 2 I've tested are pair via canbus have xt60s connected, the others are still in the box
