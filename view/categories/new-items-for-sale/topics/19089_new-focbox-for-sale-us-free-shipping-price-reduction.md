why can't we change that? we have a large enough community with no really good way of organizing group buys (other than jlabs? i think that's a groupbuy?).  It would simplify everything massively and give us more exposure as a community.

not bad. Im in the market for 1 vesc-x and 120 is a good price for it. 

I would try to get on a platform for the time being to help you sell your stock.  Maybe the https://electric-skateboard.market/

I heard its closing down soon but maybe not.

Hey Guys,

So i got into contact with Jason and he basically broke down the rough interpretation as a re-seller for him. I will be the point of contact for any issues that may arise. There for it is up to me and me alone to handle any warranty claims. As far as that is concerned, I will provide the equivalent warranty as the original vescx. I will also test each individual vescx when they arrive into my hands to ensure QC, though i hear the vescx already has a good QC procedure. I haven't seen any update on my order yet but seeing as the us warehouse is showing stocked, I hope that i will receive my order sometime next week.

but if @yummyblobs did a bulk purchase or 51, the cost is lower, selling them for $120 is quite a mark up

I'm not sure that's "cool" if you know what I mean. Just wish it was a bit lower

Depends on how you look at it. 
He had to Put up the $4567 and he has to handle the orders and shipping and any warranty issues. 
This is a business venture for him so there has to be a profit to pay for his time and effort.
The price he is charging is still cheaper than you can get it from Enertion on sale. In my opinion the price is reasonable and if you buy 2 you get additional discount

Hey guys, so i just got a notification that they are sending the 51 vescs! Looks like I will be shipping around next week. The 120 and 220 prices are introductory only, after the first 30 or so I will have to raise the prices just a bit because shipping cost are a little bit higher than expected. after the first 30 units are shipped I will be raising the prices to $140 for one vesc shipped and $250 for 2 Shipped. So far i have 16 seem to be spoken for at the intro Pricing. Just PM and I will go by order of PMs and will cut off at approximately the first 30 units are sold.

Freaking whoa guys, all of the 30 special price vesc have been sold! Dang that was fast. Unfortunately the price must go up I cant keep this pricing up unfortunately. I hope that the ones that receive their vesc can vouch for my services. From now on the pricing for 1 Vescx will be 140 shipped and 260 for 2 shipped in the lower 48 States.

Aw man, I'm sorry but you just missed out I sold the last special price unit today. the new prices are 140 for one shipped and 260 for 2 shipped in the lower 48 states. I could possibly keep the prices low for ever and I'm sorry you missed out but on the bright side, I'm still the lowest price for a superior Vesc to the original 4.12 design.

It's relatively the same but with upgraded components to give it more reliability and heat disapation mainly. In essence, it is a 4.xx vesc though with the same ERPM limitation but with much higher build quality and comes with casing/headsink.

@I_sk8, the Vesc-x/FOCBOX is upgraded from diys vesc in many ways. Direct Fets, heatsink, upgraded BOM,Smaller form factor, and a hard plastic case to boot. Search around the forum for the vesc-x and youll see why its worth it.

Might be in for 1 pending when you get your next shipment.  Vesc is one of the last components I need for my first board.

Edit:  Count me in for 1 - I know you haven't gotten the shipment yet but I can wait a little while longer!  Seems like this will be the best price for one of the best vescs!

Just wondering how these SK3 perform compared to the blue R-Specs? I know the top speed SHOULD be higher since higher kv but still if anyone has had these, can you shed some light? Thanks!

Looks like the gravy train has come to a stop for me fellas, Enertion has started this new bulk re-seller program that isn't anywhere close as good as the bulk pricing it used to offer. Looks like I'm out of the reselling game, it was good while it lasted guys! I'm still taking care of the warranty side though so if you have any issues let me know.

That is true. Bulk pricing now is tough if you can't get to the 30 a month level. Then, it's ok.

Don't expect focboxes below like, 145 ever anymore. Cause the bulk pricing now isn't much less then that...

4.12 = entry level/price aka hobbyking

Modified 4.12 needs to be cheap or will not be able to stand up to  onsumer sesire for vesc6 and knockoffs.

I guess the really good discount had to go as it was canabalising b2p sales sucking up all the sales from here and other forums.

Vesc6 and derivatives from now on yeah, what is it onloop says about innovation or death?

the focbox design files were supposed to be open source but, as expected, enertion's removed the ability to download it:

Correct, we are now manufacturing in a new Shenzen factory that specializes in Tablet & Phone PCBA. Failures rates near ZERO! & Much faster production! 

To our suprise, We discovered they swapped some capacitors to upgraded versions not available from USA sources! we complained originally (because normally swapping means bad) However, after testing with very high-end lab equipment, we realised they were higher spec than our BOM.

Since the factory switch months ago, We have been able to keep up with demand for the first time in 2 years. The quality is great, Very Happy. Just ask anyone with FOCBOX, there are well over 1000 of them in circulation and very few reports of issues.

Our previous factory in the US had 18% failure rates in the last batch. Our last order was 1000 units & only approx 800 passed our QC process. Constantly behind schedule leaving us without stock & We simply could not continue with that yield. You probably remember the constant issue with had with supply.

Just remember, the country doesn't determine the quality, the Manufacturing Standards & QC process do.

My Vesc-x was likely made in the US. I bought it early on in preparation of the CarvOn V3 kickstarter build. When the V3 finally arrived one of the two vesc died with a DRV fault. Sent it in to the DRV Wizard...The problem was a solder bead that was left between two pins on the DRV chip and shorted them. Totally manufacturer defect but becuase I sat on it for so long I didn't seek replacement from @onloop hopefully the news ones are perfect as I need 4 of them once the two pairs of V4 arrives!
