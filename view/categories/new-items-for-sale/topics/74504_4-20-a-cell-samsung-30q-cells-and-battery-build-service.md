For those looking for 30q cells, I've managed to secure a decent quantity from nkon, through liion wholesale, at very good prices.

Both nkon and liion wholesale have proven to supply 100% genuine cells.

I'm selling them for $4.20 (hehe) a cell, that's 50 qty prices at imrbatteries or liionwholesale.  If you're looking for a large amount, more than 50 cells, you're probably better off getting it from them.

My prices are better if you need smaller quantities.

# Additional battery build service

## Parallel group build service

![image|690x352](upload://yq8WX8aSLkytlXcLEFnzuNfz4M5.jpeg) 

It's in the product description but the added service will combine your cells into parallel groups, using the following:

* 10mm x 0.15mm pure nickel
  * Rounded edges to avoid marring cap insulator
* Cap Insulator
* Fish Paper applied to positive terminals
* Spot welded with the [Boss Welder](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/boss-level-custom-spot-welder/25980/1229)
* Positive / Negative buss welded onto nickel, NOT PCB
  * Nickel to PCB copper weld is rather weak, so using nickel as the bus lends a lot more strength
* Hot-glued onto [Batt-PCB](http://github.com/akhlut/BATT-PCB)

Why the PCB?  Checkout @akhlut's wiki: http://github.com/akhlut/BATT-PCB/wiki

## Battery Pack Build Service

http://www.esk8life.com/battery-pack-build

**Only available with Parallel group build service**

Combines parallel groups into a complete battery pack.

Serial connections are made with 1/2 inch copper strand.

Main **+** and **--** leads with 10awg silicone wire.

Result of this build yields a flexible pack (to a certain extent), and more importantly, is modular so P groups and various components can be replaced.

You have the option of a serpentine or "U turn" configuration ([see product description](http://www.esk8life.com/battery-pack-build)).

Whole pack is covered in clear PVC shrink, and appropriate insulation applied using kapton tape, reinforced tape, and foam insulators.

Three feet of clear PVC shrink will be included in the package if you plan on installing your own BMS

**Optional**: Select "Perform QA" to perform a discharge, then full charge, then discharge to storage voltage (3.6v).  Cell voltage will be measured at each cycle to ensure pack is in balance.  This option will add 3-4 days to lead time.

## BMS Install Service

http://www.esk8life.com/bms-install-service

**Only available with Battery Pack Build Service, and [purchase of a **_charge-only_** BMS](http://www.esk8life.com/bms)**

Installs BMS balance leads and BMS power connections.

BMS connections (P-, B-) are terminated with 3mm bullet connectors.

# How to Order

Let's say you need a 10s4p pack, want it built into a pack with a BMS installed.

1. [Add 40 cells](http://www.esk8life.com/samsung-30q-18650-cell), with the 4p build option selected, then add to cart.
2. Then add the [Battery Pack Build Service](http://www.esk8life.com/battery-pack-build)
3. Then add a [10s BMS](http://www.esk8life.com/bestech-d140-10s-bms)
4. Then add the [BMS Install Service](http://www.esk8life.com/bms-install-service)

**Please keep in mind these are demo shots using dead cells.  Your order will be made with BRAND NEW cells.**

# Q&A

### Who is this for?
The DIY builder who wants control of all aspects of their build, including the battery.  Because the build service is modular, you can order a little (bare cells) or a complete pack, and fill in the rest yourself.

### Who is this NOT for?
If you're looking for a complete build, or want a fully integrated solution, this probably isn't a good fit.

### Does this include battery / volt meter, connectors, and/or switch (loopkey, anti-spark)?
No, you will install those things yourself.

### Where are the fuses?
Pack fuse is not included, but you can install one pretty easily.

I don't believe cell-level fusing is appropriate for low P count batteries (chaka's probably going to kill me).  Cell-level fusing makes sense in massive parallel packs but not for smaller packs with high discharge demands.

I may consider cell fuses, but will likely incur an additional cost as it's much more labor intensive.

### Anything other than 3P or 4P?
No, not at this time, sorry.

so you can order just the P groups and arrange it however it fits in your build.

but it is limited to either 3 or 4 cells across.

and to make it flexible i cut slots into the final pvc wrap, then you get flexibility between the P groups.

not right now.

5p as a flat pack tends to be an awkward fit in most enclosures so didn't go for it.

one could easily build a 5p pack without the pcb backing though...

yes, the nickel gets welded onto the pcb copper.

but...it's a weak connection.  it only takes little force to pry the nickel off the pcb.

but that's ok because the nickel to nickel weld is super strong.

@Pedrodemio let me double check, international shipping is based on canada. Shouldnt be much more though, if any.

Can you confirm the total length of a fully assembled pack with BMS service of a 10s 3p and 4p pack. Trying to decipher between the two options.
```

---
## \#42 Posted by: thisguyhere Posted at: 2018-11-21T18:45:20.608Z Reads: 235

```
sure thing.

take the length of each cell: (65mm) + width (18mm) + (height (18mm) + 2mm pcb thickness).

multiply by 3p (3 * 18mm) or 4p (4 * 18mm).

multiply that by (S count / 2) to get length, and 2 * 65mm to get width.

so, 

1s3p module is 65 x 55 x 20mm
1s4p module is 65 x 72 x 20mm

putting it together

10s3p - 270 x 140 x 20mm (10.6 x 5.5 x 1")
10s4p - 360 x 140 x 20mm (14.25 x 5.5 x 1")

then on top of that add 5 to 10% additioal to each length so it's a nice easy fit inside your enclosure.

it's up to you where to place the bms.

i'll add this to the product description.

i don't place it anywhere, it'll just be included in the package.

it'll be wired so you can connect it to the pack, but it'll be up to you where in your enclosure to mount it.

i don't like mounting to the pack because it heats up.

i usually mount it next to the pack, like here

yes, it would be very expensive.  shipping cost goes up very quickly when the weight does.

but what you can do is source the cells locally.

then i can sell you the remainder of the parts, ie pcb, bms, copper strand, pvc wrap, etc...  these things are light, i just got a quote for pcb + bms + nickel strip shipped to EU for about $25.

i will have to find a better shipping method because the US post service it's $65 to ship.

this is based on 40 cells (10s4p).

don't know who, but i'm sure there are EU builders who can do something similar.

or...i can send you all the bits to make a pack like this, but you'd have to assemble it yourself, or find someone locally who can spot weld and solder it together.

@thisguyhere Thinking about getting another new battery. Do you do 10S5P's? Notice only 3-4P on your site. If you do, will you let me know the price with all the bells and whistles (BMS, batteries, testing, ect...) out the door. Going to try and sneak this one by the wifey. ;)

I want to ask you, if each battery samsung have 15a how the mbs support all baterries for example a package 123p?

12s3p= 45a

in this case I need 3 BMS one foe each package in parallel?

i don't have any PCBs for 5p.  if you can wait, i can get them made, it'll be about a one week lead time for it, i think.

otherwise, it'd be made without the PCB, which should work just as well, just need some more insulating is all.

nope, that's not how it works.

once you connect 3 cells into a parallel group, you can then consider that P group as a single battery.

the bms will then balance each P group.

hope that made sense.

[quote="evoheyax, post:1, topic:26010"]
**Parallel vs Series**

Theres 2 configurations of cells. Parallel and series.

[ ![|400x200](http://www.12voltbattery.info/images/content/batteryWireDiagram.jpg) ](http://www.12voltbattery.info/images/content/batteryWireDiagram.jpg)

Parallel means negative to negative and positive to positive. The result is two cells become essentially one. They will automatically balance each other out to the same voltage. Parallel config doubles the Ah, meaning you’ll get more range.

@thisguyhere 

So based on your post #40 for measurements, width is 140mm. Hummie's deck is 140mm wide as well. I figured there should be at least a 10% buffer between the two. Will 12s4p work on this deck?

140mm is a pretty aggressive measurement.

i'm running a hummie deck now with the same pack, fits nice and snug, shouldn't be a problem:
