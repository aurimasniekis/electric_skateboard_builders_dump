BesTech has an MOQ of two on this BMS that I want, but I really only need one.
Anyone else interested in saving on shipping?
It's $40USD per BMS plus $33USD shipping to me, so I'd sell to a fellow Canadian at $60USD shipped (to cover shipping to them afterwards).
(U.S. buyers are also welcome, but shipping will obviously be more).

10S 80A BMS with E-Switch

Hey, 

I bought it but I don't think I will use it. I'm in Banff if you would like to buy it from me. It's still new and has the connector cables too. 

Drop me a PM if you like.
