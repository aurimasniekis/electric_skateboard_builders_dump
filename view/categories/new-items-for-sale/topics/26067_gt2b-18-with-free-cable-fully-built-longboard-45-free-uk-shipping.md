Do you have the enclosure mounting inserts and bolts?

Afaik there were different versions so not sure what they are

When I purchased it diddnt come with mounting inserts and bolts but I bought some so could throw them in free for you.
I have a 10s3p and two vesc's in mine I think maybe you could squeeze a 10s4p in.
If your building a battery "10s4p" without spacers and in the grooves "40" there's ample room for 2x vesc's.

Yeah I'd have to think about this as was planning a 12s3p or 4p, I had seen pics of space cell and seems as you say no spacers

Ok no worries,I actually fit 80 cells in one of these once,stacked them up! it just means the seal wasn't touching the board so I carbon fibre wrapped it to make it waterproof!
Now i have a 10s3p because the other was way too heavy and tbh 30+mph is more than enough and can squeeze 15-20 miles out of it!

I'm sure a bit of flex would be ok as it's plastic.. just nothing drastic!
