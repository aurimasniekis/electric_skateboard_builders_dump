hi guys, im selling this because its honestly just too much for me to handle now in the school year. I was planning on building an electric scooter but I cant. Ive taken the shrinkwrap off the package, but everything else is still attached. For shipping ill insulate the pack and re wrap it for you if you would like. Ill sell it for 200 but you'll have to pay for the shipping.


hopefully someone wants it :)
