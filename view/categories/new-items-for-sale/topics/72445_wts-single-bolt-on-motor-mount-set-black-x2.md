Hi all,

I would like to sell two [](collections/electric-skateboard-motor-mounts/products/single-bolt-on-motor-mount-set-only-black) motor mounts. They are new, unopened and never used. I don't have time on my hands for my build so one of you may have this at a decent price. Looking to sell tem as a pair. PM me your offers.

Looking at a price point of 50 bucks or higher.

Regards,

RedEagle

Point taken. You all know how much it costs new. The reason I didn't include a price is because I thought it might sell slower if i set the price too high. With that said, I wouldn't want anything lower than 50 bucks.
