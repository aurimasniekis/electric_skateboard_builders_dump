That's a pair or a single truck you're selling ? You should specify in the title 1x or 2x (I mean : a pair at 33â‚¬ is sick, a single truck at 33â‚¬ no fucking way unless precision type)

it says a "truck" so only one.

And in @stormboard1 s defense, it is a fair price. You can buy a pair for 81â‚¬ from DIY delivered to Europe so theoretically he could sell it for 40.5â‚¬ and it would still be fair.

True I was a bit carried away, no way to find a CNC truck for this price either. Wish a fair sale !
