Good day!

I was purchasing spare parts at Evolve and a friend asked me to buy a GTX deck with an enclosure for him but backed out.

I payed $150 for the deck, $50 for the enclosure, $17.48 for shipping and $14.50 as taxes. 

Wanna grab it for $230 shipped within US?

EDIT: here is a picture.

True, it's at a forwarding company, so this is all I have. !

They don't have it on their website, you have to write an e-mail to them asking for a custom invoice.

I'm interested in the enclosure only. Would you sell it by itself?

Why dafuq would you pay 3$ for a photo of some generic evolve stuff?! Did you post this in facebook groups and reddit?

It's at a forwarding company where they charge you for everything, and I want people to see that I have it and it's new. Oh and also cause I have a sad life.

you know it! home of the infamous Florida Man. And a couple of decent esk8 companies as well. 

Hang on to it for me, i can probably get it next week. I just spent a wad of cash on motors remotes and t-shirts, but i expect more money will arrive this week since people just can't stop ordering shit from me for some reason. 

i'll probably get some second hand GT trucks and some UNiK 63mm evolve mount plates and run my own motors on there with some big fluffy ABECs. Eventually. After i build my RedEmber Chasm with these new Boa Constrictors JED sent me.
