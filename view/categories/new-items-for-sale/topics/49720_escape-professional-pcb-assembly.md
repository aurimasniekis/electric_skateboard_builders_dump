I really want to take the ESCape to the next level and I am a bit bored of making it myself. So want a professional pcb assembly which will result in a faster, bigger batch and also cheaper.

For this I would need at least 100 made, now if there is interest we could make this happen.

At this point I am still looking for the right factory and I'm not sure about the final price, but i want it to be between $160-170 (£113-120) for a complete unit without shipping.


**Do not** send any money yet, this is still in an early stage and the final design of the housing might be different (or not) to the current version.

I will update this with more info as soon as possible.

**How many units would you be interested in?**
[poll type=number min=1 max=10 step=1 public=true]
[/poll]


UPDATE:
Link to the original [ESCape topic](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/hw6-4-based-esc-escape/37579)

Google form: https://goo.gl/forms/VuL97RM8XgzCMWLA3

This ESCape will be identical to the ones I have been making with the exception of the nRF (wireless) circuitry not being populated.

Two options will be available: single and dual housing.
Single version will be similar to what you have seen previously: 
![single|471x500](upload://ufF5ytzLPNmSu41bzqljX6AuURK.jpg)

I will try to make it full aluminium housing if the quote I get is fair. Like this:
![single_full|593x500](upload://sPNojyJ0JyIS1E0c3MB1HV8eewg.jpg)


Dual will look like this:  (note: dual might have an increased value of £10 per housing.) 
![dual|352x500](upload://jbE236PtXrJ6Z9zHI1i0x6GZlFw.png)

Transfer of £85 / unit (**value that I will get**) now, then once I am ready to ship your units transfer the rest of the amount.

Transfer method: Transferwise: https://transferwise.com/

Very low transfer fee https://transferwise.com/pricing   and real exchange rates.

After you fill the form I will email you with the payment details.

If this does go through I would not use PayPal because they will freeze your account due to the large inrush of funds. I’ve seen this happen to a few companies, and they don’t release your funds until all of the customers have the product and don’t file a dispute for at least 30 days.

Unless I missed it from the original post, I didn't see a post associated with the specs of this board. I know it's probably the same or close to the other version.  However we keep having new users showing up to the eskate world so a spec list might help users decide.

Hello @stewii I would like to buy 1 ESCape. I can send you the money on wire transfer or BTC/monero. When will you be taking orders? 

On the paypal thing, they do this because scammers send themselves money and then cash out to offshore bank accounts and cancel the order. Or use tons of hacked accounts to buy their own non existent product. They lost a lot of money like this it's a flaw in the system

If there is trust and reputation there is no need for  buyer over-protection.

Hey @stewii, do you have any dimensions of this option? What does the height become with the added aluminium top?
Also what do you do with the connectors and wiring for PPM, Canbus, Uart etc. on this option?

I think it was for using the HW6.4 design for quadcopters or airplanes.  You could use it for anything you wanted, even on a skateboard.  I don't think standard firmware uses it at all, but if it was populated on the PCB you could write your own firmware and use it.

Hey so is Trampa now making a dual VESC 6 that can handle higher amount of power?

Hopefully they are innovating.  That's a much better direction to go than patent trolling.

What does the ESCape have for power max, like 60/240 or something like that?  I am pretty sure about the 60, so this would be amazing, one could run 14s without worry of frying something.

offtopic: that new vesc will power 1 motor. think about it 300A, so it is like 3 normal vescs put in parallel. Quite messy with so many cables but effective I guess. /offtopic


Single housing will be like the ones I have been selling but **black anodised!**

That dual enclosure looks absolutely perfect!  I just saw this today, and was wondering if you might be able to create a mounting plate like @kukug3lis made for his dual FOCBOX enclosure, but for this ESCape dual enclosure.  It would save so much space for batteries and would provide the best possible cooling for the ESCape's!

Since I just recently started running the machine I can’t promise more than 0.2mm accuracy for now but the machine is specced to 0.02accuracy and 0.005mm repeatability.

Stewii needs to know how many as this would be reflected in the final price, the price is an approximation but should be fairly accurate as that's what he's been selling them for self-assembled.

He's tired of self-assembly understandably so

Paid! Thanks for the good work, @stewii ! I hope there's a few bucks in for you. You deserve some!

I'm not sure where I need you to send it. I might live in a different country by the time the ESCs ship, and the shipping address might be not the one I entered into the form. But I assume since you anyway need the final payment, there'll be time to update the shipping address befor you send it out...

Paid for a pair.
If you want to pay for a couple with your debit card, you need to add a extra pound roughly, the system doesn't tell you this till the final stage and then will not let you go back to the payment stage you need to cancel the transaction. It forces you into using their propriety system?

They're focus is just on more important things at the moment. IOTA is still in its development phase, they cannot do everything at the same time. 
The foundation is working hard on so many things at once, but they know what they're doing and the concept is just brilliant. In a few years IOTA will be a word, that everyone knows. 
We just need to wait and support the developers as much as we can.
Sorry for my bad english tho.

I will send out an email to all of you who paid, which is about 2/3 of those who filled the form, but I can't make everyone wait for the remaining 1/3, though I will order a few extra units (for me and a very small stock to sell later). I will keep you informed here on this topic.

Thanks for the reply. Though I think it would be a nice option to have, I have changed my request from 2 to 1 ESCapes (by submitting a new form w/ a comment and paying through transferwise) since that submission, so there's no need to edit the design on my behalf.

as @stewii said earlier, the GB is closed, but he ordered some additional units that he will sell after delivering to those in the GB.

I don't think he confirmed the gb was actually closed. People have been sending him money longer after the official end date. His last post mentioned that only 2/3 of interested people actually paid, but he doesn't want to wait too long, that he would order some extra units, AND that he would keep us informed here on this topic.

Note his last post didn't say the GB was closed, that the pcbs were ordered and on their way. I simply want to know whether the units are ordered or whether he's still waiting for some stragglers so I can ETA my build.

This test batch came out perfect and now it is not going to take a long time till they make the remaining units.

The MOSFETs used are the automotive grade AUIRF7749.

Good point, but I'm pretty sure the components wouldn't get hot enough to re-melt the glue.
Also, doesn't RTV silicone have some corrosive properties?

I think both works :wink:
If the silicone is neutral cure it is not corrosive. I bought RTV but it's acetate cure which is not good for electronics.

But back to topic, I missed this group buy but whenever you have 2 units to sell @stewii  I'll take them :grin:

I'd say you're good if it's to be enclosed.

The ones Luke did have a flange to allow it to be partially exposed (half in/half out) of the enclosure for additional cooling and well cool looks.

In that application the anodizing helps with corrosion resistance & wear.

Just a quick update, the housings are on their way to the UK, should take only a couple of days more.

I have programmed with latest firmware and tested all the units and they all passed! 100%. Very happy with this PCBA.

I have upgraded the thermal pads and they perform much better.

Once I receive the housings I will start shipping the following day.
Final price is £120 per unit plus shipping.

Shipping cost (£):

2x ESCapes Delivered to Aus with a single dual housing.

I checked my mails and this was Andre's request.

"When I am ready to ship your units I will make another payment request of the remaining amount (assuming it will cost £115 per ESC: 115-85+shipping; or if dual housing was selected: 2*(115-85)+10+shipping)"

So no extra 10£ for the housing needed.

Sorry that I haven’t replied DMs yet. 
Good news is that the housings arrived, but realised that I need shorter bolts to mount the cover. 
Have done a thermal test with the dual version, both ESCs running at 60 amps, after 5 min FETs at 70C. This without any air flow helping cooling down the housing.

@stewii, I have the same question as @philvanzu, which you haven't responded to (maybe you missed it). Is it still possible to send the money with TransferWise? I personally don't have enough on my PayPal account and it gets a little more expensive with bad exchange rates and fees. It's not of course not a big problem, but I would still prefer doing TransferWise if possible.

Yes, Transfirewise is also OK.

Just thought of something if you guys planning flashing a new firmware with a stlink v2 do NOT connect the 3.3V (Vcc) wire, it can damage the 3.3V regulator.

Yes it is HW60, it comes with v3.38 and bootloader, but some people might want to try the ackmaniac firmware that's why I said not to connect the Vcc wire.

You´re right though, it´s a bit of a hassle, but i think it´s still easier, after all the initial struggle, to get everything organized. Today´s webshops really help you out with terms and conditions and everything. You just have to walk to the office and open a one man army company for a few bucks (Germany - don´t know how other countries handle that..)

Right guys, I am doing another GB round because I keep being asked if I have more ESCapes, which I don't.

Google form on the top of the topic is now open.

Round 2 is identical to round 1.

Price is set at £120 per ESC, plus shipping and transfer fees if applicable.

Amount is still split in 85+35 & shipping.
Preferred transfer method is transferwise but paypal is fine too.

Shipping cost (£):

                   UK        Europe           Rest of the world
1-2units----------------- 8 ---------------- 13 -------------------------------- 15
3-4units----------------- 8----------------- 15 -------------------------------- 20

Hey stewii, 

Sadly this is no joke! One of my escapes does not work. I did a motor detection on one ESC, no problem, everything works fine! 
I then plugged in the other one, no blue light!! The polarity of the cables is correct and just like the other one. It doesnt even want to turn on! Whats up here? Did it got damaged on transport? You said you checked every ESCape!

Do you have sensors on your motors? Same thing happened to me - 1 ESCape worked fine, the other no blue-led. When I unplugged my sensor wires on that, blue led lit up. Turns out my sensors on my other motor was borked.

@stewii: First, thanks for the ESCape! I received mine early this week, already tested it and it worked great.

I have a question and sorry if it's too noob. I have AS150 connectors on my batteries. To start with, I made a simple XT90 to AS150 adapter (since I didn't want to mess up with the ESCape) and that works fine. But, ideally I'd like to get rid of the XT90 since it's an unnecessary extra connection. Can I desolder the wires from the ESCape and solder on another ones or will that void my warranty? :smile:

There's some white glue in the case. I guess I can just carefully remove it with pliers to get access to the wires and then use hot glue as a replacement?

If you do this, it'll be easier to work at the XT90 end, not the pcb end.

I’ve also noticed this. A lot of good guys :) 

I would like deuscedown suggest to solder at the XT90 end to avoid all the hassle. I did make my own case for the escape and I fitted it in the housing with silicone. Shouldn’t be hard to take it out and put silicone back on it when installing.

Another thanks @stewii, received mine this morning.

I don't have a spare motor, or battery pack to play with, but the basics checked out ok.
![image|374x500](upload://3oM0CQY2ntP7WWJUg4uzfDTMJIh.jpg)

_Just the one gotcha. While the comm port pins are labelled in the same order, the male jst connector in the ESCape is around the other way to a VESC 6._  This means you can't just take a VESC 6 BT module for example and plug it straight into the ESCape. I guess you could force it in, but these connectors are only meant to go in one way. It's certainly not a big deal to switch the pins around, just something to watch out for.
![image|500x500](upload://cSxufrLJWfleS1e0MJ5cdO76DW7.jpg)

UART Baud rate was set to 9600 on mine, just in case others (ie; me) are wondering why/why not your BT module was not working straight away.

What does this mean for the metr pro module?@rpasichnyk 

Will I need to switch the pins around as well, or will this be fixed in the next batch?
@stewii

Or am I missing something and I need to research the vesc 6 bt module?

(Never heard about a vesc 6 bt module. Is there a specific one just for the vesc 6 by trampa?)

Funnily Trampa does sell a BT module for their VESC 6, but that's not what I was referring too. More-so just something that is designed to connect to a VESC 6 comm port may need some adjustments to fit the ESCape. You could argue Trampa has it the wrong way around :wink:

FWIW VESC 6 variants have an 8 pin jst connector, whereas VESC 4 variants have a 7 pin connector. I believe the Metr Pro comes with a 7 pin connector which will fit into the 8 pin fine. Ordinarily I'd say yeah you'd need to be careful plugging it in, but remember reading the Metr Pro has some 'magic' in it that lets it figure out what pins are what by itself. Please get confirmation on that last bit though, surely you'd need to make sure VCC and GND were right!?

Just to be clear, this cut out in the jst connector is what I'm referring too. The VESC 6 and ESCape have it on different sides.

Metr Pro only figures out TX and RX (if they are swapped), but has no way to figure if the whole connector is upside down. VESC6 has the same arrangement as VESC4.12. But why ESCAPE has it flipped? Is this for real or just wrong labeling?

Since this is flipped I notice that the other ports above and below will encounter the same problem then won’t it?

Solutions are to flip the wires in reverse order on the connectors or flip the white plastic on the board or for @stewii to fix it like on vesc 6 then?

LOL, that’s one way to fix it.

Suggest more practice, as Minim said it just takes a tiny flathead screwdriver and 5min. Go easy though, those little plastic tabs don’t like to be bent up too far. It helps if you push the wire in a little, lift the plastic tab, then pull the wire out with its crimped connector.

I ordered them from Digikey,

I also bought these terminals,

https://www.digikey.ca/products/en?keywords=455-2147-1-ND

And these crimpers.
https://www.ebay.com/p/Engineer-PA-09-Micro-Connector-Crimpers/710099147

But the crimpers took probably 2 months to arrive. I couldn't find them anywhere that would ship any faster. I originally ordered them from amazon.ca
You might have better luck with amazon.com though. I found them to be the best crimpers and they will last me for life. 
Digikey is quick, usually about 24 hours till I have stuff in my mailbox.

Went for a ride tonight, and 105 was my max motor current, and Battery was at 58 max current, with vesc maxing out at 37 degrees Celsius. I do have a pretty big aluminum heatsink case that I assume is helping. And I rode it pretty aggressively offroad, I'm also about 90kg and it had no problem with any hill I could throw at it. I was the limiting factor in most cases. And I could probably use some more padding for the many times it bucks me off!

There is a switch on the pcb. I assume its so you can use 3.3v and 5v sensors but I only used it in 5V. If the sensors are 3.3-24VDC operation voltage I assume it won’t work with the switch at 3.3V. I’ve never tested this so the best is to read up/test it yourself since I’m only guessing

put the black wire where the green one is and connect it to the maytech black
put the green wire where the orange one is and connect it to the maytech green
put the orange wire where the yellow one is and connect it to the maytech orange
let the white wire in place and connect it to the maytech brown
put the yellow wire where the red one is and connect it to the maytech yellow
put the red wire where the black one is and connect it to the maytech red.

Then you should be good I think...

No dice... I also remembered that this ESCape is from the 1st batch and the sensors are reversed so I also tried reversing the wires but still unsuccessful...

But let me see if I got this right...

On the Maytech Sensor:

Red = 5v
Yellow = Temp
Orange = Phase
Brown = Phase
Brown = Phase
Black = GND

Does that look right?

nope I think I remember green to be temp so maybe I mixed something up here.
The thing is my cable works and I figured out how to set it up by watching this schematic so maybe it will be more helpful.

Another thing is; the labelling on the ESCape is correct, even if the connector is reverted compared to other vescs, so trust the labelling.

phase wires doesn't matter so basically if you get red/black correct according to the escapes labeling then you can just throw on brown/orange on the hall connections and you should be good to go. Make sure you select 5V on the switch if your sensors are 5V.

@stewii  I didn't receive an email to complete payment but i just sent the remainder through paypal. I initally sent 100 GBP + 5% (105 GBP). I just sent you 35GBP + 5% (36.75GBP).
My order was for a single escape with housing with one extra single housing.

I also didn't get the email about the second payment, but not a big deal.  I just send the second payment for one Dual ESCape, plus shipping to the US.  Let me know if there's anything else I need to do.

Thanks!

I forgot to mention that both sensor and uart port are entirely in reversed order as opposed to the focbox. 
I’m sure this was mentioned already for the uart port but not so sure about the sensor port.
I tried hall sensor detection and it gave me an error and then I compared it to my focbox which made it obvious for me that they are in reversed order. 

Slightly bummed actually that they are reversed. I can’t easily switch parts this way between controllers. 

I have run them once now with speed drives and they work as they should for now. 

Thank you @stewii again.

## \#523 Posted by: goldrabe Posted at: 2018-09-20T00:21:25.672Z Reads: 236

It's a quite easy fix, you can lift those thin plastic bars on the jst hall sensor connector with a tiny screw driver or blade and pull the wires out to reverse plug them.
Sorry it's hard to describe with words i hope it's understandable.
Edit* No soldering or crimping required.

I think though i could be wrong as its assumption based , that the last group buy maybe it for now or possibly longer, what with it being crimbo soon and having a lot of units/customers out there already that maybe need repair/after services, i bet stewii is tuckered out. I haven't even powered up my two from group buy two up yet :pensive:

Edit... il also add i think he only did it to prove it was possible to make the esc 6 at a cheaper cost and had no intention of making it a full time job so to speak.

I asked stewii this question on Oct 8th and nothing do far. 
It looks like he is not interested in building more controllers.
Before you pull the trigger and buy the focbox give yourself a favor and read a thread about last big sale at Enertion. :roll_eyes:
