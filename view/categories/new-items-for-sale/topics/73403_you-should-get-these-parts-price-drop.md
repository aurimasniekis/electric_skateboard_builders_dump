Now that you're here, I'm guessing the title got your attention) I hate making these threads, but I just keep over-buying parts, or new ideas come in and I ditch the old ones, so I have these spare parts I won't be needing:

- Evolve Front and Back trucks with Riptide [96a cups]((https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/products/71509/riptide-cracked-ice-indy-pivot-cups)), an [93a barrels](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/bushings/70380/riptide-krank-barrel-longboard-skateboard-bushings-pack) [spoiler]**CHF220**[/spoiler] now **$200**

- Evolve AT wheels with 66T pulleys and bearings [spoiler]**CHF180**[/spoiler] **now $175**

- 42V 2a charger **CHF20**

- Chinese dual motor 10s ESC with a V2 remote (not for hub motors) [spoiler]**CHF40**[/spoiler] **now $35**

- Used set of Akasha Ahmyo 76mm wheels with Beasto bearings **Taken**

- Sensor wires x4 (Pitch 1.5mm to 2mm, 25cm length) - free with any purchase

Everything is still available, and you can have it all for just **$390**

Really nice wheels! These are the FR version, with a stone ground finish, so they are very slippery. But I do like them a lot

Hello, it's a small thing but I'm very interested in one of your sensor wire, the one on my motor is too small...
And you're from Switzerland too, it's perfect, I'm in Lausanne.
Would it be possible to take just that ?
Thank you ;-)
