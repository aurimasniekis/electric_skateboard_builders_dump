Hey guys it's me! I'm in the GB that @wmj259 but  I didn't want to wait on a gb for the smaller sk3 motors so I went ahead and bought a few for myself and to sell to other members. I only have 6 to sell off. I'm only selling them at what they cost me to get them to my door plus shipping to you. They are 60 bucks plus shipping. Give me a pm and we can set something up.
