hey guys as the title states looking to split the 200mm Reverse King Pin Truck Kit by SurfRodz.

this is ideal for someone getting a carvon drive as i’m ordering the widest hanger/axel combo making it 270mm when the carvon is 280mm iirc.

i planned on ordering the following specs:

- 70 x 10mm
- 45 degree
- cone/barrel
- hard
- color is up to you as long as they have it

lastly for price i just planned on splitting it in two so $160/2 = $80 i was going to call SurfRodz tomorrow and ask if they could split the shipment into two so i don’t have to repack it but if not then i’ll repack it and ship to you.
