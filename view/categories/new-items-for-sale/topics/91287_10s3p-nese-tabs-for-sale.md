I have 10 pairs of brand new 3P NESE tabs for sale. It's basically what's leftover from the 10S8P modules when I cut out 10S5P for my new board. I am offering the set at $30 shipped in the USA.

If you want, I can also print the boxes as per the latest design by Agnius(nese creator) in PETG if you don't have access to 3D printer. I'll have to check how much filament I'll use on one box to tell you the price, but basically it will be at cost. 

My print quality with petg looks like this:

Would you need to buy another full size tab to create the internal bus at the end of the pack?
