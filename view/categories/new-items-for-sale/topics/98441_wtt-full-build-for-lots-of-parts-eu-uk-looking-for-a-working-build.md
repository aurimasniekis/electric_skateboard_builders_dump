decided building isnt for me (for the moment) as everything i do just seems to go wrong or not work out

i have most the parts to complete a good build and the thread for it is here

![|20x20](https://forum./user_avatar/forum./halbj613/40/3962_2.png) [Thing1/ 1st(good)build /vesc6 /dual 6355 /12s5p](https://forum./t/thing1-1st-good-build-vesc6-dual-6355-12s5p/3079)

> So here is my first build and after looking at the steps I took from my first attempt to now…whoa. I would like to thank the whole community for helping me get this build together and allow me to create something like this. speacial thank to @tinp123 @Acido @Sender for telling me about glass frit and @BigBen hopefully this is not my last build and i will upgrade it soon … So as a 14 year old my money and recourses were slightly more constrained. Then after learning my lesson on buy cheap …

the parts are listed there and all are new or nearly new

…

i am looking to trade it for a working board

the conditions this board has to have is a large range, reliable and waterproof also preferably a longboard which looks quite nice and slick

i am based in the uk so preferably shipping from there i can probably ship to anywhere in eu via gls though

if you have anything which could be worthwhile then please say so looking for any half decent option

…

you will get all the parts listed except for the deck which is only worth around £40

the enclosure is for landyachtz 9two5 deck which you can buy

other then the build i have a bunch of spare screws loctite and other bits which can come with it
…

i am sorry to have to leave my build but everything just seems to be going wrong for me

not leaving the hobby just desperate to ride again
…

thank you in advance and please pm with offers

What isn't working on your board?
Where are you located in the UK?

I know you didn't ask for advice but life is like a box ovf.......

Maybe just buy a cheap used wowgo or meepo to get ya going,

Then chip away 30min a day at your build.
or try do small upgrades on the meep.
