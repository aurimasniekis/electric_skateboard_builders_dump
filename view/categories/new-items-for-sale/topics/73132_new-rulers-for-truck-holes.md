We have updated our New School and Old School rulers to tempered stainless steel. They are manufactured in-house. The rulers are for finding board center and accurately locating and marking holes for drilling.
The rulers have been really fun to figure out how to make. Laser cutting metal is a blast. 
I just retired from teaching so I now have time to work on new products. 3 more in the works coming.

Just did the same.

I found a flat tape measure at a woodworking shop that just isn't cutting it anymore!
