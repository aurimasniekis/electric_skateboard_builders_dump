the battery packs seem like a killer deal.
Anyone has experience with metroboards?
How's their battery construction?
Do they actually deliver??

They have the new MetroboardX recently out and have been around for a long time, not that I've ever bought something from them myself. I'm gonna guess these are the packs that were used in the old models, stealth or slim, something like that. And they're just selling off the stock since their current board is nothing like the previous.

With your Press Fit Abec pulleys it says.
*Compatible with our brushless outrunner models only!*
what is that about, are you using 3M teeth?

That's what you get from those blue wrapped battery packs from ebay, aliexpress. This is a ESK8 Manufacturer, they have common sense. I would hope.

metro batteries are blue - no relation

in the 15 mile Battery THIN they are a generic brand 2.2AH cells rated for 8C.  Despite being generic, they are good quality.

Oh damn, thanks for the info. I jumped to conclusions but left myself the possibility that they were non name brand cells.

@murdomeek You think its a good idea to use metros battery with the elfotys we got? Just worried about the 30/50 amps not being enough, and using 10s5p and do 30-40 amps per motor.

yeah probably not unfortunately :'(
I'll probably get a custom 30Q pack made with ~100a max discharge.  (Not that the eloftys will need it, but too go have in case I change drives in the future)

These batteries seem like a no brainer for the prices.

I still don't know a lot about DIY but these seem like a good investment for a stiff board.

I bought the "10 mile thin" 10S2P battery. It's 4.4AH. The BMS is rated for 30A. Pack is tiny, 2lbs. Gonna put it in a small build for my kids. Can't beat $100. Arrived the next day (I live very close to them)

Also anyone know if the metroboard motor pulleys fit on flipsky 6374 or 6384 motors?

## \#27 Posted by: Rick36 Posted at: 2019-10-03T12:01:31.556Z Reads: 84

Their motor pulleys have a 10mm bore and those motors likely have an 8mm bore.

Some of the FS motors can be had with 10mm shafts, but yeah, you gotta match the shaft to the bore.

Yea i saw option for 8mm and 10mm for the 6384 but the metroboard pulley looks like it doesnt have a keyway slot. (If im wrong let me know, just guessing off of the picture.) If it doesn't then i would have to get 8mm shaft with torqueboards motor pulleys. Speaking of TB pulleys, does the FS shafts have 2 flats spots to fit the TB pulleys?
