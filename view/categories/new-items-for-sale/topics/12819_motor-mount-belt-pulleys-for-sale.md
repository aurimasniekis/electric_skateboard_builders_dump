I have 5 of these kits in stock. If anyone would like to buy one there €45 in total and shipping around most of the EU is €8. Will be willing to send anywhere in world but shipping charges are down to you. The belt is 15mm wide which is quite wide but much more durable. 48 and 16 tooth pulleys.  Everything in the picture is what you get! <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/2/720fc323a087a4a02d3e999a8dbbfb93d04654cd.jpeg" width="617" height="500">

I wonder how well that motor mount would hold a 700g+ outrunner considering it's only held onto the truck/hanger with three grub screws? Does anybody have experience with this type of mount?

Also, would Caliber trucks need cutting in order to fit the 15mm wheel pulley?
