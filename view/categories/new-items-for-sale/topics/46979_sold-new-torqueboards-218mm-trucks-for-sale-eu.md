Thanks! Still new to this PayPal and must say they are quite expensive. And if they choose (decide to trust me) f&f it's without that fee right?

@Kug3lis checking right now but few of these already :)

I dunno, 11 days on the forum.  

I'm sure you are going to ghost some people and run away with your 70 euro and abandon this addiction.  Maybe head to South America, get a new name. Start a new life. I can see it already.
