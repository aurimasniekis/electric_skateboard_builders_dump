May be too flexy for single enclosures. You could buy 2 smaller ones though

Is the 405 enclosure 7 1/4 from outer lip to outer lip or that's how wide the actually storage compartment is?
```

That's the internal measurements. You're deck would need to be 9 1/2" minimum width

You could trim the flange down where it overhangs. Or you could look at all of the other enclosures on my site and pick one that fits. Outside of those two options I could make a new mold for you?

Usually I charge 80 for a custom mold. I'm doing the sale though...I will do it for $65 if you want a custom "405". That mold will take me a few days to make though.

Edit-
Cost/Time on a custom is too much to discount. Customs will remain $86 shipped

These enclosures are awesome, I have a split low pro and a monolith. Both of which I worked with @psychotilller to modify for my build, so you are in good hands and will find a sick solution no doubt!

How wide are the flanges?
```

---
## \#18 Posted by: psychotiller Posted at: 2016-12-01T01:44:28.855Z Reads: 181

```
About 3/4", but keep in mind that the enclosure isn't square with perfectly vertical walls. I give internal dimensions using the internal usable space. That doesn't count the space inside a sloped or angled sidewall. I have to give you cubed dimensions so you can judge length/width/height. Then before I can add any character/shape to a mold I need to know what the overall footprint we have to work with is.

What kind of battery are you using? How many ESCS (what kind) Any other components you want to fit in there?

It's diys 6s4p measures 14" by 6" I need one at least 16 in long and 6" wide

## \#21 Posted by: psychotiller Posted at: 2016-12-01T02:13:49.874Z Reads: 163

I can do that. The 405 is 22" long Would that have been too long for your board?
```

I actually think the 405 you have will fit perfect. Will just need to trim the flanges. Just needed to know if I would still have enough material to work with

Hi, my man.  I purchased the 405 enclosure a couple of days ago.  Will it ship this week ?  Also is it possible to make it flat rather than with the stripes on the bottom ?  Thanks man, your enclosures are the best.

Use this:

The enclosure will fit well to almost all deck shapes. The weather seal is a great touch though for water resistance,
