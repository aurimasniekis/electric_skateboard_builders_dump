(UPDATE!!! The 4WD motors will have a 20mm bigger stator giving a massive torque increase.
a stator based on the 80100 outrunner communally used for Ebikes.
but the ETA will be increased to 1st week of August for this model unless you wish to continue with the smaller motor) 

First ever 4WD KIT

$1000 +free shipping

ETA 1st week of August

These Motors are the best option for the lightest, quickest and pleasing to the eyes electric skateboard kit you could ever buy.

At 107mm the wheel is perfect for high speed and smooth rolling. Being one of the fastest kits on the market.

Included:

Lol what a monster. You'll need a monster battery or you'll have no range?! @jacobbloy have you had time testing it out? (torque, hill climbing, speed, etc)

im not rick enough to give you a referral link.

but the 107mm thane can not work unless you have 4WD.

@mostwanted all my pricing is in USD as i might have ad only 2 AUS customers the market it international.

@karma range isn't effected so much unless you are doing crazy hills, the watts required to push you will be the same no matter how many motors you have unless you decrease the torque,it will just mean increased torque faster top speed, and hill climbing increase.

You can only use 107mm in 4wd so it's best to by my kit, the price includes trucks but this is a small part of the price and can't be removed. You can put the motors on your trucks though.

Do the 2wd hubs alone not have enough torque for the 107mm wheels? Is that why they won't work?
```

a bigger wheel requires more torque. i don't want sell a crap product and the torque of the 83mm wheel is perfect so increasing it to 107mm will reduce the performance, where the 4WD will still provide more torque then the twin drive.

Hey guys so the 50km/h is for 10s Using 12s will bring the top speed up to 62km/h maybe even 71km/h on a full charge.

Hi Jacob,
what would you recon to using 6s on the dual drive system? Or do you think ill be better off with 8,10,12s?
Also would you consider doing a combo kit with vescs for those that have already ordered the dual drive system?

Big boys for sure, can wait an extra week or two (but save some summer here for me in NYC!). Please check and confirm my order made it through the website, it froze a few times with the spinning eyeball loading icon and I didn't want to order 5 sets so left without a super solos confirm.

Also can you post or email me specs for the larger stator motor, looked at 80100 details but there were several versions kv etc. Thanks!

I'll be winding them to 70kv for a good high top speed really should be 50kv.

It will more resemble a rotomax 50cc but the rotomax is the new version of the turnigy 80100.

What will you do to dissapate heat?
In the other thread you mention this is for the 83mm hubmotors and has a max rating of 8s 40a, why so low? 
Assume you will increase the size for the bigger hubmotors?

Pretty exciting stuff man, would never have thought to hide the vesc in the hub itself.
```

## \#30 Posted by: jacobbloy Posted at: 2016-05-31T22:19:07.354Z Reads: 328

40a for my 83mm hub motors is way plenty!

This will not fit internally inside the 83mm but it will in an end cap but in the bigger motors it will fit and heat will not be a problem at these currents in such a big motor. 

It's about size, 8s still give you 30km/h.
But the mosfets that I'm using are very low resistance so heat will be low and they are also a lot  thinner and smaller.

The mosfets are rated to 40v so if you charged your 10s space cell to 95% 39.9v you would be fine. I could still use a 50v MOSFET but the jump in resistance is a lot.

All other componants are rated to 50v compared to the original vesc's 63v

Will your bigger motors use a higher voltage/amp vesc?

These might work better on a Hummie hub or Carvon since they have a stationary end.  The Jacob Hubs are full hubs, meaning that it would have to fit inside and be able to deal with he elements.

I love the concept, let's see some in the field!

Yeah, I bet.

How do you plan to affix it to the motor? Are you transitioning from a dual end cap to a bell design with a single fixed end cap? Makes sensors easier too.
