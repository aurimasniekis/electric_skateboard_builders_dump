Hello builders:
At last I was able to fulfill all Black Friday orders a couple of weeks ago, at last :sweat_smile:, so I have some time to start making new projects that might help builders to finish their builds in a no time.

At the moment I have one semicomplete ebox in stock for inmediate shipping in order to be used on a Trampa Build such as this one:

+1 for vhb - the stuff is designed to hold underwater too - very sticky,  very strong and I use it everywhere (it's what they put on car trims to permanently attach)
