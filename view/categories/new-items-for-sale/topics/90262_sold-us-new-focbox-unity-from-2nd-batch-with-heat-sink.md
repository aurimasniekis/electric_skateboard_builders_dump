New never been mounted or plugged in FocBox Unity with heat sink.  I was gathering parts for a new build and have had something come up and need to sell.  I will only ship inside the US. I would like to sell together so I will knock off $20 bucks if you buy both.  Don't wait for the next batch buy mine.

FocBox Unity: $280 shipped
Heat Sink: $60 shipped

Both: $320 shipped (save $20).

I had two buyers contact me through PM at the same time one was willing to buy both the other wanted to buy just the Unity.  I am sorry if anyone feels like there was any unfairness.
