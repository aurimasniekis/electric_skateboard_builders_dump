(this is a copy from another thread, sorry for the possible confusion)

Dear all,

finally, the second bigger batch for the CNC machined rims has arrived. They come in 4 different flavours:

**- sandblasted and black anodised (matte)**

**- sandblasted and red anodised (matte)**

**- sandblasted and blue anodised (matte)**

**- sandblasted and silver anodised (shiny)**

(The colours may look differently under different lighting conditions, but colours are as per below pictures)

Here are some points that I would like to highlight:

* this batch is bigger than the first one but not massively big and stocks are limited. The next big batch (batch number three) will be ready by mid January 2019
* we are always supportive of group buys, but can only arrange them for the next batch mid January. We can always discuss pricing depending on the order qty.
* for group buys of min. 15 sets ( 1 set = 4 wheels), we can arrange custom anodising.
* the website will be updated Wednesday-Thursday and the cost per set will be the equivalent TWD 6600,- which is about USD 213,-
* when purchased from the website, free shipping will only apply with a total purchase amount of the equivalent of USD 300,- and above. For this you would need to use the code ‚Äú  **FREESHIPPING**  ‚Äù a the checkout.

=======================

For members of this great forum, I would like to offer a special discount (which will not be displayed on the website):

**The offer is:**

* 1 set of complete Bergmeister pneumatic wheels incl. bearing spacer and extra 35mm bolts and nuts (that can be used to attach your own pulley)
* 1 set of extra inner tubes for the Bergmeister pneumatics (1 set = 4 inner tubes)
* 1 set of 90mm Senor Pepe wheels incl. bearing spacer (1 set = 4 wheels)
* 1 set of 6pin JST esc connectors (1 set = 2 cables to be used on a dual motor setup)

**- Free shipping**

**- USD 285,- // TWD 8800,-**

=======================

**Please take note of the following:**

* this offer is strictly limited to this current batch and only while stocks last. A certain number of Bergmeister sets will be reserved for the Haggy Drive System 2-in-1
* basis first come first serve // this offer is valid for one single order
* as mentioned before, this offer will not be published on the website and is exclusively for members of this forum
* If you are interested, please send me an email to   **[timo@wertrimo.com](mailto:timo@wertrimo.com)**  with your username in the forum, the preferred rim color, full contact details (name, address, phone number) and your PayPal account email.
* An invoice with a payment request will be sent to you.   **DO NOT**  use ‚Äúfriends and family" when paying via PayPal. I will cover the fees and this serves as your own protection.
* Upon receipt of the funds, shipment will be arranged within 1-2 working days and I will then send you by email the tracking number (EMS courier) as well as a copy of the postage payment receipt

=======================

**Compatible pulleys for the Bergmeister pneumatics:**

* you can download here ([https://haggyboard.com/products/universal-60t-adapter ](https://haggyboard.com/products/universal-60t-adapter)) a free .stp file for a 60T // 15mm wide universal pulley compatible with the Bergmeister rim. Feel free to modify (and share) this pulley to fit your needs.
* **@Riako**  has done some great modifications to this pulley, also for use with chains. I am sure he will be happy to help in case you got questions, so am I. If there is demand for a preferred pulley design, we can arrange to have it either injection moulded or CNC milled in the future

=======================

We are always happy to get feedback from the community. Our tire maker INNOVA here in Taiwan has been extremely helpful and cooperative and for the future we are also looking at making the same tire style, just with different compounds. So plenty of things to come in the future.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Timo (@riverside.rider)

Quick question: I'm thinking about using pneumatics for the first time... Can I use those tires with caliber trucks or will there be wheel bite ? :slight_smile:
```

## \#3 Posted by: mmaner Posted at: 2018-11-27T16:37:50.968Z Reads: 358

depends on the deck, its a combination of the deck overhang and wheel size that determines if wheel bite will be an issue or not.

Not sure, but it looks unlikely. You might make it work with risers though.  You typically need a deck with moderate to large cutouts, something like the Landyachtz Evo.

I'd be surprise if those will work with no wheel bite.
I have a similar deck.  Even with torque board trucks which are wider then standard caliber I was getting wheel bite on wheels that are much smaller.  You'd have to really go nuts on the riser for it to work.

Like @mmaner said.. Evo Landyachtz is a popular choice.  Haggy also sells his own deck and trucks, might be worth a look ;)

I have that deck, needed the biggest riser I could find out of a shop, for my weight not to cause wheel bite on 90mm abec. (so I also run my trucks very stiff due to that)

Hello @Mich21050 , for reference, I have put some Bergmeisters on a standard Caliber truck. There will definitely be wheel bite even on a deck like the Bustin mission. I am not a big fan of risers, but of course this is personal preference. In the below pictures you can see the Caliber in comparison with the Kahua truck. I am sure that an excellent alternative would be @torqueboards 218mm extended trucks. 
I am sending @skunk tomorrow some test pulleys for his surfroadz, so this could possibly be another alternative for pneumatics. But definitely be careful going pneumatics with standard trucks.  

let me know if you have any questions.
Timo

hi there @humanisticnick: yes that is correct. the reason is that there was quite some interest in the trucks without the motor mounts so that they can be used for custom direct drive / hub motor designs.
Another reason why the trucks are currently not sold with the mounts is that the mounts require a very specific motor shaft length combined with our pulleys. There are very tight tolerances so we thought it is best to offer trucks, motors, motor mounts and pulleys in one of two sets:

Haggy Drive System -- Street Senor Pepe
or
Haggy Drive System -- 2-in-1 Bergmeister and Senor Pepe

If you are interested in the Kahua trucks with motor mount, do let me know and I am sure we can work something out.

regards
Timo

Thanks to Timo's offer on the wheels, I jumped in and grabbed a set of red ones... 

I adapted the Bergmeister wheels to my geared drive which used to run the cheap AliExpress 6x2 wheels on my mini AT board...

I haven't had the chance to ride it properly yet but in the quick test I did it definitely has less rolling resistance. The build quality is also top notch compared to the AliExpress wheels...

Next step is to swap over to Haggy trucks instead...

On top of that the stock bearings are horrible...

Ok, i am just trying to learn and be able to have a decent Experience with my aliexpress wheels because I have them and I will not be able to buy a different brand for a long time. So if changing tires and bearings will help make them at least half as good as the more expensive ones I‚Äôd be happy. (To be fair I did not yet ride mine so I don‚Äôt know how good or bad they are compared to other wheels)

The biggest upgrade you can make to those wheels is the bearing, @ervinelin is on to something with that. Getting them out without a bearing press/extractor is interesting. You can use a vice and some ingenuity. 

The wheel itself makes a difference from a balance and weight perspective, heavier will give you less torque and wobbly will vibrate and slow you down, not to mention it'll chomp away at your belts if you are on belts.

That Ali wheel is really decent for the price though! Get some of those car wheel balance weights and put your wheel on the axel, spin it and balance it slowly until its smooth, that will go a long way. With that and a decent bearing upgrade they will feel like new wheels.
```

I agree, for the price u can't complain... However the bearing upgrade can cost a fair bit (not standard skate bearing) and swapping the bearings was a real pain.

I had to hammer out the old bearing (some were rusty) then grind down the bearing seat because the replacement bearing refused to fit.

Also, one of the inner tubes came leaking too... 

The hubs are also quite heavy so they affect the ride a bit. I also tried to balance them but never got them super well balanced.

So overall my impression of them was not good at all.

The Bergmeister wheels however are a totally different class in comparison...

The wheels I have are those linked by @brenternet we refer to them as the ‚Äúcheap ass aliexpress 6x2‚Äù

I think your tires should fit, this could be an easy upgrade until I can save enough to buy a set of good quality hubs like yours.

thanks @topcloud . there have been quite a few Bergmeister wheels sent out now and I am looking forward to some real life testing by all of you to see how they perform.
After Chinese New Year we are trying out some different formula for the tire (and possibly colors) to see if there is any major improvement.

@Riako has done a great 60T pulley design for the Bergmeister to make it compatible with torqueboard's sexy TB218. There are now some fine adjustments being made and I will update you once everything has been fully tested and is ready for download. I will also check to see if it is viable to have the TB218 compatible pulley CNC milled by the same company that does our heatsinks and Bergmeister rims.

@Maxid: Hi Daniel. I have not tried the 6x2 inch pneumatics from aliexpress. I actually ordered a couple but they were delivered to my old address. I will only be able to tell you mid-January.

one thing that I can confirm is that our tire works with the 6x2 inch aliexpress hubs...but that does not necessarily mean that these tires fit our hubs...

perhaps @12meterkuk @Skunk @ervinelin @nuttyjeff @DilatedPupils can chime in to advise?

If I get your tyres, would I need the tube as well or is that tube the same?

Good morning @mutantbass. I can only send you the pictures by January when I am back in taipei. But if I remember correctly, @Riako has some pictures directly comparing them. Let me follow up with him and then I ll get back to you.

[quote="riverside.rider, post:1, topic:76241"]
you can download here ([https://haggyboard.com/products/universal-60t-adapter ](https://haggyboard.com/products/universal-60t-adapter)) a free .stp file for a 60T // 15mm wide universal pulley compatible with the Bergmeister rim.
[/quote]

Anyone try this pulley? I printed one off to test (lots of supports needed). The recess where the screw heads or nuts should go, won't fit the socket heads of the screws that came with the hubs. The nuts don't have a chance. Perhaps the design is to have the screw/nut ride on top of the walls? I'll figure something out eventually.

@riverside.rider thanks for the great deal and amazing fast shipping, and for providing the pulley file as STP not STL.

Hi @deucesdown
Glad you received the wheels. Regarding the downloadable universal pulley. You are correct in that the nuts do not fit. The issue is the tolerance which cannot be achieved by a simple 3d print. We have had the pulley made by CNC milling (out of aluminum). With that pulley, fitting the nut was not a problem. 
Once I am back in Taiwan I will be revising the file. @riako was also kind enough to create a pulley (with integrated 608 bearing) that fits on the TB218 truck. We are currently having a few sets of them CNC milled out of POM and 7075 aluminum. I would have them in hands by January 6th latest and then I ll be doing some tests. Once all are ok, we will be updating the website for download as well as putting it on thingiverse (stl + stp format + technical drawings incl. all tolerances)
hope that helps. 
best regards
Timo

Well, just keep us informed on the metal pulleys, seems better to wait for those than to start printing

Any new updates on the 3D printed pulleys? Or even aluminum ones? I was close to pulling the trigger on 3D printing the file provided by the Haggy site but I am uncertain now.

Hi @Flashgod224 Charles , we have tested both Pom and aluminum 60t pulleys that work for tb218 and evolve gt. We need a little more time to test and fine tune the design. My strong preference is for Pom. Aluminum is just very heavy and provides not a noticeable advantage over Pom. 
Which setup are you currently riding (trucks and wheels)?

@deucesdown I believe @702vegas is talking about this one https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3250555

@riverside.rider I was using TB218 trucks and 97mm Flywheels, but now that I have the pneumatics incoming, I am going to drop through my hummie deck with the pneumatics. I was hoping to getting the 3d printed pulley down sooner (the file on your website) but I want to wait until there is something solid. I can only assume that the link I have from Thingiverse is an alternative but I want to see/know what you guys had in mind. I am impatient but hope everything is coming together Timo!

Yes everything will be coming together. Don‚Äôt worry. Did you see that @marcmt88 offers some pulleys?  https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/pulleys-to-fit-bergmeister-pneumatic-wheels/81340
I have not yet tried them but they look very high quality and are made of Pom.

Damn, did not see them actually, they look really really good. My 3D printing guy makes some really high quality prints with nylon, was hoping it would be just as good :/ Guess I will wait for your file or order from marc. I just appreciate a good looking pulley like yours lul
