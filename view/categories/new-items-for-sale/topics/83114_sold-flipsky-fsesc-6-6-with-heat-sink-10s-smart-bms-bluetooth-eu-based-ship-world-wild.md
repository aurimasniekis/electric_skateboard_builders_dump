Hello folks,
Selling these two items, since I was planning to make an electric scooter but new projects stole my mind :laughing:

- **One single FSESC 6.6** with **heat sink** and possibility of **antispark button**. I use two of them with my 12s build and they work really good. Only downside to me the volt meter inside. I usually get 1-1.5V less then the real one on 12s. You do not feel it while riding, I just set my cutout 1V lower and so far so good. For the rest it works well.
Here the product page
https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products/products/flipsky-fsesc-6-6-based-upon-vesc%C2%AE-6-heat-sink
Asking **110Euro + shipping** (Not tracked one is like 8 Euro WW)
The VESC is new, never touch it actually.

- **10s Smart BMS**. It has **60A** discharge and **bluetooth with App** and **PC connection** to check the status of your cells in series. You can then program it to balance the cell ecc. It's really nice to me. I paid 50 Euro. https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10S-60A-active-bms-2017-new-Li-ion-smart-bms-pcm-with-android-Bluetooth-app-UART/32827750823.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dEdixsc
Asking **40 Euro + shipping** (Not tracked one is like 8 Euro WW)

Of course you can also come and pick it up, I am in Belgium.

Thx,
Ciao ciao

Hi @rey8801 !

I'll take the BMS, I'm in France and I'm willing to pay the 8 euros to have tracked shipping.
I'll send a PM after lunch for the details. 53 euros with tracking to France, correct ?

Hi! No 8 euro is the not tracked one. I will check how much is it the tracked. Anyhow they use the same service. It's just that one doesn't have the tracking number.

Ah okay, sorry it was indeed written, my bad...

I'll wait for the final price quoting (including tracked shipping to France) and will confirm you my order after that.

Well if I have to go that low probably I will keep it in case one of mine breaks. For the moment they go strong. The guys from US don't have to pay taxes on it. I got it from a GB but still paid more than them. If you order it now from Flipsky is way more that what I am selling it.
