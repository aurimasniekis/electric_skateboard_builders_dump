Hello,

I'm buying some remotes for my e-board. Since it's quite hard to get these remotes at a good price I decided to order more. 
Still, don't know the final price since it still has to pass customs, it will probably be about €45 + shipping per set (remote & receiver)
I'm located in The Netherlands

Some facts about the remote: 
Freq: 2,4ghz
800mAh battery
Mini USB charging style
2 different ride modes

Here's a review: [http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/what-remote-should-i-buy/11720/62](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/what-remote-should-i-buy/11720/62)

Please let me know if you want one :smiley:

Edit : Shipping costs EU, 4-7€

Im kinda curious about the reciever part, it doesnt look like a standard reciever / reciever cable. How is it plugged in, you have to split it or ?

I ordered one off here US and Canada people or anyone else really. Shipping is free takes about 1-2 months. By the time this thing goes through why not just order from here.  There always on "sale" and you can use a $5 promo code for first time buyers. Then use giving back assitant to get 6% back on top of that. Works out to like $45 USD.

Because i might get it cheaper. 

I can get the remotes for 36$ each shipped in bulk. However if this is the case import will add another 24% to it. Also there might be some other troubles that bring up the price. So i calculated: 36 x 1,25 = 45. 

Maybe, maybe the supplier could do custom orders and ship them individually from China to each person. With this you would escape import costs because the order is <€150,- . 
But if I would handle all the maximum price would be €45,-

When it arrives, today or tomorrow it's going through customs. They will make a bill and then it will get send to me. I expect it to arrive by thursday or friday. 

For now, I calculate the costs, 36$ * 1,25 = 45$.
The tax systems are really unpredictable that's why I'm calculating 25% extra atm. 
Also, @fedestanco told me:  In reality, shipping companies will always let you pay tax because they don't care about the value you write on the package.Instead the ESTIMATE the value by themselves.

Check PM! 

I've tested one remote for 20km's. Acceleration curve is diffrent than the mini. Took me 5 minutes to get used to. Binding procedure was confusing but takes some reading. I can bind the remotes if you like. 

Overall i prefer this remote way over the mini remote, its more compact, throttle range is very nice (gonna try it soon in Watt control), easy charging and 2 ride styles!! 

For those interested, I could ship them out tomorrow.

[quote="Mark, post:30, topic:19419"]
2 ride styles
[/quote]

In my opinion the low speed mode is not really usable for adults, because it's  only 10 - 50 - 70 (Brake - Neutral - Throttle. Normal mode is 0 - 50 - 100 on Vesc display. The beginner mode is too weak for adults at least with my board (2 x hubs, 10s) maybe it's good for kids. Beside of this the benchwheel remote is great. I'm glad to have VESC Monitor for to adjust the VESC on the road.

Yeah one of mine was broken on arrival and the second one worked fine until my board was charged. So felt like a bad batch or something as it seemed to break when the voltage got higher. : /

Ik ben al een tijdje op zoek naar een community in Nederland voor esk8 om meetings en rides te organiseren. Tot nu toe weinig mede liefhebbers/eigenaren van elektrische skaterboards gezien. Ik heb daarom een facebookgroep gemaakt om zo een Nederlandse community te creeren en leuke dingen te organiseren zoals meetings enzo. De facebookgroep heet Esk8 Nederland voor als je het leuk lijkt ;)

EDIT: Translation by mods: I have been looking for a community in the Netherlands for a while esk8 to organize meetings and rides.
