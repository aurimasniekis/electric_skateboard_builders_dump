Hi everyone,

I've got a bunch of **new** belts which I no longer need. I bought them for my old setup and ended up ordering a load of size options because I kept changing my motor/wheel pulley etc.

Anyhow, here's what I have:

* 2 x 15mm 5M-265 - Trans-flex
* 2 x 15mm 5M-275 - Trans-flex
* 1 x 15mm 5M-280 - Medway
* 3 x 15mm 5M-285 - Trans-flex

Good quality belts. I used them for about 8 months and didn't have any rips etc.

£1 per belt plus shipping. Dirt cheap!

Cheers,
Dan
