Stealth motor mounts - very strong produced in steel and aluminum.

-Black anodized aluminum brackets.
-Black powder coated steel motor plate.
-Split clamping and dual screws to ensure maximum clamping strength.
-Fits caliber truck.
-Fully adjustable.
-For 63mm motors.
-Stainless steel hardware with Torx bolts. 
-Suitable for 265mm belts. Tested with 9 and 12mm wide belts.
-Center to center distance is 70mm.
-3D printed belt cover available.

Pricing:
Motor mount 29.90 â‚¬ + shipping.
Motor mount with 3D printed cover 34,90 â‚¬ + shipping.

Shipping:
Europe
Motor Mount only sent as letter (no tracking) 8 â‚¬ 
Motor mount with 3D printed cover sent as letter (no tracking) 14 â‚¬

World
Motor Mount only sent as letter (no tracking) 8 â‚¬ 
Motor mount with 3D printed cover sent as letter (no tracking) 14 â‚¬

With tracking  shipping is 34 â‚¬ for Europe and world!
+ price for motor mount only / motor mount with 3D printed cover.

I will check with other shipping alternatives and update if I find cheaper solutions.

Please note, 3D printed parts will not have the strength of injected molded parts, the surface is also not great. To obtain a smooth finish like the pictures you will have to sand and paint the parts. 

I live in Norway so this will probably be most interesting  for EU esk8.

Thanks, the belt cover in the picture is for 83mm wheels. But I can print for other types as well like 90 mm or 97mm.
Takes a day or two to print and prepp the 3D part.I add a bit of epoxy on the inside to make it a bit stronger.
The mounts are in stock and ready for shipping.

I have updated the first post with shipping info.

@WSB you've got a PM

I actually went ahead and checked prices, DHL does not deliver private packages from norway, only the other way. At least thats how it looked like on their website.

And the norwegian post takes indeed ~30â‚¬ for a traceable parcel, which is kinda insane, but oh well... I still rather buy (somewhat) locally than waiting weeks for something from overseas that will be taxed heavily upon arriving.

Received mine today, nice contact with WSB and shipping was quick from norway.

Really impressed with the quality, the mounts are really nice and the 3D printed cover is super sturdy and nice looking even without putting on another finish.

Thanks for the feedback and support Extrapunkt and Hardwiring.
So cool for me to see the parts spreading throughout the world. I also wanted to say that the that the little profit I make from these goes straight into new esk8 projects. 

@Eboosted and @monkey32 one of those projects might be mounts for Ronins :slight_smile:
I have an idea of how to do it but it is going to be a more complex setup because  of the geometry, therefore more expensive. 
The other option is for me to machine some surfaces for clamping. But then you would have to buy both the mount and trucks from me.

Just a quick update, my parts stock for the mounts is running low. I also make VW parts and that season is coming now! So very busy times indeed.

So I will not be able to send out any more mounts for the next couple of weeks. The once that have already ordered from me will of course get their parts.

I'll update when I have parts in stock again and my head above water, have fun esk8'ers.

Just a short status on these mounts:
Got 2 mounts with cover for 83mm wheels ready to ship. 
Got 4 mounts without cover that I can sell with shipping (no tracking) for 35 Euros, a good deal for a really solid mount.

My printer head is a goner, so It will be sometime before I can start printing covers again.

i chose 30mm cause the APS mount has 30mm :laughing: 28mm is for the old torqueboard V2 mounts - not sure what the diameter is nowadays!

i think a smaller diameter is only a problem when you want to use 15mm belts - cause then you need the pipes allll the way in and I used 30mm with a 1.5m thick wall and got it stuck in juuuust enough to allow the 15mm belt. of course you can always dremel some on the ronins to stick the pipe further in ;)

Hi Maxid, 

I did a quick test and 30mm hole will indeed conflict with the clamping screws. Give me some time and I will check if it is easy to water cut a clamp designed to take 30mm hole. 

I really would like to make a mount for Ronin truck. 
But the geometry around the hanger is a bit complex and it is casted, so there might be differences from a batch to the next one, this makes it much harder to make a mount that will work on all batches and clamp tight. It would be way easier to just machine the trucks, but then you would have to buy both trucks and mounts from me.

```
Your images got me thinking and I tried to make myself a new style of Caliber/Universal clamp:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/a/9a9daaa86d320429c9eac1873f0e62abe6e555ed.PNG" width="581" height="500">

It's a 50mm ring with a 25mm hole and a M8 screw to bolt it to a flat side of a Caliber truck. The screw presses the inner surface to the rounded side of the truck and thus holds it in place.
On the outside I put 11 M4 holes to hold the motor plate.

Once bolted down hard the mount can't be moved. I am honestly wondering why so far everybody is offering multi-part clamping solutions when it can be done this easily. The inner diameter could be adjusted to whatever and a second M8 screw at a 90Â° angle would make for an even tighter fit (if necessary at all).

Since I don't have ronin trucks I can't test it - but since the ronins have flat sides as well this could fit as is.

Hi, sorry for late reply. I have been crazy busy the last few weeks.

I actually have parts for a few mounts left, tomorrow I will update post with stock. (I think there are parts for about 5 mounts left)
But my 3D printer is still out of order, so these last mounts will be delivered without cover.
However I will upload print files for those that would like to print cover.

Another thing I would like feedback on is if there is any interest in bying kits with mount + pulleys and belt. 
I am thinking about doing a small series of mounts with 12mm wide pulley 36 + 15 teeth and 265mm belt.

As a side note I just got back from an epic Eskate run. Pushing the board harder then ever, mount rock solid. Carving into the suset....love it! Hope you all enjoy this hobby as much as I am.

Allright great, that sounds perfect. Then I will cancel my other options. Do you have any idea within which timeframe this will be? Because like you said, nothing better than carving the street with a hot breeze!! Best hobby I've found so far.. 
At the moment I can use only one motor so it is not as much fun though. Looking forward to your mounts, these seem much better than the Enertion ones.

Hi, timeframe for next batch of parts will be about 6 weeks unfortunately. I know quite long! But these are not just laser cut parts but also precise CNC'd and that takes time. I fully understand if you cannot wait that long.

Well, it is a bit of time yes but you are the only one who makes them with covers and that is a pro for me because these little stones on the street sometimes can puncture the belts and break them. Plus your mounts are nicely painted. Just one last question. Will the screws for the motor go in the outside holes of the motor?

Hi, so here is an update on current status of these mounts.

The new batch is due at the end of this month.

Regarding the time it has taken, I have had several issues with the producer that I have used earlier, so to make a long story short I had to find a new manufacturer and unfortunately lost some extra weeks in this process.

I also wanted to improve to make the mounts even better than the previous version. 

So what is new or improved on the V2:
- Changed material on the motor plate to aluminum 7075 - T6 instead of steel.
- This, of course, makes the mounts significantly lighter,  but also aluminum is awesome for cooling the motor, so basically the motor plate acts as a big heat sink. 
- Both motor plate and truck bracket is now CNC milled with countersink pockets for the screws, this improves the clearance for pulleys. I think it now should be possible to run 15mm wide pulleys with the mounts...to be tested.
- Added threaded holes for idlers on both sides on motor plate, can run one or two idlers!  These are fixed so it is not possible to adjust on this version.
- I use two smaller bearings with 5mm width and a low profile screw with this setup the idler is tucked on the inside of the wheel, so you can use different wheel sizes.
- The idler is hidden on the inside of the cover to still keep the motor mount as stealth as possible.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/d/cd7f905660981b2dcdec8a4ed1728989048d09be.jpg" width="690" height="388">

The down side of added features like these is that price will have to increase a bit, I will update with the new price once I have all details, but it should be under 40 Euros for just the mount, then a bit extra for cover and idler.

So the idea is that you can just buy the mount if you need a great mount, then add cover and/or idler if you need more options.

If that is too steep I still have some of these 0- series V1 left:

Hey @WSB, looking good! What's the OD of the idlers? Do you have any info regarding wheel size that the mount with idler(s) will fit. Belt length info/recommendations?

## \#137 Posted by: WSB Posted at: 2017-10-16T15:22:15.533Z Reads: 216

Hi, bearing is stainless steel while the outer boss is aluminium.  It would be quite expensive to make the outer boss in stainless. 
I initially tested with smaller bearings for the idler, but the small bending radius for the belt is not good for belt life.
```

## \#138 Posted by: WSB Posted at: 2017-10-16T15:30:41.799Z Reads: 218

Hi, OD is 25mm. 
The idea with this type of idler is that it can be "tucked inside" of the wheel since the screw head is flush. 
But my problem is that I only have so many wheels and pulley so I can not test all configs. But I will come up with info of what I have tested, then it's up to members here to decide if they want to try it out or not. 
I know the base mount works very well. It is the idler combined with wheel sizes and different size pulleys that sort of makes this hard!
