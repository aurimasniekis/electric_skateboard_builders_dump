I think these are carvon v2‚Äôs. 2.5 were on a duel diagonal setup, so only 1 motor per truck.

The V2.5's I bought in early 2017 and used over the summer until late Fall, although with many weeks pause in between because of holidays, part changes and busy times during dysfunction.
They haven't been used since as I have acquired V4 SD R's in Spring last year.
Kept them because I thought I would sell them with the VESCs to an indecisive friend.

I thought the V2.5 existed in dual and single motor versions? It says V2.5 in the Order mail.

Mostly city traffic. Yes, fairly dynamic riding ;)
Scratches and marks are mostly superficial, even the deeper ones on the edge don't affect the actual motor cylinder it surround as seen in the picture.

How wide are the trucks on the carvons from axle to axle? What wheels are those? Superflys?

V.2.5's are based on 180mm Caliber II Truck Clones. Wheels appear to be modified (drilled out) 90mm Maytech Clones.

I could be mistaken. Apologies my friend, either way they‚Äôre sick. I have some myself I‚Äôm in the process of modifying. Beautiful craftsmanship. GL with your sale.

Good morning.      
Given the demand, to simplify the situation, to stop leaving you guys with ifs and maybes and lastly to get a better price, I will put both the Carvons and VESCs on eBay for short term auction (2-3 day bidding period) after successfully checking up on the products to reconfirm full functionality, which I likely won't be able to do before the weekend. Link will be posted here as soon as the auction is online.       
        
In an attempt to make this fair I will grant eBay buyers who can authenticate themselves as an early (before this reply) interested responder to this topic a corresponding flat discount on the full price, around 10-25‚Ç¨.       

The other items will stay directly available to the first buyer.

Thank you for dealing with my inexperience.

@pjotr47 said he wanted the vescs first, fair and square. That's a bit of a bummer to change your mind on that.

Same for the carvon drive. I had texted him this night that I also want those drives. He even calculated shipping cost for me. Only thing he had to do was giving his Paypal mail :joy: But this morning I waked up with seeing this. 

We will see how the auction goes. :wink:

Yeah, this has nothing to do with "simplifying the situation" and everything to do with "wanting more money," haha. :thinking:

Good luck, my friend!

I felt bad myself as I had also messaged about buying them. 
BUT, I think we all know that buying a set of Carvon V2.5 drives for that cheap wouldn't quite feel right.

We will see how the eBay listing goes

Given the situation in my inbox I would argue that it is in fact a simplification. ;)         
But yeah I'm not denying that I'd be happy to sell them for more.         
And I am especially sorry for filling @pjotr47 with false hope and the people who I essentially clickbaited, wasting time and making this bigger than it had to. This was not my intention. Next time I will plan and know better and not suddenly change my offer.

Hello @ACIN!
I'll be happy to take the welder but I guess shipping might be expensive to France! Any idea of the amount shipped?

Hey @Netoa,
I will check later and PM you, expecting around 15‚Ç¨.
Also can send a photo of everything included and some tips with the machine.
I don't think I have the original packaging anymore though.
See you     

EDIT: also please give me your postal code for an exact estimate.
