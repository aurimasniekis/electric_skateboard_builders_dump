@Factory72 @coolwhip
Yes! But shipping calculated at checkout will not be correct. Ever since the dimensional weight was implemented it'd very hard to calculate correctly. 

PM me with what you rolling for and I can give you a shipping estimate. If you guys are cool with I could send both if your stuff at the same time to one person to save on shipping.

Fantastic! Congratulations! :slight_smile: 

Just to let you know, and I'm sure it's just because you have nothing in that section yet, but when you go through the popup menu at the top right for 'shop' you just get taken back to the home page of the website when you click on any of the following:-
All Kits
Single Motor Kits
Dual Motor Kits

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/a/da507474a1b83a6991fd614d1fbfda33c8e65510.png" width="689" height="500">

A bit of advise, if you can it would be good to put a count in brackets next to each category on that menu, just to let the user know of their impending possible choices. Something like   Single Motor Kits (0)   if I saw that, I wouldn't waste my time clicking on it only to find nothing there.

Also a lot of users will click on that 'shop' option, at the moment it just reloads the page and then the menu disappears. Frustrating. I know it's nice to have it just on the hover over (I'm assuming you're relying on CSS3 for the popup menu on hover), but you need to disable the default behaviour of that href to stop it from doing that.

Also Tutorials takes you back to the home page. Maybe just take the user to a place-holder page with "tutorials coming"?

Bit of a style/css issue I'd imagine but your description HTML is way offset to the left.

FYI: I'm using the latest version of chrome on a laptop, I've not checked on my phone yet.

Hope this helps :smiley:

Just to add to the above, on my Samsung S7 when you click on the menu burger, the lovely menu slides in from the left, but if you tap on 'Shop' it just takes you to a page that lists everything. You have to know to tap on the down arrow if you want to pick something specific from the 'shop' child menu options...

@darkkevind thanks for all of the constructive feedback! Just what I was looking for! I will do my best to implement the things you suggested, I'm not sure if I have the knowledge to fix the "shop clicking" issue where the menu disappears but I would like it to be changed now that you mention it. 

Thanks again!

If you're able to, replace the HTML for that menu item with this:

&lt;a class="dropdown-toggle has-category" data-toggle="dropdown" href="javascript:void(0);" title="Shop" target="_self"&gt;
                                        &lt;span class="menu-title"&gt;Shop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b class="caret"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
                                    &lt;/a&gt;

If you can't replace it all, just see if you can change the href attribute and put this in there instead of the URL:
**javascript:void(0);**

Failing that, I can give you some jQuery to run on page load to disable it...

Exactly what @mmaner said. PA is one of the worst business taxing states. There is a 3% net income tax and a 2.9% luxury import tax. Sorry, but I can't do much :( it should be less than $10 tho...

## \#40 Posted by: Dizzee Posted at: 2017-07-05T22:09:25.700Z Reads: 470

How did they manage to pull that off? If I follow all the rules would that leave me responsible for PA's taxes plus my states taxes? Or is it like shopping at a B&M (local typical business) so my only tax obligation is to PA?

@JLabs Please don't take this as me trying to give you or your business a hard time. I didn't understand what was going on with the taxes on the order and I figured others may have the same question.

Edit: Cleaned up.

If you follow the rules you would have to pay your own States sales tax (I think) but no one does that when shopping online... think of Amazon or eBay, you don't really file those purchases on your taxes.

Actually, it's physically impossible (or so I'm told by my mfg) to get a true 190kv 6354 in my can style. After @Jinra's article i had a long chat with them and they said 208kv and 178kv were the 2 closest they could provide. I don't think the 18kv difference would be that detrimental and if your running 12S you could always limit the ERPM.

Is there any chance I could pay you to print a nylon pulley for me? I'm trying to figure out exactly how long the nylon will last before committing to an aluminum one. Or do you know of somewhere I could get one 3d printed? Thanks!

But you could do it for me for $20 if I wanted it? I know aluminum is the better choice I just want to use a nylon one to test and see exactly how many miles I can get out of it. Then I would just aluminum.

All orders from the past week have shipped (delay was from the trip to California). 

There are very few 6374‚Äôs left and a couple of Kegel pulleys still in stock. 

I still have a bunch of Mini Remotes on hand as well! Next day shipping

I now have a dual FOCBOX mount available on my store. It allows you to keep everything square and tidy inside your enclosure. Or if your not using an enclosure it allows you to mount the speed controllers directly to the deck! **Its currently $9.99 with free shipping!**

@JLabs
I'm looking for a motor that'll work well with 7S and 10S, 15/16 - 33/35, single wheel drive.  The gearing will remain constant, but ide like to swap between 7S3P and 10S2P packs for range or speed. Would either of yours fit the bill?

I have developed a motor mount for Ronin Trucks that does not require any modifications.. I have been working on the for months and I think I have perfected it. The mount will include an idler pulley and has full 360 degree rotation. Price will be about $65 for the BETA. Please let me know if your interested, as I am hoping to kickstart this because it has consumed me for far too long. 

I dont want to give away all of my secrets yet so I will leave you with this picture of the truck clamps. Please let me know if you have any questions!

A lot of you guys requested 15mm flywheel pulleys during the black friday sale. I wanted to put a poll out so I can get a feel for what kind of size you guys use. If you could take a few seconds to tell me what size you want/use it would be very helpful! 

[poll public=true]
- 32t
- 36t
- 40t
- 44t
[/poll]

Also, what other products would you like to see? Im open to suggestions! Any help is greatly appreciated.

I use 40t on 97mm wheels. But could maybe use 36t if I had to, though 40t still better if I got to 107mm wheels.

32T=Speed

40T=Torque

Right?  So everyone wants torque and not speed?

real world riding demands hill climbing, maneuvering through traffic on the road and sidewalk, and fine control over throttle and brakes. the torque really aids in all of these. 

top speed is fun but not as practical.

What are your VESC settings? and What motor are you running? I've got a more aggressive torque (90mm wheels and 13/36 gearing) and have not had that issue once I got the settings dialed in.

the remote also helps.  i use the 2.4ghz mini, the throw on it is a lot taller than then thumb controlled remotes.

so there's more articulation in controlling throttle.

but if you're getting jerky on / off throttle, something's off with your settings.

12s4p - $379 
10s4p - $299

Both will have the BesTech BMS with eSwitch, Charger, and % display. Flat pack style to limit height. Pre order only, price does not include shipping to you. USA only.

Here‚Äôs an idea: 

How about selling flat 3s4p 18650 packs that could be connected together in series (bullet connectors?) to make larger capacity 6s or 12s packs? These would come with leads for balance charging, for those customers who do not use a BMS, or have 3s chargers or alternatively they could be plugged into wiring loom kit that includes a 6s or 12s BMS which is available separately (or altogether in a kit).

This would allow flexibility in the capacity of lower budget builds (who might use 6s voltage) to swap out using modular battery packs, or increase the voltage by adding more packs when improving or upgrading their decks.  Similiarly, the fact that the pack is small, predictably sized (and hopefully under 99 WH?) there would be flexibility in were it was located on your deck, using the same battery system for a deck with a split enclosure, or single main enclosure.

The only time I have seen this sort of this thing executed well was @Eboosted's build:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/loaded-vanguard-caliber-ii-44-custom-10s4p-3d-printed-enclosure-abec-11-97mm-75a/13361/122

I was going to start my own thread about modular battery systems, which would hopefully permit international customers to purchase. 

What do you guys think?
```

I tried that approach before, to tell the truth was not worth it.

1. Most airlines won't allow to travel with 18650 packs even if they are below 100W/hr, Li-Ion batteries for electric vehicles are forbidden and considered as dangerous good with high risk for airline carriers.

2. Even if the airline states on their policy that you can travel with Li-Ion batteries, you will be subject to the decision of the airline agent, you could always lie to them, but then it defeats the whole purpose of a travel safe battery

3. Even smart bags with a low capacity batteries have been prohibited.

https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/06/568813489/airlines-restrict-smart-luggage-over-fire-hazards-posed-by-batteries

4. A battery made of packs connected together with bullet connectors is extremely dangerous, if they disconnect somehow or get loose because of unavoidable vibrations of a daily use, they will spark constantly and could ignite inside the enclosure. The bullets will wear off with time, you can not avoid it. 

5. I wouldn't ever want to be the guy whos battery ignited in mid flight and cause a hazard to 200 passengers and is now facing a millionare lawsuit from the airline and 50 passengers who almost lost their lives and their kids.

6. Finally, if you decide to ignore all risks and go ahead and fly with your board, you will travel with a lot of stress knowing that you might end up with a confiscated USD 400 battery, going uneasy through all security check points, praying God for the batteries to not ignite in midflight and thinking about how are you going to sell your house to pay an expensive lawyer.  

Guys just ground ship an extra set of batteries to your final destination and enjoy your trip.

So if I'm understanding this correctly the sk3 6374 is like 84mm long bc of a fan? it has a smaller stator than an Alien 6384?

torqueboards is 1 lb 15 oz (31 oz). hmmmm!! TBH if you didn't put 6384 up on the picture I'd probably have pulled the trigger already! Paralyzed by confusion.

SK3 is 858g which is 30.2oz

APS 955 grams aka 33.7 oz

dark matter 906g -> 32oz

But it is a 6384.. I don‚Äôt get how there is confusion. 

I originally had them listed as 6374 because I didn‚Äôt want people to wonder why it was different than 6384 but I had listed the total length was 84mm I had 2 people return motors because they didn‚Äôt see that so I then put it in the title.

Well "6384" in absence of other information implies more power than 6374. You've had these listed as 6374, and 6374 is printed on the can. When you change the listing to 6384, I'm sure I'm not the only one, I'm wondering if these are indeed bigger/moar-power than the usual 6374s ala torqueboards, kaly, your previous ones. Or just larger cans.

I'm not hating on you, I'm really excited, but just trying to compare for value as I'm sure everyone else is.

I drew it once in autocad and it should fit with 10mm pulleys and belts, you should have like 2mm space in between them. Keep in mind that I used pneumatics and custom mount. I will look for the dwg file if you are interested.

EDIT: I drew it based on APS 6384 but that should not matter too much since it is still an 84

BTW what are some specs of these motors? Because when I was looking at APS 6374 and 6384 comparison of the same kv there was only 0.1 Nm difference or something insignificant like that. and based on some pictures from the backside I found (dont know where so I wont be able to post them) I could see that while the can is longer, the stator seemed to be "deeper" so not that much longer than 74s. That was APS mind you, It would  be great if these were really bigger

Related but unrelated question:
Is the motor easy to disassemble ? I have a 6374 BKB motor (one with the old logo) and I think something is stuck in there, there's a grinding noise sometimes when the motor spins.
I saw the snap ring on the shaft. Is there anything else to remove to be able to separate the rotor and stator ?

As others have stated...shoving a full size BMS into an Enclosure as well as the extra cells is gonna be tight... normally you gotta give somewhere.

Also I don't use discharge because I don't want my brakes to stop working when I don't expect them to... If you set your end cut offs right and use like cells...the battery should almost act as self balancing. It will keep all the cells evenish if the pack is healthy and not ever over discharged or over amped.. the BMS is just there to keep that balance tight at a charge. 

If we didn't use vesc with cutoffs and Max amps...yes you need the BMS to do these functions. But we have VESC :)

Just my opinion.

In my opinion, with large battery packs it‚Äôs a must if you want your cells to last longer. Chaka went into some detail in this thread

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/float-charging-why-you-shouldnt-bypass-the-bms/39879?u=jlabs

## \#291 Posted by: Deckoz Posted at: 2018-02-27T02:55:56.040Z Reads: 260

@jlabs.... a full discharge bms still balances at the same rates as a charge only. The balancing currents are typically always small.

The solution to this, is plug your board in and leave it plugged in over night, it'll charge and balance until its all good. :) and as I said before..a healty pack built right with fresh cells, that arent overdischarged, or over drawn on amps, stay really well balanced on their own...

it's why its important to set your battery amps right. and end voltage cut offs properly. Staying within the natural physical limitations of a battery is an easier method, then having a big pack that is abused due to to much current or improper cutoffs for the current draws. 


But yea it is upto everyone to choose what they do. There are positives and negatives to both building methods..

I have decided that there is enough demand for Kegel/Popoca/Boa pulleys. I am doing a $5 pre order that saves you a spot, and this allows me to accurately gauge demand. When they arrive I will give you all a $5 coupon to take off the price of the pulley. These will be 36t 15mm (no exceptions, changes). I am going to hollow out the center a bit as well.

Use code ‚Äúprekegel‚Äù for free shipping on the pre order.

I think there will be an increased demand for Kegel pulleys when people start getting there hands on these 100mm Boa wheels. Initial testers report performance similar or slightly better than abec11's  and the company claims they are ready to ship soon.

These cores are stronger anyway and I for one would be happy to see ABEC11 move to them as well.  Although if there was a 108mm Boa wheel I'm not sure I'd ever need anything from ABEC11 ever again

A lot of you have been asking about when motors will be back in stock. I am expecting them mid next month, and want to do a pre order to sense how much demand there is. I usually don‚Äôt do that many pre orders, but I feel like it is necessary at this point. So for pre ordering you are getting quite a discount :blush:

6354 208kv Motor
[/quote]

Are these the same as previous batch(es) aka 190kv renamed to 208kv?

"Sensor Wires: 260mm, standard connector" Does this mean JST-PH so they plug directly into vesc headers?

Any improvements?

And, please use correct terminology ;)

Agree, keyseat is a bit esoteric. But key vs keyway -- I'm talking about stuff like this in 6355's description: 

[quote]This batch of motors does not have any flat spots on the shaft (pictured). No keyway is included, but the spot for a keyway is on the motor.[/quote]

And IIRC you were referring to keys as "keyways" when you had them for sale? Apologies in advance if I'm wrong.

https://buildkitboards.com/pages/beta-testers

Currently I am only looking for people with:

1. Working build using caliber trucks
2. People who put a lot of miles on their boards

I will be providing free parts in exchange for your private feedback. Please dont fill out the form if you do not fit the two requirements above. In the future I may need other testers with different requirements and I will post a different form.

### [Caliber Motor Mount](https://buildkitboards.com/products/motor-mount)

I was going to use these mounts for the upcoming kits, but the tolerances of the trucks just are not tight enough to be able to use a one piece mount for hundreds of slightly different trucks. My loss = your gain. I have a painted pair of Caliber 2...

Price: USD 8.50

If @excess falls through, I'll take em too. I also bought some mounts and a FOCBOX cooling plate.

And @excess, if you don't need the esc on the right, would you mind if I grabbed it? My son killed one of mine when I was updating firmware and he walked in and pressed the power button on my battery mid update.

I have two brand new 12s2p batteries avaliable. Bidding starts at $1 (2 highest bidders will win). You can also buy it now for $220 which is a steal and what will likely happen. Most other items have been sold before the auction ended.
