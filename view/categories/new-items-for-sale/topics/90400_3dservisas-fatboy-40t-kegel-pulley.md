I have a pair of these aluminum pulleys for Kegel cores and are 40T.

After shipping they came out to â‚¬98, which is $110USD.  I have only fitted them to my 100mm Boas, but they have not been used.  The fit was kinda tight so I had to use a rubber mallet to get them in, so there is just the slightest bit of wear that shows, but all in all, they are essentially brand new.

I'd also be willing to sell the Boas with them ($120), as well as the TB 218 trucks I have them on ($65).  All of these items have never been used.  This adds up to $295, but if you get everything I'd do $275.

DM if interested!
