This battery is brand new. I purchased it from psychotiller with hopes to make a board and resale.. never panned out and Iâ€™ve sold most of the other parts already. This is a 12s5p 30q 18650 battery with charge only bms. Price is $460 and shipping in US only for free.

So it was described to me from a friend that lived in Perth that the heat there can only be described as melting. Like 24/7 melting. Oh look, ice cream! Nope. Its melted...

Edit for on topic: nice ðŸ”‹

Itâ€™s $55 more plus shipping costs and you have to wait 2 weeks to a month. I ship out soon as payment is made. Also he does not offer warranty on the On off switch (which are known to blow, thatâ€™s why he doesnâ€™t offer warranty on them) and also the warranty on his batteries are case by case basis.. the battery gage and chargers are very cheap (no disrespect towards psychotiller I like him a lot.) this battery is for someone who is looking to save a little bit and not wanting to wait and again itâ€™s brand new

How come? Evolve, Enertion, Bajaboard, FiiK, Epic, Board Bumpers, etc, etc, all are from Australia?? On top of that, China is very close, sooo??

It comes with just the battery, but if you need a charger and the charger port I can throw that in for free.. I think I might have the on off switch laying around as well
