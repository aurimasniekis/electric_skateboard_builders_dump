***Please note the Allen key pictured is not included***

Enertion 12mm Drive Pulley Kit. Exactly as seen on the website.
http://www.enertionboards.com/electric-skateboard-parts/12mm-wide-pulley-drive-hub-kit/

$40USD + actual shipping cost including packaging rounded up to the nearest dollar.

***edit*** I checked and can ship for $15US with tracking to most places in the US and Canada including buying a box or envelope with tracking. 

I'm located in Ontario Canada. Willing to ship to Canada and US both with tracking only. Can get quotes tomorrow.

Thanks for lookin' eh!

Hey, I am interested in this pulley but the price seems a little off. To buy one new from enertion it would be $60 including shipping. So $50 plus shipping seems a little high. If you could estimate shipping to Maine (US) that would be great. Also, why is there a allen key if there if there is no set screw?

You are absolutely correct @Smorto my mistake. I will change the price to $40US. Also the allen key is for the set screw for my motor mount. I will fix the original post for both points. Thanks

The best shipping I can get from enertion to me is $23.72CAD or about $18US I had no other reference. Tomorrow I can check some zip codes from Canada to US.

@barajabali does this change your mind? You asked first.

If I have caliber trucks wonder if I will need to modify to use this set up. Also how does the drove gear stay on the wheel?

If you have enertion trucks they are already modified. If you have any other type of caliber truck or clone then yes you need to modify the truck to fit the pulley. The bearing in the pulley hold its on the wheel. Very nice design. If I had purchased two of these in the beginning then I would not be selling this.

@i2oadsweepei2
Just signed up! About to gather all the parts to build my first esk8 board, and this is definitely on the list.
How much for everything shipped to Winnipeg? The drive pulley kit, the extra belts, and the buffalo mod?
Side question: the extra belts are the same length as enertion, right?
I would've PM'd, but either I haven't figured out how, or I can't because I'm a new user.

@landonkun I just double checked and yes the website shows 265T for the enertion 12mm belt. I bought them for another project but they ended up being too short. I paid $40 for the kit, $24 for the belts and $20 for the GT2B mod plus shipping for all. You can take it all for $70US if you pay actual shipping. 

P.S. I have two of DIY'S enclosures I'm not going to be using as well. They have never been mounted. Again my plans for battery setup changed and I can't use them now.
One Esc enclosure
diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/esc-enclosure/
One 2x 6s Lipo enclosure
diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/2x6s-rc-lipo-battery-enclosure/
I paid $35 each I would add them for $20 each if interested.

Thanks for the inquiry.

@i2oadsweepei2 
Sorry for the late reply. I thought I would get e-mail notifications.. gotta check my settings.

Anyway, definitely interested in purchasing. I may not need the battery enclosure, as I was envisioning a 2x3S build, but I'll think about it.

Edit: Looks like I can send PMs now. Will send.

I'm not sure what you want me to do here. I'm not a store or a dealer. Why would I buy another pulley only to lose money selling it after shipping? I don't plan on buying another pulley from enertion either way. I have one pulley kit and three extra belts. That is all. 

Good luck in your search.

Ok I have the Pulley kit still. I ordered some retainers from eBay a while back and added two. Circlips I think they are called.

I also have an Enertion motor mount. Painted it orange....

And two torqueboards esc's with bec and parallel connector. Plug and play for a battery with an xt-90s. Motor side is 5.5mm I believe.

And two DIY enclosures. The smaller one with fit two esc's, receiver, bec etc... there is good space. It also will fit tightly two 3s 5000's too. The larger one will fit two 6s 5000's.

I don't need to sell the rest but I might for the right price. Once you get the bug it's kinda infectious.

- Pulley kit is new and was $40us+ I think. I'd take $40 Canadian.
- Motor mount the last one I sold for about $35 cad
- The two TB 12s esc's and bec have little use and are solid. Maybe 200kms. I'd like $200 cad 
- the diy enclosures were $70us combined. I'd like $50cad

Plus shipping for any or all.

@i2oadsweepei2 I'll gladly take the pulleys (plus belt) and the mount.  Plus those enclosures. I noticed you might have extra belts too? And i also saw you had a buffalo mod, that still available? Thanks

I still have the mod. It's just a case though. No Gt2b included. I should tell you it's been refined more since I bought this one (More rounded edges). It cost me around $30us shipped. It's yours for $10cad. The belts are no longer available.

Pulley kit, motor mount, enclosures and Buffalo mod.
$40 + $35 + $50 + $10 is $135 + shipping with a signature.
I'm good with paypal friends and family or not. If no friends and family then add 3% ($4.00). Or e-transfer. Lmk

 Ya I have a GT2B coming from eBay. So I'm not too picky about the mod. Anything would be better than what it is haha. 
Ok. So let me know about the shipping and ill e transfer you the cash. Maybe pm me with the details?

Sorry I will be going tomorrow for the shipping quote. Unless you in a rural or remote area I can't see it being more than $15-$18 cad maybe less for regular parcel.

Here is the BB Mod
