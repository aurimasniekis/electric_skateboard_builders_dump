**Selling for $225+shipping**



I can ship anywhere...

Havent used them once. 


I couldnt find a use for them, so i decided to sell. Might as well use the money i get from these for my build. Thanks

Im based in Los Angeles.

**Here is a picture of one of the hubs. It comes with two.**

Edit: I just noticed, on one of the hubs, the plug of the sensor cable is kinda broken. **I will be including a spare sensor cable to fix this.** Price lowered from $275 to $225 because of this minor problem.

Just so I have it straight, this comes with the 2 hub motors and the trucks they mount on, but not the front truck or the front (unpowered) wheels?

So, i found a buyer, international, and i ran into some problems that will make me wait about 10 days to ship to him, since i am missing international ‚Äúcustoms pouches‚Äù **so i am still looking for buyers**.



Still up for sale for the next 10 days, and if i dont get another buyer, i will sell to the current person purchasing it.
