It pains me to do this. But life took all my free time.  Not to mention weddings/engagements and honeymoons costing s Fortune. 

@stewii and @bimmer built these,  

Selling all my escape pcbs and enclosures. Some are ESCape , some are @Bummer rebrand.
The first few people can have some components
Not everything I have is in this picture. I've got more components and pcbs at the office as well as a STENCIL 

Prices include shipping to USA

I can also send you an updated BOM so you can order all components (everything is in stock and confirmed, this alone took hours to solve) for about $60 from Mouser

WHOLESALE:
Selling the whole lot for $200 obo.
 
OR

PART OUT:

Single Enclosure $30 (3)

Dual Enclosure $50 (2)

PCBS $10 (9)

Components 2.5 pcbs worth $60 takes the lot

Stencil $50
