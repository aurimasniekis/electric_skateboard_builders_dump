Ideally, I want someone locally with an eboard on hand ready to mate with my setup.  Someone that can meet me over the weekend at my place for dynamic testing.  My neighborhood has a variety of terrain, great place to trouble shoot and find problems.

Gears used my own Janux aluminum Quattro hubs https://www.janux-esk8.com/product-page/janux-quattro-4s-pneumatic-wheels-complete.   I don't think they would fit standard alixpress hubs because of different mounting hole pattern.

Theoretically yes but the current batch of 110s have a flipped core. Chat to dexter about it if you want to make sure there's compatibility. 

I can tell you that 3dservitas pulleys fit well on normal and flipped cores.

Guessss whoooooo!?!? So after a year under my belt i decided to step my game up. I will be testing these out for marc and so far im very impressed! A perfect gear drive for those who dont want to upgrade to a longer hanger! Only his hubs work on the caliber 2‚Äôs but essentially if you have the extended axles, you can use any hub! I had to cut the shafts on my 6355 but lucky for all of us i was planning on cutting them for a future gear drive purchase!!!! I will post a thread later on and post all my trials and info (with pictures, i promiseüòã).
