I bought an FS GT2B remote ($27) and the black custom case mod from Bad Wolf ($25),  and an extra receiver ($11?) off Amazon/eBay but I've decided I don't want it. 

I started putting it together and then realized the FlySky GT2B battery is a little larger than the Hobby King one. You need to buy a smaller battery ($5?) to finish putting it together. 

I'll eat the shipping cost and you can have it in a couple days. US customers only. 

Not posting pics as its all brand new. GT2B is supposedly the most reliable remote.

Also, I think there are different versions of the Wolf Mod case. This is the newest version.

I thought Flysky GT2B and HobbyKing GT2B are the exact same size?

They are, but some of the new ones started shipping with bigger batteries. They increased 200mAh I think.
