Hi guys) this is not a group buy, but I might offer VESC 6 at discounted prices from trampa. Those should be around $260 a piece shipping included pretty much worldwide! Or $500 for 2) I just want a few for my builds and not willing to pay Â£300 for 1ðŸ˜‰

[poll type=regular public=true]
* Yes, I want 1
* Yes, I want 2
[/poll]

Let me know!

I was going to buy 20, 10 for US and 10 for EU. The price was going to be like this if I would of gotten a little discount however I'm not. So I don't know if Ill be doing this anymore, but if I am, it will be at a slightly higher price since I don't want to loose moneyðŸ˜…I'm myself in Switzerland, it would be free shipping.

Interested, wondering if Trampa could mail them directly to EU members to avoid import taxes?

Also warranty, with the GB organiser or Trampa?
