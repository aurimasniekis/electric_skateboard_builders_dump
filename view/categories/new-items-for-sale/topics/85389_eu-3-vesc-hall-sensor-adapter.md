Hello everyone,

I have ordered a time ago some connectors and wires for building motor sensor wire adapters.

I have a limited amount of material laying for 30 adapters. You can chose your own length between 10cm & 30cm.  Each cable has its own heat shrink and is further strengthened with hot glue inside the outer shrinks.

30cm adapter: â‚¬3/piece
other lengths:  â‚¬4/piece

You drive a hard bargain. How about you throw in a custom battery pack to offset the shipping cost? :stuck_out_tongue:

Looks nice!
Is it correct that the long ones cheaper than the short ones?

@L3chef yes that is possible. Send me your adress in pm. Most of the time shipping is 2 euro. 

@Andy87 haha yes, I solder those wires on my own. Those wires are 30cm from the factory. So soldering is much easier. If it must be shorter it take more time. To cut etc
