Yes as long as you have an account on their website it should be transferable. @EnertionSupport could you please confirm this?

Reason for selling it without any use: bought it over a year ago, got delivered last Thursday. In the meantime I got married, bought a house. And I'd rather use my dyi for now and buy extra furniture. 😉

I wounder how a parted out raptor 2 would sell,

Some would buy the motors,
Others would buy the Q30 10s4p pack,
Others could buy the deck,
and then others would buy the 2 focboxes that come with the raptor.

Definitely worth more separated than complete.  
@moon if you run it at suicide mode all the time and are a heavy guy flying up steep hills then they get hot and there is not a hub motor out there that doesn't.  Try not to run off topic when this guy is trying to sell his board.

I have a board from that same batch and can confirm mine has the silver motors with 10 mm axle's that sits flush on the hanger.

The urethane is softer (feels better) than the urethane from January 2018 which I owned. So yes, new improved formula.

Edit: oh wait you're asking FranciscoV who's doing a hostile takeover in this sell thread :joy:

No problem mate, hope I can sell it soon. 1200 euro is a fair price right? Or should I expect a bigger loss? I know someone who sold one a while ago for a lot more.

That's to much of a hassle for me right now. Very busy at work and with the new house. So I'd rather wait and sell the whole board at once. 😅

They are transferable, both parties need to contact support.
