Will work with Paris Trucks or Paris clones. No file needed on Paris trucks or Paris clones. $15 + shipping USPS U.S. only

Dickyho ver. (1.5)- 10S 36V dual esc with controller. Has 4 different speeds plus reverse and brakes. I bought it to use on my sons Diy eboard but he didn't like the thumb throttle on the controller. I tested it and installed heat shrink on wires so it looks better and wire protection, (Paid $64) $50 + shipping USPS U.S. only

Meepo board dual esc case, latest one $15 + shipping U.S. only USPS

I can do $60 for case and esc if bought together.

It is true we cannot get those SRdz adjustable base plates anymore?

They still have some for the TKPs.  But it was insinuated to me that another batch of adjustable RKP baseplates wasn't planned in the near future.  

There may be other solutions in the works however...

@Nowind just came with a good replacement a few days ago. Hit it big time with that one.
