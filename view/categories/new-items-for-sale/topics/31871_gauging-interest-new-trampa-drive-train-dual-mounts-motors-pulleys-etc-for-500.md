Since most components are significantly cheaper bundled and Trampa doesn't support placing custom orders, I'm looking at my options for an upcoming MTB purchase.  There's no SKU that aligns with what I need, so I'm looking at buying one that covers more and selling what I don't need  Even though it will be extra work, I'm still slightly leaning towards a Trampa board, but to make it work I'd need to sell:

http://www.trampaboards.com/mountainboard-motormount-with-electric-motor--66-tooth-pulley-kit-for-trampa-mountainboard-trucks-p-13769.html
(optioned out for dual motors, etc)

Priced out, it comes to $729 USD (plus more than $40 shipping to US) for the twin 136kv motors/mounts/pullies when bundled all together... more if purchased individually (I'd probably option for superstar and 14t).

I'd need to resell them for $500 (new/unused) + shipping to make it work.  Would need to confirm, but I think that should also include free shipping to anywhere in the continental US... maybe a bit more for elsewhere.

Does this sound like a attractive offer that would get bites easily...  I'm hoping that would be low enough to be considered 'priced to sell', but interested in thoughts.

Is anyone potentially interested? (...but warning, I'm waiting on the trucks/wheels I want to come back in stock... which for all I know, could be another month or more? ...and I don't know how long it will take to process/ship my order to the US, etc... so maybe not for people in a hurry).

Thanks,

for me, I wouldn't be interested unless the kit came with risers to support use on a standard longboard.  I'm just not a big fan of Trampa boards, the hump in the middle makes me uncomfortable after a couple of miles.  Nice kit though, well put together.
