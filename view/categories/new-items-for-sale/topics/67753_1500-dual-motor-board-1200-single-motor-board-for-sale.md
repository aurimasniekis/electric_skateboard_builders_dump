I have been building electric skateboards for a little over a year now.  I have made 3 boards for myself as well as helped a few friends with boards of their own. I am currently trying to start my own business building complete boards out of high quality DIY parts.

While I have built multiple boards for myself, I have also ridden hundreds of miles on each and they are no longer clean and unscathed enough to use for really good quality product pictures and videos. I am interested in finding someone who would be willing to pay for just the cost of parts & shipping for a new board.  I want to build 1 single motor board and 1 dual motor board.

I have linked up with a friend who has a DSLR camera and we are going to record & edit the whole build process to show how the board is made and show off the high quality components and attention to detail. We will use the video to market future builds and post the video to Youtube and the website.

Here is the current list of parts and total cost.  The approximate build time will be 4-6 weeks after receiving payment. Please note the total does not include shipping cost to ship the completed board.

Why do you use 25R cells instead of 30Q cells?

I know that you can theoretically discharge 30Q batteries @20A continuous, but I wanted to work within the range that the batteries are rated since this will be a commercial build. Therefore I choose 25R batteries for the lower cost & higher advertised discharge.

Wait, 260 KV at 12s4p? Does that even work? Thought that was beyond the capabilities of the Focbox?

It’s debated about , some say the Focbox has the 60K limit others say it doesn’t. I doubt the motor KV is actually 260 since KVs are almost never the listed value

I have read about the difference and I am aware of the higher voltage sag from 25R batteries, however I need a 4p12s battery pack that can provide 80A continuous to power a dual motor setup. I did not feel comfortable pulling 80A continuous from a 4p 30Q pack because the batteries are simply not rated for that by the manufacturer. I know that any rider would hardly ever pull 80A for more than a few seconds, however if I am selling a board, I have no idea what a person might do (such as towing people up hills). In this case, I wanted to choose hardware that is well within the capabilities of the possible demands of the rider without sacrificing performance. I don’t want someone to buy a board, abuse the battery by pulling too many amps continuously and then blame me if it breaks.

I do think that 30Q cells would be better for the single motor build since not as much continuous power is needed, but cells are cheaper when you buy in bulk so I intend on using the same kind of cells for both boards.

Yes I certainly understand. Within the next few weeks I am planning on recording a video of how I build my batteries and a breakdown of my current boards. Right now I am trying to see if there would be any interest before I take the time and money to purchase batteries and record the video.

I have used a 12s4p setup for dual 260Kv for awhile. I have reached a top speed of 37mph w/o giving full throttle. I never once had any issues with it. 14/37 gear ratio.

For the single I use a single 190Kv motor and the dual I choose dual 6355 3100W 260kv motors because it is what is available and 2 of them will fit on a standard caliber 2 truck. Instead of sourcing motors a bulk orders of motors from Maytech, for the first build I am using motors from TorqueBoards because of the fast shipping. I don’t want someone to be waiting forever for their board because I have to wait on shipping from China.

190Kv 6355 motors from torqueboards would work fine too but it’s rated for slightly lower power output. It’s the same price either way, but the only downside of 260Kv is the ERPM limit which I have never reached even at 37mph so I considered it a non-issue.

Just a note, I do plan on sourcing parts directly from manufacturers in the future, but I want to see if there is a legitimate market for a product like this before I start forking over large amounts of cash to stock eskate parts.

They might be rated for higher wattage but the 190kv is a better choice for more torque and you will get to the same speed as both will be limited to 60k erpm

Alright. I was under the assumption the ERPM was 100k for a FOCBox & 60k for a 4.12 VESC. I will change the parts list when I get home to have 2 190kv 6355 motors since both can handle 50A continuous from the battery.

@kuphjr I've heard 25r's heat up at 20a.

But samsung Q30's will give you 15a solid and cool and come with more range.
But If you wanna penny pinch and pitch a super high wattage board sure whatever.

@blitz Like I have stated before, I can do anything anyone wants if they request it, but my personal preference has always been a battery optimized for high current draw so that’s what I put in the parts list. I love the punch that 100A continuous gives. Also, at 5p, range is almost a non-issue. My legs get tired far before the battery quits.

Questions for DUAL Motor Build ...
(1) Where do you place the KAYAK HANDLES you listed. Side? Nose?
(2) The board's TOTAL WATTS will be 3100W, not 6200W, correct?
(3) I care more steep HILLS than speed. Will I like this Dual Design?
```

---
## \#26 Posted by: kuphjr Posted at: 2018-09-12T22:45:31.204Z Reads: 96

```
The kayak handle will be mounted to the side. One one of them will be mounted per board. They work super well and don’t vibrate or make any noise at all.

Technically the motors are rated for 6200W total, but since the max current of the battery is 100A for 5p the continuous power would be ~5000W at full charge. However, the VESCs settings can be changed to draw 60A each from the battery for ~6000W burst. Samsung 25R batteries should be able to handle that with the 12s5p battery configuration in short (5 second) bursts. You can do this at your own risk if you want the extra power. As long as you don’t tow people and are under ~250lbs you should be fine changing the settings to 60A.

Finally, if you want a board built for hills I would do 190kv motors and 14/40 gear ratio. The top speed would be just over 25 it should destroy any hill.

I get around 25 with 190 kv at 15/40 and 97s. How would you get to 35ish with even lower ratio?

[/quote]

I don't think you fully understand. 
If you want to go with 25Rs because they are cheaper then that's fine, but I would like for you to understand that they do not by any measure provide more power than a 30Q cell. 
Please go look at the datasheets and spec sheets further than page 2. Forget what the rated current is and look at the data and graphs presented. 
If you want me to explain why 30Q is better, I will but I want to give you the chance to go look at it yourself and make an educated decision. 
If you decide that 25R is still the higher current cell, explain why, if you would rather me stay out of it and not explain, then that's fine too.

Fair enough.  According to the graphs I read the heat production is not significantly more than the 25R even at 30A despite the advertised current rating.

30Q batteries do increase the price a bit. Some people will choose to pay for it some will not.  I added it as an option to the spreadsheet.
