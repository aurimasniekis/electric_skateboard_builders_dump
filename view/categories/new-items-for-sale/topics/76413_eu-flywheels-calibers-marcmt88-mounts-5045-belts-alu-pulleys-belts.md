Hubs are direct drive technically yes. Even more so if you want to get super technical.

Gears are not direct drive, that's how you summon @b264

I have just updated the main post with some pics, when I get home I will put some updated ones of the remaining items. 

Since I owe one to @banjaxxed, I will put him first on the list for the mounts and motors. 

Trucks reserved to @LouisVW (10" and 50¬∫, but will confirm).

Clone flywheels + ALU pulleys reserved to someone in our Whatsapp group in Spain, not sure if he is registered here.

Cheers :slight_smile:

Hi all,

I have updated the main post with the remaining items, I sold some of them but there are still few available. 

Available items as follows:
- 2x Caliber II trucks, never used, slightly scratched when testing the mounts [ **1x20‚Ç¨ | 2x35‚Ç¨** ]  [ @LouisVW ] 

- 10x HDT5M 330mm 12mm belts [ **1x7‚Ç¨ | 2x12‚Ç¨ | 3x15‚Ç¨ | 10x40‚Ç¨** ]

- Dual FocBox ALU case from Kug3lis, short fins & black version [ **35‚Ç¨** ]

- 3x 12mm motor pulleys [ **1x4‚Ç¨ | 2x7‚Ç¨ | 3x10‚Ç¨** ] 

- ABEC11 Flywheels 90mm, lime green, never used [ **80‚Ç¨** ]

I still have to do some pics of the Caliber trucks, as @LouisVW asked, sorry about the delay... too much work in these 2 last weeks of the year.

Cheers!

@wapkoen shipping is usually around 10-15‚Ç¨.I propose to split cost so it will be 35+5‚Ç¨=40‚Ç¨.

Let me know if that is ok to send you my details.

Btw, i will post pics of everything tomorrow.

@banjaxxed your box is ready to ship, will do this weekend, sorry about the delay :frowning:

Hi all,

Just uploaded some more pics of the remaining items (flywheels, focbox holder, belts, motor pulleys).

@wapkoen there is also a couple of pics of the ALU case, so you can check it.

By the way, I removed the Calibers as I would need them in my next build, sorry about that.

Cheers!
