I found this but I can't confirm, seems like EU only. Thought I'd share it to the EU people. 

Or maybe someone could be a middle man for the US people. :grin:

Thanks for the heads up. Saw the 
Black carbon helmet for 200 euros on another site a few days ago and was close to pull the trigger. 160 euros is a steal. Seem to be just a limited amount left of each size.

Damn! Thanks for this, I need a helmet and just ordered the carbon pro and it should be on its way soon!

If anyone would like some help, I'll happily buy one and ship it out to you. I've been on this forum since March but I don't know if I'm allowed to offer such a service (I won't charge anything for my time, you just pay for the helmet and shipping).

Thanks again!

I'll try find it cheaper whilst I wait for his and my helmet to arrive.

Try parcel2go. I found shipping for my enclosures to Us and AU for under £15. Might be more weighty and sizeable though.

@Brianr058 and @Cobber I can confirm that tracked P&P will cost £15  for US and £20 for Aus via Parcel2Go. I'm assuming package is 1.2kg and 45x45x45cm.

Check out that the cost of helmet is covered by the postal insurance. Might be worth the extra tenner to cover up to 200 quid.

How accurate is the sizing guide for these helmets, do you know? According to muir.. L equals 58-60 cm head circumference and XL 60-61. 

I'm around 59.5, so not sure which is the best fit. I'm usually between 7 3/8 and 7 1/2 when wearing baseball caps.

do lots of research bro, the TSG PASS sizes small at best, the carbon version even more so according to reviews.

prob. fair to say you will need to size up... how much will depend on the shape/size of your head

I think and this is just speculation that the helmet shape is a little more oval than round for aero... this makes the fit strange for wide head shapes but I am not sure. Some people have found sizing up 2 sizes to still be small, some have sized up 1?

This helmet suits my head and if I was to compare it to a motorbike helmet that suits me then it would be Arai. Oval rather than pumpkin head!

thanks. Yes, I've read previous posts with pple on here finding sizes being small. Those that usually have L needed XL aso.. (research is all I do :smile: spending more time reading on these forums than I spend time with my family lol) 

Didn't know if the sizing guides were inaccurate or not though.

Thanks, I'll be sure to offer it when I price things up.

At the moment I'm taking orders, buying the helmets and once they arrive I'll ask for money when I have an exact figure for P&P service they'd like.

Keen to know how accurate the chart is too as I'm basing my size on it.

@Cobber @DilatedPupils and @Brianr058, I messaged Tittus yesterday asking for some information regarding shipping and they emailed me the following:

'Hi Youssef,

Yes, our warehouse was closed on Tuesday and Wednesday this week due to holidays. Therefore, your helmets should be shipped sometime today. We estimate that it will take between 2-3 work days for a shipment to arrive in the UK, so you should expect them sometime next week. You will receive an automated email with tracking info when the items leave our warehouse.

 

Let us know if you have any other questions!'

If you'd like the tracking number for these deliveries to my place let me know and I'll PM them to you. They should be here for Saturday or Monday (I'm praying its the weekend).

Once I've got them I'll send photos if possible and PM costs I'll need you to send to me before shipping. If you'd like to spend extra so your package is insured with the couriers let me know (I'll add the price for that too).

Otherwise, if I don't have em yet, could you PM me your names, addresses and contact numbers please? I want to post the helmets to you as soon as I get them.
```

I'm so frustrated and part of me is destroyed. Order four helmets and sent three to the other guys whilst I wait for the last one to get to me...

They fucking lost it! I'm livid! At best I'll get my money back since Tittus has sold out. 

If anyone finds a good deal for a TSG pass, please hit me up... I'm in the market for a new one now :frowning:

199 euro for the Pass Pro Carbon...not as cheap as titan but you can still save a few bucks on that one. Solid Pass are also on sale for 169 and 199 euros. Just dont know how shipping works with these guys...titan gave free shipping EU wide.
