Just saw your VESC video and the image of your "factory" is the "Center for Advanced Energy Studies" building of the university of Idaho. I doubt they are manufacturing your VESC, so this is not cool to use.

Edit: Reverse google image search ftw ;)

So is the new VESC now more expensive than the previous enertion VESC? I don't remember it costing $179.

Hi Jason,

So if the platinium uses higher grade components that the normal grade VESC, can you elaborate in more detail on which component the cost is cut in the normal grade VESC ?
I thought that all Enertion VESC were not assembled in the USA. So what is the difference in the assembly process between the platinum and the regular VESC ?

In brief, what are the differences between regular and platinum ?

only the 1year replacement warranty is added - that is why you can add the warranty to an "old" VESC which will basically give you a "platinum" one. It is just branding not special components or anything.

the "old" one is still on the website. It is just the added warranty that makes the VESC a platinum VESC.

Although I have to say that such a warranty really does sound nice to have and the price is fair if you tinker with it a lot.

What I meant was that the VESC one month ago was $139 and now it is $179. Is that due to better components and the new manufacturer?

DIFFERNECE

NEW VESC - Every single onboard component is purchased from US-based suppliers.
OLD VESC - Most Components sourced in china, except a few parts that cannot easily be sourced that came from US

NEW VESC - Made in USA
OLD VESC - Made in china

NEW VESC - 1 Yr Replacement Warranty (platinum version)
OLD VESC- 60day warranty

NEW VESC - Made to IPC A-610 Class 2 Standards
OLD VESC - Fuck knows - china standards

NEW VESC - sexy black matte high quality PCBs
OLD VESC - Shitty looking PCBS made in china


**We are only selling one type of VESC from now on, they are all made in US.**

Option 1: No 1 yr replacement warranty ($129USD)
Option 2: "Platinum" Comes with 1 yr replacement warranty ($159USD)

**So for $30USD you get a 1yr replacement warranty.**

**What does that mean?**
If your VESC fucks up you get a new one shipped to your door immediately. Some basic evidence will be required. Like a screen shot of an error code, or some kind of photo showing melted parts etc.

they were $99USD (sales price since they were being manufactured & not shipping)

now they are $129USD - Shipping has begun so I have increased the price to the normal level.

or Platinum is $159USD - Cost more because it has better warranty

But why even bother with the added warranty when you got the VESC so cheap anyway?
It is not like you will definitely need it (or otherwise @onloop would have made a huge mistake by offering said warranty in the first place)

To me it seems like it's all @chaka's fault . Just kidding of course. :) He set the bar high and so now we have vesc's for around 160$ . But it is worth to pay more for quality components, then buy some Chinese crap.

I don't mind the price at all, just wish early supporters had more of a break, though it's a minor gripe. I wonder if this also means the enertion 300 day warranty no longer applies to the VESC. Or was that warranty only for mechanical parts.
```

## \#31 Posted by: Maxid Posted at: 2016-05-25T15:22:52.406Z Reads: 238

Well that type of warranty is something else completely. If something breaks you have to provide evidence that the fault was there from the moment you bought it and not due to misuse, wrong handling etc. - this applies after 6 months of ownership ("reversal of the burden of proof").
This can in no way be compared to the "no questions asked" type of warranty he is giving out right now.

This is great, but this now comes out to be more expensive than chaka's, plus shipping is cheaper on chaka's since he's based in the US. Plus chaka doesn't limit his warranty to 1 year. And the quality is yet to be known, since the masses haven't started using them yet (which can't be said about chaka's). So I don't feel incentivized.

Other issue is, vedder is almost done with v5, which will have some improvements I much need.

Bravo though for stepping up with the warranty option. Much needed option IMO.

First of all, I can't seem to find anywhere where Enertion promise a no questions ask type of warranty. If so taht would be great. 
Secondly in the European Union you by law have 2 years of warranty that provide you with full warranty. 
If the product gets defect within the first 6 months you just have to show the seller that the product is defect. After six months you have to prove that the product was already defect when you bought it. A defect also means that the product is made in poor quality that cannot withstand normal use. 

I therefore do not see much difference between this new type of warranty promised by Enertion versus the EU law. 

I would indeed just buy from @chaka  instead. He seems to be an honest guy with some good quality products who's made his business because of his love and passion for the hobby and not for the money (like somebody else on this forum).

Another thing to add about the warranty. Australian consumer law states something along the Iines that the seller has to offer 1 year of warranty/returns if the item is faulty or becomes faulty from normal use.

I think the point of this new warranty is that even if you screw up the VESC, it'll get replaced, whereas before if the VESC died from something you did you were done.

Am I correct in assuming if you set up the vesc correctly or use the default settings with enertions motor and never touch it, and it breaks not die to user error, wouldnt it be replaced anyway?

For fucks sake! He's offering a paid warranty for replacement within a year. Ever shopped at an electronics store? It's a service deal- that's it. If you don't want it, you don't have to buy it. Don't want to pay extra for the shitty dinner salad? Don't! You will still get your meal.

Hey @Jebe

looking into this for you, if you have the instant replacement warranty it gets replaced, you don't need to return it. It's a very simple process. 

_The only possible reason there is not a fast/simple resolution is if your case has some out of the ordinary circumstances...._ 

Otherwise, I can only assume there has been some misunderstanding or communications problem. Will update you ASAP.
