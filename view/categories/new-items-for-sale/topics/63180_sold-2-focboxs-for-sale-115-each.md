Have two focboxs for sale, both brand new.  
Have only been tested to make sure they are working and update to Ackmaniac firmware. 

€115 each. Take both and I will include a new extra bluetooth module I have that can be used with Ackmaniac VESC Monitor app

They have been updated and tested to be working. 
Have never been used and are for sale now because I have replaced them with 2 ESCapes.

I also have a Never summer 2016 deck with a Eboosted enclosure that I am looking to part ways with.
Don't have time until next week to get it out and take some photos so If interested PM me for more details.

No Enertions "Warranty" is only 60 days.  They have been sitting on my desk waiting to be used for longer than that.
