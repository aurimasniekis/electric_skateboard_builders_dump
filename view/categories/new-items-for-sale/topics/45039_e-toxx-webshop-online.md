Yes with an Adapter like this : 

APS Adapter : 
![K800_P1030122|666x500](upload://pY5kXiuEpjVbWImuwCFSvBZS4Us.JPG)

Similar i got for Leopard 8072 ... but not anadozized actually

With the Stainless Drive it was possible to fit 8085 Aliens, not absolutely sure if this is still possible with the thicker Aluminium One...

leopard 8072 will fit for sure :

Bro ... Dont be shy with Black colour its an fkn MTB... stealth is not possible :sunglasses:
In the end i think its easier to implement Halls inside the Motor then mounting the encoder
This will be a different game on a bad Inrunner :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Thans Dude,

yeah have an look at Alien APS ... many different options.. also a special Edition with 10mm Shaft, 3mm Keyway, 165kv and Sensors : 

http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/aps8072s-sensored-bldc-motor-165kv-6000w/

The Leos are not sensored, and i destroyed one ... but used them for around 2 years so no problem

Yeah I’ve had quite a few technical issues/injuries which have prevented me from riding hard.  HOWEVER, I’m desperate to ride it and I’m gonna make a couple of mods this weekend and take it to the dirt park and I’ll make sure there’s a video with a couple of big jumps for you!  

And YESSSSSS let’s get an ESK8 ride/party organised – would love to drink and ride with my eMTB brothers!  :metal::beers:

Awesome work man, can't wait for my black direct drive kit to arrive :slight_smile:

Do you have any recommendations on specific APS 63mm motors to go with the kit? 

Sensors seem like they'd be handy to have but I'm concerned that they're usually not waterproof and I might end up frying the sensors/VESC's when riding through puddles etc?

What you wanna do brother with around 700KV ? EDIT : 520KV still HIGH
I fittet the SSS56114 on a Flame Truck with a Chaindrive, i doubt that it can be done on the Direct Drive... of course it could with an extendet Truck (-;

Tanks Michael, hope it arrives soon!
APS 6484 - 170kv is a killer, but also the 74mm length is great...
With sensors you will have more possible failure points, but also more ride comfort.

You know i´m playing around with Inrunners as well Brother...

About the Ronins, i will do a new batch, maybe with some changes.... we could discuss (-;

But i really have to say absolutely "jealous free" that @chaka mounts for the Ronins are an unbelievable masterpiece.. the Mount with the beared pulley and all features is Killer .. RESPECT

They are choice kit :kissing_heart:

From what I've heard, Ronin is discontinuing their last generation cast trucks and switching over to making cast version of their new Katana design. And...apparently from what I've seen, they've shortening it so the longest one their going to offer is 174mm and not 180mm like the old one.

I sure as heck hope I heard wrong though...

EDIT : its now 165mm....not 174mm...

But in the End the Truck is to short for Dual Motors anyway...

No they are not the old prolites, they are the new katanas. The impression I got is the cast will be the same from when I had emailed Tony.

I was referring to the katana prolites.

According to their website, the cast katanas are going to be different from the old cast trucks.

Doesn't really matter in the end, Jens already stated that his mounts can't fit dual rear motors on ronins. Would have to look at other mounts that are of a thinner profile than Jens'.

EDIT : Scratch that, might be possible to do dual rear...but will have to remove the idler, use 9mm belts and XX54 motors...

These drives are finest esk8 porn, love it! :heart_eyes:

Are the normal direct drives still the best (most bulletproof) choice for 8" offroad MTB?

Beside the fact that you need lower kv motors the only disadvantage I could imagine is maybe more wear on the wheelspur due to less teeth and more force on teeth because of 1:4 gearing (and no upgrade to 80mm motors possible).
```

Hey

Yap still would prefer a Regular Direct Drive for pure MTB use.
Higher Gear Ratio, stronger housing.
As you pointet out no 80mm Motors with the Mini.
I dont think that you will regocnize any "more" wear on the Mini.

I see the Mini for all Hybrid Builders... the mix of Street and Offroad... also if you plan to use mainly 7inch for commuting i would definitely choose the Mini Drive... on 7Inch you alredy got around 40mm ground clearence

Fantastic shop and products.  Great work.

What are the pros and cons of each setup (Belt, Chain or Direct Drive)?  I imagine Belt is quiet but less efficient and belts can get damaged.  Chain is similar but bullet proof and chains don't stretch.  Direct Drive is noisier but more efficient, bullet proof and responsive?  

What would you recommend for a street / urban carver?  Would you recommend something different for an off road mountain version?

Many thanks.

@gbutcher
Thanks Gary, glad you like it.
Belt is great for Streetsetups, also Offroad with dry dirt is absolutely okay IMO... you get problems with a unsealed belt in wet and muddy conditions... autumn europeen woods are full of fallen leaves and mud and will kill your belts fast... 

Chain is not that silent like a belt, but fully offroad compatible, smaller interference contour to the ground caused due the smaller width of the chain... if a chain break or jump of it can block the wheel, this could be dangerous... the new Chaindrives which listed in the shops is with ISO-06 Chains which are not prone to break.. big bad stuff (-:

Direct Drive only downside IMO is the noise, its louder then Belts for sure. Some people think it sounds like a Jedi Fighter (-: other say its a bit annoying.. for me offroad it was never a issue... for street i would prefer something more stealthy... in generell you get with the Direct Drive a heavy duty super drivetrain, sealed, compact and strong as hell... even with 80mm Motors and sick ESC Settings i was not able to kill the gears... no WAY ... i would except thousends of kilometers

Two Direct Drives actually : 
Regular has 1:5 Gearing, massive POM Housings, could be used also with 80mm Motors with adapters, 8Inch compatible, for pure MTB fun i prefer this.

Mini Direct Drive is 1:4 Gearing, lighter POM Housing... could be used with up to 6384 motors, compatible from 5Inch (Trampa Gummies) up to 8Inch... best drive for a Hybrid build
One for all IMO .. 

If you want a pure street machine i prefer the Street Carver with my Belt Drive on 107mm Abecs...
Hybrid Build i would choose the Mini Drive
Full Zombie Apocalypse Mode is with the Direct Drive on 8Inch

Up to You :sunglasses:

@barajabali
Most people uses white lithium grease 
Also Chain Lube Stuff from Bikes is fine
I actually use "archoil ar8300" .. expensice high performance stuff, dont know if it worth but Archie a rider from NY swears on it :

Thanks for that. I’ll check that stuff out, I was thinking of uses a motor oil because it’s pretty thin and can spread across the gears easily. It may even help with noise. Any thoughts on that?

Good discussion about lube, I’m also curious what’s best. Maybe an oil-based lube (which doesn’t harm rubber/plastic) stays longer on the gears than a thicker grease but maybe the grease kills more noise and is better against wear than oil because of more material. But I have no idea :laughing:

Now I feel like I should conduct a test. I was thinking motor oil because it’s thin, you wouldn’t need a lot of it in the gear box, maybe half a cup or less. The oil will be whisked around in the gearbox when the wheels spin which would cost every surface, protecting and suppressing sound (I think) and motor oil would add almost no drag since no it’s so much thinner than grease.

@Nowind would motor oil drop out of a direct drive or is it pretty well sealed given that it is installed properly?

motor oil is too thin, soon as you hit high rpm it will be on the case. also it may contain stuff that will degrade the pom.

Yea but it’s thin enough that it will pool to the bottom from gravity and the main gear will pick it right back up. 

I think this whisking action is exactly what this direct drive needs.

Would need a gasket in the case to try. I'd do some research on what POM is compatible with. Lithium grease or wax is ok from memory, but some oils with cause the POM to break down.

Motor oil should be okay. I wish I had a piece of Pom other than my gears to test with

Do you/will you sell replacement gears for the direct drive and what would a set cost?

Got replacements of course... wheelspur 65€... motorspur 25€ ... 

You ride 2000km in 5month? You can do long term testing... document your rides via Gps... if you kill your gears in one year ... about 5000km... you get complete replacemeent kit for free :slight_smile:

Good deal. I'll save up some cash and will get back to you.

Yes, I do around 2000 in 5 months. Only shitty weather holds me back (drizzle & light snowfall is ok). To work and back is around 20 KM and I often go on 30 KM trips during the weekend (hilly area with dirt roads & height differences of 500 meter).

Belts lasted around 200 KM, alu wheel pulley around 400 (switched to steel..will see). Replacement belts & wheel pulleys alone has been somewhat expensive, thus looking to switch to either chain or direct drive for my next build (also cause belt drive is just impossible in the snow).

You can get cute with oil if you know what the friction modifiers, acids and added metals are. I used to run my motard and dirt bikes on synthetic diesel oil bought by the barrel instead of the gallon. Commercial oils are not just oil.
A oil bath will make the drive quieter, but then the gear is swimming through oil so it will cause more drag.

Hydraulic oil, transformer oil and tallow are all rated "c" as poor according to the above link. Anything caustic was rated as not recomended at all. I had done some research on some academic engineering papers initially, their std would only be to use "a" or highly recommended lubricant. In that context you could use the above in diy with a accepted rate of failure. Where as the engineer accepts no perceived failure.

Good point regarding the sideload...and the price. At this point, I'll take the noise for granted. But dangit, quiet direct drive will be a heaven for most.

I guess everyone who is making geardrives for esk8 is looking for helical gears but unfortunately they are hard to source. Either they are very expensive or only available in large quantities... 

So I did some R&D and manageds to machine my own helical gears. Specially tuned to match the same axle distance as the gears used in Jenso's DD.

These are a 1:1 drop in replacement. Put them in and ride smooth and silent.

Next level, what helix angle are these gears? If the ratio between radial and axial force is lower than a given number, there are no problems or effect in life cycle, I don’t remember the exactly number, but in the SKF design manual all procedure is explained to calculate to account for side loads with spherical bearings

Please make a video of them side by side when possible!!!

They have 22.73 degrees helix angle. This is the skew you need to get exactly one tooth twist on the given width of the gears. So there is always one full tooth engaged at any given time.

Glad I could make your day dude! Seeing your video made my evening 😁

Just fitted the new wheel pulley you sent me out - thanks again for that. I’ve noticed they actually do get quieter over time once they’ve been ridden a bit and settle in:

How many miles/km do you have on it? That's a massive difference already.

I think I will experiment with herringbone gears at some point in time.

Yeah crazy right! I’ve not ridden that far to be honest as most of the stuff I do is off-road or freestyle.  Maybe 100km? Mostly in circles 😂. I do land pretty bloody hard on them though and I’m not the most gentle lover so I might have rounded a few edges! The old one still works perfectly though.

legend.  respect, Jens.

watching the video in my office, first reaction was 'obviously, will be quieter' 

and then the video started... and we just all sat here watching you ride on the widescreen.. stunned.. in silence 😂  nobody said a word lol

Jens, you may not realize it yet but you just raised the bar, for real, for all of esk8.  

'the bar' for great design in motorsports is raising safety **and** performance, at the same time.  

any fool can improve safety _or_ performance (I do it every day! ha); achieving both at once is very special.

thank you, Jens!  your innovation makes us all better.  order incoming. -karl

I have no idea if it is an issue or not and just read about this when looking up helical gears.

There is a Mini Drive for the Mbs made from stainless ... two videos online... 

 https://youtu.be/55qBOKH7ZJQ

@benjammin got one ...

 problem with the Matrix2 is that you cant mount a support bearing... also motorlenght is restricted

Also got some Aluminium Mounts like the Regular new Trampa drive for 1:5 gearing... but it seems i get clerence issues due the thicker mounts

Working on it... try to make it possible

No it supports both styles of gears against radial loads...
Helical may need axial support, just use thrust bearings they support both axial and radial forces.

Just catching up on this thread. I ordered the mini direct drive (SS) for my very first DIY build and have been extremely impressed with both the workmanship and professionalism that @Nowind puts into his products. 
I was trying not to get caught up in all the 'new' stuff on the market and was also trying to only have one board, but now with the helical gears (thanks @Duffman) I think I'm going to build a second board. That video that was posted above is the deal breaker - holy crap that is whisper quiet.

 Drove my Trampa with direct drive for the first time today. Previously owned a modded chinese mountain board.

Holy crap...the setup is awesome. Absolutely amazing how my throttle handling has changed. I need way less power to achieve the same speed and can just free coast all slopes, where I previously still needed to apply power.

2) call it "belt drive"
3) profit $

umm no, sorry

Some of us would like to use English to describe things like direct drive systems and have folks know we are not talking about gear drive, specifically because we said "direct drive".  This is what words are for, to differentiate some things from other things.

Today was "rethink how you installed this drive" day.

Almost all wheel spur gear screws came undone, which in turn caused enough angled force on the motor spur gear to move it sideways, causing it to hit the enclosure. Loctite 603 alone does not appear to be enough to stop sideways motion. Of course, it was still practically impossible to remove the motor spur gear.. Bought a bearing remover and pulled it off with force. An hour of fine sand paper and I could slide it back onto the motor. What a shit job. 

Jens mentioned using little loctite on these screws holding the hub and the gear together. I recommend using plenty 😁

Loctide 603 or 638 is not meant as an thread locker... its a adhesive for the pulleys/spurs/sprockets...  dont use it on Hubadapters or Housing Screws.

If this 638 stuff comes loose on your Spurgear you could have several issues which cause this:

Dont use old loctide, it gets bad afterwhile.... shake the shit before use

If your motorshaft is super polished use some grit to make it a little rough

Use brakecleaner before using Loctide, let brakecleaner complety dry !

Add enough loctide on both shaft and Spur, turn around spur on shaft to bring the stuff everywhere

Let it cure long enough i prefer over night, be aware to make sure it cant run in your motorcan ... so place spurside lower then can  ...and whipe of remaing loctide from shaft/spur... 

Dont do in cold or wet garage... better got some temperatures

Dont hesitate to use also the Grubsrew on a flatspot

If you make sure to follow this i hardly can believe that it dont holds up...

Cheers

Using brake cleaner on the pinion and motor shaft should be all you need to do before applying loctite 603 to the motor shaft. 

I initially had both of my pinions come unstuck from their motor shafts pretty quickly during use. After cleaning with brake cleaner then reapplying loctite, I've had no issues since.

Just a quick feedback on ISO6b E-Toxx wheel sprocket !
I did a battery upgrade (10S > 12S) so I needed to increase gear ratio to maintain the top speed.

Here is the upgrade :

E-Toxx 40T vs. Overion early prototype 34T
![comparison|690x460](upload://3hsVN68nD48JZKUDjKNLBSFRPuC.jpg)

![IMG_20180419_193002|375x500](upload://p8BsqQSxPz67PRdHNThrWwBZcgR.jpg)

![IMG_20180419_214249|666x500](upload://phXSGl2ALoJ9airfeQHl755IZl8.jpg)

Total weight saving : 2x131 = 262g
Not that much compared to the 3kg added (heavier battery + steering dampers), but less weight on wheels is more than welcomed to decrease inertia.

So, really happy with these chain sprockets !
I still thank @Yann from Overion who was the first to bring the strength of ISO6b on Trampa with this prototype.
The comparison with E-Toxx one sounds a bit weird though because :

* Different teeth number
* Final Overion design is lighter (early prototype on pictures)
* Comparison should be between universal models only (MBS+Trampa), also proposed by @nowind, a bit heavier too.

Hard to tell the difference while riding as I upgraded the battery voltage too... :stuck_out_tongue:

ISO6b is the way to go when it comes to such powerful machines as we ride now !
Many thanks @nowind and @Yann for being such innovators in this domain ! :heart_eyes:

Hi Pimousse,
Thanks for your feedback, E-toxx products are nice for sure👍
Overion’s products were the first batch created by me with « old school machine »😄
You can see the new one (from july 2017), which is lighter (210g) and better finishing than older, of course😂![image|666x500](upload://iURq3vewKdWrCoeIHIZEkb0tsRj.jpeg)![image|666x500](upload://eCaKH4p98ULkFDfu9yGG2apDGGp.jpeg)
Much lighter will be difficult as you can see (and mentioned) cause of the multiple adaptative hub possibilities (more than five different hubs can accept this product so it’s my choice to create a much more adaptable product than others to be able to sell it with a little price🤗)
As you mentioned, and i m happy with (thanks!) , I (Overion) was the first (since 2016) to sell ISO6B transmission and multiple adaptative wheel sprocket.
Concept was visibly so good ...others copied exactly (99%) Overion’s transmission products....

Lol @DanSkates  .. I would, but my wife likes my drivetrain too, she's in the background (barely) of one of those pics..  

Plus I just started building her an e-bike. She likes this stuff, just not coordinated enough to really enjoy riding a board. She was curious how this stuff worked, so I got the parts for the bike, but letting her build it, and me explain all the parts as well go. She does the same thing when I build boards, tries to understand my vision, starts out as a mess of work space, then turns into well.. you know. A skate baby is born while she sipped her drink. 

It's like that with all my hobbies though, and hers too. We're both generally curious to see each other's creativity.

Hey

Thank you all for best recovery wishes.

After 5 days at the hospital i'm back home.
Have to wear a spinal orthese the next 12weeks.
In 2weeks is a xray check, if the lumbar body stays stable there is no need for a surgery.

Happy that it looks good for complete recovery!
Hell man... 12weeks without any sports will let me need a quattro 80mm board to carry my fat body🤣

But better 12weeks then a whole life )-:

It happens by a chilled after work ride with my eATB on a small trail in the woods...

The wipeout was nothing scary compared to other ones i had the last three years, not one scratch but super strong pain around my lower back from second one....
Not much speed at all, maybe 20kmh.... loosed control on slippy underground and chrashed sideways on my back.... 

I was wearing full body armour as usual.... 

Bad luck with alot of good luck in the end

Keep calm guys, ride safe....

🍻

Im sure it could have been alot worse without a spine protector. I'm happy that it will be without surgery for you.  

I almost mailed you a get well gift with the return address on my order. But figured it would show to the shop and not the hospital.

**Why?**
Because it makes me sad to sitting here with workshop full of crazy boards and new stuff i cant ride, you know i rode nearly daily the last three years, not knowing how well the recovery is and with lots of pain i really drifted away.... painkillers-alcohol-netflix-druqz-playstation-VR-resident evil-GTA-more alcohol-more druqs-more painkillerz-BRAINFUCK... freaking bad times.. brake up my longtime relationship with my wife....trampa breaks up our buisness relationship....

If i still ride is a good question. Hardly to answer at this point. Lets talk about in 8 weeks!

If i still make things for Trampaboards is a easy question. FOR SURE !
Stop making parts is what they want with this action. NO WAY.
Things getting more complicated for the customer, EU people is easy to send their excisting hangers within a week for some bucks of shipping costs. 
US people is better to order hanger from trampa and let them ship to my place, we will see how long they will fullfill this direct customers orders (-;

For me its all more work, have to put only one customer truck at the CNC, could machine 5 in the same time but "hey" i will do with fun :sunglasses:

But of course i´m pissed, working hard on a Helical Drive for Matrix2 with some really nice benefics.
Putted my three last years in my fkn passion, eATB, always pushed Trampaboards as best base for that but in the end other mother also have nice looking daughters :joy:

Stay tuned

Then the hole vesc 6 drama with the Escape people, and now you. They simply only want you to buy their own ugly OVERPRICED motor mounts, lipo boxes etc. , Which people can not afford. Trampa is the weirdest firm i know.

Can't help thinking its short sighted not to collaborate more than fully with you Jens, your EATB kit more than matches theirs and i think anyone can see that's the case, i can understand wanting to protect or control product from their end but still.... 

JMO, i would have binned my whole design team to work with you, based on just seeing your product let alone seeing how much praise it gets from those lucky enough to have purchased your products. 

looking forward to the new MBS range and  "Escape Mount/case" for example... :wink:

trampa breaks up our buisness relationship
[/quote]

I think this requires a bit of background information before the Trampa name is tarnished further (beyond the whole VESC trademark thing). They have to realise that you are driving sales instead of taking it away. They must also realise that they will never sell many drive trains/complete ESK8 conversions with so many good/better alternatives out there on the market. There is no stopping that. They will never ever dominate the ESK8 MTB market.

So what is the point in ending this relationship? Are they selling hangars at a near cost? Are you as a single person buying out their complete stock? :grin:

Other than that, I hope you fully recover and get back on your board again. For me, it was awful enough not to be able to ride for 3 weeks after a crash. Also good to hear you will remain in business, despite of your personal issues.

@Nowind the main reason I have not bought from you is the fact that most of your drivetrains are for trampa… I don't and wont buy their products... HOWEVER if you make your own hanger and sell those with your drive trains, I would be one of the 1st in line to buy as @Sender said, their business ethics are kinda garbage

Yeah
i dont wanna start any kind of shitstorm
i dont wanna tell half of the truth

they offered me around a year ago after a nice meeting in UK to invest in Trampa, quitting etoxx, start developing stuff with and for trampa...... super nice offer.... i felt honored and happy about.... but first i got no big money to invest, second i dont want to quit etoxx.... its my baby.... my passion... not that big buisness stuff but my shit you know

i told them frindly and with respect imo, know the asked for working for them without investing money, i felt honered again, thought about, decidet that i still dont want to quit was i started on my own.... told them respectfull imo....

then the problems start:
no more Vertigo trucks/hangers for etoxx, low on stock, need them for completes... okay
we arranged that i can purchase Infinity hangers instead.. okay
this worked some time around a year, next little problems:
no more purchase on credit.... okay
no more purchase via paypal.... okay
no more purchase of hangers only.... only complete trucks. okay
created credit card acount.... ordered... dont get my stuff .... after 2weeks and 3 mails trampa told me: no more interrest to supply a competioner, that they offered me nice coorperation which i denied, that they need their hangers for completes.... and that they dont wanna fullfill this last order and cancel it..... yeah ... i dont answered.... needet some days with all the other bullshit which was going on..... 

imo the argument to say if they sell me hangers/trucks they dont have these hangers for completes is a two sided medal..... yeah a part of me understand BUT no one of my customers purchased a hanger from mine build it on another platform.... know what i mean.... for every fkn hanger they sold me they also sold a complete ..... most people just purchased a complete from them because its cheaper then order everything as single piece without ONE hanger..... so they also ordered one machined hanger from mine and got the other as replacement

yeah in the end i think they are pissed that i dont corporate like they offered, dont get me wrong it was a great offer.... if i would be another person with more buisness man attidudes i would have take the trampa hand.... but i´m just a passion driven little nerd who wants building the best eATB drivetrains :joy: and this without any compromise´s, being my own boss, producing every fkn part on my own small CNC in my small workshop, even if a storm blows away my fkn roof :sunglasses:

Thats it imo, hope i dont forget anything... dont wanna be a jerk, just wanna tell whats happens

hang loose

Interesting background story and it more or less confirms the kind of business they are running. It essentially contradicts the free spirited nature of what most of us associate this sport with. Yes, money needs to be made and a business needs to generate profit, but an appropriate behaviour is or rather should be a part of the business strategy. Right now, Trampa is slowly destroying their reputation (and I honestly wish they did not. Awesome decks).

I hope people will keep investing in E-Toxx products, regardless of any knock-offs or potentially similar upcoming products by Trampa. Others should remember where the first proper Trampa drive trains came from. Sometimes, supporting the smaller companies will keep innovation alive, instead of investing in bigger companies who tend to focus on other things.

Trampa clearly wants a monopoly and using quite a few dirty tactics to try to achieve that.

I wonder why they are incapable of designing this stuff in-house. Did all the good staff members who developed the original trucks leave?

Give a capable person access to fusion 360 and youtube, lock them away for a month and they can develop something 100x better compared to their current drive train.

My guess is though that they would have released these products at a much higher price. With current competition still in tact a re-design of any drive train is not going to be worth it. Trampa works with relatively large stock, which does not work in their favour (other expenses involved too that your one man band does not have to care about). They first need to kill or assimilate the competition before they can proceed selling drive trains at around 1000 EUR.

Sorry to hear all this Jens...
Hope you heal fast dude and hope you keep working on your awesome products with your head held high!
You should be proud of your product and what you've done to date, it's leagues ahead of the Trampa Drive Trains (and most others for that fact) and this is probably why they're throwing their toys out the pram!

Warning... Rant incoming!...
I had heard from Ted about their offer to you, and he did seem like he took it personally that you turned him down. They're also unhappy about the goings on with Kaly and believe he is 'messing with the Trampa brand'! As if anyone with a Kaly doesn't know it's a Trampa deck and doesn't buy spares from Trampa. Just think how many Wheels & Tyres Trampa must be selling to this market! I honestly don't know what they're playing at. As was mentioned, they think they have the right to a monopoly over any Mountainboard related items and they quite simply don't like that other people have started doing it better than them (i.e. you) or cheaper (i.e. stewii and the ESCapes). Even though all these products are still based around using the solid and reliable Trampa Decks/completes which as you say they are still selling to anyone that buys EToxx or Kaly. I really really don't get it and it quite simply saddens me.

Don't get me wrong, I've ridden a Trampa HolyPro (unpowered) for many years, and have been generally very happy with it. I still buy spares from them and I will continue to do so where I have no alternative. But now only my Deck and Trucks remain Trampa. MBS F5 bindings and MBS Rockstar Pro wheels are hands down much better than the Trampa items. They're not the only maker of Mountainboard parts even though they want to be. And bearings, fasteners and the misc electronics can all be easily sourced elsewhere. I'm not paying £26.50 for a set of bearings!!!

Mountainboards could really do with some new truck development anyway, so don't just look to making your own Hangers (as Kaly is doing) but maybe look to making your own integrated truck/drive-train system that can fit to any Mountainboard Deck?...

Sorry for the rant, I couldn't help it. Frustrations have been building and I'm not the only one.
Good luck with all your future endeavors, you have my full support (and as is clear to see, you have the support of many others here as well).

Hang loose dude!

P.S. I'm now very much looking forward to flying the E-Toxx banner and riding my E-Toxx driven board at all the UK events that also have a Trampa presence. They're not the only option!!!

I had heard from Ted about their offer to you, and he did seem like he took it personally that you turned him down. They’re also unhappy about the goings on with Kaly and believe he is ‘messing with the Trampa brand’!
[/quote]

Reeks of desperation. Seriously, the whole ''you buy this printer, so you have to buy our cartridges'' closed system approach does not apply to this market. Even if Jens joined Trampa, someone would have filled that gap..as people are filling the vesc6 price gap, etc. I could only imagine Trampa resorting to patent/trademark trolling if it ever comes to such a situation.

The wait is now for someone who creates matrix like trucks with the reliability of trampa trucks (that means, little to no plastic parts, but a truck shape that is easier to clamp components onto) and a composite deck with a concave.

It's called Matrix Pro rear trucks no ?
I can mount my trampa spring trucks hanger on all matrix 1 and pro trucks and I suppose Matrix base plate from trampa go on all matrix 1, pro or trampa hanger (with a bit of adaptation).
(I just downgrade to the Matrix 1 with the big bearing support against the cheap plastic piece that brake. But for sure the Metal top trucks for the matrix hanger looks better. I like that I can't deform it for all the time after a big shock ...

What a bummer!

Like nobody else I can’t understand what’s going on because you are the one who pushes Trampa with your beautiful builds and products which is extra money for them, I would call it win-win. I’m not sure if they realize that builders are highly inspired by people like you, guess why I have 2 Trampa boards.

I really like your decision about e-toxx and wish you all the best. You put so much love and passion in what you do, that’s really unique. I mean you design it, machine it and do hardcore testing with all your products until they are bulletproof. I’ve received some parcels from you so far and these are the best protected parcels I’ve ever received, trust me! They would survive a fall from a skyscraper, it’s great how you are bedding your babies.

Also I want to mention that the prices are not that high as it seems at first sight. There is so much work and material  involved. I know the pictures of your DD thread, remember the massive POM block before milling the housing, what a waste of material couldn’t believe it. If the products would be available in an external shop (via distribution) the prices would be minimum 2-3 times higher and nobody could afford it anymore.

It seems like I own one of your last machined Infinity hangers which you had in stock. Unfortunately it is too much bent and even with 3mm bushings it’s not a nice fit. I tried to get it replaced but Trampa refused it because it is already machined.

It wasn’t my intention to write this much, basically I just wanted to say welcome back, you are on the right way bro! :sunglasses:

Good to hear you're recovering and in good spirits despite these life challenges. You'll come back stronger and better. 💪 

And sorry to hear about your dealings with Trumpa. They are digging a nice hole to eventually bury themselves in. But, it's about time you come back from the dark side and start making parts for MBS. They are the true originators of mountain boarding anyway. 

And for your first new MBS project, you should design a beefy aluminum baseplate for the Matrix 2 trucks. I think that would be a hit.

Yes, wanted to get a hanger replaced which I bought machined from e-toxx. After purchase I told @Nowind about the problem with the hanger (but the last hanger was already sold otherwise he would have replaced it). He offered me to take it back and refund me or machine a replaced hanger for free. I tried second option because this is not the fault of Jenso and should not be his problem. I don't expect him measuring all parts with a caliper before machining :laughing: , seems like the quality control of the manufacture is not the best.

Ah, OK. Can't hold that against either party. Trampa needs to QC their manufacturing pipeline and it may have been possible for Jens to detect the issue prior to machining (as I understand it, he is the original buyer). Obviously, trampa is not going to replace a hanger that has been machined by a third-party. For all they know, it could have been clamped in an awfully weird manner or forces could have been applied otherwise.

Is there really a need for a upgraded matrix 2 baseplate? Has anyone ever seen or have a broken base?

I try my best to abuse those trucks but they hold up great.

In my eyes the nylon baseplate is better than any aluminium version. It is light, it is strong, it is cheap and if you have a crash that would bend your axle, only the cheap baseplate breaks.

On the matrix 1 trucks, the weld of the tube through which the kingpin runs is the weak spot. Lets see how long the matrix 1 can withstand my abuse...

The reports here mostly originate from Frank/Trampa. The story goes that those nylon baseplates will slowly become oval (around the bearing), especially the rear trucks due to the drive train. Another issue as reported is that they tend to crack during winter.

I don't have any issues with mine, but the plastic baseplates seem to be the only **_perceived_** weak point when people talk about the Matrix 2 trucks. Although, I don't think 99.9% of will ever manage to break one. But, it is a blingy upgrade that some will want, and could put that one argument to rest, so we can all move on from Trampa and their evil plot to take over the (eATB) world. 
Also, I'm sure that Trampa decks are near indestructible, but as @Arch has proven with their LaCroix board, concave, moderate flex, and less camber/arch are really what we need in our decks.

I feel the love and it feels good (-;
The spririt of DIY, this we make parts better and trail an error, the exchange of knowledge, sharing the passion, spreading the word.... really love it..... happy to be back

For the Matrix2, i think before machining modded parts for it, we all really have to find the weakspots.... know what i mean.... my matrixx2 is 2 years old, not that much ridden but there is no oval bushing or anything.... lets use it first, find weakspots, then we will find solutions for IT 
what you think?

Complete own Hanger / Truck .... yeah nice for sure.... i think as an OPTIONAL add on for people which can afford a custom milled precision truck super nice... but we need for sure a stock truck(maybe with improoved parts) for the most people.... eATB builds will kill your wallets hardly and not everybody needs a milled Truck

But i want both, stock Trucks, and crazy custom Modell

Cheers

Legend. Any words on turning radius compared to the softest trampa dampa? Maybe @Duffman can comment on that. 

Issue I had with the softest dampers is that during the first couple of rides, the stiffness was OK for high speeds but the turning radius suffered. Now, they have softened considerably and the turning radius is ok, but the stability at higher speeds has suffered. The riding characteristics are completely different as opposed to a fresh install (sucks).

I can't say much about the comparison to the Trampa spring/dampa combination because I run these on my MBS monster board. But on this one they were a huge improvement. A friend switched the springs/dampas of a nexxt truck to elastomers an is totally satisfied, he won't never go back. We are running these for over 2 years now and they show no sign of wear.

The main problem with spring/dampa combinations in trucks is, that the force increase over the tilting angle is very progressive. Unless you haven't a lot of preload on them, you have not much damping 'in the middle' when you are running high speeds. When turning the force you need to tilt the board increases very fast, which can make it difficult to turn on low speeds and/or without bindings.

When you are running soft dampas and highly preloaded springs, it can happen in sharp turns that the spring blocks and prevents any more turning and lets you trip over.

Elastomer springs have a low progression, and a big inherent damping factor (low rebound) which dampens speed wobbles before they occur. They also can not block, what prevents you from loosing balance in very sharp turns.

Wow never thought about that but I guess this is exactly one of my problems after over 1000km of squeezing the dampas. Since some time the steering feels "loose". Today I focused on the trucks/steering and recognized that they are very unstable and spongy at higher speeds especially on concrete Furthermore I had 2 speed wobbles at 40-45km/h which never happened before except when riding without dampas. Also it feels like the hangers swing from left to right at higher speeds, like a spring :wink:

Also what @Duffman wrote sounds good :clap:

It's a very precise way of controlling your board as it keeps track of your motor axle rotations with a magnet, so it's supposed to make for a better quality ride.  I belive Boosted Board uses these.  Check in the forum for the AS5047.

For the Matrix2, i think before machining modded parts for it, we all really have to find the weakspots… know what i mean… my matrixx2 is 2 years old, not that much ridden but there is no oval bushing or anything… lets use it first, find weakspots, then we will find solutions for IT
what you think?

The shitty worst weak spots you could get **even before riding them**, is the fucking 2 backs bolts with not complete hole partern in the plastic/nylon part of the trucks. **This FKN ripped bolt !!** Every time I try to mount a matrix 2 trucks it happened. This painted set of screw/bolt is not helped too I guess, even with good quality it ripped...

Yeah I had same problem, fkn nightmare if the holes aren't perfect. Had to trim the plastic back a little bit to use a wrench to hold them. Pain in the ass! Other than that though these trucks are the shit, super stable at speeds anyway. Stoked they widened the wheelbase.

Another thing,
I got Matrix 1 spring channel type trucks too, and my eggs/dampas are absolutely not in touch (preloaded), I got 1 or 2 cm just working with the spring itself and then if I carve more comes the eggs resistance.
It's really weird ... at speed. You turn easily with it at low speed but I think a full and progressive experience of riding should be a lot better !!.. Plus the MadMax Style !!

Received the elastomere dampers, they are also shorter than the uncompressed springs which makes it easier to install. Here a comparison:

![123105|690x388](upload://w71fLZU5gQQmoPu0i6IKgOuAU8P.jpg)

Will mount the dampers on MTB but to get a feeling for them I mounted them on inner spring position on my unfinished urban carver. On the rear truck I mounted new springs and new yellow dampas also in inner position for comparison.

![130903|690x388](upload://kIpmGeM3v5TqJOzB7ZUu2rTZ08.jpg)

It's hard to describe (also I didn't ride the board), I guess the turning radius is about the same as springs with yellow dampas but I have to test it tomorrow on MTB and let you know. What I can say so far is that the dampers feel different, smoother and more stable or in 2 words: I like :sunglasses:

I returned from my first 20km ride mainly concentrating on the characteristics of the elastomere dampers and their limits. 

Holy sh** they are fu***** great motherfu**ers :grin:

[quote="telnoi, post:266, topic:45039"]
Any words on turning radius compared to the softest trampa dampa?
[/quote]

The turning radius is better 
It is easier to steer, feels a bit like a longboard truck, very smooth. At higher speeds (40-45 km/h) it is still stable but more sensitive than springs with yellow dampas but feels safe. If you put more pressure on the dampers you can do crazy turns even at slow speeds. I rode on concrete, grass, gravel and on BMX track. I'm afraid I'll wear down my tires faster in the future because of hardcore carving :laughing:

Because it's hard to describe I wanted to shoot a small video tomorrow showing what they can do. Unfortunately 1 brand new bushing broke within 20 km on the rear hanger so I'm not sure if I can make it tomorrow, need to do some further inspections first.

I won't go back to springs

Will be moving to 12s this weekend (10km/h faster), so more stability is good. 

Don't get how you destroy your bushings so fast though. Still got the original ones. Might have something to do with me riding unsensored? Practically no torque at low speed.

I did it :sunglasses:

Elastomere dampers at different speeds and terrains. There is no pre-tension on the dampers in this video, maximum turning ability. The time of hopping is over.

https://youtu.be/S1ezP3P8HSg

Just to help others because I didn’t mount them properly.

Glue the M8 grub screws with red Loctite into the thread of the dampers (the aluminium part, no idea what’s the name, @NoWind called it rounded sexy shit)

![110548|690x388](upload://akoK3mrjwI4wlKHmkXSfC9PRzjZ.jpg)

When it’s cured you can insert it from bottom into the thread of the baseplate and adjust the pre-tension later from top, just like springs.

When mounting/dismounting, the rounded sexy shit on top remains there. Just tighten/loose the bottom screws and take the elastomere with bottom sexy shit. I did it 3 times so far and it’s possible without clamps.

No speedwobbles at all, my top speed is about 45km/h (28mph) so I don't know what happens above. Without pre-tension it's more sensitive but no problem at faster speed for stability (I'm 74kg), I don't really carve hard above 40km/h anyway. I don't know yet how they feel at higher jumps but on mid jumps they feel good.

In general it feels more like a MTLB (Mountain Longboard) which is great, comfy and smooth.

True, sounds like a marketing joke but I'm just a happy rider :grin:
I haven't tried with pre-tension but for now it feels good, I iove the turning radius. With stable at speed I mean that it runs smooth without speedwobbles and feels safe but of course you shouldn't make big moves or start to dance. Just for comparison, a loose longboard truck is nice for carving but dangerous at speed (too sensitive on movements). With the dampers it's like a loose truck without being too sensitive at speed. If you are used to springs with stiff dampas it's definitely better with pre-tension.

Hey @Nemesis 
Nice wheelchair (-; doing 30mph on the road is not bad :joy:

Want to show this Mini Direct Drive, it comes with gear ratio of the regular Drive :sunglasses:
So you have the 1:5 Gearing in the small and lighter Mini Drive !
Works only for 8mm Motorshaft!

![K800_P1030946|666x500](upload://p3iIKv9ALwnx0B2Fq4QyYBUjmQM.JPG)

Also the thread inserts are now selflocking ones, hope that this will eliminate the problems that people have with too much Loctide, purple colour shows the selflockers

![K800_P1030941|666x500](upload://y6bt18p7ERu9aIXWw1qDrGHC8su.JPG)

Also it comes with the new 3D Printed Housing with integrated mounting solution for the AS5047 Magnetic Encoder.

I personally really love the new Housings, looking great IMO, with the Metal Inlay and 3D Contour
Yeah and of course its possible to have "Encoder Inside" with wire management, future shit :joy:
the "08" indicates the version for the 8T Motorspur ...

Okay cool thanks...
Is the STL for the 3d part secret ? And is it printet in petg or nylon ? The reason i ask, is because many have 3d printers now. And it would be a killer feature to buy your drive without the 3d printet part, to save some money, and then 3d print the part by myself in the right color scheme :-)

Maybe im blind, but i can't Find your new drive on your site ?

Yap its for regular MTB Hangers from Trampa, Infinity, Vertigo, Ultimate
Mini means that it smaller then our "Direct Drive" so you will be able to mount wheels from 5 to 8inch.... normaly it was 10:40 Gearing, but now its possible to go with 8:40, like written above!
Sidenote:
Its true it was build in the beginning for the Mini Truck, but i dont gone this way long because there where always to much clearence problems with the shorter Hanger.
Man, i´m full of missleading marketing :joy: direct drive is wrong, Mini is wrong, bad bad Jenso !

MBS parts should come in next week, i have 3 Beta Testers who will get them first for some feedback.
Its correct that the MBS Matrix2 dont need the machining, its a big advantage for the customer IMO, but it needs another special part to allow the Support Bearing on the shorter axle... this part will add more costs compared to the Trampa Drive... but you will have the benefiz of a wider track.
So in short words, we try to get it on the same price level like Trampa, even with more parts!

No dude i think you get something wrong. you got a regular Mini Drive, with 10/40 gearing, keyways all will be fine.... my comment was directed to this new Beta Option to get a 8T Motorspur inside the Mini Drive for 1:5 Gearratio... and on This 8T Helical is not enough remaining material for Keyway.. okay ?

Okay Dude :rofl:

Our Development Department aka @Duffman designed something thats very well known by regular skateboards but not that common by ATB´s 
Angled Risers :sunglasses:

![K800_P1040002|666x500](upload://3e0SiuMU5Oj901RB7jMbGWfbsKx.JPG)

![K800_P1040001|666x500](upload://e1kL3RmA8fcNSyH47w1azOvZC4u.JPG)

![K800_P1030988|666x500](upload://lUGnyLWOtr3DPYcEJGZGwoUezJG.JPG)

![K800_P1030987|666x500](upload://hUTCbjEw1jPVbbioCdTghT6ZY8D.JPG)

Also available for MBS Matrix2 : 

![K800_P1030997|666x500](upload://tIHfWlN5KKxOrFyIfP6ePRNH2I.JPG)

![K800_P1030996|666x500](upload://fz574mS6bBL1b6ezha0VBsIy0Lr.JPG)

We got them in following dimensions : 
+5 degree
-5 degree
+10 degree
-10 degree
5mm parallel Riser
10mm parallel Riser

"-" will decrease your Truck angle
"+" will increase your Truck angle

So you for example : 
on 15degree skate deck use +10degree riser to have more steering by using Spring Trucks
on 30degree MTB deck use a -5degree on the rear truck to give you more stability

Its just something which will you allow to play around with different setups.
Easy and cheap for 10€ a pair to finetune your ride.

Yo Bro!
Looks awesome, will check out your store.

I'm tempted to see what 45/25 is like, like on my ronin billets.

Do you think adding more angle will add stress to the shitty little plastic bits on a trampa truck? (my only hesitation)

I'm running those printed angled risers for years now on my monster board, as I always had decks with too less tip angle. I don't think that this would affect the lifespan of your bushings as the load is the same, just the load vectors are distributed differently.

On my raceboard with Matrix II trucks, I used them to fine tune the steering behaviour. Now it turns just tight enough to get around every corner and is stable up to speeds above 50kmh.

Those wedges and risers risers are printed out of the same hard, but flexible tpu of that our driveguards are made of. They will egalize surface imperfections of the deck and the trucks but will withstand any abuse you do to them...

:laughing: true, R.I.P.!
For offroad and jumping the brass bushings are too rigid IMO, also it's metal on metal. I crushed them within a few rides and jumps in dirt park (had them on both hangers). But for a street setup it could work better. If anyone wants to try them I have a set of brass bushings left for free (2mm base).


Really nice angled risers I think many people were waiting exactly for that :clap:

Mobu, I think the trick will be to set the deck up similar to how you would a motorcycle...
I and I recommend you get on your eMTB/ATM what ever you kids are calling it and measure the tip angle with you on it!
For me when I stand on my board the center compresses and the tips decompress. I ride a 17 ply so maybe mine is less than you, but I am also 6ft2 and over 100kg so... best you test for your self.
I'm also going to work on some kind of g-force loaded corner test as when you carve the deck is loaded even more and the tip/truck angle comes up further again.

I think -10 degrees out of the rear will be minimum. 

GL let me, us know how you go?

Been thinking playing with the angles on the trucks would be the next step to exploring Stability Vs Carvability on mountainboards...
Definitely think reducing the angle on the rear truck would be great for long distance road riding.
Might have to try some :yum:
And maybe get a bullbar :thinking:
And the elastomer dampers :smirk:

You can send me your hanger if you are inside EU.
If you outside EU i suggest to order one hanger only from Trampa and give my adress as shipping adress. This is the fastest and best way actually for non EU customers.

The machining of the Hanger dont cost you anything aslong you purchase a Drivetrain.

Yeeaaaaah !! Looks like everything is back in stock :P **MBS, MBS, MBS !!!!**

Haaha, once again - mind connected ;) 
Did the same in rubber seens last year on my [proto Ica AT](https://monlongboardelectrique.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/img_20170804_001310.jpg).
And as you could read on my Darth buildlog, its what I was running and testing for the WheelGames, still finding some perfect angled with my 20° tips deck. 10° seams perfect, 20° was a bit too much but it carse way better for sure!

If Trampa wants to kill the DIY market why not push for other MTB brands like MBS and leave trampa behind where they belong?

I wanted one for a long time but they seem to not want customers with their practices. I'd like to make a MBS set up in the future

Yeah we will consider, why not (-;

I addet Parts to the webshop, i tryed to split Parts in different Kits.
Like a more Budget Entry Kit with straight gears, upgradable 

Also the option to save money with not anadozised Parts

Export Prices (non EU)
355€ MBS – Mini – Encoder Lid- 10:40 –RAW- Regular Gears (non Support Bearing)
500€ MBS – Mini – Encoder Lid-10:40  – Helical Gears –RAW- Truck Extensions 2X 
45€ MBS Truck Extensions2X for upgrade Kits on Rear or Front
40€ more for Anadozised Kits

Would be nice if you guys give me some feedback on the Shop desrciption,
is it clear and good to understand or missing something?

Hey Dude,

Motor looks great, 6384, sealed, sensored, 8mm Shaft, cool i like it.

Yeah we will, its just nicer for average customer not to mess up with the required modification of the AS5047 Development Board. Its no rocketscience but for unexpierenced builders maybe better to get the Encoder ready to go.

@Nowind what's the purpose of the metal inlay? if I understood correctly you are not using a rubber seal between the housing and gear, is that right?

I ask because I'm finishing the design of my drive train and will use a rubber seal mounted on a 3D printed housing that will make contact with a metal space that is attached directly to the gear

I bought a holypro in a non Trampa store because it was cheaper. I received a mail from the store informing me that they need to re order the deck. When they reordered trampa decided to raise their prices.The shop had to sell me the deck at loss or with a very small margin... On the site the deck was sold for 255euro.The day after they needed to raise their price to 309euro...it seems trampa doesn't want anyone buying there stuff if it doesn't come from their own store.

That's perfectly fine and good for consumers because it cuts out the middle man that usually only wants to make some profit as well. Not allowing me to send a product I paid full price for is a di** move however and hopefully bites them in the a** at some point. Me personally for example refrain from buying a Trampa and actually consider Trampa builds some sort of "bad" like when people buy cheap clothing brands with known bad quality. They are definitely not "cool" in my esk8s world - if you know what I mean. It's gotten to a point that I was really sad when respected members like @whitepony got a Trampa :cry:

Actually i have no direct 80mm mount for the gear drive on MBS truck.
I got the Maxi Gearbox ready but this would work only with adapters for 80mm and this will cost too much motorlenght.... 
I could machine mounts for it, if you are willed to preorder and wait 6weeks no problem.

How much would it be for a helical Maxi setup, with hub adaptors and bull bars in black or raw where not available and I will get them anodised myself? Also would need to send my truck for machining.

Dear @trampa. Stop screwing over your own customer base. Those who buy drive trains other than yours would never consider your esk8 related parts, other than the board itself.

I would have never bought a trampa if it were not for the availability of third-party parts. You can't control this market, you can only destroy your tiny piece of it...and your reputation. Nobody confuses an e-toxx for trampa and the other way around. Nobody confuses kaly with trampa. We all know and recognize your bloody boards and trucks.

Edit: @trampa I think I can speak for a lot of people here using your stuff. guys like @Nowind and @Kaly made us to buy trampa equipment, not your equipment made us to buy there gear drive and stuff they offer.it’s still 80-90% parts we order from you + spare + replacement etc etc. Why you make us the live just harder with things like this. Very sad story for me...

Actually most stores offering our gear don't have stock. They order the stuff from us when you order from them. If they have their prices funny, this is not our problem. For many years we haven't touched our prices, but now currencies go up and down a lot and raw material gets more expensive from day to day. 
Production costs simply go up and at some stage we need to adjust our prices to reflect that.

@Andy87  we have customers buying complete boards tax free and want us to do split shipping, hanger to EU destination and rest of the board to non EU destination. We can't do that. Once the purchase is made UPS labes are generated and invoices are generated and sent to our accountant. And who would pay for the extra shipping? We can't sell 1x postage without selling a product and we can't ship to EU destination if no tax has been paid.

Then we have customers wanting to buy a complete board, but ask us to deduct one hanger/truck from the purchase. We sell boards with 4wheels, two trucks, a deck and a pair of bindings. We can't deduct a hanger from the purchase of a complete board with ease. It's called complete board for a reason... Our system does automatic stock deduction. 

If a customer has a DIY project on the boil, it's up to the customer to organize the project. We can supply the components you need and ship them to your home address or another address within the same country. We can't organize split tax, split shipping, semi complete board purchases. We try our best to serve our customers and fulfill special orders. In order to stay efficient, we have to draw a line somewhere. In the end everyone wants the purchased product fast. We can't block ourselves with to many complications and paperwork that goes along with that.

In this case i totally agree with you @trampa !
So it means if I buy a hanger only (with tax) just the hanger and pay my shipping you will continue to send them out to @Nowind s  adress?
Because that’s all I want. I don’t want you to split any of your complete sets you sell etc...just don’t stop selling or sending hangers or trucks over to Jens.

So @trampa, perhaps we could investigate a way to implement "regulations" for the buyer that states before purchase rules like no shipping externally or whatever may be required. No matter what, I think the worst action to take is doing something, without taking the proper process of first warning your customers, and then going forth to go behind their back and negate a purchase to @Nowind.  I know that you guys face hardships, I really do, but brand image is key, and a HUGE aspect of brand image is communication with the customer. 

If you can't do this

[quote="trampa, post:439, topic:45039"]
we have customers buying complete boards tax free and want us to do split shipping, hanger to EU destination and rest of the board to non EU destination.
[/quote]
then email the customer and tell them, we can't do this, what would you like us to do instead? 

or if this happens 

[quote="trampa, post:439, topic:45039"]
Then we have customers wanting to buy a complete board, but ask us to deduct one hanger/truck from the purchase.
[/quote]

email the customer, tell them that unfortunately this cannot be done, but instead, they can purchase the independent components and pay an assembly fee to achieve the same result.  

You guys have a great product, which works wonders for you, and customer service is difficult, but you can make any situation work. and if you remember anything, its COMMUNICATION

Interesting conversation, my main question is why @trampa stopped selling hangers directly to @Nowind? 

Because people won't stop buying E-Toxx parts  and everyone involved is a looser and not a winner anymore.
Let's say e.g. 20 people are buying a gear drive and need machined Trampa hangers. In the past Jenso ordered this 20 hangers, got 1 parcel and could machine them at once. Customers could order a machined hanger with no additional shipping costs and waiting time. And Trampa had just 1 order to send without any needed communication or customer support.

Situation now:
20 people send Trampa an e-mail before buying asking how they should buy with 2 different addresses or split order or whatever question. Or just place 2 orders with different shipping addresses. Trampa has to handle, pack and ship 20 parcels instead of 1 plus customer support. The customer has to pay more shipping costs and has to wait until the hanger reaches E-Toxx and gets machined. @Nowind doorbell rings 20 times receiving 20 single hangers which need to get machined. This takes more time and is a hassle.

For me this sounds like a big mess for everyone, and everone is loosing money and time.

split shipping doesnt account for barring sales and shipping to @Nowind's address. Nor the cold shoulder after he turned y'all down. I had a complete build ready to go from u guys until i started reading about how u cut off Jens, and ur business practices and attempt to corner the e-mtb  scene by strong arming the little guys, threatening legal mumbo jumbo etc... I have since moved my business to VENOM and MBS for my mountainboard needs

So you mean, you will change your hanger design so that they fit @Nowind gear drive???
😅 that would be awesome...

But I guess your argument goes more in direction „we made our own gear drive“ or...and that’s I hope no, you mean „you guys can just fuck up and stop buying my stuff than you don’t have a problem with a hanger“ 

@trampa if you don’t mind it would be nice if I could get an answer to my question I asked above.
In case i buy a hanger or full truck with taxes and pay shipping, you still would sent it out to Jens adress?
Would be nice to know, because if this is a problem for you I can save my money on the back and forth shipping and just get a set of matrix2 trucks.

Funny prices ? The prices were the same as on your site except that the shipping costs were less...Also it doesn't explain why the prices only went up for the Trampa resellers. When checkin on the Trampa site the prices remain the same. Resellers , stores or whatever you call it need to be informed beforehand when you are changing your prices. No Trampa reseller , vendor or whatever could possibly just guess that the prices go up.I agree with some members here that communication is the key. Other brands have understood that and i really hope that Trampa will also. I love my Trampa deck and trucks but hate your business practices so much.

**I feel like riding on the puff, or even quieter !!**
During the testing, we could just hear mostly the Kart extractor ventilation, my finger on the cam, the wind, and a bit the motor! Fkn crazy bro !!!
I'm in love, can't wait to make mine :v::heart_eyes:

And thx @Pimousse, you could run with him maybe the WE ! ;)

Is there any reason to choose the regular over the mini drive, except the larger ratio? 

I'm worried 25mph won't be satisfactory for a top speed with 170kv motors and Urban treads (6.5in) wheels

The step down from 1:5 to 1:4 would give me a top speed of around 31, 32 I think.... That's pretty good :) 

Would you guys recommend it?

Regular drive (1:5) is meant for 8" (or 9") wheels and offroad use. With 6.5" you would have too less ground clearance so the mini drive (1:4) is best for 6.5" or gummies or 8" on street builds. If you want to ride in peace and silence go for helicals :grin:

If you wanna go with 80mm Motors for example.
For most applications i would choose the Mini Gear Box.
LIghter, more groundclearence, down to 5inch wheels.
And with the 8T Motorspur you get the 1:5 Gearing (-;

[quote="deucesdown, post:507, topic:45039, full:true"]

Nope
you can have 8 or 10 or 12 mm Motorshaft in Mini Drive with 10T Motorspur.
ONLY 8T Motorspur is limited to 8mm Motorshaft

But better in terms of noise will be 3.3V, but 5V will work great!

too long shaft is never a problem. you can always cut it or yes get the new spacer plates he sell.

I linked the specs of the 6880 in the post before. You can just double check the length of the shaft. Than you know if it will work with or without modification/spacer.

if heli or straigth shouldn´t be a difference in shaft length.

the 6880 has the same bolt pattern like 6374 motors.
you need only and adapter if you use 80xx motors.

Could you make one that has a little trailer hitch ball for towing other people or trailers? Maybe with a retractable tow rope for Boosted group rides? :rofl:

Seriously though, I have been wanting to look into getting a infant bike carrier trailer so I can take my one-year-old skating with me, and this has me thinking more about a real world towing device of some sort. Although the brass knuckle look is pretty cool. You could epoxy in an LED to each one of the holes and wire it up to have the largest, most ridiculous battery meter. Or bolt a carbon spoiler to it for that ricer bling. :thinking: Ok, I'll stop now. Seriously though, I think this is a much-needed accessory. There's not really a good place to grab the rear with these gear drives. I've just been using the rear binding, but this seems much better.
