I am offering a soldering service for batterys, prices may variate for the amount of cells/batterys/orders, since the more batteries i get, the less i pay.

At first ty @Okami for this information: 

**GUYS: SOLDERING DOES NOT DAMAGE YOUR CELLS IF DONE RIGHT - EVERY QUALITY HIGH POWER SYSTEM WITH BATTERIES IS SOLDERED.**

I solder with leaded solder tin and soldering flux at low temperatures and high wattage, the cells will not get damaged.

Available cells for soldering: 18650 & (26650) - LG-HG2/VTC5/VTC6/LG-HE2/30Q/

Cells can be placed directly after each other to make short packages, sealed with hot glue/silicone/gasketmaker or urethane, or they can be soldered with plastic spacers.

Available connector types: hilumin, nickel, copper and fuse wire (so the cells are fused directly)

connectors available: XT90/XT60/Dean's Ultra/EC5/Jeti(Hacker)/6mm Bullet (w/ 0,04 mOhm)/optional Antispark with (some of) the plugs

Possibility to ad a balancer or balancer wires without connector, since every bms got its own pin assignment - if you got the assignment, np

Sometimes i get some cells cheaper, right now 10S3P w/ 7,5Ah / 60A cont. - LG HE2 for 145.- for the lite version without anything but cables for connecting.

I can also add a charger with BMS so you just plug like a 12pin connector in your board and the batterys will be charged, this can save some space and lowers the danger of shorting components. 

for more, hit me up please!

I don't want to he rude or anything , but I think you have to be a level 3 to sell anything that is preorder. We have had a lot of new people with less than 50 days try to start there own business without knowing what there doing  or scam people am not saying that's you just its bin happening alot more lately

i did not see that, im sorry.

if this is not wanted i will delete the topic asap! just trying to help people get batterys b/c i know how long you're looking for someone that can do this.

Hence, i will provide pictures tomorrow and will add "trading terms"? i can also add list price and qty, but since there are like 100 combinations of batterys/connectors/wiring/bms/battery qty it would be a very long list.

Post pictures of your set up etc, take example on how @darkkevind did his battery buisness.

The problem with not being lvl 3 is that u can't take a prepayment or preorder and well if someone ask you to build them a pack but thell pay u when u have it done u run the risk of them bailing on u and u have a done pack and a customer who bailed thus not a good way to run business

1. i am using copper
2. what kind of nickel is there? 99,9% & size is depending on the cells
3. copper stripes/massive
4. i will not mechanical damage the cells, this is not needed
5. F-SW 12 for copper/F 300 fo nickel
6. ERSA 100W Powerstation/broad heads/hammer heads what will be needed
7. i said tomorrow
8. sure
9. 30-40A disc. but who the fucks uses a BMS for discharging without paying 100 of euros
10. like you want, i think the most will prefer flat
11. doing that shit for some years because i learned it
12. from where?
13. pictures tomorrow, like is said. you reiterate

why should i not respond, those are actually quite important questions for some people.

i do not want to start a business right now, i started studying after i did my apprenticeship/worked and i just want to offer my skills for people who need batterys, because a spot welder is expensive for 1 pack and soldering is just not.

so, if there are questions i can answer, i wont hesitate to do

@Exiledd_Top is correct. As a level 2 (member) you can only sell items that you have in hand.
Buy the cells, build the battery pack and then sell it by posting it in this category with full details and pictures.

I have one question.
What do you mean by  "low temperatures and high wattage"?
```

## \#14 Posted by: ZackoryCramer Posted at: 2018-03-08T03:52:57.620Z Reads: 195

I thought about that too. I think he meant low duration of high temperatures and high wattage. Though I still have qualms on how soldering can turn out good. 
One thing I find particularly dangerous is when there is solder residue on the positive terminal and it makes its way through the crack connecting the negative shell. :fireworks:
```

Also, there is a thin insulation ring between the positive and negative on the positive end of the cell.
Not sure how heat resistant it is either.

```
i am not heating the soldering iron up the the maximum temperature, because if you have low melting tin, it would just burn the flux.

also, some of my best friends was **RC Car Worldchampion** back a few years ago, he soldered all his cells, starting with nimh cells and going over to lion, he never had any differences to welded cells, and you would be noticing this because of missing power.

as i said, here are provided pcitures of the work, sadly this is the only one i have here around, and this is my own.

i am **_always_** using fishpaper or insulating paper for these cells.

![IMG_8615|375x500](upload://zCry2utlEKHEZ2YwhBREPMhXnZF.JPG)![IMG_8616|375x500](upload://mHYzSvWXW3fOXHIHqHkzCAom7yD.JPG)

i could sure build some packs, maybe someone is interested. i just need to know what to build? i am thinking of :

 10S2P and 10S3P Samsung 25R, price can be lowered if i buy more cells. but i had some conversation already and 2 x 10S2P i could give aways for 220-230â‚¬.

I will built those packs asap. maybe then we'll see if this works out!

Looks like your soldering skills are quite good.

U should also mention that a lot of ebike battery builds use copper and soldering, so people should not be afraid from properly soldered packs.

DIY Powerwalls also tend to be soldered as far as I know.

I think the thing is people are used to see spotwelded packs, so soldered packs are a bit of taboo here.

Though I think it is somewhat other way around, high power applicactions either have soldered connections or clamped / physically mounted ones.

As about pack size, I think the generally accepted size is 10s3p or 10s4p and 12s 2p / 12s3p

Though no problem offering 10s 2p, cost will be less and for longboard build might be just enough

thank you for your feedback, i can totally understand the suspicion on here, but fine words butter no parsnips.

Hence i provide pictures of my work for people to see, what they'll get.

>

that is right, and to be honest, **everyone talking something like this has absolutely no clue about soldering and high power applications** - fact!

> U should also mention that a lot of ebike battery builds use copper and soldering, so people should not be afraid from properly soldered packs.

if i need to mention this, then i have to say, that you should not handle this amount of power in your bare hands since thats the standard in some high power applications. i am not a friend of spotwelded nickel strips.

_______________________

since someone already wants a 10S2P of 25R i would've started with this. After that he can post pictures of it so others maybe can see what they can expect. a second opinion is always good.

so, if someone maybe need a 10S3P or 10S4P i could do this one too, since the cells would be cheaper for me.

please keep in mind that i am a student and i do not have this much money to buy the cells already and can do massive amounts of batterys.

&

sending those packs need to be labelled as dangerous goods (maybe a bit expensiver)

this is like the baddest example of soldering batterys.

this iron, jeez, got like 40 watts, the tip he is using is way too small. 

i do not know what solder he is using, also he is doing it completely wrong..

i mean, look at this: ![08|604x318](upload://8ypPsi4UXL9EJ7JZOMeM4RPSRSa.png)

like what the heck, for sure he doesnt get any tin on the cell...

he says: "but my solder iron is not as large as his"

LOOK AT THIS, LOOK AT THIS TINY IRON -  this doesnt even have more than 20W

![27|690x415](upload://mNxcDEgEjhVtAwEa8XoeUbfkZAx.png)

the smaller the tip, the lower the wattage, the more time is needed to heat up the solder.

the bigger the tip, the bigger the heat capaticity, the bigger the power of the iron, the better the heat output of the iron.

the heat transfer should be quick and strong - this is physics. if i roast the cell with a small iron, the cell will become cruelly hot - for sure.

okay its official, i hate this guy so much. spreading bullshit on the internet.



@laurnts with soldering you have a way bigger contact area and the current is not flowing through 2-6 tiny welds, the battery will get warmer. also, if one cell is damaged, you can easily replace them. 

8mm x.15mm nickel = aprox 6amps for nickels trips.

Theres much more heat, chance of solderblobs, and how solder isnt expensive, comparing it to welding
Also IMO its much easier to weld a cell than solder it

Im not saying its shit and it doesnt work as good im just saying the same thing can be achived easier/better

 this is right, but for welding you'll need also experience

the cons of welding:
very thin material of about 0.2mm, mostly nickel, has a much higher resistance than copper e.g., also it will heat more up because of the thickness.

it is an permanent bonding which can only be loosened by destroying the joint.

the current flows through 4-6 little welded spots

i am no saying welding isn't as good as soldering but they both do have to pros or cons.
