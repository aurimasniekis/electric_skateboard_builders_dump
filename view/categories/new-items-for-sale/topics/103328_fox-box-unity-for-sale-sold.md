You were selling for 115 shipping included. I would have to pay 115+shipping...not worth it. Good luck

Still cheaper than a single focbox. 
And almost half price for a unity. 
Use all that money you save on Healthcare to pay a little extra on shipping

Doesnâ€™t it need to be shipped to the wizard in Canada anyways? It may even be cheaper for Canadian people as you donâ€™t have to pay international shipping from Canada to get it back.

@Tamatoa The wiz lives 20 esk8 minutes away from me ðŸ¤£
@Skunk this is just an option for ss. I want a happy santee but I'm not gonna ruin my family Christmas for it

115 + 45shipping + 60repair= 220usd before I have even shipped it to santee...not much worth

did not realize this was for a santee. Maybe ship it to someone in the US for repair @ThermalM16 ?
Maybe still not worth it?

Looks like a current shunt amplifier. Theyre not very expensive. Hard to tell thats the only issue tho.. Something caused it to blow.
