Edit: Sold!

Hey, 

I received the unity a couple days ago, it's from the most recent batch, but have no use for it currently as I got a hold of some other vesc's for my current build some time ago (enertion shipping times) and don't have plans for another build in the near future. Selling it for 300â‚¬ reply to me or send a private message if you're interested!
