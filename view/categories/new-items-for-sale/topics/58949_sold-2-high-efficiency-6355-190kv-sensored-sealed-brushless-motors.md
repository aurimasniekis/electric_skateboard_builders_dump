I'm selling 2 unused 6355 190KV Sensored Sealed Brushless Motors. I've never ridden them, but I did try to install them only to discover the shaft is too large for my motor pulleys. The only blemish you will notice is from applying thread locker during my install, but I removed them shortly after. They have the standard FOCBOX 3.5mm gold bullet connectors installed. The Motor shaft requires a Bore diameter 10mm motor pulley, no flat spot

*Set of 2 6355 190KV Sensored Sealed Brushless Motors - $130 shipped within the USA
