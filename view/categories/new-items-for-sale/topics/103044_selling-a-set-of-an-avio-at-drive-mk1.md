## Selling my display set of an Avio AT Drive MK1 (Straight-Cut Gears)

![image|666x500](upload://6DFy4DASUqjbBkTgSCeeyPtO39V.jpeg) 

## What's a display set?
It's a set where I've basically took out to measure dimensions, put some grease on the gears, but has never been mounted onto a truck with 0 mileage on the gears. It's essentially a brand new set. But, because it's technically "used", i'm selling it at a 120usd discount, down from 370usd to 250usd, with free intl.shipping.

## TLDR: Price: 250usd, shipping included.
