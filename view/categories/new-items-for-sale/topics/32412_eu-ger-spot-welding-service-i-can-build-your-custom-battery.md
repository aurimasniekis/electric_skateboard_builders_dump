Hi there!

After building my own battery and a few for my friends with my DIY spotwelder I thought I have some spare time at the moment maybe I can help some of you guys who don´t have access to a spotwelder. 

I´m using high quality hilumin band / nickel stripes (10mm x 0,15mm) from a German seller because I had really good results with it. 
For example in a 10s4p battery build I use 4 layers of nickel stripes so there will be no soldering near the cells. 

More details can be discussed per PM. 

Enclosed some impressions of the building process.

I'm sure everyone will have these questions.

Can you talk about the type of strip used, resistance, ampacity, heat, etc?

Do you provide cells? Do people mail you cells?

Do you offer the add-ons like BMS, charger, fuse, antispark switch?
```

I´m only using those nickel stripes!  (https://www.linergy-shop.de/de/Hilumin-Band-10mm-x-0-15mm--1m--zum-Loeten-und-Punktschweissen.html). Actually I can´t tell something about resistance and ampacity, I need to check it but I can tell that heat isn't a problem and that the used stripes work perfectly in my previous builds (all 10s4p). 

I have 40 unused Samsung INR18650-30Q 3000mAh - 15A from nkon.nl which I could use for a build but normally I would prefer you guys send me the cells you want to use. 

Sure add-ons are possible! I´m not an expert of BMS because I don't use them in my builds. So if you want to use them I prefer to prepare the needed cables and you solder and especially choose your BMS by yourself.

I believe Hilumin is nickle plated steel, isn't it?
