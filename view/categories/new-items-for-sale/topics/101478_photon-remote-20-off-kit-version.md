Hi guys,

I'm happy to announce a limited time **20%** off discount on the Photon remotes + introduction of a kit version.

V2.0 now has dedicated hardware for power management including soft power latching for maximum battery life. V1.0 was only capable of deep sleep mode.

What does the failsafe function do as it "neutralizes" the board?  I'm looking for something that i won't lose connection is this better at holding connection than typical?

The signal quality has been improved a lot during the past 2 years of development to be very reliable.

In the very rare event the remote is disconnected from the board, the transceiver will go into neutral mode, meaning it will stop accelerating/decelerating.

How well does the screen hold up under full sun light?

It would be hard to see clearly under full sunlight, similar to what you would expect for most displays.
