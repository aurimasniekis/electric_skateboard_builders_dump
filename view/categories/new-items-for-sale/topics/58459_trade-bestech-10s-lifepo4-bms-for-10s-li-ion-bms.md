I have a brand-new 10S LiFePO4 BesTech HCX-D223 BMS which Iâ€™m looking to trade for a 10S Li-ion BMS, preferably also a BesTech. Please PM me offers.

I wouldn't be interested in trading, but I have a never used 10s BMS that I never ended up using on a friend's build. I would sell it to you for $20 + $3 in shipping if you are interested.  I can ship it out same day as you pay provided its not on Sunday.

Let me know!
