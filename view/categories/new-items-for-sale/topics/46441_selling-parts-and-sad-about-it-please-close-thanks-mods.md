Rough day today for me. After learning that my tax return was garnished, I found that my car has been impounded as well. I live too far to skate to work, even with my monster-board ðŸ˜Ž so I gotta get the car back. ðŸ˜­

I am offering these items to the community with a heavy heart, all of which are brand new. 

As my balls are in a proverbial salad-shooter, I will entertain offers.

For sale: (not includingshipping)
Abec11 97s $110?
Thanksgiving FOCBOX $110?
@barajabali sk3 192kv $110
Enertion nano $45

All available for what I paid for them, but I don't know what shipping would cost.
