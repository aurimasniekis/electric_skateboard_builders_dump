Up for sale now is an All Terrain Dual Rear Kit! I never got to try this kit, so really don't know how good it is. It feels solid though! I sold one of these on here already and was keeping one for myself, but simply not enough time for another build with a young baby now.

Comes with the following:

Front and Rear Trucks
4 all terrain wheels (8" wheels.)
2 motor mounts
2 drive wheel pulleys (15mm not sure, didn't want to count how many teeth)
2 motor pulleys (15mm 15T)
2 belts (15mm wide)
I believe the diagonal measurement for the motor mount is 30mm approximately.

 think it might be missing a nut and bolt to bolt the motor mounts to the trucks, but can be found at your local hardware store easily.

Looking for $200 USD Shipped to USA and Canada.

PM me if you're interested!

Don't think so, unless they are using the same supplier as me, But this didn't come from them

Hey @Eboosted can you tell if this will work on the trampa carver deck?

Yes they should work, they look like Ultimate Trampa copycats, but I suggest you use the carve base plates in order to be able to use the inner spring position
