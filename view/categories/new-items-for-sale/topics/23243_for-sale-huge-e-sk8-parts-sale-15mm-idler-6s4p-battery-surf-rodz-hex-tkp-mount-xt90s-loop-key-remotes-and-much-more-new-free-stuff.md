Hey man, messaged you a month back or so inquiring about some parts. Wondering if the move is done and the parts are available again. Interested in the waterproof connectors and possible the loop key. Let me know the situation @jmasta.

Hey thanks for your continued interest, but I do not currently have access to any of these parts. They are still in a storage unit in another state.  My move was delayed because of Hurricane Harvey, so I am still in limbo.  I am sorry to have kept you waiting

You can find the waterproof connectors on Amazon.  They are usually called "aviation" connectors
