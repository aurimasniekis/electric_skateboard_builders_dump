Selling a brand new Lacroix deck and enclosure. Complete with MBS Matrix Pro II trucks, MBS Rockstar 2 hubs, MBS bearings and 7" Innova Inline tyres. An extra set of orange shock blocks also included to customize the truck setup. Come with all original screws, loctite, griptape etc that was supplied with the deck.

Not looking to split any of the parts. Everything is brand new and reason for selling is I had a change of plan since I've built my own board. It's just taking up space. Would prefer to ship to the UK or if you're close enough to meet that's also an option. Based in Manchester, UK.

Price is **Â£800** firm for everything + shipping. Payment via PayPal goods and services. Will only be sent tracked and signed. I had to pay a big customs charge so only looking to ship to someone in the UK.

Any questions PM me. Also have a brand new 12S Bestech BMS I'm willing it sell with the board.

That is an excellent price, the plastic base plates are all over the place.  I feel like your just being insulting for no reason, maybe do some research on prices before making comments like that.

@colinphotovideo do your thing...

Theres a 5-6 week shipping time on the Lacroix deck and its 699 USD on its own without shipping. I'd say this is a bargain with trucks and wheels included as well...

I'm running on the assumption you're in the uk/eu? If so you dont pay import fees from frank because the stuff is already here. You paid VAT instead

The wait isn't 5-6 weeks anymore.  Email Alex @ Lacroix and ask for a current ship time.  I was going to order one a few weeks ago and I emailed him 2 days after my order to change it to a complete board.  I got an email back from him saying that it was a good thing I emailed him when I did as the deck and enclosure was due to ship out the following day

Right guys I'm gonna open this to worldwide. I've boxed it all up and weighed it etc so below are the quotes for the cost of shipping. If shipping is less I'll only charge you what I paid for it. These prices are the most it will be. If you want to send me your postcode/city/country I can check more accurately.

UK Â£10  |  EU Â£25/â‚¬28  |  USA Â£50/$63

@BahahBlast let me know if you're still interested
