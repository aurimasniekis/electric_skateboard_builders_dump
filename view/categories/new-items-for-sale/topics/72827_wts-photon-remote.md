I have a Photon Remote I've never used and don't have a use for now.  I have 1 in use on another board, but don't need a second one and need to recoup some funds for other gear.  I charged it this morning, it turns on and charges fine.  I have not installed it in a board, its just been sitting here for weeks.  

I'm happy to let it go for $130 shipped (1st class) plus PayPal fees in the US only.  PM me if your interested.

Looks really nice I was going to order it but I'm not sure how I feel about the trigger being able to move to the left and right too so I pre-ordered his instrument cluster for my deck haha
GL I hope you sell it fast.

It would be really expensive to ship to AU and I hate having to deal with the customs forms.  If I don't sell it in a couple of days, Ill PM you.

No need for customs forms if this is Australia, Mississippi. I'd definitely double check just to make sure.
