I have a firefly kit I bought from @SeeTheBridges that I am not going to have the time to build.  Original thread here.

I am just too covered up with work and family stuff right now and I hate to leave it sitting around.  If you want it I paid $57, you can have it for that + shipping which is typically $7.20 in the US.
