Hi

![20180916_125449_cr|690x370](upload://qf4ivbTQAvpjAtMcUj7qn9xm1f4.jpg)

The housing is very capacious
In the enclosure can be mounted:
- 20700 12S4P battery pack
- 2x ESC FlipSky 6.6
- BMS with a width of 70mm

![20180809_232517~01|690x401](upload://8O9WE9PlvDBIIDfluMl9oTFW4t5.jpg)

**Price for black enclosure - 70 Euro (2 pieces available)**
**Price for gray enclosure - 60 Euro  (1 piece available)**


I designed the enclosure for the board I built

@Wraith
I used SANYO NCR20700B 4250mAh. 
I did not find better 20700 batteries at a similar price

@Andy87
In a few hours I will send a drawing with dimensions

I do not know, maybe... :thinking:

I'm waiting for Trampa to start selling HS11 again  :slight_smile: 

Perhaps I will design a similar enclosure for Urban deck

They don’t produce the hs11 anymore. 
Looks like they will also not come back to it...sadly. But it’s not a big deal to cover the holes on the holy pro.

What you think about strength compaired ABS and fiberglass for enclosure?

@Andy87
I did not do comparative tests :slight_smile:

I think that Kaly uses enclosures made of ABS  and rather no problems

@Leo81486

I designed the enclosures for:

- 20700 12S4P battery pack
- 2x ESC FlipSky 6.6
- BMS with a width of 70mm

Perhaps the 10S5P packet will fit if several batteries are transferred to the 4th chamber
You have to design the distribution of elements yourself 

Dimensions of the chambers in the drawing below
Chambers 1, 2 and 3 have the same dimensions

Please don’t forget you have a trampa carve.
This enclosure is for a holy pro.
That’s a different deck.
