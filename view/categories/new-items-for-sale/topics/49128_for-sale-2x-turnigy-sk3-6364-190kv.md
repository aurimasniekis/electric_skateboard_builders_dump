I bought these on sale and then changed my mind, couldn’t get the order cancelled. I’ll sell them for how much I paid for them. $107 shipped in the US

Sorry I just sent them back to Hobbyking yesterday because I didn’t think anyone wanted them. They’re on sale right now and if you have an account you can get a 10% off discount so it’ll be the same price I paid for them.
