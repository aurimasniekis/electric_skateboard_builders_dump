What's the difference between those and $25 Vedder Anti-spark Switches?

I have both but I'll only use a Vedder switch up to 3p. They seem to break often with lager batteries or higher current draw.

Based off of the Vedder Switch circuit, I perf-boarded my own Vedder switch with parts I picked from my local smd store and they worked great for my lipos. I am more of a DIY personal. :raised_hands:t2::face_with_monocle:

Are the switches hold-to-turn-off or do they turn off the moment you tap the button?
