I don't think they are, but confirming with you.  The trucks, are they square machined on the end for tighter tolerances for motor mounts? I believe Trampa markets that version as E-skate version of the trucks.

Was a simple search on Trampas site too much for you?  Can you not use google to convert euro to dollar?  And this is the NEW section. That means it’s new.  Fuck I’m glad I’d rather work hard and be tired than be poor.
