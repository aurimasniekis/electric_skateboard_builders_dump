Was checking this place out for future ‚ÄúMNesk8event‚Äù like what @MoeStooge did in CO ... but need to find more locals or import some from around the Midwest (or anywhere for that matter).

@Deckoz
@Eboosted
@ksfacinelli
@myreala
@pixelsilva
 
Some may know some may not...

be sure to INSPECT your FOCBOX's thoroughly before powering up
-film on heat pad
-any bit of solder that bridges

seen a few topics on this very recently thats killing focbox's.

also be sure when you do plug in that your phase wires are not touching.

if anyone has any other useful unboxing tips please share

```
I normally take mine apart and check the pads.and any crooked components (vertically) that could short on the housing. And I normally always power up with a 4s first. To load firmware, setup canbus and do detections...or at least a base detection.. I may be wrong but I think the detection uses the current saved settings and then adjusts them. I'd have to look at the code. But I've always felt like if I do a detection at 10-13s it's rough... But if I do it at low voltage first and save then do 10-13s detection it runs smoother.

Idk just random stuff I do.

@Scoo_B_SK8 is the man. Quick shipping. Packaging was perfect.

Nothing on @Scoo_B_SK8 fault. But my package got delivered to the wrong house. He got on wit h USPS immediately, and we both worked to try to track it down. I ended up getting a mapp of the delivery scan, and went door knocking. 19 later.. "you must be Brad".

Anyway, booted and ran detection just fine. Neither of the ones shipped to me had the "film" and the thermals we're aligned properly.

I  was looking for a FOCBOX - Scoo_B_SK8 - PM'd me with info.  I paid him via paypal for the item and have not heard from him since.  It's been  a week and I have emailed him several times to confirm my order... Nothing... Anyone else have problems with Scoo_B_SK8 communicating or delivering items?  Next steps will be dispute through paypal but what a pain that would be ..

Yes i have some left...

Apologies earlier on price (glad no one bought, would‚Äôve felt more shitty), i did not make the AUD => USD exchange when posting amount which then was $420AUD, and is now listed at $299AUD, at todays exchange is about $200USD. (If someone knows something i dont, tell me ü§™üòÅ).

Sale price for a UNITY is... $215 (shipping included, US only).
