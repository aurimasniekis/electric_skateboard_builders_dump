Hey onloop, I've been watching your vids and reading up on your story today and I've got to say I'm impressed with your level of passion and professionalism for the DIY guys.

Mate my question for you is I have 2 broken boards an elektroskate (2010) and an evolve (first generation) both of which need new electronics and batteries. Can I wire up your battery, controller and esc to existing motors to get them going again?

You might be able to just replace the battery depending on what is broken.

The elektroskate had multiple problems with the esc before I bought the evolve. I can't find them online anymore. The evolve had wiring/esc problems also as it was the first production run. The battery hasn't been charged for atleast 2.5yrs. I figured i should be able to atleast make 1 decent board between both if I bought new battery and electronics if they were compatable.
