Selling thirty (30) Samsung 25R batteries. New in boxes, ended up building a bigger battery with different cells and didn't finish my spud project. 

Paid $135 shipped from Liionwholesale.com. 

Asking $105 shipped which is lower than the discount price they offer if you buy over 1,000 cells.

No, they are still available. @Blacksheep said he wants them but not until after the 1st. If someone would like to buy them before then, they‚Äôre available.
