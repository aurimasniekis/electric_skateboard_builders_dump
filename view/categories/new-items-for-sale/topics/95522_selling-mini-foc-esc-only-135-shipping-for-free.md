Yea... may want to just change the name to mini foc esc.... I know Jason ‚Äúleft‚Äù the forum but that doesn‚Äôt mean we can go crazy!!! This is in no way associated with focbox and adding a space between the name just makes it even more sleazy.... mini foc esc or x-minifoc works fine

Do you have anyone testing these? The specs seem killer for the price, but I can find no details on it anywhere but this and your you tube videos.
