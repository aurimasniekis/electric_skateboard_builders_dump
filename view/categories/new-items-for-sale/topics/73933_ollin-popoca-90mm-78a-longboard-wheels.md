We have been riding these wheels for more than a year now, hard to believe I am still using my first set! They are a center set wheel with 54mm width and a 45mm contact patch. They have a very large radius edge that contributes to the very high durability of these wheels, very little chunking if any. Definitely the most durable wheel we have ever ridden. 

The urethane formula in our wheels has some of the best rebound we have ever experienced and this creates a very smooth ride with very low rolling resistance. At 90mm it is the Goldilocks of wheels, not too big and not to small. 

The Popoca also utilizes the same style hub/core as the kegel wheel so it is relatively easy to find compatible hardware. Boosted riders have also found our wheels to be a direct fit on their boards and the 90mm size gives them a little boost in top speed! Lets hope tinkering with wheel swaps leads the Boosted crowd down the rabbit hole to our neck of the woods ;)

If you want a great wheel at an even better price listen to the raven, head over to our site and grab a set, they are always in stock!

I use Ollin Popocas on all my personal builds, from my 'Pimp my Meepo' design exercises to my personal dual 6380 yin/yang Loaded Blood Slayer Unicorn that we're building now.  

My sole 'complaint' is I wish they came in 83mm heh

I would love some 85mm & 97mm, but given that competitive options exist and the cost of manufacturing I understand why they don't.

For you Boosted Riders (or guys on here that have friends who still ride on such a rudimentary device 😂), there is an easy mod to do to get these to work with stock wheel pullies and still run the guard:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/boosted-board-motor-guard-mod-for-ollin-90mm-popoca/36672?u=sender

Lol, this was the first topic I created.


And, I have about 1000 miles on mine and they are still Prestine.  No chunking at all.  Great ride quality.  Though they are still on my Boosted so only get taken out when I am taking a friend out, because... well... it is a Boosted Board.

Eventually we will make a universal pulley and adapter but we currently only produce an adapter that fits our Revolver Drive. Unfortunately it is not a bolt on adapter and only fits a customized truck hanger. It rides on a captive bearing which transmits all the drive forces in an axial direction.

I'm still learning this new realm of DIYs. Wasted a good chunk of money on those cheap Chinese boards. I should have gone the DIY route. Lesson learned

Anyhow, I'm in the wheel selection portion of my DIY. I was going AT route but it has been a big PITA to look for wheel pulleys that would fit them. Then I stumble upon these gems. What pulleys would fit on these? I apologize for the newborn question.

These have Kegel cores, as do some orangatang wheels. I think there are a few others, maybe Boa?

Feel free to ask around, people here are generally very helpful. There's also [this](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/noob-question-thread-ask-your-questions-here/9559) thread for 'noob' questions. :slight_smile:

Our wheels use Kegel type core so it is fairly easy to find adapters. First off, where are you located? International shipping can cost more than the pulleys so tell us where you are and we will be happy to help you find what you need!

Cali. I'm buying two sets of those wheels. 

I've narrowed it down to 36t 16t gearing. Now, I just need to figure out what belt to use (#t?). I prefer no less than 12mm in width.

Thanks for the help. Sorry for hijacking this thread.

@pookybear Great! Lots of options for you, diyelectricskateboards has a good selection. They usually have things like pulleys in stock and ready to ship. We have a slightly more expensive adapter/pulley combo that will be available soon as a bolt on option but it will be a minute before it is available. It's a modified version of the pulley from our "Revolver Drive".

Quick announcement! We just realized our shop is still set on Eastern standard time ... A big plus for east coast builders but it also means the code will expire on eastern time or when our Black Friday stock runs out, whichever happens first. We set aside a few hundred sets for the Black Friday event so hopefully they will last but it might be a good idea to get your order in now if you want to catch this deal!

Luckily our findings do not change the awesomeness of the Popoca 90's!</s> The Popoca wheels now contain 290 grams of pure awesomeness! 

 <s>Please accept our apology for the error in our original listing.</s> No extra charge for the added awesomeness!

I get 35 shipping to EU. Still a lot. If they are willing to help with custom declaration we could do a small GB for like 4-5 set. I also need one.
Otherwise with the taxes is gonna be more than from Sickboard

I think it’s just flat rate, maybe send them a message directly and ask what the price is if you order multiple

Shipping to Australia seems to just be whatever the cart value is, not sure if it's a cart issue or they don't really want to send to Australia ?
Submitted a contact us via the website so will see what the answer is.

Yeah, it’s just flat rate everywhere I thing, to eu it’s $35 per set too.

Maybe we can get a couple of Aus guys to split shipping with us?

Okay so Jeramiah was super quick getting back to me.

They send via usps priority international and rates are not cheap to Australia...
Wheel sets are about 2.5 lbs / 1.2kgs
Dimensions would be about 180mm x 180mm x 55mm / 7.1" x 7.1" x 2.2"
Individual wheels 90x90x55 / 3.6x3.6x2.2

My Tetris Skills are a little rusty but even looking at something like the 
Priority Mail International® Large Flat Rate Box
USPS-Produced Box: 23-11/16" x 11-3/4" x 3" or 12" x 12" x 5-1/2"
Maximum weight 20 pounds.
I could only work out how to get 18 wheels in a box (4.5 sets) and at 103.85 USD for a flat rate box it worked out a little cheaper per set but unless everyone was in the same location any forward shipping would take out any saving.

If someone has a good freight forwarder it may work out better, this was the top google result https://www.myus.com/au/ and looked to be cheaper.
If someone is Aus works out a good deal I'm in for a set or two

Sorry about the international shipping, heavy items add up quick. Some of our customers use forwarding service to save on shipping items out of the US.  If someone wants to do a group buy or order a few sets let me know and I will be happy to help find a better rate.
