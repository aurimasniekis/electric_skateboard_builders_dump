Looking good, stone ground, rounded lips... Who's into some e drifting? $16 seems like a steal for wheels, pulleys, bearings, spacers, belt... How do you pull this shit off? I'd love to try these.

Cheaper than AliExpress.

I'm going cannabals as I'm a speed freak..lol and I had the harlots they are like butter .. but a nice lil retro Powell pool deck with Aera rf1 or  surfrods tkp 127 and the 70 harlots would be pretty sweet time ..single or yingyang not sure yet..thinking maybe the arc boards pully with a 68 mm pipe wheels.. I'm definitely building a mini retro pool park ripper
