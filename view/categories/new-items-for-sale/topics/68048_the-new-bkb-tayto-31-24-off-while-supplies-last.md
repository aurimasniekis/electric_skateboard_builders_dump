https://buildkitboards.com/products/bkb-tayto-31-deck

I released the new 31" Tayto today! It is essentially the same deck as the 29" spud, but with a 2" kicktail added to the back. Same color scheme as before, matte black bottom and gunmetal grey top. 
* Length (in): 31
* Width (in): 9.5
* Varying Wheelbase (in): 20.5 - 21.25
* Wheels: fits 90mm wheels without risers
* Plys: 7
* Construction: Maple
* Flex Level: Stiff
* Griptape: None

## [PRE-ORDER](https://buildkitboards.com/products/bkb-tayto-31-deck) PRICE - $74.99
For pre-ordering you will get $10 off! When the decks come in stock it will be the normal price of $84.99. Shipping in the USA is $7. For any European customers it costs $52 to ship one deck, and ~$5 more per extra deck so a group buy would be highly recommended.
![Bottom%20Side%20by%20Side|666x500](upload://gerbiSmklP3QkIufsOfziF7TjtO.jpg)
Here is the Spud and Tayto side by side. The Tayto looks much bigger but it really isn't.

I just finished my first Tayto Build and oh my do I love this deck. Don‚Äôt know if I will be able to go back to a Spud. It‚Äôs not done but I was too eager to ride it

![image|666x500](upload://kKYR5iWIv9LCaB9mqGHixgzHEPe.jpeg)
Of course I sell all of the other parts, and run out of griptape. I will be changing out the mounting hardware and gripping it this week and I will post a thread when it‚Äôs done.

The kictail gives your foot a good place to lock in, and the extra 2‚Äù really make it a joy to ride. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3‚Äù and it‚Äôs very stable.

The Tayto‚Äôs have been under production for a few days and I just increased the order to 50pcs! I havnt had any time to ride my Tayto build but I got it partially gripped, I will be adding a few more hexagons later. 
![image|666x500](upload://bKAiiHyEBDiymL8PccK3DTaltOf.jpeg) 

Just as a reminder, once I receive the board the price will go back to the normal price, so pre order before hand if your interested. 

**If anyone wants complete high performance esk8 kits please contact me** 

https://buildkitboards.com/products/bkb-tayto-31-deck

I also have double and single stack enclosures that fit the Tayto and Spud. Please email me if interested

I had a bunch of interest in getting the Tayto into Europe. I wanted to organize a group buy so you guys can get them cheaper. Shipping one deck by itself is $54, so if you do a GB I will pay the shipping costs to Europe. I think @brenternet agreed to organize it so all payments will go to him, and then he will send one payment to me. Once he has the decks in hand you can work out the shipping cost for inside the EU. 

So far I have:
@sebaszz Tayto + DS Enclosure
@Grozniy Tayto
@sami Tayto
@sk8l8r Tayto
@brenternet Tayto
@NAF Tayto + DS Enclosure

I also have single stack enclosure available as well ($109) DS are $129

If you have enclosures, I would like a SS/DS also with @Eboosted gasket. Just one question: his SS enclosure is 35mm thick, so in theory it could fit 26650 cells?

@ jlabs Please reserve one double stack enclosure for me! I'll be making purchase any day now. Not sure if I'd go with the spud or tayto.

One question ..if you hold TAYTO in your hand does it touch the ground ? I know SPUD is small enough and wont touch the ground but I was just curious about TAYTO.

@bigben have any shipping advice?

And also I probably won't be buying the deck.. :) Cant afford it lol

Also, dont know if this is possible, but maybe include like 8-10 boxes (flat pack) in the package? Saves me buying them/finding a place to buy

Oh and have you thought about taxes?

Interparcel  have been the best and using parcelforce worldwide has been the one to go for. 
Parcel2go have been shocking and DPD have just turned up with some pretty bad service. 
I got custom boxes made last time at about ¬£3 ish a pop because I got bored of making boxes. 
Some of the import charges have arrived up to 2 weeks after the stuff has been recieved so be wary of thinking you‚Äôve got away with it!

Thank you for the update Jared. That's a shit business right there.

I appreciate people get sick but having zero contingency while your paid customers wait is ludicrous. Half of these skate brands live in a fantasy world.

Apologies if I come off as a dick here anyone who reads this but it works my nerves that people like @JLabs have to be customer facing when the supply chain is so unprofessional.

@JLabs  Sorry they kinda screwed you over on the decks. I have a few decks that could be alternative to it and might be something your interested they are between 28-30 inches long and have a wheel base of 14 inches.  I could even do a custom design on top for you or specific paint combo. Let me know.

I just check muirskate and they don't have JET decks or Liquid trucks which are all under the sk8trip company I have known they were under the same company for years same thing with biltin bearings, pink wheels, retro wheels sublime wheels.

Dude I have to give you some credit because I would be banging down their door for this wait.  I guess it also shows the type of people on here know the art of patience because other forums it would look like a scene from Frankenstein. because in 2 months they should have been able to produce a bunch of these decks for you not to mention the amount of time and energy you put in before you even announced the deck.  If you want to look at a different decks just let me know. Instead of regular trust level it should say patience master or zen master.

Just to help you remind to see if it would be possible to add this to the EU groupbuy box with taytos: 

* 2x [6354 208KV MOTOR](https://buildkitboards.com/collections/parts/products/6354-208kv-motor)
* [CALIBER II 50¬∞ RKP TRUCKS](https://buildkitboards.com/collections/parts/products/caliber-ii-50-rkp-trucks)

If the trucks don't fit maybe just the motors? :slight_smile: Anyways if nothing fits I absolutely understand and I might just order them separately.

Remind me when the decks arrive (I will post). If they fit in the box I will, if not I‚Äôm not gonna ship another box.

Just to help you remind to see if it would be possible to add this to the EU groupbuy box with taytos: 

* 2x [6354 208KV MOTOR](https://buildkitboards.com/collections/parts/products/6354-208kv-motor)
* [CALIBER II 50¬∞ RKP TRUCKS](https://buildkitboards.com/collections/parts/products/caliber-ii-50-rkp-trucks)

If the trucks don't fit maybe just the motors? :slight_smile: Anyways if nothing fits I absolutely understand and I might just order them separately.
[/quote]

Update: don‚Äôt even bother to check if that stuff fits. My impulsive ass decided to go for raptor hubs :sweat_smile:

Can anyone let me know what sort of foam/sealant I should consider getting for use in swapping my Wowgo 2s enclosures onto this board (since I imagine there will be a rather large gap on the edges due to the concave)? Also welcome recommendations on where to buy the foam. 

On the flip side, would it be better for me to just buy one of the enclosures Jlabs is offering to hold both the 10p2s battery and ESC? If doing that would I need the single or double depth enclosure?

TIA!

I wanted to see what it'll look like, definitely excited. Aside from the dual 6374, 16/40t, 11s3p, I'm really excited to create the aesthetic.  I'll remove the paint on top to bare maple, stain it ebony (so the grain is still visible), epoxy a solid copper piece to cover the kick tail, paint the motors metalic copper, and place the charging/loop key inside the risers so they're not seen. 
 (And yes I know the trucks are on backwards)

Yeah I was nervous too! I need some taller risers and a lot of speed rings to fine tune the motor system, along with some adapting the enclosure to mount proper to the deck with the battery, but I love the way it looks.  What I really need is to learn how to wire evening up, got a lot of reading to do, don't want to fry any components.

I ran into a few pits when I sanded the spud around the wheel well. If you sand the bottom just be mindful of that. I was able to sand off most of the top paint but make sure you step up your paper when sanding so you get a nice smooth surface the stain.

Thanks for the tip! I used some of that to put my Wowgo enclosures on the board and it worked perfectly! I still need to trim the foam, put sealant around the enclosures and touch up some of the black paint, but otherwise the deck swap with my Wowgo KT went well! Despite the kicktail being fairly small (perfect size IMHO), the Tayto kicktail is infinitely more useful than the one on the Wowgo KT deck ‚Äî I suspect this is largely because of better weight distribution with where the battery is placed on the Tayto.

Here are some pics for those interested:

Well, it seems like an odd approach, but you could always use samsung 50e cells, get a 10s3p and meepo hubs. 

I think that would get you some nice km and top speed, as its just a meepo with steriod range :rofl: 

I can see why you wouldnt though, there are some obvious flaws

I have everything except for the batt, was waiting for the unity to ship, and well f$&k ü§£ now I have to wait more and to see if the ones that he launch say "if I fit I sit" to the enclosure he sell for the tayto. 

Don't know if @JLabs can tell us something of that, or I have to go diy with a new enclosure and sell the one I have waiting

well if Jared falls through... Ive got a boy... 

Kidding, its @hyperIon2 though. He made my 30q 10s2p spud battery and its been sitting in my closet without passively sucking itself dry, as well as looking fresh as fuck ;) 

They haven't dissapointed me yet, and I doubt they well... Cant wait to see what Ben does for Erebos :heart_eyes:

What brand are those hubs? Im looking for a pair to upgrade the ones im getting as they seem fairly far along in their life... but I couldnt resist the pricetag ;) 

I always liked whatever brand that is due to the sleek looks of the hub.

Feels very solid, I've had the ownboardkit before and it worked great.

I think the development was showing off some spud diy kits. deck+enclosure+internals I think. When he showed me it had a really simplistic design that looked so easy anyone could get the kit and put it together no problem.

Correct me if I'm wrong Jared
