We do have a shirt store with spread shirts, but it can get kind of pricey for a shirt especially if it‚Äôs simple.

So, today I present the Esk8Squad - Esk8 or Die Tee

Comes in kid sizes, MENS & LADIES SIZES  xs, small, medium, large, XL, XXL & XXXL

Any chance of it without the "Esk8 or die" on the bottom? Your logo is dope, not sure I want to die on work days though.

Right here. Spreadshirts is great but, the added costs per item sucks...so, for now Ill be doing just for you guys. Then move to something more broad.

I'll just have to make sure your shirt sizes can encompass all of my testosterone fueled muscular bulk. 

If you have a blank shirt brand in mind it might be good to post the name here or the sizing chart in your main post. I wear a US size small and a UK size large :smiley:

Good idea... its a standard US size shirt, nothing funky like ordering and XL so that it equals a US Medium hahha

How much does 1 shirt weight?

I think we can put 1-2kilos for 35$ to Croatia, maybe to something closer to us even cheaper

I would be down for 1 if the "esk8 or die" thing wasn't on there... It's a bit much for my conservative British tastes ü§£ü§£ü§£

How about just "ESk8 Life" or 
"Eat, Sleep, ESk8, Recharge, Repeat"
or something like that?

I think the reason why @Michaelinvegas did esk8 or die is because of the age old skater mantra of skate or die.   Basically meaning they will skate till they die

I‚Äôll take one! I agree w others that the ‚Äúesk8 or die‚Äù could be a separate shirt/logo . But honesty the shirt could say ‚ÄúJamie is a dorkl‚Äù and I‚Äôd still buy it you know I‚Äôm gonna get every squad tee!
