Nice to see somebody sell these!

How are the bolts held in place? Is there a nut or do you just screw them into the ABS?

What colors are possible and how long would you need to ship 2 sets to Germany? :smiley:

These look pretty nice.  I hope one day you share your stls online though I think your pricing is cheaper than shapeways so you  have an advantage over people getting these with them.

Obligatory plug for those that have access to a 3D printer,  I've shared a literal shit ton of STLs for these wheels and more on thingiverse. If you don't though,  I think these are a steal.

Should your 40t pulleys work with these wheels?

Any chance you'll be doing higher tooth count pulleys? ie. 44t?

@JuniorPotato93
Thanks. Performs pulleys only with their own projects. I respect other people's work and I do not use  stl from Thingiverse.
Perhaps someday I will share the stl files, if and when, I do not know? 

@michaelcpg  
Can do higher diameter 44t, 48t, 50t, but I do not know if the bolt holes in the MBS are the same as in the ABEC 11 Flywheels.

[/quote]

They are the same,  the profile of the slope is different so that's why I made the separate series.  I have some pulleys I need to make and once I make those I'll go over all the series and use the feedback I've been given and update all files.

yeah, if you make enough clearance on the inside, no need to cut the truck hanger.

This is on a 32T 15mm pulley for Kegel 80mm

It just takes modification of the hanger. You can remove material from Caliber trucks, etc to get more axle width.

1. Would this wheel pulley work on a CRonin truck?
2. Do you have motor pulleys or just wheel pulleys?
3. What carrier would you use to ship to Lima Perú?
4. Would you sell the belts as well?
5. 2 wheel pulleys and retainers $ 24 + $ 7 or $14 for shipping?

If you don't make the motor pulleys, would you please tell me where could I get 15mm motor pulleys with keyway from?

ad1. You mean These trucks [Cast Ronin](http://www.ronintrucks.com/shop-2/complete-sets/#!/Cast-Ronin-Trucks/p/20199272/category=1667187)?
I do not know the dimensions of Ronin Trucks.
The internal bore of the pulley for ABEC11 Flywheels is 26mm
The internal bore of the pulley for Kegel Orangatang is 25mm.
You need to measure your truck, you will know whether pulley fits or not.
ad2. I also offer  pulleys for motors, but only 15t on the width of the belt 9 and 15mm. Unfortunately currently I have in stock only width 9 mm
ad3. Shipping price for Lima Perú $7
ad4. I also offer belts: available length for HTD5M: 265mm, 270mm, 280mm
ad5. Price 2 pcs  pulleys and shipping to Peru $24 + $7. Total $31

As I will have a milling machine, I will be able to offer pulleys of aluminum :slight_smile:  (You may be coming soon), 
but the price will be higher so I can not be competitive. 

ABS + is a little more durable,  but durability depends also on 2 factors (pulley diameter and width)

@Idea - I am making an insert for a wheel and need a couple 44 tooth pulleys from you. What is the distance from the top of the tooth for the bottom edge of the lip - see pic.  I know there are places in the US that I can have these printed but you seem to have teeth figured out.  I have to make the pieces that fit in the wheel but will send you the files to match up the holes in the pulley part.

@capfirepants
There are different ABEC11 Flywheels clones.
I do not know if my pulleys fit the clones.
In about a week I will have 90mm ABEC11 Flywheels clones from Trampa, I will be able to check ..

Below the price of the set you are asking for.
Pulley36t for Abec 11 Flyweels - $24 (2 pcs)
Bolts (black or silver) $4 (2 set)
Shipping to Switzerland - $5

Total $33 USD or 33 Euro

Pulleys made of aluminum for the motor  I have only 15t.
Pulleys for ABEC 11 are only made of ABS+

Tomorrow I will try to make pulleys of nylon.

A few months ago I made nylon pulleys for Kegel, but I haven't made nylon pulleys for ABEC 11 flywheels yet.

Also did you get your wheels?
I got mine now, the spokes are wider like the left wheel in the pic in @TarzanHBK post. The width of the spokes are around 7mm at the widest outermost part.

I already have a  wheels with Trampa.
Spokes are wider than Abec 11, but modifying the pulley design is no problem. The new version pulley for ABEC 11 clone  will be available in a few days.

I have problems to keep the belt going straight wit those pulleys (im sure they are  mounted well)
If i spin the pulley the belt moves away from the wheel and wants to go off the pulley after some spinnig
The belt always wants to go down (down from the pulley) where the motor mount is
 
Tried to fix that 100 times with adjusting the mount and the angle but it dont want to work how it should
@Hardwiring have you had the same issue?
EDIT: with the 12mm pulley and after riding the pulley 50-100km the problem is solved ;)

I never had such problems

You certainly have too wide a pulley of the motor. 
The motor pulley must have the same widh as the belt

Your motor pulley is 15mm wide and you have a 12mm wide belt.

Yeah i know but this shoudnt be the problem because the belt should hold itself in place and not because it touches the end (the disc) of the pulley because then ur pulley shreddes itself off and u got power loss because it touches the side disc of the pulley. the belt should spin without touching anything

However ill buy a 12mm pulley and will test it and will tell how it works but i still think the problem is the wheel pulley.

I want to build a single drive eboard and I have one question. Isn't it better to use a wider pulley to have as much gripping surface as possible but keeping the motor pulley the same width as the belt (12mm)?
Or will that cause fitting problems with the motormount?

Depending on what width you advise me I would like to get a quote for: 
1 orange pulley 36t including the retainer and bolts for Orangatang wheels

15mm wide belt is recommended for a single drive.

If using a 15mm Belt,.....Usually the Motor pulley Has the Flanges and is slightly wider   (16-17mm between flanges)

Having a Wheel Pulley at least as Wide (17mm) is recommended, this way the belt can move side to side between Motor flanges and allways stay on wheel pulley.

Where would i get a 16mm pulley? Everyone seems to be riding single drives on 'just' 12mm belts.

I get that wider belts means stronger belt overall, but it also causes more resistance in molding/folding the belt around the pulleys, right?

Thanks

I need stronger materials to destroy :smiley:
Do you have the possibility to strenghten them or print them in nylon?

@TarzanHBK
This is normal. A pulley made of ABS enables to pass distance of a few hundred kilometres through.
The pulley consists of 3 components. You can order only 1 component, belt pulley without distance rings.
The price of one item (pulley 36t / 18mm) -  it's only 5 euro, 6 USD

I made pulleys from Nylon. They are difficult to produce.

But soon I will offer an alternative to ABS +  :smiley:
This is the first prototype version

Hi,
i live in Germany and i wanted to know, how much the shipping would cost. A bit higher you said 5 Dollar, but i dont know if you still sell these or if something has changed. The problem is, that my own 3D printed pulleys wobble and so the belt is sometimes really tensioned and sometimes not. I wonder, if this pulleys work really good without wobbling ?

@TarzanHBK
To make a nylon pulley, it takes hours to test to set the printer's parameters.
Unfortunately I do not have much time. I prefer to concentrate leisure time on aluminum pulleys.

I’m tempted to order a set of Kegel wheel pulleys, but I’ve used a printed pulley on Kegel’s with what looks like an identical design and the screws backed out due to vibration on the first long ride. I was able to fix it by drilling out and adding nuts (like you have for the abec’s). Have you tested the Kegel pulley? If so, how many miles have you put on it?

I sold over 200 pieces. I have no problems with backed out the bolts

Perhaps the holes were too big, maybe you had a filament about other parameters. Reasons for reversing bolts can be many

The most important
**The pulley can not have vibrations!!!**

OK thats great - thanks for getting back to me so quickly!

Do you think a single 6374 192KV motor (likely a Turnigy SK3 or SK8) would be able to power an 85kg guy around on that sort of gearing ratio? Would I have room to drop the wheel pulley down to a 32 tooth and still have good hill climbing ability?

Also - what size bore is on the motor pulley? Is there a keyway (and is so what config) and are there/how many/what size grub screws does it use?

What colours are available? I'm really after black if possible.

I'll definitely be taking you up on one of these sets - just want to make sure I get the gearing ratios right first.

@Idea Depending on my access to abec or kegel wheels, I am interested in your pulley system.  Something like your posts on Feb 26/27 2018.  I am trying to line up and price out all of the parts I need.  I am open to any suggestions or advice.  I am in Canada so prototyping a setup is limited when shipping is more expensive than the product. haha

Can you supply the pulley that attaches to the motor drive shaft? If so how much and how much for belts if you have them as well.  Do you have expedited shipping options?  Please contact me privately and we can arrange for payment and order details.  Thanks.

Can I order two sets of pulleys for Kegel wheels with 16T/40T and 15mm wide.  I think I need belts that are 290mm or 295mm. Though I haven't got motor mounts yet, those are the length they said I'd need, but I'm looking at other options.  Do you sell motor mounts also?  I'll have TB 218 trucks.

Hey, planning my first build. Going for a single motor setup and the Orangatang Kegel 80mm´s.
I would love to get the 15t Motor Pulley, and the 40T Version for the Kegel´s. 
Can you give me a price in total? Shipping would be to Germany.

I designed mounts with idlers for Evolve Truck, 
If the idlers will run properly, I can make the same version for TB218

Okay thanks, after going through my other parts i decided the 36T would be better. And i will need one set of bolts aswell. And what belt size can be used with the pulleys ? 
Seeing the motor mounts you posted .. You don´t happen to sell motor mounts for caliber 2 trucks aswell ?

Will the finished mounts be made with aluminum or 3d-printed?  Is the slot at the end for motor protectors / bumpers, and if so, do you have those made also?  Really like the design!

Hi!

I need a 40T pulley for a Kegel core. I'd like the version with the nuts. That would be for a 12mm belt (so 13mm actual size on pulley, does that make sense?).
Do you have those in aluminium?
I also need a 12mm 280 or 290 or 300mm belt if you have.
All that shipped to Canada. Do you know the approximate time it would take?

Thanks
```

@louwii

The pulleys for Kegel are made of ABS + on a 3D printer, I do not have other ones.
I have belts 280, 295 and 300mm

Lead time, 3-4 day

Prices:
40t/13mm - 13 Euro (1 psc)

Bolts - 2 Euro (1 set)

Belt 280mm - 8 Euro (1 psc)

Belt 295, 300mm - 7 Euro (1 psc)

Shipping cost - 8 Euro

The KEGEL belt pulleys do not have nuts, there is no space for them

Not really. You see, I already got a 44t pulley htd5 and the size is fine (a bit towards the big side but still fine). The thing is that it has 6 holes and not 5 so I can't  bolt it onto the wheels and I would also have to cut the trucks because the interior diameter is too small. Hopefully, this ABS pulley will fit fine and work well.
