They're finally here, I've received shipment from @DanSkates and I'm happy make them available to everyone who's been looking for them (I've tagged you below). 

I am listing them on my eStore: 

<a href="http://www.esk8life.com">www.esk8life.com</a>

There's no way I'm keeping track of everything manually through here, hence the store.  A small side effect is everything is transacted as Goods&Services and I am passing on the fee to you.

<h1>Prices</h1>

Both the 12mm and 9mm pulleys are **$14** plus **$2.6** shipping for each.

Anyone purchasing 9mm pulleys, I recommend adding 2 belts for $10.

<h1>BUYER BEWARE</h1>

Before pictures, **please be aware**.  These pulleys will NOT fit on conventional caliber ii trucks.  Normal caliber truck axles are about 35mm.  23mm of that is usable, the remainder is the threading.  These pulleys will need about another 10mm axle length.

Punching out the pulley bearing will NOT work as there will be nothing to retain the pulley inside the wheel.  Don't do it.

Please see here for details:

And here's LHB making it work:

Normal caliber mounted:

Any extended trucks, ie TB 218mm, to no surprise works fine:

Now onto the good bits.

<h1>12mm 36t pulley</h1>

These pulleys are about 13.5mm wide, using 15mm belts shouldn't be an issue:

<h1>9mm 265mm Belt</h1>

Nothing much to add here.

I haven't run these long term but raptor 1 completes that use this pulleys are still running out there. 

these pulleys are injection molded not printed so should be much more durable
