Hi! I have a small batch of **3 pcs** motor mounts left for Caliber II and TB 218 trucks. They fit both 50xx and 63xx motors, can be mounted both forward or reverse and have idler pulleys to keep the belt tensioned and maximum teeth engaged. Perfect for those who constantly fiddle and test new setups :blush: 

Fits wheel sizes up to 110mm in theory (needs to be tested).
Should just about fit dual 6355 motors with 15mm pulleys (again, needs to be tested in practice).

7075 aluminum, blasted black anodized finish for that stealth look.

Comes with all stainless hardware and idler pulleys (two bearings). Price will be:

* 60 USD/50EUR for single setup
* 110 USD/92EUR for dual setup
* 10 USD/9EUR for pulley cover in black ABS+ (or you can get the STL file or step file to print and make your own versions)
* Shipping to US: 47USD trackable, 10 USD untrackable (no protection if lost)
* Europe shipping: 35eur trackable, 9 eur non trackable (no protection if lost)
* Canada 16 USD for non trackable.

Is it just me or does this mount look like a carbon copy of marcmt88's?

 Only differences I see are the motor side of the mount are rounded and the idler pulley cutouts slightly longer.

Edit: The clamp is different too. Whole thing is pretty close still.

I actually bought marcmt88â€˜s first version, and they did not have support for multiple motors, idle pulley, good ground clearance in reverse position. Thats partly why I designed these. I even issued the design to suppliers before he started selling similar designs.

Cool man, they look good. I wasn't saying anything bad about them, just pointed out that they look very similar to the one's I recently bought and chose because I thought they would be the best. Really it could be taken as more of a compliment :) 

Is the black paint or anodized?

I think it has more range than you will ever need. Here are some photos...if you flip the clamp you can also get even more range upwards, which may be nice for reverse mounting:

As for thicknesses, the clamp is 12mm, the plate is 6mm, except where the motor is mounted, there it is milled down to 5mm for more clearance in dual setups.

Any specific reason for that? You can take up slack with the idler pulley also.

True the idler can achieve that goal. With both you get maxmium different length belt compatibility possibilities, it's just feedback I do like it.

A 3d printed cover would be a nice addition.

I have a set of superflys that will need to live on something I may give you a jingle when the time comes & stop sending my money to @Kug3lis :joy:

I have been testing them on one of my setups with TB218 trucks, and they work fine. Want to test them with the other setup with calibers, but the weather here up north has been bad lately, I pretty much trashed the board running on dirty winter roads. I am confident they will hold up fine though if you want them now. Also I have been trying to get the shipping for US down prices down, but have not been able to find a better deal here in Norway. So its 47 USD for trackable package and 10 USD for untrackable (no protection if they get lost) to the US.

I had a lot of PMs lately so I will have to go through and make a list of who was first. I will PM you directly and ask if you still want it. Then I will update in the top if there are any more available sets.

I will make a small tutorial on how I mount these. I used two of the flat surfaces on the truck for aligning the clamp against (top and one of the sides), and the round surface  is just for pushing against with set screw. On caliber you use two set screws, but on the TB218mm you only need the top set screw, and the second is optional. It will make more sense when I make some graphical explanation later :smile:

These are sexy AF, I think they look a bit more high end then marc88's mounts. I already have marc's so I don't need any mounts right at the moment. 

I really like the clamp on these, more angle adjustment and the black anodize. :metal:t3:

Not sure about this, it depends if they will go clear of the idler pulley I guess. Shipping would be 20AUD for the cheapest option.

Hi Mikael,
The diameter of the pulley is 96mm.  Would this clear the idler pulley or would it bee too close?

Cheers,
```

Hi Pmac,

I would have to guess no. Putting my 90mm wheels on, its about 4mm left to the pulley when the pulley is tighened for the belt. That means a 96 mm wheel pulley will go clear,  but you need some space for the belt also. Edit: it could work if you have the pulley in the outmost position, but that would require experimenting with belt lengths to get it just right.

![image|375x500](upload://rzTcrq0pTI2t0YFbxbbLndyizzo.jpeg)

Edit 2: Another option would be to use smaller bearings, but you know what they say, bigger is better:

Hi Mikael,

Thank you so much for the information.  I appreciate the help.

Is there a chance you will be offering a longer mount?  I really like how adjustable it is in terms of being able to mount in front or behind the trucks.

Cheers,

Hi Patrick, I made this mount for my own builds and for the fun of it. Not sure I will be making more or other versions of it.

I will be on holiday for a week, if any of you are on the fence about ordering, last shipping possibility will be tomorrow, otherwise you will have to wait a week for it to get shipped.

Some small tips for mounting these after doing it many times now. Mounting these on the TB218 trucks is pretty straight forward, just remember to use loc-tite on final assembly.

![tb218|375x500](upload://ak6jsGlXErWY4ajkHGCb8E8wOwS.JPG)
Screw in all the screws loosely. Screw in the set screw at the bottom of the truck (curved side) so it just about locks everything in place , then tighten the clamp down. Go back and forth between tightening the set screw and the clamp. Done. Other set screws are optional based on truck variations.

Caliber trucks are a bit trickier since they have tapered surfaces. I usually use the wheel pulley to align everything up. Take away the inner speedring, mount the wheel, and then you have something to push against to align it. Fit all screws loosely. Screw in the clamp screw until you get some resistance. Screw the first set screw (1) down until the mount has a loose fit against the truck, not to much as it then will cause misalignment. Then tighten the second set screw (2), and then the clamp. Then go over all of them and tighten down hard.
![IMG_5605|374x500](upload://AnbzWNObboYNUGYj6wx9sFRaUF3.jpg)

When you add the speedring again, it should be a nice little gap between the wheel pulley and the mount:
![caliber|666x500](upload://jrweL3cYnrbTYSRTGgTzzm4bHsc.jpg)

Of course, depending on your motor pulley, this gap might need to be smaller/bigger to get a straight belt line.

These are highkey not even mounted correctly btw. After a couple of hard impacts you'll realize this. maybe the loctite is saving you for now. Correct me if i am wrong @Deckoz but you want the mount to be flush into the curve on the right side as that is where the force of impacts is received. If it is flush there is no space for movement. As you have it there is a ton of space for movement.

FYI the only set screw you "shouldn't" use is the one on the curved side. i use shouldn't loosely cause i use all and loctite all

![IMG_9093|666x500](upload://vpdIFAEnN84TMhW2fs0bZhQyoZU.jpeg)
Here's what mine looks like. It's tightened flush to where impacts occur.

Been riding these a while now on my "Landlubber" and they hold up nicely on this setup. No belt skipping whatsoever with 15mm belts, Kegels are locking up on hard braking, I am in the welterweight class (read lightweight). I think I will go down to 12mm belts as it seems more ideal for coasting. The ball bearings used for the idlers were not the best and started making rattle noises after a while, so I will swap out those.

Here is the .stl for the mount cover: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3010878

I am not able to edit the first post and add this in there for some reason.

Hi Mikael,

I might be interested in one of your mount if there is still one available, but there's one thing I'm not sure about.

I have limited clearance between my back truck and the ESC enclosure... So could you tell me how long the mount is?

Thanks!

Hi, I still have one left. The total length is 151.5mm. It is also possible to mount it in reverse with the motor out back.

Thanks for the quick reply!

Unfortunately, I much prefer mounting it forward. And I only have around 10cm from the center of the truck axle to the enclosure, so there's no way that'll fit I'm afraid. :frowning:

I see, I am working on a new version of this and think I will make it shorter with an optional idler tucked in behind the wheel. For max 40T wheel pulleys with idler and if you want to run 44T or bigger, you must run without the idler. Also two piece bolt on clamp to remove the need for set screws since people seem not to like those. Not sure if I should keep the slots for angle adjustment or make two fixed versions, one front- and one rear-mount.

Hi @Mikaelj , are you going to sell exclusively this new version? Or do you plan to produce another batch of the original version too? If you are going to produce some of the first ones could you please find out shipping cost for a dual set to Tahiti - French Polynesia post code is 98702. 

Thanks

Hi @Tamatoa, I have one left of the original and will not make more of this exact version, but it may be similar. If you tell me what you are looking for in a new mount, I would be happy to hear from you and maybe implement this. I have been working on several concepts for this new mount, but I will not publish anything yet as I have not landed on a final design.

thanks for your reply, I would like to try mounts with idlers and at the same time I would like to be able to use them with pneumatics too as well so when I can afford them i would not need to buy another mount. But as you said that on your new design you cannot use an idler with pneumatics I am wondering how is it possible to adjust belt tension in that case

It could clear the back end of the truck making the motor a bit higher and giving more clearance from the ground.

I am closing in on the final design now. Need to get quotes and estimated shipping dates from the supplier. After that some testing, so it will take a while. 

Because of my current job situation, I have had the opportunity to use quite some time on this lately, testing different concepts ,small details and 3D printing tests, and also looking at making other components searching for a good combination of parts that this mount will fit well with later on. I guess it's what a lot of us in here are doing, searching for a constantly better setup. I hope it's going to be one of the best mounts available...damn this esk8 thing is addictive! It's like a sickness almost. It's a lot of fun :sweat_smile:

What do you think of colors? Keep it black anodized (boring or good?) or have it in a nice color scheme (probably a bit more costly)? Really like this green color, maybe mixed together with black or natural anodised for the different parts:

* Go with color, black is boring!
* Go with black, it's stealthy and fits most setups!

So this is the new design. One short version for forward mounting and one longer for rearward mounting. Both fixed angle. Clamp fits both Caliber II 50 and TB218. Clamp is split in two with M6 screws, no set screws needed. Currently only for 63mm motors. Custom idlers are optional. Color and finish will be sandblasted and anodised black 7075 aluminium.

Great looking mount. Hey in what angle you decide to make them fixed? Iâ€™m making my own mount, so far i decided to use 18deg from straight to de deck. May i know yours? Thanks. (The inside mount)

This will depend on the length and shape of the mount, If I remember correctly I landed on 14 degrees for the inward version.

These are fixed with four M5 bolts. They can also be made with slots If people want that instead. It will be the same clamp for all versions. I just wanted to make a mount that will not move for peace of mind. Then depending on your deck you would compensate with risers.

Here you see how they are fixed angle. They could easily be made with slots for adjustability like the last version, but the first batch will be of fixed forward version:

Will the new clamps work with the previous version of your mounts? i have a pair, and my only issue is that the setscrews keep coming loose even with a bucket of loctite. So it would be cool to uppgrade to these setscrew free ones.

Sorry to hear that. The new clamp have different placements for the holes, so it is not compatible with the old motor plate.

Edit: just an idea @jourm , what if you use red threadlocker for a more permanent fixation of the set screws. And then you use the main M6 bolt with blue locktight to tighten it the last bit, so it will be possible to remove later if needed?
