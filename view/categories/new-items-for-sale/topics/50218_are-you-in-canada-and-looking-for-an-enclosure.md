No way! I do need an enclosure and I live in Vancouver.
Do you have the 12S Vanguard V2? Just the battery one (this one http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/eboosted-enclosures-thread/38073/289?u=louwii )
I'll be happy to meet you in person to get the enclosure

(and also, you chose the worst days ever to be in Vancouver, today was so crappy)
