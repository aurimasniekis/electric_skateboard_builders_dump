Awesome man does it come standard as a deadman's?

How many orders are you at so far and what is the expected time if you are in the 1st batch (in a normal color)?

Lastly noticed this on the order form "micro USB programming" does that mean you'd be programming the whole remote for us?

## \#14 Posted by: SeeTheBridges Posted at: 2018-05-24T03:55:24.377Z Reads: 652

Yes, it comes with the deadman switch on by default.

I've got 6 requests right now, and if everything doesn't blow up in my face, I hope to have the first batch shipping inside of 2 weeks. I will not be taking anyone's money until remotes are ready to ship as well, 

I will be pre-programming every remote, but that option actually refers to being able to update the remote from the charging port itself. Otherwise, if you'd like to flash a newer or different firmware, you'll need to open up the remote itself. I thought about including this standard, but it complicates the build process and is just a general pain to build into the port instead of just opening the remote and plugging in the Arduino nano directly.

I was only planning on selling them complete, but send me a DM. I'm sure we can work out a deal for just parts!

And batch 2 is gonna depend on how quickly I can get remotes out and order more parts. Shipping on most of the parts takes at least 3 weeks unfortunately, so I can't give a super accurate timeline unfortunately

Different design. I'd like to make my own trigger version of this remote instead of the thumbwheel.
I'm not great at programming on my own but I can follow instructions and solder pretty well.
I also happen to be working on a small housing to hold both a receiver and a Bluetooth module. I should be able to modify it for this.

I am all set to go for batch 2! I have been wanting one of these and have actually been attempting to assemble one, but due to my amateur DiY skills atm, I ordered this to ensure that my dual foc setup will have a working Firefly. Red bottom/top w/black trigger and thumb wheel :heart_eyes: 

My own Firefly would need the 1A charger, and the case I got for it has bits falling off; I've already superglued multiple points. Still, I'm going to follow your vids to finish it! I actually need a receiver plus my a divider (used to hold up the nano board) as my own had a whole corner fall off. I've actually been considering using hot glue to replace the corner & hold up the 4th edge of my nano board...would it be possible to order these parts from you as well, along with my own order?

It's a part of the thumb wheel that purposefully sticks out; instead of a smooth wheel, you have a protrusion on the wheel to more easily catch your thumb onto.

@uigiroux @SeeTheBridges mentioned that the first batch will be 2 weeks,  2nd depends on completion of the first batch. Parts also take 3 weeks to arrive. I would expect at least 1 month or more until he can start on the 2nd batch, but that is just a guess.

Will we be able to change any of the settings like on the Photon remote or is this mostly just showing us the info?    Either way I'm super excited.  The remote was pretty much the only thing I hadn't chosen and this looks fantastic!  How much would an extra receiver be if we want 2?

I don't think there should be any problem. I'm connecting mine to a dual focbox setup too so I guess we'll find out together lol

I'm assuming we can manage it with a setting change, and connecting correctly. May also depend if you're using split ppm or canbus. I'll be going through the original thread to confirm

My current build has a bluetooth module installed on the slave and is set to send status to the master

All settings and functions are the same as SolidGeeks and are dependent on whatever Sold and Death put out. For more info on features, please refer to the original firefly thread and GitHub

Unlike the other copies , SeetheBridges gives an option to update the Arduino via the USB port which is a big plus and why I’m getting a second one.

For sure; I tried to go through the og thread but there is little to go off of I think in regards to receivers. Since these are FOCboxes, changing the settings sounds plausible. 

I haven't figured out which Focbox connection method to use yet, but I am leaning to the split ppm due to the redundancy it offers. Mind if I pm you or setup a Focbox thread so we can go over the details and reference them later?

Two questions:
1. Where are you sourcing nrf? Are they reliable units? Do you test them? What range? What connection speed?
2. Are you printing according to Solidgeek's instructions?
_"When printing the parts I recommend printing the enclosure (top and bottom) facing down so that you won’t need any support. Use a high infill (+60%) and a low layer height (100-200 microns) to get a nice surface, and a strong remote. The material isn’t crucial, nonetheless, a carbon infused PLA adds that extra bit of strength, and give the entire build a more robust feel."_

Alright, let me try and address some of the things going on in this thread since I got back from shipping a remote.

A portion of every remote sale will be donated to Solidgeek as per our agreement for me to sell these.

My Firefly is the white one with Blue accents. I've been using it for at least a month straight almost exclusively. I don't think it's staining at all.

As for selling kits, I'm not opposed to it. It would actually make my order volume a little easier to handle as well. I'm not sure there's any good way for me to offer a complete kit though including wiring. If I offered just barebones kits with all of the components and housing (Optional?) without wires, would people be interested in that?

and to your questions @webst, I'm sourcing them from aliexpress. They're pretty reliable, but when they fail they fail. I am planning on testing each remote and receiver, prior to shipping them. I test them out to around 30 feet for a reliable braking connection through wooden walls.
I do print exactly to those specifications no. I do print at .2mm layer height, but at a 20% infill. I haven't found higher infill percentages to be necessary on my prints. they're quite sturdy at the current settings I have. If anyone has concerns over they can gladly shoot me a message and we can discuss a higher infill if they so choose.
```

## \#51 Posted by: deltazeta Posted at: 2018-05-24T18:51:35.483Z Reads: 307

If people want strength, look into increasing shell count. This usually produces stronger prints more efficiently compared to infill.

Couldn't you just add some sufficient lengths of wire to the kit? It's really just another component. The only other thing needed is some halfway decent instructions or wiring diagrams and that's it.

I dont think its necessary to include wire, that should be something anyone with a soldering iron has or can source easily.  If you do just post the lengths included in the kit and then everyone knows before they pay.  I appreciate you doing this, its a very complicated BOM to source, which is why most people haven't attempted this.

I charge $100 for my GT2B remote mods, that's about $30+ for about 1 hour of labor which is cheap compared to my day job. I always point people to my video of the process and tell them how easy it is, but people are willing to pay to be lazy or not having the urge to learn.

As long as you accept what you are paying for, life would be so much easier. Because everything is a mark up.

Yeah, this remote does a lot more.  Maybe think before you let stupid fall out of your mouth and start insulting people...

I feel like it's more than worth the cost. Hell I would have paid someone at least $20 just to source and put together the BOM into one nifty package to ship me. That alone is going to bring you to $60. You're paying for multiple things not just parts. While SeeTheBridges did not create the original design (portion of $100 going to solidgeek), he spent the time to learn it all, assemble and test before even offering the product/service.

I dunno if everyone has been through the og thread, but damn. It's a read. Say you can source all the parts + shipping for $30, and own/have access to a 3D printer. You'd still need to learn the assembly and programming, obtain and wait for all the parts and not in one easy package, and to stay at that price point not fuck anything up your first try.

For those that don't want to spend hours learning the project, ordering the parts, yadda yadda, $100 is a steal. Especially when compared to commercial remotes with less features and worse components for half that price. 

If you are the person who can order everything, learn everything, get it done well, and WANT to do it all, then you never needed a remote from SeeTheBridges in the first place. :smiley:

@Highwon I could probably ship to Sweden, but it's prohibitively expensive to do so. I did an estimate for UK shipping and it was an extra $40 to account for international shipping via US Postal Service. I'd probably suggest just looking for someone else in Europe making them tbh.

@JamesNothing Sorry I think I missed responding to you. I could possibly try and do that? I'd be worried about something getting damaged in shipping though. Not to mention international shipping is quite expensive 

TL;DR: $45 kits for the first 10 orders, $60 after that. $7.20 shipping. Payments due when ordered, delivery would start early/mid July.

Alright everyone, I've got some questions for those of you looking to just buy Firefly kits. I can order and assemble kits for you all, but with the volume of assembled order requests that I've received, I need to reconsider when I'm taking payments to be able to be able to do this efficiently. In order to be able to offer kits along with shipping batch 2’s remotes at the same time, I’d need to take orders and payments for kits now. Now my question for you guys is how many of you are interested in parts kits? I’ve been spreadsheeting like crazy trying to get some hard numbers on potentially doing this, and here’s my results. 

1. A lot of the parts for these remotes have actually gotten slightly more expensive since I bought batch 1’s parts back in late January, so moving forward I may need to restructure my pricing for assembled remotes slightly. For kits however, I’m going to need to be charging for shipping separately as a consequence of this. I’d be charging $7.20 via flat rate priority mail for the kits.

2. If I swap to cheaper generic capacitors for the receiver kit, I can offer the first 10 people who order kits a price of $45. After that, a price increase to $60 would be necessary in order to cover my next point.

3. There is no way for me to adequately test each and every part of the kits I’d be selling, so I had an idea. The most troublesome part of doing this build is definitely the NRF radio boards. Solidgeek has even mentioned they have a habit of breaking, and although I haven’t found that to be the case as of yet, it influenced this decision. I want to include a spare NRF radio board with every kit just in case one arrives DOA. 

Now timeline wise, I don’t want to make any promises that I don’t have any control over, but looking at average shipping times for these parts makes me think if I get Kit orders placed and paid for in the next week~ish, kits could hopefully go out by the first or second week of July. Then thereafter I would also keep stock of them available to ship when ordered. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I’ve just been giving this a lot of thought.

Thanks for going over everything for the kits. Some questions.

The 3D printed parts, can you make them an option?

Can you make the budget vs namebrand capacitors an option? Honestly I'd pay for branded every time.

And what do you anticipate the price for assemled will be? If the price gap between kit and assembled is close, I'm sure most would opt to have your cheap (at that point) labor. :slight_smile:

I'm in for 2 or 3 kits at the first batch price, and I can print my own plastic bits.

@deucesdown Yes, the price points I went over include EVERYTHING needed to assemble a firefly. 3D printed parts, wiring, and the spare NRF board. 

I could make budget and name brand capacitors an option, but it would be an extra ~$4 to account for it on each kit since I would be ordering name brand parts from trusted sources within the US already.

Assembled remote prices are already covered in the first post. I'm just gonna eat the slight price increase on components. So kits are looking to be $60 (after the first 10)+ shipping, while the base cost of assembled firefly will stay at $100 for now. 

As far as selling kits without the 3D printed parts, Right now my pricing only factors in the cost of filament used. I'm not even putting a $$$ value on the amount of time it takes to print or the troubleshooting I have to do when a print fails. So while I can ship kits without the parts, I can't lower the price an significant amount.

And I just realized I never factored in PayPal feeessssss. I can't afford to eat those costs either... a flat $9 for domestic shipping could cover it.

No, shipping would be combined. Just a flat $9 shipping charge for as many kits in the same order as I can fit in a flat rate box.The extra ~$2 should cover the first kit's PayPal fee and the shipping cost, and if someone's ordering multiple kits I can afford to cover the rest of the fee.

Thats the first layer we see there, right? Try to lower you nozzle just a little bit, and you will see these lines dissappear by 90%. The difference in layer height shouldnt show in x and y direction, only z (upwards). I think if you tune your printer a little bit, you should be able to print them in 0.3mm layer height, and still have very decent quality. :grinning:

Took it out for a spin last night! Everything worked great, I'll need to change a couple esc settings today to get it working just how I'd like but the test ride went off flawlessly.

Okay, at .015 "optimal" the print for all parts except wheels is 7 hours. Started it last night, still cooking when leaving for work this morning. :slight_smile: The print bed is about 60% full.

I'll post up photos tonight. At 8 hours (including wheels) per set, it's hard to do more than 1 set per day unless batching parts for a bigger run.

This is on a Prusa i3 mk3, which is supposed to be pretty fast. (Sorry, n00bish, first printer)

Because of the overhangs, I don't think this will print nicely with anything but PLA. Supports will leave an ugly finish. Will do the obligatory tests with ABS and PETG.

@SeeTheBridges $3 isn't even covering your costs, and everyone wants the higher quality prints -- you need to charge a bunch more for the 3d printed parts. ;)

Im planning on making a silicone mold for the case (as not real impressed with 3D print quality even if used ABS and vapor treatment, also vapor treatment can distort parts) this week, been preparing printed part for mold by sanding and painting to achieve smoothest quality.  Will post results as soon as im done for comparison.

The mold process is long but the results are worth it. I’m sure we would pay good money for it. I bought a remote from @FLATLINEcustoms just because of it.

Yeah, Im not sure Im gonna have time to get to batch 3. I've got A LOT of orders, and it takes a LOT of work just to get a single remote assembled. We're coming up on the 2 week mark of when I posted this thread and it's just taking me far longer than I anticipated to get orders out. I just sent out remote #5 today, completed #6, and setup for #7, so I'm pretty close to keeping pace with my estimation but not quite there yet. If I keep up this pace, I'll only put out ~35 more remotes this summer. There's 30 requests in batch 2 alone, so unless I can really up my output, batch 3 will remain in limbo.

I was thinking that maybe you can involved more people in order to have more time to actually build up the remote and for instance let prints the parts to other people. For instance I can help with printing, but I am in EU, so probably a limitation. Just an idea :wink:

I have no idea. I was about to type out that that's irrelevant since the Firefly uses its own receiver, so if you want BT and Firefly you need to run dual VESCs anyway. But since the new Metr hardware uses an NRF chip there may be potential interference between the 2... They use different chipsets, but I can't be 100% sure it's compatible yet. The only hardware I can guarantee compatibility is with the HM10 BT module.

It uses different kind of NRF chip and bluetooth. NRF used in Firefly uses proprietary Nordic Semi communication protocol which is not bluetooth.

Thats pretty much what I'm already going to be doing for Batch 2's kits already anyway. And I'd rather not get up as high has Photon's prices. He's using a custom PCB, well integrated and assembles hardware, and definitely knows a hell of a lot more than me. Plus it looks like Solidgeek is designing firefly PCB's now too, so I don't really have any standing to start charging as much.

@SeeTheBridges what print head are you using?  With my E3d i sometimes get better prints without a parts fan cooler and higher temps depending on object and # of bridges/overhangs.  reference Tom S. vids via youtube for some great knowledge on 3D printing

@Mikenopolis printed some filler parts to aid in buoyancy and other issues that needed attention before pouring mold (2 part mold), but satisfied with the actual parts being used for mold.  Mold boxes are ready to go.  will be pouring mold probably tonight.

I'm almost done shipping batch 1, and still waiting on pretty much all the parts for batch 2 still. Just received Charge and Boost circuit boards today, but in the break between I'll be working out my print quality issues.

3) I ended up with some spare parts so the first remote of batch 2 will be going out this week
4) I've been working on getting my printer quality dialed in. I replaced the build plate and mounting hardware, and the premium print quality is looking fantastic. Still working on standard.
5) The next part of the build guide is going up this week
6) And lastly, **I am closing the request forms.** Thank you for the all of the interest generated with this post! As I work through my orders, I may consider opening them again if there is sufficient time left before school starts again, but for now I will no longer be taking on any more. 

I look forward to everyone receiving their remotes in the coming weeks :slight_smile:

It probably depends on the 3D printer, but the prints that I got from 3DHubs had very small bolt holes, so they were easy to tap to 3mm size. I used M3x12mm bolts and they screw about 4mm into the bottom half. I imagine M3x15mm would be perfect

I don't use a tap which is entirely an issue on my end, but that bottom bolt is just a massive issue no matter what screw I've used. The design just doesn't allow for the bottom bolt to grab hold of enough material to be secure most of the time.

@SeeTheBridges I just got your parts kit today, and I'm excited to try out your custom PCBs :) Do you have any photos of the assembled PCBs I can use as reference? I just want to double-check before I begin soldering everything. The receiver seems a bit more self explanatory, but I'm mainly concerned about the transmitter end. Also, do you think I need to use solder paste to attach the NRF's to your boards, or can I pull it off with traditional solder if I'm careful?

Your PCB makes things much faster. Thanks for the photo, it's very helpful. 2 questions. The kit you sent came w/ 2 small caps (220 and 223) and 2 larger ones (both 100uF). I know about the placement of 2 of these on the receiver side, but is there a use for the other two somewhere on the transmitter?
Secondly, the male microUSB breakout that you have plugged into your arduino has 2 solder pads on the top, and 3 on the bottom. Can you help clarify which 3 points you have attached your yellow wires to? Or do you have a product link that may contain a pinout?

Right, so the kits came with 4 capacitors. 2 genetic Chinese ones since they're included with all kits, and then the 2 name brand ones. The smaller electrolytic cap is the Chinese one. The bigger is the name brand Rubycon. For the ceramics, the slightly larger ceramic one is the generic, and the smaller yellow ceramic one is the name brand Kemet. I'll work on a little imgur photo album laying everything out to make it easy to distinguish everything. 

Also general update for everyone:
All domestic kits have been shipped, springs for the effected users have been sent as well. Ive started international shipping on the kits.
Complete remotes will resume shipping this week. After I finish with the international orders.

Yeh 3d print is awesome. For me it came before than ESkate. I love them both though. One question. What do you see when the remote is charging? My micro USB port has really really small pins and I am afraid I didn't soldered them properly. @SeeTheBridges I used a 10K resistor instead of 5K because I didn;t have it. THe only downside would it be that my battery takes long to charge right? I am just try to understand if my battery is charging or not. Thx!

Where did you use the 5K resistor? For the battery indicator? Or for the charging circuit? Bc  use 4.7K resistors on the charge circuit, but for the battery pin (A2), I think you need the 10k resistor to make sure the Arduino is safe. When charging you'll see the TP4056 LED turn red, I think it turns blue when it's done.

My receiver code references the same libraries as the transmitter does (U8g2lib.h, rf24.h, and VescUart.h). You just need to adjust the pipe address in the receiver.ino file so it matches the one used in the transmitter.ino and you should be good.

I did offer a batch of 20 kits to help offset the costs of starting to sell complete remotes, but I'm not taking any more orders for now. Sorry!

Now as far as the issues with SetSerialPort, which sets of code and library are you guys using? If you're on the master branch, then you can use the master branch version of vescUART. If you're on the dev branch of the code like I ship all of my remotes with, you need to download the VESC6 branch of the vescUART library otherwise you'll get that weird error.

OK, sorry to bother you but I think I am really close. So in all the cases I use  https://github.com/RollingGecko/VescUartControl/tree/VESC6 the VESC6 branch plus U8g2lib.h, rf24.h.
Now:
-Case 1: I use the https://github.com/SolidGeek/nRF24-Esk8-Remote/tree/master, MASTER branch and the upload works for both receiver and transmitter. They can connect between each other. The LCD shows Esk8 remote when turn on, not FireFly so I guess is the old version. Problem, I can scroll inside the menu so the thumb wheel works but then doesn't work for accellaration and brakes.
-Case 2: I use the https://github.com/SolidGeek/nRF24-Esk8-Remote/tree/development DEVELOPMENT branch, seems more updated than the MASTER one. When I upload the trasmitter you can that the pipe line in the code is gone and indeed in the read.me says 
"Update v2.0

Update 2.0 introduces quite a few new interesting features to the remote, and fixes some minor issues from the past. The update includes:

**The possibility to generate a new address**
Receiver settings (transmitable from the remote)
Trigger- and controlmode is handled on the receiver
Calibration of throttle
Remote now uses channel 108"

So now you can see the address in the transmitter setting, although I can not change it when I enter the option.
In case of the development branch the receiver.ino program gives me this error:

If I used the development transmitter firmware with the master receiver software it doesn;t connect, but that it's understandable.

The two cases suggested that the the two parts can comunicate but with the DEVELOPMENT branch softwares I have a problem when I upload the receiver.
Do you know how to solve it? DO you know the serial port?
Sorry for the long explanation but it was the only way to explain everything.

Yes I did it. Actually it changes the default one. Thank when you turn one the remote in setting you will see generate address with the original one (if I press it I can not generate a new one) and after that default address which is the one that you can change and if you press it then you set the new one. My problem is with the receiver firmware that I get the serial error.
So if you are using the master when you turn it on you see Esk8 remote and not firefly. Right? 
With me the master works but my thumb wheel doesn't work for throttle and brakes. It does scroll the menu in setting though. Moreover how do you set the trigger ecc... There are only number there. 1 or 2 or 3

yes, in master I see 'Esk8 Remote' when I turn on my transmitter. Then, when I move the throttle up or down the OLED screen shows a bar graph that grows larger or smaller depending on how much I'm pushing the throttle. If I turn on debugging (by uncommenting out the debug definition at the top of the code) I can see on my computer the hall sensor numbers. they get larger when I throttle, and they get smaller when I brake.
If you turn on debugging do you see these numbers change?

Just remove the two / characters at the beginning of line 8:
![20%20AM|690x308](upload://wpVJ7CszJHwlJHqo8dH4zBhCPfz.png)
So line 8 will say '#define DEBUG' instead of '// #define DEBUG'
Basically it's just creating a new definition called 'DEBUG'. Then later in the code there are points where it says "if DEBUG definition is defined, then do xxxx". So normally it doesn't do these debug steps, but only if you remove the //'s. 
To see your debug output, just [open the Serial Monitor window](http://www.instructables.com/id/HOW-TO-use-the-ARDUINO-SERIAL-MONITOR/) inside the Arduino IDE.

Thanks then you read the hall sensor values and you change them in the code or later on the in the remote setting?
The nice thing of the development script is that you can see them live and you can adjust it.

It should fix it on the dev branch, but I think it breaks the master branch 🤷‍♀️ the master branch uses I think SerialIO as the command instead, so it won't compile on the VESC6 library. It's not a big deal, the master branch had serious freezing issues for me in my testing which is why I don't use it.

@rey8801 It seems you also have multiple copies of the VESC-6 library imported. You should probably delete the extra ones. Arduino IDE copies over the libraries into another folder, so depending on your OS you should find the folder and delete the extra copies.

I didn't request usernames on the form. Just name and emails. And not everyone even provided both of those. Best I can think of is just sending out confirmation emails to EVERYONE with their orders and then making a publicly available spread sheet showing order numbers, completions, and currently building stats. But quite frankly, I'm already working with and updating several spreadsheets now as it is to keep track of everything, and I'd rather not add another element on top of that.

It's not a huge deal! It's part of the reason why I print orders pretty far in advance. My average time from confirmation -> invoice is about ~a week normally. The last couple have been lightning fast because I've been building like crazy, but I also will hold a remote for at least another week before I consider moving it to the next person in line normally.

You can, but I do start printing the remote at the time of the email, so I do charge $10 extra for color changes on remotes that have already begun printing. If you want to change a color/check which color you selected send me a message sooner rather than later!

I have to print on rafts, so my first layers will never be smooth as glass. As far as nozzle distance, I’ve tuned it as well as I possible can without crashing it into my build plate. But the Cetus software Jim using just isn’t great as far as user control. Since I can’t use the gcode option I’m stuck with the options the official software has

Ah, yes..printing this with a draft will complicate things sadly, unless you can print with dissolvable filaments.

Best way to glue this together is probably acetone right?

Apologies for the lack of updates everyone. Summer got busy and I slowed down output quite a bit for a while there so I could enjoy the end of my summer. I'm leaving for school on the 16th, so I've only really got another ~3 days worth of building time left. Unfortunately, I couldn't get through all of the batch 2 requests. 

I do however have all of the parts for the rest of batch 2, so I can at least offer this: If anyone from batch 2 would like to get a parts kit, shoot me a PM with your email address and I'll get started assembling kits again. I don't have enough time to be printing kit housings though, so you'll need to source that yourself. 3Dhubs and Shapeways are both great options.

Apologies everyone, the reply notifications for this thread didn't make its way to my inbox. So setup wise, There's a couple things that need to be done. 

On the remote side, when powering on, press the trigger and push forward on the throttle to get to the settings menu. Here you can change the control style (ONLY WHEN CONNECTED TO THE RECEIVER), battery setup (# of cells and type), gear ratios, and calibrate the hall sensor values. I usually pre calibrated remotes before I shipped them, but I may have missed a few so it doesn't hurt to check. The options after the hall sensor values have to do with the PPM widths, don't mess with those. Then there's the generate new address and reset address functions. I'll be honest these don't always work that great so just avoid them. you can exit the settings on the last menu option. 

On to the receiver side, every remote and receiver is flashed with matching addresses, so as long as you didn't touch the generate address function on the remote, they should auto pair when powered on. IF you did touch the auto generate address function and it's no longer pairing, you'll need to refresh your receiver with the matching code, or just wipe both of them and flash again to get them to match.

On to the VESC side of the setup. With whatever VESC tool your firmware uses: BLDC tool, Ackmaniac's ESC tool, etc, you need to set your control type to "PPM and UART". Along with this, you need to find the baud rate setting for UART and set it to 115200. Last thing you'll need to do is find the PPM calibration page. With the remote already calibrated, just follow the procedure for setting your min, max, and center PPM values. After that, you should be ready to go. 

Really wish I had some more time to put the video version of this out, but moving in 3 days has me scrambling!

It should be relatively easy , Ive been meaning to do it , but work. One would just have to go in and create a new setting for switching between MPH and KPH and wherever KPH is shown just do the same for MPH but enclose it in an if else statement (if that's how solid dealt with setting parameters)

I'm looking to build one up soon (ordered parts enough to make two) so potentially if it works out ok I could make a couple. Though based in Australia, so that may not help you.

Better than the what, $200 before?

I would of actually considered this one if I saw it early, considering these are well designed remotes.

I'll keep you posted, if they work alright (and my mate doesn't mind doing all the printing for me :p ) I'll let you know. 

Parts should be in transit, so hopefully End of Feb I might get a start on the remote build

Going to move this to my own build page now to stop spamming this so you can keep track of me actually trying to put this together :slight_smile:

Is the firefly from @SolidGeek. 

Though I'm pretty sure they're both pretty similar. This only has thumb wheel, not sure if the feather remote has a trigger as well. There was another version with a larger screen getting about that I might try to build after this round

that print im pretty sure is the feather remote. i know it is cause the firefly remote uses a 128x32 oled and the feather uses a 128x64 oled screen. plus the location of the screw holes are feather's. Third, it is **way** to short to be a firefly.

This is the link I gave to my friend to print
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3322400

So fingers crossed he printed the right thing :p I'll find out next week when I go visit him to pick it up :) (else I might have to buy the bigger screen to build the Feather then )

Any chance i can get you to build me one now? i know its a long time since u closed the petition and since u last made a batch, but how much would it cost me to get a firefly remote built by you?

I think I'm selling mine, it was built by solidgeek for me. ![a0bcf7b60a68d7a27166ea070646bdc5e89e7a06_1_690x388|690x388](upload://9mEyn2zqmrVk4nr8utS44jXMFp2.jpeg) 

I haven't actually ever used it, I bought it in hopes of using it but never built a board in time. 

I would only ask 100 cuz technically it's used, it has the wriststrap, different colour and updated 'all in one pcb' from solidgeek. 
Pm me if interested

Finish was something solidgeek went crazy over with this, it does have one minor blem on the black side( one purple, one black) but otherwise it's a very smooth printing

E: sold.

No can do sorry. I've got a stockpile of parts at home for probably another 30 remotes, but I don't live at home during the school year. As such, I've currently no access to parts or time to build them unfortunately
