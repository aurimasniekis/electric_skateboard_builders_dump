NOMAD EVOLVED

This is the culmination of months of test upgrades we conducted during the first year in business. We have decided to move away from the evolve upgrade market to pursue matters dealing with eMTB builds and kits. We have had fun changing this thing from the stock Bamboo GTX and we wish to pass it on to someone who will get enjoyment from it. As we make these changes having and riding what you sell is important to us. We will soon have a line of Demo boards ready to show built around the MBS like of decks and geared toward affordability and quality. We are confident that we can meet both and bring a different dimension to the eMTB movement. With a Cruiser style option (under mount) and a Jumper style option (above mount) components. 

So a quick rundown of what's in it.

Deck, the deck used is a Bustin board 39-inch Nomad double dip, concaved and open-ended.
  the original evolve Bamboo GTX deck comes with the purchase.

Is this new or a test board? 

The parts alone cost this much. Too bad i already started building a very similar board

We are open to building more on an individual base.
