£30
Got a couple of these new. 
Can meet in London, willing to post if you can cover postage.
PM me if interested. 


The dead zone for acceleration is near zero! Slight push starts acceleration immediately. 
The reverse button is completely flush with the surface. 
The speed mode is three modes instead of two modes. 
The power on is a press button instead of push switch, which can be pushed accidentally. Now, a quick press turns on and a press and hold for 2-3 sec turns off. Very hard to accidentally turn it off.
The led’s are smaller and more recessed. No change in function.
