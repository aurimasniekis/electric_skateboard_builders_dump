I'm selling 2 new sensored SK3 6364-170kv motors for $105 each as I decided to go with different motors for my build. Located in NYC. I prefer to meet locally, but willing to ship within the US.

Hobby king. They look like turnigy sk3 just with the sticker removed. Did the same to mine

They are sensored so they probably came from one of the group buys that were held years ago

Or direct from the factory

@Bobby Matey there was a group buy directly from the factory a while back where they sold the sk3 motors with sensors.

Someone take these before I fold again... Did your GB up-spec anything else? Magnets, glue, bearings?
