In my struggle to buy wheels in the UK I ended up ordering a small batch of wheels

So. . . For sale. . . 

Blue 83mm wheels and orange 90mm wheels for sale. Both 78a but ride a little harder. (see pictures)

£32.50 for the orange 90mm's
REDUCED £22.50 for the blue 83mm's

Shipping - £3 for UK, £10 for EU

NQP
In this batch of wheels there are some small surface air bubbles on the truck side only, and only on some wheels. particularly on the blues (I've pictures the worst one I could see). In no way interferes with use or appearance when on board. See pictures.

Please PM me :)

Been riding great 👍🏻 I thought about 97mm but I thought they would be too big unless I used big risers. Yeah I've been clocking up the miles and they're rolling fine.

Nice never thought that you could dye them. Does the dye hold well ? Or does it fade ? Nice 👍🏻
