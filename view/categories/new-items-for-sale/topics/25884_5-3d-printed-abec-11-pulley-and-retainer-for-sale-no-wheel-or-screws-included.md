100% infill pla
- fits Abec 11 clones

- assorted orange and white plastic
I have 5 available, pictures and eBay link to follow shortly.
I have some time spare, so I may be able to print other sizes/things if you request.
£5 each + £2.80 postage (in the U.K.) 
Free postage for each additional pulley because I can just fit more in the box.

No biggy, I understand people have touchy issues.  I just didn't get the feeling that this guys was trying to actually steal a designa and profit it, just didn't know its not cool to print and then sell someone else's design.

Usually the mods either delete one or combine them.  I don't know the process.  I would ask the mods directly.

@JuniorPotato93  's design is under a CC license, meaning it CANNOT be sold and made profit under. What you could do is only charge the exact cost you made it for, or just charge shipping.

If you do not follow this guideline and change the price, we will be forced to close the thread.

@anorak234 please link duplicate thread

isn't 5 bucks already quite close to any estimated costs he had for printing?
At that price I actually feel like he is doing some guys a favor in offering this.

Well I would print this for under $1 AUD... unless he's using amazing PLA?

Seems he kinda wanted to offer this as a service and not selling spares...

Well his cost is not just filament right.
Just like driving a car is not just costing gas.

I'm not going to sell them any cheaper because eBay takes 13% of the fee and I got to pack them in a box, print labels etc. I found it really difficult to find pulleys delivered to the uk when I was new to this - it was always $12 dollars plus $10 shipping plus import charges - might be useful for someone new. 

As it stands, I've still got 5 pulleys which I have to shift otherwise it's wasted filament.

My printer is listed on 3D hubs - you can send whatever file you like to have printed. I've got no idea what the law is on lending your printer out but its supported by a large company so it seems legitimate. If you're in the filton Bristol area, I can sort you out with some cheap prints.

Well as long as @JuniorPotato93 is fine with it I am too. The duplicate thread has been removed so that is no longer an issue.

@lox897

The "No Commercial" license is for the 3D file, not for real objects printed with the file. He can charge $100 for the part and he would be both legally and morally in the clear.

If you disagree, consider this question: Is there anything wrong with someone downloading the STL file and uploading it to 3DHubs, and paying someone to print it for him? Surely we can agree that's legal? What is the difference between that and a 3DHubber offering these parts already printed, at a discount because he is "mass printing" them?

I honestly don't care 1 way or another about the wheel pulleys, I mean its only 5 bucks.  But the statement you made is absolutely incorrect.  If you download a model under the CC license you definitely CANNOT print and sell that object without the licensees permission.  Just wanted to get that out there so there's no confusion.

I'm not disagreeing with you...but there is a LEGAL difference and the difference offers protection to the licensee, which is why the license exists.

I have no legal background nor any citations to back my claim - I'll admit I was only using my own logic here...
Still, I feel like my logic holds. You say:

Can you back that up? I fail to see where the difference is?

Yeah I guess that looks like a good answer.

* So would a 3D-hubber be in the wrong if they printed a part sent to them that happened to be a CC BY-NC-SA part? **I think not.**
* If they advertised _"Hey we will print any file from thingiverse for you!"_ would they be in the wrong then? **I think not.**
* If they advertised _"Hey we will print any file from thingiverse for you, for example this wheel pulley!"_ would they be in the wrong then? **you say yes, but I'm still not convinced.**

Edit: I admit I'm probably wrong! it's just that I'm still not convinced.
