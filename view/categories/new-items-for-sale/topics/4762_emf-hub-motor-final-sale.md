@jacobbloy  I see your hubs here and there being sold at alibaba.com and I was tempted to ask them, so I asked them, are they working with you?. Many suppliers/factory from China have claimed to be working with you (that they currently are working with you, that the hubs they sold are your "true design"), but I think that they most prolly copied your design and bullshitted all the way, Eg. Freerchobby and Maytech..... Are you working with freerchobby or maytech? I believe that their claims will bring bad reputation to your hubs (they sell sub-quality hubs to everywhere, with your design), people will start thinking thousands of possibilities, so ,  I just want to clarify this here. No offence or any personal interest here, just so that everyone knows you are selling the best hubs.
```

I do not Have them made in any of these factories, i have been making hub motors in china for a long time and there are many that are basing there design off of my motors and or an old design. and maybe an updated design.

some thing you have to know is my hub motors are very expensive to make compared to a normal out runner and most china factories will cut corners.
but also a lot of companies who are selling motors in china are just agents and are actually not the factory and are buying them from the factory.

## \#56 Posted by: jacobbloy Posted at: 2016-06-22T06:49:49.938Z Reads: 413

```
Sadly this was not possible as it was about $6000 for the front wheels and about $10000 for the motor wheel. because of mould cost.

The wheels that will be shipped have Australia urethane with aluminium moulds that i had made my self.
You will see that i have made a custom front wheel mould so i had to source the centre core of the front wheel (abec 11 clone) This was not easy as no one wants to sell just the core.

I also have a mould with a proper wheel factory fro the front and motor wheels but this mould was delayed so it won't ship with this order but i will offer them as a very cheap upgrade as i have put a lot of money into these moulds and the urethane so i want every one to have them. i have had to order over 2000pcs of the front and motor wheels with this mould.

@DeathCookies what dimensions would you like. the hanger is 180mm and 150mm but because of the motor offset both work out to 180mm. the truck has standard hole dimensions and it is a 45deg base plate.

I would say as I have said before, lots of China motor factories are just agents for bigger factories. But I would say some one is connected to my factory they are using pictures that I have posted around the internet my self. If if them that I took my self.

Sadly there is nothing any one can do about it. China will copy and break agreements if they think they will make more money.

Hey there, Planning on getting some of your hubs, but i'd like a double check with you to make sure my build idea would work, running a spacecell pro4 with 2 VESCS and a set of your dual hubs for a 55kg person and hills. 

Is the spacecell the best option for a battery with these hubs considering the 40A fuse limiter.
(forgive me if these questions aren't allowed here, i'm new)

Quick question @jacobbloy I am prepping a build to bolt these onto when they arrive.  Have two battery options, which is not my area of expertise by any stretch of imagination lol, a 10s3p or 12s2p pack.  How should I think about which is better choice for these hubs + dual VESC, where my concerns are probably around enough torque primarily and top speed secondarily?

Simplistically I would assume higher voltage over higher capacity, so lean 12s2p or am I off base there.  For context, I am 190lbs and mostly city riding medium length range and only a few hills but acceleration torque is needed and can't crap out on the few hills I do encounter <g>  Any guidance for while I wait? Thanks!!

```
the decision is based on the speed you like to ride at. if you are only riding ar 30km/h then 10s3p all the way as it will give u more range. 12s will only help with efficiency if your riding at 40km/h.

So currently we are around 552 but not exactly because there is also nunchucks in the list.

I started shipping standard sets so the default is black on black do if you where with in the first 25 sets sold but have requested orange you will be shipped very soon...

No tools included and not necessary imo.
Please remember that the trucks are modified to fit the hubs.
So if you want to switch the trucks you need some skills to modify the hanger. If you have these skills I'm sure you have some hex keys as well ;)

Bushings squeak and squeal like a Walmart board. Wire gauge on the hubs is like 14? Maybe less... Super thin. Urethane is super hard like a hard plastic.  Not real Paris trucks. 

But hey the packaging is nice..

Do you happen to have the hummies for a comparison? It's this kind of heathy critisism that might convince me to chose between these and the hummies.

EDIT: no bad feelings towards jacob ofcourse ;) you've got to produce these somewhere and profit has to come from somewhere.

I was slightly skeptical on these being a bit to aliexpresslike if you catch my drift. And the things you just mentioned kind of confirm it.

 I've had 2 hummie hubs and now Jacob hubs. though I haven't  gotten a chance to drive these yet. My first impressions of hummie hubs were a lot better they had a lot of weight to them and just felt professional.  

These look better but don't have that feel of quality. they honestly feel like a toy. But. I won't know till I drive them. These are just first impressions.

Hey guys, in every said that I would be sending proper Paris trucks, I don't know how you would expect to pay $249 or $299 and get Paris trucks and ABEC 11 quality urethane. 

But the urethan is Australian it is just hard because it doesn't have rebound properties but when tested on a duro tester it still pops out at 80-83a.
I produced these moulds my self because of the time constraint. 

Good news is a have proper mould with still not the best quality but higher quality urethan. My moulds are finished and I got the sample. The sample is 78a way to soft for this application. But the problem is the MOQ for the wheels is 1500pcs per wheel but when I raise the money I will be happy to rend a set to any one free of charge.

Also, hummies phase wires will also be thin maybe not has thin because he uses delta (Wye winding halfs the phase wire strand count) but he has had the factory solder on multi strand silicone wire that does nothing to improve the performance of the motor.

Just received them. Everything looks good, and it also comes with a pretty helpful instruction booklet. But if I really have to nitpick, I would say that the wires are indeed small (around 16awg), so probably shouldn't do more than 30a continous and 40a max on each motor with these. However, it is more efficient to stay below 30a anyway due to the heat, or so I believe. Also, I have measured one of the trucks and compared to my Paris, and it is little bit shorter than 180mm. Because of this, the front truck looks a little bit shorter than the truck on the back. I'm sure this won't affect the performance anyway. Either way, I'll probably going to change it to Paris trucks and 14awg motor wires. I didn't think the kit would come with a pair of trucks at first, so it is just a bonus anyway.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c445ffef9aa98ed6e0ed414e0841a82bcdc98a65.JPG" width="690" height="388">

I know that one of them is 180mm and the other is 150mm. I was trying to say that one that was supposed to be 180mm is not exactly 180mm, but a little bit shorter than that. It doesn't really make much of a different I don't think, so I was just being a little bit too nitpicky I supposed.

I think a test where the vesc amp settings to the motor will reveal a lot.   What were the settings?  

I'm pretty sure the motors I sent tic matson are 90kv which is more suited for flats and speed. But given enough amps the limits of the motor will show.   Going faster with more amps up a hill will keep the motor cooler than less amps going slowly going up the same hill

But Jacobs are bigger and surely given even an appropriate amperage for the kv his will stay cooler.

i think if its set at 40 to the motor but 20 from the battery you can still get 40 to the motor as the voltage is converted to amps.

It's tru but it depends on the speed, generally it can only does this at low speed!

When watching current draw on the hill kaden filmed riding your motors I get peak current draw of 22a per motor. But the board can stock half way up the hill and keep going and still not go over this

Just received my EMF Order today and I’m so stoked! They look awesome! The day is finally here! First Impressions: To be fair, I don’t have any frame of reference, as this is for my first build but, apart from the bad, very thin motor leads (See Below), these seem, at least at first glance, like awesome motors, and a good kit, They feel sturdy and of good quality.  

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/ee50228885dda3aa2cf67bd149d813491f2eecbe.jpg" width="394" height="500">

I do however have 2 things that I’d like to point out. straight outta the box, one of the two motors seem to have been rushed, 2 of the 3 motor leads have some serious “bends” in them to the point where I actually think that one of the two “damaged” wires, are broken inside the insulation. Now sadly i can’t test, my hypothesis right now, as I still need to get VESC’s and a battery built, but it sure feels that way…. 

|Solved perhaps....|   It's a litte hard to tell from the picture, but it seems broken, it easly bends past 90 degrees in a sharp point. :/

Now the other thing is a smaller cosmetic thing and is also partially my fault. When I ordered the EMF I also ordered a set of spare Thane, and I know there’s been some confusion with the colors of the orders, but I recieved BLACK wheels and ORANGE spares, that means that i “can’t” use the spares with the front wheels, and this just seems really silly, now I did not specify what color I wished for, but I did assume at least that they would be the same color xD Sorry for the rant, @Jacobbloy Keep working at it and you’ll have yourself some amazing motors IMO! :D

Got my hubs in the mail. They look nice. I wanted orange urethane but I received black. I want them to match my kegel front wheels as the ones supplied are pretty bad even wobble. They come with no loctite on axle or grub screw and I lost a grub screw already no big deal. Haven't tested them because enertion vesc are months behind I knew I should have bought from ollin. Things that would have been nice are silicon wire, 3.5 grub screw because 1.5mm hex strip easy, shielded bearings, female plugs for the ESC, and drill template. Also hope there is a 90mm motor urethane in the works because I already dented the cap just pushing around my neighborhood I wouldnt mind hot rodding it with 80mm wheels in front and 90mm in the rear.

I agree 100% !! 90mm is just so good to ride, having these hubs with 90mm should increase also top speed at some point, and shouldn't decrease torque as it is already 70kv with enough torque.

well mine is one of the early models and it relies 100% on that grub screw to stop the motor from rotating on the axle.
I had to file a flat in the axle for that grub to sit in. however now that the rotational force is held with the side pins and the longitudinal force is held by the sleeve nut. I'm not sure that grub actually does anything much anymore.. still can never have too much mechanical force..

No, its real and the delays are reasonable. Consider it this way:

Instead of having the motors shipped to him in Australia, he gives the production facility a list of addresses (thus not double paying on import tax).  Only issue is that any company you work with for small volumes gives fewer than 2 craps about your order given that its low volume (take it from me and Enertion, if you order less than 100 you're a low priority).

Jacob is developing and selling these on his own time. Its pretty damn time consuming and its impressive that he's doing this at the same time as he works at Enertion and develops a circular VESC.

Well, seeing how a lot of us got our hubs the 1st week of July, as stated, no, it's not a scam. I don't know if or when you placed an order, but based on when i bought these, at least 25+ people must have gotten their hubs on or before I received mine last Thursday, 7/7.

All the guys selling stuff on this forum, and making it possible for us to build boards, are doing it from out of their garages in their spare time (maybe Jason has moved to full time) developing and prototyping new hardware with no budgets and your calling bullshit on a week delay.
This isn't Amazon, please have a little patience and appreciate what they're doing for the community to make esk8 easier and better.

Honestly, I'm expecting that the ETA is up to date. I mean if he is able to put this ad here, he should also be able to update his shop system (which he obviously does by making 30 units available). 

@Bender
Second, he did not sell anything in the forum but from his webshop. At least his website claims to be a shop, even though there are no GTC visible for me. 

So you think he is selling at cost price? Because he is so nice to spend his spare time and contribute to the esk8 community? I don't think so... 

Besides, a week delay is over now. And based on the comments of others in this thread I'm expecting at least a month. And yes, if the ETA is about a month off, it was just bullshit.

Your welcome to a refund. I fully expected to have all of them shipped by now but things happen.

By my cost price for just the motors is very good. But then we have wheels, front and back both different. Moulds to make the wheels, my proper mould that I did not have time to use.
Trucks, machining the trucks, bearings, the box mould fee, the box it's self the instruction booklet.

motor kv vary but it should be about 70 maybe a little lower at 65v, i have gotten 34km/h or 21miles and i defiantly still had throttle left,basically should get 40km/h on 10s or 45km/h on 12s.

but you can check your kv in bldc tool in the terminal tab, type in kv and it should print out your motor kv in electrical RPM divide that number by 14 and that should be your normal kv rating then post it and i will let you know.

I weigh 95kg. To be fair i did get 25mph on full charge but quickly dropped to 23mph. Using 5.6ah 12s lipo. The hub motors have nice torque but after 3 days of testing they're basically unusable the urethane slips like no tomorrow and the vibrations are so nasty when that happens. I want to like them so bad but it's just a bad design. The little "teeth" can't handle the torque especially with the "soft" urethane.

Yeah they're too small. I think they need to go all the way across to the other side and four more should be added to make it eight large teeth. This would require a mold that should be done in 90mm urethane to protect the motor cap and so you don't feel the teeth or the road.

The teeth need to connect and the ridge on the thane is there. Maybe we could glue something in between the teeth. But a real fix is adding more teeth and harder thane that doesn't soften with heat these motors see. I hope @jacobbloy has a solution. 

One thing I noticed and idk if it's by design is that the magnets aren't centered. So it's off based on my measurements by 1mm to the stator

@jacobbloy Did you say that there would be upgraded replacement urethane that you would be sending out soon? I've only got about 3 miles on my hubs, and one of them is making a really loud, intermittent squeaking sound, like the urethane is loose on the hub and squeaking when it rolls. Definitely gets worse on my toeside wheel when I lean that way. Otherwise, the hubs themselves feel quite powerful.

Hey Jacob, is there any way you can redesign the mould so that you first pour really hard urethane and once cured put that in the center and then pour soft on the outside. I have worked with urethane before and cured seems to bond very well with the uncured.

@jacobbloy this has been a real dissapoitment, the urethane issue just did not appeare at the last minute, I know that this is a prototype but man you should have mention it. 

It will be helpful if you make the cad drawing of the Hub wheel available in order for us to try to make usable urethane wheels. We can use @Hummie suggestion for him to make the wheels. 

I know you I'll prefer to do the wheels your self but you do not have time or money for this and meanwhile we are stuck with unusable devices.  So please let's share the CAD info and solve this together as a community.  :grinning:

looking at the pictures I realized that even though the wheel has the notch going all the way through from one side to the other the hub itself does not have an equally long bulge. So there must be an airgap there which might decrease the friction so substantially that the wheels slip. Introducing a longer screw that connects both sides might solve this issue. Anyone know a different solution?

with the current design you can't just make a different wheel - the airgap has to always be there otherwise you can't mount it. Only solution is to fix the problem on the motor filling the empty space with whatever. Designing a 2-piece wheel with harder inner core will be complicated and expensive - it is probably better to fix it motorside once and for all and then just use the standard wheels. Also I actually don't want to wait for another 4 months for new wheels to arrive.

I hope @jacobbloy comes for the rescue with for example a CAD file for a 3D printed tube fitting perfectly between the bulges and having the size of the gap. Slightly longer screws would hold it in place on both sides and some epoxy could also help to glue it to the motor housing. Sounds to me like the easiest option: 
print 4 tubes, epoxy them to housing, screw caps on and you are done.

I wonder why nobody from the previous batches mentioned this issue, considering how serious it is. I haven't tested mine yet, but it is very disappointing if it is turning out to be the true. I expected these motors to have minor issues, but having the urethane wheels coming loose is unacceptable. Basically, we are all stuck with a $300 paper weight.

Hey guy I'll post a PDF file of the wheel dimensions.
Iv used this design for the whole time Iv been making these motor, from drilling out wheels to having them Moulded, I have shipped over 100 motor of different designs to customers and ridden them my self, and no one has ever had this problem.

The batch before this one I pored the wheels my self but I had only sold 30 motors but I only had one customer telling me this had happened after he had soaked the wheels in dye.

I live in Australia and have ridden them in 40c temp and never had it slip before. 

Urethan has a tendency to shrink after moulding process and there are steps to prevent this, because of the quantity I could not do this my self so had a company do it for me but it seems that there process is not the same as the wheels I made where a hard press fit into the motor and actually had to put your body weight into it.
 
In about 1 week I will be getting some samples from Koston of a 83A wheel that is a much better fit.

I will send these to some customers who have had this problem and let them provide the feed back!

I am sorry for this!

Hrm.

Hummie Hubs feature a crazy flux ring and Thane solution.  They're slipping too.  ABS core might be required with a 95mm Thane.  The flux ring does help with his magnets, but applying that design to the field density on yours won't be super effective in terms of machining labor to power increase. It probably won't help keep the Thane on either. 

ABS cores seem like a requirement.

@Maxid Sorry, I haven't even had a chance to even go for a short ride in the last two days, but my plan is to at least go around the block a few times tonight. I'm optomistic about the grip tape, since it makes the urethane fit very tightly on to the hub, but it's not impossible to put on. 

Also, I'm thinking that those unfilled channels in the urethane are what are squeaking as they get compressed against the hub when loaded down with my weight. Also, as they heat up, I think the urethane stretches and expands a little bit allowing more play between urethane and hub, and therefore more squeak. Other than that sound though, I don't have any noticeable wobble, and the wheels roll smooth. But, I've only put a few miles on them up and down my block, so these are just first impressions.

I'm a lurker, but I've also ordered a set of hub motors. So I'll pitch in: Why not fill in the gap on the hubmotor with metal epoxy (https://goo.gl/images/S4uaCz) and aluminium strips.
Excess epoxy, when fully cured, can be filed or sanded. It will behave almost like metal. That way there won't be an airgap. There will be loads more surface area for the urethane to hang on to/push in to, to prevent skipping.
My question to @jacobbloy is: Why didn't you choose to engineer the hubmotor with full "teeth" in the first place? Is there an advantage to your design that I'm not seeing? 

If that doesn't work... I'll scale the urethane up to 90mm and insert a ABS or nylon 3d printed core in the urethane.

Edit: when I eventually receive the hubmotors ofcourse.

I tried grip tape but I think it made it worse. The urethane has stretched to much at this point from heat I assume when I used it as a single. I do want to fill in the gap between the teeth and think it would be beneficial to add even more teeth. Epoxying some metal could work.

Well, the grip tape fixed the squeak, but now the urethane is starting to shift off the "teeth" causing serious vibrations. It seems to happen mostly when accelerating moderately hard, and a hard braking will put the urethane back into place, but it's kind of a bummer. I only weigh about 170lbs. and have literally never left my block with these hubs, having put around 5 miles total on them. So I don't think weight or mileage is a factor for me. I'm gonna try the second set of orange urethane and see if that performs any better.

From a design perspective, i really don't know why the hub "teeth" don't go all the way across, cause it seems like that would make slipping urethane a non-issue. I'd like to find a way to use some kind of bolts or rods to span the tooth gap, but haven't figured out a good way to do that yet.

Its great that you're trying to fix the issue, keep us posted. Imho the "airgaps" between the hub and the urethane in between the teeth gives room for local compression and stretching of the urethane during stressful riding. Causing the urethane to slip. This is the thinnest point on the urethane, making it more flexible here. You would get 4 large stiff sections with 4 small flexible sections and the stiff parts are skipping over the small teeth where the wheel isn't making contact with the road (which is the most part).
 If the urethane would make full contact with the hub, there would be more grip between the two and the urethane would have a consistent stiffness.
Hope you can fix the issue. Can't wait! Really want to make my board with your hubmotors.

Here's a way to fill the gap between motor sleeve inner and outer bumps. Just need to machine a long motor sleeve bump with a hole all the way thru and mount it in between the two bumps that are already there with a long screw. In the picture, the bottom of the motor shows the long bump in place and the top of the motor shows the long screw in place without the long bump.

This is just one way to fill the gap and it would be exactly the same size and shape as the original bumps. Just an idea, but seems like the right way to do it.

The original bumps should work fine, though. That means a thane problem. Fix that and problem solved.

Jacob, I have not tried this since I do not have my hub motors yet. I'm sure this is the proper way to "fix the air gap". Possibly the short bumps combined with the urethane you used makes for the problem. I think, depending on the type urethane wheel used, short bumps can work. A long bump that fills the air gap can only help.

I'm sorry, I wish I could help, buy I need the motors to measure for machining.

Also, the grooves in the wheels will have a radius of the diameter of the end mill used. This radius must match the radius of the bumps very closely. Tolerance is very critical. The wheel must fit the motor very tight and the radiuses must match.

Not sure if if my idea is rediculous, I don't know much about this kind of thing.. But from what I gather the utathane isn't sticking to the actual motors because the bumps aren't enough for it to grip onto. 
Would using a layer of adhesive across the inside of the utathane stop it from slipping?

I think really the weight pushing down on the open air channels starts to misshape the thane, then this is compounded with speed, heat, and pressure, creating a downward spiral to deformed thane. This is just a guess though 😀

Low start up torque is a design control, but not a holistic solution. That control may fail when it doesn't mitigate the situations @LEVer has described. I'm really surprised if there isn't more to it.

There selling a product that needs to be safe for consumers and it's a complete product. So they will have alot more safty features built in then your average DIY build and the they are making these specific to one product not 20.

It make controlling the outcomes in different situations a lot simpler. Boosted board have done it also. 

We are talking about winding temp limiting and acceleration and brake curves, top speed limiting.

There is only so fast you can brake at 20mph so the 2 options are you come off your board because it's to abrupt or you hit the object you are trying to avoid.
Some where inbetween that I guess is a point where you can break effectively with out urethan slipping.
 But this has gone off topic a little, the talk about urethane slipping is great as this is the solution we are trying to find. Inboard have announced shipping and I would hope a thread gets started when they do.

oh man - just got the letter from DHL about import duties to Germany :frowning:
Thought I got lucky and it slipped through.
How much did you have to pay? They somehow added 86€ to the 100USD invoice price as a "Hinzurechnung".
Had to pay 33€ tax and 12.50 DHL fee which ended up being 48€ with sales tax.

A bit off topic but important. Do you have shipping costs on the invoice. If not, DHL adds horrible costs for shipping to the invoice price. I just got two VESCs from enertion and it was free shipping, so there was nothing written about shipping on the invoice. DHL added € 125,- for shipping to Austria and so I had to pay taxes for this.  I'm waiting for jakobs hub motors and hope he will add the costs for shipping on the invoice for DHL.

No shipping on invoice - that is probably where the 86€ are coming from. In your case you should contact dhl however - as far as I know you have a right to get taxed correctly. In my case it was still cheaper than the actual price so I just payed without protesting.

Received today (actually they were at the DHL depot for a while, anyway) I like the packaging and the manual (also the price was good too ^^) - I will test them on good asphalt and try to not stress them too much, hopefully the urethane will stay in place, otherwise I'll try to put a bit of glue on the edge if this starts to happen.

I had gotten an email a few weeks ago from Jacob saying he was going to try and fix the slipping urethane issue before he sent more sets out. 

Fwiw, the urethane seems to stay in place if you don't accelerate too aggressively, so if you are just cruising and not trying to drag race, I think they should be totally usable until the new urethane gets sorted out. It seems like they just have so much torque that the urethane can't hold on if you try to unleash all of the acceleration potential. I still can't speak for high mileage longevity though, since I don't have time to actually ride very often.

The new urethan is of a lot higher quality and its is a little harder. I will post a video soon explaining the wheel problem a little more. Basically the current urethan you can push the edge with your finger you can see it lifting off of the motor. The new urethan can not do this.

Also it is a bit of a tighter fit.

I tried and tested replacing the motor can but the expense here is also replacing 28 magnets that cost about $1 each plus the $15 cost for the actual can.
This still might be an option in the future.

Instead I'm looking to make some inserts to fix the problem.

Its about finding a solution. Right now you're the one working on the problem, on your own, by your own choice. I get that you have a lot invested in this project. I, for one would have accepted the hubmotors "as-is" with the current urethane and get a later revision of the urethane and pay for it as well. That isn't the option you have chosen and I praise you for doing so. But I'm sitting on my hands here, I want to help. Your customers are this community, and some want to help. Others want there money back. If you were running a normal shop, then all the customers would be wanting there money back by now. The reason I didn't ask for a refund, is that I want you to succeed.

This is the drawings of the rotor, the wheel is meant to match if not be a smaller radius then this but it isn't, it instead shrunk in the moulding process and is more like 34mm plus very flexible so it is compressing in the centre and allowing for the wheel to slip.

the new urethan is 31mm internal radius so it is tighter plus doesn't have as much flex but is better quality so it doesn't feel harder on the road.

I'm only using one motor right now on 10s, and I haven't noticed any slipping so far. Maybe it's different when I'm riding a dual hub setup, but I don't see how that possible because I would fall off the board if I accelerate any faster. With that said, the urethane should be designed with tighter fit because I can definitely see a gap between the motor and the urethane if I really try to lift it.

Running dual on 12s, I got up to about 25mph (40kph), but I think there is still a little more throttle left, since I was running Multistar (weaksauce) batteries on my short 30" board, so it's hard to keep it floored for very long before I get uncomfortable going that fast on that short of a board. I did have urethane slipping issues under very hard acceleration when kicking off, but if I ease into the throttle a little bit, they stay put, and when braking hard, they seem to stay put. So for now, I think they are totally usable, I'm just not able to tap into the full acceleration/torque potential at low speeds due to the slipping urethane. They seem like quality hubs, and feel quite powerful and torquey. Once the urethane is sorted out, I don't think I'll have anything left to complain about. Lol. Good luck @jacobbloy! We're all rooting for you. :thumbsup:

Hey @jacobbloy ,

today I inspected the motors I got and thought about doing two single motor boards. Did you ever publish that 3D file for the truck holes?

Also is the diameter of the motor cables supposed to be this thin? I measure 2mm but can still pinch them to even less because the shrink tube does not even fully enclose them. They are also quite long which gives me concern about the currents going through them. Is that an actual issue to worry about or standard on motors like this?

Thanks!

Current is recommended to be limited to 40a, the wires are this thin because of the Wye winding, basically it is half the amount of strands that is used in a normal motor because 3x phase wires are terminated together.

I ended up putting a pair of $20 wheels on a drill press and cored them.  They were a snug fit - I had to press them on. Since I didn't cut 4.5mm Arcs, it rides a little lumpy.

In the latests Enertion mail, I saw a hub motor design that looked like a hybrid between the Hummie and Jacob's hubs.  Interestingly enough, its spot on with the design I just filed a patent on so we'll see how things develop if/when the patent gets awarded. #40mmStator

Not true. Prior art is one thing, however innovations on prior are what you can patent as separate inventions or as additions to art.  The ratios of certain component sizes within a design (for example) also constitute as patentable material. 

See the Stealth Boards original Hub motor patent from Colorado in 2013 (filed a few years before Jacob/Hummie worked on their designs). They all share a lot of features, but a unique.  Intellectual Property patents are designed to preserve prior and future art.  As we have probably read on these forums, China companies we've worked with disregard ownership laws (something both Hummie and Jacob have suffered from).

Patent filing and lawyers are pretty expensive and there are an excessive number of patent fraud schemes out there, so do research before putting down any money.  Also, getting the patent and filing it are two separate things.  Think about how many different selfies sticks there are out there (for example).

EDIT: I also paid for a copy of Jacobs early designs for reference and comparison.  It was different from all others I had seen before [but performance of windings and magnets aside, physically only made the motor quieter].

I have used threadlocker for the screw on the truck, so I'm not sure why this happened.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/d/d7a9bde9197cc312a867098f0b26ac92c3704b96.JPG" width="281" height="500">

Hey guys for those with skipping utathane.. @blair thought  of using heavy duty scotch double sided tape. It has worked really well on mine. Shoe goo didn't work for me even when applied liberally. Just a warning that the double sided tape will mean old utathane needs to be cut, heated and peeled off.

Indeed too late for pics but we took off the utathane  so the can was visible, and simply applied 1 layer of thick scotch double sided tape between the bumps. We then carefully slid the utathane back on (pro tip, don't waste your time time because the tape doesn't waste time setting) if you need a better explanation I can probably come up with one

Pro-tip: coat the outside of the tape in mineral spirits. The spirits temporarily deactivate the glue and lubricate the surface, allowing the urethane to slide right on.  It'll evaporate within hours and the glue will hold nice and tight. It's how golf grips are applied. 

Hell, just buy a golf grip kit, the tape and solvent are designed for this kind of application (metal to rubber adhesion). @Hummie, you might want to try this as well if you have any urethane that is slipping while hot. You can use the same solvent to scrape the tape off later if necessary.

Iv already exhausted all of the money given in preorders for producing and about $4000 has gone out in refunds. the motors clearly they have some issues. If you would like to make a PayPal dispute please do I can not refund you direct as I have no money but PayPal will still help you and chase me for the money. I already have a PayPal dept collector calling me because my account is in negative.

I still have the motors and if I find a suitable fix or you want to find one your self I will ship them to any one who is left as this is cheaper for me.

I'm sorry for letting every one down honestly I just tried to reach to far with making moulds and boxes ect but I think every one has waited to long.

Hi Jacob,
I have sent some emails to Vesc.net.au but am not sure if you are getting them?
The questions are;
 I weigh 100kgs, is the XL motor more tourquey than the 83mm or does it just have more top end speed?
Does this motor run cooler than the 83mm?
What is the steepest grade hill I could expect to go up with out damaging the motor?
Is there a you tube video for this motor?
Thanks
Chris

Hey Chris, I'm not sure exactly if this will help, but it can't hurt. 
Here's a (badly shot)  video of the 83mm hubs taking me up my street that I live on. It's on average a 25% gradient. I weigh 70kg. I used a space cell pro 3 with 20 amps to each motor. They get slightly warm after just this run, and the battery looses about 10% in the 200 meters up this hill. I'd estimate speed to be 15-20km/h with full throttle.

Thanks Luke, that is a descent grade of hill! It's nice to hear that the motors don't get too hot. I think these 83mm wheels are the tried and proven! I guess you can use a bigger battery like a 12s on those, not sure what Vesc you are using.There seems to be new 107mm ones with bigger stators and these come in a kit of 4 but I haven't seen any feed back yet. Does anyone have a set of these?

Hey, when I ride up from university I go up a 1km 10% hill as well as this hill, after both hills they get quite hot, to the point that it's uncomfortable to hold the truck hanger. For anyone bigger than me doing similar hills I advise to see how bigger motors are and probably go for those or maybe 4wd configuration if it's within your budget. Also I'd see how the reliability of the new batch is. One of mine had slipping utathane. Its been fixed with tape pretty successfully, but till then The vibration from slipping is likely what caused that motor to short circuit and the motor to become unusable, hopefully things like this will be addressed in the future. I'm not trying to be a downer, just want you to have an unbiased view of how they've been for me.

But what does that mean exactly? Think there are still a couple of open orders that haven't been fulfilled.
People who have paid you 250 or so $ for one set of motors back in April and haven't gotten anything yet. 
What happens to them? 

Are you going to ship their orders? When? Or you going to give them a refund? When?
Or do those people just have to write off their money?

Thanks Luke, interesting about the slipping and that hot hanger, it is probably well worth travelling around with a temp gun or something. I think I will start with a twin hub system and test it mainly on the flats, see how they perform and then step it up to 4 hubs if needed to avoid that excess heat.

Thank you for taking action and being honest about the situation. I would like to receive my order instead of a refund. I think these kind of community pre-orders should have a community-shared risk, therefore I don't want to back out and leave you with all the costs. Seeing that the urethane is more prone to wear and tear, could you ship me an extra pair with the order? Please PM/email me for the additional costs. 
You state that the motors clearly have some issues, can you elaborate a bit more on this subject? Are there any issues that we should be aware of beside the bad urethane? I hope that you can wrap up this project as best as possible and come out debt free. Please keep us posted and hopefully you can make some better urethane soon. You'll at least have me as a paying costumer for the new urethane (within reason ;)).

Edit: an extra request; could you make the shipment soon? I don't want to wait for weeks any longer. If I have to be honest; I still having a debate with myselve about opening a PayPal dispute due to the lack of communication from your side. That feels sketchy at best... I think that is also a major hurdle for most people. Keep that in mind. I understand that communication can be hard if you don't want to promise more than you can deliver while finding a solution. But no communication feels like a scam from the perspective of a eager DIY-er.

What is your ETA for the next batch of hub motors? We need to talk about design if you want to continue.

I would also like to point out that I recently shelled out $600 for Infolytics MotorSolve desktop program.

There is no stator (slots/magnet grade/diameter/length) under 12/14/N52/62mm/150mm that can generate enough torque (27Nm based on 100kg person on a 17°/30% grade) with a high enough rpm (max RPM should be at least 1800 on a 90mm wheel ≈ 35mph). The closest I got with the above stator was 19Nm and 1200Rpm (approaching 0 torque) at 12s full charge 40Amps.

To test how accurate this was, I inputted the data I have on the two +20 slot motors you've been selling into the program.  As I suspected, they burned out because the torque needed to push me (130lbs) up a 17° hill pulled the capped 35 amps.  While you claim your motors can take 40 Amps,  they really can't without heating up because the internal wire resistance is so high.

For the record, Hummies are NOT in any better shape electromechanically speaking.  They just use component rated to survive what I would consider motor abuse.  Scorpion motors uses a similar tactic with the motor designs.  That said, I would like to be able to touch my hangar without burning my fingers (perfect, built in heat sink).

** EDIT ** When building a motor, it should be over specced such that there is headroom for machining variation and for a variety of conditions.  Target should be 80-95% Duty, must have 25Nm of torque minimum so aim for 30Nm.  60kmh is scary dangerous, but we really want to target 25mph to take on belted drives. 

Targets in order of importance to design:
1. Torque - 30Nm (Turns, Stator Slots, Magnets).
2. RPM - 25mph ~ 1200rpm on 90mm wheel (Effective Gauge (I suggest starting with 16 gauge and working towards 1).

I've spent five days running simulations and I'm not satisfied with the truth that we might not be able to squeeze this performance from a small motor without cooking it. Keep trying and send me an email, we cna work this out.

Hello @jacobbloy

just visited your website and noticed that you're still selling your motors. However the possibility to pay via PayPal is gone. 

Does that mean you're trying to get money for the motors twice? 

- there are people that ordered early, paid via PayPal and did never get anything
- above you recommend that these people open a PayPal dispute to re-claim their money - and that your PayPal account is already negative
- now it looks that you're trying to sell the same motors that you never sent out a second time. Are you going to collect the money or are you going to use the money to pay your PayPal dept? 

A word of advice: you should rather communicate pro-actively, tell the people how you want to get out of the mess you are in and deal with customers that want a refund instead of having them deal with PayPal.

Do we get our motors one day or do we wait for nothing. Everything started with a lie: When I orderded the ETA was the 1st. week of July but this was not true, because the problem with the urethane came later, so you didn't have enough motors I think. Do you have motors now or do we just wait and wait and wait. Why don't you answer?????

So you should open a PayPal dispute, the process is explained on the PayPal site. Mention that you've never received any goods and that the seller is not answering. 
PayPal should then refund you the money - and chase Jacob.

Hey guys, I think it's quite clear that you all should just get a refund through paypal. It's not difficult, and quite painless.Usually dealing with paypal is a bitch, but in this scenario, they will take your side, no questions asked.

And it's not gonna effect Jacob in any way. Paypal is not and FDIC insured bank, so this isn;t going to ruin his credit score at all.  The worse that is gonna happen to him is they are gonna send his account to a debt collector, which is owned by paypal, who will send him harassing phone calls, but still not effect his credit score.So you are actually doing Jacob and yourself a favor if you just get a refund through paypal, cause then they take the loss. Cause f*ck paypal.

With all that being said, don't wait too long to get a refund, you only  have a certain a mount of time after your purchase to file a claim. 90 days I think.

The same goes with people who used credit cards to make their purchase. Just call your bank, and they will take care of it. Just tell them you have no idea what this charge is and you think you are a victim of fraud. They will get your money back. Again, don't wait too long. I think you have 90 days to make a chargeback as well. However, unlike paypal, this might affect Jacob's credit score. But really, that's not your responsibility.

And to the rest of you who want to wait it out and support Jacob. Gob bless you, you are a saint for understanding his situation and trying to make the best of it. He is just a small start-up after all. Hopefully this will all get sorted out eventually.

@jacobbloy if we have to wait for you to clear your debt and you say that you're a student with 2 kids, then your debt with PayPal should be cleared around the year 2020 if not later. At least, that would be my case if I still were a student. How long do you want us to wait? 3 months is long enough for me. Winter is coming... 

In a previous post I've asked you if you could send an extra pair of urethane's with my order and that I'm willing to pay for those. That way you can have some revenue for shipping my order. I'm sure there are more people that could live with such a solution. 

You'll have to do some form of "damage control" to keep everyone from canceling there order and asking for a refund.

If you can't find a solution to fulfill my order then I'm also forced to cancel my order and your debt would be bigger. I wouldn't like that, but I still want to make a esk8-board in 2016.

The reality is that every customer has a "use case" for your products, but those also have an expiration date. If that time has come and there is no pruduct, than you get a refund request.

If you can't fulfill any order before you clear up your debt, expect that you don't have any orders left to fulfill.

I'm cancelling my order next week if you're not responding, sorry. Please don't read this as a threat or anything. After 3 months waiting, my "use case" is gone.

I have  offered @jacobbloy a quite good deal but he did not respond too...

My idea was that he sent an additional set urethane (20 bucks) for free with my order and sent the package with "pre payment". Before the shipping company give me my package i would have to pay the shipping cost (you can declare any price but it is only the shipping cost that needs to be paid because everything else is already paid...). That way he does not spend money on the shipping costs and gain 15 bucks.... I would have to pay the shipping twice (minus an extra set of urethane) but i could live with it. that way he would have fulfilled an order but it seems as he does not want.... unfortuneatly...

It's a shame now...
Bad things can happen but what should **not** happen is that if somebody gets many advises and refuses them all...

- "Slipping wheels" issue appeared --> wont ship any more motors (great step :thumbsup:)
- People are offering help for this issue --> no reaction from jacob that anybody should/could help
- No more response --> the community asked for updated (nothing more...)
- No more response just hardly an update that he have no money because of the refunds
- People are offering him a [valid solution](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/emf-hub-motor-final-sale/4762/487?u=deathcookies) (i among others)
- No response to these offers

Everything we really want (besides you to success and that we get our quality motors) is **COMMUNICATION**

but he always refused our advises and wanted to get out of this mess alone. Why is he asking the community to preorder (back this project) but dont want the help of the community anymore?

I waited all the time patiently and did not complain very much about these issues... but now when i saw that he is writing in [another topic](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-boosted-board-2nd-generation/3507/79?u=deathcookies) but sees no need to respond to the real problems i get really fucked up. :middle_finger:

Hi guys, I do receive some emails but not that meany most are through the forum.

If you can for an extra set of wheels then this will oleo add to the overal size and weight of the shipment and in turn increase the shipping cost. 

I'm trying to work this out and also I don't have that much more rock of the spare wheels so I can not offer this to every one as I made what what ordered plus a little more.

The offer is I will organise if you can pay $100 let's say not to me but to some one every one trusts or the manufacture (I know I have lost my trust with the community) then they will ship you your order that day with a spare pare of urethane. But I still this is unfair to every one who pre ordered.

They can also epoxy or use the proven double sided tape method of fixing the urethane.

I hope for those who really want there motor regardless this will help!

Hi Guys, I have a set of @jacobbloy hubs which are sitting in the box awaiting my new build. I haven't bench tested them yet, but was wondering if I could clarify that the only issue people are having with the hubs is with the slipping/crappy urethane (which looks to be able to be solved with the use of double sided tape)? Are there any other fundamental mechanical/operating issues with the hubs that people have found through use? (other than perhaps the grubs screws coming off etc). 

I'm not sure about others, but I was able to acquire my hubs for a relatively cheap price compared to other options in the market, so if it is a matter of paying an extra $100 for new, good quality thane, I think that would be a pretty reasonable solution to get a decent pair of hubs (assuming of course there are no other fundamental mechanical issues.shortcomings with the hubs).

Hard to say if it's just a one off issue but @Luke's pair of hubs (as well as having issues with slipping urethane) have also had problems with the phase wires being much too thin and breaking. I had a look at them myself and some of the wires had broken inside the motors right next to the stator which makes them more difficult to repair. Something to keep in mind.

I feel that the slipping urethane/bumpy ride could have made the whole phase wire situation worse. Id say you'd have better luck using double sided tape before anything to avoid vibrating everything to bits

Hey @jacobbloy , 
I want to design 3D printed spacers that fill the gap between the screws and therefor should help with the urethane slipping. In your drawing there is a dimension missing to actually get this done. the srew holes are not in the center of the 4.5mm circle - so what is the actual distance from center to center and what is the distance from center to 4.5mm circle center?

Thanks and I will post it here once I got it done and epoxied it to the motor.

I don't know. I'm not sure if he can fix them or what, but if you buy a motor from hobbyking and then burn it out you don't get a refund from them. 
its only through a loophole in paypal that favors the buyer that you are able to effectively steal money out of jacobs pocket.
there are people who haven't even received their motors because jacob cannot afford to ship them because there is more money leaving his account then there is going in...
regardless of the fact that you burnt out your motors in unfortunate circumstances, I don't think you should be able to just take your money back.. but hey if Jacob had opened his mouth and talked to paypal maybe you wouldn't have won the dispute.. so hes got himself to blame there too.

im just curious how many other people, like you also got motors and their money back.

Luke didn't burn out his motors, from what I've seen, all the issues he's had have been a result of poor manufacturing/design (Slipping urethane, phase wires breaking off within the hub because they're much too thin). 

Whether or not this is thought of as a loophole in the paypal system, based on Australian consumer law, Luke is well within his rights to request a refund on a product that was faulty from the start. Whether or not Jacob wants the faulty motors back is up to him.

I wanted to get a refund for these motors so badly but I remembered it was more of a beta run I just hoped they lasted more than the one day that i used them. Almost $300 down the drain. The worst part is that Jacob doesn't even bother to respond to the forum. The motors are a really bad design and not just the slipping urethane. Well I understand now why they came in a pretty box just to to sit in the closet stored away.

I opened the hubs and found broken parts from three magnets. I put some CA on it and hope it will not brake further.

I only had the urethane slipping, but I still wouldn't trust them anymore like the aluminum around the grub screw was starting deform. The wires coming out a tiny hole I wouldn't trust. Copper wire vs bendable silicone i wouldn't trust. The parts really need to be steel for them to last imo aluminum you're just waiting for the day they fail. I didn't have to much knowledge when I purchased them but now i look for stuff that is overbuilt rather than adequate so I wouldn't purchase any hubs available now.

Just went on EMF web page. Fortunately final purchase cant be made as it wont allow you to input payment method. Says invalid. So at least any future sales  is halted till they sort out the design. I just hope he can get out of this problem without to much damage to himself and others. @lowGuido you are one of the lucky ones. Usually the first batch is the ones with issues. The second batch could also be hampered by design or manufacturering descisions that obviously didn't actually improve the product. Its a shame. They looked sweet. Nice box.

When I bought these motors I knew that a single guy (who is just a student) designed some motors in his spare time and had them made.
The price he offered was exceptional and basically you got a dual hub system for less than a single Carvon hub - there could obviously be no profit margin.
At the time nobody knew what these hubs are about, so I knew from the start that it is going to be unknown territory and basically a beta test. That is why even if there would be something wrong with my motors (I never rode them because I first have to make me a custom battery pack) I could never just ask for a refund. We are a DIY forum and instead of fixing this, people only complain and ask for refunds. I would have expected someone already rewinding the motor or coming up with another solution - there are so many creative people on here. It is a shame and I just hope Jacob can get out of it without implications in his personal life.
The only thing he did wrong was the lack of communication.

@stealth71, I didn't flag and your statement has some truth in it. 

However, I think that @lowGuido stepped up and is trying to sort out the big mess Jacob made with his motors. Respect for that and a big thank you. So here we should focus on the motors. 

I ordered my set, thane and an additional motor in April. Not because I desperately needed motors but because I wanted Jacob to succeed and to support him. And an additional set of motors is always nice. 

My stuff never arrived. I pinged and emailed Jacob but nothing came back. So eventually I decided to open a PayPal dispute. Not even because of the bad reviews, but simply because I figured that the chances that I would get anything became very small.

Here is my 2nd modification on the hubs. I made 8 inserts which I will glue on the rotor. I will glue the urethane on the rotor as well. I made tests with epoxy and it should work. I will have to roughen the rotor with sandpaper before I glue all together.

@yaca That looks really good. If the glue alone doesn't hold, you could always make a hole in either end of your inserts and add a little pin through the screw holes (bumps) into the inserts and glue that into place. My hubs are still working fine, aside from the slipping urethane which only becomes a problem after I've ridden them a while and they've warmed up. I'm gonna first try the double sided scotch tape trick applied with mineral spirits, but I'd like a more elegant and permanent solution like your inserts for the long term.

Yes exactly! Why did they make it shinny so it slips? You can cut ridges too with a dremel to help grip. Is that insert aluminum?

Want some good results ...clean the surface and roughen it on both the urethane and metal. Run a thin bead of loctite professional super glue. Assemble and it will never slip again. When you hav to replace the urethane you can cut the superglue lip around the perimeter.

Coool, i was going to run a threaded 3mm rod through a hollow 5mm carbon fiber pipe across the whole thing.... the offset of the holes isnt ideal. 

Man if the design would have made those ridges squares instead of speed bumps it would have never slipped.

There's a lot of information being thrown around, so I'm a little confused on whether or not there are genuinely more problems than just the urethane slipping or if some of the other potential issues were one off. Jacob mentioned the extra $100 for shipping solution, but his lack of communication has me worried if that would actually work or not. 

Is it worth it to wait a little while longer and see how this pans out or is it worth it to drop the $100 and get whatever he currently has on hand or should I just find new motors?

@Atticus as far I am aware the only issue is the slipping thane.  There are already a few possible fixes for this.  Double sided tape or inserts and such.

The other problem is that the guy running the show has run out of money so some motors havent even been sent out yet. This compounds the problem because then people lodge paypal refunds to get their money back. And then there is less or even negative money to get anything sent out. 

I'm throwing myself under the bus here but im willing to do just about anything to make sure everyone gets what they deserve.

But trying to get all the information from all party's is hard enough without  every other person who isnt even involved throwing their opinions in.

Jacob has been a great help to the community, hosting the BLDC downloads and putting up videos etc. I couldn't have originally set up my vesc without his videos. I think he's just got in over his head trying to do a lot of things, so I'm willing to give him quite a bit of slack, but...

Thanks @Maxid, I tried to gently lever off the black caps, but they seemed pretty well stuck on (possibly some Loctite?). I didn't want to damage them, so that's why I though I had better ask.

Do you need to remove the urethane first to get the black caps off?

Wow, they are so finely machined it is a real effort to slide the caps off. There's some real precision there in how the parts fit together. 

Inspected the magnets and wirings and all seems in order. Going to add some extra heat shrink to the phase wires and will apply the double sided tape to the hub barrel to try and stop the slipping issue. If that doesn't work, I'll look at putting in the additional ridges between the 'nubs'.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/4/f4a73172e84130153b4ae64f47846e7bfe730377.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/3/43cf4d7d5d018db8ef2ccfc8cba133871aedbf59.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Guys i've been trying a new pair of these jacob motors with the dual setup and they are good. 

If you use them as is out of the box I can't say they will work good since even with the dual setup i experience the urethane slip. I quick fix is removing one of the caps and using a high temp structural grade epoxy on the surface between the motor and the urethane. Using retaining fluid on the aluminum where it meets the motor and bearing also helps keep it tight together. 

The motor wire outputs will crack off the place where they are soldered into the banana plug. Better heat shrink and a dab of epoxy fixes it nicely. 

Hopefully we see some upgrades in this design in the future and larger diameter urethane.

i wonder why they did that? to save money or to prevent desoldering of the wire where it transitions from the stands to actual high amperage wires. 

The insulation is pretty lame as well. Looks like they slipped a long loose peiece of heatshrink all the way down and into the motor.

It is not like it makes a difference. Look at the length of the strands inside the motor - the little piece that comes out of it is so small that any loss due to higher resistance is negligible. SK3 motors have the same principle - but use thicker wire for the windings so the cables sticking out are also thicker.

Also your heat shrink theory: that is exactly what they did and also the reason why you can still pinch them.

Still, my only issue is the slipping and squeaking urethane. Other than that, they have worked fine for me and have good torque, and decent top speed on 12s ~25mph. I tried the double sided scotch tape and the urethane doesn't seem to slip as much, but they squeak like crazy as the urethane shifts on the tape. I like @yaca's inserts and will probably try those next, but hold them down by wrapping a layer of gorilla tape across them and around the Hub. I'd still like to be able to remove the urethane without destroying it since I got the second replacement set in another color.

What other fixes have been working for you guys?

Today i made inserts for the hub just like the brass one but on my 3d printer and glued them in between the nubs. On the wheel that hasnt slipped it kept it in place and the wheel that has widened due to slipping before now with the inserts it doesnt slip but does vibrate a bit when temps get higher. I'll post pics. 

I contemplated adding 4 peices of grip tape around the 4 inserts vs epoxy. 

Went with the epoxy and so far so good.

Im getting soon the wheels in a urethane that has a higher heat resistance along with another pair of motors. I am going to upgrade the phase wires and all the hardware and test them. If they pass my torture test of my 50v 12s 16000mah battery riding all day ill list them for sale for anyone interested.

Well I read everything that happened and its a wild ride with these motors. Jacob did a cool job but a lot of people were left with a desire to get these things working properly. I can order more so far ive run a pair for over 50 miles in south florida weather sometimes even 30-40min non stop. 

The manufacture has no intention of modifying the things that need improvment such as the phase wires the knubs but they seem copperative in making the urethane to resist 40 C degrees more. Thats a step in the right direction. 

If the new rubber is good i can order a couple sets and if the results are good i can ship them out to you in the US priority mail for those interested. I dont intend to make any profit on the upgraded rubber. 

Ive developed products in the past and i do extensive testing to prevent these issues. I also have a lot of research in material testing and adhesives as a college instructor. 

The motors if I modify them phase wires, knubs and rubber upgrade will be tested on an individual basis for several hours before shipping. 

Let me know your thoughts.

If you dont have a 3d printer i can send you a set of 8 knubs 3d printed that have worked for me for $9.99 with shipping tracking included<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/a/7a75ea65c6f215369d2ff022446ab5a020e01554.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/7/97adc364d6e2231a6901feaf48c8c590427f251d.jpg" width="375" height="500">

One thing that came to mind that can be causing the slipping issue is that there are two types of urethane. 

Thermoplastic - which can be melted and repoured much like the hdpe plastics in milk jugs (its cheaper to manufacture and less durable)

Thermosetting- which is chemically fused into its fina lform much like epoxies. Heat will usually not cause them to deform and they are more durable and expensive to manufacture. 

I can bet money these wheels that slip are thermoplastics. Once i confirm it I'll report back.

A urethane’s ability to resist heat plays an important role in determining its application.
Thermoset urethane performs well in temperatures of up to 250° without issue.Thermoplastic urethane will soften when tested in high temperatures.

I don't want to speak out of turn, but having followed this thread from the start (and owning a pair of @jacobbloy's hubs which I am deciding whether to use for my new build), I don't think there is much of an issue with someone else taking up the batten and running with these hubs. 

@jacobbloy has put a serious amount of work into the hubs, and should be given full credit for this. But by his own admission he has come unstuck, he's not participating in the forum/this thread anymore (unlike the active way @Hummie responded to initial issues with his hubs), and consequently people are feeling / have been, let down. 

These hubs were always short run, pre-production betas - if someone else wants to drive the design forward and improve what is fundamentally a good product for the benefit of the community, then why not? In the DIY tradition, I'd like to see what we can do to improve the quality/reliability of the hubs for those of us that already have them. If all it involves is improving the phase wires, adding nubs, and new urethane, maybe better grub screws, surely that will help out a lot of crew that are sitting there with dud hubs at the moment. 

It may even help out @jacobbloy if cheap solutions can be found that create a marketable product for any stock he has left that he can then sell through to people. 

I still think hubs are the future compared to belts and outrunners. I hope we can salvage something out of the @jacobbloy hubs.

Actually, just thinking about it, it would be great if @jacobbloy would come back onto this thread and provide a bit of advice and guidance for us all. I am sure there must be things he learned in developing the hubs and working with Chinese manufacturers that could assist us in solving some of the design issues.

I know people have asked in the past couple of months for @jacobbloy to be more open and to assist without getting any response from him. I think it would go a long way to clearing the air if he did... :confused:

I'm sure Jacob is frustrated with people's complaints and the logistics of production and the difficult quality control process of dealing with overseas manufactures. 

The biggest difference I had between the clones and these was heat issues and crappy bunched up windings on the first one. 

This second set is much improved. The 3d printed knubs don't come off or melt at all as long as the metal is scraped and cleaned. Also it has not allow the current rubber to slip at all but once it warms you feel a slight high frequency vibration at speeds over 20mph due to the little play that's induced as the urethane heats up. 

The permanent solution to a silky smooth ride is fusing the urethane to the metal and that's in the works. It will basically keep the urethane bound to the metal permanently. 

Given the heat, mechanical resistance and cure time neseesary of the adhesive it will take me another week before I nail it down. So far ive gone through 5 different epoxies / adhesives and I have a top US manufacture helping out.

You show us how you managed to thin out that much urethane and we all praise you on the forum. 

Then I will personally refit them for free with new urethane if you bought the entire setup upgraded by me.

Here are the 3d print knubs secured with a high strength cyanoacrylate...lol known as superglue. 

This shows how they stayed in place after 12 miles of riding. 

There are two US adhesive epoxy manufactures getting me samples that have confirmed will yeild excellent results. 

Attached is a pic of the surface roughning to prepare it for the adhesive bind.

I dont think its about Jacob being involved with my project as much as it is me being involved with jacobs project. 

From an engineering point of view looking from the center outward this project and design is a success. Bearings, caps, winding , power , and overall quality of design. The one fundamental flaw is the rubber and the mechanism of keeping it in place. Jacob is an electrical engineer and so is my father and its an excellent electrical engineering project as far as i can tell. Where things went wrong is in the mechanical engineering part of the friction component. 

It reminds me of my high school days and my automotive tech classes, the instructor used to mention how tires where more important than brakes when it came to stopping a car. The actual friction component that makes the ultimate contact with the road surface is the most important component.

By the way 3 different urethane inserts from 3 different manufactures should be arriving shortly for those that feel troubled by the thought of permanently binding a wheel to the motor.

Yes I agree, Jacob's hubs are a good design and they work great with a few modifications. Since I glued the urethane and inserts on the motor I didn't have any problems and like to ride them.

Ok crazy thought since I've been reading this thread...

Is there away just to tac weld some square rods across the motor, like two, on opposite sides and make a wheel mold from that...?

Yeah it would mean everyone would need to do the same procedure to thier hubs but I think it would make them useable.

Just an idea...maybe you guys should have a thread o about how to fix these hubs .... seems at this point nothing is a crazy idea and would help in the future development of @jacobbloy project... If you are supporting him now, that means you see a future for his hubs...how about we try to spin this negative into something that will become positive result for everyone in the future?

You can tag weld sure with a mig welder but that's kind if alot of work and the heat generated can damage the magnets...cracks unglue etc. 

The idea is not to make a new mold but instead allow for a fix that would enable the use of what already is in production. 

I'm binding one wheel to the motor and the other motor ive coated the entire surface with a rubberized compound and allowing it to bind to the metal before installing the wheel. Hopefully one of those two yields positive results with the current wheels.

There are more optimal winding solutions if you feel confident removing c-clips and calculating improved torque without increased heat.

Also, buy a set of 4x 90mm wheels off ebay and take a lathe or drill press to them. No slippage ever. That said, I had to use a vice to press them onto his motors.  Plus you can put the other 2x wheels on whatever other hub motor you end up building!

In order to keep the wheels still while coring them, I laid an old car brake disk over the Thane and then pressed the hole bit into the wheel.  Lathes can do it, but you need to be more gentle. I suggest the drill press because it makes a super tight fitting wheel cover.

OH ALSO CUT THE GROVES FIRST. THEN CORE THE WHEEL.  I have a marginally bumpy ride because I didn't add the groves to the first wheel.

Always good to shoot a picture when you make something. I think I will do this with a lathe, just can't find wheels of 90mm and a width of about 56mm. They all just have 52mm. 

In the moment my hubs with glued urethane hold perfectly on the motor just I think with softer 90mm wheels the ride would be much more comfortable.

Probably accurate.

The 52mm width is actually perfect because the 56mm includes the thickness of the end caps used to hold the thane in place.

This'll help anyone who has a need for better wheels since support might be cutting off soon.

Great ideas @kmeyerson & @ralphy! 

Of course, now that I want to buy a black set of 90mm clones to hack, they're out of stock. It's on my to do list though. 

And I can attest to the freeze fitting working in certain situations. When I was doing my crazy drift board experiment, I tried to fit 83mm wheels inside of a 3-inch PVC couplers to make drift wheels. without having a huge press there was no way I could get them in until I stuck the wheels in the freezer for a couple hours. Then they slid easily into the PVC and when they warmed up, they were rock solid. I had to freeze them again to get them apart. Definitely a good trick to try if you are really really close to fitting.

Thats my design to solve the slipping urethane issue. You can use the current urethane with epoxy sandwiched in between this insert. Its .4mm thick and so far ive done 20 miles and no slipping. Ive rode for over 2 hrs non stop no issues. I AM SO HAPPPPPPY!!!

I'll keep testing it this week, but it looks like a promising fix and maintains the ability for you to remove the wheel from the motor.

Great work @ralphy, well done!  Looks like a simple, but effective solution. 

So to clarify, the solution is to:

1. rough up the outer steel of the hub with a dremel, sander etc to get the shine off.
2. 3D print 'nubs' to be sit between the four sets of two existing nubs on the edges of the hub barrel.
3. Epoxy the 'infill' hubs into place.
4. 3D print the insert sleeve you have provided above.
5. Epoxy the insert sleeve to the urethane wheel.
5. Slide the wheel and insert sleeve over the hub.
6. Ride with lots of torque and a smile on your face! :sunglasses:

Any advice on the type of epoxy you have been using?

Yes thats pretty accurate, the nubs are free for download but the sleeve and material info I will be selling at something affordable just because it took a lot of trail and error to nail a material and precision dimension that works. Around 19.99 for two full wheel inserts and 8 nubs.
Ralphyc81@gmail.com is my paypal. 

The nubs can be anchored down with loctite super glue professional. 

Use any epoxy that can glue plastic to rubber for the sleeve. Coat the urethane with a light coat of epoxy. Fold the sleeve onto inself so it can go into the inner part of the urethane wheel and once inside completly unfold it so it binds to epoxy.

Immediatly silde it into the motor completly. It will take some physical stregth and the use of the motor cap backwards in order to ensure the wheel and plastic insert slide in evenly and completly. Once its all in place the motor cap with all screws and use 3 or 4 3"-4" metal adjustable straps to tighten the heck out of the outside of the urethane. This ensures an even round fit. Some epoxy might come out of the sides indicating any excess. Leave it alone until it cures then cut it off with a knife. 

Once the epoxy fully cures it cantake anywhere from 1hr to 24 hrs RIDE IT LIKE YOU STOLE IT.

No, the insert doesnt fit right when the wheel is brand new especially with these that are cast to be tighter on the motor.....it needs to be broken in ans stretched out. The manufacture just provided 3 different compounds of urethane to test. One is so stiff i cant compress it with my hand this one is pretty soft.

@ralphy that would be awesome.let me know when you get some and then I'll order your nubs and sleeves so they can all ship together. Thank you so much.

@yaca I got these I think in July, I'm one of the first ones to order. But I was away. then when I got back I read all the negative stuff with the hubs and I have like 3 emtb builds going on so I didn't even bother with these hubs.

You can make one dude. Get a coupler to the right pitch thread and a hex bolt of the same pitch thread and a washer. 

If the coupler doent go into the hub motor grind the sides if its to loose jam it into a copper pipe and get it to fit snug. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/0/508a18ce7fe605c37ca39ecad7d1a8eff8310679.jpg" width="225" height="225">

One of the wheels out of the 3 samples didnt slip. The hardest one worked good no mods needed on the motor at all.  I got it up to 200F no issues, its just a little noisy but smooth ride.

So pricing some people have asked questions, price is fixed as follows 

Base setup is $335 for dual motors with upgraded Stainless steel hardware and silicone phase wire leads shipped within the USA

Extreme setup is $150 more includes everything in the base setup plus the added high temp rigid sleeve insert bonded to the urethane wheel and nubs installed with lifetime support for replacement limited to 3 exchanges

International shipping starts at $35.99

As I said 15% of all sales will be donated to Jacob if he wishes to accept it

3d print knubs and sleeves are available for 19.99 shipped in the USA and it will solve your slipping issues with the current stretched out urethane you have. 

So there you have it 3 simple solutions to the issues ranging from 20 bucks to almost $500 to make you a badass e boarder with the most powerful motors manufactured to date.

The red urethane was just something that was done for id purposes during testing. The urethane compound first batch will be produced in blue although i said black might be more popular. 

An easy way to identify its the better rubber is to squeeze the wheel in your hand. The good one will hardly compress when its off the motor.   

The upgrade urethane will be extremely affordable. 

I cant do the original price because the process of purchasing receiving repacking and reshipping does take time and money. As stated before for pricing its fixed there are two options and worldwide shipping is available. Just scroll back and read my posts.

Jacob might be able to negotiate drop shipments direct from the supplier but thats between you and him.

This is red soft rubber which failed https://youtu.be/vojzvNTAGZM

Does anybody do a hub motor with a 'tire' or some sort of wheel with a really soft/rubbery compound? I don't necessarily need a pneumatic tire, but I want something that can get traction on grass, dirt, and maybe slick surfaces. Also, something like a tire compound, even if there's no air involved, would be much quieter when riding over sidewalks.

Guys, the heat losses are crazy.   I've been trying different winds with success.  You need a thicker gauge than what Jacob had them wound as.  Otherwise, limit your current.

The factory added epoxy to keep the strands in place so they got hotter faster.  The enamel will burn at 200°C and they don't cool very well.

Rewinding is also super difficult because of the epoxy. Just heads up for those looking into it.

What's the best gauge and strand count that you would suggest for the stators, I'm sure I can help ppl get some wound up. Probably only $40 per stator and the stators should easy to replace as I got the factory to use c-clips and a key way. There might be some epoxy.but if most ppl are happy with 30a current then the original winding should be fine.
```

## \#753 Posted by: KMeyerson Posted at: 2016-11-14T01:56:27.492Z Reads: 226

Yeah, 40-60Amps is stretching 21 Awg equiv.

Efficiency drops above and below 14-17 gauge. It'll keep the stator pretty cool at 10s 30-40Amps 60min max torque @ max speed gives me a heat increase of about 125°C from room temp (see second graph, third range). This assumes the motor is fully sealed. Jacob's design does have some air cooling potential.

I'm not giving away months of simulation and multivariable assessments for free, but I'd suggest starting your work from those gauges as a continuation of your work.  Side by Side vs Overlapping, Delta vs Star, and Lap vs Concentric winding will give be good conditions to start from (try to get as sinusoidal of a waveform as you can).  Turns and what gauges to combine to get the right total gauge will take you time (hint phase resistance matters a lot more than you might realize). It's not linear so don't treat it as such because you'll go crazy. 
ALSO - don't discount eddy losses. You don't need 100% copper fill. Trust me.

With two of my motors, you could push a 220 lbs person up a 25% grade at full speed (2250 rpm = 25mph).  Each motor has a near perfect sinusoidal BEMF. I am working on finalizing the design before I do a prototype run. I keep finding that I'm able to squeeze a few more Nm of torque every couple weeks.

NOTES:

* Simulations are using Current Hysteresis PWM
* I'm half way through programming a dsPIC based ESC
* None of this is for sale, public beta testing, or sharing because no company I have worked with will respect any NDA and I don't trust people enough anymore after I almost got backstabbed by a USA prototyping firm.

Jacob's design is good as a pure hub motor. It just needs some refining that requires both time and motor design background. I would suggest that if you guys are interested in rewinding stators, you should just make a group order for a handful. Its gonna cost you about $50-70/unit in a set of 10 (basically $600-800 when you factor in shipping) - DON'T HAVE THE FACTORY WIND THEM. You should limit yourself to no more than 5mm end winding length, otherwise debris become an issue.

## Proof that it can be done at 35 Amps for almost double current design torque:

Correction:
I accidentally stated that these were from SVM simulations. While the statement, "SVM is wonderful and can be very quiet if matched up with a well built motor" is true, these were performed with PWM Hysteresis (Sorry, the two projects literally share the same name except for the SVM/HYST tag).

thanks, wye is star and who knows more about the original winding. In the moment I'm happy with the original winding but if problems occur and have to rewind the stators it would be good to know the original and start from there.

0.19mm (36 gage) wire, I personally hated this wire but the factory wouldn't use a different copper and it was hard to get a factory to do what I wanted to do in the first place. The strand count should be between 18 and 23. Depending.
The turn count in Wye to get about 65-75kv is about 8 turns. This can change depending on magnet fill EMF leakage ect. It gives a huge resistance in wye if my calculations are correct 480mohm A delta winding can more then half the resistance.
But I personally found that Wye was great for these motors.

Using a 0.8mm (21 gage) wire in Wye you could maybe get 2 strands at 8 turns your resistance will be about a third of the 0.19mm copper at about 180mohm. If you use a delta winding with 16 turn with again 0.8mm but now only 1 strand the resistance is about the same but the current allowance will not change much because the copper cross section has halfed.

I probably haven't done as much simulation based testing as @KMeyerson bit at 16 gage I can't see my self getting more then 3 turns of single strand in that stator getting a 180kv in Wye. 

You could get 7-8 turns of 19 gage single strand in the stator but I would be worried about my phase wire snapping constantly.

True stuff. I said gauge equivalent though, so I'm using the thickest-thin wire/more strands for the least resistance.

I have a delta and a wye model and they're wound very differently.  I found that there is a real struggle to balance the speed and torque between them just by adjusting the winding simulations. It's pretty fun actually when you get into it.

I've been largely ignoring the calculated kV since it doesn't tell me enough. I keep an eye on torque and temp more than anything else.

## Notes
I cannot accurately simulate the temperatures with a SVM driven motor. Based on our findings however, I would say that they're problematically high on long trips. I don't know what the VESCs default switching frequency is so I'm including a 6 and 20 Khz Simulation. It looks pretty accurate though.

With such a thin wall and tight design might find that people have different tolerances on their printers. Jacobs might be slightly out or maybe yours slightly out.

The tolerances do not influence the shape of the dents. look at them - they are way rounder than what is on the motor.

Guys I didn't expect someone to just copy my idea. But if your going to copy it at least make it work right. It took me alot of work and many hours of testing and adhesive research to get to a design that fits right and performs well. That is why I offered the lowest cost solution to fix it at $20 you also need to have nubs in there that fill the gap. 

Happy Thanksgiving to all!

Didn't Jacob upload the files yesterday? Ralphy tried to do something to help the ones with problems and no support from Jacob, before he came back to help. People don't work for free,  keep that in mind. Next time do it by yourself, if you have time and knowledge to develop a solution. If Jacob hadn't sent flawed units Ralphy wouldn't have made any solution, so he's not "copying products and making money out of other people's work", just fixing problems and getting back something, since he put his own time on it. When he came out with a solution everybody was "wow finally something to get this project back in the road", now he's the incarnation of Devil making profit. Oh, and it looks like Jacob's solution isn't even working well, so...

also so every one knows i totally support and have supported ralphy's work in helping solve this issue.

The problem is the solution i was trying to work o to fix this issue was a hard fix that was going to be making new motor cans for every one or tighter urethan and i has samples made and shipped to some members who said they would test them but i have never heard back from them.

during this time i was communicating and had full intention to follow through but i lost the support of my buyers and financially made it impossible for me to produce a fix. at that point it forced me to feel like i had to be silent as my presence was leaving a bad taste in every ones mouth. this is the reason why i stoped my youtube channel, the channel that was all about helping others. i have not advertised the release of my VESC app. to this day i have refunded 95% of all orders relating to those that didn't receive there motors and even some who did receive there motor.

I hope that we can all move on from this!

Thanks for clearing that up @jacobbloy. Despite the issues, I'm still glad I was one of the few who purchased and received your motors and could support your efforts in the ESk8 community in some way. My one piece of advice is that if you ever decide to do another project like this, just keep the lines of communication open if something goes wrong and don't be afraid to enlist the help of the community to find a solution. I think most of us would be happy to help if we could. Which brings me to my next point.

I feel like @ralphy has been very supportive of Jacob, transparent and by far the most actively helpful member when it comes to finding solutions for these hub motors. He also stated that a percentage (15%, I think?) of his sales will go back to Jacob, so I don't see any reason why there should be any negative feelings towards him. 

Also, for the first time, because of @ralphy's solutions, I am finally able to ride these hubs for more than a mile without any urethane squeaking, slipping or other related issues. So, thank you!! :grinning: :thumbsup: :clap:

Now, I'd like to share my initial results and impressions of @ralphy's nubs and sleeves. First off, I don't have access to a 3d printer, so I'm very happy that he is making these parts available to purchase, especially for the very reasonable prices he is asking. The nubs he sent me go in the gaps between the "teeth" on the hub, and are supposed to be applied with super glue, after sanding and prepping the areas. The hubs have a layer of zinc or something that flakes off, even with just tape stuck to them, so this needs to be removed before gluing the nubs on. However, I was impatient to try these and didn't have the right glue on hand yet, so I used some tape to tape the nubs on to one hub, and it seems to be holding and effective so far. 

The other hub motor has one of the sleeves installed along with the nubs, but I was lazy and didn't glue or even tape the nubs on, so they are kind of free floating and are there mostly to fill in that space between the teeth so the sleeve can't collapse in the middle. The sleeve is a very tight fit, and perfectly sized and shaped for the hub. Well done @ralphy! I then slid my loosest, squeakiest tire (I have four of them) over the sleeve, VERY tight fit, and reassembled them. 

I've only ridden my @ralphy modded Jacob hubs for about 10-15 miles so far, due to time constraints, but I've been carving hard on them the whole time to see how things hold up. I'm happy to report that the urethane issues seem to be resolved now, and the hubs ride beautifully. Also, note that the setups I am trying are kind of the most hack job, worst case scenario for installing the nubs and sleeves, using tape or no adhesive at all, and seem to be effective as is. I will eventually glue everything down which can only improve things, but for now, I'm gonna see how long this setup lasts, you know, for science. :microscope: Down the line, I'll probably pick up a pair of the tires with the sleeves already glued on from @ralphy, which is probably how they should have come in the first place. 

The last mod to these hubs is my own experiment. I found that after a short time riding, the motors were sounding "crunchy", so I pulled them apart and found a lot of road debris and small rocks inside of the motors. So, I cleaned them out and made some protective screen covers using what I had on hand. Results are good thus far, and the insides of the hubs are now protected from small rocks, and still run as cool as before. 

I am VERY pleased with how things are going now. I'd highly recommend trying these mods if you're having issues. Any questions, just ask!

instead of these 3D printed sleeves - can't we just use shrink tubing? :thinking:
Put the nubs there and not even glue them - the shrink tubing should hold them in place and is thinner than the printed walls plus it is always a perfect fit. Anybody tried this - seems so easy and obvious to me right now.

make sure you get the nylon centre tubing. the wheels are actually a little bit bigger then they need to be so adding so thickness will help and if you get a matt shrink tube it might have good friction with the wheel. my only concern is the the shrink tube will not keep its shape through the centre of the grooves so you will still need to put some thing in there. the design that i sent the factory actually never had the gap and i don't now why they didn't but it you could drill out the thread in the groove and extend it to do the whole way through, then when you 3d print the spacers you can add a hole in them and actually stew them in place so there is no need for glue.

please can you draw this, I don't understand it.

Here is the drawing you posted: The threads are too deep in diameter to extend them, the material of the stator would be too thin then or did I get it wrong. Btw. the bumps havn't R = 4.5 it's about 2.5mm.

```
The concept of heat shrink could work but ultimately it's a soft rubber that will bend flex and deform around the motor.Bonding heatsink to the urethane is also challenging since both materials are highly flexible. The current urethane has a low glass transition temp and not much mechanical resistance that's why it expands and slippage occurs. Bonding it to a sleeve that has higher mechanical strength and temp resistance is the best solution so far.

As far as the larger wheel I am developing a thicker sleeve that will create a perfect smooth perimeter and allow for a larger diameter high temp rubber insert to be bonded to it.

I will probably not be using rubber shrink tubing but a plastic one that is not deformable once cooled.

Ok and how do you plan to keep the motor cool? Once you run the motor it heats up and therefore most plastics rubber deform.

The temperature needed to deform shrink tubing probably differs quite a lot and is usually quite high. You need at least 100°C to cause deformation. This can go up to 175°C and even more. I doubt the motors will reach this kind of temperature. Also all the shrink tubing is supposed to do is hold the nubs in place - as they are the ones actually eliminating the air pocket thus reducing deformation potential and slipping by increased mechanical resistance.

The deformation isnt just due to the missing nubs, thats 50% of the fix. The urethane actually expands due to lack of mechanical and thermal resistance. I tested the heck out of them in south florida weather with raod temps at 98F.

One test when i tried the new red replacement urethane got the motor to 144F with no slippage and no nubs or sleeves.

Its bad urethane

For all in non-retard units ;)
98degrees = 37°C
144° = 62°C

You see that the temperature is well below the shrink tubing's deformation temperature. Also you could just do multiple layers to get the needed thickness. Ultimately I hope it will be a cheaper, easier, quicker and better fitting solution than a sleeve. But we will see once I have actually tested it. Also I believe that the air pocket is the actual problem and not the urethane. Meaning filling the air pocket will in most cases already eliminate the problem.

I designed my own nubs and put them on. I did not use heatshrink since I did not have the right size - either too small or too big. I simply fixated them with some duct tape and slid the wheel back on. Worked perfectly. Since I never actually rode them (so I also never had a wheel slip) I can't say if it solved the issue completely. But having no air pocket should at least be an improvement.

I'd watch out buying those hubs, they still have the urethane slippage and mediocre QC. They also refuse to change the urethane recipe, and no they will not just add the nubs ethier. If we look at Hummies Motors they have groves in bedded in the actual can of it and so the urethane will not slip. I have done this aswell,It also allows it to lock into place then just holding it by the nubs, it provides a safer ride then let's say in the worst case someone's nubs breaking  and or Cracking under my case. :) 

I'd share the exact details but then my R&D be pointless to a extent. I'm trying to bring back reliable hub motors like Hummie! I appreciate the skepticism though! It's not that I don't want to share the exact details but I'm trying to make a business out of it :wink:

That particular sleeve hasn't worked for most people. If you read the thread carefully I created this solution a while back with a design that I made. 

The sleeve is thinner tighter and fits better overall. Price is $20 and it works great for everyone that's used it. 

If you really want to use that particular design ride that rubber with no sleeve so it stretches or talk to Jacob on how to make it work for you. 

That's a pic of my design and a wheel that used it for about 250 miles. 

This is a proven strategy that works the M1 uses a hard tpu plastic liner around the urethane to maintain structural integrity of the wheel.

Guys so on the topic of the urethane I got something new to contribute. Based on what i researched on the solid inner core of the M1 wheel I think the idea can be applied to these motors. I don't have much knowledge on urethane but I'm thinking on production of inner sleeves that are thicker around 1/4" so the outer perimeter is completely flat around the circumference. Once that's achieved a regular urethane circular profile can be developed and epoxy bonded to the inner 3d printed sleeve. I have a couple 3d printers and shapeways can also produce the files. I need someone that know urethane really well like @hummie to provide guidance. Ultimately this will allow us to running larger diameter wheels past the current 83mm. 

Who's down to collaborate?

You really mean 90a or do you mean 90mm urethane? If it is 90mm, the urethane would be a bit thin with the polycarbonate inside. Wouldn't it be a smoother ride if the urethane is thicker? What is the diameter of the polycarbonate?

The urethane is 90a the diameter will be 88mm total the polycarbonate is 71mm at the highest ridges. 

17mm /2 there is 8.5mm on urethane cushion.

Just want to get a feel for the demands of these. How many of you would be willing to buy these if I can put them into production? 

You will get 2 wheels for $69 bucks shipped with a polycarbonate core and 90a urethane at a diameter of 86mm. No slip no issues or your money back.

Ideally if this pans out and I can get at least 10 buyers I'm willing to produce the wheels in diameters up to 100mm and expirement with softer compounds. Since the summer is coming around I thought the timing would be perfect. All the materials used are USA based and personally built by me so quality control will no be an issue. My cores for the wheels are fitting very well and take 6 hrs each to 3d print. Later this week I'll put the file up on shapeways so you can order it and do your own urethane pour if you'd like. 

Call me anytime if you'd like to discuss 305 834 2929

The off-road versions will come after.

Ok just to be clear these will be sold in pairs only. That means one set consisting of 2 wheels. 

The difference in diameter between the factory urethane and this design will prevent you from only running one of these wheels.

Yes sir its moving forward in the standard size for now. Thats one that i did a week ago the outer perimeter stuck to the mold but the bind to the polycarbonate is incredible.

Hi Ralphy,

I have Jacobs Hubs which have been unmodfied. Would these fit directly to them, or would I have to do anything at all. If not, then im deffo in for a set. What colour Urethane will you be using. Thanks

This is a direct fit no mods needed. Once the design gets approved by the manufacturer we can pick a color. I'm thinking black but I'm open to ideas. We need to get $500 bucks to put them into production.

Today I tried Jacob's hubs in FOC Mode. The silent sound is really amazing, just one thing is a bit strange. When I connect the battery and start riding, the first meters the motors are not run smoothly. It feels like you ride on a very rough road. After few meters everything is fine and even if I stop and start again it is not running as rough as before. When I disconnect and connect again, same thing happens. I know @Maxid runs also with enertion 4.12 VESCs in FOC. Did you experience something like this. Is there anybody else running this hubs in FOC Mode?
Btw. I use the firmeware 2.54 of @ackmaniac - watt no rev. with brake.

You need to change the shunts if you are going to use foc with these motors. You need a higher resolution for detecting the motors correctly. Changing the shunts will also reduce the current you can run through the motors.

Did you change the shunts on your VESC? Is it difficult to unsolder and solder them (I'm not bad in soldering but I'm not a SMD-Solderman). Is the "Observer Gain" value between 60 and 100 meant with 5mOhm shunts or original shunts or both?

[quote="jacobbloy, post:897, topic:4762"]
Changing the shunts will also reduce the current you can run through the motors.

How much? Motor max 30A would be fine?

Btw. you should come back to the "motor game", because your Hubs just need a bit of modification then they are great. I'm happy that I got used hubs from @bigben.

True @jacobbloy - I am very happy with my Hubs so far. Only minor improvements should/could be made:
- no air pocket for smoother ride and no urethane slipping
- use solid metal rods instead of screws to keep stator from spinning on the axle
- slightly bigger grub screw (or better yet: a bolt) plus flat spot on axle

Use stainless grub screws and the stator won't rotate . To can add a little retaining fluid to bind it on there good. 

The urethane issues are fixed.

If there is back and forth your drilling your holes in your truck too large. 

I don't even use the 3rd locking grub screw and I don't get any movement at all. 

Glad to hear you don't have urethane issues! Enjoy

I use the standard truck the motors came with and did not do anything to their grub screws.
I also don't have urethane issues because I put my own 3D printed nubs there right from the start.

OK that's good to know , hopefully it helps others too. 

I used the Paris v2 trucks and drilled the holes nice and tight for a snug fit. 

I wouldn't shave or drill the actual axle for the 3rd screw. You can weaken it and cause an axle failure.

Better use bearing pins. I use 3x16. It's an easy modification to drill the existing M3 threads and to drill the holes in the truck deeper.

fellas, i seamed to have burned up one of my hubs. Turns out you really need both motors working in unison. last night, the axel screw came loose on one hub alowing the entire thing to rotate and unplug itself. Therefore the other hub was doing twice the work and burnt itself out. 

Anyways, is there anywhere to buy single replacement hub motors? since Jakob seems to be out.

Well it had smoke pouring out of it. :smile: after it cooled down, I tried running it again but the motor won't spin. Only hesitates. Then again, I didn't try swapping the VESCs so see if was actually the hub that was broken. I Could try that when I get home.

Which setting do you mean, the max current? I believe I set both VESCs to 20A max.

I Had the same issue when I first got mine.  The hub spun around and tore a connection from 2 of the wires.  I scraped off and burned the enamel off the winding and soldered the wires back on and it works like new again.I ended up drilling a small hole in the axle and using stainless set screws along with red loctite to keep it in place.

Oh yes I did  groove my ABEC clones that came with the 1WD board went over gravel like no problem - grooves on front tires make a major difference in the ability of them to 'climb' onto gravel not just 'push' in front of them.  
The belt became the weakest link as there was no way to tension it  
Tho the  motored plain PU heel wore off pretty fast, it was due it digging and scraping all the time. I do like deep grooved wheels so I want to try out composite wheels with fiber and some strong particulate backed PU. Should make them tougher, give better heat resistance and stiffer

In BLDC there is no need to have hall sensors, but I want to use the hubs with FOC and without hall sensors the motors stutter at start up. The space between the teeths is only 1,5 mm, so there it's difficult to implement the sensors. Therefore I tried it frontally. One motor is finished and it works perfect. I use focboxes with fw 3.100 from @ackmaniac .
