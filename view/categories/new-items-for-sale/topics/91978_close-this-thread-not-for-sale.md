Hi, are the enclosures used? In the website it looks like they don't come pre-drilled.
For the battery enclosure are the holes from the left and right misaligned or is it just the picture?

Iâ€™m selling them for cheaper because they are slightly misaligned. I never used them or attached them to my board.

Nah sorry. I ended up re-drilling the holes and filling the misaligned ones with epoxy. @mmaner can you close this thread?
