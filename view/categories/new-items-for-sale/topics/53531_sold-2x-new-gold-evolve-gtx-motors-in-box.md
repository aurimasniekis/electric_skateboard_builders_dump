UPDATE: These have been sold. Thanks for your hospitality. I lost a lot of respect for this forum by the "comments" on this post. If something is priced higher than what you think it's worth, then take action by not buying it and moving on with your life.  Peace. 
****

I‚Äôve got 2 Gold GTX Motors from Evolve for sale. 

These are brand new, still in box.

I believe these are not available for purchase by themselves. Not even through Evolve. 

Rare find. Only two. Being sold as a pair. $599 for both.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thank you
-Chris

I mean he's not breaking any rules I don't think.  (As long as those photos finish uploading...)  Someone might be scouring the planet looking for exactly these motors.  If so, they're in luck.  For what it's worth, the posting should stay in my opinion.  Nobody is being forced to buy them.

Those motors are the most accurate example I've ever seen of a polished turd. Don't get me wrong, they're not bad motors when you pay $70 or $80 for two of them, I have them on my board, but they are by no means premium.

Jeez, hey i‚Äôm all for being skeptical of people online that you arent familiar with, and I admit these are priced high, but what gives? No need for torches here people. 

I know someone that works at Evolve, and I built some stuff for him custom, and this is how he paid me for parts and labor.

They are in fact genuine evolve GTX motors. No body is forcing them upon you. Someone out there might be looking for these, if it‚Äôs not you no worries and good day. 

I dont know why the photos arent uploading, but the exact same photos can be seen on my website thru the link i included in the original post.

And as I already addressed in the comments on a previous post, my screen name ‚ÄúMoney‚Äù was a old nickname some friends gave me about 20 years ago after I showed them the movie Swingers. I created my account on this site over a year ago and at that time I was not expecting to be offering items for sale on here. Lately I have been realizing, personally, i need to create a more positive association with the word ‚Äúmoney‚Äù in my mind, instead of associating it with bills and stress. I have fond memories of those times back in my early 20‚Äôs and I liked the nickname at the time.

My name is Chris Flynn. If ANY of you have any questions or would like to introduce yourselves, or allow me to introduce myself, you are each welcome to call me directly at 619-457-6203.

I am not here to scam anyone. That assumption is actually the complete opposite of me. I own two businesses and I sell a fair amount of things on craigslist. I deal with scammers all the time. Mostly wasting their time letting them think they are reeling me in. The idea is that if their busy chasing me, that‚Äôs time they wont be preying on someone else.

I‚Äôm a good honest person. I love building high-end skateboards. 

Honestly, give me a call. I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for reading this.

-Chris

Honestly, this kind of thing is exactly what this forum needs.  These are things you can't get _anywhere else_ and they are used for electric skateboards.  This is exactly where they should be listed.

I mean if someone had a brand new set of Electric Flywheels or something else which is 100% impossible to get, I would expect them to sell for a high price too.  Because someone, somewhere, is looking for exactly that item and can't find it...

As far as I know the the gtx motor is actually gold plated. so it is worth something. 
 also new maneufacturing stoped making gold motor for gtx
so, it is rare to find now.

but given that we are the biggest forum and people arn't interested in collectibles it will be hard sale.

Maybe some rich evolve owner wants it. then again he might already has original gtx :thinking:

I know money personally and have bought several items from him. He offers amazing customer service, makes friends of his clients and is incredibly helpful in teaching people about making boards. He is exactly what this forum is all about. He told me about this site and I haven‚Äôt stopped visiting since. Even made a couple of purchases from people and money helped me with any questions and would solder things that were to difficult for me free of charge. So please lets not jump to horrible decisions and boot a valuable member of the community

Maybe someone is trying to fix a board that was run over by a car (aka: Death Machine) and this is the only place they can get a pair of replacement motors, and they've been told by a court to have it fixed like-new.  You just never know.  There are so many assumptions in here, it's crazy.

I welcome listings for impossible-to-find rare stuffs that are for esk8.

Nobody is making you buy it.

Funny though, people sure are vocal when they hate from behind a keyboard. My phone has yet to ring since I posted my phone number an hour ago. (Well i mean no calls from anyone on this forum.)

People are roasting you because that‚Äôs a stupid price to pay for motors. We are used to getting 6374s at a bit over $100 those evolve motors are what? 5055? They are probably Maytech anyway

And as for gold,  I‚Äôm not sure anyone really cares for that

damn dude, you get your feelings hurt easy...especially when it isn't even you I'm talking to.  

Let me make a couple of points.

1.  I never used the word banned, I said boot.  that means kill the thread and give a warning.  
2.  You don't like my attitude, I assure you I'm gonna loose a lot of sleep over that.  The fact is, this is a ludicrous topic.  I think people should be warned about that.  Others think of it as collectable, ok, whatever, I disagree...I'm all good.
3.  I definitely didn't say crucified.  If your gonna call me out at least be truthful about it.
4.  "Is it that difficult to be respectful?"  I doesn't see that you know how to be..as once again...I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU!

Personally I feel you. But no rules were broken, beyond good taste and decency. 

@Money perhaps you can reduce the price to something reasonable or politely close the thread so we can avoid a longer debate. 

I think you‚Äôd have better luck on an Evolve forum where people are more excited about branded products and where they have no clue how much a brushless motor is worth.

I think we have a slight misunderstanding here. So I'll try to sum all this up:

@Money I don't thing anyone thinks you are a bad member of the forums, or a scammer by any means(at least i don't). I don't think he should be banned, or have the topic closed. 

 I think everyone just thinks your price is a little crazy. People have the right to say they think the price is insane, just like you have the right to list things for insane(seemingly) prices. This is after all a forum for discussion. 

Best of luck with the sale.

everything about this thread is hilarious. From the $600 Evolve branded gold anodized Racerstars to all the conversations about how this isn't a scam, to the irony of somebody selling $600 racerstars and saying its not a scam in the same damned thread, then somebody actually buying them. 

There simply isn't enough popcorn.
