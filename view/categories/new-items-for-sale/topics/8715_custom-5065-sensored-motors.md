Look what just arrived!! My new custom built Bittblock 5065 Sensored Motors! These things are great, sensored and inexpensive! The wire is silicone and wrapped in mesh for extra protection and organization. They're 200kv of madness! And, I'm selling them. Limited STOCK! Just did a quick run of them to see if anyone would be interested. Let me know if you'd be interested in buying one. Selling them on my website.

Looks identical to me.

@michaeld33 Does the supplier of this motor also have a similar 63mm version?

Yep two versions actually.  I do not know who supplies ollins motors, but they seem to be very similarâ€¦ If not the same. Not going to go ahead and say that they are the same motor though, just in case. --  I don't know where he gets them made

```
I've gotten a couple questions about 63 size motors. Yes, there are plans to stock 6355 or 6368 (whichever is more desired) honestly the KV is TBD, larger motors are usually wanted at a lower KV, so there is the possibility that the 63 motors will be ~ 100-175kv. That will also be determined based on demand.

What makes these custom? You picked the specs?

Also the manufacturer for the motors in the current group buy I am running told me someone contacted a Chinese trading company and gave them the exact same specs as 'my' motors. She then said they won't do business with them. 

You say limited stock? Looks to me like only 8 motors. That's extremely limited IMO.

Shaft has that flat spot instead of a keyway. Also 4mm instead of 5.5mm bullet connectors. Those are the only differences can tell from the pictures.

Like I said, I don't want to buy 30 of them if nobody wants them. So I just bought a few. If they sell well, I'll order more. Already working on orders for more of them. I doubt that was me considering the only people I reached out to were the people I bought my motors from. But what don't you PM me. The specs I gave were fairly simple, 200KV, 5065, sensored, etc.

Believe it is the same as the Ollin bolt hole pattern. I don't have them with me right now but if I remember, it's 38mm diagonally, 28 vertically/horizontally.

This really goes on to show how inexpensive motors really are. Motors are probably marked up 100% most of the time, but that is understandable when volumes are low.

Motors are not cheap, but not expensive. You have to keep in mind shipping costs, taxes, and transaction fees. Which all add up quick.

No pricing yet. I believe it will be similar pricing to the 5065. When they go on sale I may do a price discount like I am doing for the 5065 (although that depends). 5065 sell for $59.99 -- 6355 will probably sell for around that price- still will be less than Ollins 5065 motors, I can promise that much. Cannot confirm final price at the moment. I will post the info on the site as soon as I have figured it all out.

Hey Guys,
So the 6355 motors cost about $20 more to produce :head_bandage:
So for that reason. The price per motor will be $70. 
I am trying to minimize cost as much as possible on these motors. The 5065 motors will remain on sale @ $50 for now (meaning I make no profit). Will return to $60 in a couple days.
6355 Motors are SENSORLESS.
Thanks,
Michael

Alrighty friends. I have gotten much interest expressed in these 6355 motors. For that reason, I have put up a pre-order for those wanting motors. By participating in this pre-order you effectively hold your spot for the motor(s). I have put the entire stock up for potential pre-order, so when it's out. It's OUT. More can be ordered. Some motors have already been claimed, act fast! Every purchase is backed by our money back guarantee, as well as the assurance you will be getting constant updates including pictures, videos, and lots of information. Link to motors:
