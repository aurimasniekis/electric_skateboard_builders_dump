Gauging interest for the 3rd run of the board.  

Trying to maintain the list google sheets this time.  

Batch 3 interest
https://docs.google.com/a/kopi-d.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBzjW1MZgIS4r-k8R1eO9UYA3uM1IBcLiQTiChG8Jq0APy4w/viewform

Batch 2 post
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/diebiems-v0-8-2nd-batch-total-48pcs-closed/58327

The deliverable are as followings:
1 x DiebieMS v0.8 (2oz PCB) assembled. (SD Card and RF module NOT mounted). Components I have stayed true to the original design including the expensive press fit terminals

5 red and 5 black x wire connectors (non-crimped) for battery and VESC 4x.
1x Male 16P connector
20 pcs non-crimped terminal for balance cables (some are spares)
1x Momentary switch
1x OLED 0.96 Display
4x single end male connector with cable (JST 1.25mm 5p, 10mm) (Display, switch, canbus)
1x single end male connector with cable (JST 2mm 4p, 10mm (VESC side can bus)
6x M5x14 spacer screws
1x 80A Fuse

Asking for 120USD/pc shipped to major cities around the world via Hong Kong Post with tracking Number. (~8-10 days) destination tax and duties not included. PM if interested, I will create PayPal invoices.
10USD/pcs goes to @JTAG as donation for the great design.

The new batch will start when I have received ~50 pcs interest. Would take around 4 wks to make.
**** Remember to use CC/CV power supply with the BMS.

I do hope that @JTAG implements the USB C by the time this gets finalized and production starts so maybe we can get that feature on this batch? Could be wishful thinking at this point but who knows? :smile:

I read the original DieBieMS thread and tried to comprehend as much as I could but I'm not sure if they USB C feature will be possible to add via hardware or software in if it doesn't make it to the third batch. 

But I get ahead of myself :sweat_smile: we gotta get to 50 pcs!

Will future batches need higher order amounts? I noticed that batch 2 needed ~20 while batch 3 needs ~50 while everything else stays constant.

Also, USB-C PD will always be an add on option; this to allow people who already have a BMS to get this feature as well, but also to not further increase the cost of the BMS.

Really great job and I really would like to get my hands on one but not sure how long its going to take for this 3rd batch to hit the ~50 mark 

I‚Äôve got next to no knowledge in hardware so I hope to get a guide or help on how to add that onto it once you deem it ready!

For the sake of the components suppliers rather, I am the manufacturer.    Those components suppliers always asks for quantities of thousands.  If I keep placing low quantities order, they will stop being interested.  I am pushing it already even for 100sets (50pcs being the current target start point).

Hi JTAG,

I am just extending my battery to 12s10p via 4 x 6s5p.
Got two DieBieMS and want to run each on 2 serial 6s5p as 12s.

Could it be possible to give each DieBieMS Module a difference CAN ID 
like 10 & 11?

Got two Tramps VESC6 and dont know how to wire the CAN connections.

Do you got any advice?
```

---
## \#51 Posted by: JTAG Posted at: 2018-09-26T19:55:49.459Z Reads: 318

Will the 12S10P always be a complete combined pack or will they be separated in 12S5P form time to time? If it always remain a 12S10P pack than you should put both 12S5P strings in parallel (also the balance leeds) and just use a single BMS.

Yes you can change the BMS CAN id to anything you like with the BMS Tool.

## \#68 Posted by: Samau18 Posted at: 2018-10-02T07:21:06.574Z Reads: 286

The balance cable drains at about 3A, so 20awg should be good. 

Nothing to it, use the proper crimping tool.

There should be two steps in the crimping tool.  silicon on the deeper platform, wire on the narrow one and crimp down.

I think I gave extra terminals, practice a few times and you should get the hang of it.

I want to build the DieBieMS.
I know it could be cheaper to order it here but i want to try it myself.
I was linked from another topic and I hope you csn help me.

I think he means the ones that are designed to drive LED's for horticulture. They have some that are CC + CV so basically work the same as a charger. What is nice is no fan and water proof.

I think there is cheaper options in the LED range for our use I just did a very quick search. These have input voltage up to 528v which Im sure costs more and not a feature we need.

I think the sweet spot especially considering price is gonna be the HLG-240H-48A on ebay. The "A" suffix indicates adjustable voltage and current. 44.8v - 51.2v for the -48A. 5 amps.

Hey @Devilmycry I would not trust that one as their description seems like it was badly translated from chinese. Also it is HUGE.

You need any constant current / constant voltage power supply of 50.4v for 12s charged to 4.2v per cell. You can even use a lab power supply for this job.  Is there a reason to go for 8 amps? I guess you have a large battery?

What is your budget for a power supply? If your budget allows I would try to find one with 
1. Adjustable voltage. 
2. Without fan.

Whats your location, maybe people could suggest something.

I would also recommend the Meanwell HLG-240H-48A as @deucesdown did above. Only downside is 5 amps not 8 amps like the one you showed.  These have no fan and are really high quality. They even have a 7 year warranty. These can be found for around $70

If you really want the extra power and have the budget $135 go for the more powerful HLG-480H-48A which has adjustable amps from 5 - 10a. It is pretty large though.

@JTAG advises that you need the voltage of the batteries plus 3v so would any charger that can do 45V charge both a 9s and 10s 4.2v cells.

Cheers,

But there is now another question:

The CC/CV power supply need not the exact voltage of the cells package.
The voltage level of the cells is regulated by the BMS.

The CC is needed to charge the battery not to fast (also the BMS can be the limiting factor).
The CV is needed if the BMS is disconnecting and if there is no CV the voltage would go up and  destroy some parts.

Is my thinking correct?

The BMS will have a load of about 30 micro amperes when it is disabled, therefore you dont need any other means of separating the battery from the BMS. It is intended to get rid of that hassle and always be connected.

What‚Äôs people thort of problems or better ideas?

I'm looking at the HLG-240H-48A and the GLH-240H-54A. You and @deucesdown both suggest it and I am looking for a cc/cv power supply for the DieBieMS. I've got a 10s6p battery but want to keep the current to under 3A, preferrably 2A. would going for the 54A version allow me to charge a 10s and a 12s pack on the DieBieMS without issue? I read that the BMS should prevent over voltage but can't do anything about over current so if I get the 54A, and just supply the amps I want, the BMS should handle the cutting off of the voltage that it is set to and be fine?

I unfortunately got a Meanwell powersupply but it isnt CC/CV so I gotta find one that will work for my 10s6p build :disappointed_relieved:

-48A is nominal 48v, adjustable 44.8-51.2v
-54A is nominal 54v, adjustable 50-57v

for current,
-48A 2.5-5a
-54A 2.23-4.45A

The voltage adjustment range is not that wide, so probably you'll have to figure out what you want out of it and choose one. You can add one of those ruideng/drok PSUs inline to further control voltage/current. Something like this covers 10s-12s

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/RD-DPS5005-Constant-Voltage-current-Step-down-Programmable-Power-Supply-module-buck-Voltage-converter-color-LCD/32684324154.html

I believe Ruideng is the original mfg.

There's a buck/boost version, that has wider input range.

You can probably use one of these guys with the meanwell you already have. They have bluetooth and usb options, for remote display/control/logging if you're into that.

Thanks for that! I think I‚Äôll be going with the 48A. I read that you mention it being good for 10s and 12s as well? I think the adjustable Current range will suit me fine at 2.5A at 48v and I can just set the cutoff on the diebiems to about 42v to prevent over voltage. I‚Äôm guessing that should be fine? :sweat_smile:

So if I‚Äôm going down the right line to charge a 10s4p I need a cc/cv 42v output (to charge the pack) + 3v extra for the BMS min. max at 6amp continues charge for q30 in this config recommended 

so I‚Äôm presuming it will need to be a 48v  was looking at the meanwell led drivers but there‚Äôs 4 options in the HLG240H range 

48
48A
48B
48C

[quote="Wraith, post:225, topic:65313"]
48A. I read that you mention it being good for 10s and 12s
[/quote]

Standard lithium ion charging is CC/CV with C/10 termination. So for a 10s 5ah pack, that means constant current until you hit 42v, then taper off the current until you get to 0.5a, then stop. At this point you are100% full.

With diebiems, there are some other factors. To get full charge, you need a +0.6v offset for the diode. For the automatic behavior you need another +3v. If you add this +3v, in theory if I understand correctly, the bms still cut charge at 42v (if cells all charged equally) while the charger is set up for 45.6v. This means you never get to the CV portion of the charge, and will never get to 100% full (Which is probably better for your cells in the long run).

10s is 42v, diebems offset (+0.6v, +3v): 45.6v
12s is 50.4v, offset: 54v

Neither 48A nor 54A cover that range.

One way you could go is, If you get the 54A and a DPS/DPH psu, you can get what you need from one PSU. The DPS/DPH are limited to 51v I think... So you can set up the meanwell for 54v, and for 12s plug straight into the meanwell, for 12s go through the DPS/DPH unit to drop it down to 45.6.

In a way this is similar to figuring out how to charge 10s, 12s and 13s. without diebiems. :slight_smile:
 
BTW I really like putting something like this inline on the output

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/ATORCH-Accurate-Energy-Meter-Voltage-Current-Power-300-100A-AC-Voltmeter-Ammeter-Greem-Backlight-Overload-Alarm/32821731871.html

measures watt-hours transferred, among other things. The numbers are precise but not necessarily accurate. :slight_smile: This particular version is single piece (no separate shunt box), and LARGE. 0-300v, 0-100a.

min amp on cv mode
[/quote]

The way CC/CV supplies work, psu will put the set voltage on the output if the current demanded by the load is less than the set current limit. Once the current limit goes below the set limit, the supply will maintain the set voltage. The load determines the actual amps drawn. The supply can set a high limit. there is no low limit (well, 0a is the low limit).

## \#231 Posted by: Darkie02 Posted at: 2019-01-03T19:31:47.409Z Reads: 189

I get that but I thort most cc/cv will cut out in cv part of the charge when the load drops below a certain point this stops the bms finishing balancing cells. I‚Äôve seen poste were people over time destroy cells in battery‚Äôs because the charger cut out and dident the let the bms balance all the cells because the load was to low. 

Of the top of my head I think the diebiems will balance with some thing like 0.4a (I‚Äôm trying to think way back for this figure from posts months ago so might be wrong)

Meaning the cv needs a minimum load of less than that to finish balancing all the cells.

That‚Äôs the part I‚Äôm now struggling to fined in the manuals and looking for help with.

Unless I‚Äôm getting confused with a more basic charger.

Im not sure if this confused me more or not after reading it a couple of times lol. Thanks for the wealth of info! I should probably just stop bothering with picking a PSU that can do 10s and 12s and simplyify things with picking a pack for my 10s6p haha

This means the 48A should work for me just fine with diebiems plugged directly as I can simply adjust it to the offset, 45.6v and diebiems will supposedly handle the trickle off at 42v(or if i set it lower)? but will not work directly on other BMS because it starts at 44.8v? 

I‚Äôm really invested in the diebiems now which is why I got in on batch 3 for my backup in case anything goes wrong with the one I‚Äôve got now so I dont wanna screw up my psu all the more as well :sweat_smile:

Edit: 
You mention that the load determines actual amps drawn, is this during charging or did you mean for discharging? Or I could just be confused with the stuff I‚Äôve read so far lol

I get you now, I'm in the same place. It seems to be a fine balancing act between the charge-rate of the bulk charger, the balancing current of the BMS, the pack over-voltage-cutoff, and cell OVC. All indications are that BMS are not balance chargers. They can keep closely balanced packs in balance, but if you have a fast charger or cells are a bit far out of balance, the BMS may not help at all and may even hurt, keeping the full cells at 4.25v for prolonged periods. This is why I like the BMS's where you can see what the hell's going on.

@Wraith the in-line watt meters are great to have regardless. The one I posted is nice because it's huge (stays in place), button to reset watt-hours is not recessed, and has many digits precision. I have another one with a color display, that's nice because it doesn't remember accumulated watt-hours, so I don't have to reset it every charge. Oh and just to make sure, ammeters go in series (even your multimeter one). Most cheaper clamp multimeters can only measure AC current with the clamp.

This means the 48A should work for me just fine with diebiems plugged directly as I can simply adjust it to the offset, 45.6v and diebiems will supposedly handle the trickle off at 42v(or if i set it lower)? but will not work directly on other BMS because it starts at 44.8v?

would my understanding be correct in the case of DBMS?

That sounds pretty awesome. I think I would be shot of I gave something too big. I think some battery builders would have a good idea of what is realistic size.

within a 140mm by 60mm rectangle would be acceptable. 

it needs to have/do the following in order to make my pants uncomfortable:

* active balancing, not just half ass balancing. If a p-group goes over 4.185v divert power to the lower voltage cells and bring everyone else up, and shut off the charging for anything at the desired charge level
* optional discharge bypass through the fuse of our choice, preferably a compact fuse type in the 50 volt range that will actually fry at 70 or 80 amps instead of cooking way before that
* built in eswitch with at least 6 massive fets that can also serve as over discharge protection when enabled. Yes the unity has one, no the og focboxes do not, plenty of ESCs don't. I'm not talking about a temp switch trick, i'm talking about support for halo push buttons with the option for an always on jumper in case we do have an ESC with a switch
* port for a fuel guage to plug in
* 5v accessory port of reasonable power levels. I need to light up the world with it.

What about isolated DC-DC converter, or like few of them, that steps battery pack's voltage down to 5V, switches it through transistors to reach multiple cells and charges the lowest one(s) with 1A?
50V >> isolated DC-DC 4.2V CV and 1A CC >> multitransistor packages to switch into different cells >> lowest cell(s)
This way instead of wasting all 100% of energy into the heat, you recover like 60-70%
There are these tiny isolated Recom DC-DC modules that are like 12x8mm so don't take much space.
I think you would not need more space for that than you already use for all the high power resistors in your diebiems where you can't even use all of them anyway because of thermals

Most often when a battery needs balancing a single cell is to high preventing further charging, with the method you describe a single DCDC will have to charge multiple cells, which is ofcourse possible but takes some effort on the algorithm and possible some extra time, the biggest challenge is designing a DCDC that accepts a wide input range (because the bms should already work from at least 6S and hopefully in the future work up to 18S).

But I might ofcourse be missing something and there might be DCDC's around that are capable of doing this, than please share them and w'll give it a go!

I got everything set and working but while making some changes, i broke it( the cell node part of the circuit for 3 of them) The voltage readings were crazy(for the first 3 cells). Debugged to found that i had destroyed few of the R36 resistor. replaced, it got a lot better, but not quite. The voltage readings were still a bit(0.2 volts) off. Also noticed that it changed with temperature. After probing the board at several places found that I had corrupted **CP** voltages. It was because those vias had increased resistance(like 2.5ohms, while the good ones were 0.2ohms)). Not that i have designed a lot of circuit in my life, but @JTAG should the vias be beefed up or doubled given that they feed the balancing resistors?

I have ordered some pcb drills(0.3mm) to reconnect the vias. Let's see.

It could be that they indeed got damaged, having 2.5ohm will indeed be bad when balancing is active (which in your case it is). 

I will look into beefing it up a bit, in cases like this where something went wrong with wiring always something will fail to death, beefing things up will likely move it to the next weak point.

@JTAG 

For me, a bms size should be of 2 ideal sizes. 
1. On a single cutout deck (or just regular enclosure build) should be able to fit under 2 VESCs or  a dual VESC, like the unity and dual 6.6. so about 120 x 60mm would be ideal for this

2. On a double cutout deck, it should be the same size as a 4p module. So about 74x56x22.

I'm still not sure if I know all the features DBMS has and how they work yet since I never looked at it much due to it's price and size. Personally I don't use discharge protection since I have a good understanding of my battery and charge with a wattage meter to monitor the overall health. If there is a bad p group, charge only bms will stop charging before hitting max V.

Here's my list of wanted features:
* Varriable voltage cutoff
* Integrated antispark switch with precharge and a fuse cartiage that you can yank out the fuse for physical disconnection when shit goes down. 
  * Or just a pair of solder pad for either fuses or solding an external loop key. This might be easier.
* UART port for external communication of individual cell voltage, SOH and SOC (connect DAVEga or other dash display or BT modules)
* integrated buck for 5V, 12V accessories

* for footprint I suggest makeing it small and modular. 
  * if possible make discharge protection an optional PCB / shield that you stack or place separately with a solid connection.

Temperatures going up to 60degrees celcius(with 5 balancing cells), I reduced it to 3 to manage heat better. 

Ideally, I should put a small fan, not a heat sink.  A fan that runs while balancing only( I saw that option in DieBieMS_tool but unimplemented, so you are probably already working on it)

It is a calibration issue with the ISL chip(we are finding the measurement can be off by 1.5v).  Danny added a comparison check in the latest version to make sure the LTC and ISL have a consistent value.  (Which is why we have the production delay now) 

If you updating your board (future or older version), there may be a need to enter a calibration value in the configuration. Danny is testing this now.

We are talking to the ISL engineers now to address this issue for the future.  Ideally they should be calibrated well enough without the need for user to calibrate this manually.

Hi Samaui18,

I'm really impressed by JTAGs design and your manufacturing.
When would the last possible date be for signing up?`I might have two friends who would be interested.

Cheers

Ok we found that it is likely we have a bad batch of ISL ic.  All of the ISL samples (10/10) direct from the manufacturer was measuring within tolerance.  After consulting with Danny, we agreed it is our goal to create the absolute best product.  So we have decided to get new ISL before we begin, unfortunately a little more wait (around a week).  

This means there wouldn‚Äôt be a need to worried about a calibration value from v0.9 forward(this batch) we will gate this at the manufacturing end.  

For previous versions, there may be a need to add a calibration value if yours starts to complaint on a voltage mismatch after the new firmware update.  

Sorry for the long wait, we will push this through as soon as it arrives. 

Best Regards,
Sam

Danny is still testing it I believe.

Hi @JTAG I've had some problems with configuring the DBMS from Batch 2 using v0.8 hardware and currently v.024 Firmware. I'm using the 0.24 version dbms tool to configure it. I currently am experiencing problems with it as it does not charge even after setting up correct capacity, P count and Series count. I'm also getting an error when  switching on the BMS via power button 

![D03709B8-CAEB-4A04-A1B1-D01C3B12000A|375x500](upload://4sXFqGVJ0feX8x6rpD4qjgptslM.jpeg) 

when charging, it briefly shows the charging symbol but shuts down right after. When I try to query the status via the tool, It isn't reading the Pack voltage and current values but reads cell info

![image|690x481](upload://elFgkEdIy47XCsX72gSijsECksV.jpeg) 

Has anyone gotten any similar behavior? I flashed it coming from the 3.x version and can't get it to charge but I have the Meanwell HLG 48A set to 45v output which I had it set to previously and used to charge before.

Mine is also in state "held by customs". The taxes are not my concern. I am concerned about nice German regulations about any conformity. Another package had been send back by customs after I can look at the device at the bureau but they do not hand out because of missing CE information. And that device did obviously do radio things... I hope they give it to me because it is only a replacement part or a piece of hardware not a final product...

There is a difference in VAT and duty.
Duty depends on the HS code (Zolltarifnummer)
VAT is 19% in Germany an you pay that on everything you buy on a daily base in a shop in Germany.

If you buy outside the EU a 100 Euro item you pay 19 Euro VAT and duty depend on the HS code the item is categorized by the seller.

VAT has nothing to do if the product is crafted in Germany or not.

Hi @Samau18 / @JTAG  

Firstly, just got my BMS all wired up. Mostly everything looks good, really pleased with it :) 

However, my cell temps seem to be randomly cutting in and out? They work sometimes and dont work other times. I am 99% sure its not my wiring. 

Any Ideas?

So, got mine today. I have already run the confing and connected everything accordingly. 

BMS turns on, display works, push to start works but CAN does not work. Any idea why?

My focboxes still run FW3.40, any idea why I cannot recognize the BMS? Do I need a newer VESC-FW?

Can baud-rate is set on all devices at 500k. 

CAN from one vesc to the other works. 

(BMS wired: Gnd-CH-CL-5V+C_enable using the upper connector)

Anyone got the same issue? @oyta did you fix yours?

Thanks in advance, Mathias

Tried that now, but there were no reply. Just blank in metr Terminal.

Next I connected to the VESC and tried CAN Fwd to 10 but got the following message:
![image|690x193](upload://m9WL3081pq3ZRC57h9akoXkVdCg.png) 

I also connected to the DieBieMS and tried it the opposite way, and got the same message in that Tool.

Finally I tried flipping CH and CL doing the same, but same result. So just banging on the wall it seems. I start to believe it is broken? :sob:

Edit: I also tried connecting the USB to the VESC, CAN Fwd to 10 in the DieBieMS tool and then connect to see if that did it (recognizing the FW), but the same result. Also doing the opposite connecting with USB to the DieBieMS and connecting with the VESC tool with CAN FWD to 0.

Generally the Engineer PA-09 is the go-to for hobbiests crimping small JST style terminals.

No personal experience with these on the wurth (molex?) terminals though. One testimonial in the other thread:

Read or watch a bit of youtube first. :) This crimper only makes 1 crimp at a time, so 2 steps to crimp a terminal (once for the conductor, once for the insulation). It gives a lot more control than the ratcheting crimpers, which makes it very adaptable, and is why it gets great reviews.

Few questions (sorry if already answered) :
- Is there a manual somewhere (even unofficial/draft). No luck to power the board through USB just for programming (without any lead connected)
- Does screw terminals need Loctite ?
- Has someone hacked the FSESC 6.6 Dual with internal Canbus for connecting the DieBieMS ? (I'd like to avoid the 6.6 Plus with embedded Powersitch). I was thinking about soldering wires on the CAN switch but how to know CANH CANL between both ?

- kinda, but I would not recommend it. Try older versions of the tool, maybe the newest does not match the preflashed FW. Connect it and configure the parameters manually. Remember to click "save configuration to flash memory" (or something similar // button located on the right side) after configuring, otherwise you will lose the settings

I could be wrong but I'm assuming these escs have a common ground so of the 3 pins, they will be 5V, CANH and CANL. Don't ask me which is which though...

There is no reason to pass 5V from one vesc to another. Is not even recommended, plenty of blwn vesc situations for using a 4pin jst cable

You need atleast 12v connected to the pack +-.
Atleast that is what I've figured out, dont have my new pack yet but was able to hook up an adapter to power it so I could fiddle with the programming.

I managed to connect to the DieBieMS with a power supply (but only with Windows, no luck with my mac using USB-C adapters. But this isn't a isolated issue. F$*%ing USB-C).
One weird thing is the pack voltage getting stucked. I changed the power supply voltage, It stayed at 22.56V.
Another normal thing knowing that no cell balances leads are connected ?

Anyway, the potential of this BMS is crazy, mostly when a good communication will be working with VESC. I'll try to write a custom FW for VESC to let it react to BMS needs (could save us from faceplant if the BMS asks VESCs to stop instead of shutting it down).

Can't wait to dig more into this ! :relieved:

I used blue Loctite on all my screws, checked the terminals for elevated temps while on the bench running, and I don't see any signs of the terminals heating up.  I'm pretty sure the fact that you need to tighten these screws down makes it so there is metal to metal contact everywhere there can be, and the Loctite just dries up where there would normally be air.

The balance leads would be at the opposite of the BMS. Not possible I guess.

I could hijack the canbus and 5V/GND from unused PPM (slave side) on the FSESC 6.6.

I'll post some pictures once arrived (I took the 19mm one, shorter than the 16mm....).
Also, I bought a bunch of these tiny rocker switches :
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32801573590.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.1f3b4c4d0LOmj4

I also need a little switch to enable/disable push to start as I'm still not convinced 100% of its use (I'd like to avoid turning the board one each time I tow it).
This one doesn't take so much room.

Finally, I published on Thingiverse a STL of a frame that hides the butcher's cutouts I did in my enclosure for the OLED display :face_vomiting:

@Samau18

I have problems with my DieBies. 

Still havn't figured out how to solve the FW issue with the older 0.8v verision from batch 2. Dsn't seem to be flashable from the DieBietool.

Also on my latest DieBie(v0.9). Everything seem to work fine. I can connect and do w/e but when I write new values I get a handsake that its done, then after powercycle, all new settings are gone to default.

Tried reflashing it. Didn't help. Not sure what the problem might be. 
I got another v9.0 unpacked so I can check if it has the same issue, but right now its bit mind boogling.

Ok I see more of you guys are having challenges, let me build a new version of the tool that let you help fix this issue. 

**The problem**

In the very early days of BMS development the BMS Tool was not yet available and I leaned up on the VESC tool to do the firmware updates and configuration trough the command terminal. For the command terminal to work the VESC or BMS tool supported firmwares should match that of the firmware in the BMS. For these first batch of BMSes the firmware version was set to 3.3x to matcht the latest VESC teel available then. However now that the new tool is available the real firmware version is stated which is about 0.30 , therefore the BMS tool doest not let you perform the jump to bootloader command (which is needed only in the first 3.3x version of the firmware).

**The solution**

I will now build the latest version of the BMS tool which supports the 3.3x version of the firmware in the first batch of the BMS production. This will allow you to perform the firmware flash and allow you to do the jump to bootloader command.
```

```
Please find the latest V0.30 version of the BMS tool on the releases page of the BMS tool github:

https://github.com/DieBieEngineering/DieBieMS-Tool/releases/tag/V0.30

Use this tool to connect to the BMS (it should detect V3.38 and not give a warning) and in the firmwares tab go to firmwares and update the BMS to version V0.30 with the lastest ESK8 binary. Once writing of the firmware is completed go to the terminal environment of the tool type over there:

bootloader_jump 

The LED on the BMS will now blink fast and then reboot. When trying to connect again the firmware version should now read V0.30 

Please note that this step of typing bootloader_jump is ONLY needed for the 3.38 firmware version. In the newer / latest versions that all happens automatically.

What are the changes with since the 0.27 ? (latest one I guess)
And could you please give some details how to compile FW from your source code ?

It seems to have worked! I didn't get an error about the 'newness' of the firmware, and the Limited Mode is no longer. 

It does still say FW write timeout in the bootloader upload page and I had to execute the bootloader_jump command in the terminal to get the BMS to reboot and show the new bootloader, but other than that yeah I'm set. 

Thank you @JTAG!!

No changes in the firmware that are used by the esk8 version of the BMS, just a default config update and as far as I know a DCDC config option added ( all for an efoil bms which has a DCDC converter ).

I used that back then ( more than a year ago ) to cheat and let the BMS use the VESC tool to be configured trough the firmware and terminal tab, now it has its own dedicated tool and I can use "my own" firmware version numbers.

So my 9th balance lead bleeds the cell to around 1V after a day or two.. The bleed transistor dsn't seem like its busted (lifted it and charged the gate cap with diodetest on a multimeter) som I'm guessing its the internal circuitry of the LTC IC.. I guess next step would be to meassure idle current in the lead. 
Has this happened to anyone else? Killed two fairly expensive lipo cells before i figured it out.

Also the recommended zener protection diode on the gate isn't implemented as per the LTC datasheet. why?

I have been looking in the datasheet of the LTC and am not aware of or can find the need of an additional zener acros the gate of the balance resistor fet. 

I have quite some of these BMSes in all sorts of electric vehicles around me and so far they all work as desired. Some for 3 years now almost, so I am quite confident that it is OK :sweat_smile:, but if you see improvements just point them out ^^, it could of course be that I missed them!

Hi! 

This is my first post on ESK8 :slight_smile:
I have been reading this thread for some time now, and I would like to buy a DieBieMS for my DIY board. Seems nice to be able to have a BMS that communicate with the VESC.

I live in EU, Sweden. Can I buy one in EU, where do you live Samau18? 

And a big thanks to JTAG that came up with a nice BMS like this :sunglasses::smiley:

I have a very similar set up to your bio board including all same electronics was there much to getting the can bus to read on the unity with the diebiems? Or was it pretty much plug and play?

Did you have to use the bms antispark or were your able to still use the unity exclusively? And the bms was always on but used sleep mode?

@JTAG @Samau18 

I've got kind of a weird one for you.

I have 4x DieBieMS, 3 currently in use. The first two have worked flawlessly, my third I setup recently seems to have a quirk. 

Noticed it was not turning on correctly, had to double tap the power button. Also had it randomly shut off twice.

Checked status, power button was registered as 'pressed' even though button was in non-depressed state.

Press button in and hold it, check status, power button now registers as 'not pressed' 

Something obviously not right, thinking I wired the incorrect NC/NO on the power button, I opened my enclosure up to check, but only confirmed my power button wiring is correct.

Now, if I unplug the power switch entirely from the DieBieMS and check status, it still registers as 'pressed'/true. 

For now I just left the switch unplugged and have just used the RTS feature to turn the board on, will dig in again to test further as soon as I return from oveseas. 

Thoughts? Pullup enabled when it shouldn't be, magically somehow?

I am trying to avoid using a switch on my board, and that sounds like a "push to turn on" related thing...

Is it possible with diebie?

RTS feature is?
[/quote]

Roll to start, aka push to start, correct!

It does require a decent push but I found it to be more responsive than the Unity RTS feature. 

With this you can allow the DieBieMS auto-off timer to power the board down, and RTS feature to power it on, without a power button.
