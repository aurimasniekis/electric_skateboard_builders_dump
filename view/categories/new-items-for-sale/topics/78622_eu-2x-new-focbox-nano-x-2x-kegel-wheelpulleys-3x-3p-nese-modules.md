Just got these 2 weeks ago. They are new only the boxes are missing since I bought them from @pjotr47 and shipping to me without the boxes was easier. 
Ofcourse we got hit by customs so I paid a total of 212 for these 2. 

SOLD FOCBOX: Looking for €180 + shipping OR €90 + shipping each
- brandnew 

SOLD Nano X: €30 + shippng
- brandnew 
  
**idea kegel wheel pulleys**: €25 + shipping
- brandnew
- 2x (for kegel, 36 tooth, 12mm wide, with bolts, 3D printed in black) 

**NESE modules (3P)**: add for €5 each onto other orders. Shippin by themselves would be too expensive 
- brandnew, just used to check dimensions on a deck 


If you buy multiple items ofcourse there’s only 1 times shippingcost to be paid. 

I ship the same day or if it’s in the evening the next day. 
(I’m quite new here but just for your peace of mind, you can find me on reddit with the same name where I have 27 confirmed trades on r/mechmarket)

Is the Nano-X still available, and would it be too much trouble to ship it to the US?

Yes it is but it wouldn’t be worth it for you considering shipping would be around €24.

yes still have them. Somebody had them reserved for the past 2 weeks but he's not sure if he still wants to go through I think. He will let me know today or tomorrow. If he decides not to I'll come back to you.
