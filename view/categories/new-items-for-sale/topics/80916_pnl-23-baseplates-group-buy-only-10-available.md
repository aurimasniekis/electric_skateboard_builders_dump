PNL 23° Baseplate group buy. 

I'm in touch with the PNL guys and they have 10 more sets of rear 23 degree baseplates still available.  

They'll be available for shipping mid February due to travels. 

Quantity available 10

These baseplates are CNC cut, very clean, solid standard geometry fits randal, paris, caliber ect.  Pivot cups are amazing (I'm not sure if they come with cups, I'd guess yes. 

2 red anodized $75 shipped 

8 bare alum finish $70 shipped

Domestic prices listed, can ship anywhere in the world USPS or DHL. 

I shouldn't have to tell you why you want lower angle rear baseplates, but for dudes going over 30mph, who want to feel comfortable at that speed, let'e get in on the last remaining PNL stock of low angle rear plates.

Yoinked these pics off of google, but this is what they look like, have a direct line to the dude who has them in storage and am buying all of the baseplates to be shipped here by about the third week of February.

Edit I don't actually know what these look like.  I imagine they may look more like the picture on top in red, but we'll see.  I asked the owner to tell me which ones he has.

Wait, not even sure what that means... I need them to fit calibers or surfrodz and riptide pivot cups.  


Guys, you could totally put these on a MTB and get about 53 degree baseplates after the kicks angle is taken into account with normal trucks.  Then dewedge the back a bit and BOOM.

Then get some TB 218s or @Kug3lis Fatboy 240s and do your thing....

Maybe...

To anyone curious,
I checked, and Caliber RKP baseplates fit Carvon SD R hangers, but only with dual cone.  (The factory baseplates also only accept dual cone)

@drangboards lemme get a pair off you in a week or so(would take a single red if one left), this is a great score, thank for sharing

* Baseplate - 6061 T6 aircraft grade billet aluminum.
* Axles and kingpins - 17-4 heat treated stainless steel.
* Precision washers- 303 stainless steel.
* Riptide thane pivot cup.

These retail for €99 EACH on sickboards, you are getting a steal.

Here's some background as to why these are so nice, a really awesum thread from @squishy654  . These baseplates seem like a very shallow degree Randal except precision milled.

Just got the base plates.  I am keeping two for myself,  if there is room for it, so we'll call this one closed until further notice, but maybe someone will back out.  There is a slight difference in geometry between these, like I've seen on many trucks before.  The pivot cup is less than 1/8" or 3.1mm less of the pivot end inside the cup, but I've been riding a set up like this for a while now, with no issues.  Not the exact set up, but similar in that aspect.  So I will mention that these picot cups will wear out sooner, and will be susceptible to more slop theoretically than the original base plate.  Pictures show those differences.  Posting rough, will edit with pics.

Here are some pics showing the pivot cup difference between Enertion and the other standards out there.  I'm saying that the differences aren't enough to stop people from using other baseplates.

Yeah, looks like they are all low res, but meh. Learning experience.  Next time-download all individually first.  My iphone spent a half hour in the snow in the middle of the road being run over by car/cars, and I need to get a replacement, but I had a friend let me use his for these.  They are really high res, so some of the next ones I upload will be better.

PNL still has stock in trucks, and they make amazing 12 hole baseplates.  There is a small steel sleeve surrounding the pressed in kingpin which means zero slop, and much more confidence and turning angle.

I'll say that they are close to not working on these baseplates, however, I think there will be enough pivot in the cup.  I was thinking I might like to put something under the cup so it comes up and flushes the bottom of the pivot end.

I ride at less than 20mph so probably this is not applicable for me but just wanted to correctly understand the use. 

Basically we want the rear to steer less given the same lean? Is the same effect achieved by the evo deck?
```

---
## \#63 Posted by: drangboards Posted at: 2019-01-24T03:09:31.189Z Reads: 76

```
Yes.  This is exactly correct.  The EVO does some of the angle change in the front and the rear to keep overall steering about the same.  In this case, the rear has little steering so wobbles are much harder to come by, more leaning and less turning.

Edit: If you have a short wheel base board and are going up to 20, then a low angle rear plate would be advisable still because your turning overall remains tight-ish.

Look at slalom boards for a que on where boards will invariably go if people want to scoot in total confidence up to and above 20mph.  

Almost no angle on the rear trucks, high az angle on the rear, and stiff decks with a raised rear tail (non kick tail). We have something brewing for this. I want to see a TKP rear truck for Eskate with 2 motor mounts, in front and behind the axle.

Yes, specially if it is the adjustable one, because those have lots of carve to them and need a lower angle through either risers or the adjustable Baseplate to be a rear truck in an asymm slalom style set up.

That's a great set up for manualling, but the narrower trucks help with grip, and on a slalom board which isn't being manualled at all and thus could move the width down by moving a motor rearward.

Not sure what you mean, the truck hanger needs to be 149mm. Here it is 177mm, not using any spacers. The distance you see between wheel pulley and mount is what you can "get rid" of

I saw 177mm or 127mm.

But I'd rather run 10mm axles so i can get longer axles for pully bearings.

To the dude in I think France, who has the 2 coming your way, we need to talk.  I took so long shipping it I am wanting to send you  a third baseplate in 40 or 47 degrees to show you how sorry I am for taking too long on that one.  Get in touch with me and let me know if you want a brand new 40 or 47° plate.

If the international dude who is getting the extra 40 or 47 degree plate wants the 47, then I can sell you this 40.  Otherwise, the time has not yet come to sell any more of the trucks.  There will be some baseplates only available, and there will be a bunch of trucks available at a later date.

These trucks have more care put in strength and precision than most any other precision trucks out there, and that is why a set costs about $330.  

PNL is totally still stocked with trucks and they have some interest in getting into the eskate world, so I told him I'd try and help see how many people want to get PNL.

I do have 1 set of 40° plates left.  I don't want to piss anyone else off selling these baseplates, like sickboards, switchback, daddy's, flatspot all somewhere in the neighborhood of $100-$130 USD.   I'll do 100 shipped USD inside the USA for this baseplate.  

I have a set of hybrid cast/precision trucks, and some joeys at 165mm coming my way in the next few weeks, and we'll have a count of how many trucks are going to be available.

40°, 47° are available base plate angles
165mm and 180mm are available hanger widths, and there are precision cut hangers with no rake, and cast hangers with rake. (flippable hangers).   They even made/make tall bushing compatible baseplates which I'd love to get my hands on.
