Sorry, I don't make the rules.
I think this category was originally intended for people who sell parts on a regular basis

It's always a good idea to post pics anyway.
Also there are more than one version of the focbox

Yes pls posts pic. I image google the pics to find out if the picture is stolen from somwhere.  If it's not, I feel more secure in buying a product from a person I  don't personally know over the internet :slight_smile:
