The seller has developed this parts and selling them for a absolutely fair/low price, to ask him for the STL files sounds impudent for me. 
IÂ´m not the seller! Just my 2 cents.

## \#12 Posted by: longhairedboy Posted at: 2017-05-25T18:17:12.164Z Reads: 406

```
tiny amount of additional top end would be my guess. put these on 8" wheels instead of 66s on 7" wheels and you have a noticeably faster board. 

All of my street pulleys are in 1 tooth increments from 32 to 38. Fine tuning can be important to the overall feel of the ride.

I will reveal my secret ;)

I do not make pulleys  from aluminum block.
I modifies the finished pulleys, and these are available only in sizes 60t and 72t

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/f/afea6205f333b74743d1d4f9d0f5b6ea4d513424.jpg" width="690" height="429">

The advantage of this solution is it that:
- The pulleys are made of special aluminum alloy (guaranteeing durability)
- My milling machine has less work

The downside is that I have high costs, so my price can not be low :(

@Silverline
72t pulley fit my motor mounts for urban carver, and you do not have to change the belts either

Since the aluminum pulley has a different shape (looking at the cross-section)

@Maxid, @Tamatoa, @banjaxxed

I do not have time to create a shop. 
For me, it's a hobby, not a main business. I want to change it in 3-4 months, but  not now.

I have a lot of motor mounts for various trucks. I am working above next types
I will try to catalog my mounts and belt drives in November

A few weeks ago I bought a milling machine.
Still learning the art of milling. 
These are the first effects of my work on the milling machine, and will be next  :D

Well noted, thanks for the information. I did not intend to criticize when I said that I was confused. Even if you don't have everything catalogued yet, you still took the time to give an answer to my question quite fast and that is good enough for me. 
Anyways, keep up the good work, looks like you already know a lot about milling, you could have me fooled. Those pulleys look great.

You are doing great progress - love to see your stuff get more popular. 

@Nowind also does not really have his own store. I saw his direct drive on a German marketplace for esk8 stuff though - maybe that is something you could consider? No idea if they charge fees or anything though. Just wanted to mention it for you to think about. https://shop.elektro-skateboard.de

What battery enclosure are you using for that trampa build? This pneumatic thing is growing on me daily and I am already thinking about next year ;)

For me, after payment the order got sent straight away or within a couple of days (milling time), it can take a few days/a week to get out of Poland (Mountains lots of mountains) but after that its on the mat in good time. 

I did most of the detail/messaging on facebook the reply time to questions was better, as i think (opinion) Tom checks that more or gets better notifications perhaps.

@ [akhlut](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/u/akhlut)
The delivery time to the US is 2-5 weeks, the delivery time depends on the state in which you live
