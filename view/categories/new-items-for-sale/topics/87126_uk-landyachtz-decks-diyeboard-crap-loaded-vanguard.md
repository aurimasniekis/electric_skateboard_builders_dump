Yea, you can pick a new one up without import tax too and that's been accounted for in my price. The red is pretty sexy though ;)

The evo just doesn't do it for me, I can't stand anything with a taper

But the switch, :ok_hand::ok_hand:

Diyeboard 10S5P Battery w/ scraped up enclosure SOLD
[/quote]

hmmm neglected to mention the cut off XT60 and that the enclosure was cracked completely and held together with bits of tape - hole in the front with black tape over it, I'm calling BS on the 'scraped up description' and no it was already like that before shipping or no tape would have been in place

e: not picking a side, just simply saying that these enclosures are horribly brittle and are easily warped by low amounts of heat. They might need to be wrapped more extensively than most

I've destroyed my share of these, warped is fine, when an "enclosure' is split I would say it no longer becomes an enclosure lol it's more of a 'partial' battery plastic wrap heheh

'broken enclosure held together with tape' is accurate and that's what PayPal will be told I had a funny feeling this one and didn't F&F on purpose ðŸ˜‚

The hole on the front was there for months, i suppose i forgot to mention it but the casing can easily be used with it there. The xt 60 connector was completely stuck on and i was forced to cut it, but its of practically no value. The split was not there before and has happened during shipping. Please take more detailed photos of it.

The enclosure wasnt really considered in the price. The battery was already at like 40% cost.

sorry you seem confused , when you offer a 'battery and enclosure' then obviously the price includes BOTH WTF

I recommend no one buy stuff from this clown ðŸ˜‚

I get the feeling this way the plan all along , was never due to delivery or there would have not been tape over the crack prior to shipping lol

Let's see what pp say (MUTED thread now have your fun)

I have both but they're in storage units at my uni, so they're not accessible. I am probably going to one of them for my new street build, which were you interested in?
