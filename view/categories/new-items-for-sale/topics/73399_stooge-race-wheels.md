So it's 375 for 4 wheels, 4 hubs, 2 pulleys? Are pulleys HTD5M and how wide?
How much 1 wheel+hub+pulley weight? And one wheel without pulley?
The ID of hub is 8mm, 10mn,12mm?

Watch again wheel police. Initial tighten was cross patterned. Would also add, rattle gun wheel nuts at you own risk. Final tighten should be done by hand.

How much is a set of 4 wheels with 2 pulleys?

125 + 250 = 375?

Can we get a pic of each of the parts in total?

The 120 x 50mm 70a Street wheel for all time cruising and fantastic grip. Race wheel 50a front 45a rear is 13mm wider and  has stuck down no slide grip for track racing but reduces range due to high roll resistance.  Expect range on the street wheel to fall between urethane and pnumatics. I'm still on my Origional set of prototype race wheels but use the streets for everything but high grip racing.

Remember that his wheels are different. They don't come with the core's center hole to sit the axle bearings or core openings in which you introduce pulley sprockets. Instead, his wheels are like racing car wheels with a rubberized layer on top of another high density foam layer covering a plastic rim (I think), they are similar to auto tire rims; so in order to use his rubber wheels over 8mm axles (plus the pulleys), they require these @MoeStooge custom made aluminum hubs.

Yes! from the molds of Bishop Racing.  These guys are the rubber wheel making geniuses I worked with figuring out what foam density, rubber compound, offset and width works best for Esk8 Track racing.  Great people to work with and they make a great wheel for 5th scale racing as well. BRP is where I have my race and street wheels made.

Talked with BRP about this. For the off road knob tread the smallest wheel available would be 170mm. Can be made with same offset and foam density as the 120 in a 50 and 76mm wide version. Tons if good loose dirt trails here on SoCal.  Will be testing these after Barret Junction.

Grip went way up but not enough. Being a racing based company BRP worked with me on dialing in a race wheel that met my needs for the SPD2 event last year. 120mm x 63mm split Duro Stuck down grip.

It doesn't make sense for me to buy the adapters since they wont work for me. I want to make my own adapters.

 Besides, it didn't hurt my feelings at all when the community wanted to do a group buy direct to manufacture on the wheels we sell... If there is a double standard I should be following please fill me in.

Actually on my 10s system, my efficiency did tank a good bit.

On 107s with 18/40 I was doing about 20ish wh/mi in average/average aggressive riding.


On the Stooge wheels the same set up with 18/42 on then (120mm wheels)  I get upper 30s to low 40s wh/mi.


For somewhat similar riding.  They don't free wheel like 107s is where this jump comes from.  I also may jump off the line a but more with them because they stick so well as well....so there is that.

But my god are they asphalt glue.  I really like the feeling despite the efficiency loss.

Dropping the motor pulley to 17t will put the gear ratio close to what you have with the 107s.  Watt hr per mile on the street wheels should land on the upper end near AT tires between ATand PU.

Exactly my sentiment about desparaging comments made. This wheel has been a collaborated effort between myself and a racer who builds race wheels. This wheel was purpose built with its intent for electric Skateboard racing. The Street wheel was built for the world record board and has been tested @63mph. It has better qualities for cruising "Street".  You are in no possible way, going to buy this wheel "off the shelf". It is an Esk8 racing wheel, designed by racers for racers.

Thicken up your skin Brandon, over the past few days you have lobbed several insults my way and even referred to me as a loser even though the first three boards up the hill with actual skate wheels were boards I built taking 4th 5th and 6th overall. Poor taste man, hope you bring the same rhetoric to bakers once you are not hiding behind that keyboard. 

I was genuinely interested in trying out these wheels but after seeing how poor the efficiency is on them they fall outside my parameters for long distance racing.
