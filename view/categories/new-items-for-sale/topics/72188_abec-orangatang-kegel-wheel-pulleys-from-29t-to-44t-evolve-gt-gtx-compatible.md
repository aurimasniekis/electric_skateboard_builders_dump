Electric skateboard wheel pulley **(29T | 30T | 31T | 32T | 33T | 34T | 35T | 36T | 37T | 38T | 39T | 40T)** for 83/90/97/107 mm **Flywheels / Evolve** wheels - i tested them with 97mm Flywheels . 
I recomend for the **80mm** wheels up to **36T**, above you can hit the pulley to curbs .

They are made from PETG material ! I had no issues with them !

I tested them with my Evolve skateboard for 100+ km`s and they had litle abrasion.

They are 100% compatible with  **Evolve skateboards** : for **Evolve, Abec and Kegel** wheels, with the bearing inside of the pulley . The bearings are not included !

Or it can be used for other electric skateboards...

I designed in that way, you can take out the bearing (from the pulleys) easy with a skate tool :slight_smile:
They are 17.5mm wide to fit 15mm belts, but i can make how wide you want (13-20-25 mm wide)

Also have some 5M / 15mm wide belts: 255mm, 265mm +....

**V 2.0**

My new V2.0 pulleys for Orangatang / Boa wheels, with bolts + nuts are done :smiley:
This is used without the bearing inside it, for any trucks without modification .

They will be avilable from 32T to 44T and 12-23mm width .


**Price**:  
 - For V 1.0 :
    - 10 Euro /1 pulley (12-17 mm wide)

    - 18 Euro / 1 pulley+1 belt

 - For V 2.0 :

     - from 32T to 38T : 10 Euro / 1 pulley / 12-17mm wide
     - from 39T to 44T : 11 Euro / 1 pulley / 12-17mm wide
     - bolts and nuts: 1.5 Euro / set

  - 9 Euro /1 belt (15mm wide)

Postage cost: 

Europe: 11.5 Euro
Canada / USA / Mexico: 19 Euro
South America: 22 Euro
South Africa: 21 Euro
Australia: 22 Euro

Payment can be made on PayPal

and then sell a kit, It's very comfortable getting everything in one package thats not from china.

If you put 40-42T on a 80mm wheel that not going to work . Its too big, and you can hit the curbs..and you can broke the strongest plastics (nylon..etc)

For 38-40-42T is there the Boa 100mm wheel  
If you dont hit the pulley to a curb, it gonna last hundreds of km`s ;)

Again not sure what to tell you. I use a Nylon 40t pulley on standard Kegels daily and while the PETG broke the nylon is still going strong.

Still means that Nylon is the better choice. However good PETG is - Nylon will give you a stronger pulley which means you have more headroom in case something goes wrong.

Yes, thats true and only for Kegels . Maybe i will test out of nylon. But for me held up well :) 
For Abec pulleys there is no reason to use nylon, i reinforced them from interior , they are stronger then the stock ones from Evolve . 
![20181025_013928|375x500](upload://rU1tGRMZ1LU2DFt41zohUfyCXym.jpeg) 
Maybe i will do the same thing for the Kegel ones.

@ThermalChild  Hi. Yes i have , and i can make in orange or black(gray) . And no bearings included.
And you want the V1 to use with bearings or the V2 to use with bolts and nuts ?

If you go with bearing you need to have around 54mm

That's a little subjective, you have to factor in many things assess the strength/durability, but at the end of the day testing is what counts

Some factors which would be interesting to compare

Filament used
Infill %
Infill pattern
Nozzle size
Nozzle temp
```

Not all Petg matrials are the same . I tested weak Petg and much stronger Petg . 
And also tested some Nylon filament and was very weak ! Much weaker then my Petg.. :neutral_face:

You have to test the same type of filaments from different manufacturer and see what is the best for your aplication . :)

Ah the wink of irrefutable knowledge You tested them with the PETG filament you had with the printer and control conditions you had, or maybe I'm wrong and you are a scientist working in a 3D printing company who has a great breath and depth of knowledge in the subject  ;)

Sorry this is just subjective that PETG is too weak

You don't see the irony in your posts don't you? You also haven't tested all available PETGs and have no idea how I have ridden my pulley. This argument is nonsensical. If it works for you guys fine - but I trust my own tests more than the ones from strangers on the internet.

I think damning a sales thread with subjective experience trumps that but hey you don't think PETG is a good material for pulleys and that's fine for you. I've printed pulleys in PETG and they did not fall apart and that's fine for me

Let's beg to differ and see if this thread fills up with 'mine broke', I haven't inspected them but it would appear he knows what he's doing and has tested Nylon and decided against it

Yes, but you need to adjust the sprockets lenght, because this Electric Flywheels are 11mm wider than the Superflies. Take a look at this superimposed image of the old Electric Flywheel (my wheel, with dull color) against the 107mm Superfly and 97mm Refly which share the same core, but in which you can clearly see how ABEC shaved 11mm out of the inner face of the 107mm Electric Flywheel to create the 107mm Superfly.....

![Dibujo%20107mm|364x500](upload://aoZFAUSH9mv2LLx2vIpKb9FHVYM.jpeg)

...therefore, if you create a wheel pulley for this wheel, you need to consider enlarging the sprockets 11mm more than the actual wheel pulleys you sell for Superflies now, so the pulley could be use effectively with the Electric Flywheel.

I don't mind the price increment as long as you can make the pulley to size. The sprockets should be the same thickness, just 11mm longer than you usually made them and making sure the pulleys inner ring grabs the hubs urethane conical inner face.

Just wanted to leave a quick reply. Szatyi makes really great pulleys! They are sturdy and really well-made. I fired loads of questions at him, and he could answer every single one of them. He made them quick and kept me up to date. 

Felt like he deserved this review :slight_smile:. Good luck with the rest and will definitely recommend you for future orders.

Even though I bought them off your Ebay page. I'm not sure if new belts are included with the kit or not, and could not find a way to add them if they arent included
