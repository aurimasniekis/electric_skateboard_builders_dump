I realized i dont want to use lipos anymore so i made these and just left them alone. its done in the slim lipo configuration. http://www.ebay.com/itm/HobbyKing-ZIPPY-Flightmax-8000mAh-6S1P-30C-DIY-Maker-Booole-/182152465333?hash=item2a69220bb5:g:aFYAAOSwOtBXS~U1
Batteries alone are almost $100 X2  (i paid more for them when they were more expensive)  I can turn these into (2) slim 6s batteries if you need so you can charge them.  Ill heat shrink them for you too.

US only

It's ok I do have 1 question though I'm guessing you fit them with a balance lead do you make those leads because I can't find one that would be long enough.

If you buy them could you put a link in

fuhhh if I had a compatible charging set-up i'd buy these in a heart beat. I might have a custom charger commissioned to charge 3x 4s 6.6a batteries to stay within the 3x 100wh battery flight limit. those extra ah would be phenomenal if there was a good 12s 10a charger already in existence.

Let me see what the miami boards guy says he can do with this custom charger, I currently don't have any charging set up but if I can safely charge both 2x 6s's and 3x 4s's with the same charger (I assume yes), I'll start throwing numbers your way. I should know by tomorrow night, I'm drooling over those watt hours!

Still quite a noob here. Sorry in advance 😅 Can anyone help? Do I have anything to worry about here (aside from the obvious. Clearance under deck, insane top speed etc) I'm running a single 190kv 6374 SK3, Torque VESC, 90mm wheels, 16:32 gears and I just ordered 2 6s 8000 mah lipos I'll be running in series. I'm upgrading from 2 3s 5000mah lipos in series. Anything other than changing battery voltage cutoff start and end? Do I need to re-detect motor? Set any other parameters? Just wanna make sure I don't damage my VESC or any other components. Thanks in advance anyone!!

Only issue I see with that setup is you will go over the 60k eRPM limit of the VESC. At 12S you'll be at 50.4v on full charge, which puts the theoretical RPM of the motor at 9,576. Assuming a 14-pole motor that's 9,576 * 7 pole pairs equals 67,032 eRPM. Not 100% certain that limit still applies (may have been fixed in the firmware, not sure) but people still talk about it as if it does so I'd be careful if I were you because if it isn't fixed your DRV chip will blow.

The issue isn't the amount of work the motors have to do. It's the eRPM they can get to. If you ran dual VESC with that setup you'd just blow up twice as many VESCs.

With 190kv you should not ever hit the ERPM limit, I would put it at 60k anyways just do be safe
Your motor should almost always be able to run at max efficiency
```

## \#65 Posted by: Clonkex Posted at: 2017-09-14T00:24:40.620Z Reads: 50

How did you work that out? Are you looking at the [calculator](http://calc.esk8.it/)? It works off nominal voltage, so when the batteries are fully charged the eRPM will be around 67,032.

Hmm. Okay. Should I just go with 10s? This is the first I'm hearing of any of these issues being a problem. @Clonkex setting max eRPM to 60000 prevents DRV blowing. So I'm not worried about this. Motor efficiency not being allowed to shine is now a problem? Okay. I understand. So what is the sweet spot voltage wise for my current set up?

Yeah but running efficiently was never a concern until now. I'd hate to burn up the $70 motor prematurely. I'm SUPER nitpicky with VESC settings because I've already fried a VESC before. Not wanting to do that again I've done some serious homework on proper parameter settings. I suppose I'll run it for now and log as much data as possible. You guys are awesome for the info.

You won't burn the motor. At 12S it'll be pretty low current draw anyway and it's a 6374 motor so it'll probably only be mildly warm after a hard ride.

That's the plan!!! Gotta get some power under my 215lb ass. Even running at 6s and my gearing, my board scooted me around the neighborhood at a consistent 20mph. Upgrading to 12s is because I've gotten far to used to the speed. I want to scare myself. 😈

Oh also if you run a 15mm belt you won’t get any slippage either and the torque transfer is incredible 😍

Well you'll be running at slightly decreased efficiency, which means the battery will be used up faster (only slightly) and your top speed will be (again slightly) limited. However once the battery drop below about 3.8v the eRPM will be below 60k, so for the majority of the time you're riding you'll have full efficiency anyway. Only at full charge will it go above 60k.

Yeah I've got a 15mm setup arriving tomorrow (or hopefully today so I can get it bored and drilled at the engineering place tomorrow). Going to use an idler as well so 0 slippage :P

No idea how, mine slips like hell even at high tension. What size pulleys do you have? Mine's 14t to 30t. Thinking if you've got a larger motor pulley that might be why it doesn't slip. Also I weigh 110kg so that might be contributing ;P

```

## \#110 Posted by: GrecoMan Posted at: 2017-09-14T00:57:35.714Z Reads: 40

I’m an expert on voltage sag:
Voltage sag is when your VESC/Motor demands a bunch of current from your batteries, resulting in a temporary drop in cell voltage, doesn’t hurt anything tho.  Basically, when you come to the top of a long hill you may see your voltage monitor going up, that is your batteries recovering from voltage sag.
Again, voltage sag doesn’t cause any problems at all to any components on your board
```

Also would you really get voltage sag if you've got 20c 8Ah batteries? That's 160 amps. Seems like plenty to me.

Seems like it, but isn’t.  Atleast not with Li-Ions it’s not...
Yes, yes, I know “Li-Pos have higher energy density, your just a wannabe”, no.  I’m just saying he will probably experience a minor amount of voltage sag.
Sorry if it sound like I’m getting defensive but I can already hear all those Lipo lovers telling me I’m wrong 😂

With lipos it'd be only a volt or two at most wouldn't it? Not really sure why you're bringing li-ions up when @StormTrooperBert is running lipos.

I think I will become a lipo lover just because they're so easy to get hold of, and cheap, but I'm not yet, haven't done enough riding on any kind of battery to really have a preference :P

Okay so lipos occasionally having to "re-coup" at the top of hill or extra high load situations. Makes sense. And this is a part of the "mad inefficiency" you were saying earlier @GrecoMan ? Also range degrades as well which makes sense...what do you think max range would be if you had to guess? Mostly flat terrain here in Vegas. I know some other variables come into play. I was getting a consistent 6.1-6.2 miles from my 6s setup.  Would you say it was be slightly less than double due to the efficiency crutch?
```

It won’t effect inefficiency at all but if you’ve got the 16,000 mah ones and ride at 20-25mph you should be getting 10-15 miles of range

That seems like low range for 16Ah battery. Bert has the 8Ah packs and I would estimate more like 15-20 miles based on @MysticalDork's very rough estimate of 1km per 10Wh.

Just a minor pedantic thing here: Li-ion cells win in terms of **energy** density (wh/kg or wh/l) but li-po batteries win in terms of **power** density (w/kg or w/l) Granted, if someone were to put the same high energy density chemicals inside pouches instead of cans, the pouches would win with both because the pouch takes up less space than the can, but no-one seems to make li-ni-co-al pouch cells that are smaller than like 50AH.
