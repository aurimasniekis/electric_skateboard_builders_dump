Hello everyone!

I just designed and tested a prototype LED switch which I made for my VESC. These were prototype switches, but they work really well so I decided to sell the rest. I've put a lot of effort into designing this switch, and it's rated well over the regular power requirements. It's over-engineered I would say.

Each of the MOSFETs I use are rated for 120amps by the silicon, and 75 amps by the package pins (with adequate heatsinking). With four of these, this switch barely gets warm during use, and I've tested this by riding up a hill with a thermistor attached (although I am pretty light).

The main feature is the blue LED, which is a feature which is lacking on most switches. It's a waterproof button switch which comes with a rubber gasket. I did not include any connectors on these switches because there are a large variety of them, but I did pre-solder the 10AWG wires as carefully as possible for your convenience. 

The switch comes with the PCB, the blue LED toggle switch with a connector, and black heat-shrink tubing.

You can view more data about this switch [here](http://currentcontrolsystems.com/2016/10/01/designing-a-4-4kw-power-switch-for-vesc/), and you can buy the switch on my website [here](http://currentcontrolsystems.com/product/4-4kw-high-power-switch-for-the-vesc-w-blue-led-toggle-button-v0-1/). 

Oh, and most importantly! 

I have only eight of these switches availible, and the first four purchasers can use the coupon code:

**ESK8W/VLAD**

for $5 off! I have one which I can ship right away, and the rest I will ship over the weekend. If you have any questions just feel free to ask! Cheers!

PS. Also, fun fact, you can use this modify this switch to make a spot welder :P

You can use a car battery with a serie of mosfet to short circuit the Battery through the metal you want to weld. This is better controlled with a small microcontroller like in this project

> Hi Vlad

Yes, this switch will work from 6S, 7S, 8S, 9S, 10S, 11S, and 12S! It can also theoretically go down to 1S at the expense of more heat produced, and up to 17S (which is not guaranteed to work). The reason for this range is the regenerative braking.

> About that PS. How I can use this as spot welder switch?

Like akira said, you can hook this up to a car battery and spot-weld things like that. You'll need to provide a very short pulse, which can be done with a microcontroller, or a couple of discrete components as well (transistors and capacitors etc.)

> Order placed. Please see order notes and pm me if need be :slight_smile:

Sweet, thank you! I saw your note, and you have same question Concept has. It will totally work! :slight_smile:

> Looks great. Will they ship asap? Also when will the next batch be made (if you are making another batch)

Thanks! They will ship later today so yes. Before 9PM most likely. And my next batch will be a batch of 20 and it will come in about 4 weeks I think.

Awesome, @mmaner, @caustin, and @Bender! I got your orders and I'll post a picture before I ship them! Thank you everyone else who ordered. **There's only one left now!**

Hello everyone! I shipped all of your orders! **I still have one lone switch left over if anyone wants it!**

The delivery time is 4-6 days for the US, 6-12 days for Canada, and 6-14 days for international (I think I only got one order which went to Sweden). 

Each of the switches and buttons were tested individually at a load of 5 amps, and I covered each switch with heat-shrink to protect it. 

Here are some pictures!

Success! 😊 The switch will be a nice addition to my second board. Here's everything laid out for testing. The wires are waaay to long for my taste, especially the phase wires both from the VESCs and the motors (both Maytech) so I will need to do some shortening before final assembly.

@VladPomogaev: something seem to have happened with mine. When I turned it on today and then turned it off, the LED stays lit, though with a weaker light than when it's on.

I haven't done any changes from yesterday when everything worked. Any ideas?

**On:**

@rwxr  Hmm that is very odd indeed... Are you sure that nothing has changed at all? What happens if you disconnect the VESCs? Please check the connections to the toggle button as well. 

Usually when you have this connected to the VESC the LED will stay dimly lit for a bit after you turn it off, and it can take like 10 seconds for it to fully turn off. (These are just the capacitors discharging)

PS. You are running almost the exact same setup I am

Cheers,

Vlad

Tried disconnecting the VESC aswell, still the same and also the connections on the button looks fine.

Hello again everone! Thank you for purchasing my switches. The profits made off the first batch allowed me to improve the design and purchase another batch for sale. The same switching concept applies, but with some changes:

* Wider traces which allow for far more current 150amps +
* The PCB design now equally uses the two sides to carry current
* New high-temperature **copper** wiring is slightly smaller and less flexible, but conducts electricity better than the old aluminum/steel stranded wiring. ([Source](https://www.metalsupermarkets.com/which-metals-conduct-electricity/))
* And to reduce the size by 33%, the four high-power MOSFETS were stacked on both sides of the PCB.

As you can see, most of the upgrades were done to improve the rating of the switch, and to make it more suitable for really high-power applications (mountain-boards and 4WD). 

I'm just waiting for more LED power buttons right now, but as soon as I get them I'll put the new batch on my website! 

Cheers,

Vlad

I'm not sure if this is a dumb question or not but is there any current draw when off? If so how many milli amps? Like if you don't have a BMS would this eventually fully discharge your battery?

From Esk8 and it was well made. Soldering was nice. And they replaced it with no questions asked.

We had a talk in the forum previously and we came to the idea that when you connect the switch to the battery that a small current spike goes into the mosfets. Same like with Capacitors. And this might kills them. 
But we also could be terribly wrong with that. 
But since that i first connect the Vedder-Switch to the Battery via cables with crocodile clamps and a resistor in between so that the Mosfets can charge up. And then i plug in the cable. And i also try avoid it to disconnect the switch from the battery.

But it also could be that it doesn't make any sense. But i am a noob when it comes to electronics so i make this additional step and hope that the switch never fails again.

Yes of course!

[quote="lrdesigns, post:31, topic:14053"]
is there any current draw when off?
[/quote]

Nope, no current draw. (Well there is, but it's way smaller than the self-discharge rate of your lipo's). If you turn the switch on, then the switch will consume current for the LED and some for keeping the MOSFETS on.

[quote="NAF, post:35, topic:14053"]

[/quote]

The most common thing to fail here is probably either the actual button, or a pre-charge circuit (if there is one). As to the reason why they actually fail, I'm not quite sure. I've only had one problem with my switch so far, it resolved itself, and I wasn't there to experience it or troubleshoot.

@VladPomogaev So far my switch is working nicely...although I think I might be changing the LED button for a smaller on/off switch button. This one takes up too much space. It takes around 35mm of height.

The problem is my final deck will be opened up from the top. It's going to have a special lid with quick access to all electronics by pressing just one button. There is just no way I can mount the LED button on the side. Do you guys know of any other LED buttons that look nice but are tiny bit smaller ?

I usually just use the cheap half round rockers from the auto parts store. They are around 1/2 inch.

Hi NAF,

Unfortunately yes, the original switches were quite large. You can get a 16mm LED switch from eBay and wire it up to work (I have a wiring diagram availible). My second version of the switch comes with the 16mm model.

Cheers!

After the very first push of the switch, it seems it is constantly on. I've tried unplugging power, pressing the switch in various ways, etc etc.
Vlad said it could be due to the fact that there is voltage coming from the output side, but there shouldn't be?

This is my setup:

@rwxr solved the same switch issue by taking off the heat-shrink wrap I believe. I sure hope that the shrink wrap I have is not in the slightest way conductive.  

@Tomer sorry! I'm going to release an inexpensive "kit" version of this switch which you may be interested in. But in order to pay for the costs for that, I first need to sell these switches for full price.

No luck. Heat shrink is off and still no change. Even with only the switch and battery connected, it stays powered up no matter the position of the switch. It's basically acting like an oversized xt90 at this point... Do you do returns/repairs/exchanges? :confused:

Sorry to hear that your switch is not working. And yes I do repairs/returns. Please send me a top and bottom photo of the PCB along with how many lipo-cells you are using. If I can't figure out what's wrong with your switch, I'm just going to send you a new one. 

Also, another thing. Did you make sure that the switch is plugged in the right way? As in, the switch is meant to conduct current only one way; it would stay lit if you connected it the other way.

@VladPomogaev 

I'm using a 10S2P Basen 26650 pack (80A continuous, but realistically more like 60A cont, and 120A peak).

The switch is plugged in the right way. My diagram didn't reflect the two wires closer together, but those are indeed going to the vesc.

[quote="VladPomogaev, post:39, topic:14053"]
The most common thing to fail here is probably either the actual button, or a pre-charge circuit (if there is one). As to the reason why they actually fail, I'm not quite sure. I've only had one problem with my switch so far, it resolved itself, and I wasn't there to experience it or troubleshoot.

Does your switch include a pre-charge circut?

Just a note to existing and future customers:

I'm changing out the model of switch again to a white LED color. This switch is better in quality (and price). Hopefully that's okay with everyone.

Hey @VladPomogaev I'm thinking about getting on of these possible for my latest build, but I'm a bit iffy on the aesthetics of the switch itself. Your latest description of the switch with a white LED might be fine for others, but I personally loved the look in the picture that you first posted:

Hello everyone! Thank you so much for purchasing my design! Thanks to your support, I'm working on version 3.0 now, which is going to be smaller, more powerful, and is going to be offered as a kit design. I'm going to offer the kit with a very comprehensive manual/assembly guide. The design is going to address all of the issues my customers have experienced with the previous designs, and the new version should be availible in a week or so.

Cheers, Vlad.

Here's a teaser:

Hello again everyone!

Good news, I have 50 more v3 switches on the way! This model's theme is RED (red PCB and LED). I just got home to all of the parts sitting outside my front door, so I quickly assembled one and ran some basic tests. I tested mostly the precharge circuit (which worked as expected), and the functionality of the switch. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/d/fd675ffd616777d859278ef1a80252c23e2b6fb2.jpg" width="690" height="460">

I made two very small mistakes in the design of the PCB; I mixed up two labels, and I forgot to include a proper SMD capacitor pad. For the labels, I'm going to cross them out, and use a color code instead. As for the capacitor, I'm going to pre-solder them correctly for the kit version. I hope this is okay for everyone :slight_smile:

As for the precharge circuit, here is some data...
I used a 220uF capacitor as the capacitive load @ 12V. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/d/6dbc3fc94872341077049af3bba6e62fb1444f41.png" width="320" height="240">

^ This is before I soldered the precharge circuit. Rise time to about 67% is ~1us, or 0.00001s.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/9/a98a55f1d4410789468a1d94765a8793d0cbb5ff.png" width="320" height="240">

^ This is after I soldered the precharge circuit. The rise time to 67% is ~10ms, or 0.01s. After this waveform, the switch fully engages.

I also tested the switch at 24v and got a rise time of even longer, 0.1s I think, but I forgot to save the waveform. I still need to test this switch with bigger capacitive loads, such as the capacitors found on the VESC. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/1/f1808e60abac06de0b7f5d5f236e382ef5ca3fda.jpg" width="690" height="459">

So there ya go! I'm also working on a high current power supply and dummy load in order to test the design. From my personal tests and online research, a good test point I think would be 20+amps.

Good catch. You are correct! It's for setting the gate voltage on the MOSFETs. I could have put like a 12v zener diode on it to do the same thing, but the potentiometer works as well. You'll need to roughly set the potentiometer depending on how many cells you use, and you can use a cheap multi-meter (which every eboard maker should have), or you can just eyeball it. I was going to make an online calculator for it as well.

Sorry to disappoint you but this design is quite wrong in all direction and is just meant to fail as 30V+ applications(Seen in the earlier comments) kind of reminds me of the older me.
How ever I'm currently working on the most reliable E switch that is going to be rated for 12S max as 50A(without a heat sink) with a possibility for more powerful versions.

Got here for research purposes.
