Below are a couple of items I have for sale. The VESCs are lightly used, but everything else is brand new. Please add $5 to all items for shipping.

* SOLD - Enertion VESC x2 h/w v4.12. 4mm bullets already soldered on for motors. I've also shrink wrapped it and added raspberry pi heatsinks to the fets - $80 each
* SOLD - 255-5m-12 belts x5 - $25 for the lot (I wouldn't buy these in singles due to shipping)
* SOLD - [This](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10S-36V-Li-ion-Lithium-Cell-40A-18650-Battery-Protection-BMS-PCB-Board-Balance/32697273276.html?shortkey=ZFJJFNvY&addresstype=600) 10s BMS. Wouldn't recommend it for discharging but, if you're bypassing it, I'd say go for it. It was a little too square for me (too wide) so I never used it. Same price as Ali, but hey, faster shipping - $10.
