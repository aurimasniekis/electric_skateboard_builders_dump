Not a scratch on them, have not ridden them once, they are perfect.  Paid $120 plus shipping.  They are currently out of stock also, so here's your chance to get a fresh set of some of the newest and best urethane wheels currently made.  $110 shipped (in the US; though I will ship internationally if the cost of shipping is helped with).
