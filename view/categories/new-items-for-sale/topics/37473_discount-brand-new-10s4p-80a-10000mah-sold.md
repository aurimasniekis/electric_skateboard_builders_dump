So I'm offering to build a 10s4p battery pack with copper strip and a 10s bestech 80a bms as a thanks to all the buisness I've gotten and for all this community has done for me. Some people have budget builds but want that awesome range or a decent system but can't afford it or maybe someone just wants a good battery at a good price either way I'm selling this 10s4p for $320 shipped. I'll need a 1-3week build time and the configuration you would like it done in
