Depends what you want and wheels you going to use:

6.5" from trampa:

12S 170kv would give 70kmh / 45mph (which is kinda too much for me personally)
10S 170kv would give 58kmh / 36mph (this is more than enough for me personally)

12S 130kv would give 53kmh / 33mph (this is my planned set up for Urban Carver)
10S 130kv would give 44kmh / 27mph (this is a bit too slow)

125mm gummies from trampa:

12S 170kv would give 53kmh / 33mph (which is kinda too much for me personally)
10S 170kv would give 44kmh / 27mph (this is more than enough for me personally)

12S 130kv would give 40kmh / 25mph (this is my planned set up for Urban Carver)
10S 130kv would give 34kmh / 21mph (this is a bit too slow)

I would go 130kv @ 12S and 170kv @ 10s

## \#11 Posted by: Deckoz Posted at: 2018-03-31T20:46:31.563Z Reads: 339

Somewhere in the 2.4-2.6:1 range is perfect for 107s..

I'd swap out my drive train on my Evo in a heartbeat for a gearbox over belts...

Technically it would fit in size the same 1:3 as the gearbox is smaller than Trampa Wheel Hub which is 107mm size so just only wheel mounting is a problem.

I just had a talk with my father regarding making this drivetrain for 107mm flywheels. It's possible just the wheel gear would be made from aluminum together with those mounting ears, and only motor gear would be 8mm as the whole drivetrain would be even smaller.

To make this idea real I would need someone to provide those flywheels they can be used as long as mounting and center is in good condition.

I think 2.8:1 to 3:1 is perfect for 107mm wheels.  The above ratios is never enough torque and too much top-end

Not sure I follow why only 8mm (would have thought there was clearance to spare for the spur gears), but if you _could_ do one for 10mm motorshaft and 107mm wheels, let me know :) .

Any chance to buy this offer and wait for next production run? I have a set of 218 extended calibers.

Just edit the cart to allow for payment with 'I can wait option'

**Edit:** Looks like I will be waiting at least a month or two according to my bank statement this month, see you in the summer sales :laughing:

Ps. Don't forget MBS should get _some_ love

The tubes yea.. the tires I'm not sure. Because superstars and the like the outside of the wheel rim is a hair over 4". And 2" wide.

And psycho tires are 6*2" and have a 4" hub. People have said no to me..I can't find the posts.. but I also haven't tried it so for all I know they fit..

In my opinion they are same as belts, but belts sound in different frequency range, and gears in different that whats make them bit stand out, as it bit higher pitch deeper sound :)

Finally FatBoy Mini Gear Drive v2 for TB218 trucks now available!

The gear drive now allows to use lubrication, by minimizing available volume inside the enclosure, adding oil filling port, V-ring and stainless steel plates for preventing dust/oil getting in/out of the case for motor mounting/wheel gear/hanger mounting adapter.

Also new tooth profile, for more silent operation and better efficiency.

Also now 2 different wheel hub styles available:

* 3.75" Fits (Trampa 125mm Gummies, 6.5", 7", 8", 7" from Evolve, MBS tires)
* 2.9" Fits AliExpress 6"x2" tires

Surfrodz, calibers the trucks don't really matter, just rather not have mtb trucks because of the adapter I would need 

And shadowmere is the 1st build I started, then got hit with needing a board instead of just wanting one so I went for a commuter build.

That was the build where I wanted to use 2 of the 80cc rotomax's and u convinced me to search for other alternatives because of their mounts

Yes FB230/240 mimics caliber hanger profile so tb218/caliber style mounts work.

The new FatBoy SS Mini Gear Drive for TorqueBoards 218 and FatBoy 230/240 hangers with custom negative offset wheel hubs for longboard trucks was released :)

New design features all aluminium enclosure, metal/plastic gears and updated wheel hubs with custom negative offset and integrated mounting plate to reduce the length of the drivetrain. (Normal FatBoy Wheel Hubs or Trampa SuperStar doesn't work wheel hubs require custom negative offset as otherwise wheel hubs would interfere with gear drive and trucks.)
