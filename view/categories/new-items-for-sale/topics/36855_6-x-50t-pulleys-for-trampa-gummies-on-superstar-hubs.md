@Zacky yes the width would be fine, but there would be no pulley bearing.

The bigger issue is going to be that superstars use 28mm OD bearings - which don't have an 8mm ID option. So you will need to sleeve your axle to 10 or 12mm. As sleeving to 9.325mm would be to thin of a sleeve. 

Evolve trucks are 8mm with a 10mm section for the pulley bearings.

The last set can be purchased here:

If they are the same as superstars, yes. I have heard the MBS Rockstar Pro's are the same pattern as Superstars.

But I do not know for sure.  And I also do not know if the gummies fit Rockstar, 50T would probably be a little steep of ratio with larger pneumatics..
