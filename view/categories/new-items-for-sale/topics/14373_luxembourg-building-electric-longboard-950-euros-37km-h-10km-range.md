Hey guys I'll be building another longboard for a friend soon and I can easily build another one for someone else if anyone is interested. I'm located in Luxembourg and can build a single drive longboard capable of about 37kmph and 10km range (depending on riding speed) for around 950 euros. Payment would have to be upfront and building would take about a month.

Doubt anyone's gonna be interested but let me know. Can send pictures of my current build to give an idea of what you'd receive and can give more details about specs to anyone who asks!
