 The perfect companion for your 10S build, will never exceed max erpm on VESC4 and delivers as much torque and speed as is possible. 
**Works Sensored, Sensorless, Hybrid, BLDC, FOC.** 
I personally inspect and test each motor; that involves a mechanical inspection and several motor detections to test the electrical components; 0 chance of a defective motor arriving in your hands. I can confidently say these motors are very well water resistant, windings and hall PCB covered in resin, magnets epoxied to can, the only thing that could be changed to make it waterproof would be ceramic bearings. Having ridden an earlier version of this motor for several hundred miles through the worst conditions, I can say the stock bearings are sufficient. 
They are black on black on black; did I mention they're black?😋 There are no logos or writing of any of kind. 

**Specifications**
* **6374 190kv 3200W** Semi-Sealed (True 74mm Length)
* **12AWG** High Strand Count Tinned Copper Flexible Silicone Phase Leads 
* **5.5mm** Gold Plated Bullet Connectors
* Focbox, VESC 4 Hall Sensor Connector (**NO ADAPTER NEEDED**)
* **8mm Bore, Keyway**, 2x Circlip Positions
* N42SH Curved Magnets
* Japan NSK Ball Bearings
* Weight: 906 grams

**Compatibility**
* **6S-12S** (For VESC4 Longevity and Safety 6S-10S)
* **30mm & 44mm** Mounting Holes
**Pricing**
* **Dark Energy Drive Set: 2 Dark Matter Motors** $260 with shipping included within the US, intl shipping available, additional motors at $130


* **1 Dark Matter Motor** $140 with shipping included within the US, intl shipping available
* Shipping Daily M-F From **NYC**, USPS with Tracking
* Local Pickup Available
* PayPal cyberonu@gmail.com

Color Options:
**Blackhole Black**

   These motors are being made in small batches, allowing me to thoroughly inspect them, and there will only be 1-2 more batches ordered, quantity determined by demand. I'm personally keeping 10 motors for all my current and future builds. 

   I can guarantee that you will receive motors ready to plug in, run detection and ride, if there's some catastrophic failure in the first 30 days I will replace the motor and pay for the faulty one to be returned. In the long run I can promise to help diagnose and resolve any issues, within reason. 


You read this much...you deserve something right? 😃
**Free** 5.5mm Gold Plated Female Bullets 3x per Motor
**Free** Black Oxide Mounting Screws  M4x8mm 4x per Motor
**Free** XT90 Panel Mount with each order

Hey man... How many do you have available. I'm gonna need two more motors in the coming weeks..

Looks like the shaft is 8mm with a 10mm *10mm step for a 10mm rider bearing? Correct?

110kerpm seems to be the focbox limit if you keep it under 105F

12s should be fine, I weight 300lbs and I ride my dual 6374 set up hard on focbox and in the past week I've run about 100 miles with 0 problems no over heating. I flew up this bridge at 26mph with 20% battery, flying by cyclist up hill is one of the best joys of life.

Dual Focbox/VESC Can Connector $5
Bluetooth Module $15

Dual Focbox Loopkey Harness and Loopkey with battery indicator leads $20 (Battery/vesc connector can be specified, as well as single/quad vesc option)
![IMG_20180110_151146|666x499](upload://hvjvBiFMCTkJZJPozQ3v2bLpVag.jpg)

Electrically speaking, all you would need to get riding is a battery,vesc, remote.

Yes, I did. I'm on the fence with it. Might decide to go down that road. I'd much rather have someone who knows what they are doing, just build me a pack that will fit a modular enclosure. I'm a lazy ol' bastard and I couldn't be miffed with trying to make it myself.

The keyway and pulley are much longer than the key. Conceivably the key can be pushed out towards the end rather than centered along the keyway of the pulley as pictured there.

With the forces from the belt this could cause premature wear on the shaft/bearings.

If you cut/finish them yourself, they run to about 12c each from keyway stock, excluding the very expensive time of course.

I'd cut them a 1/2" longer & take the resulting financial ruin...that's just me, you know to be safe. Satisfy the keyway with the right key.

2 of those 12c keys and loctite :thinking: :gift:

Average Key Length Standard, inbalance avoidance, given these brushless motor turn at extremely high rpm there is a case for keeping them in balnce otherwise you could fatigure the shaft/bearings.

Measure the full length of both keyways(pulley keyway and shaft keyway, add the two dimensions together, and divide by two, then x .95

It's not as simple as that, really, what is best is a shaft with pulley and key on that is perfectly balanced as it spins @10k rpm, that is what avoids wear, I'm not saying it will explode and impode the universe and yes your millage will undoubtedly vary, I've never seen a thread with a worn bearing or shaft ever.

But if you are not interested in the accepted engineering practices/stanards, then there's nothing more for me to say, so avoir thread!

On the plus side I'm looking forward to these motors, thanks for takling to Cindy/Sandy/Bella or whomever in Maytech or Maytech wannabe, that's a particular pain I was looking to avoid.



But keep your keys for the next buyer!

Dude it makes absolutely 0 difference whether the key is closer to the motor or further away. Whether it spins at 1k rpm or 10k, it's exclusively a twisting force and there's 0 lateral load caused by the key. Even if the key was three feet long and a metre from the motor it would still be a twisting force on the shaft, except for the centrifugal force. The _only_ thing having a short key towards the end of the shaft (away from the motor) would do is try harder to twist the shaft enough to shear it or destroy the key, which is exceedingly unlikely.

How close? You can add a couple extra spacers inbetween the wheel pulley and the trucks to kind of scoot the wheel out a bit more. 

Looks like there is space between the motors too, so you could add spacers inbetween the motor and the mount.

I have a couple threads on the trucks that I may be able to add a washer.  I plan to 3D print a spacer for the motors as well.  There is a small chance I will not have to hack the motor shaft.  I have been slow building this because ultimately I am waiting on Focbox's to arrive.

I could be wrong but I think Jaxys initial point was in order for there to be a key the keyway is created which removes material from both the shaft and the pulley (this unbalances the assembly). If a key of material of similar density fills the entire keyway then the components collectively will still be balanced, or within spec. What the tolerances are for operation I do not know.

@banjaxxed have I got what you were pointing out?

I think this is all silly here. 

Here's my two realms of thoughts.

- The pulleys most of us use are not press on and have a loose tolerance against the shaft. With a short key over time the pulley can vibrate back and forth on the shaft. Will it cause enough wear in our application to matter? Probably not. But I use full size keys.

- Press on pulleys likely do not need a full size key AS they were pressed on with a tight tolerance and not likely to twist or vibrate like a seesaw around a short key like a non pressed pulley.

One question: Are the 44 mm mounting holes really on a 44 mm diagonal circle? So I can start milling my parts for them

Oh no it was not esk8 related, atleast not directly, didn't fall or anything, my back locked up, figured nothing serious, tried pads some muscle relaxers, seemed to be getting better, till I woke up and litterally couldn't move my left side, turned out had a pinched nerve, caused some swelling and was getting intermittent paralysis on the left side. Can still feel a twinge in my back but otherwise fully operational

Your getting old bro!  Same issue, locks me up on both sides for a min 3 day period.  Stretching and fluid intake helps also the more I sit still the worse it gets...but then sometimes moving about isn’t an option... mornings are the worst when dealing with episodes.

If it's muscle related, maybe try some stretches before bed, then again in the morning in the hopes the previous night's stretching allows you the morning movement you need. 

Something real low impact like Tai Chi. Or maybe Hot Yoga, not really sure what it is, but Hot Yoga sounds way more fun than than regular Yoga.

![hot-yoga-image1|360x360](upload://6P1PN77O7UrMVPDxww1bVMwsZrV.jpg)

I used to get really back muscle spasms in my lower back, they would lay me out to where I couldn't even move, but after stretching for a few months and a small amount of weight loss I've been fine

I have the 170kv motor listed above and the Dark Matter motors, and while similar on the outside, one is far better than the other.  They'd both work about the same.  For the first week.

Yeah let’s do that. I have at least 10 of them sitting around because they didn’t pass my tests before shipping. 

@Randyc1 what makes you think they are upgraded?

He didn’t lie about anything. I’m just saying that you guys think they are upgraded, and they are not. Please find where he says the word upgrade in the first post. I can’t.

Do most motors have curved magnets ?
I have seen  High Quality racing drone motors to have Curved magnets to increase torque,...but never heard mentioning of this on  eskate motors ??

I have stripped a motor that looks exactly like the dark matter one (and the one that street-wing used to carry). 

One side of magnet is slightly curved, other side is flat.

Yeah he was in bad shape a while ago but he is on the mend now and he should hopefully be better soon and be back on the forum.

I was fortunate enough to purchase two of the Dark Matter motors from @scepterr and I have to say that his service, and the speed of the delivery was exceptional - better than some online shops that I've dealt with.
If he ever does another batch of these motors, I'd buy more for sure. Kinda kicking myself now that I didn't get a few extras when I had the chance.

Post 142 is not the DMM right.. And if magnets are curved the way mine were, you really can't tell by that  picture in post 118 as the curved part is facing the can.

ok,.. but should'nt the curved part be towards the Center core, to be as close as possible ?

It's a convex curve. Probably to have it better fit the curve of the can. The part facing the rotor is flat.

Yes i understand , but part facing rotor should be curved also , to get = air gap and more torque .

(Repost... For some reason reply went to sceptrrrrr..) 

Sure. And as mentioned before, the one in #118 aren't though. :+1:t4:
So, manufacturer calling these magnets "curved" is probably only to make it sound better = half lie
