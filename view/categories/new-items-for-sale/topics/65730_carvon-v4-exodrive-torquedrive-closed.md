Welcome back Jerry. 
There have been some changes and now all group buys must be organized by a member with L3 status and posted in the group buy category. 
For this situation you could just list these as New items for sale.

I think these have plenty of torque, but top speed is the question, and with vesc it seems they'll tolerate 12s? With focbox 13s seems somewhat safe with 200kv motors. May be safe here too?

If you don't go up steep and long hills and use 97mm wheels only, you're good with the TD. You can even do a front wheel drive and that will even get you going more.

If you want speed, you go with SpeedDrive. If torque, then TorqueDrive. If you want speed and torqe, the 4WD of the SpeedDrives will get you there. Unless I've finished building my Esk8 CVT with integrated braking, we're stuck with these for now. :sweat_smile:

Not recommended on 12s, there's some ghostly stuttering on the motors that I can't pinpoint. But ymmv since I haven't used it on a Focbox.

Well then, if I were you I'll stick with belts. Truth is, in terms of power-to-weight ratio, belt drives beat any direct-drive/no gear-ratio system on hills. That's just a fact.

Yes they will fit @goldrabe .you will have to add heat shrink to the post of the adapter hub for a nice snugg fit and it also helps from the aluminum hub from slowly eating the rim as it a soft plastic rim...the heat shrink should be shipped with the drives if you buy. as I received the heat shrink with my adapters I order for his SDR couple weeks ago

They are clone wheels, you wont need any heat shrink. 
The heat shrink is only for fitting the adapter to ABEC 11 flywheels.

Ok so this is where i dicked myself..@Moros ..I have so many wheels now...so let's start..I  have torque boards 90 mm clone wheel from a belt kit..and I have a action S and S2 green clone wheel..they didn't fit my original V4SDR that stated for abec and clones . Well the wheels are smaller..I went and bought abec 11 97mm for the speed drives after finding the clones don't work..then I didn't like the size it was huge on a kick tail...and then we here heat issues can occur maybe...and I .need massive riser so on for wheel bit ....so I wanted 90 again they look better I'd rather 85 looks like a real long board not a massive penny board ..Im pumped for the kegal adapter..well Canada sucks and I can't find lots of places that will ship to me .. so I ordered the exact so cal 7 abec clones but red wheel ..they fit perfectly ..the same as original carvon hub and abec 11...I just got the newest hub from carvon for my drive which he stated  these will no longer be the abec size..they are for clones ..I was so confused cause I have four wheels with two different sizing .well the arrived and they fit my green Acton and black torque board wheels perfect they are smaller then the abec11 and real clones ...because there are two clones I find out .. LOL..all you need to do is use the heat shrink for the abec11 and those exact wheel you chose @goldrabe ..I hope ppl understand this ..

These drives ride like a normal longboard, and you'll get speed wobs on regular bushings.

They get hot. Probably too hot but I forgot to measure on time. Here is a temp reading of 81 Celsius a few minutes after I came back from the following last and third recording of my ride. 

https://metr.at/r/jrEYJ

https://youtu.be/GP2l3nqEgV0

The metr pro app only shows this which is incorrect. 

![image|281x499](upload://hf1TLmAD4Hd0ZDk4GuSOQiaUu5K.jpg)

This is due to that we need the correct value for the beta thermistor value in the vesc tool. 

So yeah carvons overheat. Will show another reading later just after riding or during. I need to determine to which value I need to set up the cut off value now. If the app does give the correct reading I won‚Äôt be able to enjoy these motors because even though they get hot (too hot?) they ride fricken great. 

@LEVer Vesc tool .94 shows just above 52000 on my 12s setup. Don‚Äôt have video of this but I can make one. 
By the way when did these motors gain 10kv?

Make sure you lower Max amps and never go over 40A. If you want to keep top speed, you need to get bigger wheels. These motors are not meant to spin fast. They have 24 stator teeth and 28 magnets (24n28p), same as Raptor 2 motor except that one is longer. They have a lot of turns in them which increase resistance, and they will heat up if fed a lot of amps. Kv ranges between 75kv to 85kv.

```
@sayekim note that a temp. gun takes measurement of an area, not at the laser red dot point. So the readings of you gun are an average of the areas depending of the distance the gun is from the target point.  On small parts its better to put the reading optic of the gun as close as possible of the part you want a temperature reading. 

In all case your right, it‚Äôs too hot. Something will fail soon or later.

Not sure about the beta thermistor because we've never used it. I would say though that you have to start at 20A Motor Max for each vesc.

We have a 40A BMS on our EXO Pro and a generic, non-programmable Chinese ESC....and we can get up to 28 mph on 97mm wheels with the motors only getting warm. Theoretically, the motors are only getting around 20A each.

Forgot to mention, make sure you compensate by using short cone bushings on the top/road side. Or else you won't have enough threads. You can also just get a longer KP.

I just ordered these. My plan is to make an Evo-based board with TDs. My reasoning is that I don‚Äôt need/want the SDR speed.

My current plans are:

* TD 2WD (ordered)
* FocBox Unity (ordered)
* ABEC11 107mm SuperFlys
* Evo 39‚Äù or Falcon deck (unsure here)
* EBoards Peru enclosure

This will be my first build. I‚Äôm unsure how to choose the following:

* right battery pack to push 2WD TDs with 107s
* the corresponding BMS
* trucks spacers
* remote

I don‚Äôt mind spending more on the right battery setup. I know that I should try to keep the TDs at 20A or less.

10s2p 30q is the smallest you‚Äôre gonna wanna go, those will do 20A each so 40A in 2p. To reduce sag and increase range significantly go to 3p or more.

As for the bms, if you do charge only protection then any 10s bms will do, just wire it for discharge bypass or else you wont get 40A. Otherwise you could go for full protection with a 40A+ bms, but charge protected bms can get pricey although that doesn‚Äôt seem to be an issue considering the build lol.

Okay guys, we've got the motors from China already. But we're still waiting on the axles from the CNC shop. Normally we would machine the parts ourselves, but hardened 4140 steel is a bit too much for our machines. Hoping to get them in 1 - 2 weeks.

Hey guys, the new axles are expected to arrive this week. Once we receive them, we will build your units and ship them right away. The new axles feature threads to enable the use of axle nuts to lock the motors, much like the same as you lock your wheels.

![EXO%20Drive%20Kegel%20WA%20Drawing%20v1|690x487](upload://sGpryTpNdWF2H06pq0WpwvfpbO6.jpeg) 

We also plan to sell Wheel Adapters for Boa 100mm wheels. As you can see from above, we already have the design and will machine one soon to test fit it.

Shipping of the EXO Pro will also resume this week as we get all the parts. We will also do full promotion and tours with the EXO Pro as we ramp up its batch-production. We have also redesigned the regular EXO to compete with other entry-level boards and will do mass-production of it from China. The EVO Racing boards will continue to be custom-made and take time. But we expect to also ramp up its production very soon.

![CARVON%20EXO%20top|690x385](upload://hi8xX8KisZBh3ymCLT2by9jrUU1.jpeg) 

As such, [exoboards.com](http://exoboards.com) is up again. We will also be back in social media to reflect our focus on EXO. Lastly, we will build a customer service and support department to handle everyone‚Äôs concern.

Again, thank you for all your patience and support.

Wanna show you guys the new Extended Wheel Adapters. These patent-pending Extended Wheel Adapters not only allow you to use and mount different wheels onto your TD, they also function as high-efficiency heat sinks that cool the motors down.

They have slots that act as fan blades while the motor spins. I think we're going to call it DynamiCool! :wink:

We are going to ship them to you guys now. Again, thanks for the patience and support. We won't be here without you guys. The new Extended Wheel Adapters are also available on exoboards, so those who want to change their existing ones can order now. We machine them in-house so delivery is same or next-day.

So if the board is moving forward and the wind is hitting the motors, you don't think the slots will, even for a small bit, capture some incoming air that might just pass over the motors if the surface was smooth?  I only compared it to Raptor's static StatiCool and this one spinning, like a fan, but not the actual shape.

In the center radially or axially? So the koowheel motor does have an inlet on the other side of the motor.

I believe my sensors are not correct.  I am having issues converting exo TD to focbox custom. I used a 9 pin connector, solder 3.5mm bullet connectors, and connected them to the focboxes. 


However, the sensor wire, I read, could be the culprit as why I cannot pass the VESC tool properly.

Edit: my biggest issue is wheels won‚Äôt spin correctly. Then when using vesc tool or changing bullet connectors, I seem not able to get them to run properly.

The OD of drive is 76mm, that will leave you with 7mm road clearance. You could if you are riding on super-smooth road, and besides, there are the urethane sleeves to protect the part of the motor that get hits the most. It's like driving lowered cars, you just have to be aware and avoid obstacles as much as you can. But for practical riding, 97mm should be minimum.

The hold up on the EXO has always been about the drives. Now that everything is back in stock, we can continue shipping them again.

The holes on the adapter that fits on the outside of the motor, if they‚Äôre open to the outside and not sealed by the wheel, they‚Äôll throw air out.  But there‚Äôs also the same mechanism with the centrifuallly throwing blades on the other side of the motor too and they‚Äôd be fighting against each other if they‚Äôre both spinning

There is no way that air can directly hit the face of the motor head on, there is a big wheel that's blocking it. And in fact, since the wheel is there, incoming air is being cornered at that spot. So it's very effective to put an opening there to funnel the trapped air onto the motor. That's how "Esk8" aerodynamics work, maybe you shouldn't be always so critical of my designs.

EDIT:  I have no idea what was just posted directly above this.

The idea of the air coming in the hole as the wheel turns exposing the hole to the incoming air won‚Äôt work.  Look at formula 1 cars.  The dominating force is centrifugal and will be throwing the liquid (water or air) out.
```

The wheel being there will direct the incoming air towards that area, instead of just whizzing past by. Regardless, heat being "thrown out" is a good thing, more efficient than just statically radiating it off on the hanger. That's why I compared it to StatiCool, which is static, and mine is more DynamiCool (this is all pun intended only though) because mine is spinning like a.....wait for it....a fan!

Is that really what this is about? I wouldn't be selling anything if your adapters had fit the wheels they were supposed to fit from the get go.  I would've tried to reach out but after not receiving replies from you for months at a time when I reached out regarding other things, do you really blame me for not trying?

I did not intend to make a single cent from the parts I sold. I will send you a PM with extensive details of the group buy, the quotes I gathered from machine shops and how much people paid me. Anyone who wants details on what parts cost me and how much I charged my "customers" can reach out to me. I have nothing to hide. I do not think these details are relevant to this thread or I'd post them here. 

I would honestly rather not sell a single thing. I have a full time job. This is just a hobby for me. You left me with no option though as you can barely keep up with the orders you've gathered over the past 2 years. 

Sorry for derailing your thread. Good luck with it.

You need an inlet near the center of rotation for air to be supplied. I don't see where the air can enter. Sure it will try to leave the cutouts because it is being spun around at high speeds (because of centrifugal force, like how a balls wants to fly out when you spin it around wiht a string attached), but doesn't have a constant supply to replenish the lost air.

This is a screenshot from a journal paper to make things a bit clear about how the air would flow. Your cutout would act like the fan style on the left.
![image|690x271](upload://lbJJvjdrhTNKmqSmWu4zfHHiFYZ.jpeg)

![20181127_141802|281x500](upload://kzGYPzxxvQE2AqdQTYytNgfLxNJ.jpeg) 

What it has are heatsinks that are suppose to help radiate out the heat. If I would have fully covered them, then they would be useless. That's why I invented a Wheel Adapter that still makes use of them. It's really that simple!

Okay. You will surely have better cooling(both due to radiation + convection) because of increased surface area due to the adapter, but do understand that the cutout in the adapter doesn't help in trapping air and cooling your motor. 

Also the internal fins doesn't increase cooling by "radiation" because the net surface area remains the same(heat radiated from one fin enters the other). The fins would help a lot if there was some air flowing over it, which is again not the case. 

A different design of the adapter that has a lot more surface area with air flowing across the surface is what is needed for improved cooling. It is okay to be defensive about ones design, especially when the internet stranger could well be just pulling things out of his/her ass, but I had the chance to formally study all of this in the past.

First off, your photo is wrong:

Here's my very unprofessional MS Paint of the inflow in my design:

Sorry, that inflow wouldn't happen, not while the motor is spinning. Two ways to think about it:
1. Inflow needs an outflow(otherwise it would be storing air in that space)
2. When the motor is spinning, it would rotate any air in that space along with it and that would have the tendency to fly out(instead of in)

Since this is not going anywhere, I guess this is the last I'll talk about it. What you have is probably already enough (given that so many people are already riding them). Good luck.

There are things you guys have wrongly assumed here and are still not considering:

1. You wrongly assumed that the wind is going towards the face. Like I said, it's from the side and there's a big wheel blocking the wind from coming towards the face. That little error could give me pause in believing what you guys say after.

2. You base examples on static parts. You guys need to realize that the whole truck is moving, the hanger is moving left and right when carving, speed is not constant, there's a big wheel there that directs the incoming air, etc. All of this can affect, even for just a little, what all you guys are saying.

3. You guys have to realize where this design evolved from. It evolved from motors that are fully wrapped in urethane with no chance of heat leaving from the side:

![20180820_145649%20(2)|690x381](upload://ySo4V6DBST99SeIUVQkkCnGbnBG.jpg) 

To one that has a chance for the heat to come out from the side AND side-front:

![20181129_192044|690x388](upload://iopBK9dprfwMrDOdPXRG8twaD2W.jpeg) 

So, with that said, I'm an moving forward with my design regardless of what you guys say. You guys may have studied stuffs for 4+ years but I have been at this design for a while also. I think I know more about it than any of you guys. Oh by the way @PXSS, I would be wary about your very long wheel adapter, cause we've tried that and it broke off easily. What's my basis...years also of real life prototyping

Haha, this thing has veered way off course! :smile:

Okay guys, here's the plan. These are all info that I know all of you guys are asking about CARVON:

* We are going to produce in-house around 20 sets of CARVON ExoDrives (we're calling it ExoDrives now to avoid confusion) per week starting right now. This is aside from the 10 sets that we have already produced for this Group Buy. 

* 10 sets of those 20 sets will go towards building 10 EXO Pros for the Indiegogo Backers per week. The rest will go towards current retail sales of either the drive by itself or the complete board. 

* If you guys want to get on the Direct Drive bandwagon now, you can buy the ExoDrive now and you will get it after a week if you live in the continental USA. That is 100% guaranteed. I know it doesn't mean much considering all the delays, but this time, I'm the manufacturer and we're doing mass production. 

* This current GB will ship Monday. I want to anodize the new Wheel Adapters to black. I hate shiny things. The ExoDrive is also being offered for a limited time only, so you guys better get it before we really start concentrating on completes. 

* If you notice at our exoboards website, we also have the regular EXO which, as you may have noticed, is based on Meepo, Wowgo, etc. design. This will be our entry-level board that is meant to compete with those brands and will be made in China.

* Stay tuned for update on EVOs, which is a bit harder board to finish.

It is you that is wrongly assuming.  Of course there's air pressure coming from the front when youre going forward but it's not going to go in that hole no mater how much you carve or how big the wheel is or how fast you're going.    that's the point of contention and an interest of mine and I've done a lot of research, experimenting and modeling of different forced air cooling methods

Did a ride tonight here is the data.

https://metr.at/r/tOI4q

Fun. Lots of torque. Way better than
Previous setup. Did have a fault, my motor wire loosened. I Was able to fix and keep going with no damage to my vesc üëçüèº




Edit: did SF Bay Area group ride today 

https://metr.at/r/H8jpB

The carvon TDS are epic. I was 80-90% successful in converting EXO koowheel esc to focbox. I ran foc sensored and it ran smooth. I had issues going uphill, slow starting uphill cogging, and believe the sensors are culprit. I did notice heat from motors and hangar as expected with these drives.

Overall, they are a blast. I did use @pxss adapters as they fit my wheel snug. The rolling resistance allows for push if needed. My battery was draining quickly as I was in mode 3 Hoyt remote. I think these remotes kick ass and work well carvon Motors. Thanks @Sender fur putting that group buy together. 

Question, @LEVer with your adapters for TD, do you recommend cutting the sleeve like SDR and will your adapter for six shooters work?

Yes, I would recommend half-sleeve only if you're going to pair motors with VESC/Focbox/Unity. The motors get fed more amps so need help in cooling. Yes, the adapters for SixShooters only work with clone wheel adapters (those clone wheels with thick spokes), not with ABEC11 or Kegel-core adapters.

@dspx Yup, just got back home from riding with the guys at Ciclavia. They're still there but I gotta get back to work. :sweat_smile:

It takes enormous amount of time and dedication to make sure it's ready, all for you guys. There was no road map for me, no prior art on how to correctly do it. Then someone just literally grabs the thing you're working on and runs away with it. Unlike TB, I create my products personally, because I want to personally know if it works, so I'm very invested in it.

I know you guys are fuming at me because of the delays. But you guys cannot deny the fact that CARVON literally came up with something that is revolutionary. And we did it the right way. We did it the hard way. Because at the end of the day, it's not all about money, it's making sure the product is safe, reliable and still the best to ride.

That was our first design. But it did not cool as much. But I'm not stopping anyone from coming up with it. It's all about designing and testing.

But I do highly recommend putting urethane sleeve covers on the middle part where we put our urethane covers. That part of the motor gets snagged easily when going on uneven surfaces. If you leave it unprotected and only with metal showing, it can actually stop you and make you go flying forward. With a urethane cover, it acts like a hubmotor just spinning and rolling on and over the road hazard.

Thanks! I love this community, in real life! lol.

I go out and ride as much as I can with the group. Was recently at Ciclavia. Got knocked out in Vegas....haha! I was (and still is) with the veterans at the old endless sphere forum. Met a lot of wonderful people. Lost a kind and gentle soul...

RIP Derek...I miss you bro

@LEVer Sorry, I went direct drive man! It's not personal. I designed a hub motor setup first but ultimately couldn't go hub motor it was the wrong design IMO. I wish you all the luck and always have. You're always a friend in my book whether or not you care. :joy: Keep the passion alive man! Don't let it phase you.

Are the adapters that came on my v4 XL going to work then or do they not cool effectively? Are we able to send the old adapters in for replacement/exchange for the new ones?


I noticed you said the new adapters will fit a lot better too. Mine fit super loose(I know about the heat shrink, but we are talking about taking up a 2-3mm gap).

This is for ExoDrives, not SpeedDrive XL. I'm not sure if you got the SDXL version with full urethane or the one with the extended wheel adapter.

![20180730_221941|690x388](upload://ngDkQwLx3iHKJj64AFrwnZAKQGN.jpg) 

You probably have adapters for clone wheels. If you are using ABEC 11 Flywheels, I can replace the adapters you have for Flywheels.

Tracking info received and the package is en route! :clap:

I want to thank Jerry @LEVer for stepping up and gaining some control over the narrative, though there's still lots to clean up and promises to make right! Speaking from my own experience, backing CARVON was always a risk, and doubling down on this GroupBuy was yet another. Communication was severely lacking, and it was (and still is) disheartening to hear similar experiences from fellow backers. Without that communication, we can only conjecture and fume. I've done both, loudly and proudly. 

Within this past month, I have personally seen a change and a willingness in Jerry to correct his position.. and after a few conversations with him and Joe @joeadams101, my eyes opened to the stress and strains of Jerry's one-man operation; I don't envy the man, but I do have hopes for him and for his vision.

Things are ramping up in real-time, and if he can keep up the momentum (and stay out of useless spats on the internet :wink:) I'm confident the brand will turn around. I hope others will start to see the fruits of this long gamble. I want to be proud to ride a CARVON!

If you are really trying to right the ship like @dspx says then we should get an update. Even if it's just an update that says "it's not happening anymore and you are all out the money stop bothering me" so I know to stop expecting anything. I also tried the chat feature that you recommended and the person who answered it said they had no idea what's going on with those boards they said they would check an email me back and they didn't.

Now I Can proudly say I am a supporter. I was going to wait to Torque Direct Drive but ExoDrive is already on the market. Couldn't afford to lose this sweet opportunity. 
Quick question though, what about these wheels? Can I mount them ? What stock wheel adaptors come with the motor?

The sleeves were a pain to work with in general, it required a good amount of heat and elbow grease to take them off and reinstall.  Perhaps I was using the wrong tools and made my life oh so much more difficult but I do not envy the person who has to assemble these motors and install those sleeves.

Yea the Exo uses the Koowheel ESC, I'm just moving from 97mm ABEC 11 to 100mm Boas.  I haven't ridden it yet but I'm expecting a bit of a lost in torque so acceleration/braking will take a slight hit but I'm trading up for comfort, a wider contact patch, and higher top speed.  The Exo Pro had no problems driving the 97mm, the acceleration was already pretty damn amazing on those, I don't think the 100mm would make a huge difference.  I wouldn't recommend using the ESC with 107 ABEC 11's though, only a VESC can drive those.

I was apart of the group buy, and he just threw in the wheels I wasn‚Äôt expecting to get them. I don‚Äôt think he even sells them yet.

Looks like the motors came with MR30 connectors instead of the e-bike connectors(Skullboard connectors).  The easiest thing to do to make it work with a Unity is to cut off the connector and solder your own 3.5mm male bullet connectors for the phase wires, the sensor connector can go straight to the Unity if you have enough length.  If you want to get fancy you can also do a 3.5mm male bullet connector to MR30 female connector extension that connects the Unity to the motors.

Did he really just send you a set of direct drives with no bullet connectors and the expectation for you to self solder them on? ü§≠üòë

This is normal.  I got the Torque drives in a long while back which came with the e-bike connectors.  I had to solder my own 3.5mm connectors for the FOC Boxes _AND_ splice together the sensor cable connector to the ebike connector with non color matching wires.  What Kyle got is actually way easier to deal with on a soldering level.

Most people here know how to solder some phase wires.....

Yeah I'm kind of just pointing out that when you buy an electric skateboard product it would make sense for it to have the correct connectors. There's not really any way you could use those direct drives on a bike since they are mounted to the truck so having an ebike connector doesn't even make sense. Just buy a Torqueboards direct drive, comes with all the right connectors and you dont have to keep an eye on your paypal for non delivery.

The Torqueboard Direct Drives come with 5.5mm Bullet connectors.  The regular FOC boxes and Unity run 3.5mm connectors by default.  Any way you look at it, some soldering's gonna get done.

If you base the theory of building your board off of only two models of escs you are correct, however the unity already comes with bullet adapters because they thought ahead unlike the product that we're talking about.

But in both scenarios, at least one end is going to require some form of solder. And if Jerry decides that he wants to use the MR30's on his drives for future production boards, he deserves no more outrage in this instance the enertion does for choosing 3.5mm because their Raptor 2 uses 3.5mm.

I haven't soldered a thing to run Torqueboards direct drives, the average customer doesn't want to buy a product that they have to solder, maybe we do cuz we're on a DIY site, but that doesn't make it ideal for a market product.

You are clearly bias here. The TB direct drives come without the correct adapters for the unity anyway so they are literally in the exact same position. I assume these motors will have the MT30 connector as that is what the Carvon ESC uses with the Exoboard. 

You are on a DIY forum for DIY electric skateboards. My Hummie hubs came with no connectors at all and the original vescs I got I had to solder the correct connectors too. Not to mention there is not set standard for bullet sizing and it is abundantly clear that nobody can agree to which is best.

What a stupid comment to make.

If you want to buy products with the wrong connections that's your prerogative, I'm just pointing out that there's a bunch of kids on reddit who will order this and not know what to do with a product displaying the wrong connectors. Maybe a large chunk of your customers will be smart enough to figure that out, but if you consider a large base who come from a cheaper meepo, backfire, diyeboards background, these potential buyers would be scared off of a product that isn't plug and play or user friendly. Part of the reason I always liked Torqueboards products is that everything fits and connects easily (crazy concept, I know) it's the reason I sponsor the brand and loved their products from the start. If that's bias then call me bias, but an ebike connector as standard for a direct drive made specifically for esk8 is by far the dumbest thing I've heard today.

I use to be one of those folks on Reddit who didn't know jack shit about these drives and connectors.  But I ordered one determined to make it work and you know what? There's a shit ton of information on the internet and especially on this builders forum.  There's a community of people working together to solve the same problem and solutions are all well documented.  If you want to build something with the least amount of effort, sure you can order everything from one place where all the parts go easily together but you're severely limiting yourself in terms of options.  Those ebike connectors are the same connectors found on Boosted boards known for its waterproofing and ease in the disassembly/assembly process.

I agree that it should come with common connectors like 3.5 of 5.5mm bullets, but it's fairly easy to change them out. Listing what it comes with is a good idea too.

That really depends on your definiton of "wrong connectors" If Jerry is using the [Meepo ESC](https://www.meepoboard.com/us/accessories/esc/) for his boards, then again, he is no more wrong than Enertion doing so for his Raptor 2.

Let's step aside from the fact that no one should be ordering anything from Jerry right now. Jerry directly marketed the Drives on here , the forum , the DIY forum. Reddit on the other hand was marketed with the full indiegogo board. 

While my lazy ass is the biggest advocate for plug an play, anyone from reddit who decided to order the drives should know full well that they might have to get down and dirty form any DIY product so long as it is within operational boundaries. Is it messed up that Jerry didn't deliver 100% of the promised full product's description, **Yes**. Is the expectation from the vendor that the consumer might have to do some soldering in a DIY community wrong? **No**

Sure if you use TB parts, but unless I order Jlabs or LHB to do 4mm Bullets on my focboxes (I rather eat ass than use the TB VESC) some soldering is going to have to be done.

@moderators

Might be time to split the thread because I would advocate that ebike connectors are in many ways better than bullet connectors if were doing it boosted style. So long as it can deliver what it needs to, it's better looking, less parts to go wrong , and easier to swap.
