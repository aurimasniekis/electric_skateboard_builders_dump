Hi,I have a friend who is doing a small vinyl and customised deck business. I told him about esk8 and said there might be some people who would want it. He is a great artist and designer. Before he starts selling them he wants to know I found there isnâ€™t any want for them.
He would let you choose the board you would like for the custom deck.
If people want then he will upload some of his work and you can start buying. Lastly please also say what kind of price he could get for the decks and vinyls

Thank you very much

....

PLEASE ANSWER THE POLL BELOW HONESTLY

[poll type=regular results=on_vote]
* Yes I would be interested in buying as vinyl
* No I would not be interested in buying a vinyl
[/poll]

[poll name=poll2 type=regular results=on_vote]
* Yes I would be interested in buying a custom deck
* No I would not be interested in buying a custom deck
[/poll]

PLEASE VOTE

Just want to know if thereâ€™s is any interest in it at the moment

Think that the circumstance is that he is a good artist and he does a fair price (tell me what kind of amount is fair) then would you buy one

I more meant the quality of the deck. Then most people would pay around 50-100 for a vinyl that they pick design, color, and where the vinyl is (the price I noted is not including a custom deck)

Just a blank deck with a large vinyl sticker? 
Are you sealing the vinyl and adding grip? if so how?

Glass frit is the answer to custom decks but...... epoxy and vinyl don't work great together. 

![20190430_093540|375x500](upload://slqA9A5PS9nQb3Gu0PwZWku1q7X.jpeg) ![20190502_002900|375x500](upload://6szChTwh1oOT0dxkFksvx4N7ecl.jpeg) ![20190502_002839|375x500](upload://iCuXueMULHREETRsIUvaMoZSdI3.jpeg) 

The epoxy really needs to soak into the wood. Theres a few spots on mine that didn't seal into the wood so i have air pockets that will probably break at some point.  Cloth is better.

Its epoxy with bits of broken glass tossed in as it hardens. You can use different grades of glass as well as different colors.  You can hardly see mine because its clear glass.

I'm being real here. You come here checking for interest of a product, without pictures and without experience in this field. Saying your friend does the job... He doesn't have internet and can't make an account and post his previous work? That's just crazy lazy and snake oil. Then you ask the most basic question without searching for anything in the forum. We have more than 3k threads, there is a ton of priceless info here.

Your friend can not request money before product is made because he/you are not Level 3 member. 

And don't give the excuse that you're 14yo, there are young members here that understand how forum works. 

My advice: search before you ask, and if you need to ask, search again.

Sorry 

My friend asked if I could seek out any interest he will come on the forum once he starts 

He is not asking to be paid before work 

I understand you want pictures therefore I will give you some

I am trying to see what the best way to execute this for him would be as he has never done a skateboard before 

I am just trying to help him

Nice sticker :wink:

No I used some good adhesive. I also did relief Cuts anywhere I could hide them between colors and stickers in hopes of the epoxy would soak through. And the majority of my stickers weren't actually vinyl but paper and still the results aren't going to last. 
I think if the stickers were laid down as the epoxy was drying rather than before the epoxy was applied the results might be better

I don't even have a thread dedicated to selling what I do for decks and I get people coming to me all the time.


Do something before you sell something. Even for a friend.


Here are some examples of MY WORK...  not cheap, and I don't want to write you a how to... 

Try better next time.

If he is that good, tell him to do some stuff first. If it is quality shit, people will want it. If it is not, they won't. 

Also,  do not buy some shit decks and scribble on them and try to sell it.

Another tip, start with a tried and true deck that people are already using for esk8 and has enclosures readily available. 


@venom121212 i did the epoxy and frit on skunks deck.  It really needs to be fabric of some kind to saturate if you want it to really last. Still cool though.

This thread is weird @Halbj613. My gut tells me you're just a kid and don't how a sale works or how to attract business. If you want interest in a product, you need to show the product. Or at least some type of work that applies from the artist to either show skill, quality, ect... So far you've done none of the sort. I'm going to speak for EVERYONE here and say there is absolutely no interest in a product that doesn't even exist. This is vaporware as it is so far.

Lets see some pics already. ;)

@Skunk I don't even think placing the decals in the b cure stage would help a ton.

It would help the decals lifting off the deck, but bubbles through use will still occur above the decal between it and the top layer of epoxy/resin.

The answer is doing the desing work in photoshop and then getting it printed to fabric and then skinning that to the deck.
