Hi Sally,

That looks like a good design! Do you have specifics on the features? I'm assuming the skateboard battery indicator and LED toggle don't work for DIY.

@winboard-sally does the remote come with a receiver ? Or does it pair with your esc only. 

If its your esc only. I suggest making a stand alone version with a micro ppm receiver and the LEDs on the side be the battery indicator for the remote (instead of the skateboard) 

I'm sure I'm not the only one here that would like a thumb wheel style remote, as the thumb lever remotes available like the nano remote and nano-x (winning recasings) are clunky at best...(the injection molds are cheap)

I don't think that it will come with a separate receiver as this is sold as a package. The first ebay offer displays the remote only. I assume this is nothing else than a replacement remote and hence useless for people who want to pair the thing with e.g. a VESC.

Can you clarify this being for "builders" 
What exactly can it be used with other than your 18A ESC?

Its probably 18A per motor, its not that bad.
At nominal voltage:
18A x 36V = 648W x 2 = 1296W
25A x 36V = 900W x 2 = 1800W

I agree mustang sally did not have this important clarity written into her canned sales pitch

Hey sally is this remote using a magnet/hall sensor or potentiometer?

## \#24 Posted by: Schulerbible Posted at: 2017-10-22T01:35:12.586Z Reads: 220

```
In case the remote is similar to the one which came with the H2 board then it may look like this inside. Note, the plastic bits as well the hall sensor arrangement are near identical to the parts inside Boosted remote. Did feel a bit lighter than the Boosted but certainly of higher quality compared to the Nano-X.

Interesting post... though that's why you firstly always use PayPal. Now I myself hold a serious amount of scepticism and criticism against Chinese manufacturers, given they're the reason for my high blood pressure...

I believe your story, however this is exactly what happens when you try and buy a one-off unit from a manufacturer who's M.O. is all about selling on an OEM level. You simply didn't meet their threshold of MOQ for them to take you seriously, and this is exactly what happens. Sorry to hear about the loss, but this is partly your fault for placing that much trust in the Chinese.

[quote="flint, post:29, topic:36016"]
p.s it is not my fault placing trust in Chinese, it was simply a purchase every one makes from time to time
[/quote]

Nobody shops single items on alibaba from "time to time". Alibaba has always been, and always will be a B2B platform.

[quote="flint, post:29, topic:36016"]
Alibaba suppose to be safe and i was guaranteed a refund
[/quote]

Alibaba is definitely not a safe platform for purchases, any platform that allows anyone with a half-baked company name to sell is risky and prone to have middlemen and cons

[quote="flint, post:29, topic:36016"]
Chinese manufacture are only good at mass production
[/quote]

Well you just answered the reason you got burned.[quote="flint, post:29, topic:36016"]
Paypal will not get your money back unless it was not delivered to your country, your credit card or bank card will, last resort small claims court.
[/quote]

PayPal ALWAYS protects the buyer, even if the buyer makes a fraudulent claim (common bane of eBay sellers). That is unless you made a 'Family & friends' transaction in which I have no sympathy for you if you did.

Flagging my posts for cheap censorship does not prove any point other than not being able to take criticism. You want to talk? Or do you want to cry? The information I posted is rather matter-of-the-fact and tells the cold-hard truth. You want to deal with the Chinese? Then prepare to come out losing something. You're acting like Alibaba is a safe transaction site, which any company lead here can tell you is in fact a minefield to navigate.

Flint, nice to meet you, I am Sally, nobody robbed your skateboard spare parts. We send you a whole board, weight 12KG ( this is the real weight for a whole eboard, and you can see from tracking status), BUT, you told me spare parts missing when you received it. It is so strange! :rage:

OK, let's start...
You told me battery, motors, remote control, wheels ....are all missing. Point is REMOTE CONTROL. This is what you received in the picture, you said no remote control: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/5/4546ea8b182ca14a1fb21c1392c3d9ce6f3a1c8d.jpg" width="550" height="309">

BUT in your front page, there is one remote control from us, is this your skateboard? where is the remote from? And I still can recognize that wheels are also from us. This is **Winboard GT-M6 carbon fiber**.
