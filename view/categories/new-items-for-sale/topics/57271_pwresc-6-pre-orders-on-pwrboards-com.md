Full Retial (not pre-order) Price of ‚Ç¨389.00... 

What advantage does it have over [Trampas](http://www.trampaboards.com/vesc-6-complete--vedder-electronic-speed-controller-trampa-exclusive-p-24166.html)?

Edit: see the price change, I think that's fair , especially if your purpose is achieve faster shipping of these. Beware though that none of these has been tested by the community and as such has very little faith in whether or not its crap. 

Your rep would go up if you yourself showed some real world testing

The wild response probably came due to the fact that there's an ongoing discussion in another thread about this esc, about the design flaws and if it's even worth buying @124 usd (group buy price) as it's yet untested. 

That's where you appear with this thread selling the same esc (initially) for 289 eur, still untested, still with the same design flaws. 

Didn't want to be mean, but you set the table.... üòÇüòÇ

Thank you for your feedback.

In the future we will also sell these without the case. They will be better for dual drive setups.

We will get a few in stock for testing very soon. Then we will update you on the reliability. 
We have also seen some tests from Flipsky, which looks promising. It is not tested in extreme conditions and on many different setups though...

So, you are asking people to pay for a product that's not made yet, and is not tested by the community, and may or may not be good.  The last time that happened it was a flop with the BBox because the quality was very low.  How about if we pay after it's made and after folks have been given some to test?

What is your refund policy?  How about a promise to pay after it's delivered and after it has survived 30 days?

I of course hope that these speed controllers are going to be great. For what we have seen, they will be. Of course we can't know for sure until they have been tested in depth, but that's how it is with new products.
If they turn out to be crab, we of course will deal with it. We will of course accept returns and give the money back if they are faulty. Of course we will.

I guess it comes from a humorous place.
First since this product has been discussed and testing is happening by a few people.
Secondly, it is not really a Vesc6 or Wesc6 components and build wise. But more informed vesc wizards can go deeper here.
Thirdly since that product was 130.- for a group buy and 179.-$ for a single piece from their website. 

So an untested product that seems flawed build wise ( talked in depth in other threads) for initially 289 Euro equals 336,85 US Dollar instead of 179, seemed super fishy at best. 

It is very rarely we condemn products and people peddling them. This is a constructive forum. Critique will happen.

Thank you for your post. I will read up on the other threads then. 
I of course support the ability to give constructive feedback. Otherwise you wouldn't know what to believe, and what not to...
From my perspective, we have been promised a VESC 6 from Flipsky. That is what I am imagining I am getting. If not, we will have to find a solution where everyone is going to be taken care of.

Good to see more competition on the VESC 6 market, even if it's only a re-brand...

I think you might get into trouble with the name "WESC", due to what's called "phonetic similarity" in trademark law. Not 100% sure if this is correct, but better check it out. If you need to change the name, better change it now than after you sold some, and then have to re-brand again.

I agree with you on the warranty issue, but as that warranty is the same that the Chinese manufacturer is offering, and this company, based in Europe, is selling that Chinese product with its warranty, wouldn't whether it's honored or not still go back to the manufacturer?  Like I don't see this company buying a bunch of extra stock in case they need to fulfill the warranty themselves.  I would think if a warranty issue came up, they would have to deal with flipsky as well.  That would be my main concern with that argument...

The difference is that one is legally obligated to provide warranty while the other can easily say "water damage" in the case that you're an annoying customer or simply don't want to help you and have no repercussions.

Sadly the way you make business is like most sellers make business.
Some of them showed that they have no glue by wrong statements and accidently dropped their pants. But in your case it looks like you came already naked.

Thank you for all the feedback guys. 
I understand that some of you is skeptical. I understand that. Hopefully we can prove that the product will be as promising as we hope. No matter what, I think it is worth a try. The price is a totally different one from the current market price. It might not perform as great as Trampa's. We will see. 
We will get back to you when we have got some more test results. 
I also think we will cancel the preorder for now until we have proven it to be a good product. 

Thank you again for the comments.

That is actually true. From a good source I heard a VW Golf doesn't cost more than 3000‚Ç¨ in material. Doesn't matter which engine or features. That is the reason they don't want to build electric cars where the battery alone costs them 10000‚Ç¨.

imo batteries are still to expensive for anything basically

compared to gas prices buying an EV is not worth it maybe in a long term like 15+ years but in the developed countries who owns the same car so long?

Literally anything you buy its marked up at least 100%. This is how business works: you pay for the service the business man offers.
If you dont like this tradeoff its totally fine, but then you should't buy groceries and clothes either.
The problem here is that the manufacturer hasn't dealt well with distributors pricing.
BTW I'd be surprised if a focbox costs more than 45/50$ to make.

Feel free to shoot this argument down but: 

The esk8.de ESC says it's based on the VESC 4.12 hardware, this one @OskarCastrone offered was supposed to be based on the VESC 6?

I don't understand why everyone is bashing at him for trying to launch a new product. 

He's taking a risk, developing a new product which currently only exists with one vendor in the EU (Trampa that I know of).
The fact that the cost of the materials in the BOM is X does not mean it is reasonable to charge the same amount when selling it as people said. 

and also what @Jc06505n said

I am not bashing anyone just trying to inform people that.

He isn't developing a new product. This product is made by flipsky

Compare it to the specs then :slight_smile:

esk8.de

* Current: Up to 240A for a couple of seconds or about 50A continuous depending on the temperature and air circulation around the PCB.
* 60A continuous current, up to 240A (for some seconds)
* 68mm x 72 x 20mm.

Now this makes more sense :slight_smile:
Comparing specs regardless of VESC base that is. 
I'm actually waiting for a couple of ESCs from esk8.de currently. 

I'm not trying to say one is better than the other.
I was just trying to point out the fact that it can be good to get more players in the market. Putting a new product out there is not cheap, regardless if you are developing it, buying it from Flipsky or Alibaba or wherever in bulk and people always scream and shout as soon as there is a product that is in a price category we think is unreasonable. 


Aaaanyhow, sorry for rambling, that's just my 2 cents!

In my opinion these specs are not to be trusted since you can read similar specs on regular V4.12.

I think there is a group of people that want a reasonable cheap version of the V6 because of the reliability problems (burning the drv chip etc) if v4.12 since V6 uses another drv chip. Also the m√°ximum  voltage is increased.

It's great to have many options, eu supliers etc but rebranding the products adds a bit of confusion.

To be fair, the specs has nothing to do with the reliability of the hardware. Comparing specs of 4.x and 6 feels very inrrelevant. I can say that I've changed more DRVs than i can remember on the 4.x and 0 on the 6. 
None the less, nice to see more players making interrations of the VESC 6. Best of luck!

And I still dont get this resilence to the TM. You're making money of something you didint invent, for free. Just change the name. Sounds like a fairly nice deal..

Well, as I understand it (and I am by no means an expert), the VESC is trademarked by Trampa for Benjamin Vedder, meaning that noone else can sell their products under that name, even if it is based on the same open source code. 

That means if what you say is to happen, everyone must agree on a new name and deal with what comes with that.

Flipsky already had a name for it, namely FSESC6.6. 
Pwrboards decided to give it yet another name, which makes it harder for customers to trace back the origin of the product and compare the pricing with other vendors, etc.

Same thing that happens with the countless of motor rebrands you see.

So why would I want a v6 based controller?
Primarily: no erpm limit & increased ampacity.

How has this happened (as far as I understand), with a new control chip, more efficient pcb layout to deal with heat, a heatsink and directfets. A v4 BOM can have much of this upgraded. Lets call these v5 for arguments sake, these would be Ollin or focbox for example...

Jenso has pushed a VESC v6 as hard as anyone, something around 130 BA, 150 MA & 190 AC... but he also runs a extra heatsink and is not climbing Mont Blanc. 80A cont. sould be reliable stock. No v4 can do that.

Hi @Cobber ... we've been doing some testing as we are looking at incorporating the VESC into our new product. The amps quoted are only half the story. We found that 48v / 30a constant will get a V4.12 board with no heat sink and no airflow at room temp to 100 degrees in 5 minutes. It then isn't' much use until it cools down. It may run constant at 1/2 what we tested. In Benjamin's video where he tests constant amps for the V4.12 and it's at 34a which he says it can do all day. That's correct, but only at a much lower voltage it seems. I recall he is using 21v in that video. We've tested Maytech's new VESC 4.12 also with the heat sink which takes 10 minutes to get to the same point. I am not sure if there are modifications in addition to the heatsink, or it's just the heatsink that doubles the time. We are testing a V6 soon and hope that this can meet our spec which requires 48v and 30 amps constant with no airflow. It does not appear the V4.12 can do this. I can share results from out testing once it's completed. Cheers

@cobber ...  it's not easy to work this out from the forums. Amps are quoted continually, but it depends on your system. Using watts would be a lot more accurate ... unless every system uses the same V but it doesn't look like that's the case. Cheers

Yeah there should be a standard. Like our (V)esc can handle X amps for 5 mins before thermal throttling. 

But then there is also the mounting conditions. 
a. No airflow
b. Heat sink no airflow
c. Heat sink with airflow

I agree. There is if you buy motors. Controllers too most of the time. You need torque curves and real data. The VESC is awesome, and we really want to make it work for us as it's got some great functionality and the package is incredibly small. It's a challenge due to inconsistency in the builds between vendors, and incomplete (or extremely vague) performance data. It seems it's not amps that need to be measured it's Watts. We probably missed early on the fact that most of the quoted amps are on much lower voltage. You can pick it up, but not easily. Eg: in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL1wXB8DbY) if you watch the temperature as the system is thrashed it gets up to max temperature in a few minutes then the video stops and starts again. This is the type of load these controllers will be under. Every vendor selling VESCs should be able to give detailed curves based on a variety of conditions (as you point out) and different Voltage systems. When we are finished testing, we should be able to share our data which might help, but the solution is that each company / person selling VESCs needs to lab test them with conditioned power and monitoring. 

We also found that the VESC monitoring output was not consistent. Eg: same conditioned power going in (48V / 30a) one VESC 4.12 said 25a and the other said 34a in the usb connected VESC software. I can't speak to the reason for this. It might be not following the BoM, it might be firmware differences, it might be other changes the manufacturers made on the PCBs, it might be shortcuts taken ... it might be a bigger problem. It certainly points to the need for independent monitoring by VESC manufacturers to validate the performance. As consumers, it's not unreasonable for you to expect this type of information when you are buying components. It's probably different for the companies selling complete boards as they only need to make sure that _their_ system works. Cheers

You should ask @trampa about that. He always has great excuses when it comes to why you shouldn‚Äôt call a showel for a showel. This confusion is all made by him trying to make more money saying he‚Äôs the only one selling vesc6. I think everyone should be able to call it vesc6 and then some kind of label to show who made it then people would know what they buy.
