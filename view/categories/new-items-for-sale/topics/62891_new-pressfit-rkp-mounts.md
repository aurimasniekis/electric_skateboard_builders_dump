They are here! And a set is already on the way to @PatRocks 

They fit: 176mm and 200mm hangers.
Plates can be mounted inside or outside the flange.
I have 66mm plates and 80mm plates for those interested.
-Both plate sizes can be reverse mounted with up to 65mm length motors. 74mm and longer will need the 80s for reverse mounting.![rkp%20mount%201|666x500](upload://6S5Dy6onh9tJrmA8GT6iINEAROE.jpg)

They are up on my site.

The old ones were 71mm, right? So 66, 71 and 80 have been made, and you have 66 and 80 in stock?

What are the benefits of different plate sizes? Depends on the pulleys used?

For sheer trickery, the 66's are 71mm center to center.

So there are only 2 choices.

The bigger plate can move your motors further away from the base plates. Giving you room for longer motors. which have a tendency to get too close to everything around them. 

Read the description on my site. There are "details" in the words.
