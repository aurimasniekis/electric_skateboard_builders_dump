I bought this from alibaba, but it's just a little too thick for my sunkko welder to make good welds. I cut off a small piece and put it in some salt water, ill post another pic tomorrow morning after its sat all night. 

Selling the whole thing for $70-75 depending on where you are in the USA. I'll be shipping it out of California.

@banjaxxed I would like to sell the whole thing at once if at all possible. @willpark16 sent me a PM and seems like he is willing to buy the whole roll. I'll keep this post updated.

Sounds good. Willpark16 can't get it for another week he says. I'd like to get it out asap so I can buy some other parts. Let me know I can ship it out tomorrow morning. Less than $75 shipped to anywhere in USA.

Still in the saltwater, no rust. It's legit. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/a/1a7d92fa31e594c62b19ac1c9be72402f7934952.jpg" width="374" height="500">

Sunkko 788H does the .2mm just fine, btw.

That's good to hear. Is that with the box mounted probes? 

The 709A must just be weaker :/ Which sucks because when I was buying it i totally thought it would be stronger than the 788. The 788 was cheaper too
