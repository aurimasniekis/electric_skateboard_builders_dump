Added information regarding amp rating, setup and general handling.
Btw, seems like someone bought nearly all the  DirectFets available on the market. Rs components had like 3000 ready to ship 4 days ago and now not a single one in stock, same for mouser and farnell. Only arrow has around 200 pcs left but their shipping (DAP) would hit me with massive import fees lol.
Everyone who ordered a DirectFet switch till now got one, anyway I'm currently thinking through options on how to proceed.

Edit: 3 way Directfet will come/is already here.. just not the fets :joy:

Sorry regarding the heatshrink, it's  40mm, transparent and has a shrink ratio of 1:2 which I use for all models except the single versions.

Hi,
[quote="fraannk, post:39, topic:31872"]
Is there a reason why there's no fuse on these?
[/quote]

Yes, most switches are rated for higher than 40 amp and there is no fuse in ATO format that has a higher amp rating than 40A so the switch would get bigger because of a big fuse and many people just bridge the fuse pads with a wire anyway. I personally don't use fuses because I don't want them to blow at the wrong moment. Everybody who wants to use a fuse can get an inline fuse.

[quote="fraannk, post:39, topic:31872"]
And what happens when you turn off the switch while the wheels are spinning?
[/quote]

Voltage spikes will appear but the switch won't fail because of that, so don't worry, it's not critical but should be avoided.

[quote="fraannk, post:39, topic:31872"]
Is it possible to push the board when it's off without damaging anything?
[/quote]

If you push your electric board, you will produce energy that has to go somewhere. Your Vesc could get switched on or blown up. It's recommended to have your batteries connected so the generated energy will charge them and therefore the antispark switch needs to be switched on to let the current through.

**Useable till Wednesday September 20th 2017**
Btw, nobody ordered this one yet so I'm safe from drama haha :sweat_smile:

@Vanarian Yes I made a beta version before, but it hasn't the additional protective mosfet onboard, still works great tho. If you want this beta version just msg me.

Btw I'm moving to a new city within the upcoming days, every order till now will be shipped on monday (post office closed on WE), production and shipping will start again on Wednesday, September 20th.

[quote="NAF, post:52, topic:31872"]

@NAF They aren't as good as the directfets (higher rdson and d2pak housing etc.) The mosfets itselves don't usually cause the fail of the whole switch, it's rather the non existing or insufficient onboard protection.

I am definitely interested... I guess this would be the cheaper/more resilient alternative to torqueboards $60 push on/off.

One question dude, I realize those push on/off button are only like $2 on ebay, but can't you just make it an option to get that with each antispark unit on your site?

Otherwise I got to wait for some other part from China/HK to get here in some time frame that's like a month away. That is the worst part of this hobby... endlessly waiting for packages.

 

EDIT:  Just placed my order, does it come with the 5-pin LED cable? Please link to a connector that works to connect to a latching LED on/off.  I assume it's a generic cable but I prefer you link me one. Thanks.

It comes with the 5 pin led cable, (also mentioned in the description of the product btw). Your order has been shipped today morning and you should have received the trackingcode (paypal email)

@Vieo Yea I have actually 5 pairs of each next to me  

The reason I hesitate a bit with offering a complete plug and play switch is that I want it to be a kit/module, otherwise very far-reaching regulations apply that I want to avoid.

One thing I forgot to ask before ordering is about the wires but yes, they are silicone, though and flexible. You should put that in the product description @goldenHusky.

Oh, and one tip about the pre-soldered wires, leave the other end insulated OR pre-tin the wire. Tinning the wire nicely is much easier and cleaner to do when the strands are still inside, insulated and pressed by the silicone :)

Good move, also if you include a picture like the one torqueboards antispark with the on/off button connected to the LED cable -- it will let any starter builder or random googler find out what exactly you are selling. (5) months ago when I got into this hobby i would have no clue what an antispark was or why somebody makes an ugly pull loop for an antispark, etc.  But If I had seen a picture like this.. I would have more easily sorted out in my noob mind "oh an antispark is a electricity control unit and I can use it like a cool on/off button".  Other than torqueboards AS with button... I have yet to find an off/on button combo until you came along.

Added XT60, XT90 and a led switch to my shop as "coming soon", they will be ready to order in 1-2 weeks.
Currently evaluating a reasonable price and writing the descriptions.

surely AS150 is the way to go with the 160A rating? :smiling_imp:

Although I'm hard wiring everything or using LMT 400A bullets. Have many people put big current through these yet? I was just going to use the factory anti-spark on my ESC's but two of these could handle my predicted current loads?

Ive blown 3 or 4 of his orginal design. Even those seem to hold up well agaisnt 120A of current until I start start doing back to back 45+mph top speed runs where im pulling over 100A for like 30secs. 

I just installed his 6 direct fet version and it seems to be holding well. Ill let you know if Im able to over heat one.

@goldenHusky Can you think of any issues with using these switches with a 19mm LED button rather than the 16mm? The wires are thicker with my 19mm, but as long as it's a single LED inside I imagine it would be fine.

Honestly I don't think that would be very useful, the whole pcb would get bigger because of the 7-digit displays + the control circuit behind it and you would have to open your enclosure to check voltage.. the best option is to connect a external 2$ voltmeter after the antispark and probably cut a hole in the deck to put it through :sweat_smile:

Thanks!
You basically need to set the "C" pin to high or low. High should be at least around 20V (equals 6s input voltage) to make it work because there's a 12V zener diode on it. You could use a small N-channel logic level mosfet and a resistor with a high value to make it work.

Edit: Don't forget the 1MOhm current limiting resistor in series with the zener.

@Eboosted 
16mm is the standard diameter for switches used in esk8s, at least what I've seen so far. 
Look for a latching 16mm led switch that has a 1NO1NC pin configuration, I have no real recommendation, I always try to find a balance between price and delivery time so it depends where I order.

Be careful to not touch negative wires with negative wire before the switch.

@Hanok
There have been tests with lower current. In my opinion and the opinion of friends with electrical engineering background we considered it as okay. 

However I agree that this value is probably too high. I have changed the description and will refund you if you want to return the switch. Only very few people have bought that one till now and I will also message them.

@Kug3lis
Yea right, P-channewould be very impractical for high current applications simply because they generally have a far higher Rdson due to the prodcution process.

- each mosfet has its own heatsink
- oscillation and transient protection (new)
- onboard led circuit for a 12V led (just like the old ones)
- size 50mm x 80mm (1,96" x 3,14")

A big **thank you** to everybody who supported me in the past and made this possible!

I highly doubt that you push more than 60A cont. even hillclimbing on a mountainboard. Just bypass the 60A Fuse an you should be good to go.

@bevilacqua If people want equipment that runs more than 60A continuous, it doesn't even matter how many amps they are running.  That's the equipment they want.  End of story.  I happen to want higher ratings than that as well.  I'd rather get something rated for triple what I need -- then have zero worries if it will fail under ANY amount of abuse, now or in the future, and even when it's old and worn-out.  Because it's not worth being late to work over.

But frankly, **why** isn't even relevant.  If that's what he wants, you arguing with him is silly.

@Windtigertim  Since the business is purely hobby, I disabled my shop intentionally because uni is very time consuming right now and I can’t spare time to make switches at the moment. I will enable orders in 2 weeks when all the exams are done. I hope you'll understand that. Thanks!

The website is up again with a "new" switch (one component was removed, fuse added and mosfets changed)
It has the typical JST plug as connector to the led switch, a 40A fuse and once more even higher voltage mosfets :slight_smile:

Hey man, Im in need of a switch that can handle a 12s6p 30q battery in a 4WD build, So 120A or something close to it continuous, could you maybe beef up the 60A version or something?

Hey, I'm fairly certain that my 60A switch will also handle your amp requirements very well. The switch has a limit of 60A because my testing equipment can't deliver more current.

Well let me suggest a deal: If you decide to order one, I'll agree to cover the return shipping costs if the switch turns out to not be sufficient, you can install it inside your board and test it intensively of course.

I'm sure that it would need to have some type of cooling to handle those amps like the fat boy switch has
Thats a good deal, I need to check with the guy who im building the battery for if he will agree to this :)

Hi @SoloSpaceMonkey
it’s down intentionally, comeback unknown, do you need a schematic or something?
Best

[quote="goldenHusky, post:253, topic:15639, full:true"]
@Vanarian Yes, I feel like the market is saturated, further many people decided to offer antisparks lately. In my opinion it’s better to pay 20$ more for the BMS or ESC and have it integrated on it then. Cheaper, more compact, less likely to fail… so yeah.

No! This can't be happening. I've been waiting for the site to come back from maintenance for over a month and now he's not selling anymore??

Where can i buy a similar switch with good quality? The one i got from eskating.eu was really bad quality...

There’s Loop Keys but they don’t have to just be on the enclosure, they could be on top of the deck , if you have a drop down , on top of the trucks as a seamless fit ( I have to find the guy who did it like that), and then there’s @Deckoz’s solution , and then @OllinBoardCompany’s & @chaka’s solution.

@StefanMe  Yes, temporarily until I have time and fresh products to continue it.
For this period of time I canceled my premium subscription of the shopsoftware so the website can not be found under the custom domain anymore, now a "bigcartel" phrase is within the adress like this https://antisparkheaven.bigcartel.com

Once I continue, I will announce it here for sure!

You got me haha :sweat_smile:

The main improvement is the two separated power circuits, one to charge up the capacitors of the ESC via high performance resistors and one to carry the load current, this way the main mosfets do not get stressed because of the inrush current and therefore the main reason for failure is eliminated.

So you could say it's an automated XT60-S connector.

How thick is it ? I knew it was a good idea to let the other one go haha 💪🏽 welcome back ! 64x39 footprint, ok.

Which main FETs are inside ? Still ok to apply fat heatsink on the back ?

How much load is needed (button side) to switch in ON/High state ?

Thanks! :) It's about 16mm thick, so under the diameter of a 18650 cell, I have a few different mosfets here right now, IRFS7530, IRFS7730 and IRFS4010. I've made some with the 4010 now.
A big one-piece-heatsink at the back is problematic because it would probably touch and short the copper.

The button simply connects the battery to the mpu of the switch so there is no required load if I understand your question correctly.

Not sure if it's doable (really a random idea) but maybe a derived source from battery cables (ESC side + a step down so it works only when ) with something like a Zener diode + a shunt to redirect thresold voltage and a lil chip to monitore voltage level (so it registers and works at any battery voltage level) all wired to positive side of the button switch....

This should do the trick to turn ON the thing no ? Easier said than done tho 🍻

Ok got it. But I still want to plug a soft-latch press ON / hold OFF button to your module so now there's no more minimal load to provide on the module side ? Just sort out the soft latch on my side and that's it ?

@goldenHusky so even using just two IRFS7530 you can do 100A? Asking since I use the original vedder switch and thought that it would only handle 40A tops

I would too, until I looked at this circuit.  With the non-momentary switch, he's gotten this down to ***zero microamps*** while turned off.  That means it won't kill the battery over extended times of non-use.  I kind-of like the way he did this.

You'd just have to ensure whatever switch you use is **robust** and won't rattle loose.
