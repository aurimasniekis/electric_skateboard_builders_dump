UPDATED

Sold most of the items originally posted, but still have the dual ESCape's from @stewii with Dual Enclosure from @LukePL ($325), DieBieBMS from @Samau18 ($120), 12s4p NESE Modules from @agniusm (paid $180, but make an offer, I think $120 is fair), and 2 TB 6380's 170kv (Silver) ($135 each, I'll do $260 for both).  All items 100% new and UNUSED. 

Make an offer.  I will sell at a slight discount, but don't lowball please.

The ESCape's alone were 245Â£ including shipping, which at the time converted to $325USD (the current exchange rate would be $312, but given the rarity of this item and that it is new, I'm still asking the same price I paid for it) and includes the dual case.

I'm not in a rush to sell, but I would prefer to do this quickly.  Please DM if you have any questions, or wish to make an offer.

Protip: to get those out of the wheels, put a bolt on the pin and lightly tap each pin from the outside of the wheel, with the edges of the wheel on blocks so the pulley is not on the bottom

You'll never be able to just pull them out ;-P

I have a pair of these aluminum pulleys for Kegel cores and are 40T.

![Screenshot_20190413-165045_Chrome|690x418](upload://iluddWMYXNxG86N75pGznTOom3I.jpeg) 

https://shop.3dservisas.eu/collections/fatboy-pulleys/products/fatboy-wheel-pulley-set-for-kegel-44t-40t-36t

After shipping they came out to â‚¬98, which is $110USD.  I have only fitted them to my 100mm Boas, but they have not been used.  The fit was kinda tight so I had to use a rubber mallet to get them in, so there is just the slightest bit of wear that shows, but all in all, they are essentially brand new.

I'd also be willing to sell the Boas with them ($120), as well as the TB 218 trucks I have them on ($65).  All of these items have never been used.  This adds up to $295, but if you get everything I'd do $275.

DM if interested!

Not a scratch on them, have not ridden them once, they are perfect.  Paid $120 plus shipping.  They are currently out of stock also, so here's your chance to get a fresh set of some of the newest and best urethane wheels currently made.  $110 shipped (in the US; though I will ship internationally if the cost of shipping is helped with).

Hey guys!  So I've sold the Metr Pro, Anti-spark, TB trucks, boas, and the pulleys.  I still have the two ESCape's with enclosures, both the double enclosure, and two singles, depending on how you wish to set it up. Though I am pretty sure I've got someone who is going to get the two single ESCape enclosures, so most likely I'll have now the two ESCape's in the double enclosure, the DieBieBMS,  and I also have two brand new silver TB 6380's.  I paid $135 each for them.  Would do $125 each.  Please don't lowball on the ESCape's either.  I'm in no rush to sell them, and after talking with another forum member, he said the ESCape's are so rare they're like unicorns, lol.  I paid Â£240, which is approximately $325. I think given they are completely brand new and unused, plus they have that badass dual enclosure with the fins on the bottom, so you can mount this with the bottom exposed for much better cooling!

I was just going through some of my gear which reminded me of another item I have that I think is a great design and design.

I bought from @agniusm everything needed for the NESE Modules. I don't remember right now how much I paid exactly, but it was around $180 with shipping.   These would go absolutely perfect along with the DieBieBMS I purchased, since @agniusm also makes a perfect fitting, identically shaped and sized enclosure, so not only is it a great product, but it would make the entire battery pack with BMS match exactly, so unlike many of the other battery packs that are nice and rectangular, until they get to the BMS which when shrink wrapped is applied, it leaves that side if the battery to not match at all. 

Ok, back on topic, lol. I have six of the modules, which are double sided (I had to ask @agniusm several times if he could do this, and it's great because it literally cuts the amount of modules needed in half), which allows me to make a 12s4p battery pack using  just six modules.  Five of them would be 4p+4p, while the sixth, would be a 2s4p. With the dual sided design all you need to do is have four cells facing one directing, the same fit the other four cells, but just have the posative or negative ends opposite.  Then, it's really easy... Take all but one of the copper bus bars out and cut them in the very center, and then cut off a little bit more so they don't accidently touch while your riding and short things out.  The last module, do the same to one of the bus bars, but keep the other one said.  This way you can run 4p up one side, and then once it gets to the middle with the uncut bus bar you basically make a U-Turn, so to speak, and then you just run the rest of your cells in the opposite direction.  Voila!  Also, one of the best things about these, is since they aren't spot welder together, you are actually able to travel on a plane with these, where as, I believe the only size of a battery pack allowed on a plane that is welded together has to be like 99W/hr.  So these are a huge convenience of you want to travel with your full Esk8.  Not like mail it to your destination, it just buy a new battery for each place you'll go. 

Once again, I'll check my order history, but if I recall correctly, it was about $100 - $120 for the modules.  Then you have to buy separately the series tabs that connect the middle, along with tab covers, and a few other things.  The cost of the parts I think was around $160, but then shipping internationally was like an additional $20.

If interested, shoot me DM with an offer. 

Here is a diagram I made to illustrate how this design works.

Not saying your price is wrong cause I think brand new from stewii they were like $160ish but maybe you haven't sold the ESCapes because there was another person who was selling them for cheaper however they didn't have the dual enclosure.  But I think one set was not used because they never built the board.  I'm sure you will sell them just have to wait for someone to come along or @pixelsilva to look at them long enough.

No I found the invoice for them and they were for exactly Â£240, which when I Google the conversion rate, equals approximately $325.  They were like just under $170 a piece including the enclosure.  Also I've really only had them listed for like 3 days.  I haven't seen anyone else selling any of these in a very long time, let alone one that is 100% new/unused.

It was recently brought to my attention by @briman05 that the current conversion rate from GBP to USD with Â£240  is actually $312, not $325.  However, I still intend to keep the price at $325, because even if the conversion has it listed for less, I still intend to list it for $325 USD, as that's exactly the price I paid.  Additionally, I don't think shipping was covered.

No no not that at all.  Honestly I'm hoping the last things I have left, including your module's don't sell.  I basically had a financial emergency come up, and it was all I could do to avoid a much bigger financial disaster from going down.

That's pretty much settled though, so I'm about to take those off market.  That reminds me.  I never got a DieBieBMS module from you.  What would that cost me? 

Also, the things I did get rid of, I eventually wanted to replace anyway, so, I may have lost some in the sale, but in the end I'll end up with the parts that I really want!  I appreciate you y checking in with me though.  I've been meaning to ask how your business is going???  I hope things are picking up my friend! 

Cheers, 

Uriah

Good stuff then. I'm alright, as with everyone, ups and downs, you know. Getting ready to launch 21700 in summer.
Diebiems enclosure is in the shop if you'd like to check.
Hopefully hard times are behind for you ;)

You are doing 21700's coming up!?  Oh man.... I will definitely want a set for you sure!  Will the design be the same essentially, or have you been able to make the ends slightly shorter?  I've been craving those for a long time...  Do you have an idea of when they'll be ready?  Month, or more specific?  Any discount for repeat business??  :wink:
