Am in the midst of starting a business, and at this point any funds will help, so am diverting my attention away from building an electric longboard for a while. Will come back to it sometime down the road.

So am selling 4 Jacob hubs

Understanding the current urethane issues with these hubmotors, and the fact that two of the motors I have will need retaining fluid for two of the bearings (tolerances where out a bit) am looking for 125us each for the good tolerance motors, and 100us for the two that will need retaining fluid.
