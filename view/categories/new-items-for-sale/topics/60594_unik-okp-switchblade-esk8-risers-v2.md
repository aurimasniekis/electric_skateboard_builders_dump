Good day, 

I have updated the design of my ESK8 riser which objective is to act as an interface and ease our builds.

The initial batch produced two years ago was milled out of solid blocks of ABS UV. People requested it, so I took the opportunity to update the design and include a sensor routing hole directly in the riser.

I'm now going to have them produced ABS UV injection molds in ABS UV. If any interest for any bulk order, let me know.

The set will include both front riser and rear riser. 7mm thick ABS UV. I will be able to produce some colors for the fancy builders out there.

My design/idea is the original one, so with all the due respect and unless people using this design without giving credits... I don't get the point you are making.

Nice you updated it with space for the sensor wire now :slight_smile:

Why don't you inject rubber instead of plastic? It would have the same function and would dampen a little bit the vibrations!

You got me wrong because I didn't respond correctly to balta @okp . I am crediting you for the design and thanking you for making it public before, hoping that might happen again.

It's not a dig, quite the opposite. These are great.

The idea for having a 4th hole for the sensor wires is a good one yes üòâ

yeah but that's mostly just an evolution of an original design to allow routing the sensor cable  ;)

Of course. I didn't know who'd come up with the basic design when I saw it on a picture of someone else's board. I tweaked it along with the cable conduit extension to suit my needs.

You know I've already credited you for the original design concept üòâüëç 

Everything else is indeed an evolution from that.

I like it. Makes the board nice and tidy üòÅ

Could you maybe change the design to have holders for the wires aswell? Like so each wire has some plastic in between them at the end to make it look nicer? i added that on mine else my wire would just be everywhere

of course. I'm gonna add this to force the routing end to end

![image|690x338](upload://19pyrJD2GoE3cjgHKG5ogFEpydX.jpg)Exactly like this here, like a holder for each wire before they go out

Yeah a couple of the holders broke off due the thickness of wires not being fully accounted for. Still not too bad for an amateur first attempt - plus you can't see it when assembled.

If truth be told they aren't really necessary, and I might change that in future for version #2

Are these v2 risers available anywhere? I've looked on your website and the pictures are a little different, my motors have sensors so hoping to get this version with a hole in for the sensor wire, it looks like the cleanest solution without drilling and routing holes in my deck...

Thanks!

hey bro, I've not started to produce them yet as it requires some budget. 3D print works well. If you want I could 3D print you a set !

This sounds extremely tempting - how much would a set of these cost? I'm in London - assuming you can ship here?

I'm currently reading vintage @whitepony build threads on Endless Sphere and your original Vanguard - the 2 of you are almost entirely responsible for me finally building my own board - inspiring!

I'll print you a set for free; just the shipping cost. Thanks man. Reminds me great moments on Endless Sphere.

Did someone say free what's going on!? 
Lol joking 
I really like these risers. I tried to print a pair at my public library ( which has it maker  room with a 3D printer) but every time I go in there I'm competing with some 10 year old printing action figures and can't get any print time.

dunno, the one I did where milled out of solid ABS UV blocs. If there is interest, I can launch a production. 

The one I did to prototype were PLA; worked fine.

I'd be interested :slight_smile:  how thick of a wire can be routed through these? If it could be done with softer filaments for more shock absorption, that would be interesting to see as well. Can these be made to be .5" thick?

I messaged a while back for these. I would snap up some from a production run straight away if you did one.
