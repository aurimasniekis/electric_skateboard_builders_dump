Just an update -- Received all (6) of the BMS HCX-D223V1 (12S model only).

I am willing to part with (3) of them. Cost will be price from Lucy invoice divided by 6. Plus about $5 shipping in US 1st class mail + tracking number. I think total is about.... $62 paypal ($60 if friends and family---but i prefer no u use this for ur own safety) Zero mark-up. If you know any cheaper way i am down too.

In no hurry to sell. Btw yes they did send the correct balance leads. All units in bestech unopened packaging.

I love that.  It reminds of this joke...

How do you the tell the difference between a fairy tale and story told by a redneck?
A fairy tale begins "Once upon a time".  A redneck story begins "No shit, there I was".

Yes!!! However, because the third pack has more Cycles on it, I cannot feel safe running the 3 without a BMS to monitor cell drift.

I still plan on balance charging from time to time, so I'm going to have to come up with a way to make the BMS semi-modular. In other words, I will be able to remove the pack from the BMS and separate each individual pack, hopefully without too much effort. 

Then again, I might just let the BMS do all the work

I think it's high time to get or make an enclosure and put the ultimate touch to that build.
You could get @bigben to make you a custom enclosure.
