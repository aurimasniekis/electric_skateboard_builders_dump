I broke two APS mounts with my large SK6374 motor, been using Jensos idler mount quite excessively and I really did everything to kill it - hard bumps at high speeds, full throttle, full braking, even one motor impact that got caught by the mount. its REALLY rock solid and I love the idler :heart_eyes:

I'm in for one !!
But I already have a pair of Cronin.
Does the truck need to be CNC absolutely or could I do it by hand ?

I was saying the same thing when jensos mounts arrived - but before he sent them over I kept complaining that the screw holes need more meat, else the mount would just keep breaking like the APS one with heavy motors such as the SK6374!

In the end I felt like thoroughly testing, so i kept driving on and off pedestrian sidewalks with very shallow angles to provoke hitting the ground with the mount ... just happened once in about 700km.

here is the mount now - didnt manage more mileage before autumn, but I REALLY pushed the mount hard ;)


mount took a heavy impact instead of the motor - didnt even blink. im sure that mount would survive a nuklear war! :smile:

the fairly large rounded mount protects the belt very effectively too
