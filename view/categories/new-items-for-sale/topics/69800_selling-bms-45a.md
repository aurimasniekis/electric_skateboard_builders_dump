Maybe look a little bad, but it's fixed, I tried to pull, and nothing, but if you prefer I can take off,I just stay like this because, half at work is done.
And the cables are biger than the area to join.
I should use cables with half diameter, because the connection to BMS are by double connection.

what was this for?
a try to make a stiff wire out of the silcon wire?
or why so much solder joins?

what was this for?
[/quote]

I took someone's board in to repair a fried bms. Found this, 5 fried lipos, a fried voltmeter, a fried focbox, and the bms...![0913180226_Film1|374x499](upload://q4i91yPKSsoGO5DS3Xy31xe8DA5.jpg) ![0914180418a_Film1|374x499](upload://g9UdxPDP31vQj024UviqzvvBbld.jpg) ![0913181451a_Film1|666x500](upload://ncj2gyKfb4Ir104QJVILYWZgbn6.jpg)

A lot of fried things...
I guess better not to ask how that happened 😬
But for what this small pieces of wire soldered together?

Wait a minute. You shorted a bms a few days ago. Is this one? If It is you can't sell as new and you must tell in the description that It could be damaged.

the BMS that i shorted was, my new BMS, and i saw with attention and didn't damaged the BMS.

The only problem, i think this BMS have is, when the batteries are full you can't brake. I'm not sure, but one guy tell me that on one topic.
