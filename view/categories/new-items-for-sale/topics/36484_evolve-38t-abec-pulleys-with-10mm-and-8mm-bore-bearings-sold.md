Hey guys,

I purchased 2 38T pulleys from Evolve last week for a project which ended up not working with my build so selling both of them. 

These will come with bearings that were custom ordered from the EU that fit these pulleys.

Includes:

2x 38T pulleys 
2x 22x10x6mm bearings for oversize axles 
2x 22x8x6mm bearings for standard axles 

Total shipped in the CONUS will be $80 shipped for everything.

I think I want them. How well do they fit? And how's the alignment?

Well they are made specifically for the Abecs so alignment is perfect.
