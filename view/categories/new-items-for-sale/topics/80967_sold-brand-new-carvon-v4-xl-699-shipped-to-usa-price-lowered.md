For sale is my **Carvon V4 XL** Drive from the group buy. Brand new, never hooked up to power or used at all. 

If you dont know, Carvon only did a limited run of the XL model(its a bigger longer motor). If you know Carvon, then you know it'll take you a long time to get a brand new pair of these. Here's your chance to get some BRAND NEW Carvons, without the wait. 

I'm selling these because I kind of stumbled upon an awesome new hobby called paramotoring(its fucking awesome you should check it out) and all my money is going to that.

I recently got a OneWheel, already have the custom CGT, I have tons of belt drive parts for futre builds and it's just more economical for me to go that route. These motor have been sitting around long enough and deserve to go in someones build. 

I'm asking **$750 shipped**. I'd like to ship these to USA only(it's easier for me). If you have any questions feel free to ask.

(Old used wheels, but don't worry the motors have never been used, just put them on for pictures)
(that's not me in the picture on the paramotor :p)

I'll do it for sure. Thanks man. I'm sad to see them go, I had big plans for these motors. But they need to go in someone elses spare no expense build like they deserve :)

I almost bought a paramotor 2 years ago but I couldnt bring myself to spend $15k, I'm assuming the price came down since then..

Dammit, now you got me interested again..

I've been nerding out for the last 4 weeks on it. It's about 6-8k for a really nice motor now, and about 3k for a really nice wing(for new stuff). so you can get into the sport for about 6-10k. Maybe a little less if you find a good used deal. 

You can find cheaper stuff, but it seems to be junk and not worth it(sound familiar? :p )

EDIT: @JLabs check out Tucker Gott's videos on youtube and kiss your money goodbye.

The word on the facebook groups/boards and such is blackhawk is mid/low teir gear, but affordable. Seems the FOC-BOX for paramotors is the vittorazi moster 185

No license needed in the states. You are even allowed to take off at most public airports. You have to follow FAR 103.

I'd assume the TorqueBoards DD pre orders have swept a good bit of the market. I oogled over those XL drives when they first came out but I didn't have the money nor expertise and still don't.

Good luck with the sale/build.

Still way overpriced IMO when there is no hope of support from the dead company that made them.

1.) They're brand new and ready to ship. That's worth a lot in this market. 

2.) There still isn't anything this big/powerful even out yet that isn't complete garbage with thin little axles. People are riding these and they work for the most part.

3.) A very small percentage of motors being sold now are even warrantied at all..Try sending your belt drive motor back after riding it for weeks and see if anyone RMA's it for you. 

Anyway, I don't think the price is really that far off for something that has a high demand. 

If you're actually interested in buying it, make an offer. If your just another person who's angry they didn't get their Carvon order yet, then there's plenty of other threads you can take your comments to.

These are the xl's too, for pretty much the same price as standard speed drives, new at that. And they're already out of Jerrys hands so no shipping delays lol.
