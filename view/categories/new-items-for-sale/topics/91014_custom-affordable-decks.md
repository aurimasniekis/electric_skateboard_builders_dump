I haven’t been active for so long on here and i’m looking to proceed with building a new board, I’m going to be building myself a new deck, and thought why not sell some if I’m building a few. 

I use a press to make them.

The material I will use is Baltic birch plywood.

I will use gorilla wood glue.

To cut the wood out I use a jigsaw and sand it all loads after and can apply a clear coat if needed or I can stain the wood a different colour or I can paint the wood any colour. 

I can also make a recess for battery packs, esc’s etc.

I won’t have photographs of the process until I build another deck.

Like I said, any shape is do-able and I am also offering a FREE Carbon fibre underside wrap for the first 10 customers that want it. And I will be making full carbon fibre boards in the future as well if requested.

Pricing - 
- Around £45 per deck
- £10 extra for the carbon wrap (first 10 Free) 
- Eu shipping is super cheap, around £7

Thanks all. 

P.S. A website is on the way.

@AlanZhou @briman05

I have some spuds around. This black one is shipping out tomorrow to get built out by @hyperIon1 for @Sn4pz.

The gold one I just drilled the mounting holes and sanded the surface and any glass frit sharp points, just gotta paint the bottom white and final clear coat.  That one I am going to put up for sale soon when it is done (pm if interested 😉).

The other one... someone attacked with a a drill bit while trippin on mushrooms.... 😂😂😂.  I kid, I kid...   I need to fill up the holes and then I am going to do something cool with it and list it probably.  Spuds are a fun platform to work on.

![20190418_152008|224x500](upload://l1YUJskEsvXypzPP4BbaeEsrbM9.jpeg) ![20190418_152055|243x500](upload://Ai4bm5hIMRIw0DuNLta1nJqupCJ.jpeg) ![20190418_151944|690x495](upload://7zh0iUZLvStQGBDEoT6N1O8vSE4.jpeg) 

Sorry about the shit lighting. They are actually really cool!

Thinking about this enclosure for the gold spud, though it is a little big for it and gets into the wheel well space.   Which isn't too big a deal of course. But, you know.

![20190418_153123|690x335](upload://yGmjXBo2sGoUFBYI8LYNfBr6cvV.jpeg) 


But this enclosure also looks sweet on this "High Seas" pintail I am wrapping up.

No I don't build them, just try to add a bit of sex appeal.  This is a white Psychotiller Knuckles enclosure that is skinned in silver aluminized fiberglass. Looks sick..



I have mostly been skinning @psychotiller and @bigben enclosures.


But, I really want to step it up a notch and do some more ground up work.  

Need to sell this damn Climbing Gym though!  Anyone want a climbing gym and have $1.3m?  HMU.

I use fine as well, but really like the medium for some reason.  I do keep fine for anyone who wants it on theirs.  I am just drawn to the chunkiness of medium.  Course on the otherhand is way to much.  It is only fine or medium truly.

Simple 3D print enclosure riser upgrades (10mm, 14mm, 18mm or 20mm) on Bamboo GT decks are popular in order to fit 18650 Li-ion batts. Also some 22mm Heat Sink risers to lower VESC and BMS and allowing larger full lenght enclosure fitting batteries.

If you match the Tramp deck then current enclosures could be used, also concave would be welcome

Think JLabs got the spud remade under license or directly from Jet. Then stock ran dry hence the ‘Tayto’ slightly different yet..same but bit longer

No idea if Tayto is Jet sanctioned, probably different enough to not have to

I think you should create a more in depth post about what types of decks you have made, and what you can make.

In the past I’ve only made like 20 vanguard style decks, all with concaves like the original bamboo deck, aside from that I may have made a couple custom ones in the past, I didn’t photograph any of them though, I don’t know why I didn’t. I can literally make any style anyone wants, with a concave or drop down. I built a concaveless deck because I wanted it like that, I’m adding feet strap things so a concave for me would be pointless. @Sn4pz

Questions about how you made it:
 1) tools used
 2) materials used
 3) pictures of process
 4) Is a deck press being used

People want to know how stuff gets made. I can go cut sheets of plywood into whatever shape and try and sell them. People would ask the same questions.

Yes I use a press.

The material I use is Baltic birch plywood.

I use gorilla wood glue.

To cut the wood out I use a jigsaw and sand it all loads after and can apply a clear coat if needed or I can stain the wood a different colour or I can paint the wood any colour. 

I can also make a recess for battery packs, esc’s etc.

I won’t have photographs of the process until I build another deck.

What type of press do you use? Also I had asked a few questions in the previous post.  I'm just asking because I am curious.  I know what it takes to build a deck as do several others here.  The top boards in esk8 all come from Red Ember boards they are the sickest decks out there.  The people here will give you benefit of the doubt but at a point it is a put up or shut up type of situation.  As we have seen so many guys come here that have been members for a while and just take peoples moneys and dont give a shit about the customer ie carvon, alextech.

Yeah I’m able to do that. Yeah I really like the design, I just randomly drew up some ideas and liked it the best @M4MBAY

Dude,  You posted pictures of a deck that I or anyone else with a jigsaw could make from hardware store materials.  This is your problem.  
If you want to build decks for people on this forum then you need to provide evidence that you know what you are doing.  No one is going to part with money until they see the process and the finished article of your work.  Just never going to happen.  Not trying to rain on your parade but rather point you in the right direction before you get completely hammered and disappear.

Give the man a break, at least he responds to all the messages, unlike some vendors on the forum.

I am trying to give him a break if you had an ounce of bright.  Read it again and then look to where I have not been completely constructive.  Young guy trying to make a difference needs constructive criticism not people blowing smoke up his arse.

I definitely know I can’t make a deck in general, I do agree about parting with money, but can’t agree that anyone can make a deck. I’ve tried numerous times and have failed every time due to me not having access to key tools. 

Also, I apologize because I have a tendency of skim reading and missing the point

Good on you for the admission but @Charster10 is offering a service here that not many of us can achieve due to lack of equipment.  Presses and cnc machines are usually not something that most people have in their workshop for esk8.  That said, I could easily make the deck that he posted.  
I applaud all attempts to forward this wonderful pastime but caution needs to be heeded when advertising services that are unproven.  
Charlie my friend, give some examples of work you have completed that requires more refining than the average guy can achieve.  Good luck with your venture.

If you show us something complicated (something you can't make without a piece of plywood and a jig saw), then I'm sure you will have your shot at being a reputable seller.  Until then, nobody has any reason to believe you're not a scammer.  Nobody wants to see you fail, you're offering a product we desperately want an need, but as of yet there is no reason to trust you with our money

You should come back with something exciting and revive this thread then, no point arguing over he said she said until it clearly worth the effort to debate over reputability

Charlie, take some pics of the workshop you create these decks in and everyone else relax.

Including all of the following....
- press geometry (obvious press work)
- wheel wells (obvious CNC work)
- nice finish (obvious high quality material)

I think a tayto or spud like board is a good start, some concavity to the deck and short kick tail as proof if concept, and the wheel wells of course

You know just “popping” over a design to you is something a lot of people charge $3-500 for.

Have you done any design yourself? 

And @dareno is not being negative at all. Do a quick search on some of the decks people have made and sold here....very very detailed threads with tons of pictures or the process and final product.

The process DOES make a difference in not only the ride quality, but also stability, speed limits, and overall quality of the deck (there are a lot more variables too).

All everyone is asking is for this proof and reassurance. What makes your deck any different than me buying a $50/60 blank and cutting the edges to a different shape?

Not trying to be a dick, I want to see more deck builders on here, I just want to see the proof that it’s a good quality product.

When I say pop a deck over, I mean simply  google a deck design, not make one up and draw one up, I understand that and I will proceed with building one to show what I can do if that’s what people want

One concave will be easier given the design the of the board but I can more than likely make a W concave happen @M4MBAY

You don’t need a CNC to make wheel wells a plunger router can do the same thing just slower and you need to know what you are doing then you just sand it smooth and there you have a wheel well.

If you can produce nice contours and symmetrical material removal it doesn't matter how you do it.  At the end of this the results are all that matter save for using child labor
