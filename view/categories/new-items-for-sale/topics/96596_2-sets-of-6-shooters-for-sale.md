Hey all,

I bought 2 sets of six shooters for a few builds a while back. Direction of the build has changed and I want to try out the bermeisters so I need to sell at least one set of six shooters!!

They’ve never been ridden, only mounted on trucks and spun to make sure they were true. They come with the bearings and spacers.

I’ll knock $20 off their original price so $280 + shipping OBO.

I can post some picture when I get home!

The bearings are for surf rodz 10mm axles, but I have a few sets for 8mm on hand too
