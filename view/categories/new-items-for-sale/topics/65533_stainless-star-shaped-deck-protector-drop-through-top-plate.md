brand new and from @dickyho

I ordered an extra set on accident probably thinking 1 meant 1 ea and not one set.

anyways they look great and have good weight to em.

US only $8 for the pair plus shipping, paypal friends and family if you aint using a balance/checking 

shipping from CT 06854, NYC pick up an option... first class will be cheapest and probably is a couple ounces (uncertain) if you want to calculate shipping cost to you.

Let me know if interested. thanks!!
