Hello everyone, I have motor mounts to fit Paris truck.  These mounts will work for wheel size ranging from 83 to 107+ mm.  The clamp is 3/8" (~10mm) thick, the motor arm is 3/16" (~5mm) thick with integrated dual idlers.  This mount can be fitted with 50xx or 63xx motors by any manufacturer.
The price is $50 per set.  It includes 1 clamp, 1 universal motor arm and all stainless hardware.

Wouldn't you think is easier for people to search for a mount specific to a hanger?

just saying be careful. Flooding the market threads with similar products will leave a bad taste in our mouths. We tend to ignore spam, until we get tired of it and excise it,  so tread thoughtfully.
