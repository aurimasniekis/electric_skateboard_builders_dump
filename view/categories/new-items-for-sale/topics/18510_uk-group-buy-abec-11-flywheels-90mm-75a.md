If you're in the UK and you want Abec 11 90mm 75A wheels, then let me know if you're interested in a group buy....
For anyone outside UK, OK to do it, just might incur slightly more shipping...

Am limited to 4 sets, so first come first served ;-)
[EDIT] Forgot to mention: still working out prices, but will be around Â£95.

Lemme know!

I am interested in 97mm wheels. I am from Italy but I can provide you with a uk address if it is too much work to ship abroad.
