After reading about the price increase of these batteries on nkon imr batteries and elsewhere this is a pretty good deal in my oppinion, depending where you live taxes could be a problem but see this for yourself

**Use GBNovember as a promo code for an extra 10% off**

But..I made a comparison between gearbest and nkon.nl to see how much of a deal it actually is.

(1) gearbest will only deliver 32 cells in a single order to the EU (maybe a few more but not another 8 cells not sure about NA or other places)

(2) The price difference even with a sub-100 cell order was only about 3-4 euros cheaper.

(3) I have read some grumbling about the cell quality or at least the condition of the cell wrap and marks, gearbest's cells were said to be a little marred although consensus says they are real Samsung cells.

So in my opinion still use nkon.nl, especially as you can make a 48 cells order with a single shipment which negates any price difference.
