Hi All,

If you’ve seen Jason (@onloop ‘s) recent youtube vlogs you’ll know he’s moving to the other side of Oz and deserting his South Australian brethren - shame on you Jase! ;-)

You’ll also probably be aware that he’s wound up the parts business and is focusing on completes from now on (with the exception of FOCBOXs and remotes).  

But what happened to all the leftover parts?  Did he sell them all?...

Nope!

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/e/4e37eb2d84d0c3387625e84c9412a48e0e59012f.JPG" width="375" height="500">

As he’s pretty time poor and lives local to me I’ve offered to help liquidate his remaining stock which as you can see there are literally tubs full - especially 9mm and 12mm wheel pulleys!  There’s also heaps of wheels, truck risers, truck bolts, bearings, belts and even skate tools.  I’m going to count everything up this weekend and free up some racking space so it’s all organised but ahead of that and working out my strategy I thought I’d start this post up to generate some interest.  

We haven’t settled on prices yet but they’ll obviously be heavily reduced on the original unit prices and the idea really is just to shift them!  I’ll make these parts available worldwide and will mostly sell through eBay and directly through the forum for anyone who’s interested.  Shipping small quantities to the US (for example) isn’t really going to be too worthwhile so if anyone is interested in a group buy or bulk deal then let me know and we can work something out.  

I’ll add to this post on Sunday when I’ve had chance to work out what’s there in total and put some prices to the parts.

Any questions in the meantime gimme a shout!

Thanks,

Dan

Hey Dan, awesome news!

Personally I would be interested in 2x 12mm and 2x 9mm wheel pulleys. If you have the motor pulleys too, I would like some as well.

But a question regarding Enertion. We should keep some of that stuff to repair Raptor 1's for the repair agents, no ?

Thanks @Skitzor I'll defo be able to hook you up with wheel pulleys but I don't have any motor pulleys unfortunately.  Yeah Jason has actually still kept a load of stuff back for repairs - I've tried to buy left over R-SPEC motors in the past but he's keeping them back for exactly that reason :wink:

I'm all about group buys and larger orders and will reduce the prices further for these.  

It seems there is a lot of interest in smaller orders too (all good) in which case I'll probabaly either direct people to an ebay listing or set up basic website to host the orders and check out.  Might have underestimated just how much stuff is here! :sweat_smile:

Sounds good - drop me a PM.  I'm meeting up with Jason for a beer / skate on Saturday and we'll discuss pricing, I'll then be able to make you an offer on a bulk buy ;-)

Further to this I'll be sure to keep everyone in the loop of what's left once things start selling.  I don't think anyone needs to worry about pulleys selling out in a hurry though there's literally thousands of them!

You'll need to remove 8mm of aluminum for each pulley.

items would be listed on www.esk8life.com to organize purchases 

@DanSkates can you verify whether the pulleys will work on any abec cored wheels? or just the enertion wheels. 

I got a hold of the blue enertion pulleys before but they didn't fit into mbs or clone wheels. thanks

Hey Joe!  Jase said these fit Flywheels/clones and I'm sure I've seen people use these in the MBS AT builds.  I don't have those wheels here to try (only the Enertion PowerWheels) but I'd be more than happy to post out samples to give you some assurance before a larger order.

Me and my wonderful Wife (god knows how she puts up with me!) counted up all the parts last night (finished at 1am!) so I know what stock is there now and I'm working out the pricing.  I'll create a sliding scale for larger orders especially where there's a lot of stock so that you guys can buy them cheaper and make a small profit your end too.

It's going to take a while to reply to everyones interest and I'll look to have ebay ads up for smaller orders in the next couple of days once I've looked into shipping and set myself up with packaging materials.  I'll get back to those intersted in group/bulk buys buy the end of the day hopefully (Sunday).

Bear with me folks - getting there as quickly as I can :wink:

To circumvent lots of messages asking for parts I don't have here's the list of exactly what's there:


Wheel Pulley 9mm	- 1,285
Wheel Pulley 12mm - 1,024
Belt 9mm	 - 220 belts
Wheel spacer (set of 4) - too many to count!
PowerWheels (set of 4) -	46
Truck Risers (set of 2) - 711
Truck Bolts / Nuts (set of 8) - 229
Bearings - ABEC-9 608RS (set of 8) - 89 
Skate Tools - 100
Winning Remote v1	- 11

**NOTE:**  There are no trucks, mounts, motors or 12mm belts - sorry for those intersted in those parts.  As I mentioned earlier in the thread Jason has kept some stock back for R1 repairs, claims etc.

Thanks everyone for the overwhelming interest!

It's been a busy day at Enertion Liquidation HQ!  I finally have everything organised, priced and ready to ship...well nearly!  I still need to buy packaging materials and work out the best services and pricing for shipping but we're getting close.  

I even managed to sort out a half decent packing area:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/b/bbfa31260c79daaae0cf781207f3c9e5510f07ee.JPG" width="666" height="500">

**What's next?**
To make this run smoothly and ensure everyone gets exactly what they're after I've created a specific email address to channel requests and questions and have set up a Google Forms order form which will populate my inventory list so I can more easily track orders.

To clean things up I'll create a new thread with the order form, photos of actual stock, descriptions etc and expect to have this up and running by tomorrow, maybe even tonight if I can keep my eyes open long enough! I'll create a link at the bottom of this thread as soon as it's ready to go.

There have been a lot of messages and I'll try and get back to everyone separately but the best way to ensure you get what you want is to submit an order form as soon as it's available. This will then populate my orders list and I'll serve people on a first come first served basis. If people are interested in larger orders then it's still ok to PM me but it might take me a little while to work through the backlog so the order will confirm your interest. Once you've completed an order form I'll get in touch via email with postage costs and if you are happy to proceed with the order I'll provide my PayPal details to complete your order. I'll then email as soon as it's shipped with tracking details provided by the courier/postal service.

Once I've given everyone on the forum first dibs I'll then create eBay ads and open it up to everyone else! If you'd prefer eBay then I'll also add links to the ads in the next thread when available.

Whilst I draft the next topic, add pictures etc here's the inventory list with pricing. I worked through the pricing today with Jason and this undercuts the previous sale prices and anything else I can find online for the individual parts so hopefully you guys will be happy!

Note, there's a second column with a further discount for bulk buys with unit sales greater than 10 per unit type.

Hey @briman05 - that's totally on topic, no worries at all.  I mostly used ebay.com for like comparisons and undercut the lowest price for these parts I could find.  Happy for you to put forward what you think a fairer price would be and I'll consider it?  The cheapest I could find these bearings for example was $12 so in the bulk deal these are 1/3 off.  Bolts I'd say are a pretty good price (I'd love to see an example of where you've found them cheaper!) but perhaps truck risers could be cheaper...especially as there are so many to sell - I'll shave some more off this today.

Because of the postage prices I hoped to be able to set up larger group buys to consolidate postage which would of course make this cheaper for indivduals.  

Happy for feedback please let me know.

@DanSkates well for 13 bucks you can get zealous bearings. These 608 bearings are Chinese made and you can have any abec printed on them and they are probably no better quality then abec1 maybe 3 compared to true abec 9 bearings. Those bearings would also be about well over 50+ for true abec 9. I have point bolts and risers from skateshred for about very little like 13.00 for about 25 sets of bolts. Muirskate is a well known shop and you can get bolts for 4.00 and risers are 4.50 for .25”

Thanks @briman05 for the feedback.  I'm kinda selling them on face value and I'd recommend perhaps going down the Zealous route if they're similar in price and you'd prefer that 'known' brand.  But I absolutely get what you're saying.  With the bolts, do they come with the nylock nut?  I believe that part to be more expensive than the bolt...

@scepterr you're probabaly right that bundling would be better and I was thinking of creating a 'skate pack' of parts including bearings, bolts, risers, spacers, skate tool etc and that will likely be one of the first ebay ads I create.  I'm still working out the best way to pass the parts on and am greatful for any ideas/advice you guys might have.
