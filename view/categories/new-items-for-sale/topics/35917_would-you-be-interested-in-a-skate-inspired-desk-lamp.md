If this is against any rules please feel free to delete. @treenutter 

I have made and sold several dozen of these and have gotten pretty good feedback. Would anyone here be interested in one? Going to make another batch of them for an upcoming trade show and figured I would see if anyone wanted one while I was making some. They come in 83mm wheels in red, 90mm in black, and 97mm in orange. They are only $30 and a switch can be added for $5.

I used led strips on mine because i had a pvc center core but you can get the bulbs like the one your using on ebay with remote and all for like 10 bucks. Some even play music via bluetooth. If you drill out the center with a hole saw and hide the bulb base it will be a more contemporary look.  Good luck!
