Hi all,

I got some custom batteries built for some safe high power drag racing boards (not actually drag racing - just insane acceleration without tasking the batteries and without using LiPo pouches.

While the capacity is low they charge in 30 mins using a 5A charger! (not selling that, but I have 3A chargers instead)

It's essentially a 36v version of a boosted board battery, with the same 2.5AH capacity and badass BMS that's rated to 80 amp's peak, 40amp continuous. 

I've got a few spare if anyone's interested. 2 x here in UK and 10 more being built at factory. Â£190 each. Shout if your keen for a high power light wight battery. Comes with charger.

Specs:

38.4v (charges to 40v)
2.5AH
12s1p A123 cells
XT-90 for discharge
3pin 5amp rated connector for charging.
Voltage display with on/off switch
40Amp rated BMS (80amp peak)
232mm(L) x 102mm(W) x 40mm (H) (more can be shaved off if you remove the plastic enclosure)

Sorry about the pictures, phone got soaked today and camera is still drying off.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/0/f0bccbd50b13df20d0fdb53efbfbe8f099b57a65.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/c/6ca46c35045d6d7470d64df38e35096edaa46867.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/4/94b5dceae9ea76e3f28fe1d69bfb95b63edc8c29.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/7/778eb50d8094b50ce32735f3c978394a1fc57f92.jpg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/a/ea562e0a59f6c16d8afed62a02ed53ba352c2c8d.jpg" width="375" height="500">
