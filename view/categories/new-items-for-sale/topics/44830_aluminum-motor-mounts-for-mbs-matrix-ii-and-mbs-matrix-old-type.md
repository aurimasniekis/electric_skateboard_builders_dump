Hi

The best way to contact me is via the eSK8 forum
The problem is that I work very much and write back in the evening only (once a day)

Motor mounts in version v7.3 with rollers is designed for a gear ratio of 15/60, Can use the 72t pulleys but you have to disassemble the idlers

I can make a pulleys in 2 widths, for 15mm and 20mm belts

Price list
Motor mounts v5.0 - 120 Euro x4 = 480 Euro
Motor mounts without idlers v7.3 - 140 Euro
72t/23mm (20mm belt) pulley for rockstar hub - 50 Euro x2 = 100 Euro
72t/18mm (15mm belt) pulley for rockstar hub - 45 Euro x2 = 90 Euro
15t/21mm aluminum motor pulley - 5 Euro x2 = 10 Euro
15t/16mm aluminum motor pulley - 5 Euro x2 = 10 Euro
Belts 15mm - 8 Euro x2 = 16 Euro
Belts 20mm - 10 Euro x2 = 20 Euro

Shipping cost to Australia - 58 Euro 

Payment by PayPal

Lead time - 4 weeks

Write me what should be the width of the pulleys, then I will sum up the price of whole set 

Sorry for my English

Regads:
Tom

**So, can I please order now**
**V5.0 x 2   =   240Euro**
**15mm belt x 2  =   16euro (belt length to suit 18-20t motor pulley, 72t wheel pulley)**
**Shipping to Australia   =  ???**
**Do you want 100% paypal payment now?**
**please give me instructions.**
These are to fit MBS Matrix 2 Pro.

Unfortunately, he doesn't make an adapter for the tri-spoke hub (at least, it's not mentioned on his motor mount thread). I'd recommend getting a set of fivestar hubs from MBS. I have a kit on the way from Idea right now for my fivestar hubs and ats12 trucks :slight_smile:

@[Quiller_Arc](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/u/Quiller_Arc)
I recommend version 6.3 for driving on difficult terrain

Prices
Motor mounts 6.3 - 150 Euro

![20181127_215823_cr|613x500](upload://h6GElkSFTOlnRnZZgE8U1gaZ8qk.jpeg)

![20180203_1633581|554x500](upload://ja1YAUSad4Svy85EiOSdIV1Yd3n.jpg) 

Now there will also be a version with narrower belts
The mount price will be unchanged, but the set of pulleys and belts will be cheaper

v6.3 for 15mm belts
![20190121_225631_cr|620x500](upload://2x3hK7pKaJjAeuVxAYjr3BGHGGm.jpeg) 

If you want a lower price, I have v4.5 versions, price  120 Euro

I do not have pulleys for your hubs, 
You would have to change the hubs for those that have a larger hole spacing, eg HYPA from Tramp or other hubs

@Idea 

I'm looking for motor mounts with idler pulleys. 
currently running MBS matrix II with MBS Rockstar II hubs.   18T/62T pulleys 15MM wide belts.  200mm tires. 
it's for a commuter board over rough roads.   45-50kph cruising speeds.  ( peak 60kph ) 
I'm looking to maintain braking torque without slipping and without over tensioning the belts.

What do you recommend? 

I think  v7.3  or v6.4  motor mount set and I  can use the same pulleys?   

thanks.  and brilliant work! :)

@Idea I just spotted you're using the MBS Pro 97 deck for this build. Did you have any trouble with the deck touching your motor mounts or belts with this deck? I was thinking of trying a Comp 95 which is meant to be the same width, but I noticed others on here had to reform the nose and tail to avoid the bite. But they weren't using your mounts of course. Cheers for any info you have as I couldn't quite make out the clearance for the pics you put on here.

I have no problems with this deck, 

![IMG_20191111_114913_cr|524x500](upload://8UDCju1mUoSQ0LDNHDcRSdwHoZT.jpeg) 

I used the v7.4 mount, but I also saw the v6.5 mount with this deck and I had no information about the collision of the mount with the deck

If I find a photo of the v6.5 mount with MBS PRO 97 DYLAN WARREN deck, I will send it to you

Thanks for the information. 

What collides with the deck? motor mounts or pulleys?

Just the wheel pulley

You have an older version of Matrix II, the distance between hubs is 290mm

In the newer version produced from 2018, the distance is 318mm, probably in the newer version there will be no collision of pulleys with the deck

Thanks again for the extra info there @glyphiks and @Idea. I'll have to be careful when I get my Matrix II's then to ensure I get the latest model and not some old stock. Seems a shame to have to cut down the deck as the nice rounded edge reminds me of snowboarding.

I checked their site and they have the old Matrix down as 15.5 inches and the new metal ones as 16.2, so it would certainly appear that way. I forgot the metal version is still relatively new, so I don't have to worry about old stock. 

I wonder if that extra 0.7 inches will be enough to clear the mounts though.

Shorter spacers can be used, which will increase the pulley spacing

On this photo there are 20mm long spacers, you can use 15mm long spacers, then the track between the pulleys will increase by 10mm (0.4 inch)

That's a good idea @Idea (lol). It would probably be worth @glyphiks trying that before cutting into his deck at least. Worst case is he has to cut off less.

If I did that then my cross bars would be too short. I am happy to cut the deck, and the dude I am building it for doesnt mind, he just wants to ride it üòÇ

That would be a massive shame as I think those cross bars really make that mount pop. Looks amazing!
