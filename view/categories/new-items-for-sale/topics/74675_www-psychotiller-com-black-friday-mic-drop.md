Freakin awesome.... how Long do you reckon shipping to shanghai would take? 2 weeks? Also shipping is 5 bucks more than the enclosure itself 🤦‍♂️ . I was going to make my own enclosure with fibre glass but my friend’s workshop which I’m going to be using doesn’t have heating and it’s cold af now and he tells me the resin won’t cure properly at too Low of a temp so when I saw this deal I almost squealed like a 5 year old.

The 1800 custom is only for people outside the USA right since it doesn't have the battery that is why it is cheaper?

Also I got a 405 enclosure now on my deck that I had to do some super modifications to it because my board narrows at the center to like 8.5 inches  and it was the only enclosure at the time you had that would fit my battery width wise.  I used thread inserts so kind of set on the same spots now you have some many other enclosures what would you recommend.

Yes, while factoring in also what it costs to get a board overseas to most places.

If you are interested in a complete rolling chassis it can be had here in the USA. You know where to find me.

If I purchase a 10s5p GTX enclosure for $40, would I then have to buy the battery at the usual price (since it is not listed)? My friend got one from you and it looks great - thinking about upgrading my own GTX if possible if I bought it separately.

I would like to take the opportunity to load my 44 deck with the missing components friday too (just shipping wise and sending funds over in 1 is cheaper).
Would need an extra set of 6,rkp,mounts,..
Also, can i get redember xapham (as it considerably more $$, which i do not mind if i need to pay more for the complete)

Sorry for the q, just dont want to make a mistake and miss out 😊

What you do, is on Friday, just order a complete. I'll then message you from the site to get all of the specifics. No extra charge for xaphan. 

Then just order the extra parts you need as well. 

I'll have all of the sale pricing up on the site. 

Exciting! Stoked to have you on board.

Apparently not ALL of the enclosures are on sale for $40. Just tried to pick up a Split Low Pro V3 27" $70 listed/$70 in cart, in contrast to if I pick up a Psycho's Arc $65 listed/$40 in cart (as is all others). Not sure if this is an exception or what the situation is but that's the one I wanted. It's 18:08 MST on Thursday Nov, 22. Now I read the posting as the sale being good from 23:59:59 Thursday night to exactly 23:59:59 Friday so technically that hasn't started yet but all the enclosures (except the V3) if you put them in your cart they are $40.

So, I'm confused as to whether the sale is actually supposed to be going on right now or if it still has a few hours to go but since the V3 is the one I want and if I wait until midnight to see if it really go on sale and doesn't then I could be screwed because then for all the others really on sale, the sale ends and nothing is on sale, and I'm SOL...so what do I do? Buy something I really don't prefer but need or miss out entirely?

Thank you for being the voice of reason. I've argued with myself several times about it. Turns out the arc V2 supports boards without a channel if you're crafty. Never thought I'd be so happy about being an inch bigger.

Also remember, he makes most if not all of his products by himself. He runs the show, he puts out nothing but quality and doesn't cut corners.

I'm all fine with waiting for something a bit longer to have the knowledge that I'm getting something super high quality and i know its going to withstand the abuse I'm going to put it up against.

@CamBo I'm running the groupbuy esc+motors+remote. They've been great. Very low stress install, and very easy day-to-day.

I'm not gonna lie, it's not a speed demon, but top speed is around 25mph, and it's very smooth both acceleration and braking. Brakes are strong enough and smooth easy response. Great for a mellower more normal ride, unlike my normal rides, which always have a bit of "I might die today" feel.

Remote is fantabulous.

Since the escs are max 24a combined, can use a very modest pack to feed them.

It is like anything. Many small steps affect success greatly.  Hard to get right only doing one or 2. But much easier as you get experience.


Is it worth it?  I dunno, probably not to do it yourself if you only plan on doing one.  But to me it looks amazing.  Adds a lot of depth to a build over many enclosures available.

It also adds a shitload of robustness. I wouldn't feel confident building electronics into an enclosure on ABS alone (I would deck mount components and use the enclosure as a dust shield essentially.) However, CF skinned ABS is tough as shit, and can take hard ass knocks all day... fine for components mounted in the enclosure itself.

For the robustness and looks I would say it is worth it all day even though not cheap to get someone else to do it and not particularly easy if you go at it yourself.

TLDR.  Yes; worth it.

@psychotiller I’ve got the recommended M4 screws and threaded insert nuts for mounting this. Am I to understand that the screw will not press the enclosure sides flat against the deck?

In other words the enclosure will cover the electronics and the screws are just to keep it in place and should be tightened with little torque and used with washers, right?
```

---
## \#310 Posted by: mmaner Posted at: 2019-01-10T17:11:52.429Z Reads: 114

Most people build the components on the bottom of the deck.  The enclosure is meant to be protection for the components, not a holder of components.

Use a foam seal around the edge of the enclosure, that makes it pretty water resistant and cushions any rattles or squeaks of the ABS against the deck.  You want the screws holding the enclosure o be pretty tight, they will rattle out if not.  Or use loctite on them.
```

You definitely can tighten down the enclosure until it closes the gap all the way around. As @mmaner said, use a foam seal. If you follow my enclosure mount tutorial, you wont have any issues.

I’m using this [Foam seal](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F143021936348)

@psychotiller that post has been my holy grail for mounting solutions lol.  So let me explain what I’m saying with the help of some pictures 
![image|375x500](upload://5Nd4IOHFSE7tmnjP8BC1YKqBGMP.jpeg) 
The side edges are about 6-8 mm raised.  I believe it will not sit flat against the deck. 

![image|375x500](upload://jbQWudleNFjcghpCmcclIalPFXV.jpeg) 

This is a 16mm screw. If I install it there will be a gap between the head of the screw and the deck that is equal to the height of the raised edge. 

The only way to avoid that is to tighten the screw but won’t that deform the shape of the enclosure?

![image|375x500](upload://tu3zjknm2FNIgiBcfifxpIDWge1.jpeg) 

Honestly, I’m still waiting on my deck so this is all conjecture at this point.

## \#316 Posted by: venom121212 Posted at: 2019-01-10T18:39:43.965Z Reads: 111

Use rubber washers or automotive fender washers to take the stress off the enclosure. Also, you could find that screw in a smaller length or just saw off whatever extra from the end of it. You shouldn't have a gap between the head and the enclosure nor should you be deforming the enclosure. Find that sweet spot right in between. Good luck!

The lowest edge of the enclosure will absolutely seal up to your deck. Cut the foam the same shape as the enclosure. Mount the enclosure over that. The only thing in question is the torque you think you need to use.

There's is one more thing I wanted you guys' advice on. I bought these waterproof cable connectors for the cable wires that extend out from the enclosure. Luckily I use the Carvon V4 motors that come with 9 pin connectors so i just have 2 cables for my motor. 

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N9I6E3O/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09__o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1

As you can see this is for wires coming in and out of holes but this will not work with the enclosure I have as that has a wedge shaped channel for the cables. 

My question is how do I now make the board water resistant from here. The foam will make sure that there is no water that can seep in from the sides but what of this opening?

I know I can use silica sealant or something like that but I am looking for a more professional solution that will also allow me to open by enclosure in case I need to.
