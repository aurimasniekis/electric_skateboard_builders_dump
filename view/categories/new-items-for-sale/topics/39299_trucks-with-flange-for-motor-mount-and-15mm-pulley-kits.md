Clearing out the last of some old stuff.  Basically going to throwing the trucks in for free if you buy two pulleys kits.  $90 shipped for x2 trucks and x2 complete pulleys kits.

You could make a dual diagonal with this setup. You will note this truck was designed for the pulley to have a bearing (sort of like Enertion's trucks before), but my pulley kits don't have a bear, so you will need to put some spacers in there or something.
