Hey.
This thread here is for the MTB Drive, means 1:5 Gearing and support bearings inside Spurs.
This is well testet and holds up very good.

The smaller 1:4 Drive without support bearing which fits on the Urban Carver Truck is newer, @whitepony is testing it actually, i got it running too.

Which one you are looking for?

This is the same conclusion i've come to after many many threads over the course of the last 3 months. I'm just not sure about a few things battery wise, as far as the best ones for my specific use. The LG h2s look good but i've also heard really good things about the Samsung Q30s. I just want to have the ability to go 30 miles, not that I need to I just want the ability to.

After some Customers needet to modify my standart pulleys this ones should fit directly.
Removed the Hub, added a 3mm Keyway and a Setscrew inside the flanges.
But as on some other Motors the Motorshaft itself has to be shorten do 27mm. 
30‚Ç¨ more for the Dual Drive with this.

I am becoming a staunch admirer of your work, too the point I can't get my mind off what will be my first build (second board, once I get a Raptor 2), which would involve the urban Carver kit. How is it holding up so far? In case the bearing-less spur gave way, with time, could it be replaceable?
Thanks for the inspiration, no matter what!

[/quote]


This are the very first gears, changed them to many differnt versions of the Drive : 
-Prototypes 
-Deluxe Alu Drive
-Eco Drive - Stainless Steel
-Eco Drive - Alu (only for science)
-Eco Drive - Steel lightened ( only for science)

So they get mounted/dismounted often, something i would not recomend in general because everytime you will change the position slightly... this will make the gears louder IMO

Anyway the shape is still ok i think, always one new one next to old one for compare :

Not really.
This Stainless Steel lasercutted one is really good as it is i think, also its affordable...

In the beginning of this i had a batch from 5 Deluxe Drives with machined aluminium motormounts, wider clamping, little lighter.... price was alot higher but sold quickly....

Maybe i do something like this again as Limited Edition ....

Ohh nice but straight teeth are very noisy but angled gear ensures better and silent torque transmission - bronze material (CuSn 6)
Gear oil for lubrication  

I also have something similar in the plan, nice work<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/f/1feacb3552b8241a4ad4b42f9c1fb74575e6a214.jpg" width="300" height="225">

I'm planning out a build and the direct drive mounts piqued my interest, but I was wondering if you could elaborate on how they compare/contrast to belt/chain setups (beyond sound and likely being more efficient overall, I'm not sure how the rides differ, etc)... and what situations you'd recommend belt over direct drive (if any).  

IE: I'm overweight, so I'm wondering if belts might be less taxing on everything since there's inherently more slip involved, etc, under max load scenarios.  IE: better to go through a belt than break something more $$.  When I try to search myself, I'm getting dominated with belt vs hub results.

Also, I see there is a 5:1 MTB setup and a 4:1 carver setup... are the motorspears interchangable (or are there any other gears available to play with the ratio?)

I'd also be interested in which setup you'd suggest for a tampa MTB (likely trampa, at this point) AT commuter for a 140kg rider (IE: 15 miles each way, mostly paved trails+street along with some bumpy areas/transitions (poor quality roads/gravel/dirt/grass... but _mostly_ decent pavement).

Chain Dirt resitance but not strong enough
Belt strong and smooth but dont like dirt
Direct strong and dirtresistent. Low Drag. Louder.

I got actually not ONE shreddet Gear... they will come for sure but it seems to be really really strong.

Maybe if you go only with good and dry weather you could think about the belt... but i would only if you really looking for the silence 

I would choose mtb with pneumatics... maybe bigger motors could be nice if you plan to go really crazy ... i check for clearence for another big dude actually...

1:5 gearing with the bigger MTB Gearbox... no other gearings possible... 

I would calculate with 30wh/km for needet battery size

Great, thanks for the info.

I don't mind a bit more noise... I liked the sound in the videos I could find and it didn't sound _too_ loud (can be hard to tell on video, though), but any other comparisons / dB estimates might help.

It sounds like the dual direct drive would be the best fit for me... which is the one I wanted the most anyway :slight_smile:.  I am planning on going w/ pneumatics... how is the fit/clearance on 7" superstar tires?  6"?

...and this is less drive specific, but thought I'd ask:  any guidance on what efficiency I should use when calculating for speed (accounting for all of my 140kg :))?  I'm tenatively planning on going w/ dual 6364 or 6374 motors on 7" wheels w/ VESC 6s on 12s(5p-8p of 30Q cells) (with as much torque as possible, while still able to easily cruise at 35km/h+)... 170kv?  190kv?  ...would it be worth considering the full MTB ultimate trucks + mini direct drive + 130-150kv motors (more efficient?) over vertigo+regular drive+170-190kv?  Is the mini as strong as the regular version, etc?

_Lastly_...is that 60‚Ç¨ for a single motorspur replacement?

Thanks again!

If you put road tires/wheels on a motocross bike (make it a supermotard), the extra traction (cause you are not on dirt and now with more rubber) destroys the drive train. You need a to also use a [cush](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=cush+drive+sprocket&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjtg7DngtrVAhWGE5QKHbkBAAYQsAQILQ&biw=1366&bih=654) drive hub, there are several design models but something like this might be a place to start if you want to replicate what is done on a motorcycle.

Cush is short for cushion, and uses rubber mounted fasteners...

I think it is possible that Jenso's POM gear in his direct drive could be fulfilling this function?
Very clever.

If you wanna go with 7 or 6 Inch choose the mini drive... downside is that it has no support bearing inside the spurgear.... the box/sealment of the mini drive is lighter so less HD as the full size one... just build it lighter because its more for street and light offroad.... but a crazy friend of mine running this mini drive with fullsize vertigo on his MTB basher board... for month jumping and burnouts with torque max6 esc.... 

Long story short go with fullzize gearbox if you go with 8inch.... for less wheelsize choose mini direct drive

60‚Ç¨ for single Motorspur ? NO
25‚Ç¨ single standart 8mm motorspur
65‚Ç¨ single wheelspur
Without VAT

I would go maybe for around 150 to 170 kv on 12s with 8inch and fullsize gearbox....

On 12s 200kv i got 65kmh calculated without losses... stopping acceleration on about 53kmh because it starts to scare the shit out of me... 

Okay with 35kmh cruising speed you prefer ... go with 150 for about 45km vmax imo

Is it hot where you live?
Do you wanna ride real hard?
Maybe again look at 80mm... hope on weekend i got some pics if it would be possible

Hi,

so I'm preparing my trampa for Jensos Direct Drive right now (battery, Vescs,.....), witch might arrive in a few weeks.

So a Question to the people allready riding the Direct-Drives:

Did anyone try to use DryLube,Teflon-Stuff also for the Gears ?
Or are you all going with grease inside the gears and drylube for the sealing ?
What will happen with the dried drylube-lefovers inside the gear ??
and any difference (compared to grease) in wear, sound, drag,......
any grease or drylube you would recommend ?

greets

Gernot

Thanks for the reply/info.

> Is it hot where you live?

No, it's pretty moderate.

> Do you wanna ride real hard?

Probably not by your standards :) .  I'm mostly looking for offroad 'capable', but mostly for cruising around and commuting on mixed surfaces and some light-medium hills... but want it to feel almost 'effortless' for the board.  Probably not too much crazy offroading :).

> Maybe again look at 80mm... hope on weekend i got some pics if it would be possible

Do you have 80mm mounts/drives :) -- but probably too many amps for VESCs / 18650 packs?

How does the ride on 8" compare to 7"?  Higher center of gravity?  Would larger wheels have more rolling resistance / require more torque?  I'm wondering if I should go w/ smaller wheels to reduce the initial load since I'm a bigger guy... or if it doesn't really matter.

I just use white lithium grease for the gears. I've noticed the axial v ring seal doesn't matter in my case much cause the lithium grease will just hit it from the inside and lube it up. I also tried sealing the entire case halfs with ultra blue rtv. They still leaked a little bit. No worries though.

I think in the end you need an comfortable ride, with 8 inch you are always on the safe side to run with lower pressure... 

Yeah maybe on smaller tires with same gearing the startup is better but i dont see really a startup problem with Vesc ... even unsensored i think its buttery smooth

Center of gravity... mmmh compared to a street deck with 90mm PU wheels it feels like a monster truck, but 7inch to 8inch will not that much different IMO

Started a new tread with 80mm Outrunners on my DirectDrive with Vesc6, only started right now, need to extend the day to the double of hours to get it proceed soon :sunglasses:
Will do my best...

ive been running the mini direct drive now for quite some time on my trampa urban carver - in my eyes the spur drive isnt noisy at all and I really LOVE thats its essentially maintenance free so far. its capsuled very well, the rubber seal works like a charm, just every week I sprayed in some lubricant. it has become my bad weather board really, cause it just eats dirt, stones and spray without any effect. :heart_eyes:

BTW, how much of a difference does not having support bearings make between the mini and full size?  Does anyone use the mini on the full size (MTB) ultimate hangers?  ...the versatility is interesting...

...but even more interesting is the prospect of being able to run 80mm.  Is that something you're just having fun with or would you make an updated kit for 80mm motors?

Hey Jenso, 3 questions: How does your direct drive fare in the snow condition? And rain? 

In terms of lubrication, what're the frequencies of lubricating the gears?

Also, I could be wrong, but it looks trampa _might_ be phasing out their 12mm (infinity/vertigo) trucks.  It looks like their categories have been removed and stock hanger count for vertigo looked super low.  I think they might have bumped up the prices on the ultimate at the same time, as well, if my memory serves.

I think that would mean MTB boards would only have the ultimate trucks available pretty soon (once inventory is exhausted).   What impact (if any) would that have on the direct drive SKUs that you have available?  IE: does the full size DD work on the 16" MTB ultimate hangers (or could the mini-drive be beefed up w/ support bearings, etc)?

EDIT: my conclusions were incorrect re: the trucks.  They are just low stock.

Sorry missed that oer the weekend...
Last nice snow i see was as a child ... looong years back ... 
Rain is enough in Germany, but dont ride in it normaly

But i dont see any problems coming if you do, most parts are stainless steel or aluminium... the motorpulley can start to corosive ... but its sealed, the gears ale lubed... what should happen...

√Ñhm yeah lubrication about all 100km maybe, dont think much about... add some lately if it gets louder

yes trampa is low on stock on vertigo trucks, actually shipping with machined infinitys

So... now that you've had some time w/ the 80mm motors, would you recommend those for customers (...specifically for my build, over the 6374s :slight_smile: )?

(reminder: I'm the 140kg AT commuter... so, torque monster is good... but efficiency is a consideration as well...)

Thoughts on:
- Holy pro MTB w/ ultimate hanger on 7" wheels +
- Direct drive +
- 8072 185kv sensored APS motor 33mm x 10mm 
(finding out if it's possible now)
(let me know if there are better shaft dimensions to specify...or kv)
- Dual VESC 6s
- big ol' DIY battery (TBD) + 150A BMS

^ maybe 8" would be better w/ 80mm... but I think the 7" tires should have a better rolling efficiency.

...and last question (probably requires some speculation, but interested in your opinion)... any idea how the energy consumption between 63mm and 80mm motors might compare for a heavier rider?  I'd assume a smaller motor means less energy to move... but a bigger motor doesn't have to work as hard... sooo... :neutral_face:

Hey Dude (-;

i think that for heavy rider it can be no disadvantage to have some reserves ...
Cant say if you really need it, the complete build will get more expensive for sure...
Have to do this adapter plates, custom pulleys...
BTW no bad idea to make it 10mm Driveshaft , this way we could add keyways if you want
But have to charge them as extra costs, i just glue it with my 12mm shaft...

More thoughts : 
I would not choose the Ultimate... Go with Vertigo at least... maybe best to take the Infinity...
I would prefer 8inch wheels for ground clearence
Cant compare the actually Wh/km consumption...

Did i missed anything?

About how much more expensive :blush: ?  I might be having a derp moment, but why would 80mm need custom pulleys w/ the direct drive?  actually...where are pulleys used at all with the DD :confused: ?  ...if it's significantly more $$, maybe I'm better off w/ 6374s... but it sure is tempting!  I like the idea of being able to effortlessly go up hills, etc, and not sure if the 6374s might struggle a bit w/ extra weight + steeper inclines + warmer days...

I'm not sure I trust glue :), so I do like the idea of having keyways... but that might depend on if I get a standard SKU (6374) or if I get custom motors made (8072).

ultimate has a smaller diameter shaft, frank from trampa generally only recommends them for corrosion resistance against salt water... the steel ones are stronger :smiling_imp: English is a second language for jens, sometimes it is not perfect (that said his english is better than my german thankfully) He is referring to the motor spur gear.
& loctite works well, no drama with broken parts like keyways :wink: 
If money is a object I wouldn't build a emtb but my guess is factor in hundreds more for motors, mounts, spur gear and batteries.

Length of round Spacers are variable... here longer ones....

This can also be used for every Direct Drive if an addional Motorprotection is wanted.
(Only M4 threads will be outdrilled for 4.1mm)

This kind of protection can be problematic if the Trampa Hanger itself is not well aligned from one Axle to the other... but for the first 3 Dual Kits here i dont see big differences....
Some Kind of Copper "O-Rings" could be used if there are smaller alignment issues IMO

I would say its still the best Drivegear for hard Offroad use.. except for people who want a silent drive... thats the only downside that its louder

Jens,

Still messing around with the direct drive on carver while i get your belted drive.

So check this out... I get a grindy ride... i can't figure it out. Motor spur gear is set as far possible from POM drive gear without touching the sides...

With no rider it sounds fine - 

https://youtu.be/xS0771Hf3wM

But once i get on it... different story -

https://youtu.be/DWOLah3AD3Q

How does the spacing look?

When i put the spacers are they supposed to make the hub adapter flush? Or is the hub adapter supposed to be flush with the truck end (where the axle intersects the truck) before the spacer rings are even added?

Yep I did... and I pushed the whole assembly closer to the truck middle so that it is right up against the beginning of the milled flat part of the truck. The sound is a little smoother now.

EDIT: BTW that beat up part is from me just hand-turning the adapter trying to figure it out... not actually from riding.

Hey

Can you check for clearence without the housing?
Wheelgear mounted to Hub with Adapter, 4 shims .without the 1mm coverplate..  now you should see if there is clearence issue to the Motormount... also check by holding the housing next to it ... maybe the grinding is to the coverplate... the POM wheelgear shoud sit free on both sides...

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/0/2079aa603c1b6d5c48690a9801808545de7b9e59.JPG" width="666" height="500">

My guess is that you maybe grind in the area where it already looking beat up... 
Best would be to remove Motor and just mount the Wheelgear to the Hub and screw it on the axle... 
You should try to turn the wheel with some "load" on it "try to bent it by turning it" know what i mean... 
If there is some "contact/resitance" add one or two more shims and check if the grinding is gone...
If this is the case you could just move a little more outside with the complete Mount, as long there is enough room for the wheelnut...

Hope you could understand what i mean... let me know
```

Yes I do... I am trying:

1) Removing the coverplate but screwing back on the assembly -- then giving it a ride

2) Adding shims / move the mount further away from the center -- this suggests to me that that entire hub adapter should clear the end of the truck/axle intersection

EDIT: It is not #1... I removed the coverplate still the grind. I think I isolated the issue and it is #2 -- my distance from the edge to the circle is about 71-72mm. It's the hub adapter hitting the truck. I have to push entire mount much closer to the edge. It is what Jens you have suggested... now I have to re-test.

Might, but to be honest riding a Direct Drive feels like flying a Rocket (I guess ? never flew a Rocket). But it is for sure no Rocket Science in a Direct Drive.
And it would take away the last little handicraft LEGO tinkering feeling.

And Jenso is actually sending out an really inforamtive Step by Step manual via mail if you buy a direct drive

You guys bring up excellent ideas... the instructions Jens sends are very very good actually. Video sure why not... website... yes!

Look in the end though there is a slight engineering rubbing issue i faced with the mount on a mini trampa truck.

I had to make sure to get the hub adapter to clear and not rub while having enough room to get the wheel onto axle and having enough axles to screw the wheel on.  It looks perfect at about 66-67mm.

There will be very little axle left to properly get the screw on. It's still on there good enough..I can go another turn still..

Now the point is really moot because the truth is i ordered a street carver belt drive from Jenso for use with the new Gummies.

And this direct drive will be repurposed for my E-MTB board. Here as you can see thr direct drive will fit with so so much room to spare:

My build is almost ready (btw i enjoy the carver the most, compared to my emtb the stance is so much more fun -- my legs get tired on the emtb quickly). Just need to swap out the direct drive for the carver mount. And a few more small steps.

Yeah I spent a lot of bling $$$ this year on those  (2) boards. Not building anything else for a long time... lol.

 Maybe a penny board down the road that fits in my backpack  <--- addict speaking right here

Hey

I think a nice combo for you could be the Mini Direct Drive.
You can use Wheels from 5Inch/Gummies up to 7 or 8 Inch
You got an 1:4 reduction, fully sealed agianst dirt.

You could mount it on Trampas Mini Truck, with this the Motor is limited to 6355

You could also Mount it on Regular Truck, now the Motorlength is open up to for example 6384, like here :
 
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/trampa-streetcarver-e-toxx-minidirectdrive-mtb-trucks-gummies-6384-12s/36217/17

If you decide for the Regular Trampa Truck i could offer you also a new variete of the Mini Direct Drive with a supportbearing inside the Wheelspur, like in my Regular Direct Drive... ONLY for MTB Hanger

There is a big fat spacer in between the wheel and the rest of the truck. Replace that spacer with a bearing and a washer, problem solved. The rest depends on the mounting system and how far you are able to move it towards the center of the truck.

Already seeing that the asking price of this direct drive is more than fair by the way. Components wise/developing my own drive, I would already spend around 150 Euro on a solution that I would consider n00b level. Take into account the hours Jens spent developing and refining such a drive, along with needing all the equipment to manufacture at a high precision. 

What I can come up with would not be as good as this drive, while spending a good amount of money and time. For science though.

Hey i missed this ...

I take for everything this : 
http://www.maedler.de/product/1643/1624/569/loctite-243-mittelfeste-schraubensicherung

Except for glueing Motorspurs to Motorshaft, i take this instead : 
http://www.maedler.de/product/1643/1624/574/loctite-603-oeltolerantes-fuegeprodukt

Hope that helps

Cheers
Jens
