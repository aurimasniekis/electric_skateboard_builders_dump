Hey, Guys (and Girls), 


As the title said, I have a pair of brand new Hummie hubs for sale. I’m selling those because my plan has quite changed in the time they got here. 

Price is 550 + Shipping.

I’ve tested them on the bench and add some 5.5mm bullet. (also come with the centrax wheel and paris truck for the front)

There on default in the paint, but it doesn’t affect the performance at all, and can easily be covert with some black paint.

Thanks, Guys.

I’m finding myself reasons to not buy them. 

Where are you reasons? Where?
