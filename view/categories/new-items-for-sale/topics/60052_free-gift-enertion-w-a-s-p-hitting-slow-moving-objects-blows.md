We understand the skepticism regarding shipping - but good news, we've got nano-X (and all other accessories listed, except for FOCBOX due on the 29th June), in stock and ready to ship.

We are expecting a huge volume of orders during this period, so as always placing an order sooner will mean your order is shipped quicker.

Are the rspec frontwheels also usable for a non raptor board? 
So buying 2 sets of them so you would have four of them?

I believe they are mostly identical to Ollin Popocas. Seems like a killer deal. I have read though that theyâ€™re not easily compatible with standard kegel pulleys because they have a deeper core. Not sure if thatâ€™s for sure or not but itâ€™s been said.

Why does the shipping cost fluctuate? Fixed shipping for (1) Nano X is $14, but it's $28 for (2). Fixed has a different meaning in Oz?

Yep the hot price is better than what people buying 10 would usually pay with bulk discount pricing - so it's a massive sale!

We have approximately 200 Nano-X left in stock, so as long as you get in today or tomorrow you should be fine.

Anyone can offer inputs on the wheels? How do they compare to let's say, normal flywheels and the popocas?
```

That comparison is moot - they're 22â‚¬ (~45â‚¬ with shipping)!
Popocas are 104US$ to Germany

Aside from the price, anyone who has ridden these wheels can offer any inputs? Urethane, ride quality, chunking issues etc.
