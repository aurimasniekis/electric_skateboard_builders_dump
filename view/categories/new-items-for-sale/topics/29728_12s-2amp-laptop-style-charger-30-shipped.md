For sale here is a brand new never used 12s (50.4v) 2 amp charger.  It carries the standard dc laptop style plug but you can splice in any plug you want.  US plug, seems to be very high quality, tough plastic and everything feels solid.  Designed to charge lithium type batteries (both lipo and li-ion and others) to 4.2v with safety cutoff.  LED indicator to tell you when its charged as well.

Purchased for $36 plus shipping but found out I wont be able to fit 12S in my enclosure so I went down to 11S and bought a new charger.  My loss is your gain!

Cheers, PM me or respond here if you are interested! :slight_smile:

Sure am, international first class is about $14, i'll cover $5 of that (included in the $30) so your total would be $39 shipped to NZ.  Does that sound good?
