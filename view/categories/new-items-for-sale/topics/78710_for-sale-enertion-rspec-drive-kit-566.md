Thank you. That‚Äôs what I thought.  

For the life of me I couldn‚Äôt figure out why anyone would think we‚Äôd pay full price, when we can buy from (and support) enertion, instead.

Then I saw this is listed by a 13-year old?  

Who has already posted out here, publicly, that his parents do not know what he‚Äôs up to?

@onloop What is our policy on minors buying and trading electric vehicles on your forum, here?

Friends, I‚Äôm no attorney and nor do I pretend to be one, yet I know liability when I see it.  

One of you guys sells this little boy high-speed parts and he hurts himself, his parents (and very specifically their insurance company) will be _very_ interested in a talk.  Maybe your house, too.  

For buyers, an online click-through contract (e.g., PayPal terms and conditions) with a minor is not enforceable in the US. 

No offense Alan. We‚Äôre trying to protect a community that takes a ton of risks as it is with legislation at state and local levels.  

We lose friends out here for real, son.  Almost one year ago to the day the very man who invited me to this forum died - and Derek was more dedicated to the cause than most of us could _ever_ be.  

Community; you‚Äôve been advised. Thank you.

Haha, nope thinking of just closing this thread

The original reason I wanted to sell was because my tb vesc did not have long enough phase wires and I did not want to mod it, but I still ended up modding my the vesc and everything fits now.

Also wouldn't it be a liability if a product fails and severly hurts a person like the boosted bearing fails?

There's basically no difference from me buying a product from another person buying the same product

Except I'm less likely to get more injured but from that aside, I don't see any liability.

Creativity shouldn't be limited by a age factor, I am a human and so are you, plain and simple you might be older than me but I might be smart than you.

In my books that's his fault especially if he bought it from a privat vendor. If he buys a vesc from someone and it fails because he shorted to phase wires it's his fault.

I think it would be a grave error to put restrictions on minors here, nothing here is illegal and therefore selling and buying shouldn‚Äôt be restricted either. A person can buy and sell at any age. Only thing that might need an age restriction is group buys. I‚Äôm only saying this cause I‚Äôve seen many threads where people try and put restrictions on the youth, rather than help them avoid mistakes. There‚Äôs kids building nuclear powered machines at 14 I think an electric skateboard isn‚Äôt that bad

Except the fact that I can go shoot guns with my parents

And people on this fourm are complaining about me buying "mode of transportation" parts

Also if your so worried about me getting hurt than question Best buy and boosted why they would allow me to walk straight into best buy and buy a boosted stealth that goes 24mph if I wanted to, I actually tried this and they brought the boosted stealth out.

Alan, please understand that everything stated here is not intended to dimish you in any way. 

I hold you in high regard, despite your comment regarding @BigBoyToys, RIP. We‚Äôll allow you to delete that comment and start over, if you‚Äôd like, because we‚Äôve all been 13 years old, too (to state the obvious). 

Let your insensitive comment regarding Derek stand and I‚Äôm afraid you will prove why we need a minor policy site-wide, outside of Marketplace. 

Derek set world records. We‚Äôre not your parents and certainly aren‚Äôt trying to be, yet please understand, none of us will ever believe you know esk8 like Derek did, respectfully. 

My advisement, however, stands to the _adults_ on our forum: https://www.doityourself.com/stry/legal-issues-when-selling-a-car-to-a-minor

So to summarize. 

This is the law and not subjective, but objective, and does not only apply to us, but all adults entering into all sales contracts with all minor children in the US.  

Esk8 is inherently dangerous and we know we will all get hurt, sometime.  It is inevitable.

Can you get your mom or dad to make an account to handle your buying and selling?  With their PayPal?  To protect our community?
```

Your link to the car is 90% irrelevant, buying a car and esk8 parts is totally different, a car is a commuter tool and not a toy while esk8 on the other hand could be classified as a toy. And many people do still classify the boosted board as a toy (more than likely is due to it's power)

If I buy a car and the power steering fails and I get hurt and the problem was not know, about by the original owner does the person who sold it to me take liability. No

Isdnt it the same with esk8??

Point proven??

Also if my parents did not know about the dangers of esk8 why In hell would they allow me to store boards and parts at home and ride my board to school?

I'll just avoide esk8 sellers in the EU than, hehe
I'm pretty sure no one who owns a second hand car would file a lawsuite against the original owner for a problem that was unknown, if the problem was know, than the original owner might have some problems on thrit hands.

well, not that it matters, but here its different (eventhough we are in europe, BE still has different laws).
Yes, original manu might be responsible for something that breaks after purchase like you said, but (second hand) seller is responsible for stuff breaking right after or what was already broken but not seen (or deliberatly hidden). It depends case per case.
