I have a pair of freebord binding that is absolutely new(with the swag, instruction , a CD, and the original box). It hasn't even been mounted on a board. I am using deck with deep drop downs and they don't work for me.

 If you get one shipped right now, it will cost you $70. I am offering at $60 shipped. 

I would have put it lower but unfortunately I got the plastic part and metal parts separately(I had thought I would make my own metal base) and paid twice for shipping.

You'll have to add holes or stand on your board real funny like.
These are intended to share mounting hardware with trucks. But it's definitely not necessarily the only option.

If you need mr60 and or charging port connectors or some small 3D printed part, I can include them in to sweeten the deal.
