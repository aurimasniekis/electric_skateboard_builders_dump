Hey everyone!  

In stock and shipping now. This batch I only made them in blue and red since that's what got the most interest, but I'll have a few more colors to choose from in the next run. If you PM me this holiday weekend, I'll send you a discount code for free shipping if you're in the U.S.

I've got a bunch of the adjustable baseplates ready to go out. 

These are designed to fit: 

**TorqueBoards DD**

Excellent, have not been able to get adjustable baseplates from Surf-Rodz RKP forever!  These look awesome and will slow me to finally get some of these hub motors onto different decks, like trampa and @kaly  etc!

What configuration are you interested in? TB/Carvon, Caliber, SR, Raptor?

Only a couple of TB/Carvon left. Running low on SR.

ah yeah, depends on how quickly this run sells out. purple goes well with green though, kind of like the joker.

Wouldn't the Caliber one work with Carvon because the hanger has the same geometry?

My calibers adjustable baseplates are about 14mm taller than my fixed baseplates. @drangboards 
Which just happens to be like the exact size Riser I was using.
Still getting some things adjusted just wanted to get them on to see how they fit.

Quality is top notch.  cleaner than my surfrodz tkp one.
I'll probably use them on a different build seeing this is a slower budget build.  But they cam in the mail and i used to test them out.

2.25" Surf Rodz kingpin, but you can also use a regular kingpin with a mtb bearing or axel spacer. You would put this between a flat washer and the head of the kingpin. Trampa sells a bunch

Do we need to loctite the SR kingpin? Or does the bushing compression prevent it from backing out?

When are you going to do another run

I've been so busy at work. I'll get a pre-order thread up this week. A few people have asked already. All I need is 10 orders to make it happen. I think we'll get there.

@directC actually, if the TB truck fits a caliber baseplate, you might be in luck
