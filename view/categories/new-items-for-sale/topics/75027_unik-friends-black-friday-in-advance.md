of course mate, most of the UNiK family of riders is spread all around the world but I do very limited if no communication on my parts due to the very limited amount of time I got. I just enjoy riding lots of diversity, improving my parts, keeping them minimalist and helping people around me.

Just finished to assemble this board for a guy. Probably the last custom I build with so much details. That was a journey.
