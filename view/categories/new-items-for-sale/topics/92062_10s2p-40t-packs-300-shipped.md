I'm not personally selling these, but I thought i'd let you guys know meepo boards is.

Probably an exceedingly good pack for light commuters, using a pretty rare cell too.

Nice, that's something new yeah.
The 40T cells are really awesome and so powerfull.
I have a commuter board with 10S2P 40T and I can really recommend these cells :ok_hand:

I linked this pack to another user yesterday in my build thread and since then started thinking if I should upgrade from the 10s2p Sanyo pack to this pack. I would be able to go from 32Amps to 60Amps and my dual 6354 would no longer be bottlenecked by the battery. It's very similar to the other pack so it would be a plug and play upgrade.

After considering it I'm worried that even tho they are both ~8Ah capacity once I have the torque available from 30A battery max on each VESC my range will go down considerably with this new pack.

I didn't realize you stopped.  Why aren't you doing packs anymore?

I just got caught up with my job, I felt like I couldn‚Äôt put as much time into packs as I would like. The second that happened, I just pulled the plug. 

But I think I can pick it back up if people want some unique 40t packs.

Depending on the price I think I would take a brick pack from the returned legend himself üòÅ

Hmm it will cost a lot but a 10s4 or 5p should be good for a MOuntain board with a very light rider?
