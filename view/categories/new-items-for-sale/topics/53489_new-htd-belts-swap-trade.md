So I accidentally ordered the wrong belt and  and now have 4 belts that are too short for my board I have 2 305mm-5m-15mm and 2 310mm-5m-15mm.  I'm looking for a 320mm-5m-15mm belt.  I figured there have been several people who have ordered the wrong belts and after @Scoo_B_SK8 suggested it I made the thread for people who bought the wrong belt size and need a different size to swap.

Good thread cause figuring out belt sizes will leave you with  extra belts lol 

Just ordered 350-5m-12mm for my 16/60t gearing let's see if that works lol

Awesome thread idea. I'm sure a ton of us have bought the wrong size, have spares leftover from switched gearing, bought extras, or have some we just no longer use. I just got rid of my 3m spares, but I'm sure I'll F something up and come into possession of other spares in the future lol

Itâ€™s ok thanks I was hoping to trade because it basically will cost me more to return these belts.

Looking for a pair of 420's.
In case this last sentence attracted the attention of the police, I have to say I'm speaking about HDT5M-15 belts :slight_smile:

I have a pair of 460's and a pair of 385's I have no longer any use for.

@Eric527 do you want bad rep for the company you most likley are involved with or do you just hate it?

Either way it's working!![Screenshot_Chrome_20190801-140646|281x500](upload://zKKa0NMT192xw2FSO71MCnyLLBs.png)
