I actually like this deck very much.  I've been hassling all sorts of chinese companies to send me samples of carbon decks.  They are not silly though and were asking astronomical prices.. Guess I'm not the only one trying it on lol
It apparently comes with a top piece and insert for the escs according to my research but I'm sure once Phoenix has put our replies through the translator she will elaborate.

Thanks for becoming a part of this forum Phoenix and welcome!
As I said I like this deck but for me the battery enclosure would need to be at least 140mm wide to incorporate a flat double width 18650 pack.  The length is perfect for 10s or 12s 4p but at 115mm its too narrow.   Also dimensions of the esc casing would be good so we can see what we can squeeze in there.

How thick is there big panel and what is the material?  If it's silicon in be concerned about it breaking as there will be substantial weight on it.

Its the same concept as the teamgee.  Board essentially becomes the battery and you really only have day to day access to the esc's  Nice and stealth but too limiting on battery choice imo
Anyone with a bit of lipo pouch knowledge should be fine but hard cells look like an issue.  Don't think there is enough depth or width.  Good option for those countries that have banned or restricted eskating though.

If the lipo battery is listed as having a 115mm length, would that fit in the deck or does that length not include the tabs?
