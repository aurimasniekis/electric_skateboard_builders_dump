Hey mate, very interested. Just a bit apprehensive about the Flex 1 deck. How do you find it?

I'm not sure what you mean by "how do I find it?"

Most flex one goes for about $220 with out any of the other accessories. I can however throw in another board - [Powell Peralta Kevin Reimer Samurai Skateboard](https://powell-peralta.com/powell-peralta-kevin-reimer-samurai-skateboard-deck-10-x-36-75) at no extra cost or if you prefer, the [Bustin Ibach X series](http://dev.bustinboards.com/ibach-longboard-details).

I was referring to how you found the flex - stiff or still nice despite being the firmest end of the scale.

Actually don’t worry about it. I’m pretty convinced. If you’re happy to throw in the Powell board it’s a deal. Im brand new to this forum so have no idea how to direct message. Any chance you could send me a message so we can get the payment going.

I weight 92 kgs naked. It still has some flex but not to the point of being floppy if that makes sense. (Was just testing it via standing and doing slight bounce, as the board is still unused)

I was new to the scene and thought I knew what I wanted via reading only, but after some experience and better understanding of what exactly I needed, what I was looking for gradually changed and also there were new items entering the market such as Trampa board's Gummies and SuperFly which obviously would mean problems with wheel bite, hence the reason I have a couple of boards that I'm not using.

I will reply to your message and we can take from there on :)

It has been sold. Why were you banned?

And ARCBR was not asking where to find the board :rofl:
