My build is on hold for now due to unridable winter weather conditions in Finland, hence why selling my Focbox Unity. _(ps. Moving in with my gf and in dire need of cash for furniture! ***cough*** curtains ***cough*** :smiley: This hobby is expensive! )_

Asking for 300â‚¬ plus shipping within EU. Paid around 50â‚¬ on import tax on this and 260â‚¬ first batch pre-order from Enertion, oh boy. 
Still in its' original box and completely unused. Accepting Paypal Payments for now only.
