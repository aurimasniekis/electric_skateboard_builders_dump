I have for sale a 3D printed VESC enclosure for the vanguard. File [here](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1817161)

It was printed from Fictiv using PLA. I ended up getting an enclosure from @MBuilder so no use for this anymore. Bought it for $100, send me offers. It can fit one VESC comfortably, idk about 2. Or can serve as a mold for making your own (the extra space will allow for 2 VESCs).

I've had hit and miss experiences with 3D Hubs. I printed a sparkle remote for ~$20 but it came out completely warped
