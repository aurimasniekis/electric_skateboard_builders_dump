I already have an electronic mtb which was my very first project.  I figured that I dont need another electronic skateboard. I have the tendency to collect and I try my best to be a hunter and not a gatherer. Also I suffer from OCD (not trying to sound cool here - Im a mad man) and figuring cable-management and how to charge the batteries in the most elegant way is fucking with my head.
