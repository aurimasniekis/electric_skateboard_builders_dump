Hey esk8 peeps. I've decided to side with belt over direct drive going forward so this NEW CarvOn V4 drive is up for sale. I'm including the better fitting ABEC adapters made by another forum member (@PXSS ) with it ($50 Value).

$600 shipped in the US. $580 pick up. Just what you see in the picture

Mike those weren't made or designed by me. They were designed by someone else I can't remember their name though
