When your Switch was on/on Switch and the 4 Pin was for 12v for LED 
you must bringing the Output  Volt
down to 12V with resistor.
Than can you using the Switch.

Those switches look real nice. Can it accept a higher rated fuse? I'm running regular 12s car esc's and sometimes see up to 60 amps peak in my street boards and even higher in my AT board.

I running my Trampa with 10S but with dual VESC,
i have not found bigger Fuse than 40A,
but i think 50-60A was not problem.
You can buy min middle and big Fuse 
the big going up to 80A
Benjamin have say the Switch can working higher A than 40A.
But I have not tried it yet.

You can have the SparcProtectionSwitch with 2 Fuse Holder.
This was the second version, that you can take the Fuse
outside from the Battery Box.

Sorry, habe ich vergessen dazu zu schreiben,
die on/on Schalter die ich benutze sind für 230V
aber die Spannung von dem Schalter ist nicht relevant.
Viel wichtiger ist die on/on Schaltung

I've done some test with the Anti spark
 and detected that when you leave the switch on
and then connected the Anti spark with the VESC/ESC
You became a lightning and then the zener diodes burns through.
Even if the cable and switch not connected to Anti spark
you became the same resultant.
This is due to the construction no production error.
When the diode is broken You can get the anti spark turn off.
You can see on the Picture what diode i mean.

Hey no disrespect but I noticed on a couple of posts of yours that you use "become" in a way you would use the German "bekommen" - this is not the case however. "Become" means "werden" in German. "Bekommen" should be translated with "get".
That will make your posts a lot clearer.
