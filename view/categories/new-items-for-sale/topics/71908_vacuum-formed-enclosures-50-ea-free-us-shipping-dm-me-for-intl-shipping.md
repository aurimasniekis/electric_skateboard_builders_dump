Hello,

I recently made my own vacuum formed enclosures and I wanted to see if anyone else was interested in having me make an enclosure for them.

If you send me money using Goods & Services on PayPal please send an additional $3 to cover fees.

The current options I have are listed below, but I can make new molds so please let me know what molds you would like to see next!  All I need is a deck to sacrifice so I can make it into a mold, however I can make a mold for a flat deck just by using plywood.

**Concave Double Stack Enclosure 19"5.5"x1.5" Interior Dimensions 8"x22"x2"  External Dimensions**

**38 Switchblade Double Stack Enclosure 19"x5.5"x1.5" Interior Dimensions 8"x22"x2"  External Dimensions**

**Flat Double Stack Enclosure 19"x5.5"x1.5" Interior Dimensions 8"x22"x2"  External Dimensions**
**Flat Single Stack Enclosure 19"x5.5"x1" Interior Dimensions 8"x22"x2"  External Dimensions**
**Mini Double Stack Enclosure 10"x5.5"x1.5" Interior Dimensions 8"x13"x2"  External Dimensions**
(No pictures of these three enclosure yet, but I already have the molds made and they will look very similar to the others just with different dimensions.

![IMG_2891|500x500](upload://yFbm1h8V3864yKVvfsEhPdDOqeV.jpeg) 

The double stack enclosures call all easily fit a 12s5p battery, BMS and 2 FOCBoxes while the flat enclosure can fit a 12s4p battery, BMS and 2 FOCBoxes.

The material used is 1/8" thick ABS plastic. I formed them using in a shop using a high quality vacuum forming table and I cut them out using a band saw before sanding the edges with a stationary disk sander.  I chose the Robot and Switchblade for my first molds because the 38 Switchblade is my favorite eSkate deck and I had a spare Robot deck lying around that is perfect for any generic concave deck.

I use PG7 cable glands for waterproofing around motor leads.  Should be 100% splash proof with gaskets.

Well I need to be able to cut out the deck and make a mold out of it like this. ![IMG_2898|375x500](upload://xBS21GHZ4PGUV4m6aZsKNBXcIM.jpeg)
I then cut off either end so it can fit on the vac table.
