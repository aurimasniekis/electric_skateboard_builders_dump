These mounts are made by @Rithblu and seem solid AF

As long as we're talking trampa, I don't suppose anyone has some spring trucks they'd be willing to sell me?

I've got Trampa trucks and chaindrive I keep going back and forth on whether I wanna sell or not. Don't wanna hijack Acido's thread though. I'll start one here as soon as I get a minute.

Thanks, I'll keep an eye out. I'm less interested in the chain drive, just need the trucks.
