You must be a level two user to sell items. I'm sorry to have to enforce this though, because those mounts look fantastic! I'll re-open the topic as soon as you're level two, just PM me or another moderator. In the meantime you could try selling on eBay... I'm sure they'd go like hotcakes.

The mount holes are really nice to have if you have a small supply of Ti bar stock, which incidentally I do üî®

Any idea of their size, those little unused holes? 4mm? If so a 5mm bar threaded on each end to 4mm thread should work well

I only have three 8mm rods = 5/16", the rest are 5mm or 10mm+ 

I doubt I could bore to 4mm successfully with a drill press with a 5mm rod so 8mm it is, will have to get the drill press over an opening to take the rods as well. Oh to have a lathe. You thread by hand, never use the tailstock on the lathe?

Hey @Rithblu, how did you personally install your mounts on the infinity trucks? When I go to to tighten them, they keep moving because the set screws are angled and cause the whole mount to ‚Äúwalk‚Äù causing me to lose my mount adjustment.

And here‚Äôs my board with your mounts mocked up! Looking good so far!

I'm Sorry man didn't realize you had the infinity trucks, the clamps was made for a Vertigo Truck but there not much difference besides the I.D.  is little bigger on the infinity trucks I was told by banjaxxed . it shouldn't  be able to move if the set screws are  really tight.

I have both types of trampa trucks, Infinity and Vertigo. Just to set it straight on which is which, Infinity are the ones I had a problem with, they are the solid type -

http://www.trampaboards.com/infinity-trucks--solid-hanger-body-with-12mm-solid-axles--mega-strong-p-11151.html

Vertigo slid along a little more, they are the ones with the hollow axle and cutaways -
http://www.trampaboards.com/vertigo-trucks--12mm-hollow-axle--cnc-lightened-with-powder-coated-baseplate-p-11149.html

Pretty sure @mxrider9239 has the solid Infinity truck, so yeah same issue , I did notice the grub screws were at an angle to the truck, tightening the shit out of them and lociting would be the way forward but maybe something to consider in future designs

Ahh I didn‚Äôt even know they were different, but the issue isn‚Äôt getting the grub screws tight, it‚Äôs keeping my measurement/adjustment of my motor mount WHILE I‚Äôm tightening the grub screws. Since it‚Äôs angled it‚Äôs acting like a little wheel moving the entire mount down the truck @Rithblu @banjaxxed

You could try clamping some wood to either side as you tighten it to stop it slipping.

If you're running dual motors you could do the bracing between the two motors other people have posted images for.

Assuming you don't have tilting milling table to hand, some would jus go at it with a drill on a guessimation, it would not be be perfectly dead on to be an improvement

Well of course the part need to be fixtured at the correct angle a simple vice could hold that at the right angle it's only aluminium.

They are not for drilling the part completely, they are for making an accurate center hole which guides the drill bit afterwards, they cost $4 delivered, HSS, but yeah not much point unless in a drill press at least

Yes (if we are looking at the green lines) that should hopefully be good, and if you leave the previous holes (red lines) those can be used as additional points to hold the entire bracket. 

But that‚Äôs obviously up to you if you want to drill and tap four holes as opposed to two.

That's it really, and if anyone wants to use the existing grubs screws(at an angle) then they can, but yeah the ones straight on would be the preferred choice. I can understand how the mounts could work loose given there is no bracing bars but then we didn;t pay for them ;)

And new grub screw holes can be done to existing stock without destroying the nice anodizing

Ok so got the new mounts in and fitted them onto my trucks and having the grub screws like that is perfect. Barely moved at all when tightening the screws up. I would definitely suggest adding those screw holes to the ones you have and future ones, or continue to make them with the new screw holes. (Obviously it‚Äôs up to you lol) 
But they worked like a charm! Now I just need to wait for my belts so I can tighten it all down

Rithblu,

I would like a set of bars to give a try and I will provide review and documentation.  You recently manufactured the 2mm by 2mm custom axle mounts.  I was very impressed with the quality of you craftsmanship.  I also would like a few extra screws flat-head and round head.  When I tighten down the motor the mounts I had a little trouble loosing and now one of the screw heads is stripped (MY FAULT!!!)  Here are a few pics.... he distance between the outside edges of the motor mount is 8 1/2 "

I've never had the ATS 12 trucks, but I have a set of ATS. Some guy at MBS told me they were same dimensions, but that was a year or so ago. 

The ATS are not great trucks, they are severally unbalanced.  But for a cruising board where you want numies in asphalt they are fine.

@Rithblu the only reason I switched the trucks around was because it was easier to modify the caliber 2 clamp I already had to fit the trucks. I would prefer the back truck with the screw holes for the brake to be in the back. I see the pics and that looks great!

I don't understand both of my ats trucks look the same. You could have brakes on either as they are identical. The teardrop clamp looks good and it seems like it could be used for 15mm and 20mm wheel gears. Not sure what width gears I may end up with yet. Still shopping for them on the forum

If both of your trucks have a screw hole like the pic below, then you have 2 rear trucks. It‚Äôs not a big deal as both will roll in either direction. Lol. The clamp that @Rithblu is creating is going to work well for the rear ATS trucks. Since you have 2 rears, yours will work on either truck! Also I recommend 20mm pulleys if you‚Äôre setting up a Trampa style board, but for an esk8 15mm is plenty and costs less. Just my 2 pennys. ![image|666x500](upload://9TMTcji5KxIGnOTUZYpwssfiIRH.jpg)

Agreed ...20mm wide belts are better for durability  and high current draws with massive amounts of torque.  Guess I need rods for 20mm gears as that seems to be the industry standard for emtb

No pulley/belts at this time .

The clamps for the mounts and cross bar I have to custom make, the cross bar is a little tricky because I don't know how long to make it to your pacific setup.  I would recommend that you get the mounts, pulley, belt first installed get everything where it need to be and aligned , so you can get better measurement for the cross bar.

Unfortunately going that low will limit the size of pulley you would be able to use. Like for instance am using a 72t wheel pulley won't work for me. I guest it would be good for those using smaller wheel pulley's. I have to think about it some more.

I'm using a 25mm x8mm shoulder bolt with 6mm threads along with some washers and speed rings . Only other option was a 30mm shoulder bolt and alot of speed rings. 20mm x 8mm Idler pulleys are from eBay and are 25mm wide. I'm gearing down because I'm using 245kv motors with hobby king 150a esc's and don't want to go over 20 mph offroad. If I jump up to a higher .pinion it will make the idler pulley's work even better with a better angle of attack. 3d printed MBS wheel pulley's can be had for $30.00 off of the Evolve website

So longer motor plates seems better for those wanting idlers and to run gears larger than 72t.  Also looks like motor mount area is slightly taller which will give more room for support rods when motor can is in the furthest back position.  Now we can run bigger rods without hitting the motor can. I think I need these already!!! Beautiful work

Very nice, wish I could machine stuff.
I'm on too tight a budget to buy one from place like 3D Servisas so I went and got one of these of Ebay. Will cut off the end prongs to make it mountable.

Not really sure how much I would sell it for, as off right know it‚Äôs for my own personal build. 
I‚Äôm working with a 2 axis Bridgeport mill takes to much time to make things I can probably make more if people are willing to wait for them to be make.

Sorry to be a bother, but im building my first Trampa build well 2 actually in one hit, 1 for me and 1 for my brother, i have run into an issue for choosing a Motor mount and came accross these ones here on the forum which look well priced for what you get. i was wondering if you or anyone could answer a couple of questions i had please.

1) would you or anyone know if these mounts will work with these motors - Turnigy SK8 6374-192KV Sensored Brushless Motor (14P)

2) since building my first build, choosing pullys and belts is a troublesome thought to get it right. i was wondering how you chose yours as the belts and pullys have different teeth lengths and widths. is there set ones that are used in mountain boards particularly. was wondering where you got them from as i rather have them made of metal and not plastic for the pullys i mean.

Thank you in advanced!

ok thank you, im also located in Australia, i was wondering if you sold the crossbars outside of the US as i see on your site it says US Only. im interested in getting 2 kits from you as im building 2 Trampa Builds. is there a specific truck that is required for these mounts to work?

I do but its need to be custom cut to the length for your setup.
For a Trampa build you'll need the  VERTIGO ATB TRUCK I believe mxrider9239 used the INFINITY ATB TRUCK it was a tight fit but he made it work.

you can use this site to calculate length belt you may need  https://sdp-si.com/eStore/CenterDistanceDesigner

Sample... by changing  Pulley A(Motor Pulley)   and Pulley B(Wheel Pulley) you'll get the size belt you need.

how would you determine the number of groves, sorry for the silly question but i cant seem to find the answer on Trampa website for the Pulleys.

this is what i was going to use for the pullys. its just finding the correct belts is troublesome.

Can anyone answer this for me? From a custom.

So I have not even really thought about gears yet, but we are planning on running both Trampa Gummies (urban) and 8" Pneumatics (offroad) The config is going to be 12s AWD with 4 6374s and two Flipsky 6.6 Dual Plus VESCs. I want great torque with decent top end 25-30mph minimum. Any idea if 72T would be ideal for this application? Thanks!

Oh and I weigh 230lbs

@Rithblu I don't see why not. I'm running dual 6374s on 10s with 70T gears on 8" tires and it climbs hills without any trouble.
Granted I'm about half your weight, but as long as you're not expecting massive range it sounds like that set up should have plenty of torque.

I'm currently running dual 170kv 6374's 72/16 with 8" tires on 10s. Top speed 26mph and I havent found a hill that slows it down. 12s should give you 32-34mph with more torque than you need. 72/20 will also do about 41-42pmh. I have a few new sets of 72t aluminum pulleys for mbs 5 star pattern hubs if you're interested.
