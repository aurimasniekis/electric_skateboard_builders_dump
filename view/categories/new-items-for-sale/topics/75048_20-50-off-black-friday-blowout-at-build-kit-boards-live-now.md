What I mean is that is it worth paying some extra premium for BKB over Flipsky, even though these probably come out from the same factory, and quality _should_ be same. These type of motor are all over Alibaba, Aliexpress, etc. So from a consumer stand point, I'd pick the cheaper one.

I think an extra $4 is worth US customer support, a usable shaft for eSk8 (keyway and flats), and the right sensor connector (as theirs is likely not plug and play with VESC). 

Yes they look similar, idk if they are the same or not. There are so many different motor options available now.

Bkb is one of the top sellers around here for good reason. 
His black Friday prices are dope.
If  you're not here to purchase Move Along. Go buy hummie hubs then or the new raptor hubs.
You realize almost everything esk8 is made in China and resold elsewhere at a profit.  Even those raptor hubs....

Almost all motors are made by Maytech.  The difference is when you buy local you get the support.  I have bought Maytech rebranded motors from Eskating.eu and street-wing.  I know they are all the same motor but being able to pick the phone up or write a message to Luke at Streetwing is something you don't get with other vendors.

Now back on topic, that's some good prices on those motors man
