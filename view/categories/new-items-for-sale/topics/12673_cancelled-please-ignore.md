Hobbyking has 8awg silicon wire for like 3â‚¬ per meter. Is your cable that much better that it justifies the hassle?

Good point. These are the reasons why I'm doing this:
- I'm going to buy 10mm2 and 6mm2 wires in my big TME order anyway
- Will be almost the same for me to get 5m from there than 2 meters from hobbyking ( lol )
- Shipping TME->ME is cheaper than HOBBYKING->ME

And if there is more people, prices are gonna be even lower, so why not.
If noone is interested ( looks like ), I will order it only for myself.
