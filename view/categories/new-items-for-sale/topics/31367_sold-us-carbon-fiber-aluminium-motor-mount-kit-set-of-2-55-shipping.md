I have a set of carbon fiber & aluminum motor (63mm) mount kits I purchased for a project, but then never got to installing.  The mounts include all the hardware necessary to mount a motor. They have never been used, and are still in the bags with all the screws and bolts. The motor mount is carbon fiber, and the clamp is black anodized aluminum. 

For some reason the camera on my phone is not working, but I will try to post pictures as soon as possible. 

Selling the pair for $55+ Shipping. I'm shipping from Chicago, IL for reference. I believe I can fit them into a USPS Flat Rate box for $7.

I can have them shipped within 24 hours after the payment processes. (PayPal)

I'll take them off your hands, got pics to confirm it's what I'm thinking of?

I might be interested in one of them. Are you selling them as a package only? Can you
also send pics so I can see what they look like?

I'd rather keep them as a set, but depending on if they don't sell, I'd be willing to sell them individually.

Ok, just message me when you want to sell it individually. I'm in no hurry so don't feel the need to rush it.
