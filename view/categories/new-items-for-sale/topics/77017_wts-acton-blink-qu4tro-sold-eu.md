In all seriousness how did you end up with the board? Its a bit old by now isnt it, I genuinely dont know how much it would be. Its easily outperformed by the $800 4wd meepo awd, but I know it costs quite a lot more

So what is your starting price. The forum states that you have to give a price you want it for in the currency you want it for.

Thats quite a high price for quite an old and out performed board. :slight_smile: Just trying to tell you that your set price is quite high. No need to be rude about it.:salt::salt:

Well, I guess your potential buyer went to buy the Meepo :joy:
Sorry about that :joy:
You need to be more polite in the future, so your buyers don't run away

Yeah obviously, but on internet, reacting like that against troll is only going to encourage them !
But they had points, you need to specify the price, and asking the brand new price for this is not recommended, we're talking MTB price range, for an Acton board ! And if it's been sitting there, the battery needs some time to be looked out, and if it has been used, the price would be way less !

What do you mean? 1400€ shipped is way way WAY lower than the  brand price. 
The board is still sealed in box and the batteries come at low voltage. It does not need to be taken care of at all. Are you siding with mere trolls for specific reason?
