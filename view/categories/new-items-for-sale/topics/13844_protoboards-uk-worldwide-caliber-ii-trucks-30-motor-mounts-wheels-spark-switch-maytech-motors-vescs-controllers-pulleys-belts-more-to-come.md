Why not sell to whole EU as long as it is still relatively simple :stuck_out_tongue:
Nice looking mount :thumbsup: did you think about manufacturing it completely out of aluminum?

Haha, thanks for pointing that out.
I should be able to sell to the whole of the EU within about a week or two, I just need to sort out a few things with shipping services. The mount is made up 2 parts, the truck clamp (100% aircraft aluminium) and the part the motor mounts onto (100% Carbon Fibre Sheet).
MayTech manufactures the VESC.

Yeah, there is an apparent lack of DIY E-Skate vendors in the UK and the rest of Europe which is why I first decided to start selling parts. For the motor mount I did take some inspiration from Enertion when it comes to the motor mount and decided to go with carbon fibre from the beginning due to its superior strength and arguably better aesthetics.

Great to hear! @ProtoBoards 
I am actually quite interested in your mounts, could you provide us with some measurements? How big is the carbon piece? What is the distance between the mounting holes? 
As you offer the 63 maytech motors I assume these will fit. So Turnigy Sk3 63 shouldn't be a problem right?
Do you have any pictures of the mounts in use?
```

---
## \#10 Posted by: ProtoBoards Posted at: 2016-12-01T22:21:49.271Z Reads: 322

```
The carbon piece has dimensions of 120mm * 51mm. The distance between the centres of the mounting holes is 
31.11 mm. It does fit the 63mm Maytech motors so it will also the Turnigy SK3 63..
Here are some pictures of the mount in a dual setup (one purple mount and one black mount).<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/b/ebc91902eec152627de432e9aa291e41644cbc12.jpg" width="666" height="500">

(The truck area is slightly higher than the rest of the deck so clearance is slightly less than on a normal deck).
The Carbon Fibre part of the mount can also be flipped around giving the part even more clearance. 
If you have any questions feel free to ask!

For enclosures the reason I am currently not selling them is because I am still thinking about what sizes of enclosure I should use. If you have any suggestions that would be great! Once I know what sizes to use I should be able to get some made within a few days.

The distace between the centre of the hole which slides onto the truck and the hole where the motor axle slides through is 49mm-69mm. It works fine with HTD5 265 tooth belts. I should be making a build log soon. Shiping to Germany would be Â£5.50 for both mounts.

You should maybe think about a mounting hole for an idler pulley. Not sure if it could fit but would be nice to have at least the option
```

---
## \#21 Posted by: ProtoBoards Posted at: 2016-12-02T17:39:59.465Z Reads: 255

Yeah, thinking about it, it may be possible to use the current motor mounting holes for an idler since the motor will usually be at the furthest end of the mount. I will do some testing and see If it is possible.

@ProtoBoards do you know a way to use your mount with a motor that has a mounting hole diameter of 38mm?
```

---
## \#25 Posted by: ProtoBoards Posted at: 2016-12-06T18:12:25.467Z Reads: 242

```
The motor is compatible with all standard 63mm motors. It is possible for the 38mm hole diameter motor to be used with the mount however it is not recommended since the motor could only be connected using 2 bolts instead of the standard 4.
```

Mounting with two screws is obviously possible - but as you said nobody in his right mind would actually want to do that.
I just thought you might know what kind of adapter I could use to make it work with 4 screws.

Received my first order a few days ago, remote and voltmeter.
Both look great, shipping was fast too.
Very glad to have a new more affordable esk8 online shop in europe!

You should definitely keep adding products to your stock, like a good BMS, Hubmotors, chargers, cables (vesc dual bridge, connectors, charging ports, mechanical switches), more colors for trucks/wheels/mounts etc..

Also: Can somebody explain how to use the Antisparkswitch? I thought it should have +/- in and +/- out, 5 contacts for the actual mechanical switch (C, NO, NC, Led+, Led-) and the additional 2 for the car fuse you have to buy.

Since I want the switch to be normally open I would need 4 of the 5 contacts on the mechanical switch right?
But the ASS only shows 3 contacts for that matter: "On, Off, Switch", which confuses me, does Off need to be connected to NO, switch to C and does On have to be left aside along with NC?
Is it even possible to use Switches with LEDs with this ASS?
Thanks in advance

@Bazingazunga Yep sure, they should be in stock on the 5th Janurary.

@ACIN Thanks for the review, we plan to be adding a lot more products soon. 
The spark switch has three contacts for the switch. When the when the ON and "Switch" contacts are connected together the spark switch is powered on. When the OFF and "Switch" contacts are connected together the spark switch is powered off. Im pretty sure you can use those 5 pin LED switches with this switch, I believe that you can connect the C, NO and NC pins to the switch contacts on the board (C to ON, NO to "switch" and NC to OFF(Not 100% sure about that order, it depends on what state of the switch you want the board to be on/off)) and have the LED + and - connected to the Spark Switch output. Hope this helps.

Thanks for that, but wouldn't I instead have to connect the NO to On, C to switch and NC to Off?

Since "switch" should be constantly connected to either On or Off which would not be the case in your example when the mechanical switch is off (then On and Off would be connected, which I'm sure we don't want to happen).

@Bazingazunga The VESC's are now back in stock

@ACIN Sorry for the delayed reply, Im pretty sure that the spark switch does work fine with LED push switches, however I am not entirely sure about how the push button leads will need to be mounted onto the PCB. If the switch is an SPDT switch it will be compatible.

Sweet! Will get an order in for some stuff today :D  Any cheeky chance of getting the 20% off again since i missed it due to selling out? :p

@ProtoBoards: First off: very nice and professional store you have there! Good to know that an extra (reasonably priced) option is made available.

But I also have a question about the sparkswitch. I happen to have a sparkswitch board and a LED pushbutton lying around of the same type. But those are usually 12 volt and I can't figure out why 2 of the leads in your picture go the main battery voltage? Or is there a resistor in between?

Thanks in advance!

Thanks!
The manufacturer of the push buttons told me that the button contained a resistor and would work fine with fairly high voltages, however this wasn't entirely truthful (at first I didn't notice since I tested the switches with a 12V supply). This picture was taken of one of the old spark switch's. The new ones have a resistor soldered directly onto the push button, the picture just hasn't been updated yet.

Ah that explains! I'll probably add a resitor to mine to.

Can you use one resistor for different voltages? (6S, 10S and 12S)

ugh that depends on how resilient the LED is in terms of current deviations. I'd suggest taking a resistor for 10s/12s and try it out. The led might just be a bit dimmer

Honestly I haven't been able to test this, but I think that the LED would only slightly dim for these changes in voltages.

Really like the purple on those wheels.  Too bad you don't have any 90mm in stock.  Any word when they are back? And whats the damage to get those to Cali? @ProtoBoards

We don't currently plan to re-stock 90mm wheels anytime soon. Because of their weight they would cost around Â£20 to get shipped to Cali.
@Maxid The idler looks great! I have thought about implementing one in the past and now that I have seen it done I may start having them manufactured in the future. Have you tested it yet? If so does it work well and is it reliable?

Not tested yet - just had it rotate on the bench. have to think about the enclosure now for the new build before putting it all together.

Depends on your charger - the plug itself does not have a polarity. It think people usually go for gnd on the outside and pos on the inside. You need a multimeter

Does anyone know if @ProtoBoards is still actively selling stuff? The mounts seem to be sold out for quite some time now and the account was last seen on this forum in march.
The mounts were awesome so it would be really sad to see them go.

Hi, we are still activley selling products. Recently I have had little time to update/work on the website causing the lack of updates.
Now that I have time to start working on Proto-Boards again expect to see many more updates in the future.
Best Regards, Luke
