Hi all,

I've been lurking for quite a while now on this forum trying to figure out how to build my own esk8. Now that I figured everything out I decided that it's time to come out of hiding and offer my service to the community.

But first, I would like to thank all of you for your advice and your dedication to this forum :)

Now that that's out of the way, I would like to announce that I'm planning to sell esk8 parts (mainly in EU).


**Parts & Price list:**

- Maytech Vesc's with bootloader and @Ackmaniac 's firmware - €75 + shipping
- Winning Remotes (and possibly other remotes as well) - €30 + shipping
- BMS's (10s, suitable for bypass ONLY) - €15 + shipping
- Chargers (10s, 42v 2a) - €20 + shipping
- XT90 Anti-Spark switches - €3.50 + shipping
- XT90 Connectors - €2.50 + shipping

It's possible I'll be selling other parts as well. These are just the parts I definitely want to sell.

Lastly, i would like to know if those who live in the EU would like this and if this a good idea or not.

Thanks!

The mount is included with the kit. AFAIK it only fits the trucks it comes with. It definitively won't fit caliber trucks as it's round shaped. 

That being said, it's possible to get the mount only but as I'm still in the process of setting everything up it'll take awhile to get everything running.
