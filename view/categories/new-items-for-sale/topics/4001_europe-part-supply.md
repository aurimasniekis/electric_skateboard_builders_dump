Hello!

When i started getting into electric skateboards it was quite difficult to find good and cheap resources in Europe (I'm located in Belgium). Now i have found a good supplier i might be able to set something up to get cheap drivetrain parts to other people in europe. I can get HTD belts and steel pulleys in almost every size. Would there be enough interest from you people in Europe to get this going? Most of the pulleys would be around 9-15 euros and the belts around 8-12 euros. Shipping up to 100gram (2-3 parts) is about 4 euros and up to 350 grams 7 euros. For Belgium shipping would be a lot cheaper.

Let me know!

Hey There! I'm also from Europe, althrough Eastern Europe unfortunately. It's great you have found such a great supplier. Anyways - I am still in the process on building mine, so I have not gotten that far yet (with choosing pulleys and belt), Can you perhaps recommend any good places to order the motors and batteries from? I tried looking through hobbyking.. but their shipping option for batteries is quite expensive - about 17 eur extra for shipping to my country. Plus, the motors are basically out of stock alll the time.

So yea, if you also know a place where to get batteries and motors affordably, that would be great!

Cheers!

I have two of these battery packs. The cells are 26650 - not sure of brand but my pack has run solid for ~300 km. they are what was Bubble gum board extra stock......battery was built by AYAA in China, the PCM has a continuous discharge of 20-25A ....i have the spec sheet somewhere I can check. PCM has has a temp sensor, fuel gauge, and easy laptop like charger.

I have one of these packs pulling my 95 kg ass around running a Enertion 6355 motor, tourqueboards 12s ESC, 90 ABEC clones and a 36 - 14 drive - I get around 10km distance. I cant start from a standstill, always a few kicks but I would do that anyway. With a phone app Max speed Ive gotten is 38m/hr - maybe I'm  a weenie but that was plenty fast- generally I like to carve on flats or soft slopes ~24-27km/hr

**European gentlemen-**

Ollin boards has a sick deal going on his new motors now -  These look awesome and all my dealling with Chaka makes and sells only the best and the dude has some seriously stellar customer service. If you want them for cheap tell me/pay me now - I charge 10 euros carry fee to transport across the atlantic plus price of the motor and shipping in europe (from Spain). Still saves you 50 euros on one motor!!!

Hi guys, 

I'm also from Belgium and planning on building my own esk8te. I'm moving to Sydney in a couple of months and this looks like the ideal way of getting around the city. 
I'm on a budget though, so any good deals on parts, I'm happy to hear them. I'm still doing my research so appreciate any tips on parts and setup.

[quote="Mathieu, post:1, topic:4001"]
When i started getting into electric skateboards it was quite difficult to find good and cheap resources in Europe (I'm located in Belgium). Now i have found a good supplier i might be able to set something up to get cheap drivetrain parts to other people in europe. I can get HTD belts and steel pulleys in almost every size. Would there be enough interest from you people in Europe to get this going? Most of the pulleys would be around 9-15 euros and the belts around 8-12 euros. Shipping up to 100gram (2-3 parts) is about 4 euros and up to 350 grams 7 euros. For Belgium shipping would be a lot cheaper.

Hopefully you will get a lot of interest in Europe it will help the community a lot.

@fottaz  Can you give some more specific details about the batteries? Which cells do you use? Do you build them yourself? Which configuration is the small battery? Does it have a BMS like the big pack?
Maybe you could put these specs into the description too :slight_smile:

you need to add sizes to that description. It looks fairly thin.
Also you can swap them, but for esthetics I would make a mirror image from one.
Why leave the key-ways open at the end (those for mounting the motor)?
```

---
## \#84 Posted by: fottaz Posted at: 2016-09-02T19:09:50.067Z Reads: 186

```
The clamp will be 12mm, 8mm in the middle and the motor plate will be 4mm. 
The total width of the mount will be +- 120mm, height of 55mm

The key ways are for esthetics, the motor can't slide out

4mm is not going to cut it, def not in aluminum.
Coming back on the keyways. You should make the mount bigger as the motor, so your mount takes a possible hit instead of the motor.
