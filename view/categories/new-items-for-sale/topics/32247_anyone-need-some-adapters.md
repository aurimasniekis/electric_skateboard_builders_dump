Hi, I am selling brand new, 5.5mm to 5.5mm bullet connector extenders and other assorted adapters.  You tell me the length. All orders come with black wire mesh and high quality 12awg silicone wire.  US only for now.  All orders will be shipped priority USPS.  Hoping to pay for a new remote with some money :). PM for prices.

There's a bunch of other hard to solder little things that you might be able to make a buck on as well.

Yea, I can make parallel connectors too.  Just donâ€™t have very many xt60s or xt90s on hand @smurf

There's lots of focboxes being sold, they come with xt60 connectors but most packs have xt90 connectors. You might make some money selling dual male xt60 to single female xt90.

It's pretty cost effective, 2 colors, 2-3 sizes at 25ft each is pretty cheap compared to the kits or precuts, especially if you can find some at your local plumbing/electrical/marine supply, it can be really cheap

Should check out Banggoods. They have sick discounts, if you got the Amazon kit, then it'll arrive maybe right when you run out

Might wanna think about adding some cable braiding, I used [this braiding](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZATLUZ0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on my last build and it made the cables look quite a bit nicer.
