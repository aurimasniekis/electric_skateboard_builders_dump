About a year ago I switched to a Boosted Mini and never looked back to DIY building. I know it's a shame haha, but it's my second hobby after flying drones. Around a year ago I started this build and it's finally for like 99% finished.

Looking to sell the complete board, not willing to part out this build yet. All the parts are brand new, except for the battery, deck and wheels.

* Unikboards carbon deck with enclosure
* 2x Orangatang kegel wheel driver 32T
* 2x Unikboards POLARIS sensored motor 6355 190KV
* 2x Enertion Focbox Motor Controller
* 1x Unikboards Spartancell accu 7500mAh / 36v / 10S3P with BMS and charger
* 2x Caliber II 50Â° e-trucks
* 1x Unikboards Core Series dual motor mount
* 2x HTD5M BELT 15MM - 265
* 2x Motor pulley 15T
* 1x Dual Vesc connector by CANBUS
* 2x VESC Hall Sensor Adapter Connector
* Hobbyking GT2B receiver with Sparkle remote.
