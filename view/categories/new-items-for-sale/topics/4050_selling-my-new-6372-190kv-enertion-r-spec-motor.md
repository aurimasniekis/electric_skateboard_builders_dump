I am selling a brand new 6372 190kv enertion motor. I bought it in December with big plans but now those plans aren't going to happen. I am asking $125 obo. Free shipping in the US.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/2/2aba668c15c74af45bac2b836d7774d7a099faf3.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/0/0ab49f9a7ff5950f678c9c987be909c28f5f5e4d.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

lol Just at the right place at the right time.  It seemed like a good deal, so I jumped on it.  It's like $190 to get it shipped from Australia, so $125 shipped is a steal.

Yesterday I bought two brand new ones for 316 bucks from enertion. I need two of these monster motors for my mountain board <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/3/3309969351f220a5be8aa85d6154939be45e81b7.png" width="281" height="500">

Yeah because you got free shipping due the total being over $300 aud or about $217.  My intent is for a mono drive.  I can only imagine how insanely epic two of these will be in a dual drive.

Just had a thought.  You could've saved 10% by using the promo code 'pushingsucks' which would've been like $30.
