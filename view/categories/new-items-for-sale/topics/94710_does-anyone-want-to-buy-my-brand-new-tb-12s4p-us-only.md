I have a brand new TB 12s4p but its not going to work for my build. Wont fit in a hummie deck. So im trying to see if anyone wants to buy it. Available for pick up in the bay area or shipping in US. Comes with charger and i am still waiting for TB to send me the enclosure but would come with that too. Since its band new and never been used i would like 450 plus shipping for it.

New items, never go for full price unless it's super rare.

Do you have the single cut out deck? That battery fit fine on my Hummie deck, although it is a bit thick.
