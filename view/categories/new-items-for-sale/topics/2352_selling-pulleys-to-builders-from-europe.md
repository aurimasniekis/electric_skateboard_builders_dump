Hello all!

When I built my first [longboard](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vanguard-orange-10s-sk3-i-vesc/1337) I couldn't find right size pulley for motor from Europe. Now I have a box full of 13T 14T 15T HTD5M pulleys for 9mm belt. Bore size is 8mm.

 They are made of aluminium and includes scrub screw and keyway. The price for the set (3 pulleys) is 25e including postage to Europe. If you need just one pulley the price with shipping to Europe is 15e

Many of you were asking me to sell just one pulley and not the whole set. The price per pulley is 15e including shipping to Europe. Take yours now!

Any motor with 8mm shaft will run good. I recommend using battery with voltage of 22V-44V. Price is 25e including shipping

Well no problem I have one for 15mm belt! Size is 14 tooth and it is steel. Bore size is 8mm. There is no keyway or screw but stong locktite will hold that. I am using this same pulley with my setup :sunglasses:
