Wow that 200 deck enclosure combo on the other forum was a real steal then. I didn't realize these were so expensive

These are pricey in deed. Too bad you guys missed out on the one linked.  But also that one was used. This is not.

Yeah, if I wasn't super busy with adulting I wouldn't be selling this. So many builds that I haven't finished.

Interested but just spent a lot of money on a onewheel, may decide to purchase if the price goes down by a little but can't afford at the current price atm.

It was really a $375 x the combo. Anyhow, it was a steal back then! When the forum offering ended LaCroix deck + enclosure regular price jumped to double of that.
