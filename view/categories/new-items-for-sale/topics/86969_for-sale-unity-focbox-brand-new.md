It's not that. It's people who bought them early, may not be in need for an immediate build, and can easily make $100 off of somebody who wants it now

Not really $100 in this case it's $280 shipped in the US right now from Enertion but who knows how long it will take you are paying $45 premium to get it right now. It's a fair price and worth it to alot of people.

Not so premium if u consider what u can get for that price. Like 2 maytech 100a escs for around the same price or even a dual 6.6+ from flipsky for a little less

I have both luckily but yeah that's a deal breaker for lots. 

This is my first build with a Vesc so I wanted something easy to set up, but I will likely end up getting a flipsky or something cheaper just in case I burn it up on the learning curve haha. 

I'm hoping the unity will be more affordable and easier to obtain down the road. Would be great for all the builders.

[/quote]

Maybe because if one ESC breaks, then you have to replace both ESCs instead of one?  And likely have no brakes.

While that might be truth I don't think that's the reason for people selling their unity... Haven't heard about 1 esc breaking, but I might have missed it.

Chevrolet says they have quality wheels in their new 2019 model because none have been replaced yet.  Even though when one goes out, all 4 have to be replaced.

But, since none have failed yet, it's a superior design.

All four would be replaced to create even wear on them so you're not going around with a pad of paper and a calculator to figure out which will blow next.... 

Why do you like to argue so much Brian( curious, not an accusatory tone. ðŸ¤·)

I just bring up a point and someone who happens to work for enertion comes in acting like I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.  I don't argue, I just answered a simple question.  Enertion's PR team comes in here and starts throwing all kinds of muddiness into the water *trying to create argument*.

Whatever, I'm out.  I don't have any FOCBOX Unities anyway.

And when I say why, ***BAM*** here comes enertion damage control on the scene

This is a good point and Im curious to know what happens when something like this does goes wrong.

(Knowing my luck it will happen to me)

There is the down side of it costing more to get fixed by the wizard, but it seems like from @longhairedboy test if you not drenching it in water then you should be good.

Still, do you think that people are selling their unites because they are afraid that one esc might die and then they are screwed? It obviously isn't the case, you are just trashing the product.

I am not sure what's going on here but I think it was only Unity sale thread initially.
About the Unity, I think having one with you will let you know better about the product.
I don't disagree with your statement above @b264 but I am not able to agree with it as well. :slight_smile:

Yes however; due to iOS limitations the app can't change motor configurations. Currently trying to find a workaround. You can change config if you use a hm10 module connected to uart.

Nothing but a loop key in the picture, but if you focus on the background, at the end of the deck, you'll see the failsafe braking system. Push down with your feet and it applies friction to the wheels. :slight_smile:

Back before it was electric, I made a couple generations of mechanical brakes because lots of hills ending in intersections and cars, I just made it front wheel drive incase I got a power cut or something, FWD feels very nice actually

How HM-10 is different in this particular situation from unity module?
```

---
## \#41 Posted by: twan Posted at: 2019-03-26T07:05:14.968Z Reads: 194

```
@rpasichnyk  In this case the hm10 sends data of 20 byte size pieces. While the unity sends in large chunks of 182 bytes. Dunno why but when the sends motor config on iOS platform it misses like 50 bytes of data. This only happens on iOS, I tried it on Android and the whole 382 bytes makes it through. Seems like an iOS issue ðŸ˜ªðŸ˜ª

I think even if you have 2x VESC and one dies depending on how it dies it most likely will cause a short to ground. It's likely that even with two separate VESCs you will end up with the same problem like if you have a unity focbox.

Not really! With two VESCs, only one dies. Almost all the time. I doubt someone ever got two failure simultaneously on two VESCs. Imagine flying at 25mph because the dual controller cuts off when one heart stops beating.

Guess what, When having dual setup and VESC units connected by can. If One of the units brakes down, it will destroy the other exactly as RyuX is saying. Happened to me first hand on 2 x focboxes because just of a phase wire braking loose and shorting one focbox, the other one got fried over can (. Look how many cheap brand VESC types go bad and then try to find a focbox Unity going bad. They donâ€™t, they are very reliable, just like the focboxes were. Unity is a high quality product and also includes stuff you otherwise need to buy extra like antispark switch, bt module.
