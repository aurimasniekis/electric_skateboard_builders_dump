1.7v per cell - that's well below normal range.

i tried reviving cells like this - below 2v, but takes a charge.  took IR reading, seemed normal.  so stuck it into a pack, mixed with fresh cells, and after a few charges it drained WAY faster than fresh cells.

not saying that's what'll happen here, and it's a built pack already - but it's clear internal chemistry gets all messed up the moment it goes below 2.5v.

Yeah) I 100% agree with you. They will loose a lot of capacity. But these are I would say the highest quality cells on the market, and if charged properly, I think they could totally be usable.

I mean, if you have the tools to charge these, you could have a really nice hub board up and running for under ‚Ç¨500 total.

Hey) I might be able to drive to Germany next week and send it from there, but not for sure. You can find all the details of the BMS [here](http://www.bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D334.html).

Ok thank's for your infos. Batteries are welded together with or soldered? I can't find any dimensions infos about the enclosure.  Tell me if/when the price will go lower.
