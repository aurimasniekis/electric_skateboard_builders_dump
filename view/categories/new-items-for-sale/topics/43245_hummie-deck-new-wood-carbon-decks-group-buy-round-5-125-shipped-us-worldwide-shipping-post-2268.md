   Challenge you to find any product anywhere with less than a 20% markup from manufacturing cost.    How much time you think it will take me to find cardboard and packing material and sit around the post office?   how much you think that works out to at an hourly rate or how many hours you think I spent getting these made to begin with.    you cant even get a 40" board with this much wood and carbon anywhere near this price and this has been cnc milled with a curve.

I'm in san Francisco.  if you come and get it I'll sell it for 120$.  money is not what the game is.  the board is 40" end to end and 10" wide.  the wheelbase...I guess that would depend on your truck angle or something.

thanks for lookin' out!

this might work, it could take a two-stack pack without making the enclosure too tall...

@Hummie i know it's physically possible, but would you advise for or against that, a 2 cell high pack?  i wanna get a 12s5p in there.

this black bottomed one in the pic is mine that I use now and not selling but the new coming will be stained black every other wood layer and black on the bottom as well still.  
@ deckoz I get your point about the wording and that's fair but no slack on the cost please as it's practically a giveaway...you come get it yourself and I charge you ten bucks.  

@thisguyhere I plan to do 12s4p and two vescs and that will just fit one layer deep snuggly.  Another p group  you would have to stack as you say.   15mm deep hole.  my advice...I like the 4p that just fits

How is the wheel clearance with the drop through while running larger 97 or 107mm wheels?

 I have recently learned somethings I thought would work with drop through trucks while running these bigger wheel setups get way more bite than I would have anticipated.  I feel like sometimes it can be pretty hard to tell just in pictures.  Or maybe I don't have a good enough eye for it yet. Probably the latter.

Not interested....unless there’s a perfectly fitted enclosure that takes advantage of the milled out space 😉 

What’s with penny pinchers these days? People and businesses live to make profit. If my employers can do what I do they would save a hell of a lot of money.

these wheels I use and in the pics are 83mm diameter center set abec11 centrax on 195 paris v2 trucks and I'm 155 and have gotten them to rub the board once when super loose and trying to while unpowered.   I bet you'd be good though considering these are center set and they're pushed far  in but I cant say for sure.  you could always sand the ends a bit...customize.  diy.

@willpark16 and @Idle great.  
anyone else?  if 5 more people join I can order.

PRICES SLASHED TO ..120$ EACH.     everyone at 120$   this isn't a business here so much as a group buy.  I want that board and then maybe down the road I will sell it with motors complete
@Mikenopolis getting the kydex mold done for this would be easy.  I can do that.  I will have to do that to get it going myself.

I can make you an enclose and do it at 200$ for sure but rather keep things in the present, you get the board at 120 and we talk about enclosure later when it comes in like a month.  this board maker is on time unlike just about every other!

Usually people only lay carbon on the underneath (better performance at extension than compression), what's the benefit of the top layer?

@Hummie - Good Morning, $120 just sent as F&F
Glad to see there's enough interest to make the minimum order! 

@Deckoz - Just poking fun, but thanks to your comment you saved all of us $10! so thanks :wink:

@on1y my pack is a 12s3p that is 35 x 133 x 342mm. It's thick so having the milled out space would make the bottom slimmer looking

@Vanarian it's carbon top then carbon again two layers lower so the hole doesn't have any collapsing flex and the board still does have some flex.  it really is a great feeling board and not a brick.  i'll post some video of flex tonight.  

@Jreamer that's great please paypal friends and fam the 120 to humminashadeeba@gmail.com

not sure if we're at the minimum yet but think we will get there today.

  I can do the standard heat formed kydex on a wood mold and then bolted to the board but ive been avoiding doing that, stalling hoping to come upon another method.  whether it happens or not the plastic is being pulled and widening the bolt holes in my mind!   the magnet method seems cool in that it would allow a bit of play and not be pulling at the bolts  or maybe a two-material enclosure so it has the hardness of kydex but also some flexible seams like the Ego seems ideal

it has a nice finish on it  as is but if you find it too soft and wanted to experiment don't see why you couldn't.  stiffening it maybe youd be better adding to the bottom.  Adding to the sides sounds like it would lose it's nice looks to me but maybe youre good with cf or fiberglass.

I picked up one of these from Hummie a few months ago, and it's a good looking, solid deck. I still haven't finished building it up yet, cause i wanted to save it for the Carvon V4XL's, but my plan is to go with a @psychotiller Signature Low Pro enclosure at 24" or 26". The deck cutout is 23.5" x 5.5"x~0.5" deep, so I'm not sure if the 24" is long enough, or if I'd need to step up to to the 26". Maybe Dave can chime in on that. Or maybe we could talk him into making a custom enclosure for this deck that's perfectly sized, and even lower profile than 1"high?

https://psychotiller.com/product/signature-low-pro-22

Here are a couple images of my Hummie deck, for some more perspective. It's pretty stiff with just a tiny, almost undetectable amount of flex, and I'm 180 lbs. Feels good though. Flex shouldn't be an issue for batteries unless you glue them directly to the deck. Lol

looks really nice!   Shipping not included but I don't know how much it will be.  I'll take one over there and see how much it is domestic.  I think everyone was in the US.  it's likely very expensive to ship outside of the US

I'm up early tomorrow trying some vacuum forming and pouring wheels.  taking the day off.   I'll try to get a pic of a box up here by tomorrow night.

if youre not in the US and got one of these tell me where you are so I can figure the shipping

@L3chef  we can run the group buy again.  give me some days to get these out...or hell lets start it now.   120$ paypal humminashadeeba friends and fam or else add another 5$   and add your name here and your address on the paypal comments section.  don't think it will take long to get to 20 people.

sorry haven't gotten them out and now broke and cant even pay the shipping.  if you want it TOMORROW send me 30$ f and f and I'll send you back the difference of shipping cost. 

 yup spent all my dollars on vacuum forming stuff...and now going to make an enclosure a different way.   A super easy way.  (making an oven as large as I need to get polycarbonate up to 280 and then preheating to dry it for hours..and I'm discouraged but don't want to just do kydex)

I just figured how to get my boss level welder doing the copper strip consistently and as soon as I get the pack of 55 (11s5p) together, and glued into the board, then the next exciting part:  cover the batteries and escs with saran wrap,then make a periphery boarder about an inch out from the board's hole out of wax or something, then lay fiberglass and carbon  on all the electronics, let it cure,  drill it, peel it off, paint it with rubber inside, screw it back on and done.  
its not so "pro" but given up on other ways I was trying and instead going the suuper easy way I know will work for me and I think this will look really cool actually with the translucent resin and glass and some patterns of carbon and Kevlar in spots.  for sure will look homemade but...wait till you see.

motor's last parts are in the mail and supposed to be here on Wednesday and DHL often shows up a day early so the drive to build will be kicking hard tomorrow.

sorry for the complication and unprofessional way this is going but these boards will make it worth it.

Instead of laying the glass on the electronics you could make a wooden or foam plug or buck the same size as the battery and electronics? Then form over this?
If I could get super accurate dimensions I could make you an enclosure?

But didn't you say they cost you 110 but your going to charge 130 for packing and shipping. Then charge people shipping on top of that.

sorry it is confusing and I meant people are paying me 10$ to pack the boards and get down to  the post office at 120$ as the boards cost me 110$ .  That's the profit and all the profit.  it was said so people know what a good deal this is.
 120 plus shipping would be a big loss for me and finding the lowest cost of shipping can be as much as 47 bucks just in the usa ( shipping from sf to Atlanta Georgia).  The cost is different all over the country and not standard such as with smaller packages

I shipped a light Carbon Fiber deck form California to Atlanta via USPS Priority and it cost me $24. My wage at work is on the higher end so my time is worth a lot, so using my time packing (taped together four boxes) and transporting to the postal office in my gas guzzler of a car would add a significant amount as well.

So I would say that @hummie has the right to make a profit because he used his TIME to make these available to us, he communicated with the factory, packed up these boards individually and shipped them. Maybe I just think differently but what's wrong with making money for those who wants to offer it for other people to work for them?

nope.  no boards.  but if you want to work towards getting the 20 total orders on this site or whatever then I can order them then.  they wont sell me less than that anymore.  and then I make like 30 total per board on the deal.  I get them made in china.  I'm prompted to drop it to 110$ so we can get to the 20 orders.  I know at least 2 other people are interested but it's still a ways off.  I think it's a matter of lack of promotion and also it has no rep.  so 110$ and we get 20 made and we send it off.  
about the confusion or what the business practices are: I'm always broke and in this case couldnt send boards and bill people the shipping cost afterwards even, and two I dont really want to run a business. there might be no getting my shit together and you might suffer through slight inconvenice or confusion but I pride myself on selling stuff that's the best and, because I cant even afford to buy them in bulk it all ends up being a group buy and you get it cheap.

I had mentored this before but since your working towards ordering more, I'll try for it again.  It's there any possibility that around the enclosure there could be a slight recess around it so any mounted enclosure we were to put on it would appear flush with the board?  Like this :slight_smile:
![b51914557081844846cb440abc4cc6d6d935bf2f_1_666x500|666x500](upload://c1UCUFUqF5yiJiibiRpzj2UjzIC.jpg)

Lastly, is it possible to get one of the boards without a drop through mount for the truck cut out, and instead just provide holes for regular truck mounting from below? 

I'd definitely take one if the first thing I mentioned is possible, the second I could live without, but would prefer that.

Also I recall you mentioned someone was working on an enclosure for this, is that still going on or will we have to make our own? 

Very sick looking board, love the design!

I have to order 20 of whatever design and this design is proven while doing a change as you'd want would be a slight gamble.  true it would be cool maybe to have that slight recess for the box flange but its a complication beyond what I want to get into.  you could do it!


110$ plus shipping as it is now.  when we get 20 boards than we order.

Thanks. 5/8" is 15.725mm, so that's not including the routed cavity. Is 5/8 the inside or the outside height? Sorry for pestering, need this dimension if planning something other that single stack 18650s

The total height inside should be 15mm (deck cavity) + 1/2" (enclosure inside height) aka 12.7mm, for a total of 27.7mm. There's some extra room for diagonal stacking or lipo or 26650.

EDIT three 18650s stacked tight is 32.5mm. 27.7mm height with three cells is almost flat.

I rode it probably 7 miles today without power downtown and back.   got on the bus for one block and back off.  rather push it up the steepest hills than stand on the bus.  
I have it with the trucks super loose now without power but will crank down the trucks a lot when powered and much faster.   the length adds a lot of stability and with the fat centrax and 195 trucks i cant wait to put motors on! ![IMG_1221|375x500](upload://cKnNLjiOq8ECBTn7xzE2XAICh0O.jpg)![IMG_1222|375x500](upload://z3oqUmJNoidGkGMNuWCibWcBeCL.jpg)on!

I still don't have grip tape.  someone was asking me why not again on the road.  I like it.  as long as my shoes and the board are dry it's good.  when its really rough maybe the grip would be nice..  was going to add a clearcoat with some sand and wonder what you guys are going to do, but i'll leave it.

haha nice pictures!  mine on the other hand you get what you get and i'm not gunna try to figure it out.

If u already have a board but realize its not nearly as awesome as this one, or u did the math and know that 110$ is only a little more than a hundred and that's not much then u understand.

glad to see interest.  

@Nordle they might fit depending on the trucks.  I use 195 trucks with the centrax which are center set and therefore give less room, but still they fit with the trucks as loose as can be and Ive had the slightest wheelbite and that's it, but you could also further thin the baseplate mounting spots with a sander and make it thinner to fit and then its a sure thing.

@LukePL that's the shipping cost for 10 decks from my place to Germany.  I'll tell you how much shipping is to @bigben in England tomorrow and post up the list showing how many more people we need

Yes, contrary to popular belief, 2 piece enclosures are way more convenient to get at your goodies and they seal up just as tight if mounted properly. Only issue is they make a whiny sound...Group rides are horrible when all of the whiny sounds of split enclosures combine.

It'll be nice to offer single enclosures. :rofl:

Ive got good and bad news.    the good news is the boards are awesome and we can still get them.  the bad news is they are forcing me to get 30 and I still don't get a price break until 50.  the goal post has moved!   I'll get 4.  I'll add up who paid already for the next batch tonight.  

get this board people!  don't get sucked in by the brand name hype or discouraged by lack of it.  this board is top notch maple and carbon with a cnc'd cut.  a lot of stuff in a small price

paypal 110$ friends and fam to humminashadeeba@gmail or 120$ regular insured.

be great if you could get a couple @bimmer so we can kick start this.  

the manufacturer just wrote me showing me mail with one of you trying to get boards directly from them.  I'm surprised one of you was able to track them down.  lucky for me the manufacturer will only sell to me!  that's rare for china.  but whoever you are..at 110$ each and 70$ each to me before shipping, and 30 bucks shipping from china, you wont be getting a better price unless you buy 50!  and they wont sell them to you anyway. 
I actually invested in these quite a bit of time and money to make it happen.   paying for design of the cutout (before I could design), and paying much more for prototypes.

I am marking them up some.
from the manufacturer:
"30 pcs, unit price USD70.00, the freight is USD640.00;  
50 pcs, unit price USD52.00, the freight is USD790.00; "

the shipping is a bit less with 30 decks so I could make 18$ a board as shipping is 22$ each.   but add in paypal fees and my time and tape and cardboard and it's almost nothing.

but if I can get up to 50...its not much further.

ill do whatever you want as far as the invoice.  get two at least.   if other people put in for 30 I'll get the other 20 so we still just need to get to the 30.   shipping will not be much more for two or more than just one I imagine.  get 5 and sell them yourself locally or something.

your work is great really, i appreciate that much enthusiasm. the board looks really great and i bet it rides perfect.

but just think of it, if i am buying a new deck, it should fit like the way i need it. i just ordered an enclosure with specific dimensions that wont be modifiable.

is just thought of sending you some more bucks in order to get a personal fitted deck, unique.

if you are making them by yourself, it should not be the problem to **not cut out** the trucks mounts, and if you are milling the **integrated enclosure** by yourself/with your machines, it should be possible to do this.

still, i like the artwork, it is definitely a masterpiece, but it does not fit in my new project with this style and dimensions of the milling. so if you **could** personalize decks in the making, that would be super fancy! else, i am sadly out although i would really love to use one!

just my 2 pennys, dude!

The request is to do less yes, but bear in mind the time it takes to setup a CNC machine. finding the right toolbits, coding the program, adjusting cnc. After all that work they are just making 1 deck.

But they could do a run of 50 decks with the same setup time

I know the adjustment of tools and programming to smooth out production is costly. And definitely not here to say he deserves a special custom deck. But my normal human curiosity just wonders why factories would say no to a request to stop the CNC milling part after production #49 out of the 50.

I’m keen for two decks, I was going to start another thread to see who would want their EU deck shipped to the UK then I can send them on from here. If there is enough interest I think we can get them shipped directly to the UK saving on the transatlantic shipping and at least saving a little on administration costs.
Also if whoever buys one in this order I can get an enclosure made for them and ship at the same time if there is interest. I will definitely be building a slimline single stacking enclosure and there has also been interest in a deeper double stacker.

@Idle brought one over to my shop this weekend and I got a chance to check it out..nice work man, I cannot wait to get mine and start building on it..I love how deep the battery bay is on it..the drop through mounting is the only thing I found to be lacking due to the thickness of the deck itself, it make mounting certain trucks topside difficult as the hanger hits the bottom of the board. Also the camber is sort of counter to a such a thick design due to the lack of flex..for a 200 pound fat boy like me, it may be perfect to get the angle back out of where the trucks mount, but I wouldn't recommend this deck for little guys and stick figures..this one is for men..

I actually put down a build today because if that. I was cutting all the holes for mounting bolts, charge port, switch, etc. I'd already marked for phase wires couplers in the enclosure and I went back and looked at the FocBox again...did a little cussing at the point and out it down. 

I think I'll just come out against the deck and use my phase with guide as normal 😀.

Looking good, what depth is the enclosure? I was looking at it and it seemed a 10mm one would get a single stack in.
Seeing the six-shooters on would be great.

Not sure exact depth, but definitely won't fit doublestack
When the enclosure is mounted and bolted it flexes towards the deck, so the height shrinks even more
Goes from flat to concave

More mounting holes on the PCB most likely means bigger PCB.
[quote="scepterr, post:389, topic:43245, full:true"]
Yeah that bugs me too 😋
I resolder one at an angle so it points more towards center
Also next version needs case mounting holes through the PCB so the case doesn't need to extend much beyond the pcb
[/quote]


I cant see any other advantage of having 2 ESCs in one PCB apart from symmetry (if you have one mirrored) and biggest disadvantages are if something breaks you end up without 2 ESCs, repair would be more expensive, also some people only runs one motor so you would need 2 different ESCs coming from factory, more costs. Not worth it imo.   

[quote="bimmer, post:390, topic:43245, full:true"]
I'm more for a double pcb where one is mirrored and redundant parts just scrapped. Pre configured can master/ slave.

she said the shipping cost will be about the same to EU.  so it's the same 110$ price all round. (or 115$ if not friends and fam)   that price gets the board to myself or Ben and then you have to pay for shipping from my place here in san Francisco or Ben's in England to your place.   or pick it up.

I keep saying it but a big perk related to getting things to fit is the noses are thick and could easily be sanded to customize to fit whatever you want.  add a bit of clearcoat and its as good as new with the stained wood layers and no paint anywhere.

 I haven't been keeping track of addresses and names and stuff and lets leave it all till the last minute when they show!.  syched to see what enclosures you guys make and I'll be making one too.   thin PC ribs with just Velcro


if you have any advice on how I can organize the addresses and payments from people please tell.  ideal for me would be just a list of your real name, paypal address, and how many you ordered but don't know if people feel comfortable doing that.   I'd like to somehow organize a single list with everyone and everything on it.   Or I can dig through paypal and probably get 4/5 of the way there.   would be easier another way though

got these which are 25mm thick, but they will be here amazon tomorrow.   lots of room still and not a good fit but whatever and who cares as long as you don't have to spot weld 48 cells.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XY47JPR/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

board and two escs comes so close to fitting these which are only 15mm thick and would stick out like a mm.
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-8000mah-2s1p-30c.html

could cover each individual cell with a thick carbon layer and that would be what I'd want glued under the deck.  but doesn't quite fit and too late now.  and 100c with the Zeee I'll be thinking about that while I ride

curious how it would go if I hooked up my 9amp charger with the 6 amp charger at the same time to charge this at its stated max of 16?  just wondering how it would go.

Yup! for switch, LCD and Charge port. Can form it without, but it's so low profile you'd have to mount that stuff elsewhere without the raised section.

It's actually a raised section, not a notch. I'm getting all MC Esher haha

@psychotiller made it.

Drilled and cut the holes myself. I had to cut a slight gap in the foam seal to make room for the back of the angled LCD, button and plug. That new bump he added seems like a great idea. 

Battery is a 12s3p single stack with BMS. Really not much room left with the antispark switch, dual receivers and FocBoxes which is why I’ll go with double or stagger pack for 4wd

@uigiroux  Have you looked into Dremel Router attachments? I’d imagine taking off the small amount you need would just be an hour or two. 

His guy made his own. Watch the small area he tested at around 3:47 and see if that’s something you wanna do.

@BruSkater seems super stable at 22mph which is the fastest I’ve taken it in the few test rides. I’m still working out some kink. Feet plants onto the drops really well!

I couldn't tell you, Never rode on a 17ply. I've been on 16ply and it flexes with my 210lb weight (plus a backpack +2lbs?).

I only rode this build for 5 miles testing carves, acceleration and brakes. My stance was wide and mostly on the drops so never felt any flex. Before I built this, I kicked it around for a bit and there is a slight flex to it when standing in the center.

Just the Hummie deck with psychotiller's enclosure. The milled out space is what makes the build look slim 

I did ride this with the 107s. It rode really well and looked great because it was black and wide as hell. Looked like a performance car IMO. I took them off and went back to the 97s. Because my 3p battery won't be great on range.

@Mikenopolis Could you tell me wich enclosure ? because they seem to have a lot of different ones  ^^
(I'm kinda new here)

thanks for this, i was not sure i could use these (awesome) wheels on an e-board since i had problems finding a regular board for them x), but i'm thinking of getting some Evolve trucks (which are about 300mm wide) to go with these and build a board ( and i'm getting really interested in that deck here)

@Hummie I'm sorry if you already said it but i couldn't find it in the thread, how much do you sell it now ? , and do you know how much it costs to send it in Europe ? (France in my case) :slight_smile:

I don't get this obsession where if I say something looks great and inquire about prices or specs I'm suddenly buying everything..?  Granted, I plan on buying a bunch of stuff.  However, I've also said I'm working on two builds.  One for me, and one for a friend.  It's not like I have 4-5 K just sitting around and can buy everything I need all at once.  It takes time.  I hardly think that means that I can't browse the forums and ask about products that I may potentially buy.  Everyone else here does it, but because I verbalize it and say, 'this looks great, how much are you selling for?  Or something along those lines, I'm suddenly "buying everything"?  Cut me some slack guys, I'm buying up parts for my first build.  I'd already have it built if things were released on time.  I'm bring patient, so please just bear with me...  Not trying to start anything with anyone, just want people to understand the circumstances here.  Sweet Esk8 to come though!  Will create a build thread soon :smile:

thanks mike.  


 the cost of shipping is different to different parts of the country and its easier if I just send them all and then i'll keep the receipt and post it here and then (hopefully!!) you can all pay me back.  see if we can get all of you to do that.   

so give me tomorrow and the next to get these out.  if you want any weird kind of shipping tell me otherwise it'll be the cheapest, which has shown good so far. 

I'm going off the google doc so make sure its right for you.  thanks for doing the google doc it's so much easier.

anyone know how to transfer the addresses to a sticker?  could get it all out now really if I can get enough boxes from the post office.  don't think they want me setting up shop in there but be easiest to do it all there with stickers in hand.  off to see how many boxes they'll let me out with

i know i said they'd go out yesterday but after talking to the post office they recommended i get cardboard from the grocery story, and then i got that and it had a bunch of oil stains that I was told wouldn't look "professional" by my girlfriend when i got it home.   whatever i'll get them all packed today and out tomorrow.

cant you just put it just in front of where you typed your physical address?

 (2 people have done this by writing a "2" there, which I assume is the decks and not their address, but then I also have some "1"s and not sure if that is your address.   write "(# decks)" at the beginning, and then your email address next, and then your physical address please  

otherwise there's a person who ordered 2 and another who ordered 4 and don't know which of you.   and haven't been able to verify payment.

by 3pm, in 4 hours, hopefully the questionable 4 decks and the other 2 decks ordered by individuals this can be figured and i'll get them over to the po and out.

saw only 4 names attached to addresses at the time of departure and still don't know if yours is up there now.  

the only new names on there are
Xavier 
john king

and the 4 older names.  I guess you don't see what I see but make sure your name is in the spot that now asks for your name and address

and it seems not to be working with some people.  pm me your name and your address and I can attach it.  so if you have that done by Tuesday it goes out

Discount ten bucks for no packing (for science) and another 20 for a blem board anyone?

@Hummie

not sure if this helps or adds to the shipping effort but i removed the duplicates and cleaned it up.

maybe you can append tracking no. and total shipping cost to this sheet then just refer ppl to it so you don't have to send 30 PMs to each person.

i've also pm'd you a copy with names and address.

 I hope u guys can blow this up n find ur tracking number.  If u don’t see ur address and wondering why it didn’t ship, stop, wait, think “did I add my first n last name to the google doc? “. But maybe u did and I missed u and pm me n we can get it out tomorrow

I can't believe the condition! Honestly, aside from the manufacturing blemishes, hardly worse than the one that came with cardboard. One ride and they'd both look the same.

I think you were right. Not having it protected, no one wants to toss this around like they would a boxed one.

sorry confusing you with trancejunke I sent two to by mistake.  

 

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-flightmax-8000mah-2s1p-30c.html
the cutout will just fit these and its pretty much a perfect match assuming you wanted to go full assault on the wires turning it to strip (if you've done it please tell) its a bad pic but they are pretty close at 15mm thick and the board at 13 I think. for sure two focbox and a loop key glued to the deck will fit and that's the plan  I will be going full assault with copper strip clearcoated over it glued to the deck first and with tabs I can attach to. and layers of rubber, and glued to the cell shrink wrap or just the bare cells.  

  ![image|375x500](upload://6WPIMneizyso1OwVO4DZLpvjyoC.jpg)

Anyone from the latest batch having problen drop mounting the trucks? It wont fit..

Hard to get a photo that shows what I mean.. ![IMG_20180605_202825|374x499](upload://48AsNYzSEvJtP5o2chu1ig1dvy8.jpg)![IMG_20180605_202753|374x499](upload://qVL0NGV88LYoWnfYC5QeAY4FV75.jpg)

It's far of fitting. Kingpin not close to center..


For a proper fit I would have to drill new holes super close to the edge.. Any suggestions..?![IMG_20180605_203418|374x499](upload://ppMGYNwTOwTds8fWYyKzESpu90j.jpg)

 it is really tight using Paris v2 or this custom 12mm hanger and if turning really hard Ive hit but it could be sanded a bit and I haven't bothered and it eats a bit of the paint on the hanger and Ive seen a bit of dented wood
  is there something other than that tight fit that you're talking about when turning where the hanger will hit?

  it does look like the pivot cup is farther forward with that truck.   ill take a pic of what I ride tonight

it looks like they could have drilled the mounting holes a bit further back to allow the pivot cut to be more centered in the big cut out and then it wouldn't hit when turning but  theres not much room there and at most it could be moved maybe a mm or 2.  I think since its such a thick chunk of wood there just sand it.  I think its worth sanding the whole nose down as it ends up cracked for me repeatedly on this deck from my dragging it around on its nose.  be better just to have the metal at the nose to bang against stuff and stand it upon

I will try with my calibers 50 today after work. Could you perhaps post a pic of your mounting holes so I can compare if mine are wrongly milled/drilled?

Thanks but theres no way the hanger will fit. Tried mounting it every possible way before posting here. The hanger touches the front face of the deck. Would need to remove 12-13 mm (1/2") for it to fit. .
I think they fucked up this deck since there's measurements that' not correct. For example the battery cut out should be 140*590. Mine was 134 * 582. And not in center of the deck. Was 5 mm of center but that's no biggie. Had to enlarge it anyway to fit my setup.

Im down for another GB!  its easy for me to do.  today is my last day at work and then will be non-stop doing motors everyday and getting them done as soon as possible but repacking decks and shipping on is relatively simple.
if you want me to change the cutout dimensions for a certain battery maybe we could get it done if all agreed but the hobbyking flightmax 8ah 2s are an awesome fit, almost always available, and lately ion cells are a pain to deal with in my mind.  They fit well with two focbox and a loopkey and not much more.

I like it as snub nosed as possible so I can drag it and not have to carry it.

wowww @thisguyhere is selling the mini trigger cheaper than I think anywhere at 19$  http://www.esk8life.com/

lets figure what you guys want as far as details on the cutout but as it is, as awkward as it may be, we will never come to a consensus.  I still think a 12sp4 will fit with two focboxs and also the hobbyking flightmax I linked above at 8ah and 2s just fits and its as slick as could be.  Also this is tried and true and don't want to cut wider.   if you need to you can dremel but if you have a great argument for a certain cut lets hear.

when we get the orders in to make this happen.  50 decks.  it goes out.  I'm not subsidizing this or getting any so its a real 50.  that's a lot.   

paypal humminashadeeba@gmail.com  (prefer friend and fam!)  the 120$ and...who's an awesome person who can make a google doc?...hummmmm...

Going from just 140mm wide to 145mm wide would allow laying 8 cells vertically and also make it easier if you wanted to lay them horizontally.

that sounds worth doing.   I was on the phone with them asking about the carbon imbedded in the board, the layer in there near the top, wondering if maybe we should move it another layer down towards the center before the cut out.  I think that would stiffen it a hair more and makes more sense using it in tension.  It could compensate for the 145 instead of 140.

or should we shoot for 26650 cells?  theres some measuring nerdery that can be done to figure I'll be doing but annoyed by doing fregin 48 cells and rather drop it to 36 at least 12s3p maybe, if it fits, and the cells are out there.

awesome mike!  and we're up and running.  and the list is already lost at the second to last post already.

I'll confirm the 145 cut instead of the 140 with them and you guys tell me if you like that and I already like it.  and the carbon is going down a layer no prob for stiffness.    

also seeing if we could do a different top layer of carbon maybe a uni-directional like this for just the top layer.  I'm seeing and maybe they can do us a quick sample to show.  I have this deck.![deck|500x500](upload://mUe2Gbile0IKqryVajxuuQug4Ng.jpg)

well the cut out would be only 5mm wider which isnt much and the internal carbon layer was not placed ideally for strength or stiffness and would be moved down a bit towards the center for that purpose and who knows and if we get uni-directional carbon on top instead of the weave it would make sense that would stiffen it lengthwise as well.

uni-directional or the checkerboard?![image|249x166](upload://ybtXM6mUvFycZtXjpep1seKBvE2.jpg)

its a more subdued organic look.  hard to find images of it after lamination

but not a single person has jumped into this and we are 50 boards away.  I'll get two so 48 away.  

im tempted to bring it down to 115$ including usa shipping if that would get people on this.  Id rather see it happen than wait forever.  in my mind this is a good opportunity to get a deck yourself or 5.

the deck shape and length is fixed based on the mold and we cant go any longer or wider.   we could add a nose but dont want to do that and like to drag the board on the wheels

they said getting the deck cut without the cutouts for the trucks isn't possible in small quantities and this GB is for the same deck as everyone has shown and the only changes will be the cutout will be a bit wider and maybe a hair longer and to be decided and the hidden carbon layer moved down inside

People in the USA I'll be doing an enclosure as well using the new slightly wider version of round 3 and  I'll sell a 3d printed copper 18650 compression pack that will fit 12s4p I designed a long time ago that wouldnt fit the older version.

very simple minimalist design that can flex and uses rubberbands for compression.

its a print in a print so the copper is sandwiched.  the copper is also formed into those nubs using a press that i print and then stick in my arbor press.  I havent done testing of the resistance but bet it's got much less than nickel strip.  it's pretty thick copper and can get a lot of compression.  i was planning to plate it with tin or something or read there's even a dip you can do, but it takes a loooong time for the copper to tarnish in my experience and especially with a slight dab of conductive paste and doubt it will diminish in conductivity bare for a long time.  
Ive made packs using compression foam behind the copper and  seen commercially available packs with it...  still tempted to try to work it into a design actuallly. because then the compression can be inside.   damn you got me back on that and have to try that again.  ..then  could be glued down to the deck and also be the encasement.

N.E.S.E. has tested and tested again.  i saw his old test video with a crying baby in the background on endlesssphere and this one looks more intense.  i plan to test the old fashioned way riding around on rough roads and then going to the infrared thermometer.  if you have any good ideas on a design throw me a bone.   the design i posted above requires rubberbands and then it still needs an enclosure.  Surely with a 3d printer and maybe foam and the cutout in the board something that could satisfy both needs of protection and connections could be wrapped into one and something could hold the cells, protect them, and be fixed to the deck somehow

@betterlate hope to see you on the list.  We're like 2/5ths of the way there.

Dude you're getting me fired up, but I think I have to finish my NESE based project first...

I do have one thought. since 2 cells fit end-to-end across the width, if you have compression, all you have to do is provide structure. That saves a bunch of space and stuff.

Yea I was surprised and some of the older version had a bit narrower cut at maybe 136mm. Some.  I'll tell them to make sure at 145mm exactly this time.  N maybe we should add one more wood layer?   The sppt the hanger sits needs to be sanded a bit to fit so it doesn't rub already. Just don't want to end up with a wet noodle.  Rather add one more thing wood. Then cutout is like 14mm deep.  But too much time to think about it and not important.

We are currently at 14 decks, a few people are waiting for payday so maybe 16 or 17 total?

If you have a build with this deck, please post pictures and keep this thread alive and kicking. @trancejunkiexxl I know I've seen yours with the Zenith, please post pic here as well

I talked w the manu and they don't want to do carbon on the bottom n cut it out.  They will do all maple next though.  
I'd like to do cutout at 150mm wide as will fit 8 cells side by side w clearance for compression pack.  I'm talking about something just like sold on this site ..I forget the name.  Copper compression using 3d print n foam.  I don't have a design for this 150mm cut out n 8 cells and looking for design ideas.  The only hurdle is making it so it can be reliably held closed and take hits. Maybe need screws   

So 1 more cm wide.

Damn that looks so good! Have you considered routing about 1-2mm around the edge of the enclosure so it shows no edges and makes it blend in perfectly?

something like this but smaller so it fits the board :D

[/quote]

My view is that as long as you are not jumping on the deck a non flexible battery will be fine. I Velcro the front of my battery to the deck. So if that slight deck flex happens, the back half of battery still has a little room to move instead of flexing. I never stand in the middle of the board so it’s really not an issue unless you like to dance on your boards

if your battery has long spans of rigid nickel strip I think it could be a problem but you should be able to easily add some flexibility to the strip with a bend between p groups or something.  lipo are easy!  flightmax 8ah 2s are like a glove fit

I just show this as an example of a way to add some flex.   between the p groups the strip takes a bend down the side.  Unless a pack is designed to flex it seems like trouble. 
 if any of you are good at design (im slow as shit) we should work together on a design I'll print and then make a silicone mold from and then we can form resin in the board cavity to conform to each cell N.E.S.E style.   shaping and adding the copper and foam is easy and then probably print plates that would bolt into the hardened resin with inserts or something.  maybe add the inserts later or be sweet to have them set into the resin if the mold were done nicely.   and that would be a solution with so many benefits.  you could bottom out..its all solid.  flex.  ...benefits galore and dont have to drill the deck

As per @Hummie 's request. this is what I am doing for the enclosure. This is a MDF mold for vacuum forming. Inspired by @bigben. basically almost the same but the fender washers will sit inside those pockets.

Edit:
the top is the exact size as the cutout. 1/2" tall, 45 degrees on the length, and a less sloped on the width. 1/2" skirt.

I think making it flat might actually be better since the deck bows up in the middle with no weight and depend of how much you weight flexes the other way. Yeah, I am very glad that my college built this makerspace with a lot of experienced staffs.

@hummie I would be down for some testing. I tried at compression fitting with a borrowed 3d printer before buying the bad ass spot welder. Didn't go very well. Now that I bought a CR10 and have been playing with it all summer, I would like to give it another shot.

it seems like almost everyone has a horror story with spot welding or soldering cells.  


this would be making a long silicone mold out of glued-together prints.    the silicone would be the length and height of the deck hole.    fill deck partially with resin and then insert the silicone to form it into place where it will give support to the cells and fixins and then plates bolted over top.

these are the basic plans for the v4 deck. a change with a wood beam in the center.  still probably only 145mm wide.   you guys arent seeming into the cell compression aspect yet but let me get a prototype made and show you some pics of that and then hopefully you wont be backing out and instead be jumping in.   i just threw this drawing together after thinking about it for a long time.  if you see any obstacles...like how thick the beam in the center needs to be to support the screw insert, or if you think inserts cant sustain repeated screwing and unscrewing..or any other thoughts please tell. but i'll be quiet about it till its ready to show

no soldering or spot welding.  copper compression with printed plates bolted to secure.  solid all the way through, except foam on the sides for compression similar to N.E.S.E packs

If there's any heavy force the beam will fold over as you apply compression unless you can do bthe sides at the same time?

Maybe skip the beam and haye the cells directly touching?

If support for the coversis needed, maybe add beams going across every 6cells or so, maybe built into the lid and not the deck?

How aie you going to compress? Just jam the copper and Poron in?

it's a strong wood beam and wouldnt fold even at this 5mm with the lateral force on it.
having cells touching and doing two across and bolting on either side isnt as secure or supportive and seems risky, and it would bend in the middle.  done that.
compress with poron yes.  

I dont trust spot welded cells with flex.  they also have high electrical resistance resulting in heat and less cell life.  they are a lot of work to make a pack.  they cant be dismantled easily either and that has a bunch of downsides.

[quote="Hummie, post:1014, topic:43245"]
how about i send you the older deck i still have a couple left?
[/quote]

From usa to europe? That will be expensive.. It's an option tho..
But why not have 2 versions and see who wants what.. Those who makes the deck only need to change cnc program, and that takes 3 sec. Since both decks have same workshift and cutting tools..

As far as I know they will have the CF in different layers. I am not sure why an 'all maple'. version is being discussed, cause it still will have CF, lol...? :confused:

its a minor difference and the carbon layer on the new will still be on top and then the one inside will be down one, where it probably shouldve been.   i'll see if they can do two versions but unlikely and getting them to just do 50 decks is a feat.

and seeing about getting all maple so not that bamboo layer (either way doesnt make difference to me)
and one more layer of wood.  so hole will be like 15m or 14mm deep instead of 13

yes.  145 x 580 i think it is.   will see if they can do almost all of them as that, with the one hole, and then a couple with the double hole since it is experimental.  experimental but sure it will work.  theres no reason it wouldnt.  just need enough room for the right foam.

They’re not going to do the layer carbon after cutting.  But I’m trying to do similar to nese but with a way to have it mounted to deck. Otherwise ur gunna have to mount them somehow n that’s a challenge

I’m not so worried about strength, the beam is for the screws to hold the cells.  Wondering how Youll mount the nese

I'm not talking about the battery compartment cut out, I'm talking about the cut out for the trucks.  Just go up a few responses and see someone else was commenting on that, I was agreeing.  I want this board specifically cause it looks bad ass and has the cut out for the battery and everything.  The only thing I would change, and I know I've heard others say this too, is they would prefer the trucks area not to be cut out so they don't have to mount the trucks through that cutout.  Top mount, bottom mount then, whatever it is.

if you do a poll and each payment for a board would count as a vote I'll be buying like 20 boards probably since things are taking so long so i will out vote you all:rofl:  ben is gettting a bunch so maybe you might get close to me.
(i finally use an emoji and i cant see it)
but i wrote them seeing if i can get them to do half with the big single cut at 145 wide and half with the two cutouts at 72mm with the 20mm beam and see what they say.  i'll push for it as it seems a simple program switch.

and they say they will do 50 of the normal big cut board from before with the couple little changes and at 145mm or 20 if I do the double cut deck and then the price will be back up to like 30 bucks more each deck.  

i dont know what you guys want to do but im impatient and want to just order the 20.  I dont even have a price yet but will get it later tonight probably.   I can keep things rolling for the 50 decks with the big cutout and i know people want that deck, but it might be a while till the bucks for that finally get pooled together enough to make it happen.  all along I always wanted to go the compression route so im all in going that way.   

 tell me what you want if youre already financially involved in this, there are three options:
1. Hold, and youre waiting for however long it takes to get to 50 orders for the 145mm cutout deck (think that's the decided width)

2. double down and go for the double cut deck and trust that i'll figure out the compression pack and it will likely be some more bucks just for the deck and then also more for the pack (i want this to happen and will make it as cheap as possible for you guys if you go this way as i know its all unseen and money up front)

3. cash out and that's self explanatory and I can do that now.

but pm me and that will keep us from clogging this place with this

Love this deck btw guys, decided to go 12s5p super slim pack, I will be making my own fiberglass cover at just a little over 10mm deep to mount my pack and bms. The dual vesc will be going in the case designed and machined by @Kug3lis as a top mount over the truck plate with a 3D printed lid (courtesy of @mmaner)  that's going to house the rc receiver, battery meter, and power button. 

And when I get a couple more pieces of tubing I will unveil my "brush guard" lol... and the piece de resistance... my Gadsden Flag to mount on the rear of the board

decks are ordered and should be 30 days till done and then a couple days shipping!

do you want the single hole board to have a 145mm wide hole?  i think that's what we decided on.  

I'll have 20 with the single hole and 20 with the double hole and should have the battery squeeze pack parts done for the two hole deck by the time the decks arrive.  (printing now)

if youre interested in getting one of the decks with the 140mm hole that i already have i can get it shipped to you within a day.   
120$ including domestic shipping
i have maybe 3 left that are new and a couple cheaper that are used.


if youre interested in the ones coming they're 110 with usa shipping when they come.  

these new decks are with the changes from the last:
the wider hole at 145mm i think.
all maple layers no bamboo.
the inner carbon layer down one layer for stiffness

otherwise the same![cap1|690x354](upload://xkWgijot2z40KWNqwcq1NwJvJJf.JPG)![cap2|690x338](upload://zbay5cW8zLDm3hPrPI5XohYC8rp.JPG)
i'll likely be making molds and casting these parts in pu with fiberglass for the squeeze pack or maybe print them in abs.  have to see how consistent can get this large (200mm) part

Got my deck in today.  Looks gorgeous!  :heart_eyes:  I'm definitely going to have to make some additional space in the cutout though, as you can see, these NESE module's are a bit wider than the cutout.  Also think I'll have to make it a bit longer too.  It is going to be a tight fit for an additional DieBieBMS and dual ESCape's...  I think I'll be ok though, the board feels very firm, so hopefully it can take an additional inch in length and width.  :smile:

Looking at this last pic, I don't think I'll need to make the cutout any longer.  These modules are like 167mm (or close to that) and the DieBieBMS is about 60mm and the ESCape case is I think 77mm, so they should all fit in there with just a bit of extra space :wink:

how are you going to hold those packs?  i think youll need a beam going across that could screw in the thick wood.  inserts there.  the center is thin but maybe you could do some recessed screws on the other side and go straight in through the hole.  sounds risky.

Hey that's a good idea.  Kinda like what I plan on doing.  Ok, so the plan is as follows:

Once I have the new area taken out, I'm going to take some angled molding that goes up just past the height of the battery modules and cut it to surround the cutout, then attach it with epoxy and some screws or nails.  Once it's secured, I'll cut out an area from them which would allow me to put a lid over it.  Then I'll cover the bottom of the board with a layer of CF or Kevlar so it looks much nicer.  Then I'll secure the batteries with the lid which will match in CF.  Then I'll make a custom enclosure to cover the entire cutout.

That's what I plan to do in as few words as possible, lol.  There is a similar design I've seen in the pics thread.

Like this, but I'll make it raised up first and I'll be making a second cover to go over the covered area.

I did the same thing with my deck. Left the packing tape on for a week. And when I removed it after laminating the tape glue/residue was all over my deck. Probably spent a week cleaning it up :grin:

![image|294x499](upload://88IihRt2XsTvRf0i0bmEyvVYtVa.jpeg)

I just bought a dremel planning to modify it but I was then checking my planned battery option for 12s6p and the enclosure I had wouldnt fit it with all the other essentials. 

Been following your thread for ages and it isn’t the type of deck I was going for but I think I’m going to love it anyway with bigben enclosure and then fit 12s5p perhaps go to 4p even. Maybe 12s6p is a bit overkill anyway.

I bet you will have no issues with strength.  Also I'm guessing the battery enclosure will hide the slightly uneven lines.  Which you won't see when done.  But if you have the time or guess it won't matter

Yeah I'm not going to spend a crazy amount of time getting it perfect, but I'll probably spend a few hours cleaning it up.  Then I gotta find some wood siding that'll help me with the building of the enclosure.  Attach that all around the cutout, then put a layer of CF over it all.  Then make a lid for the battery modules, and then make am enclosure over everything.  Lol, lots of steps here!

Whenever you get a chance to swap out that would be cool, no biggie. I'm sure a lot of people here want to know and I'm sure more will buy the deck.   Such a slim profile for components begs for a nice drop down for that lowrider and planted feel!

@Holyman92 and @Hummie Have you guys considered using copper rivets? I came across this idea a while back. Just need to figure out a way of applying constant pressure with the foam. Maybe attached the rivets to a solid piece of copper?

http://www.pep-corp.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Contacts-July-2012.jpg

I've stumbled across [these](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/electric-relay-switch-parts-solid-copper_60268276023.html) on Ali Express, they are even silver coated to improve electric conductivity. There are also a bunch of configurations and some that are threaded.

youve probably seen this image before but this is using copper sheeting and it seems the easiest and safest.  
![image|666x500](upload://8gbZ8Av6EuTGMlCuSQewL0FQoNP.jpg)

it's just copper sheet that's been formed on a 3d printed press (that goes in my real arbor press).  this seems easier and more reliable than separate rivets.   and will add the plastic protector guard as well as in this pic as the copper cuts the cells wrap really easily otherwise.

with the two cells spanning the single 140mm hole there is no way to really secure them and they will bow in the center.  i think they need to be held on each side of every cell.  when these new boards come in its definitely happening and i got 20 decks with this double cutout 72mm wide by the 585 long.

 just got the foam in the mail.

rivets in the side of the deck sounds nice..but the connections between them sound complicated.

dual 4.12 VESC
dual 5055 280kv, 12:36 gear ratio on hobbyking mounts
(will switch to 6355 or better later, bought the 5055 3 years ago)
83mm flywheels
Vedder Antispark with 19mm push button

homemade low profile enclosure with M6 fender washer n threaded insert
mini remote w/ receiver borrowed from @jasonbhuynh 

yeah I broke one of the 12T motor pulley. It was stuck and I had to pull it off to replace the retaining ring on the motor.

@Hummie they are probably clones. These are my first set of wheels so I don't know the difference yet. If you have a set on a board I can try, I might be interested. Are those for your V4 hub? if they are, I took over someone's spot so I guess I will be able to try them soon. :D

@Mikenopolis they kinda are. Power button won't matter unless I take off my shoes and stick my toes into the sock. the voltage meter sit's right at the very end of the enclosure cutout and looks nice right next to the power button.  Now that you pointed it out I guess I could've put it to the long side. Power button would still be at a corner of the enclosure cutout tho.

Hey Bigben! After checking out these Hummie decks which no doubt lots of people are liking here, how much for a deck+ enclosure? Could it fit a 10s6p? whats the dimensions and does it have some concave to it?

Edit:
nvm I scrolled up abit to see some photos with various battery configs. Would it fit a bestech 80a 10s bms with anti-spark and voltage indicators as well? I'm thinking either still going dual ESCapes or maybe waiting on the Focbox unity pre-sale so not sure what Vesc I wanna go with yet

That's exactly what I was thinking.  The new product that @Wajdi is coming out with would be perfect for that!  Well at least everything but a charge port and on /off button, but it would have all the telemetry info and more on a touch screen with a USB charger as well.  I guess on the other side above the trucks is where the on/off button and charger could go...  Still, perfect way to mount these without having to drill through your enclosure.

Honestly not sure if it matters for charging lifepo4's but I've used that power supply for driving large high-watt LED displays, and it's not CC.  Had to use constant current drivers between it and the LEDs or they'd start frying pretty quick.  The LED emitters I was using are good from ~500ma to about 1200ma, and I set the voltage to drive 700ma (nominal for those emitters) but the variation in the output would start killing emitters in a couple of days of ~8hr/day usage.  Cheap little current drivers between the power supply and the LED strings fixed the problem and those signs have been running over a year now without losing a single emitter.

Again, not sure if that matters at all for charging the lifepo4's but just an FYI about that PS.

Cheers!

 cc and cv are not important for cells as long as the power supply isnt putting more in current than the cells can take.
 Ive been reading about charging cells and how a cell's stated charge rate is misleading and you can likely put much more in at it's lowest state of charge, and sometimes its good to put way more current than rated for smoothing growing dendrites and increased capacity as well as making the cell less likely to have an internal short.  
https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/03/researchers-heal-destructive-dendrite-growth-in-lithium-metal-batteries/

this one does seem to be able to do a constant current and voltage manually.  but havent tried this one

yea i thought about this.  they're too large so it'll have to be in 1p.

jehu did a test on these, they sag like a mf.

using a 4s1p @ 13.3v, 20a draw sagged down to 12.5v, and at 80a sagged down to 10.75v.

so that's 0.2v sag per cell at 20a, 0.65v at 80a per cell.

it might work, but not very energy dense either.

i have the one you posted above with the supposed 8amp ability and knob.  it will get up to 10amps with a really low pack as it's not cc.  its good. or was good until i dropped it for the millionth time and now back to my other.  the knobs and screens though are really nice.   

12s4p with the 30Q you can do a stated 16amp max charge.  that's ..like 45min to charge.

I'm pretty sure I can charge my pack in about 8min if I can deliver the current. A123 12s2p. Crazy! I think I can deliver, but it's hard to pull that much power out of a wall outlet.

awesome.  worth doing the fast charge in my mind.  i only charge just before riding so it's ideal.   i dont know what my wall will put out but i imagine i'll be able to bump it up later!

so many people are doing double stacks with the deck for range...id rather have the 12s2p smaller pack and bring a super fast charger and could go forever stopping at coffee shops to recharge.  im looking for the smallest 48 high current charger i can find.  want to be under the radar at the coffee shop.  if i trip a circuit breaker i will move on inconspicuously.

when kug3lis releases his esc i plan to make a 18s2p w/ 2 TB 6380's (if your hubs can handle it i will throw ur hubs on instead) but i want to build a super stealth build

at 18s w/ a 15/60 gearing on 6" pneumatics the calc is putting it at a speed of 49.45 mph... so with inefficiencies and what have you (and my fat ass), i would say optimistically 40mph top speed, with a board that you only know is motorized because of the motors hanging off the tail...

@uigiroux spec's are still changing but I will try to keep up with 18s as baseline :) Also I am redoing the whole schematic accommodating protections and etc, so MOSFET's wouldn't blow and etc. Also some new features like field weakening for higher RPM at the same voltage from same motors :) Also better sensorless application and brake-resistor and many more goodies :) But now I need to write software fully, as it isn't the same base platform as before so VESC will not be able to run on it :)

EDIT: for who are curious what is field weakening here is demo from someone on youtube ;)

The cheaper they are, generally the more 'aspirational' their stated specs are.   And yea, cooling.  They way they heatsink the mosfets are to put them at the edge of the circuit board and use a metal clamp to clamp them to the inside of the aluminum case.  The cases are thin aluminum plate so it doesn't work very well, If you start to push them anywhere near their stated specs, they get hot as hell and fail pretty quickly.   The first few I used, I ended up using heatsink adhesive to glue big heatsinks over the top of the hot spots on the case.   Pulling roughly 12-14A, worked great for about 2 years, then fried.  Eventually I just started using better quality PS's and overspecing them a bit.   Meanwell is a decent brand, have half a dozen of those that are running for up to 3 years 24/7, no heatsinks.  I am however running them at less than 70% max spec.

ive had good luck with my cheap ones and only one was faulty and right away could tell as it smelled and then a big snap.  they replaced it with a higher rated one and been good since.  ive had meanwells also.  biggest problem for me is breaking them from dropping them.  definitely worth mounting them to the wall or ceiling with a long charge cord so they dont fall over.  ive broken at least 4 that way!  they're not too hard to fix if you know what youre doing.

I modified a set of old base plates and mounted them on top of my drop through deck with longer bolts and it worked a treat.  looked like a drop through truck from the top with the truck mounted below.
Just cut off the raised section for the bushings and it acts like a double clamp.  Took a little while with the grinder and sander then a quick coat of satin black and it looked pro.  Depending on the truck you will get a gap that you could conceivably use for switches etc.  I've also done a similar thing with a baseplate to create a trailer hitch using the bushings as a swivel.  tows a deck with a back truck on and a milk crate which holds exactly one carton of beer.  Working on a quick release version now.  Will post pics when its done.

ive stared at ion cells and board thinking about it but I only glued lipo hard packs.   12s4p seems with the 6.6s seems challenging with wires and a bms and im just doing this part. bolting the cells down to the deck with other parts I designed and will 3d print and the compression foam i'm sure i told you.  And balance charge with a balance discharger (have to make a better one) and bulk charge fast to maybe only even just 4 a cell.  I wont be able to go far and just slay what's local.   sitting around for half an hour or an hour at home charging is a nice break and it's pretty physical and nerve racking with the traffic.  but if I wanted to go long late at night!  which i do.  Im waiting for a super charger. 
rather have a capacitor board could do a mile or two and then charge in a couple seconds and keep going the long distance.  Yea that's what Im working on next with tesla unhu.![Capture|690x277](upload://64Dg5EpBhhpJdeTciVKjnEFqEB3.JPG)

Admittedly, my math skills are crap, but I think the new split cutout is 168 mm wide, and V2 arc is only 165MM.  The single cutout version should work, you're right.  Cutout is 13 deep and The Arc is about 15mm deep so 28mm of depth, and I measure 35mm for stagger-stacked raw cells, before the pack is wrapped.   

Still be nice to have a stagger or double-stack deep enclosure but may not be enough demand to make it worth making a new mold, I have no idea.   I'd buy 1.   Actually, I usually f-up the first one of anything so maybe I'd buy 2.  :slight_smile: 

Disclaimer: the math here could be completely wrong or possibly right.

V2 is already wide enough for a larger cutout. The dimensions I list on the site are of the battery area of the enclosure. Look how much wider the flange makes it.

Hard to show and probably not the pics ur looking for.    Flipped and rode it that way again this morn.  Not as easy to turn of course but no wheelbite w me doing a circle in the intersection being 150lbs. It’s definately close though.

the only complication is the couple eu and au people on my list and want to make sure @bigben will take the eu ones and then will have a couple of the single hole boards still.  i see you on the list now.  

id like to keep these in stock permanently and still sell them at the same price but dont have the bucks to order in advance.

If 21 small vesc shaped objects packed into a box and shipped to EU cost €500, wouldn't 20 long-board decks cost 1000s to ship?

Do you mean sand to avoid wheel bite? Or sand for the base to fit? And have you tried to top mount it?

Is the box next to the bms really just a fuse box? I like how everything is enclosed and neat!

I’m guessing the bms is the one with the switch? Did you make those enclosures as well? Good to know dual foxboxes fit well! Though I’m routing mine wider to fit nese modules but should come out in a similar setup

[/quote]
Sand for the base to fit - the Hanger is a bit too wide for the cutout, so you have to widen the cutout of the deck on the bottom a bit so the hanger can move freely. Wheelbite should only be a thing if you reaaaaaally lean hard here.

[quote="Pedrodemio, post:1344, topic:43245"]

[/quote]
Yep, top mount will work too of course without modification.

[quote="Pedrodemio, post:1344, topic:43245"]

[/quote]
Same here with dirtroads, clearance is still awesome because of the cutout of the deck and the slim enclosure - so you should have similar clearance as an Trampa Cruiser with a enclosure underneath.
Good thing is, you can easily swap everytime to topmount if you don´t like it. But the dropthrough looks and feels so fuckn sexy, you don´t want to go somewhere else after that ;)

Thanks, I had a plan to place lights on the cutout for the drop through, I can fit 4 high power leds on the front and 6 WS2812 on the back. With them off it would be almost invisible 

Let’s see when everything arrives, I will try booth before putting the motors and electronics

My motors may have to be too low using the drop since my motor mount is only 65mm center to center

But I’m going with rear mount to keep dirt out of the motor

@Pedrodemio I just measured it closer to 17mm.
This was taking a straight edge length ways. The drop starts pretty much after the battery compartment.

Thanks, I will go ahead and modify my mounts for the TB trucks

If anyone want to know, ground clearance considering a 10mm enclosure should be:

Gummies / Dropped ~70mm
Gummies / Top Mount ~91mm
6,5" Pneumatic's / Dropped ~90mm
6,5" Pneumatic's / Top Mount ~111mm

Dropped it is

So we can expect to have the same issue with the newer decks? 

Doesn’t worry me too much as I was planning to top mount it first before I even try drop through but what kind of modification are we talking about here?

Is it because of the deck thickness that there’s not enough clearance from the baseplate to kingpin?
```

As far as I can tell, no changes has been done to the design except the double cutout hummie wanted on a few.

It's not the thickness of the deck, it's the hole that needs to be a bit wider/longer so you can fit the hanger there. Tb plates are a bit longer than calibers.
I'm hangover as fuck so that's the best explanation my brain could think off :grinning:

if you plan on modifying the hole do update keen to see how much actually needs to get shaved off. Strange how the SRs don't appear to have that kind of clearance issue. I recall seeing a dropped SR awhile back just can't remember who did it and I think those were the longer SR hangars as well

decks made it out of china and on the way!  hopefully the "trade war" wont effect things and no more holdups on route.  they seemed a while stuck there.

its probably worth sanding the sides of the cutout for the trucks a bit to allow for a full turn of the hanger and ill just hit with paris v2s taking the paint of the hanger and slightly denting the board in the middle of the cutout.  probably don't need to sand much.   
Id also sand the underside of the two bottom sides of both noses because when you go to pick the board up or push or drag it behind you on two wheels, which is nice, once it gets to a certain angle you'll hit the wood to the pavement and often it will chip.  if you sand it down to the washers and nuts under there you wont hit that wood and instead will hit the aluminum of the baseplate.

The glass frit will look a hundred times better than clear grip tape if you're wanting to see the carbon fiber

Foggy window grip tape is more appropriate

I might not do the whole board just sections kind of how people do with the hexagon grip. 
I also want to play with a mixture of black and silver to see how it blends with the carbon fiber colors and textures.

if the frit glass works thatd be fun to try.  was going to get every color and mix them.  maybe that's already available.  but from what i read ...the memory leaves me...red ember board's guy!  cant believe cant remember his name but remember that.   he said it would wear off eventually and then you could redo it if you wanted.   i find the defacto leave it alone until you really need to do something approach has taught me to ride without tape.  i turn while hanging far off the edge maybe.    i do enjoy pushing this board around a lot with these green wheels and slick top.  im not dancing as they say but constantly going back and forth goofy style.  or ride around standing facing straight ahead like a hoverboard is comfy.  those wheels, and maybe the board helps, will out roll anything.
unless theres traffic around i mostly kick the thing forward and jump on instead of hanging on with one foot and kicking.   i probably look ridiculous but am always getting in an aero tuck going down hill even slowly into the wind.  coming from a cycling background and feeling how the wind is the obstacle over 15mph you can really drop air resistance on a board.  i dont know frontal area is for either @professor_shartsis, but im guessing in a good aero truck on a board you could be more efficient on a flat than on an ebike at maybe 30mph.  will be testing that!   and then in a luge position at 60mph?
ok im not chatting with you today and have to find boxes and see what i can do for rest of the day and just stop for cereal and changing the music.  but retarded and dont have boxes.   they dont fall of the trees in this shape.  i will be wrestling with used boxes and some of you might get food boxes!  i sent one with just a label, no box, and just as nice.  if anyone wants it with no box please tell me. and im off on a box hunt now.  but back in a bit to hear if you have any great ideas for me to get boxes.

Why not just find long pieces of cardboard and just tape the shit out of the  deck (making it a really slim box) and just put maybe bubble wrap on the deck itself in the inside?
To me it doesn't have to be pretty, just to get to my door in one piece ROFL

If you have a local grocery store or something that handles boxes and stuff, like for me it's like IGA, Provigo etc, ask them if they have any boxes they don't use because usually they have a cardboard box press machine they use for the boxes they don't need.

I used the bottom T-nut on my current board nd you have to put the grip tape over them, you will end up with bumpy grip tape not to mention having to drill through the carbon fibre layer.

This is what I have in the garage waiting for the deck, they are M4 internal thread and 10mm long. I'm planning to get M4 cap head bolts with washers for a bit of an aircrafty riveted look, they will probably need to be 15-18mm long to allow for the enclosure and a rubber seal.

Your electronics should be mounted to the board not the enclosure, if its mounted to the enclosure and something hits it at 30k/h it would not be good for your battery.
I would only mount the Focboxes to the enclosute but that would only be for cooling purposes with one of those cnc'd plates with cooling fins, also it would mount right at the back end of the enclosure.

I am worried of drilling through that carbon fiber layer to put my inserts in which are like these... Maybe I should opt for a different insert?

I haven't mesured how far from the bottom the carbon layer is but my brass inserts are 10mm long, I think it should be fine with some apoxy to glue them in.

I used the uxcell threaded inserts. Either use epoxy to secure them or use the wooden inserts.  I only had one come loose(all screwed in no epoxy).  M6xm4 is a good size.

I’m planning on using these:

They require a tool to install properly but stainless steel and bulletproof.  The tools can be pretty expensive but AliExpress has a few inexpensive ones.

@Hummie  You drill a blind hole, snug but not too tight,press them in.  the inside half of the insert is threaded and the outside half is unthreaded.  The tool screws into the threads and pulls the threaded part toward the outside causing the unthreaded part to expand out and secure the insert in the hole (theoretically).  Same principal as a blind rivet, but in reverse, kindof.   not a very good explanation,, heres a pic.

@L3chef   Well, that's just great, lol, I haven't used these in this kind of application, so it's an experiment.  That price is insane...  Did you use the stainless ones?  I know in softer materials like wood you have to get the hole sized just right if it's too tight, it'll crush the wood.   I have some threaded nut inserts as a backup in case don't seat securely enough I should be able to reuse the holes.

here's what teh tool does to them.  I over-squished it cause i just threw it on the tool and squeezed, you can control how much you expand them.

I need the cutout widened by about 20mm on one end to fit dual flipsky6, thinking about chiseling it out, has anyone done this?

I will do that to mine, enlarge the width and length a bit, the best way is to make a guide using wood so you keep it straight and print one of these to attach to the dremel

Or best yet, see if you can't find someone with a proper router, it will be much faster

I widened one of mine with a circular saw. (5mm) Set the depth right, cut along the line and perhaps a couple more cuts if it’s s wide one. Then clean up with a very sharp chisel.

By guide I mean just getting a flat piece of wood, securing it to the deck somehow, double sided tape or some clamps, and using it to run the dremel along

Will try to remember to take photos, but will be using a Black n Decker full sizer router that I have, but the process should be the same, you will just need to do more passes with the dremel since the bits are quite small

Also this is the bit I recommend, I use it to do wire channels, with the router bits there's too much vibration for manual work

I just bought a cheap router from Harbour Freight, but I had also planned on using it for some other projects and it wasn't really the right tool for the job so I ended up returning it, lol, so was able to do that for free.  I did end up buying the right tool I needed though so it wasn't like I just bought it and then returned once I finished modifying my board, that would be kinda messed up.

But they have a bunch of different options for routers and dremel tools for super cheap so if you plan on doing this to a few boards it's worth the investment.

My pack ended up about 4mm too big. It's raining outside so no powered router today. I'm going in with chisels and a marking gauge. Hmmm! If I get sad I'll set up the router. But it's such a pain with clamping square onto curved things, or getting the template guides, measuring 100 times, still getting it wrong, etc.

Let's see if watching all those Paul Sellers videos payed off.

EDIT after 8 inches or so setting up the router doesn't seem so bad :slight_smile:

For the old timey woodworker wannabes, this is what I was trying to do.

Finally it stopped raining. I did one side with chisel and hammer while it was raining, and the other side with a router. Making this post because I think I came up with a clever easy way to jig up for the router. I found a piece of wood about the same depth as the cavity and taped it to the bottom of the router. In the corners, I untaped and just put the spacer piece inside the cavity and ran the router on top of it.

I wanted the guide to be on the outside, which is why all the thinking. if the guide was on the inside the router bit would be constrained on both sides, which makes me nervous.

The chisel took hours, and many sharpenings. As I got tired, which was fast and often, I'd get sloppy. There was some hard wood at one part, must have been knots in the ply.

The router, I thought about how to jig it up for like a week, but the actual setup and routing was very quick. Nice neat results, with just a few glitches.

I had to freehand the chamfer for the phase wires -- the router V bit with the guide bearing stuck out too far to the bottom. Dremel with sanding barrel.

I always try to do the best I can, because part of it for me is learning how to do something, and how far I can take it. But I always glitch at some point. :) Always more to learn.

No, just a 3S Lipo form Hobbyking, and that was before all the shipping regulations and etc

Fortunately they have been faster recently, ordered all parts for the @solidgeek remote a little more than a month ago from Aliexpress and almost all of them are already here

Plus they implemented a online system to pay for taxes when needed, so way faster to receive

That being said, a few weeks ago they imposed a new 15 BRL (aprox 3.6 USD) tariff on everything, so cheap things with free shipping you end up paying more on taxes than the product, sometimes double, not worth anymore

I hand chiseled out extra width for a wider battery. The loss of laminate resulted in an unacceptably flexy deck, which I stiffened with a carbon/foam medium/carbon sandwich under mild compression during cure. The resulting flex pics are acceptable for me and represent max flex and rebound from several increasing bounces from a 165lbs rider (feet left board). 

TLDR: easy to cut more space. Take too much and you should reinforce.

I was sick of seeing the NESE modules being so expensive for what they are, and shipping from EU is really not very worth for me when I can just design my own.
[/quote]

[quote="Winfly, post:1564, topic:43245, full:true"]
oh yeah I also hate how NESE is so big and such a waste of space. @skunk I need to figure out how to mass produce them and source hardware cheaper. and I can easily make a double stack version. this design is kinda still take sometime to assemble tho. I’m working on v0.2 for some slight changes. more flexible between series and rigid.
[/quote]
Don't know whats you agenda with so much hate. I really like the way you put it: "oh yeah I also hate how NESE is so big and such a waste of space." The thingy you are working on is 1.37 liters for 10S, NESE is 1.41 liters for 10S, thats 40 milliters difference in volume  :laughing: (1.35 ounces for American friends) I mean, you sacrifice so much convenience and use words like "huge" for scraps? Real "ingenuity", i give you that.
And yes, they are more expensive, cause quality, engineering does come at a price.
You can bang your tabs with a hammer or hand press but this is contact based connection and precision must be high. You play with high currents here.
BTW, you can download models for free and print them, DIY your tabs and it will cost you nothing.
I hope you succeed, but there is no point trashing something i worked hard for long time.

Yo. Am I bad mouthing your business? At what point did I trying to "trash" your design? Can I not have my own option? Perhaps my use of "hate" was inappropriate. I do apologize for that. I genuinely do like your design but it's just not as compact as I would like it to be. IMO I think length is more important than the overall volume of the cell holder since people usually like to lay their batteries along the length of their deck. 

At the end of the day. it's the people here decide what is best suited for their build. I appreciate your concerns and I will take them into my consideration. Please tone down your attitude and your passive aggressiveness.

I've been following NESE and @agniusm  closely. He participates mostly in the NESE thread, and for the most part he's been quite helpful. Sometimes, he has a dismissive tone, but hey we're all human :slight_smile: I'm actually surprised at how much he shares given how some of his information was hard won through many trials and errors, and is the basis for his business.

I've also purchased from him and he was awesome to deal with.

I'm also all over the hummie threads.

The way I saw this develop, there were many people using NESE products with hummie deck. @winfly posted some interesting and exciting ideas, but in his excitement didn't choose the "polite" wording.

I thought it was appropriate for Agnius to come to his product's defense. And he did so in a polite and factual manner.

Gee boy, what aggressiveness? You called out the duel with "sick" "monopoly" "hate" "huge". Thats just pure hate and aggressiveness towards my product and the arguments you have are just not valid. You could say that you prefered it as compact as possible but you trashed it saying its huge when in fact i showed that its not. Sure its longer and that might be a problem for someone but its thinner. Anyway, was not forcing in any way, anyone to buy it. If you think you will get respect being hostile to me or my product, you are  too deep rabits hole and anyone with the same attitude will get same treatment. Maybe i am a vendor but i am no like other and i will point out to your face if i think you are wrong and i dont care if you will "freeze to death" and i dont sell you my heater.

zortrax 200 printer.  what you mean by having it covered?  I actually cover it with a rag or something to hold in heat but generally it doesn't need it but this part is 205mm long and the edges peel if you have any solutions.  infact I have some other filament now but it's also doing the same.  I forget the terminology but the raft or something keeps separating.  its not the part separating from the support but the support or raft separating from itself.   see if I can alter it how it makes the raft but haven't figured it.  ive never even tried pla on this thing and always good with abs as long as not so long

From what you have explained, it might be shrinking. ABS requires about 90 degrees Celsius surrounding temperature while printing. I am new to this but someone with more 3D printing experience can help. @skatardude10 

Your printer already has an enclosure, so nevermind my keep it covered suggestion.

If you can do with a few C less temp resistance than ABS but still very temperature resistant compared to PLA, try PETG. 

I find 3D Solutech PETG works amazing compared to other PETG I've tried- minimal warping, minimal shrinkage.

ABS is kind of dated, and it's always going to be troublesome... For example, nylon is notoriously difficult to print, warps and shrinks... And I have much better success with Nylon than ABS. Nylon and PETG completely took ABS's place for me: Nylon for very very strong but needing to flex a tad without breaking parts and PETG for rigid parts that aren't expected to be subjected to flex forces (may crack) but still needs to be strong.

As for getting your prints to not warp- don't print such large parts with ABS. You need round edges instead of sharp edges on parts that contact the build plate. I've had success with a glass build plate compared to other build Tak like surfaces if that's what you have. A clean glass slate cleaned with acetone, then isopropyl alcohol, then 3-4 layers of well layed glue stick works for me with ABS. I have not had any success with ABS slurry, but I hear that works for a lot of people getting ABS to stick. 

For sure if you don't have a permanent enclosure, make one if you plan to stick with ABS or print in Nylon eventually. Reduce drafts. Heat your bed hot- 105C works for me. Make sure your first layers with ABS are printed 10C hotter than the rest, 255C maybe? To go that hot, ensure you have an all metal hot end. Print first layer slow and consider an extra 1-10% extrusion multiplier on the first layer. Rafts are great sometimes but you say you have some trouble with them, I can't help you here because I avoid rafts if at all possible... I stick with brims of at least 7mm, up to 15mm. 

Hope this helps

I hear this often but I just don't get it.  I print with ABS almost exclusively and I very seldom have issues.  When I do its mostly because of the model and not the material.  I'm using a Lulzbot Taz Mini with PEI sheet.

So I bought a bunch of color change ABS when HK was clearing them out. I think I went through 1.5 spools trying to print a certain un-named modular box that lets you build solderless battery packs (;) ) The 4p version. I'm on a Prusa MK3.

Initially I had corner lifting -- a lot of it. I cleaned the hell out of the PEI sheet, elevated some temperatures, tweaked speeds, extrusion multiplier, added a huge brim, and even built a styrofoam enclosure. The corner lifting was improved but not solved, but there are distortions due to the higher temperature and the shrinkage, elephant foot, etc., so the fit of the lid is compromised.

You can blame the model I suppose, but I have similar issues with anything around this scale.

PLA and PETG I have some issues with, but not nearly this bad. ABS is actually kicking my ass! I have some other things I can try, like mickey mousing the corners, ABS slurry or gluestick. Or heating the enclosure. First printer, so probably me being n00b but I tried a lot of stuff! I get passable prints but not great, and pretty high rejection rate.

I'm jelly @mmaner

I do have a full enclosure, its gets pretty warm in there quick.  That's probably a lot of why I rarely have issues.  If you have a heated bed, make a plexi enclosure and make sure its sealed really well.  A long thin slot in the top so the filament can pass unobstructed, but other than that closed up tight.

Looks like it might be fine as far as having space for inserts. Probably need to epoxy them in just in case. As you can see the right side is all smooth, the left side looks like I chewed it 🤦‍♂️  I didn’t want to smooth it down because it would take more off

I had fitted my 10s5p in just barely. I am waiting on the FOCBOX Unity now and I will be saving a lot more space soon. The flipsky dual 4.20 has some minor bugs but this deck has been amazing with 75a Flywheels, the carbon fiber making it look :ok_hand:  ![image|375x500](upload://el2FcIPKs4nl6FHgNIhGpG5NNie.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://fnPAes42TxeU02WbxW6ySIFaVNh.jpeg)  ![image|500x500](upload://qY00tkyFfAazfGLPqmV1fMNFb7R.jpeg)

My 6354 motors are doing just fine, they take amps like a champ on FOC. It's only this flipsky vesc causing some small problems, it can't take inflow current readings so it can cause overcurrent faults for no reason.  Honestly the torque and all is exactly where I like it, but one of these days the faults is gonna get to me, until then I will wait for my Unity.

It's here

Thanks Hummie, ended costing way more than I would like but that's due to customs here and crazy shipping prices

The only suggestion I have is for the electronics compartment be flat, they CNC it, it makes no sense to it to follow the concave of the board when everything we will mount to it is flat

I always assumed it would be flat from the pictures, will put my router to work to level it out to make the thinnest enclosure possible

Thanks for the tip, I tested it being supported by my shoes and definitely there is flex, I like it since the goal for this build is being able to ride on really crap roads, also my battery is flexible, so no worry's there

Unfortunately there is no way for me to leave as is, I can't afford to make a new battery pack right now, so it has to fit my old 10S3P that is using wires to reinforce the nickel strips

Interesting how they mesh I wonder if it will have to grind itself into meshing or what if you bounce on the deck n jump in the air.  But i hate on everyone’s enclosure. I like how it’s separate parts. I’m making one really similar in that way.  

  I’d want it more with the teeth not tightly meshing, loose, and maybe even more overlap cause it looks awesome and then if you wanted could add a rubber at the joints.  I mean in my fantasy

like this? more pics [here](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words-use-pm/2992/7541?u=mishrasubhransu). I 3D printed a previous iteration, where seam was just horizontal strap, and it honestly looked very bland, but functionally the concept worked out pretty well. Can't wait to print this updated version and assemble it on the deck. 

BTW, if you are printing something like this, print each module standing up, gives it strength in the right direction. It's about 125 gram per module so with a $20 filament roll(1KG), it will cost you $15 to print the whole enclosure.

By standing up you mean flat on the print bed? Also I would recommend doing an interlocking pattern or the pieces have a greater chance to split when the deck flex

Hmm, interlocking would be nice for flex but would not be good for ingress protection. I am using PETG to print which is kinda flexible so hope it can manage the flex in the board. For super flex board I would further subdivide the segments so that I can slip in smaller segments in between that is printed in TPU(flexible filament). What doyou think?

I meant the axis along the lengtt of the board is the z axis of printer. That way it will have a lot of flex along the width of the board and even if delamination happens and you have some loose parts in the enclosure, the can't fall through the enclosure. Don't know if that explanation made sense or not.

“Dear John,
Yes, extra 10% since [Aug 23rd](x-apple-data-detectors://1) and 15% more since [Jan 1st, 2019](x-apple-data-detectors://2) as well. 
1 month for production and 7 days for freight, so if u wanna to prepare for X'mas and avoid the new extra tarrif, you would better place the order within this week. 
To the new order, it needs to start with 50 pcs in the same price. If ur money is not enough, you could pay 40pcs, but we can make 50pcs for u. When the cargo ready, and then u pay the rest 10pcs and the freight as well..

BR,
Betty”

So we’d have to hurry to stay with the 10% tariff or it jumps to 15% by the time they ship.   

125$ each with USA shipping and we can do it.   In the past I did friend n fam to them and in the future with this much money I’d do it regular insured paypal to them.  


So if ur still interested speak up n we can see if we can get it done and stay at the 10% tariff.

Shipping can be done for £30. It's a cheaper option and insurance would probably be for £50. More insurance could be bought for a few pounds.

Not an option with the manufacturer

Wish someone would buy ten or twenty. It would be a cheaper price as shipping is like 20% from me on with one board.  Be like 110 each.

Actually let me do the math again n see maybe can sell them all cheaper.  I did before but shipping cross country w insurance was like 35$.

<h1>Announcement: what do you think if this?</h1>

Would people be interested in Hummie deck with modular bolt on cell holders with additional Electronics compartment piece? It is a Hummie Deck combo so basically the "@hummie complete" without the drive train and/or electronics. 

It will be the double cutout deck with 6 piece 2s4p cell holder segments and a 1 piece enclosured electronics compartment segment. There would be option for blank electronics compartment or a custom one with selected electronics. Pieces will be silicone casted. 

Details and price will be polished out soon. I need to discuss with @hummie as he's not good at pricing his products.

<h2> Hummie Deck Full Kit? </h2>(Someone give it a better name) 

[poll type=multiple min=1 max=3 public=true]
* Modules only please (if you already bought a double cutout)
* Interesting keep me posted
* Broke from Black Friday but will start saving

I received a double cutout from hummie, didn't find anyone that could make a good enclosure until @Pedrodemio help me into making an specific 3D file for the double cutout.

And I have to say it fits perfectly !

Thanks again.

Definitely a lot of effort.

But I think it is rewarding.  And I am getting better and faster.

And the effort and time comes in bursts.  15 min here, wait to cure, 20 minutes there, wait to cure.  Sand when I can.

It's not really something you can just crank out.

I have 3 kids in the house under 5 and my wife works weekends, so it all works out really well.

"Sweet, the kids are asleep, I am going to add epoxy"

Or

"Nice, they are watching a show, I'll get a few minutes of sanding in"

Im not buying it bud.

It's more like "sweet the kids are having a nap (phone auto corrected that to anal 😂) I'll get 5 mins of sanding in"

Walk down the hallway, turn around to get your stuff ready, turn back and there's two children on top of the deck, smearing epoxy on each other with 12 toys glued to their bodies and your wife is in the doorway with those judgmental eyes, just judging you all the way down to your soul.

And one of them has shat.

oh I have no problem with it because I know we have wonderful people like Tim that would make it stronger, just didn't know you actually saw the CF layer being taken away. I thought you didn't notice it. Chinese factory mess up is always expected. I decided to cut out the sides a bit and that's when I no longer trusted it with my fat a$$ on it.

There was a zombie fabric that looked cool. I think I was more intrigues with skull because of how it looks on Joe/SoCalLegend's hydrodipped deck

Trying to talk my buddy into a hummie deck. Hes planning his first build. Isn't on the site yet.  
He wants to press his own (he won't lol) 
Hopefully there's one left when he finally realizes he's to lazy to press a deck

I used to press decks. What a rediculous expensive pile of work for what wasn’t very nicely done

These decks have shown really good so far with no delaminating and a good feel w slight flex yet covering the majority of the electronics.  In my experience with a deck that completely contains the electronics, and thicker, it gets too rigid and stiff. If it rides like ur on a log or an aluminum truss structure it hugely takes from the experience

Flat a 12s5p will fit in the deck cutout but thats about all. No bms or esc. You would have to go double stack, and would be worth fitting in a 12s6p if you were going double. I don't know that the arc does the double stack but I think he does another one that can be made to fit. Otherwise @JLabs should be getting some of my enclosures soon. (double and single)

Hi, looking at Hummie deck for my build.
Does anyone have any side by side pics against some 37 inch boards, eg boosted.

I will probably be using rear mounted motors.

Thats priced to have the weight of an enclosure and plenty of packing.
Deck £100, enclosure £45

Ok I fucked up. Seems there’s 29 orders for the deck on the google doc and I only have 25 of the single hole that just came. I didn’t realize how fast they all sold this time.  I packed 2/3 yesterday and should get them to the po today after work and can get the rest out tomorrow but if any of u are willing to either get the two hole deck, I have a bunch and could send those, or wait another maybe two months...or I’ll have to send bucks back to the last people on the list. Sorry!  I’ll write the last people on the list tonight and see what you want to do.

Needed to order 50 to get them made so I put up the bucks for the 25 anf got Ben to do the same and then started the google form. In the past I’d sell maybe half by the time they came.  Out of nowhere 29 ordered.   Sorry I wasn’t thinking possible.

Hummie, not to complain, I love my deck, but you definitely need a better system to track who ordered the things you sell so things like that don’t happen

I know you do that because you just want as much people to get the cool things you make, but it will help you and the people that want to buy

I obviously didn't remove this one.

But you could, and simply reinforce it, even add a layer on top like these.

Hand router would be pretty easy. But be sure to take your time and got one of two layers at a time. 

I plan to route my extra one when I get to that deck. Definitely better than routing the two sides the first time.

Yea. I’m kind of at a loss. I’m fine with dimples but mine runs the entire length of the edge.  In order to get it smooth I’d have to sand through the carbon fiber. It’s almost like it’s bubbled.

selling the few double hole decks with usa shipping for 110$ each!!!!
   its very possible to use these with ion or lipo and will have some options for ion in a day or two.

   If youre local you can take this double hole deck from me with unused 8amphour 12s (zippy flightmax) I have above..for 300$.    they're glued in.  if you wanted them off you can cut the shrink on them and easy to get out.   locat only for that as I don't want to ship it.

Nice! Thats rad.  Hummies on Hummies. Mmm hmmm.

@venom121212 is getting this cool circuit board fabric.

![20190122_210239|690x335](upload://bsw0mrNsZg4Jrz8iNHaPM4GQ0U2.jpeg)  
 
And hopefully some glow in the dark glass frit!

Testing on some scraps set in the epoxy, hopefully works well.

very nice.  what have you stuck under resin?  a cartoon strip or maybe something small to read. if youre putting down frit might as well.   for people to stare at.   but that pattern of the circuit is more subtle.  still pretty busy.   the hazard board in comparision is not subtle

about to finally finish this thing.  really liking the flipsky smart antispark.  push to start.  simplifies a lot.   tempted to wire it in solo but will put a loopkey in.  

but the frit..im still liking my grip free deck I push around all the time.   I bet a lot of people are riding with no griptape! bare as can be.  how is it?

Completes seem like a headache to support. You sure you want to get involved with that? Just sell a kit and let them assemble it themselves. That way you don’t have to warranty someone else’s mistakes.

This is a crazy mixed up setup, but it rides beautifully, even with stock barrel/cone bushings up front. Got a TB 218 truck up front, mounted drop through with Psychotiller 6 shooters, and the notorious Carvon SDXL's in rear, top mounted on a 44° Caliber base plate with Abec 107's and the deck sits almost perfectly level. Feels very stable at speed even with super loose and maneuverable trucks, and grips and carves like crazy with the pneumies up front. Took me forever to get this board built, but I'm already in love with how it rides, especially with my Frankenfiguration.

Taking the seals off I found delicate work and easy to slightly bend them. 
With c-clip tool u can get to that big inner bearing seal but the outer..next design won't have so much lip covering the bearing so u can pull the seal there too.  Maybe u could just clean it well and jam grease in through the seal crack.  If you could seal around the bearing somehow and force the grease through be easiest and no seal damage If only had the perfect grease gun tip

If u send ur motors back sometime for bearings I can alter the bell so u can get to the outer bearing seal in the future

@Hummie

question... so from scrubbing other threads on this a 12s4p fits perfect. thisguy long ago expressed a desire to do a 5p...which would be a double stack and thus require a custom enclosure of some sort right? so whether I was interested in a 5p (why not 6p lol) would you say a double stack protruding out of the integrated area would be the equivalent to a single stack on any "regular" non integrated board?

im on the fence... Im semi close to building a 6p AT board  , top mount is the current plan.... but im not happy with running all the wires to box unless I rear mount the vesc to keep it even more clean IMO... #offtopic but not. thx lemme know

Well that is a subjective question but right at the top it states it can handle a 12s4p if your looking for a low profile stealth build which it's plenty of power and range for most people on thane.... 
Vesc options are unity or focbox if you can find em (I have a few for sale) or flipsky.... There's some other options but those would be the go to's

Otherwise double stack for crazy range on pnuemis! I can also build if need be.

psycho makes an enclosure bespoke to this deck.

i've used this with a 12s4p flat pack with great results.

if you can't find a battery, PM me, we can discuss.

all of these configurations will work / fit in hummie deck:

If you are concern with water and dust seal, then you might want to add 2 or even four more bolts so there's more/even pressure on the seal.

From your planned bolting picture, I would be concerned with the four corners with no bolts.

@Mikenopolis 
No, not really, I will have 10mm of neoprane in between, this method worked me very well regardings water and dust, I'm mainly concerned about actuall integrity, the enclosure with the carbon wrap seems fairly stiff to accommodate a few bolts less, but I'm not sure yet.

Neoprene underneath as well. I'd add 4 more in the corners. Also use rubber washers underneath whatever bolts or fender washers you end up using. It definitely helps them not come loose.

In the end I took like 2 hours to think things threw, also tested how much the enclousure flexes and decided to go with this patern, even with only end bolts the enclousure is completly solid.

@Hummie is this the enclosure you get when you order the deck + enclosure from the google form for $215 (eu)?

Moreover, if diyelectricskateboards is making somekind of clone, it will be even more difficult.

if you want to spend like 50$ bucks more there's other options out there these days for almost the same deck..  do those have carbon or are they all wood?

No offence, but nonchalant comments like is this probably why the group buy is so slow "yeah whatever I'll knock abit off the price. whatever just re-shipping them"

If you're serious about this, just order all the decks yourself, add in some profit for it to make sense.  Throw them up on a website that anyone can go in and buy one.  

Slow group buys with competitors right at your heels are not doing you any favors.  If you just want to focus on your hubs and don't really care about the decks anymore, that's totally fine. But just say so.  That way you wont be stringing people along.

The decks are being made n be 4 weeks.  Prices 
80 if u pick up
The rest of the prices are on the google doc in the thread above.  But no rush n not here yet. 

If u want it shipped far I’ll figure it when they come

If u want an enclosure I’ll figure that by when the decks come and will be an option
