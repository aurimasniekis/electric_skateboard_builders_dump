Hey everyone! I know alot of us ordered the Landyachtz mystery box. Some of us were satisfied, some of us were left wanting more and more.

I'm making this thread as a spot where people can post what they got and want to trade out of their boxes.

If you guys think this is redundant, feel free to yell at me over the internet and we can take it down.

For me, I got a drop carve 40 that I have no interest in, I have 3 other decks that are very similar to it. I'd like something from the hollow tech line or a topspeed!

The drop carve is the deck on the right of the picture below.

I didn't get a box guys and I'm bitter as they come.

So anything you don't want you can just ship directly to me and I will give you nothing in return.

Many thanks

But they do add an extra 3000w per motor. I shark tanked this the other day so its 100% true.

I'm looking for polar bear 85mm and have my medium gloves up for sale or trade. Turns out I'm a large glove size.

Contemplating on trading the top speed for a switchblade deck

I may keep it as a pusher. I honestly have too many boards at this point. I don't mind refining the builds I have but I think I'm satisfied with my setup. :slight_smile:
 
I really want a drop through deck though. I've been eyeing the switchblade for a few years now ever since I got my switch.

Not sure how I feel about the long deck. The clear glass frit is sweet but Idk how well it would electrify. I have a set of hub motors I wanted to throw on a long deck.

I do like that drop carve. They would take my new hub motors pretty well for a street carver. Not exactly a fair trade though :thinking:
