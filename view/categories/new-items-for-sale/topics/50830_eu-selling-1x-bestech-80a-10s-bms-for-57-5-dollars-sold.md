Hi I got a good deal from Bestech on 2x 10s 80a BMS with eswitch for 115 dollars including shipment . So I only need one, so I would like to sell the other, I'm not going to make any money on it so its just for sale. The price (57.5) is without shipment. I can ship it to you from Denmark to EU countries.
