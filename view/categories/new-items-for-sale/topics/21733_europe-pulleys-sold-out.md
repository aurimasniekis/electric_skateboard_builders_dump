Hello Europe e-skaters, my name is Luis aka Tito and with the help of @rwxr I'd like to offer you 15mm pulleys at a great price. I purchased in large quantity and I hope it helps some of you out in your builds. The two pulley options I have available is 15t and 40t.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/9/b911bbc9c134e108411546e6f79fddfcb76a2bd2.jpg" width="666" height="500">
 
The motor pulley is 15mm HTD5 15t steel pulley with 8mm bore and 3mm keyway. It comes with two set screws and 3mm key. (With minor modification this motor pulley will fit Evolve).
 
The wheel pulley is 40t for abec flywheels (90mm+ recommended) and MBS all terrain wheels. Material is aluminum and screws are M5.
 
Prices are:
$10 for steel 15t 15mm pulleys
$13 for 40t Abec flywheel pulley
$20 for a set with both pulleys

Shipping prices are:

Hi, Very nice steel pulley!
Do you know they also fit on 83mm Flywheel clones?
I would love to buy them if they should fit :heart_eyes:

There are people using on 83mn wheels, but I would recommend more for 90mm+ wheels since radius of 40t pulley is 3mm bigger than 36t pulleys.

Does the wheel pulley fit flywheel clones?
```

---
## \#35 Posted by: rwxr Posted at: 2017-05-14T15:22:34.285Z Reads: 129

```
They do. However, they are best used on 90mm or above wheels. 
They of course work on 83mm wheels aswell, but there will be less clearance.
```

---
## \#36 Posted by: zeah Posted at: 2017-05-14T15:47:23.859Z Reads: 128

Ok. I have 83mm wheels but i¬¥m gona get 97mm wheels. I think it would be perfect for this pulley.
So one complete set + untracked letter = $26.5
Is that correct?

```
5M + number of teeth defines dimension of the pulley. Diameter of the 5M 40T is 63.66mm and for the pulley on the picture, add about 3-4mm to accommodate the flange.
```

---
## \#47 Posted by: Titoxd10001 Posted at: 2017-05-23T21:19:29.116Z Reads: 113

```
Diameter of flange is 71.2mm. You may have issues using them on 83mm wheels if you ride through a lot of debris and cracks. If you really want to use them you may have to remove flange because someone managed to bend flange with 83mm wheels. Tooth diameter is about 62.5mm
