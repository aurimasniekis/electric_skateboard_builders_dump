Hey Guys

I'm about to order from Nkon, wondering if anyone else from australia needed any cells.
If so drop me a PM :slight_smile:

@moderators can y’all just give your boy mod so I don’t have to tag you every time this happens?

What?
I've already done two group buys without any problems (one via PM for taobao, plus a large torqueboards one: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/torqueboards-218mm-extended-caliber-clones-australia/28020)

Sorry @overint
you have to be a level 3 to organize a group buy in the forum
And you may not circumvent the rule by posting group buys in the wrong category.
