The mount you probably have seen already, but now the cheapest on the market! Yes sir you heard it right, you can get these puppies for $15/20 a piece!
Okay I lied the shipping is $3 USA $13 International.

Copy paste of everything I have written:

Introducing the Boardnamics Caliber II Motor Mount, an essential piece to your DIY electric skateboard build. This is the foundation of the entire drive train, responsible for mounting your brushless motor and aligning the timing belt to the wheel. Built and designed from the ground up to be reliable in rough conditions, this mount features CNC machined aluminum pieces. Made of 6061 T6511 aluminum which helps cool the motor and provide strength all while being lightweight. Nylon lock nuts prevents loosening from vibration during riding.
 
The slotted design allows this mount to be rotated and flipped in any direction you want. It IS reverse mountable.

The non idler lets you choose between 2 different arm pieces, 50mm or 63mm depending on what size your motor is. 63mm bolt holes are 44mm diagonally, 50mm are 30mm diagonally.

Idler Version:
The idler version of the mount features an adjustable idler tensioner that was once a first of its kind back in 2017. An idler pulley changes the path taken by the timing belt in order to engage more teeth on the motor pulley. This results in increased torque transfer without the skipping often seen with high power/fast acceleration setups. For setups that want the very best power transfer possible, this is the better choice.

Specifications:

Arm Thickness: 6.35mm (1/4")

Clamp Thickness: 9.6mm

Weight: 63mm Edition (177g) 50mm Edition (159g)

Center Distance: 70mm +-8mm

Recommended Belt Length: 255mm-275mm

What's Included:

Aluminum Pieces:
x1 Arm (50mm or 63mm)
x2 Clamp Bracket

Hardware:
x4 M4 x 20mm 12.9 SHCS
x4 M4 A2 SS Nylon Locknut
x2 M6 x 40mm 12.9 SHCS
x2 M6 A2 SS Nylon Locknut
x4 M4 x 8mm A2 SS Torx

don't machine basic pulleys go for chains if your makeing something. 
People who love belts will still buy the chains for science.

Just buy a few sprockets and drill holes in em thats it.

There is always gonna be a drivetrain debate. There's threads on it all the time. If I were to do pulleys, I'd buy pulley stock and cut it to 15mm slices.

Sprockets, not sure

I made a mirror copy of the idler arm so now if you order 2 idler mounts, the idlers will be on the same side. This was requested for a while :slight_smile:

did anyone mention that a lil groove or notch where the idler pulley nut is is helpful? just a thought... on my marc mounts I like how it holds the nut for me when tightening down the idlers instead of needing an extra tool to hold if/when it spins... this is one thing Im thinking about on this dickyho mount im using for a diff board.

It can be because you run into the issue where the wheel intersects with the idler itself. If you tell me the gear ratio, I can check for you.

I can do that but it adds a lot of machining time because I have to flip the part and square it.

So two questions. First is based on @Bor.inc question. 97mm with a 35mm pulley and the idler kit. Will that work? Also, can these face both forward and backwards for dual diagonal or diagonal on the same truck?

What motor pulley? Also, yes they can be mounted in any orientation. The arm piecr has a circular slot pattern so it doesn't matter which slots you use where.

Any purchase of 2x idler mounts will have mirrored arms so the idlers are in the same side

So if i understand correctly.
The mount with no idler you tighten belt by adjusting the motor and with the mount that has idler you adjust tension with the postion of the idler?

Will the Idler version workm with Racestar 5065 motors and can they be mounted asymmetrically (one normal and one in reverse) without messing up the idler position?

Looks very promising!

Yes they can be mounted. With the purchase of 2 idler arms, I by default send mirror copies so 2 forward would have both idlers top or bottom. Upon request I can send 2 of the same to do what you're describing.

Thank you for the flexibility. I must take a day to consider if I should do a asymmetrical build or buy some 218mm Caliber Clones From Diyelec or something and then I will place an order.

Edit: I might also consider the other mounts instead, guessing that the mirror-problem isnt present for them.

As for everybody else, ordered more idler belts and bearings last week from China and have yet to get notification they shipped. Sucks because it's the only thing I source overseas and because of that it takes the longest to get.

I have no idea how in the heck you‚Äôre profiting from these mounts but shit.   Your stuff is legit brother.  Yes. They took a little longer than expected to get here but totally worth the wait 
visually everything looks amazing!   Some Advice.  Use a little bit of tape to seal the box for extra strength.   Mine popped open during transportation but everything seems to be here.  No damage or missing pieces 
Just thought I‚Äôll mention that just to save you some possible trouble with an unhappy customer üòÅüëçüèº

Working on the printed pulley covers. So far I am designing two versions; small wheel (83mm-97mm) to large wheel (97mm-110mm) version to account for different wheel diameters.

I am implementing a chamfered edge as well as a facing operation on both sides of the part which will greatly enhance the overall look and finish. They will have that mirror-like shine :D 
Right now, I hit the whole part with a wire wheel which makes them smooth but roughens the finish. Now I get the best of both worlds!

It's interesting to see my own product being assembled, never seen it before haha.

Makes me want to do an installation video myself. There is a certain tightening order with the clamp pieces that works best. In the video, I couldn't tell if u tightened the 4 smaller screws all the way. Ideally they should be lightly snugged up so that way the big 2 bolts can move the pieces together to clamp the truck. Then after it's all done you tighten the 4 small screws to lock it in place 

I'll make a little installation manual over my school break :)

I sorta figured that out when playing around with them - once you tighten the 2 big bolts down you cant really move the plate as it clamps it in between the 4 small bolts.

Yeah it's a bit weird. I oversized all the holes to combat this. Its a good idea to snug up the 4 screws first because then the clamp pieces sit flush with the arm. 

Maybe I'm overthinking it. Tighten the bolts and it ain't going nowhere :)

I am working on getting these out faster. I make them all myself. Even with a machine and all it still takes probably 25 minutes per mount from start to finished product. I try to get them as perfect as I can but I am realizing most people don't notice the little impurities.

How did you design the clamp?  Does the profile of the trucks perfectly match a box with a semicircle or do I have to adjust the arc?  Do you know the measurements for TB trucks?  I am trying to draw up a clamp in Solidworks.

I took the cross section of a normal caliber and copied it. Because it is a cast truck, it's not an exact measurement so more often than not its slightly oversized. Torqueboards is apparently 1mm more in every direction. I know for sure you will have to file either the truck or the clamp. The good news is it's a fast job because you only have to file the width of the clamp and not the entire length of the truck.

Alrighty, done designing the pulley cover for the 63mm version. Here it is:

I will be selling these as an additional upgrade for $3.99. They will be printed in Black PETG for durability. Wall thickness is 3mm all around. 

There will be 2 sizes to account for different wheel diameters. This is the small size. (for 90mm and below). There will be medium(90mm-100mm) and a large(100mm-110mm).

Another day. Some of the 63mm arms I cut have minor scratches but I am sending them anyways because I think people are tired of waiting.

I am getting new endmills from a friend which should really help things speed along. I do these in 100 part batches. The next time I get my aluminum, I hope to have all 100 mounts done in under a week.

I want to come to a point where I have them already packeged and ready before someone even orders. If that were the case, I could have them from payment to your door in 4 days anywhere in the US.

Can you send a picture of the scratches? Some of the scratches are "built in" the because the barstock they're cut from comes with scratches. It's the way everybody receives them. it's sort of luck whether or not the barstock I receive is very scratched.

I can remedy this by wire wheeling them which I didn't forget the chamfer update. Doing both chamfer and wirewheel takes a lot of time however, so there would have to be a slight price increase.

Also, I'll gladly send another one to make up for the mistake.

Nothing wrong with TB trucks.  You want a tight fit.  Having to file a little bit is better than it being loose AT ALL.

Most of these clamps are designed to fit too tight, and you file a tiny bit to make it perfect.  Cast trucks are never precisely all the same dimensions.

So far so good. Almost 200 clamp pieces have been cut. The 2nd op like chamfer takes more time though.

Also fine tuned my printer so the covers are turning out great, quite strong too. I will update with pictures tomorrow.

As for the new clamps, I will get those under way as well. So far the consensus is that there should be both a surfrodz TPK and a universal circle clamp. I will start producing both very soon!

Hi @Boardnamics I'm not sure if I'm blind or it wasn't stated but may I confirm that the _**idler version**_ would work on both 50mm and 63mm motors? 

So there is no need to buy a separate mount correct?  

And also, is there any other shipping method to Malaysia that's more economical?

I just installed mine on caliber 2s and they appear to be working quite well. I opted for the idler-less version as the idlers on my previous mount created more headaches than they were worth.

Only improvement that I would like to see is threaded holes on the truck clamp for the 'motor plate arm' instead of using nuts to secure it. This is of course an improvement that I could easily make on my own though. 

Overall very impressed for the price. Two thumbs up!

That was a design consideration. I went with a nut because they're cheaper, replaceable, and easier for me to produce. A threaded hole means a tapping operation which is considerably slower than me just drilling 400 holes. A nut costs me 5 cents and is easily replaceable. Only downside is ease of installation.

Trampa infinity/vertigo trucks, for example, have very few 'cheap' mounts and a lot of people like me are looking for options that are affordable so we can place our funds into performance not necessarily over-engineered motor mounts.

Great job btw :+1:

Most likely. I may have to increase the price for some mounts. What trucks specifically? I'm doing Paris and surf rodz tkp real soon :slight_smile:

Just looked them up, those both look doable. Just a rough estimate, I could probably make dual mounts for Trampa Spring trucks and MBS matrix I and II for $100.

Before I begin offroad trucks, I want to finish paris/universal and surf rodz TKP. When this is all set and done, I'll have quite a few designs to pick from!

I am almost done the batch of idler mounts.

There is going to be 2 available surface finishes starting soon. The premium shiny look with chamfered edges, and the totally plain and a little sharp look.

The cheap unfinished version will be $2 cheaper, meaning $13/$18 non idler, idler respectively. This is ultra cheap and the lowest price I can ever offer. If you're on a serious budget and don't care about it looking perfect, this is it!!

The premium version looks super nice and is the best I can make them with my equipment. They will cost $18/$23. So $3 more than they used to. Still a really good value and they add serious bling to your build.

The 15mm belts would probably be for the non idler version, so I was thinking 270mm?
I buy them in somewhat high quantity from my supplier. Their minimum quantity is I believe 50 so I have to purchase only what I know will sell.

Shipping from China is crazy expensive so I only order big sets of belts at a time. When I run out of idler belts, I'll include those in my next order. So quite soon, a few weeks.

Unfortunately that is the cheapest possible. However, the site does calculate it slightly higher because it uses retail prices. The actual cost to ship 2 mounts anywhere besides US is around $24. Not a big difference but....yeah.

Alrighty little update. Finished the arm pieces, now moving on to the clamps. The finishing process takes the longest time. The actual part time to cut these out is 6 minutes combined, vs around 8-10 minutes of finishing operations per mount.

![Clamps|281x500](upload://o2PiXBLO6qzNffmYPiYkLzgDv4S.jpeg) 

I am gettting Surf Rodz TKP trucks this coming week so I should have the design done for that real quick.

My next big batch of mounts will probably be 500 count vs the traditonal 100 I have been doing. It would take me roughly a month to make 500 mounts but it could mean I could ship same day as order placed.
My biggest flaw right now is delivery speed.

Well this didn't take long. @Skunk sent me Surfrodz TKP and RKP trucks. Good news is that TKP is super easy because of the uniform hanger. Unfortunately, RKP hanger is much bigger and therefore the arm plate I make with the 24mm hole does not fit at all on the hanger anywhere.

I might be able to do RKP but it would require a big design change and could not use any of the arm brackets that I make as of now. The price would have to reflect this, with a single mount costing $35. Still not bad considering the trucks alone cost over $100 new.

I have had people talk to me about clearance issues regarding the clamp bolt. I have decided to go with button head cap screws instead of the full socket for the clamp on my next run of 500 mounts.

![BM8BSC_l|500x500](upload://c8CJtJ8dxLMRjHCTW5qwrJqi72Y.jpeg) 
This gains around 3mm of clearance but hey, it's an easy fix at no penalty to strength, reliability, or cost so woohoo!

Also, clamp pieces will never be faced, only chamfered because they become too thin. Facing operation takes off about .3mm of width. Also, it makes almost no sense antithetically seeing as its mostly covered up.

Edit: It appears making the idler bolt button head is also a good idea?

Yes, you can make idlers from a M6 shoulder bolt + bearings, just get a longer M6 sholder bolt and it should work if you secure it down. I made my own idlers for janux mounts and they're solid, I didn't even use a shoulder bolt, i used a regular old M6 bolt, then i wrapped masking tape around the end of it to make it flat and put the bearings on there. Works like a charm, is longer and solid.

Edit: watch out though, large enough wheels will have clearance issues

That metal bit is tape yes, its solid as a rock and slightly larger than it needs to be. The bearings aren't even in solid contact with it and there is no movement. Its laminated masking tape so it should be highly water resistant, and the absolute worst that could happen would be bearing movement then failure which leads to belt skipping which happened with the old idlers anyway

Hi @Boardnamics,

Does your shipping method still includes tracking ? I read it is in an older post on this thread (around #213) but I paid a week ago and still haven't got any tracking information. Is it too early ?

I will be buying 15mm wide belts on my next order from my supplier. They will be 270mm long and intended for the non-idler version of the mount. It covers basically all the common ratios like 36/13 to 40/16. They will be an additional accessory available for $4

Slightly bad news. Got a quote from one anodizing place and for type II anodizing it would be about $6 per mount which is more than I wanted it to be by quite a big margin. This was for 250pcs to be anodized. :( I'll see if I can find anything cheaper but I doubt it

Mine arrived a month after i canceled my order. 
It works well, however,
 the bolts to hold the motor were too short for me to use. 
Not a big deal since most motor mount kits don't provide 
bolts.
I found it to be the easiest motor mount to align and tighten onto 
the truck.
I've tried five different motor mounts. including two models from psychotiller, 
one from torqueboards, and the boardnamics is my favorite..

I am not worried about the screws man, 
I have plenty of screws. I tend to use the 8mm thread screws myself,
that way I can attach the motor to the mount loosely so it slides,
and I can set my belt. 
Like I said, most kits don't even provide those screws. 

I have been using it for about a week and it has not moved, 
or vibrated loose, or caused me any problems at all. 

Boardnamics is my current favorite motor mount.

could you make a large truck hangar shaped rail that can hold a bunch of mounts and then you could cnc the holes into them? I imagine it would be much easier to do a few hundred at a time and have flawless holes on each.

## \#357 Posted by: Boardnamics Posted at: 2019-02-26T03:51:07.651Z Reads: 199

I've had thoughts on using the CNC to do the holes, but it's hard to make sure each clamp is in it's perfect spot. Every fixture I make has a tolerance, and even the parts themselves come out sliiightly different. If I were to CNC multiple clamp holes at once, the inaccuracy in their positions add up significantly. It's very easy for me to chamfer one part at a time vs 50 for the same reason. Besides, I can drill quite fast on the drill press, it just gets tedious after 500 or so.

In planning on buying a manual mill which will make the holes even easier, and help me surface my parts more accurately. The plan is to make bearing pulleys for kegel and flywheel next

Also make sure the inside of the pulley fits easily-obtainable bearings, so a standard size like 22mm or 26mm

@Skunk what clearance do the Surfrodz hangers need?

Caliber 2 need about 23mm but clearance for 22mm is ***easily*** obtained by slightly filing the corners of the truck hanger

You weren't asking me but surfrodz TKP is a 19.1mm hex which means that you would need just about 22mm of clearance, 22.055mm.

RKP is tough cause the hanger isn't the same cross section, but definitely more, like 26mm

And the lag of communication is a no go. If he has time to write here in the thread he should have time for a second to write me back on my message and give me the information about the status. Do I have to wait a few weeks more because he miscalculated or what is going on.

But he did tell me that he can send i out without the finishing if I am ok with it :+1:

He dropped it to USPS and it only gets scanned in by USPS about 3 days after he dropped it there, and then it took approximately 10 days for it to be delivered to me...

So all in all, I had good experience dealing with him, maybe he is just busy and missed out some of the messages he got from his customers :thinking:

@boardnamics. Looks like someone already left negative feedback on your ebay account.  I sent you a message on ebay, 2 weeks and still no mounts. I need you to cancel my order.  I'm going with dickho's mounts.  I'm filing chargebacks with paypal and my credit card if you don't.

Not trying to be a dick, but you really should stop saying shit, despite you knowing him IRL - it's not your business. This is coming from somebody who also ran a decently sized niche-hobby oriented online business while in highschool.

Anyways, @boardnamics doesn't seem to have burned anybody on the forum in any real way. The only issue I've really seen is a small lack of communication in some cases. For somebody who's gotten a ton of praise for the very cheap and robust product he's brought to the community, you could try to be a bit less of an asshole in announcing the fact you're in need of a refund. 

Honestly, I was kinda surprised when I found out a highschool student was leading this solo project. It's not very intense by any means, but still. I'm just fuckin jelly that he has an environment in which he's able to run a milling operation. My business got thrown away after my parents got pissed I was making more money than them.

It started up from absolutely nothing, except maybe a cordless drill and screw driver. Even now I don't have a very elaborate setup, just one that I know how to use quite well and to its full potential. My mom hates this "business", so you're not alone there. Mainly because I keep spending what I make back into the company itself.

I didn't know which order @maxchilton was, as I sell on 3 different platforms. What I really need is a way of bringing them all together because right now it is a nightmare to piece it all together. That, and to finish the 500 mounts. I have a few left that I am distributing carefully.

I am all out of belts rn but ordered more a lot more a few days ago, so that could be it. Here's a pic of all the completely finished mounts I have on me

I've been running my machine around 6 hours a day trying to finish these 500 as fast as I can. I calculated the total time it will take to have these all done which is around 110 hours. So 2 weeks of hard work will set me up for months to come so that way there's no more waiting. Just pack and ship.

It's tough. The belts are all I'm waiting on. Most people don't care because they don't use what I include. For that reason, I'll be selling them separately from now on. Makes more sense

Also, depends what you mean by ready. I try to make them look perfect. If we're just talking about working mounts, I already have a few hundred done. When they're hot off the press, they're sharp and could cut you so I never send them like that. Don't need a lawsuit

I agree that it's wrong to say in stock when they're being made. I'm taking all my listings off for now and will be back in 2 weeks with the finished batch. It will be smooth sailing from then on out. So yeah I'm on "break" and by break I mean grind 6 hours a day :slight_smile:

All the hardware has been bagged. That sure was fun! :slight_smile:
My supplier told me the belts will arrive within a weeks time. I will be selling the belts separately for $3.99. This includes belts for the idler(12mm wide 320mm and 325mm) and non idler (15mm wide 270mm)

There may be a slight change in plans. I now have reasonable numbers for a black anodize, so looks like I will be anodizing a select number of mounts, or maybe all of them? I need some opinions on this ASAP. 
Anodize type will be a hard coat type III, the good kind that will really help longevity.

Correct. Circular clamp with a diameter of 19mm. Clamps may require modification, not entirely sure. I just made a simple and cheap round clamo because it can probably be modded to fit all kinds of trucks. That's why I'm not anodizing them; time keep cost low and make potential mods easier.

The only thing I dont like about the press fit is that unless you have surfrodz or the e-cal you have to modify your trucks and then if it is like the bkb you dont have to modify the trucks but the bearings sits in in the wheel slightly so if you use zealous bearings you are kind of screwed. Also generally 8mm which are good for the ecals or any other trucks but there needs to be a 10mm for the surfrodz which I know you can change them out but without an arbor press they are a bitch to press in.

This is one of many reasons I do not like nor recommend bearings with built-in spacers.  Like Zealous.

Those are good for exactly one thing, and this is a DIY forum, we like to make new stuff, and those bearings are the "Apple" of the DIY world.  You can't do anything except the one thing they were designed to do from the factory.

Boosted Board is more like apple and Bearings with spacers built in are like trying to use a women shoe on a men. For what its made for its great, but for what we use it for its not always going to work.

You got me thinking now. I will try this again w a different width size bearing on the inner end of the pulley like what it came w but 10mm size hole instead of 8mm.

@Boardnamics, are you going to start any models with holes for crossbars? I want to grab a set of the mounts, but I just can't feel safe putting two Maytech 170KV 6374's on something without crossbars and an underside bash mount. I do have access to the equipment to make the needed modifications myself, but I don't really know if there's space on the mount to properly do so. (Haven't looked over a diagram yet)

It is like my normal clamps but on steroids. 12.5mm thick, M8 hardware instead of M6. Debating if this is neccessary. I assumed hey, bigger truck and wheels, bigger mount!. Assuming I do go through with this level of heft, there is NO way anyone can break this thing :smiley:

Really great design because with a bolt and nut it will be easier to check if the mount is loose and also prevent stripping the aluminium treads of some other model  l already seeing. No problem with this clamp for sure for  8 inch tire you still have plenty of clearance!
I hope you can made for the ats12 trucks and trampa aswell.

So you want the clamping axis to be parallel to the ground. Hmm...I would have to redo the cross section and it is a really weird shape. Ill see. The champ looks bigger than it really is. Most gear drives are much bigger and the trucks will most likely have big pneumatic wheels.

I'll machine it soon to get a picture of how big it actually is.

Thinking about it a bit more, as celica39 said, for a large wheel, clearance is not a problem, but I find myself smashing bolts with a 90mm wheel and dickyho mounts. Of course, a solid clamping setup is paramount, even if it does get scratched, and a "weird shape" may not clamp properly...  Really just thinking out loud... So far, it seems like people who abuse their mounts seem to really like yours, so... carry on!

@barajabali  Welp I just checked the CAD and well...I messed up :neutral_face:
So the bar works for the 63mm and 50mm but for the idler there is 1mm too little space to run any diameter of crossbar when running a 63mm motor.

The solution for this is to remove the last bit where the hole is.

@Boardnamics.  I have to say I love your amounts.  I have 2 boards and I switched all my boards to your mounts.    

I have a question for you.  I noted that  you use the halves style motor mounts.  I guess the advantage of this kind of mount is it is easier to mount it the the truck and it provide a secure connection to the hanger.   But I notice a little problem with halves style mount, which is the bottom bolt sits too low and it often hits objects on the ground.   I remember you used to use "G" shape mounts.  Why did you change the design?  Would you make "G" style mounts again?  ![Screenshot_20190418_021538|233x500](upload://wau5i4F7Ki6Jn3pI5bFIVLecSXt.jpeg)

2 Piece clamps harder and is easier to modify for slight irregularities (such as TB218). The instructions show how the bolts should be orientated. The point you labeled lowest should be pointing at the board, not the ground.

What Janux does is the idler is machined out of aluminum and rides on a bearing; it's machined in such a way such that the bolt head is completely recessed into the idler. What I don't like about it is that there's no bearing between the idler and the mount, though.

I envisioned a good idler as, similar to how Janux did it, but also is recessed on the other side to ride up on a second bearing that sits between it and the motor mount.

@M.Hboards I was asked if I wanted those from the people where I get them from. It is all possible but the cost would go up. I will see how much difference we're talking. If the fasteners only cost 50% more then I am totally doing it.

@apolo Unfortunetely those will not be a thing for a while :( Reason for me not doing it is because I think of my paris mounts to be the universal style. Non-anodized is easier to file.

@craj1031tx Likely not because the modification is so easy and making extra designs of clamps sorta screws with my system. I am really debating this though, maybe on the next batch when the 500 I have run out.

I filed these caliber mounts to fit a set of TB218's (i could never file down those beautiful trucks). Took about 15min per side with a half-round file.  Coating makes it a bit harder and you'll want to take care that you keep the file square. Take most of the material from the top if the "arch" to keep the holes for the motor plate aligned.

I was wondering if this would work with the DIYEBoards kit to replace their shitty motor mounts? I have an extra caliber II truck laying around and want to put these on it. 
The kit has 5055 Motors, a 13mm pulley and a 12mm 250-5m belt.

Sounds like it would work. I am running low on 50mm motor plates however, but have plenty of idler ones that fit that. I also have the belts for that

i got around to printing the motor mount covers and they look fantastic. very well designed to fit with really any board style

I did modify the file to cover the belts and a 36t pulley completely and it works great.
i figured i would share the file in case anyone wanted it. they fit 95mm wheels safely and can use up to a 36t pulley

Making precision machined caliber II hangers. 3D printed prototype fits perfect! The hanger length is 220mm and will have shoulder bolts for axles. 

Good upgrade for those that have caliber II trucks and are too broke to buy surfrodz. Now you can run dual 6374 and run bearing pulleys :smiley: 
Estimated price is $40 a hanger, $75 a set. 

![1558912946233182127035|281x499](upload://oSVjKUiop7I3G6j1nihEdAtVHLI.jpeg)

In addition, I have ordered some motor pulleys I will be selling for $8 each.
They're aluminum 7075, 3mm keyway, no shoulder, 2 M5 set screws, 8mm bore. Comes in 13t, 15t, and 18t

By 8mm shoulder bolts, do you mean m6 bolts with an 8mm shoulder? If that's the case, will there be a strength issue considering the m6 portion?

## \#758 Posted by: Boardnamics Posted at: 2019-06-10T02:39:28.418Z Reads: 124

Yeah the 8mm shoulder bolts are M6. The axle goes into an 43mm hole, 13mm of it being tapped M6. So 30mm of the bolt is in aluminum.

The threads will be under little to no shear loads.

These look awesome. What‚Äôs the reason for 43mm? Is it just matching say what surf rods bolt insert length was? Rather than say 53? 63? Shoulder bolts come in a range of lengths... would longer bolt length in the hanger be of a strength benefit?
```

---
## \#766 Posted by: Boardnamics Posted at: 2019-06-10T08:23:30.445Z Reads: 122

```
@Rosco
The overall hole depth is 43mm, but the last 13mm are tapped M6 for the shoulder bolt. So the 8mm part of the bolt can sink in as much as 30mm. 

Shorter shoulder bolts are cheaper but I didn't want to cheap out because the strength will go down the closer I run the axle thread to the end of the hanger.
```

30mm felt like a good balance. Any further and my software indicated little to no strength gains.

Surfordz looks around 30mm. Remember the threads don't count![surf-rodz8|666x500](upload://oBkYtyNpbHc5Oflc7IEND3tpuPu.jpg)

I'm sure @Skunk understands if they arent polished and isnt expecting production quality, the price reflects that. But, theres a difference between a DAMAGED product and a product that isnt polished..

If it was a mistake where you didn't know it was damaged before shipping, fine. The problem lies in knowing it was damaged and still shipping it out, in hopes you dont get called out on it.. that's mighty dishonest if you ask me..

Do you want those mounts, free and free shipping, how does that sound because the damaged part of the mount was definitely my fault. That mount wasn‚Äôt supposed to be shipped out anyways, don‚Äôt know how I put it in the good mount rack

That would be @KaramQ being a questionable employee

Also, i'm with @Skunk on this. If @KaramQ is your employee, you are responsible for his actions relating to this business. The quoted statement made it seem like you were pushing the blame to @KaramQ, which shouldn't be the case. I have nothing against you guys, but I hope you can see why @Skunk is pissed. I would be to, if I were in his shoes.

Maybe. I have to judge if its really worth it. Running a startup in California is not easy whatsoever. It also poses as a huge distraction from my studies which have always been lacking

    ![IMG_20190619_200023528|281x500](upload://wg2XImjXdn3woVF8k25l7rt1JkL.jpeg)

These things are burly as hell. Every component has been up scaled from the original Caliber II design. No shot at breaking these, especially with crossbars

They never have been in actual shipping prices, if they were on his site, he was taking a loss.

I can however tell you that his flat rate priority is a bit higher than it should be if he were using Paypals shipping rates. 

Either way, in my experiences - 

First Class: Cali --> Ohio 3 days
Priority: Cali --> Ohio 2 days

I just mailed 3kg from Ohio to Cali w/priority mail, box ~8x7x4, for $13 something.

Transparency in business practices is important. 

I literally took more than half of a dudes business a few years back just because he was trying to make more profit than he already was (which was a LOT) by jacking up shipping prices. I'm glad tho, worked out for me.

Hey @boardnamics just ordered one of your stealth idler caliber 2 mounts for my 6374 Maytech 190kv.
Was just wondering what gears and pulleys I will need if you can recommend some that will be perfect. 
Im running the Orangatang Caguama 85mm (same as kegels i think) 
Please help me out I cant find the info anywhere.  
Also how long is shipping to New Zealand?

Hi,
Sorry I am not active on this forum ever since the new one was made. Most people run 36/16 ratios or something of that sort, especially with a wheel on the smaller side like yours.

A 320mm belt will work with a setup like that. 315mm would also work.

Shipping to NZ is around 1 week.

Thanks
```
