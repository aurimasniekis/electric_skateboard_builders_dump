@torqueboards Quick question. I am really interested in those wheels coming on Cyber Monday but i also wanna buy the stuff you guys listed in this post. Will these deals only be available on Black Friday or can i wait till monday. I live in the Netherlands so shipping is a pain in the a$$. I don`t really how this black friday and cyber monday thing works so thats why I ask. Really pumped for the new wheels hahah but paying for double shipping would be a waste.

@epster unfortunately the pre-order items will ship out later so you would have to purchase the pre-order items separately with a separate shipping charge. They are just discounted.

Ah oke thats no problem at all. Thanks for the heads up. ****Scrambling some money for the shipping of the wheels**. I assume that the pre-order time is limited to Cyber Monday right? And the black friday order time is limited to just black friday or is it like last year untill sunday?

If you‚Äôve got left over stock that no body buys hit me up I‚Äôll take it off you hands lol we can‚Äôt have it taking up space for those new direct drives.

Also are you changing decks because these would not accomodate the new 110mm wheels?

Haha when I saw the üî• symbol, I was like, uh oh, not another board... but no, it‚Äôs just a fire sale. Still... don‚Äôt know if putting üî• symbols in an electric skateboard ad is the best thing lol.

@pat.speed Haha nah personally I just didn't like the platform. I want a more universal setup with swappable packs. CF Decks didn't solve that for me. We moved to a bigger warehouse so we have too much space for now lol.

@evoheyax @Mich21050 haha "why you guys gotta be so negative" lol

Price for the wheels will stay before the pre-order ends once the first batch is due for delivery. So you guys have some time for the TB110s.

They need a name , a formal name , if they‚Äôre going to be all black why not some like the Cocoas or Starlings
