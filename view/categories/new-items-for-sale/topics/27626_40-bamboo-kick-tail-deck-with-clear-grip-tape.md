This deck is brand new and never been used, i had to sell all my eSkate gear and this is all that is left. I originally bought the board for $100 including tax but i'm only selling for $80 CAD ($65 USD) and free shipping. The board has a maple core so it's perfect for and electric skateboard.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/0/f0440eb62c108f1c012e034bb13059ea22932647.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/c/4cd67df51426fcf198f6d3084963b8283056fbf7.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/e/7e07c1d2ed9e01af607b7e59f51b6760567ab49a.jpg" width="666" height="500">
