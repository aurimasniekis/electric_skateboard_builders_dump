IÂ´m creating this thread only to see if there would be any intress in buying CNCÂ´d aluminium hubs for skateboard trucks. So far I only got one set done for my personal build. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/6/36ab28ca9c317487209236d3fd59f49d25dc21fc.jpg" width="375" height="500">

They are based on my 3d printed hubs for trampa tires. And could be lathe/milled for 6-9" tires or whatever size you want.
I could also provide 3d printed pulleys or aluminium pulleys any size you want..

IÂ´m not pricing them yet but could give an estimated price range. For a set of 4 alu hubs would be somewhere between 150-200â‚¬ + shipping. (not included pulleys, bearings and tires.) 

Additional info : 
T6 6082 aluminium
6" hubs one piece = ~350g without tires and bearings. Going to try to get them a bit lighter..
For the 6" the 6 m5 screw holes would be visible. 7" and up they would not be visible. Just like my 3d printed hubs.
Shipped from EU

HereÂ´s some pics. 
(note that the 6 m5 screws are missing because I dindÂ´t find a m5*0.8 tapp)

Yes I know that. And they are sick. I printed those hubs over 2 years ago and planed to make them into aluminium since then. Just got around to do it. Hoping you won't mind me touching the market with a second option of hubs?

Nice job @L3chef
Will they fit the 6inch wheels me and @psychotiller are using? It would be great to have an aluminium option for EU people.

The only thing I am a little concerned about is the unsymmetrical recess of the bearing. Seems like the inside is flush while the outside bearing is recessed quite a bit - that means the weight is not distributed equally between the bearings.

Yeah I know - probably not that much though. Also wouldn't it be easier to manufacture if you have identical halves so that you can produce the same part in double the number?

I'm answering you in a rush now. Get back with mor details later. The bearings are symmetrical. Lathed in one set. The other half of the hub is a "cap"..
This worked very well with my 3d printed hubs.

Not really. Since they are lathed it only takes 2 sec to change offset/work shift

Well, once you factor in the unknown price of intl. shipping, tires, pulleys & bearings, it will probably end up costing you at least one European kidney, which is like 1.3 American kidneys, you know, with the current organ exchange rate and all.

Other than that, the hubs look sick and could be a good option for the Euro peeps for sure. I'd be surprised to see if the total package price with shipping and currency conversion four the US comes in at less than @psychotiller's six shooters.

[/quote]

I would be too.  A set of @psychotiller 6 shooters is $300 and comes with tires and tubes and pulleys, it's a complete solution. 

Not saying there shouldn't be others, i love innovation.  I don't see these being much cheaper with everything included

aw damn sorry, didnâ€™t realize these ones were just hubs ha.

you mind lowering my price back down to 1 kidney?
as @Mobutusan said, these would cost about 1.3 american kidneys. Nobody wants to buy .3 of a kidney so iâ€™d end up loosing 2 anyways.

Yeah, it's good to see another quality hub option. They kind of remind me of a curvier European version of the Six Shooters which look more like deep dish American muscle car wheels, which both look great.

You are all right. theese wouldn't be cheaper than @psychotiller Â´s hubs. Just another option that would maybe suit europe peeps better because of the whole currency and import feeÂ´s cost.
300 usd for a complete set is not that expensive at all as many of you think. Only way to get them any cheaper is to buy a cnc lathe for yourself and start mass producing.
