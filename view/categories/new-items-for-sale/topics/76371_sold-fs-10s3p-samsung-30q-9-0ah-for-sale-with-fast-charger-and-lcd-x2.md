Well here are some stats:

I rode 12 miles today and only used 160wh which took 42% of the battery.  So i should get 20+ miles on the battery pack. I cant complain, was hella nice out and a great ride!

6354 motor single
16/36 gearing
83mm wheels

Come with special TSA approved extra stickers for your sticker book collection.

It will fail, 99wh max. 50% chance you can get it through though due to TSA negligence.

That feel when the TSA is better at catching skateboard batteries than legit guns

TSA literally asked me "why are you carrying that and not riding. They used to ride the hoverboards in the airport, we dont care"

Didnt even look at battery either
Battery was removed in my bag and they never checked

I went through TSA in Boise and SanDiego.  My board was on my back, my battery was in my backpack.  I took my skateboard off and let it go trough the detector, i took my laptop out of my backpack, yet my battery stayed in bag.

Both TSA locations asked about my board and said it was really cool.  They did NOT touch my backpack nor ask about the 10s3p pack that was in it.

No heat but that doesn't really mean anything. The battery itself is too big for airline + FAA regulations, TSA just didn't know/care.

For reference: https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ash/ash_programs/hazmat/passenger_info/media/Airline_passengers_and_batteries.pdf
