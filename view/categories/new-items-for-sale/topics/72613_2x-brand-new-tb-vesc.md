Hi, i got two brand new torqueboards VESC's for sale, i bought them directly from diyelectricskateboards about one month ago and i never used them. 

The reason they never got used is because i changed my mind and bought focboxes for my build instead.

I'm located in Sweden. I want 140 EUR for both or 75 EUR for a single vesc + shipping.

Thx for tagging. But I think no. I need some more power and FOC on my emtb.
With those I would be too much limited.

That is what i've also heard and that's why i decided to go with focboxes instead. However i hope theese ESC's will work good for normal builds :)

absolutely. for any build that uses 40a or less for each vesc, I would reccomend these over others simply bc theyre cheaper

If noone is interested in buying them maybe i could use these to upgrade my wowgo 2s, it should make some difference in it's performance. idk maybe it has to weak motors

I dont mean to say you cant sell them here, someone will pick them up eventually :) 

for the wowgo it was probably a combination of everything :laughing:

the esc only does 20a, the battery 40a, motors take 10a each.... its a decent beginner board

It might have better acceleration and breaking but range might get worst. Due to 10s2p battery

Yeah i'd rather sell them. The wowgo is a good commuting board as it is. When i wanna have some fun i got the Trampa. Its unlikely that a vesc upgrade to the wowgo would make me wanna ride it instead of the trampa anyways ðŸ¤£
