Hello builders:

I'm going to be offering some nice deals for Black Friday, this is the only time of the year I make discounts on the products of my shop so hope you could jump in and support this fellow server of yours so I can continue developing new enclosures for the community.

Here is the deal, coupons will be valid only for 3 days, from Black Friday Night until Cyber monday midnight (30/11 - 02/11), after that the prices will return back to normal.

**givemebackmy20bucks** US$ 20 off the purchase of on any enclosure 
**giveme20percentoff** 20% off the purchase if you order 2 enclosures or more
**50bucksoffbattery** US$ 50 coupons on all battery packs
**givemebackmy50bucks** US$ 50 coupon on combos (decks + enclosure + bolt kit + rubber gasket) 

Combos will be delivered at the end of December
Battery packs and enclosures will start to ship in January (first ordered first delivered)
