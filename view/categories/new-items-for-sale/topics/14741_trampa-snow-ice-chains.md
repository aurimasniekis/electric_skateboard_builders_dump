Hey guys, so you've all been asking me for info on my snow chains.  I wanted to get some real world snow testing before I started selling them. My results speak for them selves. I used to never ride my Trama out in the snow/ice because i would always find my self on my ass and a sore tailbone for the rest of the week.  These chains are second generation and they work perfect.  This is not a beta release or a test. These chains are proven and work perfectly in ice and snow.

There is a slight lead time hopefully 2 weeks.

You get (4) chains for 8" tires. 
They come with a mesh bag for easy drying. 
Price is $250 plus shipping. 
Or 
you can buy just (2) for $150 plus shipping

I think he will lower the price at some later time :D this was just a little show off, for anyone who wants chains, just to grab them! Im sure he makes them in limited quantities.. (and perhaps dont have a stock at the same moment of purchase.. ) - 

So the price was kind of okay.. for those who really wanted at that time..

I suggest you make them yourself and then let me know how it goes. @solarcross @mountainboardlover69 this isn't a toy, making chains that can withstand your body weight is more challenging.
