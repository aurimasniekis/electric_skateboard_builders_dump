Just made some samples of 14T  15T  16T 18T  steel pulley with keyway(4mm wide).   
as I checked, the 16T and 18T are OK,  
but the 14T and 15T, because they are thin, after made keyway, there's not much space left for the set screw.   So, I decide to sell 14T,15T steel pulley without keyway later.
