What happens if for some reason I need the support bars to be longer or shorter?

## \#11 Posted by: marcmt88 Posted at: 2018-05-25T04:20:10.156Z Reads: 246

```
For shorter length you would need to cut them down.  If longer cross-bars are needed, you would need to order a new set from me or make one yourself.

Are you planning to make different clamps for other mountain board trucks? Like Matrix II or old Matrix with brake mount protrusion for example? And what's it cost to ship within cali?

Does it work with 20mm wide belts? Or just 15mm?

You would have to source out your own 20mm belts and pulleys.  I only carry 15mm belts and motor pulleys.

Idlers can be customized to fit 20mm if need be.

## \#19 Posted by: egzplicit Posted at: 2018-05-25T13:36:22.860Z Reads: 214

Thatâ€™s great. The crossbars would need adjusting as well because I think the mounts would need to sit closer together to allow alignment on 20mm belts.

Great design btw.

No adapters are engineered to fit specific trucks, no need to mill or file hanger.

Never mind, I was debating between your product and someone elses and went with other choice. Your motor mounts are reeeely cool loking, unfortunately I'm already over budget :frowning:

do the springs in the trucks provide any vibration dampening or are they just for turning?

the Janux dual Motor mount would work for MBS Matrix truck ( its the original MBS Comp95 truck) there is no pro or II written on the truck.
I wanna run chain, 14 T motor 72 T wheel. It seems center to center around between 4- 5 inch ( 10 to 12 cm) . would the mount work?

Pro version has the springs as shock absorbers, Pro II is lighter with Eggshock dampers.  I designed these mounts to be belt driven.  Can't confirm whether chain setup would work.

My matrix truck should work with the matrix  Pro mount, I also can modify .
Could you do me a favour before I place my order on the Janux webpage - could you measure for me the distance from motor mount center to truck axle center ?
I checked the Janux page but couldn't find any details, thanks a lot
