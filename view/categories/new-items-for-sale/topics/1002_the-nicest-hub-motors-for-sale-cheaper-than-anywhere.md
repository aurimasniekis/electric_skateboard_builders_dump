Comes with rubber.  Help me get this going and get these for what will likely be the cost to me.  64.40 to me and then add shipping and paypal and then make the rubber. 
I need about 40 people (80 motors) total to make the bulk order. 

These are the nicest component hub motors (.2mm lamination stator and N45sh curved magnets) that are universally mountable. 

Buy ten please. Sell them or give them away.

Here's my board at the grocery store right now. Brought it up front to check my transmitter is working.  I'm always dropping it 
I'm in San Francisco.  Come over and try these.

Specs? What do you want to know? I don't know the continuous wattage or max. I've hit 45 amps on 12s.  The cheap thin watt meter broke though and I know I can hit any speed of want to go (40?) and almost any hill around.  N45sh curved magnets hair thin airgap and .2mm stator laminations. 100kv. 
I like them a lot with the vesc on <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/3/3e9e687c5debd3381cbee1e389af9c4ae150b16e.jpeg" width="666" height="500">foc

im not a pro with them, but i have made a pair before that didnt last very long so i can answer lol @NNGG 

They fit on all standard trucks right on the truck shaft like your wheel.
the inner wheel is replaced by the motor stator.
Theyre pretty simple if you have the right tools which are a mill or lathe. 

the problem with mine was that I didnt have a lathe so I couldnt modify the can of the motor for more beefy bearings.

These are made by a motor manufacturer in China. One bearing has over double the load bearing of a regular skate bearing and the other bearing is also stronger than a skate bearing.  
The rubber now is 89 duro and I'll be trying an 80 duro next week. 
These mount on a regular skate truck and are glued on.  Glue is strong these days. 
I did a lot of braking in the video. It's almost all ether up hill or down.  There is one very steep downhill almost at the end of the video.  The vesc on foc.  There is more power using the bldc program.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/6e3681f9f2717898118c3d044b4448d73e8ea61d.jpeg" width="666" height="500">.

Hey guys, if you want to see more design posts/technical specs and discussions check out his endless sphere thread (he linked in in his first post on this thread).

The ES post is over 10 pages, and has everything from the CAD pics to testing videos and updates.

Not to mention $200 for two motors is significantly less than buying two normal motors + pulley/mounting kits- and this all wasn't achieved by cutting corners... he's selling the first batch at cost (64.99+ rubber +shipping so roughly 100USD per motor).

These are literally R-SPEC quality, except they cost less, and don't require any additional mounting setups! You can kiss risers good by with these bad boys.

I know I'm vouching hard for this guy, but this project is over a year in the making, and he deserves to get 40 buyers for his initial run. And yes, before you ask I am one of them :wink:

There's a video above of me doing hills in San Francisco. 
I don't know if I'd cal them R-spec quality as I don't know and can't find any ingredients in those motors. A claim to a certain wattage is misleading as it depends on the airflow and ability to dissipate heat.  There are no material details I can find for those motors. I strongly doubt you will find a motor ANYWHERE in the hobby world, that uses .2mm laminations and N45sh curved magnets and a .4mm airgap

I go up shit like that on my 149kv single drive. 12T to 36T, 12S. At one point I had a 20T to 36T and I still got up the hill. Both configs require a 15mm belt though. Cant speak for hub motors as those are still on the todo list

```
So the gear setup i got from @torqueboards was for 15mm, he just didnt include the proper parts to set it up as a 15mm belt setup. I did just get some parts from alien drive system that are 15mm wide parts. Also I have been talking to enertion about getting some wider setups in stock. 

Make no mistake you will get up those hills with your setup, bumping it up to 12S would make a noticeable difference for keeping speed going up that hill. But a single drive rolling up/down that level of incline is going to get torn up pretty quick. 12t to 36t is going to be the smallest number of active teeth you can roll with that will still work, but it will be rough on stuff. Youll see some good amount of belt slipage. You having a 16t to 36t should be that perfect sweet spot that it will be enough teeth in contact to not slip the belt, but not so many teeth in contact that the belt is getting too much torque put down on it, causing it to snap. (had that happen on the way to the ladies house)

16T motor to 36t wheel on 83mm wheel with a 32v battery powering that 149kv motor will get you that 21mph sweet spot. So your gears are looking dope. You are going to hit the road with that motor and be shocked at how much power you have. when that happens, feel free to message back lololol



EDIT: should include that I didnt ask @torqueboards for 15mm parts, so him sending 9mm parts was expected, just dont know how to throw that in there now that everything is typed out. only mentioning his 15mm so that yall can give him your business for said parts if you so decide lol

https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=68217&p=1141174#p1141174

There's a lot of info 

Thanks you guys for doing this with me.  It's about time something like this was done.  Not that these are the first hubmotors but we went all out on the design and components.  This isn't an extruded metal cylinder  but a lathed bell with fat bearings...(talking to orangatang wheel's manufacturer and see what the price on 500 is) and they're cheap

@NNGG 
 They screw onto the axle where you would normally put standard wheels. 

Depending on your trucks (specifically the length of the axle and it's threads) you might have to do some slight modifications. I believe the cases where modification is needed have to do with the threads on the axle being too short, or just the axle being too short in general- some hanger axles stick out more than others... 

Sorry @Hummie if I'm stealing your replies; just trying to help ya out and get more people on board :wink:

@Hummie used paris trucks, so I am assuming you wouldn't need any mods. That said, if you did have to do any mods, it would just be adding threads to the axle.

the motors will kick out the data center between the wheels on the hanger by 17mm.  Arsenal cast trucks come in 165 and 180 and Paris in 180 and 195 while almost all the other trucks come in 180 and 160. I use the Paris 

I've a set of caliber, Arsenal cast, and the Paris.  The motors fit fine on the Arsenal and I believe the Paris they were fine too, but the Paris had threads that were a bit shorter and needed to be cut with a handheld die. 

For me the biggest question is how to get the trucks to stick on the axle as they're either going to unscrew accelerating or braking depending on which side they are on.   I forget the numbers now but loctite's torque resistance in foot pounds exceeds the torque that these motors can theoretically put out. I did some tests and got roughly 35 foot pounds necessary to turn the same size threading and bolt with red loctite's applied.   (When it does give it doesn't come free really but kinda oozes slowly). The motors might do 16...I forget the formula and need to look it up as someone broke it down based on kv and max power and other things.  Or there's probably a true number of foot pounds these motors are producing I could figure out based on my weight and acceleration speed.  Maybe. So that sounds fine and the glue holds and that's just with red loctite's on the threads but, and I've been discouraged from this worry by others who are engineers, I was worried about the constant vibrations or stresses on the aluminum threading and thought it might break behind the glue.  Aluminum stress cycles leading to cracks. But it's a small space the axle has to move and the threads are deep I'm told and Marc is planning to set up his motors with just the loctite.   I do feel comforted that the glue gives slowly, but I don't like the idea of resting on the threads as he is going to do.  I used j and b weld. But I don't recommend that either as it is too thick to get good surface coverage and avoid any voids, and it is iron filled and not good for vibration and shock and not the best shear strength.  I believe it will be fine but not ideal and a mess to use. There is a better glue that is very thin and double the shear strength used to insert golf club heads into shafts. You know they can't have them flying off. 
I'm torn thinking really the easiest way for everyone whose getting these would be for me to do the glue job as otherwise people will use who knows what, and while that might be interesting to see what holds and doesn't,,,not the safest. 
I'll be having to get more money from people to ship these motors and after seeing what they want to do..hopefully I'll end up buying them all trucks and doing the possible thread cutting and gluing. 
The one downside to the use of such a permenant bond is the big bearing on the inside is trapped. While it's a nice NSK bearing with more than double either dynamic and static load bearing of a typical skate bearing, it might need to be maintained years down the road.  I wont be riding in the rain even when I finally seal up my vescs to protect them as I don't want the bearing in water.  I am thinking when the fat bearing does eventually go dry I can remove the rotors with their rubber, and sink the hanger in a vat of oil and then stick it in my vacuum chamber.  This is the cost for permenantly fixing the motors but it's fine with me.  the other bearing is replaceable and also stronger than a skate bearing in dynamic and static loads.  You guys bought them and I hope you don't feel this is a problem.  If you ever wanted to ship me your hanger I could do it for you free.  Clean it up and spray the windings with more enamel!

You guys bought them and I hope you don't feel this is a problem.  If you ever wanted to ship me your hanger I could do it for you free.  Clean it up and spray the windings with more enamel!

Meant to say the caliber were fine fit wise. The only issue is the thread length. Some are too short. Paris for example. Need a die to cut them further.

Yes I can cut the threads further so the motors will screw all the way on and I can also permanently glue them if you want. The gluing...I recommend doing it permenantly as I say but three engineers I've talked to about it specifically think red loctite is fine.

Or get a 195 hanger and they are very close in wheel diameter. We're talking 1 or 2 mm. With two 180 Paris it's 14mm difference in wheel spacing.  Not a big deal and really not important at all. Why people don't ride differnet widths ...as long as they fit

Some thing I did not take into consideration, I have shit roads in my area and my feet and knees get destroyed on a regular longboard with large soft 97mm wheels.And I have to locktight them anyway, so I am worried that the hub motors will suffer from road abuse and the windings or the copper coils in the motor will suffer as a result. I feel a belt setup allows you to switch motors and keeps the motor safe at the expense of belts and gears. The hub motor will have to be disassembled to repaired. Lastly what if the board goes over a curb and other rough terrian, how will the hub motors handle that?

TL;DR I am already invested in a belt setup that I like, know works well and have invested money into. But I like the idea of cheap hub motors $100 versus $80 for a motor and $120 for a mechanical kit even if the hub motors are more vulnerable.

The one downside to the use of such a permenant bond is the big bearing on the inside is trapped. While it's a nice NSK bearing with more than double either dynamic and static load bearing of a typical skate bearing, it might need to be maintained years down the road.

I would have to recommend a ceramic bearing for this if you could get one.

San Francisco streets can be pretty crappy too.  I've also had one of the motors run over by an suv and its in a video on endless sphere.  

Motor maintenance...there are spaces for screens in the Windows of the motor to keep out debris but I haven't put them in yet.  The windings of a hub motor are probably about as likely to get damaged from rough road vibrations as with an off the side motor mount.   If you're worried about it I've heard of using thermally conductive epoxy. Especially with the low kv motors we use the windings are thinner and have more possibility to vibrate against each other possibly removing enamel and causing a short...although I haven't heard of a case of this specifically happening it makes sense.  The thermal epoxy also helps dissipate heat and you will have a higher power possible. The magnets should be fine as long as the screens are put in these motors. 

The big bearing...either you run use red loctite and later wrench the motor off using a two pin spanner wrench or if it's permanantly fixed on you service it after...awhile. 
I'll look into the ceramic. As it is now and for this coming production it has 2 NSK bearings from Japan and they're really good and much stronger than a skate bearing as I said but if less maintenance is needed with the same ability to take load with ceramic ...and they aren't crazy expensive...maybe go that route next time.

Are you going to protect your motors from any vibrations and shock, because right now that is a big thing that worries me. A satellite config vibrates the motor from a mount that is not in contact with the ground.

Based on my experience driving hub motors now for 6 month and way beyond 1000km I never experienced that to be a problem. 

And a satellite config is also not really protected against shocks more, it's just the thickness of the urethane. I can't see a big difference.

@NNGG 

if your motor is mounted to a skate truck it's going to get road vibrations.

That applies to both hub motors and belt configurations. 

On a belt config, it is true that the motor itself doesn't touch the ground, but it's still connected via a solid mount that doesn't absorb many vibrations. It does have a whole wheel to stop vibrations, but that really doesn't make a huge difference compared to the rubber on a hub motor.

I agree that vibrations are slightly more on a hub motor, but it isn't by a significant enough amount to worry about it.  

No matter what, all of our motors are connected to the ground with little to no protection from vibrations anyways.

The difference is a hub motor is supporting all of your weight. Vibrations and shock only compound that fact.

Satellite motors are completely isolated from that force. They only have to push our fat Asses.

But it's doable - holding the two cylindrical planes permenantly within .5mm of each other, even with extreme vibration and shock.   Pediglide is getting good life out of his motors I think, and he did add different bearings and other changes from the original design, which I think is also still going.  My motors have only seen about 130miles so far.  There are other hub motors out there that are surviving. Jason who runs endless-sphere made some long ago and someone on this site and ES made some with cored kegels. I wonder about the big name companies on Kickstarter..have they produced something that lasts or are they pushing back production while they come up with a solution.  E-go seems an extreme example of a board that is constantly breaking and the seller is constantly sending warranty replacements. 

Had a scare lastnight and felt and heard rubbing as I spun the wheels in my hands! Both!  I've redloctited the ring on and wish I'd used something milder as I can't get it off...but blasted inside with air and it's good.  Was thinking for a long time what could've collapsed. 

This is what I want to make!  Imagine the load on those bearings.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/1/1d6e4064e8b6904611f72dbf37668a8466e078c0.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Pediglide/lever has a thread that's too long to look for a picture of what he makes now.  he's further changed but I thought he was working with a long outrunner that happened to have a skirt/big bearing. 
 You say he's using a 608 bearing, which is a regular skate bearing.  Does he use two of those now or still the original big motor bearing? And a machined bell?  Thought it was the outrunner rotor. I remember he was changing things a lot. 

i agree I think there's more physical stress to a motor in a wheel.  The magnets and glue have shown they can take it, and big bearings surely can, and so can the rubber.  The stator's windings...you can get enamel spray that's intended for just such a purpose of adding a coating.  I really like the idea.  Even more I want to try thermally conductive epoxy.   Some people say it will make things worse but I've heard from people first hand that it works.  Not potting it all but just painting some on they did. I'd like to pot the windings in it though but heard that if you have an air bubble it will make things much worse. This doesn't make sense to me

I think it's good that @Hummie tests them hard until some components fail to make sure we all can avoid this happening to us. It seems that he's desperately looking to get them to their physical limits, and that's great for us.

In the mentioned case adding three little pieces of heat shrink to those wires is a effort of 2 minutes work to avoid shorting them over time, you even do not have to disassemble the motor for this.

I'll probably do the shrink wrap for you.  Thinking of adding thermally conductive epoxy as well which was mentioned here..to hold the windings better and give them another layer of protection
The bearings I changed to sealed instead of shielded. 
And the magnets are going to be stronger with less high heat potential. This is to add a slightly bigger airgap for safety as people are likely to run their bearings into the ground or not maintain bearing seats with retaining fluid.  Also one side of each bearing will be a shrink (press) fit. Tighter tolerances but still accessible without much effort. 
The problem I had was easily avoided.  Now I could be forced to rewind.  From what I read finding if there are internal shorts in the windings isn't as easy as id hoped.  If I'd measures the windings resistance before running the motor that would've been a help.  I'm thinking it should be in the bldc tool for the vesc!
Regardless rewinding might be easier than figuring out if there are shorts and the temp I got it up to probably damaged the enamel on all the wires.  I'll be riding again within a week no problem 
But there are no warranties as said. But don't worry I expect these to last a lot longer than any other hub motors out there by a long stretch and others all have tiny warranty periods anyway.  If you're bold and use red loctitie to mount the motor (I didn't with these but will be next time), you will be able to remove the motor and replace the big bearing in the back and then these should last you a really long time.  I did testing on the holding power of the redloctite and it will hold the motor's torque no problem....if you want to just use the redloctite there is the danger in my mind of having a wheel fall off from the stresses to the aluminum threading in the motor and it breaking. .  There are shear tests of just such threading and they show to be more than strong enough and a couple engineers say the threading is deep and not to worry.  But that's up to you

I tested these motors and they run great on VESC. I'd recommend them for everyone on flat ground. I wouldn't recommend them for hill climbing especially if over 200lbs+. The motors will heat up too fast and you'll burn them out and it will be done.

You'll still need belt and pulley setups for hills 15%+ and/or for heavier riders.

They are pretty sweet though - hub motors that is..

Just FYI so you guys can manage your expectations... I couldn't replace these with my daily route. I'd burn out these motors quick or have to walk up the hills 15%+. I'm about 180lbs.

You can only at speed and you can't do it often.. Any hill under 15% incline should be fine.. You move higher in inline and these motors will get too hot and burn up.

Flat ground will be awesome with these motors but hills are another story...Not everyone has steep hills though.

Just don't expect these to climb 25% inclines and expect them to keep up with a belt driven setup. It just won't happen.

completely agree; It's reassuring to see him shooting up hills and attempting to beat the crap out of the hub motors- it results in a better end product for us.

He could have very easily just posted a couple videos of him strolling around flat ground, taken some pics, and said they were all good. Instead though, he made sure to test them to their end making sure everything is worthy of eboard abuse.

NNGG it depends how long and steep the hill is and what speed you attack it at and how heavy you are. I'm 160 and did fell street from market st to the park: 

http://www.findhills.com/hill?pagetitle=FindHills.com%20-%20United%20States%3A%20San%20Francisco%20California.%202.70%25%20%28max%2011.45%25%29%201.46%20mi.%26distancein=imperial#location=37.776311856964846,-122.41928100585938~37.77417482537318,-122.43893623352051

That's been the steepest longest thing I've done.  It's about 6 blocks of 9 degree. I've done steeper but not continuously.  As Dexter says these are not the best choice if you want to do long steep things and are heavy.   I did it, it got hot.  I went up at maybe 15mph and down the other side.  Brakes are great. I don't know what temp I hit but if you came here and wanted to try long hills much steeper I wouldn't be thrilled.  It has to be me burning the motors not strangers.  If you really want to do stuff as steep as you say I'd get a pulley board.  Or even pediglide/lever's hub motors are much bigger than these and I bet they could do a lot more.  Or ..get four of these and see what happens. 

There are easier less steep ways for me to get around but I do like to fly up and down hills here late at night.  Too afraid to see what speed I can hit on a flat so I do this.k

Talked to China yesterday and finalized everything.  Everything I said above but no press fits all tight slide. 
Black rubber 83 duro
Dark purple motors. 
And I'm potting the stators.
With the stronger magnets and slightly bigger gap they'll be more powerful and efficient And the potting should help too.  Now a 200f max temp before can damage the magnets. 

But it should still be 30 business day manufacturing and not including the long two week Chinese holiday.  
Starting whenever I sent it about 3 weeks ago. Maybe 4 forget. Shipping should be quick 
I'm excited for these too because I haven't been riding ever since I shorted. Will be getting vesc back tomorrow and Chaka said they're fine so it's just the motors and have to rewind both.  
But ..no rewinding for you because I'm potting the stators in thermally conductive resin and adding grommets to the wires. 
I'm wondering how people are going to mount them and worried.  I'm going to use actic silver thermal
Epoxy for the shaft and thermal paste for where it butts the hanger.  I think with the two-pin wrench I had made for the backside I should be able to break the epoxy one day and replace the big bearing<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/f/f088ef4914e4958560c62b4c8f752da4bd230628.png" width="281" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/6fb36a27888504f98902c5a5ad55c2d16f0bad00.png" width="281" height="499">
Here's a pic they sent me.  U can see there's a very thin purple shim. Another part that I wonder what people will do.  If u look at the exploded 3D u can see where it goes. Figuring the distance between the two bearings and the axial load on them and if it's best in or out is up to you.  I have them in and once the retaining fluid goes on they're pretty stuck.  Next time I'll have them off and have all axial load on the big bearing. Or maybe it won't be all...you can imagine the possibilities.  There's probably a way to decide if it equalizes the load on the bearings or makes things unequal but I didn't take the time and im sure it's fine on or off really. We're taking a .1mm shim I think.

Sorry it's taken so long.  The post office turned me away again!  Lots and lots of paperwork for oversea people.  

Tracking is free for domestic shipping, insurance is not.  I'm not insuring any of u unless u specifically ask for it and then reimbure me

Overseas tracking costs an extra 15$ beyond the typical 40$ for this size and weight.  If u didn't give me enough money for insurance or specifically ask for it it's not there.  Some of u gave me extra money and it can go to that.  Some of u have disappeared and haven't given me money for shipping yet!!

I'll be back at the po on Monday.  That will be the day for sure.

I'm finding Omega herbal epoxy number 200 is thinner than the blue stuff and I had an easier time mounting the motors with it.   U can get a small envelop of it from them and even heat it a bit for greater viscosity.  It's still not a pourable resin really...more of a goop job but more doable than the loctite stycast I was using for potting.

Hi been busy all day and now have my board back working with the 80kv version of these and I got all the bearings back in the motors.  That's been the hold up. Snuck up on me.  I hate that I keep
Postponing ..  Tomorrow.  They just need boxes. 
So I'm relieved.  Been in a slump with all these parts around and nothing going.  Tomorrow I'll deliver the last of them by board. Yes!  

The 80kv.  Ran it on the bldc and it was loud and the brakes were doing something bad at full brake.  Within 5 minutes I programmed it to foc.  I'm surprised at how quick it is off the line compared to the 100kv I had  I'm not sure but I might have hit the end of the throttle. Battery was dying maybe too though.

I asked people about wheel colors and then in the end confusion set in and I should've written things down.  If u want another color write me and I'll send them

80.

I'll wake up early tomorrow. 

 Tell me what u guys are mounting them with. Be careful. 
Use slow cure stuff
Heating it will thin it
The thinner the resin the better. 
Try to fill all the voids 

Cracking the motor off later..the holes in the back u can use a 2 pin spanner. But some of the earlier ones I sent the holes are filled with epoxy.  Ull have to drill it a bit.

Next time I mount some I will make a video.  My iPad doesn't record sound so I'll see.  But visually there isn't much to see and what I'm writing can get you far.  I've done it twice, once with j and b weld, which I don't recommend, just because it's a brittle iron filled resin, and once with two different thermal epoxies.   All of them hold and I'm not worried about them but a resin that is thin and can fill as much of the void between the motor and axle as possible will make a good complete surface the forces the wheel is exposed can buffer, so it's not steel on aluminum threads which could maybe damage the threads eventually.  But maybe it's fine with even red loctite and I've been told that it should be by engineers .  But I don't have a sure solution and am figuring it out myself.  Ideally u could half fill the hole in the motor with something super thin and not brittle and then simply screw the hanger's axle down into it.  But I have t found the best glue and have been having to paint the axle as well as a bit inside the motor hole and screw tightly.   I marred up my screw notch on the motor badly when the blue stuff was super thick and I couldn't screw the motor all the way down. That is important.  U don't want any exposed axle and the motor and hanger should touch. My second shot I warmed up some thermal epoxy, the white stuff from Omega, think it was number 100, and it was much thinner and better but not as good as could be found.  I'd forget trying to get something thermally conductive and just try to find something thin.  Do a bit of research or ask someone what would be thin (less viscocity), and not brittle when cured, and a bit of modulous of elasticity(I don't know)...and tell me if u find something good

!!! Also I ran out of shrink wrap and refuse to buy it at the rediculous prices at the hardware store so some of u have none extra, just what they came with and it s far from enough.  Check that there is enough there.  I added two later to what was there for most of the motors.  And I didn't put the screens in to protect from debris, get some at the head shop probably.  !!!

After riding about 50 miles yesterday I can sit on the throttle with the 80kv and will do 26mph with 12s.  Or maybe it's faster and I'll have to find out today exactly what speed.   It has a lot of torque and hills fall in its path.  More torque than I need and moving to the 90kv.

The good news is I don't even try to race boosted guys.  It's no race on any terrain. And I can woop on spandex clad cyclists at a moments notice with even the 80kv.  Peak speed about 26mph. The instant peak power is more so than the last motors it feels and I can accelerate from 5 to 25 quicker. The bad news is this motor gets hotter than the last.   I just raced my friend to the beach and back on his bike through the partially closed golden gate park and crushed him and could stop and chat along the way...but was at 220f at the end .  Probably the longest sustained power output I've ever done.  The bad news is the blue potting I did was stupid and detrimental.   Get an infrared thermometer and monitor.  Sorry guys.  So peak power still rocks but long sustained runs the heat doesn't disipate well
The magnets are rated to 212f and they shouldn't see as high heat as the stator.

The first reason wa to fix the stator which was becoming loose on its aluminum seat.  I think the increase of thermal expansion of aluminum compared to the steel stator had deformed the aluminum under the stator. maybe. Anyway I thought the blue goo could hold the stator and also transfer heat to the aluminum wall beside it and the skate hanger beyond.  I went overboard and covered half the breath holes as well as covering the winding on the other side as well. Dumb.

@Hummie since you have an open hub motor design, why not add a small fan like Turnigy SK3 motor series. It surely will blow the heat out of the hub motor. It will add things to the design and complications, but seems to work for turnigy. I believe Carvon hubs are using turnigy motors with fans as well.

Hub motor heats is still a mystery for me. Sometimes heating up, sometimes not depending on ESC. It could also be that VESC running with current control compared to duty cycle. I'll be keeping track how heat could be solved here.

I have yours in my bag now and am on the way.  

I don't know what glue is best but do know that any epoxy, preferably at least a half hour set-time, will work.   I've given up on thermal epoxyecause it's too thick.   Maybe heat up some regular stuff from the hardware store and then mix the two.  Do a two part epoxy. But hats being safe and maybe a softer polyurethane will allow them to be more easily removed later when u what to replace the big bearing

Great. I haven't heard of anyone running them yet except me. 

I'm doing 2 vesc with 60 amp max I think it was set to.  12s and now 11s. When my watt meter was working it only ever showed 45 amp max even though I have it set to 60


The caliber need further threading.  I just got a pair down for 20$ at an auto body place.  a machine shop is more likely to have it.  Forget the thread I the axle now though

I grew to like my weird wheel colors that didn't match. especially when they're still new they collect dirt on the tread a lot and it all just looks dirty.  And they smell when u get hem hot.  I just switched my 83 duro back to 89. They were starts to get some play.  Movement. Looseness.  I should've just sent everyone 89. I don't know what everyone's duro is.  Ride it and tell me how it goes.

Power source I'm using a Meanwell .. I forget the model number but it's 48 amp and adjustable and can do over 50.  I like it but there are simpler to use power sources.  The Meanwell is really goofy so a tiny screw to adjust voltage that I have to turn every 15 min. There are others that have a digital readout and easier to work <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/6234e24ca7d633776047addac0ca7196de70345b.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

@Jack The outside flange (purple) that holds the urathane on the motor is held in place by 6 screws..........between each screw holding the flange - (see last photo with purple flange) is a ~7mm hole. The motors need some more ventilation and a screen to keep sediment out of the motor itself. The flange is ~ 6cm diameter......with "vent holes" centered   ~7.5mm from the edge of flange. What would be considered the exterior of the motor or the face the flange presses up agaianst - the outside face of the hub.....has a recess ~1cm in diameter which would take the screen or could be used as a foot.


The first two pictures are the motor hub with urathane mounted without the purple flange (you can see the recessed area)

The final pic is the motor with one screw holding the flange on the hub.

I forget the exact dimensions of the hole but it would be great if the angled tubes went the distance of the steel and aluminum, I think it's 5mm, and were held there by sitting a bit in the thin spot where the screen was intended to go.

Something like this construction with layers on the printer, but each layer slightly to the side to create a slanted blade.

The blue goo is everywhere. A mistake. The benefits are that it'll keep the windings secure.  The bad news is it makes the motor hotter.  I'm riding with the blue goo and the motor's peak wattage is still great but the continuous wattage is decreased with the heat build up.  Ride it.  See how it does.  Talk to me if u have a problem.  If it's an issue we can work it out.  I'm in the blue goo now and it's good.   U won't be able to remove it

U still need to glue the motor on the skate axle. Other than that there is nothing else to do

I haven't discovered the best way to do it but at this point I've found thicker epoxy is hard to screw into and heating the epoxy will make it thinner.  
So far I've used j and b weld, good but brittle and not the best, and two high heat epoxies.  Use two-part, high heat and longer cure time stuff and warm the parts first. 

Unless u use a really thin glue, if u can find one, paint the axle and the hole and screw it in. Try to get as much in there but not overflow and get it on the bearing!

The purple plates hold the rubber on.  Screw them to the black motor with the screws. Don't drop a screw in the wrong hole.

Lever is on the war path and I'm here to cover my bases!   These motors go and go well.  Disappointingly I put thermal epoxy on all of urs.  Idiot.  The motors are solid though and I ride all the time and have no issues with anything related to the motor.  The softer rubber I'm finding will overly soften and deform from the high heat and I'm thinking the 89 duro, which I've done over 200 miles on and hit 220f with, is good though.  More than good. 

I'm not looking to follow a path of problems with this design and other than needing harder rubber I'm also going to be getting the compete motor made in steel
So the bearings can be pressed in. Solid. As it is now its an aluminum shaft using retaining fluid to do a close eproximation of a press fit.  
But fear not, U will not break these motors as is though and at worst u could have a bit of rattling and want to open it up to add more retaining fluid. 
Anyone who got these from me I won't leave u dangling..if u have a problem with ur rubber we can work it out

Ride it!  I'll be sending u the softer stuff as its all I have for another week.  U probably have the harder stuff already.  Try it.  Get it up to 200f then bomb a hill and try to slide it and see what happens.  The softer stuff is good for over 200 miles at least and if u aren't trying to go full speed it'll last much longer

I was just thinking about machanical issues and I've been thinki and saying the only hurdle is mechanical.  

I'm so impatient I got 120 motors after only having ridden the prototype maybe 200 miles before it shorted.  It's all very experimental and I discovered problems and won't go into them but now... I'm ready to move away from these motors because they have an aluminum center.  My first motors were silent for the short time they were going.  My new 2 motors have also done maybe 150 miles and one is rattling.  I could press it open with a simple press but the ring is loctited with red and even my special tool for the ring won't budge it without a lathe chuck or something to clamp it.  Open it.  Clean the bearing seats with a knife, squirt more on,  get it back together, and hope for the best and listen.
The manufacturer will do the same motors with a steel center instead of the purple aluminum.  Heavy but solves the stator spin problem and the stator can just be pressed on, but more important the bearings can be pressed on.   

I'd like to see how ur putting urs together Jerry. What are the bearings sitting on and press or slide fit?  


I hate rattling. I more so added retaining fluid (on the motors I sent) on the aluminum side. The aluminum side can't move or the aluminum might deform.  

It's hard to sell something, I have 70 of, when I'm already excited about the steel one.   but we will see


If anyone wants to do it in steel the manufacturer said it would be the same price! I thought that was great. Anyone who wants in on that...whatever the minimum order quantity I can get it down to.   I'll be going back to work at saving my dollars.  I'll sell anyone an aluminum center one 100$  I get them for 64.50 and then PayPal and shipping from China and another  3 from PayPal when people buy them and me pouring the rubber. 100$. Anyone who wants an aluminum or steel!  The aluminum I'll send u immediately and the steel...once we can get enough orders

I ride the aluminum now.  Or did till today as my receiver keeps conking out after bashing it.  Very scary and it locked me on throttle and I had to abandon ship.  Running running and over falling. But not a scratch.

Or maybe I just need some higher heat retaining fluid.

This is a DIY forum and basically anything bought here is a work in progress......Enertion, DIY, Ollin, Cavon, Jacob Hubs, Longhaired Boy, Hummie ext all are doing their damnedest to make some cool ass shit that others might dream of and because they are legit dudes and maybe want to make some coin, offer said cool ass shit to everyday Joe's and dudes that like tech.

 I hope that Hummie's saucy purple people eaters last more than 200 miles and I'm pretty sure they will, but if not.....then I got to be a part of the experience and I will have learned a shit ton and will have helped a good dude figure out how to make innovative cool ass shit better. 

Hummie has been great with communication and upfront bout stuff AND not 24 hr ago specifically told us that he won't leave us hanging. Don't be hating on ideas- it speaks volumes that even broke and with a house full of V1's he is already thinking ahead for V2's. Also he lets these go AT COST. He's not finalized this yet.

Fortunatly my local skateshop had no problems with swapping out my trucks, so i got some 180mm Arsenal Cast trucks.

Nice.  Ride those wheels and I'll send u some black in the next month no cost except shipping

Guys these motors don't break at 200 miles!  These blue ones in particular get hot and maybe that's what it is but the retaining fluid has vanished on one of my motors and it rattles.  It rattles less than a regular wheel but to solve the rattle the motors need to be opened and maintained.  It's a pain. Maybe mine is the only one that will rattle. Maybe no one else cares if theirs rattles a bit.  
It is very rare to find a loaded bearing on an aluminum shaft and that's what these motors are.  It's a big anodized aluminum shaft but none the less it's aluminum.  These seems typical as I know Jacobs motors are aluminum with a smaller shaft and a slide fit.  (It has to be slide fit because u need to take it apart to replace the rubber.  These motors are intended to be non-openable so that the tolerances can be kept minimal. U have to press these motors apart not simply undo some screws and it falls apart.  Especially on an aluminum bearing seat it needs to be fixed or things will wear. But u getting an interference or press fitting on aluminum especially with its much larger than steel thermal expansion..not ideal.   If the motors were all steel, not half steel, they could be pressed steel as mechanical parts should be.   But   I was told aluminum would do, and it does, but requires retaining fluid.  This is simply glue for bearing seats and makes an effective press fitting. As long as it stays put the motors are silent.  Maybe it was temperature related and I over cooked it.  Maybe there's another higher heat stuff.  There probably is a better one and I just jumped on whatever was handy. Loctite makes a million things.

Hitting 220f likely is the cause as well as hitting 180
Often.   I'm sorry the blue goo was a mistake.

Just telling u how it could go.  At worst you'll have a rattle that will take some elbow grease to get rid of. 

I designed these motors for me foremost and I'm picky.   Their performance is fantastic. The only problem is a potential rattling.  I hope people who got these have an infrared thermometer and keep track of their temps and if they do and up with a rattle that annoys them I can send u in the right direction and lend u the tools to open it up and fix it

Everyone seems confused by what I'm writing . The issue is having an aluminum shaft with a motor that takes load and also gets hot. Actually I'm looking into different retaining fluids that are better than what I was using.  I think it might solve it.   

Tapping a spot beside the bearing seat would be really awkward and still not make a solid connection for the bearing.

This forum is exciting.  im happy.  No offense taken from anyone.  I like to argue anyway. 

I don't know the future but know what I want, and glad to hear it's what you want.  I want this design and just the details of the bearing interface needs to be figured.   I really goofed with the blue goo and have all our motors cooking much hotter and that could be the cause of the rattle. I'm pretty sure it's the little bearing and it's connection to the steel that's moving.
   I've over-loctited with red....3 times now and needed a lathe chuck to lock the rotor to open these.  I've also had rings come loose and once I rode on the magnets for a bit.   But I'm not blaming the design just my own inability to do shit right.   Either better retaining fluid, or possibly a very slight interference/press fit (which I don't like the idea of with the thermal expansion, or steel.  It's one of those three and hopefully number one.  This green stuff isn't spectacular.  But it is holding all other 7 connections on both motors.  I'll find something.

arsenals and kegels on the way for me aswell!

I originally ordered two 180mm arsenals, but after seeing the above pics, I emailed them to ask if I can change my order to one 165, and one 180mm..... Hopefully they can, or cancel my order and let me re-order. 

I also think I'll just run a single motor on my new stealth build because ATM I only have one VESC, and really wanna try these guys out. With no hills, 10s, and only weighing 65ish kg, I think one motor will be fine for the time being.

@hummie I'm not worried at all- the motors look brilliant, and if there is some DIY spirit involved to get rid of rattles so what! The rubber is super easily changeable, and everything looks solid, so I think with some care they'll last a while.

Add at least 2 more layers of heat shrink coming out of the motor.  I ran out of the right size and sent some without any.


700 for the board.  The carbon covered batteries above. The yellow are dying from bangs.


I want these to be as awesome as I know they can be.  If any of u find the heat an issue and have loose bearing issues I'll send u another set for 150.

Maybe as simple as this high hest stuff.  I think the blue goo is the ultimate culprit..but they need to be able to hit 180 comfortably anyway.  My old non-blue motors ran much much cooler.  I'd never seen anything past 150f before and the blue goo motor I've seen a crazy 220 racing on rolling hills.

Hi @Hummie returning from the questions you asked earlier about the mounting of the chinese hub motor, I think I understand your question.

Ive just did another hub motor inspection and I found that I could just remove the Hub motor cover (those tiny 6 little m3 bolt) without first opening the m8 hex bolt that keeps everything in place. Therefore the bearing has no retaining fluid on the inner side and both bearings inside the hub motor handles no side load torsion.

My first post - so hi to you all on eSk8.

[quote="Hummie, post:129, topic:1002, full:true"]
The first reason wa to fix the stator which was becoming loose on its aluminum seat.  I think the increase of thermal expansion of aluminum compared to the steel stator had deformed the aluminum under the stator. maybe. Anyway I thought the blue goo could hold the stator and also transfer heat to the aluminum wall beside it and the skate hanger beyond.  I went overboard and covered half the breath holes as well as covering the winding on the other side as well. Dumb.
[/quote]

Maybe the [Arctic-Alumina-Thermal-Adhesive](http://www.amazon.com/Arctic-Alumina-Thermal-Adhesive-5g/dp/B0009IQ1BU) (2k thermal compound) could be interesting for what you are trying to do.
It's quite expensive @8$/5g though.

Regarding really strong 2k glue I would recommend [UHU Endfest 300](http://www.amazon.com/epoxy-resin-adhesive-Double-syringe/dp/B000WGYSVO) 
Whenever I need glueing that lasts - that's what I use and it has never failed.

It is rated: tension and shear resistance (aluminium) [datasheet](http://www.nikhef.nl/pub/departments/mt/projects/KM3NeT/Referencedesigns/DOM_DigitalOpticalModules/Ref5/Drawings/uhu_plus_endfest_300_eng.pdf)
10 hours: 500N/cm²
24 hours: 1200N/cm²
5 days: 1700N/cm²


Also if you heat it with a hot air gun to around 50°C it will be thin as water - just be careful not to make it too hot or it will deteriorate.

@Hummie
Not sure if this was mentioned before. But instead of having to epoxy the wheels on. What if you made the screw with a reverse thread? So that way it self tightens as long as you're moving forward? 

Also what are u guys using for expoxy or does thread lock work

Actually - if you think about it some more - this isn't a bad idea.

At least if you modify it a bit:

This is just a really fast mockup for visualization.
The green screw represents the truck axle,

If you bore out the motor e.g. to 8.05mm (this is vastly exaggerated in the picture)
and have e.g. 8mm tapped on the outside to screw on the motor.

This way it will be locked by the nut.

I haven't calculated it though - if it can hold the acceleration/braking torque,
but if it does there is no need for glue anymore.

I don't think u have to worry about an adhesive breaking if u use the right stuff.  High heat two part epoxy or maybe what Ecco or maybe even the glue lever mentioned.  Loctite I think isn't good enough because maybe over time the aluminum would fatigue on the steel.  I heard it was ok but it's better to make a solid buffer between the two parts I think.

I am fairly new to e-boarding, so I hope you will forgive my naivety about the methods for securing hub motors to trucks, but I have been wondering why I haven't seen anyone use a circular clamp method in the style that's used for conventional satellite motors to trucks.  Using the truck clamp from @torqueboards v4 mount as an example, if this clamp or something similar were strategically bolted (or welded) to the inner end of the hub motors, (around where the axle would be) it could make life a lot easier for securing the hub motor to, or even changing your trucks. 

Yes there might be some aesthetic issues to work through, but it would be much simpler than worrying about the chemical and physical properties of epoxies to keep your motor(s) secure :slight_smile: .

But glue is strong.  Glue can be much stronger than the power of the motor.  They say glue holds planes together these days. 
  I've done tests and even red loctite on just the threads need 35ft/lbs to turn and when it does turn it barely turns and the motors might put out 10ft/lbs.  But I don't recommend  loctite as more so the worry to me is the forces going through the aluminum sitting on the steel axle.   A buffer between the two is good.

It's common for typical outrunner  to have their stator glued to the bearing tube.  They have keyways cut in the stator but I've never seen them used and it's just a press fitting with some glue.  The torque applied to the motor on the skate axle is the same force on this stator to bearing tube connection and I don't hear of them spinning....unless they're on solid aluminum where the aluminum expands and deforms.

You'll see it's all there. Other than my blue goo fiasco and I think the rubber at 83 duro isn't good enough things are done.  I ride the crap out of my motors.  Drop them. Run them over by a car.  I look forward to future testing by other people.  And that's the mechanical aspect...electrically, as a motor, these are the most efficient motors u will find period simply because they have stator laminations almost half as thick as everything else at .2mm. Cuts done iron losses hugely.  Efficiency means less heat which means higher wattage possible 
I sold my board complete. 
Rent, rubber, and 3D printed fins for the motor holes.

I applied an extra layer of heatshrink on all leads (on the pic the right one is done). I also got some cable sheating which i'll throw on when i finally receive my VESC's and i can solder the whole thing together.
[img]/uploads/db1493/original/2X/6/6d06ee6c60be73600dff755b871faefa0ffe0f1c.jpg[/img]


One small thing i noticed about these motors and what would make them even better, is if the leads that come out of the motor would be on the same symmetrical spot when mounted. I tried switching left/right, and this is the closest to symmetrical i could get (i'm going to turn the truck around so the wires won't be so visible from behind).

That would be very hard to od as different hanger might have slightly different threading. Btw I would recommend to heat shrink all of the 3 wires together if you have a heat shrink that fits in. This would give additional protection to the wires coming out just incase they went undo (glue heating up undoing lock).

skate axles all have the same threading but just different lengths along the axle.    

Mine have 4 layers of shrinkwrap and it becomes kind of rigid and sticks out and there's nothing Needed to hold it.  I've got Velcro holding them comin out of the vescs.   Turning is not a problem as the wires all come to the center of the truck [Uploading...]() 
I did get lucky with a symmetrical wire set up, actually I think it's probably because the epoxy I used was too thick and the motor didn't bottom out.  

Check ur motors and feel how solid they are. Any movement in bearings or the axle especially is no good.   Talking of tight fittings, and keeping the competition fierce, lever's motors up till now at least, are a mismatch of an 8mm bearing 
sitting on a 5/16 inch axle.  True that's what they do in the skate world and I can crank them down so there's no play, and I do, but in an electric motor u won't find that happening. I don't know if retaining fluid could even fill a gap that size.  We should expect it silent and solid.

And the rubber. Check it competely for movement before u get it going.  feel it when its hot.  Be aware

Hey mate really!
I have made an effort not to even post here but
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-nicest-hub-motors-for-sale-cheaper-than-anywhere/1002/205?u=jacobbloy

"The most efficient hub motors out there"
Blatant lie or your just and idiot!

Customers are complaining your motors are getting to hot a 0.2mm stator lamination isn't going to help that there getting hot because your winding has a high resistance. Every motor factory (tiger motor, scorpion, hacker, maytech including my factory have 0.2mm lamination you didn't invent this)
Making your motor rated up to 200deg won't make any difference. Ferrari don't have a powerful engine because it's rated up to 1000deg it's because they engineered good breathing and cooling and made the dam thing efficient.

I remember a conversation with Theo from inboard that I had while helping them with there design, I suggested to use 45SH magnets because of the heat rating he said "jacob why would I ever need this? I would never let my motors go over 60deg"

This is true and some thing you should really work on.

Low efficiency produces heat, high resistance produces heat, to much eddy current leakage can produce low efficiency and finally to much eddy current can produce heat.

You talk about bearings bearings bearings and tolerance and glue but do you even know how to fix any of these efficiency's because these are the most important parts to a hub motor because if you don't fix them then go back to a belt drive and don't waist the time and money!

Choose your reply carefully because if you reply with a smart ass comment or some thing bad about my motors in return then ppl might actually see that you don't know what you are doing when it comes to the actual electrical engineering aspects of these motors.
Or you could head to google or wiki or some of the very educated members of this forum who might help you and fix the dam problem!

You don't know what ur talking about yet calling me an idiot. 

The reason some of the motors are getting hot is because they have thermal epoxy in some of them and it retains heat. 
My windings have the lowest resistace possible because it's single strand copper. The only thing that will beat that is silver single strand or graphene if it ever comes out.  Look it up. Learn it.  Then try to make urs that low resistance and while ur at it how but telling us what urs is!!

I didn't invent .2mm laminations and as u say there are some manufacturers that use it.  How much do they sell their motors for?  Huge cost. What's YOURS?   You will not find anyone running .2mm stator lam motors on their board unless they spent at least 250$ for the motor alone. Most of the motor manufacturers u listed will SOMETIMES do a .2mm stator but often it's .25.  Look it up.  These are where the majority of the iron losses come from especially because with a hub motor's fewer commutation sleep hysteresis lower. Look it up and learn and the get back to me when u know what you're talking about

Temperature?  U don't know what ur talking about and I'm not impressed with your name dropping.  If you research scorpion motors or other motors that have higher performance it's often because they use higher heat magnets enabling the motor to go to higher heat and therfore higher wattage.  Look it up.  Do a search for scorpion high heat magnets. In fact they use weak magnets so they can get higher temp ability and they make up for it wth a smaller airgap
 
"Low efficiency produces heat, high resistance produces heat, to much eddy current leakage can produce low efficiency and finally too much eddy current can produce heat.".
  I don't think u know what ur talking about again and if anything your explaining why my motors are more efficient than ANY motor you will find.  Sure low efficiency and high resistance produce heat.  My motors are more efficient then yours because I have single strand wire, and they limit eddy current way more then yours because of the thin stator lamination.  What strand count and how thick are your lams?  Air cooling.. I have room for air turbines in my holes and I'll be sure to show u the results when they come in 

Smart ass comment?   How bout u respond to my questions above and we can get some other people around who know something and we can show you how electronic motors work 

My motor will crush yours or any other in terms of efficiency because of the reasons I've listed.  Find someone to tell me otherwise and I'll give you a kiss.   I also have a super thick shaped flux ring/rotor while yours...see what happens when you put iron on the outside of the rotor.  Theres your wasted flux.  

I had a batch of stupid thermal epoxy experimentation and hope to get unadulterated motors in their hands.  I'm willing to lose money on this.   Anyone who bought a set of the blue motors I'll send a set of the better motors for 100$!!!plus shipping.  

That was my first stupid batch.   when you sent me and everyone else what was supposed to be your 5th iteration prototype beta bull ...it didn't work at all and u told us not to ride them because we would die.  And I know u didn't give everyone their money back. 

I'm stunned.  The reason I made these is because urs were such crap!  I imagine they must've finally gotten better but mechanically u will allways be at a huge disadvantage: you have multiple little screws, multiple interfaces, all slide fittings, and no way to replace rubber without taking the motor apart.  A motor you can take apart and isn't locked tight, especially with an aluminum shaft...we will see.
And we will see that mechanical challenges are what it's really about 


The only reason my motors are compromised in performance is because I added all this thermal epoxy which turns out to be detrimental.   Certainly beats your 1st, second,third, or whatever pile of crisp you called what u sold us a year and a half ago.   You were so full of it.  Lies lies lies and incompetence.  I won't even go into it.  

We will see Jacob we will see.  And when u actually learn some science instead of claiming to, and stop dropping names, you'll know what I'm talking about.

Well there are carvon, jacob and hummie. I doubt the chinese Hub motor that I have would be a par versus these 3. But in the name of science this is interesting.

I am a noob in motor, surely looks different, made different and likely perform different. Honestly the carvon seems to have more mature design compared to the others. But I am convinced that the rest would do just fine.

I dont know, but what matters to me now is like onloop said. Road is the real test! Is not only about powr and efficiency, but endurance is more something I like to see. Keep it positive guys.

How bout a race with hard turn and rough roads for 100 miles and a thermometer.  At worst for me the retaining fluid, even though it's high heat stuff, cooks eventually after many miles of use but I always have the ability to do the motors with press fittings and even steel if that ends up the case.   Anyone who ends up with loose fittings eventually I've got u covered and will sell u a motor in pressed steel FOR COST if u want or I'll open them up and get more fluid in.  and carvon...I imagine they rattle but at least it's steel on steel.  Jacob is selling slide fitting aluminum connections everywhere that have no pressing(shouldn't press aluminum) and he requires many interfaces like this.   No way that will last and will also sound like a bag of cans being dragged on its way to the dump.  He says its for him to worry about and not for the customers to concern themselves with.  Dig through the brown smelly haze he spews

Even if he were to make all connections with high heat retaining fluid you'll need to press the motor apart to change the rubber.   I don't know if those dinky screws and aluminum plates, all slid together, could take repeated or even one pressing

Look at the designs people.  Get to know what we're talking about.   Yea his will look cool but how bout after 1000miles of sliding!😳

How about you tell us your winding turns and you say it's single strand!

Well these are the 2 winding photos I have found

Know maybe I am an idiot and it hard to know from a photo but it doesn't look like you are using a Wye winding (if you are my mistake I just can't see) but in a delta winding to get 80kv in your size stator you would be using a 20-25 turn winding, this means there is no way you are using a thick copper and in the pick you can see that so let's say you are using a 1.0mm copper strand which as about right for the picture, for a winding you need to take 3 things into account (turns,resistance and the copper cross section)
The copper cross section is what sets your amp limit.
So the copper cross section,  say you used 1.0mm copper in a single strand your cross section will be 17.28
Your resistance 163.7mOhms

My motor is 24 slot so apples to oranges:
Cross section less at 10.97
But my resistance is less at 130.8

The point is don't say your motor are the most efficient around because I have never said that!

Maybe your should have said my hub motors are the most efficient at this price or most efficient hub motors but you didn't!

And if you where going to use a single strand winding you need a custom winding to actually get this to work, this is what a single strand winding should look like.

 I don't know who tag is or why I'd have mud on my face.  



Those are old pics keep looking and you'll find the fatter wire.  The 80kv have 33 turn and the 90kv have 30 turns.  Single strand.   Plug that in your machine and see what you get. 


"for a winding you need to take 3 things into account (turns,resistance and the copper cross section)
The copper cross section is what sets your amp limit." 

Don't spread your bull here as if you know what you're talking about!  The copper cross- section isnt the only thing that decides how many amps you can do it also depends on the wire length, and all copper wire in a certain cross-section will have practically the same resistance.   Unless you're winding a motor cross section isn't necessary to know if you know the resistance. 

Fool you come here trying to show off.   Talk about how you have the electrical side of things covered. Don't hear a peep out of you about mechanical
Issues and you say it's for you to know.  We will see how your aluminum plated little screw motor does in 1000 miles. Ask any machine shop about your aluminum shaft with a slide fitting and tell me your knowledge then 


Good for you you might have a .2.  It'll make it worth replacing your shaft over and over.

What the hell is a custom winding !?  U like that word.   It works and you can call it custom if you like. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/a/a5b3734d27f080bcc0d0756ec60e820ae5a3537a.jpg" width="666" height="500">

My motor is still more efficient than yours even if you have a .2mm lamination and a single strand...you've got flux leakage out of your little flux ring.  Look at mine.  The grooves are behind the magnets where surprisingly there is no flux.  Other than that it's 2mm thick 1020 steel.  Let's see you put some iron on your rotor and see if it sticks or falls off

But all this isn't important.  I will have turbines that will sit on the 5x6mm holes for air as well and that's not important.  What's important is my motors consist of two parts and a ring and bearings.  I have a steel bell where u have I don't know how many little screws and aluminum plates and small bearings and all slide fitted

You said with thicker copper it looks basically the same what thickness is it.

Also a messy winding reduces efficiently,
Single stand winds at this small copper thickness increases risk of copper breakage and rendering it almost useless because it's only 1 strand unless it's not?

.that pic you posted has maybe 12 turns of fat wire.  That is maybe 200kv but probably a lot more <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/e/ef8c314cae0525fa0811f144cd0e4893906798ba.jpg" width="666" height="500">

The kv depends on more than the turns it also depends on the flux ring and airgap but nonetheless that is gong to be a very high kv motor you posted. Not ideal for a hub motor unless it's running on low voltage which isn't ideal but maybe smooth boards are limited legally to a low voltage since they're selling compete board  

Here's a pic of a 90kv beside a 200kv
30 turns and 22 both single strand

ZTrue it could be wye. Good for you you have something to say that's valid.   Although wye windings aren't ideal for shorter stators such as that. 

What a jackass you're making it out like someone does my work for me. 


Had you actually made something that worked a year and a half ago I wouldn't be so annoyed with hearing you.   Just upgraded plates and that was it?  To remind you, you assured me and everyone then the motors work and the rubber was round.  None of the above.  You either knew you sent everyone stuff that would implode or you didn't bother to look at anything before shipping it.   The rubber...there's no way to see it other than just dishonest.   And that was supposedly version 5 or something!  Your full of it and that's just one story to tell. But you get away with it and you're still here. And that's why I'm here.  I'm like a fresh breeze on a sea littered with sewage.

Please excuse my drama. I shouldn't get emotional and we're all just on a chat site. 

Sorry all of urs are blue.  I'll send u all another set for 100$. I really should've tested before doing them all! 
Sorry for the extra cost.  You can't remove it.  

But ride it and even if it gets hot, and loses some efficiency there,  they still have a lot of power just not for long periods.  I really like them even though they're blue.  I still haven't gotten around to trying a blue-free motor but just glued some up

But please ride them and tell me what happens. I've been learning how to put them together with retaining fluid on all surfaces and some of yours I did less...and some people, everyone, doesn't have the thin purple spacer in the motor.  I now am putting them in.  It makes e motor easier to put together and assures the bearings a more secure position laterally. So ur in for the unknown there and it'd be nice to get your feedback with these high heat motors as they're a good test since they get hot.

But don't worry about the heat and ride them!! If u have an infrared thermometer or not.  I've hit 220 and 170 often. That's a lot hotter than feels too hot to touch.

I've been riding the unadulterated (non-blue) motors the last two days.  The good news and the bad news.:
My testing of the different motors ( 100kv, N45sh magnets, .4mm airgap; 80kv, blue thermal motors, N50m mangnets, .5mm airgap; 90kv, N50m, .5mm airgap) isn't so scientific and the unscientific results are continuing for the next hour!:slight_smile:

So far it's showing that all end up with similar heat except the 90kv seem to rocket up hills faster than any of them ( u all have 80kv).  My test of seeing the temp a tthe top of my local hill isn't so good because I can get up there so fast with these motors.

Racing myself to the beach and back and see what temp I hit now

The bearings I'm disappointed becaus rim getting s bit of seizing even at only 150f and it could be that little spacer!  Or not. 
I'm learning myself here and want to go steel and pressed bearings with .4mm airgap and the high temp magnets.  That would be the machine that will have no problems.  I also have a little rattle with these new unblue ones I'm riding.  Disapointing.  As long as ur aluminum side is secure though it's steel on steel and ok as I say. 
That's the somewhat bad news, the other bad news is I'm retracting the offer of 100$ for a pair of these aluminum ones if u already bought a set of the blue. They're too similar and u won't notice much if any temp difference.   I can't be losing money on these and I am left and right.  But but...anyone who buys a set at the 300$ cost or already got a set I'll sell u a set of the all steel pressed bearings with the .4mm airgap and N45sh magnets( they hit 300f) at the manufacturers cost which they're now saying is 65.50$ That machine will be Solid.  Bit heavier but there's more important things 

Seems someone has taken my design and run with it.  I shouldn't have maybe said so much as the manufacturer is had other people asking for my motors and they're saying they will alter the design and sell them!!  Wow and theyre barely tested. 
The goal is a solid ...sollllid..motor which can hit high temp no problem and won't suffer from thermal expansion or retaining fluid issues.  Steel is the answer to a lot more power and solving all mechanical issues. 

I hope u guys are into this and we can head this direction down the road.    The aluminum rock and mine are going strong ..bit of rattle and a max temp of 200f I don't like though.

Hopefully I get some loyal customers who want a bomb-proof design like me. 

Royalties? I don't have patents and it's China!  My goal is to get something solid produced and sell it cheaper than everyone.  And get a set myself!

Anyone who gots these please remember this is experimental and we've rushed into it and we've gone, regrettably, with aluminum.  It's the root of all the issues and questions.  These issues and questions are really my own since no one has put their cents in after riding these really.  

The latest issue, with my new non-blue motors, when one gets above 150 the bearings are being compressed (thermal expansions of aluminum so high likely) and I'm going to the machine shop to get it opened and see if it's because it has the tiny shim.  Who knows and really even when I do find out I know it's rooted in the compromise of using aluminum.  I could go on and on about how aluminum isn't good for these.

Im Definately doing a GoPro video really soon and show the power these motors have.  
People who bought these already and haven't put them together or are on the fence about getting these and concerned
If u get a set of these at 150$ a set, with rubber, you get them and if at anytime ur not happy with how they perform...ill sell u the steel set for 150. They are sold for 65$ to me and I still have the expense of the rubber and time.   There's no scam here just trying to get me those steel motors.  The aluminum .. U will see in the video. 
Ultimately we want not just the rotor steel, which it is, but also the purple piece in the center which is now aluminum to be steel as well.  All steel we can have the bearings pressed, as they're supposed to be, not me using retaining fluid and a tight slide fitting,  a steel shaft is what is needed to not have to think twice.  U could even just mount them with loctite then and I wouldn't think twice. 
Who is riding these besides me!? Things take time I know and even now I just broke down again. Hope it's my receiver connection. It went away when I hot glued the plug but it's back: one motor shutting off and on
I'm waiting to see what the minimum quantity they will do of the steel

I have to say, I can't tell if its the difference between the carvons and hummies motors, or the difference between 12s and 10s, but they had way more power then I expect. Starting from stop like a champ. My carvons can start from stop, but not with the power these things had. Running hummies motors at 12s is felt really solid. Again, I did 3 back and forths, so I can't speak about hills or reliability yet. But my initial impression was that these motors have a lot of torque, way more than my carvons (and that makes since, 90kv compared to 145kv, you'd expect the lower kv to have more torque). The question will also be in the top speed. I ride my carvons at 25-30 mph as much as possible. Idk if 30 mph is possible with these, or for extended periods of time.

I will be doing more side by side comparisons with hummies 80kv motors and the carvons soon. I need the rest of the truck parts from hummie tomorrow, and waiting to get my carvons back becuase guess what, machining into the hanger to attach the motors creates a weak spot, and mine bent. So I'm waiting to get the back. Either way, I will be testing both vigorously and comparing the 2 as best as possible, using the same setup but with different hub motors.

I am a hard rider. I punch the throttle to its limit, I like speed. As someone who has ridden a skateboard almost every day for the last 10 years (minus the 3 surgeries I had due to skateboarding), I push the boundaries of what should be done on a skateboard.. I pushed the carvons, and they broke. They will  (be fixed, and we will see if they break again. I will push hummie's, and see if they break. If so, I will take them to hummie, have him do what he can, and push them till they break again. The hope is not to break them, the hope is I never have an issue. The problem is, everyone wants to say they have the best shit. Well, send said shit my way, and I will tell you if it can hold up to my 195 pounds, steep hills, and very aggressive riding. So far, Enertion - Failed (could work, but what I was (told to buy and) sold was not what I needed. I needed a larger belt, this wasn't an option at the time. When told I was breaking belts left and right,I was told it was my fault. The problem was, 9mm single belt on steep hills means belts break every 3 weeks. But instead of point me to a larger belt elsewhere, he says its my fault), Carvon - Failed, but redemption is possible (Jerry has been extremely nice to me, and willing to repair them with my only cost being shipping in one direction), and now Hummie's - Unknown... It will be interesting...

most people should know by now that there are people who do actually use 9mm wide belts on a single drive successfully... I certainly don't recommend it though... so it's unlikely i forced you to buy them against your will, you put them in your cart & paid for them didn't you?

other contributing factors to broken belts are:
1. poorly aligned motor mount
2. wobbly wheel pulley
3. over tightened belt.
4. ESCS with no/limited throttle & brake force control functions 

I made this video which clearly explains what you should have.... using a VESC is recommended as you can control brake force.

At he end of the day, I did say it could have worked, but I did mention several times, that I was breaking belts way too often. I fixed alignment several times. Belts lasted longer if I was more careful accelerating and breaking gently. But in the end of the day, I was lead to believe it was still something I was doing wrong, despite spending hours to have about as perfect alignment as possible.

I believed you, I tried 4 variations of tightness, till I found the best spot where belts lasted the longest. I aligned the mount until it was a perfect 90 degree angle.

I don't think it was you intentionally misleading me, but I think you didn't know that a 12mm or 15mm would have solved my issues of breaking belts. You now offer 12mm belts. This would have been a solution.

Also, on the people using 9mm belts, I know many people do. The fact of the matter is, how many of them ride every day? Of the ones left, how many ride steep hills that last for miles? Of the ones remaining, how many ride aggressively? I bet out of 100, your down to less than 10. And I remember seeing a lot of people (even prominent members) complain about belts breaking regularly since I joined this forum

I don't mean to attack you, I'm simply stating my experience from emailing you dozens of times, to buying stuff, and emailing you again and again afterwards. It was great to have a human to talk to me, but nothing you told me solved my problem. Break downs like that video simply didn't exist when I had these issues.

Again, this is why I said It **could work**. It's just that my experience of communicating, buying, testing, and communicating didn't end up with a long term viable solution. I can't expect you to spoon feed me everything, but the problem was really quite a simple design oversight on my behalf that I would expect someone who designs these kind of systems to be aware of and able to mention it. Of all the things you told me could cause this, you never mention the belt being too narrow could cause this. Again, I can't blame you for my oversights, but I look back and feel like I was sucked into your hype, sold on the line that "this system is the best, buy it and you won't regret it or have the issues that other systems have", when in reality, your 9mm design for a single drive is inferior, and you have since reconized that.

What I have said again, is just my experience with you. I don't hate you, because If I did, I wouldn't waste my time writing this right now. I respect your work and involvement in the community, but you can't blame everyone for the design flaws in your products (and btw, theirs design flaws in almost EVERY electronic product. The question as a company is, you do admit them and fix them, or blame them on your customer?). The reason people buy enertion, is so they don't have to sit down and do the work and math themselves. And when things don't work, and you blame the customer for not doing the math, its frusterating and a quick way to lose customers. I followed the videos, did everything I could to make it work, and when belts kept breaking, I was told its my mistakes. And as a customer who paid for what is suppose to be a high quality product, that is infurirating.

Alright gents back on topic,

@Hummie - Where do the purple washers go? Between the hub and truck? Somewhere in the hub? I am getting set to epoxy the hubs onto their place and want to make sure I'm not missing a piece befor I lock them on permenantly... 5mm motor plugs attached and setting up ESC'.....rainy ass day in Madrid so thought to prep for the week.

Because I was a newb at the time, it was my first build. And I wanted to keep as low budget as possible. The impression given was that dual drive was unnecessary. Why sell a product period that could easily brake? If I ever have the chance to sell a board, I wouldn't do less then dual, because I don't want a customer to be bummed out. I'm impressed what a single drive could do, so a dual? The reality is, I had other issues too. Debris from the messy, construction crazy San Francisco get into the belts. Lots of pebles, dirt, and sand (according to jerry from carvon at least).

To pull it back on topic however, My whole point of joining this discussion was to make one point, which is having gone from a signle drive belt, to a dual hub, and now another dual hub, I feel like hub motors like hummies are a glimpse of the future of e skateboards. FOC and 100% in-wheel motor. Compaq, yet full power. I'm ready to take them on.

My only thought is, bigger wheels? I like the carvons abec 11 90mm wheels. Super smooth riding.

@evoheyax LOL.. Yeah 9mm single motor don't hold up as well especially on steep hills and being the normal weight of a grown adult.

I ride in SF all day long and climb 20-30% inclines. Dual all the way.

I do want to see if the hub motors can climb my 20-30% inclines and can take the beating on the road.

Please do share.

Hi monkey.  The purple washer goes inside the motor but I likely didn't put it in yours.  Put it in a drawer and ride them as is and tell me how it goes after a couple hundred miles and then maybe we can get a decision on if it's better in or out.  The glue, do high heat ability stuff.  I can't read that label.    
Elkick they promised me things would change and are sorry about what they've done. They tell me they were selling them for 10$ more to everyone other than me but that doesn't make me happy either  This doesn't include the 2500 I had to spend to get the prototypes done among many other expenses and a lot of time. I want to keep a relationship with them and have them do the motors and they tell me the future will change 
The future is still...get these aluminum centered motors out for cheap and build the money to get 50 all steel made.  If anyone buys the aluminum at 200 a set$ you're assured the same price on the steel. That way even if we do have problems with the aluminum, which I think we will have, you have the ultra-reliable all steel with pressed bearings and can do 300f no problem.  You can throw them down the street when that kick flip doesn't work.

I'm skeptical that the rattle is caused by bearing compression. Bearings are engineered to handle high compression forces. That tiny bit of thermal expansion from  aluminum probably won't deform the steel inner ring of the bearing, and certainly won't damage the steel balls inside.   

Bearings aren't engineered to resist high temperatures or lateral forces. I'm thinking that the heat is breaking down the lubricant. Maybe put some speed cream or high - temp oil/grease in the bearings. That or they are misaligned from the lack of a shims, and lateral stresses are damaging the raceways. 

Just a guess. Let us know how they look when you open them up.

Opening didn't happen.  I tried and the red loctite didn't give using my huge 2-pin spanner and a table clamp. 
Strangely I was riding with evoheyax yesterday and his ring unscrewed itself.   I'll have to make a mold of the rotor outer grooves out of a soft metal that can be used in combo with the table clamp so I can really wrench on it
Ur motors are in the mail days ago htownbomber 

The rattle issue isn't the bearings themselves but the surfaces they sit against. A bearing is intended to be pressed into two steel surfaces: the shaft and housing, but I'm using high heat retaining fluid which is really an epoxy glue intended to make an effective press fitting while using tight slide fittings. The lateral forces and heat on the bearings is well within their specd ability.  If the bearing to steel bell/rotor interface becomes a looser fit it will rattle and that's been the issue.  I haven't had any bearings lose the tight interference fitting in the aluminum shaft side and that is the real concern.  A slide fitting on an aluminum shaft bearing heavy loads isn't good.  
Anyone who got a set from me is eligible for an all steel set and pressed bearings and back to the .4mm airgap and N45sh 300 degree temp magnets when they come in soon at the same 100$ each price That's the shit and I make pretty much no money considering the cost to me for the motors and my making of the wheels.  You will not damage those steel going up a mountain or riding down the gravel path on the backside.  The aluminum are still going strong anyway and the worst I've experienced is a slight rattle similar to a typical 5/16 inch skate bearing on its 8mm axle

I'm disappointed in the rubber you all got really.  It's a quick cure stuff and doesn't hold up well with the heat I'm finding, not as well as the slow cure stuff that my first 4 wheels are made of.   I was told it would have similar properties but it's showing not the case.  


This is experimental.   Screw ups happen but nothing too bad.    The blu goo,  the rubber, ...the aluminum...getting it right.   But please remember if u bought these I'm not "in business" if that means making a profit.  With all the expenses and not even talking about my time spent I'm losing money.

I won't leave u hanging though, if u bought anything I'll do what I can to get you what I can without getting myself evicted

The factory whose making his motors are selling them to 3rd parties without his consent. They stole his IP and are selling without his constant.

It's fucked up but this is what happens in China.

Having tested these things more, that are not perfected yet. I think the next version with the steel might be perfect.

However, if you keep an eye on heat, these things do work really well. I just did my first commute to my university and beside overheating a few times, they were great. So much power. I went up the steepest hill I have on anything and with so much power

I don't mind Brotherhobby  selling the motors really.  They said they would sell them to me for 66 and 80 anyone else. Now I can say their name and not worry about it. Who knows what will really happen and the lawyer I talked to said having a patent has to be done in every country they would be sold to. That's a surprise. I thought there'd be reciprocity or something.  He said he will look into the local Chinese law for me and that's how you do it.  As long as I get the motors I want.  This started as a community project and I dont want to get commercial. I don't respect intellectual property laws so I'm just the person to have their design copied.  I will sell these so cheap they won't be able to sell any!

Elkick helped me get this going by doing half of what we needed to order to make the bulk price. Esk8.de. 

And also they will do 20 for me in steel now as part of our deal.  Hope to order tonight!  

Am looking into higher heat rubber and finding it and got the 3D printed fan part is ready for me to go over and see the fit.  There's a deep hole there and I'll see

But my board is really bad right now. I put on a new can bus connector, putting the vescs together, but the sudden exceleration and stopping is happening again.  
Solder?  Potting?  I can't live long with this happening

It was the receiver wires going into the vesc. Surprising because it would be a problem with the receiver even off...and unless I'm crazy even with the battery disconnected.  Evoheyax was over and giggled the wires and found it.   I'm really freaked by how dangerous a bad receiver connection can be. Locking brakes or full throttle randomly. 

I check my transmitter voltage often. What voltage do u think is too low?  I do like the transmitter a lot.  The signal gets picked up right away unlike the quanum Id always used

I have them running. I didn't install them (hummie had done them) but hey run great. Was running 12s until I under charged a battery last night into the graveyard. Heat is something you should pay attention to (most likely due to the blue goo), but the torque is amazing, speeds are amazing. Even a single motor is super power (though I wouldn't recommend it, they will heat up quickly.). Best motors I've ridden so far in my opinion.

More important is the rubber and I'll send u all a set for 10$ plus shipping of the better stuff and I'll order that now and can have that out in a couple days.  I was told the fast cure stuff I was pouring was as good by the manufacturer, it's defiantly not.  My original slow cure 89 and the 83 are still a nice tight fit but everything I've been pouring has been getting loose.  You all have the fast cure stuff. U can ride it but it will loosen up.  I'm still riding the fast cure just to see how it goes, for the moment, but I can get that to u soon and you'll see it's good.

Yea there no point in testing now since the steel is going to happen.  A relief. 
In the future I'll mount the motors because I know it's a pain for each person to go through it and it adds to the cost while if I do them all its cheap. 

I like omega thermal epoxy number 100 in the little envelope they sell.  10$ and ud need two. But any high heat, two part, preferably slow cure epoxy will work.  Try to find high heat stuff and that's a bit harder and you'll likely have to get it online.  Heat it in the oven at 150f to make it thinner, mix it, pour into the motor hole half way, screw in the axle.  Clean the axle with acetone first. Don't get it on the bearing!  Use tape to make sure 

U really only need a bit of
Loctite on your ring and you'll be fine.  It will rattle a bit probably but only steel on steel. Sound like a regular skate wheel
Or open the motor and add "retaining fluid" to the two exposed sides of the bearings that sit in the bearing housing/rotor. The bearings already have it on the inside against the shaft and will be stuck there.

Actually that's not true and ...it would be great if u rode with it in, see how it does, try the motor with it out, and see how it does.  The goal is to get both bearings equally sharing the lateral load.  How to know if that's happening..that's where you show your awesomeness.

Both of ur motors have the big black threaded ring on the back of the motor loose.  The little purple shims save somewhere. Loctite both of the big threaded black rings that hold the motor together.  It should be pretty easy to tighten the ring but maybe have something that u can use to get into the ring's holes and help tighten it.  When it's tight, and the bearings are in the right place, you'll have no lateral movement in the motor.

Rightly tightly lefty loosey.   I'm pretty sure you're the one with the loose ring. If u can't move it with your hands maybe a bit of the retaining fluid is holding it.  Keep ur mind on it and listen for any noises...like a jingling sound because ur ring has come off and hanging on the hanger.  Beware.

Well between you and Jacob, what would be better?$335 vs $225. What mods do I have  to do to my trucks (180mm Paris) to get yours on and do the hub motors not have that blue shit on them? I also like you hummie personally and like your close location. So convince a hub motors skeptic. $225 on the line

the best part about buying these is if later you decide slide fitted bearings and aluminum shafts are for weight weenies and you want to get the all steel pressed bearings motor...you can have them for the same price. 

These are two rare sized 57mm motors not 63mm.  If you feel you're more than my 155lbs and will be doing long steep things Jacobs are a safer bet in that regard.  But I have no problem blasting around San Francisco of sustained 8 blocks of steep climbing.  

These match the kegel wheel size/shape and are recessed in the wheel.  Good for sidewalk cracks and not feeling you're on a hot rod.  

These are sealed motors with effectively press fitting on all bearing contacts. You can have a sealed motor, solid, if you are able to replace the rubber without having to open it. 

There is less leverage on the axle with these and the motors on 165 hangers match the 180.  They don't stick out and add leverage to the axle

Im getting adapters made now, to add air forced air cooling through the holes that hold the screens.  If u feel a need for more cooling things can be done. Lately I've wanted to take some kryogenic fluid like a co2 canister and blast them half way going up my tam here.  My goals are to be able to ride mountains on these and you're in if you're in

Finally, and I've said it before, mechanical challenges are what is most important for You to think about.  How long is an electric skateboard hub motors supposed to last??? Warranty??? I'm offering solid steel with minimal large parts and the largest bearings.  Ask a machine shop which they'd chose and go with their advice.

Hummies motors on a Rayne Piranha V4 drop through on 10s. They are powerful and it's the first time I had to limit torque on the VESCs ever. Never had so strong motors before and I tested a lot of them! 

 Hummie is talking his motors down from a technical standpoint, which is honest and straight forward. He's not a dishonest sales person I guess. :slight_smile:.

But really, they deliver whatever you need to go uphill fast. Still comfortable to ride due to the thicker urethan.

I can have had a great experience so far. I can't say I even had a fair test of these motors, as during my main test (in which I was able to get one motor to 255 F) was plagued by a loose canbus cable, resulting in the board going from two motors down to one quite frequently.

I can say with confidence, these are not single drive motors, at least dual drive. What has me loving these is the torque. Incredible what you can do with lower kv motors and torque,

thats a putty and too thick.  

the omega 100 sets much quicker than what you wrote and i think youre describing their 201 stuff.      they have different ones.  from now on ill do it for people but still that doesnt help you now.  

get two of the omega 100 small envelops maybe.  but remember it has a quick set time.  its good, thin, high temp stuff though.  put it in the oven at 150f for 10 minutes then mix the two, pour half way in the motor hole and then screw in the axle.   dont get it on the bearings and use tape to make sure.

i dont want to sell these aluminum but i have 40 of them!!!!

they go, and go fast and strong but ...i only want to sell the steel because down the road...yada yada there are a lot of reasons both mechanically and related to power.  the manufacture is pushing for a tiny airgap and with the pressed bearings we can do that and then have magnets that will do 300F!!!

so I'm selling the aluminum sets for 200$ permanently and anyone who gets a set is eligible for the steel set when they come in at 225$.   a gaurantee of sorts that you will have something solid forever.  help me get you these aluminum and then the steel in a year or two!!!
my goal is to not make money at this point just get these to people so we can be going in the same direction.

torque is by far better, top speed is much less. But I can't notice much of a difference in top speed, as the highest I've gotten my carvons is 35 mph, and the highest I usually would cruise at any distance at is around 30 mph, and these max out around 27 on a 12s, so you won't notice much of a difference in top speed. Mostly, you'll notice these motors pick up really well.

With this version, the only problem you'll notice could possibly be heat. And that is only after long distances up hills. For medium to short rides, or flat ground ridding, there's nothing better out there IMO. Even if you get too much heat, you can stop for a few minutes, the heat will go down and you can keep riding. I did a test run with hummie using these riding for around 40 minutes on flat and some hills, and never had an issue with heat. Only time heat was a problem was when I rode uphill for almost 3 miles straight.

Overall, they are solid, and with the option to buy the steel ones (which should eliminate all possible problems with these) for only 225 later, they are a great deal. I'm glad to have a pair of carvons, but I think these will become my main motors when I build a better deck this summer.

I don't know what the top speed was and never get around to recording but the 100 were fast. I liked them a lot.  I shorted them and told neighbor evohyak he can have them and make a four wheeler if he rewinds them.  

This is them. With omega100 on a pealed off lam.  It's not good enough and I'd dip it in something. Just a couple teeth wrapped in wire.  Maybe hose the windings down with something since you're not trained to wind.

I'd think smaller cells would be nicer as long as you don't have to think about disconnections.  My rubber battery I'll be thinking about it!  Maybe smaller cells weigh a bit more for their energy but probably not much. 
Sure evohyak when I finally get around to doing something with my other vescs other than duct tape or Velcro.   I have tubes of this stuff which looks good but I want clear for the lights 
I'm regretting potting the batteries and wish I'd spent my time building the board. I still haven't seen a good board that's also a battery case. Simply a board with cut outs for 18650, and copper tabs or Springs or heat if need be. I'd like to see the board and batteries under me standing on them. An 18mm thick board.  And then pot those cells in the minimum resin possible.

The motors will lengthen the axle by 15mm so if u get one 165 and one 180 Arsenal cast trucks it's easiest.   The Arsenal don't need any further threading and are easy.  
The rubber matches the kegel wheel shape, I'd get them
I use the Paris v2.  One 180 and one 195 and I like how wide they are.  But they do need to be slightly further threaded.  If u want to give me the cost of a truck and the cost of two wheels and 20$ I can get them further threaded and mounted. Or you can do it yourself. 
Shipping is expensive at 50$ but I have a family member coming from Ireland and I bet I could get him to bring the package back. Complicate things but could save you bucks.  You'll need to wait maybe a week anyway while I wait for the rubber and pour it

I feel like I'm going to go with carvons, but I have a few questions.

I'm building a tiny board, 30 in, and range is a big factor. With a carvon single I can get 15-20 miles range and 25-30 mph with the amount of battery that I can fit on the board. If I were to go with your hubs, wouldn't I really need to go with duals to get what I want, and wouldn't that lower my range. Plus, another vesc isn't what my budget needs.

What are the advantages?

Option of getting the steel later!!

You'd need two motors and that could lower your range a bit...but then if you're using a single 140kv or whatever they are now...it takes a lot of amps to get torque and who knows. 

A little board doing those speeds...scary.

Like I said before, I can't imagine the carvon single having the power you want. 2 motors will always be better than 1. It's more money as you need another esc, but there's a huge increase in performance. These guys have more torque than the carvons, due to the lower kv, but the carvons single might get 3 or 4 mph faster. TBH, at those speeds, 1 motor when breaking is scary. Using one motor makes the board want to turn real quick on brake/acceleration. If you don't make the correct weight shifting adjustments, it will throw you off, which has happened to me before. I thought it was bad at 18 mph, I can't imagine single drive braking at higher speeds.

I have both, with and without. Didn't experience much of a difference, highest temp so far was around 70°C after racing for about 15km non-mstop on flat streets. Maybe one should be cautious when going steep uphill for >10km nonstop, but even then, I don't think it's going to cause any troubles. But I will continue testing, also in the Swiss Alps! ;-)

Thats a myth. Single drives do not create strange behavior when braking or accelerating. I rock some pretty big motors on a single and have never had a single issue.

It could just be my set up, but that's what I've experienced. Its not to say, you don't get used to it for the most part. I didn't notice it most of the time, but subconsciously, I was putting a bit more pressure in one direction. There are times when I was thrown off the board when breaking at speed because it jerked a bit ad I didn't shift my weight accordingly. I guess I should say you can overcome the pull. It also be partly be caused by not using a vesc on that setup too. If I hit the throttle too quickly, it definitely pulled harder the truck one way. I feel more comfortable on a dual drive setup though, as there is no pull one way or another.

If I remember correctly your board is a bit of a sky scraper making it very unstable so you very well could be feeling some wobble from a single but it does not effect boards with a more conventional height.

Nah, not my sky scraper (lol, that's what I should have named it. The Sky Scraper...), I'm talking about my original board. It was a santa cruz cruizer board. It did have half inch risers, but was a lot lower the the ground. Honestly, If you've had no issue with pull, I think it might have been the fact I wasn't using a vesc. The acceleration and braking curves are not the best for eboards with the FVT.

@Hummie Maybe you should update the first post in this thread with your current prices for both versions. I think there might be folks out there that are unclear what you're currently offering. If I'm not mistaken, the cost of buying the aluminum ones now, with the option to buy the steel at a discounted price later should be about the same as buying only the steel later, once you get them, right? So this way you end up with two hub sets for the price of one, and don't have to wait for the steel to start riding now.

looking at what other hub motors are out there and their construction  and  cost and gaurentree I feel I'm in a different world. Im gunna do a lifetime warranty for anyone who has the steel.  Best warranty I've seen for hub motors is 14 days return policy.

They're 50 or up,to 55 to Europe.  I recommend 10s or 12s is nicer but if u insist on 6s I have a couple 200kv that would be fast.  The 90kv would be slow on 6s

I haven't mounted the motors to either of those trucks so I can't tell you for sure if u will need to add further threading.  It would be easier if you told me what trucks you want and I could get a single truck and mount them for you

unfortunately I only have a single VESC, so right now I am running a single hub, VESC, and space cell.. For my weight though I think I'll be fine, especially since I'm not running them hard. 

I'll post a pic up later, but I needed a short board to fit in a suitcase, and my little arbor with hubs and a @RunPlayBack enclosure was perfect! It is basically a carbon copy of his first mini single hub board, just on an arbor.

Hard to get an idea of the torque and angle.    If you've ever seen a boosted board go up anything steep, a little steep or very steep, Imagine these motors with me on them getting to the top in half the time.  I'm 155lbs.

From 2 to 8 it's ok.  From there to 25 it's great

so I had to get it to fit in this bag, which requred me to move the rear trucks all the way back on this little board.. Also, on the second hub (since both were glued at the same time) I made sure the motor wires are each insulated from each other before wrapping them around the truck with duct tape.

**I was so thankful I had a @RunPlayBack enclosure though, because without it I'd be toast and boardless in Australia for 5 weeks!!**

anyways, @Hummie I only weigh about 135ish, so the single hub should be able to handle me fine for the 5 weeks I'm down in Australia; after that, it'll be back to the plan of dual and 10s4p. I don't plan on pushing the board hard either, as it will mostly just be used in conjunction with uber and public transportation. This is more so just a mellow sightseeing board that I can cruise around town on. 

I also ran it for about 3-4 miles today, going somewhat fast. Not pushing the acceleration hard, but cruising around 18 I'd say. When I got back, I was able to hold the motor on both sides without getting burned or feeling like I'm getting burned, so I'd say it isn't all that bad. Plus, that distance at that speed won't happen very much while I'm on my trip, because like I said I'm just going to be using it for transportation and sightseeing.. not blowing by bikes in the bike line or climbing any hills. 

Final point.. Someone buy these hubz! everybody be freaking out over this steel issue, but they are torquey as all get out (on a single hub too!) and definitely beat my old enertion 5065 245kv in all around performance. An RSPEC 6355 is still more powerful as a single, but I think these in a dual config would be able to beat that single RSPEC, and probably even the single 6372.

Thanks for the review. I wonder what people are doing with these and hope to hear about it.  running one motor is a huge bummer for me.

Ya I'd be running dual if I had vescs...

I was also planning on taking my phat matson build, but it turned out to be about 4inches to long for my bag, so I needed to litterally make a board in two days, get it tested, and packed. Once again mentioned @RunPlayBack with the save on that clean abs case that was collecting dust. 

When I get back though this will be a sweet dual motor board on my downhill arbor, and I'll definitely be picking up the steel versions down the road because I was genuinely surprised how much I liked the single hub: I guess I was just prejudice towards geared setups because that's what mst people run, and there's all the talk about hubz pulling more amps, having weak torque, etc. 

Haha boy was I wrong though!! I definitely love these little things and would totally want to build a sleeper board one day where it litterally doesn't even look electric.

I'll also make sure to look out for the though Temps.. Giving the single hub frequent breaks too so it can catch it's breath, lol

Thanks @Hummie again for all this!

From FAA:

Spare (uninstalled) lithium ion and lithium metal batteries must be carried in carry-on baggage only. When a carry-on bag is checked at the gate or at planeside, all spare lithium batteries must be removed from the bag and kept with the passenger in the aircraft cabin. The battery terminals must be protected from short circuit.
This covers spare lithium metal and spare rechargeable lithium ion batteries for personal electronics such as cameras, cell phones, laptop computers, tablets, watches, calculators, etc. This also includes external battery chargers (portable rechargers) containing a lithium ion battery. For lithium batteries that are installed in a device (laptop, cell phone, camera, etc.), see the entry for "portable electronic devices, containing batteries" in this chart.
Size limits: Lithium metal (non-rechargeable) batteries are limited to 2 grams of lithium per battery. Lithium ion (rechargeable) batteries are limited to a rating of 100 watt hours (Wh) per battery. These limits allow for nearly all types of lithium batteries used by the average person in their electronic devices. With airline approval, passengers may also carry up to two spare larger lithium ion batteries (101-160 watt hours). This size covers the larger after-market extended-life laptop computer batteries and some larger batteries used in professional audio/visual equipment.
Quantity limits: None for most batteries – but batteries must be for use by the passenger. Batteries carried for further sale or distribution (vendor samples, etc.) are prohibited. There is a limit of two spare batteries per person for the larger lithium ion batteries described above (101-160 watt hours per battery).
Batteries must be protected from damage.
Battery terminals (usually the ends) must be protected from short circuit (i.e., the terminals must not come in contact with other metal). Methods include: leaving the batteries in their retail packaging, covering battery terminals with tape, using a battery case, using a battery sleeve in a camera bag, or putting them snugly in a plastic bag or protective pouch.
See the regulation: 49 CFR 175.10(a)(18)
Tip: Newer lithium ion batteries have the watt hour (Wh) rating marked on them. To calculate watt hours, multiply the battery voltage by the Amp hours (Ah). To learn more about lithium batteries, their restrictions, and how to tell what size they are, go to http://SafeTravel.dot.gov

I've read up a bit on this since I'm flying out to Japan in September. I plan to rig up 2x 160wh batteries for transport and all laws seem to line up with my plan. As for larger 18650 packs, Jason has brought his space cells from Hawaii back to Aus with no problem. A lot of people don't really know what they are or don't care. Not recommended to do, as it's very likely you can get your packs confiscated. @appelton should probably reconsider. I doubt getting caught lying about the wh on your battery will go very well.

Breaking the battery down so the cells aren't over 100 or even 160 watt hours is often possible.  Just pull plugs apart and carry them as separate batteries

It's still up to the airline

@barajabali  I am in the airport now, and have already been through security- waiting on my flight out.. 

the battery went through no problems, I just had it in the original box it came in, and put it through the scanners. Didn't mention anything to them, and they didn't say anything to me- it just passed through like everything else. 

I've also got my board and remote in my checked bag, with a little note telling TSA what it is, so that they don't make assumptions and take my stuff (hopefully)

the vesc's battery and motor current limits are important and really effect the performance!!

In the past I've shown I can go up hills much faster on the 80kv vs 100kv motors but this need not be the case!  I've had my motor current limit at 60 always and with the higher kv motors they need more amps to make the same torque, so if the motor amp limit is increased they will get the same uphill performance.  They will still produce the same heat as with the lower kv and the less amps (thicker windings on the higher kv and less resistance).   the only reason not to up the possible amps to the motor would be if ur concerned about over cooking the motor. If ur concerned u could always drop the number way lower and never think about it...I prefer to get as much power as possible and just be aware of my temp with continuous output and consciously slow down of my own volition instead of being limited to something lower than the peak possible power output

volts are converted to amps by the vesc so running higher voltage will keep the vesc temp down (it does have a safety shut off thankfully), but the motor only sees it as amps...so using 12s will allow u to push the vesc to a higher output but the motor doesn't experience a difference between 6 or 12s assuming it's gearing or kv is appropriate 

If u got motors from me and don't know how to mount them get a small envelope of the omega 100 thermal epoxy and extract half, heat to 150, mix, pour in the hole and screw in the axle, repeat. All the other epoxies are too thick to do this with and not as good

Hi @Hummie, haven't been on here for a while because i was on a trip through Asia. Now i'll finally have some more time to finish up my e-board. I tried coloring the wheels with Rit dye and it worked out great with the wheels you send me, they are now pitch black. Unfortunately my two Orangatang kegels are now a weird dark brownish color (they'd actually matched the orange wheels you send, if i would not have dye'd them lol)... but i'll try to get them a bit darker by dyeing them some more. I will put up some pictures soon!

About the epoxy, i'm looking for the Omega stuff you mentioned in Europe, but i'm not sure which one you mean. Is it one of these two? Then i'll order them and make a video about mounting them :)

I mounted my Hummies last weekend and can share some of my learning: 
Set time of the Omega 100 is pretty short, according to the spec sheet between 6 and 12 minutes. Which is not a lot. It's also somewhat thick. If you heat it up e.g. put the package into hot water, it gets thinner and easier to work with. However, heating it decreases set time even further. 

So my recommendation: 
- do one wheel at a time (prep, mix epoxy, pour, screw in axle), then do the other
- get a good, **really big** screw driver
- don't pour in too much epoxy, if you do, you will not be able to properly screw in the axle 
- you can shim your motors by using speed rings so that the wires come out boardside of the trucks. 
- if you want to make a video, use a tripod or another person as you will be pretty busy already
- turn down the sensitivity of the microphone. The likelihood that you will be using bad language while mounting the motors is pretty high
```

Haha yes even with the 100 stuff it is dangerous.  I'm going to only send them mounted from now on.   I find with the resin heated to 150f, then mixed, I can screw the axle down without a screwdriver. If I'm pretty quick.
Don't forget to prep the axle with a good cleaning of acetone

For what it's worth, I'm going to try lots of red loctite instead of epoxy, and see if that holds. Once I find a suitable, mismatched pair of 165/180mm trucks, or ideally 180/195mm trucks.

What are you all doing for truck selection, and where are you getting them from?

How much epoxy did you pour into the motor, for example, half-way filled?  One-third of the way filled?  For those of us still needing to mount the motors, it'll be good to minimize spillage. :slight_smile:

In other news, I added threads using a die and wrench.  It's pretty easy work, takes a little bit of muscle, but nothing bad at all.

my second wheel was filled probably 1/3 of the way up, and it worked out much better.

@surprisebirthday, how much epoxy? If your axle is properly threaded and goes in all the way you don't need much. Just imagine,  your axle will go in all the way,  then where is the epoxy supposed to go? It will either spill out or your axle is stuck, depending on the cure time of the stuff.  You only need epoxy between the axle and the wall of the hole.  
For my second axle I actually put the epoxy on the axle,  then screwed it in.

Also, I almost screwed up the first go with the faster curing stuff.. I also put too much in the motor hole (about halfway full) and had to use a drill to get the motor all the way on before the apoxy set. This made it spill out a bit, although it isn't horrible. I'll take a pic when I get home.

Hi @Justin, I used Omega 100. I kindly asked hummie to include some of the stuff in my packet as I knew it will be difficult to get in Europe. Sent him some additional money of course. 

You can try and see if this stuff works, maybe do a test before so you don't mess up these nice motors. Just get a M8 bolt or threaded rod and a M8 screw nut. Put the stuff on the bolt, screw it in, let it set, try to get it apart ... 
... all for science - and let us know how it went. 

I'm running blood red front wheels and black hub wheels. We should have swapped our hub wheels.

Loctite!  Luckily if the loctite does give it gives very slowly.  I did tests with it and it will hold the torque of the motor but I don't like the idea of sitting the steel axle on the aluminum threads.  I've heard from a coule engineers that it should be fine though

@elkick Thanks for the confirmation/feedback. Glad to hear I won't be the first Loctite guinea pig. 

@Hummie I wouldn't think there should be any more alum/steel contact with the Loctite compared to epoxy. In both cases, there should be alayer of adhesive material holding the motor/axle in place, aside from where the threads actually touch when the wheels are tightened down, which would be the same in both cases.

Video coming soon!! I just did about an 8-9 mile treck through freshwater and manly beach in Sydney- 

Went down to SkaterHQ (local skate shop) and showed them the board- they all loved it, rode it, and we all talked for about 30-40 minutes about esk8's and the future. They were all onboard with it, and one of them had an evolve carbon AT as well. infact they said they've been trying to organize a group ride because esk8's are getting more popular in the area. 

long story short, the esk8 movement is going well. I also pointed them towards this forum, and showed them some other builds (namely LHB, runplayback, and whitepony- of course a raptor too. 

anyways, some insane video about to drop with Hummie's single hub tearing it up. Not gonna lie I pushed it kinda (really) hard in the end, and it was able to tackle a hella steep hill.

especially then - white socks on a business outfit is a big no no.
Also your right shoe looked kind of damaged at the front - not something you should wear during an internship as well.

But kidding aside this is obviously very superficial and if you are doing a good job (which I am sure you do) nobody cares. 
Did you notice any difference when you only connect one of the two motors for a ride like this?
I would have thought there would be resistance from the unconnected one for example.

 I also have black socks, but aren't going to get them all sweaty while riding if I'm not going anywhere important.

So I throw on my more beat up Sperrys, and a pair of soft socks; I mean the socks even have writing on the top that is clearly visible and not for a work environment. 

Anyways, rant over; as for the motor, I definitely think two motors would be better by a lot. The single was struggling after those huge hills, and I don't even want to know how hot it got. 

Also, the resistance is nothing more than the feeling of a board with bad bearings. It's super insignificant, especially since almost every road I was on was either up or downhill. 

That said, I'm seriously impressed with how well the single is doing. I've carried it up a handful of hills just to give it a break, but it's handled most everything I've thrown at it. Plus, about 1 mile of the road was coblestone, which felt like shot.. Everything held up though so I'm happy

You inspired me to a new idea with your dual drive/single usage: having to motors, two VESCs and only add the second motor when going up- or downhill by pushing a button at the remote.

Second, I want to reiterate that I quickly threw this video together to show what @hummie's single hub was capable of because *no one* else was making videos.

@hummie, page looks great. Simple and easy to understand. No gimmicky "sale pricing!!!" nonsense. I would like to see a 90mm wheel option though. With 90mm wheels I could run a budget 6S setup and still get a solid top speed, maybe 24 mph. Plus it would roll better on the shit roads out here. I don't necessarily need all the power of 12s since there are no hills here in Houston. 

Glad you kept the purple going with the steel. Waiting on @chaka vescs to get my aluminum hubz running, hopefully they are coming soon.

The steel ended up more expensive with the high heat magnets and..steel.  They also have a keyway set under the stator. ...also will likely have 2mm longer stator (like 8 percent more power).

I'll hold off until you get some more trucks in. Let me know when you get them, and put me down for a set. 

And I'm digging the little ventilation plates for the motors. I've been thinking about trying to figure out some truck mounted ducts to force some air through the motors. Here's an extremely rough concept of what I'm talking about, using some leftover plastic. If I had some cad skills and a 3d printer, I'd probably be working on an actual prototype with a universal mount/clamp design. Could potentially be used for any hub motors too.

u can remove the purple anodization form the aluminum parts i read with drano. i forget which drano exactly and im not sure if regular works. if u do a search youll find it. u want to let the parts sit in it and then remove them when the color is gone, but not too long as there will still be a coating of anodization thats clear and will protect the aluminum. dont get it in the windings and maybe only do the bolt-on flange

Because when I destroy a VESC with FOC I am not calling the manufacturer to replace it on warranty. It's my own risk. 

But having seen that so many people blow their DRV chip (whatever the reasons might be), providing warranty on this would mean to finance other peoples hobby with my money and I can't afford that. FOC is still in experimental phase.

@Hummie, first it's battery charge capacity which might be limited, but also to get the heat down for for both, acceleration and braking.  The above settings (only motor tab) are working for me also uphill. It might depend on your specific setup though.

Only theories: some motors are working, some others don't. Also, not resetting the FW to factory values before switching between BLDC/FOC can cause that damage as well. 12s seems to be more often causing  VESC failures in general than lower voltages, since you are close to the limit the VESC can take. Not much margin there.

Benjamin is working on the firmware for BLDC and FOC for both versions V4 and V6, so not much difference. But it might be, that the new DRV for V6 is generally more robust.

Just another thought for hills, hubs and cooling. How about a running a small fan off the BEC, and some kind of small, flexible ducting along the trucks that blows directly into the motors? Maybe even controlled by some kind of thermal switch, so it only kicks on when temps reach a certain point.

 I've got the scoop design made a couple posts back that I still have to pick up and now that my 3D guy is back I can get a different design made I'm more interested in using centrifugal force to expel air. I'm wondering how possible it is to make a small motor do a bigger motors job with enough cooling.  I saw ur scoops a couple back Sean and from what I read those, which would push air in, coupled with what I'm getting made, which will blow the air out, would be the best way to do it.   As it is now I'm getting the design made to just glue on the flange but there's a material out here I can get printed that can sustain high heat and I'd like to get something printed that could replace the flange and serve both purposes.  I'll post them up when I get them going and see the results!

I'm planning on starting my first build and was interested in purchasing some of your motors- are there any options offered other than the $265 dual setup? (different kv, single config, etc.)...

Finally, if you have an estimate on approximate shipping times, I'd appreciate it!

@Hummie Man, sounds like a good time. Wish I could have ridden with you guys. SF is so close to me, yet just far enough away to make it a pita to get down there. What did you think of the GT?

we all switched boards and I rode the gt maybe a mile at different speeds using gt mode solely.  It was nice and the torque from 0 to 5 is different than I'm used to and nice. We raced flats and up hills. ..the last race we did from a standing push up my two block hill and I blew them away.   We didn't do any other formal comparisons. I would much rather have the hubs and vescs!

Well I'm glad you guys have thought about it! I have a feeling that the centrifugal force is gonna be a bit too weak, but as you said you can only know unless someone simulates or tests it. So I would've tested it either way as well. Keep us updated I'm excited about this concept

Yep I get what you wanne say (I'm currently an aircraft/aerodynamics engineering student :p). I solely meant that the oncoming wind might be to strong vs the forward centrifugal force. But the longer I think of it that probably won't be an issue as the main goal is to draw air from inside the motor, and that will happen in any case (and I think that's probably what you wanted to explain). Testing will show the extent of the effectiveness. But as I've said before: great job and very nice idea.

I'm getting simple radial blades made as well as 1/4 turn blades which are similar to what's shown above but instead of 45 degree angles it will be a compete 90 degree. With the 90 degree blades facing backwards the on-coming air pressure will always be attempting to get in the hole at the bottom of the wheel as it spins.  Any spinning wheel is stationary at its lowest point just as it touches the ground.  It is not moving forward into the wind at that point in its revolution and will have the least forward air pressure at that point.

the motor has spaces for small screens on the outside face between the motor and bolt-on flange.  there arent places for screens on the other side but i do want to get them there.  a simple scoop like you did mobutusan would go well with the part im getting made.  im getting one with plain radial blades and another set with a twisted pinwheel blade that finishes 90 degrees from where it started.  all of them will blow air out regardless of the direction its spun.  see which one does best and which direction.
and the big scoop one is done ...i'll tell you how they do in a couple days.

ii think the outflow becomes pushed to a standstill at the very front of the wheel by the 20mph oncoming air but emerges from the top, bottom and behind the wheel.
[/quote]
 the oncoming air, 20 mph, would reduce the amount of air that could exit.  its pushing the other direction.  it would be a counter force against the direction wanted. we will see. i think the 90 degree spun blades sweeping backward will only have openings for the oncoming air at the lowest point in the rotation, and then have no frontal air to force through and so more going out..cooler motors

First half is just some riding footage, but the second has some brief clips of the testing Jason and I did. That said, Jason's vlog in the next day or so will have way more tests (comparing these hubz to Jacob's in each test aswell), tons of data, and temps to go along with it. 

So in a way, this is just a teaser for the real test video on EnertionBoards channel :wink:

I want to test efficiency and hope I can get ginra here to bring his gt out again to compare.  Especially with its touted range yet small battery it's got to be efficient.  Or if anyone else is around.
  I don't have a watt meter wired in so maybe be easiest to ride with my laptop in my hands. 
But to get a fair comparison will take at least a couple
months from me because the motor would have to be wound a lower kv to make it within a speed range the gt can do.  Otherwise hubs are at a disadvantage forced to ride slower than ideal.  Be easier for me to compare against someone who had a pulley board that does 28mph.

I think if you just cruise the flats, range won't be that different. if you are constantly stopping, accelerating, and going up hills, a satellite will for sure win. 

The hubs just draw more amps than a satellite during acceleration and hill climbing, but draw less during normal cruising.

12s3p would likely do it for ya man.. I wouldn't add the extra weight and size of 12 more cells. 

on a 10s3p raptor config with hummie's motors we went 8-10 miles and still had plenty of juice left. 12s would be even more juice, and I'd bet you could get 18+ miles of mixed usage, and 25 of flats cruising.

Mechanically efficient and electrically inefficient. Maybe
[/quote]

think with the right KV value, I dont see why they would be electrically more inefficient than comparable belt drives with the correct KV. in both setups, you need to choose KV wisely, so that ideally motor max rpm is pretty much your desired speed, because motors have their max Efficiency under low load in the 80-90% of max rpm region.

Ohhh i'm digging the black on black, still have to put a mesh underneath the flange on my wheels. 

I'm riding dual vesc's on BLDC-mode, i weight about 90kg / 200 lbs and have to kickpush to start rolling (but the slightest roll is enough for the motors to take over though) and thats the way i like it.
I tried out some small hills and had no problems other than motors getting a little hot, next time i'll bring a infrared temp-gauge to checkout how hot they are getting.

I'm not so sure that it was a fair comparison. The reviewer said that Ollin had configured the Vesc to run perfectly with Jacobs motors. Then he proceeded to run hummies without any mention of settings changes on the vesc. 

In addition, he did not specify the Kv rating. So assuming he was using the same set of batteries for the tests, each motor would perform differently.

Finally, he does mot mention price difference. Jacobs is $400 from australia so shipping will be a nightmare. Hummies is $265 from the US.

What do you think of this design @Hummie ? It would allow for air to be caught and forced into holes to cool the motor when going in both forward and reverse. This is kind of a crappy drawing but my 3d printing design software isn't working at the moment: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/3/357e845f2770f2ab440e2a8af24a22d0fb726309.png" width="666" height="500">

The black curved lines on the inside would be the parts used to force the air into those smaller holes (the lighter blue ones).

@Hummie & @devin
What do you think about this idea? Seems easy enough to 3d print for someone who knows what they're doing. 
Basically, it's a somewhat thin plastic or metal, donut shaped plate that sits outboard of the motor on spacers, to allow airflow between the plate and motor. Cross section shape is a vertically oriented airfoil type shape that's flat on the outside face and convex on the inside face. Theoretically, the air flowing over the curved, convex side should result in a lower pressure area relative to the flat side, and I would also assume, relative to the motor, in the same way an airfoil creates lift. The higher relative pressure and heat inside the motor would be drawn out of the motor to balance the low pressure areas between the inside face of the plate and the motor vent holes, while the air on the outside flows smoothly over the flat side of the plate. I even drew a pretty picture to illustrate my madness.

You guys feeling this concept at all, or am I completely off my nut? :smile:

Both wheels are 83mm. Jacob's motors are a little bigger but the wheels are the same diameter. I think Jacob offers a 90mm wheel option. 

@hummie motors are 90kv although those ones in the video might've been 80kv. @jacobbloy motors are 70kv.

Assuming hummie =83mm/  90kv and jacob=83mm/  70kv that would account for the lower speed from Hummies under the same voltage. 

In addition, hummies stator diameter 57mm vs jacobs 63mm result in lower torque.

Maybe adding some more laminations to hummies design wouls bring it up to par with jacobs torque.

Maybe. You're not capturing inefficiencies such as cogging, hysteresis, current leakage, etc and Hummie's motors have some issues there when under load. The motor heat is a byproduct of inefficiency. 

Most bldc motors are ~70-80% efficient but his might be on the low side of that.

Hi everyone. Pylon flyer!  He's the rubber man and helped a lot getting these made.  If we should figure out what to change..a core for the softer 80duro rubber or some filler towards the hub to hold shape.  I find the 80 will deteriorate and get soft and lose they're tight fit after a while while the 90 is solid but I like the feel of the 80 

 The wheels are 80x56 and if they aren't exactly that then kegels aren't exactly that either.  I'm pretty sure they're that but Shawn used a measuring tool and hard to argue with that. 

 Everyone is into the 3D print part!  Today I should have one done that seems a sure design.  Pretty much copying what's been done be big businesses with lots of research...can't go wrong. 
The versions you guys did..I can send u the 3D file for the flange it should replace and you can make sure it will fit and give it a shot but as I say I've been down the wrong roads a couple times and it's not so intuitive what happens and the best way is to simply spend the bucks (wonder how much that place will cost) and give it a shot.  Anorak from what I'm seeing lately with the centrifugal force and the air going out you want the hole that the air that the air enters and exits through the piece to be the same sq diameter.  Not sure how important it is, and with your design might just convert the strong force to volume as it exits a bigger hole and it's hard to find info
Sean I have no idea how that would work and I if u think it will work I hope you print it and give it a shot.

These are smaller motors than Jacobs.  Depending on where u ride and how u ride maybe get Jacobs if u want more torque.  When I made these I wanted all within the kegel shape and that's what they are.  

These motors being smaller could make more heat, or there smaller size could make it harder to absorb the heat.  Honestly though if u ride them and see you'll find it all depends on how many amps u want to put into them.  Set it to a 30amp limit or something like that and u don't have to worry.  Set it to 70 amps to each motor and then you have an evolve gt eater that just needs to rest after so many blasts up hills

The temperatures never got above 70ºc / 160ºF, when riding normal the temp seems to be hanging around 50ºc / 122ºF. Didn't encounter any problems going up hills, could even keep accelerating half-way going up.

The urethane also reached 50ºc and sometimes started making weird ticking sounds, so i stopped to see what the cause was and didn't hear the sounds running the wheels without any load. Eventually i found out that i was caused by small pebbles getting stuck in the urethane. The Orangatang Kegels i'm running in the front don't seem to have this problem. I think @Hummie send me his first batch of fast curing urethane stuff, so i think the newer wheels with different type of urethane don't have this problem anymore.

Btw. i also did some unpowered boarding with these wheels for the first time today, and they roll buttery smooth!

maybe thats just the effect of warm urethane. when I still raced motorbikes, the tyres would be around 80-90°C and become supersoft and supersticky, gobbling up ANYTHING they'd roll over. :smiley:

thats why I said: maybe its pretty cool to have your own urethane heater. when I carve hard, my flywheels become really warm, measured up to 50°C. and once they are warm, they noticeably grip better and you can push even harder! :heart:

Good to know. Question is for how long did you make the test run ? Maybe try to check the temperature after 30minutes of heavy abuse.

That run was also somewhere between 20 ~ 30 minutes, next time i'll use an app to record the time / distance / speed. Just need to figure out which app to use, so many run / biking apps these days, maybe @jacobbloy could include a runtracker in the VESC-app he's working on, specifically for e-skating :smiley: 

@whitepony, i forgot to measure the temperatures of the Kegels on the front of my board but i image they would be cooler than the motorized ones, so that could definately be the reason why they didn't have and pebbles in them!

Edit: Also, i'm running the earlier 'bluegoo' versions on my board (don't know if that effects the temperature in any way).

@Hummie What's the lowest kv you ever tried on these?
If i calculate max speed for your 90kv hubs:
80mm dia....results in 0,00025132km per revolution [or circumference]
44V [12S] * 90kv = 3960rp/m             *60= 237.600rp/h
circ * rp/h = 59,7km/h = 37,1mp/h
that's a bit fast i think, i have a 85kv hubmotor (80mm wheels) and i would go lower if i could but diy options sometimes are a bit limited.. Just think a motor runs on its max efficency on about 90%of his rpm, still 53km/h, that's not the average speed i ride. Thats why i think our motors get hot and consume much.
Also did you ever try hall sensors? I built some into my new motors but only testet them on the bench, just from the load i gave them with my hands i imagine startup from zero and braking will be much better..

I'll have to find out, or someone find out what the true max speed is on the 80 or 90kv. I don't know.  But I hear u with the lower kv being more efficient but I like the speed.  If I could switch from wye to delta on my remote! 

The hall sensors I don't feel are worth the trouble.   with the vesc on FOC I'm content.  A slight push to get going and a whole lot simpler. And more room in the motor for stator or cooling fins.  Anything at walking speed I can ride quietly and smoothly just have to be gentle on the throttle

Ok,  this is going to be the last thing I post in this thread because I am just sick of all the if this, maybe that.

I am just going to post the exact experience that I had with the motors sent to Me.
Facts:
flat street, (maybe an ever so slight down hill) the same for both tests.
batteries charged to the same voltage for both tests.
same board used for both tests
both tests conducted by pushing full throttle and holding it full for the length of the street
speed measured by GPS app Strava for both tests
same VESC used but motor parameters changed to be appropriate for each motor (this is the only difference in the whole testing procedure)
assumed kv for hummis 80kv
assumed kv for jacobs 70kv

jacobs motors were faster, not by just a little, but at least 10% faster

that's my experience. and I'm not going to bother entertaining anyone else's **excuses** by posting in this thread again.
LowGuido OUT. (mic drop)

@Titoxd10001 Unless you have a hex or square shaped shaft on the truck and hub motor to accept it it you won't have a easily removable motor. Your diagram won't work, if you glue the motor onto that extension then the torque of acceleration and breaking will just loosen the extension piece, same as if you just screwed the motor on.

Oh and the hex shaft idea would be very expensive. Not really the shaft more the cost of broaching a hex into the hub motor. that is $$$

The adapter would be glued on the truck or even welded instead of the motor. The hex keeps the motor from spinning. Just an idea 

Hubs are expensive what is like $400+ for steel. I most worries about the bearings because there is always puddles and as it is now you can't replace them

It is a good idea. Maybe not perfectly ideal where you can always use the truck like a normal truck because you would have to weld/glue on, but 99% of the time people wont care about being able to use the truck normally. Keeps the unit servicable, which is nice and should be where all designs of hubmotors go in the future.

Had an idea somewhat like this except was thinking splines, but a hex would be far easier to machine. Also if you did want to go the route of making the truck usable in normal longboarding situations, you could put in a couple hefty grub screws that would sit just a bit lower than the outside serface of the hex so you can still slide the motors overtop. A screwed on hex extension with two large grub screws that you can really crank down on, would be good and solid.

The guy in the video told us it wasn't the best place for skateboards before we even started.  I really only did three laps and tried to win him over but he wasn't having it.  Funny thing is I know the guy pretty well because we used to race bikes a lot together two years ago.  He doesn't recognize me.  He was super nice to me when I had spandex on back then.   
This speed attempt was on FOC and there's a wind and it's a bit of s rough surface.  I bet I could do 30 on the bldc program and the right day, maybe add some spandex.

I get it now.  Good idea. As it is now, as you know, the big bearing with the hubmotors is trapped unless the motor's glue is cracked loose. It's a big bearing and should last a long time but still it needs to come out.  Ive tested red loctite and it will hold the torque of the motor but is still easy enough to spin off with a two pin spanner wrench that fits in the stator holes and with all steel thats good enough and simpler.   It works. It's easy and cheap.  To have another piece made as you drew I think it would be good, maybe preferable, but I don't want to add the complexity and cost.  Long two pin spanners that fit the holes aren't hard to come by.

Just a thought: 

Have you considered designing two hub caps to create a pressure differential from one side of the hub to the other? 

Based on the designs I have seen, and my understanding of the Bernoulli principle, it  would mean that two hub caps could be designed to work in symmetry. One to increase air pressure - forcing colder air into the hub, and the other on the other side of the hub to decrease air pressure within the hub (pulling warmer air from the hub).
   
@Lizardking0069's photo of a Yuneec motor showed a single impeller on the motor shaft, why not have one on each side of the hub motor?  

I am sure someone could come up with a 3D printed fan design to go on both sides of the hub to increase the efficiency and volume of airflow through the vent holes.

What do you guys think?

So today i finally had enough confidence to go full throttle and did a pretty fast run for 20+ minutes, the outside weather temp was +/- 24ºc and the motors measured up to ~100ºC after the run. The cool thing is that the truck actually works as a heatsink (was to hot to mallgrab the board, lol). But i also want to emphasize that using **heat resistant bonding / epoxy is very important!** (for the guys who mount the wheels them selfs). Top speed maxed out at 41.8km/h using a 10S s.p.a.c.e-cell. Don't think ill ever ride this fast on normal commutes though, but it sure is fun as hell to over take people on racing bikes and scooters haha. Confidence is growing and love my board more and more every ride. Going to order a full face helmet now though, just to be safe :)

I think you just need to give it more throttle then a normal belt drive setup. From riding my own, I noticed they don't like anything below 5amps of power but once you give it that initial start-up power then you should be fine. I'd imagine it's the same with the hub motors you have but not sure haven't tested SteelHubs yet.

From Jacob's youtube videos, he set his Start Up Boost to 0.090 for his hub motors.

 good news!. Tomorrow I'll borrow a camera and I think I'll be able to show you some awesome mountain climbing.      I finally got around to testin the temps of the new steel motors I've been riding. Stunningly cool.  I started with thermometer in hand riding with evohyax with him on the blue goo version and we went up the local hill to see what temps we'd hit.  To see how bad his were.   There are different parts on the motor we took measurements but overall it was something like 175 to 115. He has blue goo but the blue goo were not much hotter than the regular purple.  later after he left I did laps on the same bump at full speed (same one I do in the videos) and hit max 140f before my battery died.  Why is the steel cooler? I don't know They're almost the same motor other than the center is steel, the magnets are less strong but with a smaller airgap.  On a magnet pull calculator they show almost the same though. Less strong closer vs stronger farther away.   My first set of motors that I never successfully rewound after they shorted against the housing also had the same small airgap and I remember them being much cooler. ( I asked them to add a smidgen more airgap for mechanical safety's sake on the big purple batch) .   I have no answers only my trusty thermometer's results and guesses so far today but tomorrow..who cares and I want to go up a mountain!!  And then down!!

Today I was looking at Stary's hub motor...and with each version they 've moved the motor more to the back, outside the urethane. They started with something like this: 

http://www.znjchina.com/d/file/2015-06-21/11f10efd94a0b5e739971c57013bcbb0.jpg

to finally end up with something like this

http://imgur.com/nArQob9

They didn't go all the way like CARVON, but enough to make it look good and get rid of the heat. 

So maybe you could include some of these changes in the next version:

- bigger motor = less heat
- motor moved a little bit outside the urethane = less heat
- proper hubcap that covers motor outside the urethane so it can act as a heatsink delivering the heat to the truck axel
- if the motor is moved outside maybe there will be enough place for putting this fan inside
- bigger urethane 90mm for higher top speed as well as for comfortable riding. When it comes to urethane nobody mentions it here. But, the truth is once you go 90mm there is no going back 83mm :slight_smile:

Looks like he used the chamfer on those orangatang in heat to fit a fan unit. Thats a neat idea. Also, those wheels are 75mm, so I'm nos sure the motor is larger in diameter than hummies.

Heat magically no longer a problem. I'll post a video tonight of seeing what temps I do going up mount Tamaulipas.   If it's the airgap...or magnet size..don't know but my thermometer is back to showing lllllooooowwww numbers.  

Stary...the planetary gear is cool but ultimately I feel the space they're filling with gearing would be better utilized with motor.  The question of what size motors are needed to perform as hub motors with no gearing...feel they could just do that with the amount of complexity and space they use anyway almost.

Well the smaller the air gap means better saturation which means better efficiency and less heat. In RC cars, a correctly geared motor will heat up to a desired temp of 150F. So being around 140 is perfect.

Why would u want to be 150f?  Heat Increases electrical resistance, slightly decreases magnet strength and slowly will deteriorate winding enamel. I've heard of heating batteries for better performance. 
Why .1mm airgap change would have huge consequences I don't know and I almost don't believe my thermometer numbers.  I always equated a motor magnet's pull force (as shown on j and b magnets calculator) as the revealation of its possible performance.   I'm stunned. Happy.  won't put the strain on things the high heat was doing, can go back to 80 duro rubber and not worry about it baking.  No more forced air cooling attempts for me

This is all great news.  I just got the blue goo ones running yesterday.  I'll write-up a build report in a few days, but so far everything seems awesome.  I'm on a 10s3p (space cell) and 80kv motors -- qualitatively, these things have plenty of oomph.  Washington, DC is pretty flat, so I'm not too worried about things over heating.  That said, in my next build, I'd love to try these steel hubs.

@Hummie Is it possible to order slow cure, 80 duro rubber from you?

Yea the 80 duro is on route.  I can send u some by end of this week


Sorry people lately I've been behind sending to!!!  I'm still trying to get this ship sailing and done right.

The steel are all 80 and 90kv. The challenge is selling the last aluminum (same but a couple 200kv) and sell the steel...and have enough money to make the price for the 80 motors I'll have to buy next time.  

Buy the aluminum at the web price and you can later get the steel for 225$.

Haha. Everyone videos are of their shoes. One day I'll finally make a cool first person video with good  sound
Hope ur riding on FOC. For me even with the vesc on 12s and the bldc program it's not nearly as great. 

These are delta wound. But if u were to change them to wye I think it would be hard as the motor wires are converted to a single strand. And there's glue. I find reterminating too frustrating.  If it was motor strands that came all the way out maybe go through strand by strand and that'd be easy. Going in the motor to take apart the glued connections between windings is ridiculously hard I find. 

Damn j wanted to test these up the mountains in the north bay and am on route there now but riding earlier this morning I hit the second low voltage cut off and rode a bit more going it's max speed of maybe 5mph. I had the limit set to 3.5 a cell. I rode around for not even long and also did a downhill( thinking id be charging) get home and every one of my cells is sucked to 2.7 or less and one at .6!  Did riding downhill on the brakes discharge instead of charge?  

I'll be plugging them into other batteries tonight and I'm still thinking a video of me doing something really long and steep will happen.  I'll point the camera up a lot. I'm excited and totally confused and just capable of happiness with the low temps and what I think I'll be able to do.

Haha i was just playing around with the .gif format, making infinite loops. I have some first person riding footage, while commenting and such. But the audio sucks and i hate talking to the cam haha. I'll put up some more vids / compilations this week. I also have an old iphone which i'm going to rig up as a speedometer and try and film my max-speed, maybe go full throttle down a hill, but i want my full-face helmet for that first though haha

I went to a weird RC-racetrack'ish kind of thing yesterday, and let a bunch of my friends try my board. All of them loved it haha (they'll probably be your next customers, lol). Unfortunatly the track is a little to small to go full throttle and have to brake pretty hard for the corners. So i'm looking for a place where i can measure some speed records and try to enprove them.

Alright, I got my VESCs talking to the GUI and trying to get familiar with programming these Hub motors (newbie to this software, but familiar with Arduino etc).  Can John (Hummie) or anyone give me some basic parameters to get going conservatively.  I'm not sure if I should start off with BLDC or just go FOC.  My VESCs have 2.18 Firmware, FYI.

I used Vedder's tutorial to get my VESCs configured with Hummie's motors.  The only thing I did different was to lower my 'Batt max' since I'm using a Space Cell.  It runs like a charm, super smooth and powerful.  You might want to check with Hummie to see if there's any other parameters he changed (I think somewhere else he said he kept the defaults too).  He's been running his much longer than me (less than a week).

Waaay back early in this project John was looking for some help getting the wheels made so I told him I'd help out to get him concentrating on the electronics/hardware.  So I ended up making a mold to pour some sets for John to test.  I ended up making my own set using some nifty neon green pigment (I think it's actually Green-Screen shaded pigment for movie stuff) mixed with a little white for opacity.  They match my other wheels I ran on my single motor board.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/3/3f09fcaa81e061f5d7adf115dd9b076a3da2d955.jpg" width="690" height="388">

From what I hear enertion will be selling hubmotors made by maytech.  The design I'm curious to see as I hear they're identical to what I'm having made. 
I guess the comparison video footage between Jacob's and these will show up with another in the mix.

I've done purple but the kegel purple doesn't look the same and would take doing some experimenting. Maybe there's a machine used for matching paint that could reveal the color combo at the paint store.

Anyone who ordered these within this week or last supplies are almost here and all will be out by the end of the week.

Getting ready to maiden voyage my Hummie-Hubs tonight.  Epoxied the motors on yesterday.  Stupid off-topic question: How do you go about re-centering the throttle position on the Nunchuck? I had programmed mine for an airplane esc over a year ago and needed to calibrate it all the way down to arm (used a rubber band to hold it down and throttle up as normal). Now I have VESCs and I can't get it to re-calibrate center and/or endpoints. Tried the hold C button when turning on but not working. Is there a setting in the GUI as well? I think I got it working once but it reset back to arming only at full back-stick. Thanks!

I had the nunchuck going.    There's a nunchuck program on the vesc and I guess u do it there.  Mine was too dangerous and I should've soldered the connections. 

Enertion's hubmotors will be bigger though.  Supposedly, according to maytech, the design is "exactly the same" and making it now.  But even if it were the exact same design...that's business and really interested to see what he comes up with.  I imagine it will come with fanfare and a beating of both Jacob and myself on video! Haha. If it comes with a single ring closure and all steel construction with 14 groves for the magnets I'll be hoping for conciliatory whisky

 I like the hidden name in the pic above.  The motors are covered in black paint and under it is a layer of chrome and then copper and then The steel.  Looks nice beat up 

Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow I will throw together  batteries and solder and the rest and go up the steepest things I can as long as I can and get it on video with the thermometer. Yeah!  Obstacles and blah blah but tomorrow it'll happen. Been just as bad on the orders lately getting parts please excuse me.  I have trucks galore now and rubber and a to-do book.

We need better über maybe.  Maybe because after the temp test I will show tomorrow it might not be needed and 80 duro stuff maybe be solid. As I said I spent 3 nights ago doing SF hill loops on the .4m. Airgap. Huge difference in temp.

Hey, elaborate on this battery part, please.  That's a 33 inch Hi5ber microdrop deck.  There isn't a ton of space under it for a massive battery, and I want to keep it light-ish, besides.  I'll get a 12s battery, but would a 12s3p or 12s4p not be sufficient?  This is really just intended to be a sleek, portable, commuter with some climbing torque.  I weigh about 160 and I'd like to get high teens mileage, at just casual speeds.  I'm under the impression that the 4 motors will draw around the same amount of power as a 2wd, in total, but just spreads the load out.

after dragging a motor wire lastnight on my favorite fast long straight it cut straight through!  desoldered really.  Ive cut them really short this morning with the vescs right beside the truck.  I think its a safe place for the vescs and the wires are then held away nicely.  vescs touching trucks.  

I will be riding or charging all day.

I'm not trying to derail this thread, but there was discussion above about a removable hub design.

I have a patent-pending universal design that uses hex nut, although the hex nut feature is not the main thing that sets it apart from other motors. I am releasing it soon under the Trillium brand (ridetrillium.com) and will need some help Beta testing if anyone is interested. It actually isn't really aimed at the DIY market (or at least the endless-sphere / eSk8 type crowd) but I think I will make it available to you guys. More on this soon.... I will make a thread at that point,

that board is so beautiful and looks really perfectly shaped. smooth concave, not too crazy, small drop that gives you a cool looked in feel when you place your foot right in front of it ... and probably light as a butterfly. and then 4 hubs wow, I'm really a little envious. the crazy challenge will now be to make an enclosure that lives up to the rest!!

either all belt drive efficiencies were exaggerated or a hub isnt really more efficient. if the weather is ok tomorrow, ill do one round around my favourite lake with max foc speed on my vanguard. thats probably 2km distance, terrain mostly flat, surface pretty good! oh, nvm the lake, there are actually 2 curves that I cant take with max speed. :fearful: guess ill find something else :smile:

might be that people always just read the max values from their gps apps and rarely do max speed measurements over a larger distance as average!

gave it a topspeed run over a distance of 400m straight, slight wind, measured avg speed back and forth in an upright normal riding stance, i.e. I brought the board up to max speed and pressed "record" in both directions once. before the runs I measured the voltage: 40.2V!

avg speed "->": 43.4kph
avg speed "<-": 43.4kph

so pretty consistent, also with all other runs I ever did with my vanguard! also, so far I never felt like there was anything holding this motor back - it always goes straight to top speed and stays there. difference of wind in my back vs. wind in my face for example: nada!

now, off to crunch numbers:
ESC: VESC in **FOC** mode, battery limit 50A, motor limit 70A
Motor: SK3 6374 168KV
Gearing: 16/36T with 15mm belt
Wheels: Flywheels 90mm 75A
Voltage: 40.2V

**Theoretical max speed: 50.9kph @ 6753 motor rpm**
**Average speed: 43.4kph @ 5758 motor rpm**

**= efficiency of 85.2%**

and thats in foc mode that is known to have slightly less top speed, so it compares with your 65% first run. 

I now really wonder where this pretty big gap comes from? in theory my board should be a lot worse: extremely soft big urethane chunks vs. hard slim urethane and a gates gt3 15mm belt vs. nothing! :confused:


btw, I carved home after that test and measured the urethane temperature when I stopped at home with a laser temperature gun: 47°C, ambient temperature 23°C.

So I'm at 72% of the noload and ur at 85% to a similar speed. 
Actually ur big wheels probably have better rolling resistance.  Soft is a good thing as long as it has lots of rebound, especially on a less than smooth surface.  
Other than that your motor is much bigger with a stator of 5374 maybe and mine add up to 4750.  And then the lack of gearing beyond that.  If someone did a test with a similar sized stator without gearing it would be more revealing of the difference between pulley and hub.  But your test does show these little motors are being pushed beyond what they're best at for sure. 
Sadly I've broken 2 escs in 2 days.  One was my old Chaka one on FOC and one of the new ones I just put on from elkick lasted less than 2 charges and that was on bldc!  I think they're "mildly" broken as the Chaka one doesn't show a failure code. 
Didn't have time to do a temp test.  Of course the speed test here didn't kick it up anything other than warm to the touch.   from what I could tell from the short period I was riding the temp takes longer to rise likey partially because of the steel lack decreased thermal conductivity and also maybe the airgap is helping. Have to test more when I can but for shorter hard runs the bell stayed way cooler

you shouldnt compare apples with oranges (bldc vs. foc). to make it comparable, its hub foc 65% vs. belt foc 85% and its pretty much the same topspeed too. if i went BLDC, my top speed would rise for the same voltage and then its probably 92% vs. 72% or so - either way the gap of roughly 20% would probably stay.

got a cycle gps app - when I press start it records distance and speed and when I press stop it tells me max and average. that app was a bit weird though, because the velocity kept "fading in" when I looked at the data. obviously this was bullshit since I hit start when I was at a stationary speed and during the whole run the motor frequency didnt change one bit. my guess is that its some smoothing kalman filter working behind the scenes of that app. I simply checked the speed graph and extracted the last stationary speed, which corresponded pretty much to the max speed (as expected, since my speed simply didnt change in those 400meters). perfectly flat pavement and motor frequency absolutely stable.

thats easy to do when you have 2 guys with the rider going in a circle. where would my fixpoint be when i shoot a video from ego perspective? wont going to happen! also, I really trust gps, so far it has always given me pretty accurate results - I dont know anyone who wouldnt trust a gps distance and speed estimate tbh unless its within the typical gps error of roughly +-12m.

I mean, in the end my 85% just fits what most people have reported so far - I just wanted to make sure that these values were actually correct and not some downhill peak measurements. its in my own interest to be accurate.

on a sidenote: we both base our max theoretical speed on a correct motor kv. did you ever check with vesc live monitor and motor erpm, if your KV value is actually correct?

The differences in kv I don't think are relevant as we are both at max throttle and hitting the same speed.  So as u say FOC to FOC and at the same speed.  So 65 to 85%. The differences between motor size are large, yes I'm in two but they add up to 47x50 stator and urs is much larger.   The best I can hope for is adding more copper and maybe do the femm program to possibly find the magnets aren't as big as they best...and next time the 4747 bit bigger stator.   The real test would be to get motors the same size and one with gearing and one with just a low kv maybe.  There are a lot of different tests possible but this would reveal how the increased load of a hubmotor would be more inefficient.

flying start for me means you cross the start line already with stationary max speed? at least thats how I did it: hit max speed, hit record, hit stop before I had to brake down, gps trace done.

tried to export runtastic data for the last 30minutes, but you cant export from the app, only from the account and it looks like the data that is stored there is very sparse. more like a pointlist for a visual route drawing than high frequency gps trace data. got just these screenshots for now ... or a link to my runtastic events which show the velocity profile at least - not sure if you can access it: https://www.runtastic.com/de/benutzer/si-mi-43/sportaktivitaeten/578b9b70dcd33be81e8153ab (check the last stationary 200m - 43.44kph is actually the smallest value of the bunch of pretty much constant values. a few 0.x kph dont really matter in this anyway. on my way back the plateau is a lot shorter cause I had to overtake a bicycle. in the end only the obvious plateau matters though imo.).

its totally relevant, since you base your max theoretical speed calculation off the KV value and your current measured voltage. let say you think you got 90KV but in fact got 80KV motors - that means your max top speed is actually only 88.9% of what you think it is.

Yea kv is relevant for sure in this test.  But the size of the motors being so different it's not a test that reveals the inefficiency of Hubmotors.  All we've found are the max speeds really.  And how inefficient we are at that speed. For my best results I bet I'd need like a 50kv and then the motor at like 15mph would surely be more efficient.  My motors are pretty small

we can agree on that - in fact to measure the efficiency you'd need the energy you put into the system and the energy you get out of it, i.e. the energy that works against air drag, tire deformation & co.

my experience though is: a motor will just always get to its max speed - low percentage inclines, low percentage downhill, wind in your back, wind in your face - all these things dont seem to make a difference - the motor somehow always reaches its desired rpm, which in my case on 2 boards is pretty much always 85% of the theoretical max speed. ive never experienced a slowing down of the motor because of a small incline or some extra wind thats helping or working against you. 

not sure how to explain it better - its a really weird feeling - like a car that has an electronic speed limit installed (like some german cars at 250kph) -> marching straight to that and then staying there.

the only time when a motor didnt reach this constant rpm was, when my gearing was too large for a 6355 motor, but Im still not sure if the vecs powered down from heat or the motor just didnt make it. once I changed the gearing a little, it also always went to its max speed, which also was about 85% of the max theoretical value.
```

question remains though, why would the current hub motor only reach 65% of its max rpm in foc when all belt drives tend to get to 85% (not sure anymore in which thread quite a few people reported 85ish %)? do you think its under too much load, even with 2 hubs? is the heating up weakening the magnets or causing some significant extra resistance? do you know how much current you draw at top speed? maybe your battery is not strong enough and you have significant voltage sag?

could try 1 vs 2 vs 4 hubs to check if its a load issue
could try an ice cooled motor max speed test to rule heat out (like take it out of fridge with truck attached -> on board and gogogo :grinning: )
could try heavy parallel batteries to rule voltage sag out (you can also make voltage sag visible if you record vesc live data)

torsional torque is "momentum x lever length" (lever = basically rotor radius), so its linearly increasing with diameter? wouldnt that mean that motor A is as strong as 2 motors B with half the diameter of motor A?

probably not that easy, since you can fit more iron and copper into a larger diameter too!

I have two hub motors but they're small and definatey overtaxed with this challenge.  In my mind that's the reason I'm at such a low percent of the no-load.  To get the most efficiency out of such small motors, and still have them be hub motors, best bet would be a much lower kv and top speed.  But I want the speed!  It's a compromise for sure. I'll take small motors with the high kv with high speed burst ability over a big motor that can sustain the power endlessly.   In the future I can make this small size more powerful as there's still at least 2mm longer stator per motor and a lot more copper can be fit into it.   Next time.   All n all though I'm happy with these. The 80 duro rubber on the other hand dies too quickly.   
I could do the 90kv on 6s and see what percent of the no-load is.  With the decreased wind resistance at a max of around 15mph I bet id end up a better percent.

or you could compare 1 vs 2 vs 4 hubs to check if its an (over)load issue. from my experience, 1 vs 2 belt drive 63mm motors didnt make a difference in topspeed (for 45kph). but yea, that could be a diameter thing then. never had a 50mm motor - not sure what they do when you push them to 45kph.

I sometimes get a little stuttering when I'm on the bench too.  If I simulate a kick-push by manually spinning the motor first before hitting the throttle then everything spins up smoothly.  Are you able to replicate that behavior?  

I'm at work now, but I can send a screenshot of my motor config later.  The only thing I did besides the default motor detection was to lower my battery max (gasp!) because I'm using an Enertion Space Cell.

as others say the motors will not ride smoothly and stutter or go to full throttle on the bench.  on the road is no problem.  i think it's just a fact related to current control.  go foc!

foc is better at slow speeds as well.  no stuttering.  i can ride at 2mph silently and smoothly

You're suffering from the calculation bug on "max current ramp step" in the advanced tab. Try setting it to 0.004 before applying "write config" and you're safe. The calculation is 10x higher than it should be, right default value is 0.04.

I am abroad currently not able to insert the fix right now. I think Jacob Bloy is also updating it on vesc.net.au. But to be honest, it might take a few days, that task isn't that easy as it seems. There is a bug free standalone version on github (which I am using when programming the VESCs we are selling). But in the BLDC tool itself still contains the old one in the corresponding directory on github.

To make it short: if you're programming your VESC with ST-Link under Ubuntu you'd be able to use the new version, if going through (ported) BLDC Tool versions on OSX or Win it might take some more time for a fixed version. Until then, please stick with the above suggestion of entering the values 10x lower (= 0.00400) in that field **every time before pressing "write config"**.

I never did this setting it up.  I don't have it plugged in and don't want to undo my nice duct tape and bubble wrap job so I can't confirm what "max current ramp step" I have but I know I never did a change there.   

Whitepony I haven't checked the kv.  Is it the max erpm divided by 7 simply on full throttle while on the live sample?  I'll check that and my ramp step later.
Maybe elkick checked them.   I only ever looked at the resistance and inductance.

How do u record from the vesc so u can later see what youve done in live sampling!  That is something I've been looking for awhile.  With that then we can realllly compare everything

You are right, still working towards the originals (will edit that, mixed the pictures though, these are the first 83mm abec clone tries). Don't wanted to waste too many expensive original Kegel ones. 

Aim: getting the original Kegels to contain an ABS insert fitting to the motors exactly. Needs a lot of tries and error.

now that I've sucked some of you in to get these motors the test is on to see what happens.  You  likely do know these are "experimental"!  Feedback is key.  The forum makes that easy or email or even call.  I think I've very likely ridden these more than all of you and things are looking good
 ....except:

I've had two shorts in the leads, one due to not enough shrink wrap and another from trying to contort the lead repeatedly and a magnet wire became disconnected from the main lead and now needs a soldering surgeon to get in there with a thin bit .  I tried to bend that motor lead too many directions around the hanger trying to figure where i wanted it to go.  Add more shrink wrap and dont try to contort their direction too much


things that have changed with the new steel motors:
they're all steel so no fear of damaging the shaft
a keyway to hold the stator (i fear for the aluminum version with my epoxy to hold them)
no bearing compression due to high heat expanding aluminum
a lot less heat transferred to the rotor's magnets and RUBBER.
not noticeably heavier.
look cool and are cooler than the aluminum but I have to do more testing to really see whats going on 

how are your motors doing?  In my mind as soon as the rubber gets sorted out I'm really happy with their performance.  I want the 80 again and am pouring it again but at higher heats it especially is trash quickly.  I am finding better stuff and I forget what I'm getting now but heat will no longer be an issue and 80 duro!  it's an actual rubber as apposed to polyurethane (which some people say is not really rubber) and it should have very similar qualities to skate polyurethane.  In my calling looking for tech guys at the biggest rubber manufacturers I chanced on one who is a skater and in my explaining the problem while on the phone with him looking at the steelhubs.com website he got excited.    He rounded up the other rubber gurus and we did a conference call.  they liked the challenge and rose to it and can whip something up.  I cant even pronounce it or remember it's accronym 

I'm using just red loctite with the steel no problem so far.

And whenever I get my hands on a set of your steel hubs, I think I'm gonna try a 4wd setup for fun and science.

I've also been using the red loctite (648) stuff and so far its holding up perfect, survived some rough roads and high heat/top speed runs, so i'm sure it will last till i'll eventually jump on over to the steel version :slight_smile:
Currently configuring the small Winning remote and might even try out FOC but i'm too damn anxious to fry my expensive VESC's lol. Currently looking for a board to fuse with an enclosure (glass- or carbon-fibre) to make the whole thing a lot more stealthy.

mobutusan and justin am glad you guys got these and are "on the team"  .  That sounds goofy but I've told so many people that if they get the aluminum and later want to get the steel for 225 I feel we're on the same team.   The point of the team...is so we can we get to the 80 motor minimum order to get the steel made.   that's about 7000$.  75$ each is the cost they've told me and I think it will stay.   The steel are much easier for me to get ready as they have a keyway for the stator so things can be cheaper and a lot less time for me.   And red loctite is good with steel on both sides and that's easy.  Point is things are getting easier, ..better,.. moving forward.. the motivation to get the next thing made keeps me coming back to the lowest prices I can do as i have none saved and trying to build a "team" to get the 80 just like we did with the aluminum before.  

 I'm riding the steel all the time and they're great but we're learning through doing and I always want the next better thing and it will be more powerful and a bit lighter.  same size.
 2mm longer stator, stronger magnets (N48h instead of N45sh..never want to get to 300f anyway! https://www.kjmagnetics.com/specs.asp) that are a bit bigger.
How much stronger will these be and consequently how much cooler..we will see hopefully!!! not to diminish how great the steel are now and I should shut my mouth before things are sold.  I have total faith in the mechanical aspect of these (other than the rubber) and am just trying to get more power out of them now.

bigger stator and stronger magnets is magnetic strength so can have a low kv without relying on using many turns of necessarily thin wire.  Can have thicker wire, which will have less resistance, and therefore less heat, for the same torque.  

the rubber is no good and going to Epdm rubber.  polyurethane will always have problems especially if it's soft duro stuff.  mark my words all those companies selling hub motors..polyurethane deteriorates at heat and all hub motors have heat....unless they're huge and then they arent hub motors but direct drive.  you can add a core, but typically it's a hard polyurethane and that's the same problem.  There's maybe a core material that could work but I'm not going to go on a long goose chase and just go with different rubber.    companies on kickstarter selling polyurethane hub motors...I bet they have amp limits set so low that the performance sucks and yea then maybe you can use polyurethane.  I have yet to see a decent test of any hub motor's rubber.  there's no escaping polyurethanes max temps regardless if its hot or cold pour.  I remember seeing a pic of what was maybe the stary board or onboard..some hub motor company, and it had a max temp printed on the outside of the motor, wish I remember exactly what temp it said but think it said 160 or 180f.  Idont think I would expect the polyurethane to hold up for long staying under either of those limits

trucks get warm.  that's ok.  get an infrared thermometer and keep under 200 really.  the motors are good to higher temps with no damage but the rubber deteriorates. keep an eye on it and I'll see if I can get this better stuff soon.

the glue is high temp epoxy and good for way higher.  I have had it give out on me once when I first did the steel motors because they had lots of cutting oil in them I didn't get out.  When the glue gives it's a slow movement and youre motor wires will get spun slowly around till they unplug.  doesnt spin quickly.  I'm just using red loctite and it hasn't given out.

It's perfectly round, done with a lathe and a milling machine. Need to stress test them though. Currently I'm riding 20km per day, so it won't take too long. But I'm quite confident for both wheel types. 

Still, I think the way you're handling the challenge with the wheels is right - I'm just doing some experiments here. It's too time consuming to manufacture them like this (unless I'd find a more efficient way).

Hummie, keep up the good work!  It will be interesting to see what type of tooling is required for processing the EPDM rubber.  It is indeed high temp stuff and is an interesting option.  You know the fascinating thing about your project journey is when you are using materials and techniques for one application (human powered skateboards) and then adapt them for a new one, it's at that point you find the limitations of what has always just been.  The heat generated from the motors is one of those variables that shows how assumptions in product development are dangerous.  In reality, you are very far along the process and imagine if you had paid thousands in tooling to some skate-wheel company to find the heat generated from hub-motors is too much for standard methods.  I'll be out riding my board some more in the next coming days to check heat, climb performance, and wheel wear.  I'm running 10S and am using the faster cure urethane, FYI.

It's still the same mechanism as used by Hummie, no changes there and it seems to be a tight fit. Getting it to be as round as it should be was the main challenge. I'm  not worried about the temperature, it's not that hot on the can side. We'll see how it performs the next days.

Pylonflyer works at bjb enterprises and is a rubber guru.  Hot pour polyurethane and a hard polyurethane core could possibly work he said as it will have a bit higher temp ability but I'm not going to try that first, first is going to be epdm butI'm really syched for car tire rubber wheels I'm going to try!  That stuff can take anything.  Getting some of each of these made and the mold will be intended for hot pressing so I could try other stuff as well. 

I was looking at onboard or maybe it was stary's site.  They have the same temp issues.  No surprise.  They use n45sh magnets good for 300f and claim to have an air cooling system that is 40% better than not.

I finally got to go for a longer ride over the weekend to get some Data.  Overall I am super impressed with what I see and the Hummie motors were a pleasure to ride.  On the flats there is plenty of speed (for me) and hill climbing was good.  I found that if I carry a little speed into a hill climb they would just keep chugging along at a good clip.  This Data is on 10S so I can't compare to others riding on 12S.  I'll let the video explain the rest...

Nice!  
I think keeping up to at least half speed, where u have more power, keeps u cooler.

But...but I dont do secrets and am getting different motors made. Tell me what u think about this idea as I'm full in and still excited:

Getting very similar motors made, all steel, two fat bearings now instead of one big and one small, same diameter at 80mmmatching kegel 80mm diameter, but twice as long!!!  I can get 3 times as long a stator in there so 150% as powerful with one motor as the two now with a double long.  Why bother making motors if they're all underpowered and u need two at least!  This will make things cheeeep..one motor and one esc.  

I think it's going to look reaaly good somehow with one extra long wheel out the side and the three regulars but those of us who have strong symmetrical needs will ...need to get two or if ur really in that boat four.  I won't bother as at 155lbs with the single I'm sure I'll be good. 

Handling ...surely the one powered wheel won't effect handling but being slightly longer on one side...I'm looking forward to feeling it and really doubt it will be a drawback. 
If these longer motors are your bag tell me and ...being constantly poor need to round up one or two more people interested in spending with me on the prototypes to get made.  
I think one longer hub motor sticking off the side...this will be the cheapest build possible and can still do a drop/drop unobstructed and ride...almost inconspicuous.   Can't wait to see the confusion in bystanders eyes

Ifmotor is made waterproof with epoxy on the steel stator and if also the connections between the windings and the motor leads are fully sealed the motor can run in the water no problem.  Can run under water.  Bearings don't like it though.

Getting better rubber made folks.  If ur riding around pushing ur motors hard the heat isn't good for polyurethane and they will lose their tight fit long before they wear down.  I'm getting the mold done for Epdm rubber and others to try so hold on and stay cool

I know that brushless motor are waterproof by nature as there are no electronics in the inside except if you implement the hall sensor. However dust and particles can get in and ruin everything after a long run. These all adds up together and occasionally need to be cleaned up. It's not a big problem if the motor is detachable for regular maintenance, but if it's locked up with a loctite, then its hard to do maintenance.

Btw is the hub motor you provide can be delivered with a kegel hub wheels? I'd be even more interested if it is.

The cost of sending stuff to u from here is a lot.  Maybe it's cheaper for me to send u the kegels as well but I doubt it. 
I've been riding for a couple hundred miles on a new set of motors, steel, and just opened them up 3 days ago.  Not a scratch to the magnets.  The motors have filtering screens on on side and adding them in the other side is possible too.  The bearings will eventually need replacing but that's doable.  (The smaller one easily the larger more work involved)
With the steel motors being steel I don't feel they NEED to have the bearings fixed with retaining fluid and i could send them without so the motor wouldn't need to be pressed apart for maintainence.  Up to u.  they will rattle a bit similar but less than a regular skate wheel without my fixing-down the bearings.  It's really minor but I like the silence.  U could get ur own retaining fluid

So an @Hummie electric board is about 14.4 times more efficient than a Tesla in terms of miles per kilowatt hour in real world start and stop city riding.

Because @Hummie board weighs **more than 14.4 times less** than a Tesla car! 
Hummie: 90kg incl. Board
Tesla car: 2200 incl. Hummie

What's the math. when finding watt hour are u using nominal voltage?  3.7

How did u get the real world cell voltage including sag?

What is the durometer on your motor wheels?
I'm not sure which one to use on my new motors, 80a/83a Kegels, or some softer 83mm flywheels/evolve wheels? I think you have some experience already there with thin urethane on motors.

Just thought I'd post this hack in case anyone out there wants to experiment with a quick, cheap, cooling duct idea for the aluminum hubs. It's made out of EPDM garage door sealer and zip ties  and is flexible, but stiff enough to hold its shape at some speed. Unfortunately, I don't have the time to do comparative testing to see if this has a noticeable effect, so if anyone else wants to test it, be my guest. FWIW, I can feel a decent amount of air come out of the sides of the hubs by just blowing air into the "duct" area.

Just wanted to share some thoughts, I don't have any hard data yet as I've only been the proud owner of a hummie motor for a few weeks now.  I would like to say that if anyone is on the fence about buying these motors I would highly recommend these over some other hub motors being advertised on this site (not going to name any names) purely due to the amazing customer service and response time.  I was about ready to cut my losses and scrap my project out of frustration and decided on a whim to email hummie for advice.  A week later I had hub motors mounted on my board for a very reasonable price and was calling hummie for help figuring out how to program the vesc.  The following day I was commuting with my board.  I'm amazed at how fast it all went and am really happy with the result.  After riding it around and showing it off for a week, I've been getting lots of questions from people interested in making their own boards, and am pointing them all your way @Hummie

I 100 percent agree. 

I've been riding my dual motor hummie board all this week, and have to say at 40amps a piece on 10s, these things accelerate insanely quick to their top speed of about 24mph.

Absolutely blows my single 63mm belt drive setup outa the water.

I'm on my second pair of hummies wheels. Riding the 80 duro now (was riding 90 duro) and they feel much better over cracks and shitty roads, but I don't except them to hold up as well. But I don't know how they will hold up and I will be tracking my mileage to determine how long they last. Hopefully, they last until the car rubber tires come. But I will be rising no less than 30 miles per week, likely closer to 40.

It's smoother, the tire lasts longer, larger axle length is welcome the faster I go.  I really want to see if one is enough.  I know I'll want to do the local mountains and I'll do two.  On the fence if I think two is safer and better than one but really want to see how it rides single. Simplicity.

The motor will come to the ends of the rubber the same as it does now.  The motor will be just as recessed in the wheel and the motor will still just bolt on the end of a regular skate truck. Bit worried about the extra leverage with the long motor and looked for 10mm trucks but they generally stopped making them as supposedly the 8mm these days are much stronger.   
The huge contact patch.  In my experience which seems the same as caustins ..they are really good at rolling over stuff. 110mm is insane. Maybe it will cone more. Probably. So what. 

I never noticed much if any difference with one powered wheel vs two.  Two of these motors would be like 6 of what I ride now.

Have always prefered bigger wheels for the ride quality, however if wider wheels can compare to my 107's, may just have to hit you up for a set of these badboys.
In the chance that I do, would you set them up on some roja hybrid trucks for me?

@hummie I could just complete the 8mm bore out the other side and slot a keyway into the shaft / hole to prevent the stator from rotating.  Or hell, I could just drill an identical hole (8mm, fine-threaded at the end) on the other side and screw the axles in before fixing them to my back bracket.  The stator tube would be locked in place because it would always tighten against one side or the other depending on rotation.

almost 3x more stator yes, and a lot more magnet and wire this time..  a single goofy asymetric is the goal.  I think it's enough but two for maniacs

  htownbomber what you're doing, which reminds me of others who want to convert it for bike use, sounds like a lot of work.  I dont know and cant advise you on doing what youre saying but if you want to do it..go for it.

I can get these on roja trucks but things are experimental and I havent tried those trucks.  If the axle is well fixed like a typical axle, cast in the hanger or somehow well fixed it shouldn't be a problem.

I find the long wheel smooths things our really well as apposed to a bigger diameter

the car tire rubber should be here in a month.  Nitrile and hydrogenated nitrile.  80 duro.

wow expensive trucks and I dont get a deal on those but if you want me to get you a set at retail and mount one or two motors to them i would.  I imagine the axle is well stuck in there so wont be a problem.
Those are short axles and maybe people are into the symmetry but I'd rather have them stick out and have room under the deck than try to squeeze motors with shorter axles..  No higher deck wanted so they will go on either paris 195 or 180 or a combination and thats the extent of concessions I want to make for wheel symmetry.  But as I say if you want to do smaller trucks I can do them really.

180mm plus a dual setup of your new motors at 110mm would be 400mm in total width, that is 100mm wider than my setup with 107mm abecs on them. That is way too wide for me. 350mm in width with the 129mm hangers would still even be really wide, but a little more livable. 

How will you do a single set up if your not worried about symmetry? An extra 50mm sticking out one side would drive me nuts!  

Still can't wrap my head around 110mm wide wheels. Just seems crazy too me! The power capabilities sounds wonderful though!

i was just looking at it again and just putting a tire beside the motor on my board and its pretty wacky looking no doubt. funny because it still doesn't look electric just weird.  but how will it handle and perform solo?  I'm excited to find out.  

actually I'm in the last moments in the back and forth with the manufacturer brotherhobby and they keep doing the drawing wrong with the skate axle going way deep inside, much longer than a skate axle normally could go.  I was thinking of doing it deep and somehow having the skate hanger cut.  How hard is it?  I know a lot of people have done it for adding a pulley that holds an extra be.  but structurally I don't think it would make a difference and theres always going to be the same leveraged at the end of the motor on an 8mm hanger.  which will probably be fine.  but if I cut it and had it more recessed it'd be less distance.  I've never ridden such a huge span from wheel to end of wheel but I'm open to it, but at this last moment i can still get them to make the hole deeper and then I'd cut down the hanger aluminum to expose a longer axle on one side.  What you think?  it'd be more than an aesthetic concession and really the handling would be more normal for sure.  one long 50mm span on one side might be weird or it might be really nice. ccould cut the hanger down...40mm.  I'm liking that idea more and more.  as long as it won't hit the board, but then it might start at that point.  has to fit my board dropped thru and let me turn with the trucks as loose as can be.

For a single set up it would be ideal to shave down one side of the hanger and make it symmetrical, when something sticks out that far from normal you just know your going to catch it on something....and it looks goofy. From what I have read it is not hard on most trucks to do. For someone doing a dual setup it would be easier to just get a narrower truck and save the mods.

What about just keeping the design you have the same but making the inner threads go way deeper? This way if you wanted to use it as a single you could modify one side of the truck hanger and make some more threads on the axle, and if someone wanted to do a dual set up they could just get a narrower hanger and use the very same motor design, their axle would just not use all the extra internal threads.

it would be nice to have it optional but then you'd have to cut threads on the axle 50mm down if you wanted to recess it into a lot of threads.  
it has to be one or the other.  then again this is just this 8 motors and could change it. 
how hard is it to cut down the hanger?  if it's easy to do then I'll do that but it can't be too easy.   If only it's easy.

Yea, maybe easier to just have specific motors for dual or single.

Someone who has actually done it may be able to answer you better on how easy it is. From what I remember you can press the axle out, cut the hanger and than press the axle back in, but this requires a press of some sort, or you can put it in a lathe and tool the aluminum down. What I would do without a machine shop at my disposal is hack saw a nice straight cut through the cast aluminum all the way around the inner axle being carful not to cut the axle, than take a pair of vicegrips or put in a vice and twist the excess off, apply heat if necassary. In my head it would work....

No more polyurethane and the nitrile car tires are a good fit!   These things will last and do up to 275f no problem.  Smells good like new sneaks.  Also the long motor rubber is here already and u can see the size.

It's really just the heat that kills them though I think.

A couple of days trying them and then I'll order a bunch in 80 duro. 10$ each for u likely as long as this stuff is good...the hydrogenated is more expensive

  90mm on those small motors would be too taxing.  Whenu kill those motors since u helped me from the beginning I'll give u one or two of the biggie motors cheap as I can.  Ultimately all those aluminum with their small only shielded  bearings and the high heat epoxy and the retaining fluid will all be a pain down the road. People are going to want to replace bearings and they won't be able to do it themselves without a couple hundred in tools. The high heat epoxy is crazy strong and it needs to be cracked to get to the big bearing which are only shielded.  The new big motors are 1144 steel and are strong enough to be a slide fit for the bearings and people can replace parts themselves, and the all steel allows just loctite to hold the motors on and that's much easier to unscrew and get to the big bearing when you need to.   Sealed much big bearings. Motors u can go anywhere and not worry about heat. Rubber that doesn't deteriorate with heat.  Steps toward an indestructible monster that's easily serviceable

Been researching hub motors quite a bit and @Hummie's motors are looking great.  

Couple questions... Alum version vs steel ones?  The steel ones are tighter airgap and don't get as warm?  Any other benefits there?  

I won't have time to build anything in the next couple weeks, think it would be good to wait to see how the next long wheel turns out first?  (As well as the new rubber?) Might only need one long wheel and one vesc to get better performance then the two small hubs?

It looks like your motor KV are pretty well matched with 12s batteries?  I haven't used a vesc yet, but that looks like it is at the top end of its capabilities, has anyone had issues there?

Thanks!

Well, they are more durable, less likely to deform.
Also, they have a better fit for the bearings.

It will be no Problem, as they have low kv. they stay far away from the dangerous ERPM Zone.

```
the nitrile is super sticky and good...except what is stated as 80 duro seemed much harder for about ten minutes in the hands and has now settled at maybe 75 and then when it gets hot it drops all the way down to maybe 70 and I rolled a tire twice when I heated it up a lot.   the good news is I ordered us all 85 and 90 duro in this stuff and 80 and 85 duro hydrogenated (high heat), for both motors.   But Im more excited that I've tracked down some really good high heat, hot pour polyurethane I'm getting samples of and will pour that too and it's on the way.  This stuff is top notch and although the nitrile is good I know it doesnt have the rebound of polyurethane and that equates to greater range on a charge and more durability and syched to be pouring that stuff.  

 @evoheyax beats motors up more than anyone I've encountered with his weight and extremely hilly long commute and after replacing all the bearings with full ceramics after he cooked the lube out of the steel, we found it's definitely nice to have it all slide fittings so we can get the bearings off and on without exotic tools and that's what the new motors will be.   With (2) two-pin spanner wrenches found on amazon we'll be able to access everything to replace bearings or windings or whatever.


the big motos should be here in about a week!!.   they had trouble making magnets that are 70x3mm and they kept breaking

@hummie Do you have a link for a cheap spanner wrench that you like on Amazon? I'm not sure which one to get, but I need to open up one of my motors. The red Loctite I used on the axle threads let loose while I was riding and the wires got twisted and pulled out a little bit. One seems to still work fine and one just stutters now.

sorry to hear.  especially sorry to hear because I'd rather use red loctite.  Had you covered the threads and cranked it down?  I use red now with no problem so far.  Rather not use the crazy strong two-part high-heat epoxy because its too strong.

 it's very likely fixable.  Worse is if one of the wires is shorting to another through the center piece but that's likley not whats happened and you just need to make a better connection again.  

To get the older motors apart you need to press them apart.  you also need the wrench.  I dont have the details on what size pins you need on that wrench now as I'm at work,  dont have a measuring tape handy, but you'll need an adjustable two-pin spanner or wrench and it has to have pins that are maybe 3mm max diameter.   Measure the size of the holes on the threaded ring on the inside and thats what youll need to get into, but like I say those motors are also glued shut after you get that ring off and you'll need a press.  I have one and you can bring it by and I'll do it all.   you'll likely need to resolder the lead to the winding though with a fine tip solder iron which I dont have.

Thanks for the info. Ok try to get them apart, but I may end up having to bring them down to you. I just have no idea when. And I'm not sure why the loctite came undone, but the hubs were moneyed onto a Randall II truck, and maybe they didn't have long enough axles or enough thread engagement or something. It sure looked like there was a lot of loctite still on the threads and axles, but I'll try more next time.

Probably because they're aluminum and steel holds better.  

Ive just been loctiting the steel..  The other glue I used to use I think we estimated at 200 foot pounds of torque to get them off. A motor I forget but maybe will do teens. 

The wires though are thin and aluminum. Crappy. Read that fat wires a good heatsink. Next time they're supposed to be 12gauge copper. I'm liking a fat wire coming out and turning into a heatsink!  U can get the same electrical resistance I thin in a copper sheet as a wire. If that's true why not have thin sheeting at least.  Thermally conductive insulator there. That's doable.

Just an update on my ducted cooling hack, while it did seem to work, it did collect and route debris into the motors along with extra cooling air. Got a little crunchy in there, so I scrapped the idea. I'll try something else down the line that has the intake ducts at the nose, so it pulls clean air and ducts it back to the motors or esc's.

Try keeping the same ducts but using thermal epoxy to gluea radially finned heatsink onto the cap. Youll block the holes but increase the heat transfer dissipation area significantly.

i only have the aluminum now.  i have to get a couple more of the regular smaller steel motors in the future because they already made them.   the improvements going forward forgetting those few I'll have to get are bigger motors obviously.  almost 3x as big or long.  both bearings are now big.  and sealed not just shielded.  and there's two types of steel in the future, 1144 for the center shaft and 1018 for the rotor.  what the bearings are sitting on is much stronger than a standard skate axle.   and bigger copper multistrand silicone wires.  it was going to be 100% magnet fill but they couldnt do it, it's hard to get 70mmx3mm magnets in there, so they're working on doing it the 80% fill as before.  that's been the hold-up...trying to get magnets in.  it'll happen.

I'm going to leave it all tight slide fittings so you if you get (2) two-pin wrenches for maybe 20$ each you can open everything up and replace anything.

**I'll testify that the Aluminum Hub motors are great for all around boarding.  I have one of the original sets (dual motors) from Hummie and I ride it daily around the neighborhood to exercise my dog.  I'm running 10S and it has the power to go up decent grade hills and have never had a heat issue.  I usually cruise at about 15mph with top speed at around 23mph when my dog is spazzing out when we first go.  Love the power, the braking, and the silent/stealth quietness over my old belt driven board.  I'm running 2 VESCs from Enertion FOC at 60 amp motor peak.  Test run video showing temps around various terrain.  Oh, and I have original urethane tires of the "fast cure" urethane with no sign of wear, fyi.  I have since built proper enclosures.**

Yea the 85 hydrogenated is likely best.  just got it so have only been riding the 80duro regular sample I got earlier so far.  When things warm up they get softer too. 
The high heat hot pour polyurethane stuff sounds really promising. Hot pour Polyurethane is the best rubber available. It takes a bit more work and set-up to do the hot pour and no die but I'll get it going this weekend.  Syched they're allowing me to get it.  Two kinds I have. Write me and I'll send u stuff.

i have two more of the first 8 prototype long motors available as someone backed out.  

300$ for the motor mounted and a pair of Paris V2 and an extra tire.

it took a shockingly long time to finish the details for these but finally they are being made now.  the good news is the center threaded hole in the motor will have 25mm of threading, so I'll put the hangers on the lathe and further thread the axle and the motors will recessed further along the axle.  the motors will sit 18mm further inside than the rest of the wheels.  so sticking out 18mm to the inside and 101-56-18=..so.27mm to the outside.    more centered and more surface for the motor to be adhered to the axle

12 gauge copper silicone motor leads sticking upward toward the board only.  screens on both sides of the motor.

Some questions about the new hubs. How narrow of a profile do you think will be possible with two of them? It'd be awesome if it could extend no longer than 10 inches. From what I read earlier, it seems like the hubs are removable, is that correct? For example, would replacing a hub with a wheel be possible to go single-drive?

Lastly, do you think the current requirements will be higher on these motors (e.g., will it be minimum 60A/motor)?

The new motors will be in my hands in likely 3 days!   Stuck on vacation in la when I could be back riding.  

Anyway I'll definitely figure the max continuous wattage on these and will likely be 150% roughly of what the small pair we're (which was never tested).

By the profile I think you mean width. With both motors on one truck I'm not sure.  The design allows me to mount them far along the axle but with two that would be a lot of hp and little hanger left if I put them far along trying to get narrow.  If you want to see what's possible I can do it squeezed far along and you can tell me how it goes. I don't know

Resplacing a hub with a wheel...possible but work removing the motor and then you'd likely have to add spacers (speed rings maybe) to where the hanger aluminum had been cut back as I just wrote about above. Or don't have it cut back and go extra wide and replace easier

Looking forward to see how these work out. I realize that two of these monsters would be ludicrous, but that just sounds like a whole lot of fun to me. :) 

I also think that having a decent single hub is quite alluring. So I'm thinking maybe a good approach is to have two hangars: one for ludicrous mode, and the other for the single hub. 

As for the minimum current question, I was asking because I can only get 75A discharge on my upcoming battery. I'm hoping that should be sufficient for the dual setup.

Highest amp draw possible on two? hopefully u can tell me what you do.  On the small motors I did 50
max but I found the 70/70 bat/motor setting on vesc enough for me. With two I'd like to know what 0-20 time you can do on the telemetry iPhone bit

with hub motor's simplicity and these attaching to any threaded 5/16 shaft I think these open up possibilities!  The power to transport a human or more is there at a fraction of the weight and cost of a rediculous combustion vehicle.   how to best utilize the power of two or four hub motors? You could stand on it but you'd be missing out.  I'd rather be in a bucket seat inches from the ground. I fantasize about what quickness and speeds could happen with 4 or 6 on something maybe as simple as a super long deck laid on and some handles to hold on. Hopefully can calculate based on performance of 2.  Street luging at rocket speed wouldn't mix with cars though.  Something else. More control.  More upright. I'm sure it could be made a million ways but I don't have one

 I typically ride 2 of the small motors and rarely have ridden 4, a new single long motor should be roughly equivalent to 3.  Will see what my 0-20 mph time is with the telemetry app in a couple days.  But I never  pushed the vesc beyond 70/70 settings which I could've done for more torque as well and makes a big difference.  Depends how many amps are put to it more than anything

Wow TL;DR

@Hummie, your work is amazing! 

Do you have any video showing the performance of your latest version or it is still under development? I've been looking for acceleration videos from a dead stop with hub motors for a while with no results

Are your motors going to be used on the Raptor 2?

Are you going to work on a hub motor version in the future with interchangeable wheels like Carvon design or they have a pattent?

The first two motors will be here tomorrow or the next day!  I have sensors that I can install to see the performance from 0.  Anyone who wants to meet up this week and compare to their pulley drive or just try it hit me up.  These are not enertion motors but I'm looking forward to comparisons with them as well.  

I'll be testing the crap out of these this time:
Continuous amp max
Draw at 25mph

The tires come off easily.   Are more easily replaced than any other hub motors I've seen.  Carevon are likely as easy from the look of it.  They're 80mm now and I'll make some 90mm

In the very near future, I will be upgrading to 4 of the big motors at hopefully at 115 kv. This will give me top speeds in the mid 30's and I should be able to climb just about any hill. Hills tests will come.

Currently on the old motors with 4wd, the steepest hill I've climbed was 22% grade with li-ion. I've been running lipos lately, so I' sure I could climb even steeper, since the li-ion sag from 4.2 down to 3.6 on 22% hills.

Guys very cool design and very innovative. You can mount these trucks in a lathe and machine down the aluminum so the wheel sits further in the truck. 

As far as the one wheel drive ive done it with other motors and the board acts funny...it will basically thrust of center so it feels like the board wants to turn kn its own during heavy braking or acceleration. 

The dual setup is the way to go in my opinion with trucks shaft shaved down. 



NICE WORK.

 with the long regular wheel there would be a long expanse without the axle support and it might not work.   it would have to be a lot of overhang with a thin core.  

I really like the orangutang wheels anyway and since I'm always doing front wheel drive the longer wheels are out of the way.  true it will look weird but so it is.  performance.

Just another opinion. I also agree that equal sized front wheels would be awesome. How about selling the motor without the stator windings and magnets so its just the core + bearings + barrel to which we attach the same urethane wheels over? I think there'd be a market for that and it would even out front + rear grip issues and create some awesome looking symmetrical builds while offsetting cost and weight of some 4wd setups (if that would be overkill with these motors).

Also, how does the motor lock onto the axle and prevent the torque from winding it loose?

Thatd be very diy.  I'd like to get them that way myself. 

@Pylonflyer those wheels stacked as in the picture looks like a great long wheel.  If the axle were long enough.  But I rode today and I like it as is!   I want to get back to a parking lot later tonight to try again after I loosen the trucks.  The wide single wheel was different to ride and added to the difficulty turning but it was good!  I only had the motor amps set to 70 and battery 40 so it had little punch and I'll up it to 140/50 and see if I notice torque steering.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/e/0e00b5b78e719a9ec3a5fda96eea365ddd803d9c.JPG" width="375" height="500">

you could do that and I know a lot of people want the symmetry.  Especially with the single long motor and 3 other regular sized wheels it's strange looking but it works and when you're riding and you're used to it ..it more than works.   
But I had my vesc set to do pretty low power and tomorrow I'll crank it up to real power and see how it handles and if there's torque steering occurring. 

43 battery amp limit and 191 motor amp limit will get me to 1500 watts with 0.04 ohm resistance of the windings, and the 9s pack 35 volts.   will see how that does within 12 hours.

penny board at 30mph is too much/   maybe a longboard with the head or tail cut tightly to the side and some narrow trucks.   Could be done but I like it like this so far.    loosened the trucks and put some real power in tomorrow and then decide.

Wondering if your manufacturer would sell the core+bearings without stator/magnets/etc for the non-hub wheels to balance out a bit.  That plus @lowGuido excellent observation of penny-like trucks might help bring this all together.

the flinstone's car would be great if it turned.  Maybe that steering wheel is attached to a foot.

@caustin using the motor parts to make regular wheels would be expensive and weigh a lot.  

Doing as lowguido shows for two motors is a great solution if the deck isn't too low as to cause wheelbite.  If running just one motor you could mount it further along the axle than I've done, closer to the center with a standard wider truck and have equal stick-out.    I'm limited with my drop deck with a drop-thru though.

its funny seeing how people have such different ideas for these than I do.  I like my one wheel drive with 80mm kegel road wheels.   why not 4x4?

yup, I suspect the 2 motors coming my way will suffice to start with.  Interested to hear how @evoheyax or others go with 4/AWD.

just wanted to say I kicked the vesc up to 140/40 motor/battery amps and didn't feel any torque steering with full throttle!
   It also seems now that I loosened the trucks it can turn probably just as tight as with the narrower trucks.  I'm very happy with one motor and a standard vesc so far. 

this is from yesterday going on low power and tight trucks but circles are always fun.

when I was a kid I wanted those gas motors and rc planes but never had the bucks and later more so wanted to make a 3/4 scale World War one bi or tri wing replica you can fly.    Make it in your garage and take off from the local soccer field to cuba.  Only 80 yard take off and landing room needed.   More appealing to me than making a human lifting drone.   OO the control-line plane...on a string...doing circles...I get you now. 


Lately I've been feeling older and riding on just 9s and pretty happy doing maybe 25 max.    But I'll have a new deck going with 12s shortly and I also want to see what speed I can hit and compare to the past speed.

a huge improvement was finally listening to devin and cranking my motor amps up to 200 on the vesc.  I'm really ecstatic with the new motor and the vesc at 200 motor limit.  smoother, quieter, less cogging, even throttle, and full power from lowest speeds.  I recommend trying it...although Ive only ridden maybe 2 hours without anything blowing up I think it'll be fine.

Maybe it is not about the 200amp limit just about the ratio between battery/motor/total amp (even ratio)? It would be nice if you can test it with the proper ratio at 100amp? I would be very interessted!!!

yes as you say and the ratio is very important for the smooth throttle at least and there's the math somewhere to figure the ratio but luckily for me it was done for me.  if you just crank up to 200 motor amps and dont do the ratio at least at slow speeds you will have more power regardless of the battery number.  a high battery number giving you more power at higher speeds.  the low speed punch makes the slower speed riding much more fun and I'm not afraid of traffic as much with it.  
I wonder if it's maybe more inefficient, although I dont really care and will gladly take the better performance, but with more amps being pumped through at less than 100percent duty cycle.  (100percent duty cycle being on full time) . putting it up to 200motor amps is increasing the power that is being used at less than 100percent duty cycle when the esc is less efficient (and I heard also the motor) but these inefficiencies are pretty small.

  between riding and fixing broken things and this and that laziness I dont get much testing done.  More so riding comes first and then fixing in that order and it's always the receiver or the canbus.  but found my iphone and my logging chip and will be at it. things move slow.

I have some sensors I was planning to add and try but now more than ever I dont feel its worth it.  another part to break and complexity when its pretty damn good already.

ooh, that's more then I expected. But I guess that long wheel thingy is giving alot bigger punch when pushing the throttle. But I seem to be safe: 3380W is below my 12s80A=4kW limit (even at 3.5V/cell (which I tend to set as my soft cutoff on the VESC), I get a 3360W, so I still get full power at the lower limit). Thanks for the explanation :p. I think alot of times people overlook the max current their batteries can output.

what do you think caused it?  I'll hold my thoughts till I hear yours.  luckily it happened with just a slight thud while I was on the smoothest surface, a rollerskating ring and I wasn't going fast. it was straight and unbent.

id cut the hanger back maybe 1/3 an inch with a dremel further revealing the axle.    To finally get it off I wrenched on the 1/3" bit cracking it off the rest of the hanger aluminum but I don't think that force was that much.

other than the truck was scared of the asymetric setup I would say it's a material problem of the axle. can not imagine the forces got too strong.

When you doubled the width of the motor leverage on the axle you reduced the ability of the stud to handle the added load by half. 

F=MA.... BASIC PHYSICS

you need a stronger axle like stainless steel or a diameter increase on the axle.


On my vette like 6 yrs ago i kept pumping out more power out of the engine. One day i  a spirited 1st to 2nd shift on a 4l60e automatic transmission i sheared the tranny output shaft just like that. Almost 2" of sloid hardened steel gave out when the output power exceeded 420lb ft of torque. I'll look for the pics and post them. I remember showing my physics professor and asking if the shaft was defective, he looked at me like my brain was defective.

WOW.... sorry but there nothing spectacular with ONLY 1660W (most of esk8 setup are around 3000W, you will know if you build one), also the baking point wasn't a moving part.... So the problem is mostly cause by the length of the assembly... LEVERAGE B****H

From the pattern formed we can say that is fatigue related, not abruptly, but if its way to much power or material failure i don't know

@Hummie whats the length of the motor?

```
The surface looks plane, so it doesn't seem to be torsional fracture caused by the motor.
Overload breakage usually creates a much rougher surface so it can't be that either. 
My guess is slowly spread fatigue fracture caused by surface defects (due to the dremel) combined with a oscillating force, for example riding on a rough surface or nocircular  wheels which would also explain why the progression lines are almost horizontally.

Well... If you think abouth it... except if you had modify the hanger, you've only had 1/3 of lenght of your motor holding to the truck.. so your problem come from Leverage....

probably for the best to find out now instead of later.  too much leverage seems the obvious reason and in fact all the hub motors out there are putting more leverage on a standard 8m axle. 
in the future gunna squeeze a 30mm stator in the small motors instead of the 25 it was, which is just doable, and change the bearing to the same big one that was in the long motor...and call it done.

two motors especially with the vesc traction control really was a better performer anyway.  no slipping on wet or loose ground and with the sharpest turns never ended up with no power while the motor is off the ground.  
tried and tested and FAILED!  
the few who already bought these long motors from me...how bout the bigger short pair instead...cost wise it didn't make much sense in the end to do the biggie motor either actually; the 2 motors cost even a bit less than the single big.  Or I can send it back.
anyway i don't think there's an assured solution.  a stronger axle is harder to come by I think and a lot of work to even see if it would suffice and that's just a test with unsure results again.  stainless is weaker than a standard axle I believe, more brittle, and ti would also be more brittle I think.  
might have to settle for second place:cry:  ooo wait ..no ..I'll still be the fastest:grin:.

the goal of more power...continuous power...that was the real goal with the big motor...the quest is back to limiting it to the small span of the kegel wheel.   bit bigger and will fine tune the  air cooling....and blast a co2 canister into the motor when doing mountains.

except it's the same situation with the enertion motors and there's more leverage along the long span.  curious to see how they will hold up as with an 8mm axle the standard steel is pretty ideal as is.

There's five types of failure theories in Mechanics of Materials class,  one is maximum shear stress,  maximum distortion energy,  von misses stress,  normal stress and mohrs  circle.. Materials have different properties that allow one material to be more brittle or ductile or just stronger then the other. 
Depending on what the material is results in the type of crack or destruction it has. For example a rod is used for tranferring torque from one location to another. The way it would break if it was be used for torque transfer would be like this:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/1/51cba2281dd3a6b58b09578ac8dbe6ce36febfcf.jpg" width="534" height="500">
Shear fracture. Just like cutting a piece of paper with scissors. Would look like this.

Another would be used for materials being stretched as in cable wires for bridges or beams. 
They would fracture from necking or buckling.

Since this wasn't a case of transferring torque from the hub to the axle, IMHO it would be shear stress.
Can you show a picture of what the axle/truck side looks like? So far we only see a "bolt"? inside the hub motor unless thats the axle.

If the stator is repelling the rotor then that would mean the axle is being compressed?

How is it torque? The axle is being pushed forward by the wheels rotating.The axle is on a rotating bearing....... I would understand if you said bending stress, but torque would mean if the axle or truck wasnt bolted to the the deck and you held the wheel in air with your hands then what your saying would be that the truck would start rotating, but its the outer bearing that rotates.

If I am not mistaken there is a bearing on the hub motor, similar to regular wheels. The nut presses against a washer against a bearing against another washer and then into the truck wall (the perpendicular surface to the axle surface).

I am sure the same concept is in the hub motor. 
Nut, washer, bearing, washer, truck wall.

**Please, can you draw a free body diagram for this torque you say is exerted on the shaft? That would help a lot.**

Would have to agree with devin here, it seems to me to be quite obvious that this is the result of using a dremel tool on the axle.
Experiment, put a solid steel bar in a vice, put a small groove around the shaft with a dremel disc, and than put a snipe on the steel bar and apply force across the length of the bar...guess where it will break. Especially if it is high carbon steel. Ever see high carbon metal sheets brake in half like a cracker with a line scored into it? This is what devin was referencing about glass....I think. 
Basically what this long motor is doing is acting like the snipe on the end of the solid steel bar, compound this with the snipe(motor) being butted up against an immovable object(cast part of axle), and the snipe not being able to move either, now you have a a pulling force being applied to the weak spot when ever the snipe(motor) moves up. Repeat this action thousands of times in small amounts with every rock, crack, uneven surface, etc that this motor would have seen, and you get the result we are all looking at.
Apply twisting force and it simply adds another source of fatigue.

I agree with this analysis, particularly the effect of the hanger butted right up to the steel stator tube. Much of steel's strength lies in its elastic modulus; the ability of steel to bend elastically and spring back into place in response to stress. Your Rojas Hybrids do this. In this case, the axle had no room to move and the combined shear/torque forces were translated to a single location along the axial plane. Shear and torque forces were introduced, there was no "give" along the steel axle and the stator tube ultimately sheared the axle at its weakest point.

To visualize this, think about a metal screw; you can bend it with a hammer / pliers but typically you can't break it without cutting tools. The exception is when you drive it completely into a piece of metal or wood and keep on torquing (or hit it with a hammer for that matter.) It'll eventually shear at the only spot it can still deform, right at the head.

theres many different alloys with either but regardless, after snapping the axle like I did, and having a really hard time trying to find anyone who's done the same while normally skating, and since I'm not going to do rocket science testing to figure what exactly happened...just gunna keep to the smaller motors.  people can post and think about it till their head explodes but without real testing no one knows and I'd rather be safe/
  
it's surprising it happened because a lever is twice as strong if it's twice as long.  these motors made the lever maybe 2.5 times as long and I assumed that a normal skate axle not being used for extreme tricks and stuff could handle that.

if on the other side of the hanger the wheel was longer it would add to the load on the axle with the motor on it.    I think it's easiest to imagine the forces exerted when riding down a hill with a slightly concave surface like a tube as that's the situation where the leverage happens and that situation happens.  a longer wheel on either side will add to the stress on both axles.

i don't want to be saying things over and over and you posting and saying the same thing over and over. 
the ground is not always smooth and forces are put on the farthest edge of a wheel.  when that happens the leverage is increased.  there are three points of leverage,  where it touches the baseplate in the center and wherever the two wheels are touching.

I think you do have a different lever effect in the marked circle by changing the wheel size:

if you go to endless sphere and search devin you'll find that the current is smoothed out by inductors and you don't have moments of huge torque during low duty cycle with the pwm.  i've told you this many times as you've told me this many times.   I'll cut and paste for you here two people who design and sell electric motors confirming this on es.

 "With the 10% duty cycle, you won't have 100 amps for ON portion or the cycle and 0 amps for the OFF portion. Instead you'll see something like 8 amps ramping up to 12 amps during the ON portion,and that 12 amps gradually ramps down to 8 amps during the OFF portion. On average it stays pretty close to 10 amps, and will have basically the same heat generation as if it was a steady 10 amps at 100% duty. "

"the motor winding inductance filters the current into a fairly smooth value. The huge current pulses are from the capacitor bank through the FETs."

don't know if those were bent from use or came with a bit of that already. looks like they're bent from use and you wouldn't want to ride those.
 I've seen some trucks come with a bit of a bend on purpose, most come bent as a result of the casted aluminum around it, and it's not desirable.  I guess if I wanted to use trucks like that then all the force would be put on a shorter lever but that would only last till the wheel wore down.  I'm sure the performance would suck

That's why I though you needed to dremel the truck to make more room for the motor to go on. If that's not the case then just buy any precision trucks and try again. If getting custom then add stainless axles or titanium may as well go the whole hog if going custom if not set of calibers and don't dremal just leave as is.

I could try a 8mm ti axle, it might be better, it might solve the problem, it might not.  paris trucks have a lifetime warranty on the axle.  steel can be better than ti as the graph above shows.  

I dremeled it 8mm just to make them even from the center.  with the old smaller motor pairs 180 trucks worked for this paired with a 195mm.
stainless is weaker generally.
it needs a bigger axle.
I don't want to go on a long quest really as the cost of the long motors is a lot already and really the 2 smaller are damn nice to begin with.  two motors handles better especially with the traction control on the vesc.  I can stick more in the small motors and be happy

the little motors have a lot of potential still and are not optimized.  far from it.  you can look at the less than possible copper content, the extra room where the stator could be, and room for a second fat bearing.  get those done and with two motors... a cheap performer.

I'm pretty sure stainless steel is stronger than regular grade truck steel and stronger than titanium for sure titanium is just like half the weight. Stainless 17-4 is found in some precision trucks claiming to be indestructible. I think your axle failed so early because the Dremel made it weaker but it would have failed eventually because all the leverage and all the force especially from braking with only one motor. I hate to say it but I think onloop has the right solution going with two hub motors to share load with a custom hanger which looks like it has a spot that takes the load away from the axles. That said I would not buy hub motors because how inefficient they are lol.

"It is a common misconception that stainless steel is stronger than regular steel. In fact, due to their low carbon content, many stainless steel alloys cannot be hardened through heat treatment. Therefore, when compared to regular steel, the stainless alloys used in bolts are slightly stronger than an un-hardened (grade 2) steel but significantly weaker than hardened steel "

I didn't want to get myself involved in the conversation. But Devin, even though I'm sure you mean it well, your way of arguing and pushing your unscientific opinion is really tiresome and a bit frustrating. Not to mention your often faulty arguments used

As a mechanical engineer with a plethora of courses in material structural sciences I suspect:

* This is as far as I can tell in no way whatsoever a torsional failure. Torsional failures do often not occur in one plane (as happened here). The dremel incisions could however have induced a torsional failure in one plane (together with the clamping behind the incisions of the axle) but then the failure would induce microvoids in the center as depicted in figure 1, and not fault lines like here...
* The parallel fault lines indicate a bending fracture. This could indeed be because of the fact that the longer motor induces an adequate extra leverage on the axle. But the main reason is FATIGUE. Steel itself is plenty strong to cope with the slightly larger leverage induced by the setup. Fatigue however made the crack propagate until the point of uncontrolled propagation. The incisions of the dremel were already deeper than the max stable depth that a crack can propagate, beyond that depth a crack propagates uncontrollably and fails eg. BREAKS
* Devin is however right about the fact that the dremel incisions have played a large role in the fracture itself. In any fatigue induced fracture: giving the axle a place to initiate the fatigue (as small as the initiated cut may seem), plays a big role in the decrease of the fatigue resistance. Not only this cut, but the fact that the clamping face of the axle is right behind the cut, explains why the fracture occured in a smooth plane almost flush with the rest of the truck. Not to mention the continuous and large varying bending forces that are present.

bending + leverage + fatigue + crack initiation = failure

Can I say that the failure would not have occured if the cracks weren't present? I don't know. But I do know it's a margin too thin to count on, by that I mean: there should be a structural improvement made to make sure this doesn't happen again.

But in no way whatsoever was this a failure due to torsion.

Oh: and let's not rule out you might have a bad batch of trucks. Don't always count to religiously on the quality of manufactured items.

Can we now move on to thinking of ways to fix the problem and the more fun things.

Again: Devin, don't be mad at me :p I mean it well, but I just had to correct you there.

Dries

I don't think trucks like caliber and Paris come with hardened steel stronger than stainless. Just by cutting threads in stainless steel by hand I have to put all my body weight and all my strength into it and with "normal" Steel I can do it with one hand no problem. I know these are not be the same forces but just as example. But I think you should be looking into a custom hanger not a stronger axle or somewhere in-between your small hubs and this large hub

@devin, your hand-drawn picture in post 1227 is certainly flawed. 
A longer motor definitely creates a larger lever and more force on the axle. 

@hummie, don't give up!!!!

Your large motors looks great and would be a good alternative to what is around elsewhere. 

Btw I also think that dremeling was one of the main issues here, but for other reasons than devin mentioned. 
Your dremeling probably created a surface on the hanger that was not 100% perpendicular to the axle.  
Then the motor with the large lever was allowed to wiggle up and down while riding which probably caused the axle to break due to fatigue. 

So the ideal hanger for your motor 
a) would be very thick in diameter in order to have a large contact area with your motor
b) would be machined to have a nice and perfectly plane area
c) in order for the hanger to be machined, the axle needs to be removable

no idea if such a hanger exists.

Why make it complicated and calculate wattage?

@hummie had motors, they were attached to hangers and the axles didn't brake. 

Then hummie made longer motors, dremeled the hanger and one axle broke. 
1) we have a lot of people with dremeled hangers, I haven't heard of a broken axle (I have dremeled hangers and haven't broken an axle). 

2) longer motors create more force

So if hummie wants to continue with his larger motors, how can the force on the axle be reduced? 
=> larger and very plane contact area where hanger meets motor

I think that is why he thinks torque must be the problem here. usually you have belt drive systems where the wheel sits on bearings and the axle only has to withstand gravity. With a hub motor the stator core actually needs to stay in place. So the axle does need to withstand that additional torque exerted by the motor.
Personally however I doubt that this indeed has anything to do with torque and believe this is just like @3sly and you said.

In the end it's probably a mix of factors that led to the failure. 

We are also not 100% sure which component took the torsional force? Was it purely the axle because the motor was epoxied in? Maybe the motor not even touching the hanger? Difficult to tell by the pictures, enven though they were posted multiple times. 
Then we need a design where the torsional forces are taken by the hanger not purely by the axle.

I agree - something like the DIY clamp with some screws you can mount the motor to should already help for both torsion and leverage/bending (and should fix this stupid epoxy usage - although props to the epoxy if this was actually torsional :smiley:).

In fact after looking into this a little I am now convinced that torsion had in fact nothing to do with this. It were surface defects (probably caused by dremel) and a resulting fatigue fracture (especially with the sort of vibrations we get on skateboard wheels). Does that sound right @3sly?

@devin This has to stop man... I'm very close to closing this thread its just filling with useless crap/spam now. 

Its very simple. No matter the root cause of failure. Hummie needs to rework his design and somehow make it more robust by improving the mounting mechanism design  / motor concept. Otherwise it will remain unreliable and unsafe.

Standard skate trucks probably won't be relaible long term, but if you insist on using them my advice is to completely isolate the axle from all loads.

* The parallel fault lines indicate a bending fracture. This could indeed be because of the fact that the longer motor induces an adequate extra leverage on the axle. But the main reason is FATIGUE. Steel itself is plenty strong to cope with the slightly larger leverage induced by the setup. Fatigue however made the crack propagate until the point of uncontrolled propagation. The incisions of the dremel were already deeper than the max stable depth that a crack can propagate, beyond that depth a crack propagates uncontrollably and fails eg. BREAKS

I just learned about crack propagation in SAPOEM. :slight_smile: Got the question wrong on the final however :sweat: .Still got what I needed for my A :slight_smile:

How much wider is the single Hummie Hub-Motor compared to the [CARVON "Hub-Motor"](http://www.carvonskates.com/store/p4/CarvON_V2.5_Single_Hub_Motor__%C2%A0Front_Truck___Wheels_Set_%28Raw_Edition%29.html)?

As far as I know there weren't any issues with the CARVONs, maybe Hummie could mount them the same way and give it another shot.

I'll mount the other one i have and see.  but I will cut back 8mm of the hanger because it makes it equidistant and I'll be sure not to touch the axle with the dremel this time.

I've been fishing for thoughts and @mmaner wrote to me that maybe there should be a gap between the motor and mount.  Counter intuitive maybe but it would give room for flexing of the steel is the theory.   Maybe I'll add a tiny hard rubber washer in between.

I'm just guessing, as I haven't seen the manner of construction.  It makes sense that spreading the stress across a longer surface should lessen the possibility of stress cracks/fractures in the substrate.

Wow, I just read this entire thread. My eyes hurt. But anyways, I believe I want to try the 2 hub version with my nickel board trucks. How much would the 2 motors cost? I'm in the US and may even be close enough to pick up. Please let me know if you think it's a bad idea. I'm really new to this. I'm smallish and light and would be doing mostly stop and go city commuting. I like the smaller form factor.

Since these are still in development and they are freaking huge I'd recommend getting some more reasonably sized hubs if that's what you're going for. I believe 2 motors would give you waaaay more power than you need.

Yeah but I'm just saying these are likely more expensive and capable of way more power than they need. Doesn't hurt to have to headroom but I think in @Sapphirinia's case it's not nessecary to have such big motors.

So either way, do you think my idea is a good one? Or at least doable? I really want small form factor, I figured hub motors help that. Use my own penny (nickel) board trucks, and wheels. Replace the back 1 or 2 with the hubs, and file down the hub to make it the same size as the other wheels. I like the color scheme and smaller more portable is more important to me. Or maybe somewhere in the right direction for the hub motors if he doesn't make them anymore. I got nervous about the whole truck breaking thing and one wide wheel doesn't seem like the best idea for me.

The solution to me is to optimize the smaller motors. I was just reading a post that mentioned motors below 100 kv, the copper is too thin, and causes a lot of heat buildup and losses.

He might be able to fit a bigger stator in there also, and the bearing choice. There's ways to optimize the small motors. I'm still planning on a 4wd with the smaller motors complete. Just need to work out a deal with a VESC supplier.

Too much power is not the problem though IMO. I think the real problem is that 16 AWG wire is being used in a high amp situation. 16 AWG wire is not meant for high current motors like what we need. I'm temped to rewind my 4wd motors to a high kv with a ticker gauge wire to see how it compares in heat. Or to get 4 new motors winded this way.

Would you buy a VESC and build a board and do videos with data logging where you prove that you need and use more than 200 amps. In that case I could change the software for you. But first I want to see a video of **your** longboard where you use the already existing 200 amps for at least a second.

That doesn't count. It needs to be your board that you build and with a data logging video. I recommend my or @evoheyax app. 
And btw I think he didn't even touch the 200 amps.

But only you need those settings. But OK, just for the interest and entertainment present us a video where the 200 amps are used for at least a second with a single drive.
