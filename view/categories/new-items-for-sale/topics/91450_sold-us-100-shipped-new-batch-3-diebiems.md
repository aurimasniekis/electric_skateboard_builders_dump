<b> UPDATE: Both units are sold. </b><br>
I bought two from the current batch of DieBieMS from @Samau18.  Unfortunately I am not going to be able to put them to use anytime soon.  These were just delivered today, and I am just looking to get my money back.  I will sell them for $100 each.  Price include shipping in the US. Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
