It‚Äôs not clear what trucks they are throwing in grizzly, polar who knows? Surely won‚Äôt be long enough for dual unless mounted yingyan. Maybe the @dickyho V1s would work dunno..oh and the cheapo hobbyking may work

I search for bear mount and the word custom is popping up a lot. I guess using the parts from this mystery box would pretty much make an esk8 time machine all the way back to 2015 whooosh

Mystery Boxes will include two Landyachtz decks (1 long, 1 short), one set of trucks, one set of wheels, two pieces of clothing, a pair of gloves, random swag, plus some other surprises. The contents will be a mystery but you‚Äôll receive a couple classic Landyachtz decks from past season, as well as a set of Bear trucks and some Hawgs wheels!

Nope. The shippings fee is added to the value.
5‚Ç¨ item +20‚Ç¨ shippings can be taxed because it's above 22‚Ç¨ 
The minimum we pay is 30‚Ç¨
That case scenario happens often

How they are able to sell without VAT in the EU I don't know.
And that's why they have some killer prices in some items, or probably fat margins.

Btw is there any thread here for this?

When pintails were mentioned my heart sank...
I will let you know whichever way the cookie crumbles.
When they say shortboards, that's the mini cruisers right or do they do trick decks?

You should always pay taxes. The only thing that changes is whether you pay them at the post office or at the seller.

A pintail is an unlucky possibility but unlikely to get 4 of them! cruisers and mini cruisers, some DH/FR, AFAIK no trick decks. Did they remove the long deck/short deck statement? No such thing as a short(mini) pintail

You ordered early, so probably already packed up. If there would have been a dinghy in there or a downhill deck, I would have been happy. But with 2 wheel sets and the new shipping it's not worth it for me imo. Maybe I'll check out the Bustin boards one, seems like a good deal to me.

They are essentially a surfboard on wheels, they are tall and usually heavy with poor clearance for larger wheels,the tail is useless for kick tail maneuvers etc

I'm sure they have their merits which I either don't know about or am too unskilled to work with and I do have one, a Sector 9 which even has a W concave but has convinced me I don't want any more

This is my favorite cruising/ carving board I've ever ridden. I own roughly 25 unpowered completes and have ridden countless more.

I think you'd find that the structure relies on the top and bottom sheet being intact for strength.
The triple beam, now that is another thing altogether..

Mmmm you would be right, the bottom layer provides a lot of the strength.

It would be an idea if anyone was motivated enough to route out the gaps then make a CF or FG removable layer screwed back on to the underside to give back that strength, you're up @Grozniy

No worries, If you have a drill press you can make easy work of it.

Clamp a couple of bearings on the base plate, slide one side of the hanger into the bearings and the other side into the drill chuck (put lots of tape on the threads in the chuck).  Make sure everything is good and straight, then turn on the drill.  Make any adjustments you need to, then grab thick gloves and a file.

Work the hanger lightly with the file until you get it to rough shape, then use heavy grit sandpaper folded up over itself until its an inch wide, wrap the part of the hanger you filed, and turn on the drill again.  Move the sand paper up and down until its all smooth and shiny and round.

Measure a lot and in multiple places.  Use a sharpie to mark where you need to sand, then measure again.  If you slow and careful you can get a perfectly round hanger in whatever diameter you need.

Its essentially a cheap mans lathe.

Team LY Jersey - $25
Zebra sliding gloves - $29

Fun fact, the triple beam uses Tulip tree wood (also known as a poplar tree but it‚Äôs nit a true poplar)  flowers much like a magnolia tree üå∏  hence the name, in Latin Liriodendron tulipifera. 

Native Americans know it as a canoe tree for obvious reasons, it grows around the Mississippi so I think ü§î @mmaner and a triple beam will unite at some point

Or maybe @treenutter needs to make a methadone treatment of a triple beam I wean him off this opium

I would take a tack with them that it‚Äôs imposible for them to expect the postage they want much like you the decks you want

Otherwise just pay them but ask for some nice non-pintail decks?

I‚Äôm seeing a lot of value in these boxes so far

Or like Brent says (but fuck him) split a box my way

If they don't ship it then in some time call them and say I'm super busy but I made time for this short call I haven't received my box please work this out I don't want trouble

I decided to buy one of the mystery boxes. I just bought an electric skateboard and figured that I should also acquire a manual version for experience before I kill myself (I'm a little new to skateboarding). So these are the boards that were found in my box. I had ordered on the 7th and it arrived yesterday (12th) here the South Bay Area. Pictures are a little blurry; sorry about that.

This isn't the official Landyachtz mystery box but a collab from Landyachtz with a eu skate shop, but I think it is appropriate to post it here. So here it is:

I'm pretty happy with the content, not the best value but I got a mini cruiser complete so I got what I wanted:
* Pugboat 179 euros
* Landyachtz lunch bag thing
* surf shorts
* stickers
* landyachtz hat

The box was 150 euros excl shipping so it is decent

I think during the holiday season it makes sense to get these delivered to someone in the US and then get them to put some shitty wrapping over the top and send it as a gift. No customs charges and none of the extra shipping, it would work out way less expensive

What about glass frit? Using a finer grain should give you better visibility of the artwork, and maybe just use the grittier parts where your feet will be? It can help preserve the art too :D

Opened mine, got that stripe penny board like everyone else. (With mini trucks and wheels, nice little tiny board) And this deck. It's super comfortable, but I don't know which one it is.

Sweet, I think I'll electrify it with the "swappable battery and 90mm hub motor" thing from diyeboard. Wanna keep it light an pushable.

Edit: so I read the bottom of the board, it says top speed 34. I might be slightly retarded today.

I am putting the Raptor Hubs I got for secret santa on it! 

Cool thing is I can mall grab the thing yet it still has a good and wide stance.


I am hoping the @psychotiller knuckles or stealth enclosure will fit well.  And rock 11s3p

I am incredibly excited about this project!  It will be my Xmas build!

Yup it's a mini .it called the mini gin and tonic 27.5 or 28 and 8 inch wide its probably one of the bigger models. they have multiple sizes of the dingy..I think they start with a 24 inch mini strips to the mini pug boat is the biggest being 29 inch I think there is a pizza board that is really fat like 10 inch wide ..so many models of the dingy . I wanted to do a turbo dingy it's basically I bit smaller then mine but couldn't stretch the wheel base out enough to 15 inch for the enclosure to fit

I was gonna use my TB12s4p on it but the enclosure is too narrow and half of the mounting points end up in the hollow areas. I may have to think of a different solution or different enclosure.

I didn't, I just have a temp enclosure on it right now anyways.  I used a 10s4p double stack but I'm going to build a flat pack for more clearance.  A @psychotiller alter wedge is perfect, you just have to cut off about half of the phase wire guide.

Haven't skated in 18 years, but just tried it on the carpet and I still have a nice Ollie!

I didn't really want to start a new thread about this, and Google brings up a whole lotta nothing, but does anyone know anything about the Green Tree deck? There's a complete for sale locally for $70 and it looks like it might be a good alternative to an EVO, as it seems to have the angled tip and tail. I can't find dimensions or construction/flex/plys details, so if anyone has any info, it would be much appreciated. Thanks!

@Moon, you are the man! :metal: Thanks for the info. I'm on it. Missed the mystery box deal, but this should make up for it.

@yelnats8j I appreciate the response anyway. Got an email to the seller, so I'll update when/if I get my hands on it.

Super stoked right meow! Aside from some scraped corners and a few scratches, this thing has been barely used. $70 for this complete is a very satisfying alternative to the mystery box. Now I don't feel so bad for missing out. Funny how the universe works. And thanks again @Moon & @yelnats8j for replying so quick. Love this forum. :hugs:

Get @Sender to work some magic on that thing.

He will make it a beauty

I don't know yet. I didn't have plans to build another board, and didn't think I'd actually be able to get my hands on an EVO anytime soon, but I'll definitely clean it up and electrify it with parts on hand. I'd love to @sender it to Tim, but I'm supposed to be tempering my spending this year, which is so incredibly hard to do. This would be worth it though. :smiling_imp:
