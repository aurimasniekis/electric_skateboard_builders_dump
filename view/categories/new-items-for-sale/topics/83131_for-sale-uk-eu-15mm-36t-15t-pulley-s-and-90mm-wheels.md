Just some feedback on these wheels and pulley set up's that I just received. 

I'm very impressed with the quality of both the wheels and the machining of the pulleys 

Using the industry standard finger nail durometer test I’d say that they definitely feel softer than my 84a Zombie hawgs and just as soft as my 78a OJ hot juice III’s so happy days.

For the price I'd say these abec clones are brilliant
