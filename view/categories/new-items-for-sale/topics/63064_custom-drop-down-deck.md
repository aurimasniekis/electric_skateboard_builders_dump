I have a brand new blank deck that I was going to use for my build but since I had to do the yin yang rear mounting I thought the motors would end up hitting the drop of in the deck.

So I would like to do a custom deck for someone on here.  The deck is 8plys of American Hard Rock Maple that comes from Wisconsin.  The deck is 10 x 40.5 it does narrow at the center to about 9".  The wheelbase of this deck is 31.5".  So with this deck I will do any design that someone would want on the deck.  I woodburn all of my designs by hand so each deck I do is 100% one of a kind.  The deck with come gripped using my glass frit grip much like @longhairedboy uses as grip on his deck. Use the glass frit makes the graphic on the top of the deck look crystal clear. Looking like this
