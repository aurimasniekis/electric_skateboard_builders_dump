I have a few extra pulley kits for sale.  I ordered some samples from China and got a few extra to spread the high costs of shipping.

The 15mm kit allows for maximum torque transfer without belt slippage.

Kit includes:
- 36T Drive Wheel Pulley designed for Flywheel Style Longboard Wheels
- 15T Motor Pulley with 8mm bore for motor shaft and Four Set Screws for maximum security
- Retainer/washer for bolts
- 255mm long belt
- 265mm long belt
- x6 M6 Allen Head Screws

$36 USD shipped to USA or Canada with regular post (i.e. no tracking as it's coming from Canada and tracking is too expensive for such a small item). Send me a PM if you're interested.

I'm in Vancouver Canada, but can ship to US. Will look into International later today hopefully.

Truck modification depends on your trucks and motor mount setup. With calibers I was able to get the 15mm wide pulley on there with slight modification to the trucks. Had to remove a tiny bit of material so the motor mount could slide further towards the center of the trucks.

Shipping is going to be an extra $15USD to Australia. Similar rates probably apply to other international countries.  This is without tracking and probably will take at least 2 weeks.

I'd watch out shipping those with no tracking number man. Definitely not safe for you as a seller, buyer just has to claim they didn't receive the product and you have no proof.

Thanks for the advice, but to ship with tracking it is almost $25 USD, so it's not really going to work for anyone. I'm just trying to pass on some extra parts at a cheap price for the community here. I've dealt with a lot of people on here and everyone has been trustworthy so far.  I would sincerely hope we don't have people lurking on here to looking to scam $34...

Either way the financial risk is pretty small for both parties involved, so I'll chance it and trust in the community

Cool. Np. 83mm Flywheel style wheels are the standard around here

You can buy the legit abec ones, or the clones on ebay amazon for cheap. I just went with clones myself and they are working fine.  I think I got a set off ebay for maybe $25?

It's not a problem.  It will just cost more and be slower to ship.  I've found when I send things international it can take 2-5 weeks.  Another $10-15 for shipping should cover it I think. Let me know if you're interested.

Thanks for the interest guys.  PM's replied to.  Now to make this sustainable for me to keep doing, I'm going to have to raise prices slightly.  The first batch was smaller and sort of an experiment, so I was only making a few bucks on each set after shipping costs.  Now that the product has been proven and tested by numerous individuals on the forum, I'm going to have to raise prices to $40 USD which is still very reasonable in my opinion.

Thanks for understanding guys.  Those who I've got PMs with can still get in at the old price. Anyone else going forward is at $40.

Discussed heavily in my other thread. They stole my photos and don't sell the same product. So you will not get what I am selling. You will get a 12T motor pulley and some other garbage.  Others have purchased and have regretted it.

DO NOT BUY THE EBAY KITS!!! Unless they come from Jon in Vancouver. 
To go into greater detail as to what you'll get from China...
They are completely useless. 35T & 11T instead of 36T & 15T pulleys. Two 250 MM belts instead of one 255 and one 265. (Can anyone even use a 250?)
Grub screws are way too small for the motor pulley. They drop right through the hole. It's a total waste of time. Also, many people seem to have trouble getting all 6 screws through the wheel pulley and the wheel. The alignment is off in most cases. 

Waiting on my Johnny versions. Should be here any day now!

Can confirm that @demayod is correct about the ebay pulleys. They totally suck don't buy it from there. I also recieved a 11t pulley and a wheel pulley that doesn't even fit. The hole is too narrow for caliber hangers, and the alignment of the screws is all off. Totally useless, getting a refund.

I planning on getting the ripba trucks and dual mounts. I have the kegel 80mm.

Would these fit my planned set up? I think i can fit up to dual 6365's on @psychotiller's dual ripba trucks and mounts? If so I would like to get 2 from ya if they are still around!

@JLabs so i am doing dual 6365 motors on a 200mm ripba tuck/mount from @psychotiller.

Do i just need 2 of these and then the 14-15 mm one for the motors (1 each of course)?

Is there anything else I need for my drive train here?

Thanks everyone!

Yep! With a dual setup you need 2 motor pulleys, 2 wheel pulleys for Kegels and 2 belts :smile:

If you have any other questions you can PM me, so we don’t clog up this thread.

[quote="johnny_261, post:63, topic:17131, full:true"]
Yes, I just got another batch in actually! They don’t fit Kegal, I believe they will fit MBS as they look like they have the flywheel style core, but I haven’t tried them personally so can’t confirm 100%.
[/quote]

I just got my set of the 36T pulleys and apparently they don't fit trampa stickies or MBS all terrain. The screws don't fit around the spokes of the core.

I know it's no fun, but you will not see the exterior anyway. Drill them with a 6.5 bit to fit the M6 screws.
