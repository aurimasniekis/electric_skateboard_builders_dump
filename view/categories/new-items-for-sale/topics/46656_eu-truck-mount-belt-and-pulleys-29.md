Hi guys,

I have been thinking, would there be interest in a set of these for  â‚¬29?

* The truck is the one that maytech sells
* 36T HTD5M 15mm wide wheel pulley 3D printed in ABS or XT with bearing for flywheel clones or kegel wheels (the one on pic is PLA and for flywheels)
* 15T HTD5M 15mm wide motor pulley with 8mm bore (the one on picture is 9mm wide)
* 260mm HTD5M belt 15mm wide (the one on picture is 9mm wide)

Shipping will be  â‚¬5 for Belgium &  â‚¬13 for the rest of the EU.

If there are at least 20 interested peeps, I think I can make this work :slight_smile:

I will have to order the parts after CNY, so probably I will be shipping around 5 march. (If enough people are interested)

Cheers Frederic

I love that pulley design!
Any chance you might sell that one alone? 
It uses a normal skateboard bearing right?

I hate to say it, but that mount looks like garbage. i donâ€™t recommend it.

also, youâ€™re not supposed to do group buys unless youâ€™re level 3. @moderators

I have been using that mount for over a year and it works great for me :) Have you already tried it? And I'm suggesting a groupbuy is that not allowed aswell? @moderators I can delete the word "groupbuy" if you want :frowning:

Hi Frederic, thanks for starting a shop in the EU. Currently options are limited so another shop is all ways welcomed. On that note, please try to contribute to this forum and community more. All of your posts on this forum have been promoting you shop or selling parts. This will help you gain the trust of your customers
![image|395x499](upload://eFpdhC8UPSGcC052fj6x6oLWnAo.jpeg)
Also, have you tested all of your parts? They are mostly Chinese and some of them are very low quality. If you want to succeed you will need to get quality parts first. 

Good luck with your future endeavors

Hi thanks for the feedback. Yes I tested all the parts for almost a year. I had a webshop before but just made a new one and I'm trying to promote it a bit... That's the reason why my latest post were about promoting, will try to contribute more in future!

For those who are interested, I put the truck + mount + belt + pulleys online [here](https://electricboardsolutions.com/collections/kits/products/mechanical-kit-htd5) for a limited time @ 29 euro's :)

Just out of curiosity.. The belt tensioning on those mounts can be adjusted or no?

Is the motor mount plate made of Aluminum or Steel?

No, but it's tight tension as it comes, I will laser some new where the motor can slide :) (Those are the standard ones from maytech)

It's not aluminum for sure, it's steel probablly with some thermal treatment to make it stiffer, it's very strong for sure :+1::+1:

No it's not, aluminum won't be strong enough at that thickness

this is straight from the maytech product description

They also need to update their industrial designer. These designs (including the new remote) give me the impression this guy worked previously for Durex :rofl:

I got that mount from my backfire 1, i can vouch for it being some sort of steel. 
Its def not alu.

It's magnetic and heavy, aluminum isn't

Believe it or not, lasercutting steel is cheaper and easier than lasercutting aluminum.

That's why I'm questioning why almost all the mounts are aluminum? Only reason I can think is that they are more resistant against corrosion and anodized aluminum looks great :)

In general people prefer cnc'd parts because lasercut doesn't leave the surface as smooth. Furthermore aluminum is stronger by weight and its natural oxide is protective whereas steel oxide is distructive.

Yes true surface is not as smooth but with an surface treatment (paint would be enough) it can also be nice. And with an electrolytic galvanizing it will be fine for corrosion no?

Sure that's the car industry standard and holds up well. But esk8 mounts are very prone to getting scratched.

Yes true, but for a budget build it will be more than fine :)
