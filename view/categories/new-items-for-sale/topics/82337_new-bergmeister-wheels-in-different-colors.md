Hi everybody,
just to let you know that I just received the new batch of Bergmeister wheels. Unfortunately, the timing was not the best as we have not yet had the time to assemble all of them and I will be leaving Taiwan in a couple of hours.
I am back on Feb 12th or 13th and then there will be another flash sale with immediate shipment. 
The flash sale will also include some other components. 
For compatibility with your trucks: I have seen that @marcmt88 already made some great pulleys with different teeth options. We have been testing out a new 60T pulley that is compatible with TB218 as well as Evolve GT. The files will be published for free (in case you want to do your own milling). Alternatively, you can purchase them from us by end of February. The material will be POM.

For those who would like orange colored rims: they will be available Feb 28th.
Pricing will be released when the flash sale is happening.

best regards,
Timo

![fullsizeoutput_20e9|666x500](upload://iLJiEuvLXbQAw8tgADL8Sb4fqx1.jpeg) 

This Carver is a gift from BMW that featured balanced car rubber wheels on precision rims like, 8 years ago lol

Compare the finish of the Haggy Bergmeister next to a real BMW, award-winning design and there's just no competition.  

Haggy is Ducati-smooth, thank you @riverside.rider!!!

For those wanting to run these on surfrodz. 

16100-2Z Radial Ball Bearing Double Shielded Bore Dia. 10mm OD 28mm Width 8mm https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IPSXCH2/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_D0GwCbKWMXTF0

These bearings fit haggys 60t pully and surfrodz 10mm axles.  You'll need 90mm axles tho. 
Also a assortment of spacers (you should have what you need with what came with your surfrodz trucks) 
I also used 
https://www.amazon.co.uk/sourcingmap-20PCS-Thick-Copper-Washer/dp/B00WW717BU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1537529455&sr=8-1 
to get a tight fitment.

on your site you notice that the wheel is 150 mm but when you look at the photos it is marked 145 mm on the tires
you confirm that it is 145 mm ?

these are standard bearings that are put on top ?

Dear Fred,
Thanks for your last. Actually, the wheels diameter fully pumped is 147mm and they are designed to fit the standard 608type bearing (to match any 8mm diameter truck axle).
Let me know if you need any further information.
Best regards
Timo

Aren't those for adapting larger mountain board wheels with 28mm bearings? I was under the impression that  for adapting Bergmeisters or any other wheels that take standard skate bearings that we need these.

Hi @Mobutusan: yes the pulleys have a pulley which better distributed the forces put on the pulley from the belt. It also takes the pressure off the pulley / wheel connection.

If you print it yourself, don't hesitate to print by this link ;) 
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3250555

If not, maybe the [UNIVERSAL 60T ADAPTER FOR THE BERGMEISTER ALL-TERRAIN PNEUMATIC WHEELS](https://haggyboard.com/collections/drive-gears/products/universal-60t-adapter) could work for you.

thanks a lot. Will there also be a version that doesn't need to be bolted to the wheel?
With the bearing and the current 3 spoke design it should be possible to have a pulley fit without the need for bolts.
I'd design it but I don't have the hub design as a CAD file and not enough time to model it myself :(

## \#42 Posted by: riverside.rider Posted at: 2019-02-12T16:32:29.191Z Reads: 171

```
hi Roman (@Grozniy )....i have decided against the use of aluminum pulleys given nearly double the weight as compared to pulleys made of POM. We will only start production of the POM pulleys by Feb 25th and it will take approx. 3 weeks for them to be finished and ready for shipment. So, so they won't be sold during the flash sale. 
BUT, if you have access to a CNC mill, then it may be much faster to have them done locally.
The website will be updated asap. This has kinda slipped thru my hands and the plan is to have this all done once I am back in Taipei.

:smile: ho man, do you have acces to my computer !? haha

It's the next thing I was preparing, but I haven't retain this option cause it's a bit more expensive ... But working on another similar "plug" version ;)

1. I have made this full one piece pulley hub-plug 

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/60t.universal.drive_.gear-v50.png
But... dam the price is around +60â‚¬/pcs.

2. So I was thinking about a Nylon printing or POM CNC base part (here render in AL chrome... just cause it looks better ^^) and alloy tooth.

https://amadridefr.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/plughubhag_2019-feb-12_03-37-30pm-000_customizedview2209985269.png
It could work well too but still 2 parts to make, so not that cheaper.

But on my last proto, with the Bgm rims and a bit longer screws that plug (not screw) directly in the adapter of the gear/pulley. That should work too ... I have to test!
![Capturesup|690x430](upload://nbRCQT2gQbR6yuaaUngdKRwt3mm.jpeg)
So we just have to make a pulley with the Bgm pattern, looks simpler and easier to produce.

Maybe just - I don't know how it's called or if it exists, but - some "screw cover" on the end of the screw could be nice to work better with the plugging on the pulley.
(haaaaa sorry, hard time trying to write correct English ... I'm too lazy to use google trad :laughing: and I don't find a picture of what I want...)

Ok, but as I haven't tested it yet, let me check again this old design, in order to be 99% sure that it works and fit the rim :smile: (and save you some time and material) then I will export it and share you the test-file asap!
BTW, It was designed with 45T actually (or 50T don't remember).

I have a 60t from @marcmt88, I am very happy with the quality and they are light as hell for POM pulleys. I would recommend buying from marc as he is the only one doing some high quality pulleys and mounts. I should had bought my mounts from him with my pulley but better late than never. Now I wait for my Janux mounts :) though the mounts he wants to provide for AT and larger pulleys has a longer arm for the motor mounts.

Fits like a glove :ok_hand:

I would get them in a heartbeat - but he's in the US and stuff just gets ridiculously expensive once you have to ship it to Europe. It's why I love the idea of 3D printing: have someone supply the file from wherever they are in the world and then manufacture it at your own home without the need to unnecessarily ship things around.

Honestly, when I bought my Bergmeister wheels I should had bought it with the trucks/mounts just to make life simpler. So my only other alternative was either Torqueboards (shipping is 40usd flat) or marc's mounts. Go with Haggy if you want the whole shabang for a good shipping price.

Yeah, good point but I want to be able to put some 107mm for street and also would give a try to idlers (and I already have trucks, motors, motor pulleys, ABEC pulleys)
I'll go with marcmt88 mounts and POM pulleys and then cry when I'll get my package in the post office because of the customs. Not used to this in EU where the displayed price with shipping is always final ;)

Still have to choose colours for the flash sale !

We need to set a thing up for EU Berg peeps so they can have affordable pulleys too

Hi everybody,
yes, @Chupacabra got a special deal. I have a bunch of customized Maytech 6374 motors with the closed can design. There have been plenty of developments here. I just got back so my main priority is now to fulfill all orders. The flash sale for the Bergmeister wheels will start today. I am going to update the forum :-) I wish the day had more than 24hrs.

I'm hardly trying to organize me and the 2 or 3 others stuff I'm preparing ^^
Time battle like always!

I would organize a GB for some AL7075 pulley in 55/60T I guess (others like 50 or 45T are also possible, but we need to shoot 1 type).

I have shared the STEPs and STLs to Timo already, the [60T pulley](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3250555) was CNCed and already nicely tested by a rider. I will put the other size and the step files on Thingiverse soon, and Timo will also upload it to his site too ;) So you will all be able to produce them for yourself if some of you want to :+1:
[spoiler]Or,.. support me for future projects :blush:[/spoiler]

A little poll, just to get an idea :

who need some 60T AL7075 pulley for Bergmeister on TB218/Supercarve GT Trucks (I guess SurfRodz too should be easily compatible like it's thinner than the original Haggy design with bearing...)

[poll type=regular results=always]

* you need 2 pcs

* you need 4 pcs ?

[/poll]

Witch system do you prefer?

Price should be around 50/70â‚¬/pcs (WS) depending on the system shoose and if we are 5 or 10 guys to order.

Sorry Timo for this maybe a bit off topic, I thought it was easier to keep the poll centralized here, but if you prefer maybe someone could just move this from here :v: ;)

I would need without bearing, with 28mm bore :face_with_hand_over_mouth:

Hi Riako,
Do you have some news about this amazing 45T pulley? ;D

You should measure axle length needed with these pulleys @moon
Outer  bearing to inner bearing. 
It looks like it will save a bit of space compared to the pulleys these wheels come with.
Great work dude

Yes. Axle lenght and compatible axles/bearings :)

So it uses up around 37mm axle space

The current bearing seat only supports 6300 bearing (35x11x10mm) a nice big bearing :slight_smile:

On these SR Tkp, I used 80mm shoulder bolts which translate to a 50mm axle length. And I suspect 70mm could also work

For those that haven't put these on surfrodz yet i had to use 90mm axles with current pullys. 
I personally like the width of my current setup but this definitely changes up stance options. 
And surfrodz don't offer 90mm axles so it saves the trouble of ordering shoulder bolts elsewhere.

Moons pictures settle it :heart_eyes:

Ill use my trampa wheels for as long as it takes to get some Bergmeister wheels adapted to an e-toxx gear drive :rofl: 

I suspect that will have to be a one off piece :thinking:

I love the colors though... maybe my board will have an accenting color

@riverside.rider, I am making wheel guards to be used with these wheels. Where can I find a sketch with the dimensions or a CAD file.
