Hey everyone,

New member here as I have just gotten into the eskate world and recently completed my own DIY from a kit!

I have been running gripgraphique.com for quite a few years now and would like to let you all know that you can get professional custom laser cut griptape from me.

I have been supplying both Alex from @Lacroix and @Kaly  Ernesto from NYC.kaly hexagon griptape for some time now and only realized recently that they are both big players in the custom Eskate world! :slightly_smiling_face:


Unfortunately I did not get into eskate when I started the company a few years ago and now I am ramping down production.  Due to other commitments in my life and building code/insurance regulation changes, I had to recently sell off my machine to a local makerspace.  However, before I did, I stocked up on lots of hexagons (the most popular design).

You guys can check out our website and see some of the other designs we have limited inventory of. 

The makerspace is also nice enough to give us a discounted membership rate if we ever wanted to use the laser.  So depending on the interest in custom designs, it can be a possibility for me to take a day off and do all the cuts in one go.  As per request, a signup/waitlist sheet has been created here: https://goo.gl/forms/KmOj0sKaEQfopvvc2


The hexagons my website are approx $6.10usd per pack of 50 ($7.99cad)  And free shipping for anything over $38usd

Custom one off designs will be approx. $40usd (depending on the complexity).  And a discount can be given for multiple orders of the same custom design.  

Feel free to post here or email me if you have any questions :slight_smile:    external@gripgraphique.com

EDIT: Can a mod help edit this to the "New items for sale" tag?  If that is not allowed because I'm a new member, then fair enough.

My local maker space also has laser cutter. I will use it as soon as I do my research. Not sure about fumes

Btw I think I saw your website before selling hexagons and then couldn't find it again :smile:

Good luck with it!  Learning how to use a laser cutter opens many doors in terms of DIY projects!

Just an FYI, depending on the makerspace, they may not allow griptape to be cut.  (Two other spaces in my city disallowed this material)

This is due to what air filtration system they use.  Because some of the "sand" on the griptape get super heated and sucked into the filtration system and may be a fire hazard.  I had to make a custom filtration system to work around this.  (And also sold the system to them as a bundle)

Yes, that's the only design I've seen that I like more than hexagons.  And it's hexagon-esque

It looks really functional because any way you tried to scoot, you'd have a straight edge you're trying to slide over

Yeah i like that one. 
Something about all the straight edges is what draws me to the one i posted. 
How many orders would you need to make it worth doing a run of a new design?

Approximately 20 sheets worth of orders.  Each sheet is 11" x 34" (max allowable length)

I can set up a google docs and get a waitlist going

Here is the signup/waitlist sheet :slight_smile:  https://goo.gl/forms/KmOj0sKaEQfopvvc2

Just put down however many sheets you think you'd want.  And when I get close to 20 orders, I'll start emailing everyone for design details, shipping address, payment, etc..


I also put the link in the first post

Who is cutting them for you now? You  can PM me about it. Reason I ask is I have a friend who has a co2 laser engraver/cutter he has engraved wood and metal I could see if he wouldn’t cutting several sheets of grip if I had a vector image file. And possibly different shapes. I know with a business license you can probably get the standard grip tape for cheap

a local maker space "Maker Cube" who I sold the laser to.

Yeah, if you have a friend that can hook you up, that would totally be doable!
Make sure you bring some scrap griptape to practice on and get the power and speed settings right

Yeah, canadian international shipping is pretty pricey compared to what you guys have in the states :confused:

At these low prices though, its not too hard to grab some extras for future builds of friends :) 

Be happy I'm not selling these for $20usd per pack ;)
