Hi, I have some new never used parts collecting dust. at the moment I can't use them, no money and time to build the complete board. Later on I will build my dream board, but not now.
Better for you because you can get some new parts for cheap.
at first I have Torqueboards218mm Trucks with some beautiful 83mm flywheels, cnc machined motor mounts by marc, metroboard pulleys, Bone Cones 96A and some Pivot Cups 96A against wobble already installed. You can fit **two 6374** motors on this truck. All these parts together new around 300€ ~ 350$. You can get this set **for just 230€ ~ 270$**. You also get **for free** some cnc machined ''x-things'' on top.

How thick is the mounting plate? And perhaps you already know how much it would cost to ship to nearby European countries (Latvia specifically)?
