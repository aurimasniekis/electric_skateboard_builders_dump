Could be cool? :sunglasses:
Look nice and square, especially after some use.

How do they look after lots of use,
Have you got a old worn set?

Do they have a weight or speed rating?

& what sort of hubs do they suit?

I'd be interested in a set of black wheels pending more info. My concern is rolling resistance.

I'd also like to know what hubs these will fit? 

The biggest issue with other offerings on the market is that bearing size and the corresponding trucks required to fit certain bearings. 

If these are offered with a hub design that is 22mm bearing, that would fit caliber trucks, you've got something cool here.

ok are you just selling the wheels? what about cores for these wheels? are they included? if so do they fit 8mm axles? and their width?

what about pulleys? if pulleys, what's their spec (tooth count, width, material, etc).

[/quote]

I think what happened is I shared a pic of the wheels [here](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/anyone-tried-to-use-these-rubber-offroad-wheels/30947/51?u=cobber) from another thread (I think the folding board thread) and then diyeskateboard through up this topic because some interest was shown...

poor guy is getting hammered with questions now :joy:

It will be interesting how they hold up, I mean even with a solid wheel _chunking_ especially on a offset lip is some what common with soft duro solid wheels...

Need to give a set to Whitepony to carve the crap out of with heaps of lateral load to see what happens?
you know for science ;)

Probably the best idea :joy: 

@diyeboard what's the inner diameter of these wheels? I wonder if they could fit tramba hubs :sunglasses:

Are the holes just for weight saving or is there any shock absorbing effect?

Looks mad! :heart_eyes:

thank you for your question, we just finished the first production, time will tell and we will show everyone how will it be after riding for weeks later.
so far so good.
light weight and suit only with our own hubs.
will update details weeks later

Looking forward to your product. Please make sure that it either:

a. Will have similar attachment for wheel pulley as other offerings on market

or 

b. You will create your own selection of various wheel pulleys to fit common belt width and teeth.

we are factory showing here to let followers and builders you pros know what we got in progress, we are not ready to sell the wheels for now, we need to do further improvement on the wheels hubs to make it better looking and compatable with builders' own trucks.
so far we make it 10mm axles, but we will finally make it 8mm, so for now they only fit our own truck, the 9 inch truck.

thank you

you know well, both our concern, weight saving and shock absorbing, most important is the convenience for users, life time no no cares for the wheel flat.
so far designed only to fit with our onw truck and hubs, finally will make it fit most regular longboard trucks. need time. so trampa we don't know if it can work well or not.

will 4'' 5'' too small for all terrain board? Mbs is of this size I think, maybe we will make a new mold to make a MBS like similar size all terrian wheels with concave profile to absobe more shocks and apply more riding road conditions.

Thanks for pic..... the inner diameter is too small so it won't fit on trampa hubs :sweat:
But I'm waiting until your hubs and pulleys are available, maybe I could use it for urban carver with 9,525mm axle (with different bearings).

OK, so the ID of the tire is 70mm, the OD of the wheel is 76mm (at least mine are).  So I may need to do some shaving on one side or the other.  @psychotiller, you have any suggestions on method?

Make a wooden jig that clamps the tire. Find a hole saw thats the proper ID. Center it up and cut that hole.

i guess we are talking about the different diameter, better confirm here again. the entire wheel size is 150mm diameter, tire width is of 50mm, the inner diameter is 70mm. as for the outside diameter I don't know what  you are refering to. 
better wait untill you got them then you make a fit adjustment.

The hubs I am working with have an OD (OUtside Diameter) of 76mm.  The wheels you are selling have and ID (Inside Diameter) of 7CM, or 70MM.  So there is a 6mm difference that will have to be resolved, assuming all of the figures are correct.

Ill wait until they arrive to make any structural changes.

This is good stuff, Jason! 
I'm looking forward to someone reviewing the first set. I'd love to know how squishy these really are and if they actually compare to pneumatics. 
Also, did we ever get a weight measurement on these? Are they significantly heavier than pneumatics?

and reviewers will get our future price support for new items and classic parts and kits if they buy any or introducing anybody buying from us  www.diyeboard.com
and we will update the weight later, with hubs and pulleys. single and together.
they are 30% less weight than pneumatics tires since different materials and many holes to lose weight.

we are not sure in the near future we can still sell these new wheels to individuals, several dealers and distributors want it be their sole selling items in the future, anyway we will update here.
we only take our several pcs here on the community to see how people like it and what will they say or any nice improvement suggests.
good luck to those supporters get the first batch wheels, and sorry to the later interesters, maybe we will close the individual sell for this wheel.

you get me worng bro, if you read this topic through you will get it.
I keep updates here to let those guys who bought wheels from us what's the hub look like and pulley size of it, we just finish the hubs production and keep fresh update here to let people know well to make a right useful buy to fit their own unique build.
i personally think measurement always important in mechanics.
and those hubs and pelleys are not intends for selling in seperate, they are the perfect fit hubs and pulleys to our 6inch wheels we so far designed and produced.

you are professional anyway. best of the best! thanks bro.

I recently pulled apart a mountain board due to an ESC failure (it took just 200 meters). It is identical to the 2 in 1 esc offered on your website. The enclosure is also identical along with the hubs consisting of two halves. 

Reason I am mentioning this is because these hubs were unbalanced (severely so) and I may have to look for replacements. Are these an improved version of the hubs I attached/completely different? You obviously source parts from the same manufacturer or you actually produce them yourself.

they are quite different hubs in size and teeth, we are factory, we made parts and kits. we spread over all our parts in China electric skateboard supply chain, so many other factories buy parts from us directly or they clone abd make similar versions.
anyway, we hold the molds, we are the original sources for most of parts and enslosures.
i don't know where you bought, but stongly recommend buy from proffessional store with warranty covered.
and the truck above is ours, our molded trucks.

These look like a super cool alternative to pneumatics. Just waiting for reviews, would like to see a video on gravel to see if they actually ride as smooth over bumpy terrain.

Even a video of a heavier person standing on the board would show how much these deform if at all. 70a is pretty soft is thats the true durometer. 

Anyone have these shipped yet?

Of course you can charge what you want, but it doesn't really make sense for the price to jump from about $60 to $200.  Surely it should get cheaper to make not more expensive?


I wanted to try at the original price, but now I have no interest at all.   But, if you are selling at this price, then good luck to you.  No complaints.

[quote="Bataleon, post:141, topic:32666"]
bearing-to-bearing distance
[/quote]
I will let our technician mesure the size and inform you know later, based on my understand, it should be range from 20mm-36mm,since the bearing is 608, the bearing size is 22mm diameter and 7mm thinckness with 8mm axle diameter, and our tire size is 150*50mm, so rough calculate shoud be around ranges of 20mm to 36mm,  this wheel works well with regular paris and caliber II trucks, we designed for this to be compatible with standard 7inch longboard trucks.
am i saying the right thing you concerned?

38″ Longboard Deck Loaded Clone Bamboo Skateboard Longboard Deck for DIY Electric Skateboard
http://www.diyeboard.com/38%E2%80%B3-longboard-deck-loaded-vanguard-clone-bamboo-and-fiber-deck-p-581.html

Loaded Clone Bamboo Deck 6 layers bamboo +2 layers fiber class
Deck Size – 38″  97cm*21cm*1.3cm

This deck has symmetrical shape and stance for a balanced center of gravity to increase the ability to weight the deck through turns for better control and energy generation. The sidecuts allow for decreased torsional stiffness between the feet to exploit the board's torsional energy to allow for greater nuances in the turning radius.

That's fine 'pal', but surely a better business choice would be to loose out on the first or second batch of wheels, just a bit, to get your product out there and get a good rep for quality, then start ramping up the price as more and more people want them because of the good reputation you've built, the you start making money... Common business sense 'bro'...
You try and recoup your investment in tooling and moulds etc. right away, you price yourself out and no one buys... Just sayin' . . . 'bro'

Yes but those distributors want you to sell high so they can make good profit when they come to sell them as people will be used to the high cost, none of us here are stupid and some have good business knowledge.
I'd be surprised if these wheels cost a factory more than a few dollars to make each...

The point is, if you'd have sold them cheaper to the DIY community, more people would've tried them and, according to you as they're such high quality, reported back that they're really great, giving them a good name, putting the new distributor in a good starting position...

Oh well, companies are greedy, that's all there is to it.

we got some frequent questions here about the wheels mounting on different trucks, i hereby reply here:
we only have few set of this wheels left, if anyone wanna a try, please make a action,first come first served, we are sure they will be soon sold out.
and about the wheels compatibility with different trucks,only if the truck is of 8mm axle and can fix normal 52mm width pu wheels, like 83*52mm , 90*52mm, 97*52mm etc.  then our wheels will fit fine.

this wheels are designed to replace the regular longboard wheels in size of 83mm ,90mm or 97mm, just make sure the bearing is of 8mm axle diameter.
we also sell belt but not sure you can use it since people are using different motor mount and motor pulley, our belt size is HTD 330 5M

So I was trying to fit my old hardware to this wheel, Caliber 2 axle wont fit this hub since axle length too short, only DIYer 218mm truck or  something else with long 8mm dia axle will make it

Fig1 : standard caliber 2 axle = short

It shouldn't matter about the pulley should it? Bearing to bearing it should be 22mm (standard flywheel/skateboard wheel width) whether it's a wheel with a pulley or a front wheel etc.

It would only not fit on to the axle if the pulley is snagging on the existing motor mount because it sticks inwards toward the kingpin that much further, as the wheel (rubber) is that much wider perhaps?

it seemd our 7inch truck has longer axle than regular trucks. besides this 6inch wheels are for off-road, off-road shall have wider truck, that's why we made 9inch new truck to fit them.
and we just make bearing in 8mm axle and let them be compatible with regular truck wheels replacement.
it seems our 7 inch truck has longer axles.

Right, so they're not a straight replacement for regular skate wheels.

Not everyone will want these wheels for off-road. Some, like me may just want them for a smoother ride on their regular trucks... that's why currently I have 110mm scooter wheels...

You need to be clear on this stuff 'bro'. @dotruongq must have bought these from you on the belief that they would fit on his regular skate trucks... now they're either useless to him, or he's gotta go buy new trucks with longer axles!

Well that defeats the object of bearing spacers. They're supposed to but up against the 8mm centre of the bearing so you can screw a nut up to them tightly without putting any lateral force on the actual bearing itself!

You may get away with adding another washer (same as on your axle) between the spacer and the inside of one of the bearings to make up the gap...

I have to say, this is not looking good for these wheels so far :weary: :pensive:

Judging by this photo, the bearing to bearing width has to be at least 40mm! Too big for normal skate trucks... think about it, the bearing alone is 7mm wide and there's the same width as this on the other side of the hub.

The wheels DO fit the @psychotiller 6 shooter AT's (wobblies) perfectly.  I had to press them in, but I did it by hand and it wasn't too difficult which is likely good as it should mean they won't wobbly on the hub.

can I suggest making a motor mount version that supports a wider range of motors, such as the SK3 (just drill an X pattern for the mounting holes, thus allowing a wider diameter range).

That and allow the plate to move forward and backward by loosening the two screws at the bottom holding the mount in place (essentially a mirrored U slot for the screws to slide along). Currently, you offer no proper way of tensioning the belt properly/have to resort to my own design. The only way to tension the belt currently is by skewing the motor mount.

Also make the wheel pulley separate from the hub. Currently, you have to replace half of the hub which includes the pulley, for example when it is worn out or if you want to change gear ratio.

I finally got to test the new solid core airless 6in wheels from @diyeboard on @psychotiller 6 shooter hubs. It's a great ride, the rolling resistance is definitely higher than tires but that was expected.  

You can really tell from the video but I did some pretty hard carves and the wheels never rolled or cambered. 

I'm very happy with them.  Next up is to out them in some mega wide surfrodz and a spud 29 and get in some dirt 😀.

I'm a bit confused now. Recently I went through @whitepony build topic where he said that tires have much more grip than urethane wheels and he don't like that. Also there's a general statement that tires have much more rolling resistance than urethane. @mmaner notice that they have higher rolling resistance than tires so what's the benefit? Similar tire set is cheaper. My hope was that they will roll better than tires :frowning:

@diyeboard I have a question regarding shipping costs. I like to buy stuff on Banggood because they have free shipping.
You have some ok cheap stuff for my needs but shipping cost kills the deal for me. Do you plan to have some other options?
Can't wait to see other opinion on those tires.

Quickly drew up what I meant (part on the left side). The adjustments would be minor at very little extra cost. Your motor protection can needs to be a bit bigger and also needs the same cutouts to support multiple motors.
The SK3's mounting screws have a distance of 31.11mm (measured in a square to the center of the screw) and the c-clip needs room to rotate, hence the larger hole in the middle as opposed to the Maytech motor where the c-clip is receded. 

These adjustments would have obvious advantages.
-use maytech or SK3 motors or anything in between motor mounting wise.
-option to properly tension the belt

My own conversion is a bit more elaborate/mainly because I am stuck with 3D printed parts.
It allows tensioning the belt through the motor mounting screws and allows a variety of different pulleys (different width) to align with the wheel hub pulley. At the end I will most likely implement a pulley with a width greater than 15mm.

I got to ride around with the wheels and it’s a completely different feel from traditional wheels. I quite like them and agree with everything that @mmaner said. I want to put some more off-road miles on them but for rough roads these are a no brainer. (Full disclosure: I have not tried actual pneumatics yet so cannot compare)

Would anyone in the USA or Canada be interested in a set? I’m considering putting them on my store. Should be cheaper then buying 1 set direct (their shipping is $40). If so let me know and I’ll see what I can do.

30Q's have become the cell of choice on the forum imo. You could probably still get them cheaper than us. I think people here would pay well for high discharge 30Q packs. 12S voltage is also becoming more popular now that the VESC's are proving capable of handling the higher voltage using FOC. Give us an Idea of what you would need to charge for various configurations of 30Q packs. Id be particularly interested in 12S3P-12S6P. 

Im sure we'd all be more than happy to give you feedback on the pricing.

we will deal with 30Q distrubutors see how much lower price they can offer for bulk orde purchase.

I do agree, a fairly cheap yet good battery manufacturer is what this community still needs. Keep in mind that if you're selling to diyers, they care more about quality than anything else. 30q, even just 10s3p, would sell a lot. Keep it as safe as possible though, we don't want any more battery fires!

I would absolutely be interested in a 10S2P 30Q pack or anything along those lines with 30Q cells. Another issue is that most of the packs you supply on your site are stacked two cells high and with my current enclosure I can only fit packs that are one cell in height, so it would be nice to have a selection of packs that are completely flat/one cell in height.

I agree. Was very close to buying a pack from you but One cell depth is what I needed at 10s4p so building my own. 

Anything 8s-12s with 2p-6p if you get a esc 12s Foc capable and reliable for future inventory suggestions.

Maybe 3 voltage levels like you have at 8s/10s/12s instead of 6s/7s/10s

Something else is a flat pack and a stacked pack in similar set up. 10s4p big flat back for non flex builds and 10s4p  2 cell high stack for flexy boards so can divide the deck up for the flexing 

 I like your store a lot so long as quality holds. Don’t skimp. Your prices and amount of product choices are great and a 5-15% price increase wouldn’t turn anyone off if that extra trust was there and getting a closer to exactly what they need product.

You mentioned yourself that companies like Meepo buy wholesale from you and essentially only put together the components.

The board I bought came with parts that are all 100% identical to what you sell on your website. I can't spot a single difference from a visual perspective.

The following is identical:
-electronics bay
-ESC 
-Remote
-Trucks & motor mounts
-LG Li-Ion pack 10s5p
-Wheels + Pulley

But it is good to hear you since upgraded the springs. Do you sell spare parts for these trucks, including things such as nylon spacers and the stronger springs? These trucks/any trucks will require maintenance and I was unable to find essential spare parts that normally have to be replaced every six months or so. Not critique, but rather a suggestion to stock these.

If you mention that there are no German resellers, thus my items have to be fake...this is how it works.
German sellers (or anywhere else in the world) buy a large quantity of ready made boards through Alibaba and sell it with profit elsewhere. There are a variety of different companies in China who all use the same components to quickly produce boards in small workshops...that includes Meepo, but you will find identical electronics and power systems in many other chinese e-boards. 

There are a fair number of ''manufacturers'' who all claim to produce the items. We have dicky over at Ebay who sells ''your'' motor controllers and claims to be the manufacturer and involved in QA and QC, but I doubt he works for you...yet they are one and the same product. 

Anyway, did not come in here to expose anything. I just want to improve an already fantastic mountain board with trucks that are NOT BAD at all. I am a heavy and tall rider (98KG), pushing the board beyond what it has been designed for. With VESC and Motor replacements it is a whole lot quicker with more torque and due to my weight, I have to adjust it.

I can only suggest that you support people modding your stuff, instead of seeing it as an attack. This is a DIY forum after all. Buying and slapping on ready made components is the exception here.

On a second note, offering dampas or egg shocks in addition to just the spring system offers many benefits, even if the springs are strong enough.

Springs alone are not very good at dampening sudden quick movements. Adding dampas will ensure that ANY spring, irrelevant of how strong they are, will benefit from better dampening and decreased oscillations.
You will not find many Trampa or MBS trucks with just springs, if any at all.

In the video below, you can see that when the springs are further compressed, the dampas do their work and will decrease oscillations significantly, whilst still offering the flexibility of springs when boarding in a straight line where the dampas are almost fully stretched.

Again, personally just interested in a smooth ride and improving on stock components. These are just suggestions, not critique.

Thank you for your clarification of not bought from us, we much appreciate it.
and identical doesn;t mean same quality.
we sell domestic market, China market with regular quality since people can't afford higher prices.
and export higher quality to abroad.
we can't control the market, it is small industry field, copy and clones everywhere.
anyway, as i said it is spring quality issue, we have cheap spring too, but we don't sell to abroad market.
maybe some people buy from us with domestic quality and sell them on ebay and alibaba, 60% of customers are from domestic trading company and individuals.
and for the mbs shock egges, we are not sure about it. we didn't test on them.

Interesting. Thanks for the clarification.

I'll buy a set of springs & dampas for MBS trucks and will report back if they fit. Would also be interesting for other heavier riders who happen to own your trucks/or copies.

This forum is setup a little differently than others, and I think as 'vendors', you'll have to err on the side of caution when bumping your threads. 

In a traditional vbulletin setup, vendors would pay to have their own section. Then vendors can do whatever they want in that section. You can post hundreds of your own threads, bump your threads, post videos at will and etc. 

In eskate.builders forum, there is no such thing. Every post and every thread flows in a linear progression. There is no 'priority' between vendor advertisements, useful posts, for sale, etc. etc. It all comes down to when was your thread bumped last. 

This is where you, @diyeboard need to be careful. IMO its totally fine to post on this thread. But it is NOT OK to post the same stuff just to bump your thread. If you want to post, please post contributing content. Maybe more reviews of your wheels? (I would be happy to do a video comparison review between your wheels, pneumatic wheels, and urethane street wheels) 

At this point, there are nearly 450 posts in this thread. Probably 100 of them are of the same videos you've already posted. Thats a lot of crud someone has to sift through to find useable information on your wheels.

It would appear that the MBS eggshocks are slightly too long. They are already compressed when the truck is straight.
In other words, the springs on both the MBS and Trampa trucks are most likely longer (the dampers are compatible between these two brands).

I currently chose hard eggshocks, but I imagine the softest variety are a better choice and may be able to compress far enough as to not impact the steering radius too much.

Ok, installing dampers on the rear truck is impossible, since a big fat nut and bolt is used to both secure the motor mount and the springs, thus reducing the available space for a damper even more.

Also tracked down noise coming from the trucks. The tolerances on mine are horrible. The inner diameter of the spacer is way too large and the bushings are made out of metal instead of say nylon (I think they were coated with a small rubber layer, but it pulverised). That combination causes significant play in the truck.

Are your A grade trucks any better? Could you post pictures of the tolerances?

At this point I am considering buying a trampa or mbs board. This thing has so many minor flaws that all add up to a big pile of poopoo. 

Since the axis is 10mm and those of trampa and mbs are all bigger, there is almost not a single part that I can reuse if so do decide to just install new trucks.

you should ask the seller who sold you this for epecifications, our truck are similar but different in many details, like the springs and truck size, and we have both gear size for 400 5M belt and 470 5M belt.
so we really want to help you, but our truck is different from yours, since as I said before there are many similar cheap ones on market, but we make the higher quality with warranty.
still much appreciate your feedbacks here, i will ask for our technicians for some details and message you know next week when we are on duty.
you guys have a nice weekend and happy riding your boards.

A 50a pack is a 50a pack.
A springed truck is a springed truck.
A fixed motor mount without any adjustment options is a fixed mount.

Not sure what you want from me. I can make those assessments just looking at the images on your website, along with specs given. P.S. you are not listing the discharge rating of your Li-Ion packs on your website. I find that kind of misleading. 

I will recommend good products when I see them and do otherwise if there is better to be found. To me, it does not matter what company is behind it.

I am not. If you read my post above you will see that I ask if their A grade trucks are any better and in fact I would love to    see some photographs of those. 

Reason why he replied to me in such manner here is because I gave someone advice on other diyeboard components elsewhere, such as their 10s5P pack. If someone is building an AT MTB, I would never recommend mf 1 cells, no matter where they come from. It has nothing to do with diyeboard. In a similar way, I would never recommend springed trucks that have an inherent way of behaving that will make it unstable at higher speeds. I also informed that user of upgrade options down the road for the truck. Very difficult, since the axis is 10mm, thus wheels and hubs have to be replaced...or you want to convert them to 12mm with bearings costing 16 USD per piece and you'd need 4 per wheel. Similarly, anyone here would advice against motor mounts of which belt tension can't be adjusted.

Please understand that this has nothing to do with diyeboard, but rather the specifications. If another company would offer parts with similar specs, I would recommend the user to look for better parts. If that reseller offers alternative and better parts, such a sensored motors instead of unsensored or packs with a higher discharge, then by all means.

If diyeboard calls such feedback bashing, by all means. I even drew up a drawing in CAD for them that would improve their motor mounts and would make it cross compatible with most motors and allow for belt tensioning.

That said, they have seemingly awesome motor mounts that are a bit more expensive. I would recommend those, along with many other things. I'm certain the wheels mentioned here are superb for airless tires.

Hi Telnoi,

I own the similar MTB from diyeboard, Taurus, which is supposed to have all grade A components, looks different on that truck. Mine doesn't have the thick plastic washer on the bolt connecting the hanger and the baseplate. Just a metal washer. So obviously they were assembled by different people. I've seen the same looking MTB being sold elsewhere but they could be different from what diyeboard sells. Diyeboard is a wholesale supplier of many eboarding companies including the majority of Chinese domestic market and also many major well known eboarding companies. They know very well the difference  between different grades of components that can sell very cheap in Chinese market and the quality demanded by the major companies. They call that the export quality or grade A components. What diyeboard has on their website for retail are all export quality components. Similar products you can buy from all other sources cannot be guaranteed to have the grade A components. I'm told there are retailers in China that buy the Chinese domestic components in wholesale and resell on export market through ali** vendors, ebay etc. So it's hard to say why the problem like yours exist but diyeboard is not responsible for products other retailers put out. You should contact the retailer you purchased the board from make complaint. What diyeboard sells are good quality components as far as I can tell after owning two complete boards from them. 

I also was considering dampening the springs on my MTB so I bougha set of dampa from trampa and they fit but the bolts holding the spring seat are protruding from the dampa seat so I'll have to  drill holes on the one end of the dampas to makethem seat fully. That might change the  damping characteristic, i dont know. But certainly it's possible to  fit eggs and dampas into the springs on my Taurus. What i thought was they made the board too stiff for me so I might not even use them until I find something much softer. I have no problem going 25 mph on my Taurus but I'd rather cruise around 20 so I figure I can live with just the springs. Btw, I was somewhat underwhelmed in the off road capability of my MTB, which can't go through thick lawn or climb grass hills very well, but I found on flat grass and flat dirt it was decent. So definitively this is not a hardcore MTB. But my main use is on the road so I have no problem. On road it performs awesome with great torque and speed with pneumatic comfort. 

I  hope my anecdote gives you some perspective.
```

Yes, it does and I am aware of the export grade story.
All I am asking here is proof in the form of photographs, before I potentially throw away money on another pair of trucks with similar design flaws. I am not even stating they are identical. Just want to see the differences.

The springs on the rear are held in place with thicker screws and a nut instead of just a screw in my case, so even less space for a damper. Also certain that the springs on your and my truck are shorter with less travel compared to mbs and trampa, thus that is another reason for the stiffness you experience with dampers in place.

That said, even with grade B components the board is OK if you stick to flat roads and I can hit 38 km/h there. Mine is already upgraded with dual Vesc and sk3 motors (149kv for hill climbing). The trucks become dangerous on concave offroad paths where it tracks horribly and develops speed wobbles.

I could imagine that wobble. I sometimes feel the slight sign of wobble when going near top speed too. Diyebard doesn't seem know much about dampening and probably didn't expect this problem. Another sign it's not a hardcore MTB. My rear truck also has those thick bolt and nut holding the motor mount. You should be able to find shorter hardware without much difficulty in hardware stores. Have you tried that?
```

## \#465 Posted by: telnoi Posted at: 2017-10-29T08:46:21.811Z Reads: 337

Yes, First wanted to use the same bolt as used in the front, but they drilled out the hole in the bushing for the rear springs, thus I would still have to go with a lower profile nut. 

The real issue though is that the springs are shorter. I had dampers installed in the front only and it had an incredibly positive impact on handling, but as you found out yourself the turning radius is significantly decreased and you will need allot of force to turn the board in a direction. The dampers, due to the short spring length, are already considerably compressed when the truck is straight. 

Last resort will be printing custom ninjaflex dampers for these trucks. I will replace the board completely sometime next year before spring.

I think what will help a lot of people trying to decide whether to purchase from you based on the claims of superior grade compared to similar/identical looking items is comparative pictures showing the difference in your product versus others. 
Many are interested in what you're offering but can't rely simply on your word that it's "better", atleast not until many people purchase and review the items. That's the way of the internet. 

The old saying "A picture is worth a thousand words" could not be more true in this scenario

if the questions is "does rubber do better in wet than urethane" the answer is a resounding yes. 

Some of the most fantastic wrecks i've been in happened in the rain on urethane because.. well.. i'm a damned fool but let me tell you sliding into a drain is kind of awesome when it doesn't hurt so much and the board doesn't fall in. 

i have a huge chip in my deck from that drain. 

Fools be riding in the rain tho. Terrible on the bearings. Terrible.

ever go out to the splash pads on marble like they have in some of the nicer parks and do donuts and burnouts? Jake and i do that on occasion. ITs fun just standing there hammering the throttle and watching the wheels throw water and the board gently start to slide sideways and around in a circle.

but stay out of the water its bad for the bearings.

I think most of us would rather appreciate packs that are totally flat and so proper enclosure for that. Even if it is 12s3p or 12s4p I am pretty sure most people here would rather have the pack totally flat rather than stacked up. Your enclosures are nice but I just think that the batteries are just too thick in height. 

Something flat like EVOLVE style enclosure would be better:

The power on is a press button instead of push switch, which can be pushed accidentally. Now, a quick press turns on and a press and hold for 2-3 sec turns off. Very hard to accidentally turn it off.
The led’s are smaller and more recessed. No change in function.

I don't think the springs are shorter. I think it's the same as MBS boards. Maybe the Trampa's spring seats are shorter resulting in more space for the damper. I just got the shock eggs from MBS and compared to Trampa's Dampa, the eggs are shorter. And they have holes in the ends for bolts. For yours and my rear spring seat where the large bolts protrude, I may have to drill a much bigger hole on the egg on one end to make it seat properly. Here're pics. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/5/956c0576328ca2137ebd1298496bd25311bdd764.jpg" width="439" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/1/810992295e3088c34ee407630ab06019e796108e.jpg" width="537" height="500">

I compared the coil count based on photo references and used the mbs eggs. Still a possibility for human error. Shorter seats might be possible, but not comfortable replacing them with 3d printed versions. Too much force applied. With standard parts the eggs are too compressed, even if you increase the hole size.

Anyway, have to replace all parts sometime next year. I progressed to a point where a 15mm belt is no longer enough, at least not without an idler. Will switch to different hubs and with that a wider belt or chain drive an different trucks. Far superior trucks are already available for 30€, so not going to waste more money trying to improve my current trucks.

If it would be possible to attach my 63 mm motor on their trucks, it would be more interesting for me as the investment would be smaller.

sorry for my late reply, i have been on business trips these days.
We use LG, Samsung 18650cells for 6S4P battery packs.
30Q is too expensive, 3 times higher cost, and it is waste of cells performance since our esc limited the cuurrent draw to protect all electronics and riders safety of high speed riding. 40km/h is super high for regular riders.

Hello, Diyeboard team. What does it mean " The wheels bearings CAN'T be and not allowed to be replaced.  None of the power truck wheels bearing can be replaced or upgraded " talking about the Dual Motor Belt Drive Power Truck Kit? If in the future there is a problem with a single wheel bearing, I have to resend the whole kit in China?

It means can't upgrade with your own bearings since it use the special lipped bearing in the wheel pulley.
It won't easily broken if you don't disassemble it and change it to regular bearings.
If problem happens, we will send you replacement bearings.

3 Solutions are....(1) you return them and get some of your money back minus shipping.....(2) you buy 2 of their speed controllers so you can use the remotes.....(3) you take a lose on both remotes and you learn a lesson that you need to read the fine print or ask questions before you purchase :grin:

You really need to email the company or email them through Paypal if that is what you used or PM them here instead of  using this post for a complaint.

Is a Maytech @longhaired man (the ones you sell). Is obvious that Jason's company in China make them for Maytech. You are watching here the cradle of all spiders. Is like being inside Aladdin's treasure cave. The coin pot at the end of the rainbow.



Don't get nervous...we all know about it. :sunglasses: I've seen it all the time in Alibaba. Just this week went for an Alien 6374 and came up for $ 111 dollars, then went for the same size Maytech (advertised for $80 with quantities) came up for $89 according to Agnes (you know Agnes from Alibaba, right? off course you do, we all do) but the e-mail came for $112; then I went for the same type with Turnigy and came all the way for $136 dolores!



Well, things ended down in Alibaba in which you can get the generic 6374 motor (same as Alien, Turnigy or Maytech)  at a cost of only $50 bucks, buying two for $100 as a "sample for your board". So all what Jason post here really comes as a no surprise to most of us. China is the planet's Toys 'R Us.

$50 bucks generic 6374 170 kv sensored motor, boys (Alien, Maytech, Turnigy just engrave their logo on these babies, thats all)..... :point_down:

I believe that 2 motors that look the same don't obviously come from the same factory/manufacturers. Some manufacturers just try to copy good products and make them cheaper. So you end up with a product that look exactly the same but the parts are made with low quality material, the assembly is crappy and there's no quality control behind.

I approve of this comment. Leads are garbage. To tackle a slightly larger issue, I think sellers do deserve SOME form of compensation for their effort. As a seller (let's assume rebrand), you are essentially buying a large bulk of product from a faceless manufacturer, and wagering whether or not you can move the product. It's very easy for people to look at the OEM price of a component and complain about how they're being ripped off. Truth is, you're buying into a product AND the company that stands behind it. If you don't like that, then feel free to run the same risks on your own. It's what separates a Chinese brand versus an American brand with the 'same' product. You're paying for that accountability.

Hey Jason, do you have instructions for how to pair the remote and set the throttle & brake calibration for the dual ESC? I bought the dual belt drive speed controller and the remote was not paired to the esc. I ended up figuring out how to pair the remote, but I think the calibration is off. The throttle is very abrupt and the brakes are basically off or fully engaged. I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be like this, so I'm guessing guessing that I'm just missing the throttle calibration step.

Really nice design. Two questions.

- Will there be larger battery options available as well?
- Are there external chargers available?

EDIT:

- Why is no warranty offered on the ESC?

On which ESC your current ESC is based as you don't have original source code only disassembled firmware?

we have original source and based on this source code we can customize the esc based on customer's need per their motors and batterys.
so far we customized for many famous brand in this esk8 field.

we take down them because we are improving the new designs, the old ones are not good for diy.
and we strongly recommend to use our own 5065motors. 6354 can be mounted, but 6374 motors have limited space on this kit. our 5065 motors are stong enough for this kit.

This is a great news!! That enclosure means the battery pack will have the flat form factor, which I think is one of the most popular form factor for DIY. If it includes the BMS on the pack it'll be mostly just plug and play. Please consider offering a fast charger as an option as well. so it can charge under 2 hrs.

That's really expensive for an enclosure, add in shipping and it gets cost prohibitive.  Just my opinion, but I would look at either stocking them in the US and EU for quick shipment or lower the price significantly.

I agree on the 12 battery packs, scares me so I don't use them.  a 10s4p with Samsung 30Q cells is a road killer, the only reason to increase to 12s is speed and I can hit 30mph with my Evo build, 36 to 38 mph on 12s is just too much risk for too little reward, for me anyways.

Thank you Mike, your advice always inspire us and always make sense. We will consider lowering down the prices.
it is just the shipping cost is expensive and this enclosure we really don't want it selling cheap, it is a delicated nice enclosure compatible with 4WD built since it has enough space and quality aluminum heat sink included.
anyway will report your suggestion to our boss if can make some changes.
thank you Mike, you always help us alot and order from us alot.

You should talk to some of the existing vendors like @JLabs, @psychotiller, @longhairedboy, @torqueboards, etc.  and see if you can reach an agreement with one of them to re-ship for you.  That way you could send 100 (or whatever) on a slow boat for cheap but the item could then be shipped within the US in 2 or 3 days.  That would justify the cost, but I have personally never paid for than $60 for an enclosure, that includes custom enclosures from @psychotiller.

I bought the airless wheels and put them on my vangaurd build. 

First off they look sick and are amazing in theory. 

A few issues I’ve encountered which make me want to shelf these wheels forever are:

First, The stock bearings are the worst bearings I’ve ever rode on, not only that they are pressed in so removing them is extremely difficult and if you do it wrong you will crack the hubs ( that’s what I did but I had spares) 
Second, the bearing spacer is the wrong size so if you tighten the but too much the wheel locks up 
Third, even with swapping out the terrible bearings to ceramics and shimming the bearing spacer; the rolling resistance of these wheels is terrible. My original wheels got me a 10 mile range while these gave me half that. 
Forth, the tires spin on the hub. So when you brake too hard you’ll encounter some slipping. 

But they look cool <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/e/8ec8cc4cf8de40d5584ace47fc3dca284969a2bd.jpeg" width="666" height="500">

Not good. Thanks for the review. Slipping could be fixed with a ridged profile between tire and hub. Incorrect spacer size appears to be common (same experience among friends with different products).

What do you think causes the increased rolling resistance? Do the tires flatten out? Material too soft?

we appreciate your comment here, there's lack of communication caused issues for your built.
if you let us know you want to swap the bearings we will leave it empty so you can make your own bearing mounted.
anyway what you said here are good for us to improve it much better. 
if you need any support from us you can feel free to let me know, i thought you wrote to me before for replacement of hub scratch of bearing swap by you and we agreed also. is that you?
i must say your quality require is high beyond our factory level, you really pro on this and made a nice built, we can tell from the photo.
the spacer is intentionally designed for this has a reason, we need it to swap the at wheels to 83mm pu wheels kit.

i understand this, thanks for clearification, the spacer problem is due to the 83pu wheels swap, maybe we need to sell two kind of wheels kit, one with current spacers for wheels swap, another with regular right spacers.
and we indeed need to do more research work before making a new item, selling diy kit and part is really challenging, small market but extream demands in quality and unique design.
maybe we should only focus on selling complete board to regular users.

Regarding your controller. Realize that many here are willing to buy and promote your product (unique, one if not the first mass manufactured dual VESC) if you simply ensure that you are working with the upgraded BOM list/make it FOC worthy with an amp rating of 50A continuous (60 preferred) per motor. That means direct FET with proper passive cooling provided by your housing, upgraded capacitors and a few other bits.

You would take a relatively big market share (currently mostly FOCBOX) and dominate the dual motor market for high end ESK8 builds.

It would not cost you that much more in components.

stiff, low count multistrand copper in PVC sheathing that cracks after bending a few times, melts with the slightest amount of soldering and will eventually break conductance as the leads get brittle from all the heat and bending from regular use. 

They're just the shittiest wires you could put on a motor if you intend to use them for an esk8 because motor wires need to be highly flexible and stay cool under load. 

In a lot of other applications, such as in model airplanes or cars where the wiring isn't flexing all the time, they make little difference i would imagine.

if they're Maytech motors they are. Or, rather, if they are the motors that Maytech middle-mans then they'll be great. The only issue i've ever had with using motors from maytech or sk3 or turnigy or really any motor is the phase leads are shitty. I get that you need a certain gauge for windings, but simply extending the windings all the way out as the phase leads is cheap and shitty when it comes to esk8 motors. Terminiate the windings at the housing and solder in wire that was meant for outside the motor, not wire that was meant for inside the motor. 

High strand count silicone wire is the only wire that has any business inside or on any electric skateboard. Anyone using that cheap shit is asking for a fire, or minimally, an inconvenient short.

 FYI, Bought and did some test on Diyeboard's Nylon 36T flywheel pulley for DIY build board. It's fully compatible with ABEC11's original hubs which is pretty good but it would be better if you could provide the bearing spacer with a special size. The special bearings for pulley looks decent but the bearing fits only half-a-way through the wheel hub, so normal longboard bearing spacer is too short to make it work. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/e/ee185d6eb0cdfcb0d0a1a74062ef98d4bd4f343f.png" width="422" height="500">

 For temporary fix, I just put a built-in spacer bearing on one side+ sanded down standard normal sized bearing spacer to fill up the missing gap of the bearing slot on the wheel pulley side.

 Also, 8mm axle needs to be 4mm longer so I had to cut some of the aluminium (which was pretty easy to do but just letting esk8 builders know if they were considering to use this pulley instead of enertion / evolve pulley)

 Looking forward to see DIYeboard making a pulley like this for Kegel 80mm wheels as well and with the special longer bearing spacers so people could tighten their wheel nuts.

hi my friend, we can help customers avoid or minimum the customs tax by reasonable invoice declare, but some Europe coutries their duty charge limit amount is too low and customers have to pay some minimum tax.
we already undervalued your order declare, and your customs tax is not high for the real value, EUR 44.89 compare with 500usd order really lucky duty charge by our reasonable invoice undervalue declare.
if you are not happy what can we say.
i promise you more discount in your future order if you trust me.

yeah, i would prefer flat battery packs such as the ones on Evolve or Yuneec. that way, we can make the boards lower to the ground for stability. the board can be super stiff. Yuneec boards are flexible because the batteries are divided into 3 sections, instead of 1 big section.

Hey guys I just purchased the 6" airless kit with dual 5065 270kv motors. I plan on using a space cell 10s3p pack with some old vescs I have layin around. Now, is that dual motor KV rating of 270kv wayy to high with my battery? Would using a 12s4p pack be better? Should i just try to sell the motors that come with and get lower kv rated motors? I believe the gearing is 16Tmotor/60Twheel pulleys. Would using a certain vesc setting mitigate the issue? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.
```

## \#839 Posted by: Bjork3n Posted at: 2017-12-08T18:10:35.854Z Reads: 333

You should get lower motor Kv so you dont fry the Vesc.
Getting a 12s battery would make it even worse. (More rpm)
Its from my understanding that the RPM of a 270kv motor makes the VESC go bad. Vesc max rpm is arount 60.000 if i recall correctly.

You could limit the rpm for the VESC when using the BLDC tool to avoid the issue.

Or use the ESC that diyeboard sells that is made for the motors.

So if I'm going to buy some new motors what KV rating should i go with to be able to use 12sor 10s...I'm assuming the 170kv or 190kv would work? Also if I limit the erpm setting will th motors draw less power and heat up?

I like the board but the rear truck seemed too marrow. Did you consider implementing a wider truck? I would like to have more stability with this one, plus the raisers under the deck wont facilitate a thing, making the board too tall with a rear  truck foot print too narrow.

Increment the battery capacity; put a wider rear truck; take the risers out; lower the board; and give us a larger deck (32" inches is kind of short - we like real longboards) and you will deliver a winner.

I know they are in 2p pack.
Jason told me that 5p has discharge of 25A and 2p 20A.

If they were lg mf1 cells it would be 11ah and not 10ah capacity?

LG18650MF1 is middle power cell. It is widely used in electric vehicles, electric bikes etc. Also it is economic in cost.
30Q is good but expensive, it have to config with better esc and motor so can perform its best power.

## \#910 Posted by: diyeboard Posted at: 2017-12-12T09:07:05.015Z Reads: 273

in general, mf1 suit our esc and motors best, though 30q can improve the performance buy not much, during the speeding up and climbing 30q is much better. battery package serial and parrallel and cells all affect the discharge, but higher discharge is kind of waste on current escs, we are now working on upgraded esc with higher speed range thus require more powerful motors with suitable kv and with stronger battery supply, in this case 30q in 10s5p will be awesome.

last I checked, asking questions does not warrant denial of service. If you felt I was asking too many, you could have asked me to stop asking questions, or redirected me to email you guys instead...

sorry Ben, our fault, so please message me or email me so i can find time to reply you, thanks for support, live chat is not always available since i am human too, i have limited time and we got many email inquiry and online request everyday.
to be honest, i serve you better than to others though we don;t want to sell you anything, just because you are student and  you like eboard and you have passion. email me my friend.

You deliberately blocked my IP from the website and live chat. You are just misrepresenting your business. This is not how we do things over here in the USA. You do not deny service because i ask questions about returns, and because i am a student....

Hey bensaida. I was a high schooler once, so maybe I can help explain. You have a lot of questions. That is awesome. It means you want to learn. 

Unfortunately Jason does not have time to answer them and the language barrier can be difficult for both parties. I bet if you sent him a polite email with all of your questions he could answer them all at once in like 10 minutes instead of spending hours trying to answer them one by one. 

In america we believe the customer is always right. If you ever work in the service industry in the future you will see that is hardly ever the case.

he could have redirected me to email him instead, if he felt i was starting up too many live chats. Promptly banning me from the site, after asking about return policy, doesn't really make sense to me. Does it make sense to you? I mean, i still am very interested in @diyeboard 's 10s5p kit as it is the only thing that really currently fits in my budget, but now i don't even have the option to purchase it..





I have talked with PulseBoards (only a two-man job) for hours and hours on end, asking questions, and getting answers. Maybe 50x the amount of time and questions. They didnt bat an eye. Then i ask diyeboard a question about return policy, and get instabanned. Diyeboard has a whole dedicated board of members, Think about it. Volume of questions is no excuse.

Hi Ben,
Sorry to inform you that we can't offer your discount and we can't sell you any items just because you are student and we really hope you focus on study.
You are not the first student we refused to sell, we refused all student buy if we can tell they are student, simple rule is not sell the customers under 16years old.
Sorry my friend, there's lots of fun our there don't focus on eboard because it is dangerous for your age and expensive for your budget.
Have a nice day!
Regards,
Jason

Hey Jason. I am sorry about our recent problems, and how i have been bugging
you guys nonstop on live chat. I will stop using livechat, and i will only
resort to email. I will not cause any more problems with you guys, and i am
sorry for what happened. All i ask is for a second chance to get your
product, and that would be amazing, and show what a good company you guys
are, if you put everything behind us. I will stop messaging every 5 minutes,
and i will just buy your product. Thanks. Can you please let me know if i
can buy from you guys? Thanks

heh nice email, right? I apologized to what you saw wrong. Both of us know i didn;t message every 5 mins. Every 5mins would be madness!. Maybe once every 12 hours. But, whatever. Although i find it funny you offered me a "student discount". 



Also if you tell me to "email me so i can find time to reply you, thanks for support, live chat is not always available since i am human too, i have limited time and we got many email inquiry", i thought i damn well better appeal to you guys... apparently not



So first problem was because of return policy



Then because i “requested to chat too much” (easily fixed by redirecting me to email)



Now its “too young”

Hello, I just ordered this board from your website: http://www.diyeboard.com/36-dual-motor-6-wheels-allterrian-electric-skateboard-10s5p-p-596.html 
I was told that the only battery cells available were the Samsung 22p but here you are advertising that it comes with LG cells. I was also not aware that there was a bamboo deck option, and would have opted for that if I knew. My third question is what ESC comes in this board? I saw a couple different dual belt drive ESCs on your website and am wondering which one comes in this particular model. I just placed the order and it says status:shipped so I will let forum members know my experience. Is it true that the batteries will be shipped separately  or take longer to arrive? I was told 10-12 days for everything  shipped to California, so I am hoping to  receive the order before Christmas. Jason@volansboard.com really took the time to answer my questions, but informed methat the 10s5p packs are only available with the Samsung 22p cells which have been given a 5 amp continuous  discharge rating per cell by most reputable reviewers, including Mooch and Torchy. I mentioned that I wanted to upgrade to 30q or a battery with a higher continuous  discharge, but apparently that Is not an option. I am wondering if I can upgrade or build my own pack @ a later date but apparently the esc would need to be changed or reprogrammed, even if I stick with the 10s5p configuration? Thank you to diyeboard.com and everyone in the esk8 builders forum.

you can upgrade or replace the pack without any adjustments to the ESC as long as you stick to 10S.
If you decide to go with a lower voltage, you have to adjust solder jumpers on the ESC.

[quote="Bjork3n, post:940, topic:32666, full:true"]
Jason did you get any information from the tech regarding the Regeneration current?
How many amps regeneration from the Esc makes when braking? What's the max amp that goes back to the battery?
[/quote]
Got answer from technician:
Your question is ver y complicated, and it is hard to give a specific number.
It depend on many factors, the battery bms, the esc and motor as well as riding condition.
We take our 10s2p battery belt kit as a example here, only say the max number here:
Max regeneration currrent is 4.3A, efficient max current is 3.8A.
And it is based on battery good condition and full regeberation braking in a stable period of time.
It has linear curves depend on brake force, rpm and distance.

your ordered but payment not arrive yet. paypal said:
Payment status: PENDING
Wait, don't ship yet
And we have LG and Samsung cells for our battery pack, LG battery is now out of stock due to the LG cells supplier limited supply capability due to the environment inspection.
So we ship Samsung this while. I think i told you this.
You didn't communicate your board upgrade with better deck, we can;t let every customer know what we have and what we can upgrade, we sell regular kits listed on site.

Maybe I can order a pack when they come out and install it myself?

thanks for your support, this is board you ordered is fatastic riding feel with 83mm street wheels convertion kit you can make it switch to a street board within 5minutes.. like GT 2-IN-1.
And you can simply upgrade the battery pack by swap the old ones. all plug and play no more extra things need to do.
and if 30Q works with our upgraded esc in the future, then the speed and performance will be much higher performance.
so far 30Q is not necessary for this esc since it limited the current and make it a waste.

If you read the thread you can see that this question was asked just 2 days ago.. 

"yes, but take some time, new mold is processing now. 10s2p swappable battery kit, like this one, now it is 7s2p.
in the future esc will have app user can adjust curves on app and config the value in brake force and delay and speed.

Working on a low cost proper motor mount/sk3 conversion with adjustable belt tension for these. 

3d printed for now, will receive CNC alu sample next week. Anyone else interested? May look into making them available for purchase.

Single part, 2 M6 set screws per motor mount. Belt length 400.

Thanks. Looks better without crossbars/not required, but personally like the added stiffness and security it brings. 

Many cnc these which increases the price drastically. Going for the cheap approach by just using things you can buy at the local hardware store. Does the job equally well.

Looks like you updated the old design. It looks much better now, but since I moved away from the standard maytech format motors (had a different bolting pattern) and wanted adjustable belt tension, I had to come up with my own solution.

Noticed that once you get replacement belts, the tension might be incorrect. The factory solution allows tensioning only by skewing the motor mount, which causes misalignment.

we can do it if you provide us the drop deck, if you do it by yourself you need to remounting the motor mount lower to keep the clearance from the deck.

Hello everyone, if you saw my post, please help me do a simple survey here:
We noticed 12s is kind of trend now and many builders prefer to use 12S battery, we are planning on 12s battery with 30Q cells and new esc for 12S 48V.
We'd like to know your proffessional ideas and advices of 12S battery and 12s esc need and expectations, 12s3p or 12s4p?
which is better?

Depends on how much current the esc pulls, and the more"p" you add with 30Q cells it will increase range, also make the board bit heavy, if esc pulls like 40-50A , 12s3p should be enough

Completely depends on personal use, it not only depends on the maximum speed, but also the initial torque and after getting comfortable with those speeds some people might want to go faster or while climbing slopes, that extra voltage helps

Not necessarily upgrade everything "existing" 10s works just fine and I guess people don't have any problem with 10s setup, its just as a upgrade factor which would be nice if it existed with your escs, better Motors are always a good thing to upgrade.

What I would do: Stick to 10S and make the esc reliable at 10s when going up steep hills. Then introduce a nice stiffer type deck with nice concave and slight rocker around 36-38 inches with a kicktail and deep wheelwells (similar to decks: Rayne darkside, sector nine mini daisy, Lush machine 3D, Tesseract) Stick to 83mm wheels and belt system for torque. Work on reducing the drag and sound from motors. 12mm belt width is enough. And use good quality trucks, bushings and bearings. And 10s3p 30Q battery placed to balance out center of gravity. Keep weight down wherever possible. Small 3mm rubber riser to kill the worst vibrations. NO cutout for handle! Reliable remote with long throw. Integrated lights front and rear. Then I will push the order button :smile:

You already have some good options for 10s PACKS in your store . And there are absolutely no options for good cheap 12S battery packs on the market . Well priced 12s3p or 12s4p pack with 30Q cells would be in high demand since many of us are using VESCS.

10s4p 30Q seems to be the most common configuration and is mostly used. Then you could have 80a discharge and probably reduce the voltage sag to a minimal.
Flat 4p is used in both Enertion raptor 2 and Evolve bambo and its the perfect size in my opinion. 

That 3p case you got seems to have room for a 4p with some slight modifications, as of now there is alot of space not being used if you look at the pictures. 

Going to be fun to see all the new products in 2018 :)

Since I only ride mountaiboards I'll provide a different perspective.

Minimum requirements in my region:
50A output per ESC, meaning 100A total BMS/Li-Ion pack. big difference compared to say 60A total in hill climbing performance.

12S ideal, since the motor performance begins to suffer at lower voltage (below 37, hill climbing becomes worse). 12S will never cause voltage sag related issues for the regular user, since the voltage is always going to be high enough to provide sufficient power.

Lower voltage requires high amps to obtain the same performance. Since we are often limited by ESC or Li-Ion pack, we can't push the required amps at lower voltages. 12S is therefore king.

sorry to make you confused because of my poor english.
you ordered on 12th and we shipped it out on 13th to our H.K forwarder. we did our best in order arrangement.
and the whole shipping procedure you may not understand well, all electric skateboard ship through a special fedex or UPS way, take much longer time and very expensive.
so the whole tracking will be not as regular way.
the package will firstly arrived FEDEX facility for customs clearance and once it done will dispatch the package to you.
the tracking status also shows after customs clearance done.
for your order i have to say we handled very fast without any delay on our side.

First steps for the custom AT motor mount.
Still have to drill and tap some holes for set screws. Part will be sandblasted and lacquered afterwards.

If the mount stays in place I can start thinking about developing a direct drive for it instead of using 15mm belts (improved reliability/no belt slipping when braking hard). @diyeboard, would you sell me two halves of the hubs for those AT wheels. I would have to add my own spur gear to your wheels.

@diyeboard I'm pretty disappointed with my 6" airless dual belt drive kit I got from you. 
1. The motors that come with are 260kv which shouldn't be run at 10s so
2. I purchased replacement motors and of course they don't fit the mounts on this kit even with 50mm motors.

Why sell a kit without optimal kv rated motors? Do you sell any motors that will work with this kit that are lower kv rating?  

Also the wheels barely spin on the axles which I'm guessing is bad bearings? 

At this point I'm guessing that I'll have to drill new mounting holes so that this mount will support replacements?

I just ordered one of these boards. How long did it take for you to be able to track your package from the time you ordered it? You are saying the 10s5p battery should not be used with the 260kv motors the kit comes with? Also, are the bearings standard size, have you tried replacing them?

we have 180kv, 270kv and 320kv of 5055 and 6354 motors, this at board use 5065 260kv.
it is not bad bearings, just we use more tolerable bearings suitable fr electric skateboard ro make it last longer.
so 260kv is too much for 10s?
speed up too fast and brake too strong?
i think it is your vesc not work well with our kits, that;s why we recommed you using our esc specifically deisigned for this at board kit.

I know...but only because i stumbled upon similar limitations whilst upgrading components.

It's not my place to comment on this, but here it goes. Offering kits without including the accompanying esc is problematic if you don't offer KV options or at least mention that some of your kits are not compatible with VESC.

http://www.diyeboard.com/6-wheels-allterrian-electric-skateboard-power-truck-diy-kit-p-619.html

No KV mentioned. You could argue that the customer should have asked for the KV/motor options.

KV options on a kit? Wouldn't that be nice. 

These kits are compatible with VESC. If you are using a 270kv motor you have to limit your battery to not hit the erpm limit. So going with 6s-8s is going to work with these kits. 

OR you can just buy a complete tuned board from them and ride it. If you want a DIY board be prepared to learn about how to build boards.

It's all a bit complicated...and yes, KV options are required there. True DIY is about options and understanding limitations.

These are advertised as both AT kits and street. The link offers the AT wheels included. For AT you don't want lower than 10s and higher than 200 with proper gearing (applies to Vesc Only).

8s or lower will cause severe under performance due to comparatively high amp draw as opposed to 10S. Hill climbing out the window, unless you get a 6s 150A esc.

You can make anything work, but the performance will be junk = more money wasted. 

Options in his case:
* Different motors (possibly with different motor mount(
* Not using Vesc, but going with dual 6s 150a ESC.
* Using DIY's esc (capped at 25/30A)
*Vesc 6?

Anything else leads to poor performance.

I agree that those motors are not perfect for the setup. That is why I got the TB trucks w/ TB trucks and motors. 

If I was going to get the kit you linked I would ONLY go with their ESC. But I could make a vesc work with 10s. I would just have to limit the max ERPM capping my max speed at around 20 depending on pulley ratio.

yes, there is something to be said for DIYE's stuff all fitting together and it's not like they do not offer alternatives that are VESC friendly. If you know your stuff and what questions to ask, you can find your product. The TB stuff is typically more adjustable with proven designs.

Setting RPM limit appears to be controversial with a fair amount of people still frying VESCs with high KV motors.

Yeah I'm not planning on risking it. I'm totally aware of Dexters parts...spent wayy too much money building his stuff...haha. The only reason I bought this kit was the wide trucks were appealing to test against the few sets of TB wide trucks. I'll make this kit work somehow....just kind of a pain

Oh and I'm also running 3 of the DIYEboard escs in other builds, and honestly even with the big heat sink I add to them to keep them cool, I barely trust them to handle my hub motors, let alone an AT setup

This isn't meant as a complaint...I like the simplicity (plug and play), and the reliability thus far of these parts, however I'm not going to push it's capability to the limit considering the constant hill climbing and steamy ATL temps

12s batteries with 30q's is a great idea. The only reason that nobody uses these voltages is because 10s packs seem to be easier to find. If you can come out with a decent esc that can handle 12s(or even higher voltages) it would put you ahead of the game for sure.

belt tension can't be adjusted on our belt drive kit, and if belt slips(most of time happen when over loaded or climbing big hills or road condition too bad) there's 2 recommended solutions:
1. switch the belts or change with new belt to improve it.
2. proper use the board and smoothly gradual push the remote to speed up or power up. or take the board to a workable road condition.

This is an issue with almost all belt drive boards when pushed to the limit. This is why a lot of us here are really into idler pulleys.

Is it a bundle truck + stair rover only or do you sell the separate stair rover w/ suspension to mount it on different trucks ?

What's the maximum wheel size accepted ?

15mm belt won't slip if you have a proper motor mount with belt tension adjustments or belt tensioners, but you'd have to invest in an aftermarket solution. Other than myself, nobody has worked on mounts for the ATB trucks of diyeboard (to my knowledge).

can't easily to define it is good or bad, it is innovation anyway, innovation always good.
we don't sell it because we don't mass produce it and there's lack of stock issue. People want to buy it we need time to prepare it and it takes several days. and the cost can't be too lower due to the mass production not suppported.
as a rider i think this kit won't be good, suspension system is too low. and controlling the board is harder than regular four wheels board.

@telnoi  , are you using the 9" trucks or the 11" trucks with the springs in them? I just got the 10s5p AT board with the 9" trucks and my only complaint is that the braking is very abrupt and almost throws me off the board even if I feather the brake lightly. @diyeboard does this board include the new 2.1 esc or the old one? Also, even when riding a half mile at the middle speed setting the ESC gets very hot. My infared temperature gun is showing 115 degrees F inside the plastic casing after a 1/2 mi ride at about 18 mph. I know both of the remotes appear to be the new one but wasn't sure about the ESC. Other than that I absolutely love the board and the shipping was very fast. Because the deck is only 36" and has no concave I cannot stand properly on it without my shoes hitting the 6" AT wheels. Therefore, I am trying to do a deck swap to an Arbor 42" deck that has drop thru truck mounting ( https://www.evo.com/outlet/longboards/arbor-genesis-freeride-longboard-complete ), but with the risers I realized I will probably have do do a standard top mount. The other obstacle I have is like a meepo deck swap, I will either have to have an exposed wire from the battery to the esc, or dremel out the top or bottom of the deck to allow that wire to fit in. Does anyone have advice on this? Just want to thank @diyeboard for the quick shipping and amazing product. I love the airless AT tires.

The evolve is definitely lighter and has more ground clearance. I just got the 10s5p and I love it but it gets hot on regular pavement, even for short distance rides. The airless tires are great though. I just wish that it had an adjustable motor mount because it seems to already show that the teeth are misaligned with the belt just from riding a few miles since Christmas. I know telnoi and a couple others have used custom or torqueboards trucks and motor mounts with great success. The idler and adjustable motor mounts seem very important. That is my next upgrade.

braking sensitive is depend on different speed mode, high speed more sensitive. anyway it is all linear.
when you get use to it you will like the sensitivity. it too much delay, there's no fun for controlling the board and it is not good for high speed riding and immediate stop.
brake always related with torque and delay.

The braking is strong for flat ground. Probably tuned so it is effective out n large hills. Even if I ease it on it throws me off the board at half speed. If I pulse it rapidly it works without throwing me....I know this can wear down the teeth, however. I am still waiting for Jason to respond if this is the new 2.1 sine wave ESC or the older one. Don't let this deter you though, I think this board is way better than you would get from a Meepo or similar product and the shipping was so fast considering it came from china. Jason was also very helpful with any questions I had.

I am asking about using this deck ( http://images.evo.com/imgp/700/72239/326809/arbor-genesis-42-longboard-deck-base.jpg ) I am 6' 2" and when I have a regular stance my size 12.5 shoes scrape against the all terrain tires. Have you tried this AT kit with the 9" trucks on a drop thru style deck? I noticed it has the risers, so I am guessing I would have to mount the trucks traditionally on the bottom (top-mount) to get enough clearance. I just want a longer deck so I can have my feet a few inches further apart without my toes/heels hitting the tops of the wheels. Also, I will have to bury the wire from the battery to the ESC into the deck with a dremel, or have it go across the bottom and protect it with a plastic channel of some sort?

About the v2.1 and v1,1 esc, the difference it about the size and two layers and one layers, the benefit of v2.1 is better heat dissapation but requires our 10s5p battery enclosure to mount it well.
the programs are all same now since we can easily flash the program into the pcb.
why we have to use v1.1 esc for at board, it is the program compatibility concern.
the at board use the 5065 motors and if using v2,1 esc, the hardware limit the program compatibility for at board.
simple explain is, our AT board have to use v1.1 seperate esc kit for reliable performance concern, v2.1 won't work well with the at board kit.

No problem @Maralc I think the evolve boards look awesome especially with the new remote and options programmed into it as far as wheel size etc... I guess the ESC in my board is not the new one but the firmware is updated. I wish the motor mounts were adjustable, but I am completely happy with the board I got from Jason @diyeboard and love it. Defintely worth the price and he hooked it up. I am thinking about just throwing this deck on ( http://images.evo.com/imgp/700/72239/326809/arbor-genesis-42-longboard-deck-base.jpg ) and mounting it traditionally with the risers to just get a wider wheelbase and some concave. My one concern is mounting the battery pack on the bottom since it is curved, but I can probably overcome that by doing some shimming with foam and silicone. Also, if I do not want the cable from the battery pack to the ESC exposed I will have to dremel a channel which will weaken the deck... Either way the airless AT wheels are unique and I am stoked on the ride they give. The complete board is a bargain but the Samsung 30q cells, or if they could switch to the Sanyo 20700a I think it would be a good move. I realize this would increase cost though. If I were going to start from scratch again I would do one board with the 2s7p swappable pack and hub motors (under 10 lbs.) and one all terrain board that is under 15-20 lbs with less battery life, and possibly the swappable packs. I would love to see a hub motor option for the 6" airless AT tires. The hubs have plenty of space for the motors and it would be a cool alternative to the thin urethane that current hub motors have.

Would I have to increase the wire length between the esc and battery if I dismantled the board and mounted it traditionally on this deck ( http://images.evo.com/imgp/700/72239/326809/arbor-genesis-42-longboard-deck-base.jpg) instead of doing the drop thru mount?

I must say that I have no issue with the braking on this kit, it's hard but linear. 
I agree on the practice part, I been riding esk8 for 2 years it does take some time getting used to braking no matter the board. 
I always prefer harder brake, you never know when you need to stop fast. 
Try leaning back before braking it helps. 
Also ease of the brake at the end of braking, tends to be hard at low speed if you are not prepared.

I'm using v1.1 esc by the way.

What I would describe as linear is you deciding how strong the brake actually is. With VESC , the braking strength is directly related to how far you push the remote into the negative direction. I can brake very lightly to slow down/keep a constant speed on slopes that are too steep, or apply full brake in traffic/wheels would be slipping or anything in between. Linear behaviour between remote lever position and brake strength.

Sure Jason.
1. Remove wheel and pulley cover
2. Remove pulley screws, 2 at each pulley. Be carefull they are easy to strip, use the correct socket size.
3. Use a blow torch to heat up the pulley eveanly, but focus a bit more on directing the flame in the screwholes and the pulley hole.
4. When it starts to smoke, the glue is releasing (its the glue smoking so don't worry)
5. Use a rag to pull of the pulley. If its hard, use some more heat.
6. Install new pulley.
7. Install the wheel to see if the pulley is aligned and the belt runs straight, if not adjust the pulley in or out (will require heating again)
8. When alignment is good install the screws with some blue locktite, the screw should turn in easy. Its easy to get it in crooked by mistake. Take your time.

All done! Enjoy your new gearing!

-----------------------------------------------
Hope it helps :)

No, if you want to only remove the wheel just unscrew the wheel nut and drag the wheel out. 

My instructions are made for motor pulley swap.

Oh and you cant swap bearings on the rear wheels, it uses a special lipped bearing. 
So just leave the bearings at the rear alone

You do not want to use big motors for these AT airless tires unless you need a lot of torque.  The duro on these wheels is soft for traction and comfy ride. Past 25mph they start expanding from the centrifugal force and come loose from the rim. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/3/13943ba8715bdb7a2d518cf737e8d409da0a9083.jpg" width="666" height="500">

When I put this together and spun the motors up the wheels started coming loose. 6354 motors might work, I had 6374 on here they are too powerful. I would have to gear down A LOT and set the max RPM to limit the speed. I am just using these wheels for crappy roads and snow and I wanted a higher top speed so I switched to abec11 Superflys so I could still get the 35mph top speed I was looking for. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/2/424d8ecfdee7af43a880ecf6b67f5cc02d029e1d.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Hi Jason,
 the idea of the app to configure the curve of brake and accelleation is very interesting, so could be possible to use your dual esc also with a 6374.
Maybe you can release a preiminary version with only basic functions without any graphics ...could be very appreciate.

Don't think you will get proper performance out of those 6374 motors with that ESC.

*KV will most likely be incorrect. The esc expects something around 280 if I remember correctly. Speed will most likely decrease.
*The amp rating of the esc is too low to make good use of a 6374. Your torque/power won't increase that much if at all.
*Gear ratio...KV/ratio will be different compared to factory standards, most likely affecting performance in a negative way.

If you are hell bent on using that ESC, it's best to stick with the stock motors or equivalent.

Thanks for your advices... 
but the double esc in my board drive 170kv (6354) motors and the current for each motor, with a good battery (lipo) is 30/40Amps , enough for a normal use of 6354 149kv, I am not too heavy.
Maybe I have seen that the accellaration is not very linear.

The esc delivers 20/25a max for each motor. On startup, the amp draw is usually the highest/you will notice it more there or during hill climbs.

Where I live there are not many hills, and the goal is to have more torque on the wheels to be able to go on the grass and dirt roads, however, on flat or light slope, the maximum would also be hard sand.

I should choose between these two batteries (2 in series using only 10 cell):

or

multistar are not the favourites here because the c rating is overrated. so graphene is better. the minimum c rating should be 20C if your battery is 5000mah but if it's 10ah and 10S, 15C should be sufficient. it's always better to have more amps available even if you don't use them because of voltage sag.

Looks as though 9" trucks without the mounts on them could house or fit your new adjustable mounts. I have already had some teeth skipped with the stock 10s5p AT board and would like to switch to the adjustable mounts without buying all new trucks etc. like some have done on this forum, @Jreamer for example switched to @torqueboards trucks and mounts. Not sure if he had to change out the pulleys and lipped bearings as well. Could you sell the 9" trucks with the dual adjustable mounts? I love your wheels but don't want to have an accident because of a loose belt one day and fly off my board going full speed. Please let me know if you have any ideas. As of now I love my board and your products are very high quality. I just think an adjustable mount and Samsung 30q or other batteries would be a great upgrade that people would be willing to pay more for.

Thank you for looking into this, I didn't know they were glued as well. Maybe I could buy one truck with the adjustable mounts installed instead of the stock mount?

it need special grinding handlement for this truck to fit the adjustable mount, as I said we are focus on bulk prodcution parts and kits, doing this way will make labour cost and affect our warehouse management plus the office procedure.
if we are small store then I can do this simply, but we are factory, we don't do special diy thing which are not stocked and bulk produced.
whatever, you said right, I will suggest out product team to make some change and improve, since we are doing diyeboard business now we should satisfy market real need and focus on customers requirement.

Their is also a reason that motor mounts that are adjustable with idler pulleys are way more expensive. DIYEboard is produced for the masses. That means if you want it customized you have to do it yourself or pay the big bucks for a builder to do it for you. 

I love DIYEboard stuff for what it is. Great intro boards and a super affordable price. If you want stuff that is adjustable and can be easliy modded to have idler pulleys I would check out TorqueBoards 218mm trucks. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/d/3d6360e1ba2b807312e38dbabfeb63508aaaf2e0.jpg" width="666" height="500">

The board you linked has the small 10s2p battery. It looks like it is running 6s though so 6s4p. And it has smaller motors than the one you ordered.

That is what I was thinking but it odesnt specify the battery size. Either way Jason threw in some of those for a similar price and a spare remote. I would just like to know who is making this stuff to see if I can get some spare tires and an adjustable motor mount. I also want to order a couple of the new swappable cassete batteries for a build. Maybe Jason can answer, is the swappable battery only for hub motor or can I use for single or dual belt drive?

trust me this board need more battery power, 6s4p and 10s2p won't make it last long range, 10s5p is the best set up.

I am happy with my board and I did buy it during the holiday promotion. My main objective right now is switching to adjustable motor mounts and possibly buying a swappable cassette battery to use on a Drop-thru style deck I have for a lightweight build. Do the swappable batteries work for the belt drive kit you sell or only for the hub motors? Also, do you offer steel or aluminum hubs for the airless tires?

swappable battery can power up both hub and belt, but it is 7s2p, so can't supply too much power for long range.
7s2p is best for hubs. belt consume more power. 
and we don't sell the hubs seperately, but if you need it I will try to sell you one set, message me privately.

Not sure what your gear ratio is, but that might have a bigger impact on your torque than the motors you are using. For MTB, you typically see a 1.4-1.6 ratio. 

And would go for graphene as others have mentioned. Using 4x zippy 8000mah 30c myself.

Ground clearance: 2 inches ≈ 5 cm   the clearance from center of deck is around 4.4 inches. The enclosure box thinkness is 2.4 inches. So battery enclosure to ground is around 2 inches of clearance. The battery and ground Clearance without risers or shock pads is ~1.3 inches. 1.5 inches ≈ 3.3 cm
You can use the riser pads to increase the clearance and to absorb riding shocks.

We strongly don't recommend customer to make further change with our kit because it will make kit potentially get broken if builder not too proffessional.
Plus our drive wheel only fit certain wheel cores due to the core thickness and size, like our drive wheel can fit flywheels but not sure on MBS wheel, sometimes need sme slight griding works on the pulleys or wheel cores to make them fit wheel, we call it core tolerance.

Thx. Any idea how difficult it is to remove the bearing from the rear wheel pulley? Is it pressed in? Any additional glue used?

Looks like I may potentially destroy it/crack the hub if I apply too much force, or the bearing comes out in pieces.

For future iterations of this hub I would suggest going with drop in bearings. The way this is currently manufactured makes it very difficult to replace bearings. Once the bearings seize you can essentially throw away a big part of the drive train, since the hubs are not sold separately and even so, they would be more expensive than a ~5usd bearing.

Why is there an  extra hole in my deck behind the battery box? Also, I am curious why the power light always blinks when the board is on is that normal? The board is great, but very rarely the accelerator gets stuck. Do you make steel or aluminum gears or hubs for the airless AT tires? Mine seem to be wearing, as well as the belts and motor mounts seem to be a little misaligned. If I put the 84mm wheels on without the risers will there be enough clearance with the 10s5p pack or would I need to top mount the battery box? Thank you Jason! ![IMG_20180111_113625166|690x388](upload://c0gqkGlqHhylUkEzdepsa0s1YcU.jpg)

this is a upgraded kit, the board previous holed up for 10s2p battery, and we don't have any board holed for 10s5p, so the extra holes exposured.
and light is normal. 
you try not to push the joystick too quick.
it is aluminum alloy, we sell it, message me if you need any support.
http://www.diyeboard.com/6-15050mm-airless-allterrain-wheels-hubs-pulleys-p-640.html
and groud clearance is enough.
Ground clearance: 2 inches ≈ 5 cm   the clearance from center of deck is around 4.4 inches. The enclosure box thinkness is 2.4 inches. So battery enclosure to ground is around 2 inches of clearance. The battery and ground Clearance without risers or shock pads is ~1.3 inches. 1.5 inches ≈ 3.3 cm
You can use the riser pads to increase the clearance and to absorb riding shocks.

I would eventually like to upgrade my 10s5p to a better 18650 like the Samsung 30q or Sony VTC5a but Jason said there is no point with the  stock ESC. If anyone had come up with a solution for caliber II or Ronin trucks and an adjustable mount with idler pulley like the torqueboards mounts let me know. Hoping for an aftermarket solution that can handle the 6" AT tires, hubs and pulleys. I guess I have to stick with the lipped bearing that come on those wheels. Anyway pm me if you have found an affordable adjustable motor mount  with idler pulley capability that is compatible. Thanks in advance.

Depends entirely on how demanding you are and what your environment looks like.

If you are expecting an offload monster and buy an AT kit from DIYE, you will be in for a surprise. It won't meet your expectations and the upgrade path will be very expensive and partly non-existing. A replacement battery pack won't fix the lack of torque and amp delivery, replacement motors won't fit the ESC/not ideal (motor mount issue and a specific KV is expected, buy a VESC and they won't fit the high KV motors, replace motors & esc with proper KV and VESC and the motor mounts will turn out to have incorrect tension (slipping due to increased power), destroy bushings due to your harsh riding and you will find that there are no replacements available. You can now throw away your trucks or DIY parts yourself.

Note that people are replacing bushings for much more expensive trucks every odd month or so.

My tip. Buy their kits if you are a beginner-intermediate rider...and stick with their parts.
Big exception to the above is the TB parts & certain clones.

Ok that's nice Jason! 
Any idea on when (approximately) it will be available for purchase? 10s4p 30q with enclosure. 
March or April?

many people asked me about the v2.1 and v1.1 version esc difference, i will give a detailed information here.
they are same firmware, just the size difference, layer difference and weight difference.
v1.1 is one layer with larger pcb size, light in weight.
v2.1 is 2 layers with smaller pcb size but heavy in weight.
v1.1 need mount on the heat dissapation plate, v2.1 need mounted very well but need to air to cooling it down,

You’re saying the esc is sensitive for heat?

I haven’t had any heat issue but I also have but pushed it on any hills yet.

I had plans placing the esc in a sealed enclosure but maybe that’s a bad idea?

@diyeboard what case will you use for the 30q 10s4p you are making?
[/quote]

Heat is a problem when you push this ESC. I describe the problem [here](https://redd.it/7hjkke), and the diy hack [here](https://redd.it/7ia39t).

There's no way for reprogramming it via pc since it is esc with firmware flashed into the pcb unable to do further reconfiguration. it is not vesc.
overheating is beacaue the esc not mounted well and he may sealed the air path on the enclosure.

Glad your feeling better Jason @diyeboard  . The board I got from you has been a blast... It has been a bit touchy with the remote though. Can I upgrade to esc 2.1 from you or a 3rd party VESC or focbox? Also what would be the problem if I replaced the 50 18650 Samsung 22p?? Cells with 25r, 30q or lg hg2?

thanks. the board can't use v2.1 which i explained amny times before. the firmware are same. you can try to use vesc but i am not sure how it performs.
upgrade the battery won't make too much difference since our esc limit the speed and power output.
if you upgrade the cells, you need to use vesc.

## \#1502 Posted by: Bjork3n Posted at: 2018-01-21T04:52:32.693Z Reads: 288

Upgrading to 30q will give more range (430wh) and less voltage sag (80A discharge)
As Jason say I don't think performance would increase that much with 30q (expect better performance on hill climbs) but with a 10s4p 30q you will have no noticeable voltage sag, meaning full power/performance from 100% to 0% battery charge. 

I have a 10s4p battery with 30q that I will use on the diyeboard kit, will let you guys know how it works out! 😃

I've been using 10s4p 30Q cells on the dual 6354 motors from DIYeboard. The torque and speed is just ridiculous. I still couldn't fully test the speed due to having to make significant modifications to the bushing setup to calm down the rear truck on my short wheelbase. Pretty close to where I want now. Underestimating the stability cost me a spill and have been very careful to increase speed. So far, got to the point of low 20mph. It can theoretically go high 20mph close to 30mph.

I will use the 5055 270kv motors. 
You must have geared quite high to get that top speed right? 
I never felt the 5055 270kv lacked torque tough.
Haven't tried 6354 however.

yeah I think 5055 motors are fine for torque and speed. With DIYeboard ESC, the speed and amps have upper limit. But, bigger motors have stronger torque even within that limit. In real life it may not make much difference. But, I like the look of two big ones down there lol. 

I'm using 15t/36t ratio. Probably same as yours but my motors are 180kv. I'm not sure how that factors in performance because the ESC runs FOC and no real ERPM limits.

I will use gearing 13/35 and it gives a top speed of 42kph with 83mm wheels. 

If I would use same gearing and wheels with 180kv top speed would be 30kph. According to esk8calc I used.

Thanks for the info guys, are those drop mounted setups using diyeboard trucks and motor mounts ? Also, how did you modify the rear bushings, are there any brands that fit DIYe trucks, specifically the 9" ones?

You can usevesc with their hubs no problem but don’t use vesc with their outrunners because it will fry your vesc by going over the erpm limit. But i definitely advise to change to VESC you got more power, more torque, more speed and more smoothness

Yes I know there isn't a erpm limit but there is an rpm limit, myself and a few other members have found that the limit is around 6400rpm. Going past this rpm does not increase Speed so you are basically wasting potential torque if you switched to a lower kV motor


With your setup you will be reaching close to 11,400 rpm, although this does not seem to damage the esc it would be to your benefit to change to a motor that outputs around 6400 (ie 140kv - 170kv). 


@diyeboard could you confirm wether or not your version of the esc does this, we have only tested the escs from eBay but they seem to be identical

I just purchased the 10s5p enclosure for my build. It's going under a Trampa Urban Carver deck so I hope it fits and has a little flex as the deck has some flex.
The remainder of my build is sorted, dual "Dark Matter" motors (190kv), dual focbox and the drivetrain is direct drive geared, from E-toxx.

I would have preferred to use a different battery set-up and enclosure, but finding someone who will ship to Australia kinda really limited my choice and I don't have the time or equipment to build my own battery pack.

Yes normally that would lower your max speed, but with this kit there is an rpm limit. So with 10s there is no point having a kv any higher than about 170, 190kV is fine but you will still only reach the same speed as the 170kV setup because of the speed limiter. Basically your motors just don't reach there maximum speed. 


The only way to go any faster than about 40km/h with his kit is by using the gearing and wheels to increase speed.

This whole thing is new to me, so I really hope that all the parts I have ordered will play nicely together. If I understand things correctly, it should be a 'simple' case of just connecting this battery system to my dual focbox then to my motors, then bind the receiver to the transmitter and I'm riding............Just hope the magic smoke stays away.

Well yes that is also true but not what I was meaning. If you have a 270kV motor on 10s with this esc and a 160kv motor on 10s, with both the same gearing and everything (same sized motors, same wheels) they will both reach the same speed, but the 160kV motor setup with have more torque because it has a lower kV.


Here's the math:

270kV x 42v = 11,340rpm

160kV x 42v = 6720rpm

If there was no rpm limit the 270kv motor would almost double the speed of the 160kV one but since there is a rpm both motors only reach around 6400rpm so they will both reach the same speed. So if you want the most torque and Speed use 160kV, if you don't mind just go with the 270kV

The math doesn't really work out unless you have a completely unloaded motor. My guess is those RPM won't get anywhere close to that when you have it loaded. You'd need to see what the loaded RPM of the 270kv and 160kv would to see if either of them got close to the rpm limit.

Oh and regarding the overtightening of the wheel nut, to be safe just turn the nut over so the nylon part is screwed on first, just too be sure it won't unscrew it self. I tighten it all the way then back of 1/5 turn.
If the wheel spacer clicks when knocking on the wheel tighten the axle a bit more until it stops. 
I also use some lithium grease on the axle to make sure everything is running smoothly.

It has been found that the average efficiency is around 80%. 

11,340 x .80 = 9072 rpm

That is still over the limit therefore that is wasted power. 


I don't need to argue this over and over it has been proven and if you want your board to run at its max potential you can listen and take te advice if not, you don't have to

Did you have some torque vs rpm curves for the motors to calculate efficiency? It seems like you aren't taking any real world data (weight, type of tires, type of surface) know what the rpm of a motor is going to be.

Dude just stop, you've been here 30days and you think you know everything. What good is torque curves without real life data. The things that I have stated have been found by myself and many others on this forum. If you want to know more about the rpm limit @bartroosen12 might know some more. If you want to know more about efficiency ask any knowledgeable person on this forum and they will tell you 80-85% is the average efficiency using urethane wheels and belts (With a reasonably geared drive train)

Hey Pat, I don't know what I did to rile you up.  I am interested in real world data, I commented because your back of the envelope math didn't make sense to me. I believe you that there is could be RPM limit and that is wouldn't be good to over that. I am interested in these motors/power train which is why I have been following this thread for some time.

Efficiency (to me) is something like watts in from the battery vs watts out of the motor. Rpm is a speed of the motor. Max rpm possible based on Kv vs load rpm would give you a number on how much you are loading up the motor. I haven't seen 80% around, but you must have based on your testing. Actually I would guess that it would load up worse on higher kv motors with the same drive train. You also would probably have worse efficiency (watts in vs watts out) as well.

I'm the first to say I don't know much, hence why I follow these forums. Joined in Oct '16 if you didn't see that in my profile, but I tend only log in when I want to comment on something. I see you joined in May '17, but really I wouldn't have thought to check on that to see if a person is worth talking to.

@diyeboard ... I had a big scare yesterday when my throttle stuck on my board while I was riding very slowly with my dog. Not just one time but several times in a row. The board threw me off and shot into an intersection. After that I tested it several times in the different speed modes and it was still happening. Do you ever have issues like this? Could it be the esc? I am hoping I can resolve this, as it is a brand new 10s5p AT board.

Did some more testing today. The throttle stick issue has now become a major problem to the point where I am afraid to ride my board. The throttle will just randomly stick on full speed and if I don't catch it with the brake in time it throws me off the board. The lever or trigger on the remote is not sticking so I am wondering how this happened. Have you had any other reports of this @diyeboard? I have only ridden my board less then 50 miles and there is no wear on the belts.

So, I thought the throttle sticking may have been a problem with the remote. Only problem is that when I try to program and sync the new spare remote @diyeboard included with my board I can't get it to pair. I turn the board on and the power indicator on the board is constantly flashing. According to this review of a similar board I am supposed to turn the board on, hold down the power button for six seconds, then use a screwdriver or pointy object to press the hidden button on the remote to sync the board with it. This did not work, and only made the new remote flash a red light rapidly. The original remote (they are both version 2)  still works but I can't seem to sync the spare remote as is shown in this video. I am hoping Jason can give me some insight, as I have been very happy with my board up until this point of almost being thrown into traffic. https://youtu.be/UcN8wL6rAGc

Here is some Diyeboard kit tips& tricks
Make SURE your motor connections are solidly connected to the ESC, and wrap them with electrical tape.
Use some sort of shock absorbing system for the ESCs in the back. Use rubber or foam or anything to make sure it's held in place or else it'll rattle inside the enclosure. The vibration will make rattle noise if the esc is not secured/mounted. 
Periodically check the wiring and keep the battery maintenance with good condition in cold weather. 
If your ESC stop working or only one motor working, please open the enclosure up and checked the connections, reinsert the motor phase connections to ESC, 3 for each motor, and fully cover the connections with the sleeve. 
If your ESC get water coming in and stop working, power off the switch, try to use the hair drier to dry it up and reconnect it with the motor and switch it on again.
If remote no longer control the esc, you need to charge the remote and go through the pairing process for remotes. Sometimes the ESC and remote can get reset and lose the pairing.

i hope you are fine, sorry to hear this. eboard riding always is a fund and thrilling sport. when you practise more and get accustom to it, you will find such braking force is necessary.
you can try to pull the remote joystick slowly and not too much, joystick distance is related with the torque.

5055 180kv motors is not available. it is 5065 motors, we only bulk customized for some customers, and got few stock and sold to one individual customer as he insist want 180kv.
to be honest 180kv not good for AT board, it will lower the speed and make a worse braking.

Jason,

I just sent you an email. I am very disappointed as I was told the 180kv 5065 motors were not available and now the kit that I paid nearly $400(dropped $80 the next morning) for is unusable as I'm using vescs and a 10s or 12s setup. Please please please sell me some 5065 180kv motors or I will never forgive you. Please help me out. I've requested this now more than three times.

Look, the only reason we want 180kv is because we can safely use a vesc and 10s battery more or less reliable than your esc. This market is “based on” vesc so you would be smart to sell something compatible with the vesc which most of us are using. Please consider

Don't buy ANY kit that is based on their chinese ESC if you plan on using a VESC.
Let that be a warning to all.

* You will not find appropriate motors
* You will find that the gear ratio is optimized for their KV and ESC
* You will find that the motor mounts don't offer the required belt tensioning for increased performance
* You will find that important replacements parts are not available for some kits (bushings)
* You will find that bearings can't be replaced easily (pressed in for the 11'' AT kit with 8'' wheels/hubs)

I would not consider these DIY parts. You slap their stuff onto your board and that's it. There is no fine tuning or replacing parts with something better, unless you hack the sh%t out of it and spend more on it than you would on a proper Trampa. In the end, you spend more if you expect anything other than a simple install & go type of thing that will last for years.

My spare remote will not pair using the above mentioned method and my current remote that I paired first does not seem to be the problem. One of the motors seems to be getting stuck in "accelerate" mode while the other one seems to be working correctly. How do I check connection to esc and motor?

My board light flickers immediately right when I turn it on, and when I hold down the button for 5-7 seconds it just turns off. Initially when I asked you said this was normal.

Diyeboard has the best service i ever experienced in the esk8 industry.
If you need parts that is not available on the website it can be arranged in most cases, just send a email to Jason and he will do his best to fix it.
I Could buy the heatsink that is on the 3p case without buying the complete case, thats service IMO.
Whenever i needed parts or help from diyeboard they Always responded within 1-2 Days to help me out.

Qualty wise its not as good as other kits that cost double the price but is it reasonable to expect this? 
Its like buying a 100$ phone and expect it to have Iphone X quality and performance.

The kits have some small issues for sure , but for the price it should be expected IMO.
Please show me a kit for 400-500$ that can reach 42km/h and with good torque?

They want to improve and try their best to.
Is there any other company that responds this quickly to forum members questions?

Keep up the good work.

I honestly don't think its an ESC problem, the kit is brand new.

when you ride more time and gradually you will like the brakes in high speed as it is necessary.
in low speed and middle speed brake you can accustom to it as it is linear smooth and gradual increase torque along with the speed and joystick pull distance.
only in high speed due to the speed and dual engines, the torque is very high due to the inertial.

in high speed mode you can try to pull the brake joystick slowly and gradually not in full brake, it will help.

It has a learning curve but once you had some experience you will get used to it. 
It is however stronger in low speed so be careful when below 15km/h. Always wear a helmet, these kits definitely has some power. 

I'm building a new board at the moment with some diyeboard parts , for the price it's hard to beat. ![20180131_154635|666x500](upload://22fn1lhjBQragju0ZP7hbyPqzl4.jpg)

Hey Jason, I am using the same esc that you sell for dual outrunner motors and I'm having a few issues with it. On my most recent ride I was only able to reach about 30km/h where as on all of my other rides I would be able to go 40+. I also noticed that when I accelerate it starts to pick up speed and then the throttle stops and I constantly go about 29km/h. Is there a reason this could be happening? I'm running 6s lipo and 208kV motors for reference

if you are using 6s, the esc won't work, we never sold any 6s esc to any customers, and our esc works best with our own motors because the firmware is carefully designed per motor specs of kv, power and voltage.
please email me with your order number, i am curious how can you run our esc with your 6s battery.

I am having some of these same problems. My board is having the accelerator stay on, not allowing me to control my speed. I have emailed Jason and he does not understand what I mean by "accelerator is sticking" so I am doing my best to communicate this. Also, the top speed on the fastest mode is now the same as the top speed was on the slowest mode when I recieved the board. I am guessing this is a function of the motor quality, along with the battery quality. I notice I gets worse when my battery dips below 50%. I hope this will change when they implement larger motors along with the Samsung 30q packs. Jason has been very helpful and shipping was fast but now that I have done everything he suggested to fix the issues I am not sure where to go from here. @diyeboard should I send my board back or can you send the components I need to fix it? Any input you have would be greatly appreciated.

can you clearify here that you didn't buy from us, people will think you bought from us and have speed issue with our esc. our esc firmware are different, as we said many times there's A and B level on market, we sell A level higher quality only to oversea market, and we have many dealers in China they only need lower quality b level for cost control concern.

if it is board problem we wil ldefinately send you replacement part for fixing the issue, please email us for the problem, it is not motor problem, as I told you check the esc connections to make sure all wires are well connected and covered well by sleeves, and try to improve the esc heat dissapation by putting thermal paste under the heat sink. 
If your ESC stop working or only one motor working, please open the enclosure up and checked the connections, reinsert the motor phase connections to ESC, 3 for each motor, and fully cover the connections with the sleeve. If your ESC get water coming in and stop working, power off the switch, try to use the hair drier to dry it up and reconnect it with the motor and switch it on again. If remote no longer control the esc, you need to charge the remote and go through the pairing process for remotes. Sometimes the ESC and remote can get reset and lose the pairing.

difference:
 the mosfet on the esc are different quality, thus different current pull and heat dissipation capability, thus speed limitation different, and torque acceleration, braking different as well due to the part difference, B level has lower speed version firmware due to the esc pcb hardware limit, B level is cheaper. and B level is only for China domestic dealer market.
the firmware are different in program, the whole parameter are different.

What would you like in the video? Simply turning the board upside down does not show the problem with the accelerator staying on or "sticking". I love your product from day one, but after two months it does not work the same  I just want to get this issue fixed because I am afraid to ride my board. When going 25 mph one esc/bms/motor mount issue could end all of the fun.

like the bike, the board need to be take care of by periodical maintenance, in winter low temp will affect battery capacity and voltage as well as lower the current pull, so the board performance will be not same as before.
I guess you said stick it is the accelerate won't speeding up anymore, it is either esc heat protection or the battery bms protection, when you climbing big hills or longtime high speed accerlerate, especially in winter, the battery and esc will limit the current continous discharge at high rate, it will auto detect the current and lower down or no more pull high current to protect the esc and battery.
anyway, we know it is a eboard, not a solid iron that won't have any issue, sometimes we need to check board condition and use it properlly that the board can handle.
if you got problem, email me for video or something that we can diagnose.

speed limit is of course fine when a temperature threshold has been reached, but pusher is describing that the board no longer reacts to control inputs when the error occurs.

In other words, he is not able to slow down nor speed up. Asking him for a video would be potentially life threatening. 

p.s. resistance of conductors decreases when the temperature drops, so the current in components could be higher in winter causing malfunctions.

Hi Jason!
I know you are going to close for the sping festival/new year. I ma going to build a board and I was looking to your components. I just would like to ask yuo few questions:
1- When will you start to sell the 10s3p Sansung 30Q flat pack with 60A BMS built in? I read in the discussion that you mentioned dew times before Christmas.
2- Is the new ESC 50A or the double VESC available (if possible with the new Boosted looks like remote)? I need it for dual hub motor sistem.
3- Is your hub motor update to the more resistant PU (hub motor http://www.diyeboard.com/dual-hub-motor-9052mm-1000w75kv-power-truck-p-657.html)? (like Meepo, since they are buying from you).
4- are you planning to sell them in a upgraded kit?

Thank you very much! Keep up the good work.

@diyeboard you say there are two days left before the Chinese New year. I am in San Diego, CA  as you know. There are no winter time temperatures so to speak. You keep emailing, messaging, and posting the same advice on the forum. I uploaded a video for you to the website you asked me to on streamable.com and am still not able to get the board operational. I showed how one motor is accelerating faster than the other. I have checked ESC , and motor wiring. I have had nothing but great things to say about your product until this problem occurred. I would just like to get it fixed especially if you are going to be on holiday for over a month. You have my address, so if it is in fact one of the motors (since I have checked wires to esc and the esc itself) I would like to get one sent before the new year if possible since my board is still under warranty. I use my board for transportation to work as well, so can't go a month without it. I don't have a car right now and it was such a great convenience to have when it did work properly. I love your product and your support, but I question the quality when this happens        after such a short period of time.  I also do not understand how I could make a  video demonstrating more than I already did in the first video.

Yeah this is some serious stuff, very dangerous.
I know i would be terrified if the board kept going after i let go off the throttle.
Jason you should sort this out for Pusher, must be a faulty esc or remote.

ESC or remote is what controls the throttle input and the energy draw. It cant be a battery bms problem in my opinon..
Another thing it can be that the connection between the esc and controll is bad, (antenna)

I finished my board last night with diyeboard ESC and truckkit.

Negative? Don't know what you are talking about, just supplying additional information.

An ESC (any ESC, yours included) is under more strain in winter, not less, because conductive components have decreased resistance. It's science. It also applies to your hardware.
http://www.learnabout-electronics.org/Resistors/resistors_01a.php

The battery is indeed less efficient, but the strain on ESCs and other electronics is higher. I've had multi-rotor equipment fail and produce errors due to the above, despite decreased amps being pushed into the system.

As for Pusher. It seemed like he had difficulties relaying the issue/it was being misinterpreted. Just helping out.

p.s. In no need of your service. As mentioned before, will produce my own parts.

The problem is that the board keeps accelerating, even when I take my finger off the remote...not that it won't accelerate anymore. This is in 70 degree temperatures, and immediately upon startup. I love your board and it worked flawlessly until this problem started happening. I like your product and will be inclined to keep purchasing your products as long as this issue can be resolved. Also, I notice in the slowest speed mode the speed is about half of what it was upon first riding the board. Especially when the battery gets below 75%. I know this is not normal, could it be due to voltage sag from the Samsung 22p batteries? This is why I wanted to wait for the 30q cells or even the new 20700 or 21700 cells from sanyo or Samsung. Anyway I have to get to bed but wanted to make sure to get in touch with you because it seems you only respond around midnight my time. I have also tried to keep correspondence with you through email because I like your product, and had no problem with it until this issue started. It seems you are more responsive on here, however because you keep sending me the same checklist to check esc and with connections which I have done multiple times.

How does failsafe work on these escs? Mine (not bought from diyeboard) broke after 700 meter, never had the chance to test.  That could perhaps explain part of the issue. How many seconds does it take for the motor to stop rotating after turning off the remote? We happens if you quickly turn it on/off when holding throttle at a constant level?

I see, thanks for explain the temp, then it is not the temp problem, we are trying to help you diagnose and fix the problem, sometimes we need to know some details, and our poor language makes the communication not smooth.
so the problem we understand now, you make it clear now, previously you said stick we really don't understand.
then there's signal bind issue, either remote problem or the esc receiver problem. that's why we asked you to resync the remote, by the way, never take two remotes when riding, it will mix the signal and interfere.
make sure remote has power.
our technician always need the video for diagnose then give solution for replacement.
that's why we asked you for video of the problem by making the board lying upside down and in operatio nto see if it occurs same problem, it doesn;t matter during ride problem happen, it happens if esc and remote has problem when it lying upside down and board in operation and remote stick.

The issue always happens. No matter the temperature which ranges from 40f to 80 f. The board keeps accelerating when I let go of the remote throttle. I have not tested the issue at high speeds because if it keeps accelerating on a rough road past 20mph and I do not have control I could easily hit a car or something. I can easily turn board upside down for you and show you what happens when I press accelerator, but I don't know of any way to prove it to you. The accelerator will stick for 3-5 seconds maximum. So, I can't really show this in a video. I assure you that I keep both the board and the remote charged. I checked connections from esc to motors and motor to esc. I only ride with one remote at a time. No matter how I pair either remote, the power button on the board is solid. However, once I press the throttle for the first time the light starts blinking. Before you reply keep in mind I have done everything you have asked me to. Not only did I show the remote issues in the video but I also showed the belt drive wheels accelerating at different speeds. Please send me a checklist to include if you would like me to record a new video to show you that the issues are still occurring. Thank you for your time Jason, you are always quick to respond late at night and I know the time zone and language barrier are a major obstacle in our communication. All American skateboarders and skateboards in general break, repair, and upgrade stuff themselves. There are certain standard parts that are considered the best, and most versatile/reliable. If you could make your parts compatible you would sell so much more product. I would be willing to become an affiliate or help you as long as you can make your esc, motors,bms, and batteries work correctly. As far as batteries go for the 30q, 25r, Sony VTC5a or 6a sanyo 20700a or Samsung 21700 30T. You will sell so much product you would not believe it. Thank you.

@diyeboard it must be the esc because after checking the whole list you sent me my board was not having any issues, then suddenly threw me off. It happened as I was passing some pedestrians with a kid and I was able to jump off but my board kept accelerating into the street with my hand off of the throttle. I don't know how I can show you a video of it but I am now scared to ride my board. I hope it is just the esc and not a motor... You aren't able to resolve this before the new year? It would be greatly appreciated, as this is my main mode of transportation.

as I said in email we will send you a new esc and new remote for you though you can't send us any proof video by lying down the board upside down unloaded and remote control it with different speed and accelerate and brake, you just don't provide us video for this.
it makes my job hard to let our technician to make any solution for you.
and again and again you post here and not reply my email in stead.
anyway we trust any customers, per your case, new remote can solve the problem, but per your insist, we will send you a new esc as a bonus.
but your incooperate of providing video delay the case handlement before CNY holiday.
Now all the shipping companies closed here for CNY holidays, and packages can't be shipped out untill Feb. 26th. I am afraid your replacement esc and remote will be shipped after holiday on Feb 27th.
I already told you in email, but again you post here, we are on holidays now, as i said before we check emails only during holidays, this is the last time i do the copy reply job here for you.
mutual respect is necessary, i respect you and hope you can do the same to me. thanks.

tips for you: our accelerate is gradual speeding up, even your hand off the joystick on the remote, the acceleration still has inertia to gradual accelerate then gradual lower down the speed, it is same with all electric motor cycles. so your said problem is not a problem, it is just you don't know well how it works as you paired the remote several times and failed and you keep asking us why untill we tell you follow the right way and you succeed.
if you want to stop please use the brake, and you want it just release the hand off the remote letting board brake is not possible, braking it by remote control.
and don't ride in high speed if you can't handle it, brake the board gradually not in a sudden push on the remote. gradual brake.
i tried my best here to figure out with our technician here and they want me tell you the proof video is needed, just put board upside down and unloaded and operate it in high speed and accelerate it and braking it with remote, send the video address here for everyone to check it. 
let people judge your said problem is a problem or not. if it is not perform ok we will send you replacement with video proof provided.
send the video here let's check it.

Sounds like failsafe. The older generation remotes (same used in Meepo board and many others, though that might be ''B'' grade..who knows) are known to have connection issues and sloppy deadzones, meaning the control is not very precise. Timeout in between failsafe & motor stop is determined by the remote and the programming of the ESC. You can very easily determine yourself if your issues are caused by failsafe by timing how the board reacts as described before.

Sinds you'll be waiting on diyeboard to send out a replacement (ESC/remote) it may be worth investing in new remote to see if the issue is gone. Should at least provide for a better riding experience.

Just posted this to highlight the difference. You'll have to purchase the remote from somewhere else. They are not expensive.

I did not say it wasn't a problem @diyeboard . The board shot into traffic and keeps accelerating when I take my finger off the remote. Not from inertia. The accelerator gets stuck on. I have two v3 remotes @telnoi and tried both of them.

My dual drive worked great for the first thirty days or 100 miles. Now the throttle is sticking and it is not a fun experience. Even if I slam on the breaks it does nothing . The only way to stop is to jump off the board. Hopefully Jason will get this resolved for me. I have recorded a video showing it but there is no safe way to show a video of me going 20+mph and have the throttle stick, so I have gotten to the point that I will probably just build my own board. I don't even feel comfortable selling this board because of the safety risk it poses on any user, even an experienced skateboarder.

The remotes I have feature the recessed reverse button and all the new features of the v3. No matter what, when I pair the remote the light starts flickering on the board again as soon as I pull the throttle. I have demonstrated this for Jason @diyeboard  on video and it is just back and forth. Won't take my word and I have not been lucky enough to capture the throttle issue with my board on camera because it usually happens above 15 mph and my girlfriend can't catch it on camera. I have showed him a video of the board not showing a solid power light after pairing, and  he acts  like I can't follow his simple instructions, although I have multiple times  and over. I had no problem with his product until this started, roughly a month after I bought it. In fact, I loved the board until the throttle started sticking and said nothing but great things about it.  I love the wheels the most. If these are A grade components I wonder what the Ancheer and similar boards on Amazon with B grade components are like. Scary thought. I hope it is user error or something that can be fixed because I am scared to ride my board. I also notice the belt does not stay centered on the pulleys. It is way off to the left on one of them and even makes a high pitched humming sound above 10mph.

Yes. It is supposed to blink when you hold the power button on the board to indicate it is in pairing mode. So, I pair the remote and it stops blinking. Then, when I pull the throttle it starts blinking again. Since I received the board I have never been able to ride it with a solid power light. Only way it works is when the remote is paired, and once the remote is paired the light stays solid...  But when I pull the throttle it starts blinking again.

No I figured this you had said it should remain solid earlier. I am used to the board and it worked great for the first month or so before this dangerous problem occurred. My original video does show the board upside down accelerating, and I will make another video of it upside down accelerating, but I am not able to show the issue I am having in a video of it accelerating upside down. The wheels move at a slightly different speeds as you said. I will go ahead and make the video for you, but it will not show the board throwing me off. Also, the problem does not happen every time. Only at certain speeds and it happens randomly.

ok, send the video address here also so we can check it.
the belt drive left and right has tension difference so it can't stay exactly same once you brake it, there's motor mounting screws you can check them and tighten them up.
the first video you sent is not a good one show the problem, it mostly show the pairing you don't succeed because of wrong operation. 
you can share that video address too on here so everyone can check.
we have been very responsive to your case as it is very simple only need a video for what we asked for so we can diagnose but it is been a month you just don't willinh to cooperate, i know you are not happy now, we are not too, because you don;t show repect as we email you and asked you email us and you don't. just again and again post here without a necessary video posted.
we just want to help and make your case diagnosed and replacement solution made precisely per video check, please understand and provide it.

Jason,
You have been very responsive to messages and I would rather email you here than publicly on the forum. As you know from my San Diego address wintertime temperatures are not an issue. This issue happens immediately upon startup and it is the factory that my board keeps accelerating, even when I take my finger off the remote/throttle. You can see this in the video I recorded. You keep sending me the same checklist to look at the motor connection and esc connections. I have already done this, and everything seems to be fine. I would like to take care of this before you close for the Chinese new year, as my board has been a great mode of transportation to work until this problem started. Please let me know how we can get this resolved. I will even take my posts off of the forum, as I love your product and it has never had any problems before this. Thank you for your time.

Jason I have been very polite with you. Members on this forum have been very helpful with me and I would like them to be aware of the issue because it is a potential danger to riders. To clarify, you would like me to turn on power switch to board, then turn on remote. Then you would like me to go full throttle for a few seconds and break and repeat the process a few times? I am happy to do this I just don't see how that would accomplish demonstrating that the throttle sticks(keeps accelerating when I let go of the switch on the remote) every once in a while while I am riding. I will do this for you though, no problem. When the wheels aren't on the ground it also creates alot of vibration which I'm certain can't be good but I trust your judgement as the manufacturer.  Let's keep our interactions civil I have never been rude to you or unwilling to help you. I work, not just able to do eskate all the time. It is a hobby and transportation for me not my profession.

thanks for the video, that's what we asked for. our technician checked here too.
let's other customers or forum members here make a judgement here too.
the video shows everything operating perfectly well.
and suggestion for you:
it is a board, need periodically maintenance, belts not in alignment then adjust it well, your repositioning is wrong, you need make belts on wheel pulley and motor pulley same alignment then adjustment can be succeed.
you just repostion on wheel pulley, it doesn't work this way.
and check the motor screws that lock onto the motot mount, tightend them all.
we are responsible and honest seller, we cover the warranty if board has problem, but yours from the video working amazingly in good condition.
if you just want a esc free, i can make a free one for you as a gift, but not for the case. 
i can personnaly buy one from our company just finish this headache time comsuming case.

Jason I have tried adjusting it on motor pulley and wheel pulley. The belt always returns to it's regular position. I can make a video of this if you would like. I also saw that the board appears to be in normal working condition. That is the definition of intermittent. I did not say it happens every time or else I would not step foot on the board. It only happens sometimes which is what I said right off the bat. That is why I was not sure what a video would demonstrate. Even if it did happen during that video you would not be able to tell, nor could you determine the extent to which it is happening because the wheel keeps spinning from inertia after I take my finger off the trigger. If I had a device that could sense the rpms I might be able to display that is still accelerating after I let go, but I do not have such a device. Please trust that it has not only thrown me off several times after a month of use, and years of skateboarding, it has also kept accelerating into my girlfriend's heels, traffic, etc. Luckily nobody has been seriously injured. I have been perfectly clear that the board worked great for the first month and I got used to riding it. This issue just started happening the day I posted about it. Thank you again for your time, I hope we can get this resolved.

I do not want a free ESC, I just want to fix this issue so the board operates as it did when I first purchased it. I'm guessing it could be one of the motors as well, so I'm not sure if a new esc would fix it. I can try my best to capture it continuing to accelerate while I am on the board but I would need several cameras to display this for you in a video. Like I said the problem is intermittent, and happens when I least expect it which is why it is dangerous. It is unpredictable and can happen when I am riding around a pedestrian or a vehicle. It has happened in that situation and nearly caused a collision. If the board were operating correctly as it did the first month it would be as simple as riding around the person or car and continuing to smoothly ride down the street.  I never said it happens every time I press the accelerator. As @Bjork3n said " Yeah this is some serious stuff, very dangerous.
I know i would be terrified if the board kept going after i let go off the throttle.
Jason you should sort this out for Pusher, must be a faulty esc or remote." There is no way for me to make a video of an issue that only occurs occasionally, and puts me in great danger when it does occur.
Another forum member gave solid advice of "good call stay off the board" and another "making a video could be potentially life threatening" I think you are failing to understand the term intermittent,  and the fact that it is nearly impossible to capture on video even if it happened once per day.
Here is another example of an incident that happened to another member of this forum, allbiet on a different board. "Im sitting here on the couch with hands, elbows and hip with no skin because of something like this. In my case, the remote stopped responding and the ESC went full throttle, i had to bail at about 30km/h. Im still trying to figure out what went wrong, but until i can be 100% sure it wont happen again the board is staying in the closet." If you really are the manufacturer and my board is made with A grade parts, I can't imagine the potential accidents that could happen to people that are buying the b grade parts and boards like the Ancheer board that is on Amazon right now. Please think about this before accusing me of lying or telling me the board is working perfectly when it is not.  A short video cannot display a problem that only happens from time to time.

I am actually surprised. The wheels are nicely balanced compared to my board/not nearly as much vibration as my 8'' pneumatic. 

Language barrier is a constant issue it seems. @ diyeboard/jason,please don't take it as an offence, but native English speaker support would be a great improvement.

When Jason mentions that the wheel and motor pulley needs the same alignment he is not talking about the belt being at the same height on both pulleys. The distance measured between the motor and wheel pulley needs to be identical across the whole length. If not, the motor mount has been installed incorrectly or as Jason mentioned, a few screws might be loose.

@Jason. There has to be a procedure for failures that happen under load. You can't just expect your ESC to be 100% ok by just showing it working when the drive train is not under load (upside down video). There could be a host of issues why it fails when someone is riding it. Same with any ESC, including the much more expensive VESC. Since the diyeboard ESC is so cheap, I doubt that Pusher would be trying to acquire one for free. It doesn't make sense.

I have no need for a free/spare esc. I would ship it directly back if it does not solve the problem. There are many instances of throttle getting stuck due to esc failure and throttle sticking and none of them happen every single time you press the remote. It can happen with heat buildup or quick acceleration. @diyeboard you said we could get this resolved before the holiday if I posted the video within three hours and I did what you asked. I told you the video might not show an issue that does not happen every time. If the replacement esc does not fix the problem I would return it, and we can proceed from there and see if it is the motor or receiver for the remote etc. I have no use for another esc, this is my only board.

Just realize @Pusher DIYeboard has a lot of customers to deal with and parts can break. Spending hours on each customer is not realistic and no other company that sells stuff this cheap is this responsive. Take Lectric longboards for an example. I send them emails about faulty parts covered under warranty and they do not respond and do absolutely nothing, no response, no replacement parts. DIYeboard is a the best budget esk8 company on the market. I treat them with so much respect and love because I am grateful for their service because I am well aware of the Crappy companies(LECTRIC LONGBOARDS) and how bad some companies treat their customers. 

Also remember that DIYEboard is the BUDGET eboard company. That means that the parts will not be as reliable as companies like boosted or evolve. But even those companies are not even as close to responsive as Jason is.  

Expecting Tesla service from a budget esk8 company is a little unrealistic.

Sometimes parts are just faulty - get a new one and only worry if it behaves the same way the old did.
Could be a little resistor fucked up the remote signal, could be an error in the firmware.

One last thing I could imagine is a high current cable running near the integrated receiver, which you can easily recognize by a thick flat trace on the PCB of the esc with 90 degree bends. As stupid as it sounds, rearrange your cables a bit and try to get as far away from the receiver as possible with all cables. On a vesc we have a choice where the receiver is located. Not recommended to be near power cables. 

 Anything else is already covered with the exception of a simple hardware failure.

Their ESC run on FOC and seems to be not limited by ERPM like VESC on BLDC. Currently their 55mm motors are 270kv on 10s with no issues. But, it seems to limit the RPM of motor. For hub version, the topspeed is limited at 22mph. With belt ESC you can play around with the gear ratio, but the limit is there.

i quite agree with @Jreamer, the battery power is not enough for dual belt kit since belt kit consume 2 times power than dual hubs do.

Both the one on the esc case and controller shows that the battery is full even when it's not. 
So when the battery is dead the indicator on the remote and esc shows full charge. See picture, battery has 32% charge but remote claims it has full charge.

@diyeboard Jason, I would like to build AT board. At the moment I have two of below motors and would like to get your Truck, mount and wheels - basically whole AT kit without the motors. 

My motors are 6355 190KV 10 mm shaft. 

http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/brushless-motors/aps-6355s-sensored-outrunner-brushless-motor-190kv-2200w/

Do you think my motors will be compatible in terms of size and bold spacing? Those motors are sourced from China, I think you are familiar with them. 


My set up is 10S lipo with dual focbox - for this reason, I was looking for lower KV motors. Also, mine are sensored. Do you offer sensored 180KV - I read you can swap standard 270 KV for 180 KV in the AT kit?

the improvements is the PCB changed and firmware updated, more stable and more solid.
about the details I need to confirm with our technician, you know we are on CNY holidays and technicians all off duty now.
I will ask them after CNY holiday ends on Feb 26th.
you can remind me of this.
there's possibility the old one you made the DIY change with new indicator thus the battery indicate not in coordinate with the battery, the soldering position is very complicated, it is beyond my knowledge so far.
may be the remote pcb not perform same as several times of falling down will make the pcb inside some small broken.
you can change to bind new remote for comparision and plug off your diy indicator for test.

the motors can't fit our motor mount of the 9'' AT truck due the space.
our motor mount only fit 50 motors. 
we use dual 5065 motors on our at truck kit.
dual 5065 motors are very powerful, there's no need for upgrade the motors.
and we focus on stock mass produced kits and parts, we need time gradually develop some kits that suit more proffessional built needs.
and our belt esc no need sensor because we use FOC firmware, the starting torque is same with sensored motors and reponse time better.
anyway our esc support sensored motors, we have sensor plug on esc, but not sure other motor sensor plug compatible with out plug, and motor sensor angle too much difference will affect the performance.
we strongly recommend using our motors with our esc to achieve the best stable performance.

You can with a vesc6 or equivalent based on the same BOM, but even so it would not make any sense.
If you want a proper AT build, you'd want to stick with a motor that is below 190 KV and has a proper gear ratio (say 15T/72T).  Higher KV and a different gear ratio will seriously compromise your torque. With that kind of power/torque, you'd also want a motor mount that offers adjustable belt tension.

If you will not be doing serious offroading you can give it a shot, but it might even slow you down on grass.

p.s. your motors are better suitable for AT as opposed to 5065. Most even use 6374. You'll be happy with sensored, because even with FOC you will have cogging on start-up, especially when going uphill. The vesc typically does not suffer from the downsides mentioned, because it switches to sensorless after a certain RPM.

I have not taken the time to check the airless tires other than the stock @diyeboard 9" trucks but I know    @Jreamer fit them on his @torqueboards 218mm trucks. I just found out that the inner holes fit Starbucks straws perfectly... So if you want a little firmer ride you can cut down Starbucks straws and even possibly shoot silicone into them and put them in the inner holes.... Such a perfect fit...Like it was meant to be. Might also protect material from ripping for those that are zip tying them to @psychotiller six shooter hubs because of slippage. I love these tires though. No issues so far for me. I would like to upgrade to psychotiller hubs for quality but the tires are a joy to ride on.

Would it be a good idea to set the max limit slightly lower for safety?  Like 20?  I assume it will limit torque output but may be worth it for battery longevity

If you want to use vesc however you need 2, one for each motor

No its one esc, you can also get v1.1 that is for dual motors.
1 circuit board for 2 motors.

Reason they are stacked is cuz v1.1 (meepo style esc) cant be fitted in the 10s5p case.

Hey mate,watched your build video. Good work.
What material is the motor bracket? Aluminium or steel? You note that belts stretch easy and an idler would be great, I was thinking of ordering the kit for my third build but I know how frustrating belts can get if they don't tension well. Do you reckon there is space for an idler? Even if a small bracket for the idler was welded onto the motor bracket?
Secondly I see the battery box is 60mm tall, and on your build it does look like you scraped once or twice while testing when you had it strapped on rather than bolted at the start. Have you had any issues with clearance since it was bolted?

Now after a month of riding i got the same issue as another user here, there is a HUGE Deley on my remote now and my board still gives it speed when i dont use the remote and sometimes just ramps up the speed when i drive.

Ive taken the entire board apart checked everything, and my guess is the cap on the esc is bad or something cuz its slightly bulging.

Anything you guys want to sort out with me? I have videos of it.

Can anyone (perhaps @diyeboard himself) "explain" the shipping to me?

I advised a colleague to get dual belt / 10s5p kit. He did and recently got two huge and heavy packages (DHL and UPS) here in EU in record time and there were no import charges or anything else. What kind of sorcery is that? I'm baffled and confused really. Are the import charges covered by DIYeboard? I mean I get a micro drone for $50 and DHL charges me almost as much for import.. :)

I'd describe it as cast aluminium. There looks to be space to just drill a hole and install a bearing stack as an idler. Seems possible. I'm in the process of moving so projects like this will have to wait.

I have the thick diyeboard spacer and 2 1/4in spacers all stacked together. It still scrapes a little if I go over small curbs or speed bumps. It scratches well and doesn't crack so far. But I may buy an extra enclosure just to be safe.

This is honestly all cause I wanted the feel of a drop deck. Pick a flat deck and you won't have to bother with all that.

Thanks for the explanation. I have a drop deck, on another fast speed build and it's worth it, it feels a lot more control and less concern about wobbles.

In regards to the belt. I took a screenshot from your video. And I reckon I could fit a idler pulley just by the drive cog. There appears to be a small amount of room I could drill a hole and work with. We will see.....

In regards to top speed, do you believe you could get 32mph consistently or is this slightly downhill.

Next step for me, order the kit.....![Screenshot_2018-02-22-15-41-39|690x388](upload://3tsRbvzMAD5DxXUFzgCm9EgItuw.jpg)

hey guys, just wanted to let you all know the dual motor esc is good for 50Kmh. I reached this speed with 12s, 208kv motors,  14:27 gearing and 97mm wheels. The only problem is since the esc isn't designed for 12s the LVC doesn't trip and the esc gets quite warm even with a heatsink. Apart from that everything is all good

99% of the time you get charged before they deliver the parcel.

And they have to care, the law in all countries tells them to tax a parcel if it goes above the maximum tax-free amount.

Sorry that's not how customs work here at all. They can open any or every package they desire, regardless of what the (declared) value is. If they see fit, they send recipient a request for invoice. Especially for larger or heavier packages.

But this is off topic, it obviously depend on the destination country. I just wanted to see what magic does Jason use to send out parcels :)

so I have some strangeness, first time I noticed it was when I forgot to charge my remote, initially it felt like when the remote battery started to die it unleashed more power than expected even on slow - I wondered if this was intended as a feature to let user knows remote battery is running low, a little later my remote battery 100% died.

I admit I've only noticed the problem when I need to go slow (paved with people around) I just don't seem to be able to travel at a consistent low speed without just using a little 'boost' of power every now and then. I can't go slow at any setting - its not a problem when I'm riding like its stolen but started to want an even slower mode for safety

* Do you also sell the replacable PU? I can't find them on the site anymore.

That's 100% offload/dirt with hills.
In my case, I needed a 100A or more capable pack to provide more range at the same Ah.

The bearings are rc car wheel bearings and the gear pulley is the stock one just removed the plate. You need to remove the plate to run abec 107 mm wheels![image|375x500](upload://e26JQiHeN5OGLvpEuUhFHNdDVez.jpeg)

I would estimate around 18 km where the last two will be very slow. Main issue of the cells used is that it starts to crumble at around 38v, offroad even around 39V where higher amp packs keep going. I have registered a voltage sag of 3V at 40V during a hill climb at 50A battery amps, which is massive. For comparison, my 4x 8000 mah 30c packs have a voltage sag of 0.7V under identical conditions with battery amps set at 100A.

There are no standard pavements around here that would not get you killed (all 80-100 km/h zones without bicycle lanes).

Hi Jason!
I know thee sping festival/new year is really close, so sorry to bother you now. I am subscribed to esk8.buldier and reddit forums and I would need to ask you something for my upcoming project. I was looking to your components. I just would like to ask you few questions: (I will be focus on hub motros parts)
1- When will you start to sell the 10s3p Sansung 30Q flat pack with 60A BMS built in? It has been mentionend 
 few time in your tread before Christmas.
2- Is the new ESC 50A or the double VESC available (if possible with the new Boosted looks like remote)? I need it for dual hub motor system.
3- Is your hub motors update to the more resistant PU (hub motor http://www.diyeboard.com/dual-hub-motor-9052mm-1000w75kv-power-truck-p-657.html1)? (like Meepo, since they buy from you).
4- Are you planning to sell them in a upgraded kit?
Thank you very much!
Enjoy the New Year!
Keep up the good work as you are doing.
Best regards,
```

over xmas I bought a pair of their 500w hubs to replace my meepo set... so meepo was 250 x 2 and now im at 500 x 2... im not sure what i was expecting but some sort of improvement but maybe not crazy torque like a boosted or something... so far the ride is a bit better...smoother on uphill climbs where the meepo would sag on my ride home...these hubs just keep going (assuming the battery isnt empty)...and carving down a street is better as well..i noticed on the meepo hubs hitting debris and pebbles would stutter the board...where as these hubs keep powering through...

Regarding diyebaord I'd say they assemble something in house but most of the parts are sourced outside and something is custom made. Nothing wrong with it though; it is actually very inefficient to make everything in house.

I have bought 2 dual esc's from your ebay site. I am trying to bind one receiver to both escs to run a 4wd version such as you are selling on your site now.

Can you help?

we don't have any ebay site, our official site is **www.diyeboard.com**.
there may some of our China resellers sell our kits on ebay, we have lots of China dealers they sell our kits and boards on taobao, ebay and alibaba, but quality are different.
We have higher quality level motors and esc for oversea market, and regular quality motor and esc for China market.
the motor power and performance is different, and esc program is not updated new version.

it is not simple as you said just bing them, the programs on esc esc of 4wd are different in kv value and rpm value, they are not same.

They're not the manufacturer. I won't reveal much, but there's a very fine line between manufacturers and middle men. For example there are literally just 2 companies who actually physically make electric skateboard drivetrains. DIYEBOARD is not one of them...

Maybe you can call them a manufacturer of those boards that they assembly? For me the line is clear. Let's assume that we have Diyeboard and Enertion. Their ESCs, wheels, decks, trucks..... they don't make them directly. Don't have refllow owens, they don't cast urethane and don't have wood shop for decks. The difference is that Enertion stuff is designed by Enertion and you can only buy it from Enertion. Things that we can buy from Diyeboard are available for everyone else (in right quantities) and not from Diyeboard.

Except, you can't claim to 'manufacture' individual components. If they want to say they 'manufacture' the completes, then fine. It's a farcry from reality, but fine. However it's ludicrous for them to claim they "make a majority of their inventory" as someone else has parroted. Given a majority of their inventory is sourced individual components, that a pretty loaded claim.

Hi guys! I have the 10s2p dual belt kit from Diyeboard and have a couple of questions,

1 - On the fastest speed mode when im under 50% battery the esc makes a bleeping noise when i accelerate (i presume its a low voltage alarm), Is their anyway to turn off the bleeping noise?

2 - Thinking of getting rid of the stock battery because of the battery sag and using some lipo's, Would two 4s lipo's wired in series = 8s work with the esc?

Yeh the voltage sag is probably very noticeable. That battery probably has 10A discharge current. Anyhow I do not think you can simple turn off the beep sound, since the ESC is not open source as a vesc is. Maybe you can interrupt the connection on the ESC but I would avoid it.
About the battery on their website http://www.diyeboard.com/v11-dual-belt-motor-sine-wave-foc-esc-speed-controller-p-522.html they specify the different usable voltages and you need to slightly modify the ESC for it.

If you look at the ESC you should see a small black cap with a hole in the top (make sure it's not the capacitors, DUH), but if you've worked with electronics, you'll know that this is the alarm. I have simply ripped these off of other Chinese ESCs and it's been totally fine. obviously do this at your own risk, as you risk technically damaging other components when removing it and it will also mean that no beeps/warnings can be made by your esc, which might make things like pairing a new remote more difficult. If you hate the beeping as much as I do, it's worth it.

I have purchased a pneumatic board from diyeboard. First of all, I am generally happy for what I paid for, because I knew what to expect. However I should give some honest comments that might help set peoples expectations.

- The 10s5p pack is made of weak cells -probably samsung 22P if that. My daily commute is about 5 miles, which is also the usable range of the board. I weigh about 85kg and the terrain is flat -though I drive aggressively for at least half of that. I think it is a big mistake that they don't provide better battery packs, I would gladly pay more for a 30q pack. If they claim these sort of ranges that I read above, this is also obviously bad marketing.

- I consider their pneumatic wheels surprisingly good, probably the best value for money than anything they sell.

- The tracks are.. solid. They are clunky and I wouldn't call their design well thought (especially some of the screws are a damn pain to access without a low-profile ratchet) but for their price they are ok.

- I am not happy with their dual esc kit. One of the two ESCs randomly stops feeding its motor when the battery voltage is less than ~39V. I was asked to provide a video of the problem, which I did, then was asked to provide a more detailed video, at which point I thought the problem was gone -but it reappeared the next day. I couldn't be bothered to keep doing videos so I just ordered another of these ESC pairs, along with some other spare parts. The esc was missing from the package when I received it, although they say they have a video of them putting it in the package. The package arrived from the Netherlands so it might have been repackaged. They didn't give me too much of a hard time and they shipped a new one a few days later (otherwise this post would be very very different).

- The motor->esc wire connector sleeves are dangerous as they can't handle the temperatures. They became all black and started falling apart within 2 months or so.

- Their support has been responsive and polite to me.

Overall I don't complain because there is no way I could get a basic pneumatic board for nearly as little money. Being able to experiment with something affordable has a value of its own especially for someone with little DIY skills, and as a newbie I did enjoy the riding experience, perhaps that's why I'm lenient.

Looking at the current state of the Eboard market, I think they have their place because of their good prices, their support is far from the worst and I think we should cut them some slack.

Gentlemen, this forum is not a place for complaining or bashing customers/sellers. The moderators have expressed this on multiple occasions, and there are dedicated threads for rating sellers and voicing your opinions in a **non-threatening** manner. If there are other problems, you can deal with them via PM.

Im using this 5p pack on my 500w delivery ebike and get about 12-15mi before it starts to sag hard enough for me to swap a fresh one in...i know its not an apples to apples comparison but compared to my other similar sized batteries I use for my bike the range is on par for me...

Your photos look like what happened to mine (in their response they said that they've never seen it happen).

https://imgur.com/MymZfVv https://imgur.com/XQLS6h9

At the very least the sleeves need replacing with more durable or the wires will soon short. But it also seems that the electronics of at least the top ESC cannot handle the temperatures, judging from the discolouration and the fact that it is malfunctioning. I think they have allowed too little space for cabling and that contributes to too much heat building up in that area which both destroys the low-quality sleeves and fries the ESC at the top.

I am also getting this grinding noise when breaking hard (I didn't used to).

I've already ordered a second ESC from them but after seeing that its happening to others as well I'd rather not trust it and switch it to Focboxes, putting them in a separate enclosure with better cooling.

They should use real rc grade bullet connectors, not these janky low quality low gauge ones, obviously getting hot enough to degrade the equally cheap sleeves around them.

hopefully someone can help me quick, i have the 10s5p battery pack from diyeboard and i was trying to setup my esc finally but it wasn't turning on, figured it might be a dead battery, started charging it with the esc and everything turned on so i unplugged it and went to charge the battery. plug the battery in and the led on the charger turns red like it should, but then about a minute later the led turns green. i go to plug my esc into the battery to see if it turns on and nothing. i try to charge the battery again and the led stays green the whole time, if i unplug the charger for a little bit then try to charge the battery again, the whole process is repeated.

Hello guys (and girls), so i read most of this thread, wouldn't say I did understand everything (not savvy in electronics, I'm more the network/voip kinda guy) but I'm thinking about ordering from Jason. Anyone from germany here did have any problems with the import, regarding CE-marking with the customs?

I'd like to ride on the street and on gravel, so an all-terrain board would be great, right now I'm looking at the "36'' Dual Motor 6'' Wheels All-terrian Electric Skateboard 10S5P", any concerns about my choice?

Thanks to all for the support, I know I might not be able to contribute much because of my lack of knowledge, but help would be greatly appreciated!

You shouldn´t have any problems with customs, just be prepared to pay about 19% VAT.

About your choice. It depends on how heavy you are and where you wanna drive in our nice country ;)
If you´re on flat streets and gravel paths and weigth up to 80kg you should be fine.
If you ride some hills up and down or are over 90kg, you should search for something else.

Note this is a budget board and works fine if you buy it as complete, but prepare to want more quality/power in the near future and have to buy in an other (more expensive) sector.

[/quote]

I had serious overheating issues, I'm on 110mm wheels without changing the gearing but cutting out the 'vents' section in the enc. really helps also my wires look the same, I assumed it was my fault positioning them next to the esc (in the same section) since I spotted this I cut away part of the sections at the side and made sure they are as far from the esc as possible seems they cannot touch the esc. heat sink or they melt!

that said, now I have a large hole cut in the enc that a def. giving me some real airflow things are MUCH better, my board initially felt like battery was dying at ~38v now I can get it down to ~35 without the dying feeling :) 

![image|175x256](upload://7kqVjUUgC8uEV2Z0sDJX9r6Ww9G.jpg)
this is what I've cut out to get real airflow

BTW my hub kit with same esc/battery(10s5p) has no overheating problems at all!

The battery sag and performance will kill that board fast on our german trails and paths with your weight.

You have the option of going a regular longboard deck, like this diyeboard one, with big all terrain wheels (about double the price of this one, but still cheaper than buying twice). Something like a complete from @fottaz eskating.eu or @okp unikboards.com   

Also if you need a custom battery, just PM me, I build you a suiting one ;)

The board won´t get damaged, only the battery.
It is only a 50A battery, that means it stays healthy at half of that or a bit more. So about 30A is fine.
Problem here is the voltage sag.
If you accelerate with your weight on a small hill, the Voltage sags really hard with this pack, which results in drifting cells - dead pack soon. This also means that you won´t reach the full range with the pack, because it triggers the undervoltage shutdown much quicker with the huge sag, so your board gets shut down earlier.

If you need a second opinion. He's right. At 50a, this pack will not do if you want decent performance out of your board. You can expect 3v voltage sag on moderate hills when you use 25a per motor, meaning range and power is severely limited.

I switched to lipo. Much better.

For a decent Allterrain board, calculate about 1500€.
A top notch board is more like 2000€

You have to write a bit and will be logged free to write PMs. Klick on someones profile and then "Message".
The best Streetboard for a cheap budged is a selfmade one. Other than that, you´ll be ok with Diyeboard or Meepo or some other cheap things. But they are all pretty weak, won´t bring you up hills without sagging and have problems with people over 100 kg.

Hi Tunda

I have a DIYeboard dual-belt kit myself, and have just started to observe belt-slipping. DIYeboard offers no way to adjust belt tension (Jason suggested replacing belts, but I only did 200 km on the original ones), so your solution looks smart. Can you do a "long term observations" post on the solution? 
Does it work as intended ?

```
For any belt drive board, the belt slipping is inevitable. Even for boosted, the evolve.
The belt slipping has 3 possible reasons:
1. over loaded and climbing big inclines.
2. too often hard brakes.
3. the quick start on grass or hard road conditions.
the above said three circumstances will easily wear the belt and get it slipping.
aslo improper diy and belt alignment adjustment with the pulley or pulley change will make belt wear out quickly and break the motor pulley.
we use 13t motor pulley and 35t drive wheel pulley for out 250-5m belt.
any change one of them will make belt tension not good and easy to slip.

so solutions is avoid from above said wrong way of using the board and periodically check the belt tension and make it in good alignment.
if one belt is too loose, need to change the belt.
**belt change is the simple way to make the tension resume perfect.**
another way is diy the belt tensioner which looks awesome.

my problems came from me changing the wheels to 110mm rough stuff. I went thru loads of belts and eventually wore my motor pulleys - if anyone puts bigger than 83mm stock wheels you MUST swap out to the correct gearing

changing to bigger wheels like abec11 90mm size is ok, it won't change the gearing and works better, i think you are using mbs wheels as mbs wheels eat power and torque and the wheels core not perfect fit in our pulley,
we recommend customers stay with out kit as mass stock and mass production ensure the quality and gear ratio is perfect to our wheels and pulleys. we have 35t to 13t gear ratio, people change to 12t motor pulley will easy wear out the belts.

I ordered a pair of 245-5m (only 9mm, not 12mm width) from UK, with 2 days delivery (thumbs up to www.bearingsrus.co.uk) just to try it out.

Unfortunately they are too tight a fit (I *just* managed to install them), so thats a no-go with 245mm belts.

This leaves me three options: 

1) Belt tensioner
2) Drilling out the screw-holes for the motor mount, so I can move the motors a bit backwards
3) Using a spare set of Calibre II trucks, and some bolt-on mounts (suggestions ?)


I haven't decided yet

#2 is a "no turning back" solution. If it fails, i'm forced into #3

original problem was that 250  belts becomes too loose (slipping at hard acceleration/braking) after ~30 km usage - so going for 255 belts will only make belt-slipping worse.

I ended up making belt-tensioner for my diyeboard with loose and sliding belts.

Drilled and cut a Ø5 mm thread in the mototmount, and applied two 605zz (Ø14 mm) bearings on a M5 bolt. Used Loctite to secure the bolt.  

There is still some slack, but I also purchased some 625zz (Ø16 mm) bearings, so I can increase the tension by changing to these if needed.

It got dark outside before I finished the project, so I haven't tested it on the road yet.

Hi @diyeboard , I have just received your 10s5p dual belt kit.
I was wondering if there is a way to adjust the throttle mapping curve of the remote ?

I.E. : When I push the throttle forward, nothing happen for the first 5-7mm and then suddenly the board start with a big acceleration (even if I kick push my board). Same with braking.

Just ordered 3 of the Hub kits .. "10S5P 360WH Battery&ESC&Power Truck Kit Dual 90*52mm Hub Motors".

A little trouble with the website but Jason is super responsive and we got through it.

We have a nice bike path down to the harbor and beach here in Oceanside.  I bought my wife an e-bike as well, so looking forward to spending more time down at the beach this year.  This will be a father/son "build", and I got one for the neighbor as well.

I got the idea from a Razor X we got for my son for Christmas.  I took it a few times and liked it.  The speed and the range aren't there for this kind of journey, but I did take it completely apart and took extensive pictures to see if I could mod.  I posted pictures in another topic.

Hi guys,
I have seen Kieran from Meepo posted on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMQJJG5qxRM) and his website (https://meepoboard.com/pages/truck-recall-for-march-2018) about the issue had in several boards between March and middle April. Specifically the rear truck being weaker than usual. Since I bought from @diyeboard a really "similar" hub motors kit in that period (http://www.diyeboard.com/dual-hub-motor-9052mm-1000w75kv-power-truck-front-truck-kit-p-558.html?zenid=r8bmo6llnr28mo3dguc9vsk826) I would like to know if someone had the same problem with the diyeboard kit. I didn't encounter in the problem so far, but I thought would it be better to know in advance if it is a possibility. Of course Jason can also comment on that and explain the facts nad how his company would take care of it in case the problem shows up. I don't want to create any worry or damage anyone, but if it happens during riding it's quite dangerous, so better to sort it out before hands. Thank you for the collaboration.

Bent trucks after 24 miles. Perhaps I can salvage the motor mounts if I can get them off. The fact that you can't adjust the belt tension on thees make it almost not worth trying to separate them from the trucks. Loaded with a pack I way about 160lbs. After riding for 24 miles or so I already have a bent rear axle and am now to paranoid to ride any further. After pulling the motor mount grub screws out there appears to be no movement what so ever between the motor mount and the truck. The rest of this kit seems to be working alright, I.E. the electrical systems. Thank goodness I have been working on a Torque Boards LiPo project that should be more robust mechanically. http://www.diyeboard.com/10s5p-360wh-battery-esc-dual-motor-belt-drive-power-truck-kit-p-590.html![20180524_141653|666x500](upload://u0zIggfNN0An22R7958ehbgZc1L.jpg)

Looks good! Do you mind sharing what exact parts you used? 

And also, what thread size are you using on the picture, it looks very small.

@sanderfu , RE: DIYEboard belt tensioner: 

The drill on the picture is indeed a small one. It was while drilling a "guide". After that I drilled and cut for Ø5 (5mm, for M5 bolts).
See this link for bearings measurements https://www.kugellager-express.de/stainless-steel-miniature-deep-groove-ball-bearing-ss-605-zz-5x14x5-mm

I started out with 605zz bearings (Ø5 bore, Ø14 outer), and after ~400 km I changed for 605zz (Ø5 bore, Ø16 outer). Not because of belt wear, but because of wear on pulley ! (and I ordered new pulleys).

Thank you so much for clearing that up haha, I’m used to electronics and all of that but the mechanical aspect is new to me.

I guess you also used som spacers or standoffs under the bolt inbetween the bolt and the bearing. How are the new bearings with the increased OD holding up? Ând just out of curiosity, what exactly happened to the pulley?

Thank you! Any reviews? What trucks do they fit? I also just found the diyeboard product pages linked from a Teamgee discussion, $118 for the two hub motors + one truck, $138 including the front wheels and truck, which you're right is significantly more than Teamgee.

They fit most of the standard chnese hub trucks you can get them cheap on meepo or websites like that or ask if teamgee can include it.

And great motors, they are the same used on most Winboard boards, used on the teamgee boards.

I have a Teamgee H6 in house atm, great power from the motors.

They are not used on the Backfire :-) 

These are Winboard motors, they are used on Winboard boards they were also used on the Predator Banchee and on most Huboard boards, i have no vibration on my motors at all they work really well and you can even buy 90mm sleeves for them.

Got both so you can see the difference, also the vibration issue is not from the motors but the wheels used on them.

I got my own wheels made instead of the stock ones and no vibration on my Backfire :-)

@diyeboard - Jason, would you recommend threadlocker on these bolts (both on the truck and on the wheel), or do they already have it?  

FYI Jason replied privately : "Don't make any change, as there's already threadlocker locked well, also we put the thread glue when assemble then, so better do nothing."

New Version 4 Speed Mode 2.4Ghz Remote Controller RC6 is a updated new version remote controller to power on your DIY Electric Skateboard, compatible with all our old escs and new escs and works with all of our diy kits and electric skateboards listed on site. 

From June 1st, all orders that include the esc will come with this New Version 4 Speed Mode Remote Controller RC6.

http://www.diyeboard.com/new-version-4-speed-mode-24ghz-remote-controller-rc6-for-eboard-p-666.html

If any of our customer bought the escs or kits from us, can buy this new remote for upgrade with 4 speed control and better riding control feels.

This remote has no receiver, can't be used for VESC. Its receiver is built-in our ESC pcb, this remote works only with our ESC.

The [old remote RC5](http://www.diyeboard.com/new-version-3-speed-mode-24ghz-mini-remote-controller-rc5-p-575.html) has 3 speed-modes, using this new remote RC6 will gain a 4 speed mode with better performance and control feels, no need to buy a new esc to upgrade your old esc/kit/board, it is completely compatible with all old escs and past orders. Just need to sync/pair with your esc.

Attention: this new remote is designed for our escs only, it may works with partial meepo boards or escs but we don't 100% ensure the compatibility with other seller's esc workability as there's receiver difference in firmware and hardware and transmission protocols.

Damn! I didn't know. It's unpredictable...Since they are brand new you can maybe sell them and change it. We'll see, I still didn't see a review about it. Although I like that the wheel has a metal can, it feels solid and should prevent the PU from sliding on it when it gets hot (problem Maytech hubs have).

:joy: you right. I thought you bought them 3 weeks ago, then 1 week to receive them, time to mount them... But probably the were on the board one hour later you got them. If the battery is getting old then focus on that one. I was wondering whether someone tried this hub with a 11s or 12s...should be fun

These are the 90mm version. Tested them first time today, torque seems good so far, the kit is 7S so top speed is decent enough for this commuter board. The trucks should be more narrow to make this true commuter board, but so far it seems optimal for my use. My other board is 12S Carvon V2 speedmonster

Your all most likely much smarter than me, this is not for you. This review is for you morons like myself that are to cheep tho buy the good stuff in the first place. So far the ESC and battery pack are still useful after 20 miles. Thats the end of my good review. After laying down the nearly $500.00 on the 10s5p belt drive kit I wanted to be able to give it a good review. That was not to b. This kit is junk and for the price I knew deep down that it would be. I'm a sucker! Anyhow, Good luck replacing your motor pulleys that are press fit on just like the motor mounts that are pressed onto the crappy trucks that will bend quickly under Denver, CO., type bad road condition. "Buy once cry once". Good advice that I failed to fallow. Spend a little more money on quality equipment. This kit has been useless to me after the initial two days. I hate being a sucker!!! On the bright side my Torque Boards single motor lipo build is running. I should have spent that $500 at Torque boards or Psychotiller. Live and learn.

Pictures always helps people understand. Anyway, I somehow doubt the motor pulley is pressed on. It's probably glued on, so if you are still thinking about replacing it, just heat it up with a blowtorch and it should come off, especially if you use a pulley puller. The rest of your story I believe is accurate ;)

Hey @diyeboard ,

What's the difficulty for you guys to also offer battery packs with higher end cells like Samsung 30Q and Sanyo 20700b?

Another question, why don't you offer more options for belt driven systems? Like 15mm wide belt systems, adjustable tension on the mounts, metal pulleys, 6374 motors? I think there is a gap in the market in terms of Chinese manufacturers for belt driven systems now that most manufacturers are going with hubs.

Absolutly true. I understand the higher cost for the battery pack, but a more variety for belt drive systems would be awesome. Actually the top would be if you could find a source for a direct drive system like carvon. The later I am afraid will stay a dream for a while :persevere:

[/quote]

It doesn't (yet) fit their business model of selling cheap kits with minimally required specs. Their drive trains are not that amp hungry compared to the typical setups you find here. Might change when they start offering vescs. Even then, the packs will most likely not use nickel strips and be of somewhat questionable quality like the current packs.

Was just scrolling through the thread where everyone was arguing over whether or not the belts can stretch (short answer yes they can, but it is not likely unless the belt is poorly made or already damaged in some other way that it would stretch enough to matter).  Most mounts have some room as a far as I know for sliding the motor mount itself at least a few mm for getting the correct tension.  If not like @epss4 mentioned you can add 'idler bearings' that help to wrap more of the belt/teeth onto the pulley, more contact = less likely to slip but can keep the belts under less tension which loads the bearings in the motor less (less friction and sideways/lateral forces on them)

I hope I am posting this in the right place. I’m looking for help.

I purchased a Riptide R1 (DIYeboard components) and upgraded the battery to the 10s2p with Sanyo cells from Meepo. I desoldered the 6s jumper for 10s and now I’m having issues where I’ll have plenty of battery, but I’ll hear “low battery” beeps and lose all throttle and braking control. When this happens, the remote shows one blinking light of battery before everything powers off. From there, I am unable to power on the board again until I charge it momentarily and then I can ride again.

I’m wondering if this could this be an overheating issue or something else

Any help would be appreciated.

Hi, I need help.
Place an order on July 10, 27 days have passed and my package has not yet arrived in Spain.
The seller tells me that it is the fault of customs and the problems of Trump and the EU :man_shrugging:.
He tells me that everything is fine and that I wait for 45 days, but then I lose the protection as a buyer that Paypal offers me.
What will I advise you? I do not like to reject the order and recover my money and try to skate with yourself, or trust this seller and wait for a kit.

Hi new to the forums. Located in Washington U.S. 
I have the 10s5p belt drive kit
Added the tensioner kit also. 
But recently I’ve been having high power output issues. Just wondering if anyone else is having issues like mine. I emailed the seller company. Waiting on response. 

Fully charged. Resynced remote to board. On highest setting. Will make one full pull but after braking. Just slowing down to let’s say make a turn. It will have low output. Like won’t even hit 12mph. I get off the board. Get back on and it goes back to normal. For about a block. Also braking is pretty much non exsistant when this happens. I’ve rechecked all the connections. I didn’t change anything. Just started happening about a week ago.

I have the exact same problem, I'm not sure where the issue is. I always assumed it was an issue with the motors.

When the board goes into this low power mode the motor makes a different noise too. It's bad when you are commuting on a busy street and this happens out of nowhere.

interesting. I think it could because it often happens after a while, usually not early on during the ride. What I usually do is keep breaking and accelerating until it comes back because my previous theory was that the motor got "stuck"

![image|177x84](upload://hxVyfEhEzgvuVZmHVw4x0QTe6LK.jpg)

I'm not sure if want to drill holes on the enclosure. The board not ready (since the pic I have some idlers and belt covers) still gonna wrap the cables in flexible cable wrap instead of tuck tape but currently like this:

Impossible to tell what weight would be safe. From the looks of it, there are gas bubbles in the aluminum cast. The break looks uneven with bubbles in it. That means that depending on the accidental structure of the bubbles, the truck will be relatively strong or weak. Then there is the unknown if these trucks are heat treated.

I'm using the dual belt drive and I seem to have a lot of resistance pushing, a magnitude higher compared to my other belt drives using Torqueboard components. The drive is also REALLY noisy when rolling!

I already lubed the bearings (including the flanged bearing) which helped very slightly, but the main issue seems to be misalignment of the gears causing significant noise. Anyone else have this issue?

Thanks for posting up. Exact same area I experienced the breakage. They are trying to charge me for postage. But when your product fails like this, it should be full free replacement. And plus I have lost confidence in the parts.

And yes they are cheaper parts than general market value, but I would expect an ESC or motor to fail before a structural failure like this

One of the issues I experienced with noise is the metal spacer in the wheel between the bearings. I put grease in there to help the noise on the metal spacer. Another factor for noise is the belt cover, this needs torqued down on the two belts, as this can rattle a lot.

In regards to rolling resistance, i only experienced more when I put the idler bearing in

@diyeboard hi Jason I approached yourselves through email, and you have offered a free replacement on the trucks, if I pay for postage I thank you for the offering.

But I think from a liability point of view, the trucks are suffering catastrophic failures on more than one occasion, as referenced above. 
To avoid negligence and to help save someone's life, especially if the truck hangar failed at speed, I think a recall on these parts would be reccomended. It would be terrible if a product you offer caused serious injury to a young person and caused injuries for life or a death.

Regards

I should have insisted on a new ESC when one motor channel stopped working due to overload. Just before that incident one of the connectors got a little bit loose and melted resulting in really strange behaviour of the whole thing. I made videos documenting this shit and he promised me that his techies will have a look on it but didn't respond for some time. After a reminder I got no response at all so this is it for me now with diyeboard stuff. I like the hub motors but I'll go for alternatives in the future. I don't trust their ESC any more at all.

Perhaps the biggest 'problem' here is not managing expectations. Cheaper products have to use cheaper materials and will never stand up to the same level of abuse as those from more expensive brands.

looking at where the screws for the motor hubs are located, they pretty much have a fatal design flaw in there. There is very little material left. To classify something as ''light use only'' due to design flaws, incorrect casting or wrong material choices is something should not be accepted. 

Why? It's playing with people's lives and it will in the end result in regulations being super strict or ESK8 being banned altogether due to the initial media coverage and resulting ''concern'' to protect the population.

@diyeboard. I just recieved your 6" AT Truck Kit and by default the motors are oriented under the deck. I want them oriented to the back, to get more clearance under the deck. So before I take the trucks and mount apart, I wanted to know if that is possible and how hard it is to do?

They worked great for a while but after a few months belt skipping is unavoidable, changing belts doesn't solve the problem and belt tension cannot be adapted .I can still use them but belts keep skipping when breaking hard.The big issue seem to be the quality of the trucks , some broke while riding. I never had any issue with the trucks (yet) and have very bad roads where i live. I agree with @808Chopz , they're great for occasional use., i like the motors though , they provide enough torque and speed (50kmh with 97mm's). I am selling my dual belt drive from diyeboard if you like. You'll only need to change the trucks to be on the safe side. Asking 50 Euro for the 2 5055 motors, 2 wheel and motor pulleys and a few belts.

Hey @rey8801. Regarding the fact that Meepo/wowgo/ownboard rate their motors at 250 watt and diyeboards rate theirs at 500 watts you said you’d do a comparison. Now that you’ve had them for some time, what do you think? Are they the same or is it really twice the power?

that being said , they sell the same esc as meeepo, with 3 choice of remote, their hub motor kit are good , with lots of choice and configuration , their battery maybe suck because its not 30Q  but for the price i think they are not that bad..
.but i don't think i will order from them anymore, order more than 5000$ like i said and can't give me remplacment part ? that just ridiculous and lack of respect i think.

They are essential the same chemistry, lithium with cobalt, manganese, nickel, etc. The name is referred to the housing. Lipo batteries are ones that has polymer pouch, while li-ion are usually metal like those 18650s. I guess people say lipo is “not safe” because polymer can be punctured more easily, while metal housing of lion is a bit more durable. In reality they both have reactive elements inside and are just as dangerous lol.

So I currently have 2500 TB motors 6355 190kv dual setup with a 10s2p.(used to be single drive, but now its dual) So for motor max, on the website, its rated for 80A. The battery is rated to be 20A-24A continuous output.

I'm currently running split ppm. Does that mean for each vesc programming, I can run at least 60A for motor max and -60A for motor min with battery max set to 10-12A?

Check to make sure you bought the ones with replaceable sleeves. The older model (the link you posted) are non-replaceable.

These are the ones that work with the sleeves that @Sn4pz posted:

The scary part is m board was working fine with one remote, but only on the fastest setting. When that remote stoped working last week I switched to my unused spare remote and the throttle sticks, and sometimes  the brakes don't even respond when fully charged. I have had to jump off the board going nearly 20mph and had the board keep going downhill, or when the throttle sticks had it keep going into the street  while I am rolling for my life. Jason said he would send a new vesc  when they release it and he didnt.

unfortunately, you are on your own. diyeboard won't help you. 

battery uses some weak, cheap cells. I would replace that first. with tires big like yours, it is not actually so strange that you get less than 10 miles on this battery. and not just that, you will feel voltage sag pretty quick after battery drops under 100%

next thing to replace is ESC. diyeboard sells probably oldest, most basic version of skateboard ESC. nowadays you can buy some great single/dual VESC variants for not so much. 

about those trucks and tires I don't know much, but I know they sold caliber copies which were really bad and more than few had them broken during ride.

I appreciate the info and that sounds like a plan to me I'm just trying to figure out the inconveniences. One day I'll get 15-16 miles and next day same route it drops to half I can see the battery being bad and I just get poor performance consistently but what is happening to me is just strange.

Last time this happened I went from having 3 of the 4 bars showing on board down to 2 and 1 in a matter of seconds while I tried to take it up a incline. I carry it home plug in and out and what do you know back to 3 bars. 

Tested the voltage today on the battery, didn't charge since it died on me and it was showing 37.4 volts. I even connected and ran motors full speed of course not under load and it dropped to 34.4 I imagine it would drop even more with me on it and incline but it crazy for me to think the ESC should regulate how much it pulls from the batteries so it doesn't just drain to the 31 volt shut off voltage?

## \#2428 Posted by: Tinp123 Posted at: 2019-09-18T06:02:55.480Z Reads: 71

```
what you are describing is voltage sag - temporary drop of voltage during harder discharge. every battery will have some sag, but this is exactly difference between good and bad cells. 


your esc will draw more current on inclines = bigger voltage sag. there is nothing you can do about it except get better battery. or try to take inclines slower, with slower acceleration. you could notice voltage sag when hard accelerating too. 


when it seems your battery dropped much lower than you expect, just stop and wait a little bit for battery to rise to real voltage.

Makes perfect sense but does that seem like a reasonable drop? Plus why so inconsistent prehaps.the speed and incline variation. I'm all for replacing the battery pack honestly I'm considering making my own but I want to confirm this battery pack is bad before I start shelling out more money.

Does anyone have any idea how I can confirm ?? Cell by cell check? BSM check? I'm pissed I spent all this money and I have this problem so I don't mind swapping but I want to be sure. Can it be possible the ESC is drawing too much power. I rather have slower uphill acceleration then have it pull a excessive amount and cause it to shut off completely and then I have to carry it home. That's the other stupid part once it stops it can power on and off as many times and I want and it won't start I have to plug it in to charger in literally a sec then power level reset to actual and board is operational.

yeah the battery is pretty cheap.  I have the same one.
I get ~30km on flats with 90mm hub motors which is pretty standard for 10ah battery.  with 8" pneumatics and hills, >10km is normal.

Simple test:
Do a range test with 15km/h max speed.  try to keep the speed as constant as you can (going around a park or something)
And do the same route going max throttle.  

The 2nd result should be alot worse range.
Also how heavy do you weigh?  I weight 140lbs.  If you're heavier, expect worse range/more battery sag
