Hi Folks, 

I'm in Brisbane, building esk8 battery packs in my off-season. I will continue indefinitely, just a little slower in the summer.
Currently taking expressions of interest for the next batch of cells, which I will order soon. lots of 30Q's and maybe a few others. 
Below are some photos of my current orders. happy to do Evolve upgrades or custom specs for a DIY build.

10s4p 30Q is $440AUD. 
10s5p 30Q is $490
12s5p 30Q is $575

Bestechpower BMS are available. Unfortunately, shipping and exchange rate stung pretty hard.
10s 80A $85
12s 80A $96
10s 40A(for charge only setup) $45
if you prefer another bms that's all good. just let me know so I can put the right plug on for you.
I'll have the spec sheets up soon

Fitting, shipping or extra work will add a few dollarydoos.
Other sizes available, inquire within.

Build details. after a lot of research on nickel strips and their amp ratings, this is what I've settled on. For the middle series connection, I use four strips of 10x.02mm with a smaller strip for the parallel. Outside will have 10 or 12 AWG copper wire soldered onto the middle of the parallel connection - two layers of 10x0.15.
I've also done a lot of test welds to make sure that I can get through both layers and the cell with each tap to ensure a strong, long lasting weld.

Balance wires are 26awg. I can crimp jst terminals/plugs on there. Evolve compatible balance plug is available.
Charge wires are 20awg

Choice of power connector. Deans T style for Evolve or XT60 (or whatever you fancy)

*Update - Round one Complete.
Round two - cells arrived
Round three - cells Arrived
Taking names for the next order. eta mid September

Hi @TinnieSinker,
Welcome mate, while some others will no doubt chime in on your battery design, only level 3 members can take money from forum members in advance of actually having the product ready to ship. These transactions are called a "group buy". You might need to edit your offer.
I had a look and didn't see the level 3 "regular" badge on your profile, sorry if I missed it.

Hi, looking at doing my evolve gt bamboo. What would be the best pack in 10s4p. Don‚Äôt won‚Äôt to cut out the deck as I‚Äôm 100kgs. Will just make a spacer. Are your packs the same size as stock ( only thicker ) and do you need the BMS or is it all marked to do it my self. Ps I‚Äôm only 2 hrs away in far north nsw. Cheers..

Hey mate, the 30Q's are the best all rounder choice for 10s4p. 

The pack in the pics is going in a bamboo gt very soon so I'll know for sure how well it fits then. we're just waiting on some connectors that will hopefully fit the evolve bms. if so the only thing you'll have to do it pop it in and solder the remaining negative(labeled) wires to the bms.
From what I've read, its just a 2mm spacer and it should fit nicely in the enclosure.

awesome, I grew up in NNSW :slight_smile:

Done deal!

certainly can. by using copper wire on the outside series connections, the pack is very flexible. The shrink tube adds some stiffness but not enough to worry about. I could shrink it in sections if you would like the most flex possible.

Hey buddy, signed up just so I could get in touch! I‚Äôm definitely interested in getting a pack from you for my CGT, I also live not far from you on the Gold Coast. Since there‚Äôs more room in the CGT compared to the BGT do you think a 5P version could fit without having to relocate and re drill a spot for the motor controller?

Also, there‚Äôs a huge amount of fake 30Q‚Äôs going around, have you sourced your cells from somewhere reputable?

Thanks and looking forward to gettting a pack from you.

Hey mate, I've seen pics of 10s5p and even bigger batts going into the carbon GT but haven't really looked into what is involved.

This order is coming from NKON, they seem to have the best rep

@Schulerbible good question! I've been meaning to put these details into the description.
10x0.2mm nickel for the series connection in the middle, with 10x0.1 or 0.15 for the parallel. since there is a 0.2 stip on each cell, the parallel seems less significant. 
the outside is 10x0.2 with a double layer for the middle two cells. copper wire is soldered in the middle to get the shortest distance of travel for the power through the nickel to the copper.

@Yanzo 3 10s4p so far. 4 more next week once the cells arrive. My background comes from 7 years in the RC hobby. transitioning to vesc and Li-ion was no problem. just a few months research :smile:

@Frenchy I'll have to look into shipping regulations. next available is mid-August

Hi, I will have more cells in 2-4 weeks. i wasn't going to order until the current bunch was built and sold but due to the high demand i will be ordering more very soon.

the bamboo gt needs a riser like this one as the new pack will be thicker.

Hi there TS, do your services run to diagnostics and or repair?

I have a GTX with a 10s4p made in Aus but he is in Perth I'm in Bris.

Its only had 4 runs 2 no problem but now both my R2 remotes which have software updates are dropping out and staying out. It won't reconnect without rebooting both board and remote and then lasts minutes. I haven't ridden under excessive load since the 10s4p, charged fast or otherwise abuse. Motor temp was 28c and 29c respectively riding easy.

Have Tinnies will travel.

Hey mars, that's quite the pickle you have! I don't have any experience with evolve remotes, only what I've read. 
I could run the multimeter over it, maybe it's a lose wire or cold solder? We could also put a watt meter in there and check the volts under load. If that doesn't uncover the problem we'll at least be able to tell if it's the battery or another component.

Will work for tinnies üòÇ

A lot of the 30q‚Äôs from Asian sites are rewrapped cells, some Australian stores selling 30q‚Äôs got them from Asia due to their price and again are unknowingly selling these fakes. 

@TinnieSinker has done the right thing buying from NKON, they have a very good track history of selling genuine cells.

You should borrow a friends battery, swap it out to test and then if it still doesn‚Äôt work give it to evolve hq @ Varsity to ‚Äúservice‚Äù. Definitely send it back with a genuine battery otherwise they won‚Äôt help.

Just fyi, even out of warranty they only charge $100 to diagnose, find the fault and if need be replace the upper motor controller board which is the one that‚Äôd be fried. Their service team are very helpful and reasonable. üëç

Loving the progress! Looks like you have a great setup too. Any idea when you think my pack will be ready? Honestly no rush, just wondering when I‚Äôll need to get the cash ready. 

Also, since I‚Äôll be seeing you in person to pickup in Brisbane is there any chance of you soldering those negative wires to the existing BMS I‚Äôll bring? Again no stress if you‚Äôd rather not, just thought I‚Äôd ask!

Cheers.

Hi Pokwer, thanks for the advice. I spoke to them if I send an email detailing the problem they will send me a motor controller about $190. Although the GTX is still under warranty just, I'm not looking to fudge it.

I agree their service team are very helpful,  giving me better deals than advertised and throwing in little extras like bearings, washers, reply paid post, even a set knee pads.There is a lot of negative talk but in my experience they've been second to none. Of course I'm not asking them for there source codes lol. 

I have 3 second hand GTX's 5 cycles 30 cycles and 350. The 350 cycles is the problem ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..but its gives
me the opportunity to **modify** _haha_. Luckily I've hit the ground running buying them at half price. The best bang for buck I could find here.

I would love to have a LaCroix...Carvon ‚Ä¶.Psychotiller‚Ä¶.longhairedboy‚Ä¶..Raptor.....Kaly-nyc  or Janux-esk8.....UNIKBOARDS....DIY torqueboards......++++ ect **sorry I'm drooling**. But with the exchange rates, freight, GST, import duties.
Its nice to dream: :sunglasses:

Haha you're pretty much in the same situation as me... My first Evolve was a BGT and I got that for $500 which had problems but was still within warranty and luckily the previous owner kept the receipt in the box so they fixed the issues free of charge.

Am currently rebuilding a CGT which I got for only $100 but was in unknown condition, the carbon board itself was fine with no marks/cracks. The motor controller ended up working once I added a battery, ditto the motors work fine too so really happy to have this build with one of these custom 18650 batteries considering it didn't come with a battery. Plus as you'd know since you're wanting an 18650, their batteries suck anyway.

Yeah I probably wouldn't buy an Evolve if I lived overseas, compared to the other boards on offer they're definitely the best priced and with Australian consumer law on our side their servicing/repairs are really good. I'd love to get the new Raptor but yeah that price is just too much, she's a tank though and from what I've seen online is built like one.

Have recently starting looking as the Kaly-NYC and also Trampa. I like the look of the Trampa wheels so much that I got a set of the Superstar Hubs with 6.5" Urban Treads tyres for my Carbon GT build.

You won't need the whole motor controller the bottom board (the one with the heatsink on it) never really fails, it's always the upper board. The upper has the plugs to the motors/batteries etc plus the bluetooth adapter which is what pairs to your controller. They definitely only charge $100 for it, if you need help getting them to reach that price I can send you through service receipts confirming the price. But then again if it's still under warranty just send them the board and get it for free!

If you ever feel generous and want to unload one of those GTX's keep me in mind lol ;-)

I don't know about you but I can't find an active Gold Coast/Brisbane esk8 riders group to go on group rides with? Evolve do one on the GC very rarely and I don't like the fact it's limited to Evolve boards. If there's enough of us in here from Bris/GC we should arrange to go on some rides together? Is always better in a group!

Have a good one.

Bris/GC group eSk8 rides Shit yeah, I'm new to esk8 but I believe Jebe and TinnieSinker are in Bris.....

If there is some interest we could list our favourite rides, group vote then work our way through the list. The winner responsible for useful info eg; safety terrain local knowledge.
Do you want to start a thread, topic, post, expression of interest?

Already sounds like a lot of work responsibility 
Mabey we should just hook-up and ride. lol


Yes the Kaly-NYC and  Trampa look insanely good.
I'll never forget when the Evolve GTX arrived from "eBay"  street mode look.
It took my breath away, I near shit myself.

"unload one of those GTX‚Äôs" :joy: at the moment it would be like cutting off  my left‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
But if its to happen you get first option lol

Bris/GC group eSk8 rides ‚Ä¶..Lets do it.
Even if it's just us hahahaha

Are Yes apologies TinnieSinker for being off topic....If your up for it I'll hit you up for my next battery.

all good, Im down for group rides! 

I was finally able to fit a pack into BGT last night. all went well. the bms plug fits nice and snug without trimming.
I didn't realise they used 14awg in there. the 10awg made it 2mm too wide. had to trim a little but no problem. I'll use 14 or 12awg in the future.
The new pack is also a bit longer but with the 10mm riser, we were able to relocate the BMS on top of the motor controller.

Progress update: 
Slight delay waiting for supplies to arrive. I wasn't expecting the cells to arrive so soon plus i thought i had enough for now. i was wrong! 

@dareno done, waiting for 12s bms
@Fox210 should have more wire by the end of the week
@Pokwer waiting for nickel - 2ish weeks
@peteprez as above

round 2 - cells ordered, arriving in 2-4 weeks
@kalebludlow     
@wazza11
@Andr3s
+Non-esk8 customer

Round 3 - ordered after round one is complete
@Wraith   
@mars ?
hopefully, I haven't missed anyone.

@Pokwer will solder for tinnies =)

Wait what, how can you do 12S when the battery Evolve BMS only supports 10S I thought? Also that'd change the voltage to not be 4.2 x 10 = 42v (fully charged) and instead be 4.2 * 12 being 50.4v fully charged? I would have thought that the BMS would then only charge to 42V leaving the cells under charged?

Have just re-read your message, by nope I think you're actually saying no to it being an Evolve and not a no to me. It threw me off when you said Carbon, I just thought you meant Carbon GT lol.

Only a Bamboo GT so far. 

heres how the battery guy does it with a 10s5p. looks like he takes the heatsink off the bms and re-installs it upside down.
10s4p should be an easy swap

Thanks for clarifying mate, hmm from that video the motor controller doesn‚Äôt need to be relocated for 10s5p. Hate to muck you around but since my smaller 4p will be ready in 2‚Äôish weeks and the other packs can be made a week after that is there anyway I could change to a 10s5p and get mine done in the second batch instead?

I don‚Äôt want to have any regrets that I didn‚Äôt get the extra 1p over those 10 in series when I had the chance!

Could you let me know how much a 10S5P will end up costing? Also, for any new customers it's probably worthwhile editing your first post and listing the different prices for different combinations based on what people requested/ordered. This way it saves them having to read the whole thread and trying to find someone else who ordered the same combination they're after.

@Yanzo PM incoming. I'll put you on 'the list' when I get home

@Lemming late August at this stage. I haven't tried to ship any yet but I'm thinking if I call it a Powerbank and ship it via road freight it should be fine.

@peteprez  I had a feeling you might ask that haha I'll make it work. 

I need to sell two more packs so I can order the next round and add the extra cells to these orders.

Also, I'm thinking of ordering from China, Basen technology co. Same place I bought cells for my pack. I've tested the discharge and temp against the spec sheet and it matched perfectly.
Main benefit is that it'll only take 1-2 weeks to arrive. 
Figured I should put it out there, see what you guys think.

Hey mate, appreciate you being so transparent about who you‚Äôre ordering from. Personally I‚Äôd prefer to get my pack from the cells you ordered from NKON, but that‚Äôs just because of all the positive feedback they get from the community.

But where you buy the cells from is entirely up to you. Again thanks for even keeping us in the loop about who you‚Äôre considering to buy the 30Q‚Äôs from. It‚Äôs very refreshing and I‚Äôll have confidence in buying your pack either way. üëç

Hey @TinnieSinker do you think you can you make me a 10s5p with BMS before you slow down please.


I have a  @Hummie  round three wood and carbon deck group buy on the way in a few  weeks.

@psychotiller will provide the enclosure custom made for these decks.
The Psycho's arc V2 enclosure with wire channel includes all electronics  power switch, battery meter, anti-spark installed. The setup will be using focboxes so the 10s5p will fit. Some flex is necessary.


I'll get some more info from @psychotiller on the enclosure so the pack can be closer to ready to roll if you can do it.  https://psychotiller.com/product/psychos-arc-v2

The @Hummie deck has been routed for electronics and battery.
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-wood-carbon-decks-group-buy-round-3-110-shipped-us/43245/1264

 

I don't expect anything landed here before 4 to 6 weeks.
I can fix you up to cover costs if you need. 
Still need help to sort out the 10s4p.


Cheers

@TinnieSinker  I am upgrading my current setup (Focbox & 6374) to a (Dual Focbox 6374) and if possible wanted to have an absolute beast with 60a (battery) each motor. I won't be doing this upgrade for a while and wanted to go all out if I was going to buy a pack. I can only fit a 10s4p so if I wanted a 120a battery it would have to be made out of Sony Konion vtc6 cells. 

Would you ever consider making a pack out of these cells?
Would a BMS for 120a even exist? 
Would this 10s4p be a fortune to make?

Just wondering, Thanks.

@MaxMalouf That would indeed be a beast! 
Something I've noticed after using the Metr Bluetooth for a while now is that real-world amp usage isn't necessarily reflected by the amp rating on the pack. While it will have better performance than 30Q's, even if you do somehow pull 120a, it will only be burst.
For comparison, my board is 10s4p 30Q with Focbox's and evolve AT setup. I did some hill tests the other week. there are a couple 24% hills near me, the most I pulled was a peak of 58A with an average of 30-40A. The biggest hill I went up, which was a minute of varying inclines, pulled between 30-50 amps for that duration.
Similar results for off-road/grass hills and such.

So obviously your board will be different, your motors are much larger and I don't know what your setup is. this is just to give you an idea of what to expect. I think these cells and those motors will really shine when you're at low or medium speed on a grass/dirt hill and trying to go faster(or just go at all) - that's when mine struggles!

I'm not trying to talk you out of it! What I'm getting at is I don't think you'll need a 120a BMS. as long as it can handle bursts of 120 without shutting off the power. The 80A cuts power at 120 or 140 I think. I know they do a 90A version so I'll look into that, maybe they do higher!

Getting the vct6 cells is a little more complicated as the nkon site for international sales only has the button top. There's a guy in Melbourne that bought a shit ton of these cells in flat top, so much that they only cost him slightly more than what i get the 30Q's for. He builds esk8 packs as well, I'll find his details.

@TinnieSinker Yeah I live in Brisbane around the Toowong area so it is extremely hilly where I am. A 32% hill is around the corner from my house so I really want to be able to eat up the hills, it would be great if that 80a BMS could do the 120a but if I really wanted to I could use 2x 60a BMS for the 10s4p. haha, maybe a bit overkill. What is that guy's name/contact?

I have a Bamboo gt AT for 2 months now and all is going well for now, I decided to go this route instead of building one, but have done the research on vescs etc. I understand the limitations of the evolve battery and would be interested in a replacement 18650 pack in a few months when my original pack dies. will you still be making these in a couple of months or do I need to order one now for use later?
I would make one myself but I don't have a spot welder and to buy one for a one off job doesn't make a lot of sense to me!
I have seen a clip of a cgt board with a external battery stuck on top of the board just wired in parallel with the original battery which got me thinking
if the charge current for a lion is about 1c and you attach a fully charged bat to a drained bat without some sort of current limiter that would not be good for the original battery!
but if you used a couple of tool batteries (thinking of Aldi 4ah bats $40 I read these use samsung cells probably not 30q but should be rated for high discharge rate for tools)
2 of these in series (36v) paralleled to a charged original battery would be a cheap way to extend range and original battery life, any thoughts on this??

These batteries aren't wired in parallel, they're just a 6s (22.2v nominal) lipo between 10-20AH connected to a dc boost step-up inverter dialed up to match the same voltage as your AC charger. So 42v @ 2A to match the non fast charger version of Evolve's charger. The step-up inverter than just plugs in to the existing charging port, so in essence it's just always trickle charging like it does at home.

What you are describing via the charge port is not what I am talking about
the Aldi bat is 5s2p made up of 2000mah 18650 cells as far as I can tell But that aside
what I am proposing is wiring a 2nd 36v battery directly into the output of the original battery in parallel of course so the end result will simply be a higher capacity battery, the bms will still only monitor the original cells and the external battery will have to be managed on their own charger, overall less current draw on the original cells may mean a longer life, this would only be a cheap stop gap measure as a quality replacement with good 18650 cells is the best way to go I feel
just such a waste of a perfectly good evolve battery to do it now!

I was responding in relation to you saying you've seen a clip of a CGT board with external battery on top. Those packs which are quite popular at the moment all wire to the charging port and not directly to your existing batteries BMS or motor controller.

What you're asking for is messy and will still result in you needing to open/void up your existing battery to wire additional packs to the same terminals as the existing battery. If you're going to do that you may as well just be done with it and get a whole new 18650 with your current batteries bms and use your left over prismatic cells in a booster pack? That way your existing evolve battery has a use and isn't a waste?

hey man, I will continue building just a little slower in the summer.

I'm working on a piggyback battery at the moment actually. the kind that goes through the charge port like @Pokwer mentioned.

I guess its possible to connect another pack in parallel. generally, its best to use two identical batteries for parallel but if they both have a bms maybe it would work. I'm not really sure.

Hey @TinnieSinker, do you solder to the strips before or after you weld them to the cells?

Hey man, a bit of both actually. before buying a better soldering iron I had to do it before welding. now that I've upgraded to more power and a better tip, I can solder on after welding without the cells heating up more than 30-40c. Soldering in between the cells and using a flux pen make a big difference but I think the shape of the tip helped the most.

Hi I'm also in Bris and need a new battery for my CGT. Has anybody given feedback on range and hill climbing ability for different packs? I'm down to 10km range and hills sap the battery down to eco mode after about 7km. Would the new batteries work ok with evolves standard and fast charger? Thanks

@asianrambo @Zook hey guys, so the CGT can kinda fit a 10s5p. its a super squeeze. @Pokwer is working on a riser that will make it so much easier. otherwise, a 10s4p is an easy fit.

you'll need to take the BMS from the stock battery and attach it to the new one. desolder 3 wires then resolder.

with my 10s4p I get around 22km with AT setup and easy throttle or 18ish if i'm hard on it. curious for others to chime in here too :+1:

Hey all, yeah I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend anything bigger than a 10S4P in a CGT unless you make a spacer/riser to lower the motor controller and it‚Äôs heatsink so the original BMS can sit on top of the lowered motor controller. 

I‚Äôm happy with my final design, there‚Äôs enough clearance for the motor and bms wires and have done a couple test prints @ 50% infill. The final will be 100% infill with ABS since PLA is just too brittle.

Am currently on holidays but am keen to get back and do some tests with the spacer and @TinnieSinker 10S5P he made me. üëç

ok my answer for a range extender
using 18v 4ah tool batteries and dc to dc converter, plan to set current to around 4amps to charge port which means battery should last around 20mins given some losses in converter etc. 4 amps may not be much but will be interesting to see the results, mock up done just waiting on dc converter![20180905_123612%5B1%5D|690x388](upload://uqfsyLWlOVoBKY3ofHYVYyPH2yX.jpg)![20180905_123646%5B1%5D|690x388](upload://qIRYPEZQMJ2w09G1Y9WsHcJpSg1.jpg)![20180905_123827%5B1%5D|690x388](upload://fM0S7MygevPq7S2jazEuMiYOupJ.jpg)

Also Brisbane based and not fussed about travelling anyway so it‚Äôs easy for me if that works for you. Oh and if you could estimate how long it‚Äôd be before then can you let me know? In the process of saving for this atm so gives a good idea of how long it‚Äôs gonna take to get that sorted. Cheers man.

@Wizzee @ajplant96 @AlexBE

Hey guys, i'll only be doing a couple more this year as my main work has picked up already. If you're keen send a PM with your board type/battery size and your phone number, or any way of contacting you outside of here(people keep disappearing months later when the battery is done)

Not familiar with the older carbon boards. it should be possible but lets have a look inside sometime.

I probably wont have time to do any installations this year.

Some recent builds. I've started putting the balance wires in the middle with this neat ribbon cable. makes for a much cleaner build and its flat on the top and bottom

Hmm sounds like @MaxMalouf wanted a pack made out of cells which TS didn‚Äôt have which was why he paid for them up front which is reasonable considering @TinnieSinker doesn‚Äôt want to be stuck with them and have the financial liability.

@MaxMalouf, you should have handled this privately via messages and not just come out in his thread saying this. Jai‚Äôs very honest and he‚Äôs charging a very fair price considering what others are asking for. It sounds like the issue here is that you wanted different cells, no one else has had to put money up front for their 30Q packs.

After i sort some shit out, like where i'm going to be living next month, I want to get stuck into another project and my day job will be in full swing. 

So I think it would be better if i say now that i won't be building much after these ones, than say i can and not deliver. 

those that are just missing out, You'll be the first to know when i build again!

or... i could add $200 to the price tag and it would compete with my day job :wink:

its for discharge as well. you'll notice in the last pic there are three black wires for the bms. fairly normal as far as i know.

on charge only packs, both power leads go straight to the plug and i add a second negative wire, same as the little red one, for the bms.

Now that i have all the materials sourced i can keep good stock levels to avoid delays like I've had in the past! 
There may be slight increase in pricing due to our dollar sucking ass

I was aiming to test out how far I could get on a charge with average riding as a bench mark for future rides. I was at about 40% on the battery gauge (previously this has been about 3.6v/cell) and went for a ride, it seemed kinda sluggish going up a very small bridge, I looked down and saw the display was at 12% (after about 1.5km since 40%) I thought my batteries must be about to hit the vesc cut off of 3.2v so slowly started heading home. I had to push the last 800m or so. 

When I got home I tried checking my cells voltage through the charge port as usual and it wouldn‚Äôt read a voltage, that‚Äôs when I knew something was very bad as my bms cuts of at 2.8v/cell. I quickly pulled the case off and checked all cells the first 4 were at 3.2v but then two were at 2.5v and another 3 were at 3.6v and a further 3 at 3.4v. This imbalance meant that the pack voltage averaged out to 38.4v cut off on the vesc which thought all cells were at 3.2v.

I am now going to try and design a specially monitor for people that use charge only bmss that will beep or notify you when your battery is getting low, it will monitor individual cell voltages instead of the pack as a whole.

I will try to revive my pack but it will get repurposed as a portable charger/power pack as it won‚Äôt handle high currents very well anymore I don‚Äôt think. 

Sorry @TinnieSinker for derailing your thread a little, I guess this could be some valuable info for some of your customers too though on what bms to use

Yes I guess that‚Äôs possible. I checked them yesterday and they had rose back up to safe voltages?!? The lowest was 2.98v all others were above 3.15v, I still refuse to trust them for high current applications though even though they charged up to 3.75v just fine and self balanced all within 0.01v. 

I might just use it as a portable esk8 charger or phone power bank for when I go camping

Well I would just like to report absolutely no issues at all with my 12s4p from @TinnieSinker
Going strong and still packing a massive punch right throughout the discharge cycle.  Using a huge bestech discharge bms and working well.  No cut outs or over voltage issues. 
Charged everyday for the last 3 months and ridden like it was stolen.

do you normally charge up to 100%? i know its not recommended to prolong battery life but most bms's will only balance if the cells go over 4.2v

Yeah always, I‚Äôd prefer to just charge to 4.15v but the bms only balances at 4.18 or something like that. 

I also charged fully this time as I wanted to see how far I could get. Sometimes I just charge to 4v if it‚Äôs a short ride and stuff like that but usually every 2-3 rides I do a full charge to balance the cells

Like i read above i to got a battery made in buy the guy in WA and it seems the first lot of cells as per the evolve r2 remote screen drops out of range, but when its fully charged it balances out and seems okay.  I was hoping to get in contact with you to see if you could take a look at it or replace the entire paralell pack or fix the bad weld/cell etc as the electronics seem all fine.  its using 30q cells.

Thanks

Na just had a 50 cell battery pack made zero form WA designs for a cgt.  All was going good for a while but now cell 1 drops to say 32 volts when the rest remain at 38 but when its all charged up they are all balanced.  So im thinking its a bad cell or weld.  I msged him just saying i think i got a bad cell showed him a screen shot and he instantly blocked me on fb,  the battery has been performing for a few months so i really just need someone to load test a few cells and replace and it will be good as new.  Happy to pay anyone even for diagnostic time just to fix a couple of cells.  Obviously the guy who made it isnt interested in helping.

Sorry to hear mate, he was always far too expensive and wasn't interested in discussing with the esk8 community anything he'd designed. It's a pretty dog move to charge a premium, happily take your money but then offer no support and then block you...

You obviously know the issue is either a bad cell or a bad weld so if I were you I'd at least cut open the heat shrink and see if you can see anything visually. If not then trace which pack of 5 cells are the faulty bunch by measuring the voltage on the balance wires... Inspect those 5 cells and worst case remove that pack from the series and remove the 5 cells from the nickel strips to individually load test the cells.

The easier way would be to just discard that whole 5 pack of cells and get someone to spot weld a new one with new cells to then swap out and add it back to your existing 10 packs in series... You're only needing to solder 3 wires after that...

Hey mate, the best fit and most popular is a 10s4p with 30Q's, which is 12AH. 

fitting isn't too hard. bit of soldering, spacer for the enclosure and a riser for the ESC helps a lot.

Since the whole enclosure needs to be spaced away from the board you don‚Äôt need to worry about adding the extra spacer on the motor controller, the extra spacing for the cells gives enough clearance for the bms on the motor controller.

You only need the motor controller spacer for the GTX since the deck is hollowed out and the 30Q cells fit in a pack as is, ditto with the Carbon GT.

The pic shows my old BGT with the enclosure spacer only. üëç

Haha all good, no there‚Äôs a good model on Thingiverse which is broken up into 4 pieces so it can fit on most 3D printers. My enclosure was about 4mm longer and wider so just had to make a couple changes before printing so it‚Äôd fit.

Can you give some thought on assembling 2 joined packs totalling 10S10P which is split into 2 x 50 packs? One for inside the Carbon GT and the other in a custom enclosure I‚Äôll attach to the bottom? Still need to have the balance wires going to the same Evolve plug to use the BMS like before. Will perhaps relocate the power switch from the Carbon deck so we can use that to run the wires to join the packs?

With AT‚Äôs there‚Äôll still be loads of clearance, it‚Äôll kinda be like a bamboo GT with cells attached to the bottom while also inside the deck as usual too. Hahah.  ü§ô

Range is super subjective, the biggest factor with range would be how much elevation/hills there are on your ride. Also street gives you double the range vs AT.

Evolve's 10S1P packs do offer their full advertised capacity of 10AH, I've done load tests to confirm it.

In real world terms, with a 10S4P which is all you can fit on a GTX you're going from 10AH to 12AH. 30Q's in 4P have a higher amp draw than the original Evolve prismatic cells so you won't notice voltage sag as quickly.

Range is subjective, and battery capacity advertisements are often vague also. The Evolve packs are 10AH, but only if you have a low load current. If you do a real specification like 10AH @ 10A >3.2V/cell , they can't do it. Even with low power like 200W, the cells will trip the BMS before 8Ah.

It seems it would require make the battery enclosure longer and also routing the board to make room for the stacked BMS.  I have zero experience in this but would be willing to try, any thought would be appreciated.

I had also considered alternatively buying a Carbon GT as if Im not mistaken these can fit 10s5p, only requiring a spacer for the heat sink.

Here is a useful link i found for GTX 10s5p upgrade
https://evolveforums.com/threads/gtx-battery-upgrade-10s5p-30q.2685/

Could I also ask, if I want to keep my old battery, would I need to order one of the alternate BMS you mentioned earlier in the post?  Are these fully compatible? And would this then make the battery plug and play no soldering required (on my part)

Thanks Again!

interesting! i didn't know it had been done. seems like a bit of work but if you're up for it, i'll happily sell you the battery. in fact i have 1 10s5p left instock.

another option would be to replace the enclosure. I have one from @Eboosted that fits the bgt and will hold a 10s5p. i think its the universal 62cm enclosure. although you'd have to cut a hole for the heat sink so still some work to do.

Theres a chance i'll get around to building a vacuum forming box big enough for long enclosures. stranger things have happened!  

the CGT is the easiest to upgrade

with the old battery, you could put a bms on it. a cheap one might suffice, depends on what you want to use the battery for

Would love to get my gtx battery upgraded , would be a cheaper  way then buying newer version . I don't have the slightest clue how to install a new battery pack though. 

If anyone knows someone  who does upgrades and installations around sydney/ wollongong  area that would be awesome. If not i have three options  learn how to install new battery,  stick with current setup or just  buy the new GTR.

its not super hard to install. maybe i'll make up a guide the next i do one. but watch some how to solder wires and plugs videos on youtube and see if its something you feel like doing

although now i think about it, might be cheaper to ship your old battery to me than buying a soldering iron

pretty average soldering iron, about $40. sending me your old battery is about $20-25.

Part of the installation is taking the BMS off the old battery and putting onto the new one. If i do that part for you then all you have to do is put the riser under the esc/heatsink and plug the battery in. ezpz

The process is covered loads online, either you solder 3 wires to the bms from the new battery or you send the battery in and get TinnieSinker to do it. It doesn't sound like you're too confident so the later option is probably the way to go.

Hey Tinnie, I've recently got into e-skating in Brissie on a secondhand Bamboo GT, and now understand why a battery upgrade is such a good idea. I've read your thread and you mentioned you'd be able to do a few more upgrades around this time of year. Would we be able to chat about doing a 10s4p 30Q upgrade? Cheers

Don't undercut yourself @Wizeartz , from the photos you've got a quality single piece riser which is perfect for BGT's. Any 3D Printed version will be much more brittle and printed in multiple pieces so much less watertight. Also you're the first person I've seen in the esk8 community offering this part lasercut. I charge $40AUD for the 3D printed version of this with 100% infill using PLA+. Takes 15 hours in total printing 4 separate parts with 100% infill which is why I charge that price...

Your solution is much more elegant and again like I said much more watertight when the plastic enclosure is reattached to the deck. If people want to nickel and dime you then just pass on them, it's their loss.

Hey mate, the battery enclosure of the gtx and gt are exactly the same, the difference is that the battery pack is thicker and the GTX deck has been routed out to fit the thicker 10AH pack. Because of that you don't need to lower the whole enclosure to fit a 10S4P upgrade since the deck is already routed out. You just need to lower the motor controller only so the BMS can sit on top, the same as you do for 10S5P on a Carbon GT.

Hello and welcome!

the easiest way to get max range in a BGT is with a 10s4p with 35E cells. that give you the same 14AH battery as the GTR. This way we can use all the stock electronics too

Hello and welcome!

Lately most people with CGT's have been going for the 35E cells since we can fit a 10s5p in there. That will give you 17.5AH up from 10AH and 50A power output, which is 10 more amps than the new GTR. 
The other option is the 30Qs, 15AH and 75amps output. this one will have almost zero voltage sag but less range

This will be $510 + 20 for the ESC riser and if you need i can do the install for $50

Hi TinnieSinker. This is a great service you are offering! Can you give me a price for a 10sp2 and a 10sp3 please? I havn't decoded which one I will go with yet but need something smaller as I'm building a short board.

Hi, is there any chance you would ship to nz. I am guessing it isn't cheap but am willing to pay as im guessing its faster and cheaper than from the USA. 
If you are able too could you give me a price fro a 10s4p 30q for a bamboo gtx. Cheers
