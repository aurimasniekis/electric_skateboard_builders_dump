I ordered 4 UNIK dual motor mounts with kegel wheel pulley kits. I was planning on using them for boards for friends, but I have over ordered and demand is not what I was hoping it would be. My loss is your gain. These cost me about 375 shipped and they are brand new. I would like to get 375 shipped, open to offers. With shipping costs and paypal fees I will be selling at a loss. If you want the best motor mounts/wheel pulley combo available with 2 day shipping let me know.

If Iâ€™m not mistaken I think the price of $375 is for 1? LHB sells the mount only for $180, so Iâ€™m guessing including trucks, belts, and pulleys, itâ€™s $375 for 1 set

People just need to test your board, once they test it they will be hooked!

Nothing is more adictive than an electric skateboard or crack

It's like any toy in life, if it's expensive, you are going to try to convince yourself at all costs that you don't need one, that you might buy it and end up not use it ever, that there are more important things you do need. Weeks later you will buy it anyways

Yes I would ship to Canada. But I would have to add 10 dollars for shipping. It's more expensive to ship between countries.

I'd like to but I've wasted lots of money on parts that i can't use. Plus im still saving up for a second motor, custom battery pack and a new enclosure. The trucks and mounts are nice I just can't justify dropping 375 bucks just yet.

Sunnyvale :) sent you PM, yet idk as our site was a bit wonky earlier

seeking a full UNIK kit (motors and riser too) for the Pulseboards CF deck I bought here on our forums:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/pulseboards-carbon-fiber-board-with-integrated-enclosure-price-drop/64588/21

figured if you have this kit still for sale, I could help a brother out.  

was planning on buying the motors, riser, etc. from UNIK too, unless you have these too by chance - thanks my friend

well, since you have such impeccable taste :dark_sunglasses:  

all-UNIK motors, kit and wiring,
METR, Photon controller, 
dual Enertion FOCs
blue Otang Kegel 77s
blue Bones Super Swiss 6 bearings
front Avenue truck, hanger re-painted acid green,
Riptide guts (neon green, match the Kegel hub)
rear Caliber hanger, replaced with Caliber stock acid green,
motion-sensing O LED taillight, and, 
a custom, fritted, midnight blue-stained walnut lid by @treenutter (once we get the CAD file for his Jarvis to cut it)
with gold-plated hardware (stock Caliber)

My week-old Verreal 10S3P 'kabernet kruiser' build was claimed by my wife this weekend in Napa, and so like any perfectly normal man, I've dutifully convinced myself I have grounds to build a replacement lol thanks @Jreamer
