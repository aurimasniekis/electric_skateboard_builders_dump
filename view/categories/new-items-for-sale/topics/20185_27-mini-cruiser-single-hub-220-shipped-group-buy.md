Found a new mini board with a single hub motor. reminds me of the blink lite.
Its small, and cheap Interested in testing it out if a few others would like to split shipping costs for a small gb.

Specs:
7 ply Maple deck 27" with kicktail.
10-12 mph 
7 mile range (I expect 3-4)
single 70mm 300w hub motor with hall sensors.
tkp skate trucks
24v 2.2ah = about 50whr
1.5 hour charge time.
4kg = 8.8 lb

$220 Shipped in the US. or $200  + shipping.
just need a few to make shipping worth it, sooner the better! 
after I place the order it should take about 1 week to get them, then 2-5 days to you.

I've seen duals, but they would cost around $350. also much heavier and performance is still just toy level. 

I like this because its simple, and lightweight. I don't think it makes sense to do mini hubs like these for performance.
