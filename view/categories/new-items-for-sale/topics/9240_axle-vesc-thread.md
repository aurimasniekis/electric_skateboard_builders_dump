## You read that right.

I would like to introduce to the eSk8 community **[Axle](http://goaxle.com)**, a new high-end manufacturer of the VESC. All of our VESC's are put together on-site and extensively tested before being shipped out to a client. For a couple of months now, we've been trying to streamline our manufacturing process to reduce costs without compromising quality. 

We know that Vesc's are tricky, especially for people just getting into the game. That's why we'll repair your VESC free of charge (just pay return shipping) for the first time, no questions asked. Afterwards, we will offer repair services for free for 24 months. You'll only have to pay for the components.

So some things about our VESC"s:
-We apply conformal coating to all of our VESC's to protect it when things get a little...rough :wink:
-Caps. at C37 and C51 and C18 have been upgraded to a higher capacitance to handle more powaa
-Each Vesc is carefully inspected to prevent the formation of solder bridges, that can lead to shorts. 

We're a running a pre-order sale for those eager to jump in early. The sale price is $83 USD.

## Now for some FAQ

Q.  I don't see any pictures? Where tf are they?
A. We'll post some on our site and on this thread soon. We're still getting shipped our components; and all of the small qty. of VESC's made have been sold to a few members on this thread.

Q. So how do they look like?
A. Our Vesc's are colored with a matte black solder mask and white silkscreen. sexy.

Q.I live in Afghanistan, can I still buy from you?
A. Sure! Just send us an [email](http://goaxle.com/contact/) about your order and we'll be happy to sort your international order out for you.

Q.What if i change my mind after I pre-order a VESC from you?
A. Don't sweat it. We'll offer you a full refund of your purchase if your order hasn't shipped yet. 

Q.What kind of connectors are on the VESC?
A. For our pre-orders, we are not offering any connectors on our VESC's. If you need any, you can send us an [ email](http://goaxle.com/contact/) about your order.  Update: We will include 5.5 mm gold connectors and XT-60's connectors with all VESC's

Q.So I pre-ordered, when will I get my Vesc's
A. After the pre-order deadline, we will ship out orders within 2-4 weeks depending on pre-order sales.

Q. What type of candy do you like?
A. Sour. Patch. Kids. :D

**Pre-Orders will end on 9/15/16. Vesc's will cost are regular reail price of 110USD afterwards.**

So when you say your VESC do not come with connectors does that mean any wires at all and I will have to solder it myself?

Good to have another contender in the ring.

What percent or per-board $ is going to Vedder to support his innovation?  (thinking v6 in particular)

Best of luck!

@chris.hunt It will have silicon wires., just not any connectors such as Xt-90's and so.
@Pantologist I'll get on that (fixed!)
@Sean depends where you are in the world. Send us an email and we can give you a number.
@sl33py We make them all in NJ, USA! Shipping costs will be the same as when you bought them. Ie; if you paid 7.35 for shipping, you'll pay 7.35 to send it back. pre-orders sales will not be donated to Vedder. We are giving them out almost at cost, and we need a little more room for expenses. Once we go into regular sales, we will donate 20% of the profit to Vedder.

Yep! Besides caps, we've also made sure we've done some basic stuff like cut the pins on P1 so people don't kill their VESC. We're always following closely on issues presented on forums like these so that we can try and prevent them in production.

We've tested our VESC's with a 12s rig and they do alright. I won't lie, they get a little toasty. I would want to avoid using motors going over 60kERPM. This might burn of your DRV. I'd recommend that you shouldn't use ANY MOTOR higher then 200kv. That's a no-no.

Just checked our system, there are no orders that old waiting to ship. You need to email support@enertionboards.com with an order id, using this forum in this way won't be much assistance to you. 

Also note, enertion offers a 12 months instant replacement warranty & the VESC are in stock in US now with the NEW Upgraded capacitor boards & xt60 connectors included.

So it is the same as all the other vesc out there... You've just change a few 50v caps and put "quality" as a stamp.... 

 I don't want to sound rude, but with no major modification you will get the same kind of problem as everyone

Good Luck

Well i guess if you want to put it that way...sure. But I'd like to remind you that the VESC isn't a project of mine. There's no doubt in my mind that anyone with dedication can build one on their own. The difference is the warranty that comes with these VESC's. If you buy one from us and you screw up, you won't need to cough up another X amount of money to buy a completely new VESC.

@JohnnyMeduse might re-read the first post.  ;)

Until v6 comes out, i think any bleeding edge will have issues (12s and close to 60k ERPM, FOC seems especially sketchy at the limits of the VESC).  Not something they can fix, but try to help with some of those upgrades mentioned (caps).

@zmoney - Does this include the capboard and caps as well, or just bare VESC board and wires w/o caps?

@PhatJay - your beef aside w/ enertion (i'd be frustrated too if 5 months is legit.), _we have no idea if this is a "**quality vesc**" yet._  Time will tell.  If you want the best VESC out there - get @Chaka's.  Hands down, but you aren't getting it for $90!  Quality costs, and i'm encouraged to see more options.  The more competitive it is for our $ the better it will get.  You'll get stratification w/ top tier offerings costing a premium, and the bare bones budget offerings like the maytech VESCs at the bottom.  

Warranty vs no-warranty - all part of what you want to spend.  Just wish folks would accept their own risk - _if you get w/o warranty you'd better be ready and skilled enough to swap DRV chips if you kill one._  Sometimes not from any missuse - just MTBF (shit happens and they just fail).

I have 6 VESCs and have killed 2 DRV chips in over a year.  Being cautious and not pushing the limits (both were killed bench testing 12s w/ misuse on my part hammering hard accel/braking repeatedly - not good to your DRV), the rest are going strong still. 4.7hw 1.13fw (just works) - BLDC.

/rant

Look forward to seeing your VESCs @Zmoney!  Appreciate you are going to give $ back to Ben.  That's needed to keep him innovating and hopefully getting v6 available sooner!

@sl33py sorry I skip it... 

It is a good Warranty, I just hope they have the buisness plan to back it up... It will cost them around 30 to 40 % of their profit just to back their warranty... 

Again it is a nice Warranty... I just hope they can deliver...

[/quote]

They're pretty damn sweet and much easier to chain together into a dual VESC config due to the extra solder points on the caps board, and the way the wires are run over the side to meet the caps board there is no longer an issue of shorting due to punctured insulation by port pins. The new configuration is lovely and much less work to squeeze into smaller spaces. 

@zmoney I've been told that fatter, higher voltage mosfets and higher voltage caps on the PCB will find you much more reliable at 12S. You have a chance here to make a move on that. The 10S best-practice limit is artificial and can easily be broken through with what basically amounts to an extra few dollars per unit. There are plenty of people here who will buy them specifically for that voltage if you can make them run cooler and last longer by using beefier components.

You're right. My team and i have actually ordered a few beefier components and plan on soldering testing them out for ourselves. Were going torture those little VESC's and see how they hold up with 12s. If everything goes as planned we will use those components in our final product. Those how have pre-ordered will not have pay anything more and the pre-order price will remain the same.

I don't think higher voltage MOSFETs bring any advantage. I think they more likely bring the disadvantage of a higher Rds on. So they get hotter. You will not find 80V FETs with a low Rds on like the IRFS7530 60V FET.

@zmoney Great to see a new supplier on the marked. You promise a lot. My own opinion is, that you shouldn't concentrate on the V4.12 version any longer. Be the first one producing the V6.0 design. I think Benjamin will publish it soon. When you look on enertions delivery times your customers will then get their "new" version month before others.

So you bought Chaka's VESC in June and then decided to manufacture and sell VESCs for half of the price with the same specs like him too? At the same time omitting the donations to Benjamin Vedder? And remain anonymous and taking money for pre-orders?

When someone purchases from us, we can not see your card information or anything of the likes. We can see your name, email address, and physical address to ship you your goods. As to "anonymity", I realize that as new vender, it's hard for new clients to hand over sensitive information. We have to slowly gain the trust of individuals like you guys. Thanks for your honest feedback. If you have any questions, you can send us an email, pm me, or directly post on this thread. Thanks again

We've been flooded with emails about international shipping. Right now, the cheapest option is to send thorugh USPS. EVen even that, most desitionations cost 25+ to ship to. We're trying to figure out distrubtion centers abroad so that these prices are a little more reasonable.

The only problem is that until you find different shipping method we will loose pre sale prices.

Even +$25 for shipping it's a decent price.  Especially if you get two...

It looks legit and worth a shot.  I ordered up a pair to try.  (sorry salt in the wound, but $7.xx shipping!)

A little update for those waiting to get their hands on their VESC's: We ordered connections from China and It seems they won't be shipped out until the 12th due to a "Chinese holiday" called golden week or something...

I talked with the sales rep. and she promised to expedite the shipping so we get our stuff ASAP. We're sorry for the delay. This really is out of our control. Talk about bad timing...

If you have any questions you can email us at support@goaxle.com

I received my tracking number and it was supposed to be shipped out on October 8th but you mentioned that the post office was closed. Then the post office didn't pick it up a week later and now I can't seem to get a response/update.

You were going to update some pictures on here but also nothing.

Should I be worried?? Not sure what to think right now as all communication has come to a stop.

Got my VESCS. Initial impressions are.. unfortunately poor. The shrink looks awful, the wires look like they were recycled from something else. Soldering job is pretty poor as well, and there's carbon over some of the wires and shrink. There's also some sort of coating on the entirety of the board, though it's not consistent. Some of the pins from the hall sensors and other ports have protruding pins which can potentially short if they pierce the wires, though they're not nearly as long as Enertion's first batch of VESCs. The PWM pins are also pretty short, so I'm not sure how they'll hold a servo cable under heavy vibration.

those dont look like silicone wires, there is a reason for using silicone coated wires, the insulation wont melt under high temperatures. I would change those before riding... Also, to solder those thick wires you need a more powerful soldering iron.

I'm intrigued by these vescs and even after the pictures I'm still interested in buying them. I would love to see how they perform in others boards before purchasing them but it seems to me that these guys will be good to work with if there are any issues which is what is most important to me. If the quality is that of, or slightly better than what enertion vescs seem to be, then the warranty would make this product totally worth it! I'm interested to see how the protective coating may help them out too.

@zmoney

It's all constructive criticism bro. You can easily work out these issues. Maybe work out the solder job a bit more and perfect it. I'm guessing you are using a reflow oven or hot air station?

All you have to do for the wires and heat shrink complaints is get nice silicon wires and a heat gun.

The Vesc is definitely not easy to produce, but I'm sure you'll work out the kinks and offer great customer service.

**FIRST AND FOREMOST**

 I would like to thank everyone and their VERY frank criticism. We take all of it to heart and it's an awesome way to learn and improve on any product. 

With that said, we fucked up. Plainly said. Those VESC's look like complete garbage and the team here really apologizes for that. We've address these issues head on.

**SHITTY OLD MAN WITH PARKINSONS SOLDERING JOB:** You've seen the pictures @Jinra posted. Looks like someone soldered these on while on some crack. To solve that, were going to use 12 AWG wire to ease the soldering process onto the the board

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/c/8c40cfcece0d7aa77331b625ccae07fe774e1df7.JPG" width="281" height="500">  
**(still kinda messy with the flux. It'll go through some cleaning later with some Isopropanol alcohol.)**

**LONG PPM PINS:** Although trimmed, it seems as though they are not short enough. To fix this, we've bought (better) flush cutters. For redundancy, we're applying some hot glue onto the pins to be safe. (looks crude, but hey, works)

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/b/abc5529fb4490a5b0a51acd67bf3607e37002bfa.JPG" width="281" height="500">

**HEAT SHRINK HALF SHRUNKEN/HALF BURNT:** We're just being crazy at this point. Instead of using lighters. (yes lighters). We've added of few heat guns to properly shrink them into place. 

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/4/34534d44be05fc478a2714a840e61d6ea98824f0.JPG" width="690" height="388">

**(Yes we know it's not shrunken. The VESC in the picture isn't 100% done yet.)**

**SHORT PPM PINS:** I guess we had some mirco servo connectors because they fit the ones we had laying around. Nonetheless, we had Mouser rush us some new ones which should fit nicely.  You might not be able to tell from the picture though.

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/0/008e4da321d71ccc772570dabc39b04e017cc4b7.JPG" width="690" height="388">

**UNEVEN COATINGS OF CONFORMAL COATING:** We might have gotten a little tooooo trigger happy on it. Don't have any pictures of this, mostly because you can't really see it.

**_SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO FOR THOSE WHO HAVE RECEIVED SHIT VESC's_**

If you have recieved a VESC like @EMC75 or @Jinra then you can do the following:

1: Keep your VESC if you're in love with the soldering job
2. Send it back and we'll send you a brand new one.
3.Return it for a refund

If you have **NOT**   received your VESC, then your VESC's will come with the above changes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To close this post, I want to again apologize for the shitty VESC's. Criticism like yours only helps a company improve and grow. No business or person or entity is perfect, especially for new ones, but it's up to us to fix our mistakes and make sure everyone receives what they expect. Thank you

~Z

Great to learn you are listening @zmoney that is how great customer service is done   .  Just another tip:  I use temperature regulated soldering irons for my small electronics but when it comes to battery leads and 10 gauge wires you really need something in the 80-100 watts range and doesn't even have to be regulated, it seems to me you are using something smaller, correct me if I'm wrong. Those wires suck a lot of heat up

Chaka hasn't released his "version" of vedder's BOM, but one can prob. take a good guess to it. For example, one notable difference is the the caps at C37 and C51. Instead of 15 uF at 100V, we opted for 22uF at 100v.

An update on the VESC's, We don't have enough silicon wire to go around for everyone right now. None of the local hardware stores have what we need, but that shouldn't hold us back much.

Got mine last night.  

DId not cut the shrink off to super thoroughly check them, but they looked really good (at first glance).  

Silicone wires, clean solder and heatshrink on the phase wires and bullet connectors. Clean heatshrink w/ no carbon. Hot glue to protect pins from puncturing power wire, and hot glue on the caps of cap pcb to help with none breaking off (vibration or movement stress i'd guess).

I'm out of town this weekend, but i'll post some really good close-up pics for everyone.  At least to satisfy the physical side - not sure when i'll get to actually test them riding.

@zmoney - these have the same improved select components that chaka uses to make them more reliable?

Nothing personal but I think you should also update your profile picture.. Just put a nice Green ''V'' (like yes) sign.. instead of that dreadful ''X''.. Im usually not that superstitious.. though this sort of influces me also from the marketing perspective.. (X simbolizes dead end or a failure.. ) ;) :D

--

Anyways.. nice thing you do try to solve the mistakes you've made in the process.. I think you should try to slow down the process.. not sure about the order count but as you can see the return costs and all the hassle of repairing might take more time compared to just doing it right the first time.. 

Improve your equipment, like you already partially did.. and I bet you will get way better results.. otherwise.. it's shocking that you guys can solder / reflow these little tiny chips but struggle to directly solder the cables and shrink the heatshrinks nicely..

Though, if you do also use them in other applications besides the e-skate .. let us know, too ;) 

One guy to which I told about VESC, told me that he sees a potential in using this for a go-cart (junior size)..

I'm actually building a brand new build atm. Gutted my old build to use for some parts. Going to use a Vanguard. I'll share some pics when Iv'e gathered everything up.

[quote="Okami, post:222, topic:9240"]
could u explain the meaning behind the name axle? Does it also has some connection to the ''X'' hence you chose it for the logo of your profile here?
[/quote]


Thought about the name for a while. An axle, like those of a car, resembles that of a skateboards, which you need to..skate. Support if you will.

The "x" was just used for profile pics. 
The box logo lets us change up the style..

Ordered a couple vescs from you guys over the weekend. 2 questions. 

First, I have never had a vesc before but in reading on the forum I see a lot of people talking about not initially hooking them up to your boards battery but rather a power supply at lower voltage? Is this something you guys will have already done? Do I need to be concerned about plugging them it into my 10s4p battery to do the motor detection on my motors? I only ask because I don't own a bench top power supply. 

Second. I'd love to assemble my board over thanksgiving break (starts nov 22), Does it seem possible for me to receive them by then?

Hey,

[/quote]

No. We power them up and test them with our own power supply before we ship them out.  You only need low voltage on the first boot.

I finally got around to picking up the VESC from Axle that I ordered. Here's what I experienced:

* The VESC works perfectly in pretty much every way. BLDC worked first try, FOC worked first try. (FOC is awesome btw, really reduced the noise of my chain drive)
* Thick gauge wire is also flexible
* Not super impressed by the quality of the hand-soldered components. I think it might have been just low-quality solder and nothing more. I re-did the hand-soldered connections with my leaded solder with extra flux and then they were nice and shiny!
* Random hotglue in some places on the PCB.
* Like other users have mentioned, the heat-shrink isn't too neat. Oh well.
* I tried PPM mode at first and got strange results. The VESC read the signal as being 1.8ms than the 1.5ms I was expecting. I double-checked with a oscilloscope and it read 1.5. I had to calibrate my GT2B and my Bluetooth receiver in order to get the correct signal. This could by anything from a bad timing signal to a software glitch. 
* One thing that bugged be a lot was the fact that the PPM input is in the form of a 3-pin header and not a cable. I had to make my own adapter-cable, and when I plugged it in, the capacitor bank kinked the cable enough to stop the signal. I might just solder a cable directly to the VESC. 
* Software version came with 2.18. I downloaded the first BLDC tool that Google provided and it worked.

All in all, this VESC works and you get what you pay for. It's not perfect, and Axle does have room for improvement, but overall I am happy with my purchase. If you guys have any questions just ask!

Thought I'd stop by here in the thread to let everyone know these Vescs are awesome. Not a single problem. Plug and play ready and the shrink wrap they put around them makes me feel like they are good and protected in the tight space I have them in. Went 15 miles straight the other day and they kicked butt. I have two of them with 192kv sk3's and I don't dare to push my board to it's limit at all. These vescs are the best price on a solid built vesc period.

@Blasto The heat sink won't touch those.  Also noticed the mask and a few other mistakes made after ordering the PCB's. Funny how you triple check everything and still find a mistake :rage:. These aren't final production samples.

It is in the first post...

"-Caps. at C37 and C51 and C18 have been upgraded to a higher capacitance to handle more powaa"

Vesc X essentially has higher current output because of direct fets. Zenon is working on direct fet vesc as well.

[quote="Pantologist, post:294, topic:9240"]
Vesc X essentially has higher current output because of direct fets
[/quote]

nearly got it ;)

_some more details below_


----------


**UPGRADED DIRECTFET PACKAGE**
1. New form factor places all fets on one side allowing improved thermal management design.
2. The metal package of the fets allows a better heat transfer and increases the current carrying capacities.
3. Precision CNC aluminum heatsink will be used to improve thermal dynamics keeping the board much cooler preventing shutdowns caused by overheating
4. Lower gate charge which will make it easier for the DRV8302. Faster switching time and reduced load on the mosfet driver.
5. Compact footprint keeping the high current paths as short as possible for improved efficiency.

**UPGRADED BOM COMPONENTS**
1. Some components in the original VESC BOM have been identified as a potential weakness that may lead to premature failures, components have been replace with higher tolerances.
2. Increased number of ceramic decoupling capacitors for improved reliability. 
3. Large TVS diode capable of handling large voltage and current spikes, giving regenerative breaking an alternative current path when the battery is fully charged.
4. Micro USB port to improve compatibility with the more common cables used with mobile phones. Easily accessible keeping all wires streamline.
5. Low ESR bulk capacitors, giving you power when it's needed most.

**NEW FORM FACTOR**
1. The new form factor drastically improves the manufacturability of the VESC, the VESC-X is faster & easier to produce with reduced chance of manufacturing faults.
2. The new layout keeps the logic & power separate, meaning traces are shorter and both ceramic and electrolytic capacitors are closer offering a more robust & reliable power system.
3. Integrated Bulk Capacitors, inside the hard case, help prevent accidental shorts occurring & make the footprint more manageable in tight enclosures.
4. This new PCB design with more accessible mounting holes makes installing a heatsink & hard case simple.
5. Place holder M3 holes for adding another heatsink for even more cooling power.

**NEW HARD CASE & HEATSINK INCLUDED**
1. A precision CNC aluminum heat sink not only improves the thermal properties of the vesc by dissipating the heat away from the board, it also protects from accidental shorts, accidental damage of vital components and provides a user-friendly mounting solution so you can install the vesc securely inside your components housing using common M3 screws.
2. The top side of the new VESC-X hard case is made from super strong impact resistance ABS material, The top shell is non-conductive material and covers all the exposed areas making it nearly impossible to short out your VESC accidently.
3. The impact resistant ABS shell design offers easy access to the various ports and has a window for monitoring the LED's which is useful for diagnostics.
4. With the built to last Aluminium Heatsink & Impact resistant tough case the VESC-X will be protected from accidental damage, whilst offering superior cooling performance during peak load draw.
5. Compact footprint of the VESC-X allows two of them to be mounted side by side and keep all your wires nice and tidy to offer the cleanest builds out there, while still having access to all the ports.

@zmoney, just wanted to say thanks for a great vesc so far! I bought mine last year during the pre-order but have not been able to use it because of the crazy winter we have had! I added some heatsinks and it's been doing well over the last week when I finally was able to give it a go.

I'll be back if i need another one for sure!

Hey @zmoney,

I've been away from the forums for months since work has been hectic and the weather has been rainy here in SF. However, I'm not getting ready to build my backup board and the craziest thing happened. I grabbed my completely new Axle Vescs and was checking the wiring (from that awful initial batch) and the wire effortlessly broke! There also seems to be a bunch of powdery residue on it. This has me completely baffled, so instead of messing around with it, I'd like to take you up on your initial offer for you to replace them. Let me know how to kick of the process or if you'd like me to DM you about this instead.

Pic!

@Jinra sorry guys for being off the forums! Busy lately and I promise to get back to all individually when I catch up. 

It looks like you got the first batch we've ever made! We've come a long way. Just send us an email at support@goaxle.com and we'll whip up a new VESC for you.

Hey @ron! Our shop is closed right now because we're having too many orders and not enough staff. We plan to open back up on the 20th! Because of these delays we're focusing on fulfilling orders rather than developing the Direct Fet VESC as of right now. We still need time to iron out some kinks. We don't want to rush a product. :)

I'm pretty damned happy with the ones i just got. With the mods you've made they behave a lot like VESC-Xs. 

After re-reading this entire thread, it looks as if you had some serious challenges and have over come them. And the customer service is good too.

can you do a vesc without any of those extra white plugs?  never used them and doubt I ever would and just like the mini-usb for the pc.  even the canbus connecting white plug sucks for me and always is breaking down and rather have a through hole to solder a wire in.

Hey @zmoney,

I was the very first order from you (Order #1) and wanted to share my experience so far with Axle. The two VESCs I received nearly 6 months ago were very shoddy. Craftsmanship was poor, wires were of the wrong type, and they literally broke after being picked up 6 months later when I was ready to use them.

You expressed that you were very sorry for the poor quality of the first batch which I initially declined since I could fix the issues myself. However, after the 10AWG wire broke so effortless 6 months later, I felt that I would be better off exchanging it. You were very responsive and got two new VESCs in my hands in a little under 2 weeks, which is appreciated, especially since the original order was quite a while ago.

I noticed the replacement VESCs were very good quality with the noticeable hardware improvements you originally mentioned. I'm very happy with the quality and level of service of Axle so far. 

This post isn't all just praise and thanks though. I found that one of my VESCs was unable to receive PPM signals. After a bunch of testing with different receivers and wires, I found that the VESC had a small straight piece of solder connecting the PPM pin to the transistor (resistor?) below.

Just thought you should be aware in case it happens to anyone else. Thanks a lot @zmoney!

How bout hiring more people or something?

Are u going to call them something else now with the vesc copyright business?  V-e-c. All I ever called them anyway. Rolls off the tongue

When u get going again I'd like to get some without the extra white plugs I never use. Write or call 

Robust foc that's all I need.

If the 4 can be made with reliable foc I think it'd be cheaper and it's more than capable. The amp ability of the 6 or even the X is overkill for me using even one hub motor and I've never hit an over-temp shutdown without any heatsinks

Other people know more about it, but it apparently has some extra components to block current to the DRV in the case in which it'd normally burn out.
