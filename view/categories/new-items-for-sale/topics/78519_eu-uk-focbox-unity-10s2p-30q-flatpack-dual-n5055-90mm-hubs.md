- Focbox unity - In hand. Looking to sell for 290 EUR/261 GBP. 
- 10S2P Samsung 30Q pack w/ inbuilt BMS. 25A Cont in VESC works well. **Used briefly for about 20 
  Cycles** Asking £90
- Dual 90MM Hub motors w/ replaceable urethane. Pretty powerful and great for mid tier builds where full 
  urethane isnt as much of an issue (flexy decks, etc). Unused, comes with 6 Spare urethanes, Asking £150
- N5055 Motors - Pretty nice in a dual setup, more powerful than people usually think. Unused. £25 each

xD no, not that cheap. I'd hang onto them myself at that point, as they're unused they are a little higher. Unsensored though so maybe I will hang onto them. Its one of those things where once ive paid shipping from china it isnt worth selling them again because its so much of the price. I guess i got them for free though
