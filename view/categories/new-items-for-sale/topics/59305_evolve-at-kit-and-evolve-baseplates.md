Hey! I noticed you had another post where you were selling the TB218 trucks with changed bushings+pivot cups together with white flywheel clones for 130€ – do you still have that available?

You can, you just have to cut about 10mm off the hanger and they fit perfect.

What would shipping be on the AT wheels?  My brother ants another set of AT's but he aint getting my 6 shooters :slight_smile:.

I think, I'll cut off 10mm of the Truck, and then I can fit the At wheels on the Truck ;)

That's true, but TB 218mm trucks tend to bend in their original form factor so cutting of 10mm of the hanger is not a very good idea!

Shipping is about $40 so I think it's a better idea for you to get it from the US dealer!

Hey, 
You want to know if you can put Evolve trucks and AT wheels on a Spud with no wheel bite? I think it should be possible, but not sure. I could check in a couple of hours if you'd like.
