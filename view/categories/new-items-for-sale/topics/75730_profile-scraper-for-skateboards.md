**Variation on a Productive Tool**

I had fun thinking this one up. Simple tool but very effective for cleaning up the edge of a skateboard. Cabinet scrapers have been used in furniture building forever. Scrapers can be pulled in any grain direction making them ideal for edge work on a board. 
Enjoy.

I think this link works better for the [profile scraper](http://www.roarockit.com/skateboard-building/profile-scraper/#.W_hIyt-YVhG).
