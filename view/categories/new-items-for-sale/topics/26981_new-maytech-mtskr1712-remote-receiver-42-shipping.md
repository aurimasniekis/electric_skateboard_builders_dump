I have this remote and can confirm it works great!  It's still a little on the light side as far as weight , but the throttle has a nice heavy spring action. Feels very comfortable in the hand and super smooth acceleration/braking , just as good as my GT2B mod

agreed. took a 30km trip on it yesterday. its a fine remote. 
comfortable to hold, super fast connecting, great battery life and the 2 speed settings are very convenient.

I've been selling these here in the states on my site and just ran out today! They are nice. I too can confirm great throttle response and a solid feel on the thumb stick. Nice that the slow/fast function works too!

though I think that the high speed mode doesn't change the top speed but only the acceleration curve.

btw, we just found out that, if you know your way around a soldering iron, you can connect battery power to the receivers ground and 42V pin and the remote will indicate the battery status (for 10S), no need for the maytech esc to use this feature.

Commenting negatively about the old here is out of place right? Am I wrong?

Right but my original comment was just that Maytech makes awful looking remotes, this one included. Even with this new remote, it doesn't look like it'll fit in my pocket as well as the nano v2 or benchwheel remotes.

since its possible to hook up any 10S battery (without having to use a maytech vesc as stated in the manual) to the receivers GND and 42V pins to have the remote indicate battery status, its advised by maytech to connect a 10K resistor to the positive side between the battery and receiver.

Exactly.. with the remote on and connected, press power button and the blue power led blinks fast (= fast mode), press again and the LED blinks  slow (= "slow" mode), press again and you're back to fast mode aso.

How does it feel compared to Steez (V1)?

On the Steez, I think the joystick feels cheap. Acceleration is not nice.

I've only played around with the Steez remote a little bit and it was really jumpy and dropped connection frequently.  This one has been perfect (probably have about 10hrs of ride time in so far with this and no drops yet and very smooth performance.    My only feedback would be that the trigger is kinda small

## \#36 Posted by: Alan_Smithee Posted at: 2017-07-24T21:08:37.128Z Reads: 181

don't know the steez, but the trigger on the maytech is fine. it has a nice heavy spring, making it feel very solid. Accelleration is smooth. I feel like its still accellerating a bit after I stopped moving the trigger, but that might be due to my VESC settings. Even though the actual movement range of the trigger is rather small its not a problem at all. In part because it has two speed modes. In regular mode it accellerates softly while in high speed mode, everything is a bit more snappy. You can change modes back and forth while riding. Top speed is the same in both modes it seems.

Pins maybe are rattling a little in the Jst? Could be soldered on to ensure that is not a problem.

Inspect the battery in the controller to ensure it’s ok

What’s your esc? Maybe it’s that which is resetting

I had some disconnection. Issues when the receiver was touching the phas wires or was too close to them. You can also try the procedure from maytech to bind the remote.i Have to find it again in the net.

Check the pairing paragraph. The remote worked for me out of the box but I once had to pair it because it worked but was acting weird on another vesc.
