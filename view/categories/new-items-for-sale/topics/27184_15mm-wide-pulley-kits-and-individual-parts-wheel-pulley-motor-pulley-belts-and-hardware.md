I'm starting a new thread for this as things have evolved from my first test batch of pulleys in this thread here:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/15mm-wide-pulley-kits-wheel-motor-pulleys-belts-and-hardware/17131

Anyways, you can see that I've sold quite a few kits with positive feedback.  I am offering the kit as well as the individual pulleys.  Pricing is as follows:

**$40 USD for the Complete Kit shipped to USA and Canada**
- 36T Drive Wheel Pulley designed for Flywheel Style Longboard Wheels
- 15T Motor Pulley with 8mm bore for motor shaft, Four Set Screws, and keyway for maximum security
- Retainer/washer for bolts
- 255mm long belt
- 265mm long belt
- x6 M6 Allen Head Screws

**$15 USD for a Motor Pulley shipped to USA and Canada**
- 8mm bore for motor shaft, Four Set Screws, and keyway

**$28 USD for a 36T Drive Wheel Pulley  shipped to USA and Canada**
- includes retainer and bolts

**Shipped via regular post** (i.e. no tracking as it's coming from Canada and tracking is too expensive for such a small item). **Payment must be sent via friends and family**. Send me a PM if you're interested.

PM me for pricing if you want multiple items.  Also PM me for international shipping.

That comes from Hong Kong. No reason to close his thread, he's just trying to make a little money. I'm sure that they also stole his product photos.

Also by saying that you should ban DIY from advertising on the forum because he sells these kits for even more than @johnny_261

 diy-electric-skateboard-kits-parts/36t-abec-drive-pulley-belt-combo-kit/

I don't want to sound rude either, but it actually pisses me off that you made that comment. He has been selling these for a while and i havnt seen anyone complain about not receiving the parts, poor quality, or anything else. There is no reason a moderator should say that their going to close a thread all because someone is reslling a product.

Well...this a fun morning for me to find this thread has exploded into something negative.  @lox897 @marcus @Maxid  for your information, I was the one who brought the 15mm kits to market.  That eBay seller has STOLEN my product photos, my write up of the product description and is undercutting me.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER IF YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST IN SUPPORTING PEOPLE WHO FURTHER THE DIY ESK8 COMMUNITY.  As I said, they have STOLEN my photos, so who knows if you will get the same product or something of comparable quality.

I PAID for the DEVELOPMENT of this product, determined the specifications, got prototypes made, revised specs, got more prototypes made.  It took me 6 MONTHS from when I first saw the need to have affordable 15mm kits to when I actually started selling them back in January in this thread:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/15mm-wide-pulley-kits-wheel-motor-pulleys-belts-and-hardware/17131?source_topic_id=27184

I have great reviews from everyone. I sold the products at a slightly lower cost to have some market penetration and get thing started. Just when I'm starting to turn the corner and make this worth my investment of time and money, this comes along...I'm just a guy trying to add some value to the community here and get paid fairly.  Believe me, I'm not getting rich on this.

ALSO my product ships from Vancouver, Canada. Delivery time is generally 1-2 weeks, so you get your product a lot faster than overseas which sometimes takes months.

I truly hope @lox897 will do something about removing this negative chatter from my thread.  This is exactly how you STOP INNOVATION and discourage use of this forum.  Encouraging people on here to buy from supplier who has copied and undercut me...I expected a lot better from this forum to be honest.  I don't have the volume or resources to order such large quantities and provide such low prices and have paid for the R&D as well.  Definitely NOT COOL.

@JLabs thanks for your support.

By the way, just so you guys know, I also have been selling this product on eBay since January. But have been selling it on here CHEAPER ON PURPOSE to support people who are part of the DIY community...so yeah...

It's crazy how you can jump to conclusions like this. Honestly you owe me an apology bro.  If you even took a minute to read my post, you can see that I was on here Feb when I first brought these to the community. http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/15mm-wide-pulley-kits-wheel-motor-pulleys-belts-and-hardware/17131?source_topic_id=27184

I had sold prototypes to some friends prior to that in January. So to set the record straight AGAIN, they COPIED MY PHOTOS.  They were taken on my Canon G11 on my kitchen table FYI.

@Bensaida @Guacamoleface Thanks for the support guys.  Yeah it's pretty brutal.  I guess lesson learned, watermark those photos...Still it is pretty lame that they have the resources to buy in much larger quantities and undercut me and can't even take their own frickin photos.

Thank you for your explanation.

(this was the first part I have bought)

No excuses, I am sorry for the misunderstanding and for all that happened. Thank you again for the clear and helpful response.

I've talked to johnny and it seems he is the original creator of the kit. Chinese doing thier thing and selling to others as well :confused:

Did you design the pulleys? If so, it's pretty bad that DIY is selling them.

This kit is of EXCELLENT quality, and I received in 3-4 days.

As a Canadian, I was much happier to buy from @johnny_261 than from Chinese sellers. Whenever I buy stuff from China, it can take anywhere from three weeks to eight months to arrive. I literally just got something in the mail today that I ordered from China in December. Absolutely ridiculous.

Sorry to hear that the Chinese sellers are ripping off your photos.

I purposely said in my first comment if Johnny could please explain the situation. Apologies if that came off as harsh, I just wanted to understand what was happening. Another user was complaining so it was in my best interest to set things straight and understand the situation. Now that Johnny has explained, I completely understand what has happened and that he has BENEFITED the community. It sounds like he put a lot of work into these and unfortunately someone from HK has undercut him. I was also unaware that the ebay product was from HK until after I posted my first comment. Sincere apologies to anyone who felt disheartened by my first comment.

Next time I will seek to understand before I threaten to close a thread.

PEACE OUT

I bought a set off Johnny despite having seen the eBay ad, I did try to purchase them off the seller as backup before I saw info above  

the seller was really squirelly and pulled out saying he had quality issues then hiked the price by removing free shipping he has been begging me to revise my feedback ever since bit of a douchebag it seems

I don't have any plans for a 40T wheel pulley at this time...Doesn't seem like there is enough demand, but if enough people are interested I could try to make it work.

I got the drivetrain from johnny_261 and I'm very happy with them,
great quality!
I'm not able to use them because it is the first part I have bought, but the feel of it is very good, the build of it feels good and the belt feels strong. 

When I've build my board I'll give a greater video review of them.

Usually I say around 1 - 2 weeks in USA depending on where you are and 2-3 weeks international, but sometimes its faster as you've seen by the comments above.  Delivery times are not guaranteed though as they have to cross border and customs/border security can be a delay that I can't control.

Just a heads up for those thinking of ordering from the ebay listings, don't bother. Received my sets today, and despite the listing saying the same as here, it came with 36T / 12T, 2x 250mm belts and smaller silver screws. The main 36mm pulley was bent, and chipped.

Meanwhile, the ones i got here were flawless :slight_smile:

It arrived very quickly. Tnx again very good quality.

Just to note everyone: it doesn't fit well on flywheel copies, i used only 3 bolts. And 255mm belt is way too tight with the gear ration. I couldn't even get it on. (depends on mount)

I was thinking idler but that's just silly. Even 265 is very short that there wouldnt be any space for. I'd say 265 is perfect size

Ps. Centering the wheel gear was hard. It took me an hour to get it just enough.

Thanks for the feedback. It varies for different flywheel clones as the cores are all slightly different. I did manage to get all 6 bolts in there if you drill the holes just a hair wider in the core. But it does take a little bit of effort depending on the exact wheels you have.

true true. 3 is doing just fine. the bolt is nice and thick that I don't think it will break before the core 😆. do u also sell just the belts? or where can I order? I want some extra belt

I'm actually thinking of buying some for me. 40T 17mm pulleys for 15mm belts. Just not really sure about that lip on the backside of the pulley...not sure how if it will interfere with 107mm wheels.

Haha yeah my taps are all at my workshop which is inconveniently located far away from my place. Didn't even end up needing them luckily, just a lil bit of elbow grease.

MBS 100mm AT wheels use ABEC style rim! The kit in the picture above won't fit them. You need ABEC pulley kit. The one form TB (torque board, ) works the best. The pulley matches the wheel so well there is no struggle bolting in.

@johnny_261  Hi! I'm new in this world. I understand I won't be able to use these pulleys with a 10mm shaft motor, is that correct? If that's the case, do you sell pulleys for 10mm shaft motors? Otherwise, what motor would you recommend? It'll be for my first board.

Thank you very much

I only sell with 8mm bore, but there are plenty of motors with 8mm out there.  I don't have any particular recommendations as I haven't been building for a while now, but there is plenty of research on the forum.  Let me know if you need a kit or two. Selling a good prices to clear the last of the stock.
