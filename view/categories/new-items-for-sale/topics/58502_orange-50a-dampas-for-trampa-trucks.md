Hey guys, after some innovations I have created a better version more squeezable version of dampa's more suitable for bindingless riding in the streets. I have spent some time formulating several different urethanes solutions to make this soft and still dampening dampa's

After several people responded with positive experiences I thought I could offer them for other people, spent this weekend making several kits for sale.

I am selling those as myself, not through 3DServisas store :)

Price is 25Â£ with included shipping

P.S. cosmetically they don't look same as manufacture made original dampa's but they work just as well as originals. I will attach video of how they squeeze then I will get back home from work.

@Silverline has posted some experiences and could comment more on this. I know that @Eboosted had received them but don't know if have tried them out yet.

Yeah... I use them both in the front and rear now, and love them.... I can still carve a lot, but with stability to prevent speed wobbles at the same time.

Why are they DOUBLE  the price of trampa's own?

Because they are hand made at home? Not at manufacture plant where everything is automated?

I'm going to run my mini Infinitys in inner spring position and grab some orange dampers off you when I pick up the drives for them - for the La Croix build

Offering a full set of 4 X orange for Â£25 shipping? 

Didd you end up mixing? yellow in front,ornage in rear?

Yes 4 dampas for 1Â£ and 24Â£ shipping :D

I ended up adding back on bindings and changing front to red and rear to blue ones :D

I might be in London in a few months I'll swing by and pick them up ðŸ˜‚

I want to try without bindings it's the La Croix deck so would be a shame to have bindings, will try yours on the inner spring position, maybe yellow at front and maybe a single foot hooker when @okp comes up with the goods

How do these compare to the other dampas? For example vs red or blue?

This is complete different category, it's way softer than yellow so you could ride without bindings and still have carvability and stability until mid speeds
```

Ok, so better carvability than yellow, but stability equal to...greens?

To yellows kinda it's more solution for people who ride dampa-less to have same feeling but a bit more stable than riding without dampa's people who rided with yellow and without them should understand that it misses some stuff :)

Sent the messages to everyone, if anyone is still interested in a set, please write me a message until a weekend, I don't want to overbuy materials, as my last materials got bad and didn't worked out... So now I will only buy just enough to make ordered amount.

I have some non trampa spring trucks. Uncompressed spring length from cup to cup is about 3 cm and 2cm compressed. Do you think the dampas will work on it?

A really custom request, but are you able to make them 50A as well, but in green?

I will have to check it then I will get back home.

@Linny it's possible but it will add up something like 10-15 pounds on top as I will have to get different pigment have no idea what tone of green it will be. On palette it looks like this

![image|200x200](upload://om5ro7wHSWU4moEOtm6ioGbTU8r.jpg)

compared to orange

Sure, price sounds reasonable. A light green similar to the Abec 11 Refly's core would be great, but that green works too!

I will try to look up different maker of pigments, but I don't know if I will find it, plus no idea how it will work with urethane as I know these are compatible...

Sure, if you can come up with a few different colors, that will not affect the urethane's performance, it'll be great as the builders can choose the colors for their build's aesthetics, like what i'm planning to do... :sweat_smile:

Got mine awhile ago but forgot to snap pics. Matches my green and black color scheme. Turning is a lot better than the 65A yellow ones but not turny enough for tight corners. Might remove the front ones and just have the springs and see if it's better.

Tight turns are even hard with bindings :) Trampa is not made for tight turns :D
