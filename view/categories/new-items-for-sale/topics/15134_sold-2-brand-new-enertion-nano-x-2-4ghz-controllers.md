I have 2 brand new Nano-X 2.4Ghz controllers for sale. I just received them for my board but I already substituted them for another controller and I don't feel the need to change it out. If anyone is interested for them, just let me know. Make me an offer and we'll go off from there.
(One of them is opened, as seen in the pictures, to just show you guys the product)

I'm interested, how much are you asking?

Would you ship them to Florida? 

What remote did you buy and plan to keep?
