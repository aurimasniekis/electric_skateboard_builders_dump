I have made few enclosures for my vanguard and few for other members in this forum. Many of you were asking me to make custom enclosures by PM. I thought that I make a thread about this. After all the enclosure is the part that gives your build the finished look! :sunglasses:

I have few molds ready, but if you couldn't find any of these ready made molds suitable to your build hit me with PM and we talk more.

**Enlosure 1:**

This enclosure is made for single Vesc and receiver. Size 19,5 x 9 x 2,5 cm

**Enlosure 2:**

There is no need for enclosure to curve. Plastic will form in to the shape of concave when it is bolted to the board

Wanted to check if you have done anything that could work for a build I have underway.  Its using a loaded chubby unicorn http://loadedboards.com/chubby-unicorn-deck so needs to be white ABS and somehow work with or around the 2 sets of grab rail indentations.  Right now it is in dual diagonal configuration with 6374 motors, and 2 Miami Electric stealth 12s2p batteries http://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/12s-stealth-battery  that can be wired together into 12s4p flat or stacked or perhaps separate batteries/esc at each end, not sure how that would play out. Can you do something for this?

You upcoming build sounds good! You are going to have fun with two 6374s! :grin:

 I suggest that you go with flat pack because those batteries totals 5cm in height when stacked. I would go with one big enclosure if your board is not flexible.

I do not have white ABS but I do not think it is a big deal to get some hobbypaint and DIY :smile:

@Dunkirk How big enclosures you can make? I just bought Landyacht Top speed and I want my enclosure in one piece, but my oven is too small for one piece vacuum. Or then I just have to make it in 2 pcs one for battery and one for electronics... Like most people do. I want it to be very aesthetic.

Got the same problem because using oven. I can do max 25cm x 25cm enclosures. 

But I suggest that you do two identical enclosures and cut one side open from both enclosures. Then use stong clue to attach them together. The gap is almost invisible :slight_smile:

@Dunkirk I absolutely love your enclosures and after spending some time reading this forum decided to build a board based on the vanguard deck and ideally two of your type 3 enclosures if you are still making them? Are the L21,5 x W19,5 x H3,2 cm inside or outside measurements?

Thank you that should work. I want to go for a dual hub motor setup with 10s3p, consisting of 10s2p in one of the boxes and another 10s1p in the other box plus the 2 vesc. I should manage to fit it all in what do you think? If not I will just leave it at 10s2p to beginn with. I want the board to be as compact as possible, 10-12km range would be sufficient. Can you send 2 boxes to Barcelona by the end of November? I will have all my parts by then and want to start a post here for my first build! :slight_smile:

That should work! I also have thought to do exactly like that. 10s2p in front and 1p at back. You have about 13cm x 10 cm space after placing 10 cells in the enclosure. 

I can do them whenever you want!

Hello,

I am also building a Vanguard setup, but with dual VESCS.

My plan is to mount the battery (10s2p Samsung 25r) in the front and then the 2 ESCs, DIY Boards ON OFF Switch, and DIY Nano reciever in the back close to the motors.

I have ordered Kydex and plan to use that. 

Where on the Vanguard board do these enclosures need to be mounted to avoid issues with flex? (I have a flex 3)

What layout of the VESCs do you use/ recomend inside the enclosure?

Not really related, but I am planning on running flat wire on top of the board under the grip tape, so do I need to increase the capacitor size for that?

Thanks.

Don't mount anything in the middle section where the board flexes. Take a look at other builds there.
VESC layout is up to you, you will somehow figure it out in the end.
Just make sure you have enough space for it.
If you want to run FOC, you will need a huge capacitor(s) to compensate the long wires.

Define huge.

Also, I have measured out that I can likely keep my wires around 45cm, so longer than the recommended 30cm, but not as bad as it could be.

Well this enclosure is **_in-theory_** designed to squeeze a 12S4P into the front and dual VESC in the rear (Rear enclosure not my design) so I bet it'd fit a whole 10S4P, rather than splitting into two 5S4P packs maybe?

@jackw That is really good looking 3D model! Only problem is that the enxlosure might bee too long. The enlosure on the 3D model is about 30cm long and will affect to a flex. 

@Eboosted I would suggest enclosure "3" on the back and enclosure "3+" on the front. Or two "3+ enclosures on both ends of the board. 3+ can hold 20 cells in total but not BMS :slight_smile:

The easiest, quickest way to reinforce the 3d enclosures is adding Carbon Fiber or Glass Fiber layers inside with resin.

It was 3d printed and reinforced with  one CF layer on the inside, I made three of them for a friend of mine, none has been broken yet.

@Dunkirk Yeah it's rather large, maybe I'm underestimating how much flex it would be under.

I might re-design it as a 12S3P enclosure which would be considerably shorter. Could probably fit that in the same length enclosure as the Boosted Board uses. Probably be more viable.

@MasterCho Thats pretty nifty, I guess you can sand/fill the print to get rid of the print lines and get a nice finish?

Ok, had a re-jig. Now holds a 12S3P with plenty of space in front for BMS etc. It's now the same size, if not slightly smaller than the Boosted. Meaning it should be fine for the flex, no?

Hey, this should fit your battery layout, it's slightly longer and wider than a real boosted but still looks ok in my opinion! I haven't printed any of these myself (Nor have I modelled something for 3D printing before) but you guys are welcome to try it out.

Right now they are a shell without any thickness, so I can send you it how it is if you want, and you'll have to get back to me on what to change/implement. In the mean time I am working on the "insides" to give it actual thickness. (Like I said I don't known if you can throw the "shell" at a 3D printer and have it control thickness)?

 I've rounded some more stuff out and given it a bit more shape overall too.

@Eboosted This should fit a 10S4P like you need, but with a slightly different battery layout to yours.

Do you know what kind of BMS does he uses? the antispark switch he uses should be this one:

Super rough idea of the sort of space you have for the switch and BMS etc, until you know what size the BMS is you can't really plan exactly where the rest will go.

I'm still waiting a reply on barajabali but digging on his thread I found some pictures of his battery builds, I'm not sure if you can tell what's the BMS he uses on this picture:

[img]http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/optimized/2X/5/50301832796aaad1928402b4265ea578f60d4df1_1_500x500.jpeg[/img]

Here is a quote from one of his posts:

> barajabali Oct 5
> Go for a single drive 6375 190kv

> The 10s4p pack is 20 mm thick on the thin parts and around 30mm thick on the part where the bms is.

> The pack costs 455 shipped it includes the on off switch LCD battery display bms and laptop style charger

> This week I have a 20 dollar off sale so 435 shipped in the us

So I assume the BMS he uses has 10mm height, can't confirm though

If its the same one as mine its about 130mm x 55mm (pretty big) so you could wrap the pack something like this to keep it compact and stick the switch and display around/ above.

30 meters? :smile:  It's 305mm on my end! Having a small compact enclosure like this means you have to do a bit of guesswork, maybe it'll print a few mm bigger or smaller,  maybe you can find a smaller BMS to supply to @barajabali  so you have more room to play with.

All I can say is that on my 3D mock up it looks like it will all fit. In real life though you can never be too sure! I'd say just print it and do a test fit when you've got everything, then you can adjust here and there and have it printed again, but I've no idea what it costs to have it printed and I'm not the one paying for it :smile:

It seems to have enough space for the BMS, switch and display. BTW did you modify the last STL or it's the sameone?

I'm so hyped for your build! I've been following this thread for a while and this is exactly what I've been patiently waiting on to start building a board. These enclosures are beautiful and it's awesome to see how multiple people are contributing.

Very high chance I'll eventually be contacting @barajabali for the same 10S4P to be used in @jackw's enclosure. Can't properly express how excited I am to see the result of your board.

Finished my Vanguard build with 2x Type 3 enclosures from @Dunkirk. The back enclosure is holding a 10s2p battery and the front enclosure the 2x VESC (wanted all the bulk and weight in the back). I trimmed the front enclosure further down by almost a cm. They are perfect for my build!:) Detailed post will follow.

Hey what a surprise and yeah, what a shame!! It's not your fault for not looking me up because there wasn't anything to find, my bad for not posting anything sooner. I've been spending a while on this project but just haven't gotten around posting anything so far :confused:. How cool to have a travel board! Did you have any issues with airlines? I read that most won't take esk8s on board anymore as they consider them "self balancing scooters", even though technically that's not what they are. So apparently they won't take for example a Boosted board, even with battery removed. So I was wondering if I just detach all the components it should work, as I would have a longboard deck + electronic components... but anyways what's your take on this?

Yes if you want to start a thread about your flying experiences that would be great, because I feel that so far all of the discussion has been focusing on batteries. But if now they don't even want to take boards without the batteries that's a whole new story.
