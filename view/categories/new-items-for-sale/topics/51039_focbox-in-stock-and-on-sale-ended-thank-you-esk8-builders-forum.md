You sell torqueboard vesc? Are you guys working together? 
Price is lower than what torqueboards are selling them for?
It seems a bit fishy.

no, we only have the 2. they are brand new never used. we bought them for testing but really didn't get passed the FocBox on quality and size. 
we have them still a good esc, just not going to charge more than the 90 spent when bought. 
we will offer the maytech  super vesc as a low budget alternative to the FocBox or the ESCape we plan on using in custom builds.

thanks for the nudge, its hard sometimes to get credibility in the community. I understand the concern of being ripped off and sold something other than what was advertised. We don't operate like that if I can't provide the best that is out there then I won't offer it, thanks bro

Prices are bit low. Jason said before he doesn't want the price too low, that $155 was the price he researched and came up with as the best price for the focbox.

Basically, once one guy goes lower, everyone else has to also to compete, and then the price is the same as the bulk order price.

Not that i'm trying to complain about low prices, but this is exactly why I haven't restocked my focbox supply. I can't pay $136 per foxbox for bulk pricing, sell for $145, and offer free shipping. It's basically a broken system, which I why i am still looking for an engineer to do my own vesc design.

I agree and when we have some credibility and our stock numbers are down at a manageable number then it will be the suggested retail price. I've been sitting on 30 of them for 3 months while getting all of this together. So really I'm not making anything profit, just getting us out there. 
and I agree I would rather buy from the small guys like ESCape and photon remote, flexibms, etc

this sale is only to get our stock numbers down. I can't sit on 3000 dollars stock

Thanks Everybody for your support, Being new to the esk8 DIY arena we expected some hesitation. We understand the issues everyone faces when trying to source quality products for your builds. It seams everyone on here has gone through it at one point or another. My Brother and I want to change things in ways that benefit the end user and not just turn a profit. We have seen room/need for advancement across the board in safety, reliability, affordability, distance, capacity and customization. We don't want to lock anyone out, we want to work with those who have the same vision of possibilities. WE ride as a hobby/fun what is a clean renewable alternative mode of transportation that just happens to be the Fucking coolest thing ever....... So good to ride.......

THANK YOU ESK8 COMMUNITY
ALL ORDERS WILL BE SHIPPED ASAP, and to all those who placed an order today please feel free to email me with suggestions and wish lists and we will continue to improve and add more information for each product, thx again guys
( and yes I know some do use as a AMOT) its a good reason to sell your car

we just add those to the battery build line up and they could be mislabeled.   
I will double check that, we tested 4 different brands and the specs may have been mixed up. thank you for the heads up. I will get back to you with the correct information.

If that is so. I donâ€™t mind shipping it to him to be forwarded to you. As long as he is here in the states. 
Iâ€™m still exploring all option to get things shipped internationally.

Thanks everyone who placed orders, we didn't expect such a big response, but we welcome it. We have a over stock on FOCBOX controllers and wanted to bring that number down to something more manageable and help a few people save money. The response has been great and we thank you very much. We have worked hard on this new company and wish to consider our customer first when it comes to cost. 

the sale must end Thursday the 5th April at midnight so as not to disturb the balance with other suppliers. My brother and I intend on working with other suppliers to try and bring prices down and promote the little guy innovating the industry.......


again thank you for all your support.
For all who placed an order most should have tracking numbers and update emails, orders placed today and Thursday will ship by Saturday. any partial shipments will be updated ASAP

Just a quick THANK YOU to the community for the orders, all orders have shipped even the partial orders will be on there way Monday morning. With this first round of orders we have been able to find the right shipping methods for in the USA and out. International shipping is always tricky and expensive. We want to serve everyone but, not at an over cost to the customer. 
With that we will now be able to ship most orders at a 10$ flat 2day tracked shipping in the USA. depending on size 
Intentional will be a flat rate of 30$ again once over a certain size it goes up, but for most regular orders the flat rate applies. 

Our Goal is to bring products that are well made, affordable, dependable and available at a reasonable shipping cost and time.....

Once Again Thanks Guys for your orders, and most should have them and the guys out of state, I will keep my eye on your packages. 

To everyone who ordered FOCBOX's from me please check your thermal pads for film tape, I emailed everyone who ordered one, out of the 30 or so I've had I was only able to check 10, the rest went out before I could....... Note: out of the 10/ 7 had the tape.

SO PLEASE CHECK YOU FOCBOX FOR CLEAR FILM TAPE BETWEEN THE FETS AND THERMAL PAD, REMOVE IF FOUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

BIG THANKS TO THE ESK8 COMMUNITY, 
HYPER ION BROS
