<p class="MsoNoSpacing">Hey there my fellow esk8 builders!!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing">I recently visited <b><span style="color:#548DD4;mso-themecolor:text2;mso-themetint:153">enertionboards.com
</span></b>to finally buy a couple of esk8 items for my own build and I got a
little carried away by bulk purchasing a few <b>FOCBOX </b>units &amp; <b>Nano-X</b>
hand controllers! :p

![20180113_212113|690x388](upload://1AO6Agt3RJF2u9JYEBAu9RF5NNK.jpg)

![20180113_212238|690x388](upload://1OJtG8PDB7AI83SESSPpFtQGsx1.jpg)

I have spent every penny I have on import Duties, VAT &amp; unfortunate hidden fees (via my bank) & also a great time waiting for the items to arrive but I am now happy to offer these back to the esk8 community at a good price without the worry of hidden costs or long delivery times! :)

I have **16 FOCBOX**units & **3 Nano-X** hand controllers available here in the UK ready to post out ASAP to anybody located the **UK/Europe** who is interested… I’m looking for **£110 for each FOCBOX** & **£40 for each Nano-X** (Price Includes VAT) plus either **£8 Postage to UK** (Via ROYAL MAIL SPECIAL DELIVERY - 1PM NEXT DAY) or **£12 to EUROPE** (Via ROYAL MAIL INTERNATIONAL TRACKED & SIGNED DELIVERY - 3 to 5 Days)

PayPal fees **(@3.4% + £0.20)** will also need to be added & please use the PayPal **'Goods & Services'** payment option to send any payments to myself for the parts advertised. Do not use the **'Friends Family'** option as this is **'Not covered by Buyer Protection'** and has recently been brought to my attention that it is actually **'Against Forum Rules'** to pay in this way. Thanks!

**Also Note: As there is a limited supply of Nano-x (Only 3 Available), anybody interested in a Nano-X must also purchase at least 1 FOCBOX… Thanks! :)**

Im in the UK looking for a Nano-X.  I know you said you won't sell them on their own but if you change your mind or someone just wants the FOCBOX then happy to work something out.

I just bought two FOCBOX as well, one from Poland and one from France!

HAHA Yeah it was a bit of an impulse buy!  :nerd_face: (Quite a bit of effort in thee end too > Cancelling orders etc due to bank fees etc) & Thanks! Hopefully I can help a few people on the forum get a decent deal without all the hassle! ...

Yeah, importing stuff in EU or UK can be a drag. Always better in bulk. But too much bulk can get you in more trouble, there are some limits for personal use...

OK No worries! I think there may be a few people after the NANO X & It's a lot better deal with the FOCBOX so I feel its only fair to give those people priority but we shal see what the general vibe is & I will keep you updated! :slight_smile: 

Let me know if you change your mind & want a spare; I'm keeping 4 myself just in case I have any problems etc...

I don't think I really thought what I was gonna do with them upon purchasing although I do know how awkward it is to get hold of this stuff in the UK. Will pay all VAT etc but no bills as of yet! :S

As I said above these will get posted ASAP Via 1day delivery in the UK. Can't get better than that! ;D 3days to EUROPE isn't bad either so let me know if you are interested & I can get the packaging sorted sooon...

As this is early days I would like to see what the general interest is & give the people who want to purchase a FOCBOX the chance to have a good deal on the NANO X also.

Hope you understand & got a good deal on the NANO X! :wink:

OK, Cool! & yep they seem to be very well made IMO & nice & compact! :slight_smile: 

I will Add you to the list for the following:
**£125.94 =** Single FOCBOX **+ PayPal - Goods & Services (3.4% + £0.20)** + EUROPE P&P (£12)

I need to make a trip to the Post Office to see what Packaging options they have; I will do this soon before I have to leave for work...

Others selling FOCBOX have used Jiffy Bags & the FOCBOX's are already wrapped in bubble wrap. They seem well protected in there cases also so I think this would be OK. Would you be happy with this if I cant find any tiny Box's? lol

Thanks again!

Item will be covered up to £250 if any problems so all should be good! :nerd_face:

I've also added you to the list - No rush for payment atm until I've sorted Packaging but I will do this ASAP & get back to you! - Hopefully get this posted to you tomorrow at the latest if that is OK! (Once you have paid of course) lol

Sorry for the delay guys! I had to work until 23:00 :sob: :violin::violin::violin: & then have some quick food when I got home! :ramen::roll_eyes:

I have added everybody to the list! Hopefully with no mistakes made...

Thanks for the Payments @eightyeightmph & @KickMe, I will get your FOCBOX sent out by the end of tomorrow!!!

I assume that the last collection time at my local post office is around 16:00 (Unconfirmed atm) so if anybody else on the list gets money sent to me before around 13:00ish that would be great as I can then get everyones FOCBOX'S/NANO-X sent out quickly & at the same time! :slight_smile:

On another note; I kinda messed up & forgot to include the P&P costs in the Paypal fee calculation but my loss is your gains! :sleeping: lol >> I will also keep the current totals as they are for all future orders...

Thanks again y'all! :love_you_gesture:

Hey GrecoMan, Thanks for your input on the subject!

TBH I have changed the listing as I just don't have the time or energy to look into the subject any further...

I have read through the entire Topic linked above but couldn't find a definite statement to confirm that this is in fact 'Against the rules'. I have however removed the payment option purely in respect to the forum, the thoughts behind the idea & the fact that they are from a 'Leader' of the forum...

Hopefully it doesn't put anybody off purchasing my items & I think that it's quite obvious that a scammer would not recommend for their potential buyers to pay via 'Goods & Services' (as I did) or even inform potential buyers of the two different payment options...?

If this is a rule of the forum then it should definitely be clearly posted on the ''New Items For Sale'' page as a sticky as I myself was unaware of this & I'm sure many other sellers/buyers must be also!?

Anywayyy back to the Topic of this thread: Just an idea but for anybody that may want to double check my credibility as a seller feel free to check out my 100% positive feedback rating (from over 200 people) via my ebay account ''SnowSnaker_17''; send me a message & I can confirm its me! :stuck_out_tongue:

Yeah I'll take a photo. Thanks. You do mean a photo of the package so I can compare it with the condition of the package upon arrival right?

A photo of the package contents while being packed for shipment would also be nice for me to drool over until the many hours I get it in my hands.

Haha no need to take a photo but guess it wouldn't hurt! :slight_smile: just make sure you check over the packaging for damage before signing just incase! :wink: 

I have taken individual photos to prove the condition of each package prior to posting. (Just incase!) I can send these to everybody for reference if there are any problems (ie. Damage to packaging)

Not the best photos for drooling over but there you go! :smile:

Hi, 

A bit of background info first,

I'm in my final year studying Industrial Design in Wales. For my major project I get to design and make whatever I like (so long as I pay for all the bits), thus the opportunity has finally arisen for me to combine my hobby with my degree. 
Can't give to much away, other then that I'm attempting to make a sort of omnidirectional bike, for which I will need four FOCBOX esc's

Have you any left?

Will eat my entire food budget for the year, but I figure pasta is cheap.

Hey nthatchable,

Yep I have 7 FOCBOX Available atm so you can definitely take 4! :slight_smile:

Your project sounds interesting & very intriguing!! :thinking: 

It's good timing too if you are able to pay soon as I plan on posting the order out for riva_00 tomorroooow!

... So your order will be the following:
FOCBOX (x4) **+ PayPal Fee** + UK P&P = £463.16

Let me know if you are happy with that & I will Reserve them for you; If you would like them posted out to you tomorrow then go ahead and send the money too PayPal.Me/DanBeare/463.16 :money_mouth_face:

Hopefully you don't starve tooo much for this! :skull: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Hey JasperM,

I'm really sorry but I would like to keep this sale available to UK & EUROPE members only as I do not have the time to research other options and I do not want to risk receiving extra fees etc.

(I have had to let a few non UK/EU members down for the same reasons...)

Thanks for your interest & hope you understand! :confused:

No worries @sayekim!

& Thanks! It's always good to know when the items have been received unharmed!

Good luck with the Meepo upgrades!! :grinning:

I will probably be in contact sometime in the future regarding FOC mode etc but I have a lot of other parts to buy before I dive deep into the research of FOCBOX testing & setup.

No doubt like programming many other electronic components, lots of reading will be involved & things such as the versions & settings will need to be triple checked bore changing anything! :nerd_face: Fun times!

Good luck & Thanks again!!

If he doesn't want them then they are yours! :slight_smile: 

Just to confirm, the price would be:
’>> Dual FOCBOX **+ PayPal Fee** + UK P&P = **£235.68**

If you don't mind hanging around for a bit then I will give you a definite answer ASAP!

THANKS!

If they are available, I will definitely have them. 

Just off to work, appreciate that I am second in reserve and you are waiting to hear back from first reservist before confirming they are available to me. However I now won't be back home until this evening, so unable to pay until tonight...after 19:40 GMT.... So, please don't release to third reservist until I get chance to pay :)

Yes "the cat" is being re-done with FOCBOX's, technically it doesn't need it, but i'm also re-doing the drive wheels as 3d printed hubs, along with new 12/15mm belts and going to use Evolve's extra-wide gullwing hangars.
Should be done by the time my legs back to full strength. But i think i may like building more than riding.....
