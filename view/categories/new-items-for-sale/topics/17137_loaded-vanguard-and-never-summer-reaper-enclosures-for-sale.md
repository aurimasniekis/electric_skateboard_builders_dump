I have a couple questions regarding the enclosures and what can/ cannot fit in this.

I was looking to do this like 6-8 months ago but people were not at the level they are now with the 3d prints/molds etc. I was curious what is the max spec hardware you can throw on this board dual motor etc and what kind of performance you can fit in it. Also how about cable management has the grooves/cuts in the board been easier to perform?

On this enclosure you can fit a 10S4P, on Samsung 25R you will have 360WHr on Samsung 30Q you could 432WHr, that's 20% range, I usually squeeze 40km of range on the 25R on moderate riding.

On the VESC enclosure you can fit 2 VESC v4.12, just need to bend the caps in order to make them fit correctly, I also have a bluetooth HM-10, the receiver and a 3 XT90 (two for each VESC and one splitter)

The channeling on top of the board is pretty easy to do with a Dremel, it would be much easier with a router.

In fact this build it's pretty easy once you see some pictures of how people done it

That's amazing man! Thanks for letting me know!

Just a small advice, try to mount the battery enclosure almost hitting the front truck, just leave 2mm of gap, that'll make your board look way nicer as if the truck and enclosure are one piece.

On the VESC enclosure try to mount it as close to the motors as you can, but not as close that it hits the motor mount at full carve, you will leave the center part of the deck free for full flex.

In order to make the holes on the board with precision, use a pencil tomark center of the hole and a wood drill bit with guides as this one:

Also use nutserts for the deck:

Hello Eboosted,   

I look forward to using your enclosures. 

I am thinking about the components I should use (BMS vs no BMS setup, anti-spark switch vs XT90-anti-spark, etc).

The first question that I am trying to decide is what is the best way to attach the battery pack to the deck.   I see 2 possible options:

1.   Attach the battery pack directly to the deck with tape, and then cover it by the enclosure.   This is what I am currently doing with my LiPo batteries.   The main benefit is that the weight of the battery is carried by the tape, so I don't need to be paranoid about making a super strong connection between the enclosure and the deck.

2.  Attach the batteries and all components to the enclosure (with tape, glue, or silicone?)    I want 100% water-proof setup,  so I plan to cover cover the whole enclosure by a layer of rubber and glue it to the enclosure along the edges.   Then attach this enclosed battery to the deck by screws.   This will be a modular and waterproof setup with easy to remove battery (good for travel, etc.)

My main concern with this option is whether 4 screws will provide a strong connection to the deck to carry the whole weight of 10S4P battery.   In the original Boosted board, they have 3 times smaller battery attached by 6 screws.

I am planning to use M4 screws.   I have nice low-profile nut inserts for M4 screws that should be good for thin Loaded Vanguard deck.

Will 4 M4 screws be enough to carry the weight of 10S4P battery?
```

## \#56 Posted by: Eboosted Posted at: 2017-07-13T20:58:50.276Z Reads: 354

```
Just let the battery loose between the enclosure and the deck, if you attach the battery to the deck or enclosure you will suffer everytime you need to diassemble it.

With 4 bolts you have a mora than enough secure fixation, just use nutserts attached to the deck.

Tips:
- Use locktite for the M4 allen bolts that will hold the enclosure
- Buy Neoprene to seal the enclosure and avoid rattling inside it

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0089FMXN0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

- Regrip the deck after installing the enclosures and before mounting the truck bolts, use MOB grip tape, pretty nice stuff:

https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/products/71108/mob-grip-medium-coarse-grit-black-11-width-grip-tape

- Use Zealous bearings, military strong and easier than runing spacers:

That looks tremendous! So I'm new. Please bear with me. I see you have 40 cells in there. Making that ideal for a 10s4p battery right? I also see 2 Vesc's. Would I need 2 speed controllers for a duel drive? Thought I could somehow do duel drive with one. haha steep learning curve here. I believe this is the enclosure to get everything I need under protection. How much?

I've just received Vanguard enclosures from Eboosted.  They look sleek and sexy.  Nice design!  

Also got 40 Samsung 30Q cells from 
https://liionwholesale.com/collections/batteries/products/samsung-inr18650-30q-battery-15a-3000mah-flat-top-wholesale-discount-genuine-and-tested?variant=2915614724   

Now I am just waiting for an Arduino spot welder to start working on a new 10S4P battery pack.   This is definitely going to be a huge upgrade from my current setup with LiPo batteries.

I might even try to make a plane friendly battery designed by Eboosted that can be taken apart into 5 parts.

A quick question:  Has anyone actually travelled by plane with such a battery without any issues?

Another question:   What are you using for isolation around the positive end of cells when spot welding a battery pack?   I've seen on youtube that some people attach round things (not sure how they are called) at the positive ends of cells, while other people spot weld battery packs without them.  Sorry for asking this newbie question, that was probably answered many times elsewhere.  This is going to be my first project with spot welding a battery.

Please please make a build thread of your battery or at least include it in your board built log. I am interested to see how this battery will turn out since I am thinking of making a super similar one.

I've just received an Arduino spot welder. I going to start playing with it.

It looks from the pictures that in the battery for Vanguard designed by Eboosted the battery connectors are in the front of the enclosure.   Since I plan to use FOC mode, I'd like to minimize the length of the cables from the battery to VESC as much as I can.  So I am thinking to change the design a bit by placing the battery connectors in the back part of the enclosure (closest to VESC's).   I think that with careful planning there should be just enough space in that part to put an anti-spark switch and an LED battery indicator.   I am going to put a BMS and a charging port in the front part of the enclosure.  I am going to use the BMS for charging only, so placing it in the front part should not affect the length of the battery cable.    Has anybody made a battery like this?

I have a few other beginner battery builder questions:

1.  After spot welding, do you isolate cell connectors with silicone or something else?

2.  What are you using for isolation between the left and the right part of the battery?

3.  What heat shrink wrap do you use for this battery? 

4.  What gauge wire is good for balance wires?  I am thinking about using 20 AWG.

5.   What is the correct scheme for connecting the components where BMS is used only for charging?  (I have a wiring diagram in my mind, but I want to double check it before I start soldering.)

6.  What connectors are you using for the battery?   In my first build I used XT60 and 5mm bullet connectors, which used quite a lot of space in the enclosure.  So now I am thinking to use more compact 4mm bullet connectors.  But I am not sure that they are enough to handle the current of a 10S4P battery.

That's great, thanks for the update.

The enclosure is pretty flexible and hard at the same time, you will find out when you mount the bolts to hold it.

@Smorto here are the steps to make the vanguard battery pack:

Step 1
Hot glue the cells
[img]http://i.imgur.com/5wHVivP.jpg[/img]

Step 2
Spotweld them with nickel strips, solder the balance leads and heat wrap the battery

Eboosted, thanks a lot for the pictures!    I hope to make something like this.   

I am trying to decide about the size of nickel strip (thinking to use either 8mm x 0.15mm or  10mm x 0.15mm).

Are you using 3 (or 4?) nickel strips stop welded on top of each other for series connections?

I am also considering reinforcing series connections with flat copper cable, but I am not sure that such battery with a few mm of extra width would fit into the enclosure.

Thanks.   It is good to know that just one nickel strip works fine.   

But I am confused about this.  From what I read in other threads on this forum (for example, here http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/battery-building-what-nickel-strips-do-you-use/6202),  one 8mm x 0.15mm nickel strip can carry about 8 amps current.  For series connections (assuming that you are connecting both the top and bottom layer of the battery by a strip) we get 16A.   But (if I understand correctly) an esk8 battery should be able to handle at least 30A (probably better 60A in peaks). 

Another question:  How do you connect the left and right parts of the battery?   Do you spot weld them by a nickel strip and then fold it in half?   Do you reinforce this connection (by hot glue or something else)?  Since it is folded, I feel that there is a higher chance that this connection might break.

After watching this scary video of an esk8 on fire:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/some-fun-video-of-my-longboard-exploding/26120

I feel that I should be extra careful when building my first battery.   I'd like to incorporate some safety features in my setup.  So, in addition to an antispark switch, I'd like put XT90S loop key on one of the cables running from the battery to VESC.   This may not look as sleek as a setup where all cables are hidden under the grip tape.  But I am willing to sacrifice looks for safety.

I am also thinking about a fuse.  Does anybody use a fuse in a Vanguard built?

## \#78 Posted by: DougM Posted at: 2017-07-26T02:01:56.421Z Reads: 285

I ended up doubling up on the strips.  So spot weld the first strip down and then spot weld another strip right over the top of it.  That solved my Insufficient thickness problem.  

Also, if you are covering any significant length, like more than an inch, use wire rather than strips.

Getting ready to spot weld

BTW, I noticed one weird thing when I checked voltages of all 40 cells.   The voltages are mostly around 3.58 - 3.59 Volt.  But in each pack of 5 cells, the first cell has slightly lower voltage around 3.54 Volt.   The lowest one is 3.52 Volt.    I hope that all this is within margins of admissible variations.   But I am wondering why it always was the first cell in a pack that had a lower voltage.

The safest thing to do is to balance all cells before spot weld them.

My charger has several settings: charge, balance charge, discharge, etc.   I set it on "charge" and on 1s since it is charging only a single cell at a time.  This way I don't need to connect balance lead.  I also set it on very low current like 0.4 A.

1. Position the enclosure in place with bar clamps
2. Mark the 4 points when the bolts will be positioned
3. Drill the holes all the way through the enclosure and deck
4. Remove the bar clamps
5. Install the hex socket insert nuts on the deck
6. Mount the enclosure and secure them with the bolts, use washers to get a good grip on the enclosure 

The size of the drill bit should be selected according to the insert nut size you select

You could also use black conical seat screws in order to get a flushed finish, in this case washers won't be necessary, the material is pretty tough

I used m3 rivet nuts like this

the smallest size I could find.  They fit thin Vanguard deck pretty good & look  great even without grip tape on top of them:

Also you don't need to make huge holes in the deck.

A little tip:  With this kind of nuts it is very important to make holes of correct size to ensure a tight fit.  Otherwise a rivnut might rotate in a hole.  So I used a drill bit slightly smaller than a rivnut, and then filed holes with a round file.

Yes 10s4p, a 10s5p could be manufactured but just for 1 enclosure is going to be more expensive.

Why would you need a 10s5p on a vanguard build, these builds are supposed to be light and have a Boosted board like shape, not a monster battery on the front that messes with the a belt lines

Use the Vanguard enclosure on the icarus!

You will have extra space available as this is meant for 10s4p

Hi Alan,

Forgive my ignorance, but what are the internal dimensions of the ESC enclosure? I was wondering if you could fit two focboxes inside there, perhaps stacked on top of each other?

Any chance the vanguard enclosure would work with this battery? https://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/stealth-packs-ldjyr
It seems to fit the dimensions you listed..

You won't be able to fit that battery in a Vanguard enclosure. You need to stack them in two layers, look for my build thread and gmfollow my instructions, of you are not able to build the battery get someone to do it for you.

Yeah I have no idea how to build a battery sorry. Is there any way a custom 12s battery could fit in there? If so could u point me towards someone who could build the battery for me?

That won't work so well. The Icarus has a lot more camber, concave and wheel wells. Way to many gaps, definitely not seal able

But they do fit perfect with a vanguard, and the quality is impeccable. 

Speaking of which @Eboosted  what would you need to make a Icarus specific enclosure?

@Deckoz I suggest to stick some griptape on the bottom of the deck and start sandind the enclosure down with circular movements until it fits perfectly to the deck, if the enclosure ends up short, just use a rubber gasket glued to the deck, if done correctly you will have a pristine finish, the fiberglass material I used is hard but easy to work on.

Nice. But I was either considering sending you a mold of the deck. Or building a mold myself

What do you use as your plug/buck material when you design new enclosures?

I am thinking about the same combination Caldera deck + Eboosted 12S enclosure.   Have you already got them?  How well do they fit each other?

Won't be getting Eboosted 12s enclosure.

By the way, what is the purpose of the rectangular impression at the end of the Vanguard battery enclosure (and at both ends of your one-piece enclosures).   Is this just an element of design (kind of a trademark), or these impressions actually have some functional purpose?

It's to drill to place a charger port and power button...to act as a recessed panel so the port and button are less likely to get hit going over bumbs/curbs @sash

@Deckoz I also first thought that it is for ports.   But if you look at the pictures in this thread, in Vanguard builds (as well as in my build) the ports are on the side of the enclosure and not in this rectangular area.   If you put the charging port and power button in this area, I am not sure there will be enough space for a BMS.   In my setup this rectangle acts as a support on which the BMS lies.

Yes, of course.

I'm building a website to offer the available enclosures atm.
