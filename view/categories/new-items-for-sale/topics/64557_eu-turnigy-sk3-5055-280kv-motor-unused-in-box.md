Hi, I think im ready to part with my sk3 280kv motor. (It has 6mm axle, so look out what pulleys u plan to use)

It was intended to be used on friction drive ebike build but in the end, I ordered a different motor and heat is a problem for these motors when pressed against a wheel and maybe even having a 'cover' to make it bigger.

So in short, I dont plan to use the motor anymore, and if anybody has a plan to use, feel free to write a PM.

Price for the motor: **35 Eur** 

Shipping cost depends, but I think it can be below **10 Eur** to most EU countries.
