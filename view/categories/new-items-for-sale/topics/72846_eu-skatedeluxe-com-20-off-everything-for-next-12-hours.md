Any inspiration what I could buy? I have currently some bearings tsg pass and tsg dhps...
Are the tsg dhps running small or large? And should I measure real thigh or just above the knee?

don't know about TSG sizes, don't have any of their products.
I bought loaded basalt tesseract, cheap sliding gloves, hip protection and some hardware. 
search from category to category, you will find things you don't even need :D but hurry up, 20 mins left!
