And insight on thermals? Let‚Äôs say that running a non sealed 6355 gets warm (+- 50 ‚Ä¢C), do I risky overheating these motors?

I‚Äôm tired of opening them to remove debris

they run cool so thermals are not an issue.  

hub motors tend to be the motors that get really hot

if you purchase through a company that is VAT registered that will bring the price down 20% :slight_smile:

Unfortunately cost prices are going up on everything from parts to accountant fees and everything else :frowning: Plus the pound has tanked which doesn't help things.

It's a right PIA isn't it!

The amount of dust and crap I have pulled out of motors is insane, and anything metal seems to just get pulled right up into the motors.

I will test print a cover to make them sealed and see what happens, but first have to open again and remove yet another rock, hope to have not broken a magnet since its making a lot of noise

totally my pleasure mister :slight_smile:

Good to know the emails are working correctly, just did some work on the site's backend, thanks for the confirmation.

It's really unlikely you will have any issues with the parts, but if you do please get in contact and I will get it sorted out straight away.

Someone recently posted that DIY e-skate stores have better support before you make the purchase, but not so much after. I am determined to make sure Street Wing continues to be the exception to that rule.

üòÇüòÇ damn.  It‚Äôs funny but so true.   Man.  Your product seems legit.  I don‚Äôt think there will be any issues but I sure will let ya know if that‚Äôs the case!!     And I think I speak for a lot of members of the forum when I say.   Thank you for keeping customer support legit even after you‚Äôve made the sale.   A lot of companies kinda fail at exactly that.

These get slightly hotter than the non sealed motors, but I haven't reached any temps on my 6374 that would worry me...

Winding temp insulation rating is 100¬∞C according to manufacturer.

Motor has a (properly working üòÅ) temp sensor.

For those who might be concerned about temperature with sealed motors.  Lacroix runs on the same style sealed motors ‚Äúprobably the same exact manufacturer ‚Äú  at 800+ miles I have had nothing but good luck with them.    They take quite a beat down going up n down San Francisco hills and shitty roads.  Always jamming with the bay esk8 crew and they not once have become loose or overheated     With that being said.    Buy n Enjoy some good quality shit üëçüèº![image|281x500](upload://kGZ4r6s0p84FGO28X3dQ2VzYuQv.jpeg)

Got a pair in order. Given I live in NW UK, in a region so flat it's laughable, I have no concerns at all about heat with these units.

Plus they look mint üëç

@DavidBanner all prices are with 20% VAT right? Buying from outside EU would be 20% cheaper?

Yes that's right :slight_smile:

The site should display prices without VAT for people visiting from outside the EU.  If you want to check add something to the basket and at the checkout page there is a separate entry for VAT which is removed once you select an address outside of the EU.
