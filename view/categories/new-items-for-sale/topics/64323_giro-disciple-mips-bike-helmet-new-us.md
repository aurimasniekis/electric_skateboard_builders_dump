Only worn to test fit  for a few mins around the house. 
Got on sale recently to be sure I had a full Helm when my board was complete.
But I've got the chance to buy a Pass helmet and selling this would make it easier to convince my wife to spend more money this month. 
I can still return for a full refund but thought I might offer it to someone looking for a good helmet at a decent price.
I paid $150ish 
They are on sale now for $154 down from $220.
I'll sell for $120 shipped in the US.
Size large.
If no bites by the weekend I'll just return and get a full refund.

Have the same in black, can just recommend it. Would take if I wouldnâ€™t already have one.

It's really comfortable, and I hate helmets.
