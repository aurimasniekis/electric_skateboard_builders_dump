Hello,

This is my second time selling this type of enclosure. The last one went in seconds. It is a mastercho large sized enclosure. Honeycomb carbon fiber weave. It will cost you $145 coming from mastercho buying the honeycomb weave and sending it his way for the build. Ill sell this for $60 plus shipping from CA.
