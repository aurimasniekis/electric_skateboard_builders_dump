Hi, guys just wanted to notify that since today we are finally VAT free for customers outside of European Union. We finally have an agreement with our postal office to provide necessary documents for VAT exemption for non-EU customers.

In product page you can see price with/without VAT as our majority customers are from US ;)

Dude this is fantastic news! Congrats. 

The cost difference between those wheels and superstars is even more tempting now that VAT is out of the picture.

Just wanted to mention to everybody who is PM & emailing me that post offices these days are really busy and packages will probably arrive later than usually so please be patient and wait. More information is mostly available in your local post office website tracking page using same tracking number (USPS for US) which will provide much more information than our local post office website.

If somebody still wants to receive some stuff this year I am suggesting to use UPS shipping as post office mentioned that packages shipped at this time will arrive next year mostly. 

In few days I am leaving for my trip to Japan so I will not be responding so quickly as usually so if you have some question you will need to wait for the moment I will be online to respond to them :slight_smile:

Just in case I will not have internet on holiday days I would like to wish everybody Merry Christmas & Happy New Year
