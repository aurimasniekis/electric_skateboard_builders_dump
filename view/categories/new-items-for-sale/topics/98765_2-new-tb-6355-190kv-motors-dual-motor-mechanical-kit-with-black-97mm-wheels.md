Both are brand new. The only thing missing from the mechanical kit are the risers and some spacers. 

Asking $350 shipped for everything. Located in California. Paypal Invoice only. 

Thanks!

I'm beginning to source my build now.  I know what risers are.  What are spacers?  If they're easy to find I will buy your kits.

Hi

I think it's the bearing spacers which you can get here, or pretty much anywhere :slight_smile:
