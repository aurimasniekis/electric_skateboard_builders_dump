Hello All,

We have a treat for those interested in that sweet carbon fiber and stealth looking esk8 board while keeping the belly hump to a minimum. This board has been in the works for awhile now (over a year) but due to some unforeseen issues in our previous retail product the "ECHO" it was put on the back burner. Our intention was to release this as a fully built retail board later this year or early 2019. 

Unfortunately time is flying by and the board is just too perfect to keep in the closet any longer so we've decided to release it first to the esk8 DIY community.  

Here's the details

**WHAT FITS INSIDE?**
* Dual Vesc 4.12
* 10s2p-3p 18650 battery with bms mounted in the front of the cells  (Charge only bms recommended)
* Motor wire Cable Management Channeling
* Cover made out of Aluminum (We will provide the STL if you would like to make your own cover)

**Deck Size:**
* 35 in. Length
* 25 in. Wheelbase
Internal compartment size - Width = 138mm  , Height 20mm, Length = 415mm 

Material and core:
* core: PVC foam, from diab group
* carbon fiber layers: 10 plies UD prepreg, 3k twill woven as top layer, glossy finish

**WHATS INCLUDED?**

* 1x Board
* 1x Cover
* 10 bolts for cover (Screw, Flat, Socket-Head, Steel, M3 Thread, 8mm Length, Steel, black luster)

**PRICE**
@MOQ of 20 units  ()
$170.00
This is the current price but we are negotiating with manufacturer if we have more than 20 buyers this can be lowered and if the price is lowered we will refund the difference.
**SHIPPING** 
Working on details having them shipped directly from our Manufacturer in China) otherwise
Should be around $25 - $30 and we can ship to most countries shipped (Shipped from California)

If you live locally in Southern California then we can arrange pickup for quicker delivery 
Orange County/LA/Riverside County area  (Pickup would save you the $25-$30 )

Lets Poll for who would be interested first and then if we have the numbers we will add the product to our site and arrange go from there. 

I don't want to start collecting money like some companies may or may not do without knowing we even have enough people to get this going.

[poll type=multiple min=1 max=2 public=true]
* Will buy now
* Interested but cannot buy now
[/poll]

Can you give us dimensions of the enclosure?
Also i know its a carbon fiber deck but does it by any chance have any flex? I do like a slight bit of flex in my decks.

Very interesting, can it be made longer. 38 is ok for smaller people. Big guys need the length and a few more inches for a bigger battery wouldnâ€™t hurt. Like a 10s4p or 5p

I'm big boy so I feel ya on this input.  I'm 6'3 and I usually rock a 38 - 41 inch board myself because of my size. 
 Can't make it any bigger unfortunately as the molds are made for this board for over a year now and we'd have to buy a new mold.

As we grow mature as a business making multiple molds is the goal.

From a perspective a portability, I'd love to see a version that is 5'' shorter (30'' total) and capable of fitting a 10s2p flatpack or 12s2p. I love the fact that you designed in a kicktail. I'm decently tall ~6' but would like a shortboard just for convenience sake

Does the channeling go from the top down? Do you connect the phase wires next to the truck? I'm a bit confused from your CAD images.

I'll say if your 6ft or taller like me, holding this board makes me feel like a giant holding a small cruiser deck.

You'll want a truck riser pad and cut out so you can route the wires right in from the cutout we made in the deck. Those Riptide riser pads that just came out are perfect.

Also if I mall grab the deck by the trucks the nose will not hit the ground.

I feel the 10s4p range but I gotta say range on the 10s3p is not too far off from a 4p. Also mixed with the right gear ratio you'll be super efficient.

And if you do a 2p swapping could be done in less time than a boosted board so that's a plus. :)

I think that's too small for most DIY builds. It'll probably be a perfect deck for a production board though. Although even a production board could benefit from some more cells.

Appreciate the feedback. @myreala 
These are the categories I really see it fits in:

1. Lightweight, Portable
2. Slim, Stealth, Sleek and Sexy
3. 15-20 miles of range (Depends on weight, avg speed, terrain etc.)
4. Easy to install components, close the LID and call it a day.
5.  Comfortable Concave (Not found in most Carbon Fiber Boards)
6. Easy Swap for batteries.

Because it can be used as a DIY we will give members the ability to cut out their own lids out of any material they want by providing the solidworks files.

Thanks for the feedback. Always great to hear back from the community. I definitely see the reasoning for a larger board and it would be something we consider in the future. This design unfortunately if made longer to accomodate the larger battery it would have made the board significantly thicker and heavier. Also there could be an increase in the susceptible  damage of pressure cracks, similar to evolve board issues seen in the past. 

Also we really concentrated on keeping it as slim as possible and structurally safe. 
Slim = less whale belly syndrome as I like to call it :) 

P.s. as we are very confident in the structural integrity we also provide a 1 year warranty for all of the decks.

Lol


All jokes aside it shouldn't be an issue, maybe a few bucks more shipping but we'll work it out. I've shipped boards to Canada before with batteries and it's just a matter of declaring the correct product type. Canada can be a pain when it comes to battery importing.

As @Winfly linked the dimensions. It should fit  Recommend to have the bms in front of the battery as the bms is top mounted but should fit none the less according to the sites specs. Careful though I have a feeling that .5 might be an issue because normally with the bms on top you'll be at 20.5mm or 21mm

Okay, wrapping this up. We've got confirmation 3 to 4 weeks to make these units and just a week or so for delivery depending on your location. I'm  having them wrap up a new cover sample for me with all the waterproofing needed (slight design change) and then we'll add the item to our shop for folks to buy. I'll keep everyone  updated.  If you have not added your vote to buy please note this is just a one time only buy for the next 12 months because well be tied up with launching and physically building out our pulseboard CF belt drive models for our upcoming campaign.

Thanks for the support and I'm super excited to see this board being modded up with some sweet builds from hubs to carvon to the all popular geared drive units out there.

This deck will be a nice lil light rocket build to rip the city with.
 can't fit alot in the enclosure but just enough for a commuter 10s3 or 12s2 power build..
keep light to Carrie around with no problem..my lil blink s at 8-9 lbs I use as a commuter..to slow at 22k tho but great for the tight city life ..my blink s2 is a pain but doable at 18 pounds but it's garbage after my new carvon speed drive build..those are weapons on there own..
this deck will be light and small much better if your in heavy congested city from what I've experienced from living In the country and working in the city..big heavy is no fun to Carrie for long time walking or to commute on trains and busses..

Hey guys, sorry for being MIA. My grandmother passed away 2 weeks ago and today and tomorrow we celebrate her life and I've been swamped with helping my family coordinate things. I'll provide an update Nd go live with link to so those interested can save their spots for the limited  20 boards we will be able to offer. Again this 20 units is only because we are still managing the setup of our campaign for our new board coming out.  

Stay tuned!

Cool looking project! What is the group buy count at right now? If I place an order, am I charged immediately? I feel a bit nervous about placing an order for a board that is on its first production run and is essentially a group buy but charges me immediately.

Excited to hear more, and thanks!

Once we have all 20 orders it is 3 to 4 weeks for manufacturing  approx 7 days to ship based on location. Recently there was a typhoon which flooded the manufacturing warehouse for our covers so we are pending covers to be made at this point. Our contact in China started they have to recover from typhoon, I am finding out what time delay this may cause now. Weather is just not on our side atm.

Bamboo as it will add some class..I think.. be nice to see it on on ..but zenit has a really nice deck with carbon and wood mix  maybe a option can we get a stain to it.. darker..or a cherry stain..just a thought..as i was gonna get the aluminum cover carbon fiber wrap or grip it anyways so if I don't like the bamboo I'll wrap or grip it ..so I say bamboo..

Hey Guys, 
So shipping cost have come back and I've been getting clarification from the customs broker we are using because some of the cost is much cheaper using China Post service but tracking can be very .....iffy... so the price without VAT/Taxes is $130 via fedex for most countries. (It's always the shape that kills cost, unless shipping them in multiples to each country then the cost is split and more affordable).

For those who messaged me directly about your country I have responded to most but if I missed you please send me another message so I can verify the import tax cost if any.

SO far we have the following countries

France
United Kingdom
Belgium
Netherlands
Australia
Canada
U.S.
Ukraine

Right now there is a concern on the total orders with our international orders (sent to me via PM) and the U.S. orders the total is 2 Belgium, 1 Netherlands, 1 Canada, 1 Ukraine, 1 Australia, 1 United Kingdom, 1 France
5 U.S.

Total = 13
Not far off but still not 20,

Update on Cover:
It will be a bamboo fiber glass composite and the sample was pending to be shipped to me before the typhoon so I'm still waiting for the manufacturer to get back, shouldn't be much longer. 

I'll give another update in a few days.
```
