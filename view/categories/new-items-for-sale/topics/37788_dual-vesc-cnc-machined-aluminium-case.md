Hi, Friends!

Long story short, my father is making CNC machined stuff and for a year he is making and selling VESC cases single and dual configuration in other websites (Vedder, eBay and etc.).

So today I present Dual VESC CNC machined aluminium case

I can vouch for these things.  Before I got one (thanks @scepterr) my fets were getting as high as 60 degrees.  after my 35 mile ride yesterday, I never saw my fets go above 34

A heads up for folks, if you have a TB vesc or any vesc with the same size electrolytic caps, you will need to replace them. 
If you have this cap, you're fine, they fit without issue https://www.mouser.com/Search/ProductDetail.aspx?R=UPW1J681MHD6virtualkey64700000virtualkey647-UPW1J681MHD6

I should mention I love these cases, using 6 of the singles right nowüòù

Mmm good point.

I would expect that the alloy used in your father's designs (and I have seen it firsthand) would give better heat transfer if you took the focbox apart and placed it in whatever you could come up with, then if it were simply designed to just press against the existing focbox casing. And it is so simple anyone can take a focbox apart with just a hex key.

So I would suggest a case which is for a disassembled focbox...single and dual.

I think there is dimensions available somewhere, if not I can lend you one.

The main thing would be to make it as water resistant as possible. I have not used the single vesc cases that I bought yet but I have already thought a  bit about water resistance, there are grommets for the wires if I remember correctly.

But you could 'up your game' in that department by 3d printing flexible filiment seal for the aloy top/bottom bodies and also a cover for the usb port...oh and use cable glands for the wires exits (just need to machine threads for them

:)

I don't really think many people would like to take it apart as I guess it will void the warranty.

Meh I think enertion don't regard it as a voiding of warranty IIRC, they do not like the flashing of custom firmware however.
Ah yes I remember, there was an issue with some focboxes and some wrong components and enertion have an alert to open up the focbox and take a look yourself..

Also there is no warranty sticker to circumvent

Also there is hardly any warranty(60 days) if you do not pay the extra price and few do AFAIK

Just an idea.  If you could spread out the footprint by 0.75in you would have enough room to include a BT module and most receivers in the dual case as well.  I must say I am impressed, just got mine in and working on installing x2 TB VESC(s) as I have free moments.

I also think a foxbox dual would sell well. Especially if it was fairly water tight and could be mounted to the board directly, not in another enclosure. As to weather it should have the focbox taken apart or not? I don't think the DIY community would be very concerned about the warranty. If you don't disassemble it just going to be a bit thicker.

I see there is high demand for custom style cases like dual focbox and etc. There is a possibility to make it happen, but on condition that we collect orders and then manufacture them to prevent the cases then large quantity is made and nobody buys. So if anyone interest in this kind of concept we can try then.

P.S. This Friday there will be Winter Clearance Sale with 25% discount on cases.

I am by no means a machinist but the easiest way would be to ditch the plastic cover of the focbox and use the aluminum base only. I think it would be easier and faster to mill flat surface rather than the raised section for the fets and the lowered section for the capacitors...
```

## \#52 Posted by: lrdesigns Posted at: 2017-12-14T00:58:39.165Z Reads: 151

My vote is for space for a receiver. 

I think I prefer to take the focbox apart as it will be thinner overall. But if its significantly cheaper to make with just the flat bottom I would probably prefer that.
```

## \#53 Posted by: banjaxxed Posted at: 2017-12-14T14:12:15.545Z Reads: 153

I think consensus is leaning towards removing the Focbox plastic shield and keeeping the aluminium baseplate & incorporating that into the design with associated savings if any.

Most builders with the funds for custom enclosures are going to be using dual focbox, trust me on that point.
They will also like the fact that CAN comms will be internal to the enclosure and not from one case to another. They absolutely will need space for a receiver & almost certainly require space for a bluetooth module.

Consider the possibility of using cable glands instead of grommets, they provide more stress relief and are more water resistant in general - PG9 threading, a gommet could be provided as well should the person not want to get their cable glands.


This will be killer dude! Can't wait for my VESC-X to get to you.

I highly doubt that it will be cheaper to go with existing alu baseplate cause than making the case it will begin from the same solid block fo aluminum so I don't see much difference apart work time. But will see then we get focbox. I will be able to provide more info as I am traveling back home tonight.

In case you are working on a dual focbox enclosure, wondering if the heatsink performance can be increased by moving away from a single alu piece. Just an idea, but perhaps POM can be used in combination with alu inlays for each individual direct FET.

With the stock enclosure there is a thick stack of thermal tape in between the alu heatsink and the direct fets. I doubt that this is efficient and in fact I have managed to hit the thermal threshold in the middle of winter on a hill climb. 

By isolating the individual heatsinks with the actual enclosure made out of pom you don't need thermal tape.

Imagine a square cutout in the pom case for each alu piece.

The thermal tape has highest thermal conductivity for the isolator. POM has really shitty thermal conductivity. The problem is lack of aluminium mass to absorb the heat. With our all enclosed case, I was able to hit vesc4 with even higher current than it was supposed to hold with low temps.

I know that direct fets need to be insulated. 

Forget what I previously wrote. If you could insulate and cool each direct FET with individual heatsinks with a thin layer of thermal paste as opposed to using a thermal insulating tape and an single heat sink for all fets, which design would be more efficient?
