Hey guys, so after building quite a few batteries (7) and there haven't been any problems with them I feel pretty confident to start this "service" :smiley:

The reason why I'm starting this is mostly my ultra shitty financial situation atm, i got to survive somehow heh :upside_down_face:

I welded some of my old cells as a reference, the welds are not the fanciest looking but they take the abuse I threw at them pretty good (pushing the batteries in opposite directions, trying to split it together, pushing one cell up and the other down tldr none of them broke)
The cells will be welded with fish paper insulation on the positive terminal, the sharp edges from cutting nickel will be eliminated all the wires and soldered spots will of course also come insulated
you can choose between 10 and 12 awg and 

I can process these orders within days of the cells arriving to me.
Shipping will be handled by GLS as they seem to accept batteries and they are economical, around 30€ I believe

Im trying to offer an affordable option so heres the pricing formula

Price=cells from nkon + 10€ delivery + 15€ materials from nkon (nickel strip, shrink etc +bms (around 20€)+ 10€ per cell in parallel

So a 10S4P 30q = 205€ + 30€ charge only bms
        12S4P 30q = 240€+ 30€ charge only bms


Also heres a link to some pictures, there are no holes in the nickel, i couldn't get the angle right for some reason to make it look as it does irl, those welds that look like they burnt thru are basically welds where the nickel melted a bit.

This is very affordable price. I don't need it now but hopefully when I change country, I'll need. What safety redundancies you use?

Do you mean something like cell level fusing?
If the buyer wants it, I can do it for him but that is much more work, I did it one for my friends ebike battery.

Is the BMS all good for charging and discharging? Also would it be possible for you to add a charging port, a power switch and a battery meter? What would the price be for a pack with all of those?

## \#10 Posted by: Acido Posted at: 2018-07-24T13:21:44.492Z Reads: 229

```
Charge only bms from bestech is included in the price
If you menage to find a discharge type or have your own we can use that too
I do not have any power switches but they are just plug and play right? I never used one...
Battery meter is 7$

@koralle Yes I know that it is not the best pack I have sold, I know the community is against wires between the nickleoff the cells. There is kapton tape between the nickle. I think my other packs are good. If you have any recommendations for me let me know.
