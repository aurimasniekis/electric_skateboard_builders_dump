An open source system **designed for _maximum flex_, _twist_, _compression_, and _distortion_**. Its an _insurance policy_ for your expensive electrics. One that _fully_ protects. Its the only enclosure you'll ever need. 

As an **expandable system of modules (each housing a _2s4p_ pack or two _2s2p_ packs)** it can wire an _unlimited number of batteries_ together! Flex-wise: It's got more flex than a bamboo board!

**Modelled after an _armadillo shell_** I instantly thought of the _back protector_ I use for supersport motorcycling -- A 'Manis D1' back protector by Italian company _Dainese_. Dainese are world-class innovators with research backed by an Italian university and their gear is used by _Moto GP champions_ like _Casey Stoner_ and _Valentino Rossi_ on Team Ducati or Team Honda.

![Diagram___ Armadillo(500)|500x294](upload://fdEJajH9nOkzcJAXcQadhTkTGUq.jpg)
(Illustration: Armadillo!)

Unlike other enclosures that adopt a _one-piece_ turtle-shell-shaped design which is _thick_, _bulky_, and _heavy_, creatures like the _armadillo_, _centipede_, _millipede_, and _lobster_, have a _**'multiple-unit' shell / exoskeleton**_ that is _very light_ & _very strong_ able to protect internal organs whilst having the added advantage of being able to _**move with the creature**_. 

![Diagram-Dainese-Manis-D1-500|464x500](upload://owhoRnEw9T8iRjFH6RDzJmf2jcG.jpg)
(Illustration: Dainese Manis D1 back protector)

Each module links together using overlapping _tongue-in-groove_ joints **sealed with neoprene tape** (for insulation and dampening). _Neoprene_ is the material of choice for wetsuits used by divers, surfers, spear-fishermen, etc. It will keep water and debris out. Rubber, on the otherhand is a bit too hard and stiff for a flex deck. The combination of tongue in groove joints sandwiched with neoprene allows _freedom of movement_ on the _outside_ in the series of modules AND ALSO on the _inside_ as **each 2s4p cell (and its wiring connections e.g. silicone wire, or copper braid) move freely _with_ the board** not against it.

This system is the antithesis of the typical **long and rigid _one-piece_ enclosures** not designed to bend repeatedly. Such enclosures incur **stress at the joints** and are prone to cracking as the board flexes. -- Think of all those _**bumps in the road**_, **_jumps_**, **_landings_**, _**cracks in the pavement**_, _**popping up curbs**_, _**jumping off curbs and stairs**_, _**power slides**_..., **_pumping_** and **_carving_**... etc...  And with an ESK8, you're navigating unchartered territory by travelling far faster and far further than any traditional skateboard has ever travelled.

Before designing this I had already noticed _critical design flaws_ in other enclosures that developed cracks due to poor design and poor material choice, even the bigger names -- I won't name names. But the if you look closely, there is obviously limited / inadequate flexibility on a flexible deck (Stiff decks have the same problem). Over _time_, and _distance travelled_, stress inevitably builds up and cracks form, compromising all the electrics. By then, you'd need a new enclosure, and possibly new electrics. At the very least you'd need to do repairs.

But a design that allows _maximum flex_ prevents cracks from forming in the first place, ensuring full protection of your electrics from:

* Intrusion by external debris like _water_, _dust_, _dirt_, _snow_, _mud_, etc
* Battery pack damage from cracks in cells / solder joints / tack welds / etc 
* Risk of short circuit from cracked / loose / disconnected wires / nickel strips / copper braid
* Touching in general: As VESC / FOCBOX / ESCape are physically insulated!

This is the ideal solution for those looking for:

* _Maximum flexibility_
* _Durability_
* _Longevity_
* _Strength_
* _Reliability_
* _Scalability_
* _Replaceability_

It will last much _much_ longer than other enclosures AND it's _scalable_ ready for upgrading / upsizing the battery! And when you've board-slided or grinded on that rail, gutter, or bench once too many, just replace the module (not the whole enclosure).

**As a one-size for all system**, your board can be made extra-short, short, medium, long, or extra-long, all using one system. You can interchange between boards, upscaling or downscaling.

**Battery pack:** You'll need a _custom made battery pack_ with wires linking each individual 2s4p pack inside each module (~1" / 25mm of wire per connection). It's a _very easy solder job_, easily done in one day. In other words, the enclosure won't readily suit any pre-made battery packs without modification. It must be custom made, OR you can cut up a pre-made battery pack into smaller 2s4p packs and re-connect them together! 

If this sounds too overwhelming: PM me for custom made battery packs.

**Wiring:** Each wire that connects each 2s4p pack must be routed, either:
1) _Through the enclosure_ via. a hole with a grommet (see _rubber grommet_ on the Blue Kevlar Carbon).
2) _Under the enclosure (_in_ deck)_ by routing or chiselling a strip of material from the deck. About 2-5mm, which will hardly affect structural integrity of the deck.
3) _Under the enclosure (_above_ deck)_ by having a thicker 5mm neoprene gasket, allowing wires to sandwich between the deck and the enclosure.

**_Method 1_** is fine, but the exposed wires means there is some risk of wires snagging objects whilst riding, Also means more cleaning after each ride (e.g. using a toothbrush). 

_**Method 2 & 3**_ is the safest and sleekest option. Hidden wires means full protection and less cleaning. :+1:

Fibreglass reinforced.
**Weight:** ~33g / 1.16 oz.
Theoretically, Kevlar can absorb a puncture impact better than carbon, which would shatter. It also has abrasion resistance while carbon would disintegrate a bit quicker.  
Super light, very hard and strong. It has some twist and flex too if you man-handle the module.

![70|690x388](upload://dhdMUNLTwh1zhnWTn3jidwkPtmH.jpg)

Fibreglass reinforced.
**Weight:** ~35g / 1.23 oz. 
Super light, very stiff, hard, and strong, with some twist. 

**Fibreglass reinforcement:** Provides a stronger structure and electrical insulation (especially against carbon which is highly conductive).

**Specifications / Dimensions**:

* External dimensions of module (overall):  190 x 125mm (7.5 x 5")
* Internal dimensions: 120 x 85mm (4.72 x 3.35")
* Measurement of tongue overlap (as pictured): ~20mm (0.8")
* Weight: ~35g per module

**Installation & ideal flex:** Overlap amount is down to personal preference. The standard overlap is already over-engineered and will exceed most peoples' expectations.

**Total length with a standard 20mm tongue overlap:**

* 2 modules = 220mm (8.7")
* 3 modules = 320mm (12.6")
* 4 modules = 420mm (16.5")
* 5 modules = 520mm (20.5")
* 6 modules = 620mm (24.4")
* 7 modules = 720mm (28.3")
* 8 modules = 820mm (32.3") --- Fits most longboards.
* 9 modules = 920mm (36.2")

[Math break down: For 2 connected modules: [ (120mm x 2) - (**20**mm x 1) ] = 220mm. For 4 connected modules: [ (120mm x 4) - (20mm x 3) ] = 420mm. Etc, etc.]

**For _closer_ fits:** Up to 20mm per tongue (and groove) can be trimmed off for a super close and snug fit. It will still work, but I'd recommend cutting off no more than 15mm, for at least a 5mm tongue to remain. You also can do this yourself (not hard) with a hack saw, and clean it up with sandpaper, but it won't be as nicely finished.]

**For _wider_ fits and more flex (than pictured)**: Space modules further apart for a ~5mm (0.2") overlap. 2 modules connected equals 375mm long (14.8"). 

**Total length with 5mm tongue overlap:**  -- About 11% shorter
* 4 modules = 375mm (14.76")
* 5 modules = 460mm (18.11")
* 6 modules = 545mm (21.46")
* 7 modules = 630mm (24.8")
* 8 modules = 715mm (28.15)

[Math break down: For 2 connected modules:  [ (120mm x 2) - (**35mm** x 1) ] = 205mm. For 4 connected modules: [ (120mm x 2) - (35mm x 1) ]  = 375mm. Etc, etc.]

[For a 0mm overlap, for theory's sake. For 2 connected modules [ (120mm x 2) - (**40mm** x 1) ] = 200mm. For 4 connected modules: [ (120mm x 4) - (**40mm** x 3) ] = 360mm.

**Made in Australia:** Each part is made with love and care. Full attention to detail with no expense spared. They're not mass produced in slave labour / sweat shop conditions in China, India, South America, or any 3rd world country. Not that there's anything wrong with that, apart from... _health & safety_ issues, _hygiene & sanitation_ issues, _class inequality_ issues, _child and female exploitation_ issues (think of your mum, sisters, and aunts!), human trafficking and slave camps... (Think of your dad, brothers, and uncles!) They're also not made in underdeveloped and impoverished parts of Europe like Poland, Eastern Europe, or from gulags in Soviet Russia, or in any illegal or unethical manner. Everything is done above board. 

**About price:** This allows me to produce a sweet product for your enjoyment. This way I'm happy, you're happy. It _fully_ covers all the _material costs_, _labour, and production time (at the _minimum Australian award rate_)_, also the plethora of immeasurable small inputs, the overall complexity, difficulty, and fuss. 

**About quality: _These are quality specialty parts. You get what you pay for._** Each order is fastidiously _quality checked_ before shipping, _cleaned_,  _sanitised_, _wrapped_ and _packaged_ securely in the best packaging available, ... ready for a long and safe journey by plane to your door... :slightly_smiling_face:

**10s4p Example:** A 10s4p 18650 li-ion battery pack needs _5 modules_ to house the battery (i.e. 5 x 2s4p = 10s4p), _plus_ an additional module to house the VESCs / FOCBoxes. A total of 6 modules.

**12s4p Example:** A 12s4p 18650 li-ion battery pack needs _6 modules_ to house the battery (i.e. 6 x 2s4p = 12s4p), _plus_ an additional module to house to house the VESCs / FOCBoxes. A total of 7 modules.

It looks nice and we're starting to see this type of modular enclosure on the fringes of the esk8 product world - taboo, thingiverse etc. 

Personally I like what'syou come up with. We've already seen some designs that can accomodate flex being sold for Trampa mostly.

We're talking about 12s4p as a baseline as this is not a low end gear you would predominitely see any interest from the 50v club,so you need a 7th segment in reality...

I understand your pricing explaination,but this is the cost
![image|662x272](upload://gqOqxo1KYBECfwd7mvgU656v0mb.png)

Around the same as the cost of the introductory price offering of La Croix - maple/carbon deck with flexible enclosure included taking 60+cells

That is what you are up against in terms of price Vs expectations

Good luck

With that price i can make vacuumed cf enclosure myself + some cash to burn.

I mean trampa flex cf enclosure is like $200-300

I guess that thing u make will last forever, but nobody ask for last forever enclosure.

But I think someone will probably buy some, as I've seen some ridiculous prices being sold here.

[/quote]

If you look at it from the other perspective, if all enclosures were initially built this way (and battery packs made accordingly), then there would be less concern about cracking and damaged enclosures and risk of damaging the internal electrics. So, I do believe this is an idyllic solution to a rigid inflexible enclosure on a deck that _flexes_, _twists_, and _vibrates_, as all do. This modular enclosure will cover all those bases: _Flex_, _twist_, _vibration_, and _impact_. 

Also, in the event you crack a module, for whatever reason, it can be swapped out and replaced.:+1:


[quote="Burrito, post:5, topic:57121, full:true"]

I offer non-premium _one-piece enclosure_ (See, http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/wanted-10s4p-enclosure-australia/45800)

It's **AU $45 in fibreglass**, or whatever material and finish. 
It **double stacks 2 x 10s4p**. :slightly_smiling_face:



[quote="onepunchboard, post:7, topic:57121"]
...that thing u make will last forever...
[/quote]

**It will last _a long time_**, by nature of the design, not forever... Its structural integrity is less easily compromised. 

**Being modular, you can swap out damaged sections easily**, and the overlapping tongue-in-groove connection allows it to bend, twist, and take (some) impact without breaking. The neoprene seals help even more. Think of a train with many carriages absorbing all the vibrations vs. one long carriage that would snap in half on the first hard corner. Long vehicles don't work. For this reason, many cars have cracked door posts from all the turning and twisting they've done over the years.

**Think of it also as an _investment_ and _insurance_:** When one puts so much effort planning, time waiting for parts to arrive, and money into an esk8 built, who wants it to break while riding? So many builds have turned into a total loss, falling apart from the enclosure. The modular system will be a much better platform to build a precious esk8. It will protect your electrics and take quite the beating.

If the problem is negible cost in laying up a big piece of carbon as opposed to a small piece,then the problemis the mold.

Design the mold to produce enough segments for an entire 7 segments + or even more.

You have to halve this cost or it'sa fringe item

Produce multiple segments in one multi layup, then cut the segments out. The introductory offer is generous if this is the pricing model however it will not be a ubiquitous item


[quote="solideogloria, post:1, topic:57121"]
The downside to this design is the expensive price tag. The reason is that each 2s4p module requires about the same amount of time to produce as a single larger enclosure does

Why do you need an enclosure that is able to flex that much, it looks super nice btw
if you have a super flexy deck it wont flex more than 20% maybe and then you you will be scraping the floor
Also the price is just way too high IMO

Personally i wouldn´t spend more than 100€ for a 10s4p enclosure for a standard board.
If it´s really nice and everything for a Trampa Urban Carver a 12s4p, i would go up for up to 200€.
I wouldn´t spend more.

Thank you for your kind complements. I appreciated your constructive posts. 

**The Modular Flex Enclosure** is unique as far as I'm aware. It addresses the fundamental structural problems, design problems, and weaknesses aforementioned. 

Materials like fibreglass / carbon are not designed for repeated flex, and stress. That's why I've offered the Blue Kevlar Carbon. **One-piece enclosures crack under flex and stress.** Look closely and you'll see.

Items like **silicone coated wires** _are_, however, designed to flex. Logically, this enclosure system would complement them, following in the same line of thought: _Flexibility_.

The modules are like **'multiple unit' trains**, like the new Waratah train used here in Sydney. They suit our rough landscape and random town planning, because this city was improperly planned... 

![Diagram___ Waratah Train|359x140](upload://nsOFblqVXnui7OVpYoPE3ZWM1JM.jpeg)

ESK8s decks and enclosures suffer similar environments, relatively, that's why skateboard builders prefer _Maple_ for strength, and later came _Bamboo_, for both flex and the steel-like strength. -- Cheap boards can snap!

This design started life on the drawing board so it's understandably a bit strange and unconventional, but that doesn't mean it's dysfunctional. -- There's been a trend in enclosure design and pricing and I obviously differ on both. From what I can tell, the earliest enclosures were _built out of necessity_ when none were available. One-pieces enclosures became the norm. Designs seem to have followed one another, until now.

One of the features I haven't yet highlighted is how **SLIM & COMFORTABLE** the enclosures are to touch and hold. -- If you've walked around with an ESK8 deck, you'd immediately realise how impossibly uncomfortable an enclosure is the moment you pick it up. It's nothing like a traditional skateboard or longboard as it's all bulgy and awkwardly designed. It rubs against your wrist all wrong and the thick parts bulge out against your body making you walk funny, and the weight is lopsided and unevenly distributed so you have to hold it weird angles. 

The **separate modules pragmatically space out the weight**, so the board's less like a see-saw, which will help with _ridability_, _transitions_, _switches_, _slides_, etc. 

Also, the **rounded edges on the slim enclosures** make it and so smooth and comfortable to hold. No angles, means, no hard edges poking into you. :+1:

As for cell count... Well... 'Bigger does _not_ mean better'.

However, as an **expandable enclosure system** you can add as many cells / modules as you want. You can also reduce cells / modules.

For example, cell & enclosure size reduction would be relevant to a 12s4p rider who may find that 12s4p is overkill (too heavy, and dangerously powerful) instead preferring a 10s4p, or 8s4p, which is LIGHTER for shorter rides with less hill climbs... maybe for commuting, or for travelling on mostly flats. 

Or you can have both setups, on separate boards. Have a long 12s4p board (7 modules) AND have a short 8s4p board (5 modules), all done using the same enclosure system. You could even save money by interchanging the enclosures instead of buying a new set.

i.e. AU $301.85 will afford you 7 modules, allowing you to have up to 3 boards, effectively, using one enclosure system... 

E.g. With 7 modules you could have a 'Big' 12s4p board using all 7 modules, AND a 'Short' 8s4p board using 5 enclosures, AND a 'Medium' 10s4p board. Buying all 3 sets would otherwise cost $785.60 ($301.85 + 261.89 + 221.86). OR, Buying 2 sets would cost $563.74 ($301.85 + 261.89. So, with **$301.85 / 3 = $100.61 per board, allowing you the flexibility to have 3 boards**.

Which is good since one can only ride one board at a time! :+1:

**Protection against failure:** A critical advantage to having a series of separate modules is **BATTERY INSULATION & PROTECTION**. As each 2s4p is individually housed in effectively a fireproof container... Well, it's very very safe. For instance, if and when a cell is damaged, the short circuit / heat / fire / explosion _will not_ spill over instantly to neighbouring cells! ... Any explosion would be contained... The physical separation insulates and protects. (See oct0f1sh, http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/some-fun-video-of-my-longboard-exploding/26120)

![Diagram___ Fire Damage (oct0f1sh) 5|666x500](upload://h6o6Ljt8wsJIkKhQOzAGLE5s2pb.jpg)

Also, **protection against water damage:** When water enters an enclosure, it will move about as you ride, swishing around... Water is... well... _fluid._ (See, http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/i-got-my-battery-wet-damage-control-options/49212/20)

**Think of it as insurance** against having to replace your entire battery (AND have it rebuilt again from scratch). If anything happens, you'll be covered. You'll only have to replace a 2s4p, and maybe one module. That sounds like a major cost _saving_!:+1:

That's a broad assumption though... You'd need examples to demonstrate. -- I have examples that I could share on the weakness of one-piece carbon enclosures (at flexible joints), but as mentioned above, _I won't name names_. All I'll say is this: **Look closely at the stress points and you'll see cracks**, in all the enclosures out there. 

[quote="Hummie, post:25, topic:57121"]

[/quote]

Carbon has very little flex. When bent it breaks. Because it's rigid it snaps like a cracker. -- Carbon is essentially a sheet of diamond, and diamond shatters like glass.

Even steel snaps if you bend it too many times. And boards bend _a lot_ in their life time, absorbing so many road vibrations. -- Maybe I could demonstrate by snapping some carbon samples.

Carbon isn't the most popular material for laminating between the wood layers in side boards. It's way too stiff (making the ride hard and uncomfortable), and it won't last as long as _fibreglass_.

The carbon on your Maple & carbon decks are just veneers right? While the sandwiched laminated layers are fibreglass, right? The majority of decks are made that way.

While the carbon veneer might snap, it's protected by being safely glued to the fibreglass and Maple, holding it all together. 

_Enclosures_, on the other hand,_ kind of just hang there_, floating around underneath, pinned down by a few bolts. It's not bonded to the deck every millimetre of the way.

Thus, the _ability to bend_ isn't as important as _tolerance to bending_. For example, I _can_ bend my feet to run, but I _cannot_ continuously bend them to run a full 10kms. Firstly, I'm a sprinter and terrible long-distance runner, but _my joints soon get sore_ if I don't rest. If I pushed myself I'd definitely pull a muscle. But a _tougher _professional runner would have no problem.

(Actually, riding stiff boards is really hard  on your joints... it leads to cartilage damage as your knees absorb the stress that your board could instead be absorbing for you... Anyway, I digress.)

**Therefore, _toughness_ and _ability to flex_ is key!**

See section on 'toughness' and 'ability to flex' below:

![Toughness___ Carbon vs Fibre|488x499](upload://5t98Dn4IpykjHcO5Y39NlrGSzu4.png)

For this reason, the **Solideogloria enclosures come reinforced with fibreglass.** They're _tougher_ by material, and _tougher_ by design. -- Plus, since the tongue in groove joints _'float'_, between layers of neoprene, they don't incur any stress at all...  making its _ability to flex_ appear unmatched at this point. :face_with_monocle:

the carbon in and on the deck I've been selling is real carbon and not a façade.  its shown to be good though and been riding it for a long time without any delaminating and feels good
the more I read about carbon vs e-glass or s-glass it seems carbon is mainly used for looks.  Really for toughness from hits on the bottom of the deck it makes sense to use all fiberglass in my mind.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7bQYEt_qtU

but I wonder what the goal of an enclosure really is as unless it's reaaaaaly stiff its only going to be good for ricocheting rocks maybe but a true load on it will make it flex and collapse and whats underneath will be crushed.  I'm not picking on you though and everyone likes an enclosure.   how stiff are those blocks?  can you show a test?  Ideal I think would be as you intended it and very stiff blocks and then flexibility between the blocks.   but even if the block is stiff, ..how stiff and would it be so stiff as to not collapse enough to transfer force to the cells inside if the board bottomed-out on a ramp or speed bump?  I think it would need to be very much more overbuilt for that to be possible, but since its for 18650 that are steel and very stiff maybe the forces transferred to the cells isn't a worry and might as well forget trying to be stiff and just make it tough so that when you do bottom-out, and the cells do take a beating, the enclosure doesn't shatter.   seems like fiberglass is a better bet all round and way cheaper.  you could do decoupage and put a sweet image on it!
but maybe i'm wrong and carbon is worth it

I guess that's why BMW use Titanium mesh carbon-fiber, to increase flexibility but still light weight. I agree tho Fiber glass is usually the stronger one, and pure carbon fiber is brittle. 

But I'm not sure the if we can break the carbon fiber while riding anyways, unless we intentionally crash it.

Thank you for your recognition @Hummie and @onepunchboard.

Yes, for the pro-fibreglass reasons, I've promoted the fibreglass. Although understated it's quite an attractive finish that you don't commonly see. I really like both the clear, white, and black fibre vermicelli finishes.

White and black vermicelli can be made with less pigment for a more translucent / opaque finish. Say, at 50% opacity, making it clearer. It think it's a nice way to show off the electrics too, like a glass window underneath a Swiss watch.

The **Solideogloria One-piece Enclosure** (offered to Australians) has significant discounts for fibreglass. IF the EU / US are interested, I could offer a similar discount.

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/wanted-10s4p-enclosure-australia/45800/14

The title of the KYLE.ENGINEERS video,

[quote="Hummie, post:27, topic:57121"]
**"Why you SHOULDN'T wrap Fibreglass in Carbon"**
[/quote]

is a bit misleading though...

Yes, you're quite right, **carbon is pretty veneer**, very practical (strong, stiff, tough, somewhat flexible, etc), but it functions mainly as a pretty veneer on decks. It is, however, less aesthetic and more structure on enclosures (and lids too), where it's stiffness is beneficial. That's why you see carbon fibre car bonnets, spoilers, etc, which are topical. But on supersport motorcycles, which are usually covered in _plastic fairings_ (valued for it's flexibility), it's very rare to see carbon. Carbon is just too rigid for a motorcycle that wiggles and wobbles through a race track. -- So carbon is a bit like icing on the cake. A hard brittle icing, _with flex_, yet still a hard.

I made a motor mount out of thick layers of carbon with reinforcements, yet all the vibrations for the motor, from speeding and braking, constantly hitting ON and OFF the accelerator, tore the mount apart. Heat from the motor didn't help. The lesson learnt is that solid pieces of carbon, whether _one-piece enclosures_, or _carbon panels_, 'are not designed to flex'.

**In the Solideogloria enclosures, fibreglass does most of the heavy lifting.** Hence, they are, and I quote, "fibreglass _reinforced_". 

The video's theory, while true, is actually a bit misleading / inaccurate _in practice_…

How so? 

Well, the video uses the example a _flat object_ (a sandwich of layers, or a 'flat panel'), while the modules are a _shaped object_ (a box shaped with edge flaps, rounded edges, a tongue and groove, etc). This makes a big difference engineering-wise.

**Firstly, the _torsional strength_ of the each module is massive**. Look up 'torsion box' and you'll see why. Basically, a box-shaped object, like kitchen cabinets, or hanging wall cabinets, etc, are very very strong and can hold massive amounts of weight before breaking. Just think of all the stuff in your mum's pantry… They only become weak when the boxes are made too big that lose their torsional strength. -- That is, **in one-piece enclosures (longer than ~30cm / 12") there's a large weak patch at the centre**. If you poke your finger on it, it will indent. If you stick a stick into it, it may even burst. -- That is why bigger kitchen cabinets are made up of multiple smaller internal cabinets, stuck and screwed together. But they must be side-by-side and stuck together in order to be strong. 

![Diagram___ Torsion Box Traditional|558x405](upload://zm0DdW71qcjD3NQdVpjoPhs8U0A.png)

![Diagram___ Torsion Box Strength Demo|601x404](upload://oz8vA4BOgcmcqeMjL8qNeNVQtJs.jpg)

On that note, **the small proportions of 2s4p-sized Solideogloria modules virtually have no 'weak-point'** compared to one-piece enclosures. -- Maybe  I could whack some with a hammer to demonstrate.

**Secondly, the _tensile strength_ is massive**. That is, the amount of force it takes to tear it apart, whether carbon or fibre. Both are strong enough.

See the 'Tensile Strength' and 'Tensile Strain' figures:

![Chart___ Tensile Strain of Carbon|690x465](upload://iRVlbmlqLiLsFG5xNoWdGffFStw.png)

Carbon has 49% the tensile strain of fibre (i.e. 0.85/1.75 = 0.49). In other words, carbon has 51% less tensile strain. Meaning that it cracks at the joints twice as easily.

So, you don't need to worry too much about the 'box' part of the design, or the superficial carbon layer (although not always ideal), but rather you need to focus on the weakness of the joints.

As per OP, and I quote, **"it's the _joints_ that incur the most stress." This is where the tongue in groove joints shine** (See _multiple-unit_ like trains and extended buses vs. single-unit vehicles like the dangerously long Concord plane that is no longer safe enough to used by airlines).

Thirdly, having a superficial carbon veneer is not as 'superficial' as it sounds but is actually very practical as the material does take a good beating, whether it gravel, rocks, gutters, or board sliding on rails… 

**The weakness in carbon is when it _doesn't complement_ the materials it's bonded to**, like fibre, wood, or whatever. So, again, in this application, the weakness of carbon would be _at the joints that incur stress_, less so in the compatible / incompatible bonding with fibre / wood. -- In an ideal design, I'd have a carbon cap on the surface of the box (like a lid / dental cap), and have the tongues / flaps made of fibre. But it'd take too much effort to make.

![Sketch___ Carbon Cap|690x388](upload://fc5ikuHSvEmBXelHYbmnifTNmq9.jpg)

(See motorcycle gloves covered in carbon armour: 99% use carbon on the knuckles, palm, and ulna part of the wrist, **to absorb crash impact** into barricades, etc, while everything else is flexible leather -- Because fingers need to FLEX COMFORTABLY.)

E.g.

[/quote] 

_The goal?_ Isn't that obvious? :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

Well, it's just been addressed above (re. flex and weak joints that will crack), but I mean, with this enclosure, if you really wanted to, it's strong enough to board-slide on rails… and if you pop a curb and get stuck, or bottom out, you needn't to worry. 

Some Sydney suburbs have rounded concrete curbs  (S-shaped ramps), maybe similar to places in Texas / Nevada / Vegas / nicer suburbs of California like Beverly Hills. So when you pop a curb to ride up a driveway, or onto a foot path, you'd be very likely to bottom out and graze 3mm (1/8") off the enclosure. Do that a few times and you'll have nothing left but a battery pack to grind... ... ... :sweat: 

(See above for accrobrandon's water damage and oct0f1sh's fire damage and short-circuit)

Likewise, on the East Coast in places like New York and Washington state it'd be even more critical with rough concrete slabs everywhere _plus_ rain, snow, and puddles of water all the time...

But above all, **a strong enclosure is an insurance policy to protect your electrics!** The electrics, by far, are the most expensive and precious ingredients in an ESK8. Why would one buy high-quality 18650 cells made to last 5-10 years and an expensive VESC / FOCBOX to risk it all with a compromisable enclosure that cracks? -- A strong foundation is the principle. ‘Build your house on solid rock, not sinking sand.’ (Jesus Christ, Matthew 7:27)

Nope. Nickel strip wouldn't be ideal. -- Nickel hardly tolerates stress.

**_Silicone wires_, however, _are_ designed to flex**. They're soft, thick, and ultra pliable.

See rubber grommet hole on the Blue Kevlar Carbon. You could route the wires through the side of the modules via. the grommets, or underneath the modules.

o I see there's the holes for wires.

I'm still not convinced you could make it  a one-piece design that would be just as strong and flexible though.   and I think you could still lay it up with the carbon "cap" if you really wanted, but Im not convinced the carbon is worth putting on after the fiberglass after watching the video above.  yes shape will have a big effect but regardless of shape the material properties still stand and youd be putting the carbon reinforced by fiberglass.  

in a way it makes more sense at least to have the carbon on the inside since it's best feature is its stiffness in tension and with a hit from underneath that way it would be more in tension and not compression

but just feeling it out and you have your ideas how you want to do it....just bouncing ideas off you based on what I've read.  And if you wanted to sell more the price is the big killer and I bet you could get it way down with the one-piece design skipping carbon

Horses for courses. Each design to its own.

**I _could_ offer _both designs in future_ with enough demand.**

But yes, you're quite right that a skilled lay up / vacuum process is beneficial, but only to a certain extent though (weight saving, having less amounts of brittle epoxy). A strong design does the rest.

To revisit the material-choice debate /  carbon-vs-fibre debate. Again, the video is a bit misleading as **_the material_ is less important than design in this application.** The 1.4% elongation of carbon vs 4.8% elongation of fibre, is an ever so _tiny difference, just 3.4%_ (4.8-1.4=3.4%). But the video's hand-drawn chart exaggerates the lines for illustration purpose... making fibre look like it has a 45% gradient, and carbon terrible at about a 15% gradient....

![8% fibre|690x431](upload://7XzXtKsU8kkqw4s6HStbQrnQWd5.jpg)

A more accurate graph would show how very very close the two materials in fact are.

Like these,

Fibre is very close to carbon, and superior in several ways, but it's choice as a material is mainly cost driven.

I meant maybe you could lay it up with the thicker glass on the box with maybe heavy triaxial weave and then underneath the boxes and going between would be some thinner stuff that allowed it to flex at the joints.    Or even just stack a couple layers deep on the boxes and thin it at the joints.  but with the joints being flat I doubt youd even need to and they would flex enough regardless
but you do you, just think you could sell a lot more if it were cheaper and you could do it

@Schulerbible Thanks for chiming in.

 **Sealer:** Neoprene tape, 3-5mm thick, 10-15mm wide. -- 3mm thick allows the low profile and flex (as per photos), but if you wanted more height (for more electrical stuff, like bigger cells, more wires, etc) and more flex at the joints, 5-10mm would do that.

![Diagram___ 3mm Neoprene Tape|690x406](upload://pQQQ3srNxOUO7DEPijrbUvUkevD.png)

**Fixture:** 306 stainless bolts with plastic washers. Most bolts will do fine as long as there's enough thread. M4-M5 would be fine. M6 would overkill. -- Threaded inserts screwed / epoxied into the deck would be ideal, but not necessary.

All of these would work. Lots to choose from!

**Loaded Vanguard:** This deck has a slight concave, so the side flaps of the modules would need _a very slight bending_ inwards, on a warm skillet pan or BBQ hot plate (as carbon / fiber is pliable with heat).

Hey dude, it looks like you have put a lot of work in to your product. It looks great, albeit over priced and I buy heaps of exy shit.
As you are not a "Regular" you can not use the forum to do a "Pre Order"-"Group Buy" or any other sale by any name that involves you collecting money from members prior to production. I'd suggest you read up on the forum rules and edit your topic before @Namasaki or @treenutter drop bye and sort it out for you.

Good luck with your product development!
I have moved your topic for you to the correct category for your user level :smiley:

***the material* is less important than design in this application.** The 1.4% elongation of carbon vs 4.8% elongation of fibre, is an ever so *tiny difference, just 3.4%* (4.8-1.4=3.4%). But the video’s hand-drawn chart exaggerates the lines for illustration purpose… making fibre look like it has a 45% gradient, and carbon terrible at about a 15% gradient…
[/quote]
design is more so the deciding factor i agree but if youre using the same design, which you would be, and its a 4.8% to 1.4% different that's not tiny but over 3x as much no?
but i bet if you added some slight ribs to the boxes' top youd add a ton of stiffness and as you say the design is most influential on stiffness.

Perhaps I'm missing something, but for a 12s4p 7 enclosure unit, I have to somehow fit between 1330-1210 mm (depending on overlap) beneath a deck?  One would need a board like 5ft long, lol.  Also, I noticed to talk of the prices and then being reduced, but from what I see, the price for a 7 piece enclosure is unchanged from the earlier prices and the reduced ones, in USD at least, remaining $208.61...

Thanks for pointing that out @uigiroux. Merci beacoup. Ca va? Etes vous Francais?

[OP edited - re. updated new price and measurements of connected modules.]

Small, math error. My mistake.

**Typo:** [(**190mm** x 2) - 20mm] = 220mm.

**Correction:** [(**120mm** x 2) - 20mm] = 220mm. 

**Total length of enclosure using a 20mm tongue overlap:**
4 modules = 420mm (16.5")
5 modules = 520mm (20.5")
6 modules = 620mm (24.4")
7 modules = 720mm (28.3")
8 modules = 820mm (32.3")

[**N.b. If you want them closer, I can cut off up to ~20mm per tongue** (and groove) for a super close fit. It will still work, but I'd recommend cutting off no more than ~15mm, for **at least a ~5mm tongue to remain.**]

@Hummie A **1.4% elongation means '101.4%' (_one hundred_ and one point four percent)**, and likewise, 1.4% means 104.8%. Meaning that the material stretches to 100% (standard resting rate) and then stretches a bit more until 101.4% or 104.8% (before snapping). -- N.b. elongation is not so relevant as the enclosures will not get 'stretched' apart... But anyway... I could be mistaken, and a structural engineer could clarify...

Or, in other words, I can 101.4m until failure. You can run 104.8m until failure.

So, _no_. It is not '3 times' the difference, not at all. **It's more like a 3% difference.** -- As I said, his graph is misleading because the lines _appear 3x different_, while the math is very very far from that. After all it's an educational video explaining basic theory. 

But theory requires application... And in this application, **the tongues do not stretch on the Solideogloria Modular Flex Enclosure** unlike, on a one-piece enclosure, where the connections (consisting of multiple laminations) are forced to bend and snap (exactly as per KYLE.ENGINEERS video). The Solideogloria tongues will 'float' without suffering any strain.

**Karate chop comparison:**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbSNiKXBxOE

See Line 'FC2' vs 'FC3' on the chart as a rough illustration. I hope that illustrates how small a difference it is. But, yes, you're quite right that fibre has superior properties re. elongation, but as mentioned, it's a very small if not negligibly small of a difference in this application.

But when laminated and bent... That's another story..

**Wood comparison:** Let's take a look at wood bending. Below are the two main methods. Focus on the 'outer tension' part to visualise how **a one-piece enclosure (with multiple laminated layers) WILL CRACK, when the outer layer is too brittle.** Imagine if it was a panel of glass, while the inside is flexible fibreglass. 

![Diagram___%20Steambending%20Plywood%20(Full)|247x500](upload://d7LsqXIW4oSpHJMzw2yYfXkEANp.jpg)

![Ikea%20Poang%20Armchair|387x385](upload://v5KgmV7fq0hJCudxDLU4PhH2Yln.jpg)

**Therefore, it _is_ possible for a carbon outer layer to withstand flex, given proper construction** (light and not loaded with resin), but even then it's not ideal. If it's to be a one-piece enclosure, it's better to be 100% carbon. But that would be quite expensive. **However, as we know fibre performs better, and is cheaper, it's better to have 100% fibre.** -- **The Solideogloria enclosures is free of this problem, so it's of no real consequence. We can use either material, or both materials together!** 

[quote="Hummie, post:49, topic:57121"]
...if you added some slight ribs to the boxes’ top youd add a ton of stiffness...
[/quote]

Are you pulling my leg? :wink:

No, no, you misunderstand. The point is that **the Solideogloria system is plenty strong, far stronger than a one-piece enclosure, due to the design having small 2s4p box modules**, unlike a long elongated bog box in a one-piece with a large weak patch in the centre (about the size of a small dinner plate, or 2).

I suggest you review the 'Torsion Box' above and study it carefully. -- The multiple smaller boxes within the large frame is what gives a large table, or kitchen cabinets, house floors, house walls, bridge floors, etc, so much strength... They are really really really strong...

_'A threefold cord is not quickly broken.'_ (Ecclesiastes 4:12)

Imagine thumping your fist upon a large moving box (for moving house etc), compared to small shoe box, or an even smaller box. The large box will collapse instantly on the first 1 or 2 thumps while the small would hold up much much longer. 

Yes... of course... **I _could_ add ridges, but it would be _overkill._** Plus, the added detail makes it more annoying (and expensive) to produce. -- I've already got a design for this, btw. Trust me it's overkill. Not unless you're Tony Hawke and you intend to thrash this enclosure in a professional way, like doing crazy stunts on Red Bull commercials... jumping off 1m+ drops and board-sliding on boulders... or are expecting your worst enemy to kick your enclosure with their steel-capped Timberlands... then.... it's overkill... PM me if you're really interested and I'll make one with ridges for you. :slightly_smiling_face:

Imagine if it was a panel of glass, while the inside is flexible fiberglass."   
imagine if it was less flexible carbon on the outside and I think it is similar.

I'm really not meaning to rip on your product and I like it a lot  but just interested in the two material structure strength and think a lot of people think carbon is stronger while it ends up being weaker.  looks good though.    and you do both versions anyway.  but maybe i'm wrong and carbon on the outside of glass is good but from what I read it seems not ideal design.  

here's some bits I read.  but I'm no engineer and just shooting the shit and you do do the fiberglass version anyway so I hope you don't take this as criticism of your product but maybe the carbon outside version isn't as strong as just plain, cheaper, fiberglass.   I'm surprised to find this myself.  


"Material Young's Modulus 
E Glass 30-40 
Carbon Fiber 125-181 
Kevlar®  70.5-112.4 
Epoxy 3 

The stiffness of Carbon Fiber, Kevlar® and Glass very different. Carbon Fiber is by far the stiffer of the composite materials.

The actual figures presented here are for comparison only. The important thing to take away is that Carbon Fiber is about twice as stiff as Kevlar, and about 5 times stiffer than glass."


"There are many types of Kevlar, glass, and carbon fiber and they all differ. The exact figures here are almost meaningless what is important is the relative stiffness.

The down side of the exceptional stiffness of carbon fiber is the fact that it tends to be more brittle. When it fails it tends to fail without showing much strain or deformation. One speaks of catastrophic failure."



"Fibreglass however being more flexible, it means that glass-fiber typically has a higher ultimate breaking point than a similarly shaped carbon fiber product, therefore having higher strength-to-weight ratio. In general it is a “tougher” material. The incredible rigidity of carbon makes it less capable of enduring certain abuses than fiberglass. I guess therefore you could say CF “more brittle”"























 

"High strength-to-weight ratio

Also known as specific strength, this number allows you to compare materials of different mass  for applications where resistance against breaking has priority. Being more flexible, it means that glassfiber typically has a higher ultimate breaking point than a similarly shaped carbon fiber product."

@Hummie Very good.

Except _stiffness_ practically has no relevance to a flex enclosure in terms of the flex discussion. _It does_ however keep the 'box' part of the discussion nice and hard, stiff, rigid, tense, strong, structured, etc, and "indestructible" as some have commented, making it quite unbreakable, thus preventing external objects from crushing the enclosure and damaging your electrics. 

P.S. Some of my more reinforced prototypes are 'stiffer' and I would argue stronger than some shin pads I have owned, stuff that would take a sliding tackle at full running speed. I could make these thicker ones the norm, if people are more interested in this rather than thinness and lightness. I mean, at 33g or 35g, either one is very light as it is, so you may have a point having emphatic concerns for stiffness. **Sufficient fibreglass reinforcement is the answer.**

[quote="Hummie, post:54, topic:57121"]

[/quote]

Yes, agreed (if you read carefully...). However, that is a broad statement you've made "carbon is not as strong as fibreglass".

Horses for courses. 

The Sydney Harbour Bridge is built out of combination of _steel_ painted in _grey paint_. The paint is flexible but it can also crack and flake off, which it does (if you ever walk on it you see repaired paint everywhere). So you could say paint is no good, and that would be fair enough. The underlying steel has great 'flex' and 'strength' but the paint still cracks. But this is because the bridge is HUGE and takes all sorts of beatings like WIND, ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE, and the MILLIONS OF CARS and TRAINS that vibrate along it per year... But on something like a steel gate, the paint would hardly come off... 

... It all depends on the application... Horses for courses...

So, as a material choice, like fibre, steel works well. But as I've said, unless you're Tony Hawke, just relax... the enclosure will hold up "a very long time", longer than any others out there.

For the sake of argument, IF hypothetically, the harbour bridge were built out of 100% grey paint (without any steel), _it could be just as strong, arguably._ In reality, however, it would break after a few thousand cars rattled along on it. 

Given your expressions of interest in fibre and concerns re. stiffness / strength (_and_ flex too), my recommendation is to go with 100% fibreglass. You won't be disappointed.

White / black vermicelli would be nice. I can make them opaque too if you prefer a shade of grey in between... 

Later, I might make patterned fabric exteriors to bling them up. I think they'd look a treat!

[quote="Hummie, post:27, topic:57121"]
seems like fiberglass is a better bet all round and way cheaper. **you could do decoupage and put a sweet image on it!**
[/quote]

Yes agreed.

Send me a graphic and let's see if I can decoupage! Oh, so much potential!

**Samples laid!** :slight_smile: 

I've availed a selection of varied layers. There's **fibreglass**, **black carbon**, and **blue kevlar carbon** to give you a feel.

Note: It _won't be nearly as pretty_ as a finished enclosure ready for sale (trimmed, sanded repeatedly, clear-coated, and polished, etc). It also _won't be as strong_ without the boxed sides (see torsion box above) to give it structural rigidity that a box offers... However, _it will give you **an overall feel**_ of what a flat panel of the material is like; something for you to stress test! 

I'll slice these up in the next day or 2 -- Be patient though as the cure time is taking longer in Winter, due to the cold and, humidity from massive rain storms in Sydney in recent few weeks. Water is everywhere... :sneezing_face:

Sorry about the blurry phone photos...

**News:** I've been craving a _short board_ for a while now. Something to strap to my backpack into the city... on the bus... on the train... running to get a taxi... cruising through airports... crossing Hyde Park... and getting from the station / bus stop to the car park. 

If you own a longboard you'll know how awkward and unwieldy it is. Especially carrying it onto a crowded bus at peak hour is soo embarrassing, especially when people stare. When a bus is packed like sardines, the last thing my fellow commuter needs is a _longboard_ swinging beside their head as the bus starts and stops... A short travel board would be _such a luxury_!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Gg-r89rFFw

Ideally, it would fit inside those stainless luggage compartments. A strap to secure it on the stainless rails would be better, to prevent theft on a long bus ride.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVIq0ZTcuMs

Local Australian board builders, **Erskin Boarding** and I, are collaborating to possibly release a short run of short travel boards. 

A sleek _one-piece enclosure_ will house the electrics (_non-flex_ deck) in the same style as the Solideogloria Modular Flex model. 

It will have the best parts from the ESK8 forum (still working on this)... As an example though, most boards come with a CRAP REMOTE and I would like that to change. It must fit comfortably in an _adult_ hand and allow maximum _control_, trigger range, and comfort, nothing beats **the MasterCho remote**, @MasterCho. I've stacked on tarmac at 20-30kph landing _right on_ the remote and it's hardly scratched! My body was sore for months but the remote is fine. It's low tech simplicity at its best!

We'll probably release it here first on the ESK8 forum at a discounted price for about one month. After that it will be _a public offer_ sold on the website and local skate shops at an RRP around AU $2000 (USD 1500, GBP 1200, CAD 2000, EUR 1300).

I have a new Loaded Icarus that needs your blue kevlar carbon enclosure. :) PM sent

PS; brilliant work on selecting Erskin; count me in.  

One modest design recommendation: in addition to the standard battery, please consider offering a travel-safe < 160WH removeable battery that looks slick on its own as a standalone external charging battery (USB for phones, tablets, etc).

I think the first company that figures this out will sell all they can make for a while.  I, too, believe the key to success in travel boards is a minimalistic design of the highest quality, as you describe.

The Firefly's has nice tech conveniences and the OLED screen looks nice, but these type of remotes have functional disadvantages:

* **Limited action:** The thumb is a short finger and has limited action, while the index finder is much longer with has a lot more range. This greatly affects control from 0-100% throttle. This is where the GT2B and GT2B mods like the MasterCho remote excel. You can hold the throttle at 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, etc. Likewise with the brake.
* **Poor Replaceability:** Remotes break. You'll land on them, throw them around. Step on them. And you don't want to do that with a remote that takes hours to build with dozens of specially ordered parts. The GT2B is mass produced (in a good way) which is convenient for replacing parts. It's also tried and true, having been used by the hobby community and ESK8 community since early beginnings.
* **Un-ergonomic shape:** It's slim shape looks nice but in your hand it will feel like a chocolate bar. When you're riding near traffic, crossing roads, etc, you want your remote to be securely anchored in your hand so you can brake quickly (in emergencies) and accelerate rapidly at will. The MasterCho has several contours that you can anchor your hand on in various ways. You can ride for hours without getting tired. But a small remote will make your hand cramp. 

P.S. I categorically have 'small hands', actually classed as size 'small' in men's glove sizing. My hand is span is ~21.5cm from pinky to thumb tip. Most Australians and Westerners will have the same of larger hands.

To compensate for the OLED screen, I can integrate a _voltmeter_ or _colometer_ into the board itself, either on the surface of the deck (readable while riding - a luxurious convenience), or underneath facing the road (readable whenever you stop to look). There are also LCD screens that can display more info, but I'll have to look into them.

PNot agree with the last point. The remote is similar to the Boosted remote and feels very nice in your hands. I recon it’s one of the best remotes out there! I would love to have the photon remote in a nicer package.

That all depends on what you print in. If someone where to decide to mass produce the remote in a quality material then it shouldn’t be a problem. And even if it was a cheap material , as long as it’s the housing that breaks, it can be printed locally again. This would be a nine issue if someone where to mass produce it. It’s one of those situations where we actually **want** China to ripoff.

It’s not very slim actually. Comparing it to the remote it’s based on , the B.B. Remote V2, it’s thicker , and a Lanyard can satisfy the anchor issue. Printing or manufacturing is a stronger material should solve any problem if it comes to needing more weight inones hand. Also there’s a longer version of the remote already made. As well as a trigger version also 

I agree that the Firefly has its shortcomings (the lack of a Multipurpose button being one) but it arguably has a better  aesthetic  Then the G2b (cause let’s be real that remote is ugly as hell).  Rather than dismiss it , I think it would be more fruitful to look at it and see what can be improved , and contribute towards it full fruition. 

It amazes me that there’s so many open projects that vendors have the ability to produce for sale and yet very little accessorie projects are out there.

How funny. There may be a _taste_ / _age_ difference coming through here.:face_with_monocle:

Yes, the Firefly has many merits that are worth considering for sure. I should have emphasised that more. :slight_smile: 

In defence of the MasterCho GT2B remote (as a legacy forumite and pioneer, @MasterCho has earned much praise - the remote is a classic favourite). Design-wise, his remote actually anchors into your grip, within your hand. It's hard to explain, but it can be grabbed in the chubby middle part (where the battery is), or a bit higher. And your thumb can latch onto a ledge (which is what thumbs do, clutch objects - _Thumbed remotes sacrifice this_, if you hit an obstacle, be prepared to lose your remote). You can also wrap your hand around the side, at an angle. Or hold it over the top and use your ring finger to trigger. And there are a few ledges to rest your thumb and fingers for more grip. You can even turn it around and use a thumb action. I'll have to post photos to do it justice. It's admitted an unusual aesthetic (pragmatic) but it's a bit like _rock climbing ledges. It just works! -- A lanyard cannot satisfy these.

I appreciate this because I skated for 2 months one-handed with a semi-broken arm. I clutched the GT2B inside the sling (during the Winter cold). And it is sooo comfortable. 

Fatigue management is important when you're riding for long periods and the weather wears you out. Mitigating RSI and fatigue requires your hand to change positions, to switch it up every now and them. The MasterCho G2TB allows that with it's unique ergonomics. -- I've noticed the design is also _ambidextrous_, which is helpful for lefties. Understandably, ergonomics would be little noticed on a short board.

There's no delay in the switch. A simple feature and immediate on/off switch. Perfect for picking up your board to catch a bus or cross a road without risk of a stray motor tearing a finger off.

Hmm, agreed. Printing would be the disadvantage of both remotes. Both are DIY-esque and require assembly, sanding, fine tuning, etc. I agree that a mass produced mini remote would be better suited for replaceability in case of that. But also involvement in general. Accessories are perishable. They break. And when it breaks, do you really want to build one again? The GT2B will practically never break. And if something does give it will take less than 2 weeks to replace. It's also cheap enough that you can buy two remotes. But the Firefly needs a bit more work, a bit more money, and more involvement. 

In either case, remotes are clearly very personal preferences. Horses for courses. If there's enough demand I'll consider building the Firefly. I know good 3D printers who will produce top quality cases. But it won't be cheap... And I'm not sure about 'mass producing' it. But we'll see. 

Also, riding style needs to be factored in. How do you ride? For me, I'm mostly thrashing it down straights, carving, and weaving past obstacles. _I don't cruise._ So a 'multi-purpose button' is very low on the list, along with remote aesthetics, and riding 'modes' or settings. I need guaranteed power delivery, _right now,_ without skips, beeps, flashing lights, changing modes, etc. If I fall, it will be at 20-40kph and it _will_ be messy. The remote _must_ handle a _huge_ beating. For me, the ideal remote would be bionic. And the moment I step off the board I can turn it off ASAP and stuff it in a backpack, or the console container in my car, or velcro mounted to the board. It's function over form for me...

But remotes are personal... :slight_smile: 

Let me know! How do you describe your riding style? And what are you looking for in a remote?

An extra button on the remote would be nice to have especially on night rides to switch the lights ON / OFF, and to not draw extra attention to the police. I like having lights on a n8 ride when I’m flying at 30-40 km/hr or more through the city and the police is a real problem handing out heavy fines to individuals.

In case the 3 colours choices are too limited for you.

Here's more colours... :smile: 

Japan Black is the favourite by far, but personally I'd like to have BOTH black AND brown together... maybe natural too... 

I can visualise a really nice effect with black fibreglass enclosures on wood. Also, I could do special woodgrain inlays into the fibreglass... or carbon inlays into wood, etc.

@Hummie 

For those wondering about material performance with carbon vs fibreglass vs carbon kevlar, or metals, watch these videos for a side-by-side comparison.

This video demonstrates the merits of _carbon_ (4.5mm carbon plate - My samples are ~2mm) and metals like _chromoly_, _mild steel,_ and alloy as a stiff structural material. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khJQgRLKMU0

This video also demonstrates the merits of _carbon_ (super thick 20-25mm or 1" plate) under compression, and it's brittleness too. It _crumbles_ into smithereens as anyone who's crashed a carbon board will tell.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM6J-yw8yjA

_Fibreglass, kevlar, and foam core sandwiches_ are all good, depending on your goal and preference. 

Though for me, what I find surprisingly is the performance of mild steel and alloy (comparable to carbon), which would be worth incorporating into a future design.

Mounting Hardware
-------------------

You'll get _one set_ per module for _FREE_, with enough strip for the module. 

Neoprene is fine, but this stuff is _cushier_, _more flexible_, and _easier to apply_. Just peel and stick. The screw holes also fit neatly into the v-channel.

- 4x _weather resistant 304 stainless steel screws_ (M3, cross head)
- 4x _304 stainless steel washers_ (M3)(optional)
- 4x _plastic washers_ (optional extra) used on motorcycle fairings to prevent cracking from vibration
- 4x _Helicoil threaded inserts_ (optional extra) for extra reinforcement in-deck. Drill and epoxy glued into the deck. 

**What's _not_ included?** 
- M3 drill bit
- 1-2mm pilot hole drill bit

[**As an optional upgrade:** For $1-2 per insert you can upgrade to heavy duty stainless threaded inserts. These are commercial quality inserts with _wider threads_ that screw super securely into the deck. They look amazing with a blind flush finish and will last almost forever. You then also have the choice to Loctite the screws in afterwards.]

Members and regulars, despite the arguments and insults that were said on both sides in this thread, we must remember that is is a sales thread: hence, if you have an issue with the price or the vendor, it is up to you to not buy the product. I've deleted all posts within the last 24 hours, take no offense if yours was on topic - it was simply easier to clean it all up at once. Please keep in mind that there will be buyers, and it is not fair to them or the vendor if a thread is crouded with off-topic messages or complaints about the price. Besides that, let’s keep this forum a positive place! If you have only negative things to say - move on and find a thread where it’s easy to compliment. Thanks!
