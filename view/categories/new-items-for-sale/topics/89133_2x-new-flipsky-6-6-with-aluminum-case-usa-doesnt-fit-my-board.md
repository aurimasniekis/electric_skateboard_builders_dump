I have **2 new flipsky vesc 6.6's** for sale. Both come with ppm cable, original instruction sheet, and sensor wires. I bought them a little while ago for a new dual 6374 street board hoping to run 12s foc. They are to big for my enclosure. I should have bought the regular 6.6 without the aluminum case.... oops. they have never been used apart from trying to cram them into my fiberglass case. they were turned on once when i first got them with an 8s test battery, no use on the street though. theres a small abrasion to the paint on on corner from the fiberglass, other than that they are in perfect condition. I am looking to sell them for **$145 for 1, $270 for both. Free 3-4 day shipping anywhere in the USA.

Honestly, if it were me I'd ask $120-130.
A lot of sellers here also offer to include the shipping cost in their asking price.

It really depends on how quickly you want to get it sold. The lower the price, the faster it'll sell.
If you can wait, someone will eventually bite, as it is less than retail and shipping is a lot less.
