Hey yâ€™all I have a trampa urban carver deck for sale. Black and bronze ratchet bindings. Trampa mini spring trucks. Black vertigo trucks. Direct drive        e-toxx motor mount kit. Superstar wheels. Iâ€™ve never assembled or used, because the motors I got were too big, I kinda put this on the back burner as I had a bunch of other setups I was messing with. I also have a flexi 30q 12s5p w bms built by @barajabali  in a trampa underboard enclosure custom made to flex I was thinking bout selling separately but open to offers. 
- Also have a predator banshee for sale.

- Riptide electric skateboard for sale also.
-Onan v2 AWD setup for sale.

I see you still have the two 136kv Trampa motors. How does $125 for one or $250 for both sound?  You decide if you want to sell only one, or the pair (I only need one, but a spare would be cool).
