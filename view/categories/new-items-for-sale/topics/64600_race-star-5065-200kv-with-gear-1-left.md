are these sensor wires directly compatible with VESC, or do we need an adapter?

they are wire for a evolve. But I had it repined for a focbox. The motor Hall Sensor wire doesn’t have a temp on it. So it’s 5 pin. I put in a 6 pin connector and 3.5mm phase wire connectors

I have 4 in stock. Two wired that way. And 2 for evolve. I can change them to focbox. 
How many did you need?

Are these direct evolve replacements in regards to kv ?

No, the 140kv version is much better for Evolve replacements.  These will work but not as good and your ESC may overheat in some conditions

No. These are not factory spec evolve replacement motors. But I do carry factory spec evolve replacement motors.

```
Arguably, the 140kv ones are even better than the 150kv factory spec because they will work your ESC less hard leading to longer life and lower temperatures.

@hyperIon1 sorry for opening this up again but please tell me you have two race stars 200kv left wired for a focbox .. really looking for a small motor to take 12s.. I was also wondering if you have tryed the maytec 5065 170kv on 12s I think it is only rated for 10s correct me please and say YES to 12s. If not any recommendations .. 63xx is too fatt for what I'm doing it will work but I want clearance..what's a good lil power house other then the Hoyt pocket rockets..
