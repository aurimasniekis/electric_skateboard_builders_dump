I'm selling my vesc 6.0. I've only used it once for a test ride.

The reason for selling is that was running single drive but purchased a street carver board. I want to built a dual motor board and purchasing another vesc 6.0 is to expensive for me. So I have bought 2x  vesc-x for this project.

Trampa is selling them for € 345,- 

I was thinking about 275,- incl shipping for brand new vesc. Including 2 sets of jst ph cables.

Will ship with tracking code to your country. Prefer EU and paypal.
