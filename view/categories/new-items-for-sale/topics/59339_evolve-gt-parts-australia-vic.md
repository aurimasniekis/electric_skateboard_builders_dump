Hey gang, I was using some evolve parts to mock up a build im working on. As im now past this point and the parts are no longer required id like to provide them to the community at a DRASTICALLY reduced price. From evolve it would cost $354 (without shipping)
 All parts are brand new!
 Save yourself $104 for some great gear!! I'll throw in some sector 9 soft riders for free

PRICE FROM EVOLVE:
 GT Motor Mount $16
 Abec 9 bearings $25
 Rear truck $79
 Front Truck $75
 GT street wheels $99
 GT Street wheel pulley $30
 GT belt $30

As this is so cheap id prefer not to seperate parts. Happy to post or meet up somewhere in geelong for collection
