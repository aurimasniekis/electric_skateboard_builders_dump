Hey!

As a personal project, I have produced a really limited amount (five) of trampa mounts made of AL7075 aluminium, sandblasted, natural anodization. This includes everything you need, except the motor pulley (all part are displayed on the photos below).

-  ISO4B chains
- sprocket 60T


Ready to ship worldwide. I'm asking for 300 euros without shipping which means that I'm selling them without any profit :slight_smile:

yeah, to be honest; I did that for my pleasure. I got five sets; first comes served

selling theses will help me to develop and fund another project that I have in mind. So it's all reinvested in R&D !

I can also sell only the mounts with screw for those who want to go with belts.

hey @monkey32 - I used to run chains on my trampa and will try soon belts. I assume both have they advantages/drawbacks.

Thanks I was curious though if you know if this mount works with belt setups. I'd consider taking one if I knew it fit a belt driven system.

hey, I am cleaning my room and sell for a bargain the mountainboard mounts without pulleys to enable people to go with belts, chains or adapt they own system for a cheaper price.

That's 199 euros for the dual mount without the M8 screws: what you see on the following photos. Fits trampa trucks.

shipping worldwide - PayPal accepted !

haha, well I will share something with ya. My wife is expecting a baby soon and I'm arranging all my 3x3 square meter room that I was using for all my extra work prototyping activities to host this little okp. 

These mounts were paid by my personal money so I think it's nice to help a buddy that found a 6th month old thread and give this last one for free. For the "UNiK" stuff, we are going to do a give away soon, but I need to check with the accountant that we can manage to do it without being too much into the red line as we are running this hobby company on cash.

hey, just woke up and continued to clean my storage closets. I'm gonna add few more stuff for you. This is not brand new pristine wheels and superstar hubs (one of the hub makes a little noise) but that should be something you can play with.

I won't be needing the 5 meters ISO4B chain, so it's all yours too. I added also two chain connectors. The tires are used, but can help you. They include the inner tubes are new.

For the wheels sprockets, I also thrower two options for you. 66T and a bigger one coming from my mate Jens that I ordered in the past.

I will also add the esk8 riser but I need to take it at my friends home.

ps: the board on the left is not in the package, it's a @longhairedboy customer jewel that I'm taking care of.
ps2 : I will not take money from you, just the shipping cost. A deal is a deal.
ps3 : this was paid back in the days with my money, so not coming from any sponsorship or freebies or whatever.

Cheers man, that's what communities are for.

I think this is the last I had from last year. I may have few remaining parts, but for sure they won't fit a super carve truck. For the street carver, you need different mounts like this one that I did few weeks ago and that a friend is riding. I'm going to launch a new production of the super carve mounts as few people contacted me lately to get these

these are the mounts derived from my ATB mounts

you have the mounts already? than just measure out the length from mount outer position till the hanger hole.
those screws should be totally inside the mount, so i guess they not more than 15mm long, guess even shorter.
