Hey guys, finally our [FatBoy Sparky Switch v1.0](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/fatboy-sparky-switch-300a-60v-anti-spark-switch/51532/40) is available to buy.

FatBoy Sparky Switch is Anti-Spark switch for high current loads. It uses SOT-227 Mosfet in High-Side load switching setup instead of traditional Low-Side switches which means on this switch positive wire is switched. The Sparky Switch comes with a CNC machined aluminium block to increase thermal capacity for high load application. 

### Features:
* Press to turn on / hold to turn off
* Momentary push button support
* LED output for power state (requires external resistor calculated for specific LED/input voltage values)
* CNC machined aluminium block to increase thermal capacity (for high loads it needs to be cooled/attached to bigger radiator)
* Screw terminals for high current ring connectors or busbars

### Specifications:

| | |
|-|-|
| Input Voltage | 25V - 60V (6S - 14S) |
|Current rating	|Up to 300A (requires external cooling)|
|Dimensions|100 mm x 40 mm x 26 (with screws) 22 (without screws) mm|
|Weight|250g|

Price is 70€ + (VAT if applies) + Shipping

How much can the switch take without external cooling? :slightly_smiling_face:

Without this aluminum or with it? If with it for normal esk8 loads impulses of high current for less than minute should be sufficient. If you going to run constant for longer than minutes you will need external cooling

[/quote]

This is kind of a basic spec, especially since your product is designed to address weaknesses in existing designs.

Do you think you can give a number for current it can handle continuously without supplemental cooling? Pessimistic is fine to cover all reasonable conditions (unventilated enclosure, summer, climbing hills on pneumatics)?

And ideally what "real world" vesc battery amps (total if multi motor) you expect it to handle?

Thanks for making this thing. I wish I caught this before putting in the PCB order lol.

At ~50A continues without heatsink the mosfet was already really warm

With screws on top its 26mm it looks big but it isn't ;)

@FredrikHems with heatsink its warm on  50A but not that warm as without it and   it stays warm for I don't know up to 150A then without additional mass or active cooling temperature rise pretty quickly ;)

I get the thermal absorption of the alloy,  it's a lot bigger than the A/S normally seen I guess that's needed, does it have to be that long?

Is there a way to incorporate the pcb into the design of the focbox enclosure or too much heat combined?

Otherwise nice!

Well the input and output is on there, but it doesn't say what the other connector in your renderings is for?

In your description you say it has a push button, hold button, a place for a fuse..  I'm just trying to figure out where these are supposed to hook up now.  Obviously the power input and output needs no explanation, but I'm not sure about the rest is all. Thanks for your help this looks fantastic!

Yes I realize that, but the PCB still has what looks like that connector thing that is in the renderings, except it's not on there... So I'm just curious what we need to do to connect an on/off switch, where the fuse would go, all that stuff, cause all I see currently is just the input and output.

It's all marked right there.  I'm not sure what else you could need to know.  Only the Input+ and Output+ need to be large-gauge wire.

![image (21)|690x293](upload://b2D4mFZyrHmruQEZcWLAMQpwRVC.jpg)

GND means "Ground" or negative and BTN means "button" (momentary-style) and LED means Light-Emitting-Diode and you'd need a resistor for current-limiting depending on what LED you use.  The LED port is optional.

The momentary switch goes between GND and BTN

I am sorry but this product is for higher technical level, not made for beginners, if you dont know where to plug fuse I would not suggest to use this device as the currents that high can kill you. I would suggest to learn basics of electronics first to understand how this device works where to connect it and what potential dangers are.

The point is that this is experimental hardware using enough power to stop your heart.  So you need at least a novice understanding before you start working with it.  

The switch goes right here...

Which anyone with a novice understanding of electronics and high-amperage switching systems would know.

@Kug3lis any changes that you could make your dual housing for focbox, like the one for the Escapes, so it could be mountet inside an enclosure, and stil have greate cooling via the fins.... I never got, why you want your dual enclosure to be a separate thing, with lot of wiring harness between the dual enclosure and all the other components?

If you do, count me in. I would love to make a hole in my Trampa enclosure, for the focbox heatsink. 

"Just" make it, so the original plastic cover, still could be used. 

Btw. I have now your orange dampas both in the front and back, and i freaking love how the boards feels, good job. My only concern is, how fast they will wear out ?

The original design had the fuse built in to the switch which is why I asked. Or it could be between the switch and battery on positive.

Just curious because I have not seen many with them on the negative wire even though it serves the same function
