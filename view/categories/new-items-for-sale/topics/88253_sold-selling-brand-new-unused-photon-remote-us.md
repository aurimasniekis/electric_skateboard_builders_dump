Hi There,

I'm selling my brand new Photon remote. I bought it to hook up led lights but it seems that i need to buy a step down bracket and I just do not have enough space inside my enclosure to fit all these electronics neither am i that electronically savvy.

The remote is fresh out of the box. Willing to let it go for $120 + shipping(max $5 bucks)

The wires for Tx and Rx have been switched on the JST 6 pin cable to fit the VESC 6 design.

$25. I think DHL will be best, cheapest and quickest.
