Just want to leave this here for anyone on the fence. I'm in the process today of assembling my board with bergs on it, bearing fitment is excellent, anodizing finish is professional and all over feel is great. 

Aside from all of that Timo is just a damn good guy, his customer service, attention to detail and overall amount of fucks he gives for esk8 and his customers can't be stressed enough.

What did you do for pulleys?

I notice you fit these on sr tkp right? With 10mm axel?

A simple pulley solution which I can buy is holding me back. I think ü§î.

Those are Haggy pulleys. @Skunk wrote a great guide somewhere that I probably should have read before starting :rofl:

Essentially, buy a shitload of 10mm ID x 12/13mm ID washers, like: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Aluminium-Flat-Washers-6mm-8mm-10mm-12mm-14mm-16mm-18mm-20mm-22mm-26mm/281770185167?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=580772988062&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649

Some of these bearings for the pulley: 16100-2Z SKF Deep Grooved Ball Bearing 10x28x8, http://www.wychbearings.co.uk/16100-2z_skf_shielded.html

Some M8 90mm shoulder bolts: https://jandsfasteners.co.uk/socket-shoulder-screws-high-tensile-grade-12-9-self-colour/

Some Ebay 10mm ID x 13mm OD x 10mm width aluminium spacers

Slap it all together and you're done.

Damnit thanks. 

Sounds like too much effort. I‚Äôm lazy that way. When there‚Äôs a one place shop to fit them on sr tkp or sr rkp I‚Äôll consider them again. 

If I buy them now which would be the silver ones I‚Äôd only have a set of wheels and nowhere to put them. And I don‚Äôt want the kaluha trucks unfortunately.

Seems pretty much any pullys with bearings need 90mm axles. Same on my bkb pullys, same needed for 6shooters.
And the spacers your surfrodz came with should have you covered for what you need.

Sixshooter takes 80mm axles from surfrodz. Are they really 90mm?

It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt believe you but this is what psychotiller himself states on his site. 

So if sr tkp allows 80mm with sixshooters, won‚Äôt bergmeisters work with 80mm too? Why does it not? Which part where makes it breaks it?

Hi @Eboostin : so far I have not had any damage to the anodizing, BUT I think it would be inevitable that over time some marks will appear where the valve stem touches the rim....especially if dirt and small rocks come in between. It would only be a very small part of the rim that is in contact with the valve ![image|375x500](upload://4dNhcMBscjsxoMXc8fJZUTRLSb7.jpeg)

On my previous setup I was at 40/45kmh max full throttle, and I was on Supercarve truck, all good.
Now with the Nano Gear Drive 2.6:1 on TB218, and I pass to 12s, I should graze 50/55kmh.

I feel like super safe on the Bgm in any time :v: :blush:

It looks so fucking cool.  It really  is crazy the extra stability you get from these setups.

That low drop center of gravity is insanely stable and I feel like as more people experience it, we will see more and more similar builds (psyched!).


You get this awesome combination of "roll over ability", stability, and carvability.... it is kinda indescribable.

Just wait until the members of this forum are fucking flooded with over 100 Surf Rodz adjustable baseplates...


...and super reasonably priced @moon gear drives...

@Darklinks: hi there. Yes the Bergmeisters are fully compatible with evolve gt. I had two 60t pulleys made (POM and Aluminum). Both work well and the same pulley also works on the tb218 truck. The only thing that needs to be changed is the bearing pulley, which we will also supply. for the first batch we will only make the pulley out of POM which has proved to be durable and of course is much lighter. I expect them to be ready in stock and for sale by March 20.

@nuttyjeff it would be so awesome to be able to get green anodizing on one of the gear drives, I guess too late to do anything

In what green specifically? :slight_smile: 

If you're talking about the bergmeister green, I can definitely have your sets anodized in that colour!
