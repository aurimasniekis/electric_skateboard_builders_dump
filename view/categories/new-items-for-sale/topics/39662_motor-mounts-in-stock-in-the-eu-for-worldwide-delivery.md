These look great! They will also act as a nice heatsink for the motors. I like the infinite angle adjustment, you can get the most out of them regardless of the shape of your deck (tail vs no tail, etc).  Branding is also neat and subtle.

It's nice to see more products coming from EU/UK vendors... import fees are never fun!

it looks like if you put a long belt and motor to farthest end, you could fit some idlers?

I have just confirmed that these mounts will work with the Torqueboards Extended 218mm Caliber clones.

You just need to open up the the ring a little with a big flat screw driver, use some heatshrink over the top of the screwdriver to avoid damaging the anodise

hey @stormboard1 :slight_smile:
  
not quite sure what you mean by plate?

the mount comes with 4 x motor screws, and the two bolts required to clamp the motor mount to the truck. i.e everything you need to fix it to the truck and also to fix the motor to the motor mount. 

wheel pulleys also come with all mounting bolts required to attach the pulley to the wheel.

are you looking for a total price on:
* motor mount
* motor pulley
* wheel pulley
* belt

if you let me know exactly what you are after I will come up with a sprecial @stormboard1 price and PM you
