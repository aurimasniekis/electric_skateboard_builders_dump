Hello! 

I want to sell my pre-ordered Raptor 2. 
I live in Sweden, Stockholm. Would prefer to sell to someone from Sweden due to easy way of payment (swish).
My order number starts with #97 so its close.

Yours, 
OLGAmedT

@UniqueSnowflakeN27 if you köpa the raptor 2 I know a lot of people on here would like to see a drag race between a dual 6374 belt driven system. Maybe you could face my board somewhäre in Sweden? :)

Yes yes, but it would have been nice to have one över, so you can låna ut den till en friend emellanåt!
