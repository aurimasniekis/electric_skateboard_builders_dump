I have had these available for a few weeks but I feel my current thread doesn't make it very obvious I have these totally ready to go.

The non-idler is available [here](https://boardnamics.com/product/surfrodz-63mm-motor-mount-stealth-edition/)

The idler is available [here](https://boardnamics.com/product/surfrodz-63mm-motor-mount-stealth-edition/)

These are the highest quality mounts I can produce with the resources I have. They look and perform like a premium mount should. Very happy with how these turned out :slight_smile: 
All the information regarding them can be found on our [website](http://www.boardnamics.com)

Looks like another great product buddy.

Just to confirm, on the idler version tb110's would be a no go?

Why can't you build clamps where the split is parallel to the road surface?  That way there is less chance of the bolt/nut getting caught on something.   Major design flaw IMO.

The hangar is a hexagon. Mount the clamp however you want.
