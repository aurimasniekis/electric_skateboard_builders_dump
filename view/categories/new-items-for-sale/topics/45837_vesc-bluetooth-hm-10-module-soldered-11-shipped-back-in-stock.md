I was buying these while under strong influence of *ughm* and ordered 10 instead of 1 so here I am with a bag of HM-10s
Any interest for these?
Everything that needs to be soldered on is soldered and basically you just plug and play, they work with ackmaniacs firmware and app maybe some other if there is one

11$ Shipped Worldwide
The next ones will look nicer, I will think of something :smiley:
Under the electrical tape is heatshrink for each pin, if thats something you are interested in...

Hi Karlo,
the bluetooth module arrived yesterday.
Thank you so much! I don't know how you are doing this, but your module with soldering and shipping is cheaper than a single bare module here in Japan.
This forum is awesome and should be considered as a role model for future societies!!
Getting a letter from Croatia was really exciting.
If you ever need something from over here let me know i will try my best.

These HM-10 modules will work with both iOS and Android. With the only exception is Android 8.0 Oreo that requires a firmware reflash (via Arduino) to make it work. While on iOS it'll work no matter what. 
Source: currently using one that works flawlessly with my iPhone, tried with my friend's Note 8 and didn't work.

If the title says it's back in stock but its not being sold, should the thread not be closed or at least marked as not available anymore? Just because its an old thread doesnt mean its not being sold anymore. Besides, you just did the same thing by commenting...
