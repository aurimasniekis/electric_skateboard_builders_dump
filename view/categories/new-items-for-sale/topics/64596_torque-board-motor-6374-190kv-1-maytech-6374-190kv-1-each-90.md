Hmmmm I want to do dual 6374s, not sure if doing 2 different motors on the same board would be a good idea or not.

Do you have any sets of 6374s you wanna get rid of?

I have 2 sets of the 6365 Maytech sealed 170kv motors. ![image|375x500](upload://syDczGvZUqDWo45czoE3BTeHEgT.jpeg)

how much for those guys? 

Would it be that big of an increase from my TB 6355s? (I'll be going 12s on this build)

It has its benefits, little more toque, better startup toque in foc. Sealed so no dirt and debris. Water resistant. 
We order them at 170kv because itâ€™s the middle ground for heat and braking. Witch is great with these motors. 
And not much more than the TB 6374. 

The 6365 are 220$ shipped a set.

Following this, would the 6374 170kv closed maytechs perform even better with 12s?

Not sure if heat would be a problem on 170kv but maybe not an issue on 12s?

Yes you can run on 12s thatâ€™s what I tested it on. A 12s4p with the Maytech 100a esc. Over heating or higher  temps were observed on motors with 190kv, 200kv and of course 220kv. Sealed does add to it. But itâ€™s still under the recommended temp limits.

interesting I was expecting the 170kv to heat up quicker as its got lower kv/more winds on the same sized stators. Has debris or water getting inside the motors ever been a concern with the open 6374s?

True, I did as well think that going in to testing the sealed motors. To compare. They run like the evolve race star 5065 150kv (almost sealed) in bldc and about 5-7 degrees hotter in foc but super smooth. This was tested in central Texas heat and high humidity. And other factors are road temp and rider weight. 
As for debris I personally have had to shake out gravel after some hard slides and AT riding on trails and bike paths. Also we are tired of the red motors. 
So in terms of performance they are the same as itâ€™s unsealed versions.

Our motors use N45 magnets, NSK Japanese bearings; Stator is stacked with silicon steel; stainless steel shaft, etc.

Thank you for the information. Itâ€™s good to see Maytech rep on the firum. Especially for the iquestions on components of the units. I currently work with Eileen / shanghai office.

I think I'm going to pass for now....I've been upgrading parts on my build and I haven't even gotten the board finished!

I'll try out the motors I have and if they aren't enough, then I'll look more into upgrading.

Thanks everyone!

Your motors should be priced better. You are missing out on a huge market share because of that. Hope you realize that.

@Maytech_Cyril, Thanks for the detailed information, it does instill a lot of confidence in your motors. I would definitely pay more if I knew for sure that they last a long time, **however** when I hear anecdotes that motors don't last more than 2000km, I definitely don't feel like paying a lot more. 

I can't say for others, but for me this is a replacement for public transport/car and I ride a total of about 200km per month. Even after paying so much for Maytech motors if it doesn't last me a whole year then I would likely go for cheaper motors that people regularly use and are satisfied with.

This is what one user(@DerelictRobot)  has to say about his experience with maytech motors in [this](https://forum./t/esk8s-for-commuting-how-much-does-it-cost/363/22) thread.
[quote="DerelictRobot, post:22, topic:363"]
Maytech 6374 sealed 170kv motors, gen1. Picked up half a dozen of these, sent 2 to a friend and he immediately had issues with the magnets coming loose within the first 50 miles. I had similar issues with previous Maytechs so I did an experiment where I hardened my left motor at kept my right one stock/untreated. At approx 700 miles in the untreated right motor started making the recognizable â€˜twang at specific mid range of RPMâ€™ noise that is the permanent magnets coming loose.

I kept riding that setup until a few days ago, my untreated motor next actually failed but was making noise that I know to be the retainer ring coming loose. The left hardened one is still holding up fine. At approx 2600 miles on both.
[/quote]

 I do realize that this is just one user(and his friend), so not representative of all Maytech motors, but it would be nice if you test them until failure under the conditions experienced by electric skateboarding and publish average life expectancy etc. Without that kind of information, not many are likely to buy expensive motors.
