It doesn't fit in the s2000. Unlike the Evo or Icarus. So it's gotta go. Lol

Yeah I'm not willing to put anything on the trunk. Been considering welding a hitch like

That's not mine. Just what I would do if I built a hitch.

To everyone that has messaged me offering 600-800 dollars complete. Y'all are out of your mind. The drives alone are the price.

I'll take best offer over $1500 + shipping, prefer to ship in Cont 48 US only, if someone offers $1800 ill ship free anywhere in the lower 48 free. 

Think about it. I need this gone ASAP.
