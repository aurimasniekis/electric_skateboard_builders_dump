Yes, got the full package.

Decided for traveling purposes it would be easier to use the NESE Modules so no spot welding required, :smile:

Well the set was $95 and shipping was $29 (up from $25) plus like $7 for PayPal fees, that's like $131.  I was thinking $120 shipped.

Amazing spot welder.

Nese modules are nice but they take too much space compared with spot welded batteries

Yes there a bit wider in length and about 5mm more width, but that hardly is enough to discourage me from using them if I able to make any sized battery with them and can travel with that as well.

The spot welder, yes.   Have 6 of the 2s4p NESE models on the way so no spot welding necessary and can travel no problem :wink:
