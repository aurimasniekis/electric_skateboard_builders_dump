Since I'm home for Labor Day weekend, I had the chance to look at and repair a reported defective unit. It's an all black Firefly remote. Normally I'd offer this to my spreadsheet of interested buyers from this summer, but due to only being home for a couple days, I'd like this sold as soon as possible. So first come, first serve! As a heads up, I'm trying to build 2 more of these as well this weekend, so keep an eye out for another thread with those. 

Price: $120 Shipped in the US
Will include: remote, receiver, and wrist strap.
Remote also has a programmable USB port.
