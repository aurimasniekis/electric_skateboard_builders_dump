Brand new just built(will include more info tomorrow)
Specs:
Carvon v3 motors
Abec 97mm flywheels 
Enertion focboxs
Thumb drive controller
12s5p battery 30q cells copper and nickel strip, batterysupports bms with e switch
12s 2amo charger
Custom abs enclosure
Build was meant to destroy any other board preformance wise, with a high voltage battery bragging 15000 mah, it's the follow up of the previous raptor slayer with upgrades in all areas except speed. This is better than the carvon evo in everyway for a similar or better price and no wait. Got injured on thanksgiving and won't be riding for quite a while but still gotta pay bills so sadly my loss = your gain. Pm me offers I'm located in California

I wish but doctor said anywhere from 1-6 months no riding, I got one test ride in on some pretty steep hills near me and it handled like a champ, didn't do a Range test but I didn't get any noticeable sag

SoCal. Orange County to be exact

[quote="Exiledd_Top, post:5, topic:39521"]
about 1600$
[/quote]
Not bad V3/V4 is at $600 now, FocBoxes would be $300 retail. so $700 for 12s5p battery, BMS, enclosure, etc and labor

You will love them! The battery is the one thing I always lack. Expensive and I donâ€™t want to DIY those. Probably burn down the house.

Yeah, Ill build everything except batteries.  Too much of an investment in equipment and cells to lear and a ton of risk.
