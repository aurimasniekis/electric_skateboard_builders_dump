double stack 12s6p
[/quote]
probably - yes. according to hummies post - the hole is 140mm wide by 590 by 15mm deep
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/hummie-deck-new-wood-carbon-decks-group-buy-round-4-125-shipped-us/43245?u=eldoska
for double stack you need about 34-38mm total depth. hole depth + enclosure depth =  43mm total depth.

if your battery has 2 layers, you can take big box - up to 12s8p
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/volokno-fiberglass-enclosures/96504/21

if you battery is has one layer - i can make you a modular enclosure like on my integrated deck. one part will cover battery, oher - electronics. between two parts will be a rubber seal
