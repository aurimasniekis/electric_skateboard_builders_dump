Hi guys,

I'm selling 45 new 26650 liitokala batteries:
_Capacity: 5000mAh_
_Max continues current: 25A_
_Diameter 27mm_
_Length: 65mm_
_Weight: 95g_
I have a spotwelder and parts laying here to make a complete 10S battery pack as you can see in the pictures.
So if someone is intrested in buying a battery pack.

I'm not able to use them because they took a month to arrive and in the meantime I had already bought other sells which arrived faster to make my esk8 and use it the summer.

Some possibilities:
- 10S2P with/without bypassed bms
- 10S4P with/without bypassed bms
- 12S2P without bms
- 12S3P without bms
...

 A 10S2P 10Ah battery would be perfect if you want to build a board with the ownboard/wowgo kit and you wish you had more range than stock the batteries they are selling.

These are no fake cells, I tested them and they perform like they should. Lygte has a full review about a ton of cells!
Here's a comparison between 30Q - Sanyo - Littokala:

Some other pics because people like pictures:

![IMG_20190129_134106|375x500](upload://lv1OTMmaFCN8YTgtY2zmj2uj8Ff.jpeg) 

For prices It depends on the cell configuration.
(For example, I would ask 150€ for a 10S2P with bms)

This is my 4th esk8 which is using the ownboard esc and motors, love the board and it's pretty affortable (500€)

I have 21 cells left.
So I can make a 10S2P with bms.

I have used these in my last 2 builds the only down side after 40 or so Cycles the range seams to diminish a lot more than say Samsungs, the current capacity is awesome and the 18mm to 26mm width is easily compensated for.

Good to know! Maybe if you don't pull max current out of the cells the lifespan will be better.

I'm using a ownboard hub esc which pulls max 20A so that's only 10A max/cell (for a 10S2P).

How many amps do you pull max and which battery and esc setup do you have?

12S3P 15000Mah bestech charge only BMS powering 2 x 6.6 flipsky esc's ( cells were bought during black friday sale 40 cells for $160) value for money is awesome and range is still awesome. Current limit I have set at 60amps. Sadly the seller no longer ships to Australia :(

Oh nice, that's a pretty sweet pack!
Maybe you can find other sellers who can ship to Australia?

Liitokala 21700 4Ah is also a very nice and cheap cell.
