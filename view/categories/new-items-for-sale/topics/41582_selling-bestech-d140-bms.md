**Samsung 30Q cells are SOLD**


Selling 24 brand new 30Q cells and a brand new BMS. Both of these were acquired from the recent group buys on here. NOT SPLITTING UP THESE CELLS.

I'm selling the 30Qs for $110 + shipping. This is pretty much what I got them for.
 **SOLD**


BMS is a Bestech D140 (10S 10A) meant for charging only. Selling it for 35$ + shipping. Again, what I got them for. 
**Still Available**
