I'm definitely gonna buy it if you decide to do so! I was just wondering, how do you feel using that remote? Many people are scared by the connection issues

Good enough for me. Also because the only alternatives are the torqueboards' one and that one i recently saw on miamiboards, but that's not easy to get

I see, i can get the tb one for you ill include it in the group buy. If your worried about stability the trigger style is more reliable and i am currently thinking about getting it. I can get the torqueboard one for $30 its actually cheaper than the nano if your worried about your budget

Well, that would be great! Maybe i'll buy one of the winning ones in the future, cause i really like the style, but i prefer to have something reliable to start my eboard experience. Thanks, i'll follow the thread! Oh, i didn't follow this part, what's the payment method?
