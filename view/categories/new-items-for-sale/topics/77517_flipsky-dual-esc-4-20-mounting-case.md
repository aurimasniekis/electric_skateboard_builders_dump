You only need to unscrew the four heatsink pcb screws, Attach the Enclosure, and screw it on again. Before i will trash my prototypes i will sell it for cheap. Because its a prototype.

This is great. I particularly like the introduction of the revolutionary orange cover design ðŸ˜‚

It is more or less Red ðŸ™ˆ Well sometimes pictures doesnt get the right colors. Otherwise it is not the Best Red youve seen
Edit: but how does @longhairedboy used to say: Red Enclosures make the Esc 20% faster

Hey I have a 4.20 for sale, practically new, just bench tested and did a loop around the block to make sure that everything was working (about 300 meters). I'll sell for $125 + shipping. I am in Chicago. Let me know if interested.

This is how it looks mounted to a Deck.

It an Enclosure, just a mounting case. Nothing special
