As of now, It will take me a day to print a set of 12s4p . Thatâ€™s no where close to being sustainable. Because I will still be printing these Iâ€™m doing an early cost ended up higher than I wanted to be.

You will have the option of mix of 1s4p and 2s4p modules for cutomized flexibility at different part of your board. Pieces will be cleaned up, Inspected and test fitted before shipping out.

Dimension of 1s4p module is 22h x 73w x 76l
2s4p saves 1mm in length. 
![image|345x234](upload://yRYZXXVN4V2NoaArYs3J4cm3DxK.jpeg) 


Other configurations:
* 1,2,3,4s 2-8p modules
* Stagger stack
* Align stack
All available as long as it doesnâ€™t exceed 10 cells in length. Price will be figured out and discussed.

Add-ons:

* Choices of 30Qs or VTC6
* Hex bit to save elbow grease
* Mini hex bit ratchet (highly recommending hand turning for finish compression. Not liable for damages caused by over compression)

Offer will be availabled once beta tester receive their units within 2 weeks and provide user feedback and pics.

### Saving you some math and comparison:

NESE 10s4p modules = 90 EURO (with 4p modules) and 84 EURO (with 2s4p). + Shipping

# Warnning! Subjective opinion, Do **NOT** over react.

Advantages over spot welding:

* Low initial cost
  * -cost on spot welder
* Save you time and effort to
  * Research spot welding technique
  * Source material
* Modularity
  * Easy to replace cells
  * Easy to upgrade battery pack
  * (Work in progress) travel friendly. Dis assemble into smaller packs for flights
* Cost

Disadvantages:

* Lesser conductivity between cell and busbar/braid contact (this is debatable, not going to argue.)
* Not fool proof. If you assemble wrong, you and I will be very very sad.
* Material, 3d printed part not the best at mechanical properties. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m raising money to scale up production using other manufacturing method.

Advantage over NESE:

* shorter module length across cell diameter for more compactness
* Adjustable flexibility between modules
* Future prove as I will keep working on these and backward compactible is on the list.

Disadvantage vs NESE:

* Require a little longer and more tedious to assemble
* can mess up you if assembled incorrectly

Series connection by tin plated copper braid for adjustable flexibility and spacing between cells. Cut a longer stripe of braid to leave more gap between modules for more flex, shorter Baird otherwise. You can also get the 2s modules to put at the ends of your deck where it has less deflection when your board flex.  Balance wire is soldered on to the braid either at the series connection or on a little square hole at the other end of the braid opening hole.

I'm choosing braid because of the advantage of adjustable spacing and flexibility mentioned above. Thing to consider about braid tho. As @Kug3lis pointed out that raid is not as conductive as copper busbar and has more resistance. The thickness of the braid I ended up choosing is much higher rates than needed. I have done a 60A discharge test on 4x 30qs and the braid was definitely colder than the cells at the end. You can check out the video in the other post.

Sorry guys, I realized I made a mistake. I definitely priced it too high as I was getting hyped by @MiniChopper4Me LOL. no worries. here's an updated price chart: 
* +shipping (USPS flat rate medium $13.65 for most of them if you get a full battery set) will try to fit in small flat rate box $7.2 if you order smaller sets)


*notice that there's a big jump in price between 4p to 5p single stack. thats because 5p would require 6 standoffs for compression whereas 4p only requires 4.

Beta tester here. 

If you're on the fence, here's some pictures to inspire you to get this kit:

![20181130_151734|666x500](upload://73X9MRDvh83uXuHZmD5YrmAr6Vu.jpeg)

My approach is slightly different than the original design, but as a beta tester we are experimenting with what we can do to improve upon the design. In my case, I'm trying to use xt-30's as connectors to modularize the whole system.

The best thing about this kit is that **everything is reversible** and can be made with **readily available components**. If mess up the soldering or cutting of the copper braiding I can repurchase supplies separately.

Stay tuned to how I'm planning to modularize the balance cables.

I like how @neiru37 took his own spin on making them modular. That's one way you can do it. I'm still struck on integrating some connector into the cell holder and try not to make them bigger.

Have you done any long-term testing of the plastic under load? What have you seen?
I've done something similar but for just very small battery packs...2 to 6 cells for varying cell types. A problem I've run into with 3d printing polymers I've used is that they didn't stand up well over time. After about 1 year or so, the plastic split between the cells due to the forces applied to assure each cell has a solid electrical connection. This usually caused loss of power from the pack. When I tried to "lock-down" the cells with less force to reduce the load on the polymer, the electrical connections began to show intermittency and overheat (I suspect) due to the less solid and perhaps lower-surface area connection with the cell contacts.

I am thinking of doing a pack for my ebike - your sets would be awesome for that.
How can I get some to test? I am already thinking of how to connect the separate modules to each other so that they don't "wobble" around (on a bike I don't have an enclosure that holds them - but the empty screw holes could be useful to somehow screw the individual modules together). On a bike I will probably need some rather complex structure to perfectly fit inside the frame. Vibrations will be low (impacts not so much though on a downhill bike).

Yeah would be nice to get more details about your setup and how it get wore out over time. what type of filament did you use and what's your print setting? would be nice to see a model too. 

As for long-term testing, I haven't been able to find established research on 3d printed material aging under stress (please let me know if you find something). My understanding is PETG is a great material with very little drawback for our application. about 70C glass temp, Pliable, durable and good layer adhesion. Check this article out more about PETG.
https://all3dp.com/1/petg-filament-3d-printing/#section-petg-filament-explained-and-compared

I have addressed some concerns on stress due to over tensioning the parts. I have tuned a lot of dimensions so that everything would fit within reasonable tolerance for good compression while not putting too much stress on the 3d printed parts.

@Maxid thanks for you interest. I'm currently a little busy on school rn. I'll make an update to reply to all interest maybe in a week or 2. Yeah, you have noticed it. those empty holes are great for a few reasons. I decided to leave them there so that you can chain holders together and attach to an additional piece that you would use to screw into your longboard deck like @mishrasubhransu's for the NESE. (i have not CAD one out yet but it should be easy few hour job with testing)

A bit of 3D printing stuff in my experience, maybe not super applicable to these, as PETG may serve this purpose just fine.

I find myself not using PETG for eskate applications, *most of the time*. Contrary to a lot of articles on the internet, I've found PETG to be fairly brittle. It's still strong and somewhat flexible, but if you are doing less than 10 layers or 6 walls on two sides, I find it can't take a ton of stress. For these hardware compression cells, I think (with testing) it should be fine, as long as you aren't compressing with too much force. PETG is great for larger parts though IME, parts that have a lot of extra mass to take flexing stress off smaller areas.

Nylon is king when it comes to strength, but I am afraid unless you find the right type of nylon that is extremely rigid, nylon might be a bit too flexible for these compression cells... but as long as your compression bolts are spaced evenly, you could torque these down a CRAP TON if they were made out of nylon and not have to worry about cracking. I've had only one part made out of nylon ever outright break on me, and it sheared across the whole part and not the layer lines. With PETG, i've had maybe a third of my parts just crack, like stress fractures, that I ended up just replacing those prints with the same parts made out of nylon.

Thanks for you input and saying sorry ahead of time if it sounds too defensive.

Yeah Nylon is definitely a great material with a lot of advantages over PETG. Personally I have not print with nylon before because it requires me to do numerous more upgrades to my cr-10 which is already very modified. (I'll eventually get there, making this from a $300 machine to $600) 

Petg is brittle if you compare it to nylon and I totally agree that nylon can be too flexible too. It's all about finding the right material for the use case rather than the absolute optimal. There are also a lot more mix filaments that are great and available on the market: Pla-CF, PET, Nylon, Nylon-PLA, Nylon-CF. I definitely have a limited experience with filaments, but I find PETG reasonable for this application. it's also widely used thus available at low cost. I will get to explore more material once we move on from 3d printing.

On a side note, I've heard about some self extinguishing plastics that's also super interesting.
