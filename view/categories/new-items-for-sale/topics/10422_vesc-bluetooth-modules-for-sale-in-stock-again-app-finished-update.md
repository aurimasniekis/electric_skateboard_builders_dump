Thank you every one in the community. This has been a long time coming, and the time is now. I have been working hard to find a solution to our needs to see what our vescs are doing via bluetooth, and creating the vehichle to sell these chips, [Rocket Boards](http://www.rocketboards.club/).

After around a month of testing, I'm proud to introduce you to our first product, **The VESC Bluetooth Module**. What this chip does is port forward everything generated by your vesc straight to your iphone via Bluetooth 4 Low Energy.

The app for use with this chip is in the app store. I did not write the app (credits to @gpxiBen and @makevoid), but plan on modifying it in the near future, and I have plans to write my own app also. When these updates are ready, you will simply install them via the apple app store, and you can use the same bluetooth module.


**What this app does?**

The VESC Vision is an open source logger designed to give electric skateboard builders the ability to see what is going on with their vesc while they are riding. The app can give real time information about:

- Mosfet Temperatures
- Motor Current
- Input Current
- RPM
- Input Voltage
- Amp Hours
- Watt Hours

and more...

Graphs are generated and can be displayed one at a time (info about the other graphs are recorded in the background). Data is also saved and can be pulled up on a computer, and overlayed over videos.

**Where can I download this app**
This app is available in the Apple App store. Simply search for vesc vision and download it.

**Is there an andriod version**
No, not at this time, although, it's possible there will be in the future.

**Where can I buy this chip**
You can buy this chip from one of two places.

Firstly, you can buy it from the manufacturer, [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2479). This does not come with a plug or wired for this application.

The second option is through my company, [Rocket Boards](http://www.rocketboards.club/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1&products_id=1). I wire, attach a plug, and test all chips by hand multiple times before shipping. All chips are confirmed to be 100% working before shipping with JST 6 plugs, which are compatible with all VESCs 4.6 through 4.12.

Buying from me also helps to fund keeping the app in the app store. I pay $117 USD per year, just to keep this app in the app store. All profits from this first batch will go straight towards paying this fee.

**What's the catch**
There's always catch with just about every product. It's just most companies will keep any "negative" information away from you if possible, while only highlighting the positives. My business philosophy is about being open to my customers, giving them more info, rather than less, even if this info could steer away business.

Right now, there is a minor bug in the app with the graphs. Over time, the graphs appear in delayed time. i.e, you see what happened 2 seconds ago instead of the current values. If you give it a few seconds, you will see the data. Since the graph is a running graph, you don't ever miss or lose any data. It's just if you are viewing in real time, it become out of sync with what's happening.

An example of the app and this bug can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr6juBAWX-w

All of the data you need to make decision about your board is there, as you can see. I believe this bug could be caused by too high of a refresh rate of the graph. I will look into this more, and hopefully fix this bug soon.

It is possible to change vesc values through this chip, so it's really the limit of what can be programmed in the iphone app, rather than any hardware restrictions. i.e, this chip is future proof for other apps I plan to write.

Thank you everyone, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask.


**This is currently a small test batch to make sure everyone has the same results as I have. There are 13 units for sale, with more on the way if all goes well in about 1-2 weeks.**

@evoheyax welcome to vendorhood. 

Congratulations on the website and the product development. It's great to see more businesses starting up and innovating. 

When I started this forum i hoped that it would be an environment that allowed new business to florish. I have always believed that business and end users need to mix together openly if we are to build the diy esk8 scene into a legitimate industry.

A recent trend of new ventures on this forum is a very positive sign of a healthy & growing community. The more the better.

Strap in & prepare for one hell of a ride. 2017 is going to be huge.

Hey everyone. I just want to clarify things as I don't want you to mis understand. You can only run 1 chip per vesc system currently. My understanding of the bluetooth limitations of bluetooth in general is you can only communicate via bluetooth with one device at a time (though you can be connected to multiple and switch turns, but not with this app). This app reads data from the first vesc it finds (it doesn't provide an option to go back and forth between 2 chips). So if you buy 2 chips, they would need to be used on 2 different systems, at least for the time being. If I can figure out how to properly send xml setting files to the vesc, it could be useful to have multiple in one system, but not at this time.

All orders have been shipped.

To my United States customers, your orders are scheduled to arrive this coming Tuesday.

To my international customers, shipping was quite a bit higher than I expected. The cheapest option was $13.50 USD. I will increase my shipping charges for future purchases, as I am losing money on these sales. I need to at least break even.

Maybe a coordinated group buy for Europe?

## \#32 Posted by: evoheyax Posted at: 2016-10-01T23:21:32.322Z Reads: 405

```
If you would like to do that, I would encourage that. The reason I am selling them like this is two reasons:
- To recover the costs of putting the app in the app store (donations take care of this)
- To make it easy to use, as the wiring is very specific. You could spend hours putting your first one together (as I did). I have the assembly time down to about 30 minutes per chip.

The other thing is you can't buy just one jst plug for a fair price, if at all. These parts are best if bought in bulk. I'm not sure if you can find these locally, as they are made by Adafruit Industries, which is an open-source hardware company based in New York City.

Maybe someone like @elkick could help distribute them in Europe? I could ship 15 of these for $13.50 to europe, or 1 for $13.50. It would make more sense in my mind to ship 15 for $13.50, that's less than $1 per module in shipping, and I'm sure shipping around europe from another european country would be far cheaper than me shipping to 1 european customer at a time.

We stated with 13, and now we are down to 6! If you want to get in the first batch, now is your chance!

These chips are produced In the United States in New York, assemble in San Francisco. These are high quality modules, they will not just fall apart like some of the cheap electronics we've all seen on this forum.

More app development is to come. It's very easy to use, and you'll finally be able to see what your vesc is doing, and build better, smarter electric skateboards.

Down to 4! maybe a few days at most before they are gone for the time being. One thing to remember, please please use the diagram on my website to connect to the right pins if using vesc 4.10, 4.11, or 4.12. Not sure what would happened if you installed it incorrectly and I don't want to find out. Best case in my mind, it would fry your BT chip. So just make sure you follow the directions so nothing blows up!

I would want to say it won't work, cause carbon fiber doesn't like signals. But it is a pretty strong signal from my experience. I've had it work in my housek 25 feet away through 2 walls. But if you can get a reciever to work, then you should be able to get signals from this. I don't see the point of an eboard if you can't communicate to it with a controller either via 2.4 ghz or bluetooth.

Ok - so if I understand the hardware is the same except the wires are soldered on? Just wondering if this hardware has any additional benefit since it's 3x the cost of HC 05 + wires.

So first off, this chip is not the hc 5, it is the adafruit chip. Cost to me buying in bulk is $15.75 per chip plu about a buck per plug, so almost  $17. I charge $34 with shipping the us. You will pay $23 from adafruit with shipping, so $11 more for the chip already soldered to a plug, heatshrinked, and ready to go. You also have my service and I have to pay for the app to go into the store. For $11, you don't have to compile the app, solder, and you have customer service.

The HC 05 to my understanding encapsulates data differently for transmission through bluetooth. This means you can't use an HC 05 with this particular app. I don't have an HC 05 sitting around to confirm this though, so if anyone who has one and wants to try it out, I would love to see your results.

Besides this, there's some other differences.

Adafruit manufacturers in New York in the US, while the HC 05 is unclear (and likely china).
Adafruit uses a 32 bit processor, while it's unclear what the HC 05 uses.
Adagruit runs on bluetooth 4 Low Energy, while again, no documentation states what version of bluetooth it uses (likely not 4 LE)

Now, this likely won't mean much of a difference for our application. But this particular app runs with the adafruit perfectly. I have purchased 16 chips so far, and everyone has worked flawlessly without issues. The code is written in objective-c, which is a language I do know (I don't know swift nor have the time to learn another language right now (already learning 2 new ones to put me up to 13 in total now), so modifying it and re-uses the base structure to make a new app won't be too hard.

[/quote]

Unfortunately, it's not that simple. you can't connect to this chip directly without going through software that can instantiate the connection. I tried today just to confirm this. It may be possible to write software to make the connection first, which allows the entire system to access it there in after including BLDC. But it's not a pairable chip. Going to search for it using any device with bluetooth (phone, desktop, laptop, tablet), will yield no results.

This all is really a beta program. Everyone whos ordered is helping the community determine what is really the best bluetooth system we can do. And everyone who orders ultimately gets an end to end system that is as simple as download, plug and play. It can't get any easier for the end user, and you will be able to use it to learn more about your electrical system, and make improvements if you can interrupt the data. That being said, it's possible the HC 05 or another chip will be better.

A lot really comes down to the software that's written behind these chips, because everything we could ever dream is possible with both of these chips. It's a lack of software that limits them more than anything.

All new orders have been shipped as of today!

International orders will take 1-3 weeks depending on customs. The postal workers said it's usually closer to 2 weeks. Unfortuantly, shipping costs of shipping out side the US is at least $13.50 USD, with out tracking. Tracking is another $13.95, so $27.50 for cheapest shipping plus tracking. I hope to arrange some way in the near future to make sales, especially inside Europe, quicker and cheaper shipping wise.

To my United States customers, some of you will be getting them tomorrow, Tuesday. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. And remember to reboot your vesc after you change from ppm to ppm+uart, or you will get frustrated (this is the mistake I first made with this chip. Make sure it really shuts down. I unplugged it and plugged it back in before it completely powered off, and it didn't really restart)

Due to the yellow coloring of the heatshrink, you should see a red slow blinking light when it turns on. When you connect via the app, a solid green light will come on (it's really blue, but blue+yellow heatshrink creates green :smiley:) next to the red light. If you run into any problems, don't hesitate to ask for help. I hope it's smooth and easy for everyone!

Just An update. I've finally found time to start developing the app more. My idea is first to start with a screen like this:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/6/d6ffeee8a84d8610a2d03cd806f020146fabe7ee.PNG" width="690" height="388">

This app screen displays everything properly, including speed based on the vescs rpm. This is my heads up display. If you want to do a particular test, this will tell you exactly what's happening in your vesc in live time, all on one screen. It's also saving data in the background which is written to a file and stored to generate graphs.

One of the improvements I've made here is that the mosfet temp is an average temp between the 6 mosfets. Each mosfet has it's own temperature sensor, so I now average them together instead of just picking one which may be less accurate.

My idea is this will be the main screen. There will be options to go to other screens also. One of the other screens will be to view the graphs. And hopefully in the future, a screen to allow you to change settings in your vesc (this one, I can't make any promises on, but I will do my best to make it happen).

So the changes are coming. I will be doing some more changes and I would like to do a settings page too so you non-US guys can enjoy the data in the metric system :P

id like everything graphed and overlaid!  I'm sure i've told you

there's really only one temp sensor on the vesc.  theres 6 outputs but supposedly it's all for the future and they all receive from one.  how they end up slightly different temps for the readout I dont know

Are you sure? I find is weird that you say there's only one when the vesc sends 7 (6 mosfet + 1 board) different temperature readings. Checking the values, the mosfet temps are all slightly different by .1 or .2. Not a huge difference, but they are not the same, and I don't see how it's physically possible to read different temps from 1 temp sensor...
```

## \#51 Posted by: elkick Posted at: 2016-10-06T17:11:33.031Z Reads: 305

All the temp readings will be implemented in VESC V6 properly, so it makes sense to already count on that also on V4 instead of rewriting that stuff later.

so i read.  maybe there's two sensors then, one for the board and the others for the fets.  as elkick says it was intended for later.  maybe now with v6 there's a sensor for each

hm... interesting. Sounds like V6 is really something different. Anyways, I'm working on a settings screen and graph screen.

For those using heatsinks like me, the temps shouldn't be very different anyways since the heatsink spreads the heat out. 

Either way, my code is ready for V6 then :P

haha, right now, that's the main reason for the settings screen.

From the link you posted @elkick "The code is prepared for more sensors. One for the PCB (CPU? DRV8302?), one for each mosfet, and one for the motor. "

I wounder how the vesc will get motor temp data, though for @hummies motors (and smaller motors in general), this would be amazing. Especially if you can limit the motor temp in the vesc settings like you can the mosfet temp.

In this code, I found a list of what data is available:

 // all the values in bldcMeasure:
    //
    //    float temp_mos1;
    //    float temp_mos2;
    //    float temp_mos3;
    //    float temp_mos4;
    //    float temp_mos5;
    //    float temp_mos6;
    //    float temp_pcb;
    //    float avgMotorCurrent;
    //    float avgInputCurrent;
    //    float dutyCycleNow;
    //    long rpm;
    //    float inpVoltage;
    //    float ampHours;
    //    float ampHoursCharged;
    //    float wattHours;
    //    float wattHoursCharged;
    //    long tachometer;
    //    long tachometerAbs;
    //    mc_fault_code fault_code;

I'm trying to find documentation on the mc_fault_code object. It's weird, cause I search for this, and can't find any where's that it's declared as a struct. Searching apple documentation, this is not a native objective c struct. But xcode tells me it's returning an unsigned int... I wish I could find out more about it so I could give the user more info than Fault Code: 5 for example.

i imagine the motor temp and the vesc fet temps would be similar or parallel each other.  otherwise hooking up another wire, maybe the temp sensor in the motor would be easy to install.

even one sensor for the 6 fets i imagine is probably good and they all parallel each other as well

It does seem like if you read that thread completely that there is only one temp sensor on the board between the uart port and the first fet. I just find it weird that my numbers are not exactly the same.

So my understanding before was that the data is shared via canbus, which it is. But I believe the data that's sent is actually for one vesc and not 2 (based on the values I have been seeing). But if you are doing a dual drive with 2 of the same motors and same settings, you can safely assume the other vesc is seeing very close to the same data. i.e one vesc is pulling 20 battery amps, the other should be seeing very close to 20 amps also. I'm researching and trying to figure out if there's a way to connect multiple of these BT chips to 1 iphone. App development is going, so it shouldn't be too much longer before I determine if it's physically possible or not.

So to switch graphs, press on the graph itself and hold until a menu pops up. Than you can switch graphs :P

for the second quesion:

Use Itunes, sync, go into your device's applications, then at the bottom
 you will find a document/files section, you can save the file to your 
system with that and delete it from the device

@makevoid wrote two programs to graph out the data from the file

one is a video program using SDL https://github.com/makevoid/vesc-logged-data-overlay1

another makes gif via imagemagick https://gist.github.com/makevoid/d68a4e95ba518cc84ed584afe2445f1d1

I might write another program myself if I deem it necessary.

Idk if this question is unrelated but I've been interested in something like this for a while (I can put my iphone in an armband and on my inner forearm), however I see that this uses the same connector port for the nunchuck receiver. In the case where dual VESCs are being used, can this be used on the slave vesc and report both vesc's info? or is this only a single vesc application?

I can make my android application public. It connects the phone and the VESC via WIFI. All you need is a Wemos mini D1 (needs to be programmed with a little script i will provide, but it is easy) and the 4 cables (GND, 5V, TX, RX) to connect it. It is pretty cheap and works very well. Advantage is also the baudrate of 115200 instead of 9600. And i have no interfearance with my receiver if somebody has concerns.

A nice little feature is that the drive gear is adjustable and the battery can be adjusted in 10% steps to get a good capacity %.

This only reports back info on 1 VESC unfortunately. But if you are using the same settings with the same motor, you can safely assume that the numbers the other VESC is seeing are very close. So in your case, you can run it on your Slave VESC. You just need to enable uart mode on your slave.

I'm working on designing the app to see if it's possible to connect multiple. But it's unclear to me yet if it's physically possible.

I thought about the fact that the nunchuck uses the uart port. However, from Thea testing I've done and others on the forum, it's a mixed bag of results with mostly bad e periwnces. There seem to be some outliars that just work with no issues. But the vast majority seem to have had drop out issues and that's the last thing you want on an eboard.

It's anyway no problem to use just one VESC for monitoring. Also in dual systems both VESCs need to be configured identically. It would also be easy to have a switch in the app to apply the consumption values x2 if used in a dual motor config.

For you and anyone living in eroupe, you should keep an eye out for late next week or early the week after. Unfortunately 1 week or less would have been over $60 in shipping and tracking would have been another $13.95. So to keep prices low, the Europe orders are sent with out tracking, with around 2 weeks of shipping time. Even then shipping is still $13.50. This is why I'm working with @elkick to hopefully provide a better price with tracking and shipping under a week.

Ok, just wanted to give an update everyone. We are offically sold out of blue tooth modules. We will be restocking in 1 to 2 weeks, pending the outcome of this beta. So far,those who have revived it seem to have everything working.

To those who have ordered: If it's not too much trouble to ask, please let me know when you get a chance to try it if everything's working. Every chip works on my vescs, but that's with one specific vesc. I want to confirm that given a random sample of vescs, there are no hidden bugs or issues.

Thank you everyone, and if you wish to order again, we will be restocking in 1-2 weeks pending the outcome of this beta. The new app should be ready by then also (it's almost ready now! But it takes about a week for the app store process)

Received mine, thanks @evoheyax!

First tests done, looks good. Tested it on FW 2.18, BLDC and FOC in single and dual setups on:
VESC 4.7 (Benjamin's own hand soldered version)
VESC 4.7 (Marcin from ES)
VESC 4.10 (esk8.de)
VESC 4.12 (esk8.de)

Everything works fine. 

For dual VESC setups: you will need to connect it to the master, it's tricky to get it working on the slave. 

Master needs to be on PPM & UART in the app tab, while UART needs to be set to 9600 baud. Don't forget to klick "reboot" after those changes were made!

I'll continue testing outside, but it's raining here now so I need to plug it into my eMTB first to go out! :slight_smile:

The 6pin connectors with the layout provided by @evoheyax works on both, but of course you need to make sure that the 6pin connector on 4.10 is plugged in the right way (meaning: leave the last pin on the 7pin socket close to the fet empty).

Dumb noob question. The RPMs we measure and set in our vesc seem really high. Is there an extra zero added? When using a speed calculater 40000 rpm gives a ridiculous speed while 4000 gives a speed that makes perfect sense. Am I missing something?

Also, I just did my morning ride and the graph shows a ton of flat with one tiny spike. Is there a way to reset all data, show data for individual trips? Does it reset every time i hit start/stop? 

Also interesting. I upped my battery max amps from 13 to 15 last night and my ride this morning says 15.91 max. 

Mos 1 temp is shown in celsius, correct?

Also, I am having trouble finding what are ideal/dangerous operating temperatures for the VESC. A link would be awesome. It seems now that I have all this data, I want to put it to use! Ive been debating wether or not to open an air intake for my Ollin vescs with heat sinks and with this chip I can actually determine if i need to or not. 

So far its pretty awesome being able to see whats going on!

The rpm is actually the erpm. To get the rpm, divide by 7.

[quote="Spek, post:98, topic:10422"]

It resets when you hit start if the connection has been lost and re-established since hitting stop. The best way to reset data from my experience is to double click the home button, and swipe the app up to close it. Then restart the app.  Not the most elegant, but it will work every time. It's best to hit start right before you start riding and stop right after to stop riding. Long breaks of not moving ruin average numbers and the graph.

I have experienced this same thing before the bluetooth modules, riding with the bldc running on a laptop. So it's a phenomena not linked to this data transmission system. It seems the vesc allows you to pull slightly more than your limit.

[quote="Spek, post:98, topic:10422"]

[quote="Spek, post:98, topic:10422"]
I am having trouble finding what are ideal/dangerous operating temperatures for the VESC
[/quote]

My vescs with hummies motors run at hottest 57C, and the default max is a good limiting point, which I believe is somewheres close to 100C. I've been told that limit can be pushed a bit higher, but I don't think it's good to be on the bleeding edge. I have run my vescs at the default max temp for over a month riding 30+ miles per week with the carvons (which hit that max temp pretty quickly due to the high kv and stays up there) with no ill effects.

It's hard to find info on this topic. I think you might want to find out the exact model number of the FET, and that will probably give you the exact max temps of the FETs. But also, be aware that theres only one temp sensor on v4 vescs, which is placed on the board between the uart port and the fets. Becuase it's not dirrectly on the fet, I have a feeling that it might read a temp slightly lower than the the real max temp at any point on any of the FETs. 

It's rumored that v6 will have 7 in total instead of 1, as the variables are already in the firmware, ready to be accessed. But maybe someone like @chaka can confirm or reject this.

What about a function to record the speed of your 0-20 acceleration? Essentially, the app knows when you go from 0 to .001 mph, and when you hit 20 mph. Just like your 0-60 acceleration on a car, it could be a tool to measure your 0-20 acceleration on an eboard. If everyone did this on a flat ground, you could have some insight into how fast you can make a board accelerate.

Yes, you need iOS 9.2 or higher though. I would research to see how 9.2 runs on older iphones if you want to use an older one.
[/quote]


iOS 9.2 isn't the only limitation. Your device must support BLE 4.0 or higher.[quote="evoheyax, post:21, topic:10422, full:true"]
Um... I'm not sure actually. I thought this question might be asked. I could try it and see if it's possible. I would say maybe you can split the signal... If possible, it sounds more like a custom job. But I will try to look into it if I can find the time.
[/quote]

You can not split a UART signal. Maybe you can use the whole UART to connect a Nunchuk and then just read the same RX for the app. But sending with both is not possible in my opinion. The VESC 6 with the on build NRF could be used to connect to a nunchuk while reading the data over the BT UART module.[quote="evoheyax, post:44, topic:10422"]
The HC 05 to my understanding encapsulates data differently for transmission through bluetooth. This means you can't use an HC 05 with this particular app. I don't have an HC 05 sitting around to confirm this though, so if anyone who has one and wants to try it out, I would love to see your results.

Besides this, there's some other differences.

Adafruit manufacturers in New York in the US, while the HC 05 is unclear (and likely china).Adafruit uses a 32 bit processor, while it's unclear what the HC 05 uses.Adagruit runs on bluetooth 4 Low Energy, while again, no documentation states what version of bluetooth it uses (likely not 4 LE)
[/quote]
HC 05 is produced in China using a CSR chip. This chip uses v2.0+EDR and is not Bluetooth 4.0 (LE) compatible so will not work for this App. Don't see why you are saying there are no infos about this specs.[quote="elkick, post:51, topic:10422, full:true"]
All the temp readings will be implemented in VESC V6 properly, so it makes sense to already count on that also on V4 instead of rewriting that stuff later.
[/quote]

From the schematics the VESC V6 has also not a temp sensor for every FET.

```
If you're running a single drive, and you're using a nunchuck, your only option is an integrated option inside of the nunchuck (see @jacobbloy's nunchuck project). If you're running dual, the can bus can handle writing the firmware of the other VESC (ie you connect your nunchuck to one vesc and the bluetooth module to the other), however no app that I'm aware of has this functionality built in (writing firmware to both master and slave over can-bus)

Edit: By no application, I meant no mobile (iOS, Android) application. BLDC Tool can already do this.

It's been a while, so I think it's time for an update.

I have ordered 15 more Adafruit UART buddy modules. I will restock inventory and make an announcement when they are back in stock.

The BIG NEWS though is in the app:

I had a major break through today with the graphs. I'm using a library called Core Plot. It's quite complicated to get setup, and the documentation is very detailed. There's no quick easy get up and running with it for live time data. I had to spend over 10 hours today and 5 hours yesterday researching, reading through detailed documentation, and coming up with the right code. Objective-C can be a frustrating language at times, as I run into a lot of the same issues that C can have. But none the less, graphs are working. I just need to beautify them. I plan to add code that saves the data from each graph every time you hit stop. Then, you will be able to browse through past recorded graphs and select which graphs you want to see, all in the same app. This library is very detailed, and should allow me to do some very convenient things not possible in the VESC Vision app.

I will add some other tools, like the 0-20 mph acceleration timer. If you have an ideas for other tools, I'm all ears. A lot of cool things can be done with this data. One of the graphs I want to add will have altitude change (i.e are you going up hills, down hills, or on flat) with speed and amp draw, all on the same graph, so you can see how hills for example affect your speed and amp draw.

Another full day of programming. Cleaned up a bunch of code to make it easier to keep building onto. I wanted to post the latest looks of the app. Currently, it is only graphing speed, but it will be graphing everything else tonight or tomorrow morning (the data structures are all there, just need to add a few more line of code).

In addition to the 0-20 acceleration timer, I'm planning on adding another exciting new feature: Video recording with overlays. Through the app, you will be able to record video from your iphone with graphs overlayed on the video. This means making graphical overlays will be way too easy for all of us (I hope we see more videos from this).

ALSO: More BT Modules have arrived. I will start assembly tomorrow, and restock the inventory. So if you missed the first batch, keep an eye out for an update tomorrow, as they will be for sale again.

Here's a sneak peak of the progress: (P.S. the green dot is to start/stop recording. it turns red when recording, green when it's not but ready to be started)

Looking great and I like the video overlay feature! Sounds like you're making good progress. Also saving rides individually is perect. Could you also implement an odometer? I'd love to keep a running total of miles on the board (maybe a setting to save board presets if you own more than one). It's sounding more like an app that I'd be happy to pay for. Thanks for the updates

Looking good! Is there a legend for which color means what? Maybe label the axis too with the units they represent? 

Quick question. Does the app only run when the phone is unlocked? I keep finding that it never records a whole ride for me. Just now I made sure to keep the board turned on until I checked the phone. Once the phone was unlocked it reset my data upon reconnecting to the Bluetooth. I never had this issue with apps for my bike since it was handlebar mounted and I set it to not turn off. No handlebars on a skateboard so I toss it in my pocket

The legend was the next step actually in my mind. I need to make some tweaks to the graph still but the idea and most of the code is there. I will try to come up with a way to label the y axis. I'll probably make a legend just for the y axis.

Biased on tests I just conducted, the app does not seem to run in while the phone screen is off. I will look into it, and It shouldn't be too hard of a fix. I'll put that on my todo list.

Fixed the problem with it not tracking data when the phone is turned off. Thank you for finding this bug. These are the kinds of bugs I don't always catch, which is what I needed you all as beta testers to help me find.

The unfortunate thing is I have to go through the approval process again, but you should get a notification of an update for the VESC Vision not too long in the near future.

The new app won't have this issue, as I already fixed it and tested this today to confirm I had the right fix.

I'm glad to have heard no problems thus far with any of the BT modules. These seem very consistent on the high quality of the chips.

I want to encourage my European customers to let me know when you get your orders if you can. I want to make sure all of you get them ok, and since I don't get tracking (without another $13.95 ontop of the $13.50 shipping), it's hard for me to confirm is was at least delivered. If you don't want to post, even a pm would help me to confirm my shipping method is reliable. All first batch Europe orders should have already arrived, or be arriving any day now.

Second batch orders, will be shipped in around 14 hours (sorry, been a long day of classes). If you want to get into tomorrows shipment, now be be a great time to order!

I will likely add the new app this weekend, with some features, and the addons will come in time. I'm excited for everyone to try out the new graphs and session tracking.

Glad to hear you got it. Clear heatshrink is on my todo list for the 3rd batch. I used yellow for most of the chips, which the lights go through quite well. But I'm out of yellow heatshrink, so I'm using what I have to work with, which is red or blue. Unfortunately, it's hard to find these types of things in the US, and I often find the easiest way is to order from china. But it takes weeks to get anything from china, so it will be a few weeks before I can get clear heatshrink.

I've read it before but vedder's page about vesc/uart feels like the place to start, he has descriptions of the interfaces. Could have saved the last 30mins if I checked this first.

I just wanted to give everyone an update as to where the app stands...

Settings now include settings for different builds. You will be able to track up to 4 boards independently. The code has been further cleaned up. I have been debating how to do the main page. I want to have a setting that allows you to go from numeric to visual. In order to do visual, I need to get the vesc setting data. So I've been researching how to get the settings from a vesc, and that can be done through sending the COMM_GET_MCCONF command to the vesc. It's a bit harder than that, as I have to interpret bytes of data in hexidecimal and write some new code to handle this and turn it into.

But I will be uploading after I add the ride history tab. Unfortunately, I have been busy with mid terms and mid term projects. But those are winding down after tomorrow, so I should be able to finish it this weekend at the latest. I've been debating on the level of detail in the first version, and it will be more than I first thought. More to come in the following days :stuck_out_tongue:

Yea, sorry for the lack of updates. I've been pouring a lot of time into it, but I'm getting ready for another round of mid terms next week.

Keep updates:

You can now save rides and pull them back up, all in the same app. I've been working on getting push notifications working. I want to do push notifications for when your battery is fully charged,and when you hit 50% battery and 20% battery, so you know where your battery without even taking the phone out of your pocket (as you'll hear the ding and hopefully, feel the vibration. It will be able to replace the need of a battery meter.

Other news, there's now an electronic battery meter in the app, that gives you percentage left along with a bar.

Once push notifications are done, I need to tweak the main page to fit some more data I record but don't display. Then, I'll add a few things to the graph that are missing and add the acceleration timer, and call it v1 :P I wish I could give a time line, but apple makes certain things (like push notifications) way more complicated then they should be in my opinion.

I want to keep the updates going, so here it is:

- Graphs have been updated so there's y lines and the y axis is not lost when scrolling.
- The main page is getting a massive graphical overhual. The original one was designed for the iphone 6 specifically and had no real organization. The new one will have more organization and data, and should work any any ios device, from the iphone 4s to the jumbo size ipads.
- Live time data is displayed without recording. But recording while save the data, graph the data, and calculate avg and max's for every value. This is for two reasons. You might want to see where your battery is for example without having to hit record, and for other tools like the acceleration timer, I need certain data in my custom built data structure, even when it's not recording. I think this is all around better,

More is to come. I really hope I can finish this off and submit this weekend, but I don't want to rush it, as a lot of people take first impressions seriously, and I don't want people to look at what it is now, and think it will be this way forever. Active updates will keep going, long after the first version. But I want a really solid feeling first version too. So soon enough. I have been thoroughly testing it in the real world, and seeing where certain things need to be changed to make it more practical (like not having to hit record to see where your battery is)

Sorry man. It might be some time before I can get the android version done. My main focus was and still is the Apple version. I can't give a time frame for when I could finish the android version. That's not to say I don't want to work on it, but my focus will be on getting a feature rich Apple version first.

On a good note, the new home page formatting with more data is done for now. I will work on the style, but in terms of recording, saving, and pulling the new data back up, everything's good. Since I killed the big speedometer on the home page to fit more data in, I will be making a separate speedometer in the tools section. I hope to knock out the speedometer and acceleration timer today, which would mean I just need to do the final touches and submit.

- Switch between US and Metric systems
- Push notifications for 20%, 50%, and 100% of battery status
- Acceleration Timer
- Speedometer
- Live time display of 18 data points, including time, distance, speed, battery amps, motor amps, and more
- Graphing with Battery Voltage, Battery Amps, Motor Amps, FET Temp, and Speed
- Record vesc data into a "session" and pull up past "sessions" in the ride history tab
- You can view current vesc data without recording a session
- Battery meter with percentage

More features are to come, including video overlays! If anyone has ideas of features they would like, please, suggest it. I will add more data in the future also, including Ah used in a given session, and any other data you would like. I also will be researching and working on modifying vesc settings. I hope to eventually create modes, along with being able to modify basic vesc settings. So yea, a lot more to come!

If you don't have a bluetooth module, now's a good time to grab one from [Rocket Boards](http://www.rocketboards.club/)!

Hey,

You said you can keep settings for up to four boards. What settings exactly?
```

## \#151 Posted by: evoheyax Posted at: 2016-11-19T05:04:32.978Z Reads: 177

```
Wheel diameter and voltage (i.e 6s, 7s, 8s, 9s, 10s, 11s, or 12s).

The wheel diameter is used for calculating speed and distance.

The voltage is used to determine the battery percentage for the battery meter and for battery status (at 20%, 50% and 100%) push notifications.

Also, when you record a session and you go to the "Ride History" panel, you can will see there which board the data pertains to. To change your current board, simply switch the board in the settings with one click, so all of these features listed above in this message work correctly.

```

---
## \#153 Posted by: evoheyax Posted at: 2016-11-19T05:19:04.460Z Reads: 175

```
Linear...

My formula is this:

4.2 per cell is full charge, 3.2 is empty.

voltageNow = your current voltage
minBatteryVoltage = what your batteries voltage would be if it's empty
batteryVoltageRange = the max voltage of your battery pack minus the min voltage of your battery pack

so your current battery percentage = ((voltageNow - minBatteryVoltage)/batteryVoltageRange)*100

for example:

a 12s battery would be:
voltageNow = lets say your at 45 volts
minBatteryVoltage = for a 12s, this is 3.2 x 12, which is 38.4
batteryVoltageRange = since the max voltage is 50.4 and the min voltage is 38.4, 50.4 - 38.4 = a 12 volt range

((45 - 38.4)/12)*100 = 55%

It's not perfect, since batteries don't discharge linearly, but besides the first 2 volts and the last volt or 2 (which both drop off quickly), they discharge pretty linearly. I've done plenty of real world testing to confirm that this is mostly accurate, and definitely useful.

Yeah I have the same formula pretty much haha. Yeah honestly it's not a big deal. You know, I actually think that my new hardware platform could house all of the functionality you need for your app and controller. The cost of my hardware comes out to be cheaper than yours, but I do need a lot more labor to put it together. Maybe we could help each other out?

For everyone, the app has been submit and is awaiting review. Heres another screen shot for everyone :stuck_out_tongue:

All donations will go directly back into the app. I don't want this to ever slip out of the out of the app store due to apples developer fee. I release the apps for free, as I want this tool in as many hands as possible, and I don't want devices to be an issue either.

Not yet. I'm debating how to release the code. Since I use push notifications, you would need to modify quite a bit to build it on your own (and go through your own certification and provisioning process, which will take a few hours if you know what your doing, likely more). There's also my push notification app id in the code, which I would likely just remove so no one else abuses it, but you would need to set up an account with the push notification service provider I use, and go through their process also. 

Basically, what I'm saying, is I don't know how much the community would benefit from the source code sue to some complexities and the fact that I'm still developing this further with whatever features the community at large want. No one needs to modify it, as I'll do that for you, haha. Just post away your desired features and I'll see what I can do to implement them.

Your app id secret can easily be removed from the code. Just keep it in the separate file outside git repo. Sorry but this can not be accepted as an excuse.

The community would benefit a lot from the source code. We can find bugs in the code and send patches. I'm sure VESC firmware source code is much more complex but people still can understand it and contribute. Think about how it all started - you just took opensource app and released it on the App Store. Now you did a few changes but instead of updating existing app and pushing the code back to github you release another app instead without sharing. This doesn't really go well together with openness and accepting donations from the community.

A simple option is to store the password in a separate file, ignored by github. The application would then load from that file. This way, you can release from your current directory, but without pushing sensitive data to github.

As an aside, I'm interested in developing this for the android myself. Perhaps there's a cross-platform option out there (e.g., Xamarin).

If you think this is the case,  I'm more than happy to push it to github.

[quote="rmrf, post:161, topic:10422"]
Now you did a few changes
[/quote]

I don't want to argue about it, because I'm fine with posting it on github. But I rebuilt the code from the bluetooth communication up. The only code that's reused is the bluetooth communication code. Basically, I wrote 90-95% of the code if you were to count lines.

There was no structure for the vesc data, so I built a data structure with more than double the data of the original app.

There was one view with everything in it. I threw out all of the GUI code, and started from scratch. I created 6 new views so that the GUI is organized and not all over the place in 1 file.

So honestly, I didn't just add some code to an app someone else made, I developed it from the from the bluetooth code on up.

You can view the code now here: https://github.com/evoheyax/Vesc-Status

If someone wants to convert it java so it can work on android devices, please do. I will be doing more research into it and will try these convertor tools. I'm doubtful they will work right, but we will see.

Thanks for the help. If anyone would like towork with me to add a new tool, it's really quite simple to add new tools.

I can write a tutorial on how to add a new tool. But you literally create a new view, with a few extra lines of code to import the data structure header file, and you need to create an init with frame and the data structure function instead of just the frame, and you'll have all of the vesc data at your tools finger tips. 

Then in the main ViewController.h, just import the header file for the new view, add the @class declaration.

In the ViewController.m file, add the the view by copying and pasting the code from one of the other views. You need to copy and paste and modify the function that pulls up the view. I will look into making this easier in the future to add. but after that, your ready.

License file created. Thanks for your help. I want this to be here for the community. I've said this before and I'll say this again: This work is not charity work, but it's also not about profiting. I am looking to cover my costs for having the license to publish to the app store and some little bit for my time would be nice. I have committed over 100 hours to this project so far (a lot of it was remember Objective-C, since it's been a few years, and learning the Bluetooth codes' structure). With that being said, I'm not charging for the app, nor am I against keeping this open source. This is a tool much needed by the community, and doing anything that keeps anyone from using it is not in the best interest of the community.

Donations are greatly appreciated if you can afford it, but I hate companies (like adobe) that restrict their software for basically rich people by charging an arm and a leg. I think giving users the option is the best, so that people like me who are in college (or even those in high school or that don't have the best of jobs) can still use this software :)

I just wanted to say thank you to everyone for the donations. The amount of support is overwhelming and I can't wait to add even more features and updates to this app.

Also, I haven't tested this app on any other devices besides the iphone 6 in real life devices. The 6s, 7, and 7s should have zero issues, since they are more or less the same (what's most important is the IOS version). I'm a little bit more concerned about the 4s, as it causes the 4s simulator to crash, and I had issues pushing it to hummies iphone 4s (certification and licensing crap, not related to the app), and it will be easier with it in the store to test on the 4s (as it removes the certification and licensing that I have to deal with. I really hope there's no issues, but if there is at first, I will fix any problems and update it :) My goal is 4s through the latest gens :P

So I just found the problem... None of the orientations were marked under the apps settings. It's frustrating to say the least, because it was marked the last time I tried the app 10 minutes for uploading...

But none the less, it's an easy fix and I tested it with the iphone 5s simulator and got this:

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/4/d4721a933858f79544764267417a0d5f788258c2.png" width="690" height="404">

I will be checking all from the 5 to the 7, plus and regular sizes. It seems the 4s simulator has been discontinued, so I can't test it on a 4s phone. The screen size is the same though as the 5, so should work.

Yea, the issue is it needs to load in lanscape mode or it loads the graphics wrong. You might be able to force it to load landscape by locking your phone to landscape mode (on that screen where you have the flashlight option), maybe...

If not, this update will force it to load in landscape when apple approves it.

Another update for November 23rd:

- v1.1 of the Vesc Status will (hopefully) be approved today, which will fix the graphics glitch.
- v1.2 though is right around the corner with an amazing new feature: video overlays :P I put in over 12 hours of research to build my own video recording class. It's simple, and exactly what we would want while riding on a board (auto focus, auto white balancing, and auto exposure). The video recording is now working, I just need to figure out how I will get the data on each frame it's recording. I've seen a lot of information about this out there, so I suspect I should be able to get that working later today.

Check back soon for more updates. I am looking into linking this data with the cloud some how so you can share graph data (as was suggested a while back), which will be one of the next steps after video overlays are complete :)

Sorry to anyone I incovienaced. I can add a setting to turn notifications off if they bother you. Unfortunately, it's hard to not catch someone while they are sleeping, as when I sent it, it was the middle of the day for some. But I'll add a setting so you  (and anyone else who don't like them) don't get annoyed.

Are you sure @Bender it's not saving to when you chose the US? After you change it in the settings, for it to change on the main screen and graphs screen, you have to press record.

If it still doesn't work, do any of your other settings save? If there's a bug here, I need to squash it, because it saves just fine for me...

If you press US and then close settings and then open settings again, metric is chosen?

The App looks good. Haven't tried to connect to my VESC, but I will try soon.
Would be cool if you will enable to rotate the device by 180 degrees. So that it also works in landscape but with the home button on the right.
To the US and Metric thing. For me there stands mm for both settings. Also if I want to change the wheel diameter the keyboard pops up, but it isn't possible to close it. Return does nothing, touching on the background does nothing and even closing the settings doesn't close the keyboard. Just restarting the app helps on a iPhone 5.

You should have that little button in the lower far right corner that closes the keyboard.

Wheel diameter is always in mm, regardless of wether you are in metric or US. This is because mm is the standard for wheel diameters in the skateboarding world. The only wheels not measured in mm are those off-road tires, as they aren't skateboard wheels, we just make them skateboard wheels, haha.

If anyone finds anything the graphics wise is off, please post it so I can fix it. Other wise, I will assume there's.no graphics issues.

I have the same issue on 5s no button to remove the keyboard 

I have it set for US and it has (F) next to the temps and Mph for speed but I'm pretty sure they are still the metric values

one other little thing, does anyone else have a little trouble starting and stopping the record?
I can get it to work but it takes a few tries

## \#203 Posted by: evoheyax Posted at: 2016-11-25T18:09:00.480Z Reads: 159

What makes you think they are metric values?

Basically, I calculate everything in the US system, and I have this:

if(we want metric system) {
Convert temps and speed to metric
Convert labels to metric
}

If the labels are saying F and MPH, then it should be impossible to get metric system numbers, as those 2 are done together.

EDIT: I think I found a bug... The temp numbers coming from the vesc I would imagine would be metric, since vedder is in Europe. But I interpret them to be in the US. So I will fix this in the next update. This means if you select metric, the number is converted to metric while being metric, which is wrong. So... For the time being, if your using the US system, the temp is in metric. If your using the the metric system, ignore them all together, as they are super wrong.

We will have a new update ready for download within the next week to:
 
- Address this temp issue.
- Allow you to flip orientation
- Come up with a solution for the keyboard not always having the option to close
- Add option to turn off notifications
- We'll see if I can make the record button a bit easier to press. The issue is the size makes it tricky to press.
- And hopefully, add the video overlays

I will be spending a large portion of the day today working on getting the video overlay working. I'm getting closer.

No, not saying that at all. If you don't have the ability to close the keyboard, that's an issue that must be addressed. What I was saying is that in all the testing I did, that was always the case, and I assumed it always would be the case. But since it's not, I will come up with another solution. See my post above about bugs and updates that are on my to-do list.

An update to all of my followers:

I have been slaving away today like a zombie, and I have the graphical overlay working perfectly!
Now, I need to add the numerical data to the video, and then video overlays will be complete.

I have order a 3-axis gimble and some lens so I can film high quality video with graphical and numerical overlays!

I expect to finish this tonight of tomorrow, and I will post a non-stabilized video with exactly what you'll see and experience, and a new update should be submitted by monday that will fix the rest of the bugs, and add the video overlay feature :P

Video overlays are functionally working. A few minor tweaks need to be made to ensure no sizing issues with all sized iphones, other than the iphone 6.

But here's a bench test video. More video coming this Tuesday!

Just an update as to where we are:

- Allow you to flip orientation
- Come up with a solution for the keyboard not always having the option to close
- [DONE] Add option to turn off notifications
- [DONE] We'll see if I can make the record button a bit easier to press. The issue is the size makes it tricky to press.
- [DONE] And hopefully, add the video overlays

I've added some other graphics to help smooth out the user interactions. You'll notice a bit more fluid feeling of an app now.

Graphs also automatically scroll as it records now. And automatically goes back to 0 when you start a new recording.

I'll finish up the last 2 in the morning and upload Saturday. So hopefully, v1.3 will be ready for download by Wednesday at the latest :P

@faust Thanks for the offer, but yes, I need an android phone with bluetooth LE, and preferably, on the newer side of things.

An update for everyone: Vesc Status v1.2 has been submitted. Hopefully, Apple can get to it Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest (based on current wait times from third party tracking websites).

This update addresses all of the issues listed above, added some fluidity with HUD status messages, graphs now scroll automatically, and most importantly, video overlays are in this new version. Simply go to the tools, and click "Open Video Overlays" to record videos with graphical and numerical overlays of exactly what's going on in your vesc while riding. You need no technical knowledge, or computer skills, or extra programs. Just hit record and it will do all of the work. Once done recording, videos are exported to your photo album where you can upload, send via airdrop, and more with just the click of a button (or two :D ).

EDIT: Just wanted to add that I also just pushed the latest updates to [GitHub](https://github.com/evoheyax/Vesc-Status). Enjoy!

This update will have the following:

- Record button is larger
- HUD displays status information
- Notifications can be turned off and on
- Temperature bug fixed
- Keyboard can easily be closed now
- Video overlays can be recorded in app
- Added gear ratios for speed calculations

All remaining orders have been shipped! We are starting to run low on inventory again, and we have 4 left ready to go. More JST-6 plugs are on the way, and should arrive in a week or so.

This project is here for the community. And it would be impossible for me to do without the community. Due to the bluetooth connection, I can not test this app using the iphone simulator. This means, I need real devices to test it on. And this is why I need the community. I only have an iphone 6, so I guarantee 100% no issues on an iphone 6 with this latest version. The target is the iphone 5 through the 7. Ipad should also work, but I will need to fix some of the graphics to make better use of the lager screen.

So please, if there's any bugs, or anything off or you see room for improvement, please don't hesitate to mention it. I'm very open to ideas and suggestions, and will continue to work hard to make this the best app possible.

Fortunately and unfortunately, I found 3 bugs today while riding. One which caused the graphs scrolling to stop working after you record once, and the other 2 were minor graphics things that give a more fluent experience. I am re-uploading this update again for (hopefully) the last time. I haven't had a chance to real world test the recent app updates until today, which is why I found these bugs. Sorry to put it off another day, I know everyone is waiting, but this should be the last time.

Would be sad if that would be the last update. Tested it for the first time on a iPhone 5 today in the real world connected to a VESC. There are a lot of points for improvements in my eyes.
First thing the HUD recording. Very great idea and it is working for very short test movies.
-But it was only possible to record shorter then 40 seconds. Longer records aren't saved. Also shorter records didn't save all the time. Maybe 50% of them.
-there is no sound in the video
-the temperature in °C is wrong (haven't tested °F / it showed something around 0 °C instead of the measured value from bldc tool of 25°C)
-the speed is wrong when using a motor with a different number of poles (haven't tested if it is working correct for my SK6374, but my bike hub speed is definitely wrong/over 100kph so not shown/using a smaller diameter of the wheel helps, but would be nice to have the opportunity to change the poles in the app)
-there is a bug with the distance as you can see in my picture
-the update rate is very low. I think it should be possible to increase it (as an example using a baud of 115200 then 9600)
-a scaling of the y-axis would be cool to (so that maybe the negative values can also be shown and future bikes with currents over 80A with VESC6.0 can be displayed)
-in the ride history the battery status is always 0.0 volts and 0.0%
-the battery % is calculated just over the cell voltage. (would be cool, to type in the mAh data from the battery and then use the exact calculated used mAh data from the VESC to calculate that/ or at least that the user can change to "empty voltage" of his battery himself and not a static value is used for that)

Hope you see that points all as a constructive criticism and not as something negative.:slight_smile: Just want to help testing because you asked for it.

Thank you so much for your feedback. And everyone else. You are the reason this app will become the best vesc Bluetooth app.

The poles issue, I thought about the poles issue. I will be updating that in the near future.

Also, don't think this will be the last update. This won't be by a long shot.

I will look into the savory recording. Could you give me more details? I do set the max recording length but it is set to 1 hour and as seen in the video I posted a few days ago, I was able to record for longer than 40 seconds.

It also should be recording sound. I will be looking into that also, as it also records audio for me (and I specifically add the audio device. Maybe I should give an error in case the audio device is not found . It's a bug I want to debug but may need your help, as I don't have an iPhone 5, only 4s and 6.

I will do my best to fix all of the points you brought, as I agree with all of them.

More will be to come (though I wont be able to work on this for the next 8 days as I have finals beginning Wednesday), and thank you to everyone. I hope you enjoy the features that are working flawlessly.

To address your specific points it would helpful to gather some data from you if that's ok.

When you say records, do you mean records of ride data or the video recording? I'm trying to pin point where the problem could be, as I don't have that issue with me. One thing I have found is if the vibrations are too high, the chip can disconnect from the jst port failing momentarily. It would be more ideal to solder the connection to prevent this, but my person belief is if it's failing due to vibrations, then that really should be addressed. I have had this happen to me, so I will be addressing his in my boards.

I will double check, but I believe that number is coming straight from the vesc, so I'm confused as to why that would be wrong (unless I convert it to f then back to c, which I might be doing). Either way, I'll look into it.

If any one else has any recommendations to add on, please do. Everyone can help  shape this this app.

I mean video recording. The recording of the ride data was possible longer than 40 seconds. I tested 3 minutes without a problem. I think that this will also work for an hour. But there was no time to test that.

I am not 100% sure, but I think that the temperature in °F was correct. An other thing I noticed. When changing from °C to °F after the ride (so within the already recorded data) the °C values are displayed, but labeled as °F.


An other note. Would be cool if the graph will jump back to the 0s beginning of recorded ride data when opening an other recorded write. Because now when I scroll the 3 minutes ride to the end of the displayed graph and then change to a 10s recording I must swipe all the 180 seconds back to see some data.

Just wanted to give everyone an update: I have not forgotten about this project. I had been busy with finals the last 2 weeks, but since those are over now, it's time to get back to this app.

Features to expect:

- [s]Fix the Celsius bug. Formula I'm using is doing integer division. I'll cast to floats and do float division, which should fix the problem.[/s]
- GPS data will be integrated. Into a display and video overlays.
- [s]Graphs will auto resize in the y direction based on the highest value.[/s]
- [s]Add poles into settings so speed and distance data can be recorded for any motor, not just 14 pole motors.[/s]
- [s]Fix temperature typo[/s]
- [s]Save units with recordings so the labels of the graphs you look at again later have the correct unit label[/s]
- Fix distance bug. It happens when your motor is already spinning when you start recording. Likely something stupid like I'm not initialing the value to 0 or something.
- Fix deleting bug. For some reason, if you try to delete a bunch of rides from your history, it will eventually stop showing the delete button
- Improvements to the video overlays. They are not ideal IMO just yet, but the point is there
- Output the following errors:
[s]No Video Device found[/s]
[s]No Audio Device found[/s]
[s]Not enough space left to save[/s]
Eventually, Not enough resources to record without lag. It does use a lot of the iphone's ram, processor, and gpu to record videos, especially doing live rendering and inserting of graphs, trip data, and vesc data into each frame of the video.
- [s]Show fault codes on main screen[/s]
- Show fault codes on graph
- [s]Record watt hour data, including average Wh drawn and Wh per km or Wh per mile (depending on your settings)[/s]
- Overall: more robustness. Since I'm now using SVProgressHUD, I can push errors more easily. For example, it won't save a video if you don't have enough space left on your phone. Currently, it just won't save. But I will add an error message. This will hopefully help to sort through any remaining bugs. Again, it's hard for me to test on all devices because I can't simulate a BT LE device using the iphone/ipad simulator. So I need an actual device.
- Add server functionality so you can get all data including recorded rides on your computer, and share data with more ease
- Show Duty Cycle
- Modify at least basic vesc settings to start with. This is long overdue, and a major goal of this app.
- Calculate battery percentage in a more accurate way

All items will be crossed out as they are completed so everyone can see the progress of this development.

Any more ideas, please through them in here. I'd love to see some videos if anyone's had a chance to make some :P

*** Please note: Rocket Boards will be on holiday from the 20th till the 28th. All orders placed by Monday the 19th at 2 pm Pacific Time will ship Monday the 19th. All orders placed during this break will ship the 29th of December. ***

There is no such thing as average Watt hours. You could do total Watt hours spent though! 

Watt hours = integral(P * dt)
Average Watt Hours = integral(P * dt)/t??? = average power...

Just wanted everyone to be clear as to what I meant. I might use the wrong terminology sometimes, so feel free to point it out!

In terms of this update, I am hoping to have some form of an update in the first week of the new year. Likely won't have gps data quite yet (that will take more time, but I do want this done before the Spring semester starts the end of January).

@evoheyax  I read this thread a few days ago and finally installed and made some first steps using your app at this very moment. What should I say, it simply works. That's how it should be - great, excellent work. Can't wait for better weather conditions to try how it works on the road.

There are two things I was not able to figure out - maybe you can give a short comment on that. Did I remember right, that the temperature needs some finetuning when the metric system is used? Is there a possibility to download the rides-files for further analysis on the computer? I can't find the VESC Status App in iTunes to get them downloaded (only the older version VESC Logger and the log files).

Unfortunatly, at this time, it's not logging data to a file in that sense, I have my own logging file structure (not using JSON) for readback to the app. I am working on a better way of getting the data out. I plan to extend this to a website, so you can easily access your data through our servers, and export data without even needing to connect your phone. A lot more is to come in the very near future.

Would be great! I'm thinking of the following. When the log-files include in addition the actual values also the set-point values from the input device I could run some system identification analysis to detect the "best" PID-Parameters for cruise control. Since they depend also on the weight of the driver, real-time values would be great to serve as a solid data base.

Hey @evoheyax I'm having trouble connecting to your app.  I have the bluetooth module installed and enabled "PPM and UART" on my VESC.  Successfully connected to my iPhone over Bluetooth.  However your app just says "Scanning...."

Hey I'm sorry your having issues. I will PM you now as it's a holiday here in the USA Today and I'm quite busy. But I need some more info about your setup. It's possible you have a problem with your uart port on your vesc.

I do test all modules multiple times and double check all soldering work for joint strength. I will walk you through in the morning some steps that should diagnose your problem.

I'm assuming the later, as you said the vesc connect app worked (which is the app Jacob wrote). My app only works with the adafruit chip, which does not work with Jacobs app or any of the other apps unfortunately.

So of the three VESC iPhone apps, each uses a separate BT chip, none of which work with the others... 


Thanks anyway! Good luck with the app

I chose this module mostly due to having the BT code already written (which may have taken me a very long time to write otherwise) and it's American made.

The HC chips are cheaper, which is likely why Jacob choose them, and the last guy just wanted to profit off everything, so he locked a HC-10 chip to work only with his app. It's unfortunate, but of everyone else, I'm the only open source app.

I was able to build my app because the app originally was open source. While I re-did most of the code, I did use the bluetooth communication code, that I might not have been able to write on my own.

Ackmaniac was able to write his awesome firmware because vedder open sourced his code. Consumers do benefit from open source...

I do not have a link yet. Currently i am working locally on a prototype. When i have finished it i will host it and create thread about it. In this thread i will explain a bit of the functionality, create a todo/feature request list and ask for improvements/ideas.

One point for the todo list is the support of different log files. Currently i am just supporting the format of @Ackmaniac logfiles. 
Either you will adapt his format or wait until i am supporting your format too.

First off, I just want to say thank you everyone whose supported the development of this app! I could not have gotten this far without every one of you!

The progress of this app, while behind the development schedule I was planning, is coming along nicely. The updates that are ready include the following:

- Fixed the Celsius bug.
- Graphs auto resize in the y direction based on the highest value. This means no more cutoff graphs.
- Added poles into settings so speed and distance data can be recorded for any motor, not just 14 pole motors.
- Fixed temperature typo
- Now saves units with recordings so the labels of the graphs you look at again later have the correct unit label
- Added the following errors:
No Video Device found
No Audio Device found
Not enough space left to save
- Display fault codes on the main screen
- Records watt hour data, including average Wh drawn and Wh per km or Wh per mile (depending on your settings)
- Duty cycle is now displayed on the main screen

All tests on the bench show no bugs. However, it's impossible for me to test in the real world, since we are expected to have another week of rain here in San Francisco. Thus, I can't promise the Watt Hour data is perfect (though, it should be).

I will be uploading and submitting for review the update tonight, so we are 3-7 days for this update be available for download!

I've been on the fence about the use of this. But today for the first time since working on this app, I had a failure on my board. Power switch went out. However, I can confirm that everything else seemed good with the app though (which was the point of this ride. A few graphical issues with need to be worked through, but you can see the error displays properly the problem, and was quite useful in debugging the situation quickly.

Just an update for everyone: The website is coming along nicely. In the process of adding the login through the app. Just need to store the account data locally so it can be used to verify your identity when the app syncs with my server (already have the login code and check done). Hopefully by later today, I'll have my first ride data being sent to my servers, and an update sometime next week to add the syncing ability. You won't really be able to do much with the data at first, but updates to the site are instantaneous, so unlike the app, you won't have to wait for updates to the site after I finish a block of code.

@Bender I'll see what I can do. I'm sure you can see that I'm kinda running out of space on the main app page, lol. But I'll find a way to squeeze more data, including the erpm. For the formula, I use this:

        float rpm = (int) (*erpm/polesHalved);
        float rpm = rpm*gearRatio;
        float diameter = [self mmToFeet: &wheelDiameter];
        
        float speed = (diameter*3.14*rpm*60)/5280;

So I would work my way back up if I were you. polesHalved is the number of poles your using divided by 2. So for 14 pole motors, polesHalved is 7. Also, diameter needs to be in feet for my formula, so on that last line, it's in diameter.

So start by converting the diameter of your wheel from mm to feet. 
Then solve 5280/diameter*3.14*60 = rpm to get your rpm.
Then do erpm = (rpm/gearRatio)*polesHalved.

Sorry, it might seem like a lot. But that's you best bet. You could also use the other app that I didn't write but uploaded, as that has erpm data too. Just remember once the BT chip connects to one app, it can't connect to the other app unless you force close the open app. It can only connect to one app at a time.

The main purpose is to sync data between your phone and computer without the need to connecting to iTunes and that whole process. When a user records a ride, it will automatically send the ride data to my server. From there, users can pull up the data and access different graphs. User's will also be able to export data to different formats, so it can be used with tools like the one your working on. If a user has no internet connection at that time, they can sync the rides later in the app so they are accessible online.

Bear in mind, everything is still saved locally and can be accessed locally as well. The website just another dimension to the app.

Once the data is on a server, there's a lot more that can be done with it. Sharing the graphs and data will be easier, along with making interactive graphs. The possibilities are endless. :wink:

It's mostly about adding features at this point. The base system is fully functional.

Just wanted to give an update to everyone!

Dorry for the long break in updates, it's been a crazy semester for me. Good news though, doesn't look like I'm going to have an internship this summer, so I will be updating the app quite a bit.

Goals so far include:
- Saving rides to server
- With this new data, new graphs will be available on the website vescstatus.com.
- Data will be exportable through the webbsite for use with 3rd party apps
- New battery status feature. The goal will be to have you discharge your battery pack once (at a constant current) so the app can learn the exact discharge curve of your battery. This will allow near perfect accuracy for battery percentage, an unprecedented feature for the electric skateboarding community.
- Cleaning up and adding more data to the video overlays.

Stretch goals that may happen this summer / may not happen until I take Computer Architecture and Operating Systems this Fall Semester (will teach me to understand how to code at the lowest level, which is assembly and circutry):
- Modify settings through app
- Share data between vescs through canbus so you can actually see whats happening in all of your motors through one app/chip (likely will require modifying firmware)

Any more ideas you guys would like, let me know.
```

After a long day of coding, I have finished the server/local syncing feature. A new app update has been submitted. However, I still need to develop the website and do stuff with this data.

What will now happen after the update is approved is:

- Rides will automatically save both locally and to the server everytime you finish a ride
- Rides will automatically delete locally and from the server every time your delete a ride
- If for some reason, it can not save to the server when you finish a ride (for example, you don't have internet connection at the time), it will still save it locally. In this case, you will be able to go to the Sync Rides page, and click on Sync Local with Server. Any rides saved on your phone, but not the server should now be saved on the server
- If for some reason, you have rides on the server but not your phone (for example, you got a new phone), you can download the rides to your phone from the server by clicking the Sync Server with Local button in the Sync Rids page.

If you want to make sure both the server and local ride histories are the exact same, click both buttons (one at a time) and they should now be the same.

Please note, syncing between the server and your phone (i.e. local) will NEVER delete rides. It only adds rides that the other does not have.

The website still needs some considerable amount of work. Can't give a timeline for that yet, as it's going to be a crazy few weeks, but I'd like to have a  few basic options by the end of the week if possible.

If you haven't already, head over to [vescstatus.com](https://www.vescstatus.com) and create an account. We use the latest security standards and practices so you can trust your data is safe with us!

Sorry its been a while guys since I promised the new update. I finally finished finals, so I'm back to studying C and trying to figure out how I can get settings, change settings, and get data from other vesc's connected via canbus.

I didn't forget about the update, which was rejected before due to metadata issues, but has now been approved! You can now sync data between your iphone/ipad and your computer, via the website [VescStatus.com](https://www.vescstatus.com). The syncing process involves creating an account if you haven't already, logging in through the app, and clicking the button that says "sync local with server". Then, on a computer, you can access all of your rides.

On the site, you can compare rides in a massive chart, or click on a ride to view the detail in an app like display. You will also see one main graph, which is similar to the graph in the app, except more interactive, soon, there will be plenty more graphs on other data.

ONLY WARNING: Some old rides might break the code as it is. I am in the process of updating that right now, as I'm assuming data added in the last few updates, such as watt hour data, is in ever ride, which is not the case if your ride is more than a few months old. This will cause a error on the site. But this should be dealt with in the next hour, so fear not!

A small update: been a full day of working on the app and site. I have made a minor breakthrough. I have modified the VESC communication code so that I can get the firmware version. Now, it's a minor and data wise, insignificant. However, It's the simplest command possible, so I have learned a lot about the structure of how the VESC communicates through the uart port. However, shortly after, it's times out the connection. Something deep is going on, so I'll have to keep digging deeper until I can understand more of what's going on to figure out why it's crashing... Either way, it's a big step for me in the right direction. So hopefully more will come in the following weeks.

EDIT: I found the bug and now I can get firmware data!!! Small step, but now I'm going to start going after the other data and adding new tools to see and (hopefully) soon modify settings. The goal is to detect the number of vescs, put them into one page, you select the vesc, and modify settings however you want! It might be a week, it might be 3 months. But I'm working hard on it!

Hi, thank you for your support. We are actively working towards this, though we are unsure how long it may take to support more than 1 vesc. For one day of research, I would say Ive made great progress. It is entirely possible that this may require a firmware modification too, as it's unclear to me at this time exactly how I can use the canbus forward command.

The good news is that the work towards this is going forward. In the mean time, other updates to the app are being pursued also, including better screen resizing (if your not using an 4.7 inch screen) and some other interesting ideas, such as generating the exact battery discharge curve for your battery.

So I've had some break through and set backs today.

Lets start with the set backs... I've found 2 problems:

- I must keep telling my self that in C, there is no queues or stacks or anything for commands unless you build them yourself. When I send a command, I am relying on there being no other commands getting sent before the data is sent back to the iphone. Basically, I can't send a command to get data from the other VESC over can while requesting the master VESC send me his data. They write over top of each other and it results in a glitchy mess.
- I can't get data from other VESC's due to a simple limitation of the VESC firmware. The current COMM_FORWARD_CAN function only allows me to send data to another VESC, and get data from another VESC.

Really, what it comes down to is that I need to rewrite the firmware so that the VESCs communicate data about each other to one master, who will hold the data about all VESCs. This way, when get I call COMM_GET_VALUES, I get all VESC's data at once (whether it be 2 or 4 VESCs).

Theres another problem to this though, which is that again, one communication can happen per port at a time. What this means is you'll need to use a ppm splitter to control the VESCs together instead of using the canbus, so data can be shared via canbus.

Now on to the good news:

If done correctly, this *should* work. It's a bit crazy, but essentially, I should be able to get multiple vescs like this using a custom modified firmware. I will be testing this all in the coming weeks and months, until I can do it successfully.

Other good news, is that in addition to COMM_GET_VALUES and COMM_FIRMWARE_VERSION, I also got COMM_DETECT_MOTOR_R_L to work successfully, which does part of the FOC motor detection. Slowly, my list of commands is building. The next that I'm going after is to get settings, called COMM_GET_MCCONF. Sending data is still something I have to figure out too, as so far, I'm just sending commands to get data, with out passing any data along with it.

Just installed the app and bought the BT module from your site. Quick question; does this app work on Portrait mode or Landscape mode only?

The app works in landscape only mode. I also just mailed your chip, which you should receive within the next few days.

**Notice to everyone:** regardless of your status on paypal, all orders have been ship. If European orders should be there within no more than 2 weeks from today and all US orders should arrive within the next 3 days or less.

Got the module today and it works great. Quick question, is there a way to change the battery chemisty? Example: Lion to Lipo. I'm concerned I'm not getting a correct battery percentage.

Unfortunately, no. It's set for li-ion, but I am working on updating this part of the app. The goal is to use the vesc to discharge your battery over a hour period or so once so it can learn the discharge curve of your battery. Then, the percentage would be very accurate. If this doesn't work the way I in-vision it, I will do something to make it more accurate.

I've been trolling around watching the efforts for these bluetooth connections to the no-longer-called-VESC.  Just purchased your board.  Wanted to say a big 'Thank you' for providing back to the community.

Just wondering when you ship orders. I requested a receipt via your site 'contact us' page. There has been no response.  I got the PayPal payment email but so far nothing from Rocket Boards.  Getting kinda concerned...

@sprocket12  Hey, sorry. I usually ship every third day. Assuming you were my last order, your order should be arriving early next week. Sorry, I need to fix the contact us part of the site.

Just wanted to update everyone that this project is still going strong. I'm now able to get the app config correctly, but I'm still having issues with the mc config due to it's size. Hoping to sort that out soon so I can add the ability to modify all settings on the go.

Also, the website is being updated. Adding an FAQ, and modifying the home page.

After settings, the next goal is gps data.

Thanks @evoheyax for your work. As a 14+ year developer myself, I started to "re-invent the wheel" before I came across your code (and that of others). I started by reading from the CAN because my UART is taken by the nunchuck. On that note, has anyone been able to plug in a UART nunchuck AND your BT module to get both working [reliably]? One thought I had was to have my own module sit inbetween and forward the UART from the nunchuck into the VESC while simultaneously reading from the VESC.

I'm not sure if you can do both at once. I'm finding that I can't send a command while another command is executing. i.e. If I do FOC detection to measure L and R, and then I send a Comm_Get_Value request, it will overide the foc detection and it will quit. My strategy and the reason I mention this, is to create a queue with locks. This way, a command has to check to make sure there's no one with the lock already. If there is, it'll wait in the queue until it can get the lock.

Your requests might be fast enough that you could offset their timing possibly?

@evoheyax. 
Unfortunately I'm on android again. Is there any way I could help you transfer the code for an android app ?

I'm hopeful in the near future. Need to learn a lot about the BT code, which I'm doing now, since the code is incomplete. It only deals with small packets, but the mc_config, which is your main settings, is a large packet, and has to be handled differently. So I've been tracing the code and learning it better detail. I need to do this if I want to get the android side working ever, so it's good I learn it better.

I can now get the app config, so I could add the feature to edit app config settings to the app now even (will probably add it this week).

Really, I trying hard to simply and organize the code from RollingGecko. I have the vesc code down to one controller now, which is great. Once that's working better (i.e. can do large packets and I have all the requests I need added), it'll need to be ported to java (which is something you could possibly help with).

FWIW, I think it would be more useful to abstract whatever you have for iOS into a library, then have someone port it to Java but keep the same API contract of said library, then publish as a react-native plugin :slight_smile:

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to updated everyone on the status of this project. I know a lot slipped away, and I never got to some of the features I  was hoping to implement. However, I am back at it now with new knowledge. Having just completed Computer Architecture, where I learned to build a CPU from the logic gate level up, I learned to deal with bit manipulation very well (which is what got in my way before with the VESC communication code).

So, In just one day, I now can get all of the data for large commands, such as get_mc_config, which get's all the settings of the vesc.

So the good news... I will be working much closer with this again and more features / better gui will come.

The plan is to work more on this, but also, I'm planning to make a vesc compatible remote control based on the 2.4 mini trigger remote. Everything is going well with that, and I'll create another topic for that soon when I make a bit more progress.

I do have a short break this time, but I do hope to keep working on this into the spring semester this time, since I'm not limited anymore in working with bit level data.

More to come!
```
