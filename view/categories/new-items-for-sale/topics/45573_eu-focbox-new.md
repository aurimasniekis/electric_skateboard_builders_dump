Hi,
I want to sell one brand new foxbox within the EU.
Price is 120â‚¬ plus shipping.
Shipping via DHL is 7â‚¬ without tracking or 14â‚¬ with tracking to EU.
But you can choose every possible shipping method!

You can find somewhere an excell sheet where its stated how much each post office takes from the total price and everything, cool sheet.

Some youtuber made a video about it lets see if i can find it

sometimes people just take money for packing and the act of running half an hour to the post office.
So if someone wants to have 20 bucks for shipping, he probably includes other expenses in it, which is totally fine ;)

i donâ€™t really think thatâ€™s a good strategy 

here in america atleast, you can get shit picked up off your front porch the same day for totally free, if youâ€™re charging extra to get your ass up off the couch youâ€™ve got bigger problems ðŸ¤£

nah if thatÂ´s the case, than itÂ´s not a problem.
But getting boxes, organizing peopls adresses, printing postage stickers, pack everything, send stuff.
ThatÂ´s takes time and my time costs monies ;)

If youÂ´re only selling one focbox ok.. not that much of a hassle 7 bucks are fine for a standard package incl packaging.

Organizing and finding the packaging material is the worst!
And then there's the worry you misplaced something :D

If you work 12 hours a day making 40$+ dollars an hour then your time holds a significant value. I personally see this as a hobby and the return I get is secondary as long as I don't lose money. Others may be in a different situation.

i didnâ€™t say it was a bad price...

I merely commented on how expensive shipping is in the EU vs US

You are omissing that US is one country whereas EU is 30 countries with 30 languages and different law systems. A fair comparison would be comparing [US to Mexico] shipment or something.

If shippings cost like that in us, I will move there!! It's incredible just 2.41 USD to ship 2 vecs
Do they even arrive ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚?? 

In eu minimum 6-7 euros to ship with untrackable postage ðŸ˜• without fees for packaging and time to prepare

[quote="GrecoMan, post:9, topic:45573"]
shit picked up off your front porch the same day for totally free
[/quote]

UPS charges $6 for pickups. FedEx $6.50. DHL only does pickups for business. Dynamex only does business. 

The only free is USPS in your mailbox.

And no Amazon returns aren't free... For Amazon.. ya prime fiend

If you know otherwise, share because I'd sure as hell like to know.
