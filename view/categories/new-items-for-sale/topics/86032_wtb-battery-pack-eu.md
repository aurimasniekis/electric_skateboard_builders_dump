Im in Scandinavia too (Norway) and just bought a pack yesterday from Hyperion in the US. If you can wait some time, a shipping company called JetCarrier will ship it by ship from US to scandinavia.

It takes about a month+, but I have had no problem with them the last time I used them for this :slight_smile:

Thanks for recommending me, @Chaki im open for business, and I just got a new welder that should not be a bottleneck like the old one was!

You could also maybe combine shipping with @mackann if hes up for it, maybe it comes out cheaper
Since I ship a lot of batteries to him :)
