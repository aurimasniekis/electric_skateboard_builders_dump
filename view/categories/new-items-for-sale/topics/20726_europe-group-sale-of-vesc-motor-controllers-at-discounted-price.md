Nice offer. I am just wondering how you will deal with FOC warranty claims. Are you supporting the use of FOC or is that user error and not supported?

Hey. Glad you guys liked the offer. Been working on this for the last 2 days. 

So the warranty topic. We provide warranty for the hardware and quality assurance. So if things burn because of production issues then we would investigate and replace the motor controller. 

We do not provide warranty for the user error, instead we are open for calls via skype offering support for setting up the VESC. 

We're an early stage company and try to be as transparent as we can. We kind of hope our customers are sincere to us as well :) 

Hope that answers your question.

None taken. VESC-X is a different product. When buying from Australia you need to pay import taxes.

are you telling me that when i order a VESC-X I will get it without customs and EU warranty?
Maybe @onloop can chime in and tell us what would actually happen.
AFAIK the VESC-X is sent from the US and you WILL have to pay additional VAT
