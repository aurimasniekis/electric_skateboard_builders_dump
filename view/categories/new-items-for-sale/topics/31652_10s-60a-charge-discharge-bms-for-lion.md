Hello, I have one 10S Lion BMS for sale. It has a 60A charging and discharging rate. I got this BMS from Aliexpress and it has never been used. I decided to go with another BMS for my project instead. This looks to be a good quality product and I have seen others use this style BMS with no issues. Here is the link to the original product: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10S-60A-version-S-lipo-lithium-Polymer-BMS-PCM-PCB-battery-protection-board-for-10-Packs/32730392818.html

Price: $35 shipped in US
This comes brand new and the shipping will be much faster than ordering from China. I'm not sure how fast shipping would be outside of the US, but we could work that out if there is interest. Thanks!
