This battery is brand new. I purchased it from psychotiller with hopes to make a board and resale… never panned out and I’ve sold most of the other parts already. This is a 12s5p 30q 18650 battery with charge only bms. Price is $425 and shipping in US only for free.

Price is for the battery only but if you need the charger and/or charging port, let me know and I’ll throw it in for free.. ![2F4A7E70-174F-48F5-93FC-D10966FA83A3|666x500](upload://e59uFC9bU4WEd2EYubv5fmzH5uq.jpeg) ![2A5595D9-0999-4430-B080-5F45AA3267B7|666x500](upload://pBvWPMyhBfubz8DgaHMcRjnRSbU.jpeg)
