batteries are awfully hard to sell and have people believe they are 100% as stated. if you can, provide a purchase receipt from when and where you bought them. It will help massively.

Would you consider selling the BMS for less? Not sure how much you were going to spend on shipping but $50 is full price, no reason to buy yours especially because it is used.
https://buildkitboards.com/collections/batteries/products/bestech-bms ($7 for 2 day shipping)

I would offer ~$35 + shipping for yours
