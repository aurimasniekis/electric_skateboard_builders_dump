I purchased a build off of another forum member mostly to get the Carvon hub motors and the enclosure. I’m swapping out some components so I figured I would offer them here. 

4.12 VESC (not sure who the mfg is)
MEB Anti spark Switch
Bluetooth module

$100 for it all. I want to offer this to someone less fortunate so please don’t just buy these to have as backups.

I also still have a 10s3p Samsung 30Q battery pack for sale. PM for details.
