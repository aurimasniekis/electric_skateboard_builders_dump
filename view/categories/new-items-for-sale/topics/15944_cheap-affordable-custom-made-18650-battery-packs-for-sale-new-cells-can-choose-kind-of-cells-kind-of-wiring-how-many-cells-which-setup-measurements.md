I make affordable battery packs for ebikes, eboards, carts, planes,... 
(I LIVE IN BELGIUM so only EUROPEAN CUSTOMERS)

-You can choose (sketch or drawing) the setup/measurements how the batteries should be packed..
-you can choose which kind of cells i use...  samsung25r, LG's,... (depents on your Voltage and needed current)
-i do all the wiring and put it in some shink tape, and put a sticker on the battery with the specifications.
-tests and measurements are done on the battery to check if its 100% working before i ship it to you.
-with spacers in between the cells or without
-with or without BMS charger/balance wires (BMS battery managment system (NOT INCLUDED, i can do this but order will take longer, dont have BMS's in stock))

Email me with a list off all the specs, voltage, cells, kind of cells, setup/measuements, and what it is intended to be used for,... 
Then i will calculate the costs to build this battery, and make you an offer.
If you like it, will take a week or 2-3 to build it, i have a lot of them to build xd
, then shipping depends on where you live


Once im back at home, i'll upload some more fotos of the finished battery packs made in the past. These are a few i found on my old pc. The new packs look even cleaner xd getting skilled

Just to get a whiff of the pricing, how much would a flat 10s3p with BMS be aprox?

RWXR, 
to answers your question... Kind of BMS? Amps that it has to resist? amps charging? amps discharging?

10S3p is like 30 cells... but if you dont tell me which cells... how much capacity... continious MAX discharge rating,...
sony's, samsungs, LG's? how long/thick wires you need... with or withour spacers... 

I'll need a lot more then that to make a realistic offer.

Hi 
It sounds great that we are getting some battery pack builders in Europe!
It would be great to get some prices on different setups as @rwxr also suggested. Then we all can have something to go on. 

Maybe you can give a price on different battery setups. Then you could also give us the price on any add-on products such as BMS, spacers, wire, connecters etc.

I suggest you give you pricing on the following products:

10s4p Samsung 25r (cells only)
10s3p Samsung 25r (cells only)
BMS for 10s 60A discharge
BMS for 10s, only for charging
BMS for 12s 60A discharge
BMS for 12s, only for charging
Spacers for 10s
Spacers for 12s
10awg wire
XT90 connecters
Heat shrink
Etc.
```

Just an estimate.. price depend a little on the guys were i order,

To be honest and give an answer TO ALL YOU GUYS, i rather build packs, completly finished, but without BMS, the only thing you will have to do is connect the numbered (i tag them) balance cables to the BMS, +- to the ESC... and you are ready to go..
WHY???? if i build them with BMS, i have to order BMS's, and it takes a long time to get here, everybody wants another BMS with other specs, some only wanne use it to charge, some also to discharge...
and BMS's fail now and then even when new... batterys almost never do.. SO TO BE HONEST... im just doing this in by spare time, after working hours, and i dont want to be bugged with customer support issues, resending and paying back and stuff... i know MY BATTERY PACKS ARE % QUALITY and SOLID BUILD... but i cant give my word on all the different kinds and brands of BMS's out there. china is taking over :smiling_imp:
+it takes like 5 minutes to connect the BMS youself... i make a wiring scheme and number all the wires

30(25Rs) x 4.80eu(depends on the market prices) = 144eu
30 x 1.75 (price per cell to pack, nickel strips, soldering, glue holders,...) = 52.5eu
1m 10AWG black(I order them by meter) + 1m AWG red = (6.8eux2) = 13.6eu 
shipping cost of the batterys to my place (18eu), and shippings cost's to your place.. i guess/hope Europe.. so 12-15euro depends on the weight

so a total of 243,1 so to round it off and treat me a drink(pay the beers while i was building this pack XD)
lets say 250euro and that thing is on his way to you in bubble wrap xd

Would you offer the service of welding if we provide the cells ? Where are you going to order btw... If its in Europe you can get 25Rs below 3€/cell from nkon. 4,80€ seems to be a tad expensive. As well as the material costs you stated. I have gotten 10AWG 1m for 3€ ... Can you be a bit more transparent about this ?

More transparant?:scream:
I get my cells from a company i trust, do bussines with them for long time, lot of fake/restickerd 18650 on the market.
I dont say you cant find all this shit somewhere cheaper, go to ebay, buy yourself some chinese crap and save 50bucks, and you can start rebuilding after a month.

And buddy, i dont know if you noticed... but i dont do this for free, i spend a lot of my time in building battery packs.
if you order everything yourself, solder everything up, pack it, you will be cheaper off then with me....
some people call it working hours.. and a pulse soldering machine is EXPENSIVE...
working hours...you get paid for it..
+ i pay double shipping cost, first to ship everything to my place, then to reship it to you guys

oh wow.. I didn't mean to anger you. But well, don't "buddy" me. This is a DIY Forum and people who offer their service should be transparent since everybody is willing to pay for services and agrees if you make some profit. Since you are not running a company, what would be the issue to state all costs and the profit you would want to take from it ?

Btw, nkon is a reputable seller here in the EU. Every senior member, battery builder or anyone who has build his own pack has ordered from there. So it is certainly not a company who "fake/resticker" their cells... It was just an idea to keep the costs down for yourself and the people who are willing to work with you, since you get your cells for quite a high price. 


-> You can get all that shit for half the price from reputable sellers in the EU. Does that make sense now ? I think anyone here agrees if you take the costs for your working hours lol... 

e.g.:
30x 25Rs from nkon = 95 incl. shipping 
(Nickel, strips, soldering, glue holders, wrapping, heat shrink,...) = 52€ for a 10s3p ?... Buy it in bulks... I paid around 10€ for a 10s4p for that stuff...

i aint a company, i cant buy in bulk, i order what i need per pack, i cant start stocking loads of stuff and then have the remaining stuff hanging around in my appartment....

working hours are calculated into the parts, i can also tell you what my parts cost seperatly, and just charge you per hour i spend on it.. what depends on how fast i work that day xd but i just put the costs into the parts...
that 250eu for the 10s3p is about 195eu on parts, materials, rent of the soldering machine i use from a collegue, shrink tape, nickle plates, spacers, gluegun filling, wiring, balance wires, test devices, cell logger... 

AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL.. al the electrical test i perform on the pack when i is finished... just to make shure everything works like it should under full power discharge,....
then the time i put in making wiring diagrams, making stickers with all the specs of the battery on it, each time...

i think my battery service is really good quality and yeah i earn some money on it...
IF I WASNT EARNING SOMETHING ON IT, i wouldnt be here wasting time, I WOULD BE CRUISING MY EBOARD  AROUND TOWN INSTEAD OF BUILDING BATTERY PACKS.

And TranxFu, We're al DIY Eboard builders.... Arent we al buddy's?? XD

and the remaining 60euro is for me, the work i put into it.. the tests i do, the wiring diagrams and spec stickers i put on it... and paying off the shippings cost etc...
driving out too the postal office every week, to drop packages/battery packs

I put a lot of work in them to make the batterys as professional, beautifull looking, solid but stil a little bit flexible(vibrations) as possible...

SO TO CONCLUDE... I AINT THE CHEAPEST OPTION ON THE MARKET,  I DONT HAVE THE PLACE AND MONEY TO ORDER IN BULK
BUT I WILL DELIVER YOU A SICKASS , SOLID, UNBREAKABLE, MADE WITH LOVE PACK, as if i would use it for myself...


PS: By the way guys, im also building my own Pre-build drive boxes(ESC, receiver, wattmeter, onoffswitch, capacitor bank, fuses,... build in a hardcase...)

I also sell motor mounts i CNC at work <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/9/f922de91533844b0a28b4cef0eb3abe5bdbc34c4.jpg" width="496" height="496">
They are made a hiiiiggghhh grade airplane aluminium, we make badass solid motor mounts and rotor parts with this material for motors like 20-40X as big as the guys we ride with on our boards... If you want them in another colour, i can spraypaint them in other colours then black... but hey all get a black primer like listed above

It's absolutelly OK you want to get some money out of it.
We just told you that you can easily find the same parts with lower prices.
And you don't even have to order in bulk!

I'm making my own battery pack, just the components:
10S4P ( 40 cells ) Samsung 25R - 120 eur + 11 eur shipping
Nickel strips - 1.50 EUR / meter
10 AWG wires - 0.94 EUR / meter
26 AWG wire ( balance leads ) - 2 EUR for 25 meters
Heatshrink, connectors and other crap: < 10 euros.
Do the math, that's not 195 euros on parts.

Spot welder? I'm making my own.
Car battery - free ( or 40 EUR )
mosfets - 10 euros
cuprextit ( the thing PCBs are made of ) - 1 euro
other components - under 10 euros.
5 AWG cable - 3.35 EUR / meter, you will ned ~ 2 meters.
That's total of 30-60 euros for the spot welder.

AGAIN GUYS, IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A PACK YOURSELF, JUST DO SO ISTEAD OF WHINING.. you will be cheaper of... but i you dont have the material, dont have the feeling or hands to do so, dont have the knowledge, i offer to do it for you guys, and a price is always dissussable in a private discussion.
And the people who know cheaper or faster ways to do it, get a pack build... please do so and stop discussing with me... im just a guy who loves electronics and eboards, having a second income off of building eboard components... 

i already build battery packs weekly for electric bicycles, and just thought to offer my services here to.

You probably don't understand what we want to tell you.
We are just trying to help, to tell you that you can source the parts for cheaper.
Not to sell it cheaper, just that you can get the parts for cheaper.
This way, you can make more money or you can sell it cheaper.
My post was just an example how YOU can do it for YOUR CUSTOMERS with minimal parts cost.

But okay, yell at us, be angry, thats the best way you can say "thanks for your advices"...
Have a nice day.

Youre right man,

thanks for the advice, ill take it into account'.
I know i can find some stuff a little bit cheaper, but that would also extend the delivery time... cause the people i order from, bring me the stuff the next morning...
But you are right, maybe with some googling i can find my parts a little bit cheaper.

Ain''t angry, just felt a little attcked, and the boss bitching my ass off on the job isnt helping out too

This price isn't bad, compared to what companies sell batteries for (350 euros for a space cell). As said before, though, you could make it cheaper/make more money out of it. You decide the final price, but when you do a list of the components try to find the best and cheapest option. I think in this forum people have no problem waiting a couple more days, since it's pretty hard to get everything we need in a short time (I've been waiting for parts for 3 months now, I don't even care anymore when will they arrive, I'm waiting for summer) but they often care about price, if that can be lowered. You can even keep the price (it's still good) and make more money, so you may be able to afford your own spot welder and have less problems in the future. This service is really needed in Europe, you shouldn't have problems to sell. Before the last Europe big group buy the only pre-built liion packs I had seen were just from another little group buy. No producers, no sellers. Keep up the good work and you'll find success

I hope you are right, that many customers may follow.
I already ordered everything for 3 boards, received everything in 1 month and build them in like 4 months...
I prefer being able to finish my builds, then finding a little bit cheaper parts, but having to wait monthhhsss...

:astonished:

You realize that when someone finds out about this he faces serious trouble? How can one not mention this?
This type of "work" is ok to do for friends and in very small quantities. The most important part is that there is no intention to actually make any money out of it. As soon as that changes you are required to file for all the necessary legal documents, provide receipts and warranties. Maybe he has and just doesn't call him a company. I don't know.

Also I find your post highly offensive...

You are right, from the law point of view, it does not...
I compared him to Enertion and Ollin cause these are great definition of a "company" or "business" and you expect them to be registered, not someone like him. Don't tell me you never sold something to someone and not paid a tax.

That is the point I am trying to make: there is a difference between a one time thing or an actual "business model".
He specializes in battery manufacturing, offering his services on a public forum and openly talking about the intention to make a profit - that is risky. I am not saying that I judge him for it - but people should know what they are dealing with here. And as I also said: maybe he is registered. I don't know and this is all speculation.

That is all he is trying to do. Either you're in Europe and need a battery pack or not. 

If you don't like his total price then move along. 

I don't know why people are questioning his profit margins and taxes.

Hi
Thank you again for helping others building batteries. I am sure many europeans will be happy to do business with you. 
I fully understand that you feel attacked by people on this forum, but I think that they want to help - just as you want to help. 
I think that it is important to keep a good tone when communicating to costumers. Maybe some people will choose not to buy a product if they feel ill treated. Without sounding too much like Ghandi I would advise you to treat others like you want to be treated yourself. I think all of you may just misunderstand each others intentions. 

About your battery packs, I think your price seems fair. I think it is totally fine that you earn money on the service you are giving. Maybe I will place an order some time.

C'mon guys calm down. In my previuos group buys I also posted some pictures found on the internet to give one idea of the product. This is normal when you still havent built it.

If people are even going to start threatening with tax evasion bullshit xd i thought this was a DIY forum.. with some fun DIYers on here, maybe someone i could make happy.. im going on with my hobby, and will just help friends out with their e-bicycles, drones and eboards. Thought i could help some people out, cause i noticed lots off people are struggling to get a battery pack for their board, or dont wanne buy a space-cell, and i just build'em for fun. And the motor mounts are just replicas, of the ones you can find all over the internet, but cnc'ed and spraypainted.... and from a tottally diffrent, stronger alluminum we had laying around. not that chinese recycled stuff xd 

I will upload a pic of my 4th finished eboard when its complete... She's a monster.
Be prepared to be shocked XD

But no more battery packs, sorry to the few people who already send me a message for an order/offer, but it seems helping people out ain't LEGIT. Aint gonne get myself into shit with torqueboards, jason, ollin, enertion.

Guys succes with your builds, sad to see, never thought people would react like this, on for my 420. Adios.

Well, i have to agree to the other people here in the thread. 
It is a nice offer from him! It is no problem that he wants some money for the production time. The only problem the people are complaining is that something seems fishy:
- He sells "self made" mounts which you can buy on ebay in larger scales 
- He does not use pictures of his products just some google pictures (maybe He did not make pictures but He could have made at least one from his current Packs He is using)

BUT my buddy who is here does :slight_smile:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/f/9f7ee5fdab93da7199821958ae56ce614922cd35.jpg" width="690" height="388"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/2/025deb9cf72a4481aa88b24acb60e40f5e847ef4.jpg" width="690" height="388"> 

this one is going onto his board(black one), just finished it yesterday, like you can see, only the BMS has to be put onto it, and the other one is going into a "external flatpack" in a epoxy cover, to clip on my board if i need some extra miles.

Now we're talking!
I'll be the first to admit that I've might have been a bit harsh in this thread, but this is the internet and there are a lot of shady businesses/people around every corner and I think it's good to be a bit skeptical to things before starting to throw hard earned money in every direction.

The level of trust between members of this forum is higher than other forums I've been on, but to earn this trust you have to be open and transparent about what you're doing, because there is a lot of bright people around here that will see trough bullshit right away.

Keep doing what you're doing and if you're honest and professional good things will happen.

Cheers!

I think this guy is done! 😂
He has now been busted twice! 
I think that @rwxr is totally right. You have to be a bit skepticle on the internet. The fact that the guy was so quick to get offended and go into "defense mode" might also be because of the fact that he is hiding something. 
I would definetly not pay this guy anything. I am sorry to be a bit harsh BUT you can't be too sure on the internet.

Just let him build his packs and don't be such a dick, I really hate it when people say they can get things cheaper.
Very nice if you can get stuff cheaper so build your own packs like I do, he's just offering it to people who don't have the knowledge and stuff at home.
