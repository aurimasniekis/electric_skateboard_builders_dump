Description:

Maytech brushless outrunner hall sensor motor are specially designed for electric skateboard. They come with low KV, high torque and efficiency.  All parts are made of a high-precision CNC machining center, and all surfaces are made with oxidation treatment. High temperature and high purity oxygen-free copper wires were used. The motors use high-grade magnets and 0.2 mm lamination to improve efficiency.
The hall-effect sensors inside tracks the motor’s position. This information permits the controller to alternate power with the right timing and in the right sequence and, voila, it spins.

Better efficiency means you get more mechanical energy per unit of power,

After a lot of development we have put together what we know works best for an electric skateboard motor and made it small and compact.

damn... I was thinking of getting this to replace my DIYEboard motors because mine don't have sensors. Just double checked and mine has 8mm shaft and yours has 6mm :frowning:
