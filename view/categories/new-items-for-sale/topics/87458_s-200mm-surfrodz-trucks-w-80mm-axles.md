Bought during the great surfrodz sale, and realised i have 1 set too many.

Am selling a set (2 trucks), for $130usd (to cover what I paid for intl shipping costs) + shipping. If you're in the US, i can ship it to you for 10bucks via USPS, as i will be travelling to SF/Hawaii this week.

Specs:
* 200mm hangers
* 80mm axles
* 45deg baseplates
