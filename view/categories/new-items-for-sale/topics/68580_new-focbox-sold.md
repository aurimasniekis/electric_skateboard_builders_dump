Why are you selling them so cheap? Is something wrong with them?

$145 for a focbox is a good deal not cheap. They go for $155 usually. They are extra from a build I decided to not build. Nothing wrong with them at all. Brand new

Ahh $145 Per/ESC.... I know how much a focbox is worth, I read the post backwards in my mind thinking you meant $145 for 2.
