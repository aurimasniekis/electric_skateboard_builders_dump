It has been really fun working on these mounts for some time now, and now they are complete and ready for action.

![DSCF4033_1|690x454](upload://jYCYuMeGJPcGlbBTFlotkSYfBGl.jpeg) 

It's a fixed mount for caliber II 50 deg and TB218 trucks with as good fit on both trucks. I wanted to make a short, simple and robust mount with the option to run idler pulleys behind the wheels.

Some info:
* For 63xx motors
* Center to center distance is 72mm
* Made in 7075-T6 Aluminium
* Blasted and anodised semi matte black
* 2-piece clamp
* Optional idler pulley and crossbars
* Reversable design, so you can mount motors either forward or aft of trucks

The Caliber truck in the picture is a 9", just because that was the shiniest truck I had nearby at the moment.

If you want to get hold of these mounts, I have them available together with some extra stuff here: [www.whooshboards.com](https://whooshboards.com/)

Yes, if you are not running a huge motor pulley you should be fine. The idler tucks in behind the wheel. The setup on the pictures are 36T/15T 280mm belt, 90mm wheels. There is room for 114mm wheels incl margins on this setup, as an example.

Tkp Surfrodz should be here any day now. Had to order from sickboards.nl since shipping from SR costs 70USD(!) and they never get around to answer my mails. Ended up the at the same amount. Except now I also have to pay for that Loaded kut-thaka that jumped into my checkout basket üòÇ

It is pretty much done. I am finishing some other parts also that will be produced at the same time. Turns out the current motor plate will only work in rear mount config on tkp, so I will have some longer made also, with slots for adjustability.

So the motor plates needs to have a center to center distance of 80mm instead of 72mm to fit on the Surfrodz as well as Calibers. This is how it will look except with 12mm motor pulleys:

@Indiangummy is right. You could use them on E-calibers also with the caliber clamp if you like. I will split it up into different configs on the website when they are ready.

I have the longer motorplates for rearward mounting in the works now, any feedback is appreciated.

* C-C distance = 95mm +- 4mm

* Black AL7075 6.9mm thick, 5.9 at motor.

* Fits clamps for SR TKP, TB218, Caliber

* Bonus: Possible to run 50x motors as well with adjustable idlers.

The screw is supposed to be flush with the backside/motorside. I think I know whats wrong, I sent you a different type of screw than used with these before. I will update the model asap. Sorry for the inconvenience, are you able to print them again? Is the clearance to the wheel OK?

Found that I had modified it to fit the new screw type, but they still lacked 1mm to be flush/not hitting motor. Please check out these new models I just released on thingiverse, also I added more variations:

I didn't actually try screwing it yet, just fitted it and visually there was very little space (maybe 1mm) between the 90mm ABEC11 wheels and the cover.

I have a lot of screw types and I can cut them, I will try the current one first to avoid reprinting (my PETG spool is vacuum sealed right now)

Only for tkp hex this time. Best bet would be to use the plates on @lrdesigns press it mount.

There really is nothing in this for me except that it's fun to design these. Too small quantities for making any profit out of it currently. So any new truck clamp is unfortunately out of the question at the moment. 

If there is enough interest I could have done it through a group buy or similar. But I rather would design a cnc truck especially made for esk8. Have already got some quotes that indicates I could sell them at the same price as surfrodz.

I also have some soft 83mm clones and flywheel pulleys on the site with really good prices right now. At this price the pulleys are a steal in my book since they cost more to produce. But they do no good collecting dust.

Pulleys have a nice chamfered ring that fits snuggly against the core. Tight fit inside the core prevents any wobbles. No need for hanger modifications:

@Mikaelj I see that you are expanding the line and I'm considering Surfrodz for the next build. With the new options of motor length that you have available I would think many would like to run 15mm belts instead of 12mm. Would you make 15mm pulleys? Also, can you make longer crossbars so the extender is not needed?

Ultimately it would be great if you could test fit your mounts on a real surfrodz, with dual 15mm belts ,dual 6374 or even 6380 motors and the crossbars. Currently it's hard for me to tell if all of that would fit for sure.

## \#61 Posted by: Mikaelj Posted at: 2019-04-19T18:00:41.765Z Reads: 161

```
@gmurad Thanks for the feedback. I know 15mm belts are popular because they (probably) will last longer and skips less when not using an idler. And I want to offer them in the future. 

Personally I never need more than 12mm, its more room for motor, I feel it rolls/coast better, you can run a narrower truck and they never skip for me with the idler. The extenders do their job well and make everything modular so you can use the mount on all motor sizes, maybe I will offer longer crossbars in the future just to improve the looks of it.

I only have 177mm tkp with 6355 at the moment, but I saw @Powadangaboards just posted a photo of a build with tkp and some large motors, maybe he can help out with a picture when he receive his mounts, hope it's OK that I mentioned you here @Powadangaboards üôÇ

To summarize some nice features of these mounts for new people looking at this thread:

* Sandblasted and anodized for sleek look and protection. 

* optional idlers in aluminum that tucks in behind the wheel for support of large wheel while keeping mounts short.

* made in 7075-T6 aluminum

* two piece clamp for reliability and flexibility. The caliber mounts fit just as well on TB218 as on calibers without any need to file down the clamp.

* Holepattern on plates ensure no slipping/sag over time.

* direction and recess of clamp screws gives more ground clearance than other similar designs.

* extendable crossbars for use with most motor sizes.

* Downloadable pulley covers on the website

* Reversible, can be run fwd or rearward

* Stainless Steel hardware included

No worries @Mikaelj  As soon as the mounts get here ill get some pics across, im wondering what belts will be best so will need a few to experiment with.

Im testing out the 177 TKP with 110mm shoulder bolts to see how they perform with the TB110's .

Should have all complete on the 25th :)

These TKP mounts fit a dream! 

Took me a while to work out the combination on spacers and distance for the crossbar but got there in the end.  

I‚Äôm using 177 TKP with 110 shoulder bolts with bergmiester wheels. 

I have also fitted the Evolve 83mm street wheels with a 36 tooth gear and it uses he same spacer combination so when my TB110‚Äôs arrive they should fit perfect :) 

Just a few last bits to finish and I can tear it about :)

Nice! Really nice build. Do you think this would work with the 180 Surfrodz? That's what I'm thinking of getting.

It's too bad it can't fit 2 crossbars.

Does 180mm surfrodz exist? To use the second crossbar on this setup you would have to topmount the deck or lower the angle of the mounts. I think this is fine as is, it's better to have the ground clearance than the second crossbar in this case.

I think 180mm is the more common size for eskate.

btw, I have around 60kms on your mounts now on my Vanguard Deck build. The mounts haven't moved at all. I'm so happy with them, it's the 5th mount I tried and the only one that has such precise alignment and good design that the 12mm belts don't skip even with no idlers being used and my 220lbs. Nothing has moved out of place either, super solid.

That's so good to hear @gmurad ! üôÇüëç 

Is it the surfrodz tkp or rkp you are looking at getting? Tkp are 177mm and rkp 176 or 200mm hangers. Not seen any with 180mm.

just finished designing this for my lrdesigns mounts. Here are the diameters your looking for. Hit me up on PM if you want anything - I now return you to your regular programming. :stuck_out_tongue:

ed: enlarged central hole to 30mm

What about to get some for my next build and realized they are Surfrodz TKP and not RKP clamps! Back to the drawing board

Yes, only Tkp at the moment. Rkp needs push-on type because of their strange hanger shape.

Caliber / TB218 clamps all sold out, just Tkp mounts and flywheel pulleys left.
