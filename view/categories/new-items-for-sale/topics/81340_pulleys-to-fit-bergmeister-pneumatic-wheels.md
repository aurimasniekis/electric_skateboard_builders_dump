 I have 13t, 14t, and 15t motor pulleys with 72t wheel pulleys. Will this https://www.janux-esk8.com/product-page/janux-dual-drive-motor-mount-system-for-mbs-matrix-pro  fit my transmission? If so, what length belt would you recommend? I'm using 5m 15mm htd belts.

Too bad I bought the pulleys when they were 50usd... literally the week after I bought them they are 35usd RIP Snoozed and lost I suppose ;P

13-16/72t would fit with this https://www.janux-esk8.com/product-page/janux-dual-drive-motor-mount-system-for-mbs-matrix-pro.  As for belt length, it's best to set up your drive train, string around your drive pulleys to measure.

So with these do you no longer use the lock nut? The bolt goes far enough into the pulley that it holds tight?

Lock nut is no longer necessary which makes installation very easy with single hex tool.  The included stainless bolts thread into entire 27mm or 1+"  pulley thickness.

So, what would the total price come up to with your dual motor mounts for the old style Matrix Pro, two 72t 5m 18mm pulleys for superstar hubs, and 15mm belts? I don’t know the length of belt I need because I don’t know how long your motor mounts are but I plan on running the 72t with 13t, 14t and 15t motor pulleys. I live in Colorado by the way
