Hello Folks,
I have ordered all the wheels available at Enertion, but they aren't what I've hoped for.
For sale is a complete set of the 100 mm crossover wheels (front regular wheel, back sleeves) and
a full set of the new 97 mm street wheels (front regular wheel, back sleeves).
Price wise I would like to not loose to much money so please be fair with your offers. Sets of four wheels make more sense so I would prefer to sell as a full Raptor 2 set.
Pics soon.

I think they went the easy way and just changed the duro of the thane. 
Don’t know why shipping took ages then.
