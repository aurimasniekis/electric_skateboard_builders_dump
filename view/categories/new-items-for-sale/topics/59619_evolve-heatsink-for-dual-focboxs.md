Pictures first 😜 I needed a Heatsink to mount 2 FOCBOX's for my own "Evolve" project but then realized a lot more builders were looking for such a Heatsink. So I had a sample made. Quality is great, some of the dimensions need a little tweaking but all the fresh units will be perfect. 

**IMPORTANT**: 2 FOCBOX's are a little too wide for the Evolve case, so you will have to sand about 4mm off each side, check the red marks on the last picture. 

Final price is €46 for 1 Heatsink with worldwide shipping and €85 for 2 Heatsinks with worldwide shipping. Please use 'goods and services' and put your forum name / shipping address in the comments.

They should be complete on Friday 6th of July and start shipping the following week.

It’s you choice to pay as ‘friends and family’ or ‘goods and services’ (but with this option please add €3). Put your forum name and shipping address in the comments.

Sadly it is again forum rules to ask to get paid by Friend or Family....

Thank you for bringing this to my attention @JohnnyMeduse. 

@BoostedBuilder Johnny is correct, when doing sales in this context on the forum we request that you use the goods and services transaction for the security of both yourself as the vendor and other members involved as customers. I hope you don’t mind, I’ve taken the liberty of editing areas of your posts and adding €3 to both price points as not to confuse anybody. If there are any further issues regarding this matter, feel free to contact myself or my fellow moderators and we’ll help in any way we can.

It's sooo tempting, I have an evolve bamboo gt now. I'm already running 200kv 5065's as the stock 150's locked up on me. I'm on my third evolve motor controller in 5 months and if I were a betting man I'd say this one will die sooner or later. I have someone who can hook me up with some focbox's but I'd have to wait till the end of summer. I get paid Friday so after I move some money towards bills and rent. I'll see if I can buy 1. Hopefully that isn't too late.

What happened to the other two? That sounds frustrating! I thought Evolve ESC's were pretty good...

@craigthemachine whatever suits you best : )

@kylem21 yes sir! First of all that will allow for more efficient cooling and 2 FOCBOX's with original cases won't fit in the enclosure. If that's an issue for you, let me know.

shouldn't be an issue as long as my focbox's are still safe in there :smile:
also, im not using this for an evolve board, I was thinking of just mounting it to my own build with an boosted enclosure for better cooling. Will this still be effective?

Ohh, well they will definitely be safe, very effective but not waterproof. For the eBoosted enclosure you might want to check out the new heatsink @Kug3lis is working on.

## \#41 Posted by: ThermalChild Posted at: 2018-06-26T22:50:48.417Z Reads: 245

```
Well one would never let me switch modes unless I shut off the board and reconnected and would cut out occasionally, The second got permanently stuck in safe mode and would not switch out. This one seems fine but I only had it back for a month. My warranty ends I think next month but evolve customer service can suck it, tired of dealing with them. Half  the time they ignore me anyway.

Unfortunate really, because I own a GTX with 200kv motors, and the cooling is pretty decent. I don’t know, if I figure how to install it without making my board look ghetto I could order after I get my case.

@BoostedBuilder I will have to wait a bit before making a decision on the heat sinks as my original plan for the enclosure changes and this might not work with the design I’m gonna go for, sorry. My current build is in a bit of a unknown state due to me wanting many cells but also not willing to sacrifice clearance under the deck...

@sofu it can be for both because you'll have to shave a little bit of the side lips of the enclosure. It's just that plastic will be easier to cut/sand rather then carbon fibre. But I don't recommend it for CGT.

Thanks!

Yes, I know. Right now I have only a cheap chinese ESC from the previous owner. I want to fit two focboxes and a Bestech BMS with a new 10S4P battery in the future. Hope I can fit everything in there with a riser for the enclosure. 

But thanks for your attention!

Sounds good! But I'm not sure if the Bestech BMS and a 10s4p will fit in that case, even with a riser (it all depends on the BMS you'll be using). Carefully calculate all the dimensions! Personally I'm using a 10s3p with their big BMS, and I only have about 30mm left.

Oh ja, I already had worries a 10s4p wouldn't fit. I'm also not aware of another good BMS with e-switch. Well, a good Samsung q30 10s3p will also offer enough range and wouldn't sag as much as the original Evolve one I think.

## \#63 Posted by: BoostedBuilder Posted at: 2018-07-06T23:16:06.385Z Reads: 195

```
[This new one](http://bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D452V1.html) could fit over the FOCBOX's, and it has an e-switch but it's only rated to 55A max continuous current.

[This one](http://bestechpower.com/37v10spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCB-D345.html) could be an option if you use a big enough gasket, an put it on top of the battery but I don't recommend butting a BMS on top of the cells.

There are also a few you can find on AliExpress.

Not sure what you mean by adequate in this situation. I believe it's of good quality but you need the Evolve ESC for it to work properly (that's what I think cause they use a CAN bus connection).

I have the original 150v  GT Motors. So I think the 55A one could indeed work. The second one is the one I had in mind. Or even the 80A one to be prepared for bigger motors in the future. Not sure right now.

Sort of, sorry to say that they are not done yet. I was told 2 days ago that they still have 10 more to make and should be done today but knowing how long they take to actually make them, I would say Friday next week they should be sent to me for inspection and re-shipment to you guys.

I believe I'll be sending them out on the 23rd / 24th of June with Priority shipping which is 3 - 4 business days to most countries.

Hello everyone,

Sorry for the long wait once again. I was hoping to get this done much quicker!

I'm still hoping to receive the Heatsinks in a couple of days but that hasn't been confirmed yet by the anodizing facility so if anyone is no longer willing to wait, let me know and I'll refund you because there is a chance things won't be going as I want them to go : (

I was just about to update the thread.

Guys, PLEASE don't bash me! I've honestly been doing everything that's in my hands. They were sent out last Monday, just like I was told by the manufacturer, and they were supposed to be delivered on Friday so I could re-ship them today. Here is the [DHL tracking](http://www.dhl.com/en/express/tracking.html?AWB=2456634832&brand=DHL). I got a phone call on Thursday from the customs to let me know the package cannot be delivered. I spent more than an hour talking to them for nothing. DHL simply had no permission to deliver and there was not going to be a change.

So they sent it back to the manufacturer, here is the [DHL tracking for the way back](http://www.dhl.com/en/express/tracking.html?AWB=3698705500&brand=DHL). It took me 2 days to get this number and it was supposed to be delivered back to them on Monday, today they changed it to Friday so I'll be talking to them again tomorrow.

I'm really embarrassed sitting here typing this for you, and it's just a fucking stupid situation, since the issue is really based of nothing. Escpecially this makes me feel like shit:

[quote="Toleg, post:56, topic:59619"]

100%

I should even start sending them next week but so far the manufacture is not giving me any updates. Let’s see : ) I’ll do my best!

Heatsinks have been sent to me with DHL today once again and to a different address. Expecting to receive them at the end of this week, hopefully with no issues!

Good evening!

Yes, got them in the post today morning, they look great!

![20180811_095654|690x335](upload://6EvhnZxcQS1MDyJw0IVndl48GqW.jpg)

I'll be re-packing them today. However, it turns out that FOCBOX's have different types of bolts. The old FOCBOX's have longer bolts than the newer ones:
![Screenshot_20180812-213947_Gallery|591x500](upload://9yqguHUhogA0wE2z9p0w6tpRShm.jpg)

So while all the dimensions are perfect, the thread length in the heatsink is not enough for the FOCBOX's from last year:

Would you like me to find the correct bolt length and send them with the Heatsinks to you, or would you like me to ship them tomorrow and you'll find the correct bolt size (only applies if you have old FOCBOX's)
[poll type=regular public=true]
* You can send the Heatsinks tomorrow, I'll take care of the bolts if needed
* Find correct bolts and send with heatsink (might take a long time).
[/poll]

Reason I voted to find the correct bolts is because when they are found it's likely they will be in 25 or 100 quantity packages

It's definetly more logical, and that's the best way to do it. Reason I offered these 2 options is because:

1. Some people might be using new FOCBOX's and don't need any other bolts
2. Everyone is fed up of waiting and just want to receive what they paid for ASAP

Here is what I mean:

![20180813_114849|690x166](upload://ln6bWXPoY3NjGqTJhVfSRMWOyQS.jpg)

The bolts on the old FOCBOX (left) just don't secure it enough to the Heatsink cause they are too long.

The bolts which secure the Heatsink to the enclosure are all the same and come with the Heatsink:

Sorry, don't get it. The PCBs look identical to me. So you are saying the old focbox (aka VESC-X) has a different layout on the bottom side and the riser studs are not tall enough?

![image|690x310](upload://u5MEG5Jt621FDa7aBVt1GJcq3Gh.png)


What's the length of the heatsink screw? I would like to order some stainless steel ones!

Cheers

## \#111 Posted by: BoostedBuilder Posted at: 2018-08-13T12:18:57.886Z Reads: 142

Yes, what you need is M3 x 6mm

@Schulerbible damn you have the design? It wasn't easier for you to get the heatsink made for you instead of waiting?

The PCB's are exactly the same dimensions, it's the bolts they come with. Old FOCBOX's have longer bolts, so they don't screw in to the stud you circled completely and so the PCB is loose. If you switch to shorter bolts, they will screw in completely and the FOCBOX's will be secured perfectly!

Makes more sense now?

I just went for a long drive, there are no shops around me with such bolts. So I'd have to order them, and they can take some time to arrive. I don't know how long.

Lol,why's that? The forces are minimal even a plastic screw would hold. I bolted my 4.12 Vescs onto a metal housing using acrylic screws. Titanium for this application is just a waste of money ....

The bolts posted by @high-roller are different. You would like to have DIN 7991 or ISO 10642 flat head countersunk cap screws for mounting the lid to the enclosure and DIN912 / ISO4762 socket head cap screw for the VESCs.

So you won't be using the Evolve case? You might want to consider [this one](https://shop.3dservisas.eu/collections/cases/products/dual-focbox-case-heatsink-plate) by @Kug3lis since it has a lip you can use for attaching to your enclosure.

You are correct, 2 FOCBOX's side by side and 4mm too wide for the opening. So you'd have to either cut a little piece off or sand it, which is possible but I wouldn't recommend it.

Got mine today! Thank you so much! Looks great, just need to cut my enclosure to fit it in properly! I would recommend putting some foam or neoprene underneath the caps to prevent them falling off due to vibrations (happened to my old Enertion Vescs after ++2000 km)

This looks fantastic!! However neither the short or the long FOCBOX screws fit. All of them are too long, so I'll have to get some shorter ones. :)

I'm finally getting around to installing mine! What did everyone do about the thermal pads under the mosfets? Did you transfer the one that was in the focbox or did you get new ones and cut them to size?

I transferred it but was SERIOUSLY considering replacing it.  Protip: put it on the FETs first, line it up, then stick it to the heatsink

Just to be clear, these last few posts are about original evolve heat sink that don't fit FOCBOX.  I definitely don't have any extra FOCBOX heatsink :smirk: but I think @hyperIon1 stocks them now
