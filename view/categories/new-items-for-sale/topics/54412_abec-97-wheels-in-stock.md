I got my wheels from this link and it looks like there's micro bubbles formation. Is this normal? Could these be counterfeit Abec 11 wheels?![20180519_091415|690x388](upload://yCz0UEDcnrlsTqJbuFWoVICU89z.jpg)![20180519_091431|690x388](upload://hL7e6UqBRMPHBczhDoOib0DTJ1g.jpg)![20180519_101542|500x500](upload://rQzVwcKBDKHRjtZgPk3uV8IQK4V.jpg)

I got a pair of 97’s and they have them too. I still think it feels kind of sloppy though. 

I’m no expert but it should be possible to avoid this right?

Ah, didn't consider EU bros. Free shipping is pretty good in that case.

It's still a good way to save a couple bucks for US customers as its free shipping on orders over $89
