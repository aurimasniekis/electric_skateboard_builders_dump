Hey guys I bought a few FOCBOX's during the Enertion sale and im selling 3 extras. I added an Acrylic Conformal Coating to every box to increase its durability to liquids and other debris, this **DOES NOT MAKE IT WATERPROOF** just helps with any leaks and may save your VESC. I will also include 3x 3.5mm to 4mm bullet adapters but if you dont want them just let me know and ill chop $5 off the price. Shipping is free within the USA only, not shipping internationally, sorry. Pics below are of the boxes and the coating under a blacklight. Also they have been tested and updated with the latest Ackmaniac Extended BLDC Firmware. You can find out more about the Ackmaniac firmware [HERE] (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/extended-bldc-tool-with-watt-control-mode-ppm-cruise-control-individual-throttle-curve-and-android-app) and you can check out my review of the FOCBOX using these exact ones [HERE](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/enertion-focbox-teardown-internals). Please PM me if your interested, will close topic when there all sold.

```
have you monitored temp with that conformal coating covering the FETs? Asking, cause I was recommended not to do this.

Yes actually I have, I just posted about my temporary findings of the thermal transfer of a single coat of conformal coating on the thread with my review. I found that a single layer of coating, as I expected, does absolutely nothing to heat transfer.

These look good the coating seems to help with protection with no transfer heat loss.
