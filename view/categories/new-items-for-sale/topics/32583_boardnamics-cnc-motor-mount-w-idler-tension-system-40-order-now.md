This is a followup thread for my original post where I got some feedback from others on my mount design. I am at the point now where I am ready to set up shop. For the past few weeks I have been cutting them non-stop in the garage, ordering parts, and refining my process.

Some cinematic shots

**Features:**
Machined 6061 T6511 Aluminum for low weight and cooling properties
Fits caliber II trucks only (more in the future)
Adjustable idler adjusts belt tension for reduced skipping
Cross motor hole design accepts **all** sizes of motors 
Stainless steel fasteners for longevity
Included 12mm HTD5M 320-325mm belt
45 degrees of angle adjustability.
Can be mounted in reverse

This mount was designed for maximum torque transfer while maintaining compatibility for many setups. The unique adjustable idler is a game changer. The use of an idler increases efficiency by requiring less belt tension for the equivalent torque transfer through your belt by engaging more teeth in the pulleys. It's ability to adjust position allows for a cross slot design for the motor holes. This mount can therefore mount all sizes of motors! In addition, it's angle adjustability gives a wide range of customization for your build. Strategically placed set screws lock the clamp in place. Loctite/threadlocker for all screws is recommended as always!

**Specifications**
Overall Dimensions: 148mm Long, 64mm Wide, 16mm Overall Thickness
Weight: 205g
Max Motor Hole Size: 32mm(Square) Ex. SK3 63xx; Minimum, 42xx motors
Max Belt Width: 15mm Wide

Basically, depending on your wheel size you have a greater or lesser amount of clearance for the idler. Check this chart for your build before buying. Refunds due to you choosing the wrong belt are bad. A lot more ratios are possible with different length belts, PM me first if you do not have any of the listed ratios, it will definitely work with a different belt which I will calculate for you!

**What's Included:**
Clamping Bracket
Arm Piece
4 M4x12mm Cap Screws (Clamp)
4 M4x8mm Button Head Screws (Motor)
2 M6 x 12mm Set Screws
1 M8 Bolt and Locknut
2 608RS Bearings
3 Washers (Idler)
HTD5M 12mm wide 320-325mm Long Timing Belt (See compatibility chart)
15mm wide belts coming soon!


**Ordering Details**
Everything you see above is $40 plus shipping.
Fill out this form to order yours today! [ORDER HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fpUTfxLVINytw6xFUTUn55uiq-WqjvtvwrIrgCWZ5IA/viewform?edit_requested=true)
I will send an invoice to the Paypal email you give. Don't worry about the fee, it's on the house!

I am located in San Diego, CA. I ship through USPS to the USA and International. I do combined shipping, so the shipping fee applies for the maximum number of mounts I can ship through that service.

Due to the frustration on the forum caused by delays in some purchases, I will only send the invoice to you once I guarantee I have the mount ready to ship. This means there will never be a time you pay and wait. Your mount should be at your doorstep within a few days after you pay the invoice I send. Your tracking number will be uploaded automatically on Paypal and PMed to you on this forum.

Thanks for checking out my post, I am curious to how everyone will like them :D

If you have any questions regarding compatibility, don't hesitate to comment or drop me a PM.

Mm thanks for the quick response. Can you clarify on the form if the "up to 5 belts" are in addition to the ones that come with the $40 complete mount, or total? Also if you could add belt price (if you know it already) to the form.

Oh and lol have you ride tested the prototypes? For how long?

Okay I think I got it how I like. You type the amount of belts you want in what size. There is no way to do it in on the multiple choice format.

The prototypes were tested for their dimensions, tolerance, and endurance of grip. I had one on my mini board for a few weeks of ridding and the clamp never moved.

Your design, presentation and detailed information looks really good. :+1: Will you be offering 15mm wide belts for sale, or any black or red anodized versions in the future? Or just the raw aluminum (which is still nice). And what's the center to center distance and largest wheel or wheel pulley you can fit without interfering with the idler? I'm wondering if they'd work with @psychotiller six-shooter wheels that come with either 42t or 60t wheel pulleys. Thanks!

The fixed Center distance is 90mm to make room for an idler.  I can make an order for 15mm belts too, but 122 should be enough especially with QN idler engaging more teeth. 42t pulleys should with on my comparability chart. A 325mm belt for sure.

Yeah, probably won't. I designed it to satisfy the majority of setups with only 2 belt lengths. I suppose I should order some 15mm belts. I don't have any 10" 184mm caliber trucks to try it with but by the looks of it, 15mm belts are compatable. The pictures are taken with a 9" shorter hanger not suitable for satellite eboards. The mount is quite thick but I did countersink the clamp screws so it should be good.

I don't have any resources to anodize them. All of these are handmade, I don't order them cut from China. I could look into it but from what I have read, you need some beefy equipment to get a very thick anodizing layer that actually lasts.

I would say you're best bet for anodizing "cheap" would be to find a custom car shop that does their own anodizing and have them do it

If you ordered a mount the expected wait time for your invoice will be sent is 5d.

Would any of you be interested in 15mm belts instead of 12? I'd imagine with an idler it wouldn't make much of a difference but the more the merrier!

Don't the TB caliber trucks have a different cross section for the hanger? They are longer yes, that is a good thing here. But I designed mine to fit specifically for genuine Caliber IIs. They might fit because it is not like a press fit tolerance but I can't guarantee it if I don't have one.

Hmm... I don't want to say it will and then have it not fit so I would say no to that one. By diameter are they talking about the top arc on the caliber shape or the overall dimensions in every direction are +1mm.

Torqueboard support is useless but by the sounds of it, its 1mm larger diameter. So if the stock calibers are 31mm these are 32mm. 

Also can you mounts be used for reverse mounted motors? I am really interested in your mounts.

There's a hump on the flat side of the TB trucks that needs to be filed down. 
If you file down the exact width of the mount, it should be locked in forever

Hi, I already ordered a pair of your mount. It looks awesome just base on your pictures. I'm planning on putting them on a 13-60 teeth pulley-drive wheel. What's your recommendation for belt lenght? I'm thinking about 375-15mm belt, please correct me if I'm wrong. Thank you

13-60, that's a unique one. What size wheels are you using? The possible belt lengths vary depending on the size of the wheel as they typically block the idler.

There might be an issue with my mount and those wheels. I didn't design them for massive wheels of that style, hmm...The head of the M8 bolt that keeps the idler bearings on might pose an issue for you. If I am right in saying that, your only option is to run the idler off and pick the right size belt from square one which I can help with

107 flywheels with what gearing? They're the biggest wheels they support. My comparability chart says 40T wheel with a 14-16T pulley. If it isn't that criteria I will calculate for you what you will need. I only have 325 and 320mm belts though, so you may have to source your own belt.

Sorry they didn't work with the other wheels, but I did a lot of sourcing for a better idler and nothing was as good as an M8 bolt and 608 bearings. Waaaay cheaper and so easy to source and replace. Who doesn't have spare 608s? Maybe next time

Grrr...those wheels are so big that the idler hardly has room to adjust the fixed center distance for the right tension. Calculated it for you, it would be very tight with a 310mm belt, and maybe a little loose with 315mm. My chart said 325mm for 40t/15t. :frowning:

Example with 107mm wheels. See how the idler can only slide so far before the bolt would intercept the wheel? The smaller the wheel, the more clearance and hense more ability to run smaller pulleys. Sorry there really is no design cure for this other than to use a different idler type. 608 bearings and a standard M8 bolt were by far the cheapest and easiest to source.

## \#62 Posted by: Boardnamics Posted at: 2017-09-13T05:25:42.352Z Reads: 315

```
I did, but what I found were 2 things.

1.As the center distance gets bigger, the less an idler has the ability to adjust the tension of the belt. Hard to explain but basically think trigonometry here. I tested my design with a longer center distance and change in belt required belt length actually got worse, I know weird.

2.The mount is already long w/ a 90mm center distance. Any bigger and I risk people having clearance issues with their boards. A longer mount is also more sensitive to alignment issues, again trig.

Best way to combat this is to source a different belt for abnormal setups. Besides, most mounts only support a narrow range of belts anyways, right?

Have you looked into using a Flathead Connector Bolt? That should gain a fair amount of clearance.
```

---
## \#65 Posted by: Boardnamics Posted at: 2017-09-13T15:00:33.747Z Reads: 286

```
The total bolt head clearance is limited by the distance between the belt and the actual wheel. Most people have their belts nearly rubbing the wheel which leaves not even those bolts to give any clearance at all. I'd rather not risk any wheel bite from a bolt anyways.

Flip it. If you're talking about the idler, it's tough cause it has to be on the top or bottom, can't be both. That said if you're running dual, one will help breaking and the other accelerating. I'm aware of that whole slack side idler idea. Shouldn't make much of a difference, didn't think of that.....

A couple of photos of the mounts with Torqueboards 6355 190kv motor and DIYelectricskateboards 36T drive wheel with 13T pulley and 83mm wheels.

The belt feels looser than expected but I cant feel slippage with the idler (which is at full tension).

Yeahhhh, about that. That came up recently. Basically one side is countersunk only of course, so if you have a dual setup they are flip flopped. I would have to make a mirrored version. Either way they work, it is all accumulative. Remember you break and accelerate. Its one or the other

Little update, not enough to be considered a whole revision. I have improved on several things. Here are the changes:

The bearing quality have been improved. I bought from a different supplier that are way better. The races are no longer plastic, they're metal. The rubber shields are actually rubber. They are much quieter and smoother, and have no rust!

The motor screws have been shortened as @Scepterr pointed out, the 12mm ones were too long and could short. They are now 8mm and torx to prevent stripping

The washers for the idler are now big M8 size instead of the non stainless tiny ones.

Here are some more pics of the new belts I received. No 15mm wide yet, sorry. Really though the difference between 12mm and 15 is minimal with an idler.

If you're worried about belt life, the extra bending is offset by the lack of tension needed to maintain the torque transfer ability. Also, I do sell them with extra belts available for $5, which is very minimal if you think about it.

What's the thread pitch on the set screws for the collar? I am going to try to find some hardened steel ones. 

Having a hard time getting my mount to stay in place. Iv'e tried red loc tite and everything. I think a clamping design for the collar might work a little better.

Did you let the loctite cure? Most designs with set screws require you to let let the thread locker cure for up to a day. You gotta really torque them down for them to work. They shouldn't strip unless your 3mm allen key is very worn down. They have a deeper hex because they're set screws.

My regular set screws actually already dig into the trucks a little. They leave a circle indentation.

Yep let it sit overnight. I had one strip out already. Brand new allen key(steel, cheap, but brand new). Yea i can see the indent when I take it off. But it always ends up rattling loose after less than 5 minutes of riding. 

I just feel like the two small set screws are not enough to hold it. I will try again tomorrow. It's just a bummer to have to wait 24 hours every time it comes loose.

If it continues to be an issue I will order some non stainless knurled set screws. They will be harder so less prone to strip and apparently help dig in. I am not sure how much it will do though. For now though you can do the classic fix like on the torqueboards one where you slip a piece of heatshrink on the truck and mount it from there. Mine have a little bit of play to make assembly easier. Some on the opposite side with no set screws will help the grip

I can't get it to stay mounted to the truck at all. My loss, your gain. . Mine came with a 12mm belt, but I bought a set of 15mm belts so I can give you a 15mm one with the mount if you want.

PM me $30 shipped anywhere in USA

I tested it on my mini board and it did not come loose. I ordered everything for my brand new board and that is where I will torture them as much as I can. If you are worried it will come loose, it will help to drill a shallow hole where the set screw goes. A lot of people do that with this type of mounting system.

I have a new design in the works though that uses that said 2 piece clamping system. I know what you are thinking though, "How does that help us mk1 buyers?" The arm piece will be compatible with the new clamp (and the new arm) as it will feature the same screw hole pattern. Once the new redesign is all done, I will sell the new design and give anyone who bought an mk1 an updated clamp for free.

Not only will the mk2 be a redesign, it will also be much cheaper. I am switching to clearance holes with a bolt running through with a lock nut on the other side, vs tapping the actual clamp. Much faster. They are going to be waterjet by a nearby service instead of machined by me. Expect the price to be around $30.

I don't really have an ETA because I would like to test print one first. The design hasen't quite been done before so it may take some work, but it should be rock solid as it will use no set screws, but big M6 bolts and a nylon locknut

The V2 clamp design is not quite ready yet. I am modeling it later tonight. After that I will cut the prototypes and test them on my newly made board. It should be extremely strong and 100% compatible with the old board style.

As for 15mm belts, those will be coming too. To everyone that ordered thus far has recieved 12mm as that is all I have. I buy in bulk and compatibility is key. 12mm works with 12mm pulleys and 15mm pulleys.

If I get the design waterjet locally instead expect a price reduction!

This is what you should all expect. Still tinkering a little but that is almost the "final" v2 clamp version. It should hold on really really good. Better than just about anything out there. It uses big m6 grade 10.9 fasteners and nylon locknuts instead of the softer stainless stuff. They are also being upgraded to 7075 T6 aluminum, which is basically the strength of steel. This should be bulletproof and I cant wait to get them made and tested.

The bolt holes are the same and thus totally compatible with the old style v1 arms. Everyone who has boughten my original kit will be given one of these for free, at the cost of shipping. It will really only be like $2-3. It makes shipping them easier too as I can directly ship them through paypal which saves me time.

It would severely weaken that side to have it hollowed out. Also, countersinking a nut especially with that design would be very hard to do. It would then have to be machined twice on different axis which would raise the price significantly. @grozniy The length from top to bottom is 63mm, diagonally the longest point is about 68mm. I don't think anyone uses below 83mm around here realistically so this should be good.

I bought two of your mounts and I have to say, despite not being able to fit them yet,  I'm impressed with the setup.

I'm keen to grab two of your V2 clamps but wanted to ask if it was possible to get it machined so that it fits the Torque Board extended trucks? IiRC they're the same shape, just thicker. I can send you measurements when they arrive if that helps?

About to cut my first prototype. It might be able to fit, unsure. If it doesn't it should be very easy to file down. There is so much clamping force that it should be able to hold even though it wont have a glove-like fit. I believe they're 1mm extra in just about every direction.

Did yours arrive yet? I have had issues with international shipping.

I tested the v1 on my own board yesterday and today, and it has been solid. I know that is no excuse for the designer to have success with the mount but yeah, I am liking it myself :D

Personally the truck clamps I have didn't work so great, but I think it's mostly because the profile on caliber II trucks varies significantly from batch to batch. I think the 2 piece design is gonna be much better. Looking forward to it.

This was the way I ended up securing the mount. I found drilling holes in your truck and sandwiching a piece of shrink wrap between hanger and clamp to work fairly well for the clamp piece but the motor plate kept moving no matter what I did. I used red loctite and even got longer bolts with lock washers and nylon lock nuts but it still ended up rotating down and scraping the motor on the ground. I ended up shearing off 2 of the bolts messing with it because of the loctite and just paid a guy to weld it. Also if you’re using 15 mm belts you will need a longer m8 bolt and extra washers to space the bearings evenly over the belt. I went with a button head bolt to reduce the space between the wheel and bolt.

About the bolt shear...maybe I should switch those m4 screws to 12.9 instead of a2 stainless steel too. It is a compromise really. They're basically twice as strong but they will rust eventually. Worth it?

I am not quite sure how important it is to have the bearings cover the entire width of the belt. With such a low tension, they are really only slightly guiding the belt along anyways. I suppose when you are accelerating or breaking though the tension for the idler rises as it pushes the belt in the fixed geometry.

Still though, I don't know how just having 1 bearing lets say, centered in the middle of the width of the belt would change much. It would increase the pressure on that width, (less area) but i am uncertain of that significance...

So I've ordered two for when I upgrade my board to a dual drive so using just the one for now. Finally fitted it on and I can see how the V2 clamp will help since the slugs can't take much torque without rounding off a bit.

Having said that, I was using the enertion mount prior to this and could only use about 50% of my brake throttle when on my board otherwise belt skips like crazy. I like to abuse my components and having an idler will definitely allow me to do this lol. Belt still skips at very hard braking but otherwise its much better (I can brake harder than before) and the added startup torque is significant. 

[Uploading...]()

Well done. Though now I'm curious about adding a second idler like the other thread selling these is doing. Definitely possible with the current mount and it might be something to look into once you've sold all your belts.

All the hardware is here. I have plenty of screws and nuts to make at least 50 sets. Finalizing the design and about to get sent to be cut. In the mean time I will try to "hold down the fort" for a bit by cutting my own and hopefully having them turn out okay.

What I can say upon my slight testing is that they grip extremely well....no way you can get this one off!

Okay, time for a little update. The design works good and I can definitely tell that there is a significant difference in how hard it clamps. Everything I need is ready but I really prefer to have these made elsewhere. I am sending the drawing to a chinese manufacturer I have been talking to on alibaba lately. I don't trust me $40 drill press with accuracy. So take this photo as a REALLY rough example of what is coming:

I know a lot of you have been waiting for a long time, but don't worry. I am ordering about 60 sets which should be enough for a very long time. Expect the time it takes to for fill orders to go way down as it takes me significantly less time now.

Yeah that sums it up. It is waaay cheaper to manufacture and they actually hold up better.

Not gonna like the clearance isn't as good, but it holds way better than the previous design. Unless you're running 60mm wheels you won't be scraping.

When running 83mm, my drawings show you still have a fair amount of clearance from the end of the bolt to the ground.

Anything bigger than 83mm is not an issue whatsoever. It also helps protect the belt. Better to scrap the mount then to shred the belt.

Couple weeks at most. I have been talking to many China manufacturers on alibaba about getting these cut. Have not heard back from any yet but I know I am close.

If worse comes to worst I will cut the new v2 clamps myself which is good and bad. My cnc machine I cut with is not mean't for production runs like this, but it may just work out. I will let you guys know. I know it has taken a long time but I assure the wait will be worth it!

Biggest issue I have is that the m6 nut that the v2 clamp uses is 9.8mm wide. 3/8" aluminum plate is just under at about 9.5mm. This causes a slight gap which really sucks. I need to source 10mm plate which could be hard. I will see.

I have been talking to this one guy that works for China, but isn't Chinese. Result is I get really good English and access to good suppliers, yay! He found someone willing to waterjet them out of 7075 10mm thick aluminum for me. 

Though I am questions whether or not I will start from scratch on the designs. There are a lot of things I want to change and honestly, it being backwards compatible is sort of holding any new designs captive.

My new plan for V2 may be:
Create a magnitude of different mounts for different setups. Some with idlers, and some totally without. Based on a totally different bolt pattern and everything
The backwards compatibility would be ruined and users of the V1 would get a partial refund or a discount on the upgraded ones.

Here is also a huge tip for you guys. Instead of using the included set screws, use big socket cap screws like these:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/1/a13caf378a8c17eb6dac2976457f3713c5f233e1.jpg" width="500" height="500">

The hex is 5mm instead of 3mm so you can deliver wayyy more torque into your clamp! I don't know why I didn't do this from the beginning. It looks a little funky but it holds extremely well for me.

Hope you get better ASAP. Broken jaw is a bitch and its why I got a full face.

I say go for it, part of being successful is being able to look at what you have, cry a little for the time put in, then put it all in a folder you'll never look at again and start over. 

Let us know of your progress :slight_smile:

Would anyone be interested in a mount that didn't have an idler? One that is simple and very easy to make but isn't too flashy when it comes to features. I may make a basic arm piece that supports 50mm and 63mm motors but has no idler and is designed for 255 and 265mm standard belt lengths. I think that would be a good addition.

It would be optimized for strength and simplicity. It would also be cheaper, maybe $30 if I get it real simple. No belt or idler would be included, just the clamping hardware and arm piece.

The clamping pieces are being cut as we speak. Hopefully they hold up so I can really push some orders. When they are done I can finish these motor mounts very quick. Maybe an hour each; fast.

I think the craze for idlers is a bit overblown. 

Shorter belts dont really need an idler. I mean, it seems idlers are meant for add tension in longer serpentine belts, which on esk8 doesn't seems to apply.

Late reply, yes they are reverse mountable. The screw hole pattern I put is symmetrical along both sides so the magnitude of adjust ability is equal.

Interesting....lol. Guarantee the next design holds so much better. It is also a stronger material w/ better tolerances. If you really want the v1 to hold better just use the bigger screws, it worked for me. I should of included them in the beginning they're way easier to get torque into.

Will somewhat work. Using a nut means the screw will inevitably vibrate loose. Even with loctite and a million pounds in torquing. It's better to thread the actual aluminum itself.

## \#223 Posted by: Boardnamics Posted at: 2017-12-04T08:05:28.124Z Reads: 209

Disagree here. The future use of nylon locknuts is preferred over threading into the aluminum. 1, aluminum threads are not as strong as steel cut ones and can gall up. 2. Nylon locknuts are cents a piece vs threading a piece costs more in manufacturing.

Nylon locknuts are made to prevent loosening under vibration. How do you suppose your wheels stay on?

Maybe 15mm belts...with the 2nd design I am coming out with I will not even sell belts for it. I will see how they sell first. I have a lot of choices to make.

I feel like if I go 15mm belts then there will still be ppl who want 12, to which it is not backwards compatible.

Along with an updated clamp piece will come with an assortment of arm choices depending on what you want. The v2 clamp piece will be compatible with all 3 motor mount type arms. The mounting holes for all 3 arm pieces are identical. You can swap them!
1. The original with the adjustable idler
2. Basic 63mm motor style
3. Basic 50mm motor style

Basic but effective and strong. No idler to fuss with, this will get the job done and for cheap. It's simplicity will bring down cost, so let me know if anyone would be interested in seeing this basic model. A base model and a v2 clamp should cost about $30! What a deal folks! Its center distance 70mm +-8mm so 265mm belts can be used.

For 63mm motors: (Havent finished the 50mm one yet but you get the idea)
