It is way to expensive. European customers purchase from some other sellers that were linked in the other thread.

Okay, not enough support. I took the helmet off the store and refunded the 2 people who ordered. 

If I get atleast 10 people say they are 100% confirmed I will reopen the store and allow orders

Maybe we can gauge interest for this again? I believe a lot more people would be interested now, considering they are sold out everywhere. I am in for 1 if this happens.
