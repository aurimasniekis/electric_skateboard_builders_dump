Love it, I have been looking for a set of these. Could you save me a pair for a week or so? If not can you have a set made when I need them? Not in a hurry.

Thanks, I'm only waiting on making up my mind with what drive system I'll be using. If i decide on a kaly gear drive I'll need the riser, otherwise i might go with psychotiller six shooters and trucks so i wouldnt need them.
