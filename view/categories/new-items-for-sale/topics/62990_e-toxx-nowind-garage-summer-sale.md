Oh man I've been wanting a set of A200S ESC's forever!  Damn... Are you selling only as a set or would you do just one?  I've been thinking about getting one for a jet powered surf board or hydrofoil...

I got a ebike build in the works.  I'm on his pre-order for the second version (1.3)of the A200S but.... That's tempting.

What's the difference between the v1.2 and 1.3?

What type of motor are you going to be using (I know it don't be an Esk8 motor).  Just curious cause I've considered building one of these.  What will you be running it at?  16s or 18s?  What type of battery will you be using and how big? Lol sorry for all the questions, I've just been wanting one of these for so long, they're like the holy grail of VESC's!  If money wasn't an issue I'd be running a 4WD with these with like 80100 motors, lol.  Anyways, sorry, didn't mean to side track the thread.  That is an incredible ESC though!

https://vesc-project.com/node/339?page=3

Changes outlined here. I may only go up to 15s as the motor is 225kv.  Ideally at 15s I'd like to burst 12kw. Constant is unknown because it's a downhill MTB and I don't plan on pedaling much.  I already have the bike and a12s6p battery, just waiting on motor kit to be built and shipped.  Then I'll be happily cruising at least 55mph on a bike or climbing a mountain with ease.

Awesome!  Man you have so much cool stuff!  Can the SSS 56-114 run on anything above even 12s, especially since it's a 390kv motor?  I was planning on using the A200S on like an 80100WC motor with a custom kv so hopefully a planetary gear wouldn't be necessary.  Though I have only been looking into those for a few months so I wouldn't be surprised if they require a planetary gearbox.  What kind of battery setup would that SSS motor require?

Edit:  I just Googled the Super Chief and its gone down a lot since when you purchased it.

The SSS can took up to 115 Volts, around 45000 rpm max
My plan was to use it on 12S Battery, something like 12S6P Samsung Q30 for beginning

The A200S was bought to be used with eATB with 80100 APS Motor on 16S (-;

Damn that would have been the most powerful setup!  Ok that's cool, so inrunners handle voltage better than outrunners then?  Tempting...

If you get them geared down properly its really tempting with the Inrunner concept.
Got 2 more SSS laying around for a eATB, :skull:

That would be perfect for a jet powered canoe!  Lol.  Gosh I wish I could just build whatever I wanted too.  Gotta get a CNC first I think, haha.  Oh well.  Ok so I'll check to see how much money I'll have soon and let you know about the A200S.  I started a thread like a year ago about how those ESC's would make the most powerful builds and that they'd be perfect in a surfboard or e-foil, unfortunately some people just started talking shit and the thread good closed... :frowning:

Did you ever get to use them in a build?  I imagine with the size of motors you can put on them you'd have an obscene amount of torque and definitely amazing acceleration and top speed.  Only down side is their crazy price.  The thread I started was to see if anyone could build the A200S like @Lukepl does with his ESCape's..  Surely it can't cost like $500 in parts...  I'm guessing maybe $200... But what do I know, lol.  It'd be worth it though!

No never used, 
the plan was to build the scariest 2WD eATB ever with huge Mefo Tires and 80100APS.
After my accident i´m not that much into building this anymore :joy:
When i bought them i compared to 340€ VESC6 price and 100€ more for more on Amps and Voltage seems okay.... but of course in the end for Dual build next to 1000€ only for ESC :roll_eyes:

@topcloud sorry but, we don't have a case for it, and I don't think so we are going to make it as it is not so popular... Plus internal design is complicated to make decent cooling solution.
