I have a couple brand new in the box 'sk3' 6374 motors for sale. I needed a few and I was under the MOQ. They are custom motors, Ive exclusively used these motors for 3 years now. They're pretty much the most powerful outrunner you can get and they don't look like shit

300mm sensor cables and phase cables 
5.5mm phase bullets
10awg silicone wire
Extended 40mm shaft 
8mm shaft dia
190kv
Jst mini 2.0 plug right into any vesc 

I'm selling them for $100 plus shipping. I should have them in 3 weeks.

are the sensors JST-PH 2.0mm? or those really tiny 1mm pitch ones that I commonly see.

These sound really awesome!  How much would it cost for one shipped to San Diego, California?

This would be for a single motor build with a 60kg rider, how do you think it would perform?  Would the side pull be too much to control or super noticeable?  I am also guessing that they do not have keyways in them? What do you use to attach the pulley to the shaft
```

```
I've been using a 6374 192KV for 6 months now, I'm 85kg with my gear but even when I was 97kg (my weight fluctuates because I fight competitively) the motor handled me fine though I'd need a lower gear ratio/second motor for very steep hills. Still, I see 32mph top speed regularly and I'd imagine you'd see more since you're lighter. 

My motor pulley has a grub screw to secure it so I drilled a hole in the shaft. For flat spots you could clamp the motor and take a dremel to it. 

I doubt you'll feel much of a push from one side of the board but a lighter rider would have to chime in here.

Yeah I have a dual 6355, this build is for my sister, wanted to go a bit cheaper than a dual drive, I am just wondering how big of a problem the pull is, if a problem at all.

Yea it would work. Shaft would be sticking out but it wont affect anything. And you could always get it chopped off later when you have access to tools. 

I could trim it down for you with an angle grinder too. I dont mind

Aight I'm down. I am also in need of the 12mm pulley, do you think you would also be able to grind a flat spot on the motor shaft? I could probably do it but I don't have an angle grinder, just a dremel

I can PayPal any time. Whatever is easier

Just double checking that this also has standard 6374 mounting holes? I have one of the mounts from the shogu group buy

I'm guessing it'll be largely price dependent. From customer's perspective (me), the differentiators are,

  - long shaft (fits 15mm belt pulleys comfortably)
  - sensored, plug n play with vesc, no sensor wire adapter
  - long wires, silicone phase
  - silver (not black)
  - more oomph
  - but hard to fit in dual setups
  - 190kv a bit tight for 12s

@deucesdown It'd be the same price. Maybe $115 shipped or something.  I run them on 12s all day on all my boards.

@Emerson Ill post back here if i order a bunch more. I'd do it if i got a couple preorders to lighten the load on me a bit.

Depending on price, I would stock them in the smallest quanties that it makes sense for you to buy. that way you will always have a few sitting around and if your selling out constantly you can raise your order quantity.  I vote for stocking these in the store 😉

Yeah, but a chunk of that is the internal fan thickness. That's why the bigger SK3's seem so much longer than other motors with the same nominal size.

Is the factory capable of winding a few of those motors with a lower kV, or does the whole batch have to be at 190kV?  Looking for 149 kV or 170 kV


149kV is awesome for 12S. In short, it let's you run a bigger motor pulley for better torque transfer (more teeth in mesh = more torque) to compensate for the lower kV

To be honest I messed up my current shaft when trying to grind down a keyway. I contacted HobbyKing and they said that’s the replacement shaft for the 6374 only was sold from the Asian warehouse and since I live in Sweden the shipping will be too expensive (like 18 Euro). Maybe I could buy a shaft with keyway from you? :slight_smile:

I’m going to quote out 50 motors. Not intending to make a profit on this order so you’re going to get the best deal. If you’re interested, drop a comment. I’ll make a new thread when more solid numbers are available.

I’ve literally submerged my motors in water, mud and a hell of a lot of snow. No need to be sealed when the motor is good quality

40mm was the old design. 

I don’t think that is needed anymore. I think the normal length is 25mm. Any complaints about that?

Ok just saying 26-26 is a good length for me. Doesn't mean I have to cut shafts for gear drives

Maytech is unsealed are 25- 26mm and SK3 is also the same

Last time i did custom shaft length cuts and flatspots. I can do the same this time. So ill do 30 with an option to cut down and flatspot.

Well im down for two if possible? 
 
No flatspot 30mm shafts would be perfect for me and my (20mm belt drive)
