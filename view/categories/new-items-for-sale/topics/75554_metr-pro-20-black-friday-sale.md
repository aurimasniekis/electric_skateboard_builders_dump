Is the shipping a flat rate worldwide? Sending from EU-EU should be cheaper no? Especially since it's just a small envelope package..

Yes, it is a flat rate worldwide.:earth_africa: 
The post company we are using right now charges the same for EU -> EU, EU -> US, EU -> AUS etc.

Thanks to everyone who already ordered in the last couple of days. :smiley: The demand is ones again higher than we expected. The modules from the first Black Friday Sale orders are already assembled and should be ready for shipping in the beginning of this week. Next step is adding heat shrink, (external antenna when necessary) and pin code on the back, flashing firmware, testing each module and afterwards pack them for shipment. Here a quick picture after the first assembly step.

All modules for the remaining orders are hopefully ready to be shipped end of this week.

**Please note that the 20% Sale ends on 25/11/2018 7PM UTC (** [date=2018-11-25 time=19:00:00 format="LLLL" timezones="Europe/Paris|America/Los_Angeles"] **). So less than 17 hours to go.**
