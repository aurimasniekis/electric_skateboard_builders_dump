Hey Guys, So I bought one of these from Amazon Recently and messed up shipping etc. Now I have two and only need one. Use it for charging or just whatever.

Im based In San Mateo, CA but will only be in America until the 20th of Jan. Looking for what I bought it for minus shipping is $55.50 USD.

If you want it shipped you can pay for shipping. Peace.
