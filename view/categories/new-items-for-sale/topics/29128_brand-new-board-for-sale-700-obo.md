Hey there I have a brand new board for sale, I need some cash on hand immediately and currently have this board sitting around uncompleted with not time to continue building. I'm hoping to sell everything together at the price at which everything costed me. I have listed the parts below, Hope to get 700 USD (or 850 CAD) + shipping  or best offer.

- 34 inch, 7 Layer Maple Deck
- 40 inch 9 layer Bamboo/Maple composite deck

I think you should part it,  

I would be interested in battery,

Wheels with all pulleys,

maybe even motor.

That mounting plate seems really thin, are you sure they won't flex like hell with high power?

Yeah you are right it is quite thin actually, but its not aluminum its galvanized steel. Can't vouch for the strength of the part as it has not been used but it was cut from one of these things:

Yea, I used 2.8mm stainless steel for a mount once and it flexes slightly back and fourth even under no load full speed. I would suggest using at least 5mm thick steel for a part like this.
