I've had these kits in my garage for a few months and haven't been used. I paid about £30 for them a while back and just decided to sell them as i never used them. I wanted to get about £20 per kit. What you see in the photo is what you get: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/2/72a0cce569fe070344d5f447d3186d7a4aa8ce96.PNG" width="511" height="500"> please pm for full details and postage etc

Dude @Charster10 you seem to not grasp the concept of spamming... its when you post the same shit multiple times with either the same or slightly different wording/context. Even if you may consider it to be different, it's still annoying.
