Dear fellow Europeans,

I am selling a bunch (three for now) of new, unused, sparkling, fresh Focboxes to anyone who is interested.
See prices below :arrow_down_small:

The price for each Foxbox contains a 15€ donation to Benjamin Vedder, the noble initial developer of this awesome piece of engineering and its software. (Proof of payment will be provided)

Oh and I can replace the bullet connectors with 5.5mm ones for 5€ per VESC.
