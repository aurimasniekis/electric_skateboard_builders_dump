Hey there! I've got for sale **the newest version of Maytech's sensored HUB MOTOR 90x55mm + Maytech's front wheels + Maytech's trucks: front and dedicated rear**. The entire set. All works fine, the Hall effect sensors too.

Shipping from Poland and so the EU import customs tax has already been paid by me so no additional taxes inside of the EU will be paid by the buyer.

Here's where I've bought it at Aliexpress: goo.gl/Vff2BL

They are **270EUR** (was 280EUR, was 300EUR) shipped inside of EU.

Thanks and greetings from Poland!
Paulus

edit: I know that this custom is not quite popular outside of eastern Europe but, you know, if you don't really feel like paying me those 300EUR write me with an offer you find more appropriate and we can haggle our asses off until we settle on a price that we're both more comfortable with, like

Why are you selling these ? Not happy with performance ?

You could say so - not happy with expected performance - and that's because I had no actual board to test them with, only VESC-Xes and a battery - I've bought them a couple of moths ago on the spur of the moment, not knowing much about diy esk8 building, and started educating myself only after that, and as it turned out just to figure that I'll be much better off with the modularity of a belt-drivetrain.

What speeds were you able to reach with them?
I was thinking about buying them but only 60kv? Not really tempting.

As I was saying in one of the previous posts, I didn't ride them. If I did, I wouldn't be naming the thread with a word "new", would I now? :P And if you think that 60kv in a hub motor is the same as 60kv in a brushless outrunner in a belt/chain drive, please do your homework before posting. I recommend starting with @laurnts review here: http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/electric-dual-hub-motor-disassembly-performance/2038

I'm pretty sure I've read in @laurnts thread that he was going up to 40km/h with these, and no wonder really, since the new Enertion Raptor apparently is 80kv. Pls correct me if I'm wrong here.

[quote="onloop, post:103, topic:12694"]
Its a 90mm wheel & 36v nominal voltage. we are targeting 45km/h top speed in FOC mode, so the KV will most likley be 80.

That'd be around 50USD, so we could agreen on precisely those 50, Bro.

I just realised I've never sold those and that I'd still like to... any idea how much should I ask for at this point in time? It's been quite a while...
