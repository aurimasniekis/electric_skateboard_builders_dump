Turns out i don't need one, never used, ready to ship. Retail price with 80mm axle is 179$USD.
Since shipping from Indonesia will be costly, i'm asking for 150$ + Shipping, and free press fit mount (it's a prototype and useable, it just not perfect for my setup)

Very Interested!  What is the purpose of the "Press Fits" ?  Motor Mounts for these Surfrodz trucks?

They are more precision and hold better than most of the clamp ones
