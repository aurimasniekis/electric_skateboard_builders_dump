got these 6355 190kv motors from torqueboards but decided to go up to 6374 since these 218mm trucks have enough room.

i was going to send the 6355 back but seeing if anyone needs them.  $85 shipped each, or $165 for both, within the US.  if no one needs them, will send them back to TB.

comes with motor, shaft key, and 5.5mm bullet connectors (male + female pairs).
