Have identical mounts been tested hard? They seem a little fragile in the middle..

hehe great, in fact this is not UNiK but it's more okp; I did that two years ago as I wanted to learn 3D and have fun on my own mounts. Then I created UNiK and redesigned my own parts starting from the blank page. These are AL7075. For the testing, they have performed pretty well in many conditions. For UNiK, I completely changed the design as I wanted to get the best footprint/minimalist but solid and flawless design whenever possible. The "f" come from Forum Snowboards as I was about to create Frame, which is basically what it is. A frame. Always been fan of Forum Snowboards before it went into all this burton mainstream nonsense. That's the story behind them. Cheers!
