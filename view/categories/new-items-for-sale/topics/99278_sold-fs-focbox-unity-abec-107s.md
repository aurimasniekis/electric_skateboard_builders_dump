How much for just the unity??  And just to confirm it is the new unity that acts as a BMS and has the most updated firmware and software with Bluetooth.

There is a pre-order wait list at the moment, so you probably could have sold it for more.

And you're on backorder with unity as I don't understand why unity can't keep up with their orders they're losing massive amounts of money.  But I asked in the beginning of the summer when I could expect to receive a UNITY.. and they told me not until September.
