So I have stockpiled a load of parts and just will not get round to using them. I bought them in bulk to lower costs but got hammered by customs on both occasions. I only want what I paid for them. All that is left is one set of Abec 11 flywheels 97mm 74a Â£100 a set ( 1 sets available) new in cellophane
Torqueboards 218mm trucks Â£65 a set.  ( 0 sets available 1 reserved @nadir35)  
All plus your desired postage at cost.

Looks like I can ship 1 set for Â£13 or 2 for Â£18. Such a shame to clock up this many air miles thoug!  Thought some of the UK/EU guys would fancy them!

@banjaxxed @GrecoMan @bigben

Thanks guys, I made a mistake, this UK site is Â£90 + Â£2.99 shipping... so.... @Ben, if you could do that I'll take yours otherwise I think I'll order from this site and hope they're legit...

I won't share the link here though until you've sold all yours Ben :thumbsup:

Yeah no problem with 2 part mounts,worse case scenario you would have to buy slightly longer bolts,the torqueboard trucks are 1mm thicker in circumference.

The shipping seems ludicrous. Â£26??? @Lobo I can ship but seems expensive? If you can find a better option I am all ears!

It' s a lot, yes. With the common mail service ( even with one month of waiting ) I guess the price is similar. Or not?
