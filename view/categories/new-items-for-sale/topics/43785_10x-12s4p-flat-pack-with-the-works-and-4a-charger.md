Lots of people are asking for Batteries (Spring is around the corner)so I thought I'd offer a great Value "production" pack.
If we can get 10 sold I can offer a 12000mah 60A pack with  Bms, 120A Flier Sparkswitch (I don't trust Vedder switches at 12s) state of charge Lcd and a 4A charger.
For 410$ these run 500$+ anywhere else.![20180101_221342|281x500](upload://A3yIBs8UckroJUxNHnSvYyQ2bbu.jpg) they would all look like this. 
50% is due at order and 50% at completion.
I will ship to anywhere in the world but if you order one and realize shipping is to much...your money is gone unless you sell it to someone else in a reasonable time.
These will be made in a manner that the battery can be removed and the charge port, button and Lcd may remain in the board without soldering.
