Do these have the slipping urethane problem? I think you should warn buyers about that

All previous modules of EmF,  and Jacob's hubs have a problem of slippage.  Im working on a harder urethane to make these motors aleast useable.  For the time being, you may easily see urethane slippage.

These are from original order.  Never installed them because of the poor reviews. Paid almost $400 for these, thats why I have them discounted.

There were a couple solutions available from @ralphy for the urethane issue. His nubs and sleeve option has been working well for me.

You can go with my sleeves or get the new harder urethane that i tested for the manufacture 2 months ago. Right now the new urethane is only available in blue i think. 

The motors are good and the urethane issues are solved, so buy with confidence.

I added my 3D printed nubs and never had slipping urethane in ~30km now. Took me maybe 10min to mount them with duct tape to the motor.
They are amazing motors, super stealthy and absolutely silent in FOC.

Ralphy the urethane was no good. So far I'm personally up to 80a with some modifications 
To the actual rotor and a Friction tape to grip the urethane. This aslong with your 3D printed nubs are the only good fixes so far.

Guys the new rubber that doesnt slip which i tested last year is in production for these motors. It doesnt slip and DOES NOT require knubs or sleeves or glue. Slip in on and go. Yesterday i was told they are being done in the original size in blue and orange and are ready starting Feb 5th. 

Thought you might like the good news, I'm sure Jacob might be able to help you guys on the other side of the world but if your in the US i'll be happy to lend a hand getting these out to you at no profit.

Stickler for detail the first batch was sold about 2 years ago to me.  Maybe this is the first batch with a nice box and foam.
