i was gonna say that NKON europe has 'em for 3.75 per cell, but that's euro's of course. 3.99 USD is about 3.57 EUR so that's indeed pretty cheap

ru.nkon.nl has them for â‚¬2.64  in 10-off quantities right now, and they're solid- I've bought over 200 cells of various types from them.

I just received my batteries from NKON yesterday. Here is the **real** cost for whoever is interested:

50 x Samsung 30Q at **â‚¬2.64 each**

â‚¬132(batteries) + â‚¬30 (fedex shipping) + CAD $52 ($11.30 fedex fee, $40.7 duty and taxes).

### Final price for 50 x 30q ended up being

`EUR 196.67 == USD 219.55 == CAD 295.81`

### Final price per cell
`EUR 3.94 == USD 4.39 == CAD 5.92 `

Order Date was March 30th, order was posted to Fedex on April 23rd, received order on April 26th. Very long wait time considering you are paying 30 euros for shipping and the final price turned our much higher then expected.

Maybe, but I've ordered batteries from China before and didn't pay any import fees (they didn't ship through FEDEX). 

NKON declared the exact value of the batteries so that's probably why or maybe because it's FEDEX.

Itâ€™s fedex and itâ€™s Canada. We get ultra hosed on shipping up here my man. Thatâ€™s unfortunately how it is when your country is huge and thereâ€™s less than 40M people populating it. Costs more to move shit around up here. FedEx makes sure they get paid. So does our gubmint. That said, around 5$/cell isnâ€™t half bad. ðŸ¤“

I'm confused, you expected a legitimate business who pay taxes and rely on reputation with customs officials all over the world to illegally declare a lower value on your batteries?

Yup cheapest I could get cells to Canada just last year worked out being 6.15 a cell after shipping currency conversion and duties. 

And that was with a minimum order quantity of 100 cells soooo yeah. This price is pretty great, and if you wanna go through the effort you can save yourself about 100cad by declaring the package to customs yourself. Need to take a trip to your airport most likely though.

No, I'm very new to the internet. This is my first foray into online purchasing.

Nkon ships internationally on a B2B bases to massive brands, as well as selling to us on the side. What was the point of your message there?

I agree, `USD 4.39 == CAD 5.92` for 30q is probably still the best price you can get them into Canada. I do hope they can find a better way to ship to north america in the future paying 30 Euros for Fedex and waiting a month is rough.

Honestly, if it's even a concern why not go with a more well known source? You guys have loads of options over there. Speak to Mike, Tim, Brian and the rest and see where they are sourcing from?

If you are not in a hurry and can wait a month I think NKON will be the best price, specially if you are in the US where others have reported not paying import taxes/duties:
