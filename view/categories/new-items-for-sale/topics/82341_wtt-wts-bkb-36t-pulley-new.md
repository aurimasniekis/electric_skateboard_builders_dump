I have two brand new BKB 36T pulley. I thought they are alright for 107/110mm wheels. But later found out I need 40T for the top speed and torque of my needs. I want to trade my new 36T for 40T in decent condition. I will pay for shipping as well. 

If no one wants to trade, It's for sale with complete hardware, support bearing and kegel core adaptor. 
Thanks!
Edit: location: Southern California, US only.

Good luck. I've been waiting for @JLabs to get the 40t in stock. They are like unicorns. Hard and/or impossible to find. He said he'll have it in stock at the end of this month.

funny, I'm in the exact same boat. thought 107s would be fine on 36t after upgrading from 90s. i was wrong ðŸ˜‚ the torque is so much less

Yea, I know. All my belts and motor pulleys are 15mm. So there's no turning back now. Way too much 15mm crap.

I have BKB 40T ones but only the pulley part, I don't have the abec nor Kegel adapter. It's for sale if anyone's interested. 2 pieces. Was gonna use it for an upcoming build but I think I'll go for bolt on ones
