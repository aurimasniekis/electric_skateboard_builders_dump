Looks really good indeed! This should able to get ready to go package in one go.. no need to fabricate seperate adapters!

What weight single pulley have? I guess it could be somewhat more heavy than aluminium ones? 

Yours look on the thick side

another great item and price from dicky! turn key with the metal pullety to peeps. Still loving my cheap ass setup..

not to mention if you get a flat tire this is way easier to change.... may have to spring for the pulleys as well... with the cheap ass... the pulley fits to an adaptor which makes a tire/tube change an afternoon event

Hi there Dickyho.

I waited for the pulleys to order the longer motor Mounts and the pulleys together. Would want **2 of the pulley sets (without tires)** and **2 of the long motormounts for Kaliber Trucks**. :) ..

Woudl the shorter Motormounts also be OK with these Tires and TB218 Trucks? Would want to keep the distance between motors and Truck Axle is as short as possible without getting into problems with motor pulley touching the Tire... 

Thanks in advance
```

Hi. if use short mount, the motor pulley or the motor shaft will touch the wheel.

Nice! I am curious to see the condition of the 3D printed adapters. So do you have an estimate of how many KM you might have ridden on them? Do post pics, here or on the cheap ass wheels thread.

Skeet skeet... So.much easier getting a belt on with no lip... Also testing out 20/60 gearing. Will send adaptor pics later but they looked great... Cant estimate how many miles used but i ride a lot regularly so they got good use!

@dickyho so a question? i didnt notice this till now since all the regular pulleys I own are yours as well... and all my TB hangers have been shaved down to accommodate the smaller hole on those but is there a reason on these AT pulleys you didnt widen the hole a bit more for TB hangers? since theres so much extra material it couldnt be anything structural right?

i only found this out recently as ive been doing "damage control" after my accident. My hanger ended up getting bent and was going to swap an unshaved hanger in and then discovered this... thx.

probably would yes...BUT on a 218mm hanger there aint no extra space available for a bearing before the main set. It literally just fits on the axle with a few speed rings and thats it so....

Does it need that bearing? I get the impression the load is pretty well supported against the rim

Edit:at least on the solid set

Well, in my case I do use speedring, bearing, speedring inside the pulley. I need the offset anyways and having a bearing to add more contact surface is preferred, instead of using a thin spacer or speedrings. I think I saw an extra bearing being used even on simple pulleys for urethane for the same support of load reason.

@accrobrandon 

![image|477x500](upload://hp9EfSQprJryu70CzPBIqUy9qm0.jpeg) 

6x2 pneumos with bearings inside the pulley, with two extra speed rings. And well everything fits. How your wheel placement looks like? Did you push the bearings fully in? Some of the rims had the bearing sitting 1mm out! Requires new spacers for full pushing in though. Original spacers are WAYY too long.

This is older photo, with printed pulleys and older idlers, but offsets are straight the same. 

400mm length 15mm width belts, 15T steel motor pulley (also from dicky), 60T aluminum pulley(from this thread), new idlers which you can buy together with the mounts from dickyho. :slight_smile:

Closeup of how tight everything fits, but it fits:

hmm..maybe its the OE spacers but the bearings seem to sit flush.. plus theyre pressed in from what i read so I never tried removing them (these arent the dicky tires BTW) ... but as u can see thats all the thread I got left and if i threw a bearing on there for good measure you can see where it falls short..

This kit almost completely suits what I need. I'm unsure why this is tradition kingpin and not reverse.  Can someone fix my ignorance?  Would these function well on an electric Longboard? What benefits and negatives would this kit have over an equivalent reverse kingpin setup? 

And for dickyho: Do you make this kit with an equivalent wide reverse kingpin truck?

So I can either get the smaller rkp ones and spend extra on more motors , or use this wider option at a cost to high speed control?
