Hey guys!

Bought two of these beautiful dual idler mounts from @marcmt88 a month or so ago, but didn't end up using them for my build.
One of the two is completely untouched, and the other one has been on 2 short rides.

Comes with:
- All the bearings you need 
- 5 320mm 15mm belts

My asking price is 145 euros
Shipping would be from The Netherlands
