_**1 enertion left**_ 2/1/17

**For those of you who got one, if you have any issues, please PM me before you post here. This thread isn't for troubleshooting or flaming.**

One of the ollins is untouched still in shrink. All the others have the wiring harness desoldered. Most haven't been powered up, but I can't remember which. They all work and will tested to be double sure before I ship.

I only used 3 or 4 as bench tests. I believe one had an issue but it was just solder bridged from gate to source on one of the fets.. removing the solder fixed it but I don't have time to go through them all to test unless they are spoken for..

These were used on bench only! I actually have 9 total but was going to keep 2 but I might sell those if you want them.

At one point I was considering using these for beta prototypes of an upcoming product. I may still offer them as an option but for now I rather wait and see what the new VESC platforms do.. also it seems the form factor is changing. and could continue to change.

edit: @Plumb77 actually the real reason is that I only needed 3 plus spares but enertion was backordered so I ordered both to see which would get here first.

so i finally got around to messing with the 2 Enertion VESCs that i bought off Trillium

The first one i soldered the power leads , plugged it in . it lights up fine but does not read in BLDC at all

The second one i soldered the power leads , plugged it in . it reads fine in BLDC , so i continued to solder on the motor leads and bullet connectors , connected to a few motors to test and each time i get a failure. checked the logs and it's the DRV_8302 fault , which from what i have read on here sounds like the DRV chip if fried??

anyone else have problems with theirs ?

Got three more if you continue to have problems I got you covered.

Check that there is no solder bridges from the gate to source pins on the fets

Hey Trillium,  thanks for the reply!  It looks like you're right,  in both cases it looks like i got some solder on the fets in front of the - power lead .

any recommendations to get it off?  assume i would attempt to heat it carefully with the soldering iron and push some of the solder off if possible.

any help is greatly appreciated thanks

Buy a weller 80W+ soldering iron or a hot air reflow gun and solder wick.
