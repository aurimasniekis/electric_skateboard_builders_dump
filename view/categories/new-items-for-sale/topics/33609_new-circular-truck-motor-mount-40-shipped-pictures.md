Hey guys, ive been working on this for a little while now (you can see my sketches are all MK6 :) ) and I think I have finished or have come very close to finishing the design.  I will 3d print everything tomorrow as a test fit, if all goes well I will mill two out of alu 7075 (one for me and one for @psychotiller)  once testing is done maybe I'll do something like a group buy depending on interest.

Well... I attached everything BUT, the motor mount holes were off by a few mm, I realized the clamp won‚Äôt work in aluminum so I‚Äôve decided to completely redesign the entire thing...

The round clamp might not be sufficient to keep the mount from rotating about the hangar

But maybe I'm wrong

The clamp is to keep it from sliding on the axle, the two set screws are what keeps it from rotating

[poll type=regular public=true]
* I‚Äôd be interested in one
* I‚Äôd be interested in two
* I‚Äôd be interested in three or more 
[/poll]

Cost would be somewhere in the ballpark of $30-$45 per mount including hardware (and maybe a belt)
Just a survey to see if there would even be any interest in something like this, obviously I will build one and post some videos and pics and send one to @psychotiller so you all know I‚Äôm not lying 

I would be selling through an adult on here since kids like me have a bad rep thanks to @Alextech...

The problem you'll have is that when you clamp down on the clamp itself, you're moving where those three screw holes are by sometimes a significant amount. Then, when you try to bolt/screw the actual mount to it, the holes won't line up.

What you need is to make those holes (in the mount plate) a little oversized or oval, to compensate for the movement whilst being clamped.

Also, and I've said this so many times, milling 'teeth' to the inside of the clamp will help it stay in place when clamped to a round truck.
```

I‚Äôve thought about all those things, I do like the extended holes idea though.  As for the teeth, I think your referring to the things on the Hobbyking motor mounts,  the two knurled stock screws should be enough.  Also the clamp shouldn‚Äôt be tight enough to move the holes out of alignment
```

That's my point, you could do away with the set screws if you had teeth and the clamp was really tight...

For the side where the holes are slightly oval, as well as a standard washer, you'd need one like this directly against the mount plate to zero any movement.

Ok. You might want to think about the tooth design a little with regards to this flat spots on the inside. That would require a really small bit to get that intricacy. However, if you had a larger bit (that's obviously round), you could basically make it drill/mill the holes side by side and that would effectively leave 'teeth', more like tiny flower petals. (See my sketch above).

If it was done a bit like the alien Power systems mount, you could have an inner ring for caliber and a different one for Paris and keep the rest the same. But! The ring, on the outside and where it meets the clamp, should have splines like a drive shaft or steering column, so you could choose an angle to suit you.... ;)

Obviously the inside of where the outside of the ring goes would have corresponding splind grooves....

Are you not concerned about the little material left around the tap? Also, have you thought about how to machine the teeth? There is hardly any radius visible, not sure how to manufacture this cost-effectively on a mill!?

These will be milled by my personal CNC machine so cost isn't relevant, I will use a small bit.  As for the little material around the set screws/ M8 bolt, it shouldn't matter cause there is so many threads for the set screws to grab on before they hit that point.  The M8 bolt is bigger in that picture than it will be when shipped.

Wouldn't a M6 screw be sufficient?


A simpler profile could be something like this:

Think simpler:

1) create a solid model of the annulus
2) make new sketch and draw a circle which you change to a construction line/circle
3) place a smaller circle on that construction circle
4) extrude and remove the small circle from the annulus
5) use circular pattern to repeat the pattern

Done

I think this was a great idea! One of the motor mounts I sketched up used the same idea. You mount the screw from the motor plate side into the chunky clamp, where enough thread is available. Don't require the countersink and it looks a bit nicer ...

Stupid design on the right side, just ignore that :slight_smile:

On your clamp ring. There's too little material left between the thread (m6?) and the outside of the ring.
And It looks like (not sure, could be the shadow) you have threaded both upper and lower side of the screwholes that clamps the mount. Only thread the bottom part and drill the upper hole ~1mm bigger then the thread.

Other than that. Sweet mount. What cnc mill do you have? I'm so close maxing out my credit cards and get myself an Xcarve

hopefully doing my last redesign but that was an M8 thread, I will probably be stepping that down to an M6 though.  Both sides are threaded, I'm not sending it to a factory like that, it was just a reference to me since ill be tapping and drilling everything by hand

If you have both sides threaded int wont clamp down the mount.
And id you can go with a m8 go for it. :) just be sure to have about 5mm material left between outside of the thread

Approximate Caliber II profile measured with a tapeline (let me know if you need it more precise)!

Not so sure whether this will work. It depends how deep the profile penetrates into the annulus and the internal diameter and maybe other things as well ....

If you still go with the teethed design, having 11 of them don't make much sense as you will overconstrain the assembly. So, really what you are looking for is something like this but you have to ensure that nothing rotates:

This is kinda what I meant with the teeth. Reason being is that on a completely round truck, it gives it the chance to dig in to the meat of the truck to keep it's position, whereas a perfectly rounded surface will inevitably slip at some point...

Hey man, can I offer a suggestion?  I know you are strapped for cash, but I would recommend holding off accepting orders until you have the mount machined and tested.  Once you get it milled, you probably will need to make some revisions. Speaking from personal experience, it took me two iterations of both the mount and clamp to come up with a solid design that didn't slip.  Something that works perfectly on the bench and feels completely secure might fail in two blocks (like mine did)

It doesn't seem like you are very close to having a final product.  You mentioned using a local machine shop, but I think you may have a hard time getting them professionally machined while still meeting your $40 shipped price.  Have you gotten quotes yet?  Machinists are more expensive than you might think

Do you happen to have access to a waterjet?  It would be a cheaper alternative to CNC milling

haha yea haven't taken a dime from anyone yet.  I think the clamps will actually be done on a lathe.  Little do you know this is Clamp MK19 and Arm MK27 :wink:

Milling can be done quickly and easily since I have access to tons of things (lathes, cnc, manual mill, laser cutter, 3d printers).  Machine shop was only mentioned in the case that I get like 50 orders or something crazy.

I also know holes can be done with the mill but it would be crazy hard to get a perfect circle using a manual mill...

Alright peeps.  We are making progress, slowly but surely.  I have decided to use the schools lathe for making clamps, should be much easier than a drill press and can be accomplished in 2 cuts.

thinking of using that to cut the outer diameter and a run-of-the-mill (pun intended) 18mm drill bit for the inner clamp part that fits over the truck.  The other three holes will still be done with drill press but they should be super easy

OH MY GOD!
yesterday I had to clear off my desktop and in the process I accidentally permanently deleted a lot of folders, one of those folders being the one with all 34 versions of the arm and 27 versions of the clamp in it...

I have a good idea of what they both look like in my head so I should be able to reproduce them pretty easily, nonetheless, I'm still pissed

turns out my files were part of this:

You may be able to find the files in the hidden recycler folders if they didn't permanently delete.

Go to C:/Recycler and check for the file there. You will have to enable: view > Options > View > Show hidden files and folder. Also uncheck the "don't show system files or folders" box.

I used Inventor for 4 years. Got to university and switched to Solidworks. It's 100 times better, just give it a shot if you get the chance.

edit: Actually if you email solidworks really nicely and explain what you're doing and that you're a student, they may give you a free license. I know people that have had success doing that.

feel like I owe you guys an apology (and an update): this is taking **much** longer than expected to complete the single prototype mount for me. good news is, the prototype arm is almost finished, clamp is quick and easy on the lathe with 1 milking operation.  I will let you guys know right now that these will not be perfect. Everything is done by hand, I cut them on a band saw, mill with a manual mill and finish them with tons of different hand tools. They will obviously work and i have made extra sure that all the necessary holes are made at a very tight tolerance (motor mount holes, part that mounts to the clamp).  More good news: once this first mount is done, they will be able to be made much quicker than this. It is taking so long because I need to have someone to teach me the machines and they are not available often (hence the 28 day break). Once I learn the machines, I will just need any old person to supervise which should allow me to be there atleast 3 days/week. each mount should take about 3 hours each.  anyways, here is a picture of the current state of my prototype.

thanks bro! not gonna lie i have gotten a bit annoyed with how long it‚Äôs taking but i‚Äôm glad i‚Äôm learning the machines. plus, now I have the skills to take with me for later in life. making these down to the 10th of a micron is definitely not necessary but really opened my eyes to how precise manual tools can be

If you can be the guy who not only designs something, but can then manufacture as well, you're opening many promising doors for your future. Mix that with some entrepreneurial spirit and you'll be owning shit!

Hey,

I saw in another post that you were looking for the dimensions for the Caliber II Trucks to ensure your clamp fits properly. Do you mind sharing those truck dimensions?

Thanks,
