How big is the basic receiver ?
And do you mind sharing the STL file for the enclosure, so we could testprint, and se if it fits nicely in the hand ?

Do any other DIY purchasers from the USA want to go in on a group buy for the additional components? Seems most of the extra parts can only be purchased in quantities ranging from 5-20 units (resistors, hall switch, JST terminals, etc).

If I have One that came with the basic receiver can I update and buy an advanced receiver from u so as to use the light feature?   And if so, Do you have any extras so as I don’t have to wait for 2 round?
