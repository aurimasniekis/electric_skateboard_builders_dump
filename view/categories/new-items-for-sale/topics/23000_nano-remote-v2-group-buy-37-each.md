The new nano remote is out, some sellers are quietly replacing the winning with these.
Found a supplier for a quick gb the prices are as follows:

1x v2 remote  = $37 + shipping
2x v2 remotes = $72 + shipping
3x v2 remotes = $108 + shipping

US Shipping $7 2-day priority
Other shipping ask with location and qty..

I have one of these for testing. My 2 concerns:

1- can take an extremely long time to pair. 1 time it pairs instantly, the next it dosnt at all.

2- there is no sleep or auto time out. I have accidentally left it on multiple times only to try and use it again but the battery is dead and the switch in the on position.

I also paid a lot less for it, direct from the manufacturer.. :thinking:

the first one sounds like a bit of an issue....but hopefully its isolated..

maybe its cheaper to just get 1 directly but the cost has the bulk shipping and fees split into it, still much less than retailer's markups...

I also blew a resistor on the receiver, it was very odd... powered by the VESC. I had them send me a new one and haven't used it much again.

same as above. 44 with fast shipping, or 40 with regular. (in the us)

or we could wait to try to hit the bigger discount numbers.. there are 12 ordered in the 3 days
but I think I can just do another bigger buy if there is more interest after this..

what do you guys think? people who signed up only please..

no time estimate tho, priority is 6-10 days but $32..

this is the price I've been getting for most places in Europe.

if you get more than 1 remote, then its $1 off each. from the taxes and fees and whatever...

the sign ups have slowed, I don't think it would be worth the wait. 
But **Its still open** till all the payments are in and I place the final order.

If you signed up already, paypal to saulc89@gmail.com

I didn't think about it, but if someone in eu wants to order like 10 and ship them out locally, that would probably save everyone some $$, and save me alot of time in figuring out customs bs.


Also I noticed a couple of you are local in so cal, one even in riding distance! 
So let me know if you want to just pickup from LA.

@jaysoncena yes its open. shipping is 12.60 for first class, or $31 for priority (faster with tracking)

@do_a_kickflip priority is 2/3 day, or regular is some time. This is of course after I get them. which will be at least a week after I get all the payments and close off orders. I plan to cut off in the next few days.

ok so I have a little over half the payments. looking good.

but a few of you did not account for the paypal fee. partially my fault for not being clear. but like @MrHappy said, if you use friends/fam with your linked account or balance there is **no fee.**

so for everyone else, please do that or add the appropriate amount.

If we hit another discount i'll refund using the same method, **after** they are shipped and i'm sure I didn't miscalculate on some fees or taxes or something. I'm not making any $ on this, and sure won't be losing any! :sunglasses::money_mouth:

for the paypal fee, you can try the method above, or enter the amount, check the fee on the confirm page, then cancel, add the fee amount, and redo. I know its a pain.

@Crushkrew I'm looking at the numbers now. 

Heres what I"m thinking!
----------

i'll just take a few extra remotes myself so we get to 30!
i'll use a couple of these as **Warranty replacements**  in case someone gets the short straw and ends up with a DOA remote.
and the other will be sold after for profit. like $45 or something to be fair for all of you that got in early.

finally assuming I did not miss any fees or taxes(I might have forgotten tax :money_mouth:) 
i'll refund the difference of $1-3 or you can buy me a :beer::beers: because I think i will need a few when i'm done packing all these...





----------

So Last Call, sign up and pay BEFORE 5/26/17 NOON Pacfic Time!

or pay more later...

actually they did give some details. 
Extra anatenna + 30m range + 500 mah battery + auto pair + reverse funtion.

@Jinra good find. i wonder if that seller saw this and ordered some lol such random items.

I got this remote (ordered from ebay) yesterday and I can say it's very ergonomic. Looks a bit weird, but fits in the hand perfectly. Throttle travel is the same as the winning v1 and the reverse button is easy to press and is very clicky. Receiver looks to be the same as v1 as well, or very similar.

Haven't tested functionality yet but I'll post a new thread later about it.

Ok @Saul I can see you have been online here and would have seen notifications so there is a question to be accountable for.

I will have to assume that you are not deployed or tied up like Shogu12 in the middle of the desert with an execllent excuse otherwise please post up a pic of yourself strapped to a cruise missle or such.

Therefore which is it?
1. Either do not intend keeping your end ot the bargain and are going to stiff a few people.
2. Have been quietly taking in more orders so to acheive the breakpoint price for 50 units and nab a few extra dineros 
3. You are getting in the remotes piecemeal and farming them out to people in order of payment
4. You sent it, "what you didn't get it?"

(1) is not ok
(2) is only ok if you could show a little responsiblilty to the people whose money you have with some kind of announcement of where this GB stands?
(3) See (2)
(4) Can I get a track number or proof of post to Ireland please

Okay, that's it. Enough is enough.
I PM'd @saul two days ago asking for an update, and I gave him a  two day ultimatum in which to respond with either an explanation and an update on my order, or at least a refund. 
No response. 
I don't know what the deal is, and after two weeks of utter silence, I'm done.
I'm planning on filing a claim with PayPal, and I might also complain to the admins and request... I don't know what from them.
Far be it from me to bash someone I don't know personally, and who knows, maybe he does have a good reason for not responding, despite having been on the site in another thread _after_ his last response here.
Regardless, I've read enough here this week alone about sellers who suddenly can't (or won't) fufil their obligations to their customers. 
Making mistakes, or even getting in over your head is one thing, at least own up to it. People tend to be more forgiving if they at least know what happened and see some kind of apology (and compensation, if necessary)
Ignoring your customers, taking the money and running does nothing positive. All it does is make people trust each other less and hurt our community as a whole.

If you dont trust saul you can ask a refund and then PAY AGAIN with good and services option. 
The delay for the remotes does not seem exaggerated so leaving now would just be a sneaky move and you would be the one at fault.
On the other hand @saul should give daily updates or at least respond to others' concerns.

My stance is based on the absolute fact that saul's a/c showed that he was visiting here almost daily. Given that the site has a dynamic notification interface, you get a alert on your profile icon there is no way to not notice - cellphone/tablet/pc whatever.

To say that this was unnoticed by a person who would seem to design these type of forum interfaces is ludirous; he saw the notifications & he chosse to ignore them, not even quell it with 'sorry folks still waiting for delivery'.

I'm sorry trust level zero here...I would like my money back before my remote goes bye-bye in the post or such.

Yes it really does. 
And when you do a group that Gets delayed and then have to on the fly figure out how to manage PayPal refunds, pay for shipping remotes, resell a bunch of remotes and ship those too and all while so cal is hit by a 💯 degree heatwave. 

So besides the fact I now have to deal with 2x the number of transaction because some of you are a bit impatient.

The timeline for this was pretty general, a few weeks to get the remotes, after they were all paid for. Then a week or two for me to ship them.

I guess a new rule for group buys is is post every day even when it's just to say that's that's nothing to say because it's only been one day. 👽

Please try to remember I'm just someone who was trying to help you all get a remote for a better price. I could have easily got one for myself and saved all the shit talk that I don't  I have time to read...
If you want it fast, pay diy $60+sh. Or the eBay guy. 

Otherwise please relax and give me some time to figure out how to track all this shit and make sure there are no issue shipping. 😵

That's to the holiday I've had the remotes for only 8 days, sorry if I couldn't go hang at the post office for a few hours yet.

In fairness the one and only thing that caused me & others concern is that your profile said you had visited yet choose not to make any comment for weeks let alone daily. Nobody asked for daily updates at all afaik.

To me although yes ok you are not a scammer, but maybe it's fair to say that you are bloody-minded enough to not really care enough to say 'chill' - 5s of your time. Sure there's not much or any profit margin apart from the advantage of bulk buying/discount, safe to say when you have the money of a large group of strangers maybe a tiny shoutout once a wk would suffice,I maybe a newbie here but that would make sense.

Maybe if the site admins decide on GB rules that would be a good communication protocol. Yes shit takes time to manufacture and ship from China, but a 'chill' post once a wk X 8 is not a huge ask.

In the meantime I have picked up another few other types of remote - mini/nunchuck/maytech, I am 'chill' to stay in the GB even though I said I would like to leave, I am interested to know how this pans out, an experiment of sorts.

 Hey Saul how many of these do you have on hand right now? How many people have backed out filed complaints etc.? 

I know what a pain in the ass multiple order coordination and pre-orders can be it's overwhelming right?

I'm in for at least three but if you give me a number?

How many people have backed out?

I have an order in  in transit now  for 122 units but it's coming slow boat from China, I was thinking about doing a pre-order thing but this is exactly what I didn't want to deal with so I just ordered a slew of the remotes upfront slight_smile:

if i just closed in out in 3 days when I hit 10 remotes that would have been so much easier... :joy:


@mwkeefer i'm not dealing with the extras yet. i might have a couple i'll let you know.

Saul,

Thanks for the rec.  I ran a high volume, short turn electronics web business for many years and  i'm very familiar with the byproducts of success and failure with eCommerce... I have shopping carts that I actually coded so no problem there and I am planning on opening up a virtual sk8 shop up specifically dealing in parts and products for DIY eSk8  but that's down the road a short while (sept.-dec).

Let me know on the extras or canceled orders, I'll be interested in them until my order arrives but for personal builds and prototypes :slight_smile:

@saul I could really use this. I can't do anything else without it. I'm not trying to bust your balls here. It's just not cool that it's taking 3+ weeks for them to get in the mail. I get that you've got a life and aren't making a bunch of money or even any but I paid and met my end of the deal so I'd like to get my remote. Someone had offered to help get them shipped out if I remember correctly. Have you reached out to them?

I've been part of many group buys on other forums, by far this is the worst experience I've dealt with online.

Saul, was great in communicating when it came providing his PayPal information and replied within that same day.  Now that the funds are in his hand, I can't even get a reply from him. 

Saul, I wish to go forward with a refund, yes I take the hit and eat the PayPal fees.

Regards

ok so 27 days since he said he had them and has not been on board since July 18th (at least logged in)....

I am guessing we are all screwed out of our $$

I think that we need a Blacklist for members that screw people on GBs...

A little too common on the forum this past couple of months...

Maybe a blacklist does need to be made and pinned to the top of this forum.

Sounds like you guys were all around the 25-30  remote amount.  Sounded like @saul ordered a few extras so to get to the 30 remote count for discount but assume only 25ish people signed up for it. 

Also doesn't account for shipping, but I'd say @saul has ~$700-1000 from everyone.

I would guess at least 30 as that was the goal...but there was talk of reaching 50...if you look at his post from 27 days ago he posted a pic of what he said were remotes in hand...and there look to be a bunch....

He did say he ordered a few extra to get to 30 that he planned to sell at like $40 to make a few bucks from this whole thing.  Right around May 25th.

@heliboy04 is local & also offered to help, probably hot and the post office is closed, personally I would just take a day off and sort this mess out. Even more so if I had an esk8 business and cared about my rep.

Hey wouldn't it be cool if these became collectors items before we got em'!

Peace

I wasn't sure I should say anything, since I don't know what your PM's with saul have been like. After I escalated my Paypal claim against him I got one PM from him about two weeks ago saying he couldn't deal with both the orders and the claims and did I want the remote or a refund; I asked for the refund.
I got said refund through paypal four days ago, and that would appear to be that.
So that's my personal experience, I hope everyone else gets a resolution to their liking, be it a remote, refund or whatever.
Sadly, I think it's going to be a while before I try another group-buy.

Thanks for alerting me @Crushkrew. I'll contact @saul 

These group buys are breaking my heart.

We (the mods) are now actively monitoring GBs and only allowing level 3 members to start them.  That's always been the rule but it wasn't enforced early on.

 I'm not happy to discourage enthusiastic folks that want to organize GBs, but we need more accountability.

I know, sad :( 
I would add more strict condition:

Allow group buys of all level 3 members but first 3 group buys cannot be "payment in advance" type. Organizer should collect the list of those interested, pay the full price and only after receiving the goods, collect the money for items and forwarding. After 3 successful group buys, lift the restriction for the organizer.

Also received mine today @treenutter @psychotiller @saul 

@saul I apologise I came across as heavy-handed and hope you understand why now.

All in all I think the mods have the right approach going forward as the esk8 revolution burgeons, inevitably there will be some creep in of scamsters into the forum, granted saul is not one of those.
