I have had these laying around for months, Im just not going to get around to using them.  I have too many other builds going on to even consider what I would do with these.  Everything is brand new, never even mounted. 
 Maybe someone out there on the interwebs can make better use of them.  

**x2 12008 - MBS ATS Truck (1)  >  Cost:  29.95 each**
**x4 13018 - Complete 7" Knobby Wheel (1)  >  Cost:  19.95 each**
**MBS ATS 12 motor clamps (by @marcmt88)  >  Cost:  $77.00**
**x2 motor plates arms to fit 150/200mm wheels (by @marcmt88)  >  Cost:  $64.80**
**Total Cost:  $281.50**

I'm asking $250 shipped anywhere in the US.  International shipping will be at cost.  I would trade for Surf Rodz TKP's, new 30q pack, maybe some other stuff just hit me up.  PM with questions please.
