I would consider lowering the prices because the pads and superlight are more than you paid in the GB

115 shipped for those focboxes? Don't really need one myself right now, but if so, that would be pretty tempting.

@braeden.dilger1 and @MannyM0E 2x focbox's are sold and paid for and the other two are currently on hold for someone. I'm going at it by chronological order so no hard feelings. I'll let you guys know if the sale goes or not.
