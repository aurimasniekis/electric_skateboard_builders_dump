Dude holy crap please slow down on the advertising. It's like you're using this forum as your personal spam. If you're going to advertise a product, it better be something we haven't seen before.

Its probably made for a specific belt length.  Lots of mass market mounts and pulleys are like that.  Its a deal killer for me, I have to be able to alter the motor mount up/down position and belt length or I wont use it.

## \#13 Posted by: pennyboard Posted at: 2017-09-14T20:48:34.311Z Reads: 404

```
Not only that, but a huge benefit of belt drives is swapping out to different wheels and gearing when it suits you. This design doesn't allow you to do that. 

Although I will say $200 for motors and mounts and wheels is a decently good price, if they are good quality. The problem is that the savings is negated by having to buy a second a vesc. 

Perhaps if you sent units to one or two members of the forum so they could test it and say whether or not it's good quality, people would be more inclined to buy it

it is our retailor's hop, they only sell no waranty and aftersell support.
if warranty and support you don't care, then give it a shot.
still to inform here, apperance same looking doesn't prove same items in specs, you know the power comes out from inside copper wires and magnets.
we always keep the best of best updated version here selling abroad, and give cut version or lower power version to China distributors and retailors. as I said, almost we supply to many factories the key parts here in China in the electric skateboard industry, since we are the best and starting the earliest. 
time will prove my saying. to do is to believe.

different copper wires regarding thickness and magnet origin, high quality or low quality, it will affect much of motor power and performances.
we are not fooling, China supply chain alwys like this, people don't want high quality but regular types, so we use china made materials of copper wires and magnets.
and the prices are much different.
if you want the cheap, it won't last long and lower performances.
you should knowing all this.
be nice be supportive

I'm interested in some of your product but it is a bit in the face, the right way to do it would be to make your own thread and stick on that, add parts to your thread instead of creating a thread for each product. If someone asks to buy something, don't spam the thread with links to your products, pm them or just say you have some. Look at what other sellers to here with subtlety & a little class.

At the moment it's kind of taking over the parts forum that is probably not gonig to win you friends.

I may want those UT wheels and hubs but waiting for the good @mmaner to come back with his review.

Sometimes you just gotta ignore the haters keep doing what your doing.  Ill post my honest opinions when I get the wheels and have them mounted.

Regarding the hubs, the reason most people are ordering the wheels without hubs is because they are not very attractive and they are not offset.  If you could create a spoke pattern in the hub, that would go a long way towards making them look better.  If you can make the hb so the point of contact is at the inside instead of the middle that would make them sit wider and more usable on standard trucks.

Just my advice...

I mean I would consider this KIt, for science or a beginner friend who would want to start somwhere. The thing is, that it is an inferior product as to what we would use components wise:

1.) mounts, no idler pulley and no way of adjusting belt tension
2.) 270 kv is very high, 
3.) very rarely poeple use esc, mayby for a backup board or for fun, but 99% use vesc's/focboxes
4.)Battery cells as well.

If it would turn out it would survive some more serious group rides, with a decent review poeple may be inclined to go for it for a backup board or for fun like I said. If you want to convince poeple that this is a solid entry level solution you could mayby do that If 1-2 kits were reviewd and brought to their limits. But I don't think poeple would pull the triger blindly here, since most of us learned that buying cheap to upgrade later is not worth it.

Edit:Let me see if anyone here from our group (25 people) would be intrested in testing one. Though 500$ is alot for "science and fun".

thank you for the comment, but truth is we everyday got many orders for the kits, people like it not for price reason also the  performance. it is absolutely not a entry level like acton, it is a pro level of boosted. we just lower the price to make more people enjoy this skating fun with eboard, let more people join in and we save the world by reducing the co2 emmission.

```
I bought the kit and I'm using it now. However, the belt tension is way off, its incredibly tight and definitely putting unneeded stress on the bearings. Also, while 270kV is perfect for 6S it's way off for 10S and I'm losing potential power by using it with a VESC. If you made the mounting holes for the motor longer so you could adjust tension and reduced the kV these things would be perfect for most DIY builders.

As it stands their suitable for low power 6S boards but far off the mark for "pro level of boosted" type boards.

And to be fair, eboards are pedal bike alternatives not car alternatives. I wouldn't say you're reducing co2 emissions.

Have 12mm trucks and they start to bent .so  what l mean you need a minimum of 12mm size to be reliable . otherwise people like me who already buy trampa mbs want a minimum  quality. But     if you can sell diy parts for trampa. Mbs like motor mount . pulleys. Etc this will make grow your business very fast !! Have a nice day

sorry to bother you guys with this old topic, but i saw this while i was looking the same 10s5p kit from them, and saw that a lot of you complain about the 500 price.
Im here in mexico and i want to build my first one, not for a day to day use but more like for commute and fun, but i think i would upgrade the motor mounts; or what page would you recommend to build.

Because i know that cheap sometimes cost more, and lets be honest i dont want to buy cheap and to spend another 500 on new arts because the ones on the kit are in the trashcan.


sorry to ask on an old post.

Steer well away from this crappy set up.  Trust me.  Read this and make up your own mind.

bro, i owe you a huge one, you save me, but now comes the problem that i dont have more than 500 to buy one, and looking on the options, they are not that good, what site do you recommendo to buy the parts (that way i think i can do 2 orders and increase the amount of money) that have international shipping?

Personally speaking I would go to @torqueboards, bit more dollars but you get a kit that works perfectly out of the box and is high quality.
 

Have a look round and enjoy

at the moment 83, but normally between 79 and 84 kilos
max speed 25 miles would be awesome, can be less
between 12-18 miles 
budget, right now i have 500usd, more to come in feb, so i can buy some parts right now and another later, or a full kit in feb.

How are the roads there. If roads are rough then 107 or pneumatics is what you need?

I had 83mm wheels previously and my feet would become numb because of rough roads.

I have a meepo and its not bad tbh.  It works and it will get you from a to b.  I'd say most esk8 builders have at least one prebuilt in their quiver.  Its a good way to dip a toe in to see if you like it.  But and its a big but you will be building something or upgrading it before too long.  The company behind the meepo are very reputable though so if you do have an issue they will sort it for you.
One of my meepos now runs 2 focboxes and a bigger battery and I use it daily.  The other one is for the kids and for new esk8rs that want to try.
Nothing wrong with buying a cheap pre-built to get you started and as I said the meepo is cheap and good back up.  You will be buying and building again though but you can never have too many boards and this way you can see what you want to change and build something that fits you.  Food for thought.  Good luck my friend and welcome to the club

thanks, now im more calm, and just one more question, if i buy a meepo, could i buy and swap the sanyo batt later? or does this avoid warranty?

Nope they will sell the battery upgrade to you.  The cheaper battery is a bit too small though so you would be better off trying to get the sanyo straight away.  I did hear a rumour they were going to using samsung 30q's soon so do some checking.

Its the absolute best way to get involved.  For context,  I had 3 different pre-built boards before I ventured into building.  It gives perspective on exactly what you feel needed improvement.  Hang out here and use the time with the meepo as a learning curve.  Do some saving and reading and then build what you want, exactly the way you want and we'll see your creation in next years best build awards!

I have a meepo v2p 90mm edition. It’s given me 0 problems and really has unlocked a new hobby and really fun recreational activity. People do end up spending a lot on these things although still a lot less than car enthusiasts do on their cars. 

If you do end up getting a pre built I highly recommend getting the Sanyo. The last thing you want to worry about while you’re out having fun is having to cut your ride short to go back and charge up.

Yeah, every body its telling me the same, i really dont mind havind to charge it, but i know that the day i have it according to my luck, ill need to go to a more than 50% of the batt distance and wont be able to return with the same charge, so ill go with the sango and buy an extra later
