Hey Guys,

 I have been searching the world over for a charger that will fit our battery needs. All the cheap chargers are just that CHEAP crap and fail or overcharge, undercharge the packs. I have always felt that a better charger could be found that wouldn't break the bank. A charger that charged in a decent amount of time 5 amp and reached full charge. 

Here is what I found and will have these chargers available soon on the website:

we have tested this charger with all the bms units we use, the D140, D127 and D124 among a few others without fail.
full aluminum case and heavy gauge wire, fuse for power in and a fuse for power out. 
the internals look great, no low-grade components

![20190425_124210|375x500](upload://fOEeuXN7okBvc6lWYVZBrcgmuzM.jpeg) 

 we have 2 choices in amps the highest being 5a and 8a anything over that will need a different connector.


prices are simple 

10s and 12s chargers in 5 amp are $80 plus shipping 

10s and 12s chargers in 8 amp are $110 plus shipping

the obvious choice is the 5 amp charger, but some want more so there is the option of the 8 amp.  

What are your thoughts?

I have been waiting on these chargers for a few months now, they are OEM (from a different industry) but I have talked them into slight modifications for our use. 

As the size and power of the battery packs grow (and they are growing)  a better charger is necessary to charge them. Some of the high capacity cells take twice as long to charge. 

5 amp and 8 amp are not the limit. a different connector will be needed in 10 amp and higher chargers.

I got a Luna advances charger they make them for 10s they are like $99 but they have the ability to adjust the amps it delivers from 1-5 amps. May be an option for way. I’m not sure if they do a bulk discount but worth a shot for a nice charger.

alot of companies use very slightly different formats, but the general rule is as stated above as far as i can tell. for a chinese cheap connector, i would go by that. if it comes from a site like mouser that rates it higher, i would trust it

you need to buy a minimum amount for them to accept your order. it would be easier just to make a deans plug or xt30 connector for charging.

Yes, at low numbers the price is high. shipping (that doesn't take 25 days) and then reshipping/handling. You get what you pay for in this case, I can have them customize on lower order numbers, most won't do that.

I think the quality makes up for it. As we buy more the price will go down and we can customize the connectors in house if needed. 
We intend to use them in our kits and prebuilds once we are rolling.
8 amp is the highest I would go on any setup.  5 amp is a cost/time effective option. The 8 amp chargers are just higher in price, but faster.

XLR is really nice if your enclosure has room.

@hyperIon1 if you can get these done you're a boss. Well, you're a boss either way actually....

- bring voltage adjustment trim pot to outside
- upgrade the fan. I have a similar charger and the fan sounds like a dying cat
- voltmeter
- bonus for ammeter 

Hm these chargers do not do termination? Good for balancing with BMS but not good for longevity of the cells or for safety?

Regarding aliexpress chargers, I wouldn't consider any that don't proudly show gutshots.

[/quote]

I just geeked out on these. Switchcraft is a good mfg. But I think their high amp jacks are weird size (2.0mm x 5.5mm) and 24v rated. The size is not that important, as you should be using matching male+female. Almost, but not quite right.

I agree with the need for external trim knobs for volt and amps and a led screen. It's a builders dream charger, I want an all in one that will charge from 9s to 15s packs.

I agree with this but with reason: low-grade cells and prismatic packs. The longevity of the pack depends on the quality of the cell, type, and size.  Safety: the cell its self is safe, how you use it will make it unsafe. How the pack is built also plays a big part. What to consider: Heat, heat is the enemy both in charge and discharge, it speeds up the decay of the cell. 

The heat from the pack or even the components in the enclosure can be minimal while external heat (road heat) can do more damage. Everyone wants a sealed enclosure, but it just doesn't work with high current packs. It needs air flow and we are addressing this as well with how the pack is built (for air flow) and the addition of vent slits and a 12v fan. 

Your enclosure material will make a difference as well

I use that charger. But it is not 8A but it deliver 9,7A. 

 

I was thinking of buying [this](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/OAvQHP6) (€191) charger. Adjustable voltage and current. 

So I can change my 12s7p on rides with 28A.

@deucesdown maybe groupbuy?

Wow that's awesome. Crazy looking thing with that pcb contact board sticking out. Looks like nice high end switching server PSU for the bones. Price looks reasonable for the power.

Unfortunately 220v is hard to use in the US and A. We're limited to about 1500w from our wall sockets.

This thing I think might be okay but I'm concerned about overall quality. I'd like a bit more quality or a bit lower price. Comes in 110v or 220v.

Theres a CPS-6017 but it's 220v.

EDIT hm there's a 110v version, but $200.

Oh boy @pjotr47 you got me going again lol.

oldskool 0-60v/0-50a 1000w with analog meters. Sure to be skookum. Might need electrolytic caps replaced if they're old enough to have dried out. This ancient stuff is somewhat repairable I think.

EDIT 1000w/60v=16.67a, so these are nice but not 50a nice, derp.

The problem with these chargers are the sheer amount of noise that the cheap server grade fans they put in them make. I think the factory just tunes them to whatever you like and then sends them out. Battery supports does the same model in silver for whatever price plus shipping. 

http://www.batterysupports.com/432v-44v-504v-4a-lithium-ion-lipo-battery-charger-12s-12x-36v-p-167.html

To be honest though for the price you are asking lost would probably ly just be better off going for a meanwell LED power supply which will do exactly what all the cc cv chargers, doesn't require active cooling and is much higher quality...

I think there are a lot of different chargers using the same enclosure. Guts can vary greatly.

Technically "chargers" should have termination, but the OP's chargers do not have termination, so yeah basically CC/CV power supplies. EDIT chargers have the LED indicators, PSUs do not.

I guess they dont want someone to under cut them on the price it just stinks because they are really nice charges with a volt display a selection knob of 80-100% charge and a knob to  select what ampage to charge at.

Then you must have the 10a version. They sell several version all using the same  metal housing.

if the charger you linked can actually put out 30a that would be amazing

i have yet to find a 13s charger that can go above 15a

yet my 13s10 can charge at 30a, i cant imagine charging a 13s10p in a hour and riding for 3 or so hours...

i just realized its 220v only basically

I’ve been rocking this charger since I saw the voltage vary like crazy on the cheap charger I bough on eBay. I have a 6A version and its awesome. Basically I charge at a rate of 10-12 miles of range an hour. It’s so fast I carry it with me on long rides. I’d rather carry a fast charger in a backpack than add another 1-2 parallel cells and making my board heavier.

Also, 8A or bust. Better to have a faster charger and a 12s4p or 5p battery than 6p it even 8p.
