I originally ordered this unity months ago for a build, but it took too long and my shipping date kept getting delayed, so I bought a different esc.

The tracking number says it'll arrive on Tuesday the 23rd, so I'll ship it out by the 24th at the latest.

Florida, I didn't buy the extra warranty. Hoping to get $300 (Enertion's price), but I have a few people in line.
