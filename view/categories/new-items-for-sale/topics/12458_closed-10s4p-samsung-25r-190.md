```

Today I have got a deal with a chinese company that assembles battery packs: they will assembly and ship to my house (customs included) 10s4p battery packs for 190€ each (if i buy 10 of them).

WHAT'S INCLUDED?
40 authentic (see FAQs below for more info) SAMSUNG 25R  **already spot welded together** according to this scheme: 10s4p. More precisely the pack will output 36v 10amp/h. Cells are assembled with spacers to prevent heating and to give a structure.

WHAT KIND OF SPOT WELDING?
I picked the most expensive and tricky material for our packs: copper. It is technically impossible to achieve a spot weld with copper at home because it is the same material of welding electrodes (which will melt along with the strip). Copper compared to nichel/aluminum/zinc has the less resistance so it drains current with less heat produced. Each cell will be spot welded in 4 points each side.

POSSIBLE ADD-ONS
1)BMS  :23eur
2)ON-OFF switch (already tested; will be soldered by me on the BMS)= 2€
3)LCD with battery percentage= 5€
4)Heat shrink and awg8 cables: free if you add the BMS
5)(only italian buyers): pay in cash to the mailman: 3€
6)paypal fee (see FAQs)

SHIPPING TO EUROPE:
Only choice: UPS= 15€ to europe (25€ to some countries: Czech republic, Greece, Poland, Slovak Republic, Hungary,  Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania)

Probable FAQs
How do you know we are buying original cells? 1)I ordered from this company 30 cells to test out and they fullfil samsung original specs (dimensions, weight, discharge rate, peculiar manufacturing details)--2)in the deal with the company there is the fact that if I find out 1 cell is counterfait the whole order will be refunded and I keep the goods.

Why don't you order the final product including cables and BMS already soldered, wouldn't it be cheaper? Yes it would be cheaper. But this way (with the naked product)I can check the quality of each weld, and each BMS.

Why don't you just offer the whole pack without stupid add-ons? I don't want people to pay for something they don't want/need.

What if I don't want to give paypal the fee? 1) You pay in friend mode 2)you send me a bank transfer

THIS FIRST BATCH WILL ONLY BE MADE OF 10 PACKS. Priority is given to people who reserve their pack here on the thread.

The pack will not look like this (I did soldering on this, and it is custom made to fit on my deck) but it is made with cells and bms from the same factory.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/8/58405af551a28c71552a566ff7bbf61b01b9441f.jpg" width="690" height="388">

The pack without the BMS will have these dimensions : 39.8x13.5 cm (dimensions of a single cell :18.3x64.8mm plus spacers)

This is how it will look like after professional spot welding (picture from enertion. They used nichel connections instead of copper, but structure is the same) <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/a/da0432908610fa0000138f722fe82451958b2496.png" width="662" height="499">
Cool thing about this BMS is that cell balance situation is shown by leds <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/8/c8c66e2cb3b74e7aa1d3b88d3a7fcf6a3a7e924a.PNG" width="425" height="311">

I dont know how many amps space cell'BMS can drain. I know for sure that the cells and the scheme are identical (10s4p samsung 25r). The connections on my pack (in the case they use nichel) are slightly more expensive (few cents). Lcd does the same function. I will use awg 8 silicon cables (dont know about space cell).

I'm assuming there will be balance connectors installed, so you would need a 10s balance charger, or if you get the BMS installed, just a simple power brick that should come with the BMS.

BMS come with these main functions: short protection, low and high voltage protection, balance function with LEDs showing unbalanced cells,  temperature pretection etc...

Continuous charge current: 5A
Continuous discharge: 49A

We are getting these BMSs at a very low price therefore no charger is included. The voltage needed for charging will be 42v (36v chargers will not charge the battery). The amp can be between 2 and 5.

New plans for wires and connectors: now if you select the BMS option XT90 connector is included. The wires for the battery will be 10AWG since this thickness can theorically drain 140A, which is enough.

Hi guys, since some of you believe 49amp continuous wont be enough for their board (although is much more than most battery packs on the market) I contacted the bms seller to receive a quote for a **77amp continuous BMS**
Please vote the most suitable option for your projects.

* Upgrade to 77amp continuous (+6eur)

Even if it is bypassed, everything is limited by a 40 amp fuse. The possibility of having the limitation on the bms allows us to have few seconds peak at almost twice the continuous amp rate.

Furthermore there are other benefits like low and high voltage protection, temperature protection, balanced discharge....(enertion maybe decided to bypass bms because they can relate on vesc settings to protect their packs, but not everyone has a vesc)

Yes you can go even lower with chinese sellers, but the point here is that you get it ready to go as you would with any eboard seller on the web, but you do it for half the price and probably with much higher rated parts (remember 77amp bms for about 30 euro, remember copper welds).
However I am the first to trigger people to go diy, to make mistakes and learn in a expensive way as I did tons of times.

PARTS UPDATE:
I have got for the same price a deal on a cooler LCD: now it has a **low voltage alarm (it beeps I guess)**
These are the chargers that come with a european plug, only problem is that there are just 9 in stock (lets hope not everybody want it):

Hello,

Can you post the model of the BMS + Display that you used for this pack.

I have custom built a 10s2p pack and would like to get a better BMS for it with readout.

Also, who is manufacturing these packs for you? (I am on a school electric car racing team and we are looking for a battery manufacturer)

Thanks!!!

EDIT: If you are selling the BMSs seperately I would also be interested in buying one from you.

Prototype pack has been manufactured. They noticed that in the welding process with copper battery started overheating so I asked them to go back to nickel strips.
They offered me a discount for using nickel instead of copper (about 60cents/pack), thus I will send these 60c back to you if you want.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/e/aeb48c911a8ab984e37ffcd6bee77f6638612d31.png" width="301" height="500">

they could have also just done a longer pause in between welds. For example they could have used like 3 batteries simultaneously and alternate between them spot after spot. That should have been enough time for the batteries to cool down again (or not heat up in the first place). Also I doubt that spot welding can actually increase the temperature that much - in the end that is the whole point of using a spot welder: pulses are super short and only apply heat to very small areas.
To me it feels like they tried to lure you in by telling you they can do it and now had to switch to nickel because they actually could not.
Maybe someone who already spot welded copper can share his experience?

I asked them to test the nickel strip with 40 amps. It reached 44 degrees Celsius. This temperature is totally fine for the cells. Anyways I am insisting to get a second strip on the top so that the packs will be safe and sound even with a crazy current drain.

Please notice that other battery pack producers are using just 1 nickel strip. Doubling it will have less resistance than the copper connection I planned at the beginning.

Edit: the seller accepted welding a second nickel strip on top.

Hi, saw this late, I was wondering if you still had packs left at this point or if you were all accounted for. (I'm in the US)?  I'm looking for full 10s4p, larger bms, switch and indicator (basically everything).  Also if available, before I commit (I see so many went back and forth and don't want to do that) do you know when they would be to you and when you would re-ship?

Cheers

Just received the packages. Its a bit late to assemble 10 packs, probably half of the shippings will be delayed by one day. I found a way to decrease the overall size of the battery pack (see picture).

Please tell me in chat if you like this configuration or if you want me to move the parts in a different configuration (pm me a drawing).

Obviously I will had heat shrink, heat sink and shock absorbing material, .......

I excuse in advance for the delay. This was due to the examination of all the parts that came from china.

In the final design you will have :external heat sink, balance LEDs, fake carbon fiber wrap.

Probably this will take me the whole weekend. To excuse for the delay I will include a free aluminum clamp to the package.

It's supposed the be mounted on the PCB.

Imagine multiple components mounted like this, it would be a mess and something would definitely go wrong! Also, the solder that is holding it in place is under strain, similar to leverage force and may eventually break under vibrations / impact. All of that may result into broken / bent leads that can touch other stuff and short something out ( or just stop working ). If it's sitting in your house, it probably won't ever happen, but this is just not the way components are supposed to be mounted. And after all, it's much easier to solder it the "correct" way, I don't really understand why they did it this way. Maybe they used shitty diode that produces lot of heat and needs to be in the main airflow path? I don't know.

Yep, I think everyone should share knowledge wherever possible.
And if you don't know something, just ask!

I've learned everything I know somewhere on the web, you just need to know what to search for and have enough motivation. This way, I learned how to code in many languages, advanced electrical engineering and other cool things. I don't have a formal knowledge, I know I can learn things myself better than the middle or high school can ever teach me ( schools really do suck in my country ). Now, I'm 17, I'm working as a programmer, making lots of electronics crap and trying to share my knowledge so other people can learn the way I learned.

@IDVert3X Dang, I feel so old. When I was your age, the internet was still in diapers. Lol. Great job teaching yourself those important skills though. This really is the most amazing time in history for accessing and sharing info and knowledge.

Thanks for the detailed answer! I believe there was a good reason to leave it lifted by a centimeter. Only few tests will tell if this is an actual disadvantage. Please give me few days to open one up and stress this component.

Nope. I guess you can change the voltage just by changing the coil (the thing with 42v label on it). Maybe if we reach a decent number of orders, the company will be happy to make a custom modification to the charger.

I would like to receive some reviews on the previous batch, maybe to improve some details.

I could make a small batch (3/4 units) ready to be shipped in 3 weeks from the payment. Pm me if you are interested.

I am involved in the neverending GB that is happening on this forum and I received  the majority of the components like a week ago. I'll start to build maybe in two weeks from now, so I had no way to test the battery. I just tried to charge it, and it works ahahaha I'll keep you guys posted!

Spring is coming..... it's time I was finishing my build, Battery is just about last component and uk availability/price isn't good so I'm hoping this GB goes again and a few of the last lot of buyers manage some testing/reviews.

I will be gettin one in 2-3 weeks, will give you a detailed review afterwards. I can only tell you that much as of now, that @fedestanco was extremely helpfull in answering question (and I had plenty) and is very quick to answer and flexibel on the rest. So far amazing really.

Hi ken. I am sorry to tell you this, but I have to limit the GB to europe+uk this time because UPS did a mess with extra-eu shippings and I had to refund one battery. 
If I ll find cheap and reliable way of shipping batteries worldwide, I ll let you know.

There are quite a few of us interested........ most of the guys in the last GB are likely to be finishing off builds etc and you can't just charge a lipo pack and not use it, so I get why no one is reviewing yet.
That said I would be willing to go for it with the information we have here  in the thread already (I have that must finish itch) so when @fedestanco calls it I'm ready.

Watch this. Good source for inspiration.

Vacuum formed abs enclosure is popular. Me myself recommend carbon/glass fiber enclosure.

This is my enclosure with fedestanco battery inside. It has been designed and printed by a friend of mine! I'll paint it black, to make it stealthier :D To make easier assembly/disassembly the whole, I'll do some sort of joints(like the ones for the bridges) using mastic, that is strong and but elastic.
