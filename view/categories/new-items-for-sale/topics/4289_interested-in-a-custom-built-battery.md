So I'm starting to build and sell batteries. I have a lot of experience in battery building and soldering as well as spot welding. Basically I can build any packs you guys would need whether it be lipo or lion. They'll be quality cells like Samsung or Sony for example and will have a warranty included in price.  

I can build them without BMS which would bring the cost down significantly. 

Basically I would charge cost of material plus 20 percent labor so I am completely transparent.  

Just checking to see if this would interest anyone I'm not really looking to make money from this mostly it's because it gives me a viable excuse to sit in my workshop more often :) 

I can do lipo ultra flat packs like you've seen in my thread of how to make lipo packs thinner. Thanks to @lowGuido for extending the idea of ultra thin lipo packs.  There would only be about a one week lead time before shipping. I can ship anywhere UPS lets me ship batteries to. 
Don't quote me on this exact number but I can do a 10s4p pack with Samsung 25R cells for 270 bucks without a bms. 
Adding a bms adds about one hundred dollars to the pack.

I'm not entirely confident with pricing yet as I don't know what will be a comfortable affordable price you guys are willing to pay.   I'm just trying to make LIon for affordable for everyone. I can make two separate 5s or 6s packs you can charge and charge separate to run in series if you don't have a 10 or 12s charger

IIIIIIII
IIIIIIII
IIIIIIII

8 wide would be 144mm right?

I need a pack that is  144mm x 350mm  or 290mm long if the last row could be stacked 2 high.

Okay yes I can do a 144mm by 325mm pack. If you want to stack the past row I can get it to 144mmx 260mm

Since its 5 rows of 8 it's a bit tricky to spot weld because the parralell packs aren't all together but definitely possible

For some reason i can buy a 6s 10000mah 10C 

for 45 euro's ... That's almost as much as the 6s 5000mah 25C i have now. 

Do the negative points way up to cheap price ? :p 
Because i have single drive with 9mm belt . so won't be doing hard accelarations anyhow

Another thing I can do for you all which is what I am doing for @psychotiller which is to spot weld the entire pack together and run all of the balance terminals and main lead terminals and heat shrink it up and ship it out. This way they are much cheaper and you can choose if you want to ad a bms or voltage meter. 

A battery pack using 40 Samsung cells is priced at 250 bucks plus shipping for just this method of production.  You can change it using a lipo charger

Definetly not fast...

I think for the european market you should look for someone else.
Maybe @elkick (esk8.de)?
He is from Germany and as they make batteries i am sure they will do something custom if you ask nicely.

It would cost the price of your cells + spot welder price + nickel strip + wire.
If your cells are 200 USD (estimate) it is about $150 for a spot welder and 50 for nickel strip and wire. Around 400 but then the next build you make will cost $250 USD or less because you already have the spot welder.

so how much are we talking about here if we can provide our own cells to the custom battery builders? I just don't think I'll have the time to figure it all out on my own. Best to leave it to you pros! I think we can get cells for about $130-150 (30cells), additional hardware and labor? I'm in California.

PS is that a Losi 1/18/1/16 mini?

Well I got the cells cheaper than you would since I bought them in bulk. I only charge About 20 percent of all material cost. 

BUT

If you want to spend the money to send me the cells I can put it all together for the same deal 20 percent of all would be costs.

And hell yea I love my mini t. 40 mph. I can prove it lol

Tuning an RC nitro engine's carb settings is much more complicated than any e-board's components! Not to mention all the other suspension tweeking, tire compound, etc for racing around at 70mph on the track. I'm lucky I have my R/C background before getting into this! I did solder my own 6-Cell Ni-CAD pack though :laughing:

The 740 is way too big for a longboard. I have it on my trampa. And it's not a flat pack.

I'd stick with a 10s5p at most for a board which gives you 462 watt hour.

So I'm going to have he batteries alone in one box because that is all that fits. Then I will have another box with the esc's,the bms, bec, receiver and charge port

It depends on which cell you choose and if you want a BMS or not, plus of course his fee. You can go to nkon.nl and check which cells you want, be sure to pick a high discharge one then you can make an estimate of the costs. There's a post that has a list of commonly used li-ion batteries if you're not sure. A bms used only for charging will cost less than a bms that you wire to do balanced discharging / protections.

Don't get into the 6s rut. Just do it right the first time. I think a standard 10s4p pack will cover all your bases. 

It's not too fast but it's gonna be fast enough for you for sure. You won't be pulling too many amps since it's higher voltage. And it's gonna get you a whole lot of a range. Depending on your setup and weight possibly 20 miles.

yes you are in good hands for advice and battery with @barajabali for sure.

for first build would start with the proven foundation unless someone argues you off for good reason (like your terrain, hills, weight, trip range, speed needs) lol:
-10s (12s not necessary, 6-8s fine but likely you either quit esk8 or migrate to higher voltage so proven 10s is good settle point)
-bms + switch + ez laptop syle charger for first build
-li-on though plenty of folks lipo so some options there, @barajabali can guide you throgh tradeoffs
-3 or 4p depending on range need and weight/space considerations, see @barajabali for tradeoffs
-enclosure @psychotiller 
-single drive, you can go dual later by just adding dup motor in dual or diagonal later on
-190kv great balance of torque and topspeed, depending on your situation and desires
-63 (diameter) 74 (length) motor size strong/long stator size for single motor setup, good options from Enertion, @JLabs, hobbyking, etc.)
-VESC or rc ESC is debatable, do some research as good thing to understand better regardless
-GT2B remote w/mod kit or 2.4ghz remote.  these have proven to be good connectivity, which is key consideration
-Abec 11 or clone 83mm-90mm-97mm personal choice
-Enertion truck mount or @psychotiller or @torqueboards 
-Enertion wheel pulley or 3d print @JuniorPotato93 or other 
-trucks caliber II 44 (little more stable in speed) or 50 (little more carvey) degree
-belts a@ vbelt or polybelt online once you get enerything else so can lock down length around 260m HTD5m 15m (better than 9m for you IMO).
-deck is personal choice really
-etc probably left something out lol

Well I would go with liion first off if you want thing to actually work every morning. Liion is much more reliable and works can pair really with with bms and charger. 

My batteries come ready to go with bms (for easy charging, 2A charger which will charge a 10s2p pack in about 2.5 hours. Percent display and on off switch)

I would reccomend you a 10s setup and since you only need 4.5 miles I would go with either 2p or 3p. 

I would avoid lipos we usually all make that mistake when we first start. Those batteries are made for toys not vehicles <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/f/6f993cab57d8490e36df7d014cddc73fa3836687.PNG" width="281" height="500">

REDUCED LEAD TIMES

Previously wait times would be about 2-3 +weeks depending on inventory. I have invested $3000+ to try to keep a rolling inventory. now when I get an order the only wait is for building which is usally done within 2 days and shipped to your house within a week of ordering.

In less than a week my inventory will arrive consisting of 750 cells and BMS and chargers of all configurations. 

Just to let you know... also I'll be selling cells for 4.25 a cell.

I have an old Evolve gen2 Carbon enclosed deck I am retrofitting and will need a battery. Just eyeballed it and super slim, tried one of the @oriol360 stealth 12s2p batteries to compare size and too thick. Will measure exact, unless someone has specs for this deck, but what is slimmest you have been doing without resorting to Lipo slim flat packs?

thanks man!  

without going with lipo packs, the slimmest i can do is about 19-20mm that is when i can lay the bms next to the pack instead of stacked on top :)

Excellent, let me take some more precise measurements. But yes, looks like plenty of horizontal space, vertical Joe so much lol!

hi barajabali

. i'm interested in a custom built battery. I plan on running carvon v2.5 single hub motor with vesc. may use my landyachtz 9two5 or just buy a new deck.

looking to get speed and range. don't really mind about size or weight as long as the batteries arn't getting in the way and I can lift it. 

I weigh 180. what do you recommend?

thanks!
```

hey man! welcome to the forum! 

So youre gonna need to decide on how fast you'd like to go? 
The standard pack i recommend for all people is a 10s4p.  That is the pack you use when youre not sure what you want.  It has a bit of everything :) 

10s is pretty fast depending on gearing and motor kv

it looks like people on the forums say they can get up to 30 mph with a single. I'm in for anywhere between 20-30 top cruising speed. I think 25 would be perfect.

Yea I would run a 6374 190kv at 10 or 12s. That'll give you a pretty high top speed

You need to run 12s with at least 40amp constant. 

How far do you want to go?

This looks great! so are you able to make a battery pack that can deliver 44.4volts(12s) at 80amps continuous with a big capacity? the motors I'm looking at say they can handle 200 amp, I just want to put 80 into them each.. I can design my board to fit the battery no worries

## \#183 Posted by: memesupreme Posted at: 2017-06-06T15:22:05.659Z Reads: 176

Lipos have a c rating, basically I'm looking at a c rating of 80, but on a 12sXp battery, X=the number of cells in parallel necessary to be able to safely discharge at 80 amps, so if 12s8p will deliver 80 amps continuous safely then yeah ill want that.
