Not sure what they cost new but whatever it is I would like close(ish) to that. I bought this new from a another forum member, need to dig out his username

Yes but if you're running vesc, it will control the cutoff. Yes li ion bms are set a little lower than lipos. But if you bypass discharge, your vesc can take control of cutoffs. 

Correct me if I'm wrong please. I definitely don't want a fire lol.

The way i view it is that the vesc is the bouncer... but the bartender(Bms) is still gonna ask for your card(voltage)

if its not in the bms range then i think BMS just turns everything off

That's just it though. Bms will allow full voltage charge of 42v. Both li ion and lipos are capable of that. Now, the bms is set on li ion cutoffs which are lower than lipos. So in theory, lipos should be with in that cutoff window for the vesc to take control. In theory.
