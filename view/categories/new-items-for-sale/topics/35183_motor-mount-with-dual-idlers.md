Hi, I have been working on a new improved motor mount that I previously design for Caliber II and TorqueBoards 218mm trucks(http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/custom-made-cnc-motor-mounts-available-for-sale/32342).  Below are some of the pics.  My mounts are designed and cnc'ed by me to fit 63xx and 50xx motors.  They can be used on flywheels up to 90mm.  They are available for $50;  set includes 1 clamp, 1 motor mount, 1 set of idler (2 bearings) and stainless steel hardware.  
Thanks!
:point_down:Fits wheel size from 83mm to 107mm... can be customized to fit larger wheel size.

You only need one idler; it depends on which side of the axle you want to install the motor mount.  If you plan to go reverse then installing both top and bottom idlers would not be a bad idea :slight_smile:

There is one tiny benefit besides number of teeth in mesh - a smaller gap means less rocks going in there on accident.  I had a rock go in mine recently

But two idlers are better than one, right? Plus the whole physics of the thing will give you more torque from the belt, no?

You wouldn't be able to get these mounts on that truck unless you lathed or filed some of the truck away as there's not enough axle/truck that is perfectly round....

That would depend on how deep the wheel pulley is going to sit on the axle.  I can oversize the opening a little and use shim if necessary to get a good fit.

I'm going for the same thing with my build but I'm using 177.8mm wheels. Currently using skate bearings as my idler pulleys and I'm debating on if I want to get ceramics to replace them. Has anyone here already done this? I thought if they were ceramic like the ones in my wheels I'd never need to replace them.

Does the idler really have to clear the wheel like that? If the idler stuck out the same length as the belt(or slightly shorter by a mm or so) It shouldn't matter what size the wheel is.

the problem is the bolt that holds it all together.  it sticks out a few mm from the bearings and hits the wheel if it is “inside”

On this particular mount the bolts are quite small. I'm sure there are fastners that would fit flush (almost)

That's great but i'm not having a pissing contest with you here. If you think it's impossible then idk what to say to you.

It's a 24mm gap, there's plenty of room. Plenty of people have idlers with pneumatics...

dude unless you want to throw on like 4 extra speed rings...  its not a viable solution for street wheels.  Even when using a countersunk shoulderbolt, you will still have about 1mm sticking out beyond the bearings.  The problem also comes when people want to run 15mm belts.  Then it is almost required that you use 2-3 bearings to cover the entire belt.  8*3= 24mm + the extra 1mm of the bolt will rub against the wheel.

#lets just agree to disagree
```

---
## \#52 Posted by: Fiori Posted at: 2017-10-14T15:13:37.967Z Reads: 402

It's not all about stacking washers and bearings man. Maybe a custom tube is needed to house the bearings like ollin uses.

It's definitely not a task for a space engineer here..... A custom tube the exact correct length with bearing seats and a counter sunk bolt mounting hole for the main bolt would easily fit. 

I can think of multiple ways right off the top of my head to make it fit.....I have measured and test fitted 3d parts and will have a working mount this week. 

Agree to disagree? If you have no useful input other than to just blindly say it won't work why even comment? "I can't figure it out so it must be impossible" .

If you plan on running a 7mm belt instead of 15mm then single bearing can be used.  Mount can be re-design to sit behind the wheel ending with shorter mount.

I guess I had an image in my head, my current mount with pulleys I used a shoulder bolt and a speed washer but I made it in a sense where it will tuck behind the wheels. I've always loved your design so was hoping a modification could be done to run duals and have a shorter mount .

Without extending the motor mount length 107mm wheel will interfere with bearing.

But if I'm running a 15mm gear with a 12mm belt couldnt I fit 10mm bearing with 1-2mm for screw and clearance left over?

Also could you add the profile of 36t and 40t wheel gear to see how that would be affected

Since I am using standard size skateboard bearings they are 7mm thick.  Not sure if they come in 10mm thick.

The evolve rear truck bracket hole pattern appears to be Imperial with centers at 19/16 inches per side (30.1625mm), in an equilateral triangle around the truck (3 bolt holes) and the bolts are the same as the truck bolts with locknuts

edit: to clarify, 30.1625mm from bolt center to bolt center, not to the truck

edit2: the equilateral triangle has one bolt on top and the [bottom two](https://imgur.com/gallery/aMyPi) parallel to the ground

edit3: the radius of the bolt hole pattern around the centroid of the truck is 17.414mm

14mm clearance, so yes you are OK with a 10mm bearing.  Idlers can be redesign to sit behind the wheel with single 10mm bearing.

@marcmt88 I'm interested too if you can get these mounts to fit the evolve rear trucks and fit dual 6374 with 107mm wheels and dual idlers.  I mean, that's like the dream setup, especially if the motors can fit under the deck instead of behind it.  Which makes me think too, it's be cool if the mount stuck out a little (5mm) more than the motor so if they were mounted out back, the mount is what the board would stand on and not the motor

[quote="KenTw, post:1, topic:18898"]
that second kingpin blocks me from making the motors facing inside it would be stuck in between the two motors, so if anyone want to try this setup, the two huge motors would have to be set in the back outwards
[/quote]
This may be an issue but I think if the mounts were further from the truck they could be under the deck.  Also since there are dual idlers, too much belt slack is a non-issue completely for longer belts :wink:

As is my motor mount stuck out more than the motor so when you pick the board up you are standing on the mount and not the motor.  Scroll up to see a picture of my dual motor setup.  @b264 also suggest I extend a little more than motor which can be easily done.  
I currently have a rear twin drive 6374 motor mounted on TB218mm.  Motors are installed on the kingpin side.  I am able to setup that way because I extended my mount to accommodate the kingpin interference.  As for evolve truck in theory keep extending the mount until you clear the kingpin stack.  I am more than happy to accommodate getting your dual 6374 motors on your evolve truck. 
 Let's try to figure this out together @ARetardedPillow, @b264 , @pixelsilva,...

A minimum requirement for mounting a dual 6374 motors is 172mm without the motor knocking each (taken from my setup using TB218mm)

Based on evolve measurement taken from @pixelsilva , width from plate to plate is 5 3/8" or 136.5mm  +  Plate thickness is 8mm.  136.5 + 8 + 8 = 152.5mm is not wide enough to accommodate dual 6374s.

Using my clamp which is 3/8" or 9.5mm as a "washer" gets you to 136.5 + 8 + 8 + 9.5 + 9.5 = 171.5mm.

Voila, Evolve truck has the potential of running a dual 6374s.

I'm using the standard 148.25mm length mount arm with 107mm 40T 15mm, just needed to change bearings to get belt coverage and clearance I wanted. Just make sure you have no wobble and everything is aligned, you'll be playing with 1-2mm clearances.

I was planning to only use them with 90mm wheels, I just didn't want to buy the mounts if the ones shown in the picture where the standard length. Too long for my taste. But since those are indeed the longer ones, it's between this mount and the one being sold by @Boardnamics. Both are similar mounts and similar price points. Any preferences?

Edit: @scepterr that clearance is pretty impressive, no room for error there

90mm wheel would be about the arm as 83mm.  I can make it even shorter if you want to tuck idlers behind the wheel.

In all reality, you should only need plus or minus one tooth worth of adjustment.  Otherwise you can just get a different belt length technically.  Any more than that is "want" and not "need"

Yeah, I'm not worried about idlers not providing enough adjustment once I get the right size belt. The thing I'm worried about is getting the right size belt to begin with. Guess I'd just to wait till I have the mount to measure the distance and then buy a belt based on the measurement.

Your truck, your way...customize your motor mount the way you want it.  
- Fit wheel size from 80 to 107mm
- Universal motor arm (50xx or 63xx)
- Dual idlers for belt tensioning and preventing tooth skipping
- Reversible (inside under deck or on the side of kingpin)
- Fits the following trucks:  Caliber II, TB 218mm, Paris, Bennett Vector, Surfrodz Indeesz Hex, and soon Ronin and Evolve.
- I can engineer a mount to fit your truck.

The mount should fit 50mm & 63mm Motors - so the "X" design.
Mount can be short, since 90mm wheels max!
I hope to fit my 285mm belt...

Dual 6355s side-by-side would required some creativities and modification.  With my current setup you have about 105mm between the 2 mounts, a minimum of 112mm (110mm for 2 motors and 2mm clearance between them) is required to run dual 6355s.  You could extend the wheels out for the difference by using additional speed washer between the hangar and the axle.  Another option is mounting the two diagonally on the same truck or 1 on front and 1 on back truck.

## \#265 Posted by: pixelsilva Posted at: 2018-01-06T21:37:28.320Z Reads: 258

In this case, generally they go on the wheel's inside where the axle joins the hanger, putting extra speed washers there forces the wheel to move to the outside (taking the wheel pulley with It) thus making more room to position the mount further out (along the hanger) and consecuently achieving more space between mounts to properly fit those 6355 motors on your truck mounts.

Not quite sure about the question, the benefit of idlers is preventing tooth skipping.  Both idlers and parallel slots serve as belt tensioning.  I suppose if you use the parallel slots arm without the idlers would give the system less drag as oppose to the xconf. arm with the idlers.

Just want to say huge thanks to @marcmt88 for some custom made motor mounts. I wanted a custom center to center distance that was shorter than what he made before. He said no problem.  

The quality is really nice, the vibration finish is a nice touch and the aluminum grade is quite hard! :metal:t3: Also international shipping only took 7 days to Hong Kong. :earth_asia: :airplane: :gift:

My setup is 97mm wheels, 39t / 20t pulleys, 300mmX15 belt, TB218 trucks with CTC of 72mm.  Some people say that this will not work with the idler pulley as head of the bolt will behind or touching the wheel. In my case it works as there is space between the belt and the wheel. 3D printed pulleys. And with TB218's you have a lot of room to play around. 

The only issue I had was with the belts I had on hand I could not get it to work with the idler. I had some smaller bearings #625. 16mm diameter. This allowed it to work with a 300mm belt.

My old motor mounts where hand made by me with a 3D printed clamp. They worked fine but the clamp would crack after some time and it was a huge pain to replace it.

If you run one motor in front and one in back of each truck, it should work on regular Caliber2 or TB218.  Though then the tail won't work well...

Going the way that @b264 suggested would be the best way to ensure they fit. Psychotiller has some 200mm trucks and torqueboards has 218mm trucks so you would have to measure out the motors to the width of the trucks and add like 1/2 inch for the mounts.

You would have to look at the motor size and the avaliable truck width the add in the motor mounts.  Marc will be able to tell you the width of the mounts.  I would also make sure the mounts will work with the APS.  If not I'm sure Marc would be able to accommodate you with the holes to mount the motors.

You should be good with the psychotiller RKP set with a 200 mm hanger. It comes with 90 mm axels, and you can use the entire hanger width for motors as the mounts attach to the end of the hanger they dont clamp "onto" the hanger like most traditional set ups.if they APS are ACTUALLY 84mm, no prob.

You are correct.  Running dual APS 6384 side-by-side is possible on TB 218mm, probably require using additional speed washers to push the wheel assembly outward to accommodate 15mm wide belts.

...another possibility, no yet explored (Brian... @b264 ....almost followed this path) is to get two (2) frontal Evolve Supercarve trucks! 

Those trucks are among the widest in the esk8 world, 306 mm total lenght (of which 32 mm correspond to  each axle).... that means there are 242 mm of bare truck left to acomodate (inside) the largest motors you may think off.

And those specific motor mounts will work with these trucks?  I really like these trucks so this would be ideal for a 4WD setup with 6384's.

Using the ESCape's, what kv would I want to go with considering 4WD 6384's? There's 130, 170, and 200kv I believe.

I could do a custom kv also..

@marcmt88 already proved that (2) two SK3 6374s motors will fit inside TB 218 mm trucks. Now, to fit larger APS 6382s will require wider trucks. Marc himself could help you out designing new custom mounts for such installation (Evolve front truck hanger). Is a matter of sitting and measuring the Evolve bare hanger and comparing how much space left you'll get by adding mount's thickness (2), clamps(2), motor lenght (2), wheel pulleys width (2), wheel's inside lip (2), etc.

With my current setup you have about 105mm between the 2 mounts, a minimum of 112mm (110mm for 2 motors and 2mm clearance between them) is required to run dual 6355s. You could extend the wheels out for the difference by using additional speed washer between the hangar and the axle. Another option is mounting the two diagonally on the same truck or 1 on front and 1 on back truck."

@marcmt88 that answer was to someone asking about 15mm belts, with 12mm belts does the problem go away?

Thank you. Ended up getting 2 of the caliber II mounts with 12mm belts. I was trying to get 15mm because I have another board with 12mm and it skips, that board doesn't have idlers on the mounts tho, so my hope is that the idlers will be enough!

You'll be surprised how idlers improve breaking and minimize tooth skipping.

Yes, how much for 2 shipped to Texas for a set of 200mm surfrods?

I'll be using 6380 motors from TB

Do you plan on it being a completely different Mount kind of like the Evolve trucks. Or just a new ring so people can use your current mounts.

hey marc i got your support already, I just would like to replace the bearings that came with it for this idlers........  this is a stock product for other machine?  Can I find it in a hardware store?  Or you made them?  if so I would get with you...

by the way ... are they better than the old two bearings?

Idler bearings are just standard skate bearings which are readily available online such as ebay or amazon.  I know ACE hardware carries them but are more expensive.  Any size bearing works as long the ID is 8mm.

As for the POM idlers, they are custom made by me.  They have single miniature bearing enclosed in POM housing.

So, I'm an idiot. I ordered these without wondering if they would work with the current size belts I have. What belt size would you recommend? I'm using a gear of 14:36 (motor:wheel).

310mm belts running 14/36t are the length.  If interested I have them for $10 each + $3 US shipping.  2 or more shipping is free.

Did you mean 320mm? Because that's the shortest size I can find on your site.

Sorry, my site is not updated.  I have them available, they are not shown on my site.  If you are interested on 310mm x 15mm belts, my PayPal is marcmt88@hotmail.com.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Unfortunately I only have 15mm wide.  I have 305mm in 12mm, it might work without the use of idlers.

Is 320mm still short enough to work with the idlers?

320mm is too long for 14/36t.  If you change your motor pulley to 16t, 320mm belt would work.  16/36t setup also gives you higher speed.  I have 16t motor pulley available.  They are $15 a piece.

So, obviously the cheapest option is just buying the 305 mm belts, but I'm worried that even with the idlers removed it'll be too tight. Can you confirm that they work?

Best if you confirm on your end.  Wrap a string around pulleys to measure.

4 months in on this kit (TB 218mm Dual Idler - Size L) and still running strong! Averaging about 5 miles a day since I don't get to ride every single day, I've easily put a few hundred miles on them so far. After I got the kinks out of the build I have only had to replace a few mount screws I stripped, then a couple inner tubes from his other kit (picked up some gnarly nails) 

Very happy with his products :D
