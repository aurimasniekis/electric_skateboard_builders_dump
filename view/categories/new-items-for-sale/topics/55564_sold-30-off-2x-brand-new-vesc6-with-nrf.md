Yes, but 400GBP is ~$540, so that's almost $100 more than an ESCape.

I've spent long enough sniffing out parts and sometimes you can miss a good deal thinking you can get things for a few pence cheaper.
These are the real deal and they exist (I think) so I can't see of a reason not to buy them if it's what you were looking for.
I have also spent a long time waiting for cheap parts to arrive....

Stuff existing makes it twice as good.  You can plan to use unobtainium all day long but it won't produce a functional esk8 made of matter, only an image of one in your head.

Thats not entirely true. 
Just you wait and see my octodrive unobtainium motor driven double quad vesc controlled board.

Lol, I just loved how with a budget the size of a small countries GDP, the most creative name they could come up with for some near priceless mineral was 'unobtainium'!  :laughing:
