Good afternoon everyone, 

I have 5 FOCBOX's which I'm willing to sell to someone in Europe. I'm in Switzerland, and will be sending those from here. They are €140 including shipping and PP fees. 

Let me know if you are interested)

It's €147 on their website plus tax, so no it's more expensive to get them from Enertion!

The 200 is in AUD, that equals 133.90 EUR on their site right now

Also if you are in EU and order from Enertion (AUS), DHL hits you with a massive fee (around 45€ in my case for one VESC). That's why my first order was my last order from them.
