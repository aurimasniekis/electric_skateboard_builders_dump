I picked up a kilo for my last build and some to spare for this n that... but way more than I need... I gave it my stringent salt-water-for-a-day-test and passed with flying colors =P I took a picture but deleted it by accident..

At any rate.. whats fair?? $1/ft?? 
You pay shipping and friends n family.

Shipped from US 06854 if you want to calculate... first class i assume is cheapest.. Local pickup available if youre in the NYC area..

Did you sand or grind this down and put it in salt water to test for pure nickel?
