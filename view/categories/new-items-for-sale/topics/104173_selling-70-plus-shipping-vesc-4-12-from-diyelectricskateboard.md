I bought a FOCBOX instead so dont need this anymore. I'll sell it for $70 plus shipping OBO. I haven't taken it out of the bag yet. That's how brand new it is.![IMG_5888|375x500](upload://A9LH68Xv5JhogMvw9Hm4tx7G8d8.jpeg) ![IMG_5889|375x500](upload://t2jvt6jMMAIC8brC9uwUdKQlVXf.jpeg)

you might have pretty tough luck selling it at 100% cost without a warranty...

Yeah I've had this for a while. I'll drop the price to $70 then. $15 less than original.
