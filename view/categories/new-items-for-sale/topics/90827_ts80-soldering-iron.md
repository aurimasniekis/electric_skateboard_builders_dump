Accidentally bought two of these bad boys the other day so instead of dealing with the hassle of returning one I figured someone here might want it since they are the shit! Just want what I paid for it. 

Brand new in the box and never even been opened. It is the better “more” package that comes with the really nice heat proof silicon usb-c cable and wall plug and a couple other things. 

$85 is what I paid I think, will double check. Buyer pays shipping and can send it as soon as tomorrow.  I’m in SoCal (OC) but can ship it wherever someone wants. I fucking love this little guy though and you will too!

That must be what I paid then cause that's where I got it. LOL. Just hadn't looked and there were other items I bought with it so couldn't;t recall. Like I said, whatever I paid for it is all I'm looking for.
