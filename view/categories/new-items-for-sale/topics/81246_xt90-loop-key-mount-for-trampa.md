$30 shipped. US only

Machined from Delrin. This is not 3D printed. I made one for my board and had material left so I thought I’d make two more in case someone wanted one. XT90 is pictured for reference. You will need to epoxy in your own. The face is not flat. It has a nice, subtle slope to it from center to edge.

Looks nice!
If you don’t mind, would you like to share with us where to get black xt90s plugs?
Or you just spray painted a usual yellow one?

I know where to get black xt90 plugs, but I never have seen xt90s (the anti spark version) in black.
Also not on hobbyking.
Maybe I just have overseen them?
Could you link me please?

than this is not a good loopkey and it is just a matter of time till the plug or the electronic will be fried.

Thanks bro. What a rookie move. I’ve removed the plugs and ordered new ones. Base only for sale for now

The black base (male part) you can save. But the female part need to be an xt90 anti spark.
