Really have to say that since i switched to Vesc based ESC this board with this high gear ratio feels most aggressive.. nice :sunglasses:

So technically one can use that system on the LaCroix, right? That board uses the same trucks, no?

The problem is not the different Hubadapter, i already got them.
You could use the MBS Hubadapter and use the MBS FiveStar Hub for 9inch.
The problem is that all other Hubs then Superstar are wider so you need to use the truckextension from MBS to make the Supportbearing take place. See pictures from crazy German Quad Helical 9Inch build  :

Haha yeah i know too much projects.... first world problems (-;

In generell i would advice the Mini Gearbox for LaCroix, because you will use 7Inch or smaller.

But in theory you could use any hub, right? Just that you need to implement the MBS truck extension to make it work with the support bearing on othe hubs, which are wider. How about Haggyboard 150 x 45mm Bergmeister All-terrain pneumatic tires, could you use them?

Yeah you have to make an Hubadapter which fits the bolting circle of your desired Hub.
And some spacers for the Truckextension ...Thats IT

[/quote]

A magnet is glued to the motorshaft, a little cuircit boards sith in the Housing in front of the magnet.
This gives you most accurate motorposition ever, great for motors which comes unsensored.
Like the famous SK3
