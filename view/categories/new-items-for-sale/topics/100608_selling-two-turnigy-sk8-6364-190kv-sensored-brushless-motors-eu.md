I bought these Motors for a new board but they don't fit my trucks :( 
Both of the motors have never been used, just opened the package and realized the motorshaft looks out the other end as well. 
As the tax was about 50€ and they are unused, I would like to get 85€ each plus shipping, but i can check for good options.

You want 85, but they're 82 on the website?

Well getting them to europe costs another 50 € in taxes and import fees. If someone can use them I can work something out with them, not completely set on the price.
