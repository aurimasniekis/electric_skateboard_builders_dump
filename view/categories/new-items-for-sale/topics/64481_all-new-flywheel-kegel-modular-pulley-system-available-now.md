The modular pulley design allows you to mix and match pulley sizes and hub adapters. In seconds you can go from 32t to 36t (or 40, 44t). You can also then use the pulleys on different hub adapters. All parts are made from aircraft grade 7075 aluminum and anodized black.

The Flyhweel Hub Works with: 

83, 90, 97, and 107mm Genuine Flywheels
83, 90, and 97mm Clone Flywheels
100mm MBS Wheels
The Kegel Hub Works with: 

80mm Orangatang Kegel (Orange and Purple)
85mm Orangatang Caguma
90mm and 100mm Boa Wheels (All Colors)
The modular hubs uses an 11mm bearing that is shared between the wheel and hub adapter. This allows modular pulleys to be used, (any size: 32, 36, 40, 44t). They can be found here individually or if you want a hub adapter + pulley you can find that here

What trucks will these work with?

Standard Caliber 2 Trucks: it is necessary to flip the outer lock-nut and use only one inner speed ring between the pulley bearing and truck axle
Paris Trucks: same procedure as Caliber 
TorqueBoards 218mm Trucks: fits perfect without and different procedures
Any other truck with 8mm axle and less than 28mm hanger width

The adapters and pulleys are available spereatley:

@brenternet

Here is a pic of my personal Spud build that I have been riding the pulleys on:

![image|666x500](upload://343T7QVzo4FokKyMENmNsDflRN1.jpeg)
I’d say the lock nut is biting 90% and the only reason it is flipped is to ensure it never wobbles off.

Its my fault.  I sent him the bolts but the PO that I use is apparently closed and they aren't accepting packages over 13 o.z so the package sat there for a couple of days before I figured out what was going on.  I retrieved the package and took it to another PO, they are in route now.  My apologies.

News story about the PO in case anyone is interested.

Maybe i got it wrong but when somebody wants to change the tooth count they still have to unscrew the bolts and screw it in again after the change? The only benefit is that you dont have to pull the pulley adapter out of the wheel rims (which literally does not take any time after you have unscrewed the pulley)?
```

---
## \#51 Posted by: JLabs Posted at: 2018-09-01T19:56:38.787Z Reads: 201

```
Yes, you take the bolts out to change the pulley (there is no other way to make them modular). It will take less than half the time compared to a standard bolt through pulley which you then have to mess with to get centered and not wobble (you dont have to do that with these pulleys). Its also cheaper to buy one part (the pulley portion) instead of a whole new one. You also cant see the pulley from the outside of the wheel, giving a much better look compared to bolt through methods.

Edit: I just rambled, dosnt make much sense but dont have the time to retype it.

Essentially balancing the pulley to the wheel is vastly simplified and if you want to change the wheel pulleys tooth count you remove the existing pull piece and replace with the new one while keeping the retainer portion. Faster and no prep work othher than loktite.

Installing the pulleys on Boas. For those who ordered these, please install them with the tall bearing in first, then plop the adapter over. Use a rubber mallet or nylon hammer to tap the adapter because the fit is so snug that you cannot hand press it in. Which brings us to the next question, if in future when i want to remove the adapter to use on another wheel... would be near impossible to take it out unless i use a few prongs to hit the spokes of the adapter from the other end?

 If you do the adapter first and then the bearing, it'll be really difficult. ![40684688_252476788934444_3177021565510352896_n|690x388](upload://oKr02fJwo4UJOKEm3FrniZK1nZO.jpg)

Kegel pulleys fit nicely, this is on 44T

However, the 44T for Abecs have a slight gap, and i've already pushed and tapped the adapter all the way in. @JLabs are your abecs like these too?

Nonetheless, looks awesome compared to bolt on pulleys!

## \#58 Posted by: Linny Posted at: 2018-09-04T07:01:43.579Z Reads: 181

It's 11mm tall. So you gotta look for a 22mm exterior diameter, 10mm interior, 11mm tall. I think 10mm is also fine, as long as it protrudes out a bit and contacts the pulley and the wheel

Thanks for the right up! I actually made an installation tutorial here: https://buildkitboards.com/pages/modular-pulley-installation-guide

They are designed to be tight, this way there is no slop and you know they won’t move around. If you need to get the hub out you can use some M4 bolts to lightly tap it out. The Flywheel Pulley does have the slight gap, I will fix it for the next batch, but I can still fit dual 15mm belts with 6354’s on Calibers, so it’s not the end of the world.

Idk what exactly they are, but if your not short on axle space you can use two bearings (the same you would put in the wheel). One bearing in the wheel and one bearing in the pulley

correct, using two bearings. 

but having clearance issues with psycho's quick mounts for SRz rkp. standard 5mm spacer that comes with axles is too much, axle doesn't thread into the hangar. 

if you remove one 5mm spacer pulley hits the mount.

need to source a 10mmx2mm spacer / washer for this to work.

with 10mm SR axles im going a different route.  going to add a 6mm spacer between wheel bearing and hub and putting a pair of 6000 bearings inside the hub mount.  problem is hub is a hair too big, 26.3mm ID.  ordered some .005"shim stock which should work.  plan b is some loctite 660.  just waiting on parts.

OK.

Surf Rodz peeps, check it!

I'm loving these pulleys!  But, I can't use them the way they were designed to be used, so I'm going my own way here.

I went and inserted a pair of [6000 (10x26x8) bearings](https://www.vxb.com/Ball-Bearings-s/116.htm?searching=Y&sort=13&cat=116&f-10mm=495&show=15&page=1&f-26mm=630) into the modular hub, but they are a little loose.

![20180907_215710|375x500](upload://6gGS0ddjUHUjHwQMtiMiwTea56J.jpg)

Damn!  0.2mm difference!  

I think to myself, 'Need to affix them in there for moar supports!' so I order some loctite 660.  I wait, build batteries, machine aluminum, etc.

In the mean time I'm ordering from McMaster-Carr and I start poking around and stumble on this:

https://www.mcmaster.com/9011k816

Shim Stock?!?!  YES PLEASE!  Prayers answered!  So I order and it shows up.

So I snip some off (16mm wide by about 81mm)... 

![20180907_220516|375x500](upload://rR7j0mwYdtKdFXNhvZdKZaeQmJ.jpg)

...and insert it into the hub.

![20180907_220553|375x500](upload://6lYvtDdDk6yzfEle47Ttzjam5G3.jpg)

Sweet!  Now to press in the bearings!

![looking%20good|498x280](upload://3p2xhwRbDt13ZRdtLEUHvAtdFw5.gif)


Fit is snug, not tight.  Honestly, I may hold off and order this just to try and get a slightly tighter fit.

https://www.mcmaster.com/9011k49

Also, it's going to need a 6mm spacer between the bearing in the wheel and the bearing in the hub.

The saga continues, but miles closer to a (hopefully) great fit for Surf-Rodz!  :smiley:

Thanks for making these pulleys @jlabs!

I typically use 80mm, stock is 70mm.  @psychotiller has 90mm axles, at least he did a while back.

Here's info on 80mm & 100mm, I didn't see any 90mm available.

To anyone using these , use a clamp or press to make sure that fucker is *in* 


You can test if it’s fully flushed by putting it on the axel , ensureing it’s secured by the speed ring before it and nylon locknut after it. Spin it and if the pulleys spin is like a parabola (I don’t know the proper name for it) then on part is not fully flushed. 


To make mine flush with a clamp I put small wood that covered the pulley (but not the wheel since the wheel was taller than the pulley) and clamp that fucker straight to hell. After that , a super nearly perfect spin

ok.  here's what ive come up with.

insert a 1/4" high 10mm ID spacer between the wheel bearing and the two bearings inside the hub.

![20180917_212529|375x500](upload://v25cXAZihGGIVmVu9htqikyrAUu.jpg)

add a third bearing into the pulley

![20180917_212448|374x500](upload://1h79QYLPkAG7OK3QeDlpIrofkGC.jpg)

![20180917_212337|374x500](upload://4LQXq4vOVdHHDXhokR3drav3StX.jpg)

and secure the pulley to the hub.

screw this assembly into the hanger.

![20180917_212106|374x500](upload://eipo4oIlOu1ywGsZElLNREp6rsP.jpg)

this needs 90mm axles.  fit is perfect.  and having that bearing inside the actual pulley is super sweet.

Also, I made 2mm spacers, but I fucked up an operation in the CAM and all the holes were 0.5mm too small.  FML.

Is anyone else using Popocas? They’re aren’t listed on the compatible list but I’m using them anyway since I like kegals and feel 90mm is that great point between big but not to big. 

I feel like because the way the wheel is , causes issues where the belt touches the wheel in a way 

Any advice ?
