Hey everyone. I got a few spare Maytech VESC for future builds which don't seem to be happening. I decided to sell them here. They are all brand new. I can solder on the xt-90 connectors for free. $5.99 for shipping. Here are some pics:

not questioning you or anything, but are these legit? Don't maytech ones have the cardboard logo thing at the top?

edit: I am questioning you, just want to know why these dont have them

I ripped it off if you meant the sticker that goes on top of the capacitors. I sold them all btw. This thread can be closed.
