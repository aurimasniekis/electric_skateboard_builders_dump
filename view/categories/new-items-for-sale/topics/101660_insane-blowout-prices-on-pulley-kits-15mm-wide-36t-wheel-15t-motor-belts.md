Hi Guys,

Many of you know I've been selling pulley kits on here for a while.  I've been out of the esk8 game for a bit since having a kid, and I've finally got to gathering up the last of my inventory from the garage.  I need to makes space for other stuff, so I'm going to clear this out at ridiculous prices if you buy multiple kits.  Offer good while supplies last!

**1 Kit = $30**

**2 Kits = $50**

**4 Kits = $70**

**8 kits = $110**

**10 kits = $120**

Prices includes shipping in US and Canada.

Iâ€™m interested in 2 kits. Do these work with caliber 2 trucks without modification ?

Pm sent.  Yes. It should generally work on caliber 2 without modifications but does depend on the width of your motor mounts.

I'm a three-summer Boosted rider based out of Kitchener just looking up parts to do a DIY, and this looks like it would be a great fit for my build. Do you have a listing or are you just taking paypal/EMT directly?

Ahhh still on the fence here. One nice thing I'm noticing about your wheel pulley is that it just hangs off the wheel with enough clearance to continue using the wheel's own board-side bearing. This is in contrast to ones like Metroboard where a separate bearing means you need a truck with an axle longer than the usual ~3cm. I already have some nice Paris trucks that I'd like to use, so that is pushing me in this direction.

I need 2 15 tooth motor pulleys, with the 8mm shaft bore. Also do you have 72 tooth wheel pulleys, to fit the same?  Basically, I am looking for a drive setup for my electric mountain board. Good luck with the new family. Thanks.
