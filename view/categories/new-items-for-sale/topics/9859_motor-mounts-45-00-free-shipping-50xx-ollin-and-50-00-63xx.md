I have motor mounts for Ollin 5065 motors and 30mm dia center to center (21mm x 21mm square center to center).  

**Pricing**
Clamp for Calliber trucks - 25.00
Motor mount for Ollin (38mm hole pattern) motor - 25.00
Motor mount with 30mm hole pattern - 25.00

**If you bought ONE clamp and ONE motor mount together - 45.00 + free USA shipping**

The mount is raw 6061 aluminum and comes with hardware for the mount and motor.
It is fully adjustable- I am using 36/16 gearing with 255 belt and the mount still has room so could probably do 265 depending on gearing.

See [Interest for Ollin motor mount OM5065-200](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/interest-for-ollin-motor-mount-om5065-200/7918)

Is the 38mm standard with the 6355 motors? Or 30?

Not sure what the standard for 63xx motors are. The 38 is for the 50xx Ollin motor and the 30 is for a few of the generic (NTM prop 50) motors.

I made 3 mounts for @sl33py that fit SK3 63mm (149kv). The hole pattern was 32mm square center to center. 

If he doesnt want them I can sell you one or I can make another one but it will be another week- week and a half to have it made. I'm going to give him a few more days before I offer them up for anyone to buy.

I just sold out of the 30mm arm. I just have the Ollin hole pattern which I think just fits his motors but not 100 percent sure, it may fit others. It is 38 mm diva center to center. 

I still have about 6 left.

I have a few mounts left and will be making another order if anyone is interested.  I have been doing quite a few mounts for 63mm Tacon and SK3s in aluminum arms and stainless arms.  Let me know if you need something different and I can see I can make it. Just did a pair of arms out of .25" stainless per someones specs.

I might be interested in two mounts for 63mm motors. I got @torqueboards v4 mount, but can't reverse mount it since the angle I need it in is somewhere where the screw holes aren't present. Should I PM you the specifics, or have you reverse mounted before with 70~mm center distance?
```

## \#21 Posted by: korryh Posted at: 2016-10-06T21:57:15.285Z Reads: 604

```
They can be reversed.  I made these for Sl33py and their CTC is 60.45mm to 73.2mm.  The all aluminum will be 45.00 per mount and the aluminum clamp with .25"stainless arm will be 60.00. Just let me know the motor mounting hole pattern. Correction  - the all aluminum for 50xx motor is 45.00 and the all aluminum 63xx is 50.00 both with free shipping.

That's pretty much what I need! I just want to make sure that it will get the angles I need. I think it will be okay since your screw slots on the mounting plate are longer than TB's. I'll confirm c distance tonight and get back to you.

To clarify you mean it's $60 for clamp + plate?

Yeah, I'm pretty interested at getting one and it's still cheaper from you than anywhere else, could you just confirm the CTC distance on the 63 mount plate?.

I've been reading into it a little as well, is there a way you could say the value of the parcel for shipping is less than ¬£15 for my end, cause that way import tax can be avoided, which would be one less cost to worry about.

The max is 73.2mm for the mounts coming in today or tomorrow.  If you want one with a larger C to C let me know what you need and I can have one made up.  If I can get the order in today I can have it by Monday or Tuesday to send out to you.  If I don't get it in today then I wont be able to order till Monday, then another week to have it made and shipped to me.

@TheLastEnting,  Just got the mount all packed up and ready, it was cheaper than I thought to ship it to you - only 13.50 USD.  so 50.00 for the 63xx hole pattern mount and 13.50 for shipping = 63.50 USD.  

My PayPal is khoglan@msn.com - please let me know when you send payment and I can see if I can get it out today.

No, but the thought did cross my mind. I wonder if you could run two parallel motors on one esc? Hmmm. Tank tracks come to mind again. 

@korryh made me these extra long mounts for my unconventional mountain board build, and was kind enough to add a second set of mounting holes at a standard center to center distance. That way when my project fails or I change my mind, I could use these on another board with regular size wheels, pulleys & belts.

Yes, do you want the version above or one without the shortest set of holes.  The CTC would be 100mm to 115mm, will this work or do you know what size you are looking for.  Do you just want to use the arms/plates and just use the clamps you have or do you need clamp as well

@korryh do you happen to have clamp rings that would fit MBS Matrix 2 trucks, or even the old Matrix trucks? I want to transfer my extra long mounts to my new eMTB, if possible.

Lol, I just had some cut and they will be in tomorrow. They fit my 63xx arm. I bought the matrix pro 2 trucks with the short trampa deck and am using the razor go kart 113mm wheels. I had to do some screwy thing with the bearings but they are working so far. 

I'll let you know how they fit and have some cut for you.

Oh hell yeah! Glad I asked. Let me know when they're ready and I'll take a pair. That's the last part I need for my build. I might even grab a pair of your 63xx mount plates also, so I can use them with the caliber clamps on another build. You can never have too many mounts!

You don't happen to also have clamps for the older Matrix or Trampa trucks do you? They both look like they use basically the same hanger design, so I would hope clamps for Trampa trucks would work for Matrix too.

I don't have a clamp for the older matrix or trampa but if you can give me dimensions or the truck I could cut some. 

I only had 2 of the matrix 2 cut for a first run. If it works I'll let you know and I can order more. If it needs to be modified I'll modify and see if you want a set.

Ok, that sounds good. I'm definitely in for a set of the Matrix 2 clamps when your done testing them.

I'll take some measurements of my old Matrix 1 trucks and send them to you. Those trucks are actually about 15 years old, but look like they still use the same hanger as the Matrix 1 trucks.

I'll take some tomorrow.  Yes the wheels have the 5 spokes. I modeled up some hubs and @idea is printing some pulleys. 

Since 12mm id x 22mm od doesn't exist I had to use 12mm x21mm and use a shi in the wheel so the bearing fits tight.

Here are some pics of the Trampa short deck with MBS matrix 2 trucks and Razor go Kart wheels at 113mm (4.5") dia and 62mm (2.5") wide. Now I just need @whitepony segmented enclosure and quickly learn how to make a battery from the batteries I bought and good to go.

@Mobutusan - the truck ring fits nicely on the MBS matrix.  I am going to drill and tap some holes this week ens and make sure and if all goes well I will order you a pair on monday.  Do you want the 63xx arms also or just the rings.

That looks really good. Those wheels look like they would work well with some 10mm trucks and bearings, but that's cool that you're adapting them to the 12mm trucks. I'm curious to see the finished product. 

Out of curiosity, could you measure the inner diameter of the rim of those wheels? I'm thinking it might be possible to modify those to fit onto my Hummie or Jacob hub motors. Any idea what the durometer is?

And as far a the Matrix 2 rings, how much would it cost for just the 2 rings and how much with 2 63xx mount arms also? You can PM me if you like.

The matrix rings are 25.00 each and with 63xx arms are 50.00 (clamp and arm).

I would go with regular Caliber 2 50 10" trucks (50 is the angle) Jet.com has them for 35.00
I got my deck at skateshred.com - they have added quite a few more to choose from since I bought mine - great quality.
http://www.skateshred.com/index.php/wholesale-blank-longboard-decks/40-x-10-kicktail-blank-deck-bamboo.html

@Titoxd10001 has some great pulley kits for Abec and clone wheels (found on ebay) at an awesome price.  You will need 83mm and above dia wheels.  83mm will work but 90mm and above works better.

@Idea also makes pulleys for any size wheel.

I would use a VESC from @zmoney from axle.  I bought mine from diyelectric which seem to be working fine but Axle stands behind their product and seems to be better quality and less expensive.

hope this helps.

Are you still working on making clamps for MBS Matrix and Matrix Pro? Sure wanna use what I already have for the build. Been looking into electrifying my mbs for four years, this year I am planning to finally do it. Let me know.

@Redster72. I have the clamp working well just working on the arm length that attaches to the motor. What size wheel pulley do you plan to use. I'll be putting in an order next week and could make you a couple if you want.

Honestly I don't know what size pulley yet because I am trying to find out where to source them. Looking for pulleys to fit on MBS aluminum wheels. Do you have any leads? Thank you by the way for making this for the community.

Thanks @NAT-Frank,  great pic.

 @anorak234 I get them cut in Phoenix.  I used to live there and used a bunch of fab shops that I am still in contact with and have good relationships.  They let me do small quantities when I need them. I dont know anyone in the area that will cut anything for under 50.00 but it is California and everything is expensive.

@Kasper It looks like the trucks have a caliber shape and the motor is a standard 44mm-45mm hole pattern which will fit my mount.  I don't know 100 percent that the trucks will fit the mount, worst case you could file the mount if needed.  Shipping would be 22.50 usd so 122.50 for both mounts shipped. I am waiting on Jaymu86 to see if he wants a mount and if he doesnt then I can ship 2 mounts to you on Tuesday. Someone bailed out on their order so I have 2 left,   Ill let you know tomorrow.    I am making  an order end of this week so I could have your mounts in 2 weeks if Jaymu86 buys one.

I dont have them available now but can have them made and in my hands in a week and a half so as soon as you order the pulley let me know and I can make the mount and if all goes well, you will have them both around the same time.

@Wilsonliang777 I have you down for a Clamp - they should be in on Friday so I can send them out on Monday.  I will let you know when they arrive and get payment on Saturday or sunday.

@gottagoslow - I dont make many of the mounts for the SK3 50xx.  They have a 25mm X hole pattern and not much demand.  There were 2 out of the 30 I ordered for friday but all of the mounts are spoken for.  Depending on your time frame I can make another order but it will probably be another 2 weeks. Let me know how many you need and what you want to do.

No, I didnt.  I just have the matrix ll. From reading other posts it looks to be a pain in the ass to get everything to line up without cross supports.  Since I have the mounts cut by waterjet and do all the drilling and taping in my garage I have to keep the process simple.  I dont make much money on the mounts, mainly do it to help others and for therapeutic reasons - I wouldnt be able to be competitive with others making the mounts.  I did the matrix ll because I am making a cruiser with trampa deck, MBS trucks and razor go kart wheels - almost done.

Yes I can ship to Israel. I have 4 mounts cut but I need to drill and tap some holes so I could get them out on Tuesday. Shipping will be 23.00 (for both 2 or 4 mounts) and mounts are 50.00 each. 
My PayPal is khoglan@msn.com
Thanks

Unfortunately it will not be cheaper. I have shipped to London, Israel, Ireland, Canada and a few other places, shipping seems to be the same outside if the US. The mounts are between 7 and 8 oz which is 14.00 to ship outside the US then up to 2 pounds is 24.00 to ship.

Update** I sold the mounts I had on hand. It will take 1.5 to 2 weeks to get more.

If you want one (or more) Let me know, my PayPal is khoglan@msn.com and I will get them ordered.

@adman - here is the stainless mountainboard mount plate compared to an aluminum plate. The aluminum plate is .25‚Äù and the stainless is .12‚Äù. If you decide on the stainless version and you don‚Äôt feel it works for you, I will make you the original aluminum mount and you can send the stainless back.

The thread is getting long so I am adding pics and instructions again.

Price list for motor mounts that fit Caliber trucks:
50xx motor mounts 45.00 (Ollin and Other please specify which motor)
60xx motor mounts 50.00 (regular or mountain board)

I can do a stainless arm but will cost 5.00 more for .2" thick (maybe overkill) and no upcharge for .13" thick.

I can also make MBS Matrix 2 mounts (see below pic) - uses a ring with 2 6mm set screws.  I have been using for 3 months and works great.

Free US shipping

::Below:: The top shows the .25 aluminum arm for regular 36ish pulleys and the bottom is Stainless for mountain boards (can also be aluminum) and has a couple holes for tension pulleys if needed.  The smaller holes near the motor could be used for a spanner bar or plate if needed as well.

Hello! New to the forums but long time reader. 

I am going to be upgrading a current build, and would like to purchase two mounts from you for dual 6355 motors (likely from TB) and for caliber II trucks. Do you need any other information or is this sufficient?

I don‚Äôt think so but I‚Äôll check this evening when I get home. It‚Äôs for caliber trucks, right. Do you need the entire mount or just the clamp.
