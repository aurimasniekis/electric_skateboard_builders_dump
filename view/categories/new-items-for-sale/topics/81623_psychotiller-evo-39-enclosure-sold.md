Hey guys, I have a brand new Psychotiller evo enclosure up for sale. I was going to do an evo build and bought this in preparation for that but I ended up building my own deck from scratch instead.

The enclosure is in new condition and has the advantage of being able to ship immediately. When I originally ordered mine from the site it took a week to actually ship and then ~5 biz days to arrive; I'm guessing this might be because they are made to order. Anyway, this one is obviously manufactured and good to go.

Original price was 75 shipped (65 + 10 shipping); I'm looking for 55 shipped CONUS. Send me a message if you're interested. Located in Dallas, TX (local pickup for 45)

Thanks!
