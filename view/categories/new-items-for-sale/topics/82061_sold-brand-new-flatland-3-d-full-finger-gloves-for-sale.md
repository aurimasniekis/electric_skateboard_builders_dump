Hi there! I received my flatland-3 D gloves yesterday. 

The gloves that arrived have one minor blemish. The middle finger plastic guard for the right hand glove is just a little loose. It can easily be fixed by applying some glue. The manufacturer sent me a replacement so I'm getting rid of these. 

SIZE - LARGE 

Asking for $30 OBO + cost of shipping which should not be more than $5-7.

Man I just inspected the gloves again after seeing this. I definitely expected perfection at this price range.
