Its an aluminium enclosure which acts as a heat sink and houses all major vesc's!! 
Polished lid with optional window, carbon wrap to match the carbon mount

That s*cks! I was just redoing a build and it's been hard to find nice enclosures bc the kit that I ordered came with an enclosure, which is way too big and way too heavy...
Once I saw this it looks exactly like something I was picturing.
Do you know if he was just showing it off or was this something he was advertising?
Thanks though!  Jason

I was guessing he wanted to sell them, hence my pm. but looks like i am wrong. he has been inactive for 7days so idk :tipping_hand_man:
