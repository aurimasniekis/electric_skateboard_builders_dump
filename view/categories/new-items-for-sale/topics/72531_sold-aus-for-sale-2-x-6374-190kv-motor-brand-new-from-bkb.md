Hi All, 
I was a n00b and missed the comment on the BKB site about the 6374 motors being approx 84mm long... see link below:

https://buildkitboards.com/collections/motors/products/6374-190kv-motor

...I paid $260 USD for the pair but these wont fit my setup so does anyone want to buy them?
Say $200 AUD for the pair + shipping to wherever you are?

Sorry Pete too negative on the pitch...there just going to sweat you and wait for a price drop.
That's a lie. There the most honest bunch I've never met...

Start a new thread...
Most powerful reliable motors I've ever had.
Shredded my drivetrain half throttle
Willing to part with close to half price
Deceased estate...
Misses says its them or me....:innocent:

Worst case scenario I buy them...:heart:
Cant believe there not sold...

Lol. @mars, that post was a journey. 😂 
... I THINK you were offering the $200 deal.(?)... so ping me a PM with you addy and I’ll get a shipping quote to you?. :slight_smile:

If I haven’t heard in 12 hours or so I’ll assume i read the poem wrong and I’ll let you know @dareno
 
Cheers. Pete
