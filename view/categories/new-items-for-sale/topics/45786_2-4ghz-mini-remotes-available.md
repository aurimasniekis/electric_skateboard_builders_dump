Does that store link not ship to Canada? When I do the shipping estimation for the nickel strip, it just says $0 for ground or $1.99 for pickup :confused:

i mean...if you wanna come up to downtown la, sure.

it takes two days to deliver within socal, may just be worth paying the $4 for shipping, that's cheaper than getting here.

Eh, guess I'll do that since you mentioned $4 shipping. To get there and back it would be almost 2 gallons of gas for me.

Plus my board is out of commission this week so I can wait.

Just got the remote üëçüèΩ
Question: after bidding controller, do I have to do those ppm configurations on the vesc tool for the remote ?

```
ah...if I'm understanding the question correctly, yes mess around with the remote trim and ppm config in the bldc tool. 

you want to signal to show 100% at full throttle and -100% at full brake. there's two values you'd set in the ppm tab to get that just right.

this 8mm stuff is for another non-esk8 related battery build but for the upcoming 12s6p pack I'm using single layer 10mm on P groups and S connections with copper strand
