I have a brand new never been used FOCbox Unity from Bioboards esk8.  Unfortunately, it does not come in the original black box but it has never been used. It comes with upgraded 5.5mm motor wires and xt90 battery connector.  All original wires included.  Asking $320 shipping included, US only.

You have to pay taxes on Amazon, which brings it to about $330.  Plus this has upgraded connectors done by Bioboards, so it's done right.
