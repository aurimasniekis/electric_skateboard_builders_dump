You might want to try 75v mosfets for anything over 10s 😁

When I saw title I clicked to cheer up ! ... **then I saw how you mounted your heatsinks the wrong way** and I've instead reacted like this :

A friendly tip : simply mount the heatsinks on the back of the PCB, lined with the FETs. 

At least it will be useful because for now, it doesn't work better than **a regular flawed anti-spark**. Guys wait for correction and keep your money before buying this.

Either I'm obsessed or _maybe_ I'm simply **fucking tired** of seeing people produce the same mistakes again & again, then complain afterwards that a piece of component is not reliable. 

The hobby we are enjoying is a dangerous one, and we always ask more & more from our setups. Newcomers are not exception, one day they see a 12S / 13S board kicking ass at 40mph and they want to build the same. Except that the same people did never skate this fast before. 

Soooooo the least help one can do is provide reliable components, then at least boards can be a reliable piece of work instead of a future bomb.

But maybe you're right, I'm simply _obsessed_ and should close an eye when I see something which'll lead to future failures.

flier eswitches are garbage. I burned up no less than 10 of those things learning the hard way that they can't handle 12S for shit. They can barely handle 10S for any length of time and are a regular replacement item on 6S as well. They just suck in boards. Probably great for RC cars and planes.

You should just upgrade the mosfets

Flier has 2 variants.

1-12S, 120A -> most places stock these
1-16S, 300A -> seen them on APS and one seller on eBay, expensive

Which ones did you use?

I actually am in contact with Flier and if 5 ppl join we will meet MOQ to get them. Price is around $50.

$50 per unit? or is that the buy in? They retail for about $85 so that's not terrible. I want to see what's in them.

The soldering looks terrible man... Zenner looks too small for its original designed size which means it's not according to design requirements.
