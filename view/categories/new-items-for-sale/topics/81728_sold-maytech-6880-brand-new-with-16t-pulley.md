I’ve recently placed an order from maytech for a bunch of 6880s 190kv motors
I have 4 of them left that I have no use for 
They’re brand new 
Selling them for $125 plus actual shipping cost (US only) 
They come with 16t motor pulley 

Some highlights 
190kv 
5.5mm bullet connectors
10mm axle 
Standard mount hole pattern meaning they fit 63xx motor platesno mods needed 

Pm if you’re interested 
I have the motors with me ready to ship 👌🏼![image|375x500](upload://2RrV6I6u6wCgOMwF5fnJp1lYZ5g.jpeg)
