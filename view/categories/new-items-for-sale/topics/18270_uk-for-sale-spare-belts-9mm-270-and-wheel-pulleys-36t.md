Selling: 
4x 9mm 270-5m HTD belts
2 sets of 3D printed wheel pulleys 36T

I'm selling the unused belts after I bought them a while back before realising I'd need shorter (255mm) belts. 

The pulleys are slightly used, I didn't print them myself. They seem very good quality, can't fault them at all. I'm looking to change to a 12mm drive since I'm a bit large for a single 9mm! 

Will sell Pulleys Â£10 each, all belts for Â£10. (+Postage)

Would prefer UK but if people wanna pay extra postage for abroad that's no problem.

Excuse terrible pictures just took on iPad 

Cheers ðŸ˜Š
