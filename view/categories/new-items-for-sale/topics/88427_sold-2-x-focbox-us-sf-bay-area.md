I have these two brand new, never used FOCboxes still in the delivery bubble wrap. 

![image|666x500](upload://zoBfQbDU6TX74JGoORbmm7tylQw.jpeg) 

Asking $200 for both + shipping (US only, priority 2 day shipping so around $10-15) + goods & services fee. Ships next business day after payment with tracking. I'm not in a hurry to sell them so price ***non-negotiable***. Only buy it if you really need something right now or if you're prepping for a race and it's 3 days out and you still don't have ESCs ü§£

Edit: is this a record? From posted to sold in 8 minutes? üòÖ
