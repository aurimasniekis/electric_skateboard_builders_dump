Good evening Ladies and Gents,

I have some very nice O'tang wheels with some very nice pulleys from Boosted HQðŸ˜‚

The pulleys have 54 teeth and are 16mm wide (for 15mm belts) and they come with 4 zealous bearings for the front Kegels, 2 normal bearings for the back wheels and 2 larger bearings for the pulley.

I will ship them for â‚¬95 all inclusive!
