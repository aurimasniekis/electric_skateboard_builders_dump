Selling this deck for â‚¬100 plus shipping out of Spain. I was going to use it for a build but ended up going with a flexible deck. So it's been standing around in my apt for a few months, never been used and only has some very minor scratch marks from storage. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/3/632f6f1a1c4cc85eb3c18735cd21ccd957e91877.jpg" width="666" height="500">

This is one of my favorite decks, I have one as well.  The W concave is lush.  If you were in the states Id probably get it.

Interested  but the shipping probably puts on par with sickboards.nl?  Also I can hide a vesc or two from the wife, decks are trickierðŸ˜‡

Just checked, shipping out of Spain is way more expensive than into Spain from most countries - ridiculous. With GLS to Ireland it would be around â‚¬45...:/ maybe I just need to build another board..:) what do you like this deck for, in comparison to a Loaded Vanguard? Better for control at high speeds?
