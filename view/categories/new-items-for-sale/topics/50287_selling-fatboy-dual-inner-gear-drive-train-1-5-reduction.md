FatBoy Dual Inner Gear Drive Train for Trampa MTB. Gears milled in-house using inner-gear style gearing with much higher tooth size for hardcore power delivery. The unified hub and gear part makes a whole construction much stiffer than it's predecessor. This kit does not require any alteration to the Trampa Vertigo hanger (Other hangers were not tested).

The demand is not such big for it so we decided to not make it anymore, other versions are much more popular. I don't say we will not make parts for it if needed just won't make a kits ;)

@3DServisas  Let me get this right; will this 5:1 drive fit the FatBoy wheels as well as Superstar?
![image|427x34](upload://wKXfaziDSgSQC0aUBlmIbcamFcu.png)

If so will buy some FatBoys when you do your next production run(?), I'm about to give up on using these 9" wheels. If not then I'll get some Superstars

I'll use the 9" with pulleys on another build where tolerances are not so important

We are accepting pre-orders with lead time of 1-2 weeks to collect information on wanted quantity on this drive. 

Also some changes were made to the design, gear tooth profile was modified for better meshing for lower noise. Motor mounting plate and hanger mounting hub.

Hey man, is it possible to mount the motors on the opposite side with these? 

ie. I'm thinking about using a set on my front Trampa trucks with small 40mm or 50mm motors for a 4wd config and it'd be nice to have the front motors sitting behind the truck (deck side) so they're not sticking out from the front of the board. 

Would also mean I can still use the front truck as a handle when I'm pulling the board around with me :)

The trampa baseplate will not allow motor to fit. Do you meant length 40 50mm? because this has only 63mm mounting hole pattern
