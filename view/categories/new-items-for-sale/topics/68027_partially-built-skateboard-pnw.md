Not sure if anyone out there would be interested in buying a partially built board.  Was building a starter board for a friend that lost interest.  The only items needed to complete the build is a VESC, remote, receiver, battery and charger.  Everything is brand new has never been outside or ridden

Specs:
-8ply drop down deck (40" long x 9.75" wide) w/ high quality grip tape
-N5055 Motor Mounted (Black, 270KV, 1400W, unsensored)
-Bolt On Motor Mount (Black)
-7.25'' Truck (Black)
-36T Drive Wheel Pulley (HTD5) 13mm width
-12T Motor Pulley (HTD5) 13mm width
-250-5M High Torque Timing Belt (HTD5) 12mm width
-83mm 78a Longboard Wheels
-1/2" Rubber Risor pads
