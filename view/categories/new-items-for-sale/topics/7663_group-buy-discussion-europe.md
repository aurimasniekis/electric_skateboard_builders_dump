Hello,

I would like to organise a group buy on year to help you guys out and myself..

I am currently looking to buy a controller and I thought it would be a good idea to have a group buy

The controllers we could group buy are the benchwheel remote

Winning small 2.4ghz remote as seen here

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/2-4ghz-nano-remote-in-stock-30-pcs-usa-50-free-priority-shipping-international-45-shipping/5017/11

For around $47-50



Trigger style as seen here

Wait isn't the "Winning" remote the one that Enertion uses and not the Nano Remote you linked?
