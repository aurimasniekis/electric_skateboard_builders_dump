Hi all,

Since I don't have time anymore to complete this DIY build I'm selling all my parts. At this point I'm not selling individual parts _yet_. I'm located in the Netherlands and willing to ship anywhere, buyer pays for shipping.

**Lots of stuff has already been sold.**

**Some used parts:**
- Turnigy Eskate VESC
