I removed it from the packaging for a visual inspection (which was good) Other than that its new.

I got two of these but this one does not fit in my second build. Back to focboxes reluctantly.

**Asking £180 plus postage**, I paid £265 after import duties. I will post same day or next day to the buyer.
