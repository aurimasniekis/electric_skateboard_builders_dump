Sooo, I need to get rid of some stuff to calm down my domestic finance minister.

Asking Price: 250â‚¬ + shipping. (I also paid some steep import fees, that I am not looking to get back here)
 
I originally wanted to use these with the carvon Torque Drive I ordered many moons ago and am still waiting for.

In the meantime I bought this single 2.5 Carvon drive and need to refinance by selling these beauties.

It's glorious when you're eyeing something out in another country but the import hassle and costs are putting you off then this happens. Destiny.
