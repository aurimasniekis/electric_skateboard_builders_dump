I wanted another set three weeks ago badly I was waiting for someone like you .. then I bought two set of the torquedrive on his flash sale. Because after riding these thing are fast already 2wd mid power is awesome... i don't have braking issues either ..but it not friendly in  the congestion city running..I only weigh 150pds so I have no torque issue other then trying not to get blown off ..I always push at least twices ..i get to 48 50k and it still has quarter stick left easy and lots of power it wants to go..i need full gear to try any more...they are super fun at 15-20k and up to 40k carving hard and roosting cyclist with dirt as I pass them..lol..and the sound is awesome if you can find something else to sell I would highly recommend my friend

Is this still available? I'm interested! Just checking with Damon to see that it'll work with my LHB Witchblade because he will be the one doing the upgrade.

Also think about getting adapters from Carvon and cutting the sleeve.
