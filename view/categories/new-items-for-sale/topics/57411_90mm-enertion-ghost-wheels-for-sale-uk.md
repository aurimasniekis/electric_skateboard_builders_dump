I have two sets in the wrappers,  enertion 90mm front ghost wheels (4 wheels total). Would make a nice set for a commuter board with the kegel core.
I ordered these a long time ago and plans have changed in the months of waiting...
£40 plus postage the set. I'd rather not loose out on PayPal charges if it can be avoided.
I can add photos tomorrow night.

Hi,
As it happens I’ve just yesterday stuck them on a push along board!
They’ve been along the road for a mile or two now. 
Would you still be interested?

I've not really ridden them enough but in an extremely scientific poke test I deduce that the popocas are softer.

I've not given it much thought. Possibly. A good offer could prise them out of my "must build something out of this" box
They're currently built up as a dual 6355 drivetrain on calibers, 15-32 tooth pulleys.
