Hello, guys I made a mistake and shipped the incorrect enclosure to a forum member in NY, so I have two options: sell it at discounted price or ship it back and take the loss for both shipping costs, I rather go with the first.

The enclosure itself runs for US$ 125, I'm willing to let it go for US$ 80 plus shipping.

Uhm, I'm not sure about it as the shape goes along with the lines from underneath the Zenith.

I don't have any meassures of the enclosure at hand, I'll try to get this information from Max and will get back to you
