Tired of dirty or worried about gunk stuck in open air motor? Fear, not the Black Covered 6355 is for you. :sunglasses:

Rated at 170kv, this is the perfect motor for MASSIVE torque, strong breaks, and designed to conquer the steepest hill. Did I mention they were hall sensored? Take advantage of the sensored wire and deliver the smoothest experience in skateboard startups.:ok_hand: This is compatible with BLDC and FOC in sensored mode. I recommend using BLDC hyrbid. **Every motor** is pre-tested for quality assurance.

Really eye-catching on the street; perfect fit for all black theme.:black_circle: Equipped with a marble smooth outrunner cover, the design brings less drag and sufficient heat dissipation. With a submillimeter gap between outrunner and top cover, the motor is guaranteed to preserve the delicate coils and sensors. After riding the 6374, I can assure that the motor is just as good as other brands(TB) and a bit more efficient.

**This is a 6374 counter part put together to show what it looks like**

In terms of torque, how does this compare to dual turnigy sk3 6374s with 190kv each? 
Haven't even finished mine yet and I'm already thinking of upgrading. The weight savings alone would be great!

Can we get photographs of the inside?  Is there sealant?  Are the magnets in retainer rings?  What kind of magnets are they?  Is it waterproof?

The Maytech branding makes me wary.

>Fear, not the Black Covered 6355 is for you.

I'm also not sure whether I should be afraid or not.

Aaaaand why does it look like your only photos show a motor with scuffs and scrapes. Are they new or used?

I would say there is 80% of the torque of 6374. All 6374 motors feel the same. So you would get .8 of the performance you get from a dual 6374 on dual 6355

Torque is a matter of kv, and copper mass, can size alone isn't a good indicator
Also sealed, means less cooling, hotter at high current/torque

@ZackoryCramer you listed these as new, are they? If not, how many miles,etc

They are all indeed new, only spun them to see if they were legit. There are scratches because I just threw them in a box for storage. :stuck_out_tongue: I don't know much about calculating kv from scratch, but I am sure they are 170kv.

For real tho? I don’t like to talk about other vendors but if your going to sell a ‘new’ product I wouldn’t “throw them in a box” to get all scratched up..

I had that domain for a bit, thought I would put it to use before expiring. :roll_eyes: Never thought about selling at that time. You're right should've at least kept the carboard container. :upside_down_face:

Hmm seems like you mounted it and everything, scratches right where rocks would normally hit the motor
