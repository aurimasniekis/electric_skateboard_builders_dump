Hi all,

New topic with the remaining parts:

- ABEC11 Flywheels 90mm, lime green, never used [ **80€** ]

- 10x HDT5M 330mm 12mm belts [ **1x7€ | 2x12€ | 3x15€ | 10x40€** ]
 
- 3x 12mm motor pulleys [ **1x4€ | 2x7€ | 3x10€** ]

- 2x Dual FoxBox 3D printed mounts from BKB [ **1x10€ | 2x15€** ]

Everything to be shipped from Madrid/Spain, so I prefer to negotiate with EU members. Shipping costs not included.

Some pics...

If you really (like really) wanna get rid of those abec 11's, I can take them for €60+shipping to Denmark.
