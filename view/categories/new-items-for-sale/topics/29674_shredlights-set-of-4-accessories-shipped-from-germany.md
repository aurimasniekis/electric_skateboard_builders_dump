Ordered from the UK for new build but not needed after all.

95 EUR plus whatever shipping applies (I think shipping is like 6,99 with DHL within Europe) (it's what I paid after conversion, proof of purchase available). Not looking to make a dime here, just wanting to help out in case somebody is looking for a full set.

Shoot me a PM if interested :)

I wouldn't recommend using DHL, after 10-20 days you get a bill from DHL in your mail box, and the cost is 45$. I live in Norway
