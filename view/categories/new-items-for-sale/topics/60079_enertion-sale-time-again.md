Wheels are tempting... I was never quite sure, is it just the rear 'outwheels' that crack and fail, or the front too?

Based on that remote price it seems the new model (with screen) they teased a while back can't be far off ðŸ¤”.

whats the difference between the outwheels and the other ones? those 100mm's look like rebranded mbs wheels tbh

EDIT: NVM lol its just a difference of the cores from what i can tell... looks like the front uses kegal style cores while the back uses the raptor cores

Where did you read about wheel cracking on these? New to me

Although I have not tries them, the core is advertised as very strong - 97mm Ghost
_Super Strong Nylon & Glass Fiber injection Molded Core & Inner Radial Core_

100mm Crossover
Super Strong Nylon & Glass Fiber injection Molded Core

Maybe the thane, chunking?

What' the feeling on these wheels in comparisson to ABEC11/Boa/Kegels/MBS?

Interested in opinions even if they are like assholes

**Edit:** Looks like the 97mm wheels are sold out

If you scroll up that thread you'll see several photos of badly cracked wheels.

Guess that response from enertionsupport kind of answers my question. They wouldn't be on sale if they were guaranteed ok.

The problem is always the shipping cost. IF someone organize a group buy for the wheels I am in for a set of 90mm wheels.

Good link. I scanned it and can surmise as so -

The 'cracking issue' seems to be about the thane and not the core, that is an important point

The thane appears to delaminate on the hub versions and not the front wheel, there has been some questions over whether they were poured in the same factory.

The 90/97mm appear prone to chunking.

The crossovers have a clone-like hardness, although some have said use them on trails/bad rural roads & you get the advantage. I read one report by @Battosaii who compared them to MBS wheels and found them too hard, not sure if he tries shaving them.

A shaved Crossover may be a good thing, the middle section which gets the contact looks even narrower than a MBS, they may like the MBS hold up well in regards to chunking to to profile rather than formula?

Actually the 97 and crossover front wheels have the same problem they were made with the same formula. The only good wheels right now are the original front 90mm wheels they were made in California.

I was very excited to see this sale finally as I need two Focboxes. Purchased two and a set of wheels only to find out from their sales team that the wheels are defective. No where on the webpage does it say that! Only says clearance items are sold "as is." Which is no distinction from a clearance item that no longer stocked and isn't defective. 

I tried with their sales team to cancel the order so I could just get the Focboxes, but they declined. Also I got an email after purchasing for an 8% discount code for letting items sit in my cart- which I didn't get to use. Kinda disappointed

add something to your cart, go to check out, and then don't buy it....they should send you an email saying "you left something in your cart, here's a 10% off coupon code so you buy it" or something like that.

I have the 90mm front wheels and ran them on a Boosted and they are all cracked up after 70-80ish miles.  I did notice they are extremely hard with little to no give.  I compared them to some Popocas and was shocked to find out they actually flexed compared to the R-Spec Ghost Wheels.  I wish I can get some 90mm R-Spec wheels that actually were made in California versus the Chinese stuff.

I though they were like evolve where you can can just rock up to the warehouse. and not be charged Australia Tax (not GST\VAT but crappy US\AUS exchange rates) I always end up buying way too much there.
