they aren't however, to my understanding they have a bigger FOV because you want to see more of the road than on a bike where you have mirror etc, also they are way lighter (source i own one)

Prices aren't showing on the website for some reason, even when I put one in the cart. Anyone experiencing this?

The shipping is free to usa. So all you need is a buddy from usa to reship.

You could get a reliable seller here to do that for you And he could write lower value for customs.

Edit: No idea how long sales last.

Does anyone know where to find a clear visor that fits this helmet? their fullface helmets comes with mirror tinted (yellow) visors I asked sector 9 can I purchase a clear visor. (Bc I mostly ride @ night) they said they no longer sell clear visors manufacturing of them stopped... anyone out there have experience with using an different brand visor with this helmet?

Ask sector9 if this is the same visor as the DH6 because if that‚Äôs the case then you can buy it from predator.

I‚Äôve been using one of these helmets for about a week now. It‚Äôs legit! I‚Äôve got a big ass bobble head and it fits comfortably and it‚Äôs light on the nugget.

[If you look at the side pictures here the predator visors look identical.](http://www.predatorhelmets.com/parts/#) You can unscrew your visor and see that it looks exactly the same.

[This shop is selling them for $13 so I'm going to buy one and test.](http://socalskateshop.com/index.php?l=product_list&c=1303)
