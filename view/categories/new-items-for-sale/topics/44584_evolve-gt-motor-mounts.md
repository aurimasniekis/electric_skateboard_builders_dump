  After months of design and modification with inputs from @b264 and @pixelsilva, here are the Evolve GT motor mounts we came up with: :point_down:

Specs:  
- 8mm thick T6061
- Fits wheels up to 107mm (can be custom to fit larger wheels)
-  Dual idlers with standard size sk8 bearings
- All stainless hardware

Inside, under the deck or rearward, outside facing motor mounts :point_down:

Top: outside facing    
 Bottom:  inside facing
![In_out_4|545x462](upload://5YN22LrudOwwWOVnG21ENxgcdvy.jpg)

Parallel slots to fit either 63xx or 50xx motor and elevate ~20 degree from the ground.
![Out_1|505x434](upload://o1KT8yAyzDNSWD7ClPGXKFKKeJb.jpg)

Universal motor mount with motor protection with the extended lip.  Can also be outfitted with rear rubber bumper (2 threaded holes toward the rear) for additional motor protection.

Can confirm the straight ones fit two real 6374 under the deck (not Turnigy sk3) very nicely.  Awesome mounts

These mounts are designed to fit wheel sizes up to 107mm.  I would need to modify the mount to fit AT kit.  The price for the motor mounts (2) is $150 including US shipping.  Pulleys are sold separately, ranges from $20 to $50 depending on the # of teeth.
-	30-42 teeth…….$20
-	44-58 teeth…….$30
-	60-70 teeth…….$40
-	72-78 teeth…….$50

@marcmt88  - Do you have a dimension drawing of straight mounts showing overall length and dimension of centre of motor to centre of truck  

Looking at AT 175mm wheels with a 66T wheel cog on Evolve GT truck

Thanks

@marcmt88  thanks for that 

the set-up I am looking for has a 108mm wheel cog and a 32mm motor cog on a 5065 motor with minimal overall length

Could you advise if your standard straight mount can accommodate this 

Thanks

My standard straight mount can fit a 108mm wheel diameter running 5065 motors.  It also can handle a true dual 6374 setup.

So the angled mounts will fit two 6374's on the same side, so long as they aren't Turnigy brand???

They will fit dual 6374s.  The Turnigy sk3 "6374" are not 6374s, despite their name, more like 5984 and that's why they won't fit.  There is room for 75.5mm of motor

Hey I would be interested in this kit too.  Can I use the stock motors and wheels?  Just having problems with bending my mounts.
```

## \#25 Posted by: b264 Posted at: 2018-05-31T14:34:02.283Z Reads: 202

The inside-facing mounts would fit the stock motors, but you'll have to drill and tap a new grubscrew hole in the steel gear and drill a grubscrew hole in the motor axle because the pulley will need to move 4mm further out on the shaft.

stock motors = racerstar 5065 150kv self-balancing scooter motor

Unless @marcmt88 can make it thinner in the motor area, I measured and there is 5.92mm between the pulley and motor face, and the pulley can't really be moved on the motor shaft.

```

---
## \#29 Posted by: b264 Posted at: 2018-05-31T19:44:24.330Z Reads: 188

```
49.5mm diameter can
tapers over 10.0mm to 44.0mm diameter where it touches the motor mount
Bolt holes are on 37.0mm diameter centers, 4 bolts 90 degrees apart, M4
Wires are in line with one of the 4 bolts

70.0mm from motor mount face to back of axle/can
6.0mm from motor mount face to pulley (thickness available for mount which should be 5mm thick)

Pulley is 24.0mm diameter and needs to be able to push through motor mount (the pulley is not really removable, at least not easily)  (8mm axle inside)

So the axle hole through the mount needs to be 24.5mm diameter

According to @b264 above, I would need to modify my current Evolve GT mount to fit your motor.  Best if you could send the motor to me.

Hey man your product honestly looks awesome and I would like to support you but having to send out a motor I am using is a bit much.  I just figured that since it's a part for an Evolve board it would work with an Evolve motor.

Hey mmaner, no lack of trust.  Just I use the board as my primary commuting method, and the stock motors cost 150, so this bracket would now cost me 300 dollars.

Would you be able to provide these mounts to fit the GT AT setup with 200mm wheels? The stock mounts do not allow me to tighten the belt enough to prevent slipping.

6"x2" pneumatic tires fit with my Evolve mounts, not sure about 200mm.  Test them out with your setup, if they don't fit return for a refund minus shipping.

Available in 3 flavors:

I'm really digging the limited edition reversible mounts. My only concern would be that it appears that the motor mount points are static, which could limit the distance the motor could be mounted to increase pulley tension, as opposed to the slot points on the outside mount that would allow me to move the motor out to increase pulley tension. Have you found this to be an issue with the stock GT motor and AT gears, or can pulley tension be adjusted enough by moving the pinch bearings in on the pulley?

Belt tension is adjusted thru the bottom slack idler and the tensioning upper idler...yes, in essence by choking down both idlers.  For a complete list of my product line:  Janux-esk8.com
