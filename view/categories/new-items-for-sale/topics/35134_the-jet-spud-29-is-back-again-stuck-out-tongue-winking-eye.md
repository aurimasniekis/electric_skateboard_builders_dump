Over the past few months I have been working with Jet to bring back the Spud, and it has finally happened! I have very limited stock, but I can order more (i hope :smile:). I have even managed to keep the price very comparable to Muir. Please let me know if you have any questions!

https://buildkitboards.com/products/jet-spud-29-bkb
I have created a new topic for this because I figured it was worthy. I try to keep the adv topics to a minimum.

I'd say half a foot angled risers😂😂jk probably not too big since you should be able to have the kingpins quite tight as the board has a small wheel base and should turn easily anyway

I’d say this board is meant for no larger than 90mm wheels. 107’s or pneumatics you will need the angled risers from @Okp which look wicked cool.

That's what I did, I used 8mm-14mm angled risers with my Abec 11 97mm Flywheels, works great, no bite.

It’s a beauty ! I’m going to build a dual 90 mm 75 kv hubs with focbox and 10S3P for commuting around paris. So i can preserve my carvon V3 from daily commmute and not use them too much. 
I am unfortunately not using any of my belt drive system since I went with carvon direct drive and hubs in general...

Those are actually MBS ATS 10mm skate trucks off an Atom 95 mountain board. I'll have to measure the width when I get home later, but I think they're around 15" axle to axle. They're almost comically too wide, but I like to experiment. Plan is to grind some flat spots on the hanger so a 2 piece caliber clamp/mount will fit. Worked once for me, should work again.

I've only mounted up the trucks so far, but they seem like they should turn well enough. I have some angled risers if needed, but I think because of the shorter wheelbase, they won't need to be mounted at such a high angle like they do on MTB decks. I also test fitted the six shooters and the only clearance issues seem to be with my toes. Lol

Just in case you didn't know, it's a 30 or 35 degree difference not sure which, from a 50 degree baseplate. Assuming you can still turn well...some say yeah, some no, I have no idea...I think 1/4 to 1/2in risers for some clearance and big old fat numies would make for a hell of a board.  Maybe even some dirt action.

thanks for the heads up. Mine are a bit different. The shape is slightly different and the board is hand shaped/pressed in France in a little atelier. No industrial production, just few units hand made. My boards are using also glass fiber for more strength. I did this because I ride them quite hard :) 

Cheers!

I was a little PO'ed at the dude but what can you do?
[/quote]

I still don’t understand why your mad.. Sure, the shipment was delayed, but only a week. This is not Amazon. I do this all by myself one the side of regular life. If your upset with the communication I’m sorry, but I sprained my wrist the other day so stuff is slower. 

Also you commented about the taxes.. you ordered it on November 20th, paid $4.42 in tax and didn’t say a peep. Now that someone else brings up the point you get mad and say I’m braking the law? 

I don’t do this to deal with this kind of stuff. Especially when you post my personal information on the forum. Yes it may be public knowledge, but you don’t have to post it here. That really pissed me off. Thank you for deleting it. 

You also asked why I commented on someone else’s sale post (and you were the ONLY person to flag it a week later). In this case the customer asked if it could be shipped over seas, the seller said no. I can ship the decks over seas, so I left a comment. What’s wrong with that?

Dude! Are you a financial advisor or Uncle Sam? I guess it’s illegal to CALL it tax if he pockets that extra $4. But why do you care so god damn much? Were you audited by IRS and hate everyone that’s getting away with these things. 

Patience is something that is needed in this hobby. Sellers/Vendors here are mostly small businesses that actually need the customers’ money to start manufacturing parts due to MOQ.

Have you guys considered the Deadhead from Tahoe? I love this deck and have two of them, I'm turning the second one into a eskate, the 1st one has 215 indys on wedges and I can still ride a pool with it and bomb hills, add some kicks to the spud and it would be an overkill, lol hahahah..I have a Jet superslider and love it too, great company, but I'm a believer in skateboards having kicktails..even electrics.. http://www.tahoeboardcompany.com/product/pint-tahoe-dead-head-copy/

I bought a Jet Spud 29".... my reason is to have a small portable deck to fit in my backpack or take on the plane. The very essence of Jet Spud 29" is that 29" x 9.5" board that has the width to be comfortable and not a kiddy board.

thats a good looking board.  Tthe size makes it not as attractive as the Spud 29 though, the Deadhead is 35in, @gogomrrobot is right, the thing that makes the Spud such a great board for electrics is the portability that a 29x9.5 deck with a massive wheelbase gets you.

Yeppers.. I just hope I can make mine look almost identically like metro-board 29" (they are using the Jet Spud 29" deck from the same company):

i even printed out truck risers that let you stick LED lights in them. I kept staring at this bugger for a month straight... but I just want to rebuild it instead with better parts and my own touch :)

@Maxid  Hum... tough question... it’s very subjective at this point. 
But if you really wan’t my opinion i feel that unik’s one is the best for commuting tru cars and commuting in the city because the concave locks the feets so well to the board. 
On the other hand the jet spud is a bit more refined in term of design and is outrageously georgous but the concave is not as good.

@JLabs will do !

@stormboard1 @ron @ElskerShadow @Maxid @Latemate 

Any interest in getting the Group Buy together? If so I’d like to get these shipped before my surgery on Tuesday

For anybody in the EU seeing this and is not tagged; if your interested in the 29” Jet Spud let me know. We are trying to reach a count of 7 Boards to ship all at once to the EU to reduce the cost

I can do $85/pc shipped for 7 boards to the UK. DHL is the cheapest option and will take 4 days. I suppose shipping will be less than 10€ As I can ship them for less than $12in the USA. I will of course help you guys out with the customs value. The Group Buy should save you a total of about $35usd

I put it in the cart and calculated the shipping cost and everything without any problem but at the end I bought the potato 33 from sickboard because it was cheaper there. You can ask them or buy from US. I just wanted to share it because it is more expensive but faster to get and for 3-4 boards maybe easier for everyone. I still thing I should have bought the 29 version (I like short board). I got the 33 yesterday and I thought it was shorter than it actually is. I was not sure for the stability at high speed with the spud.

I would say the the shape is the almost the same. The difference is in the length. Indeed now the spud is called potato 29", no spud anymore. I come from a 35/36" board and I found quite bulky for my daily use. It didn't fit inside most of the closets, when you move it around is too big to put it underneath a table ecc... So I tought to go with the potato 33" but when I have seen it I realized that it is almost the same and even broader than my previous one, so the total volume was almost the same. The logic next step was the spud. I love the Jet boards, so my final decision was between spud, banger 32 and potato 33. Actually I like the BC barracuda 29" too.
Concerning the kick tail they a have a would say a micro kick tail. When you lean backwards you pop the front so enough for me. I just need it for sharp turns, I don't plan any ollies :grinning:

it's not so much a kicktail as is is the fact that the wheels are centered under the truck, so the point of contact is about an inch in from the end of the board. The trucks really do mount at the very end.

Love this deck. Since you sell them you probably k own IT. I was wondering whether do you usually install the rear truck in the shorter wheels base option or the longer one. Because when if I try to use the wider wheels base the rear truck are not flat on the deck due to the small lock tail. Do you usually use an angle raiser or something like that in this case? Thxs!

For those interested in the enclosure:

I am told it will take about 3 weeks in order for them to be delivered to me here in the USA. Because of this, i think it only make sense to wait about another week and get batteries to go along as well. They will be 11s3p 30Q's with a BesTech D140 BMS (bypassed for charge only). 

https://buildkitboards.com/products/spud-enclosure-11s3p-battery

Im hoping we can get this moving asap because i want to get everything ordered in order to ensure a timely delivery.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Here’s the Specs one would get with 11S3P 30Q , 190KV 30:15 running 83mm Wheels: 

![image|281x500](upload://tmteVDdga8SNn4T2Aw4L9EN85UJ.png)

Calculated the Generic Spud build to $920 with Vanda Dual VESC’s and a commissioned Firefly remote , no Drive Train, and even a freaking plug and pay Eskating.eu antispark if you’re as lazy as I am.

Hell you could cut the price down going single drive taking out the cost of a motor and VESC taking It down to about what? $720 with no drivetrain ? 

Shit if I could I would use this as an opportunity to get an Arc Gear Drive and truly test out that efficiency...

@longhairedboy, will you also be servicing The Arc Fusion Drives for Arcboards Warranty, I have a feeling I’m prone to eventually break them and would like to know that your trusty hands will also ensure their repair as well if possible.

It would be very very expensive as the battery would have to be shipped individually from the manufacturer and then a separate shipment would be needed for the enclosure and deck. Your talking an extra $150 in shipping. Granted the number dosnt go up much if you add one or two more.

Hey JLabs,

Thanks again for organizing the GB. My TSG order also contained a Jet Spud. I am really considering ordering the combo Eboosted enclosure & battery from you but I was hoping for some of your insight into a build.

I currently have an Acton Blink S2 w/ 2k miles, 18 mph is too slow for my next board but I love the concept of using hubs/DD (carvon v4Rs are now $799 :frowning:)

I dont really know how the 11s3p battery would work w/ Hubs and if you had recommendations for buying a combo of Dual VESC & Hubs & a matching front truck? Would @Hummie Hubs work on that battery config? 

This would be my first DIY project so I am slightly intimidated,

Thanks for your wisdom

Don’t do It man , don’t jump into that hole.


Hummies hubs would work but they aren’t ready for release just yet. You’re immediate options in terms of hubs are Maytechs, Tourquebaord (if they’re in stock), and DIYEBoard. In terms of performance and reliability , Belt Drives right now are reliable , in which you could cop some BKB Motors and Motor Mounts


From my configuration up above , 11s is Ganna give you a good 18 mike range (not sure of the voltage sag though). 

Speed is dependent on gearing , KV , and other factors. 


* Keep in mind I am a lazy sonofabitch and the info I have here could be incorrect.

Waiting for hummies (best option form me) you could think about the diyeboard. I recently did a spud build with them. You can see the thread about it. Depends what you are looking but to me in the cost effective range they are a good choice. Tourque is great, top speed 40km/h with 10s. I use it for commuting and I love it!

Yea, but takes out the hard part as well, the hardest thing would probably be hooking up a LCD screen in between the switch and VESC (right? I may be confused), everything is accounted for , right now looking at a minimum $960 build. 

@JLabs in the coming months you could possibly offer a prebuild Electric Jetboard, the only thing stopping you would be reliable antispark switch, hopefully lunacycles are good enough for 11s3p

Vicious, the nicest grip tape, the one that looks cleaner longer, the one that locks your feet in place after a huge bump, but also the one that will tear your shoes appart and probably also your socks :socks:

I will be releasing the kicktail version of the Spud tomorrow 9.14.2018

Not sure what to call it tho as it needs to be separate from the Spud name to avoid confusion. I was thinking the BKB Ion or BKB Swerve 31. I am still open to suggestions :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Yeah, it seems that is the curvature of the deck that is touching the center of the battery. I haven't velcro'd it down yet either, which may add another 1-2mm. I may try to sand down the bottom of the deck just a hair to flatten it where it makes contact w/ the battery. I'm fairly lightweight so I'm not too worried about flex

The measurement is with velcro so about 21-22mm tall.

How thick neoprene were you using? I'm thinking of looking at other soundproof foam since neoprene is flammable. I'm also thinking of getting that P-stylle Gasket! It's perfect.

![image|375x500](upload://r4Poez3IesNawngcjCUM3ta6MSK.jpg)
This is the stuff I ended up using, its a few mm thicker and it seals up nicely. You can get it for like $3 at Home Depot, or I can send you some from the roll I have. You can probably even get a little bit thicker one as well.

Not yet I’ve called three times and sent emails.. I’d switch manufacturers if they didn’t own the deck mold. 

They eventually send them but I don’t have a firm date yet. I only got an email a few weeks ago about them being delayed, nothing since then unfortunately
