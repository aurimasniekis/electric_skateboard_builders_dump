10s charger and 12s charger available

10s 5amp $35  5.5mm x 2.5mm barrel   1lb
10s 8amp $55  5.5mm x 2.1mm barrel   2lb
12s 8amp $60  5.5mm x 2.1mm barrel   2.5lb (aluminum/silver color only)
buy more than one and I can save u a few bucks, no bulk rate tho sorry

plus shipping, local pickup in nyc. If youre feeling ambitious on calc. shipping charge it comes from 06854 (can possibly save u a couple bucks on the heavier units)

Ride hard, charge fast! Only a few available so first come first serve... If you have a 2.5mm charge port i have some converter plugs I can include. 

Testing during charging showed it was within advertised tolerance. 

For 8amp - If you have any concerns about your charging wiring I can provide a 3.5mm bullet connectors... You however will have to solder them on.

As a side note 20ga wire is rated at 12amps, and 22awg at 8amps (roughly) so most builds built properly should be sufficient.
 A red JST is rated at 5amps so charging at 8amps is recommended to upgrade to either bullet connectors, xt30 (minimum) or a deans... what ever fits your fancy.

If u wanna pay shipping then sure... Youd also need a plug converter or you can cut the wires on your own and resolder... Yur choice... Lemme know if interested... Ships from 06854 if you want to price it

2 chargers left.. whos else wants a 4p full charge in an hour??  its actually quite awesome...

Is it safe to use on a 4p? I purchased it for my 12s8p but if I can use it on my 4p that would be great lol

Also what balance wire thickness do you recommend? Right now I have 22gauge rolls but have not finished the battery in case I need something thicker.

## \#14 Posted by: accrobrandon Posted at: 2018-10-23T15:57:54.738Z Reads: 234

yeah cells can handle 4amps each.. so a 4p would be good up to 16amp or 32 for you 8p... i saw a 15amp charger the other day... its like a fucking mini computer tower lol...

22 is the minimum at 8amps... 20 would be fine as that s rate for 12amps.... the only thing i changed was my jst connector as theyre supposedly rated at 5amps... so 3.5mm bullets.... xt30 or larger.... deans connect.... any of those are more than enough IMO

if you dont have anything bigger than the 22ga on hand you could just use two pieces side by side as well....
```

Hmm if 22 can handle it I'll use it. But I'd rather buy a thicker wire than use 2 wires in paralelle cause the jst connector would be a bitch lol

Been using my 8a 12s charger since I got it and it's been excellent, most of my other 4a 12s and 10s chargers develope a problem by now like fans not working or LED's dieing out but this one is still mint.

Charges my 12s8p in about 3.5 hours. 

I give an it an A+

Get this charger if you got a big battery it's awesome.

sorry i need to edit that out... it doesnt go from 2.1 ---> 2.5 but the other way around...more like a reducer...but most boards have 2.1mm, meepo and wowgo tend to have a 2.5mm... but they can be found on amazon fairly cheap.. or i might have a couple 2.1mm charge ports left I can toss in the box.

...unless you only use 8A sometimes.  Those times when you really need it recharged ASAP :stuck_out_tongue:

An 8A charge is still less than 1C for 3P and higher packs.... so it's really not that much.  Unless you're charging a 1P or maybe 2P pack at 8A

I guess I just don't understand then. I was under the impression that an 8 amp charger would always have difficulty balancing due to the high current. The pack I'm trying to charge is 7p 30q

Wouldn't a low amp charger be better? Like 5 or 2 amps?
```

## \#43 Posted by: b264 Posted at: 2019-03-17T15:31:04.321Z Reads: 83

It would be better to use more often the lower one, yes.  However using an 8A charger even half of the time with a 7P pack won't hurt anything.  It also matters what the balance charge current on your BMS is.  A 150mA balance current can do a lot more than a 24mA balance current, for example.

What 5.5x2.1mm female power connector are you using to charge at 8A? I think most will melt with 50.4V @ 8A and I'm having a hard time finding something rated for it.

Im looking for a 10s, 8amp charger. Ive got 4, 36v packs in parralel(each with its own bms) and the charger ive got stops at 40v and never reads over 93% charged. I have charged them beyond this with a 36v lead acid charger as an experiment and it worked 100%. So would this charger get them up too 100%? I feel im loosing capacity because of this and hate reading 93% when fully charged.
