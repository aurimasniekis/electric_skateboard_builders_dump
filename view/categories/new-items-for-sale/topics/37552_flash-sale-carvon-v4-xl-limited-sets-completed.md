If you bought V4 SD and want the XL 

https://carvonskates.com/products/carvon-v4-speeddrive-upgrade-to-xl



This is a longer version of the original SpeedDrive. These motors have more torque and can be used with 107mm ABEC 11 SuperFly wheels. Does not come with front truck or wheels. Ships Jan 2018.

 

Features and Tech Specs:

 Dual 85kv sensored motors, 2750W each
Custom-made precision CNC hanger and motor mounts
Motor mounts are screwed on for absolute no stator movement
Stepped-down axle (from 12mm to 10mm) is removable and replaceable
Motors can be easily removed and inside bearings replaced
Low-carbon flux steel tubes for more power and protection
Axle end-to-end is 12 inches (305mm)
 

Recommended Use:

Optimal rider weight is 225 lbs (102 kg) or less for 2WD builds, 295 lbs (134kg) or less for 4WD builds. 
Can be used with 107mm ABEC 11 SuperFly or 107mm Evolve wheels.
Use 97mm wheels for street riding, 90mm (minimum size) for track or smooth and clean roads. Smaller wheels are better for hill climbing.
MBS All-Terrain 100mm longboard wheels can be used, but do not ride off-road or on grass.
Best used with a drop-down deck and with an enclosure to make sure the motors are shielded from most road hazards.
Use a 12s (preferred Samsung 30Q) battery pack with minimum 3p for 2WD, and minimum of 5p for 4WD. 
Use only Vedder's ESCs. Sensored BLDC mode has higher top speed, sensored FOC mode is near-silent.
Do not misuse, abuse, overuse or neglect. Do not do tricks. Do not ride on rain or soaked streets.
Rider must be at least 16 years old and responsible. Always wear a helmet and safety gears.
Obey traffic, local and community rules. Be respectful to pedestrians.

The 85kv will be to your liking at 12s and with the speed to boot...obviously not as fast as the V4 xl but will definitely get you the torque that you may be missing. I‚Äôd equate the torque at 10s on the V4 SD XL the similar to a V4 SD at 12s

It fits the top speed I want for that build and the 13P helps with the current load on the cells. 5A/cell = 65A continuously with a burst up to 130A with a 2v sag on 30V. 

I usually over spec my builds and limit them in software so I know that any faults won't damage any hardware before the fuse goes.

With 12S you would have 1/3 less amps in the battery circle to achieve the same power. So also less heat on the wires (your copper bars don't care) and i guess also less stress for the vesc. (Which will be fine anyway).
And top speed could be limited in the software. (which you can't in this configuration)

Now that I've committed, I'm guessing 4wd V4SDXL with carvon branded blue superfly 107s for cheaper than the parts, 5 pieces only.

BTW are these XL a response to raptor 2 ghost hubs?

Yes and no,
Yes, the 12S requires less current at the same power condition, and it would be less taxing on electronics, but I would also require a much lower kv motor for what the board is intended or gearing. I am running a direct drive, so gearing isn't possible. Running a lower kV would increase the internal resistance of the motors, and therefore generate more heat and decrease efficiency at the conditions which I want to run at. 

This is for a free riding board and carving uphill. Not really for speed. The setup I'm going with has 125kV motors and 107mm wheels, top speed of about 30mph with the batteries dead which is what I will limit it at.

Although the entire build might have to be re-thought out since I bought the Carvon lol

And yeah the ones you linked have OD 19mm. Normal skate bearings (608) have OD 22mm.

I feel like I must be doing my math wrong, but these on 97mm wheels have a max theoretical speed of around 47mph so realistically at least 30. But then if my math is correct, the normal speed drives have a theoretical max of around 60mph on 97mm wheels, yet only get 38mph. Something seems off....

http://toddy616.blogspot.com/2013/07/electric-skateboard-calculator.html

I put in:
10s
85kv
70% efficiency (as recommended)
1 motor teeth (1:1 ratio)
1 wheel teeth (1:1 ratio)

results:
Top Speed	
35.73 mph / 57.50 kph
Weighted Top Speed	
25.01 mph / 40.25 kph

This lines up with my experience with v2.5 top speed about 31mph for me.

EDIT for 12s, that page gives:

Top Speed	42.88 mph / 69.00 kph
Weighted Top Speed	30.01 mph / 48.30 kph

Still not 47mph theoretical top speed.

EDIT again, adjusting to 85% efficiency for 10s gives me just about 30mph, which matches my real world numbers. 12s pushes that to 36mph.

## \#60 Posted by: PXSS Posted at: 2017-11-07T03:40:33.400Z Reads: 142

```
Torque constant is 1/kv. It is very possible that the torque/rpm condition falls out of the design rpm/torque range. A 4wd would be able to get closer to the theoretical limit because the rpm/torque condition per motor is closer to the design point. 

If the theoretical limit and rw limits are that far off then the system could have been designed wrong. The XL would be a move in the right direction but I haven't tested either system and am unaware of what speeds are actually achieved as I just jumped in the Carvon train without much research lol

it's funny carvon is pulling motors out like crazy right now. 4wd of these would probably do some serious damage. 

But every things about mechanical design these days in hubs, and the options are endless, unlike belt drives.

How these motors hold up has yet to be seen. The reason I invested in hub motors was because I was feed up with my carvon v2s. Too many issues, including bending axles. I'm sure a lot of issues are solved by these new trucks, and it looks like a cool design. But just remember, all of these motors are experimental. It'll take at least 6 months to really know for sure how any of these designs we're all coming up with (including our hub motors) will work out. I hope all goes well, interesting designs. Personally, I like in wheel better than out of wheel hubs ;)

@b264 This is why I love working on hub motors. Cause this is just a physics problem. We can find the right materials to get the best traction for high end torque boards :) Obviously, at some point, too much is too much, but I think we are a ways away from being as powerful as they could be before having serious wheel slipping issues, if the right wheels are used.

That's the thing with direct drive though, you can change wheels and motors independently.  That's one huge, massive reason why I shun hub motors in favour of belt and direct.  Also I don't want to be vendorlocked to certain wheel wrappers...

Too many issues, including bending axles. I'm sure a lot of issues are solved by these new trucks, and it looks like a cool design.
[/quote]

Def agree with you on your bending axel issue. I did see it with my own eyes. But the V4 are designed differently than the v2 version which was an sk motor on a Funbox truck.  These aren‚Äôt fun box trucks, jerry had to have these custom made. No more bending issues....ain‚Äôt that right @BigBoyToys?

And I would be too in SF with motors rated at 149kv. I think the v2 were the wrong choice in your application. At 149kv and the SF hills, that‚Äôs a bad combo. I think the V4 Speed Drive XL would be more suitable for SF.

None so far, I bent V2's really quick. I have double the miles on my V3's already too. I like that he's keeping the axle  12mm through the motor and then 10mm through the wheel on the XL version. I think that should be more than sufficient for the extra inch.

See @evoheyax here‚Äôs some validation for you. And of course would sour a person on any further products coming out. 

But I would ask you to put aside your prejudices, and take a look at the design changes from the v2 and v2.5 to the V4. Its not the same. It‚Äôs better.

I agree that the designs are better in the v3. Haven't seen the raw designs of the v4 though. Any references?

I think everyone is serious about their designs right now. All I was tryin to say is things happen and no one is certain of anything until they've all been ridden, and this goes for all of the direct drive motors out there. I hope for the best.

I know Michael that you've been pushing carvon lately. I'm glad to see you put your skills to work for someone like carvon. Your a talented individual with great people skills. 

I guess though, I'll see these motors this Saturday, right?

@evoheyax it's not only about the vendor but also about the DURO and COLOR SCHEMES that are availbable.

Current options are: 
- **CLONES** - red,blue,black and so on, various options here
- **ABEC 11** - 90mm , 97mm, 107mm original green ones
- **METROBOARD ABEC 11** - 97mm - CLEAR RED with 75A and 97mm BLACK with 77a
- **EVOLVE ABEC 11** - 107mm ABEC 11 75A BLACK ones
- **MBS 100mm** - GREEN . BLUE . BLACK

The choice is pretty rad.

Is the Carvon V4 or V4 XL just overkill for a 29" board?  I want to build a cute 29" build that can turn on a dime and is good to carry around. This coming from a guy who has only (2) Trampa boards an E-MTB monster and a carver.

It says 12S battery which will be difficult to fit under 29". Maybe 2 x 6S lipos? What do you guys think?
