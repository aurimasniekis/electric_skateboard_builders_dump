**No payments are handled through friends and family!**

If there is a specific print you need just supply the STL file and i can have it printed for you, If you also require other parts for example screws or electronics or would like something built for you i can also provide that service.

I wooould like to see a strength test, perhaps one shall meet the hammer gods?

Or a drop test ðŸ¤”with simated internals with a weight or something... I wouldnt ask you to risk the whole remote ðŸ˜­

stated by the supplier themselves. you can look it up on 3D fillies they are based in Australia/Melbourne.

Here is a link for you.

E: woops I stand corrected I didn't scroll far enough into the page

I still thought it was strong enough anyways.... Would I buy one if I didn't? ðŸ˜‹

I appreciate the link. They reference their testing well. Be careful in the way they word their testing methods. I print a LOT of PLA and PLA+ from a variety of sellers and notice almost no difference in strength, finish, color, etc. Do you print any other materials?

mostly PLA+ as its been strong enough for what i use it for i have a roll of ABS but its tricky to print with when you dont have an enclosure for the printer itself, the layers start to warp the further off the bed you go. this leads to unreliable results. I have been looking at building an enclosure for it but the issue is where i can put it since its a CR10S modded an enclosure would help me print abs though i havent tested it again after the upgrades i have done which i may do again shortly to see if its possible to print ABS without an enclosure without it warping.

I Agree with what your saying, it could be how they test the filament and shouldn't be said in stone. i have tested the PLA that came with my printer compared to the PLA+ i got from 3D Fillies and i noticed a significant difference in strength and print quality alone.

Great to hear, I'm going to have to buy a roll and try it out! You should check out this [PLA with carbon fibre](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GXCYH1Q/?coliid=I927R1UG3DS2O&colid=241JZBUGCKEM8&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) embedded. It prints wickedly smooth. Hopefully you can get it or something similar to try out sometime.

A collaboration to thicken the remote to hopefully provide a more durable and better weighted(I dont want my remote to feel as light as a feather!) has been started :) 

(as an available option, I cant speak for him, I just know what im getting o3o) 

Progress!

Since i have not tested the prints in ABS since i have done the mods, ill be doing a test print in ABS and if all goes well since im able to keep the bed temp at a stable 90c i might be able to get ABS prints instead of PLA+ which are much more stronger and heat resistant.


ABS is a no go with my current setup however i will be doing some tests with PETG which is stronger than ABS. i will see how these results go for those who want a stronger print. if both end in a failure. i wil be looking at adding an enclosure and re attempting both abs and PETG prints.

@venom121212 sorry for the late reply i only just noticed this message now. 

the problem with carbon fibre is its conductive, and i dont feel comfortable with it around electronics. its very easy to short something, and defiantly dont want that happening to your remote.

Once I started using petg I never bought a roll of pla again. It will warp if you don't have an enclosure, but not as bad as abs and nylon.

I print so mucb stuff I got tired of using sticky stuff and having to clean everything off constantly. The printbite I mentioned is a $12 piece of idk what material, that's sticky on one side. You lay it on your existing bed. It holds everything down without lifting (no joke) and once the bed cools the part pops off so easy its laughable and oddly satisfying. It leaves a mirror like surface on your prints too. The only thing i didnt like was it took like 2 and a half months to get it after i ordered.
