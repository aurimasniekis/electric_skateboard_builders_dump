I am selling custom built decks( you pick the ply and what material and even the shape. although the truck angles, board curve and length are not optional each board is approximately $140 Canadian but the price may vary due to number of plys ![15488728809762123196756|690x388](upload://11Y9RiZdeq7jPTarpaitcAkvI0L.jpeg) (upload://huYwDSN4cU7ta8XITeAeW9GUDrK.jpeg) ![15488719863531805871383|690x388](upload://llanvAmZ0DWYBcJeJFpZQGFGk2J.jpeg) ![1548872096915174883567|281x500](upload://xRTB2gl7TfTE9gNxapbm3UVYtL0.jpeg)![15488731628981129933393|281x500](upload://jvrXDjTDKwzVPyQmAazTww8Flqg.jpeg)

That’s so cool, does it have any concave? Sorry can’t really see on the pictures.

Edit. Or maybe this kind of shape is not suitable for concave?

No, sorry. I may be able to customize my press in order to get a small amount of concave.

Nice one. Try to sell a custom enclosure with it. It'll be more profitable

That would be a good idea. Do you just use a vacuum mold?

So what are all of these?

Sorry I can see why that doesn't make sense. what i mean by truck angles is the 35degree angle that each end of the deck is on the length is just the overall length of the deck and the board curve is the rise in the centre of the board.

Yeah. Although I have left all the equipment at my school. I wont have pictures until friday but this is how they are made. I cnc’d a press. then I steam the ply’s and glue them while they are still playable. I then put all the over cut pieces in the press and clamp it down. once it is dry I cut out the shape.

Questions..... interested though.

1. What kind of wood are you using and what other material options do you have to use?
2. Can you make it any wider? Say 10 inches?
3. Would only really be interested if you can add some concave, you said this might be possible? How possible is it?
4. What is the actual EFP? 

Thanks!

I am using Baltic birch until I can find maple thin enough yes the width can go up to 11 inches and in order for me to add concave I will need to make another mold. This may task a week or so as I still have school. Sorry don't know what efp  means.

ok cool, that all sounds really good. EFP is effective foot platform. Length from the bottom of the drops

All deck orders are on hold until I am sure my decks are correct. I would like to do more testing on them before I sell them. If somenthing breaks or goes wrong I want it to happen to me so I can fix it and not you guys.

How much flex do you expect the decks to have?
Any idea what ply count of the trampa decks would be a good comparison?

here's a hint on what you can layer into that mold that won't fracture:

built like a longbow; carbon, ash, epoxy glass, bamboo veneer.

good luck on your quest

Sorry I have sort of forgot about this thread after I finished my build. The deck is holding up just fine and I don't see it breaking anytime soon. I have not done any work on adding a concave shape and am probally gonna keep it flat. I am kinda running thin on time to make these as I'm working almost full time to save for college as I'm leaving home in September. I will try to make a few before I leave and ship them out.

OK I know that its been a while since I last posted on this thread but it was for a reason. I wanted to thoroughly test the deck for durability. So about 1 year later everything is still good. I haven't noticed any wear on the deck. it was tested with a 10s 10p 18650 30q battery dual 6374 motors with chain drive. I also drilled 1 inch holes in the middle of my deck but that didn't seem to affect the durability. I will start making these decks around the end of April so if people are still interested let me know. The decks will come as wood with urethane on it in order to protect the wood. I am willing to paint them for an extra $30 That probably sounds expensive but they will be painted with hardened paint similar to whats on a car.
