Gonna be honest, this isn't exactly what I need, so I'm going to pass, but thanks @scepterr !I'm running with this style and I wasn't quite sure yet on how I was going to do it until I saw these pics. Super clean and someone is lucky for $30!

One tip I can provide, I originally got 2x 3mm risers, cut one and epoxied to the other. For the new one I just got a 6mm one, which is 2x 3mm already bonded, so one less step ðŸ˜‰

I've got enough supplies on-hand to make a couple more dual, even more for single. If anybody wants one slightly modified I can do it, $30 dual, $25 single. Can do 4,5,5.5mm bullets, and sensor wire extensions if you need them for a bit extra.
