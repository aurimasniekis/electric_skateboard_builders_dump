Hello, I wanna sell my today finished Samsung 10s3p 30Q battery pack. 
I placed the Bms on the top, so the battery is very small. 
Bms is included. 
I also used fishpaper on the positive terminal of each cell and between all parallel packs. 
I didn't soldered a charge port onto it, but the two small wires are there to connect one üòâ
So if someone of you guys is interested, please send me a message. 
‚úîÔ∏èPrice: 250‚Ç¨ (without shipping)

But on another note, those balance leads crossing like that can be dangerous with time ( they wear through and eventually short)

Who is this other builder who said those balance wires don‚Äôt matter?

You forgot fishpaper on the under the balance lead nickel, kapton tape isn't very abrasive resistant.

Ahhh, sry dude. Now i know what you're guys talking aboutüòÖ
For sure i took fishpaper under it!
I only posted a picture that I took before placing all the fishpaper on the right places.
There is also a double layer of fishpaper under the Bms!! ‚úîÔ∏è![IMG_20190712_191701|375x500](upload://cz1nowZW5ZW23oaOIh1OdwB9M0t.jpeg) ![IMG_20190712_191650|375x500](upload://lI9mjil477JP05hOHny69euQ2nj.jpeg)

You're correct, that is proper, but you have advertised as charge only. That wiring is discharging through the BMS. 

Not meaning to ruin your post, but you should be listing accurately.

@a13xr3 nice catch! But yes, if you want to bypass bms for charge only, main wires to vesc should go directly from battery + and -.

B- is connected to battery -. Only wires that go out of bms are wires for charging port.

I think a lot of people is thrown off by the balance wires and that the BMS is wired for discharge use. Think you will sell this easier by fixing those things.

You better be 1000% safe than sorry when selling stuff to people. Especially because people WILL contact you if their board blows up.

like many people said. the bms is wires for discharge and charge. Seems like the BMS can only handle 18A which means it's a big bottleneck for the pack.

They are still crossing so no.

Tape them down with kapton tape and make sure you put fish paper in the middle of the cells where there balances wires are.

Wherever the balance wires are crossing each other, put kapton tape between.

You have to imagine that the wires are not isolated. You have to put them so they‚Äôll not short.

Its much better but you still have to fix a few spots.

On the yellow spots you will have to add fishpaper. That's what I meant by in the middle.

On the green spot you will have to add more fishpaper under the nickel to make sure it's as little as possible in contact with the cell heat shrink. That's to prevent the nickel strip from shorting the cell. Do that on every place you have connected the balance wires.
