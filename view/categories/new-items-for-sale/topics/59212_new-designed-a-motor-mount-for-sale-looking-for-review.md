Hi. every one.  I designed a motor mount, and already productioned for a while.
this one can work with 50 or 63 motors, both adjustable.
and can work with or without paddles.

I use F608 bearing to hold the belt within the bearings....

@dickyho, I'm using the 63mm stainless steel motor mount from DIYeboard, and what I like about it was how thin it was. Right now there is about 2mm gap between the 6354 motors with 13-14mm for belts in my dual setup. Do you think this will work as straight replacement? Or do I need to get a longer truck?

I have this mount too.  if you are using 36T 12mm wheel pulleys, and 7 inch trucks, very possible it will work for my new mount.  but you need to turn you truck to fit .

better way is buy 1pc of my 8 inch truck, then save a lot effort.

You might want to put a clamp relief cut right

![image|503x241](upload://rLDqsJktjIq1NPBOnPDbxBs5h3z.jpg)

here.  It would more evenly distribute the clamping forces around the truck and might eliminate the necessity for the set screws (not sure, depends on dia and shape of target trucks)

Nice mount but i have some questions:
You said the minimum center distance is 75mm, is that for 63mm or 50mm motors, guessing it is the same for both? What is the distance you can adjust the motors by sliding then across the mounting holes for 63mm and 50mm?
Are the F608 bearings 22mm outer diameter?
Is the 285mm belt in the ebay description the lenght needed with using the bearings or without?
Also i could review the mount since i have paris clone trucks.

Same center distance for 50 and 63 motors.
both can adjust 5mm
yes, the F608 bearings is 22mm outer diameter.
285 belt can use both with or without bearings, that's why recomended.

Has anyone tried these with 195mm Paris trucks? Wondering if you could fit two of the wider varieties of 6355 motors.

If you make a caliber II mount at that price I will buy two. If you could offer the whole drivetrain system with pulleys and belts you'd sell quite a bit.

Excellent! Now the question becomes how much room is there for motors with the 195mm trucks? I think this could be a great alternative to people who don't have space for larger motors and don't want to use giant TB 218's.

I personally don't like this one.
1. a two side open  clam will more easy to got loose.
2. connected another metal plate (or cabon) by 3  screws, also increased the chance of getting loose.
3.  the product thick will increased.

Just my opinion, I am not sure, never use this mount myself.

I have some idea of the adjustable version now, but still don't have one that satisfy me. in the end very possibly I will produce the fixed angle one.  1 version for caliper 50, 1 for caliper 44.  this will be more cheap, better suit for net shop sale.

It looks like the plate is thicker that the clamp where they mate, could be liable to break there, I would leave it thicker even if the motor plate sticks out a bit

Trying to think how you can acoud having to make a left and right side version but maybe no option, I know this increases cost

My opinion is: make it simple. Means don't bother with nice curvy & intricate shape. The less material you mill, cheaper it is. Make it non adjustable, less tinkering and much more reliable; less moving parts, less influence of vibration. Simpler it is, stronger it gets and easier to properly align with pulleys. Simpler can be stealthier. Browse effective designs and make something similar. Probably make 2 versions 63xx and 50xx. With and without idlers.
Just my 2 cents

I think this is the best option, as it is completely universal, all that would be needed it to slightly enlarge the clamping hole so objects like in the picture can be fitted.

You can also first make a caliber 2 compatible motormount that is not adjustable just so everyone can try it.

You will need to find a good angle so it can hold a 63mm motor on a good distance between the deck and the ground when it is attached to a caliber 2 truck. 

Because then everyone can buy some and try it while you can maybe develop a better adjustable mount

Hey guys, just received my version 1 mounts. As you can see above, the idler adjustment is on the **same side**, which results in a lopsided look when you mount in dual configuration... In other words no right/left versions. Looks pretty bad imo, and prevents from running a sigular idler. Just thought I should throw it out there!

I know you want to get rid of your current stock, but there are a ton of people here who would get your newly designed ones right away and you would likely see a large amount of those very quickly...  Just something to consider in how long you decide to wait before offering these new ones.  And I don't think many would be upset if you charged a little bit more, these are such a great price already.

Have you considered selling your mounts as complete sets with the motor and wheel pulleys and belt as well? (also the cover, once you develop one :smile:)

Also it says the wheel pulley is for abec flywheels.  I have a set of boas which have a kegel style core.  Will your pulleys work on these wheels?

There is only a 'mount for caliber trucks' option, but it doesn't say anything about bearings.  It is $16.50 though, so would this be with the bearings and everything?

I made the bearing set along on my product list.

That's not bad at all!  Definitely worth the wait.  Would it be possible to request a set either not be anodized as the blue doesn't match my color scheme on my board, or if it has to be anodized, could it be done in black?

It makes one side higher than the other which makes it difficult for clearance when mounting underneath. Also when when mounting them in reverse they don't allow much angle before the motors come into contact with the Paris baseplate. 

It's obvious these weren't made for Paris Trucks but rather the clones which have a much smaller baseplate.

after putting the paris mount on. I realized with the idlers, it really require a very wide wheel pulley to align everything right. Definitely need those 17mm width recommended in the description. 

I'm using a 12mm enertion pulleys, which makes me need to put spacers to push the idlers out  and it's so tight I can't fully tension the belts cus the screw head is almost touching the wheel. I'm testing with 15mm belt cus thats all I have right now.  i'll post pictures later.

if use  the F608 bearings, need 17mm pulley.    but if don't have enough spece, you could use it without the metal plate.   or use the 14mm thick 608 bearings on below picture.

acctually for 9mm belt, you could use 10mm thick 608 bearings, that could save a lot space.

I managed to get a dual Setup onto my calibers with 15mm belts and 17mm pulleys.
Used some Bolts and bearings as idler.![IMG_20180812_180345|690x388](upload://1fqaA6iVzwQaPfaEfm9JJ5FugWC.jpg)
![1534090077169895091226|375x500](upload://wVa6DSnlQ1xjn1dRPhkFScWNZOD.jpg)
I have a 40 to 18 Ratio with a 310mm belt. But they are a Bit short to rly use the idler to manage the tightness of the belt.
Update: 
Just realised that since this batch is Not mirrowed, i have to Put one clamping Bolt in reverse, otherwise it will not clamp down because only one Side is threaded.

I highly doubt he's trying to cut and run.

And while he doesn't respond to things daily he has responded to tons of people's questions and took a lot of suggestions from the community for his caliber mounts. Shipping from China can take awhile.

I am in Australia and bought two caliber mounts the day they went up for sale. I got them in about 8 weeks or so. I very rarely get anything from China in two weeks. I always assume it will take a month minimum. By the way the mounts are great and worth the wait üòâ

Hey @dickyho. What is the outer diameter of the red part? I want to see if there i can adapt these to my rogue cast trucks which have a similar profile.

Did I miss the answer? 
I got some really wired channel trucks and milled them down to 20.5mm square, so about 29mm diameter, will that fit inside these mounts (I can print (SLA) or laser cut (POM) some spacing so smaller is no problem) ?

So,  in my opinion, there's 2 possibility.
1.  you pulleys possibly not  16/36.
2.  when did you bought my mount ?  the first version I made is for 285 belt. (I was selling those on Mar and earlt AprÔºâ   (I saw the mount you have is anodized to blue, that is a later version, so it is for 290 belt)

Your motor is mounted further in on the mount than the motor in Dickyho's pic. His motor extends past the mount making a longer belt fit snug. If you want it to fit snug you'll need to slide the motor away and mount it as far out as possible.

Just received my mounts and pulleys. Is anyone else having issues getting the wheel pulley to fit on TB218? I'm using spacers and have filed down the pulley and hangar a bit but it just doesn't seem too safe

I was decided to made this one  without stress relief.   so only the outer area of the clamp moves when closing it.  so the sharp edge will cave into the truck, more secure this way.

@dickyho any chance you'll be making wheel pulleys for Kegel cores?  They're so similar to the ABEC pulleys, just instead of using 6 screws to secure too the wheels hub, you'd use 5.  So stoked you not only made the mounts mirrored now, but also got the belt cover!  Very nice :slight_smile:

Hey @dickyho and or anyone else with Calibre's... ordered some of your mounts on ebay before I knew you'd thrown up info on here. I have calibre 2 trucks and just wondering what size motors I can go up to...

 Looking forward to when they turn up. Thanks.

6355 absolut limit and they can't have a nose, they need to be flat. I even had to use some spacer to push my wheels out to get the 15mm setup running.
But you can do it with one forward and one backwards, if looks are unimportant.

Thanks for the quick replies.

That is what I figured from all the pics I have seen. The red ones dicky has look like the 6364's in his ebay listing that I failed to see.

I was thinking about getting a couple of low kv (I'm big) Turnigy SK8 from HK, as shipping is reasonable to New Zealand, unless someone can point me in the direction of an alternative 6355 that isn't going to break the bank (delivered). 

Or has anyone tried the ones dicky sells? as they're an option too..

@dickyho.. Are either of the smaller 2 (red) motors sensored? ... it's hard to tell from the photo. I'd rather go sensored if possible.

My build is going to be a frankensteined longboard deck with skate truck and motors at the rear and k2 kickboard at the front. Consequently, I will likely use scooter wheels which will give me more clearance (6364 might be a good size). I am just getting some mounts made up to attach the k2 front to the deck but I think I'll be on the cautious side and make something that runs the length of the board too .

Everything is open to change though, as it all depends on how the thing turns and rides.. I guess I'll find out when I get it rolling.

Hi @dickyho Dicky, I bought those from you awhile ago because I really liked your mounts, is there any way you could send me a bell for the broken motor?

And I only rode them for like 30 miles before the break down.  I‚Äôve had them awhile but didn‚Äôt have the full parts to build the board.  It took months to get everything.

And I just ordered a bunch of parts from you this morning, so it would be easy to add to my shipment.  I order like 6 motor gears, and two more caliber motor mounts

Is anybody using @dickyho 's gear set (with mounts) on Caliber 2 Trucks and Flywheels? I got my set in and the opening in the wheel gear isn't wide enough to fit around the caliber trucks so the gear doesn't fit. I can open it up with my lathe, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing something obvious.

Instead of milling the truck, I found it very easy to drill out the bore with a drill press. 

I got a step drill bit with a max size of 1" diameter (few bucks on amazon), and used a drill press. The step bit will center itself in the current bore; I drilled a bit past halfway from both end of the pulleys. 1" bore (25.4 mm) doesn't hit the bolt threads. 

You could probably do it with a handheld drill as well, not much material is being removed and aluminum is quite easy to drill; the step bit keeps it straight. I would keep the pulley order, they're quite good.

I've been using your 40T pulley with an 11mm bearing. It works great. The pulley runs smooth and straight. I just had to mill the truck hanger a bit with a file. 

Perhaps you could enlarge the bore of the pulley to 25.4, but leave the last 4mm of the bore at 22mm so that we can still install an 11mm bearing. That way, we wouldn't have to mill-down the truck hanger to clear the pulley.

The black motors above look great and are really cheap I have been wanting to try them for ages. But now seeing about the no retaining ring issue I think it would be great if @dickyho could do a custom order. What is their MOQ for custom?

I think if they add a retaining ring, use high temp glue, and machine down the exposed shaft to 8mm they would be a great e-skate motor. Thick silicone phase wire would also be nice to have.

Pretty much this, :point_up_2: 10mm is actually kind of better. But everyone is already using 8mm size pulleys so you would have a very limited selection in 10mm size. Plus no use for all the ones we already have in our spares box.

I think that defected was a isolated case.  

Yes, I could custom made motors for small quantity, just need to invest money to develop new parts on my own.  those are already silicone wires on the motors now.

do you have pictures of the retainer ring on other motors, let me study at.

for big motors, bigger shaft is better, more torque.
8mm need turning,  I already made some steel pulleys with keyway which are cheap as well.

Correct, but they have the same problem of not enough material extending beyond the motor to protect it.

Ok peeps so I got my mount, idler bearings and belts yesterday.  So here's my bit of feedback if it helps anyone out.

So I've got 90mm flywheel clones with a 36 teeth 12mm wide wheel pulley, 11mm 290 belt and currently a 12 teeth motor pulley (soon to upgrade to a 15 teeth)

The mounts fit perfectly on the  Caliber 2 trucks seems solid but haven't put many miles on them. First test ride and my idler bearings have worked loose and I got a little belt slippage.. So I've just tightened up the nut for now. Anyone else experience this problem?

Due to having only a 12 mm wide wheel pulley I can't move the bearings closer to make the belt tighter the wheel gets in the way. This is why dickyho recommends wider wheel pulleys. Here's a pic of what I mean. I guess if you have to have wider wheel pulleys then might aswell go for a wider belt setup without the idlers
![15387630696487111196871434510937|375x499](upload://lnqounmNYNK5bqIAZxVsXpc7ljT.jpeg) ![15387631594132927660207074702922|375x499](upload://gtbOmiT9vifj0i1nehLiQXIq2eA.jpeg) 

I'm having second thoughts about using idlers, also eventually I will have a dual motor setup.

If anyone is considering buying dickyho mounts and want to use idlers I advise having a wide 15-17mm wheel pulley.

I had similar problems with 50xx motors. 63xx motors have wider bolt pattern. Your motor pullys are forced out to clear bolts. Button head hardware will help. Might need to add spacers to idlers....

can‚Äôt understand why he only use 4mm hole for the idlers. I would make 6mm. 4mm is definitely to lease. I drilled it to 6mm at the position I needed.

What aluminum do they use? I think it‚Äôs a very cheap one. Feels super soft and bendy...

@SqueekyCBJ I'm guessing your using a 15 teeth pulley.  I got a 12 teeth so didn't face this issue. The bolts for the motor are your problem as  Tampaesk8er has said you may need flat heads Or you will have to put washers/spacers between the idlers and the mount to push them out. But then you would need to make sure it ligns up with the wheel pulley, possibly moving your whole mount a little inwards.

@Tampaesk8er I switched mine to normal bearings as you advised it works well and they spin more freely. Also I added a few extra washers/speed rings before my wheel to get the alignment.

Have a look at the pics, the cover is on too. Went for a test ride and so far it's good. Will have to wait and see how it holds up. If everything holds up then I will go for my upgrades to dual motors, a Li-ion battery pack and use these mounts. Still yet to decide if I will use the idlers or just go wider belts?

Ok guys so 2 days of testing the mounts with idlers and so far I'm not having any belt slippage the loctite is holding idlers in place. But I've noticed that my batteries don't last as long?

Probably due to the extra friction caused by the idlers. Also my acceleration is slower but once I get going it's fine

Having good results with this (Caliber) mount so far. I'm running the mount in reverse orientation with a single TB 6374 motor, 40T 15mm DH wheel pulley / 15T 15mm DH motor pulley, and 300mm 5M-15 belt. The mount holds everything together solidly. Blasting up hills in SF has not caused the mount to shift at all (compared with my previous mounts which were from Torqueboards and HobbyKing). The mount does seem very light and the aluminum appears soft (it scratches easily). I'm a little paranoid about it snapping on me. It does a good job of transferring heat from the motor.  

@dickyho : how much torque do you recommend we apply to the main clamping cap screw? I have a torque wrench that does in-lbs/nm.

So do you have the longer version? As you have reverse mounted it, what size wheels? 

I agree it seems soft and can scratch or dent easily but it's holding and the heat transfer from motor to mount is amazing like a super heat sink.

I think bumpy ground is where mounts can  often come loose. Is San Francisco bumpy too?not just hilly? Do you have any slippage with the 15mm wide belts? Idlers or none?

I did notice more torque @Benjamin899 but as you say I think my belt is tight, I will leave it a while to see if it loosens  itself a little after some miles.  Still not sure if I should forget about idlers and go for 15mm belts.

I have the standard version (78mm center-to-center distance) with 97mm Abec Reflys.

I agree...it transfers heat from the motor really well.

SF streets are very bumpy. I have no belt slip at all running without idlers, although I think it's due in part to running a 15T motor pulley (I was getting belt slip under extreme braking when I was running a 14T motor pulley).

Correct, it's a tiny 50mm motor for my son.  It doesn't have any pre-drilled holes for the larger motor mount pattern.  I'll try rotating anyway, although I'm confident it won't make a difference.

Also, I tried a larger 63mm motor (rotated as shown in the pic above) and the upper slot (above the one shown in the pic) still did not line up.  This mount appears to be milled incorrectly.

I'm having an issue where my Caliber mounts face outward a bit. It's not because of the belt tension either, it's that when I tighten it down it leans outs.

After reading all of the good reviews I'm pretty disappointed in the mounts. The design is really good, but the two that I received had some big troubles with sturdiness after <50 miles.

The heads of the screws for mounting the motor are too small, so they dig into the metal if tightened enough to keep the belt tension. Even though the heads are too small, the screws might just be digging in because the metal is not that hard, which is what I think caused this part of the mount to bend:
![unedited|671x415](upload://dVZHAGF9K1fvLvLqVMla9RdErrE.jpeg) 
The result is that the motor pulley is out of alignment with the wheel pulley, which causes the belt to slip on even moderate braking.
![motor|666x500](upload://mdPIRsb9H3aw53Xb4SJpPelJ0o7.jpeg)
The metal is soft enough that I can bend it back into place by hand, but it bends itself back after ~5 minutes of riding. This happened on both of the two mounts that I received, but the one pictured is worse than the other. Maybe I just got a bad batch based off all the good reviews on here.

The aluminum is pretty soft compared to other mounts, but bending it back to straight will only make it weaker over time and it will eventually break. It's better to buy a new mount than try to straighten your current one unless you are adding more metal to help with rigidity. But there's not much room for that.

I took that picture from OP just for illustration purposes, the second picture is the one I took. my mounts are likely from a recent batch as they shipped out on September 19th. I think the issue is just the strength of the material they're made with, the design seems pretty good. I have my motor pulley less than 1 cm outwards from being flush to the mount which might add a little bit more torque onto the mount itself, but I didn't expect that to cause any problems, and its necessary because the can of my motor moves up and down slightly

Why do you have your pulleys so far away from the mount?  Is it an option to get the mount closer to your wheel pulley?  Like you mentioned above, I wonder if your belt being further away from the mount is creating leverage.

How many miles on your mount so far?  And what kind of belt tension are you using?

I understand your point about aluminium. Looking at the 2nd pic, I think you have mounted your pulleys too far away from the face of the motor mount. the tension of the belt is going to pull the motor mount outward over time for sure. closing the gap between motor pulley and the mount, I not saying it wouldn't bend but it should be harder for it to fatigue and bend outward. Im leaving only about 1mm gap.

Also, correct me if I'm wrong... but aren't those motors supposed to be used with the with pulley covers that have the integrated bearing?  I was under the impression that the pulley cover prevents the shaft from shifting under force.  Not saying that this would have prevented your problem, but might have helped...

I have 2 of these motors:
https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-sk8-6364-190kv-sensored-brushless-motor-14p.html
It has issues with the can of the motor moving as described in this thread:
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-hobbyking-motor-6374-sensored/54792/369
The pulley being too close to the mount causes it to scrape, so a simple solution was to move the pulley outwards a little, it doesn't seem unreasonable that the mount should be able to accommodate this. The added stress of it being less than 1cm outwards shouldn't bend it so significantly in such a short time IMO, I think it just highlighted that the mounts are weak around the part where the motor clamps on to the mount.

I measured it and the pulley is 8.3 mm from being flush with the mount. Someone better at physics than me could probably figure out how much torque that would add, but it doesn't seem like much to me

the pulley covers don't work with my motor pulleys, they're meant for the hobbyking pulleys. The shaft moving under force isn't really  problem to me as the magnets of the motor and the tension of the belt prevents it from moving too far so I just let it be.

The design of the mounts are nice but like others said, the material is too soft/the metal too thin.![IMG_20181019_161901|374x499](upload://hhRgS7PHQU8AYEaYcmBJqXmPI77.jpeg)

that makes no sense, your belt transfers only forces in belt direction, perpendicular to the motor, so the length doesnt matter, only the width or the distance of the motor pulley from the mount.

Well, what Im trying to point out here is that the further the motor is from the truck. The bigger levrage to bend the mount. Maybe that didnt Come across.

Since the bldc motor is a spinning msgnetic field, any ferromagnetics could cause an interference. In The mounts case its at the end of the field and really not intercepting, so its probably fine. But still.

It can should all it want, it does. 
I'd draw up a picture with some force vectors on it but..its like.. elementery physics.
If the wheel exhibits retardation on the belt, where do you think that force goes when the motor tries to spin?
I'm not saying its one pecific direction, its many. but increacing the length of the axle does play a role. maybe a minor since i havn't actually done any calculations, but its still there.

Changing the material would be a much better option, this will also reduce any other scrapes and scratches the mount has due to hitting an object. It's definitely soft and chips easily.

Changing to 6mm is probably not a good idea. The motor shaft length will be reduced and could be a problem for 15mm pulleys. Also, the spacing for dual motor setups might be effected if you move from 4mm to 6mm.

You could also make a version without idlers with around 75mm center to center. This way you can leave 5mm thickness but still use harder material. Also this mount could fit better with short wheelbase decks that need all the space for the enclosure.
Why not making 2 version, 50xx and 63xx?
Edit: if you make the design simple, no extra holes or funny shapes, the machining time and money should be less, so less investment, more profit

you could also change those socket head m4 screws to a flat profile screw. alternatively, @dickyho could make a mount with a recess for the screws to sit in.

I was thought that socket head screws are more strong, can cave into the aluminum, makes them not easy to loose. actually, if for 63 motors, this mount  designed to to use 3 socket head m4 screws + 1 mushroom head screw to fasten the motor, in that case the socket head screws will not interfere with the belt or the pulley.

making recess for the screws to sit in, this need to both side milling, increased cost, and also need to increase the thickness....

It's pretty impressive that you have already sold 1000 mounts and only have a handful of complaints.  Sounds to me like there must be good batches and bad batches.

If you can find the exact distance between the outside edge of the motor mount, I can see how feasible it is. You would also need four of the black motor mount screws to screw into the pulley cover hole since they are metric, not standard US sizes. As for pricing, might be around $30 -40 shipped? But at that point you might as well buy new mounts. I did it because I wanted to stand my board on the wall without hitting the motors.

When you have a really thick section suddenly change to a thin section, that can make it more easy to bend. A better way is a slow change from thick to thin. Or add a Rib on the thin part.  This can make it stronger even with same material. 

![image|690x405](upload://cmHBDtzsrMscnoIrecvCAZ1aqws.png) 

As for the support bar, you could just offer a long size, if its too long for some people they can just cut in down shorter themselfs.

@dickyho see with your supplier the price of 2024 aluminum, it's the first choice when you need a structural lightweight component since it's way cheaper than 6061 or 7075

But also the thickness is the main problem here, you can make it with 7075-T651 and it will probably still bend

I had the same problem in my first mount and it was 6061-T6 6.35mm thick

As you said, the expensive thing is machining and material, so go thicker that's the cheapest way to make it reliable

For people that want to reverse mount, the best way would be to just extend the length of the motor mount section that allows for the crossbar to be installed directly without needing an adapter piece. 
I think the best solution is to use a better material such as 6 or 7 series aluminum, if you look at Torqueboards mounts they are pretty thin but they use good quality aluminum so they don't bend.

Looking at the design of those, I think the crossbar might bend where it overhangs from the motor mount, since a lot of the forces will be focused there. Either the right angle in the crossbar piece should be flush against the tip of the motor mount, or a thicker sheet should be used.

yes, that is true.  I was thinking 1mm stainless steel will be strong, and 2mm would be too thick, will push the motor pulley outward. maybe I would try 1.2 or 1.5mm.

thought of material already refined, thickness increase,  and the pulley cover can help to stronger the system....  so it might ok...

28.5 mm. But if the relief cut is made after doing the inside and outside milling it may vary a bit. Due to tension in the metal piece

Would it be complicated and/or much more expensive to make them a little longer or wider on the motor side plate so we can just add a aluminum tube or a crossbar?
I think someone added an aluminum tube and some threaded rod but around the idlers position or something.

I recently bought the mounts, and although I'm still making my build I finished the drivetrain and decided to make a 3d printed motor guard. Very satisfied with intial impression of the mounts! I bought the extra long ones so I can mount both my motors behind my rear trucks, but don't want to be leaning the board up against walls and have it directly sit against the motors.

Here's [pics of the parts I made](https://imgur.com/a/fm3swGz), and here's a [link to download the stl](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3207854).

I have seen them on TB218 trucks and it didn‚Äôt seem to fit very well. I would measure the exact position and then file the truck to it‚Äôs near perfect shape to achieve a half decent seat. Finally glue the mounts to the hanger using a metal compatible epoxy. Very unlikely they will ever get loose.

This part here:

Once fitted they have never come loose.  I just used loctite on the screws so they don't vibrate loose.

I did without filing anything, i did the coin trick, take out the long screw from the clamp and insert it from the opposite side and slip a coin and start tightening the screw to open the clamp just enough to slide it on the TB truck, just like in these pictures, but, becarefull, dont open the clamp so much that you can damage it.![image|666x500](upload://8ARmLy0a6SFQnP9JGpqg9vIBiBP.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://72MarbMv67iRKrmbYBCKuPLMlwk.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://6EM2oujEiqE3wqZQbNZYEq97u2e.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://3QsbPyeSDut2OHTb4U8L7qrs0Tj.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://yvjkiEK3eREGJO8KZl8NNyK2cAf.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://kLyyad9S6TOlmJ9pR1aPUZHEi5V.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://ufP2TJiSMQE6tO925DkG4iqLjpX.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://dZP7wvwSk4I73hOM9YwHXC6ehtX.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://5mCD5omizGwQlbRljCt9TqYENS0.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://rkp6fGIK5e2aPDzlO1WOzlJQzMh.jpeg)

Yes! I got it working with a dual Turnigy Sk3 6374 192kv motors, but by the skin of my teeth. Nearly no margin/give. Make sure to get some spacers and then get a few washers from the hardware store to get the wheels as far apart as you can because you'll need it. Both of my motors are rear mounted and there's about half a millimeter between the motors. I have 15mm belts and the motor pulleys are about 1 millimeter from the end of the motor shaft. I considered getting dickyho's gears, but they have two millimeters of extra material each and it wouldn't have fit.

Sorry for the newb question. I'm pretty green w DIY. I had ordered 255 265 275mm belts. I was hoping to pair this w jlabs mounts but he's out of stock. Then somewhere in this thread I read people are using 290mm, 300mm. I got confused. Then factor in long vs short mounts. So this made me scratch my head. 

I could potentially just use the idlers to get the belts "snugged" on the pulleys. I'm just worried about having too short of a belt for these mounts if I were to get them.

@dickyho is there a drawing of the dimensions of the holes for the idlers with regard to each other?
I have to print a mount for 2 encoders sitting in the middle (between the motors) and I want to hook them on 3 threaded rods I put through the idler holes, which also will keep my mounts from bending.

In my experience that's not where they bend, the bend once the mount gets thin so the bars there would be of little to no use.

Ok, then let me put it this way, I already have the rods connecting both mounts, they helped me to mount them aligned and I didt experience any bending. 

Still I'd like to have the dimensions to make a encoder holder...

@dickyho could you let me know if the "Dual motors longboard skateboard controller with ESC Substitute" can work with only one motor setup? 
Thinking of adding a second one later on, just not now. 
I'm speaking in regards to the belt driven 10S option. 
I'm pretty new in the eSk8 community so sorry if the answer might be common knowledge. 

And for that matter, if anyone that sees this has experience with this dual motor controllers please feel free to answer me.

Why would that be? I was thinking of starting with a single 6374 belt motor powered by 10S2P battery and then later on add the second. From my understanding a 6374 has enough torque and good speed for use as single drive.

Hey my friend, its not the motor thats the problem its that esc.  Its factory programmed for 18 amp per motor.  Thats it.  It will be very underwhelming with a single motor.  You would be better off buying the programmable vesc and adding another later on.

Theres a multitude of 4.12 vescs out there at the moment all around that price.  Try Hobby king.  I've used them and they are a nice strong unit.  @dickyho has the maytech version which is also good but a bit more money.  The cheapest atm is the torque boards though and again I use them and they work well

My setup is a TB 218mm truck w/ dual Turnigy SK3 6374 motors and these mounts. It works but it's suuuuper close! I have about 2-3 mm of combined clearance between the motors and pulley to wheels. You'll need to get spacers on the wheels to get them as far out as they'll go but it is possible. I'm happy with my system.

Hey @dickyho, that seems like wasted motor/battery energy from the drag and extra/unecessary parts with the idler bearings on there... Not trying to be rude or down your product but why don't you just use the correct size belt especially because you can tension it however snugly you wish on the mount? Either that or have the belts ride on the outside of a toothed idler pulley or two instead of being pinched down onto the motor pulley by bearings (non spring loaded idler bearings to boot) as this would reduce the friction on the belts/motors and even increase speed/torque. Idk, just a thought. Additionally, I would maybe think about implementing some kind of connector bar to go between and attach both motor mounts together to make them more solid.. I don't like to use the flanges as they make it more difficult to get my belts on and off without taking my motor's mounting screws loose from the mounts which I like to use loc tite on because I only use two screws not all four. I am 230lbs and I ride with packs and gear a lot (I have 6" wheels also and I cannot get my motor and wheel pulleys as close together as yours are or I cannot reach one of my motor to mount screws without taking the wheel off, which kind of defeats the purpose) so I have had issues with the mounts flexing a little under torque  This flex puts the pulley at a slight angle and the belts can sometimes work their way part or all the way off the pulley. Anyway, like I said, not trying to be a dick just pointing out some possible downsides to this design & suggesting some proactive options for possible solutions. Getcha Roll On!

Yes sir they are. I actually saw those shortly after I posted but it was too late to take it back then lol. I still feel the same about the idlers though. and belts by far the cheapest thing I buy, I'd rather have less tax on my motors & batteries and risk a belt now and then. I always have two spares with me but I've only needed one once. I have my brakes dialed in! They are like anti-lock, I can be going full speed (25-30mph) and nail the brakes and it just sounds like something powering down and I come to a very smooth complete stop within about 7-8 feet. A lil more going down hill but not much. No skidding, no launching off board, and no skipping teeth. Did you see my PM to you yet about the Airless AT Kit?

This might come across as rude, but, no one is being forced to buy or install the idler pulleys with their motor mounts. Every person can build their board however they want, that‚Äôs what makes them great. If you don‚Äôt want idlers on your board, don‚Äôt put idlers in your board. Simple as that. If you have a setup with strong brakes and good acceleration that doesn‚Äôt skip teeth, great. Personally I don‚Äôt, so I run the idlers, even if it sacrifices a couple hundred feet of range.

I don't consider your comment rude @Jellybean I just don't think your seeing the entire picture. Also, I don't know why you got the impression I was trying to tell you or anyone else what to do with their own builds. I was not and never would do that. I was simply expressing my opinions to Dickyho.
Secondly, it's not "a couple feet of range" that concerns me, iIf that was my entire concern I'd be a real douchebag lol. What concerns me is the constant extra work my motor would be subject to with the extra drag from the idlers. This extra work creates heat which diminishes performance and eventually breaks down components. This extra work also creates more constant tax on my battery which also causes more heat (a battery's worst enemy) which, in turn, breaks down the battery cells faster. So my concern is not for a few dollar belt or a couple hundred  feet of range. My concern is for the vital and most expensive parts of my setup, the motors and the battery.
But these opinions are my own and I'm not asking anyone else to agree with me or to change their opinions or actions because oi anything I say. Actually, please don't take my (or anyone else's for that matter) opinions for anything other than food for thought. Everyone should always do their own research and develop their own opinions. I would suggest however, that "needing" to use the idlers is just the symptom of other underlying problems and that when you finally get your setup correct (the right size pulleys & belts, the best center to center distance for your pulleys, motor mounts mounted solidly, VESC setup properly for your build, etc...) that you will not have the need for idlers anymore. Also (like I previously stated to Dickyho), if you do need them, why not use toothed idler pulley(s) the belts ride the outside of which actually reduce wear and can increase speed and/or torque?
But again, these opinions are my own and I'm certainly not trying to tell you or anyone else that they should agree with me, or what they should or shouldn't do with their own builds.
Have a good day man and Getcha Roll On!

From what I have found in my small amount of experience in esk8 is frictional heat generated is very little compared to the variations you can get in riding style. Also, lithium batteries do have a optimal temperature that they perform best at, which I believe is around 80F, so some warming isn't terrible. I have never found my LiPo batteries to get overly warm from my skateboard the way they can in my RC cars. Kind of a "how you drive, not what you drive" scenario. 

Maybe its my background in robotics, but to me running belts means running tensioners close to the sources of high torque to keep teeth from skipping. Where as idlers in chain systems are more for reducing slack. We all could run chains and rarely need idlers but have a noisy drivetrain that also requires more maintenance. That's a choice made when building, but chain drivetrains are harder to find in our application. 

Perhaps you could explain these toothed idler pulleys, I am having a hard time picturing it?

@SlimSh8y Lol toothed idler pulley, what are you even rambling about? 

The whole point of the idler is to engage more teeth on the motor pulley. That's it. A toothed idler would be doing the opposite. 

Idlers originally came about because there was only a limited gear ratio you could(due to small wheel size usually). People wanted to gear up for higher speed.  This would leave you with a small motor pulley which most people found skips. Hence the idlers to engage more teeth....

LOL wtf is this. It's like slimsh8y doesn't have any idea what he's talking about. Leave the engineering to the engineers. An idler like that not is not only pointless, as others have said, REDUCES teeth engagement causing an increase in skipping. And contrary to your thinking that it reduces friction, it actually increases it because the total surface area of contact is greater with teeth than smooth.

It would be better to simply tighten the belt than to use a toothed idler like that.

@dickyho I wish I had you're awesome 3d modeling skills. Could you make a revised version of the pulley cover .stl file with a little extra material on the bottom to protect the mounts and the motors from getting banged up? It would be cool for going over curbs and for making the motors and mounts last longer. I got the idea when I saw Hoyt St. motor mount protectors.

Awesome! Thanks @dickyho I look forward to seeing your updated design and I will hold off on printing covers for my setup until they are done. I hope you don't mind if I bug you about getting them done in the near future. :slight_smile:
