I'm clearing out some stuff as some of you may know.  I've sold a lot of 15mm pulley kits, so this could be a good deal for someone with some looking to make a board for cheap.  For $90 USD shipped, I will send you two complete pulley kits and 2 trucks.  The trucks was a project I never got around to completing. My intention was to design a set of trucks with flanges so that a simple motor mount plate could be bolted on, thus reducing the cost and the need for clamps or other motor mount solutions.  Anyways, if someone wanted to try these trucks, could be a fun project.  It is tight with the 15mm pulley so the motor mount plate would need to most likely be mounted on the inboard side of the flange.

I charge $40 USD for a single set of pulley kits, so you are getting good value here!

You would have to make your own motor mounts most likely

@WSB makes nice mounts with slots but doubt if they are the same axial distance in which case you could rethread new holes to match in the trucks

Also @korryh similar but again slot distance from centre is the thing

I have less than a mm.

Yeah seems 15mm pulley is out of the question unless mount arm is inboard
