Hi,

I have made some extra anti-spark switches that I would like to offer for sale.

• original mouser components
• all SMD components are already soldered
• including shrink tube to protect the whole switch
• 2 oz copper
• blue pcb
• widened traces

You will need a fuse (can also be bridged with a wire) and a switch of your choice to get it running.
I can also presolder AWG 10 or AWG 12 wire.

## 29€ each + shipping (worldwide)
**Located in EU (Salzburg, Austria)**

Thanks!

@jga @rob.in.space
Yea, there are still some available (just finished soldering a few more)

Shipping rates apply for both CH and UK:
5,50€ economy without tracking (5-12 days)
6,90€ priority without tracking (2-4 days)
9,75€ priority with tracking (2-4 days)

My paypal is PayPal.Me/goldenhusky

btw (just to clearify things): I thought that tracking is included with priority shipping, which is not the case,
so I paid the additional amount for the people I already promised tracking for 6,90€, my mistake.

You can also check your shipping costs at the austrian post service website www.post.at

Thanks!

@Michael319
I guess both are sufficient, nevertheless, using an anti spark switch gives you more possibilities and comfort. You can use e.g. a led switch mounted through your enclosure (looks cool!) for switching your board on and off, instead of the (in my opinion kinda uncomfortable) xt90 and also take advantage of a fuse that can be mounted on the pcb etc.

I've also put the switches to @JLabs awesome esk8 marketplace:
 https://eu.electric-skateboard.market/product/vedder-anti-spark-switch/
Check it out and make sure to offer there your parts you want to get rid of! :imp:

The switches do now include presoldered AWG10 wire and a yellow shrink tube!
Every switch is made with love (yea, really :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) and gets of course tested before taken to the post office!

Sure, but you have to put them in serial so they add up, putting the resistors in parallel will destroy the led because of the high current flowing.

I'm afraid, currently not in stock. But new pcbs and components will arrive next week. 
Yes, they support 12s voltage, the components are rated for 60V (Fets) and 100V (caps+resistors).
Maybe have a look at the new DirectFet switches.

Doesn't the voltage have basically no effect on the heat? 1600W can be misleading since 1V 1600A versus 1600V 1A will generate completely different temperatures. I think I saw an image where he tested his new PCBs on more than 40A but at like 4V

Yep. The voltage is mostly irrelevant but if this is meant to run at 40V then might as well test it at 40V. The failure mode would actually be quite different now that I think about it

[/quote]

I think there won't be different temperatures, no matter if 1600V and 1A or 1600A and 1V. At least in the theory.

Basicially I²R losses generate the heat, but also U*I since it's only ohmic load when using my resistor array for example. So if you have 1V and 1600A, you have U*I= 1600W dissipation power. To make it possible that 1600A flow at 1V the resistor needs to be 1/1600. So according to I²R it's 1600²*1/1600 which is also 1600.

Same when using 1600V and 1A. U*I is also 1600W in this case. You will need a resistor of 1600V/1A to allow only 1A to flow at 1600V, so again, according to I²R it's 1²*1600=1600W.

So voltage and current aren't really relevant if their product stays the same. I'm using a 5V/70A LED supply for testing my switches. I already did something like that with the DirectFet switches but with 55A if I remember correctly.

Edit:
I went for the 5V/70A for several reasons: A 40V/70A supply would be quite expensive and when testing the switch I only care about the heat generated on the switch itself and not on my resistors, so the heat is dependent on the resistance of the Fets and the traces. Of course you could also do it via the occuring voltage drop.. but who chooses the hard way? :joy:

Hi Pyt,

this switch won't work with the Vedder Anti spark, you need a latching SPDT type switch.

Hi,
sorry for the late answer, had math finals today.

The switch can handle max. 60V and is sufficient for a dual motor setup. If you intend to use a fuse, you might need one with a higher rating than the widely recommended 40A.

@goldenHusky Thanks for the shipment. I've finally taken the time to try and connect it. What type of latching SPDT do you recommend? I've searched for any DC type, but they all go to a maximum of 24v, but my battery is 42v. https://nl.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20170527061529&SearchText=latching+spdt+switch+dc

Hi @majid 
The 12 or 24V are meant as rated voltage for the internal LED not for the rated voltage of the switch itself. You can use any SPDT switch you like.

@rok Do you have a link to a shop, a schematic or something like that? I think this switch won't work because it has only 4 pins and 2 of them are for the LED, so it's just a SPST type switch and not a SPDT.

You will need a SPDT switch with 3 pins. They are easy to find, just look for a switch with 3 pins (and seperate pins for LED-lighting etc.). I just found this one (WRONG LINK I AM SORRY!!)

and I have wire it like that.

Hi @sayreul
you need a latching switch, a momentary won't work.
Also, please connect it like this:
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/7/17a6168e001710e67c3c93600ebdf507cc210c86.PNG" width="690" height="238">
The above schematic shows only how to power 2 VESCs with an Vedder Anti spark and no further thing like Canbus connection or anything like that. For making the LED-ring light up when your board is powered on, check post #29.

Edit: Schematic doesn't show the the required fuse or wire bridge between the inner pads on the top of the pcb.

Hi @suwuj12
the rated current of your LED will flow when you use a 1.1 kOhm resistor rated for at least 0.5W.
I personally would go with a higher resistor value like 3 to 4 kOhm on your 8s setup, because the LED will light up sufficiently at far lower than rated current flowing, you have also less heat losses and this 3 to 4k resistor only needs to be rated for at least 0.1W.

No, but is your push button momentary? You need a latching one for the vedder switch.

@longhairedboy 
The 1.9kohm are calculated for rated current of the LED, so if you use a 1.9kohm resistor then 20mA will flow through. Of course you can use a resistor with a higher value like 4,5 or 6kohm. The LED won't be that bright then but still sufficient in my opinion. The whole resistor thing isn't that delicate lol

Wouldn't say that is much easier, you have to 3d print, XT90, resistor and button. Then you need to hold the button for 3 seconds before connecting the XT90, a small resistor would get burned fast if you for some reason tried giving full throttle before plugging in the XT90. A easier way would be a single XT90 Anti-spark.

Hi @louwii
the one with the lower price is a single mosfet design, it can handle less current than the dual mosfet which is 10€ more (speaking of the plug'n play version).
The difference between the two 35€ models is that one is for 6s to 12s and one for 6s to 16s.

Wait a moment, are you speaking of the switch with the solder pads or the JST terminal on them?

LED+ and LED- on the model with the JST terminal aren't necessary for functionality, you can just leave them if you have a switch without led ring.
If you have one with solder pads, you have to solder everything according the the schematic in post #175

Hi @Redfire1
the Antispark requires an external SPDT type switch, it's a 5-pole switch and usually has the pins NO, NC, C, led+ and led-.

For utilizing the led of the external switch, you'll need an additional resistor to limit the current for the led. In case of your 10s battery pack that would be a 0.5W resistor with a value of around 2000 Ohm.

I hope I got your questions right.

At 1.5kOhm 20 to 16mA will flow through the led depending on how charged your battery is, if the led of the switch is rated for 20mA then you can use that resistor,if not I would check out local stores because paying shipping for a single resistor is meh..

Hello I am working on making my own anti spark switch and ordered this switch.  My question is to power the LED on 12s you said to use a 1900ohm 1w resistor.  How did you come up with 1900.  I think I could figure it out if I knew the voltage drop of the LED but I don't.    I tried finding a 1900ohm resistor on digikey and the only one I can find is $70.00 which doesn't seem right.  Thank You.

Hi @zblad
alright, worst case for the led is when your 12s battery pack is fully charged so the voltage will be  12*4.2V= 50.4V. 50.4 minus 12V (led requires 12V) is 38.4V and 38.4V divided through 20mA (the rated current of most led used in those switches) is 1920 ohms. So that is the minimum resistor value, however it's better to use a higher value resistor since most leds are bright enough at even lower currents like 10 mA.

Also keep an eye on the maximum dissipation power of the resistor you use.

[quote="zblad, post:230, topic:15639"]
the only one I can find is $70.00
[/quote]
It's probably a lot of 5000 pcs then, they also offer them in lower amounts but their website is kinda tricky.

[quote="zblad, post:230, topic:15639"]

The description of your switch says 230VAC (that is the max. voltage at C, NC, NO) and 12V/15mA for the led rating.

I am still waiting for my switch I ordered. ![image|375x500](upload://1dvW3CbYCWInRasdIxC0dxjYv9B.jpeg)![image|375x500](upload://riaA6AYIfilgN1e6HJD8NqIvXqd.jpeg)

You could strip some wires and solder them ontop of the traces, would also look sick imo. Dead bug style!

You can use the on/off switch of the switch you currently own, the connections are printed on the backside of the switch so don't worry, there's also a simple schematic on my website next to the product picture

Yes it is.

Because it expired months ago.

You will need to solder the xt60 on it, you'll get what is shown in the product picture + the 5pin cable for the switch of course.

Thanks for your order!

@Vanarian  Yes, I feel like the market is saturated, further many people decided to offer antisparks lately. In my opinion it's better to pay 20$ more for the BMS or ESC and have it integrated on it then. Cheaper, more compact, less likely to fail.. so yeah.

I understand how you feel but here are my thoughts : 
- currently I trust only you and @Martinsp to provide quality compact anti sparks 
- built-in AS in BMS or ESC also means that if one fails, **everything** goes down and board can't be used until part replacement or repair comes home
- people who already have an ESC be don't need to replace it are more prone to buy an AS instead of a full setup which is more expensive. 

I mean : in my personal experience I got two ESCape sixies, there's no existing upgrade available for me as far as ESC goes. 

So a bit sad to see you let it go mate! Will you eventually take custom orders in a smaller scale?
