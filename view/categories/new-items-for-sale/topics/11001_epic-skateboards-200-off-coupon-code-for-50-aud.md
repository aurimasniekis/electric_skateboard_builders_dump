I have a $200 coupon which can go towards any Epic brand electric skateboard, on this website >>  http://www.epicelectricskateboards.com/    If anyone wants to buy an electric skateboard from these guys, get my coupon code for $200 off. $50 and it's yours. I got it from a current Maccas Monopoly chance win. The code only works for complete boards and not accessories, btw.
