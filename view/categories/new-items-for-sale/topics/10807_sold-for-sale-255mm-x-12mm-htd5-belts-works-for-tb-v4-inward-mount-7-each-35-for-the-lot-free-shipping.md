Looked up some rates, but it's looking like $60 minimum for shipping. It's probably better to find a local source!

You are right^^ Thats not cheap. I have a Belt source near my city but the quality is not the best. All 3 Weeks one belt breaks from them.

for some reason I have been eating my belt quicker than usual and have adjusted my tension and wheel and gears so many times... anyways I am going to need to replace my belt more often until I figure it out - so I will buy them
