Hey guys,

So I have ordered 2 FS-GT2B. Which are the same as the HKGT2B. However this one has no battery. You'll have to substitute with either a lipo or just an 18650 cell. No biggie :) 

Its unopened and unused. I'd rather have someone here take it then having to send it back to the UK.

I bought it for 22,99€ + Shipping. I'll just sell it as 22€ + Shipping to you.



Best regards,
```

You still have this and what would it cost to get shipped to US?
