I know a lot of you are waiting for more FOCBOX stock to arrive, and I am sure to miss emailing at least one or two of you on the waiting list so hopefully this post will avoid anyone missing out.

I have lots of FOCBOX in stock as of today, however they will not last long...

I know right! 

It's on my list I promise - Now all I need to do is get to the position in the list that item is on :)
