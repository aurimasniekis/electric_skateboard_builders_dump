Hey @kug3lis I was just wondering your FATBOY TB 218 is on sale for 499 right now but when you go to purchase it says 540 just wondering what is going on with that? is there a sale on it or should be wait till your B/F SALE of 10% which  seems to be the right price as your sale price as of now just curious to wait or to buy now and by pass the madness

Hey kug3lis i have a doubt, the Fatboy antispark switch has auto power off or only push to start?
It needs yes or yes switch?

It has push to start and no auto power off :)

It can turn on via start to push or button and turns off via only button hold for a few seconds :)
