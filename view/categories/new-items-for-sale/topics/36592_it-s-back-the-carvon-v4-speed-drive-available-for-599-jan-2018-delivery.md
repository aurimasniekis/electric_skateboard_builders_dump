It's probably cause exo isn't doing the best. Everyone in that price bracket spends their money for cheap stuff.

I'd be willing to bet my left arm this is because the group buy was a blazing success, and probably provided seed money for the round of manufacturing enabling this.  Well done!

I think it's safe to say we can all get our carve on now.

what's the difference between torque and speed drive?
```

---
## \#21 Posted by: Michaelinvegas Posted at: 2017-11-01T18:36:24.603Z Reads: 209

```
Torque drive is made for lower end power, which translates to lower top speed. Speed drive is just that, it has less torque, higher top speed.

cool, two questions. 

so torque drive maybe lower kv to achieve more torque, but less speed?

is the torque and speed drives priced the same?

I should ask jerry these questions, gonna meet up soon to hand over cash monies

It's covered in one of the carvon threads, but,

Torque drive is modified latest kowheel hub motor. smaller lower wattage motor than speeddrive, lower KV, lower top speed. cheaper. IIRC 85kv.

Speed drive is in carvon family tree, bigger stronger motors, but higher KV. I think 115KV. I believe they're smaller overall than the v2.5, and "geared" higher.

When you see him ask him about the mini drives!
