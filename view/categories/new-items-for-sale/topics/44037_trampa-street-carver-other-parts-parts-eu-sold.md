I'm selling some parts because I changed my mind before even building the board.

This is the list:

- Dual motor mount + 2x pulley + 2x htd5-15mm-300 belt €108,- -> 75,-
- 2x Motor 6374 200kV 3.3kW 10mm shaft sensored esk8.de 2x €120,- ->2x 90,-

Prices are excluded from shipping (EU, the netherlands)
