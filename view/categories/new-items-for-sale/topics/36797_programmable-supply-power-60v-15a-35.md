Just found this deal, think its nice to share with you since many people use those slow laptop brick chargers
This is really cheap compared to other ones ive found so here you go

You can get these on Amazon(US) too, and don't forget you still need to provide an AC-DC power supply at least 10% higher voltage than your full charge voltage

Add one of these and you can charge any lithium configuration up to 10S at 3A
Also keep in mind these units take up to 55V **input** and max 50v **output**
Could be used for 12S with 55V input with full charge at 4.16V per cell, which isn't a problem in my view.

One can build a pretty decent adjustable bench power supply with one of these. Only need few extra parts, like enclosure, Meanwell PSU (or similar), some connectors, wires...

I thought 15A version was overkill so I got the 5A version (DPS5005) and earlier this year build a bench PSU for my experiments.

Now I got the Bluetooth/USB module version so just today, I did a simple swap operation because Bluetooth control is really nice to have. I'll probably be selling the older version soon.

Anyhow, here is the setup I had / now have, has been serving me well so far and now with Bluetooth control, it will be even more convenient :slight_smile:

Something to be aware of, some versions of the modules require a diode in series on output for protection when connecting capacitive loads (like the battery charge). They include the diodes with the item. In my album it is the small zip-lock bag at the top of the PSU, in second photo I replaced it with USB module, as I'm using Bluetooth and this version of module has the diode on the PCB.

I love my DPS5015 module it's a great lab bench PSU for far cheaper than anything even close to it. I have it connected to a 24V 20A PSU in the rear and it works pretty well, wish I had a 48V 10A PSU but for now it works well. I 3d printed an enlcoure for it I found on Thingiverse and it fits very well. Second pic is how I mounted the PSU behind my desk. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/e/2e634836180fb71277309a8d3ff83164e1c059ef.jpg" width="690" height="389"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/3/63fd1a7009fa7782c56cd77501943f2a02671155.jpg" width="690" height="389">

No your totally fine charging with one of those types of chargers as long as they have some sort of current protection and your not charging at to high current and your voltage limit is set correctly. Obviously a balance charger would be better though if you have a BMS then yeah this is totally fine.

I think the cc part is really the important part and it's there to keep the cells from getting bombed with high current when the pack is low and you were to set it on your bulk charger to a high voltage.  In that situation a basic circuit, like a power supply above, just works with ohms law to determine the current output so it could potentially over current the cells and you have to be aware of what your bulk supply will do there.   a balance charger will do the cc and limit the current in that situation and then later get into cv mode when the discrepancy between the pack and supply isn't so great as to cause such a high current.  

I think the only real thing that needs to be made certain of is that it's a regulated supply and the current being fed is not some freak stuff with peaks and valleys of voltage.

what can you bms charge at?  

you don't need the drok control thing, in fact the last one shows to be same and it's a constant voltage anyway.  that's what these plain power supplies are.  if you want more colors bells and whistles then that's all I see in them unless they're actually doing a cc limit when the pack is low and put to a high current charge

but...after reading this
http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries

I'm thinking the cc cv thing is a misguided solution to lithium.  hear me out.

the cv stage is just to make sure the cell isn't charged to a voltage beyond 4.2 or whatever and that's not an issue with a plain old power supply as they're already a cv that's set by the user.

the  cc is PERCIEVED to be a help if youre connecting a low voltage battery to a high voltage charge with a lot of power as it's said you could potentially put more amps in than good for the cells.  I say perceived because this isnt really a problem unless youre using a REALLY high power supply and I've read a couple examples where it's shown that fast charging isn't bad for li-ion cycle life and the practice is the norm for electric cars these day.

https://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/article/rapid-charging-and-draining-doesn-t-damage-lithium-ion-battery-electrodes-much

even if you were to dump continuously 15 amps from the charger above into an 8amp hour pack of 30q cells youre at half of the rated possible charge rate.  

And then the thing that IS dangerous with charging lithium is having it sit on trickle charge for too long which is something that a cc cv charge doesn't deal with I think.

waiting for all naysayer!

@Hummie Thanks for linking those articles, read them all.

Okay I think mostly you have it right. The current in a circuit is dictated by the load (resistance). Since battery pack IR is very low, ohm's law says packs will basically pull a metric shit-ton of current from a supply if not limited.

Math example: charger/psu is supplying 50.4v. pack is 12s1p with 20mohm per cell (spec sheet says DC IR is 20mohm), 240mohm for the pack.

ohm's law: V = IR, or V/R = I

50.4v / 0.240 ohm = 210a

210a should pop the psu and torch the cells... Actually I think what would really happen is your 8a psu will supply 12a for a while then either pop its internal protection or fuse, or catch fire. :)

The way CC/CV works, first, current is limited (which forces voltage down), then if you reach that current, voltage is limited, forcing the current down.

So CV stage comes after CC.

You're right that CC is to limit the rate at which energy is entering the pack. You're also right that most cells can probably handle more than the spec sheet says. But cells can handle what they can handle, going above that will damage the cells. You can't pour 10C into a cell rated for 1C charge and expect them to hold up. This is where it's best to follow the mfg spec sheet. They've done tons of tests and know what their cells can take.

None of the articles you linked contradict this. Actually all the articles you linked were interpreting the same research study on a made-to-purpose cell, and draw some reaching conclusions. I don't think it's relevant to the 18650 cells we're using.

As the cells get fuller, the voltage rises. When you hit the CV voltage limit, the charger keeps the voltage from rising further by cutting current. A PSU with adjustable voltage is probably okay here. But going too high on voltage is REALLY bad for the cells so you want to be sure the PSU is behaving as you expect/wish.

even if you were to dump continuously 15 amps from the charger above into an 8amp hour pack of 30q cells youre at half of the rated possible charge rate.

Dude wtf!

8ah pack https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/samsung-18650-30Q-spec-sheet.pdf?13304021761413850609

How did you get 8ah pack??

Spec sheet says capacity is 3ah. standard charge 1.5a (0.5C), max current 4.0a (1.3C). Going with this weird 8ah, that means the pack is 2.67p. Standard charge rate would be 4a (2.67 * 1.5a), max charge is 10.68a (2.67 * 4a).

If this were something like a more normal 10s4p pack, 4p makes it 12ah (4 * 3ah). Standard charge rate is 6a (4 * 1.5a), max charge rate is 16a (4 * 4a).

If samsung says 4a is max charge rate, going higher than that WILL shorten life.

And then the thing that IS dangerous with charging lithium is having it sit on trickle charge for too long which is something that a cc cv charge doesn't deal with I think.
[/quote]

Generally true, trickle charging is bad for most lithium ion cells. But there are differences! A123 for example can trickle charge (at lower than max voltage) with little ill effect.

CC/CV Power Supplies do not cut power and continue to trickle charge.

CC/CV _charger_ have a cutoff current, below which it cuts off power. Usually C/10 (for a 4a charger, 0.4a).

If you haven't noticed, most things that have lithium ion batteries (cell phones, etc.) don't trickle charge. They terminate the charge when full, then perhaps will begin the charge cycle again if/when the voltage drops lower than some threshold (topping off charge).

So yeah I think a CC/CV PSU is an incomplete solution. I'd advocate putting a timer on the wall plug if using a CC/CV power supply to charge.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014SGCN88/

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D3QEK4E/

Oh btw that 60v 8A PSU you found, nice, gone! :(

The thing that's different about the regulator @scepterr is linking and your PSU, your PSU is not adjustable CC.

Constant Current really means max current limit.

Most PSU have rated max current, but does not limit and hold current to the rated max. Rather, it allows some brief excursions above the rated max, then pops some protection or a fuse, or blows. From the description, "Overload protection: 105%-150% cut off output"

Holy crap wrote all that... I'm supposed to be BF shopping. I guess it's all good though, writing this kind of stuff out forces me to be precise in what I'm thinking and knowing.

I think with the ohms law equation you wrote you need to incorporate the pack voltage so it's not 50 and a minimal resistance but the difference between the supply and the battery

a123 aren't li-ion

I see your point with the timer.  but it's vague the "trickle" as to how long it can be on.  with my supply it will slowly creep up to 50v  at the end doing maybe half an amp.  I wonder if that's a problem

[/quote]

Click on the spec sheet link. It's worth a careful look.

With respect to fast charge/discharge, I believe what actually hurts cells is temperature. If you can monitor temperature and perhaps do active cooling, you can charge/discharge at faster rates without hurting the cells.

The true answer of what these cells can take will be from someone doing repeated abusive charge/discharge cycles while monitoring temperature (characterizing the cell). Haven't seen this yet.

Take a look at this pdf, it's A123 but there's some hardcore information about lithium ion in general.

http://www.revolectrix.com/support_docs/item_1229.pdf

[quote=from the A123 pdf]
FMA previously determined that LiPo cycle life is directly related to cell operating temperature. We recommend 140° F as the maximum LiPo operating temperature. Operating temperature is such a key factor that we define the nominal LiPo discharge as the rate at which cell temperature reaches 140° F.

FMA introduced and promoted cell temperature as a cell rating factor. A 2s LiPo pack tested at 140° F exceeded 450 cycles. Operating cells above 140° F has a devastating effect. An identical 2s pack reached end of life at 38 cycles when operated at 175° F.

Respectfully disagree. Li-ion, lipoly, lifepo4 are all subtypes of lithium ion. Within the 3.6v 18650s we're used to, there are many different chemistries as well.

Yeah how much it hurts is gonna be a sliding scale...

Hey so bringing it back to what you said about CC/CV, this guy below argues the case against CC/CV quite reasonably.

Now despite the language of it saying step down... it is also step-up (i.e. can work like a boost converter as well?) ?

My plan is to buy one these and use it charge all my lipo and li-ion packs thru the BMS's charge port wiring (using 2.1mm DC female and male jacks).  I have a couple of 10s and some 12s so I think this will solve all my needs. Also, it avoids me from buying that stupidly expensive $60 power brick.

Ahh poop.. I think ordered the wrong one.. lol.. I can change quickly before they ship -- I think I need a boost up converter because 10s and 12s batteries will require 37V and 44.4V respectively.

I have those... no good though.  They are only at 12V or 24V (two in parallel).  The problem is that one needs between 37-44V to charge 10s or 12s batteries via BMS.

One could perhaps take one of those PSU's you linked and put it thru a step-up boost converter... see below... but the problem is the amps might destroy the boost converter... it's not rated to handle 75amps.

Dude let me know how your project goes... I have one of those 12V 75A power supply... also a 24V 60A.  These are remnants from days of refusing to go the BMS route. So I have a 12S RC balance charger.  Kind want to get back to just plug and play tech.

I see @scepterr idea with a lab bench power supply (60V) feeding his step-down its cool BUT since I already have parts... I kind of want to see if your cutoff regulator works. I mean it should... but I think that thing will get blistering hot.

It is pretty crowded in mine, there is no way I could fit all of this stuff in any smaller one. But I wanted full voltage range and the AC-60V PSU is huge, much larger than lower voltage ones.

As for enclosure, search "HF-1-9 ABS Plastic Enclosure" on eBay. 

Also, different 60V PSU have slightly different dimensions. I feel like I calculated mine to be right on the edge, again, not sure if larger one would fit. This is the [link to mine](https://www.ebay.com/itm/350W-60V-5-8A-Single-Output-Switching-power-supply/222240244786).

Obviously, the mounting holes of the enclosure don't mach the holes in the PSU so I mounted the PSU on the piece of plexiglass with some countersunk bolts and then mounted it all on the enclosure.
Using ferrules or crimp connectors will make your life WAY easier when connecting all the sh*t together on a project like this. And silicone wire, nothing else comes close. Cut, crimp connect, done. Seriously, once I figured out the layout, it was all done in 10 minutes.
For the bullet connectors, I advise you to use [this type](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Dual-4mm-Banana-Plug-Jack-Socket-Binding-Post-for-Speaker-Amplifier-Terminal/32841932764.html). Or use the same spacing, think it's 19mm. It's the spacing between the EU 2pin plug which you can then use to plug into the output :)

in the article you linked above from endless-sphere he tells how the ideal charging curve for litihium is with more current at low soc tapering as it gets to full and that this is what a plain psu with constant voltage puts out anyway. 
and trickle charging is still vague as to how and when it's dangerous.

 The remote thing is awesome in its own way but it still seems a bare psu will not in any way be more damaging to cells.  Is this true?

Yes it's a 24V Power Supply but it's only my lab bench PSU not for charging any batteries. My charger for my board uses another 24V PSU, cause it was from when my board was 6S, and a LED Driver step up to charge my 12S. The nice thing about the LED Driver is it's a boost and a constant current module, though it's only rated for about 250W and it gets quite hot even with a heatsink and fan. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/0/307c6ddc5731b6cdec75b590b3082cb9d2c22ad6.jpg" width="282" height="500">

I'm fairly convinced that LED driver PSUs with adjustable voltage are more appropriate for bulk charging our big packs, but need to put this to the test.

@hummie I love and hate your rabbit hole tangents. :) But I think this might help people, and someone can shout me down if I'm full of shit :)

[quote="Hummie, post:97, topic:36797"]it still seems a bare psu will not in any way be more damaging to cells.  Is this true?
[/quote]

Okay, I'm still putting this together in my mind, but I think there are a few categories of power supplies.

1. vanilla normal power supply -- will supply around the voltage specified, will vary with load, and will be able to supply specified voltage until the wattage is exceeded, at which point it will brown out, then pop a breaker or burn out or catch fire. Similar to how battery packs behave.

2. regulated power supply -- will attempt to hold the voltage more accurately but otherwise similar behavior as #1. If your load exceeds the wattage limits, will brown out, then pop.

3. CC/CV power supply -- the CC acts as a current limiter (cap on the max), the CV acts as a voltage limiter (cap on the max). Since it limits the output, you can put as big a load as you want on it. The PSU will limit current to the max and voltage will drop proportionate to the load.

So your questions/thoughts about PSUs need to be against one of above. And all of above can have different behaviors as to voltage/current spikes at turn on, dirty output, etc.

For example, the flashlight nuts charge single cell 18650 usually in 4 channel chargers. Reviewers will graph the output to make sure voltage doesn't spike, remains 4.20v or under, has a more-or-less CC/CV shape, and terminates charge when full. Many many chargers fail this test. A lot of chargers go to 4.25 or above.

As for your question about bare PSUs harming cells, I would think you'd have to graph the output while charging a pack, to answer the question. Likely no, but it's quite possible the voltage overshoots, perhaps just for an instant, perhaps more.

Haha HLG-240H seem like the sweet spot in price/power/features.

http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/260/HLG-240H-SPEC-805975.pdf

Short version, the ones that end with "A" are adjustable. "-42A" is adjustable 39-45, with CC holding up until 42v. Great for 10s.

"-48A" is 44.8-51.2V with CC holding up to 48v, looking good for 12s, or for 10s or lower, dropping with one of those DPS units.

Boosting 12v to 50v at 250w is not supposed to be cheap. I don't think any of the $30-50 boost things will hold up. Youtube reviews indicate most of them have poor regulation or are in some other way crap.

I think it's a better strategy to get 4-5 computer PSUs and wire them in series (after lifting the DC ground on 3 of them). I've actually done this, sweet! HP DPS-1200FB is the best value. But even at $20/psu, this adds up. It'll be cheaper/safer to just get a 60v PSU.

The "why" for the meanwell led driver:

- good brand, likely to work as specified, likely to last
- adjustable current
- adjustable voltage
- robust build
- weatherproof
- actual CC/CV

I like the PSU you linked, and I bought one. I don't see any wording that it's a CC/CV supply, so I think it's simply an adjustable voltage PSU. We'd be quite lucly if there's a current limiting circuit in there.

Here's the difference between regulated voltage vs constant current. If your load wants to pull 200 amps, the non-CC PSU will try to supply it, and either pop a breaker or burn itself out. 

The CC PSU will limit the current to what it's set at (and voltage will drop to obey ohm's law).

If you plug a pack into a non-CC PSU, the thing that's limiting the current is the internal resistance of the pack and all the wiring and connectors. If this resistance is low, it's gonna pull hella lot of current. Analogy: connect an empty 18560 cell to a full cell in parallel.

On the other hand the CC PSU will keep things in a sane range. If you direct short the outputs of a CC PSU, you should see the voltage drop to just about zero and the current will max out to whatever it is set to.

You can try to satisfy yourself by actually measuring voltage and current when you hook up that PSU you linked to a mostly discharged pack. Get one of those volt/amp/watt meters and put it inline. Maybe a 200amp one to make sure it doesn't blow up.

We need to really prove this. I mean if they work decently and not going from 12V to 50V but maybe something more tenable like 24V to 55V then we can get past this 5A charging and get to maybe 15A.

Okay, a few things going on.

4.2 * 12v * 15a == 756watt. So you need a bigger PSU.

15a is starting to be a lot of current. Need somewhat beefy wires and good connectors, otherwise you'll have a decent voltage drop, and potential melt/fire issues.

The DPS5020 is supposedly 50v 20a, but it's really a lot of power! Dave at EEVblog managed to blow his up:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2rvAoO-MIA

(EDIT the psu is not unsafe! But perhaps it's good to check it over before putting max power through it)

Most of what I know is what I've read and not what I've done, but buck is supposedly way more efficient than boost.

My guess would be that DROK boost will be either badly regulated, not deliver full power, or blow up quickly under full power without adding a bunch of heat sinks, etc.

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=drok+boost+900w

There might be a good model out there, or one that was put together nicely that can take a beating. But I'd be wary of putting hundreds of watts though those things. The DPS buck PSUs seem to have fairly consistent quality and good basic design (from what I've read/watched).

I'd say you're better off getting Hummie's 60v PSU and the DPS5020. Settle for about 8 amps. At least I haven't found a cheap way to do better.

But the point I was actually trying to make was that if you watch the video, it's a LOT of power! So any little thing goes wrong, poof or BOOM!

And these random china designed/built poorly QC'ed not UL-tested electronics mostly do not perform to spec and often fail, sometimes terribly, so the onus is on us to test and be careful.

For sure! Always know the limits and expect anything.

I just wanted to make sure the video wasn't taken out of context for a casual reader. Dave's vids are loooong :)

Also, the reaction speed of the maker of the module shows that he cares and continues to improve the design. It's a rarity for manufacturers in China.

  I'm just confused why people bother with these drok things which being a buck down or boost up are more inefficient than pwm and you can get the adjustability from 0-60 for cheap in the psu we have.   CC seems a waste of time unless you have cells that are made for a laptop or something and there's no problem charging at around double if not triple the rate of what people typically do.  its said they will last longer.but its not a safety thing and within the manufacturers stated fast charge rate, and I've also found many recent studies/articles stating that the charge rate isn't what damages a cell and just the voltage it's put to and if it gets hot.

I'll grant you that was an old article and trickle charging is no good at full capacity of a cell according to everywhere else, the details of what that means lets forget but does the drok even have an auto shut off when its at the end of a charge and just trickling anyway? 

the psu we both have I think we could define as a constant voltage in that you set it to a voltage and it stays charging at that voltage and brings the battery up to it.
  I've hooked up different very low batteries to different psu all of which are hooked up with a wattmeter too so I can see the current and voltage.  In this low battery situation with usual CV psu such as linked they most often will stutter and do an on-off of current until the voltage is lowered manually or they very slowly bring the battery up (meanwell), or if they're cheap they just try to do a higher amperage then they're stated to do get hot and blow((cheapo that they sent a higher rated replacemen and no problem), or they limit themselves to around the stated amperage somehow, not following ohm's law, and that seems the norm so in a way they're current limited in that it wont go much over 8 amps.

[/quote]

CC is not really constant current. It's current limiting. So it really really is a safety thing, and required. Mucho danger to connect a high discharge battery pack (low internal resistance) to a PSU without something that limits current. Rates will not be triple, but potentially hundreds of amps, like connecting a dead lipo to a full lipo. Granted, the PSU will likely pop a fuse or something first.

I don't think it's responsible to say your 60v 8a adjustable voltage (non constant current) psu is safe to hook up to packs, without having done a bunch of testing to verify.

[quote="Hummie, post:136, topic:36797"]

[/quote]

I'm thinking most people use these to feed BMS? And depend on BMS to cut the charge when full.

And I've been reading and thinking about this. I don't think it's the BMS's job to terminate charge. Charge termination is different from over voltage protection... Still thinking and learning about this one.

This behavior is critical, in contrast to your "get hot and blow" behavior, and needs to be verified. I'd say this type of supply is constant current.

```

because of maybe what youre calling drift, with fluctuations of current flowing off and on, when it's set to too high a voltage for the pack, that is what makes the one with the knob above rock to me.  These things are the most un-user friendly electronics sold and every one I got including meanwell came in a bare box with no instructions and no plug or wires for the needed 3 prong plug.  You have to salvage one off a microwave or something.  the thing is a puzzle and the final figuring for me was how turning the tiny screw pot was the voltage adjustment, and the sound it made whining on and off meant it was set too high a voltage for a dead pack, but it would charge very slowly still, whining slower as it brought the pack up, but better to just lower the set voltage.  But I do have one that I don't have to adjust ever, its a higher wattage I forget what now.    
I haven't got the linked one with the led and knob even running yet but wondering if the led voltage screen show the pack voltage as it climbs similar to my wired in wattmeter.  if so thing does it all 55 bucks.  Or what doesn't it do? I don't want CC I want as much current as I can get and charge faster and within the cell's specs still.  Ripple and noise I never hear about but

You might be right... I have the $37 60V 5A one off of Amazon linked on this thread. It has the plastic knob. If I push and turn it... it sometimes changes the voltage. I say sometimes because I turn it a few times and it doesn't work consistently.

As I recall, there is a difference between power supply and battery charger. Power supply only provide constant voltage while battery charger provide range of voltages depending on the battery voltage. Say if you have 48v battery, you need to charge with 50v and battery charger does this automatically for you. Currently I am not sure my self why it's recommended to use battery charger instead of psu and I do hope someone could explained it well.

It's all about cc/ cv. Power supply won't cut off and will over charge. Kaboom fire . A charger will trickle it's power as it nears the end voltage of being fully charged and will then cut off. No kaboom fire. What's nice about a drok controller is you get to set the end cutoff voltage to whatever you want and add much more cycle life's to your cells by stopping at 98% instead of 100% full charge.

pcu get a bad rap that's unwarranted and it wont blow up your battery.  the big  differences are it isn't a current limiting and just a constant voltage and relies fully on ohm's law to determine the current that will flow to the battery.    that's almost never a problem unless its a very high amp pcu capable of putting out more than your batty can handle.   I'd rather charge at 8 or 12 amps anyway and within the specs of the cells I use.   Lipo and even other high discharge lithium chemistry have a high max charge rate you shouldn't go over but it's almost always within what the pcu would do anyway.  the other main feature of a charger which a pcu doesn't have is it will shut off when it gets close to full charge and with a pcu there's just a small current flowing continually as it gets close to the set voltage and it never gets there (the charger never gets there either but just shuts off when close).   this isn't a problem unless the trickling is happening at full full charge and that's just because the battery is being held at it's peak where it does the most damage and not anything else.  If you set your pcu to 4.1 volts and have the battery sit on that all day the battery will be around 4.095 all day and that's fine.
there could be other safety features on a charger but these are the main differences between a pcu and a charger.

And (exciting maybe) a buck/boost version of the 50v 5a. Which would let us use like a 48v psu for everything, maybe. 24v would work but probably heat up something fierce.

I know hobby chargers have this buck-boost transition thing, where if the pack voltage is close to the PSU voltage, charger keeps flipping back and forth between buck and boost modes, considerably slowing down the charge. Likely the DPH unit will have similar behavior.

Perhaps instead consider getting a charger with the voltage adjust pot, or a mean well LED driver with adjustable voltage (example HLG-320H-54A for 12s) and maybe inline one of those volt/amp/watt meters.

My setup includes a few things. Depending on how DIY you want to go or how much $$$ you want to spend. 

The stupid expensive stuff:
BK Precision 9117 Power Supply (3kW/80V/120A)
TI BMS (6-16S BMS with comms)
I use these as a combo to charge large batteries. The setup is roughly 5K and way overkill for anything in here but it's really neat cause I can control both of them through a computer and record everything, from individual cell voltages, current going in, which cells are balancing, voltage output. 

The expensive hobby stuff:
iCharger Duo 4010 (2200W 2 channel 10S balance charger)
This is my endgame charger of choice. It can output 1300W per channel and 2200W total. It also has comms and some rc people have even coded a raspberry pi and phone app to control the charger which is pretty cool. 
For its power supply I made a 36V 2250W power supply out of 3 12V power supplies. Cost like $60 total. 

The Cheap stuff:
Adjustable power supply from my group buy a year ago. I believe I have a 12S and a 10S version sitting somewhere. 
BMS from Bestech BMS, I choose a different build than what is commonly used here. The variant I use has the lvc at 2.5V and the hvc at 4.25V. The reason is that the BMS should be your last point of protection and you should really never hit these. It starts balancing at 4.0V so there isn't an issue there. 

The DIY stuff:
60V power supply that can do 2kW out of server power supplies.
6-16S BMS with comms: I built my own version of the same TI BMS I bought for around $100. It was very time consuming and I would probably never do it again
I'm planning on making a smaller 10S BMS with comms based on a different TI chip with onboard logging. It should end up being roughly the size of a 4.12 VESC. 

I have had some interest in getting a drok but the limited current output is a dealbreaker for me. 

My endgame setup is the rc balance charger offboard. Then onboard a small protection board that doesn't do any balancing, mainly ov/uv/oc protection and cell voltage monitoring with a way to access the logs through Bluetooth. 

---
I'm not going to comment on anyone elses setup as I think a lot of it is irresponsible...

In my opinion no board should go without a discharge BMS and fuse, reason being that just because your cells are balanced fully charged it does not mean they are balanced in a partially charged state.

For example, this battery was perfectly balanced before this discharge cycle and when I charged it back up after the cycle it was still perfectly balanced. I wish I had logged the data from the charge cycles but you get the point. This was a battery that is rated to over 130A and for this test I was pulling 17.5A at the peak. I was testing to see what the health was after some extremely abusive tests.

![image|690x388](upload://zmANg0nvAFbZJs19Knk5PdLIdKo.png)

I did record the end bit of the charge cycle after this test ***with balancing disabled***

![image|690x388](upload://jPFWG1VLTJ6AKpUrvxjhRi2xaV5.png)

As you can see, the cells are balanced within 3mV, so you would never be able to tell that there is something wrong with this battery.

Also, this battery pack was built using genuine cells that have been tested thoroughly. This is not a "you got a bad cell in that pack" scenario. This is the result of a dozen or so abusive tests that I ran on it. It exposed the weaker cells in the pack and the same could happen to anybody's battery in here without you even knowing.

The only way to protect against it is to set conservative voltage limits. I would set the voltage limit on the pack at 30V which is right around where the lowest voltage cell hits the 2.9V mark.

But do you have any tips on better, cheaper or faster charging instead of our standard cell - bms - laptopbrick?

Like a special Drok to the BMS or something like that?

faster would mean you want more amps so there's no point in getting current control unless you have a veeeery powerful charger.

was just watching this guy telling about charging his cells:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBf_qXEYUoM

he tells how he has no bms and no idea how far his cells has drifted for 2 years in his VW bus and checks them in this episode!   some people are safer than others and some people have a youtube channel.  he's an example of needing the cc feature of a true lithium charger because his charger is so powerful it would put out more than his cells could take when first put on the charger.

This is why I suggested to @SimosMCmuffin that a BMS have a tiny discharge circuit, even if it's 500mA, and even if we're running in bypass.  You could use the discharge signal as a logic high/low to the ESC, and when the BMS cuts the discharge the ESC could do a proper cutoff as well.  Except just don't yank the carpet out from under it (by cutting power with the BMS) and disable brakes in the process.  I'd rather destroy a battery than my body.

Look at the first graph. The cells go out of balance as they discharge. The second graph is from the end of the charge cycle immediately after. The cells are still balanced fully charged but not at all when being discharged. Pros of having a discharge BMS and being able to monitor cells while they discharge.

Bottom balancing instead of top balancing could mitigate this somewhat, as you can get the high voltage alarm while you're charging, rather than a silent low voltage while riding.

But as usual, the only real way to protect against bad cells is to monitor what's going on.

And to amplify what you say, all (well, most) packs start healthy, but as they wear out, cells start acting wonky.

[/quote]

In other words, as cells degrade, they lose capacity. The way this manifests in packs is, one cell will go rapidly higher in voltage as you charge and the cell gets full, and/or rapidly down in voltage during discharge when that cell is depleted.

If you top balanced, cells will look even when full, but the bad cell will drop off in voltage more quickly during discharge.

If you bottom balanced, the cells will be even when empty, but during charge the bad cell will go high voltage sooner.

2.87 to 2.73 is the voltage spread at discharge.  not great but not that bad and typically the spread at the bottom is where they spread.  the simple cheap solution for me would be setting the pack low voltage cut off a bit higher and I'd just keep going with the cells and see how it does and feel if it's warm.

Are you talking about the first graph? The blue line dips off the graph, which cuts off at 2.5v. That cell is toast! If you're top balancing and have no bms for discharge, you'd never catch this unless you're checking cells after discharge. Well, at some point the pack will blow up or start sagging horribly or BMS won't allow you to charge I suppose...

think it is a cell and the blue line on top of the graph is power.  a toasted cell. 

  I still feel safe with just the lv cut off and having it set high, checking the cells individually with a discharge balancer, and bulk charging.   just saying.  you guys are all into the bms.  I know of another pack ruined over the weekend by another faulty bms.  they seem more trouble than they're worth to me at this point.   and the common cheaper ones all work while charging,...how would that play out if they cell realllly sucks and the balance discharge function only dissipates a fraction of an amp and you were to hook it up to a high power charger?  It seems like it could result in having a bms, and feeling safe, yet not knowing your dud cell is so bad that the bms cant burn off its power as fast as it's being charged and the cell could still be going way beyond 4.2.  No?   seems with a typical low discharge bms you cant do a fast charge safely unless you know for sure what your cells are at.

@Hummie @deucesdown
The line that dips is a cell. 
The blue line at the very top is power. This was a constant power discharge, which is why the current increases as voltage drops. 

I have a protection circuit which limits power when any cell hits 2.5V so as the low cell hits the 2.5V mark, power is decreased in order to keep that cell at 2.5V. That is why the end of the graph shows current and power going down fast, because a higher load would sag that specific cell under my 2.5V limit.

A BMS monitors all cells and if any cell goes past the LVC/HVC then power is cut off. That is one of the most important features of a BMS. Even the cheapo BMSs should have this feature; that said, the only cheap BMS I use are Bestech BMS

FlexiBMS will allow load to push current into battery even if discharge FETs are turned off. Current can go from load towards source through the body diodes.

You mean to have a brake resistor and then connect the enable signal from that to the VESC? I am adding the CAN-bus in the next iteration, so we can communicate with the VESC directly.

If the discharge power has been cut, the ESC's MCU has shut down and can't turn the brakes on.  Did you think of a way to mitigate that?  Because otherwise, that's awesome

Running in bypass means routing the discharge wires around the BMS from battery to ESC.  Exactly the thing @PXSS suggests not to do, and for good reason, but there are problems to be solved before this can stop

The ESC's MCU should stay powered if it's not driving/accelerating the motor and the motor is spinning,which will generate enough BEMF voltage for the DC bus to keep the MCU powered. Regen braking will push more current back to the DC bus and raise the voltage, so regen brake should keep the VESC on, until the speed has dropped quite a lot.

I guess it could be possible to share the 3V3 and GND from the CAN connector on the BMS to the VESC's CAN connector, but that might break something if there is any DC offset between the BMS and VESC.

lucky golden knob
[/quote]

Hey @Hummie I bought that PSU (60v 8a gold knob) a while ago, to use it to feed one of those DPS6005 power supplies, or a hobby charger. I'm now trying to charge my 15s pack to 54v, and was looking around on amazon.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BJG4S9M/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_8?smid=A1PFERN1VLNL35&psc=1

Looks the same as the LM YN one. One of the reviews says:
[quote]
Limits itself to 8.3A and keeps running at that, as opposed to cutting out
[/quote]

Hmm sounds like current limit aka CC at 8.3a? I have XLR for charge port, so I can easily handle 8.3a...

I have a cheap electronic load that can do 60v 10a to max of 150w. This type of thing:

https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20181108205316&SearchText=150w+load

(If you buy, be careful, there are subtle differences, and fakes of the good one lol)

So I put the load on the PSU, used the gold knob to dial up about 12v, and kept dialing up the current up on the load. Started at 3a, went up .1a at a time. Got all the way to 10a. Hmmmm, definitely didn't limit itself at 8.3a. Didn't shut itself down or pop and let out smoke either.

I can't test at more interesting voltages, as I hit the 150w ceiling. I actually have 2 different 150w electronic loads. I can hook them up in parallel but still I'm at 300w max, and the PSU is 480w.

Anyway, I was hoping the PSU would protect itself by limiting current, but at least my version (LM YN) does not do so, at least at 12v. I have no idea what would happen if I up the voltage all the way up but I suspect magic smoke.

Have you hooked yours up to a pack?

EDIT for 13s voltage the cheapest nice thing seems to be:

https://octopart.com/hlg-240h-54a-mean+well-12628885

$58-ish. It's a PSU so no termination.

https://www.amazon.com/KORAD-KA6003P-Programmable-Precision-Adjustable/dp/B00AXL7UJA
and
https://www.amazon.com/KA6005D-Precision-Variable-Adjustable-Regulated/dp/B00G0HAY3U
are also interesting but $$$. They can be serial/USB controlled, so can do termination maybe with a RPI...

My commute starts at the top of a hill so I'm always messing around with the termination voltage.
