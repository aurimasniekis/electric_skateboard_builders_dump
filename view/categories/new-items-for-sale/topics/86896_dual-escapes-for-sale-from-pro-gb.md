I have decided to sell my dual Escapes. These units have never been powered on, connected or used in any way. They've been handled delicately, admired and respected, but that's the extent of it. As such, I'm offering these as **NEW**. And because they are so special to me, I can't go below $330 + shipping. 

I know that with the stupid Unity on the market, that may be a difficult sell, but that's what they are worth to me. Otherwise, I'm **very** happy to continue Hoarding them for future non-use. Lol.

In all seriousness, these are something that I read about, dreamed about, budgeted for, and patiently waited for. But alas, I just can't build a new board, nor can I kill my focboxes which the Escapes were going to replace. ![20181017_143332|690x388](upload://kcr6UpjJIPzPHL9d7kldLkPIFnT.jpeg)

knocked $30 off after 4 hours after saying the price is firm.

By my calculations about $335 was the price including shipping at the time.

The Vesc6 platform is the only way plug and play with AS5047 encoders.

Those SD guys are all over this forum. Why you haven't meet yet? There are more renown SD builders and manufacturers altogether in this forum per square mile than members from any other community (**KeRiMa Axis** one of them... @boardnamics, @Rithblu & @marcmt88). You should gather one day boys. What a pack!
