everything is on the link; the group buy is managed directly on it. I could, but you need to buy ... 20 at least otherwise they will cost you A LOT !

For those who want to get a mount+pulley combo, I will add and drop for FREE in the package a NOLOGO switchblade riser pad. That's a 20 euros gift :slight_smile:
