Hello fellow e-skaters, my name is Luis and I'm based in Los Angeles, CA. Im selling 15mm pulleys which are great when you need the most torque transfer. I purchased these pulleys in bulk to sell at a reasonable price to the community. I had to buys lots of pulleys to meet MOQ. I don't plan to make profit on this, but I'm selling at this price to hopefully recoup my money. If I get close to breaking even I plan to sell at even lower price.

The motor pulley is 15mm ht5 15t steel pulley with 8mm bore and 3mm keyway. It comes with two set screws and 3mm key included for each pulley.

The wheel pulley is 40t for abec 11 flywheels and MBS all terrain 100mm wheels. Construction isaluminum with m5 threads that allow the six screws to install perfectly in the flywheel core which makes installation a breeze and has good allignment everytime.

Nice, will need to consider those 40T wheel pulleys looks great. 

Also, this is for a summer build with CRonins.  What did you use for mounts in your pics?  I need to figure out an option that works there, but don't have skillz to DIY mount. 

Thanks!

And they spin great to. I'll upload video soon

For mounts I used the @whitepony method of using epoxy. I like this method so much I'm working on a mini with 150mm Ronin's with steel tube this time. It's pretty simple and allignment is better than it was on caliber trucks originally. PM if you need more details.

Yes alignment with your motor mount method is so good I'm surprised more people arent doing it, it's so simple. Speaking of alignment here's video of wheel pulley spinning https://youtu.be/zF24CNMwmGE

Changed pricing to be more international friendly. If you want to order a couple of pulleys for yourself or a group buy I can go lower in price.

@whitepony I need to go to post office to confirm but I see $12.60 option for first class international and motor pulleys are small so I can fit many.

@caustin I'm in Los Angeles, CA. Motor pulleys are ready to ship but I will get the screws for wheel pulleys hopefully next week.

I'm interested. However I'd like to fit them in MBS 100mm wheel, they are a little bit different than the ABEC 11.

Do you know if they'll fit?

If, so I'll but two sets of 15/40T with keyways and bolts, let me know if you will ship to Lima Peru

Thank @caustin, a test fit on your side would be awesome. I also got 3D printed pulleys from @idea, they fit perfectly on ABEC 11 flywheels but not on MBS wheels, I had to use ABEC 11 on the back and MBS on the front for now.

hey luis, thx so much for the lifetime supply of motor pulleys, they are simply perfect!

one would think its easy to make the right pulley, but somehow noone got it right! steel instead of aluminium, teeth over whole width instead of this extra grub screw cylinder part that never fits anywhere in our setups,  2x grub screws hidden between teeth, finally a key AND its black = all thumbs up! :heart_eyes:

The bolt pattern is different for kegels and 40t pulleys are best used on abec wheels 90mm and larger anyway

But you could use 15mm instead - won¬¥t be much different.

[/quote]

I have Caliber II trucks with 6355 dual motors and @Titoxd10001 motor and wheel pulleys with 265mm belts on 97 Abec 11s. You are are good to go. 

@Titoxd10001 please make some 36T or 38T pulleys, I need more speed! The 15/40T combo has a good torque but max speed could be a tad higher. 

I'm not sure if I could change the vesc settings to increase speed somehow.

Awesome!  Just sent payment, you should have my address on the Pay Pal payment.  DM me if you don't.  Thanks so much for making this available to the community!  I'm real excited as I've upgraded wheels several times from 83 to 90 to 97 and now finally to 100 mm MBS wheels.  I've noticed that at 97 and 100 upgrade my 16/36T motor/wheel pulley ratio seems to be a bit lagging and at the same time I'm at on a mono drive so the motor seems a bit warmer than when I was on 83 or 90.  So, with that said, this 40T pulley should take some stress off the motor.  Again, appreciate you bulk buying for the community! :blush:

Hey, yeah MBS wheels are my favorite wheels so far. They just carry so much momentum and they just roll over everything. Not really for full off road, but I still pass through some dirt trails and over peoples lawn when sidewalk has really bad cracks. You should definitely notice a difference in going to lower gearing and your motor won't suffer as much as well as your batteries.

The option to pay as "Friends and family" is not open for paypal in my country, so I'll add the fee (3%) to the payment if you don't mind.
So three sets + shipping = (20*3+15)*1.03 = 78$

@yinnon:
Motor pulleys are about 55grams
Wheel pulley are about 140grams 

3*140+3*55 is 585 grams.
Sadly that increases shipping rates. Up to 500 grams tracked is 15.5 euro and up to 1000 grams is 20 euro.

We could probably sneak it away with 500 grams since I book and print the shipping label online. That way a clerk won't weigh and create shipping label for it at the post office.

## If you are in EU and want pulleys - read this first!
@Titoxd10001 is sending me a box of pulleys for distribution in EU. The shipment hasn't arrived yet and when it does, there will be a new separate thread for it. Please be patient.

One guy in Germany already sent money to @Titoxd10001 and we don't know who it is on the forum so please step forward so we can resolve it.

There can still be some slight adjustments in pricing due to customs and import taxes so **don't send any more money.** We won't know until the box with pulleys has arrived at my house.   

Any profits from this will be reinvested to benefit the community in the best way possible.

Thanks.

@Titoxd10001
 Hey!
 Does theese require the 97 or 100mm wheels or would they fit on 80 - 83 mm flywheels?
```

## \#165 Posted by: Titoxd10001 Posted at: 2017-04-23T16:59:37.971Z Reads: 176

There are people using them with 83mm flywheels, but I would say 90mm is as small as I would go. The radius of a 40t pulley is about 3mm more than a 36t.
```

Ah bummer :/ 
 Yeah +3mm radius is huge for the 83mm wheels considering the size of the 36T.

Thanks for the reply !

They're alluminum. I'm considering getting 36t, but that would take 2-3months for delivery and I would probably have to take pre orders to fund it.

Received a couple of sets today. 
They look awesome. If I could give some feedback it could be an idea to wrap the big pulleys with something inside the Jiffy bag. On a long journey they may get damaged which would be a shame as they are really nice. Mine had a little dink in the flange but it's the right way to not affect the running of these.
Just need to source some big wheels now.....

He only has the wheel pulley - you'll need to find your own motor pulley.

Thanks. Only have a handful left of 40t wheel pulleys. Decided to keep these for US only because customs and shipping is to high for international.

It's crazy looking back because first few months I thought my investment was a big loss but now I've pretty much sold all 250 sets.

I think I finally want these. So if I read it right. It would be around $32 for two wheel pulleys? I'm located in the US. Portland Oregon.

I'm in for 2 to NYC :slight_smile: 

40/16 vs 36/16 = more torque right?

Yeah that's correct. That's for first class, $2 extra for priority shipping.

The plan was to get more, but not sure anymore. It just takes to long for delivery. I would say it took 6 months to break even on a pretty big investment. Wanted to change some things on the wheel pulley and then find factory with relatively low moq and quick delivery. But no one wants to share their manufacturer and don't really have the funds to risk

For MOQ you can't mix sizes?

Thanks @Titoxd10001! Got the pulleys yesterday. Really fast shipping and the look great.  Can't wait to use them. 

One problem I didn't even think about. What size belt do I need to be able to use these? I've been using 9mm 265 htd belts on my 36/16 setup and the don't fit with these. And where do all you guys get your belts? 

Thanks again dude! Perfect sale!

Thank you guys for the feedback!

I did the math and went ahead and ordered the calibers for $30 flat. Any advice for a affordable wheelsetup I can use? I still have not bought any pulleys, I want to go with an affordable setup and then upgrade later $70 for wheels is above my budget at the moment.

You can use this to find out https://www.bbman.com/belt-length-calculator/

Looks like you can use 275. Double check. You can find belts on eBay and v belt guys. Might have two extra 275 15mm wide

Hey there,

Do you have any pulleys left for the 100mm wheels. i dont mind with or without flanges. if you do, is the bore wide enough to fit on caliber trucks. Cheers
