Got a charger for sale, I ordered these to be sold with my batteries but I ended up ordering the wrong plug type

I believe an Australian plug, but it can be easily replaced for a standard european one for 2$ and 15 min of work or you can just get an adapter
If you wish I can install an EU plug to it

The output plug is 5.5 x 2.1 
Input plug included

Want 35 eur shipped
