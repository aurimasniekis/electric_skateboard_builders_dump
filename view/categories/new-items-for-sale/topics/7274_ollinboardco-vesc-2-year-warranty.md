Any update on when v6 is likely to start becoming available? Pretty keen on upgrading to a dual motor system but I miss FOC mode so I'm tempted to wait :p

I just received my Ollin VESC (with all the delicious heat sinky goodness) and I will vouch for @chaka statement 100%. Build quality is top notch! Pro job indeed! I'm more than satisfied.

Unfortunately, I can't speak to the function yet as I'm still waiting for a Space Cell Pro 3... but that is another sad, sad, frustrating story.

Keep it up OBC! Fantastic product and customer service! I'm looking forward to V6 as well.

In the same state @Goombaacez84 but it's been 3 weeks for me but I can't wait, I've heard great reviews about Ollin products so I'd say it's worth the wait.  Would be nice if all my battery supplies decided to arrive soon too though.

Got my VESC 2 days ago. Well worth the wait since I had no issues with it so far! As of now, I rode my board for about 3 miles which was all testing.

That's a killer warranty, and it sounds a lot like mine. At the moment i'm doing 90 days no questions asked and i cover parts labor and shipping, then after the 90 days (or if they get in there and monky with it) i cover shipping and labor but not parts. 

Everyone should strive to provide this level of service in my opinion. Good on you for setting the bar so high for the rest of us. This is the way it should be.

It will be coming later tonight. Had to rework a few units from the last batch due to some odd behavior during testing. I would lose sleep if I sent something out that wasn't right. I wont leave the shop till they are finished.

The Conformal coating we apply to our VESC's has I florescent pigment to allow for better QC under a black light while applying the protective spray. Just one of the many steps we take to insure a quality product.

The uv pigment allows us to see if we missed any areas while coating the vesc. This is especially important if you live near the beach or in the midwest where they salt the roads.

By the way we are bringing our cnc mill online this weekend, we may do something special for your quad VESC build if get it configured in time!

haha, that's awesome. I wish I could take a week off of school and come see your cnc machine in action. Any chance you could post some more videos/pictures of what you work with in general? I'd love to see some of the things you do like making the vesc heatsinks for example.

Up until now we have been chopping 40mm heat sinks down to size and drilling a tapping by hand. Our router table is for our decks only.

Over the past year we have had great success manufacturing the VESC ourselves. We discovered early on that the VESC was actually a very reliable and well designed motor controller and did not deserve it's original reputation of being failure prone. In fact we have experienced less than 1% failure rate among our customers, this includes failures from abuse and incorrect installation. Given the VESC's reliability we have decided to increase our industry leading warranty, our customers are now covered for two years. http://www.ollinboardcompany.com/support

Benjamin Vedder has proven to be an exceptional designer and engineer. We will continue to send him support for his work and build his designs to the level and quality we have become known for.

Your quality speaks for itself but this is an amazing gesture, thanks. Is this effective as today and onward or will this be retroactive for purchases within the last two years? For example I purchased mine in July of this year so would I then have until july of 2018 then?

Yes, this is retroactive. Plus, you can still get very low cost repairs or replacement beyond 2 years!

I just purchased 2 new Ollin VESC/s from another builder on here.  Will the warranty transfer?

So basically buying Chakas vesc is better than the new Vesc X from Enertion. Slightly cheaper too. 

I'm sold. I've had enough of this DIY 12S ESC.

hey @chaka, I'm sure many people asked you already but do you plan selling your products directly from Europe as well? 

$60 on shipping is very prohibitive ...

I wish I could ship at a lower cost but express shipping is the only method that has tracking internationally. I know @elkick sells out of Germany and provides a quality VESC with very good customer service if that is what you are looking for.

This is awesome. This likely is in response to VESC-X, I was definitely interested in VESC-X but, there is no reason why I would go to it now. When vendors have competition then it's the people that win. 

PS: I have two: VESC's  one chaka's and one torqueboards'

@chaka just fixed my VESC and it's already on it's way back to me. I think my VESC has spent more time in transit than it did under repair. Was intrigued by the X but am reconsidering and leaning more towards buying another Ollin for my second than to try the X.

@chaka I had a fatal FAULT_CODE_DRV8302 code today after all of the sudden one of my vesc's had no power. The other works fine. So I'm guessing it's done for.  

I heard you are the guy to get quality vesc's from and I'm curious about how long it takes from order to shipped? I live in the US and I really hate the thought of rolling around on one 6355 motor. Can I just replace 1 vesc? Or is is better to replace both at the same time? Let me know as I want to get rolling again ASAP. Thanks!

Hi Sean,

We are just finishing a big rush of VESC orders, can't make them fast enough this time of year. The soonest I can ship is a week from today. The good news is you don't need to buy two, wait till the other one pops before replacing it.
