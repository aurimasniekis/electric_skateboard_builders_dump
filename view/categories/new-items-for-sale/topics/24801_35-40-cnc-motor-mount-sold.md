Trucks: Caliber
Center distance: 65-75mm
Plate height: 12mm

Just curious - since the circle clamp that holds the trucks is round, will the metal that holds the motor shift/move?

Also, i'm using an MBS 100mm wheel. Will this fit?

@jaysoncena No, it doesn't move. Mount stays in place very snugly. Yes, it will fit :slight_smile:
@Maxid It would be quite complicated task because I am not using these trucks and don't have opportunity to measure the profile.

Do you still have some in stock for shipping?  Also, what 36T/15T 270mm set up do you recommend (or have on your board!)

@thisguyhere  I don't know if the adapter ring fits torqueboards trucks. But you cuold give me dimensions, so I will say
@gliz5714 Yes, stock is full. I'm running 36T/15T 270mm mono drive with sk3 192kv motor and 15mm wide pulleys. It is a good choice :+1:

got mine in the mail today, took 8 days for delivery from europe to los angeles, not bad.

these mounts are actually beautiful, especially paired against the bare metal trucks.

i can confirm the ring does NOT fit TB's 218mm caliber clones.  the hanger diameter is about 1mm larger.  suppose if you bent the ring out a bit it would...

can't wait to try these out!

i've been running this mount on a mono build for a couple months now and they're great, i think they're my favorite mounts at the moment.

if you plan on producing another round, and if i may, can i make a couple of suggestions?

one, it seems idlers are all the rage these days.  would you be able to drill an additional hole to fit a bolt that can carry an idler?

second, i wanted to outside mount but could not as the motor wires hit the motor cutout on the mount arm.  would it be possible to move the cutout towards the truck hangar by...let's say 2cm so the motor wires have some clearance?

not sure if that makes sense, i can try to illustrate it if that didn't make sense.

I also bought a set of these and I have one wired experience to share with you.

When I tight the mounts over the ring at some point they get a bit of angle through the inner portion,
it makes it really difficult to fit dual motors setup with them. I really have no idea why they're getting angled. 
I tried to tight both screws evenly however it didn't help.

I can upload pictures later if you want, or maybe you are already aware of it?
