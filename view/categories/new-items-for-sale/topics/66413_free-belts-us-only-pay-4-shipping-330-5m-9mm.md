UPDATE: Only **330-5m 9mm - 1 pair** left

Not sure how to price these. Shipping probably less than $4 to most states? but I want $4 for 2 damn it unless you feel generous of course :grin:.

I got all these belts when I was ghetto measuring mounts with tensioners, Shipping cost was way expensive so might as well order more belts

All belts are new,  5mm pitch and 12mm wide except the **330mm is 9mm wide** only two belts per person.

320-5m 12mm - 1 pair SOLD
**330-5m 9mm - 1 pair**
340-5m 12mm - 1 pair - SOLD

345-5m 12mm 2 pairs - BOTH SOLD
350-5m 12mm 2 pairs - BOTH SOLD
400-5m 12mm 2 pairs - BOTH SOLD

UPDATED Current Availability.

For a future build I haven't started yet, but using the Torqueboards v5 reverse mounts on 218 trucks with Psychotiller 6 shooters. Never enough time to build all the things I want though.
