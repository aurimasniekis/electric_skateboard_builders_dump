8 mm is way overkill , even 5.5mm can take more that enough amps.

Check the price of these motors online

TBH I am not sure they are what I'd need, my Focs use a 3.5mm connector. I could put on some 3.5mm myself but I might go for some Turnigy 149kvs

Swaping connectors on either is easy and cheap,...most builds use 190 KV .

These are perfect for a rear double !

Ask around on the forum and you will see.
