**Item location:** Sweden
**Shipping:** Buyer pays shipping. Untracked up to 500g 8eur, 250g 5eur, 100g 3eur. Tracked 2kg 15eur. Shipping to europe only.
**Prices:** If you don't like the prices thats fine, buy from your preferred dealer instead.
**Payments:** PayPal only.

## **Maytech dual hub motors 90mm/60KV + Rear truck + Front wheels**

Same as this kit, but without the front truck. 5mm bullet connectors. Only tested on the bench.

**Note:** Something weird with the hall sensor in one of the motors. I've only gotten it to work once in a couple of tries. Probably some glitch in the wires but I don't have the proper crimping tools to redo the cables so can't really tell. They are sold as is.

Both Vescs are sold.

@Mark: Maytech only sends with DHL Express and they are expensive.

I asked them and they provided me this eBay link to buy from... 

http://www.ebay.com.hk/itm/222449293697

So they are selling it for about 100$ plus 18$ shipping to Germany. So not really cheap...

I'm interested in the enclosure, is it still for sale? I've ordered the Carbon Motormount form you and I will order pulleys from @Titoxd10001. Would be nice, if it all could be send in one shipment. Can you contact me? s.pantschenko@gmx.de

Yes it is.
I'm not involved in the motor mounts more than that I created the thread for @Shogu12 and made the form.
If it's okay with him, he can send your mounts to me and I'll ship enclosure, mounts and @Titoxd10001's pulleys in the same shipment.

It's gonna be a few weeks though, since the pulleys hasn't arrived yet and the delivery of the mounts is still 3-4 weeks away.
