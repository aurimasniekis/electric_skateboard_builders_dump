Wow, that looks like a really nice kit. So, if my math is correct, it's $146 for a complete dual setup including belts and pulleys? Do you know how much shipping would cost to the US?

My friend lent me MATRIX Truck MBS, so I want to design a motorholder for MBS MATRIX Truck.

Very cool kit. Amazing to see it evolve so quick! 

Wonder if the printed couplings will pass the 'lever' test. 

lol stepping on the mounts hard enough to lift the front end up. May seem dumb but it simulates bashing the mounts on a curb or something

@Maxid
Motormounts fit for
TRAMPA INFINITY
TRAMPA VERTIGO
TRAMPA ULTIMATE
MBS MATRIX
MBS MATRIX PRO

I think I will also a version for MBS MATRIX II and II MBS MATRIX PRO :)

@barajabali
I understand your concerns, plastic ring is the weakest element, but very difficult to damage.
Motormouth is very short and rings operate small power stroke at a collision.

@jul88
You can use the chain transmission. I do not offer sprockets but motor mount is universal.

@jul88, monkey32
You can use the belt transmission 15/62 or 15/70. Motor mount is suitable for both variants.

@TarzanHBK, @barajabali, @jul88
This week I'm taking orders for a second series. There will also be several pieces on stock but only in one size.
I will give details later on priv

@monkey32
In the v1 version also can be used pulleys 70t, you must also use long belts 385mm.
In the subject  new crossbars you have info on priv.

Oh that sucks - is there a way to help? Like chip in for a truck and then get a discount once you have the mounts? I am pretty sure people would be open to that (@monkey32 @cmatson). My guess is that ultimately the interest in the carver mounts will be a lot bigger than the standard ones and that you have a chance of selling far more mounts that way. Especially considering how competitively priced you are - the trampa mounts and motors are all nice but just out-of-my-league expensive.

I´ll buy a set and have one sent to you, then when you design the build send it with my new parts you can ship it back to me?

Before we do that lets ask someone like @Kaly or @cmatson if they are the same size could make life much easier.

PM me and we can figure this out.

I'm working on a new version of the motor mounts for URBAN CARVER and STREET CARVER.
One universal motor mounts, just reverse the rings.

@monkey32 mobilized me to refresh the old design, which now adapts to URBAN CARVER and STREET CARVER.

Have you ever thought of evolving this into a direct drive version? There was a guy on a German forum that made his own direct drive with an inside ring gear to bring the motor as close to the truck as possible. 

Other than that I love where this is going. As soon as I have a budget for a urban carver I will get one of your mounts.

@Maxid
I saw the project "E-Drive MTB Gear". An excellent idea, @Nowind doing a great job.
I do not have milling machines, so my options are limited.

@Mobutusan
All versions are available, both 1.0 and 2.0, prices unchanged.
Latest 3.0 is an early concept, price is not yet determined.
Will be available in April-May. I have to do the tests.

Version 3.0 will be able to be used for:
Trampa URBAN CARVER
Trampa STREET CARVER
Trampa ATB SPRING (other rings, long crossbar)
MBS Matrix II (other rings, long crossbar)

It was not Nowind bit this guy:
http://www.elektro-skateboard.de/forum/eigenbauten-95/trampa-i-drive-6-4-a-6160.php
and I was wondering if 3D printed gears could work as well. Benefit is that with this mechanism you bring the motors even closer to the trucks than what the direct drives already do. With a slideable motormount you could then adjust for different gearing ratios and so on.

This is a universal motor mounts both for URBAN CARVER and STREET CARVER (just turn around rings).
After mounting the pneumatic wheels there is less space as the pulley spacing is reduced, so, after installing the pneumatic wheels, two 6374 motors will not fit

@Idea  Can you quote the price for all 3 styles of mounts (incl mount rings)?

I believe for the longer axle lenght (support crossbar), you might as well want a few euros more, so not sure do you have the same price for each type.

Edit:

Ok so is the price ~91-102 eur depending on crossbart material, or these are V3 mounts and prices are not determined yet?

Also - what belt lenght is needed for the current setup you use?

@Okami

Price ($75) is the same for
1. Trampa URBAN CARVER or STREET CARVER Truck
2. Trampa ATB Spring Truck
3. MBS Matrix II Truck

Price $15 for the crossbar is only when you want to buy extra crossbar.
The same applies to rings for MBS Matrix II and Trampa ATB

Distance between wheel axis and motor shaft is 77-86mm
For gear ratio 15/62 - belt length is 375mm
For gear ratio 15/70 - belt length is 400mm

I have not yet analyzed the length of the belts for other gear ratio.

Calculate the length of the belts on this page
http://www.bbman.com/belt-length-calculator/

@Mobutusan
The outer diameter of the rings is 54mm.
The distance of the holes from the wheel axle is 20mm (radius), but they are arranged asymmetrically

Looks very nice your v3 mount!
Is it possible to mount the rings in inner position for urban carver with 7" because the inner holes of my aluminium pulleys have less than 50mm.

Also i would like to know the weight of your mount.

Did you ever tried an idler pulley on one of your mounts to get more teeth in mesh and reduce resistance due to a looser belt? Compared to longboard setup the resistance of the drive train is high. But i'm new to this, switching from longboard to urban carver right now.

Thanks @rich
I can not check now because I sent "URBAN CARVER TRUCK" to monkey32.
I bought a STREET CARVER truck in Trampa, but I will have it in about a week

The weight is about 0.5 kg (Stainless steel is heavy)
 
I have not tried yet, I plan to make a version of the motor mounts equipped with a tensioner, but I do not know when, maybe in May. I miss the time for new projects.

But with the belt width of 15mm, the resistance is not so great, It seems to me to be the same as for the chain chisel.

Thanks @boardman5000 

The price will be lower
Motor mounts V3 for Street Carver and Urban Carver - $75

Cost of shipping to USA:
$18 - Post Office (standard) - sea shipping (delivery time 5-8 week)
$28 - Post Office (express) - air shipping (delivery time 1-2 week)

So the total price is - $93 or $103

I have recently made pulleys for MBS wheels, so I can now make pulleys for:
MBS Rockstar PRO,                  MBS Rockstar II           
TRAMPA SuperStar,                 TRAMPA Hypa

@Idea That looks awesome! Exactly my setup too. I'm gonna order a set from you as soon as I figure out what options I want. Is that the 62t wheel pulley with 20mm belts? Are there significant benefits to the 20mm version over the 15mm version, besides just more torque transfer? And will this mount also work with the original Matrix trucks, by swapping out the mounting rings?
```

@Mobutusan
The pulleys for MBS and Trampa are made in 62t and 70t versions.

If you drove leisurely then the 15mm straps will suffice, the narrower belts will have less friction resistance and you will have greater range.
For more aggressive driving I recommend 20mm
I do not know if you know what I mean, my English is not the best

You have an older version of the Matrix trucks?

Yes, in addition to the Matrix 2's, I have what I believe are one of the first aluminum hanger channel trucks (Matrix 0?) from MBS back from the early 2000's. It looks like they have the same hanger dimensions as the Matrix 1 trucks and similar to Trampas but with those brake mounting nubs.

Do you think your Matrix 1 rings will fit onto these hangers? Looks like I'd need them to have at least a 22 x 31mm opening to get past the brake nubs (or I could grind them off). I would like to get the extra rings and gears now to save on shipping later and have more options down the road. 

Do you think I would have any problems running 20mm pulleys with 15mm belts for right now? I also would like to leave my options open for going up to the larger 20mm belts if I find it necessary, but so far 15mm have been working fairly well for me. 

Also, do you know if adding an idler to your mounts would allow me to use 425mm belts? I already have a handful of those in 15mm and it would be nice to have one size belt for this mount and my other mounts I'm currently running. 

Sorry for all the questions, but I just get my order and options straight so I can buy it all at once and don't have to pay shipping again later. Thanks!

I can make MotorMounts for MBS Matrix older version but the rings will be with PETG.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/f/b/fbee2e397f00ebbe3815a691b85af738cd536528.jpg" width="656" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/b/bb963b601013cb3bcf1f87d00a816a64b4383c7a.jpg" width="690" height="389">

The older version truck requires making special plates because the standard ones have too small holes for the hanger, but this is not a problem.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/9/19f4f93896c25c965bcf8997e0728d29efc651bb.jpg" width="592" height="500">

In conclusion, I can make dedicated sheets metal but the rings will be made of PETG. I do not have a milling machine so the aluminum rings in 2 copies will be expensive.

There is another solution.
If you remove the brake fixing in Hanger, you can use the standard motor mounts for Trampa.
Rings for Trampa have a square hole of 22x22m

@idea Thanks for the detailed response.  if it's not too much trouble to modify the hole to accommodate both Matrix 1&2 trucks, then I'm in for that version. I'd like to not have to modify my trucks if possible, and I'd like all components to be steel or aluminum, so it would be awesome if you would be willing to coordinate with @korryh on the mounting ring. I'll pm you an order request and go from there. Thanks!

Does machine You have access to have taper compensation (I wouldn't go waterjet way if it doesn't)? With thickness like 15mm it can be a problem if the ring cutout won't be parallel to a hanger. Just my 5 cents...

I have the same trucks and @Idea motor mount. You need to cut the extension for attaching the brake, and then put longer bolts (M6x20) to try and fix the holder on the hanger. Not tried it yet so not sure it is viable on the long term. I had asked @idea if he could make attachment to fit on these trucks but he has not responded.

@JGA, @itzsiebe

Designing of motor mounts without the try on is a large risk.
I do not have such trucks, so I do not take the challenge, but I can make pulleys, you only need to specify the distance of the holes to the bolts.

There is also a short panel available.

http://www.trampaboards.com/street-carver-motor-mount-panel-made-from-3k-twill-carbon-fibre-5mm-thick--regular--p-13034.html

On the bigger pulleys I prefer some belt length to have more teeth interlocking with the small pulley. This is why we have two carbon panels (long/short). Another reason is the stiffness. Lots of people don't want a twin and need the mount being stiff and sturdy on its own.

Hey Frank, 
thanks for info but the street carver mount panel is too short for use with trampa motor with axel support bearing. I like the trampa mount, it is smart and everything makes sense, it is just the size of it.
I'll use it on e-mtb where i don't care but for urban carver i need to be "undercover". It's my daily commuter with battery enclosure underneath the deck. Here in austria it is still forbidden to ride on the pavement or bike lane which i do everyday.
So i prefer a smaller mount to be able to pretend it is non electric when police pass by, otherwise i could get massive problems.

Many people ask me about the motor mounts for MBS ATS so I ordered this truck. I will show prototype motor mounts for 2-3 weeks.

cool. Do you think you would take advantage of the holes on the ATS used for attaching the breaks? I was thinking of a clamp-on design that would hold the mount system in place. this is an 8mm threaded hole that might be useful in your design. BTW, keep in mind the standard wheels that come with the ATS.

I think it will be difficult to overcome cutting the barke attachment, which I have already done to attach the mount I have, made for spring trucks. I extended the bolts of the ring but I am not sure it will stay on very long with the vibrations. So I am interested to get a ring that fits.

I designed new side metal sheets and fixing rings for MBS Matrix and MBS ATS
The prototype is made of plastic but motor mounts  will later be made of stainless steel and aluminum.

In mountainboard better to use wider belts (20mm)

The longest crossbars I have in stock is 234 mm
They are too short.
You need 243mm for 20mm belts

I know the prices are listed somewhere, but I'm on the road. 

Looking to switch to trampa infinity trucks. Currently have 15/70T with a belt length of 400 (Width 15cm). If possible, I would like to continue using my belts and motor pulley.

What does a complete dual motor mount cost, excluding motor pulley?
Do you have a 70T alu pulley for trampa 8" AT wheels & what does it cost?

Thx

If your motor mounts have a large adjustment range,  you do not have to change the belts.

1.Price of pulleys made of aluminum:
HTD5M 72t, width 28mm (25mm belt) - 45 Euro (1 psc)
HTD5M 72t, width 23mm (20mm belt) - 45 Euro (1 psc)
HTD5M 72t, width 18mm (15mm belt) - 35 Euro (1 psc)

2.If you want to order motor mounts,  I need to know what trucks you have?

3.If this dimension is 57mm, the distance of the hole for the screw to the axis of the hub will be different than 28.5mm

@michaelcpg
it's a prototype. Not tested yet, too early for mass sales..

The price for motor mounts with a belt tensioner will be 150 Euro 
Kit with belts (20mm width) and pulleys 72t/15t made of aluminum - 280 Euro
Shipping costs to New Zealand
Shipping by post office - 50 Euro (delivery time 2-4 weeks)
Shipping by courier - 75 Euro (delivery time 7-10 days)

The motor mounts is made of high quality aircraft grade 7075 aluminum :grin: and stainless steel, so I'm not worried about the strength of the structure, but I have to test the tensioner rollers.

The new mount has the same crossbars type as the previous version, so if someone has a previous motor mounts, he will not have to order complete motor mounts, only side panels.

Hi
Ok, maybe my drawing isn't as explicit as it should be. That's because I did it on the laptop from my couch heheheh... (and not on the desktop's big screen) sorry 
The 57mm dimension refers to the diameter of the circle containing all hole centers, and not, as it seems like, de direct distance between those 2 holes. Sorry, my bad...
So, I guess if the diameter is 57mm, the radius is 28,5mm, right?

Your work is amazing, nicely done! 

I am looking for a full set for a Trampa MTB with Vertigo trucks. I like this last prototype you have with the bended crossbars. But I would not mind having less crossbars installed. 

Is it possible to install less crossbars? Will be strong enough? Or you recommend to have all four crossbars? 
Any links where I can see the mount in action?

Would you recommend the Innova Slick Cut ones if I plan to do mainly road and only some packed dirt path or nice grass riding. I saw you in a video using them before...

@Nordle

I do not have an online store yet. Now I make small series of motor mounts and belt drive for individual orders.
Gear drive for evolve trucks is still an early proototype. I have not yet added a thread on this topic.
I will create a thread when I make my first tests.

@routevoom
I make crossbars for the required length, so I can do V7.1 fixing for different trucks (MBS, Trampa, etc)
I already have the first orders for version 7.2 for Trampa ATB, so you'll be able to see photos in mid-April.

It offers 2 sizes of pulleys, 72t and 60t,
60t only for Superstar Hubs.
For the motors I have 15t pulleys

I use Polish ZABI tires, they are similar to Innova Slick Cuts, but the rubber mixture may be different.
https://www.zabi.pl/en/kolka-oferta/311//

If you drive in the city, the Innova Slick Cuts tire will be OK, but on wet grass it can be too slippery

@Eboosted
 Version 7.2 is not yet available.

@Idea would it be simple to extend the mounting tabs on the setup that @Silverline has done with the 80mm motors to allow your crossbars to be installed? I am planning on buying everything I need from you but am trying to get a list of exactly what I know I need before I start buying stuff. Also, can you do a key way slot on the motor pulley to fit on the APS motor? I think it is 3 mm wide.

I had to make an adaptor before the motors would fit in...

If the crossbars are not a problem for APS motors, I can do the motor mounts version for Alien 8072.
Such a version will not have this indentation for the motors.

From the center of your hub to the center of your hole it’s 35mm. Radius is 35mm and you have 5holes, so 360/5 is your degree they out of each other.
What else you need to know?

Hi @Idea, love your mounts. I am planning to buy Trampa mountainboard with Vertigo trucks and wonder if you have any particular motor mounts set with idlers to work with:
SK8 6374 motors (81mm wide), 23mm wide pulleys (possibly 18mm for 15mm belt), going to use with 6,5 to 8 inch pneus on superstar hubs.
I will not really use it much offroad, more like for smooth long distance traveling. (gona have 12s8p battery pack under the deck - i have enclosure from @Eboosted).

If you have something available, please write me the final price (i am from Czech Republic, Prague) for the motor mount kit/motor mount kit + wheel pulleys (66 or 72T). Some photos would be much appreciated too.

Is it still possible to buy just the mounting rings for the mountainboard infinity trucks? how much for them? Thanks, Jan

Thanks... no problem :smiley:
 
You bought my gear drive for 5065 motors, and I later designed a version for larger new 6368 140kV flipsky motors

The difference is big 
The new drive is quieter and has phenomenal acceleration ... the board also has a higher speed ... over 50km/h

Drive is loud only when accelerating, but is MUCH quieter at constant speed

@javarasta

You can, and the shipping costs depend on what you want to buy, i.e. the weight of the package

What are your trucks, hubs?
