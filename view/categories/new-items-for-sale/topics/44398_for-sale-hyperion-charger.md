Figured I'd post this again, see if anyone's in the market for a new balance charger. Asking $170 plus shipping (from Oregon USA).

---------------------------------------

Plan on selling my E-Toxx chain drive soon too if anyone's interested (drive system only). Just waiting on some parts. Not sure on price yet. Will update soon...
