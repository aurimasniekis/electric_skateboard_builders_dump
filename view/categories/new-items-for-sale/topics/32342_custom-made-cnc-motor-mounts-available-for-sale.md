Hello fellow diy’ers.  I have been working on this fully adjustable custom made CNC motor mount for quite sometimes.  It was design for caliber trucks and TorqueBaords 218mm truck with Turnigy 63xx sk3 motors.  Specs are as fallowed:

Material: 6061 Aluminum –  hefty 3/8” thick truck clamp, motor mount is 3/16” thick.
Clamping action is achieved by a full 12.3mm integrated threads into the clamp, no slippage.
Vibratory surface finishing.
15 degree of rotation between motor mount and truck clamp.
Additional 15mm lateral motor adjustment for custom fit belt (255mm to 280mm for 36T/15T).
All screws are stainless and included in the kit to fit caliber trucks (1 motor mount + 1 truck clamp + hardware).
First-run production kit price is $50 including free USA shipping.

On your particular set-up with SK3 6374 and TorqueBoard 218mm, do you have to off-set your motors or do you have enough space to place them face to face ?

Current motor mounts are designed specifically for Caliber II trucks and TorqueBoards 218mm trucks.  I can modified my cnc files to fit any style trucks and motors as long as I have access to the manufacturer specs.  I don't have an off-road wheel to test fit my current motor mounts.

Cool, I like where it's headed.

If somebody can finally make a truly `Universal Motor Mount` then I will really be happy.

I think you are headed in the right direction -- if you can make adapters for every truck.  Then you really only need I believe (2) different type of spur gears... a 36T and a 65T wheel.   

You could accommodate the entire market for motor mounts. Whereas the price of longboard mounts are reasonable... the cost of offroad/mountain board mounts are ridiculous due to... I don't know a simple lack of competition?  If you just can find those 60T - 70T spur (drive wheel? I don't know the term), it would be helpful... I know some have went to CNC mills but I never see them readily available from China.

Maybe this is a good starting point for them (not sure if they are aluminum -- but preferably they should be):

```
Synchronous belts are found in majority of electric skateboards.  They are easy to maintain, used to take up belt slack, provide positive grip that eliminates the need for high tension and elongate very little over time.  Proper tensioning is critical to system under load:  too loose of tensioning will cause the timing belt to “jump teeth”, while too tight of tensioning will possibly cause damage to the bearings and other motor components not to mention shortening its life.  When a belt is installed with a snug but not overly tight fit, longer belt life, less bearing wear and more quiet operation will result.  While idlers cause additional belt bending, resulting in fatigue, this effect is generally not significant as long as proper design procedures are followed.  To properly tension a synchronous belt, place belt on pulleys and adjust take-up and lateral motor adjustment until the belt teeth mesh securely with the pulley grooves then tighten the four screws.

@marcmt88 great design! Please note that only L3 members are allowed to create group buys through the forum.

If you'd like to sell your mounts through the forum, you'll need to link members to an external site with buyer protection (ebay or paypal...not FnF). We enforce this to protect members from new sellers that may not be able to deliver on promised goods (it happens, sadly).

Please do continue to share your progress, the world needs great resk8 mounts!

@marcmt88 it means that you need to provide buyers with a  secure method of payment, and sales must be executed outside of a  group-buy. A group-buy would be when you collect money for a product that is not yet acquired or manufactured, and then distribute the product at a later date. 

So as long as you aren't doing a group-buy, and you are offering a secure form of payment in 1:1 sales for a product that is ready to ship, carry on.

You might be able to get a bit more clearance for dual motor by using a spacer between the axle and the wheel.  This particular mount is designed to face inside under the deck and allowed it to swing up toward the deck.  With your setup I think it is as far up as the motor can go.  FYI:  the motor arm is wider than the motor housing to protect the motor from scraping the ground as you ride.

@WARMAN Nope. Dude literally just made an account today to attack Winboard, which I have already disclosed before is my manufacturer. He's claiming they're just a scam, but I along with several other companies have ordered componenents from them in the past.

Perhaps he's a shill, or perhaps he is that gullible to order from an OEM... either way, I'm more or less trying to provide facts about the nature of doing business on Alibaba.

Edit: Here's an earlier post I made on my older personal account, which covers the product I'm working on (sorry for the mini hijack). You can see the posts I made regarding my interactions with my manufacturer.

Alright.  I don't know who you are or why you joined this forum. But let me give you a short "guide" on how we go about things in this forum. 

First of all, this ain't reddit, so don't behave like it. If there is an issue with services from community members or manufacturers /resellers open a thread, make your case based on arguments, prove and context. There are many examples of such discussion on here, where poeple misused our trust annd money. Spaming in caps and acusing him of "OUT TO PROVE A POINT" is kinda funny don't you think ?

Secodlyl, so far he has been open to critique, quesrions and tried to be as transparent as possible. He immediately came out with wanted information when  I asked question about manufactureurs and parts. 

You are new here, try to get a feel for the forum and behave accordingly thank you.

PS: sorry for the derail but had to be said imao.

Thanks for coming to my defense @michichopf! The check will be in the mail :smiling_imp:. Serious note, @flint I am a huge advocate for company transparency, and I've gladly surrendered information regarding my thought process and sources. I could honestly care less about how protecting my manufacturer, as I have nothing to gain from diving in to their defense. The reason I originally replied to your post is to better educate people who think they can simply buy off Alibaba, which is not the case. It's a dangerous platform for the inexperienced, and sometimes the bitter truth has to be said.

I said the next few days I lied,I couldn't wait...it's an addiction! 
@marcmt88 so I just got them set up,unfortunately one mount seems to be machined off centre! 
They are both setup the same way on both mounts and are symmetrically lined up on the clamp but one sits slightly higher than the other!
It can't be moved any more without changing mounting harware holes to the next slots but then the mount would be at the complete wrong angle!
I have double checked everything and looking at the mount it does seem to be machined slightly off centre.
Here's a pic..

Thank you.  I see one is higher than the other.  I want to know which replacement part I need to send you to rectified the problem, the clamp or the arm?  Did you have to shave off the clamp at all to fit?  Cast trucks are know for their dimensional variability.

So I just stripped it all down and just installed the mounts on the other truck just to rule out that there slightly off,same problem but it's quite hard to tell weather it's the clamp or the arm!

If clamp is loose it might be necessary to use shim (cut up soda can) to properly line up clamp with the axle.

If the axle is not flat where the clamp is torque down you would have to use shim to compensate.

Ok been trying to figure this out and it's got me scratching my head! The mounts look slightly off but not much and it's hard to tell in the photo,you can just make it out on some of the slots!
I wanted to double check the clamps again and they align fine on the trucks,but if I take them off and line them up and look through the holes that the arms attach to they are slightly off as well.

From your explanation it appears that the clamp is probably the culprit.  Independently each set functions as it should be but aesthetically as a pair one is install slightly higher than the other.  I am pretty sure is the opening of the clamp that is off by a touch.  They might have milled from a different batch.  I am going to mill the next batch of clamps in couple days.  Will send out 2 replacement clamps instead of the arms.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

Give me a minute, just had an idea to rule out that it's the clamp...
Ok so this is the clamps with the long m4 hardware through both as it's really hard to tell trying to line them up by hand and sight... @marcmt88 thoughts they look to be perfectly lined up to me!

Isn't the problem the slots that screw into the clamp. They angle would need to change or the mount would need to be mirrored in order to match up on a dual rear setup. Just a thought

Hi, 
Just finished milling a new batch of motor mounts.  I test installed them on my TB218.  Installation was quick, easy and no modification to clamp.  Everything is aligned, sending them out tomorrow, hopefully you'll get them by Friday.

I mounted them on both front and rear trucks to rule this out.

I made one minor adjustment just so I could use my impact driver to tighten the clamp to the trucks,drilled a bigger hole,used a crosshead bolt and nut on the back! You can get them tight by hand but obviously electric tools make it easier.

Which are the motor plates for TB 218s reverse mount? What is the CTC distance, adjustable? Going to run 97mm 15/40 or 15/36 if that helps

CTC distance is ~95mm. Both motor arm and motors are adjustable.  Mount is also reversible (inside under the deck or outside on the RKP).  I have clamp specifically design to fit TB218 running 97mm wheels.

These look great and will definitlye pick a set up. I know you're working on Evolve hangars: Are you fitting these to the existing Evolve "rear" trucks,ie no clamp needed since the rears have an existing built in, or you are developing a clamp to fit on the Evolve "front" trucks, therefore I would need to get 2 identical front trucks? Would these work and/or would be able to modify for their AT wheel setup?

That's why i desided not to use Cronins, but some Bear Kodiaks. Are you able to create a clamp for those trucks as well? I can provide you all dimensions you need! That would be awesome!

Thanks for the dimension.  I can engineer a clamp for this truck.  Since I don't have the physical mount in hand I would machine the opening a bit undersized, you would have to file down to fit.  Can you also snap a picture straight on the axle with attached plate?

There is a curvature on couple sides of the hangar.  To make a more accurate clamp I would also need the dimension of the square section.  That way I can extrapolate to the curvature to get the radius dimension.

I just got my set delivered. The mounts were fine but it seems that both my Torque Boards 218mm trucks are a bit asymmetrical which caused some issues with the installation. On both my trucks, one side is about 1mm thicker than the other. The clamps fit perfectly on one side but the other required quite a bit of sanding and persuading with a heavy object to finally slide in. But once it made it past about an 1/2 inch, it slid in fine the rest of the way.

You can see the scrapes on one side:

The problem is all cast trucks have dimensional variability along the hangar.  The clamps are designed to be undersized rather than over, you would need to file down protruding nubs a tad bit to get a custom fit.

Thanks for getting back so quick.

I was looking to run 80mm Orangatang Kegels with a Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 motor.  I am going to start out with a single motor setup but envision going to duals eventually.  What is the largest motor I could fit on those trucks with your mounts in a dual setup (6354, 6364, 6374)?  

Is it best to buy both sets of mounts now (so they match) or spread it out?  Also any suggestions for pullys/belts for this setup?

With my current Paris motor mount, only 5045s motor would fit dual running side-by-side.  Any larger size motor would require a diagonal setup or one on front, the other on back truck.  If you plan on dual setup in the future, I would recommend getting two so they match.
Typical 15/36T pulleys running 80mm wheels would be 330-340mm belt length.
Hope that help.

As much I love my Kodiaks, as much I want to have a proper motor mount.
I tried to file a mount based on some basic mount. But it didn't work out well.

So I think i will go for some caliber II trucks for now. Maybe we will have the chance to borrow a Kodiak truck somewhen to create proper mount for it. I would love to see that!

Anyhow.... This is a drawing of the hanger profile

Received mine and fully respect the design. Nice work! I’m awaiting a belt of the new right length and can’t wait to try out. Although it’s 10F today, so...

Anyway, my idlers seem a little sticky when tightened enough that they don’t move in the track. In what order and on what side of the mount do you use the washers provided? I have now: head / washer / bearing / bearing / washer / mount / nut. Where does the lock washer go? 

Thanks!

The order of idlers installation:
Bolt > washer > nylon spacer > bearings > washer > lock washer > mount > lock nut

I've got to say that marcmt88 has some great customer service! I ordered a mount from him but there was a small mixup, within a few days I had received a replacement free of charge. :slight_smile:

Aside from that, the mount that I ordered seems to be held back by its design. Firstly, the motor clamp has to be ridiculously tight in order for it to make good contact with the trucks. Even after that (and some locktite red) the screw was still loosening after <3-mile rides. I ended up snapping that screw trying to remove it. I then had to drill that out and re-tap it to an M6 thread. Even an M6 bolt with a lock washer and locktite red loosened after short rides. I ended up rounding off the nut torquing it down as hard as I could as a final resort. That worked, but now I'm super fucked if I want to take it off.

This doesn't seem to have any sort of mitigation for vibrations. All the screws all small and with minimal amounts of encouragement come loose. I've had every single section of the mount come loose at some point in time. This all seems like it was overlooked during the design phase. 

For example:
Instead of using an M5 screw for the mount, use a much beefier M6 or larger bolt and a castle nut/cotter pin to prevent the bolt from coming loose during bumpy rides. Or add room for a Nord-Lock washer. 

The clamp is not very long. A longer clamp would help tremendously. 

Use longer screws for the where the bracket meets the clamp so that lock nuts can be added also, use larger screws. Instead of the slot/groove combination, use a set of pre-drilled holes. This will limit the amount of adjustability but will ensure that the mount will not be as encouraged to pivot.
https://i.imgur.com/pfAkv8L.png

The idler setup is very bad if left uncovered. There needs to be some sort of cover included.

For the designs that use the parallel tracks for belt tensioning, it just sucks. This is the issue that I am currently stuck on. My chain came dangerously loose after some short rides and I am unable to fit it because I locktit'd in all the screws as hard as I could so that they wouldn't loosen. 
Something like this might be a good start:
https://i.imgur.com/y8R4OkB.png

It's just not worth the effort at this point. If I can ever take the thing off it will have to go into the trash.

yep, are those the ones your using?  If so, you good to go.  If not, then by getting the center to center distance you can use that and the pulley measurements to get the belt size you need.  Then you don't have to wait as long to get moving.

You don't get it @Mikenopolis ... because I havent explained. The mount is thick in that area (10 mm), there is no need for more unnecessary metal specially if there are bumper extensions. We took metal where it was not necessary. Metal integrity is assured.

Yeah, that may be the case. They look real huge in pictures. But in reality are not that big, although they look long. Another aspect is that aluminun is not heavy. A single mount like that doesn't even weight half the grams of one of the little 63x72 monster motors I will attach to it....

Hello Marc,
 i had bought a mount from you a few months back and your mounts are holding up pretty good. i decided to change the ESC to a better VESC. Your mounts are amazing but i need a help here. 
1) I have a 5055-280 Turningy motor with 4mm bullet connectors.
2) Vesc from DIY electronics that has a 5.5 mm bullet connector . 

Any way i can join a 4mm connector to a 5.5mm connector??
Any help is appretiated.

Can someone help a noob idiot out? I have 6354 motors mounted with 14T/36T pulleys. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get my 280mm belts to fit. I see a picture with a larger motor on 15T/36T pulleys using a 280MM belt. 

What am i doing wrong? Note *have the idler version but assuming 280mm is too short to use idlers and wont be using them but still can't get them to fit. I'm sure I'm doing something stupid. Thanks much in advance.

Hi Marcmt88

I've been poking around the site and the web and looks to be exactly what I'm looking for. 

I would really like to do some custom mounts on these HST trucks from Hamboards.

What info would you need?

I swapped the Riptide Blue 83mm onto one of my Hambs, so they seem compatible.

So Mr @marcmt88 has been busy working on a custom adapter & motor mount setup for my Hamboard HST trucks.   Really cool guy to work with.   As a noob eskater - I appreciated his patience with me as I asked lots of questions and he was just super helpful with recommendations and advice. 

I honestly can't believe how quickly he turned it around.  When I started searching for a motor mount for these trucks, I was dismayed thinking that the dream was going to be just too difficult - would need to buy a CNC...figure out how to use it... spend tons of money on trial and error - but Marcmt88 delivered!!
Custom Pulley Covers and he also added two stabilizer rods between the mounts (one pictured)

## \#383 Posted by: mmaner Posted at: 2019-01-01T15:01:31.758Z Reads: 180

The problem with most trucks is on the lean. The hanger will hit the baseplate in the side of the hanger that is forward. That happens less on Paris trucks than in caliber trucks, as in you can lean more before contact. 

I haven't looked at it critically, so I'm not sure if the kingpin comes into okay. I have measure the angle of tilt in like setups where the only difference is Paris or Caliber trucks. 

Also, there are lots of well made motor mount options available for Paris trucks. Psychotiller's RIPBA mounts are elegent. It took 30 mins for me to sand down a paris hanger, both sides, and they litterally cannot move with the force/friction fit. 

I guess what I'm saying is that assuming an inexpensive build I would prefer patis trucks over caliber trucks, also I want to understand why more people don't.
```

That's the thing, these are press fit. The RIPBA mounts that is. They are elegent in design and fit. For all the people using bolt in mounts there are plenty of good designs in the same vein for Paris.

Because it's hard to secure stuff (motor mounts) to round things if you don't want it to turn.  It's an inherently unstable design.

I don't think it has much at all to do with the actual truck performance.  But I'm not sure

It may not be hard, but I like the failsafe of "inherently stable" instead of "held stable only by fastening devices".  I'd just use any truck that's not round if it's to have motor mounts installed on it.  Unless I welded it.  If it was welded, sure...

I've tried a few premium trucks over the years, nothing like @squishy mind you, yet I think I covered all the major brands of precision for freestyle, and I felt the difference between all the big-name precision trucks is _very_ minimal (except with the old Ronins, which turn like crazy out of the box).

Improvement from there, for me anyways, was just like climbing, where we're buying titanium pans and pegs to shave a few ounces off without sacrificing strength.

I would agree with the opinion that Calibers are kind of basic yet, my opinion, their deficiencies are very well-hidden with cambered decks and esk8 vibration, like the Vanguard.  

Perhaps this is also why cast Ronins on esk8 feel so vastly different than Calibers too, idk (accelerating with cRonins into turns, for me, they will 'dive' into those turns on shorter boards, so I downgrade to Caliber).
