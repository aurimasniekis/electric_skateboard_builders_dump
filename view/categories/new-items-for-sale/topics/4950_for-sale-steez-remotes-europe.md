I have 10 steez remotes available to buy in Europe. I can post worldwide but the price will be slightly higher due to shipping cost. 

£60 shipped within UK 
£63 Shipped Within europe
£68 shipped USA. 

Included in the price is the remote, wrist strap, silicone protector and the receiver. 

Payment can be made either by paypal (PM me for details) or they will be listed on eBay UK in the next few hours. :slight_smile:
