It depends on the motor kv, with that gearing go with 170kv or lower

140kv racerstars would be perfect

I would say yes if trampa doesn‚Äôt have a different hole pattern for the motors.
But probably you need to shorten the shaft like on regular gear drives.

I think the question is how long the motor shaft should be and how long the motor shaft can max be.
that would be interesting for not only the trampa motors.

that¬¥s a good idea!
or a 3D printed spacer you can just add inbetween the motor and the mount.

Even if its a rather low gear ratio, it just looks so freaking awesome. Now just need some brake  light LEDs stuck on the end of the motors for some kick ass style points

@MorrisHsu needs to colab with @LunarKim on that :D

I really like the idea and the look - only the gear ratio is a little off for me. I'd prefer a 3:1 ratio (I am currently using a 42/15 ratio on 83mm wheels - larger wheels would need an even higher ratio).
Is there a way to change the gearing (would be necessary once you go pneumatics)?

Because of the size relationship, it is difficult to change the gear ratio.
There are plans for AT wheels, which should be able to achieve this gear ratio.

## \#75 Posted by: Winfly Posted at: 2019-03-29T09:52:45.901Z Reads: 476

```
I guess the difference is, here in SF we are already riding on the street, basically treating ourselves like bikers. And a lot of roads are bike and car shared or have dedicated bike lanes. We go onto the sidewalk at the corner of the city block so there's always a ramp to go on. Otherwise we just stop and pick up the board on the curb at our destination.  So getting off the curb is really unnecessary.

Also a heavy board like this should never jump off the curb.

@MorrisHsu 

form filled.

can we get parts from you if things need replacing?  bearings, gears, etc.

also, what's the approximate weight of each one?

do the gears need to be greased?  if so, what type?

@sofu

can you please measure or take a pic of ground clearance?

I think this gearbox is a really great solution for people who like narrow trucks and a lot of power. I have more fun carving calibers than surfrodz and i enjoyed retaining the power I had and not having to go down to smaller motors. I gave some suggestions to @MorrisHsu from my tests that I'm posting here, just for posterity. I'll translate to english later but here it is in chinese:

Thank you kindly for your suggestions~
That hole [in the pivot cup side of the gearbox] I agonized over a while after I tested it, but because it is necessary for adjustability, I'm thinking to be like E-Toxx and use Sugru to prevent leaking grease. As for the rest, I will do adjustments here. I'm thinking if this batch goes well, I will make kegel adapter and Surfrodz adapter and AT wheel [adapter].

I went to test it a bit yesterday, there are some problems with skipping... Sometimes Torque seems too big [for the mesh]. Probably put a load bearing where I drew the red circle, otherwise the drive gear will run away.

Basically a really responsive and quality guy and his hardware is great. Just needs one major change (additional bearing on the drive gear) and some possible minor ones and it's a great gearbox!

Nice testing @sofu ! And awesome he is receptive to feedback. 

A lot of motors cans can move away from the front under load like 1mm or so, this might be a contributing factor to the mesh issue under load. I think some designs have a trust bearing under the motor gear. 

Thanks for linking my mounts, that is round one has some good pics but the current round is 3 and active.

Yeah there is a thrust bearing in this case and the motor gear is right up against it. It's not possible for it to move backwards at all. I think in this case there is just too much play in the wheel gear for it to mesh properly under high torque. An extra bearing at the very front like I marked would probably solve that.

I found out it's not possible to use your pressfit mounts on surfrodz because it's mounted too shallow. Not enough space for the wheel...

[/quote]

The space from the front to the mounting surface is 19mm / How far in do the gear drives sit from the end of the hanger? @MorrisHsu 

![image|683x466](upload://qBl01EIUiiKFX1uQRXE3OO1Z0dQ.png) 

To go further in would require the round part to be larger than the 29mm it is now. 

![image|563x500](upload://byQc1MWPuGQ6MyqRmIxjMeqA2C9.png) 

There is 35.7mm of usable axle when using a 70mm shoulder bolt. Longer shoulder bolts could alleviate the issue.

I'm really glad that when I gave my detailed feedback to @MorrisHsu he really listened and updated his design. It's not my original suggested design change but I believe the big thrust bearing will be even better for keeping the wheel gear in place so the two gears will mesh well. Of course, this new change will be thoroughly tested... I really want this gearbox to be great!

Roller bearings are used as stock in the fork headset of high end 200kg motorbikes putting out 150hp, or upgraded to where the bike is budget made and they wear out. Very suitable for high load applications

If the axle is not true to the hanger that could be a problem...but that would be any bearing

use it in combination with the grub screws. Degrease the surfaces with alcohol and maybe even slightly roughen them with fine sandpaper. 

Pretty strong in my experience (if applied correctly)

Can you show exactly how it mounts?

thanks for your suggestions, I think the surface is plenty rough from the grub screws digging in ü§£I'll try it once i get my loctite 648 bottle tomorrow

![IMG_5615|666x500](upload://zsviaqhiCV34PFnwVYld1OsykXF.jpeg)

I don't have pics handy but here is an earlier pic. Ignore the red circle and look right above it, you can see there's tons of area around the truck that the mount isn't contacting. We later remounted it so that at least two sides are contacting on two flat sides of the hangers and sank the grub screws into the other two sides, and that's lasted a bit longer through hard riding, but in the end it hasn't worked still. 

To be honest I think the simple best solution at this point is the pressfit mount that @MorrisHsu is making now

try applying the green loctite where the red and black pieces contact. That plus well-torqued bolts should hold it in place.

FWIW the Torqueboards mounts mount in a similar way (4 grub screws one on each face) and it's been rock solid for me. I brace the flat side opposite of the curved side, however, and dont use that grub screw essentially only using 3 grub screws.

@bevilacqua is right. I use the same loctite for my DD. it's meant to prevent 2 cylindrical parts to slide on each other. It can fill up gaps up to 0.2mm. After that you will need heat to disassemble it.

We did switch to bracing the truck against 2 flat sides and grub screw on the other 2 sides. The casted hanger is just too soft and the screws dig out the holds over time. We will try the bonding loctite and if that doesn't hold we will need to wait for the pressfit.

The new Evolve 97mm is great btw. Feels great carving with them and it also put the deck lower.

sounds to me that this is the problem of the screw from the housing having problems holding onto the clamp. Maybe use a selflocking nut.

i had bad experiences with this little grubscrews all the time on my mounts, lock tide or not. exchange them with general screws of its size (4m or5m think it is in my case)
and its a bit more easy to tighten them up from time to time. The gap in between your hanger and your mount is the main problem, but you found out for yourself. would be more stable if you have the chance to wedge it somehow, maybe 3d printed wedge for in between for now.

I use an m8 hex 12.9 grub screws torqued to 14-18Nm with loctite 242 on my mounts and they have never vibrated loose, under any type of riding. It could possibly be the type/size of grub screw used, but could also possibly be the gap (caused by the inherent inaccuracies of the caliber hanger) that is the cause of the problem.

You need to torque it down with a wrench, not just with an allen key.

That also looks like a flat m8 grub, you'd need a cup point or knurled cup point grub screw.

If you're already designing/set on a pressfit mount, you can probably ignore all this, though i'm not sure how tou intend to design a pressfit for non-precision trucks.

You cannot acheive a pressfit if you only have control over the tolerances of half the mating parts. This was the problem i had while designing a pressfit mount for caliber trucks - the casted trucks differed too much, with a deviation of 1mm at times.

So there were actually a couple problemw installing the v2. For whatever reason the machining on one of them for the mounting mechanism was completely botched. The way the new mounting mechanism works is it also holds the gear in place so the gear doesn't slop when operating. This is an improvement but it makes the tolerances in that area very tight. This means the machining defect was a huge deal as the gear itself was not able to be installed. @MorrisHsu and I were both quite upset when we discovered it...

![IMG_7222|666x500](upload://wFEXN70CqfzL0S1FeaoRU4SkY92.jpeg)

Well I ended up shaving a lot off around the mount on both sides so the new gear can fit. Morris already has a solution for this but I thought I'd just update y'all

![IMG_7330|666x500](upload://aaEsyE9EYg9yG3Yq4zkHrJJE9vU.jpeg) ![IMG_7329|666x500](upload://8FsxrqyW31E4IyQx4qG1Kw2CrNA.jpeg) 

If you don't shave it off there are very slight tolerance issues in calibers where the axle may be tilted just enough that the gear + wheel combo will cause the inside areas of the gear to rub hard against the mount. These are brand new genuine calibers. After shaving it though it's all good, been riding it fairly hard with no issues. The new mounting system is really awesome!

I would expect as soon as @MorrisHsu has verified the new gear design and considered if he wants to implement the new mount design. Technically the gearbox itself is fine now, but I gave him some more suggestions on improving the gearbox -> mount hole pattern and some idea of how to seal off the mounting holes so you can actually put grease in it. We also determined that a slightly wider diameter hole for the wheel gear was necessary for this new design. Other than that it‚Äôs almost good to go I think...

It looks like two months before I get the deck in my hands and I‚Äôm trying to figure out what drive train I‚Äôm putting on it. It‚Äôs already a rare deck and it‚Äôs getting covered by Sender  so it‚Äôs going to be stunning. I‚Äôd really like this drive on it to make it even more unique. Realistically speaking, what‚Äôs your time line looking like and approximately what‚Äôs the price point you are considering?  Thanks

Thank you for your support of my gearbox.
I finished the final version of the gearbox  
This week will be sent to the @sofu  test
If all goes well, it may take 10 to 15 days of production.  
Gears Drive Kit (one gearbox) is priced at 160usd

As a matter of interest, I know a car's diff gears are also spiral crown wheel and pinion. But they are unidirectional. By that I mean they can work in reverse (obviously) but it is for instance not a good idea to do heavy 4x4 recoveries in reverse because of the high torque load. It will strip the crown wheel. 

Are these bi-directional?

Just wanted to update y‚Äôall on the final design and how things are going. @MorrisHsu did verify the new-new-new design and I have them here ready for install, which I‚Äôm doing now. We determined that it would probably be a good idea to switch machine shops cause this one seemed to not be very good at what they‚Äôre doing...

![image|375x500](upload://8ZGegWRZtK3y2elLFFOSM9cpYrn.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://fYzqIzObIjYlby8TZctTeoorta1.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://owpwtgVsPzJQwegdvBntHUpeWlW.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://cuI3NEti2aIUTALSTG9C1jtkeZ6.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://4uaPplmnidesvaLl8nmfOaO54Np.jpeg) 

When Morris contacted the machine shop about these problems they refunded his money right away lol

Anyways there‚Äôs a notable change that I‚Äôm testing, it might not end up being the final product anyways, but the gears in this version are no longer spiral. They‚Äôre simply bevel. Ive yet to see how this will affect performance, and if it‚Äôs negative he can switch back easily. Will report back!

I would say so. I‚Äôm assuming I won‚Äôt have to do another round of testing after this, but we will see. 

I forgot to mention that Morris now includes thicc spacers to take advantage of the longer axle on TB218s. So the gearboxes now sit wider apart on those.

Aight so here's the latest:

New drive kit installed, it works well for the most part. I sealed the mounting hole with heat resistant silicon and added grease this time. Even a little bit made a big difference, and the seal made it so much quieter. Also the new mounting mechanism forces the mesh to be exactly perfect, so it runs super smooth as well.

As expected though, aluminum is absolutely too soft for this application so Morris is switching back to steel spiral bevel gears like the previous kits.

Don't think an adaptor exists to convert to another mounting system...yet.

It would be interesting if someone had these to try and cobble together with Morris's drive system...just maybe it would work.

@MorrisHsu do you happen to have any pictures and inner dimensions on the new-new truck mounting plate that touches the truck? Can't tell if it's press fit for calibers or just a generic circular shape. Would appreciate the info.

This is the inner dimensions of the truck mounting plate.  
The unit is mm

I see. It's only slightly smaller from your last iteration with the shaped caliber contour. I just measured my cRonins with some calipers and they were approx. 18mm x 18mm at the tip but there's a progressive curve closer to the kingpin measuring 20 x 23mm around 45mm in from the tip. 

What's the total length of the mounting plate? I'm assuming the dimensions stay the same throughout its entire depth.

doubt it.

if anything i'd suspect he'd work on surfrodz rkp mount since there's more demand for that.

but...i'm just guessing

Surfrodz rkp mount is completed as soon as possible this year.   
Because I am busy at work all day, the efficiency of making Surfrodz rkp mount is very low.

They are don't trip slalocybins, my all time favorite set of trucks. I was just exploring drivetrain options for these trucks. I mean if you take custom orders I have the funds

Give it time, there still isn't very many of these out in the wild. Most of us are waiting for the first round for Caliber to ship. Morris has been very receptive to feedback so that could help the next round for different trucks

Maybe I can try it. Can you give me the size of the truck?  
But I can't give you the answer so soon, because I have to make a Surfrodz rkp mount first.

For sure. The hanger width is 90mm-96mm-102mm-108mm adjustable using spacers and each axle is 50mm long. I really don't think there is enough space on the hanger, but a picture is worth a 1000 words so heres 3. If you think it's possible I'll happily send you my rear truck for testing. ![IMG_20191104_090406|375x499](upload://mtNHpPC3TJ4H1kgLuxd9rpuo6JZ.jpeg) ![IMG_20191104_090321|375x500](upload://xJenXYTPpujm2mD7uI8uzNcHert.jpeg) ![IMG_20191104_090235|666x499](upload://fpPA7zhCzUf1OLEzIFRxomzkVad.jpeg)
