I'm in for one off shogu and also got one of the CNC €35 Euro ones that are in the market at the mo 👍🏻

@atenner  I didn't see hobbyking ones on back order in UK warehouse, checked yesterday. Perhaps it's just USA on back order...

I'm using caliber fifty 10" and it's holding well, I have just put them on, just to see how they fit and it all looks good and feels sturdy. I'll need another set of 1/8inch risers for sure, motor is huge and cable is catching deck. 

Btw, is there a difference on which way mount trucks? I've see pics with them being mounted both ways. 

I think I'll pass on the EU CNC mount unless this one fails quickly.

Ohhh poor you.  As for quality - sh*te but you get what you pay for haha. The black coating is comming off as soon as you touch it.  Feels soolid but ascetics are horrible.

Also no screws for bolts - well I guess I'll get some decent quality ones myself. Any idea of size ? M6? M4? 

I hope they work fine. Also got two 250 mm belts where listing said 250 and 260 so I'm not happy. Neutral feedback will be left at least, I'll see if I need longer belt when I get home with it.

😂 oh dear. I prefer silver anyway 🤔 You can get your money back. Easily, they will have to pay for return shipping (which they obviously won't do as it's from china) so you'll get two free pulleys. Start a not as described claim on eBay and upload that picture. If mine turn up like that I will be.

I'll measure it once home ;) as for claim - I'll def do it for belt reason. As for pulleys, I looked closer on the stolen pics ( there is a guy here who's pics they have taken and undercutting him in therms of price ) they have on their listing and there is a bit of chip comming off as well. So it's to be expected...

Yeah unfortunately the whole set is totally unusable. My motor pulley won't work as grub screws too big, holes don't match up with abec core or the metal plate !! Just put a return claim on eBay for my pulley set. As a not as described claim, they will pay the postage to return (which they won't as it's to China) so eBay will step in and refund entire amount. So literally the whole set will be in the bin apart from 6 bolts 😂

So, no go on stopping the shipment. The seller even tried to contact the Post Office. Too late. They were apologetic about the whole thing, so I like to assume people are honest. I'll let it come in and see what happens. What were the ebay seller names where you all bought your knock-offs? Maybe my seller has a different batch. Though I doubt it. It does say in the description that parts may be off by 1-3mm. Silly me.

The belts are all 250mm. The motor pulleys only have 11 teeth. The grub screws are to small for the holes in the motor pulley (M2 i think). 
On the plus side they gave me one extra screw for one of the wheel pulleys :joy:

Look as sh*it as mine haha. @atenner has received second batch from same seller with slightly better quality ( slightly more expensive ). Do your retainer holes match pulley holes? Mine are slightly off .. :/ At the moment I managed to screw in 4 out of 6 bolts because of misalignment. Done 7 miles on it - so far so good nothing came loose.

He tried saying half refund, and I could keep the pulleys 😂 I said no. So tomorrow is the day that I can ask eBay to step in and make a decision. So yea they will give full refund. I'll confirm tomorrow. Where did your parcel arrive from ? Just make sure you click 'defective/doesn't work' or 'not as described' for your reason for return. They will HAVE to pay for return shipping or let you keep the item, with a full refund.

So I received my knock off kit from China. Only 11 teeth on the motor pulley and two 250 belts. However, all six of my screws fit perfectly 

EDIT: on closer inspection, grub screws are waaay too small. Belts seem too small too.

Right, but the grub screws (Set screws) are far too small for the motor pulley. So I'm asking if anyone knows what the real size should be.

I'm guessing M3 or M4

I'll bring the pulley into my local hardware store. They're a small mom & pop shop, so they seem to have everything.

It's M4. I tried a screw from another pulley and its M4.

I've asked the seller to issue a refund. Would I be better off just going through ebay support directly?

Yes. Just start a return claim as "doesn't match description or photos"

They just offered to refund me $6.00 of the $28 CAD total. Hahahahaha. That's $4.77 USD. 

I told them full refund or I involve eBay.

Yeah, first it was us going back and forth directly. I've now submitted a ticket to eBay. If they don't agree by the 25th, eBay will step in. At that point I'm contacting Johnny to see if he can ship some real ones my way. :slight_smile:

Every time I open this topic I wonder if I'm at the right place. It's amazing this discussion turned from "PU wheels" through "eBay pulley set" to "how to get eBay refund" :smile:

Did it come in yet? Just contact the seller. They will offer you a whopping $6. Just decline and ask again for a full refund, but be sure to do it through ebay support as "item not as described or pictured". That way ebay will step in if necessary.
