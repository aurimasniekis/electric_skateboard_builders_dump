How much would be the shipping then?
Can i solder it with a normal soldering Iron? 
I'm just getting into E-Longboards.

Shipping would be around 2 or 3 $.
You'll need a heat gun to solder the DRV chip. Keep in mind that soldering this is not an easy thing if you're new to soldering and it's also time consuming.

Sorry for the late response.

I can solder pretty good with normal Components. I never used SMD before but where is the fun without a chalange^^

For the heat gun i have this on hand.

The it goes up to 650°C. 

Woud this work with the Soldering?

I woud order the components for the 4.12 PCB because i can't find the list for the 4.11 PCB and it is only one extra Capacitor anyway.

You'll need around 230°C. You also need to have the adjustable temperature and airflow.
