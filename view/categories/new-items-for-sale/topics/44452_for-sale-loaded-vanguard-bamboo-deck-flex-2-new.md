Allright gents, selling spare parts! Got a vanguard deck here I was planning to use for a street build but switched to another deck!

If you’re interested and you live somewhere in Europe let me know and she is yours! I’m located in Utrecht, the Netherlands, I strongly prefer you picking it up to avoid shipping this huge thing.

Price: €120,-
