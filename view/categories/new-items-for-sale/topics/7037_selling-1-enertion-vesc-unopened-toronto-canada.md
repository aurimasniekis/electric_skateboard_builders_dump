Enertion sent me a VESC by accident. I could send it back but I wanted to check and see if anyone in Toronto/Markham was really desperate for a VESC immediately. Its still in the shipping package. Never even seen the Toronto sun :)

He deserves to know. That's a loss of $200. It is the right thing to do to give it back.

I don't think quanze should pay shipping, Enertion should. Sorry, it is around $180 AUD not $200 AUD.

I was sent an email saying I'd be charged for it if I didnt return it. So I figured I'd save everyone some time and money if I could just pass it off to someone else nearby who needed it. I never had the intention of 'stealing' or what ever sketchy stuff people say I'm trying to do ... Just trying to be helpful -3-

Oh, I thought you were going to make money off this. So you will sell it to someone, get the money, and then pay Enertion?
