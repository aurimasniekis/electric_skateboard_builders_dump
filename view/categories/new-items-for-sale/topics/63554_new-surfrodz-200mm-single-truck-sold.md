This is a single truck. It’s brand new. I bought a set and only needed one of them. 

Base plate angle is 45
Axle is 10mm by 60mm
Bushings are cone/barrel (they are the blue ones from surfrodz, I think these are medium durometer)

$60 bux plus the price of shipping and the $3 PayPal fee.

Do these require a separate axel? I have never worked with surfrodz before
Edit: Nvm just saw the axel kit on their website

I’m including the axles with it. It’s the whole kit but just a single
