seems like a nice budged kit.
But i would suggest using an other remote, like the Mini.
This Nano remote (Winning) is known for its dropouts or freakouts.

I have used and tested the kit personally and it's superb for the price. You get so much for your money. The kit makes my board go about 34km/h depending on how much battery I have left and from my experience it can climb hills that are about 20¬∞. I have never even been close to running out of battery even though I ride pretty aggressively, so that is a bonus. Sadly I have not tested the full range but they say it is supposed to go between 35-50km. I have got to say though the battery is fantastic for the price! Definately recommended if you want a silent, fast, strong and easily put together board for a fantastic priceüëç Another thing I have to say is that the shipping was super fast. I live in Sweden and i got it in only about a week which is super good compared to some other sellers.

Think about it though, a heck of a lot of people's DIY li-ion pack builds are flat, single layer 18650 packs and to pack enough cells in, say for 10s3p or 8s4p you put 2 cells end to end making it around 130mm (2 x 18650 (65mm x 2)) wide... a bit wider when you factor in padding, nickel and heat shrink...  You wouldn't be able to fit a very big pack in these enclosures as they are unless they're really long... and no-one want's that. :confused:

As it stands they're really good enclosures, hats off to you for the modular (flexible) design, but at that width, they're no good to a lot of people.

I'd suggest you make a bigger mould to house 2 x 18650's end to end, you'll sell thousands! :thumbsup:

I'm putting together a board and am really interested in this kit, just curious though.  Reading what @darkkevind is saying, I'd like a more flat battery pack also.  Can the same battery pack be made with one layer of cells?  Also can I purchase this kit minus the enclosure?

No problem. When you create your first moulds, I'll be your first customer I hope! :slight_smile:

Bear in mind that the 140-150mm width I mentioned, should be INSIDE your cut-outs for the screw holes, not to the edge wall of the enclosure.

PSA:  You know if folks have problems with your new products catching on fire, then they will all be outlawed, right?  It's in everyone's best interest to make sure everything is safe.  Because if not, you won't have anything to sell to anyone.  Neither will anyone else.
Test everything ten times as much as you think they should be tested.  Under all conditions.  Throw it off a building in the rain, then put it in a hot car and plug the charger in while holding the remote on full.  That kind of testing.

quite ture, the caught fire issue is due to the cost competition, it is not all scooter factory, only few , the battery too cheap.
we admire your suggest, actually we have been doing this way with extrem tests, collission, drop from high place, and kinds of riding in the rain or spray water onto the enclosures and escs.

In all fairness, the particular kit you are advertising here does not make use of a waterproof volt meter. 
You'd want this (slightly more expensive) version. Same dimensions, only a bit taller.

hot glue won't solve the issue. The water seeps in between the display and the outer plastic housing, onto the PCB and into the enclosure.

Certain they are just resellers. Search for waterproof volt meter and you will come across the same item/different brands.
