HTD5M drive pulleys for ABEC11 Flywheels, Kegel, MBS 100, Evolve GT Wheels, and ABEC style clones.  

Pulleys are machined individually from **SOLID** acetal rounds, these are **NOT 3d printed**.  These drive pulleys are fully customizable to any # of teeth and width according to your needs.  Very easy to install and align perfectly every time.   2.5” bolts are threaded directly into the full thickness of the pulley.
-	Set includes 1 HTD5M drive pulley and 1 retainer washer (2.5” stainless retainer bolts sold separately).
-	Note:  retainer washer is solid ABS.

Facts about acetal resins:

Acetal resins, aka POM (polyoxymethylene) or acetal Delrin are engineering thermoplastics based on formaldehyde polymerization technology. These highly crystalline resins are strong, rigid and have a low coefficient of friction against metals, acetals and other plastics. They are creep resistant so they are good for parts where dimensional stability is important. 

Acetal resins have high tensile strength, stiffness, resilience, fatigue endurance and toughness.  Acetals have high resistance to organic solvents, excellent dimensional stability, a low coefficient of friction and outstanding abrasion resistance among thermoplastics. 
Acetals’ resistance to creep is excellent.  Moisture, lubricants and solvents including gasoline and gasohol have little effect on this property, which is important in parts incorporating self-threading screws or interference fits.

Applications
•	Bushings and bearings

Do these come in 18mm width?  (18mm belt, 19mm actual width)

Also are the 15mm ones actually 16mm wide?

Do you have the ones that take skate bearings and ride the axle?  (with no bolts, just inserts)

Basically just like the 38T kegel pulley that Evole sells, except in 18mm width instead of 15mm

They look great but isn't there a lip missing that somehow rests on the actual wheel hub (see below)? It looks like as if the pulley would just be pressed against the thane?

Well done Marc :blush:

I will need a couple for my new Abec 11 107mm in black plus 2x bolts set. Also, I broke the bolt that goes on the truck clamp of your mounts (the big one that presses the hanger to the truck, it got somehow stucked), could you please also include a couple of these?

Have you tested motor pulleys with that material?  

And last... do you have spare 330mm belts? I don't find them on the Internet for EU, will have to step to local stores and waste some time otherwise.

I forgot if its possible to get 2x retainers for flywheels 90mm 36T (just retainers). I got ALU pulleys from @JLabs but I pressed too much the bolts in one and it broke some "legs" (yours don't have "legs", sorry don't know the name).

So, wrapping all together:
- 2x set of pulley + retainer for Abec 11 107mm, size suggestion is welcome :slight_smile:
- 2x set of bolts for pulleys
- 2x bolts for mount hanger-press-or-whatever-it-is-called (the big ones)
- 2x retainers for Flywheel 90mm 36T 

Cheers!

This. From my previous experience sitting it on the thane is sailing from problems, the best would be making this part follow the curvature of the hub to get a solid interface

The retainer washer is machined to sit on the core, not the soft urethane wheel.  The pulleys have extended flange (depending on wheel) so that it buds against the thane.

But then you are relying on the small contact point with the thane and Pulley.. there is no other part on the pulley to “disperse” the force. I have some other comments, but I will leave them out. 

How many miles have you put on one of these pulleys to test the longevity?

If you tighten against the thane then you can deform the wheel. For the more heavy handed installers it may avoid problems if it had a part that would brace against the core?

These pulleys are acetal (engineer plastic), there are no need to overtighten.  I also did not tap the pulleys all the way thru so when you thread in the bolts, you will encounter resistance at the end point which also lock the bolt in place, like a lock nut but without one.

The newly modified pulleys have a larger bore hole to clear the truck's hanger.  The pulleys are design to sit on the thane, it's not necessary to overly tighten the bolts.  Not sure what you meant by difficulty in aligning the pulley, I tested them on TB, Caliber, Paris with ABEC, Kegal, MBS, and clones, they went in with ease.

Hmm I wonder why people make bolt through pulleys when slide in pullies are so easy to change gear ratios on the fly or just change your wheels no mucking about required.

I have 3d printed 33t pullies from @longhairedboy that get my board to 44mph and I'm currently running old Enertion stock of the 36t slip on pullies. 

If you make slip on pullies then I'll buy more of the cause changing gear ratios can be fun. 

Bolt through left. Slip on right. For illistration purposes.

I don't know why the big fuss about pulley pressing against the thane.  The whole circumference of the pulley is evenly laid on the thane which distributed the pulling force around it when you tighten the bolts.  
having slip on pulleys minimize installation time but again, how often do you really change out gear ratio?  To machine slip on pulleys is not difficult but require building different fixture and jigs for work-holding which translate to $$$.

Well because the urathane compresses on the bottom and more so when cornering and since the pully is resting on the thane it puts alot of stress on the pullies. It may be fine but people are unwilling to risk their bodies on something they know is not right.

[/quote]

Because it’s extremely hard to get it aligned properly and it does not distribute force properly. You have to remember that thane is not hard, the best contact is with the hard plastic of the wheel hub. 

I’m usually not one to comment on other sellers posts, but I’m not sure you fully understand the faults with these pulleys, and your customers are pointing them out as well.

One of the biggest mistakes people make it trying to get the pulley really frikkin tight before balancing it. The best method is to get it snug, balanced, then back out each bolt 1 at a time and apply loktite. Then re-balance. 

It's a lot easier when you don't try to make the pulley sink I to the Thane, snug with no movement is all you need. Maybe 15 lbs of torque.

The pulleys look quality and good price, but I also think against the hub is better. I have made lots and lots of my own designed pulleys that I 3D printed and I found ones that rested on the thane did not stay straight. My theory as to why is that if you hit a big bump the thane squishes out the side and can move the pulley a bit, then its not strait anymore. 

POM is a great material, I use it for all my designs for my day job. Its strong, very low friction and is much more resistant to cracking at low temperature than most plastics which is good for northern people. Its is used in bag buckles for this reason.

" I’m usually not one to comment on other sellers posts, but I’m not sure you fully understand the faults with these pulleys, and your customers are pointing them out as well."

It's actually very easy to aligned the pulley properly and get distributed force evenly against the thane.  Since all retaining bolts are the same length and the pulley is individually cnc machined to close tolerance dimensionally (ie thickness), threading the bolts into the pulley until they protrude out  the same distance.  Voila, pulley is aligned and balanced.  No reason to over torque.

Hello Marc! I am in the process of purchasing everything I need to finish my build and I am interested in your motor mount. I am getting the Turnigy sk3 with the following specs :
Turns: 14T
Voltage: 10~12S Lipoly
RPM/V: 192KV
Internal resistance: 0.016 Ohm
Max Loading: 80A
Max Power: 4032W
Shaft Dia: 8.0mm
Bolt holes: 32mm
Bolt thread: M4
Weight: 858g
Motor Plug: 4.0mm Bullet Connector

I am pairing this motor with the  160mm Caliber 2 "Blackout" 50° - 9" Axle Trucks, as well as 97mm flywheel clones.

I am also in need of the entire Drivetrain system, belts, pulleys, etc, and I am not sure if you sell those as well but I believe I would need a 36t 16t set up with a 265mm belt.
 
I'm looking forward to doing business with you!

1mm wider than the belt is the standard when you buy those aluminium pulleys for industrial uses. Its nice to have a little wiggle room. @marcmt88 I assume these would be the same?

I received my pulley recently, had absolutely zero problem aligning the pulley against the Kegel wheel so if you have that concern, be rest assured of that.

Unfortunately, the width is slightly too thick so I was unable to screw on the axle nut, and I can't provide any additional feedback for now. Have ordered another set, and will report back further if that works.

Is this Acetal material strong enough for this type of pulley with bearing ?![20180616_124318|281x500](upload://68jUlzXCCIJREY7sQEvoh7R5ohb.jpg)

```
As long you install good quality bearings b/c over heating or ceased bearings could melt the acetal.
