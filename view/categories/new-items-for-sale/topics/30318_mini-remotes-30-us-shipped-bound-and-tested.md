I recently picked up a bunch of mini remotes online, and I have 10 to sell. I've bound each one to its receiver and tested each one with a servo. A bind plug and instruction manual will be included. AA batteries not included.

I'm selling them for $35 shipped within the US. If you are outside the US and want one, we can work out the shipping cost.

**If you would like to buy a remote, please let me know below and I will PM you.**
