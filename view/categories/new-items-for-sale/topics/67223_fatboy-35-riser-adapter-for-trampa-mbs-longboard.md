Looks like you'll just about to still adjust the trucks on the fly too.  Cool stuff
If I wasn't already committed to a certain off road board company I would be buying your whole shop!!

What is this made out of?  The wedge is solid stock correct?  i would think so because of the plug welds on the plates.  how much does one weigh?

Is it steel or aluminum? If aluminum what grade? Would you be willing to share a 3d model or 2d side view? Want to make sure it has enough lift for my project.
