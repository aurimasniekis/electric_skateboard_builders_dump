Details:
I ordered all the parts and put this remote together. Built with the optional vibration motor as well as upgraded antennas for the remote and reciever. I’ve got too many projects on my plate so this one needs to go. I’ll include some extra parts I have as well such as the throttle  wheel without the tab and parts I had to buy in bulk. 
Only thing left to is setup the reciever ID program. I’ll include a jst 2.0 cable to connect to a vesc. 
$100 shipped within the US , International shipping is an option but pricing will be on the buyer.
