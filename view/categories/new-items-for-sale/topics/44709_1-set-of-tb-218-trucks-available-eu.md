Hello fellow e-skaters,

So finally, after 3 months wait time, I received my order from @torqueboards, this was stressful, but your products look GREAT! Thank you!

- I got 4 sets of trucks for you EU guys so if anyone is still looking for these, they are â‚¬70 shipped from Switzerland. 

- I also have 3 sets of motor mounts available. These are for 63mm motors and they will fit the tucks with some force or with a bit of filling. I could also print a pulley cover in grey PLA if you wish. â‚¬60 for both if you purchase with the trucks. 

If you are interested, potential way of paying is with Friends and Family through PayPal or (***what I suggest!!*** ) with Goods and Services though PayPal however that will add â‚¬3 to the total. 

Thank you for taking a look!

Alright Gents,

Everything was shipped an hour ago and I updated all of you with tracking numbers. Trucks were sent with priority 2-3 day shipping so hopefully on Wednesday I'll have 5 updates of "received" here. 

Shipping turned out to be more expensive. I thought packages would weight under a kg each but they were around 1.4kg so shipping was about â‚¬26 instead of â‚¬16.

Since this was my mistake you don't have to do anything but I would appreciate if you send me another â‚¬6 or so to offset the shipping.

Enjoy your day!
```

Arrived today.

Also found out after I paid for them that they fit the enertion wheel pulleys without modification, unlike the caliber trucks I was planning on using. So that's an added bonus.
Thanks again.

No worries. As I said, my mistake for not checking the weight of the packages so I do appreciate this : )

Edit: you sent me â‚¬4 more than what I needed to offset shipping, I'll refund you those ðŸ˜‰ not trying to make money here, just helping eskaters go eskate!
