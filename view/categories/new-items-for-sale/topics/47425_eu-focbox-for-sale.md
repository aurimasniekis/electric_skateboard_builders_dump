Hi.

I'm selling my FOCBOX since I never started my project. It has never been tested or mounted in any way. It's completely new!

I was thinking about 130 Euros for it. I would also rather sell it to some inside EU than outside it.

Pack would be ~ 460mm long. So a bit longer then 0.5meters would do I think..?

Cool. The widht of the pack should be around 140mm. I'm not sure how wide the wrap should be for that. Perhaps in the 180-200 mm?

Lol what has this become :slight_smile:

I don't have a lot tbh

But I don't exactly charge much
