I've got two coupon codes for [TGMskateboards](http://tgmskateboards.com/)
I haven't used them. I am not sure if they are for one time use or not. I bought a set of trucks and risers from them and they sent me this. 

**$5 off $50 Purchase:** `W0491HH07`

**$10 off $100 Purchase**: `JA3F61T74558`

As far as I know, you can use these all the time for as many orders as you want. I had like a half dozen of the little coupon slips they send thinking I had all these sweet coupons.....later I realized they all had the same code on them. Threw all but one away. üòê
