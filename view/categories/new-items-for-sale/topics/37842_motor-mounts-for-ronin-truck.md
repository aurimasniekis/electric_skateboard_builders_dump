Hello everyone, I have CNC motor mounts to fit Ronin truck.  These mounts will work for wheel size ranging from 83 to 107mm and can be customized to fit larger wheels.  The clamp is 3/8" (~10mm) thick, the motor arm is 3/16" (~5mm) thick with integrated dual idlers.  This mount can be fitted with 50xx or 63xx motors by any manufacturer.
The price is $60 per set.  It includes 1 clamp, 1 universal motor arm and all stainless hardware.

Have you tested this mount. Doesn't seem to be enough room to mount a wheel let alone one with a pulley.

Mount can be slide along the axle to allow room for wheel and pulley.

by how much though? It seems like the hangar gets wider and it wouldnt fit.

Could you upload pics with the mount as far in as possible?

Have you personally tested sliding this mount in and mounting a 15mm pulley. If it was that easy everyone would be making mounts for these trucks

I have to say, those mounts look quite long and thin...

What's the center to center between the two pulleys? I could see these mounts bending under high load or impact without a crossbar between the two sides.

looks awesome dudes, only problem I foresee is ronin just dropped the width of their cast frucks from 180mm to 160mm :frowning:

Yep, I just forked over the extra money to buy a 180mm cast set from Europe because they’re gone in the US. 160mm from this point on I’ve heard.

Damn...I still have mine from last year...but BLEH they took their 25 degree baseplates off their website too.

Shouldn't it still be possible to use a single mount on a 160mm hangar though?...But if wanting to run dual motors, will have to definitely go diagonal setup. I wonder what OBC is doing about the whole 180mm hangar being discontinued...

Using a single or yingyang mounts should still be fine on 160mm.  I was wondering what Ollin would do too. They don't dual mount the Freeride, though, so if they are believers in Ronin's new - thinner is better 
 handling -system, probably no issue for them :face_with_monocle:

Jeremiah from Ollin prefers 180mm trucks...I'm not so sure he's going to like the 160mm's...his deck is pretty wide to begin with and I think there might be some major wheelbite with 160mm's and 90mm wheels.

Wheel bite was my concern as well. 180mm just give us more options.

They fit well and align pretty well. Takes a little hammering to get centered on the hangar and sanding finesse to get it perfectly positioned, because of the profile,  but it’s very close, out of the box.

I’m running washers as axle spacers and barely getting the locknut to bite, but it bites.  Could flip it around. I get a little bit of contact between the mount arm screws and the wheel pulley, but if not for that, there would be no issues running without spacers.  

I’m actually remixing that build onto an Evo and I’m going to try to move the mounts towards the center of the hangar just a couple more mm and lose the washers.

In summary, they work pretty well but initial setup takes some dialing.

While they are not Ronin, the Rogue cast 186mm trucks use a insert bushing to control the kingpin lateral movement. A up-side is less maintenance (not having to periodically dissemble and clean the support pin) you get more of that direct feeling but can dial out vibration-slide-give-grip a bit more if you want.

Have you tried the Ronin mounts with smaller wheels? I just eyeballed it with 85mm wheels, looks like there won’t be much clearance between the motor mount and the road.
