I'm in process of ordering a 8S BMS from BesTech. One configured for Li-Ion, one for Li-Po. Their minimum order quantity is 2 for each so I might end up having 2 extras.

The exact model I am getting is HCX-D149V1.

Anyone interested?

If there is more interest, we could even do a bigger group buy.

I'd be interested if you could change it so one is a 10S BMS.

This one?

Sorry, they have strict MOQ requirements. 10S model will take another 2 pieces...

Out of interest what is the difference between that one and the one I linked?
EDIT: The one I linked would probably be better for esk8 as the max discharge is 80A right?

The one i linked is only 60A but i think its enough for the vesc...

The HCX-D223V1 has a built in E-switch saving you $40-$60 for an external E-switch.
It also has higher balancing current so it will balance faster.
And it is available in 8s

Why not get 2 configured for Lipo then you can use it on either Lipo or Li-ion.
The only parameter you would change is the over discharge detection voltage and the highest possible setting is 3.0v and the lowest you should do for Li-ion is 2.8v. Might as well just use 3.0v for Li-ion as well as Lipo.
The over current detection doesn't really matter since you control battery current with Vesc settings.
The lowest possible parameter for over charge detection is 4.2v which is full charge voltage for Lipo and Li-ion alike.
The rest of the parameters can be the same for both batteries as well.

Of course, I was already going to do that if there was no interest for the BMS' I might additionally have. Parameters are already specified, I have data sheets for both ready. I will wait for a few days if there is still anyone interested and then just get two Li-Po ones if not (for myself).

So, contact me if you need one of the following BMS, BesTech HCX-D149V1 8S
G3M Li-Ion 2.8V
G3J Li-Po 3V

Sorry David, unless you want two of them, I cannot be of any help. But in that case you could also order them yourself :) The BMS I'm getting is HCX-D149V1.

You can't mix and match to get the Min Order Quantity?

Nope. It has to be the same product and also the same IC (BMS parameters).

Ahh good to know...  

Thanks for the info.

I guess I will see if anyone else wants the same BMS as me

Well, you shouldn't have problems finding a buyer. At least you have set your mind on the one that seems to be popular in the community. Nobody wants mine :)

I'm interested. 
But how much would it cost? Aswell as shipping to Sweden?

@Peetaa 
BMS is around $35, shipping extra. PM me your postal code and city so I can check weather they could ship one directly to you or it has to go through me first.

@DavidBanner
I haven't got a quote for shipping yet since I still don't know how many I will order in the end. Shouldn't be too much I hope :)

@navgor, I placed order for 4pcs and waiting for the package as we speak. One is already reserved (Li-Po), one left for you if you want (Li-Ion).

Great thanks for this. Yes, let me know when they arrive, fire me your PayPal and I'll make payment. It's LI-Ion that I'm after too.

Alright, so both BMS that were available are now reserved.

According to DHL, they should arrive by Friday but I won't be able to pick them up until next week. Also, I'm not yet sure how will the import taxes and VAT go. Will let you know the final price after everything is done.
