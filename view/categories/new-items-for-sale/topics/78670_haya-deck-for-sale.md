Decided to get a different deck for my build so I'm selling my HAYA deck I just got.  Deck is brand new, never used.  I've only taken it out of the box once.  Haven't even removed the lid which is screwed on.  I think there was only 30 made, so this is quite rare.  DM with an offer if interested.

I don't have any pics at the moment. I can take some, but I rewrapped it in the packaging so I'd have to redo that.  It looks exactly like the pics in the HAYA thread though.

Here's some pics.  I don't want to open it up as I haven't taken the lid off once yet, plus I don't have the star shaped allen wrench to do so anyway, lol.  The thread I linked shows plenty of pics of the inside anyway.

Torx bolt, you should get them very useful to get m4 torx bolts and a torx bit for securing motors, least chance of rounding out. Mushroom or dome head, same thing different parlance
