My head is 61-62cm around. I don't think they make a XXL, the XL will probably fit someone with 58-60 in head Size.

Apprently europeans have no interest in a awesome helmet :slight_smile: I'll check the shippingfee to the US.

Is this deal still around because it’s amazing?

I bought mine on titus for €282,99 and that is quite the deal already. 

Not interested by the way. Just happened to find this one.

I bought it...
But it is sized smaller than the regular pass so is quite tight..

Pretty awesome deal indeed, im basically giving stuff away :sweat_smile:

Too bad brits have the same problems as us swedes, huge heads (and brains) A warning to anyone going from a regular Pass to a carbon, it's a much smaller fit.

Yeah I read the carbon was a tighter fit which is why I went for the xl. It is a nice fit for me slightly snug with my 59 cm head

So the normal TSG pass is less tight? I got a 61,5cm head, so this one wouldn't fit?

The Carbon is made from the exact same mold as the Pass; they are identical.

The Carbon is not smaller (else the visors would not be interchangeable).

The Carbon is, however, way stiffer than the Pass, meaning, it flexes /less/ and will crack on impact.

I've worn TSG XL-XXL since the mid 2000s and a Pass since they were in testing (2014).  Just add a buckled chinstrap.

For comparison, Ruroc XL feels a bit too snug for me and Schuberth XXL will not fit me.  I'm not Asian but I wear Oakley Asian Fit.
