Hi All, trying to organise a 2nd batch of the DieBieMS board (6-12s BMS)

The deliverable are as followings:
1 x DiebieMS v0.8 (2oz PCB) assembled. (SD Card and RF module NOT mounted). Components I have stayed true to the original design including the expensive press fit terminals

5 red and 5 black x wire connectors (non-crimped) for battery and VESC 4x.
1x Male 16P connector
20 pcs non-crimped terminal for balance cables (some are spares)
1x Momentary switch
1x OLED 0.96 Display
4x single end male connector with cable (JST 1.25mm 5p, 10mm) (Display, switch, canbus)
1x single end male connector with cable (JST 2mm 4p, 10mm (VESC side can bus)
6x M5x14 spacer screws
1x 80A Fuse

Asking for 120USD/pc shipped to major cities around the world via Hong Kong Post with tracking Number. (~8-10 days) destination tax and duties not included. PM if interested, I will create PayPal invoices.
10USD/pcs goes to @JTAG as donation for the great design.

The new batch will start when I have received 20 pcs interest.  Would take around 4 wks to make. 
****  Remember to use CC/CV power supply with the BMS.

Best of all open sourced.

## \#11 Posted by: Samau18 Posted at: 2018-06-09T14:50:19.507Z Reads: 437

```
From the github description

Max load current +/- 100A (both directions, theoretically it's 140A but this is still untested).  
Max charge current 10A (with diode) or 30A (with diode bypass).
Cell voltage range 2.5V to 4.5V
Pack voltage 12V to 54V

** I put 80A fuse on the board, so people don't push it the board too hard.

The screen currently doesn't do that now.  But it is possible since it is open source firmware.   You can currently view the BMS status via CANBUS, so extending to the remote should be possible.

```
The heat from the BMS will be mostly from the balancing resisters to reduce the voltage of individual cells during charging.   The load current you are mentioning should be at the VESC.  At the BMS all the components are able to sustain the current (The boards are 2oz, terminals are pure copper), so I won't anticipate a lot of heat.  I will do a temperature test on my 12s4p built later and post a video.   Also remember to use the proper wire thickness to avoid overheating during high loads.

A couple of questions, Why do we need a CC/CV power supply, wouldn't my battery just work? 
Also how do I use CANBUS if I have already have 2 VESC's connected via CANBUS?
```

---
## \#30 Posted by: Samau18 Posted at: 2018-06-10T11:24:14.875Z Reads: 319

```
The cc/cv power supply is used to charge the battery, limiting the current going into charging the battery.

There are two canbus connectors on the diebiems, you can link all three.

Danny is running 2x IRFS7530-7PPBF on the discharge. ![42%20AM|412x500](upload://2ziCDVZRBd1Lo7lpcRCI8gzuOzy.png)

![41%20AM|690x300](upload://ku3xxqRxogRMT9jYKprjjsPUoEa.png)

It is rated at 240A... The temp chart seems to be for 100A @10V (Which is 25degree).   Not sure what the effect on heat when it goes to 50V, as the total power increases.  It seems it "may" be ok without it, but in any case, these are all values on paper; will try to test it live when I have my pack made.

At 80A:

P = I^2 * Rds = 6400 * 0.00115Ω = 7.36W

R(theta)JA = 40ºC/W

So 7.36W * 40ºC/W = 294.4ºC increase in temperature


Not going to melt anything around...

At 30A:

P = 900 * 0.00115Ω = 1.035W

1.035W * 40ºC/W = 41ºC increase in thermals so at 25ºC it will be 66ºC
```

---
## \#68 Posted by: Samau18 Posted at: 2018-06-12T10:54:59.517Z Reads: 241

```
But wouldn't the current be half since there are two mostfet, so the max current to each one is 40A

Following your math 
P = I^2 * Rds = 1600 * 0.00115Ω = 1.84W

R(theta)JA = 40ºC/W

So 1.84W * 40ºC/W =73.6ºC increase in temperature

Which is still high at 25+73.6 => 98.6 ºC.  Open air cooling may really be ok.  

I lost my maths many of years ago... so will still try to do some temp shooting with my newly purchased Taobao IR temp scanner.  Will report back later.

Yeah, I have enough people, I am starting to get the parts.  

I have gotten parts for 50 pcs.  So if anyone haven't signed up, you can continue to do so before all material arrives. (in around 2-3 weeks time)

```

---
## \#111 Posted by: Samau18 Posted at: 2018-07-13T04:42:05.815Z Reads: 195

```
From my understanding,
v0.8 is to pull the boot pin to ground.  v0.7 was floating I believe.  Just to make sure it doesn't accidentally pull it to high by soldering flux.  

We cleaned the boards, so shouldn't be any issue.  

Added quote below from Danny from github
"Now tied BOOT0 to GND. This resolves a few isseus where the uC doesn't boot when the PCB is polluted with flux or water."  

So if it doesn't boot, cleaning it helps for v0.7, v0.8 fixed it permanently. 

Pull to On is a firmware feature.  Nothing to do with hardware.

Is really up to Danny (JTAG).

I doubt there are much hardware changes needed.  I would love a cost down version from a manufacturer point of view.. The parts are so expensive.  But then to the buyer it will be a downgrade. 

Batch 3 might be a long time to wait.  Seems like the last few units are moving slowly (I think I have 5pcs to go).

I have linked up an quick instruction at the batch 2 thread (first post). Please go take a look.  Most important thing is to config your pack.  Other than that just wire it up.  

Be careful on polarity, and always use a current control charger to charge. 

Have fun.

The large terminals and balance connector. Theyre pretty massive. They end up making the board really tall. 

I was thinking I could mount the BMS on top of my battery where the old one was but the height makes it too tall and uncomfortably low to the ground. I may get away with making a longer enclosure but if that doesn't work I'll have to get taller risers

Here are some pics.

if you can access the vesc terminal via a mobil-app (I know the Metr App can do it) you can read the cell voltages typing a command like "cell voltages" or something similar. It was mentioned either in this thread or in the original diebiems thread.

Gave you guys a scare, the boards are finished and being tested.  Probably are ready by the end of next week from the looks of things.  I will be sending PayPal invoices next week for batch 2.

Hey I wanted to know, will the DieBieBMS show on its LCD display anything that a Bluetooth module, such as Meter not show in the telemetry?  I was thinking if I connect the canbus cable from the BMS to the VESC's, then that info should transfer over.   Is that right or does it show things that only its display will?

Also, when setting up the canbus from the BMS to the dual ESCape's, do I just splice the wires in to the canbus cable connecting the ESCape's or is it done a different way? 

Thanks for your help!

There are two canbus ports on the diebiems you can just link the two vesc on it and they are all connected afterwards (all three devices).

Oh I never even considered that, that would make it so much easier!  So I can plug both Escape into the BMS and it'll work as if they were plugged in together?

When I go to set up the BMS, would I do this over the VESC tool application and be able to set up all three things (2 ESCape's and BMS)?

Canbus is common, you can go to any of the device and link to the id by canbus forwarding.

Ie vesc1 you can canbus forward to diebiems by id10 and talk to the bms via vesc.  You can connect to vesc 1-2 from bms usb also by typing in the vesc canbus id.

Idk enough about the vesc to know what C37 does to even begin speculating what possibly caused the failure so I can fix it

Hard to crimp the pins onto huge 18awg. I'm thinking 22 or 24 awg if silicone? Plus thinner gauge may hopefully give you a fusing effect if you have a short in the balance leads.

I have the VESC tool connecting and retrieving a firmware version using USB, but I get an error about the firmware being too old (expected?) and the terminal doesn’t return anything with any command (status, cells, etc). It also doesn’t work using another serial terminal. Any ideas?

Separately, what is the pin out for the CAN bus? I looked at the schematic and have 5V, ground, CAN_L and CAN_H all connected to the VESC, what do I do with CAN_ENABLE?

You need to use normal vesc_tool and not ackmaniac version.  In that case diebiems green should read after connection. Commands should start to work.

Can bus is high to high and low to low

Can high to can high
can low to can low
GND to GND 
5V to 5V

And for the push to start:
5V to CANEnable

(Please make absolutely sure you don't connect the 5V to the wrong pin :grin:)

( This is only for connection to a single vesc)

Would that still be possible to do if your running dual VESC's, both connected to a canbus port?  Like, as far as I understand this atm, your saying for push to start you would plug in a canbus cable and just connect essentially loopkey the 5v to CanEnable your saying?

I split my CAN bus cable but the 5v connects from just one VESC to the BMS. Would be enough to power the isolated side of the BMS and prepare for push to start I think the drv won't really like it otherwise

For the two vesc situation just connect them to each other like you normally would (only CANH and CANL).

Also connect the CANH and CANL to the BMS, connect for only one of the VESC's also to GND and 5V to the BMS. 

The GND and 5V of both VESC's should not be connected to each other.

I also received the BMS last week. Thanks @Samau18 for the perfect packaging and shipping! :smiley: 

I see that a WR-MPC3 connector is used for the balance leads and that 20 crimp terminals are already within the package. I don't have the BMS near me right now and would like to order some silicone wires now, but the Würth website tells me there are two types of crimp terminals available. http://katalog.we-online.de/de/em/MPC3_3_00_MALE_CRIMP_TERMINAL_662X0213722
Are the ones we received the ones for 20-24AWG wire or the ones for 26-30AWG wire?

Mine arrived in the US in I think 5-7 days.  Shipping was very fast and zero issues with customs.

So I was planning on connecting both VESC's (dual ESCape's) to the DieBieBMS.  I was going to use a canbus cable with just the two wires for one, and the other cable with all four wires connected.  Is that it, or do we also need to connect the VESC's to each other directly as well?  A bit confused about this aspect, lol.

Yes perfect!

But if you want push to start you should connect the 5V_CAN of the bms also to the Enable_CAN of the bms.

![image|690x229](upload://7SFDKlLx7CmVw6bF1uNfI8oh9oa.png)

So connect pin 1 and 2 together and supply the 5V of the ESC to that. This will enable the BMS and power the isolated can transceiver.

I would not connect this directly to charge your battery, it is a voltage source (fixed votlage) but you'll need a CCCV, Constant Current Constant Voltage device, hence Lithium charger.
- keeps the current fixed and let the voltage increase to 4.2v/cell (50,4v in your case)
- when at max voltage, keep voltage stable, reduce current until ~0. 

this BMS will only monitor and balance your setup, it is not a charge regulator

in case of 12s you would not be able to fully charge with this charger
look for (e.g. at aliexpress) for a "12s lipo charger"

^ definitely some stuff to think about.

The Meanwell ELG I use is a CCCV, but I don't believe the LRS is. Ordinarily this would cause problems for a BMS...

BUT the DieBieMS is no ordinary BMS, it does switch off charging. Watch it while it balances; will do bulk charge at 2a, drop current to 0 while it bleeds the high cells, then repeat. I'm not sure it needs a CCCV charger. I've certainly never seen a charge amperage below 2a (or thereabouts); it's either 2a or 0a (see pic below).

[quote="Arzamenable, post:291, topic:58327"]

[/quote]

Voltage needs to be set a few volts higher than the fully charged voltage, this is something specific to the DieBieMS. Somewhere in one of these threads JTAG mentions why. Your Meanwell will probably do more than 53v (mine does), so I'm pretty sure you'll be fine at 12s too.
```

## \#295 Posted by: willumpie82 Posted at: 2018-09-05T12:44:07.771Z Reads: 156

```
The DieBieMS is indeed a clever BMS, but remember it still won't regulate the charge voltage/current for you. The CV part of CCCV has to be 0.7 volts (series diode drop) higher than the rated pack voltage. but at the other hand, keeping your cells just below 4.2 (for 10s ==> (42v - 0,7v)  / 10 = 4,13v/cell) is actually relaxing your cells and increasing the lifespan

Note that the parameters for balance charging have to be adjusted. 
Normally during balance, the pack is overcharged by e.g. 0,2v/cell, and after that the high cells are discharged (into heat), not sure how DieBieMS does this since it has no control over the charge voltage.

over a regular BMS, this is what DieBieMS add's
- High quality parts
- Highly configurable (cell count and thresholds)
- Open Source
- Connectivity (CAN, USB, wireless (optional) )
- Integrated soft switch & OLED indicator

That meanwell ELG supply looks nice, (expensive but high quality), I just use an Aliexpress and never charge unattended (unattended charging of lithium is a bad idea anyway ;-) )

I want to know why they thought it was needed to hold a package in customs for 29 days without giving any reason.  Is that normal for Germany?  Do they think I'm smuggling in 3g of drugs between the PCB layers?

Now I need to get a charger sorted for it.  Does anyone have any recommendations for a good setup for people in EU?

Thanks for the notes on charger, I saw in the instructions that a CC charger was required. I did not know that CC = CCCV. I have several 12s and 10s lion chargers.


So, Now that I have it all wired up and I want to go and change settings, must I use a 12s pack/power source? The OLED reads bye and flashes a battery crossed out symbol, presumably because the BMSs was programmed last during testing to 12s 3a. 

Am I connecting with the DieBieMSTool wrong?

Sorry if this this has been answered before but I have not really been able to find the answer. How should it be wired if I want to connect my unity to, two(2) diebiems' via the can ports? Also to throw another wrench in the gears push-to-start and smart switch.

My thoughts are to parallel the the Can from the unity to the two diebiems' (canH - canH, canL - canL, 5v - 5v, GND - GND, and the 5v to can enable).  But I feel like that leads to the problem of where to connect the smart power switch. Either the one that came with the unity on the unity, or the one that came with the diebiems' to the diebiems'. If I connect it to the diebiems' I have to disable push-to-start on the unit but might be able to over come that by using the push-to-start from the diebiems'. Otherwise I connect it to the unity but have a hard time understanding how I am able to power it up if the diebiems' aren't on thus no system power.

Also I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this.

Side note, kind of related and further word on the highamps shield? That would totally eliminate the need for this question.
