Hi all,

Since I'm eager to get the new model that sticks to the enclosure I don't need this one anymore. It's the V1, same as V2 with shorter fins:

Price on the website is 60€ for V2 so I'm asking 45€ plus shipping. It's new, never used.

Shipped from Madrid, Spain. 

Cheers,
Pablo

Hey @Frenchy

Sorry I was away on holidays :slight_smile:

I checked online and the estimate is 30€/35$... not so bad, I expected more. 

Let me know if you are still interested!
