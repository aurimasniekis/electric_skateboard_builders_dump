Selling my lacroix Nazare. (I have 2) the deck is super wide, too wide for my taste. Itâ€™s a good board for really rural areas, with open space, but Iâ€™m in a a city with lots of foot traffic, and itâ€™s just too big and heavy to maneuver around the way Iâ€™d like to. Itâ€™s opened and slightly used. Prolly 5 miles. Selling it for 3000 obo. Hit me up, here or bryabee3@yahoo.com

Thanks 
Bryan

On1y is a good guy. There was a mistake with communication, Brian didn't have his phone and I didn't understand that the person communicating with me had changed. Anyway all good. The board is sick. No idea how people get it up to top speed.

Please at least edit the message saying he's a scammer as well, someone might just skim it while scrolling to the bottom ðŸ˜…

I wish I could afford a nazare ðŸ˜‚
