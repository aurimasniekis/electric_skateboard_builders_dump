And TB with their 110...

110mm wheel, kegel core the same color as the road dust that covers your wheel cores after you ride them.  So, like dark grey-ish.  Wheel itself some neon color.

No offence to @Hummie at all but after the discussions in the other post I feel we'd need to cut him out of any community wheel we develop.

It's clear people want a bigger wheel. Thoughts @Hummie ?

I ride on really rough roads, I might be on these during the Barrett Junction event in socal too. That road is like a jigsaw puzzle. Ride quality has a lot to do with how pliant the lip of the wheel is. Going for more of a race wheel than anything else though so keep that in mind.

My issue out of interest is pavement transitions, debris from trees and actual holes.

I live in England, I ride over some pavements that are quite literally older than the American constitution :smiley: I rode 90mm wheels for a while and felt unsafe at anything above a crawl on any road I didn't know well enough to anticipate. On 107 I don't really think about it, just keep an eye out and go.

There is the hole right there if you ask me.  Better core design. Non chunking.  My Popocas have been through a world of shit and they are still prestine.

My 107s are chunked to hell in 50 mile, all the while gluing all the cuts.

110mm Popocas... Abec who?

Admittedly, the 76mm wheels are more to get DH riders into the idea of racing on electric. Low and quick on acceleration. A good analogy would be a cafe racer vs a full dresser. But we always get a few blems that we give away when we have wheels made. Be happy to send those to a few people!

I was against Trampa for a long time after the VESC debate, but eventually one gets tired of low quality MBS parts and I wanted hubs that could work with urethane and pneumatics alike. So far I'm impressed just with the looks, we'll see what happens when I take them to SF for a ride.

[/quote]

After runing 107mm, 97mm and 8" pneumatics, runing 85mm Caguamas is very rewarding, I don't know it might be the variety but smaller wheels have a nice appeal for me a the moment because of:

Soft compound 77A
Make esk8s really light
Quick acceleration with a small light battery
2:1 reduction possible with plenty of final speed
Easy to mall grab it, convenient
Very close to the ground
A lot of decks to choose from
The esk8 looks awesome
No wheelbite at all even with no risers and loose carvy trucks
The smaller the wheel the wider they look, wider wheels looks amazing

All in all, I'd like to see a 85mm kegel type of wheel in orange with a 77A compound, that won't chunk, offsetted but with a wider contact patch wider than Caguamas, wider wheels at the back and narrower at the front like a RWD BMW.

Can someone do that? They would be super sellers

That's what I'm thinking too! Not sure what color yet but white has always been a favorite for the DH crew. Here is the current sample with 32 tooth pulleys

For the core, I'm not sure if you mean that as the mounting option for wheel drive, or like the actual wheel core.

For Actual wheel core design, I'd look at the stuff Seismic has been putting out.
They've been making some really great wheel cores lately.

You can keep the ABEC style cutouts, and Speed Vent style core if you want.

I have 107mm wheels on a shortboard without cutouts with no wheel bite.  "Wheel bite" is a excuse put forth by those who favor smaller wheels.  You can always add a tiny riser which really doesn't affect much -- if you're not kick-pushing, it doesn't matter how far away the ground is.

The facts are some folks prefer small wheels -- and that's fine, there are no reasons to make excuses.

But most prefer larger ones.

 A low center of gravity has other benefits besides pushing.  A 107mm wheel with low trucks and no riser often won’t fit.  Low to the ground is a common appeal.

Alot of this seems to stem from people thinking ABEC wheels aren't available right now anywhere which is far from the truth...

Along with it comes with the Wallmart/Amazon mentality that @mmaner mentions frequently and that I'm beginning to understand.

It's more a long term issue, we've seen absolute droughts for these wheels for months at a time. We're being charged through the asshole for them as well.

The Poll is loaded too, those sizes are all currently available, I know there's an "other" option but most people will just select one they know, that one clearly being the biggest. If there was a 110 option I am willing to bet it would be the highest selected.

All of this, mixed with the ABEC website being down for over a year (and more before that), zero real contact with Chris and this crap that @JLabs is going through with the spud decks makes me not want to give ABEC any of my money.

A less expensive, big, black wheel sourced by our community and available when we need it? Yes please.

@brenternet the poll is not loaded I just couldn't list every size.  I did say if you picked other please say what it would be and there hasn't been a load of people saying 110mm - only 6% chose other and half chose sizes under 107mm so its not as clear cut as you say.

For what its worth I also think a 110mm wheel would be awesome, not sure about black but happy to have black.  500 Wheels is only 125 sets.  It would be possible to sell those I think....

These ones are made in the USA. A **TON** better than the current offerings which we have now. They also benefit our direct drive setup so wanted to go with a higher quality kegel core wheel. @b264 has been testing it. So far has been great with no chunking.

Sorry don't want to push the thread off-topic. I think it helps to know though in-case you guys do plan on going a similar route we don't get people making the exact same wheels and we are able to enjoy a wider range of variety in products. If you want too, fine with me.. Just my 2 cents. :smile:

I dont want to see a fucking abec core on black urethane that is 107 mm that already exists and yes it is a good chunk of change but lets get something different like a kegel core which alot of wheels are coming out with or have been out ie boa wheels, popoca, ahmoy, and the different otang wheels and do a 107mm in a color other than black and for the people that say I want a stealth board shut up because you will be wishing you didnt have a stealth board when you get tag because you are on a completely dark board with no lights at night.  Nothing wrong with a little pop of color like blue or red.  A nice tiffany blue wheel would be really nice.

Sorry been confused and writing in the wrong thread.  I’ll get a solid price on the molds and cost of production too by next week and see who wants to go in on it.
I wrote tony there and for the cost of 500 91x78mm!!!! Haha.  You’ll grow to love it.  The idea that “it’s been done”  isn’t the case.  This is a wheel like double the width of a normal wheel to begin with and center set versatility **with rounded edges** cause we figured that out. And this is the best rubber out there. I’m sure designing a pulley for it would be no problem and could cast it out of aluminum or print it whatever.  Wouldn’t fit other systems but adaptable if u really wanted to.  And why would you want to adapt? Because the wheels would be the best and we’d get them and ultimately likely end up selling them super cheap ourselves with the free market.  But we’d be in the market with the best stuff out there. There’s a whole regular skate market out there too.  I just want to ride the wheels and see what happens with the community organizing enough to pool their money to do it.  And then we’d have 100 molds to do future pours whenever we pooled the bucks to do so.  Syched to see prices. Sadly I’m totally addicted to them over all other rubber.

And costs are looking much cheaper than expected.  Like 2/3 what I said earlier.  If u want to do this give me a like on this post and I’ll assume ur willing to add 500$ maybe towards the goal!  I’m really syched on this.  Screw other companies we can make our own.

There are some areas that have gaps that a 90mm wheel will just fall right into, I don't even attept to cross those even with my 107s but 6 shooters just keep rolling I haven't been able to stop them yet lol

Still waiting on pulleys for Venom Magnums.

Basically the modern day Centrax with a vented core. Grips better and costs less too.

only 78mm diameter though.  83 for the centrax.    but wide wheels do a lot for smoothing you think?  @briman05 what core you want?  I think the kegel-like with the round holes is safest.

5mm isn’t going to change much for a wheel. We started on 80mm for when esk8 began taking off. Adding 3mm or taking away 2mm isn’t going to make a huge performance difference. What matters at that point is how well the wheels stick and roll over rough terrain, in which the Venoms Magnums excel at.

was wondering how you think the width helps.   an 85mm wheel that's 80mm wide in my experience does a lot to smoothen

There’s hardly any benefit of “smoothing” with wider wheels. That’s like expecting wider trucks to make a ride more stable. It doesn’t. Durometer has a larger impact on “smoothness” over contact patch. A wider contact patch is all about having that grip in high speed, high lean scenarios. 


Ideally you should be rail matching any wheel and truck setup to ensure optimal turn responsiveness and grip. This is a friend’s setup, who is 10x the rider I am.

This isn't always true.  Some things like streetplates, only diameter matters -- not stickiness or contact patch.  Other things like railroad level-crossings - only contact patch matters, not diameter or stickiness.

5mm of diameter can make a huge difference for me.  Many folks need many different wheels.

An 85mm Caguama rides nicer than a Kegel for sure, but between two different wheels (with two different formulas) it’s not going to be a night and day difference losing 5mm when you have a superior urethane that’s better designed to deflect and contort to absorb larger hazards.

It’s interesting you bring up construction plates, because they’re all over here where I’m at, thanks to the city hiring (unavoidably shoddy) construction crews to redo our roads. I’ve had a long time getting acquainting with those types of roads stuffed with these hazards and found that updated urethane does indeed play a major role in how well your wheels can take on those plates.

Grey kegel core 95mm with the same contact patch as the 107mm. 
If the normal size contact patch of 97mm flywheels is preferred I’ll take that. 

One more color option would be camouflage grey if that works.

Oh I forgot to mention the colour of the core needs to be red for extra speed.

They have a “house” core that is similar to the kegel but with the round prongs only going the full way through on half of them and the other 3 don’t come out the other side.   Different but totally workable and a pulley can be designed to transfer the torque no problem.   Using this core mold saves a lot and we’d only need to get the main molds made and at a 91x79mm roller they’re estimating 6000$ before taxes,shipping and it could fluctuate with aluminum cost.  And then a wheel that size..._that monster roller size with a higher chunk of primo pu....12$ to 15$ each with the minimum of 500_

Fuck yea.  

That’s the shape I’m going for. It’s not everyone’s ideal and everyone has different wants but this is a center set chunk so need to fit a deck and going bigger gets harder.  Besides I actually like 84mm anyway.

So what happens if you have an entire batch made and you're not happy with the polyurethane?  I think you need to test it first and have prototypes in different climates (read as: NOT southern/western California)

Or you could buy wheels from a company that has already made sure the molds are good, tested the polyurethane formulas, worked out the kinks in manufacturing, and taken the risks for you, and just pay them a few extra dollars for all the effort and risk.

Or you can gamble that your entire group buy amount will be spent on wheels that you can't use, because you skipped all that trying to save $5.

Or you can start your own wheel company.  But making a group buy for a new wheel seems overly risky and extremely unlikely to yield a world-class result.  We already have cheap china clones if you want "Meh" wheels.

Of course it’s not a new pu chemistry and already tested.  You really think all of a sudden they’re going to throw 💩 in the molds of arguably the best pu producer in the world?

So 6k for the mold, plus 500x15$= 7.5k that's 13.5k

Add to that taxes and shipping and we are at 15k minimum, but probably more. 

So that's 30ppl with 500$ each... Are there enough people that are interested in this? 

And we are talking about 84mm wheels if I understood correctly?

I don't know how much more it would cost to make larger diameter, but I think it would increase interest in this whole idea, since it is what most people are riding here.

BTW making new thread with correct title would help also, "community wheel poll" is way off topic that is discussed atm.
