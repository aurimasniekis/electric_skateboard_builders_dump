Hi, I have been working on a 2 gear and a 3 gear system gear drive. Mostly discussed with people in private messages and few teaser here in there. But I decided that I should stop designing and start making.

I have worked on a 2 gear drive which I also plan to use for more budget builds since using 2 gears is a little bit cheaper than using 3 gears since there are a lot less parts and engineering involved.**

2 Gear System vs 3 Gear System

![image|690x161](upload://4sIAwBbH2ghLsiaTye0slIbTPjw.png)   

**For pricing I hope to sell this for under $250 for a dual drive. Whilst the 3 gear system will be slightly higher since it probably includes 4-5 more individual parts**

I will show pictures of both just to start a discussion, but I plan on start testing and manufacturing the 2 gear system just because of simplicity. There are much less work involved when sourcing parts for this gear drive compared to the 3 gear system. So I think its a good way to test the market and gain experience with something that I know will be rock solid.

The 3 Gear system **heavily experimental right now** @uigiroux is my companion for this particular design

@Eretron thanks for picking up the parts

![image|374x500](upload://lo3TZlT1ngLdEZ14n462W5JUlxN.jpeg)

The gears are at home waiting for me to be picked up and then modified for proper testing! The only thing stopping for this one is the 1 week wait for the modified gears. I can hopefully be riding in the next couple of weeks

2 Gear system (3d printing as we speak).

But need to test fitment as soon as that gets done I will work with @AreaKruzer to help provide a solid gear drive. I have designed it for TKP and caliber trucks in mind

And I have probably discussed with many people of PM. @Grozniy @skunk @brenternet @bigben

FIY, the way I have designed things for the 2 gear drive it means that SR TKP truck requires one less part which is nice :D

I'm quite curious what the reasoning and possible benefits/ disadvantages the three gear design has compared to the 2 gear
```

## \#5 Posted by: moon Posted at: 2018-10-29T07:00:59.649Z Reads: 472

```
The disadvantages are unexplored, no one else has done it. I am doing it for science.

But the benefits are discussed my other topic, I will dig some of the points out

1. Wheel clearance - can use on smaller wheels, yeah I know a lot of people don't use the smaller wheels but theres still people out there. Like on 107mm wheels the clearance is over 2cm

2. You can mount the motors both ways

I will dig more points out but thats the main point

Well I'm definitely following the progress of this. I'm highly interested in more options for surf rod trucks.
If you ever need a 200 pound American who rides a skateboard between 3 job 6 days a week on crappy roads to test drive, I'm your guy lol

## \#8 Posted by: moon Posted at: 2018-10-29T07:15:22.352Z Reads: 445

Yeah of course :smiley:

The surfordz version is actually easier to make. So once we have the gears figured out,the clamp for the surfrodz can be made, we'll make a couple and see who wants to test. Think some guys in the UK would also like to test

RKP is also possible but I would 100% need those trucks with me to test.

As I said in pm moon, I'd be happy to chuck some miles on the drive to test it, I'm sure Ben would too but he can tell you.

If you want me to make the parts myself just shoot the files over (if you're comfortable sharing) 

We'd be on SR tkps

Tkp is the way forward for now. If you can make one part for your self that will be good. It's essentially the clamp for the truck and the bearing shaft combined. I will send you the files when I know the measurements are correct

You can be the dummy if you can do that. I can send the rest of the stuff that you need

If the 3 gear drive is longer, this means that the clamp has to be wider to compensate?
Also, shouldn't 3 gear drive be much more reliable due to less force on each gear? Or I might be totally wrong

Don't know, testing will tell

Also with the 3 gear drive, the footprint is like the same size as a typical motor mount that doesnt have idlers. And has a total width of 25mm.

Looks good! As always, I'm happy to try to 3d print some parts and test it out on TB218's if you want to share the STL's.

Anyone ever make a "Dyno" for bench testing? That could be useful for finding out drivetrain losses...

77mm to 85mm speed vent core you can basically get any type of mixes of different duro and mixed thanes he uses for certain application of riding ..really sweet ass wheels and he makes different colour and different colour cores all the time .. you can get him to make a wheel to your preference also ..

Seismic wheels. Core is called "speed vent".

Seismic will do custom orders with duro and colour changes depending on what you want.

Here's a speed vent core on 85mm:

so how does one secure the gear on the motor shaft if a particular motor doesnt have a key way? or is it a keyway motor only? and even then back to original question of keeping gear on shaft?

and then on the same turn how would one remove the gear if theres a motor issue/swap/upgrade? I know ive had stuck pulleys that are a bitch to get off and with what looks like no decent access to put a screw driver or something to pry it off?

these are just question in my mind as Ive been checking out gear drives across the board but maybe have missed this bit somewhere in other threads. thx

I will probably do something like this when I start selling, in the meantime it will be just keyways because it is just simple to deal with

Right now we are the fitment stage. Just making sure that the gears I chose were  good and the rest of the design works. We'll be printing v2 tomorrow/today and that fixes things that I got wrong in the first design. It was only a couple of little things.

The gears for the real thing will be steel for the motor gear and probably POM for the wheel. If not steel for both. For testing purposes I will probably choose both steel for simplicity. 

The case I haven't decided, I will 3D print it until I am certain.. but a CNC aluminum case will be great. But of course that increases costs a little bit so need to factor that in

I get told sure by cnc shops then I bring the wheel and my adapter from my carvon drive and they say nope ..lol.. no one wants to design it..there isn't a sole out here in the eskate world that has a pully or a wheel adapter for any type of drive so these wheels.

Man I wondered when someone would explore the 3 gear option.  As well as lowering the profile of the drive it also provides a safety valve of sorts.  With gear drives there is the real possibility of damaging esc's and motors with too much force.  In rc cars there is always an idler gear between the spur and pinion.  It usually is made of a softer material and is the first thing to fail (in a good way) when the gears are put under too much pressure.  This in turn saves the more expensive parts in the driveline.  Imo just the next logical step forward in gear drives so good on you for being the first.  Going to follow this avidly.

The 3 gear version has changed only a little bit. Most of the concept stayed the same. The 2 gear version is something that will be easier to design and test since there's not much that can go wrong, the next version of 3D prints will hopefully be done on Thursday, I hope this is the last version too since I have ironed out the mistakes and design flaws in the previous version

I'm just a little slow at getting things going sometimes. I often find I design something and then there's no progress after that. But most of my Saturday with an ultimaker v2. And like I said I have a couple parts in the post and shafts and bearings and some carbon fiber stuff that I will pick up next Saturday

The biggest change will be moving away from carbon fiber motor plate and to a aluminum motor plate. I will need to make that in the next few weeks

It's the same with the 2 gear system too

I think @PXSS is eventually going to make a hub adapter for carvon DD for the speed vents.

When he does this I may ask for 3D files so my gear drives can work with that. Depends if he is ok with that

Does the motor have to be adjustable Since there is no belt to tighten?
If the motor is fixed position, the fit will be always perfect between gears, right?

The wheel gear is the only gear in the 3 gear system that is fixed and cannot be moved.

The middle gear can be adjusted side to side and so can the motor gear

So you can adjust backlash between gears

Yes @moon I have been picking @PXSS on it. Actually both of you really at the same time. I started with him first because I have a v4 speeddrive and and two torquedrives coming when who knows ..but then I see your 3 gear drive and that is exactly what I'm looking for as a single light lil commuter build with small wheels..

Yes we are in the mixes with trying to get more wheels available for the eskate world. unfortunately it still all talks  he is in the game but we are hoping to persuade him over to the diy game or ateast some bigger wheels and make the hub sleeves bigger on his hub truck set up hopefully for the people that want bigger. I'm set with 85 nice and light and very semetrical looking like a skatboard not a penny Tonka truck.. personal preference.. But I'll tell you now these ride waaay better then a 90 abec I think. there is more thane and less core and the core is designed to actually do things like mushroom the wheel out for larger contact patch at speeds plus cool the bearing and the wheel down at high speeds. Trust me these are the wheels we need they are lighter then the average wheel also as I've been told. North American made ..but I don't have a scale to actually test tho. It would  be nice to weigh all the different wheels out to actually see tho.

If you had to estimate the final retail price for the 3 gear urethane drive, in what ballpark would that be? Thinking if a single drive would be cheaper than, say, elofty's direct drive. (I'm so fed up with belts at the moment xD)

Yeah no switching gears mid ride.  That's not what gear drive means. 
It has gears transferring energy from the motors to the wheels rather than belts.
One set gear ratio. Just like belts.

I actually made a post about this, but there was a really cool concept for a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) drive system for an Esk8.  Do a search I think I'm like one of the only results for it, but it works similar to how mopeds can employ this tech.  Still,  I don't think it's feasible for Esk8, at least not yet...
