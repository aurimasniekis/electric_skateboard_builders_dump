As some may know I live in AZ and it it about to get HOT.

I don't really feel comfortable riding my board at 100+ degrees.

So I am designing a whole water cooled board with a temp sensor that will cut power when I exceeds a certain temperature.

This is my battery concept. All wires will be external as will the BMS. 
The Idea is to cover the battery in thin pipes or tubes and then to pour Heat conductive silcone over it.

I'm new to anything watercooled, can you explain how this works? How does the water running through the tubes take away that heat energy?

It will go to a radiator.

I got some heat conductive silicone.  not as strong as regular silicone and it's like half as conductive as the Lord stuff which seems the best but expensive.  if the cells have a release valve for gas, which I think most do, don't jam it with the goo.  Ive heard those vents open and wonder what would've happened if they didn't.

never thought to cool the battery though and was doing the motor but thought of sinking cells in resin a lot.  the silicone is like molding silicone, at least the one I have, so it wont stick to the cells or the wrapper.  I'll be sinking cells part way in polyurethane to hold them

why not just make something like a pc heat sink and put that on the batteries?
if the pipes somehow leak, boooom

It would all be covered in silicon so even if the tubes leak no boom.

IMO its easier to work with solids than liquids when trying to cool stuff down, yea it would be super cool but is the complexity worth the results, you would need a pump, radiator, pipes, voltage regulator...

you actually just dump water over everything and it cools down.

I'd run it with the temp sensor on a super hot day. Just to see if you are getting close to hot battery temps.  If you are I would first consider reducing the max battery amps before adding a large water cooled system.  However a working system would be nice.

I was planning on doing this but shelved as I live in a temperate climate at best.

Consider taking a lot of the effort out and buy a couple of tesla loops from someone breaking a pack..there are breakers on ES & eBay of course. Cut to desired length. Hobbyking kit could be adapted boat kit with pump and radiator maybe or water cooling kit for a PC...some good 12v pumps there.

Water wetter with corrosion inhibitors

Water cooling and radiators do not like vibrations. I had a half broken pc fan that was rattling my radiator and it caused a leak. So putting it on a skateboard is sketch, but if you do it correctly, it would be bad ass. Get some serious "glue", like liquid cement or something. Definitely use liquid metal as thermal paste.

Better yet lets get some peltiers

i like passive cooling much more.  heat pipes are very diy able and really effective.   just tubing with water under a vacuum...and that's it.

I keep looking at this but...

All the serious E-motor bikes/cars have water cooled everything, controllers, batteries & motors. Passive or air cooled seems enough though for us, even with big loads (up hill even, get a couple 1kg plus motors, no need to cool them then.)
That said I have a plan in the works to clamp heat sinks to some lipos to try and squeeze as much output as I can out of them. Motors are already finned and air cooled, controllers are heat sink-ed as well with fans so...

As JensoBro would say "cool as a penguin" :sunglasses:

I agree with @banjaxxed on looking into Tesla loops, that would definitely be interesting!

Radiators from a traditional vehicle like a small motorbike are made to withstand quite a lot of abuse (more so than the very thin walled PC type), they are rubber mounted, even so a leak is a possibility from the rad, just ensure a hole in the rad will not spill on electronics and you have a switch to turn off the pump....then you can just keep going

I'm not sure if a motorcycle radiator is going to be the right choice for an Esk8. I don't have a lot of experience with them, but they seem quite big for a board. Low profile radiator seems like a must.

Yep!

![IMG_4963|666x500](upload://2fJaXQLQL0ZHvuu86p4BaV4pFCn.JPG)

A kx65 or rm65 has a pretty small radiator. 
Other bikes to search would be 
Cr80
Ktm 50sx

Oil coolers are even smaller and would work I think.

straight distilled water, with water wetter (a surfactant) will work the best.

Oil coolers have a wall that is too thick, an additive needs to be used if using water wetter or straight h2o

Like this
https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F152375410510

Actually that weight aton in context of esk8,maybe a PC rad would be better for choice/cost, put a guard on it if debris could hit it

I think the first step before designing a cooling system is actually to just do temperature logging.

Get a bunch of temp sensors, an arduino, maybe see if it can log amperage draw and other stuff too.

Figure out how much heat you'll be needing to move, and where.

Once you figure that out it will become pretty clear what radiator you'll need, or if you'll be able to rely on passive solutions like heat pipes.

Hey I'm in Phoenix. I actually had a mishap during the middle of the summer cause of the heat. Ran it till my 4.12 vesc till it overheated.

Normal mosfet can't take the heat for shit. Direct fets make a huge difference though. I get much harder acceleration out of my focboxes even in cooler temperatures. Even on a single drive they fare well in the heat.

In my second build, I used metal enclosures in boosted board style with a vesc connected to one case with thermal paste. Haven't gotten to test it in the summer heat though.

As for dealing with the heat yourself, keep moving. The wind really does help. 


Also there was a previous thread with ideas for air cooling.

Seems like cooling pipes zig zag across battery followed by a exposed PC cooling radiator with a small pump.

Those still really need to be used with a heat sink, it can't pull away any more heat than it can radiate out.

And instead of buying a whole assembled product that you need to tear apart, you can just buy the peltier elements themselves for much cheaper.

I've been planing a watercooled board proof of concept for a while (I used to wc pc's back in 2004 before all the 'kits' arrived) this is vaguely what I was thinking...

for rad was thinking something as small as this (with custom enc. designed for airflow) 
https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alphacool-NexXxoS-Copper-Single-radiator/dp/B01A9L2NQI?th=1

for res and pump I think the only way to go is a combined unit
https://www.overclockers.co.uk/xspc-ion-all-in-one-pump-reservoir-wc-399-xs.html

but I do have a couple of these lying around that I THINK might just survive the vibration

watercooling is so bulky... so many components and very many failure points. i thought people like slender builds. Or are we talking about exchanging battery volume for all the required components?

I am with @Hummie on this one, passive heat pipes are awesome. You could even reuse some from old laptops or PC's and have a sick looking kit without fearing a spill or pump failure or whatever else.
