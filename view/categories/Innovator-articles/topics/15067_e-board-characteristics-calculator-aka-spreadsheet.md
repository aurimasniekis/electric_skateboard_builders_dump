What's up gals and guys,


I want to share with you this little tool I made to calculate some basic properties of electric longboards. As I just learned from looking around this forum, it is similar to what @EnderWiggin did. Just...way less extensive than his. And I used different approaches.

It's all in SI units. Here's a screenshot:

I would be very happy to get suggestions on how to improve it. Or on which of the used approaches make sense and which ones don't.


The spreadsheet is here:

Hope to hear soon from you!
