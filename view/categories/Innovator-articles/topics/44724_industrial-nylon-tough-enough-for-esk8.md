Hey esk8 family. I know I ask a million questions, but I'm trying out an industrial nylon filament and wondering what eskate parts it would be useful for. It's just a sample but it's said to be very strong so maybe I'd get a spool in the future depending on its usefulness.

Yours truly, 
The inquisitive one

for what.. 3D printing? if so, it may make a decent wheel pulley. Could definitely make some bumpers, or special risers for wire management. head light holders... belt covers... wire managment devices inside the box.. a sectional enclosure...

youre all about printing these days.  i was looking at the nylon and think if you get it filled with carbon it will have greater stiffness which might be needed for pulleys but maybe good already.   its strong but I dont think very stiff and will not break but bend

ive got a spool of high heat resistant pla if anyone is interested from protopasta.  my machine seems to work best with only abs.   

but if you want to make really strong parts make a silicone mold from the print and cast carbon or fiberglass and resin.  I've made mounts like that where you stick the hanger into the silicone mold and pour it.  you could make anything strong with a mold and a filled resin.

I finally got the nylon to actually print today. I wasted a bunch of it, and gave it about a week break. Tried today and it's printing fabulous lol. And since I'm not going the cnc Pulley way, I figured I'd try in nylon. I'm accident prone so I didn't want to make it my solution.

Lol. I need to make the bobble head. But that could probably be done with cheaper filament.

18650 cell holders is a nice one.  

but making a silicone mold for a pulley out of a nicely polished print could be a great longterm solution and you could maybe even make a simple one-part mold.

not the nylon.  but if you design and print it and make a mold from the print for sure will work.  I did it with no screws and with the hanger put into the silicone mold and then pour and pop out the hanger with the mount on it.  really liked it.  not very adjustable but solid and looks really cool with a translucent resin and swirls of carbon and gold kevlar

Nylon should be fine.  Just make sure you use enough perimeters to ensure a strong part.

pretty much.  the details are easy.  with such a simple part and able to do it as a one-part mold makes it much easier. 
check out smooth-on.com or bjbenterprises' videos.  Troy is a member here, pylonflier I think, and he does bjb's videos.  fun stuff.

For the swappable battery enclosure on my board, they switched from ABS to nylon for the top piece, shown in the pic. The rest of the enclosure is anodized aluminum. This nylon piece is pretty tough. Much stronger than the ABS which broke previously.

I had to get towards the end to find the enclosure. I actually put together a box yesterday that I was thinking about wrapping in fiberglass. I was going to line the inside edges in wood, now I'm thinking I could probably print something. Insert some t-bolts (?) in them and put screws in from the top of the board straight into the enclosure. ![20180126_155512|341x500](upload://gaOVvsAB7DzwNkqB0IJGxG9sqRu.jpg)

Yeah typically with nylon you want to dry it out like crazy because it has a high tendency to absorb a lot of moisture.  If you see any steam coming out of the nozzle while you're printing it's really bad because the little pockets of steam will make your print bumpy and make the layers not adhere well.  Depending on the specific nylon formula it's more or less of a problem but good to either keep the stuff in a dehumidifier (food ones I've seen used) or put it in an oven for like 6 hours at 200 degrees F.  Only issue with the oven is the spool probably isn't made of nylon if you have a full spool so you want to just cut off as much as you expect to print with (plus extra just in case) and then dry that out off the spool (or else you end up with warped spool and probably nasty fumes in your place).  You also typically need to print at much slower speeds with it for the extruder to keep up and for everything to be nice and solid... would just do some small test prints so you can stress test them to see what they can handle.

Wheel pulleys should be fine I made a few motor pulleys one held up for a few months and eventually tore through the part where I put the locking screws through it the teeth were fine.

I currently run nothing but Nylon printed wheel pulleys. 200 miles and no sign of wear. It's a little tough to get it to stick to the print bed but AIrwolf3d makes some pretty good print bed stuff specifically for Nylon. I get cheap Nylon filament from Micro Center. It only comes in Natural.

It was a sample so it wasn't on a spool. Also it was packaged in a sealed bag with those drying things that come in shoes. I've wasted probably 1/5th of the roll due to sticking issues. But thanks for the advice. I wish I asked for advice before attempting to print it.

I'm using Alloy 910 from Taulman and although i don't have experience printing pure nylon, i didn't run into the typical nylon related problems at all. I can only recommend this filament.

Storing it in a sealed container with rice or even cat litter "unused of course" will soak up any moisture.

@Sapphirinia what 3d printer do you use? And are you using a nylon print for the motor pulley or just the wheel pulley. 
I've been thinking of purchasing some PC-MAX filament to test some motor pulleys, but need to build an enclosure for my CR-10S so i have a fighting chance.

I have the monoprice Maker select v2. I only made the wheel pulley. Basically using the same motor Pulley that I was using before. I have the all-metal hotend and glass bed.

I'm literally taking home my 3D printer today so just starting this stuff.
If you do ever experiment with filaments and find anything worth mentioning, please do, after watching many youtube videos and reading lots of marketing spiel from manufacturers, i think the way to go will be Nylon, PC or carbonyte for high strength and durability. PETG possibly for other stuff (maybe wheel pulleys as well.....maybe).

Award will be given for making a motor pulley, which at the moment doesn't seem possible (it will work, but not for very long)

My bet would still be Alloy 910 Filament, which is a nylon blender with polycarbonate. I printed a Benchy with it once and could not manage to permanently damage it in any way. Super tough stuff.
