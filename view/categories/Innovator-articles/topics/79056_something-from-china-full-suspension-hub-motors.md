Looks pretty damn cool, I like the wheels. He went right up that 30 degree slope. I bet it weighs 40 lbs. though.

I think @mmaner will have to look into these. Then he will probably give them as a gift next year for secret Santa

Well, full suspension requires at least some appreciation I would think.

But they never show how good the turning radius is on that. They only do drifting and even then they need to even pull on the damn thing with their hands.

Why does it deserve appreciation?  Look at the mechanics.

Look at it properly.  A whole lot of unnecessary stuff in there and the concept is not theirs.

yes my dude, the freaking concept of a double wishbone suspension has been around since 1930's.

teach me master, what is looking properly and what is unnecessary ?

Why are you being antagonistic?  The concept of double wishbone suspension has indeed been around since 1930 and was first introduced by one of the most innovative car companies in the world.  The point I was making was that the wishbone concept aligned to a lean truck was not theirs.  Someone else did that first and much simpler. 
This is your brother or something built this hey?

Give you a clue.  Look at the linkages.

Well shit, by that reasoning all shoes are illegal and stealing from Mesopotamia back in the BC time from the first time some one wrapped a dead animal carcass around their foot. I'm gonna sue.

I agree with @dareno, there's alot of useless crap in these trucks that can be done without.

you misunderstand. I dont give a shit if this is a copy and who made it. 

what i am annoyed by is people who come in and drop "clues" instead of outputing something useful. Concept not theirs? Ok, who the hell made it, maybe people wanna know? Unnecessary stuff? Ok great, explain to the plebs wtf you are talking about. Thats my issue here, not being protective or any of that sissy shit.

I would quite happily have gone through it with you had you not been a dick.  You're still being one.
The linkages attached to the steering knuckles are redundant as are the steering knuckles themselves and double wishbone suspension on an esk8 is the remit of Baja board who by a strange coincidence moved their production to china last year and low and behold...
![image|300x162](upload://oWpMGIptDNWPx0kWcQhXxE3RH9H.jpeg) 

The first point you would have been able to work out yourself if you opened your eyes and the second with a quick google search.
Good day Sir.  Oh and don't be a dick

From my experience, trying to design a board like a reduced scale car leads to an expensive/complicated/heavy/(don't even mention maintenance) vehicle that steers poorly and get a lot of speed wobble...
