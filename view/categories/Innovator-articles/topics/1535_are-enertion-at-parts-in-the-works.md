Continuing the discussion from [The Village Build | S9 Faultine | Paris 195mm | SK3 6764 | DIYES Mount | 8S | VESC | 127mm Pneumatic Wheels](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-village-build-s9-faultine-paris-195mm-sk3-6764-diyes-mount-8s-vesc-127mm-pneumatic-wheels/292/30):

the problem you may have with belt drive & off road is little rocks and sticks getting inside the pulley teeth.

that's why i stopped making all terrain wheels that require a belt drive.

I'm interested in this also. Some of the roads are so bad here in sf, that I feel using inflatable tires would make riding at higher speeds much safer. I have found the best routes possible but I still have to take a few blocks of really bad road quality to get to my university.

Yes, they are, but Raptors are taking priority at the moment. 

We have been testing some different wheel sizes, but don't yet have an eta on when they will be released.
