Hi Everyone. My name is Xavi and I am the guy behind this project, and also new to this forum. I will now reply to the comments made so far, and try to keep up with newer ones. Please also feel free to write me directly if you want at xavi.garcia [at] larevolta.com (La Revolta is the name of the company, Traqpod is the name of the product). 

Regards from sunny Barcelona.

Hi Danile.

The patented Traqpod truck has several functions. It allows for the trucks to fold back underneath the deck (bringing the total length of the product down to 70 cm from around 92 cm unfolded. I has safe locking mechanisms for both end positions, folded and unfolded. So no "wiggling" in either position (just developing this feature was a total pain in the a$$). The connection point of the two articulated parts features a rubber shock absorber. Very neat, really. As for the rest, it's really like it's shown in the GIFs above or on our website. We are kickstarting sometime this summer.

Yes and no. The trucks have two stable positions: folded and unfolded. But the rubber shock absorber can (and will) potentially be made in different thicknesses (and hardness levels). This will impact on several features of the whole skateboard: deck hight and turning radius. But I think the standard shock absorber we use will be OK for most everyone. Its a rather low riding skateboard.

Hi all,

I'm at my reply limit so let me use this to answer everyone. But remember I can't reply anymore on this same topic, so feel free to start a new one or just write me.

- It will not be a fad. I can't guarantee it will not be a total craze like the so-called hoverboards, the iphone or sliced bread.

- Out of Spain: you may be surprised to learn that there are, to my knowledge, THREE electric skateboard companies in Barcelona alone.

- Bushings: that's sooo 20th century... The Trapqod is a completely new truck system. Every single part (but basic screws and washers) has been custom designed. 

- Designed by non-skaters: that hurt, man :) But you may be right. Although my father got me my first Sanchesky skateboard when I was 12, I can't really identify as a typical skater. This means I'm a non-typical skater. Let's leave it at that.

Cheers

Xav

It's not spam! Welcome

I signed up for future updates.

Assume the remote control is regular 2.4Ghz radio control and Bluetooth is an app for telemetry? There is concerns for using Bluetooth to directly control the Esc 

Speaking of ESCs, what are you using there & what cells, how many?

**edit:** Lithium Ion, 36 V, 6,6 Ah
8 to 14 km (5.0 to 8.7 mi)**

The remote is 2.4 GHz indeed, which is the EM spectrum frequency range called Bluetooth. We don't have and will not have an app. The remote is fine and our lives are complicated enough without yet another app. Seriously, for control purposes it wouldn't work. For other functions it may be OK.

We have tested several ESCs, motors and battery configurations, and keep in touch with manufacturers on their developments. Final components and specs will released a bit further down the line.

@mutantbass, thank you!

The Traqpod ABSOLUTELY was inspired by the Streetcarver (of which I own half a dozen). Back in 2002 the Streetcarver changed my life and directly inspired the Traqpod project. But if you look at it closely, the resemblance is only superficial (general shape and carving concept). Everything else are specific functional improvements, dare I say, on the BMW product. I'm realy proud of how the Traqpod came out, but I stood on the shoulders of a giant, so to speak. 

Other inspirations: Carveboard, T-board, Slidecarver, K2 kickboards, Flexboardz....

Not really (but I get asked that a lot). That's just not how it's designed. The folding thing is just to shrink the packing and carrying size.

The deck has a huge concave, specially at the front and back. You can very easily steer the thing by just leaning on your toes or heels, just like when you snowboard (I've never snowboarded, but hey, that's what people tell me it feels like).

Welcome to the forum dude (hola amigo!),
No doubt, but with a skateboard you want most of your weight over the front wheels for control and increased leverage. You don't need to be standing on your truck hardware all the time but with with your design you do not get a choice.
On the flip side it might not matter, you might not need much leverage as the rounded profile of your wheels didn't look to generate a lot of grip? Or do you have very powerful motors? How many watts are you putting out to each wheel?

You say you have rubber bushings? I'd seriously look into upgrading to thane, that is the single largest technology shift (development) skateboards have seen since invention. Superior rebound control to say the least.

@Cobber Hello there. I am not sure I understand the first part of your message, so this reply is a bit risky...

Control over the trucks and general skateboard steering is achieved by shifting your weight relative to the key truck joints, but that weight is applied to them through the deck-truck connecting plates. No further "information" on **where** along the deck that weight was applied is transmitted, if your think about it. What I mean is that you may like to steer the skateboard with your front foot, but the effect is essentially the same as doing the same thing with your rear foot. Or in the middle, for that matter. I will try to be a bit more selfconscious of how I myself do it. I would say it depends on the day. As for the Traqpod specifically, it's ridiculously responsive either way. You'll be amazed.

(As for "leverage", more or less the same. What matters is torque, therefore "lever arm" length, i.e., how far from the skateboard longitudinal axis you get to shift you weight.)

I feel more confortable with the second part of your message... The rounded profile wheels were made that way partly for looks, partly to reduce the friction with the ground, rubber hardness being another factor. The grip they generate has no effect on the steering, only on acceleration and braking. The wheels are about 105 mm in diameter and rather hollow, so their angular momentum is significant (once they are up to speed they are harder to slow down). Also, bear in mind the wheels have zero camber, that is, they do not turn like the BMW StreetCarver wheels. They remain vertical.

Motor power: not our main concern, but we will try to find a balance between power, range, speed and weight. There may be single and dual motor configurations. Stay tuned.

Rubber bushings: no and no :) We don't use bushings (friction parts are made with POM) and the truck balancing mechanism is spring-based actually. As for rubber parts, that's a generic term we use but of course wheel tires are PU. Also the deck's antislip overmold.

Sorry about the lengthy response.

Xavi

@sk8l8r We can make a more agile version by shinking the whole thing without ruining the overboard-wheels painfully-developed design :) But I think the Traqpod is very agile in terms of turning radius and responsiveness already. Give it a chance when you can.

@xavigarcia. I like the concept. Stability is the #1 category of any new idea or design. When you ask people to hand over hard earned money to fund your idea, please take the time on the proving grounds. Be certain this design performance meets or exceeds current stable setups. It has to be stable over 45kph or people are gonna get hurt. Strength, if it breaks when a 113kg gorilla launches it off a curb. People will get hurt. Please properly test and be transparent before you ask for money.  You can dazzle with brilliance or you can baffle with bullshit. You probably won't be able to fool anyone in this group.

Um, no. Trying to ride a skateboard at any sort of speed with your weight biased to the rear and trying to steer with your rear foot will likely lead to a rapid oscillation side to side (speed wobbles) and you will likely fall off.

[/quote]

Um again No. Not in my experience. Having that weight bias to the front gives you control to stop the oscillation. 

It was this basic mis-understanding of "how to control a skateboard" that led to my initial comment about the board.

[/quote]

Watching your demo video with your jockey over balancing and falling off when the rear wheels broke lose under throttle in a turn also led me to ask questions about how powerful your motors will be. This was important to me because of the limited control the rider would have because of your inherent deck/truck/wheel design currently to me looked to suit lower power and lower speeds.

I wouldn't want to see someone riding your design as it is at traffic speeds?

[/quote]

Spring Trucks?  Definitely be careful and progressive testing them at speed and on varied road surfaces then. Springs alone have little rebound control and can "bounce". 

Do you know what the equivalent RKP truck angle would be for your novel design?

I'm curious if you've seen the Curfboard. They're designed by one of the guys behind the streetcarver.

I'm also curious as to how the truck operates. It is just rotating on a bolt?

@CHAINMAILLEKID The Curfboard was indeed designed by the father of the Streetcarver. I missed their 2016 Kickstarter campaign but ordered after that and received it a few months ago. It’s neat and innovative but not for me. It surely isn’t an evolution or improvement in the Streetcarver, it just branches off in a different direction (which is fine). It’s s nice longboard with a special front truck that is supposed to keep you going forward by swinging and pumping. You will find plenty of videos showing the curfboard at work. Their Kickstarter video also shows the truck in detail (plus some nice views of my town).

Hi @Cobber Thank you for your detailed answer.

Unfortunately it's hard to communicate over sensations and complex mechanical ideas in writing. It's like that saying: "Speaking about music is like dancing about architecture". Same thing here. The basic problem is that the Traqpod has a completely different design from what you've normally used and most of your assumptions don't really apply to it, and also that your experience, user profile and expectations from a skateboard are also particular to you (and probably lots of other people, of course). And I'm not saying the Traqpod will not meet them (we will see).

There is a huge latent market out there made up by people who will value maneuverability and confort over, say, power. (Power, by the way, in only one way to control a skateboard; another one is simple mechanical maneuverability and responsiveness; the more you have of the latter, the less you need of the former.). A market of unconventional skateboarders who will use the Traqpod not for racing but to go about the city and will be sorrounded by pedestrians and other moving objects, and who, for instance, will never experience speed wobbles because they'll never reach that kind of speed. I mean, really: what top speed can you achive on a normal pedestrian street in any city? But, again, I appreciate your comments and hope to continue communicating with you all.

@onepunchboard It's really not, believe me. Maybe it looks like that, but it's very low riding for a board its size (92 cm when unfolded). Plus, it's very flexible, so for heavier users it will be even lower (unless they choose the wood deck, much stiffer). Last week a 115 kg friend tried it and it came really low (but not too low).

If you look at the current specs:
36V 6,6 Ah, he´s using something like the Samung 22p with a 10s3p config. Able to do 30A max.
So there will be something like 500W Motors for a lightweight city cruiser, where you will be able to slalom around crowded cities and go something like 35 km/h max.

I really like the design and you guys can´t compare this to our performance machines.
This is more like the meepo or boosted but with some futuristic looks and features

@sk8l8r If you do 30 mph regularly in heavy traffic then the problem of 'existing' with cars may soon solve itself. Are you an organ donor? :)

Sorry about the joke, I just had to. Now seriously, do what you want with other skateboards, but we do not recommend using the Traqpod on the road (I mean, in the middle of automobile traffic), for the same reason you wouln't use a bicycle in a highway (please, tell me you don't) . I'm not even sure this kind of use is legal in most places.

We at least design our product for use in pedestrian streets, bicycle lanes, campuses, residential zones, shopping mall parking lots, and the like. The practical speed you can achive in these kind of places may seem frustrating (8 to 15 km/h), but I can tell you it's not in our case: the specific feature that sets the Traqpod apart is what makes this kind of use and speed fun: carving. Traqpod is not designed to be used in a straight line. This totally defeats the purpose. Carving is not only fun. It's also the feature that helps you avoid the normal street obstacles (which then become "challenges"). (But I guess we can make it reach at least 20 km/h. I haven't really checked that.)

(Bonus: Authentic anecdote and case in point: I use the Traqpod to go to the gym, which is 800 m (half a mile) away from home. It's rather downhill so I hardly use the motor on my way there, so I just carve away to get there, with some occasional motor thrust, and it takes me, whatever, 6, 8, 10 minutes? Who cares? It's fun. HOWEVER yesterday I had stuff going on and had to get there before a specific time, and was running late. So I not only had to use the motor the whole time and speed up a bit, but (and this is the worst part) I HAD TO GO IN A STRAIGHT LINE to save time. The good news is I did meet my deadline. The bad news is that it was a terrible user experience. With the Traqpod you do get everywhere in half the same (vs. walking), but if you want to get there in one _third_ of the time, man, the experience is as enjoyable as taking the bus. So I might as well do that.

@TarzanHBK Dual-drive model would be the way to go. It will be heavier, and still based on hub motors, though. If even more power is necessary, we do have a product roadmap for that.

I mean, don't get me wrong: we _do_ want to empower our users to do what _they_ want. We just have to start somewhere and this takes compromises. And not everyone lives in San Francisco :wink:

You're losing me dude, as a tilt steer vehicle there are some basic physics that apply to the vehicle in motion you seem naive about. You are questioning their existence and claiming they don't apply to you. :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

Further I find the introduction of my personal experience and user profile by you as some kind of evidence that I do not know what I'm talking about insulting... quite possibly delusional on your behalf? Something must be lost in translation :thinking: because I've been skating likely as long as you have been alive & I've certainly contributed a significant amount more than you to this community.

Hi @Cobber. I have re-read my reply to you and you are completely right. It was poorly worded and it could lead to your interpretation, and I therefore would like to take everything back and apologize for it. Insulting you or despising you was never my intention. In fact, it was quite the contrary: I was trying to express my own frustration for my difficulties at explaining complex mechanical ideas in English (my fourth language). So, you see, you are actually right at this: something _was_ lost in translation!

I understand I may have already lost you but if you give me the chance I only wanted to try to clarify my earlier points:

- My remarks about your user profile were not intended to question your experience or education. I only meant that what you and I expect from a skateboard are different things: differenent performances and experiences. And this in turn means some issues that are a legitimate concern for some kinds of users are completely irrelevant for others. I have written on this today elsewhere in this same thread.

- The part of the discussion regarding physics is something we really should discuss (and I am willing to) with with some more information and preferably graphical support, since I just don't have the vocabulary and maybe we don't have a clear vision of what each other means. Some things do need pen and paper. I do believe one of our disagreements stems from the fact that in one comment I was talking about the front-back axis and you probably meant the right-left axis. But I'm not trying to restart the discussion ok? :wink:

So I hope we can put this behind and keep our healthy discussion in this forum.

Sincerely

Xavi

@xavigarcia I like your style and I hope this project works for you buddy. It takes a strong person to meet criticism head on when your vision is being questioned and an even stronger person to admit fault to a bunch of strangers.

Keep us informed.

Oh, I was meaning I was curious about how your trucks operate and turn.

The mechanism isn't visible.

@CHAINMAILLEKID Hi. Actually there isn't much mechanism to show, it's all ingenious and simple, and fully visible. From their website:

HTH,

Add pneumatic wheel options (wide and low) and you really have something. Make your carbon board split or fold for even shorter form factor for travel in a backpack.
