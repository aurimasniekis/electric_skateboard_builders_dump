Hi guys.
While still on my way building the Creepo board, I' m wondering what would be the best aternatives to molder a DIY enclosure for my electronic parts. I'm pretty much sure that silicon and PU resins would make it, but i also found this out:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=Y0CgMibawl4
It's a translucid epoxy resin that seems to be very flexible and yet tough enough... It can also be mass-dyed with pigments, and it's sold at an almost reasonable price (45,90E/1.5 kg).
I'd prefer to use a material that can be processed simply. Poured materials therefore seem better than others that have to be layered (fiberglass)
What do you guys think about this?... (About this epoxy resin, not about the black manucure! :smile:)

nah all that is kinda sketch and expensive. 
Just buy a couple of sheets of kydex and you have an indestructible enclosure

Yeah, full casting is a little overkill (not to mention expensive) for an enclosure. Kydex or ABS are great materials, and relatively inexpensive.

I quite agree with you guys... But Kydex is hard to find in bigger dimensions here, and not that easy to work with, as is requires to be heated with some proper tools, plus to my opinion, it brings quite average looking results if u don't have a decent bench...
ABS?... I currently don't have a 3D printer, and don't think any would print a 50/15 cm piece nearby...
Therefore, casting seems to be a good solution, even if it is quite expensive... In addition, my enclosure won't be a 2 parts enclosure (one for the ESC and another for the cell pack) but a single piece... so it has to be as flexible as possible... this epoxy resin seems interesting...

If you have a flexible enclosure, youâ€™ll have to have a flexible battery pack no?

Where do you live? Kydex can be ordered with free shipping from amazon prime in the US.

France here... 20cm*30cm is the best i can find on local websites for Kidex... Way too small for my needs, plus one single sheet is about 10 euros, not counting shipping costs. So i don't think that the price  would make any significative difference eventually...

Same in Canada, it's hard to find and more expensive. Not sure why it's so cheap in the US. Maybe because it's used to make gun holsters...

I have seen Kydex on AliExpress that were 300mm x 300mm. I got a 100mm x 300mm piece to try out for about US$5.99 (from memory).

**note:** free shipping to NZ!

I found some cheap aluminum boxes on amazon and just bolt them to the deck with skate hardware, I bash them on stuff all the time and they hold up well, mounted on flexy deck too, just make sure the brackets can hang on, I have broke some thin brackets through flexing over a few hundred miles, but fixed it from hardware store parts. They have many sizes of the boxes to fit our needs,  https://www.amazon.com/BUD-Industries-AC-409-Aluminum-Chassis/dp/B005T57TA0/ref=pd_bxgy_328_3?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B005T577P2&pd_rd_r=HMJ3D1MR45B2RPNXZRAX&pd_rd_w=OqQLO&pd_rd_wg=X13jJ&refRID=HMJ3D1MR45B2RPNXZRAX&th=1

A nice and affordable solution for stiff decks indeed! Aluminium looks tough and solid, and is perfect for bulky renders ;-)

Be very careful with metal enclosures. Make sure your wires are well insulated and that the metal can't wear through the insulation and short them. If your phase wires get shorted, your DRV cheap dies and it's bye bye VESC.

I'm not planning to use a metal enclosure anyhow dude! ;-) Should receive a flexible cell pack around 5th of january, and i will definitely cast my enclosure in a flexible material... My only incertitude is which material... Will it be some silicon, a PU 80A shore resin or this flexible epoxy resin?... I did not decide yet! Silicon has the advantage of being heat resistant, but could be slightly too smooth, The PU resins i found could make it even if they aren't that stable at higher temperatures... But 80A shore?... maybe too hard... And this resin, that seems to have many advantages (I don't know its heat resistance properties though...)

This being said, my cell pack is A 3P pack made of VTC6 cells... shouldn't get that warm... My main concern is about the enclosure's height... as the wall is going to be 2.5 to 3.5 cm high (3 to 5 mm wide), i need a material that keeps its flex even used on thicker layers... This epoxy resin is said to keep its full flex up to 2cm wide uses, then the flex slowly decreases.... It sounds pretty nice... Or it may be the black manucure that appeals me... :smile: I initially planned to build a one piece enclosure for esthetic reasons... Of course it's contradictive with a flexible deck... that's why i'm trying to find decent solutions, but i might eventually get my mind made up and build it in two pieces... unless one of these materials can make it... But to me, Two pieces enclosures with a wire between... are kind of yucky...

yes... fiberglass... it was my first choice... but i'm quite sure i'm not going to get a decent looking result... plus fiberglass isn't that waterproof unless u coat it... eventually, considering the fiber, the resin, the coat, it would cost the same price, take more time, and be less innovative... those materials come mass dyed or u can mass dye them easily, are waterproof, can be used easily... Just mix and pour in the molder, wait 24 hrs and done... But fiberglass definitely has the light weight advantage...

Yea that thing is cool
I just finished my fiberglass enclosure and its not so easy especially if its your first time doing it
It could have come out like 5times better and nicer looking but I was just too lazy will post the final pics later when I paint it

That's it! Not that easy unless u have some experience or take quite a certain amount of time to do things accurately, or to redo things, sand it, paint it... and so on... I'm kind of lazy... lol

Metal ones are good if you insulate it in the inside some way
Like some kind of epoxy or something

I insulate my components and mount them securely, the metal is not a issue. I wrap the (already wrapped) batts in electrical tape and they are held in place on all sides by 9mm epp foam sheets..the rx antenna is mounted on the outside of the box as well..no worries and never been a problem..

yep but metal isn't that flexible right?... i 'll have a flexible cell pack soon... my deck is flexible... i plan to ride a skateboard, not an iron shaft... of course it adds incertitudes about the cell pack's and electronics life and durability... But... that's the initial plan... keeping the whole build as flexy as possible... of course i could simply build a two part enclosure... :smile:

My decks flex just fine with the metal boxes, I use a foam gasket of about 4 or 5mm and the brackets are only mounted on each long end so the deck is allowed to flex and the brackets take some of the burden so they must be strong and.or gusseted..

yep... indeed... lol... but... why not give it a try?.. I can do the laboratory guinea pig for all of you... :-) then if it fails, i'll get a two part enclosure... I think that u will admit that it would be more esthetically pleasant to make it one piece instead of two right?...

My 50 mile board there with the long metal box, yeah that one, I can flex it enough to still pump it down the street at 15 mph without power on..

Dual enclosures would work even better..

indeed... :smile: It's logic to stick to what has been working... but what ?...PU resins or silicons have 600% elongation capacities... this is flexible and elastic... I want to give it a try... (plus the shop that sells them is 10 minuts far from my place... lol I totally agree that nothing will compete with a two part enclosure in terms of flexibility though... but this could be more esthetic... I'll try it, then give you a feedback... It can work or fail, but deserves a try... I am going to set the whole shit on the exact median point of the board wahaha (oh @darkkevind, did you say "all the flex you want to put on it?..." :smile:) No guys... :slight_smile:  I'm not going to risk that actually... Not really... almost not... I might actually be reasonable and build it in several parts... but it hurts... And the shop is just 10 minut far... by foot... lol

That's the eternal battle between esthetism and function... :wink:
@squishy654 what's this nice orange belt motor you seem to like a lot for your builds?... Once I'll be done with my esthetic concerns, i might abandon hub motors and silicon enclosures, be more pragmatic and stick to single belt drives and alu for my next builds...

WOW kv 125 it has some torque! nice for a single motor build! I like the orange color (i know... i'm superficial! :smile:) 2000w is twice more than what i'll get with 2 hubs.. lol Yes I know... I'm the one being ridiculous using hubs... lol

Maybe you've seen it, maybe you haven't... Just in case I'd suggest having a scan over [my similar thread](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/polyurethane-battery-enclosure-bad-idea/24480).

PU flexes nicely, looks good. Can't comment on actual performance as I still haven't finished the board.

Casting needs careful though on how you're going to form the mould, as you'll need at least a top and a bottom. Also how you'll fill it; none of the PU mixes I looked at had a low enough viscosity that I'd be comfortable enough using conventional means of filling the mould. Enclosure moulds would be too large, and too thin, for the PU to flow through by the time it starts to gel. It's just not the kind of thing you get right on your first attempt.

Thanks for this interesting feedback. Yes PU resins are viscous and u have to do the job quickly... But casting simple shapes should be possible, and many silicons can have much lower viscosity... You got quite impressive results with PU, I like it a lot!  Mine would be a way simpler and less pro looking design! Did you use a silicon molder to cast this? I 'm not going to engineer a complicated molder to cast the enclosure: a wooden rectangular open "box" with a bottom but no top, with screwed walls, and silicon joints on the edges, a rectangular shape inside, screwed on the bottom. So the bottom of the molder will be the top of the enclosure. Just have to pour the material until the inner box is recovered with a decent layer of PU, unscrew the molder from the sides and bottom when it's gelified, and basta! Does it sound doable to you?( Could use vaseline or stuff like  transparent film for food  to unmolder it more easily if needed)
