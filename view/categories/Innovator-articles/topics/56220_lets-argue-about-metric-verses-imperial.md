Here's your place to argue about metric verses imperial, yay!

Gonna be honest, even though I read the whole thing I went in one neuron and out the other. But I totally support an industry standard.

This is excellent news.

A standard for hanger size is very long overdue. So much less headache that way :+1:

The more standard hanger easier to make mounts and etc :) Does anybody knows the length of this new hanger from TB?

@squishy654 Are the Hobbyking trucks .75"? How come you don't use them with your builds? I'm using them, no complaints, gotta swap bushings though.

Queen pins on a 220mm esk8 truck with standardised dimensions would be fantastic

I like your passion and fire man, as I told you so many times before.
You put time and thought into this which is commendable, right on dude!

Now there are two things I would like to touch upon.

1.) Metric-system.
Well it is true that most skateboard related stuff is still in Imperial units. That is if you go trough generic equipment. Specialized hardware, such as trucks, are in metric. Most leading truck companys (in the donwhill world) gladly incorporated the metric system. Since it would be super weird to point out the differences between 154-164 hangers to 144- 154mm. Or 5mm, 2.5mm or 0mm rake.

I agree with @b264 here: But I think it is generally a silly argument. Everything that is taken seriously enough to be used and thought around the world is metric. Never ever saw a published scientific paper at uni in the last 10 years that mentioned any  NON metric unit...


2.) precision trucks for esk8ting:

UGh, im really not sure how I should start this without sounding like a complete asshole, I will try nonetheless. 

In longboarding there are so many banger parts that are crazy value for the money spent. Not only because they are more sound in design and quality but it reaches more precisely what you want out of it. 

A truck is only so good as it suits the users intentions and appliance. 

E.g: Me, donwhill oriented leaning towards racing. I want 20-25 degrees in the back. 45 degree max. in front. Some 5mm rake up front for lean and dive. 2.5mm rake for slight under steer for more grip in turns. Ideal hanger width of 160mm.

So throw some Katana cast trucks at me and I will love them, switch it up with Rogue cast or in my case save some cash for Katana billets and I am one happy man.

Put me on sabre, paris savants or god forbid on gull wing sidewinders and I will hate every second of it.

What I am trying to say with this is don't limit your horizon to esk8. Take the whole mountain of knowledge, experience, blood sweat and tears that the donwhill community accumulated and cherry pick out of it that suits YOU. As soon as you get into high performance in anything really the differences become bigger within a category than smaller. 

So am I for a standard? hell no ? Am I for more options ? hell yess. That would mean everyone gets a more ideal ride out of it. 

Finally about the "precision" part. Esk8ts are already super expensive. While precision trucks are indeed sick and sexy as fuuuq, I don't think they are necessary for eskating in general. (some cases excluded).  You need to push your cast trucks (such as rogues, bear kodiaks etc.) extremely far to need a precision set. Even though I try ma heart out to push my esk8 riding closer and closer to my donwhill discipline I am still galaxy's away. There is simply no need for them, as we are operating in areas where and optimized set up to your style and liking (angle, rake, width and bushing set up) is more of an optimization that a "standard" precision truck could ever be. 

Ps: Just from the point fo your skating hardware, it will be the last thing to limit you in pulling of crazy stuff. Skill super seeds high-end stuff until the upper upper echelon of riders... (you don't need 500hp, race slicks etc for your car. You cannot ever use it properly and maintenance and cost is a bitch.)

I still use metric and prefer metric.. It will be 19mm but it's not far off of from .75". So either clamp should fit fine for both.

If you still have contact with them. Ask them If they are every at an IDF race or any DH event really.
Remember for ever ago our discussion where you said, I had to try them since I disliked their original suspension truck so much.

I'd be interested to hear some of the science behind this, 19mm is a pretty damn thick cross section considering precision's are already heavier than their cast counterparts and due to the grain structure are stronger. 

IMO the only use for trucks like these would be in be in extremely high end boards where 6000W is driven through the rear wheels.

That way we can get out to 220mm hanger widths without the hangers breaking and bending under normal use, has nothing to do with the motor, but the fat people standing on them

Like this guy?  LoLz  212lbs (96kg) checking-in and I broke a kingpin 2 weeks ago...

yeah tried the RKP, 180mm quite a while back now. Was on a super hard course, super steep, narrow and fast. They were terrifyingly unprescise. My biggest problem was the "rebounce" after every compression by either wieght shift or pure centrifugal force (?!) in narrow turns.

Trucks are my fetish, need to try them all :slight_smile:

Might be nice if the 'standard' included a rounded section that would support a bearing for the pulley. Much like what Ollin do to the cast Ronins, but saving the effort of having to put them in a lathe.

It's kind of ironic that American cars are all designed in SI units, but the speedos still read mph. I don't think you'll find an engineer anywhere that says using imperial units is a good idea. That said if you do stick with imperial, don't do what Trampa does with it's labelling "9.525mm" axles... üò©.

Off topic... They look a lot like little cooling vanes on the new direct drive TorqueBoards hanger. They kind of look too small to do a lot of good, and no doubt add to machining costs. Also, [I'd be wary of this](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2018023153A1/en) unless you've come to some kind of agreement.

I saw [APS recently produced some esk8 friendly trucks](http://alienpowersystem.com/shop/cnc-kit/alien-power-trucks/alien-cnc-power-trucks-185mm/). It'd be so nice if you could just choose the mounts you like, and the trucks you like without having to worry about compatibility issues. Good thread üëç.

During a short exchange I also learned it will have a .75" square hanger!  It has begun, people have listened, and right now I know of 2 badass looking precision trucks coming out in the future which both feature a .75" square hanger
[/quote]

I knew this would eventually happened after I posted some of my test data from fusion 360 here and implemented it in my build as replacement hangers for my Calibers.

bearings use a system for describing them, like 608 for our skate bearings i think its probably an iso/din
