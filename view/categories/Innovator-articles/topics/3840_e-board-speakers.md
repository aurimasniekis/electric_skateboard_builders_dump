I was cruising through the online metropolis that is Google, and managed to find this:<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/c/c5905e4229b1979577b71f5829520ba7cfca8e04.png" width="281" height="500">

I think it could easily be done with any longboard, but the question is how easy/affordable would it be? I also found this, thinking it wouldn't be very challenging to buy 2 of them and hook em up to the trucks. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/5/5299958a0c63afecabd4557ddb1ce8aceab9435e.png" width="281" height="500">http://www.polkaudio.com/swimmer/d/1238
Thoughts?

To go blasting down streets while listening to my favorite playlist without having to worry about headphones falling off my head or earbuds falling out of my ears

If the speakers are in an enclosure and you try to attach the to the board ... Eventually. It will break in someway because of the vibration....so Bluetooth speaker in a bag or pocket

I've installed a Bluetooth speaker under my board. Even though it is rather small, the sound can be quite loud. I mostly use it when I'm not riding my board and just chilling somewhere with friends...
Ask me anything if you've got questions

Please don't be one of those people that blasts music and forces everyone to listen to their shitty songs. :neutral_face:

if its good shit like techno or trance, thats a different story :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
but then of course you would have to add a small smoke machine and neon lights :sunglasses:

I juste rewired an old broken Bluetooth speaker I had laying around to my actual skateboard circuit
But you can build something really similar with this kind of real cheap thing https://www.amazon.fr/gp/aw/d/B01CBT75BY?creative=22698&creativeASIN=B01CBT75BY&hvdev=m&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=&linkCode=df0&pc_redir=T1&tag=googshopfr-21 
(Im sure you can find similar, much smaller and still more than powerfull enough circuits)

Haha
I swear, as I already said it than I am not using it when riding in the city :sweat_smile:
However I'd like to add rgb led strips under my board... (With colors changing with the Music?...)
