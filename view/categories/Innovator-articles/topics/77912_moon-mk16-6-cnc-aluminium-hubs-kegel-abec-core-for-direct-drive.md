Hi.

I am showcasing this Kegel/ABEC core CNC hub for 6 inch pneumatic tyres, specifically targeted to people wanting to use their direct drives in the rain or bad road conditions.  The kegel/ABEC core is made to fit existing and upcoming direct drives

But it isn't limited to Direct drives, I have made it so that this hub can fit Versa Pulleys which are very affordable inside the US. I've also designed a 4:1 gear drive for this wheel so no one is left out üòÇ

In the process of arranging 3 sets of these using @moon s designs milled in 7075 to test out.

Not sure how long it's going to take with Christmas almost on us but pics and results here when they are on.

Here are some pictures of the hubs on Carvon DD. These were pictures are from @cambo who machined them out of POM. He slightly modified the CAD drawings but I prefer it this look.

Just need to test if the inner tube fits okay because the model was modified.

6.5mm diameter iirc

Hi mike, I would like to let you know that they are not the same ones. We have opened a mould directly with Innova taiwan ;-) the material as well as the shape and profile are completely different.

That is not to say that the ones on Alibaba.com don‚Äôt fit. 
Give it a try ...

I'd love a 6x2 inch tire hub with a 28mm bearing hole so I could run MBS Pro 2 trucks (or any other MTB trucks) with a 12mm axle and the smaller 6inch wheels. Torque matters. I can't find ANYTHING like it out there. Closest thing is the Trampa 6.5 inch wheels/tires that are $$$.

What this gentleman is asking for is already here.

Basically he believes the urethane wheel stays on and this attaches to the side of it.

This doesn't, you take the other one off and this one uses the same mounting point on dd. Why you think it would go after the wheel is baffling

Thats the gear drive I have been working on, getting a few samples made so I can get it tested by the best riders/builders on this forum.

Currently it will be tested by

@mmaner - Surfrodz RKP and Sixshooters
@Andy87 - With his Trampa setup
And me - Surfrodz TKP and MOON MK16 Kegel Core Hubs
Maybe @skunk with bergmeister setup 
 
I claim that it is modular because it can fit:

MBS Wheels
Trampa Wheels
Sixshooters
MOON MK16 Hubs
Bergmeisters 

And with the right clamp design it can fit:

Surfrodz TKP,RKP
TB 218mm
Trampa Infinity/Vertigo
Bergmeister Trucks
```

Hmm but maybe some DD don't have extended axles and bregmeisters with kegal adapter won't fit

Remove the adaptor and design one for Bergmeisters

I think it will work

Confused by the survey as I thought these hubs which I really love but I thought they worked with both kegel and ABEC wheels?? Can you please tell me what direct drive system is that?? Looks much different than the Lofty's or TB's..?

What's direct drive is in the photos that you were testing?  Also, slick revolutions has a adapter that turns the kegel into abec..
