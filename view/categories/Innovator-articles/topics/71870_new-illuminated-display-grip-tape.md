Hi everybody,

My name is Chris from Pitbull Electric Skateboards.

I wanted to share two new innovations I came up with in the last couple of months.

The first is a new illuminated display grip tape. It looks just like regular grip tape, but in low light or in the dark, it doubles as an illuminated display. Currently, the prototype's only functionality is acting as an equalizer, reacting to the ambient sounds. But future plans for this will allow it to display usefull information, such as battery status, remote signal strength, etc.
[Click here for Video of the illuminated display grip tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1u7y58InEM)

The second innovation I want to share is this new open mesh screen material. It is made to cover the openings on the battery enclosures, as it allows air to flow in and out, but prevents water from passing through. 
[Click here for Video of the Airflow Screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKQa9muLtXY)

These are both very new, and there is a lot of uses that I have not thought about yet. I have filed a provisional patent for each and will be continuing to develop these further.
Let me know what you think, or if you have any questions. 

Thanks!

I can't like that more than once man!
The only thing that would be better was if that airflow could be one way fluid wise.  Let air in but water out if it gets in.  It does get in after a while no matter how careful you are.  Bloody amazing stuff though and I for one will follow this with interest.  I don't as a rule ride when raining but if I got caught out then that would be the perfect solution to cooling without losing water ingress integrity.  Great stuff and good luck.
@b264  Get a load of this.

Are these currently available? if not when and what kind of prices are we looking at?
It would be awesome if the grip tape could be used like a battery meter

black paint + clear grip + leds = fancy griptape
just diy it;)
the airflow screen is nice, how’s that holding up against puncture?

Thanks a lot for your interest and enthusiasm. 

And I think I can make the mesh one way. I'll have to experiment with that but you make a great point and it would be good to allow it to drain.

I'll keep everyone posted on that.

Hey thanks for your interest. Not available for purchase yet.

I am trying to get an idea of the scope of how hard it will be to make it a universal display. I'd like to be able to have a pair (male and female) of XT60 connectors that connect between the battery and esc for battery monitoring. But I want to make sure that any units sold will be compatible with future firmware upgrades and features.

Probably still approx 45 days away from being released. 

Unless I receive a lot of requests for the grip tape with just the EQ function. Cost would be about $39.99. The next version will have higher resolution, and more useful functionality options, and it will of course cost a little more. 

The Airflow mesh price is still being determined, and i'm not sure what sizes it will be sold in. There are a few things that I want to work out, which I think will further improve on it. But I anticipate that within the next 30 days it will be available for purchase. 

I'd like to hear back from the members of this community what you all would prefer in regards to size. For example; 5x7 inch pieces? 

I'm determined to keep the price very low to make it accessible for everyone, but still I dont want people to need to purchase more than they need. 

I'll need to see how much lower I can get my costs to produce the material if I do it in large volume, but it looks like a 5x7 piece would cost between $10 or $20 at the most.

I'm really aiming to try to get it down to $10. 

What dimensions would you guys prefer?

Thanks everyone for your interest!

LOL.

Oh I wish it was that simple. haha

I will be revealing more on the materials used in the grip tape soon. 

I have not even considered "stab-testing" the air flow screen. haha. What kinds of punctures are you concerned about? Give me some suggestions on what I could subject it to and I'll come up with some solutions. The mesh right now is pretty strong, but it's soft and flexible (not stretchy). I doubt rocks and debris would be able to penetrate it, but if the underside of your board was used for protection in a knife fight, I'm afraid the internal components might be compromised. 

But know you got me wanting to make a Kevlar version. Seriously. I'll keep you posted on that.

You're going to want to stay tuned. I'm going to reveal exactly how it works, what it's made with, and even how people can make their own. A few things need to be ironed out first. So give me at least a week before that gets posted.

:)

Hi Wraith, 

Thanks for your interest. The grip tape is made to be grip tape, first and foremost. So it needs to illuminate consistently while being treated/abused as regular grip tape. 

It would be lame if people had to tip toe on it. When I create a product, I strive to have it benefit the user, or at the very least compliment their normal way of going about their day or activity. The panel has been made to be flexible and with stand very harsh impacts. It's also waterproof and cannot be crushed once it is installed.

I gotta head out for a bit, but I'll check back later to see if there are any more questions. Thanks everybody!

That is awesome and great to hear! To be able to treat it as normal grip tape and not have to worry about it breaking from normal skating use is very important. Looking forward to having it be programmable to show all the useful information and maybe some fun LED graphics as well. Looking forward to see what you come up with! hoping you can ship these internationally as well :smile:

@Money that grip tape is amazing

I would love to have a version that I could just plug into an existing microcontroler and do things from there, no current sensing board or anything like that

If it was supported by U2g library even better

@money been wandering round your site and would like some more info on the esc you are using in your pre-builts.  When you say Vedder based do you mean a fully programmable esc using vesc tech?  
Theres only a few duals out there so interested to know whether its your own creation based on Benjamin's hard work or one of the chinese versions.

Probably simply one of these under clear grip tape:

What may appear as "building up hype" is simply me being proud of some things I have been working on and wanting to see if there is interest in the community.  I create a lot of gizmos and gadgets. Things that I think would be cool. But often by the time a working version gets made, I have become so desensitized by the idea that I lose a bit of that initial excitement. Sharing it and getting feedback often rejuvenates that feeling and helps drive me forward and improving on it or polishing it up. It's not an uncommon practice to see what people think prior to making a product available for purchase. And it usually benefits the product and consumer by allowing time to incorporate feedback. Like Nordle's concern about the resiliency of the Air flow mesh. His comment now has me looking into a Kevlar based mesh. That's a huge improvement, and one I had not considered prior to reading his comment.  
Also, had no one expressed interest in either the grip tape or the mesh, I would likely have continued to develop it, but it would probably be a slower process with out the same level of excitement. 

I create things. A lot of those things aren't exactly useful, but I make them because they fascinate me, or I just want to see it work, or just as often, if I think it wont work, but dont know why, I want to see it not work so I can understand it. If you're curious about some of the projects I have done, DM me. 

One of the best feelings I have experienced is when I find out something I made has helped someone else, or made their day/life a little easier, or even if they just find it cool or useful. That feeling just lights me up and keeps me going. 

I hope that long winded response helps clarify my intentions. Thanks for adding to this discussion/thread.

Looks to me like that mesh works based on surface tension of the water?
Can you show a test with soapy water?

@Money Keep it up man. Though griptape is innovative, I'm really looking forward to the Air mesh. 

Did you test it under rough conditions? I.e. Direct splash, or pour water directly over the mesh at high pressure and see what happens? Did you try with oil, salty water, etc... Even pouring water and using a blower at the same time to see if air doesn't push water through. 

You should iron this one out as much as you can. I see many applications for it.

if you wanna diy it, w/ the ability to program it, u can do this... cover the deck, and then use the Epoxy pools of flatness to "pot" the leds to the board and grip over the leds

The implementation of those LEDs underneath the grip tape is very well done! I've been experimenting a bit with embedded Neopixel rings. 

Provisional patent filing though eh? Heh.
