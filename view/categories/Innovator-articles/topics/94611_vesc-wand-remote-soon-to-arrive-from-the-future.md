**Soon to arrive from the future:** **THE VESC WAND REMOTE CONROLLER**

Benjamin Vedder and I used the winter period to design a new kind of remote controller with some new &amp; very outstanding 'E-Skate specific features'. There are many basic remote control options already on the market but non of which hit the high bar when it comes to features &amp; reliability. Most of us have experienced issues when using an in-sufficient remote control &amp; consequently we have always dreamed of holding a reliable, versatile, ever lasting &amp; safe remote controller that matches the outstanding performance of the VESC software and hardware environment it's matched up to. You should expect nothing less than magic from the **WAND** .

**HARDWARE:**
High end electric boards deserve to be controlled with a high end remote, you need to be 100% in control over the Mmonster under your feet. Personally I always dreamed of something that feels nice in your hands, made of high grade material, representing the same high quality level of our boards. Something that goes hand in hand with the cutting edge technology the VESC-Project offers. This remote is made from 6061 T6 (Aero-grade) aluminum with a nice carbon fiber battery lid. You can feel the quality straight away.

**REAL TIME DATA DISPLAY:**
Using a custom Circular High Resolution OLED display enables us to revel all the crucial information you want to have to hand while riding your board. A small screen, similar to a smart watch to scroll through &amp; see the current speed, average speed, Amp draw, duty cycle, average Watt hour draw, battery indicator (for both the board &amp; the remote), recuperation &amp; many more details that can be added later through updates. Whatever data the VESC captures, it can ultimately displayed on the OLED screen. Benjamin Vedder even coded tools to display animated graphics for ultimate pimpness :-)

**SAFETY &amp; GESTURE Control:**
What is really exciting is the IMU unit inside this remote...The IMU knows the exact orientation of the WAND in space, whislt gathering acceleration values of all space axies at the same time. Benjamin has been able to code some really useful safety features &amp; playful things. For instance, the remote will know when you have a crash &amp; can therefore stop your board safely. It knows when it rests upside down on a surface, refusing to accidentally send a signal to the board. It knows when you pick it up &amp; it knows when its resting in a steady state for a while, going to sleep after some minutes to save battery. This remote is even a water spirit level, helping you to align things perfectly.

**TRANSFORM YOUR REMOTE:**
On top of the features mentioned above, this little beauty features an option to mount a second lever or trigger and pistol grip on the bottom side. In consequence this remote can either be converted to be a pistol grip style trigger remote or to simply have an additional small trigger on the lower side to allow additional index finger control. I like to use my index finger to send acceleration commands, while using my thumb to send brake signal commands. Others want to use their thumb or index finger only. Everyone is different!

**SAFE KEEPING:**
Hey, and do you have the same issue like me? Whenever I want to ride my board, I search for my remote. And when I put my remote on top of my board, it can easily drop on the floor when I'm in a hurry. That's why we decided to equip this remote with a magnetic bottom panel. A small metal sheet or magnet, attached to your board, will safe keep your remote where it belongs, or you simply keep your remote on the door of your fridge, reminding you you to go out for a ride whenever you get hungry.

**BATTERY LIFE:**
Battery life has always been an issue in the past. Sometimes you want to go out for a ride but you forgot to charge up your remote and you are worried that it will not last the entire ride you plan. When we designed this remote ultra low energy consumption was a prime goal to achieve. We wanted to use standard AAA batteries, so that you can carry spares, giving you ultimate confidence that you will never ever run out of battery. Two tiny AAA cells are good for 50-60hours of constant operation. AAA cells are available at gas stations, supermarkets, drug stores and you will probably pass such shops along your ride.

**SOFTWARE AND SUPPORT:**
We don't want you to buy a new remote, only because software advanced over time. We want you to know that this remote has a USB port and SWD port, allowing to easily flash the latest firmware, unlocking the latest features. This remote is future proof and will surprise you many times over it's entire life time.

**COMPATIBILITY:**
This remote is fully compatible with the TRAMPA NRF Dongle. Depending on when you bought the dongle, you might need to update its firmware, which is s simple task. This remote is compatible with any ESC that is based on VESC technology, running the latest VESC Firmware. Simply plug the TRAMPA NRF Dongle into the UART port of your ESC.

**CALIBRATION AND MULTIPLR BOARDS:**
This remote doesn't require calibration. A simple one click pairing procedure does the trick. You can use this remote for all your boards. No more need for multiple remotes, unless you want to ride out with your friends. In that case you can leave your old PPM remote receiver plugged in and switch over to that using the VESC-Tool App.

**PROFILES:** Use your remote to load ride profiles that you pre-defined in the VESC-Tool APP. Create profiles for beginners, kids, advanced and insane riders.

What the fuck does this even mean?  Who in their wildest dreams needs a spirit level on a remote?  I can count how many times I have needed a spirit level to build a board.  Zero.  Why put something so trite on a remote?  They should call it the i remote

I do like the analogue speedo though.  Thats a nice touch but the rest is not necessary.  Just more things to go wrong.

@trampa how this is realized? I mean I don’t want to know secret engineering stuff 😅 but I worry this feature could just stop my board out of nothing. I mean, not every crash goes the same way as well as not every riding conditions are the same.

Edit: and any pictures of the trigger style converted remote would be nice if available.

No worries, this is triggered when very high G-shocks occur. You can't create those kind of shocks holding the WAND in your hands. Bringing an unloaded board to a stop does not require a high braking strength. You can ride Off-Road and do crazy jumps without triggering safety stop. 

**VESC WAND WITH UPGRADE KIT**

We will also offer small triggers that do not require to mount a grip.

STOP "IMPROVING" THESE LIFE-CRITICAL SYSTEMS!

It's a remote.  It should one one thing really, really well.  That's it.  

Anything that has to interpret my intent based on an IMU reading is playing with fire.  If Tesla and all the other self-driving manufacturers can't get this right what in the world make you think this is even remotely a good idea?

I have to ask . . . whats the deal with regards to releasing the code or hardware schematics for this product?

Will this be under the same Creative Commons licence as the rest of Vedder's work or is this separate closed source code and Hardware?

It seems like this product is currently using the VESC name and branding. as it stands now the VESC website at vesc-project.com clearly states:

["In the future we will publish the schematics for **all official VESC hardware**, but not necessarily the complete hardware layout with gerber files."](https://vesc-project.com/node/311)

and with regards to software:

["**VESC software is free and open source**, and can be found on github."](https://vesc-project.com/node/309)

EDIT:

Just to be clear here im only asking out of curiosity. It looks like you've put a shit time of time and effort into developing this and it looks great. I understand if your deciding to keep it closed source but i think that this should be made clear if the VESC branding is being used.

can we deactivate the IMU features all together?

sorry for getting deeper into this, but i´m really interested. so if i would fall on my not trigger hand, what pretty offten happens, that feature wouldn´t work as well, right? So basically the remote need to drop out of the hand to the ground or you need to land on the remote with your hand to trigger the saftey brake signal.

I do too, but people in general are morons.  Someone, somewhere down the line will do this.  Not if, but when.  And it will happen at the most inopportune time, like going down a steep hill.  

What's the range on this device?  

If you can disable the IMU in firmware that'd be great.

Simply use rechargeable AAAs like I do. The battery indicator is an on screen feature. 
50 hours of constant use battery life lets you forget that this one is battery driven. 
And when you buy a set of four rechargeable AAAs you always have a pair of spare batteries to hands.

Quality is bang on, precision CNC cut parts front to back.
@AngryTrucker : You are probably used to charge your remote, since it draws a lot of current. The WAND has such a low energy consumption that you can use it for months without the need to even look at the battery status. 
I hate when I realize that my remote is empty when I'm in a hurry to leave home. All I can do then is plug it in and wait for 15 mins to charge up a bit. The WAND can get a fresh set of cells dropped in within 30 seconds. The empty ones go into my charger and the new ones are good for the next 2 months or more.

Unity FW uses Vedders open source code but is not 100% identical. It is possible to change the Unity FW to work with this remote, but you need the skills to change the code for compatibility.

You can use rechargeable batteries. A Lipo is nothing else. The big difference to remotes available today is the ultra low energy consumption. This device doesn't need a lot of charging. Your TV remote probably runs of a coin cell for a year or more. This remote is similar. Without the display in action you could run this remote for ages. With display running we still have 50 to 60 hours battery life (constant usage). The WAND has auto power on and off, to save battery when its not in use. This feature makes the battery last even longer. You won't swap batteries a lot.

Right. Clearly people are OK with disposable batteries or fumbling with external rechargables, but for me the convience of just plugging into a USB port (environmental benefit notwithstanding) is the way to go. 

In any case, I really like the form and function of the remote, I just wish it was rechargable. ❤️

Why not both? Rechargeable via USB and with AAA batteries, or better yet, a single 18650? Best of both worlds. I've got 3 remotes that are dead in the water right now cause the Lipo batteries swelled and won't hold a charge. It would be so much easier to fix if I could drop in some normal batteries, like my mini remote.

Using AAA batteries is a big bummer. Seems like a well engineered product and nice features but the thing with the batterie is a huge no go in 2019. 

When the battery life is that long you can easily build warning in the software, let's say when you have 10 hours left. That's more than 3 or 4 rides. So if you see the warning you will have still 4 rides and so opportunities to charge and not forget left. 

You will rather forget the spare batteries than charging your remote. 

Most people carry a power bank with them. Basically every esk8 is a huge power bank and some already have a step down to 5V and usb connector. So I would rather install such a thing than carrying spare batteries for the remote. 

If you re using rechargeable AAA cells you still need an extra charger for that and if you want to have the swapping on the fly feature you need 4 cells in total. Complete nonsense if you ask me.

I get that point from swapping them when you re around on a ride but this "feature" doesn't pay of in my opinion. There a soooo many disadvantages.

Sad that such an innovative product has such disadvantages... a lipo and recharging is state of the art for a reason...

This product should be a high quality product. At least for over $180 you should expect that. Therefore they should use high quality parts as high quality lipos with whose puffing shouldn't happen... If you're buying cheap china remotes with cheap parts you shouldn't be surprised that they will fail at some point.

In principle it works, its a FW matter. The VESC-Project keeps everything compatible to the max extend, but we can't influence others go into the same direction. Unity uses Vedder's FW code but it's modified and will need adjustments to guarantee compatibility. 
Since the Vedder code is OS someone could do the job and compile a compatible FW that you could load onto the Unity.  BTW a Unity compatible BLE remote would not work with other VESC based ESC for the same reason. 

Don't worry, there will be other small and powerful ESCs with on/off button available sooner than later.

I'm all for easily replaceable batteries. If it where up to me a single 18650 or another similar option would be the best. All that being said I'd take user replaceable batteries over one that's going to fail after x amount of cycles. And replacement AAA's can be bought from pretty much any store.

Combine that with the claimed battery life and the question is what is more inconvenient swapping out a set of AAA's every month or so, or eventually having to source and replace a lipo.

If you're an Esk8 builder, shouldn't you have a usb cable? And a battery pack?

I feel like the choice to use AAA is more about the ability to sell the product without having to worry about lithium concerns when shipping/storing the product. No reason to sell it as a "feature".

Can one remote bind to multiple receivers?
[/quote]

[quote="taz, post:111, topic:94611"]
**CALIBRATION AND MULTIPLR BOARDS:** This remote doesn’t require calibration. A simple one click pairing procedure does the trick. You can use this remote for all your boards. No more need for multiple remotes, unless you want to ride out with your friends. In that case you can leave your old PPM remote receiver plugged in and switch over to that using the VESC-Tool App.

This does not answer if it can bind to multiple receivers at the same time? Say you want to have one receiver per vesc and no can cables.

Guys there is no way a 18650 would fit in a remote this small.    Although if it could the battery life would be insane.

The other reason AAA is a good idea is that they can ship it worldwide and not have to deal with shipping restrictions of lithium batteries.  

I personally prefer the convenience of USB charging but having a battery cover with no external holes makes it easier to seal it from dust and splashes.

You press the button and cruise control is set at current speed level . Speed can be adjusted by pushing the trigger forward. Braking or pushing button disengages CC.
To lower the speed you simply disengage CC for a second.

Just because it´s cold in winter in sweden doesn´t mean directly that somebody as well tested the functionallity driving 2hours in snow at -10 degree. in fact i don´t know anything about how and in which time you guys tested the remote, so yeah ... microelectronic in a cnc case... it´s like packing the electronics into a heat sink case. the aluminum will get cold pretty fast. As min that´s what i would expect. Not everything can handle that. I think it´s not a dump question. especially for people living in cold conditions.

Edit: something like "the electronic we chose are rated for +60 till -20 degree so there shouldn´t be an issue" would be what I would expact as answer @trampa . So in fact I still know nothing. :roll_eyes: what if Benjamin was driving only on a cart track inside in winter? maybe -10 is too cold for him to drive outside? 

So, all in all your words ensure that the remote perform well in winter conditions (-5 to -15 degree). If that´s right i´m fine with it as well.

As fare as I know AAA is a 1000mah 1.5v battry. I’m presuming it using them in series so 3v 1000 mah pack so 3kvh pack lasting 55 hours

A 18650 3.7 3000mah making it a 11.1kvh pack so it would last 150 hours let’s say you ride a hour a day as that empty’s a standard 10s 4p pack aprox depending on riding style that’s Almost 3 moths use of remote excluding weekends what state of self dischard would you exspect your 18650 be in by then. Tho It probably best to use a low discharge higher capacity cell than a q30 but this make the figures even bigger of a dis advantage with more self discharge happaning.

Lith ions are grate for high discharge packs when you look after them but 3 months people will be over discharging them often i would put monny on it. 

I’m fully in the AAA battry as a fare more durable and suitable choice for low power consumption devises and are fare more reliable if abused by negligence. smaller and lighter too.

This is a prototype. The housing design has changed a bit around the trigger and buttons. The displayed graphics you can see in the image below are just a test screen to see if everything works technically correct. The Wand's OLED can display overlayed and animated graphics in a fine tuned gray scale. This ultimately means that different skins can be injected. 
So expect your Wands display to change over time, with new features becoming available through FW updates.

We don't have a lot of customers who are not satisfied with what they got shipped. 
A couple of returns per year is no problem for us. We are not selling shoes to women.  

@spei The display is OLED, very bright & as good as it gets. Contrast is white to black, so very readable. We decided to recess the display which helps to shade the display.

You have Trampa's warranty

And the UK's sale of goods act

I am not sure how this would be interpreted in the case of for example - you don't particularly feel it is ergonomic to your hand; bored of it ; 'better/newer' remote comes out from competitor.

Typically you should probably just sell it instead of impinging on the seller in those cases

Thats why i ask. Its more of a ergonomic question. I personally have trouble with remotes that don't have a curvature but i really like the wand so far. If i buy a product and a new one comes out, thats on me.

In Germany we have a "Widerrufsrecht" (right of withdrawal?) It has to be in a certain and limited timeframe of course.

Maybe you could wait for the release pistol handle and try both ways

Metr is a closed source project, while VESC is GPL v3 Open Source. 
Technically it's possible, but Roman can't simply integrate Benjamin's code base into his Firmware. That would make his project OS. Also note that the dongle might need a FW update from time to time. 
Trampa dongles are designed to be upgradable FW wise. 
It would be easy to connect to a Trampa/VESC dongle via Metr App, but that is not their business strategy.
Strategy is: You need their dongle to use their App, which makes you you run into technical troubles that are totally unnecessary (from a technical point of view). 

Long story short: you will probably need a UART splitter to run two technical nearly identical dongles. Don't know if that is a wise idea if you run the remote on that same port. I'll ask Vedder for you.

my question, will there be a dead mans switch option? that to me is a necessary feature and would love for the ability to implement it!

edit: 
Follow up...
I assume DMS will be possible, as itd be simple enough code, and as i've read, there are already plans to add at least an index finger trigger.
So, my question, is it a single adc channel for added switch/pot, or is there the ability to add additional inputs? does the remote feature a single, additional input port, multiple, or even possibly a uart-serial port for further additions?
```

Dead man switch sounds like a good idea, but can be very dangerous if it applies a brake if not pushed. 
A remote can slip out of your hands while you still stand on the board! That's why you want to use a wrist leash. 
If the board continues rolling when the dead man switch is not pushed it is not very useful, since the board can travel quite a distance rolling to a stop. If it applies a brake it can send you flying. 
Neither setup is desirable.  If you have a crash holding onto your remote, the switch is not necessarily triggered. 

We looked into that and analysed all scenarios. A built in IMU gives you better options to implement more useful safety features.

would it not be possible to have it so that if DMS is not pressed, it simply sends a low throttle, allowing it to simply kills motors without breaking? that is how my control is currently implemented, if i let off button i merely coast

AND!

id still really like to know how exactly the external switch is implemented and if it will allow for more than one additional external input

what i love about drones is that you have to arm the motors. i want to be sure im sending motor signal with intent lol

The NRF 24 is not very stable compared to this one. Modded Nunchucks have the antenna in a bad location and that is adding to the problem. 
We started with a chipset that only has a 10ths of the WANDs signal strength and that works like a charm already. We did send one of the low signal strength remotes to SF.
The WAND has a much better chip now and so far we are totally happy. 
The big difference to PPM is reliable signal loss detection, which also helps to smoothen things out (just in case...)

This entire build is on par with that of a video game controller... except that video game controllers are at least ergonomic. This is a poorly made Wii remote dressed up in carbon fiber. I'm sorry to be mean, but this remote is a total design fail and catastrophe. I expected a lot better from the man himself. I hope this came from the distant future where you intend to return to the drawing board and come back with something much, much better. I'd like to suggest using an actuator (thumb-wheel/trigger) that belongs on a vehicle. I employed one that is used on fighter-jets on my DIY build. That matters. Not weather or not you can use it as a level.

To be fair, no one of us had it in the hand for now. How can you know how it will feel in your hand or how the throttle response is? If you don’t like the design than that’s fine, tastes are different and nobody makes you to buy it. I also expected something more ergonomic but hey, if it works out nicely with a solid connection and proper throttle response I don’t mind how it looks.

Protocol: read more here: https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/nordic/b/blog/posts/intro-to-shockburstenhanced-shockburst.

The WAND can also communicate with the older NRF24 based recievers Benjamin designed years back.
The other Magic is the option to communcate via Bluetooth Low Energy at the same time, so that App connectivity is given while using the same NRF-dongle to connect to WAND and stream real time data to the remote while recieving your input commands. Pretty trick!

No issue at all. You can use the WAND with any VESC based ESC that can run VESC-Tool.
We could make a very basic FW that allows you to use it with pretty much any Vesc based ESC with UART.

The beauty about the WAND is its high integration into the VESC software environment. 
It basically replaces the need to use an APP for RT-Data and basic Configuration.
It is so much more than a simple remote! It's magic.

@Surfer Then you need extra electronics to step down voltage and charge the lipo. The microprocessor runs at 3.3V. That stuff consumes energy again. Benjamin and I knew from the start that 2x AAA is the way to go. The remote uses 15 mA only. AAAs have 1000mAh.
That's 66hours of battery life, or 1300km of riding at 20km/h. That's an insane battery life! 

Shorter is too short. It has the perfect length. I did 20 different prototypes from Styrofoam and gave them to many people with different hand sizes.

That thing has no channels! This is not a simple PPM stick with limited channels. 
For lights we could soft code an interface and you could use that to switch your lights. 
Could also be done via IMU and gesture control. Shake left for left blinker, hold up and press button for headlights etc. 
That's all future music until a switching board for light is designed, which interacts with the VESC. 
The FW can be updated and the remote can get such an update at any time.

So the reason for not using 18650 was wasting power in electronics regulators and the goal was minimise consumption.

[quote="trampa, post:283, topic:94611"]
Then you need extra electronics to step down voltage and charge the lipo. The microprocessor runs at 3.3V. That stuff consumes energy again.

Then you go on to say you have to use electronic regulators with any battery source.

I’m playing devils advocate hear as I believe aaa is a better option than 18650 in this type of application of small drain over long time period. as well as putting my money were my mouth is and per ordered last month but you are contradicting you self in you own statements of Reason for aaa over 18650.

My justification is 
aaa lighter and the chemistry is better suited to long term storage over 18650 but the trade of is power density and max continues amp rating. IMO both of these are not advantages in this application. You could look at button batteries but then you need to compare cost and availability and that brings you back to AA AAA as more suitable option.

The one thing I think is missing is been able to charge the batteries thro a USB port on the side with out removing the batteries. But for how often thay will need to be changed it’s a feature I can live with out.

I'm still on my first set of batteries (-; The Wand is highly efficient. Swapping batteries takes like 30 seconds. Sometimes I need 5 minutes to find the bloody USB cable, or its in use, charging a phone.

I know you can set the VESC to a fixed brake, but a soft brake increasing over time would be better.

First off all, we have no cutouts with this remote. The wand uses a communication protocol, so the VESC pretty much knows what is going on. With PPM the VESC is taking commands blindly, with NRF that is not the case. What the VESC does when the communication is interrupted, is a matter of the VESC FW, not the remote FW. Auto brake comes with upsides and also several downsides. It can catch you unprepared and sometimes you would want your board to roll rather than brake. It really depends on the situation you are in. The best thing is when dropouts don't happen in the first place. This was one of the reasons to develop the Wand.

It knows what is going on between the remote and VESC, but it can't know if you are riding on a road or in the forest. So when it comes to failsafe braking (free rolling or better applying soft brakes), that is a matter you need to decide as a user when you have a DIY project. The topic was failsafe barking as far as I remember....  
This is a highly debatable feature. The most important thing is to have a stable connection at any time and that is what we want to offer.

literally everything uses a communication protocol. Cheap china remotes, bluetooth remotes (bluetooth is a communication protocol based on 2.4ghz), and yes the wand.

[quote="trampa, post:308, topic:94611"]

What does this even mean? nRF52 is a series of SoCs developed by Nordic Semi for wireless communications over 2.4Ghz. It has zero bearing on what the VESC does or does not know. Tons of remotes use chips from this series. Are you saying the VESC will pretty much know what's going on with every remote that uses nRF52?

If I may assume what you mean, I think what you're really trying to say is that you're controlling the VESC over UART. Even then the rest of your answer reads like you're avoiding the question.

Wireless communication is lossy *by nature*. It doesn't matter what your success rate is, at some point in time the signal will drop, whether it's too many bad packets or heavy interference or whatever. When (not if) that happens, what will be the failsafe? It's ok to just say it's nothing, because for most of us that's the expected answer, but "we have no cutouts" is not a valid answer.

as @sofu said, while i can appreciate the efforts to make the wireless communication bulletproof, it's always a "when" and not an "if" the connection drops.

Wether it's a connection coming loose or just batteries running out (when you forgot about them after 50h...), there's always a risk of it happening. And that's not blaming your product, it's just the reality of wireless communication.

And while i understand that the Wand remote communicates via UART between dongle and VESC, that doesn't mean anything for failsafe until it's actually implemented.

What i would want from the Wand, Dongle or VESC Firmware is a customizable failsafe routine. That could be going neutral, braking with a fixed value or a customizable slope. Maybe even according to different rider profiles.
I've been trying out the slope thing on my DIY Remote and i think it's manageable for most riders once they tried it safe conditions. Maybe even make the braking power increase in relation to the current speed or something.

Yeah i know it's possible for the VESC to do that and, in theory, for anyone to program that themselfes, it's just something i'd like to add to the conversation about a proper VESC Remote. 

I'm totally on board with VESC remote and a high quality RF chipset though, i'm tired of my board tying to murder me all the time due to my stubborn DIY Remote attempts :sweat_smile:

Correct, FW on the VESC is something that can be changed and adopted to your needs. 
That is why Benjamin has it OS. You can look at the code and if someone has a clever idea, he can suggest something or code something new. Via Pull Request new code can find it's way into the software and this way things go forward. Tech changes, ideas happen....
In contrast the PPM remotes are a black box and limited in how we can improve things.

From the short amount of time I had it in my hands I can say that its weight is really nice in the hand and the size overall feels good. 

It’s actually the first thing I noticed how the weight feels in your hand. It’s good. 

If you’ve had an rc mini remote in your hands then this wand is heavier. Not by much. 

In fact I think it feels as heavy or slightly heavier than an iPhone 7 which I’m holding now. 

The thumb trigger feels good. Better than the nano x or it’s variants. It feels like it has some quality to it. Not flimsy. 

I feel stupid for not taking pictures of it or a video. I guess I was too busy scoring some vescs.

It does feel good in your hands with a nice weight to it. It also has the feel of something well designed and built. Only time will tell if it is a good product and if it will ace the tight scrutiny of this community.

I have a Photon remote and for some reason I'm unable to get rid of the enormous dead band. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but it really annoys me that an expensive remote has that sort of issue. I'll be on the lookout for a new remote soon, and the Wand and the upcoming Enertion remote will be on my list of potential upgrades. Though I must say that I will never, ever, buy anything on pre-order ever again. Still waiting on Unities.

[quote="trampa, post:233, topic:94611, full:true"]
Dead man switch sounds like a good idea, but can be very dangerous if it applies a brake if not pushed. A remote can slip out of your hands while you still stand on the board! That’s why you want to use a wrist leash. If the board continues rolling when the dead man switch is not pushed it is not very useful, since the board can travel quite a distance rolling to a stop. If it applies a brake it can send you flying. Neither setup is desirable. If you have a crash holding onto your remote, the switch is not necessarily triggered.

We looked into that and analysed all scenarios. A built in IMU gives you better options to implement more useful safety features.
[/quote]

How does IMU crash feature differs from dead man switch? How does vesc wand remote behave when it falls off your hand?

I just can't see a difference between detecting crash via DMS or IMU. In booth cases the board needs to behave somehow, either let it roll or apply breaks.

I guess this whole thread is the reason why I never heard back from my email to Benjamin Vedder about my remote concept a few months ago.

Ben was super busy in the last month's. He has probably not seen it.
Nice renderings BTW.

The procedure doesn't mention how to connect the VESC to the WAND.
On mine, there is no connector. But one is delivered with the SWD connector.

Do we have to solder the connector ? Then desolder it after flashing ?
Or do we try to only make contact (and not moving !) during flash ??
Please explain a bit more this part.

You get enough contact if you simply insert it.
If you loose contact the upload will fail.

And then brick the WAND ?

Obviously you SWD program it..... There is currently no bootloader to brick.

Can anyone confirm how dual focbox is setup? I know the headers mentioned above are required for firmware updates, but I currently have a split ppm setup and if ppm is gone then does it have to be canbus connected ie master slave?

Canbus please. The Wand connects to the Master and Slave follows.

The latest VESC-Tool comes with a **new firmware** for the WAND. 
With the new FW the wand can be used while the Wand logo displays. 
If the Wand reboots for whatever reason, you have full control over your board within milliseconds.

Why would the Wand reboot? Even milliseconds are scary.

Eventually any system can crash. The chance is very rare though. However, in that case the system reboots within a time frame you can't even notice. It's instant.

Can you please give me some more? I believe a VESC unit has more hardware and software than the WAND. And VESCs don't reset or anything either. I am looking for the most reliable remote controller.  I don't really care about telemetry and display and all that unnecessary stuff. The eskate community needs a reliable remote in the first place, after that all the other stuff. PLEASE can you make some special Wand firmware purely for the control? No resets, no stupid buggy software, I just want that potentiometer to work that/s it. Everyone wqould appreciate that, I wanna stay alive, I don't care about the wand knowing when I am not using it and crap like that (noo offense) Am not paying 200 euros for something that occasionally restarts... That's BS.  I am sad, I will go for Futaba, that is the most reliable... If you figure out why the Wand sometimes resets and you fix it, I might buy it after another year of people using it... Not until then...

The Wand runs a chip level operating system (RTOS software). Benjamin found a bug in the software and fixed it short after. Since then we never ever had a crash of the system. It is not more prone to a system crash than a VESC or any other device featuring a chipset. However, we implemented a software watchdog and even if it restarts (very unlikely to happen), you can't feel it. Its instant without a time frame for booting. We tested that out. 

Eventually any remote runs some sort of software btw! 

With the latest FW update: If you shut down a Wand, give full throttle and press a button to switch it on, the motors will spin up the very millisecond you press the button. It is instant.
