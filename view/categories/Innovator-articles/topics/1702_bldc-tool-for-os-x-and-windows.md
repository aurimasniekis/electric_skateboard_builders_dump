I downloaded newest BLDC version from Your site yesterday, somehow it does not want to work on my macbook air, I have OS X El Capitan 10.11.4 Beta (maybe that's why...) Older BLDC version which I downloaded some time ago worked though. Thanks for Your input to community and developing iOS app for VESC, what hardware will be nescessary (simple bluetooth module?) to allow it communication with VESC?

It could be requiring the beta version as I'm not on that and if could be that I need to update Xcode and recompile it. But I can't test as I don't want Togo to a beta build of OS X

I had to recompile it locally, since there is a dependency pointing to your local qt setup inside the build in your version. It works now for me, but it could be that others are having that problem too.

You could test it with this one, I made it myself so no guarantees for OSX 10.11.4 Beta :wink:
