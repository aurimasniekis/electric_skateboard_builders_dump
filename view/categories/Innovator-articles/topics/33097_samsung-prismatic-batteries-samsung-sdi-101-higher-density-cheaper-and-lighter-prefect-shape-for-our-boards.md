srry those modules are different than what I saw. I meant the powerwall modules. but one i saw is $200 for 60ah. large and heavy and slow. and not Lithium
but upon some research those are only available for really large vendors like a car company. not even sure if the mass production is available. maybe this guy can buy https://m.facebook.com/jehugarciapublic/
