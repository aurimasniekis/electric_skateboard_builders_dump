Uses rare prototype sharkwheels in 80mm that they dont sell, snowboard bindings, and a cool pop in-and-out drone battery.   A guy made these and sent me the pics.  I used to skate a lot.   he wants 2 more motors for the other.  way overpowered.

That's wild. Looks like it's ready to dump you on your ass, but pretty interesting build. Needs a wheelie bar and a longer wheelbase.

I bought one of those inline boards with two caster wheels for kids.  Pretty fun.  I want to try the board where the axle is a long hoop and it holds a couple wheels all parallel.  Don't think I'd want either powered but haven't tried that

I was the inventor and engineer you see plugging stuff in.   I told Joe the physics were wrong with that much power,  but he wanted ACME skates.   I made a set up for myself on correct center of gravity and it worked great.   But,  I didn't crash so the video is a bit more boring.

I'm the designer and builder of these guys. I haven't got 'em going yet, but I'm getting closer. Just need to make a couple of axle spacers that go between the motors and the skate truck. Then some electronic work and they'll be ready,

One doesn't need two powered skates to ride, and four motors, probably, would be overpowered, but I think both skates should be. Very useful to be able to skate right and left directions with power. It's a skate thing, lol.

I like Hummie's idea of a single motor, asymmetrical mounting. I think that would be ideal for these skates. We'll see what kind of motors I can come up with in the future, but for right now, those steel hubs sure do fit well.

Anyway, thanks for looking and sure will keep ya posted.

Lol the idea is fun but may add too much bulk on the side. A russian guy has made a similar contraption to your idea with very long frames and scooter wheels, all was running on a belt drive.  Brakes and corners where a no-go, the quads shown here would simply perform better.

If I had a belt id want that. If I had that maybe I'd want a belt. A mount that had a solid gear connection at 90 degrees like that, who does that. Whats ur design these days @vanarian.  I used to ride quads like a maniac downtown and back home back and forth all over.  Jamming wheels together to brake. I can go downhill a 5 degree maybe and ride pushing one quad into the other from the rear. Blades I can't stop! I can end in a huge spin that's terrifying.  Quads w laces super loose, lowcut, is a fun way to get around the city. Slippers w wheels. I can kick them off. W no heel and pretend ur just walking.  grocery shopping w carts or not late at night Ill be doing again

@ Vanarian, I've been wanting to talk to you for a long time. Just can't seem to get back on Endless Sphere anymore. Something about it cannot find my username or email address properly. I read all your threads when I was on there before about you building your skates. You were a real inspiration and gave me a lot of incentive to build my skates.

I don't have a video yet, but maybe I will finally get one. I have one skate done and it works really well. Working on the other one. First one uses a DJY drone battery. The second one has a DJY drone battery too, but it is smaller and should work better. Just a battery I a small case and a VESC in a small case.

Anyway sure good to finally talk to ya.

@skslingo21 The wheels are Shark Wheels. They roll really good They're fast! They look square but they're not. I've enough work getting these going without riding on square wheel.  lol  Shark Wheels are really cool though. The 75 mm and 80 mm are going to be out, maybe, end of this year.  I got 80 mm on mine but just happen to get 2 sets of prototype wheels. Right place at the right time.They make 70 mm now for skateboards. Ya ought to check 'em out.

the only bulk on the side is just the motor and gear! you can fit a bunch of cells under your feet too, and if they are staggared they wouldnt add too much height, maybe an inch above the center of the wheel.

Man, this is too much honor ! I'm glad I was able to help you somewhat and that you found inspiration in my work. Nice to talk you to ya too, if you visit France don't hesitate to send a message we can try to meet and get a drink or/and ride them skates.

I look forward to see your quads roll btw. Didn't imagined that the DJI batteries could provide enough power, that's a good call.

@Hummie That's the feeling, it never grows old right ? Well I went pretty long way from last time I did post on E-S, sorry for lack of updates. I suck at communication when I do something ! I've randomly shot short vids during build and all but never linked them to upload, silly me.

If you can wait next week I'll gladly show you how my design went. 

I reduced my hubs rim cage a lot, smaller size bearings too (72mm ones were simply too big despite strength and only compatible with 125mm wheels). I can squeeze them 50mm in 80mm wheels if required. It is pretty good as far as structural strength and slim profile go, love the look too. The rims give good air flow decompression. I simply want to add waterproof/dustproof directly inside the motors to keep the airflow. This is still work in progress.

I killed the added height between frame and boot, now it is just like standard frames. New frame design allows to save all the wheels ! I focused on the 3x3 wheels setups because it is really fun. Tried it in Barcelona quickly with Flying Eagle skates, way lighter and more agile than my Doop Freestyle, which are already centuries better than my old Roces M12. 

The batteries soles give me a hard time because I grew lazy on them haha 
That's also because I'm squeezing a lot inside apart from the cells ; I've done solderless sturdy slim packs for my batteries, I'm testing the Tesla style single cell-fuse with my LG HB2 too. I also got to test many connectors. And everything is supposed to remain very compact so when I corner or slide I don't scratch the box if I don't fall.

ESC boxe is also giving me a good fight, my VESC are the ones from Rogier Wolff "rew" and damn they're big. I got lot of cooling and arduino to fit inside too because I'm testing lot of stuff currently. My wife is very keen on this point, she accepted to bear with all my gadgets invading the living room. I'll give you more details next week promise.

nobody is doing it yet! its at least the least goofy and most visial appealing design without everything sticking out the back. I just need someone to machine an aluminum sled for all of the batteries with an integrated front and rear axle for the 2 wheels and also an integrated motor mount to mount the motor vertically. If someone gives me a quote Im down to cosider funding a prototype. just need a maybe 20x20x0.5 inch aluminum sheet and maybe a traditional skateboard axle we can cannibalize and retrofit to the aluminum right? I know nothing of making round metal pieces ;/

edit: so far found a $284 plus shipping quote for a 2ft by 2ft sheet of .5 inch 6061 aluminum. Not a bad start!

edit. even better is 1ft by 2ft 6061 for $155. would weigh 15lbs before shaving most of it away, which is just 2lbs heavier than my eboard.

I'm interested in the mount you would make.  whats the difference between the cone shaped gears you posted above vs a non-conical gear?  draw it up.   Id do steel cogs.   with no belt to tension and no adjustability it'd need precise machining and a good mating of the two cogs that wouldn't bend  of course. 

  ...  if you come up with a good design first, probably in cad with all the parts in mesh to make sure, I'm down to work with you to get it made.

instead of doing a bolt on mount how about a cast or machined hanger with the mount attached. 


 or to go real diy and keep it really cheap you could cast the mount onto a regular hanger with a good mold.  so a composite hanger.  a mold with a hanger and carbon in it and you pour the resin, vacuum it and pop it out.  .then you'd just need the two cogs and a way to mount the wheel cog to the wheel.  I like this way and have done similar.  you could make the mold from a hanger and hard wax, then when you cast it you stick in a new hanger.

@Hummie motor mount would be just like the ones were already using, minus the clamp. hopefully this picture makes sense. Im about to go in to work and had to set this up quickly!

that why the 90 degree spiral bevel gearing is necessary. Largest contact patch between gears in the most compact and allows to use a simpler chasis with less parts. with a size 42 shoe I can fit i think 14 or 15 cells in a single row, 28 or 30 if the cells are staggered in two rows. Still 100% thinking out loud here, I'll get to work on a cad file asap!

the shoe thing I don't know about but the mount design seems cool.  cant see much in this photo.  id rather have it pointed frontward or backward not upright as in this pic but that's nitpicking.  with the casting method...if you get a hanger and shape hard wax around it exactly as you'd like it to be, then the hard silicone mold, which will likely need to be 3 or more parts,  will pop it out in a solid resin and carbon composite,,..you could have an awesome design with the gears protected and all types of shaping that you couldn't do with machining.   or just get the whole hanger machined or cast with the mount.  as I said.  casting it in aluminum by a pro place will cost a lot and it'd need to be more than just gravity casting.  machining would be maybe better.  Id forget doing any of it with outside help and make the part in wax on a hanger and made the silicone mold because even WHEN it needs to be corrected somehow and maybe you even need to do a whole new silicone mold its pretty cheap and the time spent is fun.  
We're not on topic here but I'm really into this.  minimal parts.  solid.  ..if only it could be made quiet, and especially with the versatility of the composite shaping you could cup everything in a way to retain the noise I bet.  
but in your pic you have the connection between the cogs on the outside of the wheel and then the structure would have to be much bigger and stronger.   why not just to the inside?
the wheel pulley will likely need to be custom made but the other I think would be easy to get.  few parts total.

I'm back after 10 continuous hours of work lol f*ked up saturday.

Mike I actually dumped the 2 wheels setup because apart from skatepark grind, it applies too much stress on the wheels and bearing thus making a pretty bad rolling, cornering and braking performance. 

I know some DIY models which roll 2 wheels though and without growing a big head, I know my stuff  when it comes to inline frames. 

If you're ready to fund some electronics I'd gladly make a proto with mount/frame combo for ya. By electronic I'm simply thinking about a standard motor that you'd choose. Tacon, turnigy Sk, Racerstar, no name, whatever as long as it fits your bill. Sidemount can allow 63mm, why not. 

I'm getting back in contact with friend engineers working as teachers in a school (they came back from holidays), they have all the big CNC machines to make it happen. Just learnt what I needed to convert my frame to "production possible" from them and can ask for a pair of frames / mounts if needed, even 3D printed quick proto part first (their printer leaves mine not in the dust but outside in the street). 

2 wheels allow for groove too so you may want a stunt style frame with protected electronics inside, UFS ready instead of 165mm ? If @Hummie brings his knowledge in choosing the gear parts we can nail it.

Can u get a quiet meshing of gears w them oriented axially instead of at the 9o degree. Can u avoid the need for compression that the 90 degree or less connection would cause?  The meeting comes is awesome looking but if they can avoid the need for tnrust bearings but still get a smooth connected coggingfree and tight contact w no noise?  That'd be easier to do.  Or even a 5degree anglr and a little compression if from a slight anglr if its a key ingredient.  Whatever it takes to make it silent really is what I want.  What's the shape of those metal gears

Well I never looked into gears reduction in detail apart from theory... My guess is we could look for helical pinions to get the job done. A bigger gear diameter attached to the skate wheel that needs to be driven. With a proper hole in top / side of frame it is achievable.

Easier to make than DIY Leiftech system!

a normal pulley you can get a 1:3  or 4 ratio at most, because of the pulley size,  this can do much bigger ratio I bet with a smaller diameter gear that can fit.  
the double helix needs no thrust bearings and doesn't load axially.  
these things are very close in efficiency to belts....how do they compare?

these things I bet can be made quieter than a pulley by a long shot.
these things if made in good steel could last a very long time, probably a really long time if you protected it but Id definitely want to ride it open to see and hear.

the herringbone gear in the pic is a version of the double helical but a huge pain to make and instead this is also a double helical but with the gap between and just as good at not having an axial load.

still like the double helical 
something like this with no angle could keep the motor tight to the truck.

Haha easier is not the word I'd use about hub integration and don't underestimate your idea!

@SirDiff From my understanding Jedboard gears allows better inertia and less friction thus rolling resistance is very low, close to non motorized boards. It does help a lot! 

@Hummie gears are bound to be loud if running open. What about a casing with sound deadening foam to kill the noise? It will be less pretty but it will sure help.

Edit : why not single helical? You get a short bare shaft with helical on one end so you can recycle straight pinions from existing drives. Saves both time and money for proto!

```
The double helical stops axial thrust which will happen w a regular helical and, besides the regular helical therefore needing a thrust bearing , noise is still produced in possibly many places connected due to the axial force's vibrations .  a single helical may have a nice quiet mating of parts and an ideal shape but be noisey.  If going for the quietest the double helical seems king. Probably the most efficient too.  When will you be finished w a double helical build hopefully @itsmikeholland ?
Could come w a replacement doub heli shaft for the motor, the hanger with a super tight motor shaft to axle gap (the hanger w a recess in the aluminum for the motor diameter getting really close,  and the wheel pulley probably needs a better support than just the wheel and would mount to the axle, so a longer span of axle to fit it and the wheel and maybe a true 8mm fitting bearing for precision instead of typical 5/16 bearing or whatever they use in skate wheels. 

This could be the most efficient drive mechanically and with up to 1:10 gear reduction possible the motor and whole system could be the most efficient. I only want it if it's quiet
