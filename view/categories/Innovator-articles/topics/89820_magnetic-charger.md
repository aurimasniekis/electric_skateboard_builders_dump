Hi !
I read a few posts about some people that tried to build a reliable and secure magnetic charge port for eskates. So now i want to ask if any of you are interested in developing a magnetic connector that is capable of delivering 42V 4A and not taking up to much space.
Cheers

Have you checked out the Rosenberger RoPD series? They're pricey though. What would be the aim of the project you're proposing? Lower costs, improved form factor, (...)?
