Sooo I have never been happy with my enclosures, they were either to square, too tall, or looked like crap. I also don't have enough money to buy some of the beautiful enclosures made by members here ... @psychotiller, @bigben, @MasterCho and @Eboosted all ring a bell.


I thought how hard can it be, so I went down to Bunnings and looked in the scrap bin and would you imagine what was there... everything I would need to make a basic vacuum table. I got everything for $3 and went off home to drill 225 holes into it. I sealed it up with some silicone looking stuff and its now ready for some hot plastic.

The Final product is this.

Hmm yeah, might work, you will use 3mm abs? Make sure the heat circulates good :slight_smile:

I hope so, I've heard of a few people doing it. I'm actually going to test styrene and abs. I couldn't get any 3mm stuff so I got 5 sheets of 2mm styrene and 1 sheet of 4mm abs I think

Sounds awesome let me know how it goes, I was thinking of using 1mm styrene and then fibreglass but it was going to become too expensive and more complicated than it needed to be

I think if I can get it good (nice shinny etc) it will be a hot seller ;) So try to make it also, it's not that hard

So Iâ€™ve finally made some progress. The styrene and abs sheets have arrived and I hope to do my first attempt later today. Any tips and tricks from the pros would be great

Iâ€™ve made the mound/buck and a little frame for holding the sheets while they are heated

I had a go at this A while back, unfortunately I made the build area slightly to small for doing enclosures. Got ahead of myself. But it works great for making canopies for rc aircraft. 

It has a surge system, as well as a positive pressure system to keep the material from sagging. The action is run by air pistons

Damn thatâ€™s a f*ing awesome idea. That looks like the coolest vacuum table Iâ€™ve ever seen, way cooler than mineðŸ˜‚
