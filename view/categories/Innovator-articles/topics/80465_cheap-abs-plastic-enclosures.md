Battery enclosures can be expensive. The small DIYeboard enclosures can be $30, and the large flexible Lacroix style enclosures can cost hundreds. As a cheapo myself, I wanted to look for a super cheap enclosure for my 12s6p build, but I didn't get many options below the $50 mark. The cheapest I found was this:
https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07JG41Z2R/ref=ox_sc_act_image_10?smid=A2MAPM9P562WJD&psc=1
But while this may seem like a good deal, I would like to remind you guys that ABS plastic cases can actually cost less than a dollar to make. And since I want to save money in every area of my cheap beast build, I don't see why it should be impossible to cut at least $20 off even this super cheap enclosure cost. So I have an idea. Just an idea, but stick with me. This is an electronic enclosure wholesaler I found:
https://www.polycase.com
And here's a quick ebay search of ABS enclosures:
https://m.ebay.com/sch/i.html?kw=electronic+enclosure
How difficult would it be to either get a group together to make custom enclosures that would benefit the community? These would sell for <$15 a piece or even less. Or, we could innovate on the enclosures that already exist to create a solution that can save us the tens of dollars that we need to spend on batteries and motors (string multiple smaller ABS enclosures together? This can even help with flex). 

Tell me what you guys think. I'm interested in bringing this part of the build forward. There have been many innovations in motors, mounts, drive trains, batteries, etc, but I'm interested in whether we can figure out a cheap solution for enclosures that will be customizable and as strong as any $80 case.

The best solutions is to create your own enclosures with a vacuum former (is this the right name in english ?)
You heat up a sheet of abs and then put it on tope of foam with the shape that you want, cooling and vacuum will ensure a solid, custom made enclosure in no time !

If you could arrange it for $15 a lot of the people would buy. Make a poll of what dimension they would prefer and ask for a quote on the 2 most popular models. 

I can help you with the design for free. I have a $80 abs enclosure that's pretty strong and I have also made 3d printed enclosures. They are pretty cheap too($15 for petg)

You can buy abs sheets and with a mold and a vacuum bag or vacuum table you can do you own enclosures.

I used to work at a place that used Polycase enclosures and they were very good. also a little foam tape around the joint where it closes and they were quite waterproof too.

I had never considered them for esk8 but some of there enclosure look like they could be good sizes.  ![](https://www.polycase.com/uploads/178851535650166-xl.png) https://www.polycase.com/ag-54 looks like it could be a good dual ESC or unity case, removable panel would make mounting connectors easy.

shame they dont have "segments" with the same profile that could make a modular flexy enclosure

Yeah I noticed none of them seem specifically large enough for most battery cases, but I'm thinking some of them might be perfect for 2s6p/6s2p to use alone or in series with other cases.

Yeah, I love the guy, but I'm going for a "cheap beast" build. Here's just an idea of how cheap the build is. The deck will be $35, the 12s6p including bms will be under $500, and the trucks and wheels will be under $100. I'm going for either a Turnigy sk8 or a Hobbysky for $90, and all the other parts I'm looking to get for under $50ish. The cheaper and higher quality the better. I really think it's possible not to skimp on too much quality yet still save hundreds of dollars. Kinda like fine wine😂

Its cheap because its junk.  Its 1/16 2nd qual ABS.  The angles are too sharp and the silly logo doesn't do anything to strengthen the enclosure, it in fact weakens it.  

Please don't buy this.  If you wanna waste 30 bucks, send it to me and @Sender.  We will drink it up and toast you the entire time :slight_smile:

Personally I don't get it. You love my stuff and message me all the time. Yet, you haven't bought anything that I make and pretty much just ask me questions about cheap shit or TB parts...

There's a disconnect somewhere. Do you think that for a 3rd of the price, you'll end up with exactly the same thing? Do you feel that you'll actually build a "beast" of a board for $700? 

When it's done, since you're in Philly, Please do a comparison ride test thread of your build and the build I'm making for Jonifin right now. 

Thanks!!

I know, I know... You're right. I do love your stuff. You're a pillar for the community, I and I do bother you way too much😂

But you're still kind, and I appreciate that. I actually just went to your website and I wouldn't mind spending $60 or $70 for your enclosures. Seems like high quality, and I'm cool with supporting your work.

But as a student, I have a VERY limited budget. Yet I'm still super into beast customs. Obviously that seems like a dilemma. How can I get cheap parts that are also inexpensive? It depends. Most people think you get what you pay for, but as a business student, in my experience, that's only true some of the time. The reason for this is that prices may be inflated, and customers assume that you get 10/10 quality for $100 and 5/10 quality for $50, whereas in reality, it's totally feasible and profitable for companies to still make 10/10 quality parts for $70. The issue lies in the customer assumption of the actual price of getting what you pay for. For example, Apple charges $1k for their phones. You can get an Android for the literal same exact specs for $500 from a reputable and high quality company. But people assume that the quality they get from buying a phone for $1k is higher than the quality they get for $500. I hope I'm not being too ranty or confusing. My ultimate goal is really just to help the community find those cheap parts that are still high quality, yet fall more into the realistic range of price to quality without the assumption inflation. Hobbyking has parts that are extremely durable for very cheap. I recently saw their motor mount selling for like $10, and in a thread here, saw people comparing it to their $40/$50 mounts with ease. 

Ultimately, it's not always the price that determines the quality. But it's definitely harder to find higher quality parts at lower prices when they just mix in with the 5/10 quality for $50 crowd.

@psychotiller I'm sorry I do bother you a lot, but to be honest, you introduced me to this community, and you've been very patient with me, so I'll heed your advice for my first build and go for your enclosure, but in the future, I hope that you see that I just want to help the community drive manufacturer prices down for their high quality parts.

Again, sorry for the rant.

Problem with both of these statements is they are pretty much wrong. People always post up great reviews of these cheap offerings. how can you trust what they say, when they obviously haven't spent the money on the good stuff to do solid side by side comparisons. Why would anybody buy good proven components, then waste money on a hobbyking mount or esc? I'm telling you. cheap shit mounts from ebay or hobby king made for clone caliber 2's do not compare.

this has been deeply explored before. countless people buy Chinese parts to build boards and end up spending twice as much in the end. said it before and gonna say it again. 
Don't get into diy esk8 if you cant afford it. buy a meepo and comeback when you realize you want more.

I have an Ownboard. Deck recently snapped when going over some trolley tracks, but I'd ridden it for a couple hundred miles no-issue. It wasn't as durable as say, Boosted, but I enjoyed it more than when I tested Boosted. Cheap doesn't always mean vastly worse. Sometimes it only means a little bit worse with some opinionated wiggle room.

It seems to be a political issue on here to spend as much as possible because that must automatically mean you're getting high quality parts. I do my research. I look at reviews, and I compare quality and prices. I don't assume that less expensive equals less quality just because of an immediately assumed customer philosophy. I'll buy a $100 part if it's better than a $50 part, but if I see a thread on here comparing the two and people are vouching for the cheaper part, I have no issue spending less. In this case, spending $50 is getting what you pay for. But that doesn't mean that spending $100 is actually getting what you pay for. Perhaps the $100 part is overinflated. I don't buy things because they're expensive. I buy them because they're good. And in other cases, I will find the manufacturer of the same exact part sold by the DIY stores and buy it for $20 less.

$60 on a enclosure is cheap. 
You want cheaper go buy a planter box or Tupperware.
Sure you can buy cheaper parts that might work just fine.
But I bet the people who made those aren't part of our community, aren't here to ask questions or solve problems you have and they aren't trying to develop new products to make the sport better.

Its not political, but this isn't research.

You cannot compare the quality until you have both pieces in hand and test them, our guessing the quality is good enough.  

For the most part, those of us that have a few builds under out belt have made these same mistakes and are only trying to save you grief.  You seem to be intent on making bad purchases.  It's all good, go for it.

To the general public it's the most recognizable esk8 board. You're buying a brand a label.

A printed enclosure is useless, it WILL eventually break unless you skin/reinforce it and then the cost goes way up.  As I said before, if you wanna have these experiences for yourself go for it, there's is lots of value in making mistakes.  Just don't assume because your research says so that you are buying a quality part, because you are probably not.

I was literally just about to say this. I'd rather print with higher quality filament, so maybe $15... Or $20 taking into account materials for finishing it. Tons of time and work though so what's that worth? To me, I just dropped for a paychotiller, but I'd love to try to make my own, either 3D print or vacuum form ABS myself and see how cheap it *can* be.

I respect your experience. That's why I'm here. I'm only suggesting that the assumption that higher price automatically equals higher quality may not always be true. I won't buy the parts if you legitimately have tested them against the pricier parts and believe they are low quality. But most of the parts I'm talking about have never been mentioned on here. I would love to participate in actual research to compare parts. Who doesn't want to save money? If a more expensive part wins, obviously I'm not against that. But what if the cheaper part wins? Research and science is about proving things, not aligning things to assumptions

to my knowledge no one has said that.  Your saying makes the assertion that a $20 3D printed enclosure is as good as @psychotiller's enclosure and it absolutely is not.

Your earlier example of iPhone vs. Android is also not really applicable in this situation.  For the most part we are using small-batch manufacturing for what are fairly simple parts.  The price is figured by cost of material * time for production.   

Outside of the VESC, BMS and Remote none of the parts we use would be considered hi-tech by any other market.  Its an entirely different business model than what you are comparing too.

[/quote]

That's the thing.  It is!

I am going to make a couple of assumptions here.  
1.  The cost of materials for a set of 6 shooters is around $175
2.  The cost of tires and tubes for 6 shooters is around $50

Thats a total cost of production, minus time, of $225 for a product that sells for $300.  The CNC time for a set of 6 shooters, assuming a well trained and experienced machinist, is about 4 hours.  75 / 4 is $18.75 an hour.  So no profit here and paying the machinist shit.

The fact is Dave is the machinist, so Dave is paying himself shit.  I would imagine with material discounts and not worrying about what he pays himself...Dave prolly makes 20 to 30 bucks a set.

No assumption here, 6 shooters are specifically designed for ESK8 and are the best pneumatic wheels available for ESK8.  There was no compensation for all the prototypes or designs that didn't work out.  

Think on that for a bit...

I don't think it's necessary to buy someone's parts to ask them questions. I know I've bothered him too much, it's a bad habit of mine to ask too many questions while trying to understand something. But I sincerely have no issue supporting members of the community. If his parts are $60, and a company's parts are $60, I'd buy it from Psychotiller. But at what point does this flip? If he charges $65? I'd probably still go with his parts. $70? Less certain. If he charges $100 for a comparable part that someone else sells for $60, Im sorry, I have to let my wallet speak for me. I like to support the pillars of the community, but competition is competition (I'm talking about the same quality part. Not Psychotiller vs Chinese). We all go to Walmart instead of local stores sometimes.

Guies, I know it may seem like rookie behavior, but he needs to learn !
The best solution for you if you want a great enclosure at a low cost is find someone near you who has a vacuum former, and ask him if he can do one for you !
This will costs you the time of figuring out how much volume and shape you need, maybe create it with foam, and the ABS sheet (5 bucks or so)

I don't like seeing all of you discussing like this, let's stick to help, and if help is not accepted, someone will learn from his own mistakes !

@Allofyoush you want something cheap and good to you have what it takes to make it?

then go out buy a haxsaw and some aluminum and make a motor mount.
Find lipos on sale on hobbyking and buy an sk3 motor. 
buy some kyndex and get the tools to form it into the needed shape. 
buy focboxes, and buy the cheapest (decent) longboard you can find.

the rest is common knowledge.

Okay this is hilarious. The tens of dollars. I’m dying 🤣 

If you’re worried about saving tens of dollars this probably isn’t the best hobby/sport to get into.

Buy cheap, buy twice.
A lot of the good reviews you see on cheap motors are owned by people who 
1) don’t ride that much. These are toys to them.
2)have multiple boards and don’t use the cheap build every ride.

I’m all for saving money. Anyone who knows me knows I’m always squeezing a dollar out of a dime.
But I also hate having things let me down. I like parts proven to work by the majority not that one guy that still has a diyboard kit that still works great.

 Then he tried comparing Black Friday discounts from places like Walmart and Best Buy that have mass production items .
 He even brought up TVs .
He was explained to by multiple people that you can’t compare the discounts on mass production items that are sold to every household with  items for eSK8 when they are handmade to a very small community.
 And he wouldn’t back down.
 People try to explain it and spell it out for him and he kept pushing the same argument

This is my current plan for my top mount battery. Top slips over bottom and screws in. Bottom is velcroed to the deck. Fits a square brick 10s5p perfectly in the square part before it starts tapering. Top triangle is for unity, davega mounting, and extra wiring junk.

I am not a fan of top mount, but this one I'm working on.  Fits a 12s5p and everything else including VESC's, volt meter, charge port and BMS.  Ill add an integrated XT90-s loop key as well.

![image|642x500](upload://4IG8CL6C02jd8jjyrOwGogthlvR.jpeg) 

Ill probably break it down into 3 different prints with m2 or m3 holes to screw everything together so it can be disassembled for easy access, also easier print.

I like it. Do you think 3d printed will be strong enough?

Also, perhaps there is an ABS box with similar dimensions for $5-$10 on https://www.polycase.com/
that we can use. Top mounted enclosures don't get enough love. They'd be even cheaper than bottom mounted too, because they're just glorified actual boxes.

The weight of the battery should help hold it down. The main force acting to rip it off is lateral so I think it'll be fine with any decent strength velcro.

Making him run the group buy is kind of counterintuitive.
The point of him giving a discount is because you come to him with a large order.
If he ran the group why he's putting in more labor and work into organizing it just for the sake of giving people 10% off.

Got a set of these hubs that have integrated 60t pulleys for 300 yuan and sold the solid tires for 100 so abound 30 usd for a set of hubs with 2 pulleys that perform pretty well (slight wobble)  

This is I think the point of ops thread. Are the tires I got 4 times worse than psycho’s? No they’re the exact same ones. 

Are the hubs I got 7 times worse than psychos six shooter hubs? Don’t think so. 

But if you don’t want the trouble of sourcing these yourselves (quite annoying tbh to find good stuff) and wanna support your local vendors then you should definitely buy from them, maybe even send some beer money. I personally bought psycho’s argonaut enclosure even though shipping was more expensive than the enclosure itself because I did not have the skills to make my own.

@Allofyoush 
I Tried this once... Lets just say we dont talk about how shitty I did. 

Cost came out to about 150 - 200
Vacuum former 50
Decent Vacuum 75
ABS 30 dollars (Lots of Failed attempts) 
And that doesn't include the time needed to do it.

ITS WAYYYY Cheaper just to get from @Psychotiller if you want quality

So true! I messaged you ages ago about a potentially deeper enclosure; you responded promptly and explained why you wouldn't/don't make deeper enclosures. So I went about making my own thanks to my university's vacuum former. I ruined a few sheets of kydex and went through 5 versions (I think) before I made a decent looking, reliable case.

This was a spare one I made that has been sitting in my closet.  It was designed to hold two Meepo 10s2p packs or one DIYeboard 10s5p pack. I have since moved on to building my own batteries and a pair of eBoosted enclosures :smile:

Hobbyking has parts that are extremely durable for very cheap. I recently saw their motor mount selling for like $10, and in a thread here, saw people comparing it to their $40/$50 mounts with ease.

Hoobyking's motor mount is a piece of dog shit.

Why don't you use that to get to school/work and see how long until you miss a quiz/shift because of it?  If you're so smart, you should have no problem explaining that to your professor/boss.  You decided to save $10 and the thing that holds your motor on your vehicle and now it broke-down because of that, which you will end up spending more than $10 to fix.  Genius.

When you come off hot and heavy stating nobody else knows what they are doing, it's no surprise when it's actually you who doesn't.

Esk8 take a lot of abuse with vibrations and water/brine and have to be EXTREMELY durable.  Way more than other products.  If you don't make it correctly, it will break immediately. (Of course you will get that one ride for youtube or your homework assignment....)

A lot of things I made broke on the first ride even....

But you choose not to listen to that because you want to feel the stuff breaking for yourself, which is fine.  But stating that will be "cheaper" is not factual because you will spend more in the end, like so many folks here that are trying to tell you something.

Hey Brian I think the point is how much value do you get for each dollar spent, cheap crap does suck, but there’s a point where you’re spending somewhat unnecessary money unless you really like that product. 

For example, I’ve had 8 boards from 2016, evolves, arc boards, an ownboard, a raptor 2, 4 diys , and the only one that hasn’t broke down on me has been the 2000 yuan (300 usd) ownboard on an icarus deck. The rest especially the evolve and raptor, they’ve both broken down more times than I can count on both hands and feet. I’ve ridden all of them a lot, at least a thousand Kms each(3-4k on the evolve and raptor)  with the exception of the arc and my most recent diy

It’s the illusion of quality that comes with price, which is the point here. There can be cheap and great stuff like boardnamics 15 and 20 dollar mounts, and then expensive crap like mboards reseller parts or evolve boards. 

I’d say after using @riverside.rider haggy parts they seem to have the best value for $ if you want performance. His service is impeccable too.  

Even the raptor 2 that uses high quality parts run into so many issues, due to how many parts there are, and how easy it is to fuck up on the assembly line due to the complexity of assembly compared to say a boosted or meepo.

This seems to happen a lot. I feel like you have been pretty respectful and haven't really said much to piss anyone off, imo.

Either way, I like the topic of this thread and some of the on topic discussion has been great. I'm all for saving money, and like the Chinese six shooter thread or whatever it is, I'm one of those people who are willing to compromise in certain areas just because I don't have thousands or even hundreds to spend Willy nilly after having bought some quality parts that matter. 

I love the idea of just a rubber sheet as a replacement for an enclosure, maybe some nylon printed reinforcement for impact resistance under there would be great. 

And I had no idea about that polycase company... They have full aluminum enclosures (dual ESC sized) for $25, I'm thinking the enclosure could be an integrated heatsink itself with some thermal adhesive and neoprene foam... Mmm

Thank you, I appreciate that. 

I use adhesive neoprene instead of rubber. It's more like foam, so it encases the edges of your enclosure more while still providing protection against water.

Yes, I was just looking at their aluminum enclosures. They would only work top mounted, but they're ridiculously cheap, and they're thick and heat wicking.

Well this thread is a train wreck.

I think that OP started this thread with the best intentions.  He clearly stated that he was having trouble finding cheaper alternative to a custom enclosure. I don't think anyone here thinks that a cheep abs case is as good as a custom enclosure but sometimes spending that much money is not an option. The point here was to find some acceptable solution for those on a tight budget.
He then suggests a good supplier that I've never seen mentioned here before. They have some great looking cases for someone who wants an easy or temporary solution.
He then asks for community feedback and invites discussion around developing cheaper cases. IMO that's a pretty good first post.

yet some how we ended up here, where all productive discussion has been drowned out by shit flinging.

I do believe you get what you pay for and you can't compare cheep hardware like hobby king mounts to the custom things that our skilled forum members make.
But I also believe there is value the assessing solutions that provide good "bang for your buck". Whilst the hobby king mounts might be cheep and nasty they have probably helped many more DIY builders get into this great hobby.

Additionally you should all understand that sometimes its better to make something yourself. Even if you could buy something better. And you defenatley learn more, even if it costs you in time.

I think that some of the more senior forum members have to remember that you were all new to this once and is far better for the community to post constructive comments and suggestions rather than instantly shutting people down.

Don’t have a link for them got them from a Friend working in the factory they’re made. 300 yuan before shipping so something like 43 usd

I believe they’re the same ones used in the meepo style airless at boards. Surprisingly great for the price. Hub Fits the 6 inch pneumatics too even got lines to grip it. U need to flip the nut if you’re using normal axles though or use extended ones like on tb218 or ecaliber.

You've been on here longer than me, so you have a better feel for the place, but I mean that DIYeboards is for people who want to buy a kit to "make their own board", while here people are actually bringing parts together from unexpected places (most of the time), innovating, selling parts to each other, and giving each other advice about the nitty gritty details.

Originally this thread had good intentions but now it has been completely ignored and everyone is just going on about being the most expensive gear as it is the best.

Like it’s already been said not everyone can afford the best parts, like myself. Like it has already been said just because you pay half of the price does not always mean half the quality. Personally I aim to buy parts that are still 7/10 but around half the price of the top parts.

This tactic reduces costs greatly, however it is a bad decision to do this for all parts. Quality should not be skipped on parts like your battery and vesc(s). 

Parts that can be skimped on are wheels, mounts (by this I mean making your own, it is much cheaper and customised for your board and likings), motors (Keda are reliable but still cheap, due to having slightly smaller stators), enclosures (either making your own or making an intergrated deck). Money can also be saved on your battery by building it yourself, although you must know how to build the battery safely and with proper tools.

I’d just also like to add that one day I dream of being able to have my own esk8 company and sell great parts to all of you guys, but that is still just a dream

You really are better off getting a fiber glass one from @bigben or similar. The material is inherently stronger and the finish is better. I read your thread and understand you want a budget beast for $700 or so. That just isn't going to happen. the two words of budget and beast just don't fit together I'm afraid.

It is possible to have fun on a $500 Meepo, but real performance comes at a cost, as does durability.

Good luck :+1::+1:

I think so, but it depends if I get some money soon. I think for now it makes sense to go 1wd, as long as I can get the second esc and 6374 from him

Adding the mount, motor, esc, pulleys, etc. for 2wd adds like $350

You can do some builds for cheaper but you have to know when and where you can skimp and where you can.  You could use a ikea drawer organizer for an enclosure and the first rock that hits it or the first time it scraps on a speed bump you will be wishing you had a @psychotiller enclosure.  What I have found is if you have a spar board laying around that is easily 50-100 bucks off your build.  Basically if you are doing a street board budget for at least 1k.  For a eMTB budget for at least 2k

Let me also give my 0.2. I bought an ownboard to test whether I would like esk8ng or not. For starters cheap budget boards are a good buy. But then I realized that it did not have the speed or the distance or the torque I needed. I then proceeded to attempt to upgrade my parts from diyeboard. I'm sure you can guess that was a major disaster. 
Finally I ended up shelling out 1.6K for the parts that I wanted and most of them were bought from members of this community. There are many advantages from buying parts here

1.) These are seasoned guys with their post history for all to see. You can totally verify if a person is legit or not.
2.) The build quality here is amazing. If a vendor here does not meet standards they will loose business here due to bad reviews. This community is super transparent. 
3.) The people are insanely helpful here.

I am a business student as well and one thing you haven't mentioned at all is economies of scale. It is cheaper to mass produce rather than build custom made parts. Large companies are able to do so because they produce FMCG goods that are in high demand. 

This industry is still upcoming and development eventually leads to better pricing for all. You are asking for a Maserati but want to pay the cost of a Honda.

I am buying from members on here. And you're right, economies of scale are important. While I'd rather this thread close because of how it went so far, I can try to rephrase what I meant earlier. You said that I'm asking for a Maserati but wanting to pay the cost of a Honda. I see it like this. I want the qualities of a Maserati (performance, durability, etc.), but with only the budget for a Honda, I decide to change the engine out for a motor if the same cost, the fuel tank for a battery, etc. It's not that the parts themselves are cheaper. It's that they weren't custom built. They were mass produced for cheap for something else that I can adopt into my own purpose. Those Poly cases are meant to house something completely different than Esk8 cases. So since their market is already much more developed than ours, they have increased economy of scale, reducing the cost and price of their parts. Therefore, for someone on a budget, instead of getting a custom part for esk8, one can get a part not meant for esk8 that may accomplish a similar task for less. I hope that clears things up. If you want, you can visit the link I posted recently to see how we solved this awful thread😉
