Done by a Canadian company, Harfang Wheels, based in Montr√©al. They take costumer's wheels and using 4-axis CNC machine they cut rain grooves into them. Surfing thru their website you can take a look at the different type of grooves for different rainy conditions, surface, grip, roads, speed, etc. Their performance goes beyond what is manufactured by normal linear-axis lathes. The list of brand wheels they've already customized is large, ABEC's, Orangatang Kegel's, Seismic, Speed Vent, Cult Psycathane, Cannibal, etc.

Yeap. They also sell their own cut groove line of wheels.

Except for their's, all the above images are customized jobs they've done. You just contact them and ask for the price of customization. Could be as little as your four wheels, as well as hundreds, they will take the order. They will be more than happy to cut the grooves for your precious 107 mm Flywheels. It all depends how much are you willing to pay for such a job and shipment.
