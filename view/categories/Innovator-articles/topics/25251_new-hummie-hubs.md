@Hummie everywhere rumours about your new motors but no thread about it. So here we go :slight_smile:

Do you already have some infos for us? When? How? Pics? Something?:grin:

Hi.  I thought I'd shut up till things came this time and do an uphill video with some hot chicks and great drone video as it's supposed to be done. 

 I sold motors before at steelhubs.com if u don't know.

I'm in need of final bucks to pay for shipping of the main steel motor parts from China (black and raw) so if anyone is interested in getting motors in about 2 weeks I have a couple sets left of this first 10.   They're no longer the kegel 80x56 size with a 25mm motor inside but these abec11 Centrax at 83x78mm with a 52mm motor.
12mm axle hanger. 
375$ if u wind them or 475$ if I wind them for 90kv. 
There's a lot of upgrades with these over the past but I'll tell you about those when things are in hand. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/b/2b14079694fb43196ccf53d62277f0c63577944a.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/3/53ca09922e2ed6668246bc441e531c9e749c87d3.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/d/ad00b8f864c9a205dc138dc955b65402e4b602aa.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/f/5fb4206f8a2163f7530b77dff469cb31321be565.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/9/b9a2cb0bcb3508021b21b86d865a45133a212245.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/d/ad6b2dbf5d15eeb3e43eeb3b7f3ef59a3e8d2803.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/d/bd2a3bbdb504239d5cdbb6e2fb7eb022089b4b1f.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/5/75bf4a1e44a6a6d401e70a1793ed3640c047dde5.jpeg" width="375" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/b/0b0d051a0e248e943dfa51b9e8c67724418d932d.jpeg" width="375" height="500">

Sweet! I will keep an eye on this thread, im new to the forum looking to build my first setup.. and im thinking hummies hubs might be the way to go but im not sure what the KV will transfer into the wheels for top speed/acceleration and wattage output? 

Will probably run 10s or 12s 

Im looking for high top speed potential 30-40kph with good range.. 30+km  if thats not to much to ask for!!

Good to see you back in the Hubmotor game!
Apart from the 12mm axel and wider motors, did you make any other changes to design? Like adding Hallsensors and bigger bearings, improving the mounting mechanism or  the ability to take the Hubs apart a little easier.

```
maybe he didn't want to outsource all of his IP - some people like Jacob have been ripped off by chinese factories that basically steal their IP and sell it as their own products.

By ordering parts from different sources he could have made sure that no single company gets all the IP and therefor can't copy the design that easily. However, wherever the stator is coming from I am pretty sure they would not have gotten much out of the information to also wind it to 90kv, so there might be more to it :D

Winding motors is kinda fun too and gives me control to try different winding patterns and kv. 
Anyone can wind them with a bit of research and I though people might want to try. Scorpion motors sell kits. 
The design is the same as the larger 101mm version so they will have two big bearings and all 1020 steel and it's all a tighter fit o things inside this time and no wasted space and still fit a 52mm stator in. And there's the 12mm axle in the unique effectively 195mm hanger.  The biggest change will be the tire has a polycarbonate core and also polyurethane intended for high heat.  Regular pu deteriorates at about 170 losing its mechanical abilities, getting too soft, and also turning straight up to white powder.  I think every hub out there really needs a core if it's put to a lot of work

The deck I had made and have just a couple to test. It's similar to the landyachtz switchblade 40.  Theyre wood with two layers of carbon and a 3D mill job to keep the hole consistent 13mm throughout the 23x5.5".  Plan to add a compression battery which is in the works and sell compete boards.  I plan to change the outline cut a bit to make it sharper angles in the future

Poorness is here and trying to round up people interested in any of my wares!  I owe the motor place for half the cost of the main parts and shipping. I have 5 sets of motors that will be fininshed any day and shipping from China is super fast. I think 2 sets are still available if anyone is interested. And the deck...150$. 
I could put sensors in but don't want to deal with it for now. Opening them is easier as just locking the bearings on the rotor side so if u remove the threaded ring the motor is easy to get to. You'll still need a big wrench to remove the motor to access the biggest bearing though 

And I have lots of new Paris v2 180 I want to get rid of for cheap. Black gloss  

thanks for your interest and encouragement people!

Glad to hear ur interest. It always takes longer. I've been telling people 2 weeks for months but parts are now here.  2 more weeks till they're done!  Thanks those of u who are waiting patiently.
@Vampiresquid64 it's got lots of rubber on it from pouring pu wheels in the past and other stuff. Too scared I'll break it if I try to remove it

@NAF  I'll do mine in 90kv but could do whatever.  Luke (@evoheyax) put sensors in the old motors within the last couple of days and said they were running 15 degrees cooler on his typical run so I'm thinking maybe it is worth it for the efficiency.

hello thx you first off for making this available to everyone  i am interested in buying two sets of 107mm or better yet 110mm  with the softest available pref. 70a or 75a derometer to match  my abec11 flywheel if limited the softer larger 110mm and is there any way to buy a 2 sets 4 total of 110mm Ralph hubs are there any mods that advanced the durability or performance 

i'm currently making m first prototype a special high stability quad hub motor 110mm drop deck speeder  of a esc type possible pref FOC input sensored 120degr hall sensors     

any way hit me back i say you quote 90 dollars for a set of 110mm ralphy :) :smile hope that means 180$ for 4 total : durometer if options i would go softer but any way i plan to build a 24s3p 300amp 100.8 v bms or equv= FOC VESC and i can talk for days just hit me back

I like the smaller long wheel but will do a 90mmx79 version.  As it is now the motor OD is at 59mm and wheel at 83 so 24mm thick rubber and it's so long it's very smooth and I'm happy but I know people want the bigger wheel and my partner wants to do one too so wont be long

I can very likely have the 90mm done too in 3 weeks.  depending on if...someone buys some motors.  I have not a cent and if someone buys motors, then I have the cents.  I have time galore and more motor parts than have been sold.  If any of you get a set of the new motors at 450$ I'll get the 90mm mold done and send you two sets of those tires and you figure out the other wheels or we could work something else out if you wanted.  

3 weeks I will start getting the motors out.  thanks for those of you who have given me bucks in advance so we can get these ordered and are still waiting for motors.

 if you go to the steelhubs.com site you can see what was sold over the past year and these are the same design as there, that proved rock solid, just with much more power, a bit more rubber at 83 diameter, 12mm custom hanger, bigger bearings, better magnets, and a high temp core for the wheels.  
have to wait till the 15th for the final parts and then I can post pics but these are the real deal and I have a good rep with the old stuff just not the marketing machine hoopla. 

 the best components and all info about them freely given.   I use n48sh.  good to 300f.   can any other hub motor say that?  Are they using regular polyurethane not high heat specific polyurethane?  does the wheel have a high heat core?  is the axle one huge span of just 8mm?   stop...think...look at what's being sold and the ingredients and design and compare  to what's in other motors or other hub motors.  These are the most reliable, most proven, and with the best components.  other companies it seems don't want to tell you what magnets they have and that's really the most important thing!  if you don't know if your magnets and motor will be ruined at 200f ...that can be a big problem.  worth knowing.  Are they made of steel or aluminum.  are they built with small screws holding the motor together?  do they have any history of testing or did they go straight to market for you to be the guinea pig?
these have the best rep of any hub motor out there as far as I can tell and of the 140 I sold anyone who had a problem with the old, of which I can count two people other than my team, who had broken phase wires, I've been happy to get them into new motors that wont have that problem or fix their old.    these have a better rep of durability than a regular motor and I stand behind this stuff.

I totally can vouch for Hummies hubs and Service. He is doing great work and has continually been a leader in the ESK8 community particularly developing Hub motors. The guy is like a freaking mad scientist - he dives into his work and makes rad-ass shit that he backs up. 

He throws down with development even to the detriment of his own bank account and is a legit all around guy.

Someone try these hubs - they/he won't disapppoint. I'm broke at the moment (teacher in summer) but will throw you funds for a second set as soon as I get paid.  Dude bros support cool shit!!! 

Enertion is a marketing beast but they are untested long term with hub shit.

These are built ground up- with ES forum and this forum you can see the development and what bad ass bitches the next iteration will be. 

The reason Hummie isn't marketing is because dude is building and refining- not shooting video and promos or trying to compete with Evolve.

ESK8- 
SUPPORT THIS DUDE.

thank you monkey.  He's had motors for ages.  

I only got 19 of these prototype verson 4 motors and after this we're going to kickstarter and it will be a while till more are gotten.   If you want something rock solid reliable with tons of power and a super smooth ride with lots of good urethane and a decent core and the safety to get up to 300f before you have risk of motor damage..to say nothing of what will happen to your tire...you wont find it anywhere but here.
i'm obviously in full sales mode.   neeeeed to sell one more set to move forward today!   you wont regret it.

if you bought motors from me before I'll get you these new ones for just **400$**

thanks Dexter I'm excited to ride these.  Wonder if you'll come back to sf for some ride of some sort.  there's some enertion thing going to be here this sunday..  if you want tires for those little motors $5.

**EDIT information below is stale. There is a new design, much has changed. Hummie will update in 9/4-9/8 timeframe.**

Hey @Hummie, love what you're doing, but it's hard to follow what's going on. :slight_smile:

Please correct me if I'm wrong. I'll edit the post if forum lets me.

You have a few prototypes of version 4 on hand right now. specs:

* motor:
  - 59mm diameter
  - 52mm stator
  - steel not aluminum
  - high temp magnets
  - high temp motor wire
  - 90kv
  - hand wound by hummie, both prototypes and production
  - production motors should be ready to ship by 8/20/2017
* hangar for motor
  - 12mm axle
  - precision
  - paris baseplate compatible
* wheels for motors
  - 83mm x 81mm, 12mm thick wheel ((83mm-59mm)/2 since these are diameters)
  - similar to ABEC11 Centrax, which are 83x78mm
  - not too tall but wide, which gives plush ride
  - high temp core with high adhesive and mechanical bond to wheel
  - urethane wheel, hopefully soft duros due to core
  - molds and first wheels done by 8/11/2017
* future wheel
  - 90 x 81 for motor (committed?)
  - matching 90 x 81 non-motor wheels for front (not committed)
* a version 4 set includes:
  - 2 motors
  - 2 wheels for motors
  - 2 normal wheels, ABEC11 Centrax 83x78
    - NOTE this may change to custom wheels in future
  - 1 custom hanger 12mm precision
  - 1 stock paris hanger 195
  - 2 stock paris baseplates


Are there any differences between what you have on hand now, and what you'll get on or around the 15th? Price differences?

You're trying to raise funds to get 90mm wheels made for these version 4 motors. If funds raised, you expect to have moulds done in 3 weeks. How long until you have wheels in hand?

And, all times stated are best case. Actual dates are usually later sometimes much later.

Thanks @evoheyax for filling some details.

[/quote]

Front wheels are the ABEC11 Centrax 83x78mm, motor wheels will be 83x81mm. Slightly wider, but not noticeable to the eye. In the future, I think we will be doing our front wheels also, so we can match the back wheels better.

[quote="deucesdown, post:56, topic:25251"]
rubber not urethane?
[/quote]

Motor wheels will be urathene with high heat core. This core design is great and will be impossible to be decored these wheels once poured. Should allow us to use some lower duro stuff. I'm excited to try them out.

[quote="deucesdown, post:56, topic:25251"]
future wheel
90 x 78
[/quote]

90x81 front and motor wheels in the future, since we will need to pour matching front wheels when going up to 90mm. Not an issue now if you run 4wd with them though.

First motors should be ready by the 20th, fixed cans ship the 15th and will arrive within 2 days. Then it's winding, glueing magnets, and an assembly. Molds for the wheels and first wheels should be done this week.

Hey @Hummie I had a few questions.  How is the urethane held onto the hub? Is it fixed on either side of the motor? I ask because I read that the Raptor 2 hubs thane was having issues staying on since it was only attached on the outer side of the hub. I was reading something about a high heat core? Whats the deal with that?

Also are you planning on having the 90mm wheels as an option for the kickstarter? Thanks!

The tires are held on with a flange on both  sides. I'll do a tear down soon to show it all in a couple days. The design has changed. There's no more screw and glue, its got a mechanical lock to hold the motor to the truck now. Use oil and a standard large flat head screw driver to attach and detach from the truck. I'm really happy about this design. It's also a hollow axle now which is 2018 looking and you can stick some dry ice in it for bonus cooling and a vapor trail. 

Someone on the forum, Joe, got me into marinmade.org so I'm doing prototypes in-house and getting design consulting with machinists, designers and engineers all for free!  They help green new tech start ups. I couldn't be happier and were doing the final changes for this design and will make it as soon as we're done I believe


Parts ARE DONE and they say theyll send them from china today.  2 day shipping.

The tire uses a rare high heat resistant pu and a very high heat resistant hard pu core. Give me two or threedays and I'll show u tire and all where I take everything completely apart and then you'll know everything.

@Hummie all that stuff in this [post](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/new-hummie-hubs/25251/56?u=deucesdown) is pretty much history, and no longer in the pipeline? Or is it just the  motor/axle interface and hangar that's redesigned? And motors, wheels are still as described?

And new suppliers, new dates?

I'll edit post or delete based on what you tell me. And if you're trying to keep things on the low low that's cool, I'll delete.

Mostly I'm trying to figure out what you're building, what you're selling, now and in the future, and if I can buy it. :)

 i know things have been lagging for months now but parts are here and i'm getting them together with evohyax now.   Been extra slow cause my real job teaching is back now summer is over.  

 but...but..i have a new even better design being made now too.   doing the hollow axle and has a mechanical  mechanism locking the motor to the axle with a left-hand thread on top of a regular thread, just like a track bike.   this design rocks and all i ever wanted in a hub motor..almost.   the old stuff is a pain to service and more heavy than need be.   wait till you see it...its super slick.    actually will patent it this time. 

any of you who bought the new/old i'll be gettting them out at the end of this week and next.  I'll post up a video likely tonight or tomorrow.

The innovation is getting better and better. We're getting ready to bulk order our first batch with the new design. Will have as many of the pre orders done soon. What we can't fill in pre orders, will get the new design when we get more parts in a month. We should have motors in stock afterwards for a bit at least.

New wheels will be done today. Molds are all made and working well.

Things are coming together, patience is a virtue :slight_smile:

Heres a shot of one of the core ideas and motor fully assembled minus the outside plate:

Trust me, we're going into production mode. We want to get all of the motors we have parts for (which I believe is 18 motors) assembled and shipped.

Might take a week or so though. Wheels, we need to make another mold for. Currently, we can only do one wheel at a time, which means it will take 2 weeks at this rate to do all the wheels we need.

what plastic though?  there's plastic and there's plastic.  smooth-on stuff is pretty crappy compared to others  even their intended "high heat" stuff, task8 is no good.  not tough.  very brittle.  I've been doing testing on different stuff. bjb engineering as well as a couple other companies make specific high heat tough stuff that has no fillers in it such as smoothon uses
sorry been slow lately getting stuff put together.   I've been really busy with my real job and doing the final details with the manufacturer on this improved design.  if you paid for stuff from me...I will get you happy but it will be a biiiit longer.  <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/4/c4b3abd57e52b9260a3bfc5e9f520d66659e0f83.jpg" width="690" height="387">

Getting there!  Nerding out figuring best winding for 90kv, which gets us that 30mph, and finding can get really thick wire w fewer turns, and terminate wye, for heaviest fill and less time taken.  The hold up other than thiss is the hubs the stators go on are all .05mm too big and been sanding like 3 hours each one. No way I'm doing this anymore and will acid etch this down in minutes. Much easier. (I told them too tight to be safer .. For some reason in my mind)

That one with the thick 18awg wire was a test to see how many turns can fit. I got 11 n 12 about every other tooth. Imbalanced and Not a helpful number as I either need 14 turns for 90kv if terminated delta or 8 turns if terminated wye. I've tried many ways with different awg and sometimes parallel strands trying to figure which gets me that 90kv easily and will fit most copper on. Gunna get 17 awg and 17.5 next and that will hit the 8 turn sweet spot.  Initially was going w very thin pliant 22awg double strand because seemed easiest but this is a nice clean heavy stack and can tie one end to the doorknob and pull the stator at the other and very doable and better results. Rather do wye anyway as w delta there's multiple circuits w each phase electrified and if the inductance and resistance arent balanced in the different paths there are voltages between them which counteract productive use
How many volts will it take?...hundreds till the beaeings are beyond their rpm limit so no issue. How many amps will it take?..continuously...no idea but getting resistance numbers lower n lower w the winding progress and that tells the limits and heat produced

I know eSk8 is kind of backed in to the 12s corner atm, but more volts could be the answer to giving hubs more start up torque?
Can't wait to see how this plays out. Your hubs are looking solid. I was thinking the Carvons V3 where looking like the way for this kind of build... but now your motors are so long I don't think they would fit on a V3 style set up :sunglasses:

I think torque isn't such a problem with hubs they just take more amps to get it.  if you up'd the vesc motor amp and battery amp settings you can get lots of torque from little motors but efficiency wont be there.  torque with less heat so can run continuously with high torque is a goal.
   a big motor will have low winding resistance and small with have high winding resistance, if they are both 100kv they will get the same amount of torque per amp but the big motor will be cooler.

Theres basically 4 stages to assembly once a wheel is made and magnets are glued in the can:

- Winding to stator
- Epoxying stator to steel hub
- Dipping windings in motor winding epoxy (special stuff made exactly for this application)
- Final assembly with bearings and retaining fluid and wheel

The two hummie on the truck (one is in the wheel) shown in the picture above are the ones I wound 2 days ago, and we epoxied them to the stator last night. Once hummie figures out the curing temp and time of this winding epoxy, we'll do the 3rd and 4th step pretty quickly.

In the mean time (might be until Monday when we can call them), I'm winding more motors and epoxying them to the steel hubs.

These guys are half the resistance of the old motors. This means they should run much cooler and more efficiently. The stator is double the size, so it will take a much stronger magnetic field to over saturate the stators and make them go nuclear, as the smaller motors did.

Really curious to see how they ride. Should be very soon. 4wd should crush any board with these.

Working on testing and comparing winds. I want to do a 15 turn or 14 turn with 20 awg or maybe 19 awg wire dlrk delta wind. Hummie wants to do an 8 turner with dlrk wye wind and 16 awg wire. I think the 15 turner with 20 awg is good enough, and is what I'm doing for mine. That yields half the resistance of the old motors (which should mean half of the heat) while increasing the copper amount by about 40% and stator size is doubled. The 19 awg will be better, if 15 turns can be fit in. Waiting for 19 awg wire to try though.

Wheels are being made as we speak and waiting for the wheels from abec, which should be coming very soon (ready to be shipped).

We could rush things, and put together a good motor that will work (as I am doing with mine), or take a step back and asses all options so that we can get the best copper fill. We've opted not to rush the process and try our options before committing.

We will climb some stuff with them.

@BigBoyToys These in particular are about 82 kv on the backs, and the fronts are about 85 kv. Not sure the top speed (didn't measure, was more concerned about testing acceleration.

Despite not having put sensors in them yet, they can start from a stand still on a slight hill still. And when I mean start, I don't mean struggle, I mean start from a standstill without sensors with so much power. We're debating at this point if the sensors are worth the extra complication and more breakable parts. At the end of the day, simpler sometimes is better. 

And the sensors would add just a tad bit (like saying you'd take 3.1 seconds for a 0-20 acceleration vs 3.4). Maybe, you'd get 5-10% better acceleration with sensors. But the motors are so powerful as it is, that most won't notice or feel the need (even me, who loves sensors, is content without them here). Nothing like the old motors. Even if you do push too, it's the ever so slightest push. The old ones needed a big push or two. These, even if going 2 rpm, will always find their position and accelerate well without sensors.

Video and photos coming soon... (like, very soon)...

luke's motors were an early winding before we knew what was possible.   these here are 16awg and a hundred grams heavier with lower resistance and seem the best potential.  probably will hit 34mph while his we figured were doing max 27mph. 7 turn terminated ..the better wye way so as no stray voltages between phases as with delta.
the rubber rocks and would love to compare it's rebound to what's out there if only could get a bouncy ball's worth to do the simple comparison.  the sound and feel of them when flicked or dropped screams rebound and I really like how the core is working.   We haven't put many miles on them at all yet but I know from trying to destroy my dud pours that theyre much better than the stuff before.   a bit of the mold line on them with my bad mold that needs to get worn down in the center with these (not in the future design coming) but other than that they rode great.

A little example of what these guys can do. Hard to get video that shows the acceleration accurately though. I have no doubt that in 4wd, these are far more power than the raptor 2, which has a dual drive. With better copper fill, they will only get better. And if you look at my pictures, you'll see a lot of space is still left.

Real talk, I can't deny that his motors are larger, plain and simple. That will mean with 2 motors, he will likely win the race. He chose to go 2 mm short than us on stator length, but somewheres between 5-8mm wider in stator diameter. This means he has more space for copper, which means more torque, plain and simple.

However, like I said in the other thread, we all have our unique selling points. For us, you can request custom kv's if you want a particular top speed, which no one else is offering. We believe we have the best mechanical design, and are the only one's using a 12mm axle. We're also cheaper than our competition. The carvons are using a very similar sized stator to us, so I think those will be the best for us to race in a 2wd setup.

We also have the most thane for any in wheel hub motor. Over 20mm on all sides of the can with an 83mm wheel and even more when we do the 90mm wheels. Not much less than a normal 83mm wheel as is.

The carvons are outside of the wheel, so you have a full wheel, but theres downsides to this approach too.

With the raptor 2 motors, your limited to only 11mm of thane on most of the wheel. But they replace the thane with more motor, so... It's all about trade offs. I believe the raptor 2 motors are more than what most need in terms of power. Heck, I think these new motors are more than most will need in terms of power. It's just, we needed something large enough to not overheat, lol. Since he wanted to seal the motor, he had to make the motor bigger to have the same cooling effect as our motors, which are not sealed. Again, trade offs, that end customers need to decide on.

**I think who has the best is too subjective at this point.** They are all good, you can't go wrong with any of these three options. But we will always strive to be the best. We're not done designing even more power motors either. For those who want even more power, we will bring back the 3x long motors. It will happen in due time, once we get the first 100 batch hopefully sometime early next month. We'll use the little profits we are making to get the 3x long design modified, and into production :)

I did do a test today of hill climbing a 20% grade hill. Speeds were around 25 mph still, and did the test for around 15 minutes straight, up and down, up and down. Probably did 20 laps, and max temp was 151 F in one and 130 ish F in the rest. Not bad at all.

Cores are working well, no deformation so far, and ride quality is far better than the small motors wheels.

Not really sure how things will go. Again I'm riding 4wd, so I will see a decent bit less of heat than a 2wd will.

my kv is low, 80kv, so I can get better torque and efficiency. Turn that into a 105 kv (which is the dream, top speed around 35-40 mph) and we'll see more heat, that's for sure.

But again, so much comes down to rider weight, style, and hills. I know hummie will do fine with 2wd of these. But he's like 130 lb and I'm 200 lb. So takes a lot more amps to push me up a hill. More amps = more heat. I also ride more hilly terrain than him, so even more to him.

Again though, my windings are not a full copper fill, so we will see how a full copper fill performs compares to these also. We expect even less heat.

Either way, we're doing the triple wides again at some point in the future. Those should run even more efficiently again, as bigger stator, and more copper. I think a dual drive triple wide at 105 kv will even be plenty for me...

Until then, these 4wd of the double wide are overkill already :slight_smile:

lol, If your not heavy and not riding in extreme hills, 2 is fine. Wouldn't be selling pairs of two if I didn't think they were the best for most people. But do take all factors into consideration. 4 will always be better than 2, and provide a way better riding experience in general (feels more natural to have torque applied evenly to all four wheels, instead of 2).

Yes, I would recommend 4 motors for your case.

10% grade is not that much, but it also depends for how long. A few 10% grade hills won't do much to the motors, but if thats 50% of your ride, it will impact the motors significantly.

I am 200 lb with a lot of hills, so I use 4 motors.
250 lb+ with moderate to little hills should use 4wd.
Everyone below 200 lb and with moderate hills should be fine with 2wd.

Rider weight does play a huge role.

About 30 mph up hill.  No issues accelerating on the hill. There's 2 more blocks below where I started, so 6 blocks of decent hills, and I did that, up and down, stopping almost completely or completely, up and down. Did that up and down 3 times each way, so 18 blocks up and 18 blocks down 15% grade hills. Even with that, most were 138 ish F and one was 149 F.

Sorry for going so slow...or I should say stalling!  The new design coming has a bit more room for windings.  These that I have new are like surgery getting the amount of wire in I find I can fit. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/5/b/5b706e50746a03547a7026531e8eebebece30bb9.jpg" width="666" height="500">assumed I'd be able to fit what the old manufacturer fit but can fit like 25% more <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/b/3/b31b38900794864fe49bca2b929d1d10be8b2c2a.jpg" width="375" height="500">and doing this acid etching to all of them and then cleaning them up is a pain.  And the new design coming is so much better .  they're sending two Friday to confirm its good then all the rest within three weeks.  +++++I'm off work and will have all the stators and wheels ready so as soon as the parts arrive (3-4 weeks) its pretty quick putting in the magnets and mounting the stators and out the door. Winding and tires are the real slowdown .  I'll post up a pic of the wheels and wound stators and the new motors, which should be here super fast shipping...mid week next week. Ships this Friday.

We are hoping that by this time next month, we are starting to ship out motors to those who have already ordered. A lot hinges on the changes that are going to be on this new motor. The ones we are riding right now are bullet proof in my mind, but if we need to open them, they will be near impossible (or extremely difficult at best), because the ring needs to be glued and the bearings retaining fluid-ed. We also don't have tool for getting them of the truck, haha.

By early December, I hope we have these in stock for a little bit at least. We need to order more once we confirm the design changes are good (and theres only one way to do that, which is riding). I have a feeling maintaining stock is going to be very hard to do.

We will have 50 pairs if there's no errors in assembly made. I believe around 30 of those are already sold. So if you want to jump on board, I would suggest you PM hummie.

We still might do a kickstarter to help raise even more to do bulk buys. That will help us keep them in stock. Right now though, the demand is higher than we can output, haha.

@evoheyax I think i really  want those hubs for a 4WD set up 
But i m concerned by the small size of the wheel. I live in Paris and there’s cobblestone and cracks everywhere. You definitely need like some 90 mm wheel. 
Hummies will be a very long stator and small diameter in order to dissipe heat right ?

Don't worry about wheel size, it's a very easy fix. We are making 90mm and 97mm wheels, and 107mm. For 2wd, you are stuck with 83mm for the time being, because we don't have matching front wheel. But for 4wd, you can select any of these sizes. If hummie tries to tell you 83mm only when you buy them, don't worry. We are making the molds for these larger sizes for 4wd. He's a bit resistant, but if need be, I'll take some charge there, cause I need them personally. Had I had 90mm or 97mm wheels, I might not be laid up in bed right now :(

For 4wd, you can use any of these sizes. if you do want super large like 107mm, you will want a lower kv motor, so let us know. I will talk to john and try to sit down with him and organize the pre-orders. They are all in paypal right now, so we won't miss anyone. But we'll need to go back at some point soon and see what sizes for those who are ordering 4wd you want.

You need a stator large enough to not heat up in the first place. The option is either wide and short or narrow and long. The first option is what most hub motor manufacturers try to do. It results in a thin urethane patch. What we are doing is the second case. By having such a long and narrow motor, we get the power and efficiency needed from a motor, while giving you a lot of space for urethane. Compared to an 83mm abec flywheel, our urethane depth is only 2mm less. So the argument of less urethane is becoming harder to claim here. We have almost the same as a traditional long boarding wheel.

4wd with these run cooler than the raptor 2. I mesured temps of the raptor 2 on Friday at the event. Moja's raptor 2 motors were at 104 F while my motors where at 90 F. Heat in 4wd especially is so far from an issue, that you can forget about it. Even the heat in 2wd I suspect will be minimal in most cases. I still recommend 4wd though, as I find it's more of a predictable acceleration and braking, better traction on sketchy roads, and will reduce wear and tear on the motors for an even longer life. I expect the life of a 2wd though even to be many years.

last many years?  I expect the mechanical parts to last a lifetime at least.  it's like if a car salesman were to tell you that the wheels on your car are warrantied for a year and after that they might fall off.  no way that would be acceptable.  the new design even though hollow, at its thinnest is still the equivalent of a solid 12mm axle, unthreaded, in mass, and this material is put at a larger diameter at 20mm with a 16mm inner diameter.  that's way stronger than even a 12mm solid axle.  these are expected to last a lifetime at least.  and that doesn't mean when they break and you fall off and are dead the warranty is over.  I will give anyone a new set if they break the mechanical parts of these ever.   none ever broke in the past other than an 8mm snapped axle on a freak prototype long version.    not ever again.

@evoheyax I noticed that the wires on your test board is going underneath the hangers. I assume you are doing this because it is easier to route the wires into the board setup that you have. 

Is it possible to route the motor wires above the hangers when using a different deck setup?

12S5P AWD on 16/33 ratio with 107 superflys. Propels a 220 pound man up to 37mph (actually done, not theoretical) while carrying an additional 15-20 pounds of work related crap. board weight: 24 pounds.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BaQT2hrF5QE/?taken-by=longhairedboy 

we may be bumping this guy's board up to an 11 ply deck soon however, i'm seeing signs of wear that concerns me for this particular rider. Also he seems to like to crash into things. That weight class is definitely pushing the upper limit for my typical 9 ply decks at the wheelbase that i used here, which is longer than usual. 

So lets talk about torque on a 5074 stator or whatever it is you've got in there because i'm eagerly watching this and hoping for hubs or direct drives that can actually compete with belt reduction. I'm watching you guys and working with Carvon so i'm obviously not married to belts but so far....

i got one motor to confirm the new design and its all good except one mistake where the bearing housing is too loose for one bearing.   I guess this is to be expected and that's why they only sent me one to confirm things.  They say ten days till the rest are done and they've always been maybe two weeks behind schedule but we will see I guess.

Talking of torque with a 5074 stator....well it's 4752 in these motors so not quite that big.   I think what's really worth comparing is the Km, which is the torque output efficiency.   So a smaller motor with 100kv will put out as much torque per amp as a 100kv big motor, as defined by their kv,  but almost always the bigger motor will be more efficient so it can put out that torque or power for a long time and stay cool, and therefore continue to keep its good efficiency because its cool and get better range.  It will have a better Km.  
I'll post up some pics of the new motor later tonight which show how it's built and that's the advantage of this newer design.
But besides design and back to talking of km effects this new motor is as big a motor as @evoheyax has been using so seemingly similar, but really since we rushed to get his wound the weight of the copper shows he's got 100 grams and after figuring the ideal winding I get 120 grams in, which results in him having greater wire resistance at .06ohms than my .05ohms.  So put an amp through and you can calculate how much will turn to heat.  I have a better Km motor but we have the same kv.

it weighs more now because he has this crazy foam topper on it but yeah. 24 and some decimals before it shipped. 

hubs just move some of the metal from outside to the inside. I'd like to see a weight comparison of hubs vs motors with mounts bolted onto them. 

The fucking raptor 2, a 10S4P with a slim sexy box, weighs just as much as my 12S5P base model scarlets which are rear wheel belt drive at over 3000 watts per motor and are right in the 21-22 pound zone. 

They just keep adding steel into those wheels. Looks lighter, but isn't. They're getting some real power in there finally, but trading lightweight aluminum outside the wheel for heavy ass steel inside the wheel isn't going to reduce weight. I doubt that's really the objective at this point though. Right now they're still just trying to surpass belts in power-to-the-street and flexibility.

also i'd like to point out that batteries, in the grand scope of the entire board's weight, aren't the biggest contributor. Cells don't weigh much.

Here to say thanks and update.   it's been ages and I super appreciate the people here who've helped me with design work and all the people who paid for these and are waiting.  You are more patient than me and not one person has asked for their bucks back.  awesome that you guys allowed this development and it's finally finally done done.  15 days manufacturing time for all of them they say and i'll be on them leading up to that holding them to it.  so should be just before Christmas to me and really with this new design, and the fact I have a million already wound stators, I can pop them out to those of you waiting.  

I kept doing changes for like the last 3 months it seems and finally we're all settled.  the sample they sent wasn't perfect but they assure me the rest will be now that we've gone over every cranny. 

(this isn't the wheel actually and it's a bit longer than this, and this pic doesn't have the bolt-on flange part but it shows more whats going on.)

very happy with this design and think you all will be too.  

and in new awesome news after sending an abec11 to the new rubber place for them to figure out what's in it they're now sending me new rubber with the same rebound as abec11.  75duro.

Basically, the plan and update on how things are looking:

Everything except the bells have been machined. We have ordered the remaining parts we need for these motors and all should be coming in the following weeks. We had a minor setback again with the timeframe we were given, and the new shipping date is the 19th of December. As always, it'll be a mad rush to get the wheel and core molds made. From there, we'll be be assembling the first motors for testing. Make the final decision on what wind will be the standard, and get them going from there. The hope is we will be shipping before the end of the year to those who have ordered, though we can't make any promises about this date. Those who ordered first should be receiving them first.

At this point, we might take a few more pre-orders if we run into a situation where we need more cash, but other wise, we are holding off with more orders until the kickstarter campaign. We are planning on launching a kickstarter campaign by early February. By then, we hope to have every glue we will use, bearings, and standard wind decided, along with as perfect as possible hub motor wheels. The plan is is to get a large bulk order thanks to the kickstarter of motor parts, so we can save some cost of the motors. This will allow us to finally build an inventory of motors so we have them in stock at that point.

We offered a $425 intro price, which for us, is slightly above cost. It was because of the support of those who jumped in early that helped make this motor possible, so thank you for your support and patience. That is the best pricing I think we will ever offer on these motors.

We have slowly ticked up the price as time goes on. This is due to the under pricing of these motors, especially when you factor in US shipping is included in the price. We are barely making a profit, which means we will never get motors in stock, and it will always be a huge pain for our customers who will wait and wait for small batches here and there. The cost of R & D has been well over 25k at this point in just costs, and on top of that, the 1000's of hours we both (but especially hummie) have put into these motors.

We live, eat, and breath for these motors. We're giving them everything we can.

The hope that by the end of kickstarter campaign to have identified any possible flaws in the motor assembly and/or design. Since this is the 4th gen, really 5th gen since the mechanical design changed drastically from the v4's I'm riding right now, we don't expect to need to make many, if any changes at all. So the hope is not to launch a concept motor, but rather a tried, tested, and refined motor with independent reviews from community leaders.

This time line is entirely relying on our machining factory doing the machining correctly. The samples they sent us had many wrong cuts, so it's possible they make a mistake again. We hope this is not the case. If that were to happen, the time line would be pushed back 1 month.

After the kickstarter, we are not entirely sure how we are going to structure the business moving forward. Our focus has been all on designing the best motor possible instead. We are making no sacrifices, and don't want to ship a decent product when we know we could ship something much better.

We will update when more info is available. Thank you everyone for your support.

the bearing that she is banging in is bigger than the motor will be using and I fear if she uses the correct thinner bearing it will be crushed  or too tight as Mr.happy says.  but I'm not sure it will be too tight so asking her to try to press the right bearing in with the big one she showed on top and using a true press and not a hammer.  If she can get the right bearing down there without crushing it then it's good as is and we get things five days sooner!  I have bearings with internal clearance within them for just such a tight fit anyway.  

Id rather it be a press fit actually but it looks way too tight in that video.  We will see.

I don't mean to say that you are doing this wrong, but shouldn't the bearing be inserted using a hydraulic press(or mechanical). That way it gets uniform pressure from all sides. I would suggest a car jack installed in such a way that it can push the bearings in. 

Also you might have to heat the outer one and cool the inner one

A good fit is desirable for long lasting operation

for sure agree with both of you.  ive asked her to try again pressing the 52x40x7 bearing under the monster bearing she's banging in with the hammer.  I have no idea what goes on at that place considering.  maybe its a good test.  for me getting an appropriately sized bearing with what would amount to something like .005mm interference ideally is rare and expensive to find. .  Retaining fluid is often recommended.  But woke up at 5am and told her to NOT cut them all (hopefully!) to the wider 52.00 with tolerance +.02 that was what it was supposed to be.  So I want an interference fit, and I want it on the housing side first and possibly even the shaft with the obstacle then being assembling: pressing the two bearings at the same time, so pressing the stator into the rotor yea I'd like to get some liquid nitrogen and shrink them solid and working that way but given having put together the old the retaining fluid is pretty versatile though and as long as not too hot it lasts.  a squirt on interference fit and the ultimate in smooth silence. but some people ride bare with the tight slide fit even on the aluminum motors and the rattle is pretty minor.  interesting to see no one told me of their aluminum shaft being worn down and I'm still riding the oldest blue goo aluminum just to try to kill them and the shafts haven't shown to wear while riding( I don't open them to look because that design sucks to open and close, more glue and huge effort sometimes.)  I guessed the cheap 6000 aluminum would've worn down but don't know the forces that would be on that 20mm x 7mm aluminum shaft.   Doing 30mph with a 200lbs rider on a mediocre road and than smacking a pot hole or something, can you guess/math the forces or maybe put a sensor on something? 
steel now though buddies and syched.  

(the shafts on the sample were a tight press fit and its a wild ride getting these parts made at a reasonable price even with the supposed to be tolerance of -.02mm .)

it will be close to 2018 new year day I think.  definitely no later than January.  they just are doing the last bell and say it takes an hour to machine each one.  so they say.  they always pull through just slowly.  
give me till a couple days into January and I really think for sure as the latest.  they're on it now they say.  ok they just said about 15 days. I know it seems like that all the time but its out of their mouth and lets see where we are in a week and confirm

but she says she can get me a couple beginning next week probably without any finish. I'll do the "seasoning" thing as I was planning to do before and wrote about.  if that sounds good to you and you don't feel like waiting another week and a bit for them to put a clearcoat pm me and I'll get some more this way.

I sub for the san Francisco school district and do it all from elementary to principal.  I mostly babysit special ed "emotionally disturbed" middle schoolers or work with the high school kids who got kicked out of their regular public school for something and corralled all to one location.

but it's not hard to put a finish on these bare steel parts and don't think I could fuck it up.

 I'm torn between just rubbing on some of this
https://www.brownells.com/gunsmith-tools-supplies/metal-prep-coloring/metal-bluing/paste-cold-bluing-chemicals/oxpho-blue-creme-prod1108.aspx
It doesn't give the awesome blue color of "hot bluing"

 but simple and surely good enough and rather not be heating the steel so much it's hardened.  (edit...don't think the mild steel will harden having so little carbon and the simple hot method is calling to me http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-colour-steel-with-HEAT/ )
  But most likely will be electroplating the parts with copper or tin which I've done before and have a kit made already using a wall phone charger and just vinegar mixed with Epson salts as the electrolyte solution.

 Gold plating wouldn't be much harder and just need to get a copper layer on first for adhesion.
cant fuck it up too much and worst case would sand it down and do something else

Back in the Hummie V1 motor days, I made the first round of hand poured wheels for testing.  I did some translucent green wheels that looked really cool.  My mold was also set up much nicer than the production wheels with the mold split line ending on an edge rather than mid-span on the wheel so I never dealt with flashing.  I'm still running the same urethane and ride about 5-10 miles a week running my dogs for exercise. From what I know of running production wheels with cool graphics and all that, you need to supply many dozens of molds to the casting facility at a big expense. It's cool to see the evolution of Hummie's motors so I here's to a productive 2018!   ![Skateboard|690x495](upload://jCHVvwn94Fc8tPsgghVSDGaIRZc.jpg)![20151207_155302|690x388](upload://e69TkYGF0OOKm3F8Xfqgk2i62TX.jpg)

I don't want to hijack Hummie's thread too much talking about mold making but the original pattern was a 3D Printed piece made on an Objet Polyjet printer which has much better finish quality than a typical FDM style most consumers use for making parts.  The print was sanded, primed, sanded again, and then molded in a high durometer silicone for dimensional stability.  I work in the silicone and urethane casting material business (technical sales, teaching, and make all of our tutorial videos) so I ended up helping on the project when I knew I could prevent mistakes.  Wheels were the EZ part.   Motors, bearings and windings was where Hummie needed to spend his energy fine tuning.

Thank you! Do I have to do silicone mold or I can print it because I don't need good finish surface.

Pylonflyer is the expert and I was just asking him about printing molds not long ago.  He says you can do it but you need to prep the mold really well so it doesn't stick if youre pouring pu, but silicone is pretty cheap and much easier to work with.  Only reason I wanted to do it was for a very thick resin that would need to be sucked into a hard mold.  but maybe there's a filament that would make a nice stick-free soft mold.  I know there's programs that help to design a mold for printing too.  but that's just the info I remember from Troy @Pylonflyer and hopefully he can tell more.

Watch the Drone building video in the playlist to learn about 3D Printed molds.  Yes it's possible, yes it works pretty good, but there are limitations and you need to use lots of mold release or things will stick.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KweiHPE4Ftg&t=108s&list=PL_Aij55CbyPk1Tw3zy8F-SIfRBZNZnnkT&index=3

the main parts came and looking really good and a big relief.  Built one up w the bearings and snapped the c-clip in and it's solid with no play any direction and the parts were cut very nicely.  give me 2 days to get wheels done and i'll put up a bunch of pics.  thanks all of you in this with me for being so patient as this took forever

bear with me people, the axle in the pic above was cut wrong and they didn't do the left-handed thread on the end so I'm doing that myself and bringing it down to 8mm at the end.  did one last night but it will be a couple days we're waiting for new normal left hand coupling nuts to come from McMaster for me to just get going (you'll get the custom capped nut and not my make-do)..   it's all ok and it'll work better actually with more room so nut doesn't possibly get jammed.  
getting the parts ready for the mold now and took a bit longer with getting fits right but almost there. 

 I'm always saying things will be done too early I know but I'll definitely post some decent video tonight showing the state of things and what the little hurdle is.   I'm not discouraged and we're good.  I'll show you tonight.

https://www.mcmaster.com/#order-history/order/5a5dc645fa080b07e06b3fab/=1b5lbk4
just waiting for a couple of these to show, and the dies to match, and will have wheels by then for sure and will be rolling in like 3 or 4 days max.  

the manufacturer made it out like they were done everything and I'm still not sure what the true state of things is with them and last they told me they were waiting on how this parts for 4 motors they sent are.  safer, but these parts are good I told them and I'll get the details on time with them.  patience.  it will be good.  really liking the tight press fittings on 3 of the four bearing placements and the c-clip is huge and snapped in and not a hair of lateral play.  this is what makes hubs awesome: these things are solid connections all round

Any time I need a bearing pressed in that is an interference fit like what I'm seeing either a threaded rod with washers on each end(if there is a hole running through the body) or simply using some jaws with rubber pads.

Otherwise you can hit the big tools like jaw and other such pullers. A hex socket the size of the bearing ring is your friend.

In this case if you could put the bearing in a ziplock baggie(@longhairedboy probably has lots he can lend 😂)

The body can be heated if possible then there's a chance it will just fall on without pressure. If force is used then only on the outer race not the inner race ever or you risk brinnelling

Here's a 11cm bearing, it needs a baggie![IMG_8437|375x500](upload://mvGonX7iX1N1oDnZHPJOTdRwbSv.JPG)

At work when putting bearings into steel or aluminum, we just use a butane torch, give it a minute or two, and the bearing drops right in. Be careful about applying a torch to a bearing though, it'll burn all of the lubrication out, and won't last as long, even if you re-lube it.

At work it sounds like youre burning all the lube out and it wont last long!  but you help me out.     
 

I've got another wheel on the printer and be polishing both up tonight and tomorrow molding will be going on.   The core print took many shots to get it as tight as possible.
Interference fit for the stator on the hub too which I also really like. 

a screw up was that this truck hanger, which I got 200 of, and it was supposed to be a left hand thread at the end and it wasn't.   Luckily it's an easy solve and I've found I can just use a hand die to cut from the 10mm axle straight down to a left handed 8.  I've ordered the new matching nuts and they assure me 10 days and will be done  and sent with the  main parts.  I will haunt them and count days for them.   9 more
 i![thumbnail|375x500](upload://v3ZmlCZyZUIiXpIkEZC5K0W4cDM.jpg)

 you can take the c-clip off the back of the motor and get out the small bearing and for the big bearing you have to also unscrew the motor off the axle.  it'll be a long time till they need to be replaced being huge, sealed, and with high-temp resistant grease.

Hehe they're now broken in! ;)

I'd say, if they make some noise but roll good under load, and don't get hot, no worries. If they get hot, no bueno.

Sometimes bearings can feel weird with no load, but once you get weight on them they're fine.

Hm but these are R2 hubs, right? They get hot on their own under normal operation? So it'll be difficult to see if the bearings are heating up?

Couple Things

thing 1. - Shipping mass trans atlantic is ludicrously expensive
thing 2 - Import taxes (unless hummie is willing to falsify value) are stupid pricey
thing 3 - Hummie currently only has the limited numbers from his initial order

thing 4 - i will do a final ultimate/grade final gb for EU whenever hummie does have stock to move because 
          a) i dig what he is selling
           b) i like to help good people (hummie is/has been a righteous dude to deal with)
            c) I can help him and those wanting his wears,  out by avoiding thing 1+2

thing 5 - I just decided to offer this and will only proceed with hummies blessing/ after he has the merch and I find a group looking to purchase EU side. If this happens I will create a thread per usual with my GBs. If this happens twil be a limited group, as i carry the goods in checked bags while I fly and there are bagage restrictions

Also, some background - I have been throwing money at Hummies projects since 2015ish and will have one of these first  beauties in Spain as soon as available 
I  have sold/use the original hummies hubs wish are generally awesome

That would be great and shipping to EU is insane as you say!  I always wrote the value of the motors on the package as whatever the person that bought them wanted me to write and some people told me to write the correct value as they say there's a big risk of the parts being held up for a very long time in some countries.  I just got the main motor parts shipped from China for 100 motors and each one was valued at 2$.

But I don't have the parts to build 100 motors in fact I don't have the parts to build even one yet of this new design and waiting for the two last parts to be shipped within the next two days. 

Give it another week and then I'm sure to have some motors out the door and then lets figure it out.

I'd be careful man, bearings can seize and cause a lot of damage by stressing the entire system out. It's better to just replace the bearing than ride on rusted bearings and risk breaking the motor or other components.

I just made a guide today. Not a video but a step by step. I actually found a back-door way to do it which is much easier and requires basic tools with expection of a circlip remover (but you can use two screw drivers or get crafty) 

The bearing you need is a 6810-2rz (from memory) 

I used the 2rs (rubber seal) as an experiment to see if it seals better. There is more resistance but it makes a better seal.

I’ll be posting the guide on the forum and the FAQ on Enertions site. I’ll update with links tomorrow for y’all

IIRC from longboarding in general, about 75a was the softest that could be tolerated. Chunking, tearing, falling apart, etc. And reflex (high rebound) can be run about 3 points harder and still feel the same or better as nonreflex. And reflex has more tendancy to chunk.

update on why I'm not riding yet or working on your motors: 
 the big drum wrench is here and I'm cooking wheels now but also waiting for a lathe belt since I broke it at the local anarchist run workshop and need it to cut down a steel cylinder I have waiting to press the stators on.  Belt is said to be here Tuesday


https://www.grizzly.com/order/opdetail/dmNQWisvbVl3ZmxhY1ZuUzZBamx3VjBaTjVCaG13WjhTa3FHSjVIc3NwTUZJMEhWekZBOWNZcjdIQ3M4S1lmRA2

mechanically the motors are all good just cant press the stators on without a custom cut thin steel cylinder to get by the windings and the center hub.

haha.  

for starters you should all know that everytime something ends up working out I'm relieved and this is largely new to me in many ways!  but things are working out and parts are fitting together and all hurdles are being conquered.  
I'll need to get new rubber materials and magnets and thin winding epoxy to make all the motors that people paid for (i think 25 people) but otherwise I have everything, and those things are not hard to come by and at worst the magnets take a month since theyre custom made.   But I do have ALL the materials to get at least 10 motors going as soon as the tool shows Tuesday.   What will need to happen is I get these first ones out to whoever ordered first and then shouldn't have trouble raising the bucks for the last magnets and order them immediately.  ..  ..  I think my word as it relates to a timeline on these is mud by now but I think will have all the orders sent by 2 months at latest.

75 duro and 75% rebound stuff (was wrong about the duro and it's 75),  but ive got a slew of other kinds to try all the way up to an 85 duro without as nice rebound but intended for high heat.  try that last.  but cant test till Tuesday or Wednesday.

off work today n yesterday cut steel tube down on a lathe so can press stators on with it.  I'll post up some video tonight or tomorrow at the latest of motors running.  the wheels I ran out of the core resin and opted for a slower curing curative to give more time to get the carbon into it and that resin should be here tomorrow at latest they say.
 I know a lot of talk and no video or pics from me but give me a bit more time and once ive got two done the rest are just the follow through with the process really.  a lot of stuff went into doing this as apposed to the past where the motors were made for me and the wheels were not nearly as complex to make.   you'll see soon!   tonight I look forward to pressing it all together...it'll be good.

 cant figure the best way to attach the motor leads.   it has to be done really well with the magnet wires to motor lead junction needing to be really thin and in the right spot if done in the motor.  
lately its seeming much easier to accomplish this by having the magnet wire stick out of the motor and do the connection outside.  I have a 3d printer and am trying to come up with a protector that can hold the magnet wire in the center of the holes coming out and then I can solder and shrink wrap the leads there.  there's very little room in the motor and none for a bulky twisting silicone lead

well someone should rush me then.  all the parts are here and the bottleneck is me.  i'm kinda obsessive on design and details to the point things can get stalled.  
I'll simplify the holdup.  the motor is still very densely packed and no room for soldered on phase wires to lay and all the magnet wire is butted right up to the motor wall.  I wanted it that way to transfer the heat direct from windings to low carbon steel, the only obstacle is the magnet wire connections to phase wires really have to be out of the motor as what happens is when I solder them on in advance and then when I press the stator on the slightest turn in the silicone phase wires ends up a kink and the stator is blocked from being pushed all the way.    so the magnet wires will be coming out of the motor, there will be high temp plastic straws around them as they come out, and the soldered connection will happen there.  
so thinking out loud.  it's weird but in the past the one way motors ever broke was the phase wires would wear even through the 3 layers of heatshrink and short through the hub with the holes in it.  and once that happens you could rewind it but a huge pain.  at least easier with this design and anyone can take the motors off with an allen wrench and open them with a 20$ c-clip tool.  but the point is its crucial it's done right.  I imagine the large majority of all our motors that stop working, hub or not, are having problems with these wires shorting or breaking from their soldered magnet wire connection.  a hub motor even more so needs protection.

I ramble on but it's productive putting things into words and i'm sure there are many of you who are ready to come to my address written above!

the communication here is productive for me.  
![mold feb24|690x395](upload://2D1eYULVtWZYLwVg7ck0spmxDBp.JPG) here's the plan:
these are on the printer now.  Once they show a good fit between the holes on the hub of the motor and the magnet wires will make molds and pour them in a rare thermally conductive silicone I got a sample of!  so the (3) 17awg single-strand magnet wires are coming out of the motor sheathed in this for I think 5mm and then it will be bare and can solder (skewer) the multi-strand wire and heat shrink there.

theres like 25 people I owe in total.  I was roped into work for two weeks sub teaching but might bail on them and just do motors. I would rather be doing these than sub teaching with these particular brats especially. I will be taking off and doing this solely for a week at least.  it seems like I'm kinda doing nothing but really figuring how the doing will happen first
 last night pressed the motor on and it was another repeat of this crazy squeeze job.  I even have to put the wye bundle on the other side of the stator to fit and that's assuming the best everything else goes where it's supposed to.  even my tool for winding has a scoop to hold the wires as close as possible one strand deep.  this is a much better way out of the motor I think.

We want some solid connections where if something were to disconnect it will be fixable and this way, you'll see tomorrow, does that.   also these stators are pressed on not glued so worst case scenario you could press it off to rewind.  but we want none of that.  reliability.  trust me when I say I want the best and no corners were cut here.  tomorrow.  for sure.  decisions decided but we will hear your feedback on things and then go with it and can kick them out quickly.

had repeated shortings with the final pressing of the stator on the hub!  ok.  ok.  adjusting the plug design I use to wind to get the magnet wire transits between teeth more out of the way.   they've been getting crushed against a small lip on the hub pretty sure.  printing it out, wind up another, solder the wye bundle, and press it on again, then check the inductance to make sure its all good, ..then its good and can suck the resin in the windings to fix them solid and then bearings and rotor and c-clip on then screwed to the hanger and then the big nut and good.  you'll see.  tonight.  tonight.  ![stator hole v5|690x495](upload://idhoXSdvXSD7DGecNzXwKqameR6.JPG)![IMG_1604|375x500](upload://zuGiDmcbltoxKwydRJQLfOYF1Ec.jpg)

bailed on work this week and maybe even next.  all I need is to connect some focboxes and will have video up of these first two spinning. 
Over the last couple of days my arbor press has shorted 6 motors when I press the stators on but have figured how to get things wound right now with all the transits between teeth out of the way and nothing gets crushed when the motor pressed together.  very syched for today.  just need to get plugs on and connected and this pair spinning.  from here on out building the motors seems figured and I'm a winding magnet gluing machine.  got it down.  I'll post up video tonight for sure. haha.

 I will bail on work for the next week and a half and at least get the first 10 or 15 out depending on how many magnets I have.  I'll order more as soon as these 3 motors I'll have are spinning and I can compare how the 10mm magnets vs the 9.  kv and noise really.     then order the magnets and they come in max a month and then I can not work for another week or two and get things done.  coming back from work at the end of the day I don't have as much energy and being a sub I can take off whenever.

whats the plan with your picture?  the magnets don't have any glue on them as it is.  what glue you going to use? how did you come to choose the two magnets for each pole? or more so how did you chose the magnets width?

luckily with the bigger magnets I can stick in a 1.3mm shim between each magnet and with the glue under it it slides up to its neighbor.  equal distance from each other, pressing the last one in, and also straight, where I think a lot of motors will use just one guide on one side, including myself with 9mm magnets, and they skew.  your thing looks good in that regard.  so maybe never make that thing and stick with abs toothpicks.  making a guide on the single end with abs I did for smaller magnets and isn't so good and has to be cut out after warping from baking the glue.

The magnets in the picture are already glued in place with Loctite 648. It’s quite easy to glue them in with that stuff as it is very liquid and doesn’t set unless it is squished between two metal pieces. Also it is rated for +180°C. 
I choose the size of the magnets mainly because I could get them the cheapest as N45SH. Custom made ones didn’t make sense for that small batch as I’d have to upfront a lot and wait until they manufactured them. The smaller magnets also give a more consistent airgap in theory. 
The magnetic field seems to be relatively laminar for the first 1mm as well, but let’s see once they run.

Are your magnets curved or flat?  Also, is each pole a single, wide magnet, or two thinner magnets glued/connected to one another to make it the width of what a single wide magnet would be?

I can see on the pic directly above it's four magnets, two wide, and two in length. Would it be better to just have one CURVED magnet that fits the dimensions of the four? 

Also I know we discussed this in PM, but if requested, could one order one of your sets with magnetic silver wire for the stator windings...? Of course for an extra charge.

maybe youre reading what is copper wire with a microscopic silver coating like they do for gold with bullet connectors.  link me a silver wire place if you find one.  
but those benefits of 30% are bunk.  the real value is I think 5% greater conductance or 5% less resistance, whatever way you want to say it.   it's something but ...if you find me a wire place...or I'll show you the one I will find and it's not cheap and somewhere in Europe.
curved magnets and getting a close airgap are worth doing.   get as much magnetic field build up as you can so that you can then wind with the thickest wire you can and have lowest resistance there..almost all our losses and heat are from the current in the wire.   so silver wire I like

An experiment would be cool, I'd love to see a side by side real world comparison. I think it's hard to predict whether the benefits would be worth the extra cost since it's quite a lot of wire. IMO it's worth a try at least as a one off since heat build up is one of the last major disadvantages facing hubs, but I think I might feel differently if I was the one buying all the wire haha

The density of silver is higher than copper too, so the windings would be heavier, but I doubt that would have much impact really. There's a lot of variables

i'll write and see how much it is for like 30 feet (two motors worth) of 17 awg silver wire.  especially with a hub motor its almost all copper losses (silver losses!) and at full speed of just over 30mph the iron losses are only about two amps or 20 watts.   
with I squared R..lets say a single motor gets 25 amps at full tilt and resistant of .057 miliohms with copper wire...im awful at math but get  37 watts while with silver at maybe resistance of .052 that's about 32 watts lost and turned to heat.   maybe that's not right.  and beyond that the heat would be staying lower with the silver and further reducing the resistance in the wire because of that, and it's got that better thermal conductance helping with that.  i'd like to compare it.  it would be very fair comparision as I can fix every other variable.

and I want a set too.

relevant is the comparison of the 9 and 10mm magnets I did on the bldc tool.   f at full speed of 82000 erpm with the 10mm magnets at about 15.3 volts theres 20 watts needed, and that would be core losses, largely the huge grease filled and sealed bearings that are new but the rest being switching losses from magnetic stray losses and not an ideal coupling of magnetism,.. but the 9mm magnets hit maybe 25 watts when going full speed, so more core losses there, another couple watts, yet same stator and bearings, so they seem not as good in the core losses department, but that is at a full speed of 8000 erpm so they have VERY IRRONICALLY a lower kv.  very strange with the smaller magnets doing that and must be the shape of the bell or something, will be testing other ones today, so lower kv is higher kt and they get more torque per amp, so if I were to bring the kv back up to what the 10mm magnets produce, I could omit one turn of wire, so the wire could be thicker, and have less electrical resistance for the same kv slash kt and have lower copper losses which are a greater loss in this slow turning and low core loss motor (I think the percent of the iron losses that are true eddy current or switching losses, magnetic, is really small and it's misleading the results I get with these bearings...the number dropped after 5 min of full throttle down 5 watts in both tests as the bearings loosen up.)  its really a toss up and theyre both pretty close but rather do the 9mm

everyone asks that but its hard to answer because the question is vague.  for peak wattage it would be what torque can be produced just before stator magnetic saturation and also at top speed multiplied.  I don't know but considering what the little motors were capable of these will no longer crush Boosted but you wont even see Boosted boards anymore.   The continuous power rating is also hard to say definitively since what is "continuous"?  20 minutes or an hour.  I will do continuous output testing and see what power output is sustainable for 30 minutes and be under 150f at the end of that.  seems a reasonable and very very conservative continuous rating since I know of at least one person who would cook the old motors to 260f daily putting out huge power and also because the magnets are n48sh and good to 300f before they lose magnetic strength permanently.  a long answer but unavoidable.  and going over 140f is considered poor form as the resistance will increase and more inefficient.  
since no one has come up with a standardized test for "continuous power output"  i'll do that.   
peak power would maybe better be decided based on math and the amount of steel in the stator maybe as it would be the limit...once you put in more amps than will bring the steel over around 1.7 tesla magnetic field strength the ratio of amps to torque is no longer linear and it turns really inefficient. be hard to do a realworld test as the electrical power the vesc shows wouldn't be making it to the road once it gets to that point.  

I'm skipping work these days up at 11 to stay up till 1am and on the job.  motors are decided and proven and we're gunna kick out a bunch today.  the wheels are in the works and undecided but materials to work with galore aind in the oven now trying different stuff.  fit is good just getting the details on how to pour bubble-free.  ramble ramble.

I talked to a place that has the 17 awg in silver with the only choice being a 240c resistant enamel.  very high temp but really the cost isn't there and its the silver, and its the only enamel choice with what's already available or else you have to get like 1000 ft.  I can get small quantities for a few motors but adding up at 18$ a foot and its 42ft of wire needed for all three phases of a single motor...that's about 750$ for just the wire for one motor!  damn.  would be nice but I'm not doing it for myself at that cost.  if it were half that maybe, a third that for sure.![Capture|690x368](upload://xxgt3BWj9aPhctVgwJ0OSegIaGb.JPG)

Hey I just had a thought about something that would look great with your hubs!  On your hub motors, you have in the outer side a purple plate to cover the motor, and it looks great, but then if it's just a 2WD, the front wheels don't match.  So perhaps it would be possible to offer a set of cover plates that can be mounted on the front wheels so all the wheels match?!  I think that would look fantastic, and would definitely order a set if they were offered.

Just wanted to update everyone. We are ramping up production. The first motors were spun a few days ago, hummies been winding like crazy, and a small batch of bells was done a few days ago also. We are waiting for some more magnets to finish the bells off, but I can glue a bell in about 30 minutes. The limiting factor is the winding, as it's hard on the hands and takes about an hour each to wind. But hummie is working hard knocking them out. Should have the first batch of 4 running by tomorrow, and probably a few more also.

If all goes well, we should be shipping by mid April. Still putting together wheels so we want to do about a month of wheel testing before we ship, even though we'll have motors ready for shipping with in the next 2 weeks.

Thank you everyone for your patience. We really wanted to make sure we get everything as good as possible now, so we can ship a highly refined product instead of a beta product. We've tested different winds and different magnets to find the best combo and we have all of the details optimized now and the assembly process as been refined, so it's just assembly now. Will post more photos soon!

I've seen silver wire for a lot cheaper too, AliExpress could bring the raw wire down to about those levels and even if the purity is off 1% it would matter little, the gains appear real, would be a great option.

What type of stainless is used for the bells? Wondering if there is material advantages there in terms of weight and heat transfer?

It would be cool to see what an elite hub motor design could bring against the D/D and belt systems, maybe a mistake on my part of understanding a brushless motor but the core and bell do not necessarily need to be made of metals with a magnetic property, titanium? Chrome-moly etc

Honestly, I don't think more cooling is really needed. Will do more tests, but I feel comfortable rating these at 1500 watts con, and 2500 watts burst without heat issues.

I was doing 1500 con in the one video I posted a while back on that long 6 block fairly steep hill, that I did 3 times back to back with no breaks. Just up and down as fast as possible (still did over 25 mph up that steep hill). The old motors would have been over 250 F by then. On the first go, they got up to 145 F, second 150 F, and third go, still 150 F. Everything in these motors are rated to 300 F or higher besides the bearings. But opening these motors are so easy now that you need a few basic, cheap tools now to replace the big bearing, some of which any DIYer would have. These are no doubt the easiest hub motors on the market to service. Theres really no wasting any parts anymore. They can be 100% fixed if you manage to some how break them, haha.

Bear in mind, this was my wind, which had a .060 resistance. Hummies wind, which is these, have a .030 resistance, which simply means way less heat. This also has about 30% more copper than my wind (by weight), so these are going to stay cool under pretty much every circumstance.

This is meant to be an elite design already. We will continue to improve where we can over the coming years. But these motors already have so much attention to detail already. All of the other hubs I've seen have thin bells. You want more metal rather then less behind the magnets. These guys are heavy, fully assembled, about 5 lb per motor before trucks. But they are robust, durable, easily serviceable, and very powerful motors that are designed, hand wound, and assembled in San Francisco with a lot of attention to detail.

The last piece of the puzzle is the core/wheel right now, which we feel confident will be solved in the coming days. We have everything we need to make them happen, just getting these darn cans open is not easy, haha. In the mean time, more motors are coming together.

More magnets have been shipped, about 2 weeks out. In the mean time, winding and pressing! I can knock the all of bells out in about a week once the magnets arrive. The winding and pressing should be almost done by then!

I agree that these hubs don't have a heat problem, but regardless, the lower you can keep the heat, the better they will perform.  Additionally, and I don't know how this will effect things, but silver is more conductive I believe, so the electrical pulses going to each phase is done so quicker... Don't quote me on that exactly, but it's something to that effect.

As is that's true, an adapter is needed to get the truck degree back to a flat plane, ok that will raise the height a little but given the lacroix board was designed for 8" wheels it's not a biggie, I like the ones @Sender posted.

Oh and if you see the lacroix board being pumped in their vid you can see how it can probably touch down in the middle scraping that beautiful Carbon layer nooooo!

Any current generated which doesn't end up as heat ends up as power. It's ok with me but want 2wd and 97mm+, 4wd is just too much on battery even a big battery for not too much gain. I woulda liked 107mm but understand that it won't happen realistically on a 2wd

Oh well that makes sense.  I originally planned a 4WD Carvon build, cause that would add another 10mph, but I don't need to go 50mph, I would be happy with around 35mph to speed.  Of course that's not my primary concern, I want very strong torque.  You don't think there would be a big difference in torque with these hubs in 4WD as opposed to 2WD?

4wd is a huge torque gainer.

But you need a higher discharge system to take full advantage, at least 120 amp con.

I love when I hear the claims of "these motors can do 25% grade hills!!!!", and forget to say at 5 mph or less. In 4wd with these motors, 25 mph on 25% hills are doable with a high enough amp system. Your electronics will run into issues way before the motors do, lol.

Yes, we are not in a position to even think about doing our own front wheels, haha. Too much on the plate already. In the future, we will though. So if you wanted to upgrade at a later date when we do have a front wheel, it wouldn't be an issue!

We are starting still with 83mm. 90mm, 97mm, and 107mm options should be available at some point in the near future, for both back and front. But much sooner for motor wheels, so 4wd would be able to use bigger wheels much sooner.

For 4wd, you can get 97mm.

For the wind, we have a 100kv wind.

When I say 82kv 83mm wheels first, I mean just that. First, but you will get your 100kv wind and 97mm wheels. We are doing 83mm first, make sure everything is good with that, and move on to other winds and wheel sizes :wink:

With 12s, our calculations show a top speed above 30 mph with 2wd at 82 kv.
With 10s, it shows a top speed of 24 mph with 2wd and 82 kv.

For 4wd at 12s, 78kv should yield 35 mph top speed.

These motors are very powerful, so it's really a question of how much juice you push into them. If you push enough juice, you'll get much closer to the no load speed. The numbers above are lower than that calculator also, so we'll see what real world numbers we get soon!

these are 2.5 pounds a motor. 

the 1020 steel is good for being both strong, not brittle, and as in ideal magnetically reflective flux ring behind the magnets holding more of their field.  it is also a "magnetically soft" material and easily flips polarity as well, reducing iron losses. almost all the motor is 1020 steel.    which brings up ..i'll post another thread and want to know what you guys get for the no-load current draw on the real time data on the vesc.  

the ones ive been winding lately are all 75kv and with estimates based on the 83 wheel will just hit 30mph.  with two wheels.  4 motors with these should be so powerful as to pretty much hit the no-load speed at 35 on flat ground with a typical rider.  I can also do a 7 turner motor instead of the 9 with the 75kv and its the same copper content so just as good a motor but will be a hair less efficient at low speed but hit..guessing 36mph no problem.  soon see and the real world beats estimates.
  but the resistance numbers are often confused as people will state one or two phases.  for two phases I hit .057 ohms on the foc test.  

silver wire would be awesome but while the market cost of pure silver may be somewhere the cost of the enameled stuff is way higher.  by my estimates at a total of..about 45 feet of wire for the motor it's around 750$.  But if you find it cheaper or figure how to make it I'll put it in.

bumping the voltage past 12s is considered risky.  even 12s is considered risky but on a hub motor with therefore a low erpm it's safer.  never had a problem with 12s

stators are 4752  so 47 diameter and 52 long.    .2mm electrical steel laminates.
n48sh curved magnets.  .4mm airgap.  one day will figure out the motor Kt.  the number that allows all motors to be compared (torque to heat)

8300 erpm / 7 = 1185 rpm / 15.2v tester battery = 77.9 kv. This is 95% no load speed. So add 5% more, so 8300 x 0.05 = 415. so 8300 + 415 = a real no load speed of 8715 erpm. 8715 / 7 = 1245 rpm. 1245 / 15.2 = 81.9 kv, basically, 82 kv...

That's why if you lower the Kv, the torque for unit of current increases

In the new motors there’s very little space for sensors.  It could be done and has been but doesn’t seem worth it.

no.  I don’t want to do it because with the vesc and foc and high motor amps I can start from practically a standstill.   seems another thing to break and more wires to deal with.

Hummie have you considered ever doing a Kickstarter campaign?  All the boards that they have on there always have the same crappy hub motors.  You seem to have nearly perfected them, I bet if you were too do a board similar to the CF one your also working on, but make a complete board along with your hubs and a proper esc, you would have a hugely successful campaign...  Like by far, at least that's what I think.  The Raptor 2 hubs aren't even close to how good your hubs are..

@Mobutusan yea that's how its gotten by us and the numbers are right as luke posted them.   but it can be misleading because depending how big the motor is it could run at anywhere from maybe 70 percent to 90 percent of the no-load speed..

I've been looking at the size of stators for different motors and they are usually 10mm less diameter than the entire motor and the length is typically half of what the motor length is, so a 4752 stator is like a 57104!  My God these have to be so insanely powerful!  A 6384 motor is like 4000W, this has to be probably even higher!  Damn, if you were to set these up like Carvon's they would go like 60mph, lol!  Ok I'm definitely canceling my Carvon order for these now.  That's a no brained, these are like the Ferrari of motors, hand built by a master craftsman with the best materials, rather than a modified Turnigy motor, lol!

the windings are only 9 turns with the wye and the other motor being only 7 turns, so lining it all up is just done visually.  it has to be lined up or doesn't fit! 
some motor manufacturers like scorpion label the motor by the stator size so a 53xx scorpion motor will really be a 63 outer diameter.  wish they all did it by stator size.

in my research you wont get any more power or torque for one vs the other.  you may have more teeth but theyre smaller so it balances out as far as torque and power.   more teeth does create less cogging though when rolling unpowered which is nice but once powered not any different.   Maybe it would have better control at the lowest speeds but I find no problem rolling unsensored at like 1.5mph and no cogging.   A downside of many teeth is they are now physically weaker obviously, but maybe that's not an issue,  so the only downside would be the increased erpm at a certain speed so more iron losses.  if you spin your motor on the bldc tool and spin it full speed and look at the current draw it will reveal all the core losses.  those are there based on speed alone so the more switching and more erpm more losses.   I'm not saying more teeth is worse though and have thought about getting a stator made that would have more teeth.  
I think this wire is 1.2mm.  it's 17awg or 16awg at like 1.4mm I guess

If you look at the scorpion catalog as a reference:

1. All their helicopter motors have 10 poles and 12 stator arms. They market them as having the highest power to weight. They generally all use a wye wind and claim 89% efficiency. 16s max. Higher kv.

2. The airplane motors have 14 poles and 12 stator arms. They are marketed as having the highest efficiency (94%). They generally all use a delta wind. 12s max. Lower kv.

The helicopter motors wound with 1 piece of 1.4mm copper 6T+5T YY are rated for 14s 110a/5400w cont. 200a/9600w burst (2 sec). All there 1.2mm wound motors are rated to 12s...

Even with only a pair I think your battery is going to be the limiting factor in most situations running such beefy motors. More so with 4wd.

I think if you want better start up upping the voltage would be the way to go, although that is not practical with the current control equipment.

Oh, my bad.  I would be skeptical about that setup.  I don't even know the ratio, but let's say that is like a 30:1 ratio.  Now needing a lower kv for increased torque here makes sense, however, the lower the kv, the slower the motor...  So in my opinion, with the huge ratio between to two wheels, along with a low kv motor running that, I would be amazed if that setup would go even 10mph.  I may be wrong, I a bit newer to this, but that seems like the main problems with that setup...  I would personals recommend getting like a 8072 sized motor and hooking it up to the rear wheel.  You'll definitely get some good performance there.

looks like a lot of work in that you'd have to make a mount for the bike.  and then a friction drive is not so nice to me being inefficient I think.   making a mount using these motors would be work and time when you could get a motor designed for it with a mounting bracket or a bike hub motor sounds ideal to me.    but my dad is always asking me why I don't make such a thing.   not interested in doing it but if you are I'd like to see it and can help with the design

Someone already tried that here somewhere an failed because of not enough friction. The motor is slipping all the time. You need a strong mount with some pressure for that.

A better design in my oponion is something like that:

Forget friction drives.

The reduction can be solved, but you will never get around the fact that you loose up to 40% of the power (by some estimates I saw who knows how long ago) in the friction itself. Its just bad.

Edit: you also kind of need to redesign the outrunner construction in order for it to be able to support the huge load required for slip-free operation. Most outrunners are really not tolerant of any side loads to the bell.

We will be selling them for at least $600 when we have inventory. The pre-order pricing has gone from $400 over a year ago to $500 now and will keep going up as we get closer to inventory. Not sure if we are going to keep pre selling or not. If we run into a situation where we need immediate bucks for something, then we will pre sell another pair or 2. The next chance to purchase will likely be a kick starter campaign. These motors are worth at least $700 with the matching front wheels and trucks. All of the custom designs, hand wound to perfection, the attention to detail and the amount of testing that has been done to get to this point can't be matched by any other hub motor manufacturer. So we'll see where the final price sits when we can work out the exact costs for us.

I personally expect us to ship most, if not all, pre orders by the end of April, realistically speaking. Magnets and motor winding epoxy are 2 weeks out, But I could knock out magnets in bells in a week for all of the motors. By then, we should have most, if not all, motors wound and pressed, which is the most time consuming and risky part of the motor assembly. We can dip all of the motors within a few days, and final assembly takes only about 5 minutes.

The biggest factor in the shipping time in my mind is getting the core and wheels right. That could delay things still, but hopefully, we have some wheels to test by this weekend. Hummie was pouring cores all night last night. But for sure with in the next month, we'll have all pre-order motors assembled.

This latest design has not been thoroughly tested. But the changes from the last design, which I’ve been riding for the past 6 months, are minimal. They are the ones I used to race Derek on his 4wd beast and mojo on the raptor 2.

This isn’t our first motor, we’ve learned from every motor we’ve assembled and designed. The structural integrity of the design was simulated.

We will know soon 100%, but everything was designed to be overkill. Machanically, we can’t see any possibilities of failure. And electrically, we solved the only other issue besides heat, which is phase wire leads breaking. And the heat was solved also. There’s not much uncertainty in my mind.

I am familiar with it. I wanted to make one of my own. But then i decided to go with an eboard instead. 

And the kepler drive while small and simple does not adress any of the issues i mentioned. It's still using friction (plus even only a small lever multiplies your hand force, so ...not so great for high power) and it is just mashing that bldc on its side, loading the bell in the least favourable way.

the new 75 duro 75 rebound stuff is crystal clear which is nice and been just doing a dyed core and leaving it clear.   

retardedly I let someone help me get parts out of the mold and poof within 10 seconds he grabbed the mold and twisted it till it broke and then he hands it to me like its done!   so almost done the new mold now.    I know it's been forever but I have a bet going that wheels done this weekend and I get a beer so.    that's not the only motivator.

I know we're talkin about 83mm front and rear, since this thread is so humongo can we get an itemised list of what comes on the package? Afaik

83mm motor hubs + hanger
83mm front wheels

My understanding is that the hanger is compatible with a Paris baseplate.
Does this give the only real option of using Paris trucks or for instance would it be possible to use Ronins/Surfrodz?

Silicone 55 duro I think.  he twisted It and it ripped through the pouring reservoir which was thinnest.  I thought he knew what the point was, but the new mold is a relief really and I got some accelerator and made it wider as with the vacuum on it it would bubble a bit, and the print I waxed and made smooth, and have a good level surface I can use to pull against to get the part out.  you used air pressure on your pour and air holes right?  I'm always wrestling with a mold or copper wire.   the wheel mold is good and a huge pour hole its just this core mold that's harder to fill.  filling with carbon too and the resin is 200f

Hello, I'm sorry to ask these question here, I'm sure they have answers somewhere in here but the thread is too long to read it all and the replies usually go out of context. 

1. These hubs seems to have been developing for a long time, do you have a finished product ready for sale? 

2. If not, how much time do you estimate development should finish?

3. What's the maximum power they could hold (maximum current and maximum voltage?

4. Are they comparable with R-SPEC ghosts in power/torque delivery or are there any tests that have shown better performance?

1. They are around 90% complete. It’s mostly about optimizing the assembly at this point and really, just wheels.

2. Likely within the next month. All of the pieces are there, it’s just assembly and figuring out the wheels. But we already know a lot about the wheels, so can’t imagine it will take that much longer.

3. We haven’t tested then new wind, which should perform even better than the wind I did on my v3 motors. And with those, I tested to 1500 battery watts continuous per motor without any issues. They could likely do much more. I wouldn’t worry about it. Your vesc and most likely, battery will limit you far before the motors will.

4. They are likely just as powerful, maybe a bit more powerful, it’s like comparing apples to oranges at this point. The v3 test I did where I race mojo on the r2, I beat him by a little more than double, but I hade 4wd vs his 2wd. And that was with the old wind also. It’s unknown at this point who will land on top.,but I expect they will be very similar in torque.

Are these hubs going to support 12S?

At 12S, 50.4V and 1500W, a little less than 30A per motor, people have been running 80A on outrunners at 12S with 4000W motors, can you compare the power delivery between outrunners and hubs? or the maximum power can't be used to compare performance between them?

based on 78kv, 83mm tire, 1:1 gearing (hub), 0.057ohm, 46v pack, 30a battery limit per motor, 90a motor limit per motor:

https://image.ibb.co/bKsnn7/54151d6e32a232b6687333983d5e443b9c1422ed.jpg

with ~30% larger tires (~107mm), 4 motors & ~35a-40a battery limit per motor looks like you’d have enough power there for 45mph.

We recommend 12s for these hubs. I'm sure you could do much higher also, theres nothing really stopping you.

1500 watts per motor in 4wd is where I start to lose traction on hard accelerations, so if you really need every little bit of power, theres always that option.

In terms of how much power these motors can take, it's really unknown at this point. I think 1500w con is a conservative number.

At the end of the day, what makes a motor powerful and to be able to handle high current and high amps:

- Small air gap (check)
- Large stator (check)
- Lots of copper (check)
- Big and powerful magnets (check)
- Ultra low winding resistance (check)
- High heat components in case things do get hot under high loads (check)

In terms of size, these are larger than most outrunner motors. Bigger stator, more copper, and a lower winding resistance. Everything in the motor is rated to at least 300 F, most parts are rated to 400 F, though I wouldn't recommend getting them close to there. If you really want the power, 4wd is a better way to go anyways. Don't think the focbox or any vesc can reliably do 80a con anyway. You do less stress on the motors and esc's also. I think 3000w con is more than enough for most who want a dual drive hub motor. That's 10x the power output of those cheaper china hub motors.

The only outrunners I expect will beat these hub motors will be 80mm outrunners. Those guys have a much larger stator, larger magents, ect, and a hub motor made for air filled tires would be the only way you could compete with those things. Even then, I beat Dereks 80mm motors off the line 3/3 times. Only time will tell!

ive been trying to pour this extremely finicky rubber first that needs to be kept from open-air and under a nitrogen blanket.  75 duro and 75 percent rebound is awesome stuff.  it's definitely harder to get right than the rest of the stuff I have.  it will happen.  the parts look good but with air bubbles from exposure to oxygen I think.  fear not and i'm looking into it.  I have other easier stuff to pour but want to go for this first.

the rubber will soften at higher temp but as long as the core doesn't crack or stretch the mass of rubber has shown to be unaffected in the past.  the mass of rubber is pretty buffered by the core which isn't thermally conductive but the mass of soft rubber will have problems if it hits about 170f.   That is this rubber specifically with 75 duro and rebound which we hope works out and there's also some slightly harder lower rebound stuff that is high heat resistant as the fall-back plan.  be testing this stuff as soon as spot weld and plug it all.

We said long before the raptor was realease that they needed a core. Jason didn’t listen to us, and advetually decided he needed a core. So far, nobody has made a good core that last though. So it’s a lot of trial and error.

What sort of problem are you having with the vacuum pump? 
I don't know if the problem is because of the oil or not but you are supposed to change the oil very frequently since they absorb the vapours and break down or something like that.

 i'll convince evohyax or my gf to drive the longer distance to get one today or tomorrow.   Hes probably riding around now.     But it works and @evoheyax has the only motors with half decent wheels as we get this rubber molding happening.  Any of you want to swing over and see what happens after 2pm every weekday and the weekends you can get involved!   the little luke told me was they are good from a standstill without sensors and rubber is cush.   Have to see if it's as durable as it states on the data sheet.  I pretty much just look at the tensile strength and its better than the past 80duro stuff which was pretty durable other than the core.  .

if you have advice on variables on the vesc tool worth adjusting that could possibly optimize anything please tell us.  These motors have low kv and need less switching speed with the pwm is one thing I heard.   Also in the past high "motor amp" settings showed to be a great improvement in low speed torque and smoothness from standstill.  you've heard that last one before probably.

the pump...it chugs over for 2 seconds and off. this is the second pump of the same model off amazon that sucks.  I talked to them on the phone and they recommended sending it back and not trying to fix it.  they seemed to know what was up immediately.   oil in these things last a long time and doesn't get dirty for a while.  If you know a nice pump that will do a strong and fast evacuation that is QUIET please tell me.   I do these at home so the quieter the longer I can stay up at night doing this.  this crappy kozyvac 12whatevers pump is too loud and so have been the older pumps Ive owned.

Thanks for the advice. Will try tomorrow. Had to make a day trip a tahoe today.Car's been n the shop so I missed most of the season. Li-ion though always disappoints. This is my third try with a li-ion battery, and it's always the same under powered feeling. With lipos, theres always a big jump feeling, but it's so gradual with li-ion. Running firmware 2.54 with watt control mode 4wd. I will setup another 4 in the near future with a lipo board to compare with. But efficiency is crazy. Did 15 blocks up hill and only went from 4.2 per cell to 4.1. That's crazy when you consider that 4.2 to 3.8 only has at best 10% of power, there's usually a quick jump to 3.8 (at least in the past). granted, I'm using a 12s4p, but it's still seems like way better efficiency then the v3's, likely due to halving the resistance.

It’s not that they are harder, if anything maybe easier. But they will eat up more polyurethane, so they will cost more. And we don’t have matching sizes wheels for 2wd besides 83mm. But 4wd could do 83mm, 97mm, 107mm, or six shooters off the bat (still need to test six shooters, but I don’t think we will have any problems that can’t be over come.

No, they are specially designed for hummies hub, no adapters. They sit partially on the hub, and partially off, and they would bolt on to where the plate normally is instead of the plate. So your weight wouldn’t be testing on the screws, but on the hub still, but the six shooter would be attached. Pyschotiller already did the designs and sent me the 3D files. They look good, just need to get a few made.

Six shooters are still a bit away honestly. We have to figure out a wind that works for them and test and test and test lol. The tubes need to be able to do 150F at a min, safer if higher just in case. Could be a few weeks to a few months, depending on how quickly we get the orders out. Current motor assembly is the priority over experimental systems. But it will happen, just will take time.

Good news though, we are officially starting to shoot video for the kick starter campaign today. We would like to transition once these motors are shipped straight into the Kickstarter.

its not the coolest name "steelhubs"  and when I tell people they always ask what I said.  how about "revomotors.com?  bought that.  also bought pervomotors and was going to do a website that had one direction for guys and another for girls.   not pc but would be more fun to make.


especially mild or soft steel is not as hard as other things,  but hardness can be brittle, and magnetically this softer steel is ideal in that it's ferromagnetic but it also is able to switch the polarity of the magnetic field within it easily: it is magnetically soft.   a magnetically harder material, like a hardened steel, is stronger physically but will be more prone to snapping than bending when it does reach it's physical limit and also magnetically harder and will heat more easily from the switching magnetic field.  hysteresis.

I got bucks for this premo rubber and order that today.   only other hold up is the magnets...guy told me two weeks time a month ago now but now says one more max...and then it's shipped super fast from china and luke is the magnet boy and does those at "rocket" speed.   I bet he will finish everyone's bell in a day or two max.   so this coming week or two..we should be there.  those are the last bits needed

Just got mine going. Quieter than the old motors and much quieter than evoheyax s.  It's either the focbox or the larger magnets in the rotor.  I'm betting the bigger magnets n testing tonight.   I'll put up some video tonight w good sound.

Hello @Hummie  is everything sorted out so far? Or are there still more quirks to be handled?
Do you have any clue if @evoheyax rocket board will be ready for shipping approx the same time? It would be great to ship them together.

glad to say after a couple hundred miles of testing up mountains and everything else there are no quirks!   Did twin peaks two days ago at like 30mph up and down and hit a max of 140f and the wheels and more importantly the core of the wheel is showing no deformation or even wear!  
We're waiting for more of this awesome 75 duro rubber to arrive which has shown to be really pretty durable.  I have like 8 gallons of other rubber but its not as nice as this 75 duro stuff.  other than that we need more magnets which were supposed to be here last week!  And there's also a need for more of the wheel core resin.
At this point my word is mud and I thought we'd be further along by now but really its just these parts that are needed.  When the resin and magnets get here there's nothing stopping me from getting them out.  We have a bunch of motors done already and wee plan to do a lot of work tomorrow and I'll post some pics of what we finish and also still have to post some riding footage.  cant seem to get my videos up here.   not much of a video but the drone crashes.  I'll get a good one tomorrow w sound and also some good pics of the done motors...redeem my word

He's a lot better than Carvon in many aspects I think.  I was very anti-hub at first and was all about the V4's,  but after seeing the crazy good quality and detail in every aspect that has been put into those hubs it was an easy decision.  My main concern has always been the weight that is put on the bearings for hubs, but I feel pretty confident these will be vastly superior to all other hubs.

yea I'll do the bigger wheel very soon.   just waiting for the rubber to show in like two weeks and magnets in like a day or two but will have EVERYTHING done other than those parts.  I'll post a pic with a lot more motors stacked up similar to the pic above

replacing the bearings is doable with a couple standard tools and if you look back a couple pages I show the tools: an 8mm allen wrench (2$), a two pin spanner that is typically used for a bicycle freewheel (10$), and a c-clip tool (depends how good you want anywhere from 10 to 60 bucks).   those tools take everything apart.    but I'll also be using retaining fluid on the bearings, which is glue to make them effectively an interference fit instead of a the slide fit they are, so they also will need to be pressed apart using a press.

for the same performance (same kv), ohmic motor heating is directly proportional to the motor winding resistance.

60a motor amps, 0.1ohm vs 0.05ohm:

60a * 60a * 0.1ohm = 360w ohmic motor heating

60a * 60a * 0.05ohm = 180w ohmic motor heating

Hummie is your board 4wd? I'm curious how heat dissipation is being addressed as any hub motor will produce more heat internally vs an exposed outrunner because of the urethane wrap. Maybe Raptor hubs are getting hotter because it's only 2wd and thus working more to propel a load.  Whereas the Hummie hubs have 4wd and distributing the heat better between 4 motors vs 2.

hummie is riding 2wd, I am riding 4wd. neither of us are having heat issues.

On the raptor 2 note, I expect us to see similar temps between the 2 motors. Too hot to touch and hold is around 105 F, and that's not very hot. We are still getting 150 F going up mountains for example. But again, it really doesn't matter because your losses at that temp are still quite low and it is half the temp that the weakest part can handle. Before, I would hit 270F 4wd with the v1's on my route, now I am at 110-120F with the v4's on the same route. Heat is really a non-issue at this point.

The question of heat will really come down to whether 1wd can be done or not. It might have similar characteristics to that of a dual drive of the v1 motors, which would mean ok for lighter, flat ground riders. That still needs to be tested, so so does a lot of extra pieces, lol.

Just an update on the motor side of things. We have 5 gallons of this rubber we were going to pour, in a 77-85 duro. But they found a better 75a with the properties we are looking for. And we've been riding this for weeks, wheels still look near perfect. So we really don't want to pour a harder wheel if the softer stuff is holding up, which seems to be the case. The issue though, they are out of stock, and it'll be a few weeks before they get anymore. Hummie is looking at other suppliers to try to find something similar, because 3 weeks is a long time. But on an update, we are up 17 pairs of motors pressed, and magnets will be here monday. We have enough winding epoxy now in hand for at least 200 motors, way more than we have parts for now, so well be dipping and do final assembly likely next week on these motors. And we have another 5 sets ready for pressing, which will likely happen today.

The next issue that's coming is a shortage of magnets. We have enough for 20 motors coming, and enough to do another 10 on hand. So we will have 15 sets fully assembled very soon. But we are talking to multiple magnet places and it looks like we'll be able to get more in hand before the rubber is even back in stock.

Things are progressing and really hope we are shipping soon. The rubber is the big hold up now, but I think is worth the wait. It's very similar to the centrax wheel in feel, much softer than anything used on any hummie hubs in the past, and you really can feel the difference.

was just building with luke and he'll post a pic of what we're at.  magnets should be here tomorrow or Monday I forget and that part is quick n easy risk-free.

I sense a long message here but bear with me.   there's two things we're doing,you probably would want to know.  one thing is the magnets coming are nine millimeter wide, as it was assumed, by me, that the motor constant km, was one-dimensional compared to what it is and spun at a no load speed with maybe 3amps draw the 9s might be a hair better, JUST BECAUSE THEIR KV WAS LOWER but in the 3 dimensional world where there's a much higher current draw, the 10mm magnets shine.  and the bad news is these new magnets coming are 9mm.  500 or 300 I forget.  I also just ordered 500 of the 10mm magnets.  25 days he assures me now that his wedding is over.  prices ive gotten down to just under 20$ per motor.  money is not so easy as id like so you have two options.  either take the 9mm magnets or wait for the 10mm.  and it will have to cost you for the difference.  the 10s definitely roll much easier coasting, run maybe 15% cooler, and have the higher top speed.  I cant go into the details on speeds and it would depend.  Now that my bearings are loosening up the 10s roll really well unpowered and I can get some video up for you showing.  to me the 10 rock for all the reasons above.  I want you all to have them.   we cant afford to throw the 9s away though. 
 but forget it and lets deal in the present where considering the rubber isn't available for 3 weeks there's no real wait for the 10mm magnets at 25 days because there aren't tires.  with the ridiculous surprise of not being able to get the materials to pour for a vague three weeks I've been looking back into getting tires poured.  I'm talking to Aend and I think can get them pouring what I have or possibly their soft stuff and other materials for us and really just got back into looking at it
and then there's the option of me just getting the core stuff for the wheel, which that at least is available, and pouring this 5 gallons of this harder rubber.  I don't want to do it and lhad planned to return it and now mores so for the big raising of money to get Aend doing the wheels.  I can do these lesser wheels, or even some other harder stuff that's i'll have forever regardless, or can do the better stuff in 3 weeks, or can get all materials returned and go for the pros.  I'm no pro.  I can do it but would rather pass it off as soon as possible anyway.  really couldn't get anyone to do it because the core material had to be tested first...and now it has.   so tomorrow hopefully I can tell you what they say as far as how long things would take.  

but that's just what I think now and don't let me move you one way or the other and tell me what you want to happen and I can get cracking open the big can of lesser stuff in days when we'd have the core stuff.  but given my track record so far maybe should stick to motors and leave that operation to pros.    it all hinges on how long Aend will take. and i'll hit up that other place here in cali too.  lambada or something.  it was in the works like a year ago now and let it drop till we knew what would work

  Lets take it step by step and I'll tell you what the pro rubber place timeline's are hopefully tomorrow.

So if I'm understanding that correctly, basically it'll be 25 days till the good magnets come in.  In the mean time the other hold up is the thane, and your going to outsource it to some pros, with the hopes that they can finish around the same time as the magnets, and then just put it all together and hopefully we'll be ready in about a month assuming all goes to plan?

Edit

Also, if others don't want to wait, they can have their motors sooner if they go with the smaller magnets and thane you pour yourself.  Correct?

So the progress, just to continue on what John has sai. We pressed a few more tonight, up to 38 motors pressed and wound. These will be dipped soon and finished and more are being wound now and I’m sure all of the motors we can have will be done before rubber can arrive or we can get wheels made.

Onto the order numbers, I was just bugging John about this tonight because business wise, everything is a giant mess. All of the info is scared between PayPal, emails, and pms. What I’m planning on doing tomorrow is going through PayPal to compile a list of all of the orders since there’s no way for us to even know how many have been sold at this point. What I am thinking of also doing is having everyone fill out a quick google forum that I willl collaborate with the PayPal data I will compile tomorrow. With all of this, I can get the orders organized so everyone gets what they had agreed to when purchasing the motors. But I’ve been putting that off because we haven’t tested any other higher kv winds and we’re in limbo now with the wheels, whether to wait for this stuff or get it poured for us (which was always the end goal, it’s just hard to get through that initial cost). This is why it’s important for us to compile the data and make sure we don’t get into a situation where we over sell the amount of motors we have parts for. I’m confident we haven’t hit that point yet but it’s getting close.

So again, more waiting... there is stuff to do in the mean time so these motors are not going to be delayed by too much more than they would have even if we had wheels right now. But the wheels are a minor set back and the end of may at this point seems like a best case scenario which is also unlikely. If we do get wheels made elsewhere, I can see it taking some time, 1-2 months most likely. But they will be nicer wheels and maybe we can even get them to match, which would be cool.

Ok, with out further a due:

That's ok you don't have to 'like' my posts, lol.  I'll still like yours haha.  Ughhhh, damn... So you guys don't have any 10 magnets at all?  The motors that are being shown is just the stators pressed on the truck, so I'm guessing they aren't inside the motor can as that's where the magnets aren't?

Man that really sucks...  So I've been planning on a 4WD build, so I gotta add another $80 to it now... Why did you guys order all those magnets if you weren't sure they were the ones that performed the best? Also now it might be another 2 months even...   Uhhhhh, soul crushing...  I know you guys are working hard and want to get us the best possible products so don't feel bad.  That's just really bad news to find out...  Crap, a 4WD build already was becoming crazy expensive, lol.

Sorry for the sob story, I'll be ok, lol.  Well, as always, thank you for the update.  I imagine this wasn't fun finding everything out, so I know at all really appreciate you guys keeping us in the loop, good or bad.

I have 10mm magnets for maybe 3 or 4 motors.  as it's looking everything will go out together.  there's variables there and have to hear back from the pu places but we can at least get in at a basic level and have to hear about the details on that.   the goal is get at least 100 wheels done by myself or someone immediately.  the magnets are an assured 25 days and we could spend two or three days straight building the rotors with them.  its all about the wheels.  I can pour but...its like a nonstop process for me and this isn't at a hobbiest level anymore.  

but not necessarily 2 months and that in my mind is the far limit of what I'm willing to do with somewhere else, because then its assured that all motors will be done with possibly all 10mm mags even, and they can all go to the post office at once!  that would be ideal for me.  going to the post office sucks.  we'd just get things to everyone by the end of the summer.  I'll tell you what I find tomorrow

the decision to get the 9mm mags and not the ten was based on a limited understanding of the motor constant km.  I assumed it was one dimensional but things change and at higher loads ....magic happens and the bigger magnets not only irronically have a higher kv but stay cooler and have a lot less rolling resistance.  so the 9s were chosen without real world testing just on bad km understanding.  mistakes happen a lot.  I fuck up left and right but it gets to the good end eventually.
the ten mm magnets are much nicer.  really like the easy coasting and finding the fat bearings took a while to break in. and the temp difference is really noticeable being at 140f to 150f.  and it just kicks it to the higher top speed at like 30mph.  the best of all worlds which is really pretty weird.
will figure the rubber out pronto and get you all your motors this summer.  I know I thought it would be sooner, probably naively, but this will happen.  motors with tires this summer.

@Hummie looking good

Take a look at this software I found  http://motoranalysis.com , freeware and should give you a few insights on what’s happening in your motor even without a background in the theory, there are a few videos that help to get the program running on the basic functions

I see you guys changing things a lot of times, rubbers, magnets, etc and imagine it must be costing a lot of money from your pocket, maybe a little bit of time spent on the design side can save a lot of money


Keep up the good work

Cheers

Ladies and gentlemen, you are witnessing a very public Research and Development. This is how it goes!

Hummie, you might see if you can get a significant other to sell the 9's in bulk to someone else to double down on the 10s.

@Pedrodemio I've used that program but didn't run a simulation comparing the 9 vs 10, but Ive heard simulations aren't as reliable with sharp edged parts near the magnetic fields (the outside of the flux ring is 90 degree angles...but the flux ring is so thick it might not matter).  ill run it and see.    never seen a program that would reveal how much cogging happens or how little unpowered rolling resistance there is and that's a big improvement with the 10s and think only real world testing would show...it was a necessity and i had to buy them in bulk to get them to make them.  

i might be able to sell the magnets with stators to someone who wants to make motors.  anyone?

I'm still at the beginning at MotorAnalysis, but with FEMM you can do cogging torque you have, and the cogging toque plus mechanical loses at the bearings should give you the resistance torque of the motor

As any finite element models, the results is only as good as your knowledge of the loading, the solver, the material data you supply and the quality of the mesh. As my professor of structural analysis always said "is easy to make the results look beautiful, doesn't mean they are valid"

What magnets do you have? I may be interested in the near future. Dimensions and magnetic proprieties

@uigiroux it’s easy to make something spin, but hard you have to keep efficiency up and have high torque on a small package

I still disagree with hummie that the 9mms are better than the 10s. We can agree less rolling resistance, the heat experiment was not scientific by any means. He rode 2wd, 1 with 10mm magnets and 1 with 9mm magnets. But the motors if I remember correctly we’re slightly different Kvs to begin with.

So until he runs a predefined course the same style of riding with 2 of each and compare, I won’t say the 10mm magnets are better. I am quite happy with the 9mm magnets, a bit more torque with the 9mm also.

The other thing too is the bells are not that hard to replace. So it’s easy to switch from 9mm to 10mm later if you wanted. Just need a press, a tool for the c clip, and retaining fluid for when you put it back together, and a razor to scrape the old retaining fluid off the bearings.

I know I’ll still keep riding 9mm magnets. We are getting down to the little things that make slight differences now. The hub motors are still far better in the current state than anything else on the market in terms of power capability, torque, and quality.

So... Would we maybe be able to order them with 9s and when the 10s come in could we order those and have em swapped out?  If we could do that, then we could also go with the thane you guys have currently and get the premium made ones later than too?  Would this be something we could possibly do so we could get these much sooner?  I'm doing a 4WD build, but I'd be willing to just start with a 2WD set up so only half the motors would need to be retrofitted.

I just sent molds and stuff to Aend to look at.  I'm probably going to get them to do it and we could scrimp the bucks together for ten prototype molds.   5 weeks they said till they will have a run of 40 done.  and another run after that and that should be close to everyone.  
they pour rubber for abec and say while that formula may be controlled,( he wasn't sure) he assures me the owner is a chemist and they have what we want in a durable 75 duro with high rebound.

its a steep initial cost but syched to be out of the woods with the tires.  pouring with my big toaster in the back of my house wasn't a realistic solution, so says my girlfriend and landlord.   it would've taken me forever.   

but we're not out of the woods yet completely and just have enough for them to start...and need to round up the bucks at the end when they've made them.   we're talking about 6 thousand for molds and then have to get 500 parts made and then they're 7 bucks each!   but I'm now remembering many people I told could get bigger wheels.  all I can say is remind me and show me in the future some evidence of this and we can work it out.  get you extra tires or give you a set of the bigger ones when that hurdle gets crossed but at this point 83mm is the start.  I hope this isn't too upsetting for people but do promise to keep pursing the bigger wheels. at least one of the molds would be done for that so easier to do. 

so need bucks one way or the other. 
..we bought parts for 100 and with these new magnets coming in the mail in like 20 days and the ones that just showed..and a couple more stators to get...we can make 100 motors no sweat.  we have the million other ingredients actually I wont go into but its there.  we just need wheels done.  

500$
 a set with the matching abec11 centrax 83 and other v2 195 truck is what Id like to sell them for and compared to the rest of the motor industry these are a rarity in many ways and have the best ingredients.  



 I'm back to "liking" everything

and I took dinero with the intention of getting those bigger wheels made for people but if we get these 83mm wheels made first, which seems appropriate and they are very nice and smooth with the 75 duro, it will be quick and assured but longer to get the bigger tires.   

i'll be spending my day looking for other pourers who maybe could do it cheaper and we could maybe get the bigger mold started now but I don't want to gamble here and Aend has a chemist owner who wants to make their own formula for the important core part, while others places...I don't know and will see if theyre willing to pour the materials Ive been pouring and proven good.  decide tomorrow as it's all-in with whatever we do.

ive had one person say they want their bucks back just now.  I'm on very thin finances to get this done to begin with and hope people can see this for what it is, an assured way to get us the best wheels within a certain time period.  we don't have to rely on me for this monster tire production. it may be you end have to take the 83mm wheels for the present, and for the summer!!!!..and get the bigger wheels later for no cost.

At this point, the hold up is wheels. Hummie has talked to over 35 polyurethane pouring manufacturers. We have a couple good looking leads from those. One is the same factory that pours pig wheels, and they would use the same core material we know while last a long time. We will see what happens, and unfortunately, new business happens slowly. We will have all motors fully assembled and tested with in the next 2 weeks. If anyone wants to ride around on carpet with them, or wants them to start building and hopefully, wheels aren't too far behind.

The other option is we pour you really hard wheels they might not last very long and feel like shit to ride. But we are trying to avoid that option. We know the right materials to use now, it's just getting a place to do it right, quickly, and for the right price.

There is no part of this motor that if it broke, couldn't be replaced pretty cheaply. Stator winding blew out? $20 for us to fix + labor. Bearing failed? Give us 10 minutes and $10 to fix it. Need new rotor because somehow, you managed to break a magnet or something? Give us $30 and it's fixed.

Everything will be cheap and easy to fix, which won't even matter for most of you, cause I don't see much left to go wrong. It's all been tested pretty well at this point. But unlike hub motors before this, if anything does go wrong, repairs are not expensive or impossible (any motor will be fixable with this design), and don't require many tools (less than $50 in tools). There will never be a reason to throw a broken motor away (lets face it, odds are someone will find a way to break one at some point, even if we can't, haha).

We just need the wheels and we're good. Good news is I'm lining up some good interviews right now and should have a well paying software engineering job soon, so I'll be able to kick more bucks into another round of motors in the near future so we can get these in stock at some point.

Aend seemed to change the goal post and started out luring me in and then ...we're going to see and still might get them to do it.  have two or three other places in the works.  I'll update you guys when we figure it and and its moving.  as soon as the tires are being made the woods are cleared.  Im pushing for as soon as possible!  if we cant have things done by someone within 5 weeks, or maybe a hair longer, I'll be doing them.   we're definitely getting these done and out to you all by mid summer.

Aend pours for abec (abec does not pour wheels themself), so going to them is cutting out the middle man. Chris wanted way too much to have wheels poured with him. And we have places promising just as good, if not better, than abec. The stuff we have been riding is very similiar to abec. Also a 75a duro. Hard to tell the difference honestly. Aend seems to also want way too much and with them, we would be trying new core materials. They refuse to pour the stuff we have been using that we know works. The company that does pig wheels said they could do it with the stuff we’ve been using, which would eliminate any risks in my mind, because it’s the first material we’ve tried that actually holds up.

Been a busy past couple of days. We have 24 x 9mm magnets bells glued. 26 motors dipped and baked. You can tell the dipped va not dipped by the color. For the first 24 motors, just need to do final assembly and spin them all to confirm all is good.

Still waiting on the 10mm magnets. Seems like 1-2 more weeks on those. It seems we will likely be pouring wheels again also. Every place is taking things too slowly and we need to get these motors out. So it seems by the end of next week, we could be pouring wheels again. We’ll still pursue a place to pour for us, but we don’t want to hold everyone up any longer. Wheels are super easy to replace also.

sent a set of motors out yesterday to Seth because he was ok taking the badly poured last of what I had poured before running out.  these are Aend's doing.  I'm really syched on their using the rotor as the mold center. We're getting close to coming to an agreement on something.  either they do them or I do with aluminum molds maybe made by them and possibly with their resin.


going one way or the other for sure next week and other than the wheel i have enough parts for something like 60 motors, and i sold 60, but i have enough motors for like 30 more motors except some magnets which i can get in a month,  tens i just got notice in the mail, but all dollars are going towards the unknown cost of the wheels at this point and no funds going out that way yet.  but if i got new money from buyers hummmm....  500$ to humminashadeeba@gmail.com paypal and i can add you to the list.  

but this is just their trials pouring it and I'm sure we can get it better looking with them or me doing it.

speaking of urethane been back talking a long time with Aend on the phone and we have some options, both of which I'm happy with, and he says will give me the full details including time till completion of a double-priced super short 100 tires with ten molds made.  syched.  super happy to have called him not emailing and somehow this possibility of them doing it like this with a possibility of a rush job slipped through the cracks and I swear I thought it was a different deal.  its just a matter of how long it will take and he says he'll see if he can do a rush job and we will see.  
or they will be designing the molds for me and i'll get them cut locally quickly and I'm on it.  I'm tempted to design it and it seems simple to make the giant mug with a hole in the bottom that can bolt on the rotor, using the rotor for the mold, but he's the pro and designs all their molds.  exciting times and we're moving.  summer is here for me and will update you with a concrete date on done tires from pros and I think American pros are more on time.  and then we can just get more molds done in the future and can drop the price down from the double price at 15$ maybe roughly per tire for this small run.  not that you guys are paying it.   Very tempted to take an overnight sleeping lay-down pod bus down there he was telling me about.  see how it's done.  the monster wheel machine. 
majority rules.  we want green.  or blood red.  or black.  or grey with hit o purple.  or white?  been dyyying to get these ugh.

Black and white is the safest since well with black is black no matter where you run and white can be dyed into any color. Off tangent colors should be saved for another run, especially if pigmentation has shown to affect formulas of  wheels before.

If he does white then you (the consumer) can just dye them whatever color you want. It takes 20 minutes with Rit synthetic. You can also mix dyes together to get even more colors.

Have to slightly dremel these to fit tomorrow. Not the final molds just something to test the core material and fit. i still dont have a time on when they will be done but I was talking to the lady at skates on haight, who've been around a long time and gotten aend to make a couple wheels in the past,  anyway she was saying a lot things but one of which is a lot of wheels coming out of aend have a cut off corner.  And they were encouraging me to make it round like one side here it or do a sharp cut at the end instead.  so sharp or round?  i do whatever they recommend and square ended is out i guess.

i flipped my paris v2 hanger over and lower now. i didnt now they were reversible.

  think i'll try harder bushings i just got.  i never switched stuff up before.

Innovation an development is a journey,,,it takes time and we should all be thankful to have the opportunity to be part of Hummies vision.  I have one of his decks (v2) and it is awesome.  I have ordered a battery and enclosure from psychotiller and look forward to putting the complete board together.  We need more visionaries pushing technology and my hats off to Hummie.  He is bringing new ideas and new products to our community.

So, for all of you wondering if these things actually exist (as I did after waiting a year), I finally got mine set up and took for my first test ride through NYC. Hummie sent me some wheels that weren't poured perfectly, but seem to ride fine. 

Torque on these is insane, even with a little 12s2p battery. Almost too much for this 29" deck. Anyway, should be worth the wait for everyone. Not quite as powerful as a dual 6374 belt setup, but miles ahead of the Carvon V4 as far as powerful/torque.

High speed brake is determined by how much current you can put back in the battery, probably the raptor is setup with a lower current to maximize battery cycle life instead of strong brake

![thumbnail|666x500](upload://1H33nWqJuyj4BsuvlocBPWpZc3d.jpg)Got 3/4 up mt. tam today and stopped to check the temp and make sure things were ok as i felt a lurch and one motor was 180f and other 110f.  One motor cut out pretty continuously and I didnt notice.  it did feel weaker but I thought it was related to the battery being discharged for so long at a steady unknown big draw and maybe sagging.   then on the way down the motor is coming on and off while braking and super sketchy and im standing at each end of the board waiting for it to lurch.  reminds me of having a faulty canbus but that seems good.  motor leads seem solid.  
between this and my crappy remote losing connection as well it was not a relaxing ride.   
the new tires are awesome.

unrelated but flipped the paris v2 hanger in the back.  it was 50 degree and dont know what it is now but do you think this could cause some kind of a binding when turning with the two hangers at different angles?  i guess different angles is pretty commonly done though.  it does feel very different and dont like it as much.

ordered 600 black allen head steel screws for the front plate so youre getting those not these silver ones.  gunna be slick.  still havent gotten around to gold plating or bluing anything but one day.   Bluing...just stick it on my gas burner I guess after polishing and cleaning.

Hummie, do you run your motors in FOC, or BLDC? I’ve read that in FOC, you have to get a pushing start, because of the way the sinusoidal wave current works. Maybe other have some knowledge too. (I haven’t personally run hub motors yet)

It was actually on a guys diy video. But after doing some more research, that seems to be the case with BLDC, not FOC. But yeah, I’d like to know the pros and cons of adding sensors. I know they they’re to sense the position of the rotor in relation to the stator, but I don’t know how that practically effects the performance of the motor in FOC or BLDC.

yyyeessss!  not 5 weeks but 6 till tires done and out to me then bam out to you and we squeeze into summer. 

testing some white tires that have no core.  I assumed we'd need a core based on past materials of past manufacturers.  These are  much nicer to ride and so far holding up well and hopefully they stay good and we can get these.  Aend are the best, they even stake claim to it on their site, if ever there were a masters of the pu it's them, and they custom formulate everything and run by a chemist.

It'll be 3 weeks for them to make the molds so have time to test these coreless tires.   I go to work everyday  again but I can ride my bike to work and loan the board out here in san francisco hopefully to someone heavy and with lots trigger squeeze who can do twin peaks runs hourly or has time to go to mt tam with a car.  and then back to me in the night!

we wait for tires from Aend.   they're making molds now and we have a bit longer to test the rubber and decide before they pour the tires.   @willpark16 is testing the tires with the duro we likely will get and maybe they will be a hair harder and we will see what he says.  i keep blowing up escs and  it seems better to have other people testing at this point.   they held up well for me for the first couple weeks of san francisco hills.

Alright guys update time!!!!! These hubs are freaking amazing and you’re in for your money’s worth. So I will personally be comparing these to the raptor 2, Carvon v3, early hummie hubs and go from there. First things first these single handedly beat the Carvon v3 and early hummie hubs in torque flat out. They have almost the same if not equal torque as the raptor 2 even without sensors. I only clocked about 20 miles on them today but they stayed relatively cool and I could touch the motor can without burning my hand however it was of course warm. Now while I know we all wanted these much sooner hummie took the time to get good materials and tires because after 220 miles these tires are showing no cracks, I’ll try to clock some more mileage tmrw I’m sort of working through a few issues still, but so far I don’t have anything bad to say about them except that I prefer a dark color urethane to white but who cares when you get a well preforming product, I’m trying to obliterate these motors this week with a massive battery and tons of hills and mileage but so far the ride is soooii much smoother than the raptor 2 and nearly as smooth as the Carvon’s

If anyone has questions or things they would like to see feel free to ask, hummie Gave me the green light to put on as much testing as possible. Oh and btw I got to see his shelves full of motors too so yes it is a real product that will be delivered soon. The wait for the tires is well worth it considering some company’s have gotten such a big aspect of this wrong.

@Hummie
Just curious if there is any cogging in these motors, and how you prevent that. I’ve read that fractional slot motors are inherently less likely to cog than integral slot motors. Any way we can get more data on the motors? (Poles, phases, Kv, Kt, etc) I understand if you haven’t tested for specs, I’ve just become more curious as I’ve been reading about motors.

Cogging is caused by vesc setting, rider weight, and your battery. Now these aren’t sensored so if you don’t want to push off then you need to configure the right settings for yourself

That’s not the type of cog @RyBelnap  is talking about. Cogging torque is the tendency a motor has to align in a given position and how strong this force is, a motor with less cog rolls longer, but for our application we don’t need a very low cogging torque since we have lots of inertia given the size of the motors

When you spin the motor in your hand and fell it resisting, that’s the cogging torque

But, a motor cogging in startup has nothing to do with cogging torque. When resting, the current iteration of FOC has no way to know what position the motor is, so it just start switching the phases and hopes that the motor follows until the speed is sufficient that it can track the motor, if that doesn’t happen the motor will cog (vibrate) since the torque produced it’s not enough to overcome inertia

In BLDC mode the VESC uses high frequency injection to determine where the rotor is, so even without sensors the startup is better than FOC in more demanding situations, if I’m not mistaken high frequency injection on FOC in on Bemjamin’s todo list

its a 12 tooth 14 magnet combo with concentrated windings. 3phase.  kv typically 85.   (i think you mean cogging as in more rotation resistance and less ability to coast)  id like to get less cogging but limited to this 12 tooth stator at the moment.   maybe in the future get more teeth and keep it concentrated winding as while it seems concentrated is not ideal for reducing cogging it's better for overall power output i think.   i wonder how mellow is getting such low cogging.  maybe they changed from their 12 tooth stator or maybe they're still using it.    

changing from 9 to 10mm wide magnets showed a nice reduction.

They have a modular stator, so each teeth is almost in contact with each other, this way the cogging torque goes down a lot

Color is an important aspect to *some* of our builds.  While it may not all be important to you, It may be important to others. White makes it easier for the majority to worth with , so if one wishes to make them the same color as the centrax they can. Want them black ? they can, any other color of the fucking rainbow? they can. I swear some people are so hung up on what other people find important.

I have some questions... first: When can I buy one?
Second: If youre having so much trouble with the weels, why don't you use the same system as carvon does it? They just make it possible to mount any 3th party weel. That woul also make it easyer to replace them.

sure it could be done like that, a direct drive instead of a hub motor,  and there are benefits there as you say.    the main development direction with these hub motors has been durability given what has come before and it went where it went.
 one day we will have all the motors on hand to compare and I think the view will be that they are all options and its a preference thing.

So as of yesterday my testing has come to a halt since I sold my deck and am waiting on my @naf hyperbeast. During testing I used a 12s4p 30q 518wh pack and running at max speed with hard braking and rough hilly terrain I was pulling 19-20wh/mile. Being more conservative on the smoothest Irvine roads I found 12wh/mile seemed to be common. Take into bite these will fluctuate based on rider weight im barely 130ibs. My friend on the other hand at a solid 230ibs was pulling 22wh/mi on the nicer terrain and a slight increase of 27wh/mi on my hilly terrain. However it is worth noting he was braking going up hill and then accelerating constantly and he put them through a couple extreme settings that most people ordinarily wouldn’t be running these at. To my own personal delight the urethane has held up quiet well, especially on my smooth roads. When I take them onto the asphalt vibrations are much more noticeable but considering how thin the urethane is it handles them very well. Again on my raptor 2 my brain would literally be rattling in my skull in the same conditions. On 12s I’ve taken them up to 31mph however I never attempted that speed again because I am still recovering and don’t want to go backwards. The acceleration is noticeable even at 230ibs and me and my friend agree that they have similar torque to the raptor 2, this may be in part due to the 10mm magnets in my set but they handle very well. The set I’m testing with was not completed with the same amount of perfection yours will have but hummie was in a rush to get these tires tested. So one motor heats up slightly more than the other however this is due to one bearing shoving more frictions than the other and I don’t believe it is anything out of the ordinary. Even with that minor issue the ride on these is beautiful and I could say that they draw some of the smooth riding abilities of the Carvon’s and similar torque of the r2 hubs and combine them into an amazing ride. Unfortunately I haven’t been doing heat checks as much as I should have but I have so far not gotten them hot enough to not firmly grip after one of my runs. My 230ib friend did manage to get them pretty warm but not past 212 degrees(we put a drop of water on the outer metal can and it only got warm but did not boil or dissipate) I may have forgotten to include something so just ask, I would love to get up and running again currently I’m out a deck though so until then my testing has come to a bit of a halt

brakes on r2 kinda sucked on slow mode but were much better on fast mode, sort of abrupt for a lightweight guy such as myself though. The carvons are much more gradual however you wont be able to stop on a dime and you sort of have to constantly look ahead because they need a bit more distance to come to a complete stop. Hummies i feel have much better braking i can stop fast but not too hard to throw me off, and i'm not picking favorites here i really do like the raptor 2 hubs and the torque they have but they get wayyy too hot and the urethane sucks ass. carvons are great cruiser motors and have the best efficiency but the braking isnt so great, hummies don't have as much urethane so they wont feel as great as carvons but they feel pretty damn good and the torque and braking redeems them. Top speed I want to put at 35mph? but don't quote me on that i have a friend willing to take them up to top speed after I get my deck. I will say this though these are easily the best hub motors available for purchase right now, the r2 aren't sold separate, and the carvons are constantly delayed with few people knowing any information. the urethane is coming in a couple more weeks for these and by then hummie should be shipping them out. But these have been tested for quite a long time now and he didnt even bother selling you guys his v3 hubs because he wanted better. If you guys are on the fence rn just know he has been providing you with constant updates and while no one like to wait these hubs have definitely been worth it

for sure can do 12s.  almost any motor can do 12 or whatever really and the limit would be the esc being able to do it (as long as it doesnt go too fast for the bearings, which we dont do).   there seems confusion about voltage of the BATTERY and what it does in a motor.  it will not make your motor run cooler to run more voltage and actually the opposite.   So unless you really will want to go over 30something miles per hour and instead will more likley be riding in the high 20s anyway, you will be more efficient, keeping the motor cooler and getting a bit better range, running 10s.   In a power line in the sky or in the wiring for the board's battery yes higher voltage will lead to better efficiency but not the motor.  the esc converts the amps and volts that come from the battery into a different ratio for the motor and you can control that with both the motor and battery amp limits on the vesc.
i didnt realize the motors went quite so fast on 12s as i never really checked..  I always ride FOC which is a bit slower.    @willpark16 is riding 83mm tires,...the new coming are actually 84mm so a hair faster.  It would be worth going to 10s unless you really want that speed but then again...i rarely was at that speed and while doing some really long steep stuff the temp of the motors stays within what i'd consider an acceptable max temp. of 160f.   the motors COULD go up to 300f as the magnets are good to that temp and the winding wire is good to 400f for thousands of hours, and some of the bearings have grease good for 300f....but the tire polyurethane is surely the weakest link.   what temp it can do, you tell me!!!  so far ive been really amazed by these prototype tires' durability and ride quality.

130mm tire?!!?   how bout a 90 or 97 next.  but guys just ride these with the 84mm now and give it a bit of time and I said I'd get the bigger tires made and will.   what's going to have to happen is a kickstarter or some other way to get a large investment.  Now i have just enough money for what we are getting and will be able to make a couple motors beyond but business is stuck really held back by not having....like 30,000$ for materials.  all the money i raised in the past went to get these parts for 100 motors and about 70 are accounted for.   So myself and @professor_shartsis and probably @evoheyax with some others will be quickly throwing together some kind of video and straight to kickstarter.  Ive stopped taking orders for motors for the last couple weeks until everyone who paid gets theirs and want to spend time not selling but doing this video.   If any of you have any experience or desire to be involved in making this kickstarter video lets talk when the tires come.   

i just wrote aend again to hear whats up.   last i understood it would be like 2 more weeks for the tires and will update you when i hear the latest.

i ran a comparison for 10S vs 12S... 60a motor limit 60a battery limit for both....

the electrical to mechanical conversion efficiency in the motor doesn't seem to be affected (green line top left chart)... but you lose a few miles an hour of top speed with 10S.

system-wide it would appear you may lose a little bit of efficiency with 10S because, as seen in the bottom right chart, at 10S you have to draw a few more amps from the battery at all speeds to maintain the same 60a motor amp limit in the motor, and consequently you generate a bit of extra heat in the battery wires with 10S compared to 12S, lowering the system-wide efficiency.

real world who knows what was going on and hard to get a true test done but here's a simulation with the only variable changed being the voltage.  same speed.  look at the bottom and it breaks it down 

total system efficiency with the 10s is better and it ends with a lower motor temp. this is just a change of voltage first shot

this one here is an increase of kv and has similar results.

interestingly I did a second 12S vs 10S comparison with 60a motor limit and 30a battery limit (instead of 60a motor 60a battery)

in the new comparison you get higher motor efficiency with 10S above the speed that you hit the 30a battery limit because above this speed you get less motor current at the same 30a battery amps with 10S... and less motor current means less heat generated and consequently greater efficiency.

(notice the green line top left chart -- motor electrical to mechanical conversion efficiency -- gets a slight boost with 10S)

what i posted and @professor_shartsis posted show to disagree.  i have more faith in the simulation i posted due to who made it, jason lee who owns endless sphere, and its widespread use, vs shartis' which hasnt been through nearly the trials and oversight and it's not as encompassing.


one thing that could be happening in personal experience showing more range with higher voltage is the cells are not being sucked for amps as much for the same performance and with less peak current draw a cell will produce more mah.  if you suck a cell at its peak possible current it will produce less energy than if you were to discharge it at less current.  so maybe with a lower discharge cell such as ion vs lipo, it would be even more advantageous to have higher voltage.  but assuming a cell is not decreasing its total output due to this phenomena then the graph i posted should accurately reveal the range

[/quote]

@Hummie here's all the formulas used (and verified)...

let's take 50v @ 20mph from the graph (30a battery limit & 60a motor limit, 0.07ohm winding)

20mph @ 83mm diameter = **2057.30454rpm**

2057.30454rpm / 85kv = **24.20358v back emf**

50v * %55.91814 duty = **27.95907v effective voltage**

((27.95907v effective voltage) - 24.20358v back emf) / 0.07ohm = **53.64984a motor current**

27.95907v effective voltage * 53.64984a motor current = **1500w electrical watts**

1500w electrical watts / 50v battery = **30a battery current**

(53.64984a motor current)^2 * 0.07ohm = **201.48142w ohmic heating & copper loss**

(2057.30454rpm * 2 * pi) / 60 = **215.440427 rad/sec angular velocity**

60 / (2 * pi * 85kv) = **0.11234 newton meter torque per motor amp**

heres another comparison at partial throttle which will be a bit different than the other graphs which had full throttle for the 10s and a bit reduced for the 12s to get the same speed.   when able to go full throttle the switching in the esc is ..not switching and more efficient.  so here the difference between the two is less as theyre both at partial speed.  the lower voltage is still wining in eff and somehow killing it in range.![Capture|690x435](upload://5nxsx1IDe93IjTVVROkcRCshzTt.JPG)

in the first graph you posted you said you saw 

[quote="professor_shartsis, post:1078, topic:25251"]
the electrical to mechanical conversion efficiency in the motor doesn’t seem to be affected (green line top left chart)… but you lose a few miles an hour of top speed with 10S.

system-wide it would appear you may lose a little bit of efficiency with 10S because, as seen in the bottom right chart, at 10S you have to draw a few more amps from the battery at all speeds to maintain the same 60a motor amp limit in the motor, and consequently you generate a bit of extra heat in the battery wires with 10S compared to 12S, lowering the system-wide efficiency.

100 throttle
[/quote]

shartsis's 100 throttle means pulling the trigger all the way down. not at top speed, if you look at the table you see that 12s can reach higher speed. and I assume the 100 throttle different speed is calculated for instantaneous moment as suppose to be constant speed.

when the amp limits are 60a motor and 60a battery there is no change in efficiency, but when the limits are 60a motor and 30a battery, then the 10S gets greater motor efficiency because above a certain speed, the amps in the motor are lower for the same # of battery amps.

In your latest graph i suspect the decrease in efficiency with 12S at the same speed & same motor amps is entirely explained by the higher total internal resistance of the 12S battery as opposed to the 10S pack and has nothing to do with the motor or controller. notice the difference in efficiency between the 2 systems in this condition is about a third of 1%. i strongly suspect the entire decrease in 12S efficiency shown in the graph ends up as extra heat in the battery pack.

at partial throttle the diferences are small yea but when the 10s gets to top speed, no more pwm, it has that advantage over a 12s at partial throttle and I think a lot of the losses are the esc switching for the partial throttle 12s

[quote="Hummie, post:44, topic:60150"]
I’m coming to find there’s a huge difference in rolling resistance w the different bearings. When tires come I’ll write up and ask if u guys want other bearings put in for some more bucks. No cost for 2rs sealed bearings I have from China. Lotton bearings. But they’re filled w so much heat resistant grease, which isn’t really necessary and you won’t be getting to 200f anyway. Or I recently got some ntn Japanese bearings w non contact rubber seals n they roll so much easier. If only they could be serviced on the motor as taking the motor apart to get them out isn’t easy as I want to use retaining fluid to lock it up tight. Thinking might be worth leaving the seals off so can easily clean the bearings n run them with thin lube. In fact I think the lotton bearings are probably more than good enough n they’re really huge n can take the loads even if they aren’t fancy Japanese or German.

We can decide later and haven’t closed them yet. But if u want the jap bearings they’re fregin 30$ a motor for me. Shocking the variation in bearing prices. If, in the meantime, while we wait maybe a week max more, fingers crossed, you happen to find some bearings u want or any good info or prices on 6804 and 6808 bearings, I’m willing to get them and put in on them w you. Or it’s lotton w the 2rs seals n jammed w the high heat grease.
I find u can remove and replace the seals on most bearings including these and that’s possible w the 6808 while on the motor but the smaller bearing u can’t access to get the seal off. …writing rambling n thinking. U could get the motors without being locked w retaining fluid n then could take it apart w a c-clip tool alone but eventually the shafts n housings will take a beating I fear n according to the rest of the world bearings should be locked down w a press fit r retaining fluid.
[/quote]

I’m going to reply to this in here. I think you should do a test between the different bearings and greases like @CHAINMAILLEKID has done on his YouTube channel. Personally I’d rather have the high temp grease since it should last longer and will be more resilient to water.

There are different bearing manufacturers that make various qualities of bearings, but there are also different grades of the same size of bearing that are intended for different purposes.  In general, the grease packed sealed bearings are for use in high-speed environments (20000RPM -100000RPM) environments where they can't be easily replaced.  They're sealed so they can't be service, but they can't be contaminated or have the lube leak out.  There are less expensive 'shielded' versions with the plastic shields that can be opened and re-lubed and can run on light grease or oil lubes.  They have less rolling resistance but will overheat at higher RPMs and can get contaminated thru the shields and can leak lube.

I'm rebuilding a couple of cheap hub motors (just for fun/experience, makes no financial sense), and my experience sourcing bearings is similar to what @Hummie describes.   My  inboard bearings are nice Japanese 6903Z with metal shields and the outboard are less nice but still good 6801RS with removable plastic shields.  They spin nice and are good bearings, but in order to service them you have to completely disassemble the hub, and the bearings are press fit into the inner and outer wheel plates.  It _should_ be really hard to take them apart because they are tightly fit onto the shaft.  _Except_, exactly like @Hummie describes in:

[Will Any hub motor last?](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/will-any-hub-motor-last/20072)

the inner rings have begun to rotate on the shaft, especially the inboard bearing, and now they slip on and off the shaft easily and there's a very tiny bit of  wobble on the inner one (between the inner ring and shaft, the bearings themselves are still tight AF).   Luckily all the wear seems to be on the bearing inner ring and the shaft is just a little shiny in a couple of spots so the new bearings I got to replace them are tight enough they can't be pressed on by hand.  

I'm replacing them both with nice ZZ versions from vxb.com, which are sealed with metal shields, and packed with grease, good for ~30000 RPM.  I could use cheaper oil-lubed, shielded bearings, but because I'm going to reassemble them, pressing the new bearings onto the shaft with retaining fluid, I don't expect to ever open them up again, and I want to use bearings that should never need replaced or serviced.  If the hubs were easily serviceable, I'd use slipperier oil-lubed bearings, but since they're going to be crazy hard to open up, I'm going with long-lasting, bulletproof bearings.  Reliability and longevity are more important in this case than lowest rolling resistance and serviceability, since they can't be serviced easily anyway.

A good comparison test between various bearing types and manufacturers would be awesome and super helpful, but a huge pain in the ass to do, cause you'd basically have to build a set of hub motors for each set of bearings you wanted to test, or switch them out, which is going to be hard work + you risk damaging the motors every time you press out the old bearings and press the new ones in.  

That's going to be a huge innovation in hub motor design, a way of making the bearing serviceable or replaceable without compromising the connection of the inner ring to the shaft, the outer ring to the wheel, or opening them up to contamination from outside.

No kidding,  I thought they had a pretty decent reputation.  I wouldn't replace the ones that I already have if the inner rings weren't reamed out and loose.  The bearings I got seem fine, but can't tell by looking at them.  They weren't cheap but they weren't the most expensive I could find either.  Frankly, the motors they're going into aren't that great so the bearings will probably outlast them.   Guess I will find out...

So, one thing I've come to learn pretty quickly since coming here.
The use case for bearings between Eskate, and normal longboarding is pretty different.

People here put A LOT of miles on bearings, and there's a lot of traditional skate wisdom that just doesn't account for such extended use.

I bet riders like Deckoz have a single set of bearings with more miles on them than I do across my entire collection of bearings.

  id rather sell hundreds and make a bit on each than sell a few for a high profit but investors are unlikely to go for that approach and will probably have to be a kickstarter.    I still believe a great video can be made very fast and with very little editing.   still planning to do the whole movie as just one long take going up some mountain at dawn with no talking and just overlaid with vescs temp, watts, voltage, amps, motor amps, motor temp, heart rate, all overlayed and also a banner on the bottom running the material details.   and some shots of the parts maybe even over imposed on the video so it can still stay with the one continuous shot.    I dont know how long a video should be but end at the top of the mountain.  with the right filming it would be exciting for sure.   the kickstarters with the usual many cut editing and coreography and meeting the team and their titles and the pomp and the hackneyed promotional lines...if i hear "from the ground up" again i'll hurl.  ...it goes on and on but its gross.   rather make an action video with a skinny kid and without a single spoken word and find some cool band that would do a song over it.  . ..if only could do an overlay with the data but while an overlay w the vesc is easy, getting it to constantly refresh so you can have a background other than white is programming i havent seen done.

or someone could buy 200 motors up front and wait a couple months and I'd do that. 

but you guys just want the motors already i know.  if they havent written and sent them to us by friday i'll write on monday.

theyre done.  I asked for battleship grey and we get "cool grey" .  whatever and i like it already. 

i'll write up a google doc tomorrow seeing if you want to go with the fully sealed with high heat thick white grease u can see here on the top, or the non-contact sealed w regular grease below. The Lotton brand with the high heat grease n full seal is included no charge (both motor bearings) or for 60$ more..I like the NTN non-contact seals below as they don’t have the thick grease and roll and coast easier and mainly because theyre japanese and likely are better quality
![image|375x500](upload://vnHjyvh6ijfDVe9KZKBvkJqqnkj.jpeg)

It’s nitpicking and maybe you’d want the high heat grease n full seal as it will surely be better protected and the grease last ages or it’s a fancier Japanese bearing with less protection and thinner grease.  It depends on you

I imagine it will be three days till they arrive to me and then, exhale, finally out to u.

but i have a bunch of other bearings too that are also fully sealed or some shielded, all decent brands, mainly Lotton, IDC and KYK.   It comes down to if you want to go with something fancy japanese.   the NTN i got a great price at even at the 60 dollars for two motors.  the other bearings (which are already included in the price) are about 40$ per pair of motors and not no-name slouches.
If you find another 6804 or 6808 bearing that you want or recommend im all ears but youre running out of time.   ceramic in my limited experience with them are extremely expensive if theyre at all worth buying and im too freaked to install those as i use a press to seat things and ive messed up bearings before, but its not an end of the world mistake as it is when the bearings are hundreds of bucks

I haven't bought a motor from hummie but I'm excited as fuck to see everyone riding these. Been following this thread for over a year waiting for this moment :smiley: so close!!

And just my 2 cents. We use a lot of different bearings at work, both japanese and other brands. I can easily vote for the japanese one. They do know how to make great bearings

thanks guys.  hearts all round.

you can service the big bearing and get its seal off after you get the c-clip off that's in front of it but the smaller bearing on the outside youd have to take the motor apart to get the seal off and thats more work than people would want to do.

tires came in!  look nice and show you pics soon.

I'll put up a google doc here for you to tell your address and what bearings you want.

shipping isn't included but i think i can get them into the usps priority box which is only maybe 13 bucks which i'll be hitting you up for.

if you have some strange circumstances where you took someone else's spot or something please include a link or something that will enable me to get to the bottom of it quickly. 
thanks everyone who helped get this done!!  looking forward to hearing from you later.  pm me.  I see no obstacle to getting the motors all out to you by the end of next week.

I don’t have any extra motors to sell sorry. 

For extra tires I’ll ship them to foreigners w the motors if u want but if ur local hold on a couple months and give me some feedback and have extra available then.  

I’ll confirm I can fit them in a certain size USPS priority box tomorrow and then can give all USA people a shipping price. It’ll only be like 16.   I’ll tell you tomorrow am and as soon as I get some payment from shipping, I’ll mark it on the doc, and ship then. 
I can get a bunch out sets out tomorrow n will get the rest out through next week

they dont just look nice!   so now that you all know the tires are here pressure is on and i'll be kicking them out daily.  going down the list getting them out starting tomorrow.   it'll be a quick check on the post office for shipping cost as i say and then you pay and poof i send.

the core i was insistent would be needed but they sent some tires without a core and after sending the other tires away that had cores i starting riding the tires without the core and they hold and they are a very plush ride.  they last and I was trying to make them not last.  they're still pretty experimental and hasnt been the longest testing but this pu is way better than what i poured.
im not going to try to match any colors

and you all know i do this so i can have the motors and board i want and you all helped me get it.  thanks all of you and some have waited a long time and we got it done finally.  but I am lazy and there is more to be done till they get in the box and out.  tires done.  i'll do it all next week.  i really want to be done and hunker down.  it will be a shocking lifestyle change.  ive always left everything to the last minute and i've just assessed you all as if you were the teacher on the first day of school, and i think i can get away with another week of not being fully done my assignment.  tomorrow i'll get a bunch out.  get up in the morning drink a coffee get up.  its a lazy life i lead these days.  its not living off your dollars though.  syched to have this next board running.  after i get them to you this coming week.  tomorrow i'll tell you how many went out.  and starting monday tell you what goes out.  numbers.  down the list.  and then i'll make my board.  
maybe go 10s guys, i dont thing there's any women!, at the kv they'll do maybe  34mph on 12s i think was clocked by skinny @willpark16,  if he will tell us!!.  and these were a mm smaller diameter wheel.  what that would actually equate to in mles per hour i have no idea.  but for efficiency's sake go lower voltage too as you'll be more efficient overall.  more miles per watthour.  i think he got motors from me ages ago too.  i like 12s i can not lie but think nextime go 11 and  room for a bms.  

if you broke the light on the 6.6 how much current does it draw while on (connected to battery) but no throttle?  be nice to have it always on.  no button to push!



plugs i dont want to add and expect you all have a soldering iron and a couple different things you want to do.  i'll send you wire 10 or 12 awg i think 10 inches was good.  im not an especially good solderer and i suspect anyone who thinks they are good..until i see a conductance test and thats never done. so.  a soldering showdown..maybe youre better at it than me and you do it.  its a weird job skewering a 17awg solid copper wire into the multistrand.  i tin them both, first making a good indent into the multistrand with the solid wire first. its probably idiot proof and you have huge overlap. and dont forget the shrink wrap on first! maybe two layers why not.

Hey @Hummie, I know you said you're not taking new orders a while ago, I was just wondering if you maybe have an estimate about when you will start accepting new orders. And roughly how much should we expect the cost to be for the motors and for shipping to EU/UK.

Sorry, I know your focus is on fulfilling the current orders right now, just checking if there's anything to know for us late-comers that haven't been following the thread and want to plan ahead our purchases :)

there will be no "grinding things out" and tested and spun them all for a while and glued them shut.  some might not pass the bldc test and its because of how thick the grease is in the bearings.  can spin them in the vesc live data recording and watch its erpm go up on the same current as they loosened up. **_thats fine though and ive run in bldc or foc while not passing the bldc test._maybe do the test weeks or months down the road as well to adjust** theres some 7mm .4mm screens coming that fit grooves for the outside of the motor and also 12mm coming was going on the inside of the motor.  squeeze them into the holes on the inside of the motor where its probably worth putting them.  maybe  w glue.  someone got beach sand with iron all up in one but ive never had a problem.
  i'll put some phase wires on tomorrow morning and pm me if you want red and otherwise ill assume black.  ok honestly this is totally doable everyday can get out five if not more.  @Winfly came over and was a huge help again and took the pics!  we had to hold some back for simple reasons. tomorrow.

ill add the tracking on the google doc

after having two packages of vescs disappear even with usps priority im getting everything insured for an additonal 400$ on top of the 50$ priority shipping comes with so please pay me for that cost of 5.65$.    if you dont pay it you wont get the insurance and think its worth it.  i wrapped the crap out of the boxes with tape this time.

will get a bunch more out tomorrow and continuing forward daily.  kinks being worked out

bunch of little hurdles to go for a lot more to go out tomorrow.  phase wires take forever and other little things.

its a pretty small hole to begin with at maybe 5mm and a print inserting into it would practically fill it i think.   i can send the 12mm screens to you and you can figure what you want .  maybe a spot of glue.   but the little screens that go on the outside of the motor arent going to work.  too risky and they will fall into the motor.

ill repeat it repeatedly but i didnt add shrinkwrap.  i did add phase wires.   do put on a couple layers of shrink so it becomes stiff and doesnt become a spot of flexing.  the silicone coming out of the motor is more rigid than the wires and thats a start but do the shrink over that silicone all the way up to the motor.  the phase wires have shown to be the biggest potential point of failure

the only bells i have left are also nickel plated and can turn those matte too.  im just making sure one more time that it wont alter the tolerances and talked to a finishing place and no reason not to do it.  couldnt find anything on the web about aging nickel with heat.  so i'll assume you want both that way.  i only have a couple left that are shiny and then will do the matte.  and the stainless nut in the middle turns a really nice purple red if you catch it before going black

First off, have no intention of coming on to your thread and bad mouthing you in any way, am amazed at the quality of hubs you have created here dude....Seriously! Props!

Will also say, the only reason for me coming onto this forum is to watch your progress. Love what you are building, and want to see it succeed! When am done building my business, and funds are available, you can bet I will be a customer of yours if your venture succeeds. 

With that said, wanted to give some constructive criticism, and while bias and without all the facts you may do well to seriously think about this, whether am wrong or right, if you are really going to consider expanding and taking on more customers down the road with a kickstarter campaign. 

Have watched you progress from the very beginning with your hub motors, way back before anyone was really doing it, and aside from your great dedication to quality, there is one thing that is really apparent in it all, and that is, you are ‘seemingly’ not a businessman. You are honest, and that is indeed respectable, but someone who should run a business, don’t think that is your forte.

Maybe am way off base, and perhaps this impression is simply the result of your working part/full time teaching, and being too sidetracked with other priorities. Whether that is truly the case or not, hiring someone full-time who has run a successful business before, to take on this project with you, should be your number one priority after full filling your current customers orders. Ideally someone as passionate and dedicated, to seeing this incredibly high quality product in your loyal customers hands down the road as you are, without any unnecessary hang-ups along the way. 

Feel strongly that with some professional support, you could easily corner the market with the current product you have created here, but you owe it to your potential customers, to do business effectively, otherwise it wont matter how good your product is, you will just create stress in your life and your customers, which is not good for business.

Either way, wish you nothing but the best!

with respect,
Scott

Dealing with delays is just kind of part of the esk8 game. Every single high quality innovative product I have ordered(raptor 2, Hummie Hubs, Carvon Drives) has been significantly delayed. It's not like Hummie is the only person dealing with timeline setbacks. I personally love how he is focused on making quality products. He could of sold us all subpar stuff a while ago but he ate a lot of cost creating an amazing motor. Worth the wait in my opinion.

thanks for your thoughts Scott and youre right on the nose with that assessment and i hate business.    money hasn't been the motivation for getting these done and im sure im losing money up till this point and im fine with that and it's the cost of getting what i wanted.  i now have the motors I want.  Im interested in eskate not business.  I'd like to believe with a good product and a good rep and a cool video that's all that should be necessary for a business to succeed in 2018. 

all of you custys I owe a huge thanks and words are empty and instead I'll just be getting you your motors and if you have any problems or anything hit on me and i'll be keeping extra motors just in case.

“I’d like to believe with a good product and a good rep and a cool video that’s all that should be necessary for a business to succeed in 2018.”

In a perfect world. 

Now that you have what you want, and it sounds like you have a little interest in a successful business, as stated above, do yourself a favour and get some legit, dependable and professional help. You will save yourself a lot of headaches.   

You hate business, but love making shit...find someone who loves business and hates making shit. This will give you the freedom to carry on as you are to some extent, except you wouldnt have to worry about taking orders, shipping, customer service, business logistics, margins, etc. You can just focus on r&d and making videos for marketing, you know, the fun stuff.

The beauty about everything you have done the last few years, is that you have a physical, working, sellable product in your hands, right now! That is arguably the biggest part of it all, now you just need someone to help you fine tune the process to get them out the door efficiently, and ideally with a little scratch in your pocket....which you can choose to put back into the business to keep making shit you want. It is a good business model, since the shit you want, others want too.

I've been saying this for over a year now. But John wants to do things his own way. It's a big part of why I struggle to work with him. Marketing is apparently bullshit, what do they know that we don't? And business wise... Who needs paperwork? I've been trying to get business people involved with John from the beginning but it always end in an argument that goes no wheres. These motors are a potential cash cow. They could easily become the new standard for complete boards. But John is in it for the fun, not the money. The problem with that is, if you don't profit, how will you ever keep going? Where's the money now for the next batch? He barely has enough parts to finish this batch...

I tried being that. John doesn't like anyone telling him how to do anything, including how to run the business.

Been saying that since we got the first motor working.

In the end, John has a lot of potential with these. But I get frustrated working with him. Today, I'll tell him we should do this. Tomorrow, we do that. The day after that, he says "what have you done to improve these motors?". He forgets the x, y and z suggestions I made 2 days before. Tells me he doesn't want to be told what to do, and that's the end of that.

I love John as a friend. He's great at being a friend with similar interests and a desire and passion to build cool electric shit. But on the business side, he's not an easy business partner to work with.

A big reason I left this industry business wise was because I've poured over 5k personally into the development of these motors, and way too many hours to even count. I wanted a formal business, John did not. When John gets upset, he attempts to do everything he can to hurt you. He did that to me by trying to say I've contributed nothing to these motors. I put too much pressure on him to formalize the business, to where it was no longer fun for him to build motors. It's hard to create a business with someone who doesn't want a business.

I know you'll get mad I'm saying this John, but it's time you grow up and form a proper business. These motors are a huge deal. People are making millions in china off of far shitter hub motors. You could be that person.

From my perspective I respect @Hummie for this, it's a very zen approach. 

The fact is I've built enough boards and experimented with enough hardware that I could build a board a day with 400 to 800 bucks profit but why the fuck would I do that?

This is my fun, how I put up with all the bullshit from my day job, what keeps me at my desk when I wanna say fuck it and tear down the walls. 

Make that another job, no way. I'm good just the way it is. 

Making badass lightning powered murder boards for the shear joy and terror of it. Helping other peeps risk their lives in the name of a rush and the beauty of stupid crazy speeds.

Yeah, I'm good 🤘!

And that's just it. I respect John for what he's done and is doing. He's literally hooking the community up wit the boards and hub motors and now esc's.

The question is, business or hobby? I think John wants it to be more of a hobby, rather than a business.

Which is fine. At the end of the day, he's put in at least 80% of the work to get these motors made. John works better doing John, by him self. It's his passion that pushed him to get this far.

Was not my intention to spark personal issues with this post.

As far as it all goes, will only say that it takes two to tango (good or bad) and there is a dance partner out there for everyone, in life and business.

Personally would be dissapointed to see this product not backed by a legit business, and would be the one thing holding me back from buying. Like supporting the little guy/hobbiest as much as the next guy, but these days would rather pay more for certain assurances/insurances/proof of competences. Customer and seller both deserve a certain amount of protection when hard earned dollars are involved. 

Look at it this way...2 years down the road and these hub motors are in the hands of a few hundred people, and something happens to Hummie....who/what will support the customer? And vice versa, 2 years down the road, something happens due to faulty manufacturing and someone seriously hurts themselves or worse and legal action is taken....who/what will support hummie?

i swear can pop these out for sure today..its 2am now but come ..10am...im on it...i will get that pic of many all together!  
really liking the look of these grilled parts!  havent gotten to these yet and have a lot of the bright nickel already done.  me i think the grey and purple nut is the bomb.  but..just thinking it would be fantastic if could electroplate them to build an interference fit on all the mating parts, the shaft and bearing housing.  i got nickel ingots and planed to do it and have the hook up i made from a computer power supply i used to etch but havent gotten around to it.  and then could press all the parts together instead of using retaining fluid.   .![IMG_7988|666x500](upload://soJk0AqqngnQOHlUPQZXtUTmpeX.JPG)!

the vesc is the greatest thing to happen to eskate in my mind and before to get an esc that could do foc would cost 450$ the cheapest I saw, from germany,  and didnt have nearly the small size and features.

Hummie your hubs are absolutely fantastic and since I am a fan of hubs I will probably join your Kickstarter campaing, although I am in EU and the shipping/custom will kill me :tired_face: Anyhow I am searching information about how to make DIY urethane wheels and since you succeed in doing it, I was wondering whether you don't mind to share a "how to do guide" about it. I know the basic principle, but I am sure that any situation requires its own tricks. I would like to cast new wheel for the hub motor I am using, bigger diameter ecc... Of course not now that you are overloaded with work, but maybe in the future. I am sure others will like to read about it. Thx!!!

Got a moment.  For sure will have a bunch more sets done tonight beyond the bunch I had done n hadn’t sent yet.  Give me till tonight and you’ll see!  And off work the next couple days n for sure will have all USA orders done this week. 

Wheel or tire pouring I used to get pu from bjb enterprises and @Pylonflyer works there.  It’s better stuff than you’ll get at smoothon.com. But it’s room temp two part stuff n doesn’t have the strength n rebound of hot pour stuff, which is also hard to get as a regular consumer n a lot more involved in making as its waxes and takes a huge amount of time to process. Bjbenterprises stuff is pretty good though. In just suilicone molds. 2 part mold and if u vacuum it that’s best.

I see. So basically you make a mold let say with a 3D pinter and then you poor your 2 components inside, then you use vacuum to remove air bubbles. Is it right?
How do you know which duro are you getting?
Is the color based on a dye you mix with?
Are they temp resistance? 
Could you show the vacuum part? I am not getting how you vacuum it.

3D print part and easiest is make a silicone mold w the print and then pour into silicone mold. U can make a 3D printed mold but hard to work w as so rigid and u need to cover w wax n mold release so won’t stick. Silicone molds are nice to work with. 
I’ll post pics of my old molds tonight. They sit around and don’t pour them anymore. Don’t want to trash them as saw u can grind them up and throw the powder in new liquid silicone and is good just not quite the detail in new molds. I’ve got like ten lbs of silicone. I mostly throw them down the street to watch them bounce or a doorstop.  It feels and moves like a body and when I bump them I react like I kicked a cat or someone by mistake.
I’ll explain more mold stuff later ... I’ll do a quick video w my new phone later. N show motor states and what need be done there.  You’ll see it’s close to all USA motors done. 
If u do a sleeve the pu sticks very well and just add sleave to mold after thoroughly cleaning w maybe acetone

The magnet diameter is difference between 9 n 10

Different motors will have diff resistance largely based on the bearings and if they are contact bearing seals or high heat grease filled.  All motors are spun on the Vesc tool and work fine in foc (prefered) or bldc.  If ur motors have slow bearings they probably won’t pass the bldc test. It doesn’t matter n will work fine. Do the test miles later and rewrite your results then when the bearings have loosened some.

The bells are baking n then assemble.  It took longer than I thought these last days with having gotten epoxy on the bearing shafts n taking a long time again getting it off. And found out marker comes off with epoxy in the oven n lost labeling and each hub goes w a particular hanger side.  
I for sure can get these out tomorrow w wires and the next two days I’m going for 15 more!  Very doable.

once i make these motors and maybe the couple extra and then done.  whether i make them or get someone else to make them no motors will be made until a kickstarter happens, and money comes or it doesnt.  the expenses really need like 40 thousand.to make everything organized and not pieces here and there. and the tire molds.  i'll be riding and filming and trying to piece it together with anyone who wants to do it.   but i want to do it really quickly too and these days its a fast business maybe and seize the moment.   and like the challenge of getting the motors widespread and tempted to sell cheeeaaaapppp.  

looking for someone who has a street luge deck that takes 3 trucks i could borrow.   ![image|690x456](upload://dpbTgxLebfberHb3jWUTH0bZRl4.jpg)

Thx I saw the molds. So basically I understood correctly you printed your wheels then you use it to make a mold of the outer and inner part that you actually use to make the final wheels. Then
-how do you cut open the mold in order to separate the parts? I see you add some references to the mold in order to out i back together when you poor the wheels. We're those part also included in the 3d printed model of the wheels?
-how do you get the final finish look of the wheels? I mean at the two flat side that correspond to the upper and the lower part of the mold.

Thank you for the explanation

But better full explanation you should get looking on bjbenerprises.com and Troy, @Pylonflyer, made a bunch of short  videos showing the best ways to do everything.  I could ramble on and on but he has good visuals too.

Took time testing them.  I have boxes here to pack them. The ridiculousness is I’m going on a plane to San Diego tomorrow.  Flight at 9am.  These are tested and happy to see them all spin on the live data.  I kick it to 8amps and they run in foc really only doing maybe 2.5 amps on14.8v and they’re 70kv pretty close to that. 
I’ll box them all tonight. If you know a way to get these to a post office tomorrow ..otherwise I’m back Monday. I could maybe leave them somewhere for a pickup.   I’ll look into it.  Going to the post office sucks anyway.

I’m just going down the list except also caustin cause been so long.  Americans. And next week I’m not working and figuring this out and will get them all done next week I think.  Seriously.  If not maybe half a week more.

Ridding his coveted 15 layer wood & carbon board with Centrax wheels. (for those interested in @Hummie's board he has a couple dozen of 'em) ...thick, layered, light and strong deck. Perfect to fit them with his Hummies. Highly recomended!

there are no more parts for more motors.  I still see it as a business success and have something to put on kickstarter and want to do that really soon so hopefully you get some motors through kickstarter and I think they will actually be able to be made really quickly with real manufacturers not just me and friends twiddling slowly 
I plan to be very busy this week and probably going into next I think I should be able to have everything done and out.  and then i'll just ride around and get video and see what video you guys possibly make.  if you make a nice video...I have a bunch of centrax wheels and have to come up with some kinda incentive.  I don't even know how long the videos need to be but if you help Im more interested in getting videos made than sitting on like 100 centrax wheels I had to buy to get them to make those wheels again.

It's 20 KHz by default, you can easily go up to 30 KHz and all the sound is gone. Ok, almost gone, but you really need to pay attention to hear, never had the balls to increase more than that, anyone volunteer?

I've run my maytech 4.12 at 30khz for some time in the past (about 1month). But I chickened out and switched back to 25kzh. 

It worked flawlessly at 30khz though. 

My drv's are cooled with the same heatsink that cools the Fet's so im not sure if that affects it. 

A higher switching freq. should increase Fet temps by a little bit and Drv temps too....

More commutation per wheel revolution. Like 3 to 1 ratio if bithbtypical 12 tooth w 14 mags.  But that’s commutations n maybe the frequency were talking about is in each commutation.  Even then a hub would have 3x the time to complete the pwm forming of the effective voltage.  I think the hub should be much easier on esc. So said vedder

One thing in the fundamental frequency, other is the switching one

On hubs the fundamental is lower, but the switching is whatever you set, 30 KHz in this case. This 30 KHz is used to form a sine wave, through PWM, of the ERPM your motor is currently running

Motors are just over 70kv.  U can run them on the bldc tool live data and look at the voltage n the erpm.  Devide the erpm by 7 and divide by the voltage and then at 95% of kv as Vesc only goes to 95%...which is a loss of efficiency I believe as at 100% duty cycle there’s no switching losses

Thanks hummie, just got these looks great. Will need to solder phase lead bullets and be good.

If anyone gets there first and has some suggested vesc settings that they tuned  to work best, please share base config. If I remember, depending on bearing choice, these may not turn enough to do motor detect until used for awhile. Early folks  finding that to be the case as well?

For japanese bearing. they work fine out of the box. I'm using 60/-60 motor amp on regular mode, and 100 when I want to race.
For regular bearing. they are packed with grease and I have heard  that they cog in FOC. once you have enough miles on them it should be fine. or you can just put them on a bench and just a run for a while to loosen that grease.

Both hummie and I run 120 motor amps. You can run as high as your esc can do honestly (which is 120 for vesc based escs). I feel safe saying these can def do 1500 watts con without heat issues and 2000+ watts peak per motor.

120 gives one hell of a kick. Battery amps, the high the better also. Hummie was running 2x focboxes with them and had the same battery amps in 2wd that I had in 4wd and the acceleration was not far off from 4wd (maybe 20% less).

So for 2wd, 120 motor/60 battery per VESC.
And for 4wd, 120 motor/30 battery per VESC.

The reason I limited to 30 battery was because they were 4.12's. Can't wait to get 6.6's running with these.

@hummie would you be able to re-terminate for a delta version & more top speed but less thrust? it would appear using the same current settings, efficiency would be also be greater during full throttle acceleration with the higher kv motor (green line, top left chart - electrical to mechanical conversion efficiency %), since with the same motor current settings and 1/3 the electrical resistance with the delta version, less heat is produced via I^2R=W loss (green line, bottom middle chart - ohmic heating watts 2 motors).

wye 75kv * delta sqrt(3) = 129kv

top speed: ~35mph -> 50mph (yellow line, bottom left chart - vehicle thrust in pounds)
thrust: 81lbs -> 47lbs (yellow line, bottom left chart - vehicle thrust in pounds)
peak copper loss (60a motor current limit): 504w -> 167w (green line, bottom middle chart - ohmic heating watts 2 motors)

I think the motor efficiency would be the same but the overall system efficiency would be lower with the higher kv as the esc will have more losses as it’ll have more current needed through it. 
But the motors are terminated wye inside the motor already and you can’t change them back to delta.  If someone wanted delta for maybe a different esc I’d do it but for the vesc the lower kv and higher cell count seems ideal.

Esc will have more loses at lower than 100% duty cycle but the vesc only ever goes to 95% anyway making the difference in kv less important for esc efficiency.  But we’ll do some comparisons sometime.

@Hummie for the same torque you are correct, both motors are the same efficiency & greater esc loss with the higher kv due to more amps required for the same torque-- but for the same motor current through both (not the same torque), the higher kv is more efficient in the motor, due to the significantly lower copper loss with 1/3 motor electrical resisitance via I^2R=W loss.

right but imagine a series of stop signs (never constant speed), where you are either accelerating full throttle with the same motor current settings on both (60a) or coasting... the higher kv gets more range (significantly less heat generated in the motor) but won't accelerate as quickly.

Also, man, for everyone that ordered the these hubs, you HAVE to run 12s. It has so much torque and I feel like I hit top speed too fast. I need that 5mph speed boost and a second or more acceleration.

These are the best PU man, hitting 100 miles and still dont see a dent on then. they have sharp edges and coreless. im surprised how well they hold together. (well I was there sleeving them onto the CAN, and I guarantee for some of them, it took my whole weight to push them down.)

im learing as I go and realizing that if the motor is especially tight to spin in your hand it can be the big bearing could be suffering from compression and when the final c-clip is snapped on, if its needed to be done with pressure, then the two bearing races can be pressed out of alignment and there's a big drag on the bearing.    But its hard to tell if it's this is possibly the case with a tight feeling motor because there's the thick grease I go on about and also the motor has a magnetic cogging when unpowered so has a resistance in your hand and you cant distinguish between what is what.   its an easy enough fix and the c clip can be replaced by me with a slightly thinner one.  its hard to tell but if your big bearing goes bad early on that's the problem and send it to me and i'll get it as should be
the magnetic cogging of the motor that happens when coasting, if I get the bucks I'll definitely be getting a custom stator made to get rid of it.
luckily no motors have been sent far yet and figured this out.  I can check all the parts before assembling the magnets and make sure in the future.

Neither side press fit and uses retaining fluid. But the support on the big bearing’s side can be compressed when the final c clip is installed. And won’t run smoothly and will likely kink out early too 

I’d like press fits maybe on both sides of both bearings. Kind of a bitch to assemble then but when it’s figured correctly figure would be ideal for such loads

Yea I used to use c3 internal clearance with all bearings locked down on the old small motors n it was good even at temps up to 200f. At 200f the bearing grease would start drying up over repeated runs and that would tighten up but even then didn’t notice locking up from axial pressure and was after repeated runs.  These motors run much cooler too

But if u got motors n think that one or two is tight run them anyway and test temp n feel them by hand for resistance  and also try the bldc live data and get the current draw at some fixed speed (maybe 12s) and also the erpm.  I did these things before n be good to see how it they fair and we can figure and then after send them back n I’ll put in another bearing n set it straight n send back no charge.  It’s just like maybe 2 or 3 if u I figure.

been working all day and will from now till these are done.  ridiculous problems.  vacuuming in the epoxy into the windings isometimes gets into the threading or on the bearing seats and takes a long time to get it off.  ive tried multiple types of tape that can sustain the 300f in the oven, oil clay, silicone parts made from 3d prints...and im back to layers of Kapton tape.  the stators bakes for 4 hours at 300f and is amazingly strong.  been spending the whole day recovering from another huge epoxy ingression in the last stator bake.  haven't come up with a good way to seal bearing seats and the threading in the middle and still go through the vacuum and heat.

I can test the fit on every bell before assembling with the magnets and pair up the long and long and short and short so the bearings are running with their races opposite each other.   worst case need to grind down a c clip a bit.  its the difference between having lateral play or bearing compression.  ive seen no bearing play on any of them but that tightness going the other way.

but will get about 10 sets done by tomorrow night regardless

And I do too but with front wheel drive rode so much nicer. All the same except that and huge difference somehow. To each their own but you guys have to at least try it. I think can be switched on the bldc tool instead of phase wires

I will give it a try....sounds interesting. I really like how the deck feels underfoot.... also does changing motor amps to 100 vs 60 and keeping battery amps at 60 change anything?  I saw you recommended but not clear on how motor amps and battery amps interact?

@ksfacinelli here is a comparison of 60a vs 100a motor current limit (both 60a battery current limit @ 46v) 

notice the thrust jumps from 81lbs to 136lbs (yellow line, bottom left chart -- vehicle thrust pounds 2 motors)

full throttle ohmic heating jumps from 252w to 700w per motor (blue line, bottom middle chart -- ohmic heating watts 1 motor).

@professor_shartsis does your chart have the capability to set the motor current as equal to the needed current for just overcome the drag? I would like to see how these hubs work only cruising in a flat surface with no acceleration

When using full throttle they seem to be crazy inefficient, but that condition only last a few seconds when ridding, só they would heat much less when just doing enough work to overcome air resistance

@Pedrodemio According to my calculations it takes 676w electrical & 666w mechanical to maintain 30mph, no acceleration. That comes out to 11.1lbs thrust, 98.6% electrical to mechanical conversion efficiency, 22.53 watt hours per mile, 13.99 watt hours per km, 14.6a system battery amps @ 46v, 8.2a motor current per motor and ~4.7w per motor of ohmic heating factoring wind resistance & copper loss but ignoring iron loss, esc loss, battery loss and rolling resistance at constant 30mph.

it was slow after having that problem cleaning up the vacuumed and then baked in resin but these are almost done.  just waiting on phase wires which I think I have to put on.  
and glue magnets in and waiting for leads to come I just order off amazon.quick shipping.  thought they'd be done by now.  but get better each time and the bearings are all smooth and easy

I figured I can get prices for shipping online based on weight.  ..i'll get the weight and post it here in a min and get shipping prices for the next sets im sending..as soon as these phase wires get here.  and I should have more done by then too to go out.  i'll get all your shipping costs and message you all tonight

Here is a quick spin up video of @Hummie hubs on bench. The setup is using 10s4p @psychotiller battery and setup Focboxs with FOC. Have not got them on road yet due to rain however even the short time during setup as seemed to loosen the grease in the bearings. I am also running at a switching frequency of 30 kHz and 100 amp max motor current and 60 amp max battery.  I think they are pretty quite no high pitch noise but you be the judge.  Would love to here from others regarding setups.

They sound pretty good. Similar to other hub motors and carvon. On the road all you hear is a light hum sound with these type of motors is my experience. 

I guess they’ll start to free roll more after some use. 

Also you have a red line on your wheel. I’m pretty sure it’s red. I double checked.

One thing with Hummie is that you're better off waiting until he drops the info at once than to ask in anticipation. Things will always change and he will always act accordingly, so the info you may have at one point may not be the same info in the end. Especially when hes under pressure to get all the motors out and scrap up everything needed to make the kick starter work. 

You guys want hummie hubs ? Save up a good $800 and wait.

Not that im saying it will be $800 but it's better to oversave then undersave

@Hummie I have battery limit set at 45 amps and motor limit set at 20 per motor.  They've been running a bit hot and don't want to risk burning them up.  You said previously 12S 60 amps works well and think i'll give that a go but if people are running 12S with more than 60 amps i'd like to give that a go if it's safe.

when you say 12s in that context confuses me.  but you should get a cheap hobbyking infrared thermometer and make sure it works and see what temps they get to.  good to know.  if you were around id let you borrow one.  
maybe 45 battery amps is high for your battery don't know it but sounds good.

I didn't do it for all of you but it would be an easy upgrade to get that bike tool for 10 bucks and take the motors off the hanger and scrape the paint off the hanger where it contacts and add thermal paste.  i'll be doing it! but temps are good for me at 150lbs in san Francisco hill hunting.  if youre heavier at some point there's limits.   the limit being the rubber or your bearing grease if you have those ntn bearings.  other bearings do like 300f I think.  the thick grease bearings.  NTN bearings are 200f I believe but more so the rubber has always been the weakest link and this time, counter direction, and there is no core to the tire.  id been doing cores and they were needed but not this time with this great rubber and hope to hear what you think and how it goes at different temps

New urethane is really nice, but unfortunately these suffer from the same flaws as other hubs with axle bending being an issue. I'm not really heavy at 175lb either. Didn't take a hard hit or anything. I just looked down and saw the wheel looked weird while riding, picked it up and saw this...

surprising since it's supposed to be 12mm axle instead of the usual 8mm. though bending seems safer than breaking... i think some of the other hub motor axle failures were snapping more like twigs. @slerm it would be interesting to see how the axle looks with the motor removed...

Ugh. 4140 steel

“Hi John,

I asked our production and they response is:4140 Steel Axle HR42-45(i don't well understand the steel,can you understand it?)”

Not the strongest stuff but commonly used as axles and I knew they were using it.   especially with the diameter of 12mm or maybe even 11.5 with the threading I’m surprised. I’m seeing if can get some harder axles made now cast in the same hanger.  See how long it takes.   Didn’t think that could happen.

use the hangers that I have already and if you bend it i'll give you another until I have the new hangers with a stronger axle.  but i'll get ahold of them tonight and see the time on them getting them done.  I have many of these softer ones in the meantime and they've shown good with everyone else so far.  As was said the axle being a less hardened steel it will be prone to bending not snapping so I think its not a problem going this route and @slerm ill send you two of the 12mm hangers.

Might depend how tight the hubs are pressed against the aluminum of the trucks also, some of that bending load can be transferred to the aluminum of the hangar if tightened properly, but I can't see how the hubs are secured to the axle in the images I've scrolled through.

the motor/stator tube is screwed onto the threaded 12mm axle, then a reverse threaded nut screws onto a thinner gauge threaded axle-end through the middle of the motor to prevent the motor from unscrewing itself, similar to how a cog is attached on a fixed gear bicycle.

Sounds unlikely this self-loosened then. Stil, it could be one possible reason that his may have bent when others haven't experienced issues. Hopefully it's an isolated incident. I agree that a 12mm steel shaft sounds plenty strong, the danger of going with another harder steel alloy is they tend to fracture instead of bending.

[/quote]

I'm doubtful.

I've done bend tests on 12mm 4041 alloy steel rods in the past, to test fab strength in headers. To have exact numbers we need to know if its cold draw or hot rolled but it has a tensile strength of somewhere between 90k and 95k psi.

Also, the fatigue strength, abrasion and impact resistance is far above other conventional alloys. 

4041 steel has to reach 315º C before strength is compromised. At those temps the rider would be in the middle of a frikkin inferno, so in gonna say heat was definitely not the issue. 

I think it's safe to say either composition is corrupted (highly unlikely as it's more expensive to make shit steel than to make good steel because of manufacturing requirements and tooling) or something extreme happened to the axe to cause the bend.

 No expert on material strength but I've picked up a few things working as an engineer in manufacturing for a couple of decades. I can ask a materials engineer if you think it'll help @Hummie.

another glue surprise slowed things and this time it was baking the magnets at a bit higher temp maybe caused it and warped the nylon spacers between the magnets.

Damn hummie. Took the motors out for a test ride on a spare 10s4p with duct tape and zipties and no griptape. Plenty of balls even with 60 motor 30 battery. Low low ride with the double drop and 83mm wheels. Got some kissing of wheels on the deck, but the trucks were uber loose.

This is gonna be fun.

I keep adding more stuff to my plans, and have some setbacks, so it'll take a few more sessions to get it all done.

If you lay focbox right up against the edge of the cavity, the phase wires sit a little too low. I was going to lift up the focboxes so the wires clear the wall, and remembered deckoz's build.

I would not bother with an XRF.
You are not trying to do a PMI here.
Strength in 4140 comes also from carbon (which normal XRFs can't detect as it is non metallic) not to mention heat treatment.

Of course there is always the chance that somebody mixed the 4140 rod with something else (mild steel etc) in which case the XRF would detect that. Maybe a PMI is not such a bad idea after all.

If I looked at the board without knowing any thing I would think one of the following:
1. Someone stood directly on top of the trucks (with the deck attached of course, haha) and constantly jumped up and down to test the strength. 
2. The board had some flight time and landed with a thud with the person's weight on top
3. Structural defect in shaft: micro-fractures/air pockets inside.

I am not a mechanical engineer or anything, so probably don't know what I am talking about.

Only one axle is bent. He could’ve just hit a rock at speed. Wouldn’t feel like much more than a bump, but could do damage. 
Say he hit a rock and it angled the truck, The normal force would be directed to the leading edges rather than distributed = greater torque applied. 
In addition, you’re moving at some velocity so when you initially hit a pebble, it will prob apply force in some direction directed towards axle at some angle to ground. So you have normal force and the x component of that acting towards back of board. So resultant would be greater than normal, acting at angle above ground, AND applied at the edge.
Idk difference in strength between 8-12mm. I’d assume they would’ve calculated to cover this scenario. 
Disclaimer: With limited self taught physics background, I could be way off.
And if I am, please correct. That’s Part of teaching myself. Haha

Its interesting to see that despite the larger spec 12mm axle for this new generation that it has failed though the failure is a bend this time and not a fracture.

From memory the past failure was possibly down to cutting of the truck in vicinity to the axle?

I’m here on it and for these 5 sets it was a slowdown w the glue fuckup as I said.  I’ll get the postage costs at least figured by tonight n out tomorrow.  They’ll all be done in a couple hours and I’ll pack them up n get a pic up with address on them tonight. 
Neeext batch I won’t fuck it up w the glue. I don’t want to use metal magnet placers/shims with an obsession about reducing eddy currents but it’s super minor n will use them next batch unless anyone has another non-conductive non-warping material at 250f. Used all kinds of print materials n it’s no good n too thin at like 1.3mm. Nylon fishing like warps unfortunately and kicks up the glue while still curing at a hair over 250f I found.


Totally on schedule to get these all done this week.  I’m not working this week again n on it over full time

Found magnetism sneaks out of the bell if the magnets aren’t lined up ironically right in front of the gaps between teeth on the outside.  After looking at a magnetic simulation even a 1mm thick mild steel wall would contain like 98% of the field. J and b magnet tools.  But it makes a big difference and if not in position with the gap behind I can stick iron to the outside. Not so if in position. Counter intuitive that u want the thick back iron on the sides of the magnet for best field reflection.  People’s outrunners have a thin back iron at maybe 1mm thick max and probably for use in light weight plans as if the iron were thicker behind the magnets ...could ultimately have stronger magnetic strength from the magnet side and then can compensate on the winding side with less current needed keeping cooler generally. That’s why it has 14 teeth on the outside for the 14 magnets

 I'm still in disbelief that a truck bent. I have pushed these pretty hard, and I've always manage to find failures that no one else has had in past versions. The fact I've had zero issues with these makes me surprised.

I guess the easy solution is to use a stronger steel. I guess if it had to be done in the future, there is more space for an even larger axle. I think we could do a 16mm even with no issues.

Now that I’ve got a great way to protect with painted silicone I’m getting close to done with all the motors. The last couple I swear I’m waiting till then and get those myself as I will know how to put them together by then. 
This saved like 12 hours of fighting w crazy strong glue. Kapton tape doesn’t work. Silicone caps custom made nope. Some other high heat tapes. Epic resin I asked and they didn’t have any ideas. Silicone is the shit. Stripped the motor leads too early here u can see. Next time

So you apply the silicone in the bearing seats and then dip in resin and bake?

paint on silicone, sink in pot of resin in a vacuum chamber, then bake.  supposedly air bubbles trapped in the windings, if you were to just dip the stators in the resin, get hotter.

the dip also ironically helps transfer heat off the windings instead of trapping it to the windings.  It transfers it to the stator steel and from there somewhere hopefully

theres nothing you can do to make them go faster than running higher voltage.  12s or maybe go 16s with another controller if you need the speed.   I was maxing out at around 32mph with 12s.    maybe you just need a better aero tuck.  maybe you need to lay down on the board.

Thought I’d do a big glue-up n motor bake today but no glue!!  But found it locally here in sf so will happen tomorrow.  Only so long I can be slow before someone tells me I’m full of shit. Tomorrow.  
Anyone who wants to come to the big motor bake meat pies and drinks will be served.

One thing for sure, having threads is really bad for fatigue due to the high stress concentration, maybe make the threads shorter and away from the hanger, the point in bent is the section that has the maximum moment, not having threads there would help a lot

I finally got my hubs placed in my latest build, and one side keeps failing BLDC motor detection. I got it to succeed after 5 or 6 attempts, but should I be concerned? Do I just need to ride them a bit to loosen them up and then do detection again? Any advice?

Hmm in  my understanding of solid mechanics (which isn't perfect) I think that stress concentrations are much more critical to avoid during fracturing events. Since fracturing is kind of a probabilistic phenomenon in such materials. The main concern with threading is it decreasing the cross sectional area and the material thickness 
(which gets raised to the fourth power in bending) obviously this can be described as a stress concentration so I'm not saying you're wrong :smile:. But I think going from 12->14mm will make a huge difference. Lets say the threading takes 1mm off the total diameter we can do some dimensional analysis:

(13mm^4)/(11mm^4)  =  1.95

So the trucks would be roughly twice as strong in bending. My guess is this particular unit just so happened to be the lower end of the bell curve on steel quality. Good to protect against that though.

Unfortunately is not so simple

You always have to take in account the static case and considering fatigue. For the simple static loading your thinking almost right, you use an average area between the top and root of the thread

However when dealing with fatigue threads is the worst stress concentration you have, I have to look on the tables, but for a 12mm axle it will be something around 3, so if you take and do the math for bending, the stress on the threaded part will be 3 times that

That’s why I said that making the thread stop before the hanger body will help so much, maybe 10 or 20mm earlier 

It makes no change get a better material if the reason of the failure is not it

Hm true I hadn't considered fatigue during dynamic vibrations, definitely a valid concern. Still isn't fatigue failure somewhat of a different look from the bending failure we are seeing here? In theory fatigue should work harden the part until it fractures correct? Definitely agree that if stopping the thread doesn't effect the application then it should be done as it will only add strength.

It really depends, it could be a low cycle fatigue failure, but no matter what it is, the thread had a key role in it

A good way to know is to apply penetrating fluid, don't know if that is the exact name in english, but it changes color if it manages to enter micro cracks on the surface

We will see.  I’d like to think the 14mm axle of 4140 would do. Seems crazy that it wouldn’t. Down to 12.4 (I think I found on the web easy) in the thread.   

So we have another thing to test other than the rubber.  I do have many of the hanger I can send as I said if u do bend it.   I’m assuming bending isn’t deadly. The idea of a stress point in the thread makes me think of what would happen more w a fracture than a bend.  No?


And youre like “where the fuck are my motors and stop this blabbing”. Tomorrow I found glue locally and get u a good pic of at least almost all done by tomorrow night and sent Tuesday.  I’m calling it.

More or less bent vertically, and ever so slightly back.

Like I said in OP it is hard to pinpoint when it happened. I noticed the board felt weird when carving, looked down, realized something was wrong, and stopped.

I got curious and did a little simulation between fully threaded, partially not-threaded and partially threaded, comparing between 12mm and 14mm axles for each, with 4142 steel under 500 lbs-force load. Here are the results... it looks to me like threading plays a large part in losing strength... for example the fully threaded 14mm axle is pretty much equal in strength to the 12mm partially threaded. 

Keep in mind that the results shown are visually exaggerated for visibility, the max displacement on the weakest axle was ~1.5mm total for reference under the 500 lbs-force load.

Krayden is getting back to me..im going to call again.  at worst they have it coming wed to them and then to me from them in texas Id express ship.  maybe even over night!  fuck I want to be done already.  prepped the area!  and then found the glue is pretty much done.  I've got like 5 sets here and will send them as replacements to 3 people who sent back to get the bearings redone.  Im doing this because I still haven't gotten the tools to remove the bearings.  ill order those today.     I've got 15 sets and 10 without glued bells.  got the paris trucks in...have everything but the glue.  but calling them and seeing if there's a good substitute the might have, maybe something even better is out there now.

and i'll figure everyone's shipping costs and get everything else done till then.  I mean tonight I will actually post up the costs here.   hope no one has a problem with that.  and then just going down the list will send those other two sets out.  now.  going doing.

@Smithster I typically don't like this whole running over something with a car marketing ploy. In this instance and eskating as a whole, we dont just experience downward force, there are a lot of variables. For instance smooth concrete vs tarmac or asphalt roads.. on the asphalt u will experience bumps and vibrations with would act like an impact driver on a seized bolt. 

Lets say you're trying to break lug nuts on ur car to change a tire and its seized, you can stand on the tire iron and nothing happens, but u start bouncing and it breaks the lug... vibrations will kill anything

@Chase here did do the test on the axle and it's mild steel not 4140.  very low chromium and no molydenum  

https://www.makeitfrom.com/compare/SAE-AISI-1020-S20C-G10200-Carbon-Steel/SAE-AISI-4140-SCM440-G41400-Cr-Mo-Steel




the lighter blue color on the graphs is the hardened material.   a hardened steel isn't possible if cast in the hanger being tempered and softened by the hot aluminum around it when cast.   you could press in a hardened axle but the history of that in the skate world shows some coming loose and that's without the heat and torque of a motor.  machined hangers seem the only other way to get a hardened steel axle.  im still going for a 14mm cast in the hanger with 4140 and will see what the manufacturer has to say about getting that whipped together immediately or possibly casting my own and sand casting is pretty simple and that's how these were made.  but have bigger plans too for another hanger.  


Im sending the motors and this hanger out thinking only one has bent and can replace the bent until new come in.  sent you two @slerm today. 

  so waiting on glue.  talked to the glue guy for hours and its worth waiting on this stuff and unique.  comes in wed and then to me.  in light of resent events im feeling extra repentant and will have all motors done in a nano when the glue arrives

Duuu there’s an easy solution which Dan and Devin brought up and can stay at the 12mm axle just not thread it all the way to the aluminum and then slightly drill out the motor hub at 12mm  where it will butt the aluminum hanger so the point of pretty much all the stress is supported by a true 12mm axle.  So that’s the plan. 

 Getting them to make 40 of the hangers with the 4140 and this different threading hopefully in the near future but for the rest of the motors going out I’ll do this alteration and think it will make a world of a difference.  Nice to hear your ideas guys if anyone has any thoughts on this before they go under the knife.   So will drill the motor hub hole 12mm diameter for maybe on two or three mms.  Two? Three?

(The axle above of course isn’t a match for anything and will thread same thread on there all the way until 3 or 4 mm from the aluminum

@Hummie i wondered... can a pair of your hubs climb the steepest street in san francisco? according to wikipedia that would be the 31.5% (17.5°) slope on filbert street between hyde and leavenworth...

so i set the chart up to show (2) 73kv hub motors with 84mm tires, 100a motor current limit, 60a battery current limit per motor at 46v & 200lb rider + board.

I was surprised to find that the chart suggests you could accelerate up to and sustain 27mph straight up that 31.5% (17.5°) slope. check out where the red line, bottom left chart (vehicle thrust pounds -- 2 motors) dips below the purple line, bottom left chart (31.5% slope + wind drag force pounds) @ ~27mph. does that sound ballpark accurate?

Hey guys. Life got a bit complicated, but found time to move this build forward.

It's 15s A123 (49.5v nominal 54v full). focboxes are stock firmware with
M 60/-60
B 30/-12
switching frequency 30k
57v batt max
130a abs limit


I'm still on stock bushings, so I didn't have the nuts to let it all out. I got to 28mph easy with these settings (200lb). Tons of poke, very good brakes (83mm wheels must help with that).

Some numbers:
53v (down to 50v, sag to 41.1v)
2500w
M 84a
B 59a
40degC max
30wh/mile

I think I'm already happy with this performance! It feels every bit as good as 2x6354 10s4p, accelerating and braking. I have a lot of untapped performance available. This gonna be fun. :)

Things I still need to do:
- riptide bushings (I have them, just gotta swap them in)
- @ackmaniac firmware (thank you man!)
- 100a/-80a motor max
- 50a/-20a batt
- maybe bump the max battery voltage a hair
- maybe bump abs current max a bit
- double check all the erpm settings
- replace the missing screw on front truck doh!
- wire loom phase wires
- housing for loop key
- charge port


Oh btw the 1/4" aluminum plate for the focboxes were too much. Replaced with 1/8".

I should wait until it's had a few dozen miles but, thanks @hummie amazing stuff! Thanks @pshaw @Deckoz for pushing the voltage barrier.

Why? Better insulation and mechanical separation, will survive some abrasion, less likely to pull out with 3 ganged connections, can't mess up the order of the phases once it's on there.

I bought a few types -- this stuff seems much better than the typical. Somewhat sealed, and much easier/nicer to deal with. Tesa tape or self fusing silicone tape (they throw some in with the loom) to seal the ends.

damn its a slow process but we have the tool, bought one, and doing these starting after work tomorrow.  im working the next couple days but will get it done at night and this weekend and I can take off work starting next week and for sure I really plan to have these out by Monday or Tuesday at the latest.  its been a slow up with realizing the design had a problem, which showed up when @slerm bent one, so can fix that and feel better sending them abroad where it would be harder to get back and modify.   ![image|375x500](upload://r79pX8iMolLDQ5t5xfju65HPcnM.jpeg) 

this way we really are sitting on a 12mm axle with 20mm of length before threading.  2cm from the butt should be more than enough I think and the threading remaining as well.  its all good and a ok advice from machinists.  gets worrisome cutting hubs with the stators and bearings all ready attached and ready to go cant afford to fuck that up.

I was thinking, how are you modifying? Drilling the hubs to accommodate the unthreaded portion and making new axles right? The surface finish of the axle is really important to prevent fatigue failure in the future, a rough surface acts as a seed for the cracks to start forming

Not moving the motors so no increase wheelbite

.  The axle will be left largely as is and smooth.  U think bare 20mm then 10mm thread or 15 n 15?  I was told ten was more than enough threading. And then leaves lots of the bare smooth 12mm axle.

Following up. I did:
- riptide bushings Krank 93a Cone/Canon front, Canon/Magnum rear. I have my balls back :slight_smile: Thanks @Alphamail
 - ackmaniac firmware installed
- wire loom for phase wires
- charge port added lol, and missing screw fixed
- switched to mini remote (the master cho gt2b is for testing stuff)

Gave it a test run, full charge, which for my NOS (new but sitting on seller's shelves for a few years) A123 M1 (2300mah) variant is 52v. About 1 mile down the road and 1 mile back, mostly full throttle (fresh paved yay!). 60/-50 30/-12 one way, 80/-50 40/-12 the other. Finished at 50v, sagged to 45v min.

30mph max. Sigh all my boards are about 29mph max at full charge. I was hoping 15s would get me to 35mph. Maybe the bearings will break in...

Did about 30wh/mile. This will be a bit on the high side I think, as it was full throttle most of the way, and a bit windy. Still, I get 20wh/mile on other setups, so this thing drinks electrons. It should get worse I think when I eventually get to 100a motor 50a battery.

![Screenshot_20181023-141352|281x500](upload://7cmtViRDXkYHPR9K4f9cG7YVmHk.png) 

The ride is plush, but you definitely feel the pebbles and cracks more than 97mm wheels. It's weird. Very plush, then big bump for small cracks, but still plush.

The double drop and the small wheels... It almost feels like I'm stepping down when I get on this board. :)

Brakes still need to be dialed. It's a bit soft at max speed at -12 batt. I'll push it up gradually to probably -20. At slow speeds (going down a steep hill at walking speed), there's an abrupt transition from not quite enough brakes to almost lockup. I reduced motor min from -60 to -50. Will keep tuning.

I did have one glitch, testing high speed full brake to full throttle. I lost thrust for a brief moment, maybe 1 second. I think ABS over current and things like that get a reboot, which takes 3 seconds? So some other glitch. Kind of felt like cogging. No errors logged. Didn't want to try to reproduce it (yet), as I'm running 50v+, and long battery wires.

Oh, focbox remained cool, and motors were warm but not hot.

@Lionpuncher the range will not be excellent. 3.3v * 2.3ah * 30 =  228wh nominal. I usually can't get anything out of the bottom 20-30%, so call it 182wh at 30wh/mile, that's 6 miles! If I get 20wh/mile in more normal riding, 9 miles. If range/weight/size/price is okay for you, the cells are really spanky. They can take a lot of abuse for voltage (I've discharged my first pack to 2v for the whole pack, and it revived no problem. You can overcharge to 4.2v/cell, and they won't like it but they'll take it), and can handle cold weather pretty well. And they can be abused for regen current. I think 10C (23a or 25a if you have the M2 variant) was tested okay in the RC forums. Cycle life is great, 1000 cycles easy if you don't abuse.

Need to add some kind of bumper for the rear truck. I think it rests on the tip of the baseplate when I lean it against the wall.

Thanks @Hummie :slight_smile:

Nice to hear 

I think the motors suck a lot of amps accelerating but on a smooth consistent 25 to 30mph will have to see the current draw and would like to see better efficiency than w a pulley with that

So we’re waiting for me to use this new tool to ream the hubs for the true 12mm axles.  This week!!! Today really.  Small steps waiting for expert advice and tools to show sorry guys this is how it had to go.  But all n all ..for the best.  Not much work to do really in terms of hours at this point.  I had them all done but then last minute with the bent axle realized this change in design is key and even with the mild steel axle (the manu fucked us over with!!) will be no problem.  ![image|375x500](upload://q0Q6iFyEc9iyS1tZEGan25r8uWf.jpeg) 


And know if y sent them back for bearing changes or had some issue I’m sending back with the true 12mm axle and that’s been the hold for u as well.

Bigger lathe the better my machinist friend insists and I’m finding out.  Today will be cutting drill bits to half their size to fit in the back stock chuck to use them.   And he says when big less vibrations and more accuracy, and u can get better accuracy by being able to chuck things closer to the center of the chuck with it’s bigger hole.

absolutely true, I use one that is like 900Kg and you can put more stress on it and be faster and more precise. Although with the small one you can do great stuffs, but you have to go way slower. I would say if you have to make multiple parts in series than go bigger, otherwise a small one is fun too... There are middle size lathe around 300kg that can really work with really low tolerance, but then again the cost rises a lot

Because the motors are almost done w the bearings already on, and removing them will probably damage them, I have to center the part for drilling by holding further and on the stator,the green, and my new lathe is too small and so is the one down the street I use.  So gunna get different jaws or another lathe pronto.  I would grind the jaws down but was told it would be too
Hard.  I also got a drill press a week ago with the same goal but opted for the lathe as soon as I got it and then this, so it’s a learning experience here.  So close. Sorry guys there’s seemingly endless final hurdles.  It’s probs raining ☔️ in Europe now.

Ok then in that case you could easily grind out the portion of each jaw that gets in the way. You could also do that on the lathe but since this is a small hobby lathe it would probably be easier to just grind them. It should not take more the 30' for all 3 jaws to be modified.

I’ll message u today n we can figure it.  But was just talking with someone else waiting.  I know it’s been a long time and seemingly new obstacles show up, but this is it I believe.    

My mini lathe sucks and when I was drilling bare hubs to practice before doing the done motors it was bending off from center.  I’m returning it and getting some other lathe jaws that fit a bigger lathe I can use and get those shipped as soon as possible (I imagine one day from Amazon) and I’ll grind those to fit the motor around the bearing as described above and get it done this weekend.  Done.   If u want to wait.  I would. 

Reminder that while  I had motors made before this is now a new design and I’m making them too so there were hitches that we’re going to show up.  I’m just happy all the hitches are surmountable and the end product still rocks.  I know it’s slow and I have your back guys.  I want u to have what’s best and we’re not cutting corners here.  Give me till this weekend and I look forward to saying done (again) and in a box n out the door

@Powadangaboards an interesting theory... 

[quote="slerm, post:10, topic:27705, full:true"]
I’m 33. Been skateboarding and snowboarding since I was 8. Did both semi-professionally through my teens and early 20s. **I always loved going fast, bombing hills and sliding on a regular skate. Multiple broken bones, dislocated joints, and surgeries later I tend to take it “easy” these days (that’s relative).** I’ve actually never really ridden a longboard since I feel much more comfortable on a normal skate deck where **I can pop the nose up, kick turn etc. All of my e-sk8s have been 31-34" in length. Just more for fun for me, and living in NYC, easier to weave through the chaos and “pop” over cracks and potholes**. Maybe one day I’ll build a proper long board since it’s a pain to fit all the batteries and electronics on a short deck. Or more likely a mountain board since those look like a blast to ride.

This forum always cracks me up. If someone else didn't experience an issue then clearly it was the other person doing something wrong/lying. Come on guys.

Why would I be trying to ollie a 20 lb skateboard? My ankles would hate me. I guess that's why raptor axles are bending too? If there's a kicktail people must be kickflipping down a 10-set, right? Totally logical thought process....

Yes, I pop the nose up to go over cracks, but also deload my weight almost entirely when doing so. That's how you skate.

Take it for what you will. With that said, I'm off to skate a handrail with my esk8

For the record, Hummie sent me replacement hangers right away and I have had no issues since, despite that damn kicktail. Maybe it was a fluke, maybe not. Not trying to shit on the product here. Overall I am super impressed with the performance.

i was looking at the torque force-transfer on those axle threads... 

(60 / (2 * pi * 73kv)) * 100a motor current = 13.08 Nm torque

13.08 newton meters torque (@ 100a motor current)

1000mm/6mm (1/2 of 12mm axle diameter)=166.66 force multiplication factor via leverage

13.08 newton meters (@ 100a motor current) * 166.66 force multiplication = 2179.91 newtons force to the threads

2179.91 newtons * 0.22lbs force per newton = **479.58lbs twisting force to the threads per motor** (!! :woozy_face:)

 **479.58lbs twisting force to the threads per motor** * 2 motors = **959.16lbs twisting force with 2 motors trying to twist the axle in the hanger**

(about **9.59x** more than the normal force per axle on flat ground with a 200lb load) = 200lbs / 4 wheels = **50lbs**

50lbs < **479.58lbs**

sorry if it got you the wrong idea. I was simply just stating that I don't have a kicktail. Errr the fact is yours hanger bent and it could be a poor quality one or the wild steel . Personally I think they are strong the way they are right now, but hummie does have a solution to this potential issue. And it's taking a bit longer than expected to fix. I'm gonna get it upgraded once he's done with lathing the hubs for the EU batch too. That's the perk of living near by I guess.

Not trying to bash on you bro, I have been skating for many of years and I have too broken many of bones and boards, bent plenty of axels on street sessions and on mini ramps. I have never managed to bend an axel on a longboard but then I have always had boards around 39-40 inches that have no kick. I am very tempted to have one truck with the fully threaded axel and one with out just for Testing and see if I have the same results. 

Again apologies bro. Not trying to hate on you, just another skater who maybe typed a message to quick without reading it back before posting.

As has already been mentioned, when it comes to lathes, the bigger the better.
If you have the space you can probably find a bigger used lathe for less money than a new Chinese mini lathe.
Of course when buying used,you have to be able to assess its condition, otherwise stick to new.

[quote="skatardude10, post:1604, topic:25251"]
I got curious and did a little simulation between fully threaded, partially not-threaded and partially threaded, comparing between 12mm and 14mm axles for each, with 4142 steel under 500 lbs-force load. Here are the results… it looks to me like threading plays a large part in losing strength… for example the fully threaded 14mm axle is pretty much equal in strength to the 12mm partially threaded.

Keep in mind that the results shown are visually exaggerated for visibility, the max displacement on the weakest axle was ~1.5mm total for reference under the 500 lbs-force load
[/quote]

https://image.ibb.co/nN6enf/axle.jpg

@skatardude10 what happens if you add ~16Nm cyclical torque spread over the 3cm of the threading closest to the hanger (no unthreaded axle - a.k.a how things are now) vs 1 cm of threads closest to the hanger (w/ 2cm of axle unthreaded)?

(60 / (2 * pi * 73kv)) * 120a motor current = **15.69Nm**

perhaps the torque and leverage forces would be transmitted via a ~83mm outer diameter nut w/ ~80mm depth, with the axle extending from a flat surface to simulate the motor being butted against the truck...

@skatardude10 what about a horizontal thrust force of ~85lbs? 

( 15.69Nm wheel torque * 1000mm) / ((1/2) * 83mm wheel) =  **378.07 newtons**
378.07 newtons * 0.22lbs per newton = **84.99lbs**

i count 4 major forces acting on the axle... the torque from the stator engaging through the threading, the thrust force, 1/4th the static weight of the ~200lb rider, dynamic forces such as from rolling over a pebble (which are partially absorbed by the tire)

Been super busy lately prepping things to go out. By late tonight will be back to having like 12 sets done and another day or two another ten sets and that should be everyone.  Long delays where I’m figuring out what to do or experimenting and after going through it deciding to send them as is and without the earlier mentioned alteration. So the risk is a bent axle but at least we then know the danger as apposed to doing the alteration myself and it’s uncharted territory again related to the torque forces on the axle as written just above.  
So tonight the oven will be filled with bells 🔔 stuffed with magnets that I finished last night and the pressure of my own words is kicking me.  

In light of how long this has taken and my appreciation for all of you helping get this done and your long patience I have extra centrax wheels I’ll be throwing in(2) and extra motor tires (2) .    I’m not trying to sell and make money but more so keep your support so we can get this to roll on Kickstarter and these just sit here anyway and had to buy in bulk

Tonight I’ll post up the photo of the many more done n we can go from there assuring addresses n shipping and another day or two n I’ll be finished putting magnets in the final bells and we can finish this.

Checking in with an update and a bump for this awesome thread.

I've got a few commutes in, with motor 80/-50 and battery 40/-12. Things are running very well
- about 30mph top speed
- 22wh/mile, which puts my range at (15 x 2 x 3.3v x 2.3ah = 227.7wh, 227.7wh / 22w/mile = 10.35) 10.35 miles
- ride is PLUSH. I think the deck has something to do with this too. Not missing 97mm wheels for vibrations.
- the hummie deck mounts the trucks way at the extreme ends, and I think there's a hammock effect that helps with vibrations. The deck is also very wide with a calm concave, comfortable.
- The double drop means not much leverage over the trucks, so I might have to go one softer on the bushings. But Riptide Krank has so far lived up to the promise of big range of adjustability with adjusting the kingpin tightness
- The torque is good enough at motor 80 battery 40. Brakes are a bit soft. Of course I'm gonna go up :) but I want to get some time in at these settings. Motors to get hot, I think more from braking than anything else. One time, too hot to touch for more than a second or two.
- The A123 pack is so far a champ, at 2p giving 40a per focbox. Sometimes focbox overshoots, at least in telemetry. I've seen 45a battery. The cells are old though, so sitting around after charge they settle to about 52v total.
- Not much stuttering at startup. Almost feels like a sensored setup. I miss the BLDC noise :slight_smile:
- freeroll is definitely not good. Hm maybe the heat is from bearings, and not the current?

[/quote]

the higher voltage battery system will do more motor current for the same battery current limit setting at the higher end of the rpm range, because at the higher rpms the power is limited by the battery current setting rather than being limited by the motor current setting as it is at low rpms-- ie higher voltage with the same battery current limit means more motor current is sustained at higher speeds and more peak power...

But the power at the tire has a pretty fixed relationship to the heat put out based on the winding resistance with torque and heat produced. Higher v or less..if anything it’s probably more inefficient w the higher voltage. We've done this question many times here and with simulations but no one has logged and compared. 

The magnets are n48sh good to 300f but the glue strength varies with heat but it seems the best stuff around 

But I’m almost done a lot.  Tomorrow will get six sets out and another 5 in like another day

@deucesdown maybe the bearing was put in wrong and compressing because till recently I was found it wrong n told people to send them back.  If u want to send them I can make sure.

[/quote]


in the motor, the higher voltage battery indeed is less efficient during full throttle acceleration **if** the battery current setting is lower than the motor current setting, because the same battery current limit but with a higher voltage battery at the same rpm results in greater motor current than the lower voltage battery, and heating increases at the square of the motor current while torque increases only linearly with motor current, reducing efficiency.

but if the motor/battery current limit settings are the same value, then during full throttle acceleration the lower/higher voltage systems are equally efficient in the motor, because both systems will have the same motor current during the acceleration, regardless of the battery voltage, but the higher voltage system will have more top speed and peak electrical/mechanical power.

i posted previously how much power it takes to maintain 30mph:

[quote="professor_shartsis, post:1468, topic:25251"]
it takes 676w electrical &amp; 666w mechanical to maintain 30mph, no acceleration. That comes out to 11.1lbs thrust, 98.6% electrical to mechanical conversion efficiency, **22.53 watt hours per mile**, 13.99 watt hours per km, 14.6a system battery amps @ 46v, **8.2a motor current per motor** and ~4.7w per motor of ohmic heating

22wh/mile still makes some sense considering you'll use far more power than average during the accelerations in stop and go traffic while averaging 11-15mph overall compared to going 11-15mph @ constant speed...

maintaining 20mph at constant speed should only take roughly 200w electrical or about 10wh/mile.

15mph constant speed should take about 80w electrical or about 5.33wh/mile

@skatardude10 I suspect when you simulate transmiting all leverage (and torque) forces entirely through an 83mmx77mm nut which is engaged with only the first 3cm of threading that emerges from the hanger, it will show that almost all that force becomes concentrated to mostly the ~1mm of axle or so between the motor and hanger...

https://image.ibb.co/nN6enf/axle.jpg

it's also possible that since the motor is butted against the hanger, it could cause the bending forces applied to the outer edge of the motor to be converted into tension forces in the axle, since the interface between the motor and hanger would act as a lever...

Yea, need to do it though. The idea is simple. So that so inside piece sits and bolts to the motor, instead of the plate bolting to the motor. And then the two pieces join. Though one mistake I see already in the design is I don't see how the 2 pieces are connected. A bolt and nut can't be used since it the motor can will be in the way.Maybe we could thread the inside of the bolt holes as a simple solution. But the idea is there.

Please remember though. You'll likely want a motor closer to 40 kv instead of 80 kv, which is my next project for motors.

Yep, then you just take the bolts off and the whole wheel comes off, easy.

And My plan was to 3d print a piece (that looks like how the cores did) that covers the rest of the motor can. It sorta turns the hummie hub into a direct drive.

At 40 though.  And still the wind resistance will be a factor for sure in people’s top speed depending if standing tall or aero n small even now w these wheels.  What frontal area are u assuming and what weight rider?  I’m sure I could double my wind resistance or halve it by how I stand and it’s the biggest factor at high speed

@Colson003 if you're wondering how much top speed can be increased (to hell w/ acceleration) by merely increasing tire diameter with 2 motors limited to 80a motor current and 60a battery current per motor @46v, i'd say it tops off around 58mph...

An easy way to get it rolling is send me 100$ and I can refund the difference

I think that if the axle was really 4041 steel and the end wasn’t threaded, that these axles would be an over kill. The problem still lies in my mind that they aren’t what they said they were giving us.

I could do an adapter like how the six shooters are, where the adapter comes up over the hub a bit, so it rests on the hub not just those screws.

I am curious to race some of these 4wds that people are putting together now. I think I’m going to end up doing 4x vesc 6s to maximize my performance and reliability. Max them out at 130 motor amps and 60 battery amps each. 12000 watts total.

@deucesdown  I saw the Unity passing 14S stress test and I thought about it, but I feel like the risk of blowing VESC is too high for an extra 2-3 mph. also 14S is not gona fit in my enclosure. I literally only have 3.5" of length for all the wiring, bms, receiver, BT module and 6.6s

@evoheyax yeah that would make the most sense, but i'm still worry about the flywheel adapter snapping since all the load of the 107 will be on it instead of the axle. it's not the strongest geometry.

^ @Hummie  by reducing drag coefficient and frontal area, you can use larger diameter tires to get ever higher speeds (ie street luge will have much lower frontal area and drag coefficient vs standing rider)

Hey John,
Just got the motors yesterday and I have two questions. 
1. Did you put the Japanese bearings in these? The resistance feels about the same as before.
2. How can I rotate the motor? The wires are in a dangerous place. If the truck scrapes the motor will be ruined.

The biggest issue I still see for mass producing these is that every motors wires come out in a different place. So you have to wind the motor for a specific truck so the wires come out in a good place (between the truck and the board). I can't understand why John sent you a motor with the phase wires pointing downward... The only fix is another motor made specifically for that truck.

Or u can sand where the motor contacts the hanger n take it down a bit and then it will spin more and u can adjust the wires that way. All of the motors would benefit from having the hanger aluminum cleaned of paint or adding a bit of thermal paste at the connection. I didn’t do it.  It costs less then 20$ for the tools to take the motors off n on and you can do that.   I’m tired.

So in @Hummie s defense, I was able to flip the hanger to the correct orientation. Wouldn’t go together like that when I originally installed it, but with some gentle finessing with a large sledge hammer(kidding) it worked.
Wires stick out a little still, but this is easy to protect now.

Motors, if I get money to make them.  It will have to be like 30,000$ minimum.  Will have to get it from Kickstarter I guess.  Half of that would just be the making off tire molds and minimum order quantity.

Also got my @hummie hubs back and they are beyond expectations.  I was running yesterday and they are so quiet and free wheel so smooth.  I am running a @psychotiller 12s4p and they have great low end as well as top end have more power than my 10s5p with dual 6374 belt drive.

Overall the wait was well worth the performance @hummie responses quickly to all messages and would purchase again...

Thanks,

They have magnetic cogging still and could roll much easier with another stator.  That’s the next goal. Can get a couple stators custom made epdm method to test.  If these motors could roll as well as a regular wheel that would be the clincher in my mind and design done (yea right)

I’m not interested in putting in sensors unless they show to be more efficient. 

I’ll be filling the holes on the inside of the motors somehow. The screen I got weren’t a good fit and there again is a simple test never done rediculous.  Cover all the holes on one motor with duct tape vs not. I’m gunna cover the inside holes.  And clean the paint off the hanger where it butts the motor n thermal paste there and on the whole axle n nut even. I’ll do one side n easy to test. If u don’t have a thermometer for 15$ worth getting to test. But really those infrared thermometers kinda suck n want a micro wired sensor on the windings.  Easy. Not that I’ve done it. That’s the one sensor I want.

At this point, not sure how long till the pcb's will arrive. The sensors are already at Johns. It will work. But I need to find high heat wires to use for sensor wires. Those have to go into the oven since the board needs o be placed during pressing. I'm thinking so sort of layer between the hub and sensor board, and the sensor boards end goal is to be glued to the hub, with the sensors going between the teeth, just fitting after shaving some of the stator off.

Well after a few more days riding I think hub motors will make a significant impact on the future of drive system sales.  The @Hummie hubs are extremely powerful as I have said in all aspects as good or better than my dual 6374 setup.  They climb and accelerate hard and I have still not found top end yet.  They also free wheel down hills like butter and breaking is as good as the belt drive.  

The only thing missing is the ability to have different wheel choices for different riding applications.  The ABEC 11 Centrex 83mm 80A is superb wheel and perfect size with huge contact patch.  I have no desire for and alternative urethane wheel however it would be so awesome to be able to pop on some pneumatics like @psychotiller has on his six shooter hubs (6"). 

So we talked a little about this in the treads above and was interested if anyone would take on the challenge to design a (plug and play) option that would fit-up with the hub.  I would if I had the abilities but at this point the design is over my capabilities.  

Kevin

for performance high motor amps is nice, so at maybe 80 or even 100 per motor and then the battery amps maybe start low at around 25 each motor and then start bumping up depending what you like and you'd feel that variable more at higher speed.   and change the foc switching frequency to 30,000 makes it much quieter.  brakes I forget what I set it to but i wouldn't worry about damaging the batteries and feel your way along with the battery and motor amp limits there to see what you like.  i think the negative amp settings work similar to the amp settings and determine brake power at the different speeds, with motor being at the slow speeds and battery being at the high speeds.

I guess I should prolly apologize to you. A year and a half ago we were talking and I tried like crazy to get you to make 90mm wheels. You've totally changed my mind. 

Centrax 83mm wheels ride as good as flywheel 97mm wheels.  Different comound, different results I guess. Anyways, you were absolutely correct. If you sell more hubs, I want another set of 83s.

I rode 20 miles today, almost empty when I got back to my front door, on crap asphalt with volcano flow like cracks. They rode as good as any thane I've ever ridden in those conditions.

@mmaner no apology please you and do many people are saying the same.  They say it’s the future. I’m happy with these 84mm.  They’re a bit bigger than centrax but I can’t see diff on the board.   And u know the tire is pure experiment.  So far showing well but only been maybe 6 months. It has no core and the interface w the motor is the area that it makes it or doesn’t.  And it also shows to slightly expand when at top speed.  I thought we’d need a core 8 months ago. 


But I’m going to get some silver thermal paste glue.  Silver something named. And cover the inner holes. I’ve never had a problem but surely stuff will be getting on there and should be sealed.  If u come up with a better way to seal I’m looking.  In the future have it sealed. 


N u should get that thermal paste n clean the hanger of paint where it touches the motor.  I told u.

Is it safe to ride the hubs on slightly wet roads and sand or should I have tape on the holes? Is there any way to let me ride them in a thin layer of sand on a path/ride in the rain?

Just look at the winding factor first, I don’t remember if it stays the same, the stator is 14 slots? If the winding factor goes down too much you will loose torque for same current/heat loss

Take a look at the app available at emetor.com , does not work on mobile browsers

Here is my honest opinion....If you have the means everyone should have a few boards for different conditions and moods,  I have two and they are polar opposites,  I have my all weather, all terrain board that I use both 8" Kenda slicks and 9" MTB tyres with studs... I live in an all seasonal climate  (Minneapolis) and in the tough cold / raining conditions or in the summer I want to trail ride... the pneumatic board is the go too. It works and is dependable and fun...as well when the conditions are warmer and roads dry the @Hummie build is my go too.  It is more responsive and carves much better and that said....one is not better then the other it all depends on conditions, terrain and mood.  

My own personal experience is the only bad board is one that is not reliable or lacking torque / power....to look for a board to respond only to bog down or not give you the power you desire is a real bummer..

I will be adding one more board that sits in the middle of the extremes not built yet however going all out and we will share once complete...

It’s a 12 slot stator.  I shouldn’t say anything about why the 12x14 is so widely used but power factor isn’t the term and guessing.  I don’t have the education background but i just pick out the important bits when I can and it seems the usual bldc stator design and pole count and the concentrated winding (just one phase type per slot) we are all using..these are motors without “coasting” in mind.   I guess esc plane and car people sit on the throttle. WOT. Haha. All the time. Wide open. That’s their lingo if u didn’t know. And the stator shape and the cylindrical wire and behind the magnets.  Hobby king and every place practically is just using cylindrical wire and even at max fill it would be like 80%.   More so it’s all the stator design that I think I’ll want to change and maybe off the shelf square wire.  And that could be easy to get done for a couple thousand bucks.  Molds made to cut the stators. But first get a couple epdm cut to test.  I’m looking for ideas.  I know soon it’s all I’ll think about.  And how to get the magnets in quickly. I’ve never seen good video.  And I thought the thick bell would fully reflect the magnetic field but doesn’t and really want to do it w hallbach. All those motors we see have such thin backiron.

Bldc motor has no other mechanical part besides the bearing that wears down. Brush motor rely on the brushes for polarity switching so it doesnt do well in water unless sealed. Brushes also wears do over time.

In theory you should not have issues with water in the motors, since there’s no sensors. With sensors, it’s a bit more daring. But even then, the plan is glue after sensor board is attached to the stator and hub. So it should be fine. Water is only bad if the surfaces didn’t have a finish (but they do, so it shouldn’t rust), or there’s an open circuit that can the water can bridge and short. Since everything is dipped in motor winding epoxy, I can’t see where a short water occur so it should be fine. Your battery and esc are the real danger, since you aren’t dipping those in epoxy (creating a seal essentially).

U could run the motors completely submerged.  The magnet wire comes out of the motor so the  short potential would be under the hestshrink there where it comes out n connected to the leads. ![image|666x500](upload://zXDD5hBWrjWytVVAgxIwEHoigNz.jpeg) If u really want to ride under water u should take the shrink off and paint the connections.

I’d love to get those wheels made grey but that’s maybe 11000 bucks to make happen.  If I can make the money on Kickstarter. 


I know a lot of people want to go like 50mph with these but they still need to be tested as is and the centrifugal force on the spinning tire could be too much and they could literally fly off or something.    It would likely need a core.  In the future I’d like to get a 91 with a core but a giant tire on a direct drive is making it harder on a direct drive motor.

I didn’t sell them for 575. 
I don’t know what to do but if u decline the package and it comes back to me I’m not going to pay the shipping cost again.  Me posting a lower value puts me in danger to begin with and I’ve had things disappear in the mail and have to pay that.  Can’t value it super low and insure it at the real value

I can send extra tires and wheels later to compensate u as they don’t cost me as much and I have them.  That’s what I can offer. I know I said I’d value it lower.  My mistake. I get easily confused w shipping and my fault but when push comes to shove this is a lot of work for me and I like it to a degree but I’m not going to straight lose cash money for such a thing.   If u had trouble with the motors or something that would be a different situation and I’d help any way and I had people ship stuff back to get it right.

So I have done a little google on duty and import cost for Ireland and from what I have found Ireland has a typical duty cost of between [5-8% and a VAT of 23%](https://www.export.gov/article?id=Ireland-Import-Tariffs).
Using the values to work out the expected extra costs gives me this:

![importcost|399x491](upload://x31QGNCJDzmn6dhHJIMan9aFsUX.png) 

Even including the USPS custom clearance fee, it gives a total of €170 extra.
While I acknowledge that it's pretty shitty to have to pay extra on pretty much everything that we import into the EU, but on the other hand, your wanting have them sent back and have them sent again with a lower declared value of $50.

$75 to send back, $75 to have them sent again.  Total is now €132 plus the new import cost at the lower fee with shipping.

![importcost%20again|386x500](upload://7mIXdjHuT2hFCFdS5W7bchkrtDr.png) 

and now your right back at the same cost with all the added waste of time.

Feel free to correct anything I may have missed.

Really?

I’d just accept those hubs because they seem to be the raddest hubs out on the market and swallow my wallets pride. 

It’s always a risk for us europe buyers from the usa and sometimes we get lucky and most times we don’t. 

Even if they ship with a low value amount it can still happen that we have to pay import and so on for delivery. 
It’s happened to me when I bought the flipsky dual and they stated value of $50. 

No one here wants to pay whatever you need to pay to buy them from you?

Honestly hummie, this is why you need an a shopping cart system. That way, you can keep track of notes like this. You keep telling me paypal is all you need, it's all there. Well you seemed to have missed one order from what you told me the other day, and then you lose notes like this. Though I get your situation with the insurance. But if he wants that done, he needs to sign something to take responsibility for if it gets lost.

Honestly, I think it's a stupid risk to not have insurance. But these things need to be agreed upon before shipping...

Well Hummie has said the hubs cost $470, so I got that part right.

He has a screenshot of the receipt showing a cost of $75 for shipping, so I got that part right.

The VAT rate for Ireland is 23% as listed in the source that I provided, so I got that part right.

The only thing that is left for debate is the import duty cost, that I selected the higher end of the typical value that applies to items imported from the USA because I can't be fucked looking through pages of pages to find right the correct TARIC commodity code in the TARIC database.

But hey, keep on having a cry and I'll sit back and enjoy the salt.

These motors have the best available magnets with the best epoxy and the best thane available using quality steel etc etc. "cheap" is relative to what you would pay for the same product somewhere else. 
I'm pretty sure, with all the high quality parts and time invested in these that john would be lucky to be making any money at all... I think that's probably half the reason he can't offer to pay for your shipping again so that you can dodge an import tax that you are meant to pay anyway...

In seriousness, sucks that shipping is a mess. Import taxes really suck, especially for such low overhead low volume and high value products. Also, I didn't realize you're in Ireland!

Are you going to be doing arctic mountains or tropical?  The temp limit of the magnets is 300f and that’s maybe the limit of the motor

You'd need a proper benchtest in a torquebench to rate them. Ideally you'd set the max power output in roomtemp conditions and the top rated power would be when they run without issue but any higher would destroy them basically. Not sure what the top margins are but probably around 20-25%. If i was still in uni I could test them in the power lab. Its easly done with a 3 phase motor mounted on the other end and letting the hummies rotate it. You apply more and more current to the connected motor to increase load on the hummies and eventually things get hot. It's abit scary but very intresting. 

I guess one could improvise a DIY torquebench as well. Readings might not be as reliable tho

I think u could come up with a peak power output on the dyno, which I’d like to see, without damaging anything by increasing motor amps until it no longer produced torque linearly with each amp or you could figure it mathematically based on the volume of iron in the stator and a bunch of other variables.  This peak power would really be a peak torque rating but still more of a concrete number without variables that could change, but the continuous power output would be harder to state as there’s no definition of “continuous power” in terms of time.  How long is continuous?  All day or as long as a 600 watthour battery lasts?  And while you could do the test on a bench at room temp that will be removing the ability of airflow to remove the heat and the ambient temp would vary in real use as well.  Also the speed the test would be done would greatly determine the potential power with the motor going faster adding to total wattage output.  At different speeds you’d get different power ratings and likely the fastest speed producing the most. 
As a rider looking to not destroy the motor you’re good to 300f with the magnets but I wouldn’t go anywhere near that number and I consider 160f a reasonable max temp. The hotter you get the more inefficient as well as electrical resistance rises with heat as well as hysteresis in the iron. 

Likely the biggest limitation is the Pu.  If you’re repeately getting to 200f you should occasionally take the tire off and look at its interface with the motor looking for wear or stretching.

In the practical world you should take the motor off, clean and flatten the contact area between it and the hanger and add thermal paste there and all along the axle.  That will do a lot for pulling heat away and keeping the motor cool

Be aware how your bearings sound and roll from their first use going forward and also the Pu fit to the motor.  And maybe seal the inner holes on the motor and you’ll have no worries.

It sucks how customs can fuck so much up. The point is to allow innovation in your own country with less competition (i.e. to push you to buy local), but what about when you can't buy local? Seem's like if a product can't be bought locally, there shouldn't be any customs.

Even 80x50.4 only gives you just over 4000 watts.

Don't think for a minute that motor will be able to do more than 3000 watts con, same with hummie hubs.

Once you get a certain size, which tourque boards has defiantly hit, you should be able to put more watts into it than most will be able to supply from their batteries.

idk, I like a lot of power. I'm assuming you'll be using big wheels also, so you'll lose torque there.

I honestly don't know if I'll be able to use all 12000 watts that the vesc's will be set to see. I might just get spinning wheels or thrown off the board, haha. But for science...

I also don't like li-ion as it just sags too much for me. Lipos pack a better punch on the hard accelerations (discharge curve is better, probably cause the C rating is way higher on lipo)

One step closer, just waiting on a stator to use. Hummie is officially out of stators after he sends the last of the orders.

I personally think the hummie hubs are better because of the better thane and lower kv. If the raptor hubs were in a drag race with the hummies and both setups had the same battery, esc and motor / battery amps then the hummies would win because of that lower kv and smaller wheel diameter. The raptor hubs are more expensive and I much prefer the hummies because of their better torque and riding experience. I value torque over top speed because I don't really like going 30+ on some of the roads I take everyday and use the extra torque more that speed. If you want the most speed you can possibly get go with the raptor hubs. If you want a better riding experience and more torque go with the hummies. If you have more specific questions just ask.

I’d love to see a drag race between them. 

Have you tried a raptor 2 though? It has plenty of torque compared to less than any 6374 dual setup with equal juice. 
That is a little bit my guess. 

I’ve tried a few 6374 dual setups. 
Also tried a few 6355 and whatever boosted and evolve are and the raptor 2 would easily beat these setups off the line and top speed.

Oh, that’s nice. I was running 120a motor and 30a battery on each of my hummie hubs in 4wd. Hopeing to double that once I get the vesc 6’s.
[/quote]


Doubling just the battery current? Because doubling the motor current will not be possible with VESC 6. Do you already put your Metr Pro module in your build? I am really interesting to see data from a 4 x 30A battery and 4 x 120A motor current build. I can't imagine you are hitting these values on an esk8 considering how much 1 x 80A battery and 1 x 160A motor current on an eBike punches you. What an amazing and crazy build. :+1:

[quote="evoheyax, post:1990, topic:25251, full:true"]
I put them like this in the v1 hummie hubs will not issues.

Honestly the magnetic field is so strong I don’t think it’ll be an issue.
[/quote]
Are you sure it worked perfect? I think the positioning of the Hall sensors you did there is not a good idea. The magnetic field will not flow the sensor the way it should and because it is sitting between two coils it will be triggered by both. Don't see it as an offense. I just don't want you to disassemble the motor afterwards when you put so much work into it.

How do you think the sensors should be orrientaied to get the best?

They did work in the v1s, it was hard to cog them with the sensors.

I will try this none the less because the worst case is we just press the stator off. I’ll test it without dipping it just to make sure it works.

That's what I told him too, but he said it worked with the old hubs so hes keeping it that way. I'm planning to use smd hall sensor to catch the magnetic flux coming off the side of the curved magnets. I feel like that would be the best idea for how crammed the inside of the hubs are. Definitely not giving up 5mm stator length for sensor tho.

Pressed but did not work. Looking at the magnets, the sensors are not under the magnet. So they did fail. But it’s also possible the pcb or sensor got crushed in pressing, as I heard a pop.

As pointed out, I’ll Turn them sideways also. But it’ll be a bit of a pain with the fit. Either way, still pushing forward with more learned.

I figured out the weird good feeling with these tires. They feel like Flashbacks! Flashbacks feel so good to ride but have terrible roll-out. The centrax with the width and the big lip brings a similar feel. Groovy. :slight_smile: no chunks or cracks and they feel good even in freezing temps.

I should check the bearings with the FLIR but so far your hubs feel so solid. No vibrations, and they feel like they'll last. My R2 motor vibrate quite a bit at speed.

Later batch of the black ones. Between the twitchy remote, the crazy torque early, and the vibrating foot massage at top speed, I'm scared of my R2. Gotta put some miles on it before warranty is up though. The 97s help a bit, and I should just swap remotes. Hate the startup calibration too.

Oh I should mention, I have ownboard hubs. They shake a bit but max speed 25mph or so, it's not as noticeable. Carvon 2.5 were smooth but didn't feel as chunk of metal solid like the hummies.

I've put 200+ miles on the hubs. PU is still great with no chuck. there's some glass cuts but that's unavoidable. they are made with the same formula as ABEC so last as long as ABEC wheels?? as for bearing, they depends on which one you get, regular vs japanese bearing.

oh the motor Can is not balanced so if you want extra smooth top speed you would want to do that yourself. It's definitely already smooth enough atm.

I sold my motors to will park ages ago and haven't gotten a board back together.  It’s rediculous. I did work for about 3 hours on motors today though.  been somehow in a psychological block and just want to lay around or ride the bike or I skate regular a lot.  I fell off going maybe 8mph today ![image|375x500](upload://q61DjgPqVv97cE4tFlKSnSv9Lvn.jpeg) trying to slide the carbon deck n centrax in a wet spot, and it slide and landed on my hip and more messed up than going off at 25.  My new socks lasted less than half an hour.


But thinking of things to do to the motors: make sure they’re not moving at all when braking or accelerating. See If the wires move.  Or maybe the tires will deform. They’ve been the weak link since years back but the shape n material could be right. It made by same as abec but custom material for heat. 
I’m putting my own motors together n cleaned off the paint on the hanger n will add thermal paste.  

The black zinc oxide screws always rust. Found u can blue stainless steel!  So can get stainless with dark color. Been doing it w nuts ![image|375x500](upload://jGdYNKTrpWZnYqdI5DmAe2MvCP1.jpeg)

@Hummie i think i broke something. On one of the motors the plate that the phase wires come out of is now free to spin around the axis. I noticed when it yanked out my phase wires.

Does that mean the stator has come loose and is spinning? Is the stator threaded onto the axle? I just need a big hex bit to tighten it?

And do you think it's safe to ride home with it loose? I'm not sure I have the tools at work.

I think the focbox might have survived, maybe because the MT60 disconnected all 3 phases at once.

One motor down feels way less than half power :slight_smile:

Yea with one motor down feels way less.  But u need a hex and two pin bike wrench. Park tools make s nice one with a green handle for ten bucks.  I wouldn’t ride with it loose. You tighten the part the phases come out of w the two pin, regular clockwise, and tighten the nut on the other side with the hex counter clockwise.  Maybe a spot of loctite. I didn’t use any.

1:1 gear ratio. That's what you get. so it's 2-3x lower than belt drives, depending on gearing.

One of mine feels like this too but the other is still dragging. Maybe I'll take a short video... :thinking: They are very fun to ride though, the torque is the most I had till now. The diyeboard hubs with replaceable sleeves, also 75KV, were not far away but became really hot doing my usual testing route. The torque while on flat is really funny, can't wait to get them a bit faster with 12s but even at 10s @ 40kph they are a lot of fun :) At the moment power consumption is a bit high but thats because of the coasting issue and will hopefully soon be gone :) The wheels ride very smooth, similar to my MBS Landwheel crossover but those were a bit better dealing with debris on the road.

Guys I find the Paris 195 and stock rear truck not wide enough for Hummie deck mounted drop through. It rubs a little bit and never bit but I would prefer a bit better turning. I am planning to make a few custom axle bolt out of 7075 Alu for SR. I was looking for somewhere to CNC them but it's seems to be too expensive. So the plan of action is try to do it myself at a makerspace. This is the first time I will be using a Lathe. Wish me GL. Also who is interested in a pair if this goes well? It's a 4 steps diameter axle bolt :grimacing:

Fatigue limit


This value is the maximum stress which can be applied over an infinite number of cycles. The  **fatigue limit**  for  **steel**  is typically 35 to 60% of the tensile  **strength**  of the material.  **Fatigue strength**  is a term applied for nonferrous  **metals**  and alloys (Al, Cu, Mg) which do not have a  **fatigue limit** .

Despite this wiki quote ti does have a fatigue limit too. But not aluminum I believe.  So every stress of aluminum is further towards a snap while ti and steel, if under their limit can take the stress infinitely.  And then rather have a yield than a break and the softer steels seem safest in a way as they’d just bend.  And much easier to machine n cheap.

@Winfly I was going to say exactly what Hummie said

Your aluminum axle would definitely hold the load, for a short while

Aluminum have a finite lifespan under cyclic loading, and opposite than steel, it does not have a minimum stress level that guarantee infinite fatigue life

Titanium appears to be better than aluminum, but I've never looked deep into it

Bottom line, don't go aluminum unless you want an unexpected faceplant

An important observations, in most cases the best material is not the best for the application most aplications, that's why you see lot of counter intuitive (at first glance ) material choices

So been trying to figure out how I can utilize this great platform to create a pneumatic hub motor.

Here's one idea for a 200x50 tire:

![PNG|532x500](upload://htSNpF3HVld4n7j7qNRI9uxtX3p.jpeg) 

The idea is that you would choose which bell you want during the assembly stage and it uses the same motor as before.

The other idea I have is using the same setup, but using a wider stator. This would surely yield a much better motor. Just curious how much weaker the acceleration will become with the 8 inch tire.

I'm back on the road! @Hummie amazing. I lost the nut that holds the motor on. He got me the part ASAP and hand holding me all the way through. Added loctite, it's stayed on at least for the test ride. I'm gonna have to carry an 8mm hex wrench and the bike tool around for a couple of weeks.

Did a test ride, max throttle up and down some hills. No fault codes, no problems. Amazingly, despite having the phase wire disconnect under load at least twice, focbox looks to have survived. The MT60 connector might have something to do with it, disconnecting all 3 phases at once.

I'm gonna take the opportunity again to say how much I like this setup. The deck and motors are in harmony, and the ride is amazing. I enjoyed the hell out of the test ride :slight_smile:

Yeah, guys running these motors, it's worth a check every now and then. And buy the bike tool. You can tighten the can against the nut, like a jamnut.

I'll probably put the torque wrench on it, so I can check if they've loosened periodically.

I haven't put at least 300miles on it without loctite. You really only need to torque it down.

On the other hand, this is for everyone. Go ahead and test the motor kv before riding. @hummie found out that he yeilded between 65-85kv just because of various magnet placement in respect to the steel hub.

Both of mine sets at 70-73kv. And @mmaner's 85.

Best if u tighten the motor to the hanger w the two pin tool then the locknut on top while holding the motor fixed hard with the two pin .  So all three tight against each other not just the motor n locknut. 


Curious what kv people have and as @Winfly says there’s a surprising amount of variation  even with exact clone windings and magnets. The variance only ![image|375x500](upload://vKUz4q2Pegxdob7kkU4J9sTWjMb.jpeg) due to how the magnets are placed related to the teeth on the outside.  Surprising as looking at the pull force simulator for steel here
https://www.kjmagnetics.com/blog.asp?p=steel-thickness-calculator (think still here) anyway it shows 1mm thick steel behind magnets reflect all strength but it’s showing not to be the case and if the magnet is positioned with the thick steel behind it ironically it reflects less and it is reflected more with the gap behind the magnet because the field comes out at the edges not directly behind.   Ideal is a lower kv as its inverse the kt, which is the torque per amp is going up.  Ideal would be the magnets placed so a lower kv (in front of the gap not tooth) and then maybe only 8 wraps of wire needed instead of 9 for the same kv and then less electrical resistance and a better more powerful motor:doesn’t get as hot for same power output 
 Simulations aren’t as good as the real thing by a long shot. 14 teeth n gaps matching 14 magnets

https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=ZVQaZEDFt18

It’s been forever and still don’t have the Kickstarter up but coming.   It’s seeming we might get a slightly bigger tire done at 88mm diameter instead of the usual and matching wheels!

Been running my original hummie's for a few years straight all over campus- Hills, rain, cracks, you name it... and they are still kicking without any changes other than a set of new rubber and some marine grease for the poor bearings. 

No doubt one of the best hub motor designs still to this day even in their tiny Kegel-sized package.

When I'm home I'll add this telemetry to the videos and cut it :) I'm not sure if its both hubs or only one, 25,6A max seems a bit low for both, I went full throttle uphills which is normally close to the max (I set it to 30A, new VESC tool told me that :))

I'm sure it's been asked hummer but from kickstarter to delivery what sort of timeframe are you operating on? I don't need to know by the hour but I'd love a set of these badboys and the anticipation is a killer.

Also I couldn't see your lumberjack axe in that video, did you keep it in a belt loop or leave it at home for the ride? It must be difficult to be without it.

And I've not forgotten the time you mocked my arm strength. Never forget, never forgive. One day when you expect it least I will get you.

For sure will post up the Kickstarter in just over a week. 

If I remember correctly all the parts including even the tires took only 6 weeks to be made.  It’s then maximum another week for delivery and then assembly is possible in a week.   (The past motors took forever to assemble as it was almost all done by me in my small apartment).  If the bucks come I assure u I’ll get as many people as we need to get it done as quickly as possible.  

One day soon I’ll spill all the beans on what’s going on. A lot in the works related to tires n wheels

You're supposed to ignore the post! From what I hear the hubs are so powerful anyways. I mean, I've read all of the arguments both ways I just think that if you are trying to make a tight right hand turn (i ride goofy) from a stop and your wheel is stuck in a crack... 

I know, apparently all you probably would have to do is hop or shimmy a little bit, maybe I just like the "idea" or the ability to always rely on the board to pick up and go from a dead stop.

Formula one cars can't start themselves either though so... ;)

Selling motors but the complete board will be an option:
 Bens enclosures   Push to start.  No rubber bands although they’re still going fine

I’m sure the profit margin is thin but it’s hard to convince people to spend more on a motor that’s just another hub motor in many minds

Very true!  Again, it is a financial issue that has prevented me from completing it.  I know I could easily build a cheaper version, but I'm extremely stubborn about only using what I consider to be the best parts, regardless of number of builds under my belt (0/1)...  Believe me, I feel embarrassed about this.  One of the main reasons I haven't been as active on the forum lately.  I don't think I should be commenting or sharing opinions when I have yet to finish my own...  Like I said though, I'll finally get mine finished by the Spring/Summer.

For KS you should get photos of everyone's dead non-hummie brand hub motors, and photos of dead hummie motors (hopefully zero). Maybe some FLIR shots of other hubs with same settings after a hill climb.

wow.  I don’t know why so much but if u ever have a problem I’ve got u for life

But they’re experimental as always and had one sent back said to be getting weaker.  It was a phase wire almooost broken and I pulled it and it came apart.  Was showing high and fluctuating resistance on bldc tool.  I soldered back n it’s good but that spot where the phase wires come out is still a weak spot.  Next time will use a better stiffer tube support.  ![image|666x500](upload://awcM8L8M9JiDQQzZZOmfBUcnzhE.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://d8QjsepcTNbhi4DMiA20KghcROK.jpeg) 

You only get so many shots at resoldering as the magnet wire gets shorter coming out of the motor is u break it there. 

What we saw:
There was one bent axle a while ago but no others.  Probably a bunch of compressed and loud bearings (next motors (hopefully)have massive bearing planned).  The tires are awesome and no one yet has shown a cut or damage (I launched mine at the laundromat breaking a bench and melting a tire while I as inside whistling away, lesson learned).   No broken motor yet of this newer version that wasn’t fixed.  And none of the old.  Send them back if you have the old n I’ll fix it too.


You’re all in the same boat with me and we want this Pu and need to raise the bucks mainly for the production batch of molds.  10,000$. 100 molds with a machined surface

Still finishing but be up soon!

We’ll be selling a complete board including motors,the unity, simple mini trigger, and @bigben enclosure and competitively priced.  And selling just the motors separately.   Matching tire colors.  

We’ll be doing a promotional riding event in San Francisco beside twin peaks two weeks from now  if you’re around to come try the boards

Hoping someone here is good with graphic design and interested in doing a simple stencil we can put on the deck or something.  I have none of that and hazard tape isn’t for everyone.     Moving from steelhubs.com to hummiemotors.com since that’s how more widely known.

I am so excited for this in the alternate reality in which I can afford it.

Actually, it's so cool I think I'm excited just for the community in general, hopefully this is a sign of a growing marketplace and opportunity for more things like this to happen.

I've done a couple successful kickstarters before (references available) and have good connections with the people that work there, and I'm also in the SF area. If you'd like some help or advice on the campaign, please PM me. 

Otherwise I'll just stay interested any maybe come ride at the SF event.

P.S. I actually like the hazard tape. I'm avoiding putting it on my own board because I don't want to steal your thunder. :slight_smile:

Thats what I am saying! 

There is a softness to the design that is simple, elegant, and iconic!

Very recognizable and the Hummingbird is the perfect representative of powerful things in small packages, just like Hummie Hubs.  Doesn't hurt that they sound similar too 😉.

@mmaner is killin the game with designing Esk8 logos!

Literally the more I look at it, the more I like it.  So good.

I’ve just been leaving them bare for different choices.  Hate to put them on and then people just cut them.  The unity in not sure what plugs go with it but could maybe do those on the motor but the focboxes have dinky plugs


They’re actually 84.  But I like the little wheel. Some of us do.  A stretch goal of bigger wheel than that

@bluegreen (Kevin) designed the arduboy and the Kickstarter video and he’s been giving me advice and I have his ear thankfully.  I’m sure I’m nowhere near the promotional level could be at but want those parts first

Lol filming someone else and riding at the same time on live public roads gettings tricky quick. I would put video of me eating it if I did, but I didn’t 😉

I will make another video soon where I really show the power even more. There was a quick sprint after the turn to 30 mph to catch up to John. But he was riding slower that day. So I had to slow down also.

Seven fifty with extra tires n wheels  Or two thousand for complete.  Decks n enclosures at three twenty five.                                                                                                                      There is a ten thousand dollar mold cost for the tires.   There are cheaper polyurethane places but this is the best and a custom heat resistant formula. They’ve shown to be fantastic.   Everyone who has the motors is hooked in the same boat and we must get to that ten thousand goal for any of us to be getting tires in the future.   I’d like to be cheaper but this goal needs to be met.

Best thing you can do right now is go to hummiemotors.com and sign up for the wait list! Lets hummie know how many people are waiting on this to launch.

When it goes live will be helpful to share on your facebooks, twitters and any other social medias.

Crowdfunding campaigns are most successful when they use the network effect of the community! 

Anyone know of any social media influencers with hundreds of thousands of followers or maybe some editors at a blog that might be interested in reviewing the board?

Influencers / bloggers expect to keep the product and maybe get paid too, niche market doesn’t need that arrangement and it’s not affordable unless you're pumping out volume crap or $100 ticket items..

I don't get why you're doing a KS. People are already familiar with you and your brand, you're giving up a bit cut of your sales to KS for no reason.

Just set up Shopify and create a pre-order and save some (a lot) of money. I think a lot of these KS creators don't account for KS's cut and wind up with less capital to work with. 

If you're looking to get exposure to an audience you wouldn't have otherwise reached, limit the KS campaign to just a few boards, then drive them to your website and have them pre-order.

@Hummie I have to admit that I thought the same. To much hassle and you give away a lot of the profits. To me make a small kickstarter just to be on the website and then sell directly from your shop. Send 2-3 boards around for review to the main Youtube guys. Also the one that I do not really like but they have followers. Compare to the crap stuffs they normally ride I bet they will like it a lot your complete board.

thing is hummie needs to be sure he got the money for molds and stuff (tens of thousands of dollars) so all of us would have to prepay and hummie would still not know if he got enough money to start producing stuff.

thats the only reason for KS anyway.

question is what about some private investors? we sure have some guys here with enough money and trust... don‘t look at me... well maybe... you know...

well then put the 10K as threshold for the KS campaign that it is not that much compare to other I have seen and the rest on your shop.
I advice to contact PayPal in advance because their "protection" has a lot of but...just this week I need their intervention for the first time in my life. I ordered 3mm black ABS sheets . Got almost 4mm white ABS. Asked for new ones, they say yes but being 2 weeks and they do no ship. No refund possible then I contacted PayPal. Provided pictures, text, transaction ecc....guess what I lost becuase their protection doesn't cover customizable items. In my case colour and thickness. to me is absurd, but that what happened. I just advice to ask before in order to avoid any surprise later on.

You are literally sending the people from hear to Kickstarter. Literally you paying Kickstarter and advertising then for you product. 

I would recommend you did a gaging interest GB just see how many are willing to buy what product and deduct that from the KS call it early investors or some thing but I’m betting you get a good % if you start up with you rep for been fair and going above and beyond that you seem to repeatedly can’t help you self doing even when it costs you personally.

Even if everyone has 1-2K views then at this stage it will change the amount of non-forum member interested in the board. Same for reddit.

@Hummie / @evoheyax run the cost/investment/profit numbers, if you think that you could reach the funding without KS/Indiegogo then do it without, but my humble impression is that the DIY market will not be enough, or that expanding the market will have a lot more potential. 

Best of luck! If executed right you could to a really big thing, the products are already top notch ;)

You right. The biggest problem is you just need to say anything, whether you have a good board or not, and people will go "wooooww". Look at the serpent board. They say "91a duro wheels" like that is a real benefit over other wheels... Seriously? But they had all the bells and whistles to take off the shelf china hub motors and china poured super hard wheels and other cheap components and make it sound like the next big invention or something... And it sold. It's going to take a lot of work to get people to understand the difference. But i'm working on the campaign all day today.

We could launch the Kickstarter still before the end of the month as planned, but we would be without the details everyone deserves. Boards with logos and enclosures coming any day thanks to sender and mmnaner, everything is falling into place. I am working on a rebuild to fix the sloppy look of my last build. Don’t know if we’ll show this in the Kickstarter, but you imagination and riding ability will be your limit!

Is anybody running the Hummies with the unity? What settings are u using? I've heard of the unity crapping out at above 30mph. I'm running a 13s set up so would rather know of any issues before it craps out on me if anybody has used it thus far. thx

If the unity is having problems at highest speed I’m guessing it likely has to do with hitting high erpms and with a hub motor with low pole count it should be safer.                                                       Kickstarter goes up start of next week.   Hummiemotors.com

im syched because I can sell the motor set for 700$ including extra wheels and extra tires and shipping usa insured on kickstater.   if we get to 40 sets sold we can afford the tire molds and that's the goal

im adding a price for tires alone on the kickstarter. they will be expensive. that’s because you people who already have the motors at a cheaper price are in this and im hoping to get your push on this to get the molds we need. In the future I will sell the tires cheap. the price of the tires will be 6.25 to me after we get the molds and i’ll charge 10$ each going forward if they stay at that price. But that price wont be happening if we don’t get to the kickstarter goal and any other tires will be not as good as this custom high heat formula from the best in the world. Those who have the tires attest.

comparing this to the market, if you know the market, its a broad sprectrum and feel at the top and no expense was spared in the materials and this design is proven for maybe 4 years now, not one mechanical break of a motor and tires that are fantastic.  
will put it up tonight and be up for 60 days. 
just talked to manufacturer of the mechanical parts and they are 40 days, pu is 60 I think, and time to make...we will huddle in scrum formation with the pile of parts and set out a plan for an intense two weeks.

the  board will be a separate kickstarter I’ll put up tonight too.  That’s simple.  Bare decks for 125$ and with fiberglass boxes mounted for 275$

Love the effort you put in to your designs and research the quality really shows through. The shipping and taxes kill every thing from US for me. A @psychotiller enclosure was over  $140 by the time it arived over double what it cost in the US. Hopefully once you set up you can arrange some thing thro @bigben. I thing you hubs would be grate on my spud commuter deck and next build I’m thinking a low rider over powered hummie deck on surfrodz is some thing I need in my life to carve up the tarmac (asphalt to you Americans) on the weekend.

Let’s say I sign up for a deck 

$125 deck
$40 shipping
$5 Import fees (3% of item value)
$15 Handling fee (customs shipping in new county and fee collection )
$37 Value Added Tax (20% new total)
$7 customs card transaction fee (%3)
$7 Bank Charge (payment in foren currency) 

What am I up to so fare $236 and that’s what I can think of on the top of my head of minimum fees. this can shoot up depending on what company deals with it over hear. Your profit margin is tiny I’m guessing $15 I think you take on so much and don’t really take enough to be fair but do you think you deck is worth $236. Would you pay that much for it? Pleas don’t take this personally I’m not agains you just showing how much it cost me in the UK and been open. I admire you and how hard you work and determination you put in to bring one of the beset decks and hubs to the market. Performance and reliability far suppasing almost every thing on the market and setting new standards fare higher than I thought possible. I really hope for the best for you as you really deserve it and wish there were more people like you willing to go way above and beyond making the Esk8 community a better place. It pains me to think every one els is making so much more off you’r hard work than you do and at the end of the day you have to deal with every thing els on top. I might be in Hawaii in a few months for work with any luck I can arrange to purchase one then and bring it back avoiding all the extra charges. But do you see were I’m coming from $240 for a deck by the time I get it. I personally just can’t justify that at the minute and I’m not blaming you pleas don’t take it personally.

Vendors (and customers) on here (and anywhere really) deal with this all the time.  

That is the reason why there are multiple vendors that produce similar products in different locations (US/EU/AUS)

It's not about how much he thinks his deck is worth. Our hobby is fucking minuscule in the grand scheme of things right now. If we want custom anything, it's always in relatively small runs, and prices run high. Hummie has gear, the community knows what it does. If you want what his gear offers, you have to pay the price. He probably isn't making that much on any of his endeavors. I'm sure that he would love to offer things cheaper with the same quality, but I'm sure he's found that there's not really a way to do that and keep quality up. All of our trucks are made out of $10-20 worth of raw materials max. But guess wut, anything precision has to be made on a mill. Mills aren't that expensive sometimes, but tooling, price of space, price of keeping maintenance on that space, all adds up reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel quick. So yeah

Litraly go back and read what I said in the last 2/3 of the same post. I think he making almost nothing and under cutting him self and making less profit than most esk8 sellers IMO. @Hummie  said he happy with his profit margin. My point was to why I wouldn't join the Kickstarter was the cost of logistics and how every one els in the chain makes so much more than hummie. 

I’m sorry you think I’m wrong in wanting the profits to go to the people that make design and develop these products instead of every one else trying to take a pice after. 

I’d even put a huge bet on if hummie worked out every hour he Research, development,  phone calls with suppliers, testing etc. etc. vs his profits he be on some thing stupid like $0.50c a hour.

I think if I say much more it be un productive so I leave it at that but feel free to PM if you think I’m mis lead in my understanding still and you want to change my mined.

Lol, he wants the deck but doesn't want to pay the money and support hummie because he thinks "hummie isn't making enough money".

A quick question. How many integrated decks do you know of that exist let alone cost 125 USD plus shipping??? 

Literally all those other costs you are complaining about are related to the country you live in or your personal financial choices. 

If you would like to support hummie and all of his hard work and you want the deck as well, I suggest that you join the Kickstarter. That is literally what it is there for.

And do one cylindrical wire and one quadratic?  Never seen that enameled for magnet wire or ever really so that’s an obstacle.  Doubt U could easilymake it urself but please do and post how!  The square is even pretty rare. 

 Given there’s maybe 30 or more percent of the motor slot that goes unfilled with even best attempts by hand with cylindrical wire it’s a way to hugely boost performance especially with how are motors are much more so copper loss than iron.

I didn’t understand what u meant by quadratic, but square or rectangular wire?  I’ll see soon and in the mail but I hear easier.  Don’t know specifically why would be easier.   Maybe easier for same copper fill.  We go for much more.

Your pic shows ideal round wire placement as u know rarely happens with the multi strand winding done by almost all manufacturers. The sloppy thin layers of wire in the motor slot space results in maybe 60 percent filled with copper and that pretty much equates to only 60 percent of the motor it could be as copper losses are far largest motor loss for us.

5% of $30k is $1.5k, I'd rather you have it given your history of being able to deliver so far. :slight_smile: And it seems Kickstarter gives close to zero protection? If you try and fail to deliver product, no refunds, right? As long as they don't think it's a complete scam?

I think for Raptor 2, Enertion did a small kickstarter for publicity, then drove traffic to their website for the bulk of purchases?

kickstarter brings more of an audience than a group buy.  it should pass their review and we submitted it.   

As far as risk, I've been selling motors for years, and these last motors there's 80 out there being tested for maybe the last year.  If I got the bucks im very tempted to go to china just to watch the main 2 machined parts coming out and assure all the tolerances are as they should be, but other than that I don't see risk.  its a jigsaw puzzle once the parts fit.

Well maybe im wrong, but i feel as though sleeves will definitely not be free or covered under that warranty since it'd be wear and tear that results in their failure, not manufacturing issues/errors. 
Similar to how you cant just contact BOA or TB or any wheel producer and request replacement wheels since yours have been run down by daily use.

the warranty doesn't cover the bearings or the tires but does cover all the rest of the parts.    They'll be sealed in the future.  

  on the kickstarter the replacement tires and wheels are 100 for all four but that's just the price for the time period on kickstarter to get some bucks hopefully out of the people who already have the motors.   we need to get to the goal and if we do the price will drop way down.  I think I told prices here to me for these and I said I wouldn't sell them for more than 15$ each.   I assure you that.  I think I might have even said 10$.  whatever I wrote before.  whatever will get you on board.

@murdomeek yea the cost is for the molds.   the 100 tires I got and are rolling now are Aend's "prototype run" and to get them to make them in the future they need to get the 100 molds made.   Pouring with only a few molds is much more time consuming.  We need 100 molds

They have beat you in multiple section's, world's hottest and most efficient hubs 🙃, best urathane category, they even have "liquid cooled technology" and they offer a higher chance of streetface (+99% multiplier if paired with unity) which is always good.

All with the bonus of short stiff wires, and warranty...

we don't have the old battles on here as we did before with Jason.  I wonder if he will let himself back on the forum.   I like to argue.  Jerry lasted like two threads with me in.

I wish I hadn't gone for the total 40,000 and it was very conservative in that it includes the mold cost, all the parts, and a huge amount towards paying others and an assumed 7 hours to make each motor.  The goal of 40,000 cant be changed....but there is the possibility of getting everyone's name off the kickstarter and writing them all, canceling the kickstarter, and then either putting up another at 30,000 goal and hopefully transfer everyone over.   Ooor there's the likely illegal method of ditching kickstarter with all the names and saving 5%.   just options and not saying id do either.  
I could get it done for  25,000$ even I think.  

conservatively 7.   think @evoheyax convinced me it was 6.    that's largely because its in my kitchen and toaster oven and goofy stuff.  takes half the time getting ready to do something and finding stuff and then reorganizing.  its a living place and I live with a bossy girlfriend who's way too clean.  the next design has some slight design changes to make it easier to assemble.

even with the hours to make the motor it would still be a good low price if it wasn't for that overhead expense of the tire mold.   the inner part of the mold is a machined shape that brings the mold cost up a lot, but once we have that its a much cheaper step away from getting bigger tires made and the outside of the wheel is an easy shape to make. 

**tires and wheels at 40$** that's something.  and with a lifetime warranty.  as if you didn't know before.

Quality takes time. Paying attention to the details so problems don't arise later. Those times don't take in to consideration the time it takes to bake the magnet epoxy or the motor winding epoxy, which are many hours more. Or we could just don't what some other manufactures are doing like not putting magnet glue in and not using any epoxy on the winding which would save hours of time. There's multiple reasons why these cost more, but I can assure you the profit margin is much lower than any other hub motor on the market.

Don't cancel and re-post.
If you really think you can do it for $25,000. Just "back" $15,000 yourself (as a single purchase).  And when the kickstarter is over, you can "refund" yourself on the back end system without any 5% fees penalty.  (I did that with my grip graphique kickstarter I did a few years ago ~$2000 worth)

I would recommend doing that early on, so it has the effect of "WOW! already more than half way!" to future potential backers

Might want to double check the "refund" trick with some kickstarter facebook support groups in case its been changed.

i mean, if you double check with kickstarter groups/forums (with people that have live kicksaters ended recently that can confirm).

WORSE case senario, you loose 5% of $15,000 which is $750.  And If you use a high cashback credit card, that drops down to ~$500-$550 loss in fees at WORSE case.

[/quote]

@hummie photo tips below.

It looks to me like blur from long shutter due to low light, and/or dirty lens. :) Wipe the lens and reshoot during daylight!

The photo 3rd from bottom, take those shots from the other side of the table, and black subject white background, the camera will try to average it out to grey (simplifying). If you're using a smartphone, try touching the screen where the deck is. That usually will tell the camera app to expose for the thing you touched (the black deck) and will brighten the whole image, bringing out the details in the dark grey hubs and the CF on the deck.

Touching the screen will also usually tell the camera app to focus on that point, which would help the 2nd photo.

I set to about 80 motor amps.  The maximum would be limited by the esc.  

I'd do a charge-only bms so ur not limited by bms but I only ever do 60 battery amps.  Even with 4 motors depending how heavy u are that's a peak battery discharge I think for a lot of people 

U need a battery that can do the battery amps u want.  Lipo makes it easy but a lot of people do 4 in parallel Panasonic 30Q cells and 12 or 10s. No one seems to do 11!

I might have, rolling resistance is still quite disappointing. It worked better on one side in the beginning for some time but now both sides are very resistant. How do I open them again? Remove the main axle screw and then the locking thing on the inside with that special tool? and then twist off the motor? I have the tools but I want to be sure ;)

  there was a period of learning and I compressed and also damaged a lot of bearings giving bad rolling resistance.    the resistance most likely comes from the c-clip giving axial compression and I have some that are a hair thinner that solves it.  that's likely the issue but there could be some other things and best to send them back and let me do it this time just to make sure its not something else that you wouldn't be able to do yourself. 

I put a bunch of different bearings in different people's motors, not knowing which are worth going with and to test, and most had a standard grease which only gets to 200f before it gets cooked out and that will ruin the bearing.  

I have a bunch of extra bearings and anyone who wants to send their motors back i'll put new in.

yes @s5300 the date on there is the date you've got to get the bucks in by.  And as I said ive got some family who will be throwing in a bunch to help me get to the 40k as well so we're getting there.

Hi @Hummie
what's the rolling resistance like on these, are they easy to push?
my only experience with hubs are some Verreal ones I got super cheap, I really liked how easy they coasted and pushed compared to my 2 dual belt set up,  but they lack that silky urethane feel!
```

---
## \#2485 Posted by: Hummie Posted at: 2019-07-31T21:10:43.135Z Reads: 187

```
we all want to roll as if on a regular wheel with just the resistance of the bearings and a hub motor or direct drive is as close as you will get to that but ….there's the unavoidable resistance produced by a magnet passing an electrically conductive material: eddy currents.   the stronger the magnetic field the more resistance that will be, so you can have a great easy roll, and ive felt that in some little hub motors or direct drives, but its at the expense of having a big airgap or weaker magnets.   
Also there's a want for high heat resistant grease filled bearings which is thicker and will also slow the roll and those are worth using if you planned to push power limits


interesting to me as I still don't have a good answer, is the idea of using more magnets and more stator teeth, and that producing less "cogging".  or indent torque.  but as far as ive read this is a no-net gain or loss torque and the magnet both pulls between teeth and then pushes so shouldn't actually be a coasting resistance.

I'd probably consider to change your marketing angle you should go for the fact that your setup is lightweight and you have smaller and wider wheels for a more stealth setup with excellent engineering and blah blah blah lifetime warranty.

I wouldn't directly compare your setup to the direct drive. As they are entirely different and most likely different customer base.

If that's how you prefer it. But consider...

There will always be people who have preferences.

Example - Boosted (Only urethane) vs Evolve (AT Tires). Difference besides all the common differences.

Result - You have people who like urethane some who like AT tires, etc.

If someone wants smaller wheels which the direct drive setup doesn't work with. I'd personally recommend the hummie hub setup.

From a customer view(in this case me), direct drive and hubs are totally different. 
If I want stealth,low profile,smaller wheels, wider contact, easier setup and free rolling ability I would go with hummie hubs cause they are the top quality hubs in the market.

On the other side, if I want free rolling ability, giant wheels like 110mm or 120mm or even pheumatics and still have the ability to switch wheels easily I would pick direct drive.

If I dont care about free rolling , low profile and prefer easy to replace parts I just go belt drive.

Would I buy 2 boosted board at the same time? no, its just duplicate. Would I buy both hubs and direct drive? Hell yeah.

Edit: stock is also taken into consideration.

Ok I'll clean it up n new photos n also get that 20k into it as that'll look good. 
But if any of u have photos or video that's good please post it here and I'll put it there. I'm out of material and my board is with chase for the moment in la.

Huge fan of Hummie Hub motors but mine deteriorated after the first season of use.  The motors are fine but the bearings in one of the wheels seems to have given out and is messing with the motor calibration.  I'm guessing there isn't an easy fix since the motors are glued to the axle?  I guess I just gotta join the kickstarter :)

You probably just have to send it to Hummie, although I don’t think he’d complain if you bought a new one ;). I had an early version and one of my bearings crapped a few weeks in so I sent it back and he fixed it. It’s been flawless since then(5months).

You need to get that 20k in there ASAP.

depends on your setup and circumstance, 80 kv at 12S should be around 4000 rpm(not factoring losses or sag), on 83mm wheels equals 62.6 km/h. 

so 45-50km/h should be in reach atleast.

51.2 km/h for 65 kv. So bit less there.

half way there!   we're gunna make it.

..and I have an awesome ...thing..i cant tell about yet till set in stone and i'll show you then.   ok it's the hanger.   looks like we'll be able to get it cast and then machined and pressed STRAIGHT precision axle.  and huge .  dare I say with fins or will I be sued.   the details on the look are being figured if you have any thoughts.  im partial to waffles but we go for most surface area we can pull off.   integrated wires.     gunna be a monster.   I have like 150 hangers of the old design but fuck those,..this is gunna really be a huge plus.

I don't have it done. Still looking at rediculous options like 20mm copper axle.  Was thinking maybe even with low-temp melt metal, and then could use a silicone mold and form shapes like nothing else.  So far not seeing a good substitute for aluminum.  

I read galvanic corrosion wouldn't be a problem with the 20mm copper rod in an aluminum casting as there's no electrolyte and sealed contact, although they do slightly mix even when way below coppers melting point, but with 20mm copper rod it's not an issue. maybe would warp from the casting. Going for straight of course. 

Would do the same mechanical design and fixing of the motor to the truck.

 The hanger would look like a Japanese art sea scene and all the waves would be potential to fit wet noodle 12awg.  All paths leading to front of baseplate.  Not hidden but squeezed into many options radiating out from the motor.  Could even have a wire coming out of the motor on the ground side and press it in so flush.  With a silicone mold no problem get that wire snap-in shape everywhere. 

I figure I have a couple more weeks and after Kickstarter there's a two week weight till I get the money, so seeing what can come up with.  Get the parts made in 6 weeks is pretty standard so possible to get done sooner too  Show u guys the design and see if ur into it.  It's all about changing the hanger. I'll update over there

But copper has no fatigue strength and only steel and ti do, so every stress is another step toward breaking no matter how big.   It would be as if making an axle from aluminum. Tempting but not worth that big downside.  There's other ways

Aha I think I understand you. The taper on the bushing seat is the same angle as the Paris and the last hanger and it's got the same amount of room for the bushing to be squished into when turning.  Actually I kinda wish the bushing was tighter held in there as I end up replacing the bushings to a harder duro to tighten the turning.

Almost done the luge

I did a quick test, 11s3p 30Q battery on unity on spud deck, and was not able to get much braking force at low or mid speed.

Weren’t u banned from this site at least twice now?  Rhetorical questions for people who might believe ur bullshit to think about


And ur problem:
I changed the motor design without ur consent (u somehow think u get to decide what I do), and u say I promised to put ur board together for u (actually I’m happy to help anyone put their board together if they bring it round and that wasn’t any special thing you got).   U still don’t have parts and last I remember ud written on here u were going to man-up when teased about it and were going to put it together yourself, no? I’m not going to build it for u.  U can send the parts and I will blow them up.   Quote me on that.

How many months are we going to have to hear ur sad story?  I know u were kicked out of the physics forum and ur stay and endless sphere didn’t go well...can’t u just keep it for ur girlfriend and dog cause I think we’ve had enough

Do that then and then they can get all the money then

Looking at the texts ..I was trying to get a built board under me for the ks video.  That’s what I’m talking about and it shows.  I didn’t have a complete deck or even motors to film and was looking to use yours.   I’d be more understanding if youd posted this before as ur reasoning that I owed u something and we could’ve got to the bottom of it.  , and if u hadnt tried to sabotage the ks and everything beyond.  Under the bridge now.

Do you really have nothing better to do? Seriously? If it'll end your rage, give me your parts and I'll put it together. This isn't a joke. You know John could sue you for sabotaging his company, right? I personally have never had anything against you Devin and I've always tried to understand your point of view. But what your doing is dirty and not right.

That photo though.... hahahaha.

Seriously, hit me up and I'll put your board together so we can put this BS behind all of us.

I'm saying send them to me, not him, and call this day. No one is blowing your parts up. It's that simple. You get what you wanted and the community can move on. How does this public shaming help anyone?

Dude, sometimes you can let things slide for a friend. If you hardline all the time you end up alone and bitter.
