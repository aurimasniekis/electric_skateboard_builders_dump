Hey there,
today i want to share my new tool with the community. But before we get started lets make a little Introduction:


----------

Currently there are three different apps for monitoring live data from the VESC:
1. [metr.at](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/configuration-and-telemetry-for-vesc-ios-android/13483) paid version for ios and android by @rpasichnyk 
2. [vesc vision](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/vesc-bluetooth-modules-for-sale-in-stock-again-app-finished-update/10422) free and open source version only for ios by @evoheyax 
3. [vesc monitor](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/extended-bldc-tool-with-watt-control-mode-ppm-cruise-control-individual-throttle-curve-and-android-app/12286) free version only for android by @Ackmaniac 




**Why did i developed this website?**
Because i have an android phone and did not want to pay another bluetooth module (i already have one) i decided to settle with vesc monitor. The only problem was a missing analyzing feature. Therefore i just made my own tool for analyzing the log data of the vesc monitor app

**What are the features of this analyzing tool?**
You can analyze your run much better and in greater detail!
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/0/7070ff86d332530babb30bc77946e686c5abb356.png" width="690" height="342">
<br>
If you want a more detailed view just **zoom** in the graph
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/3/0/301c9ed897c326e655520e2f1f39b094c243cc05.png" width="690" height="342">
<br>
If you cannot read the values for a specific time or do not know here you were at the given time just click in the graph on the desired position
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/f/4f192707bc9a1fcfad1e8e43c551ec427abe61b0.png" width="690" height="342">
the green line shows only the zoomed area of the chart! 
It works vice versa too! You can click on any part of the red line and you will see the position in the chart. If you have zoomed in the chart you can only click on the green line because it represents the zoomed time in the chart. However you can use the scrollbar at the bottom to shift the time frame. You can also reset the zoom by clicking on the button in the right: 'reset zoom'
<br>
<br>

you can **export** the shown graph (if zoomed you will export only the zoomed area!) as svg/png/jpg
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/0/c02cb321cf3443b101743c4f076be23d7ffa92fb.png" width="690" height="319">
<br>
<br>


you can **enable or disable** any graph you want for better analysis
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/d/7/d70ae2b31aa4c4ddc39534c7c113231b47bbad29.png" width="690" height="177">
just click on the legend item you want to enable or disable
<br><br>
you can **evaluate errors** and analyze why they might have happened
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/5/95e108b78a27a00f533f89f2fce0d8d17c0a6acd.png" width="690" height="251">
<br><br>
you can see what the **setup of the board** for this specific run was like
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/0/801be02b08eebdde260e9a690b681f5fc8a19ba4.png" width="300" height="150">
<br><br>
you will get a comprehensive list of **40 different** statistics
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/7/c7efdcc765dcf6bb65eb9b5b141dc554e9c3aba2.png" width="690" height="289">
<br><br>
You can swap the view between **metric and imperial** and even choose to have **movable or fixed map** (if it is movable the map moves when you go over the chart or zoom)
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/1/91adf8e953f98f5d7542681d65d75955e1449ddc.png" width="539" height="155">
<br><br>


----------

Now you gonna ask yourself what i will charge for this tool?
Nothing, it is for **free**! You can visit this tool from any browser! Just go to the webpage and upload a data log from your ride! The tool will automatically analyze the run and show you the result.
**Currently i can only support the logfiles of vesc monitor. I would love to support vesc vision but for that i would need a data log of his app. If someone feels free and can share a log i will integrate his format too!**

I put a lot of **sleepless night** with much coffee into this app and will provide it **for free**. So if you like feel free to place a little donation otherwise just use this new tool to improve the performance of your board ;)

if you want to see the tool live but do not have a log file yet just download this example logdata,

And the reason why would be, I'm using the other app also named "VESC Monitor"
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.solarturtle.vedder_monitor&hl=en

I use this because I don't have a ble adapter just bluetooth.

Because it requires ble not just regular bluetooth. Have to buy one of guess.

Just get a BLE module and use Ackmaniac's app.
I worked with Solartutle (Peter) for debugging/improving his app but he's silent since months now.
BTW I felt he wasn't really considering my feedbacks either. :pensive:

I finally had a ride to test both Ackmanic new firmware and then your website.
Your VDLA tool is so POWERFUL !

It really deserves a nice layout, instead of a simple button. ;)
I'll donate to keep you motivated with this wonderful project !

Next step : to be able to upload the csv file directly from the app :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Thank you for your work !

Uploaded a few hours worth of ride data so far - my thoughts:

* First off - awesome work. I've been using this a lot and it's really useful!
* When loading longer rides (30-60 min) it gets really laggy when viewing the data.
* Can't zoom if GPS data is missing from the CSV file
* Doesn't work properly with the "Speed_Unit" parameter on the CSV.  If I set the @Ackmaniac app to MPH units, it doesn't convert the GPS speed properly on the data logging site, but the wheel speed is fine.  If I set the app to kph and change your data logging site to mph that works.

Speed_Unit=1 (mph set in Akmaniac app)

Speed_Unit=0 (kph set in Akmaniac app)

CSV file doesn't change the values for wheel speed or GPS speed with that setting in the app, just the Speed_Unit flag it seems?

Did some more test rides yesterday, for science... ;-)

This time with a Trampenstein board (Trampa, Next and MBS parts), which I built for a friend.

2WD VESC 4.10 0,0005Ohm shunts, 12s, c6364 with hall sensors, 9" tires, 120A motor max / 120A battery max


peak power around 5kW

average at 20kmh on gravel: 300W
average at 30kmh on gravel: 600W
average at 40kmh on gravel: 1300W

average at 40kmh on grass: 1600W

average 50wh/km for shredding on grass

I am looking into Building a generator like that. If i find a way to do it without overloading my servers, i am happy to contribute it to the Community.

I also need to figure out how to be able to sync Video and Data properly, maybe @Ackmaniac needs to add a button in the app that visually(or by beeping) indicates and at the same time writes a sync timestamp to the file.

Edit:
Btw, do you prefer Text only overlays or do you want some sort of fancy graphs like the App itself does?
```

---
## \#33 Posted by: Ackmaniac Posted at: 2017-03-28T15:28:41.858Z Reads: 147

Or make a video directly with the app.

Well, my Phone does not record 4k, nor does it have an optical Image Stabilizer, nor do i have a proper mount for it. Your integrated Video fuction is perfect for quick shots, but the image quality is not that good due to the Smartphone Camera and missing mounting.

But what you could do (If you have a rooted device), is Injecting a green image Instead of real camera footage, record with the app and cut it togeteher afterwards. but that is not the cleanest method.

Edit:
Or maybe you want to implement a record to greenscreen option?
```

---
## \#35 Posted by: guyguy Posted at: 2017-03-28T15:40:28.044Z Reads: 147

```
Time stamp would be perfect and really easy to sync in post. Text is totally fine, having graphs and GPS would be awesome. Alternatively, something as simple as just having the VDLA playback in realtime where I could record the screen would work. Thats a good idea with injecting the green image - my phones is not rooted, but I think I can just  to pocket the phone, record, then crop out everything but telemetry for an overlay. Bit kludgy but it should work. 

@ackmaniac It's hard mounting the phone to record properly. The quality also isn't there. That and if I drop my phone while boarding there goes 700 bucks.

Would it be possible implement a "record to greenscreen" option where you do your normal recording stuff but use a green image instead of the camera image?

Somehow missed this thread in the past was wondering what this VDLA thing was people were referencing in a few other threads.  Regarding the stats curious why showing down to hundreths seems like tenths at most would be enough precision and can make the text bigger then (might also be worth grouping the max vs min stuff so wouldn't need to repeat max so many times in the view).  Looks good though will have to check this out at some point.

Motor max is actually written has Motor min.

Not a big deal, just a note if you would like to correct it.

P.S.: Is it possible to embed the results to a forum post. For example here, so others can also see it and analyse it ?
