I though it would be a neat idea to start a tips and tricks thread dedicated to sharing the little hacks, tricks, protips and the like that we've all picked up over time, and thus allow us to pool our knowledge and share solutions to common problems many of us encounter during builds.

In my quest to upgrade my current frankenboard with new wheels (which means I need new motor mounts too :/ ) I've come across a couple new things to keep in mind when making design choices that may save you a headache down the road.

Since I'm designing and making my own mounts from scratch, that means selecting the fasteners to hold everything together. This has led to some hair-tearing and general annoyance as I have made poor design choices and had to rethink them.

One thing that has become a major design rule that I now intend to live by is: **Use the strongest fasteners you can get your hands on.** Don't cheap out. grade 12.9 screws aren't that much more expensive than grade 8.8 screws, and they're far stronger.

A secondary part of that is: **Avoid using stainless fasteners unless you have to.** They're pretty and rust resistant, but they're a lot less strong than alloy fasteners. Metric stainless screws are about the equivalent of grade 5.5, which is less than half as strong as a grade 12.9 equivalent.

A third part is: **Use fasteners with the largest head/drive/socket you can.** For me, this means using socket head cap screws instead of button head screws, because for the same screw size, socket head cap screws have a bigger hex. This means they're far less likely to strip than button head screws.

I learned this the hard way, got two bolts on my mount (bolting to clamp) that are stuck there. I can't change the angle on that mount ever again lol.

Ooooo fasteners. I myself am upgrading the clamping piece to my mounts which will include 12.9 fasteners. Really though, I don't think anyone can strip an M6 cap screw that is A2 stainless. You would have to do something very very wrong, or use a massive breaker bar.

Get a set of "Wera Hex-Plus" wrenches, if you haven't already. They are excellent, and may even be able to remove a stripped screw (depending on the degree to which they are stripped)

Use a bench vice to clamp down on the hanger clamp, then tighten the screw. This only works if there are flat sides on it tho...

I beg to differ. A stainless screw is about 1/3 to 1/2 the yield strength of a 12.9 alloy one. I don't trust them at all.

Always over design. That mount that "should hold" or that battery connection that "probably won't disconnect" will end up doing exactly that. Save the stress and save money, and do it right the first time.

Plan to spend 4x your original budget...
Maybe. 
But never ever buy motor mounts or pulley kits that are less than htd3 and avoid using ebay for most things. And duct tape, have lots and lots of duct tape

I really really f. hate milling,grinding,sanding or whatever modification needed to make the damn thing work.
I had a "little clearance problem" when turning with one of my sk8. I put some metal sand paper on the motor and it self fixed.

Sometimes there's no need to drill the board. I used Velcro on my trampa for esc and battery.
i put a little bit of hot silicone at the borders so it does not move a mm. It resists vibrations and can be "almost" easily removed (you need to pull hard)

I waterproofed my bamboo using CorrosionX for the pcb and blu tack+plastidip that combination makes it really waterproof while it is really easy to remove and use again. I can open the enclosure and just pressing again the blu tack and a few hands of plastidip and it is ready again for a storm
Warning! notice the stupid crappy remote is wide open everywhere. Plenty of holes so this method is not realiable. just keep it under your sleeve.

plastidip needs at least 4 hands. let it cure for 30 minutes between every hand.

Blu tack and sugru are pretty much the same. Blu tack is softer and easier to remove and mold again therefore i prefer blu tack for that mod. Sugru is better for other kind of things.

You would think so, but I do it on a regular basis.  Its typically the repetitive tighten/loosen routine that gets them.  Stainless is pretty and great if you don't NEED to torque a bolt down, but if you gotta lay down on it to get whatever subrate to be still, stainless is gonna be an issue.

If you are going to 3D print your enclosures, buy a roll of fiber tape and reinforce the inside of the enclosures.  It will strengthen your enclosure a lot and there is no risk of splitting apart.

Another tip: take some time and look through the websites of 3m, loctite and permatex. They have so many different types of glue, sealant, threadlocker, bearing retainer, etc that it makes sense to familiarize yourself with them. And get a couple bottles, because threadlocker is always *always* a good idea.

New tip: Get some high quality drill bits, and use a good cutting oil when drilling metal. I spent today at work making 1/8" holes through 1/2" pieces of mild steel. I did over 150 with a single drill bit, and it still looks good as new. If I were to use the usual Chinesium drill bits I have at home, I would have broken like five.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/c/2c0f6abf5b635a50ec99b74654386e702a0a8c60.jpeg" width="301" height="500">

Afraid of battery fires?...
This won't stop thermal runaways but it will delay the cascade allowing you to potentially ditch just the battery or worst case the whole board. This is fantastic if some auxillary component in your enclosure ignites, if insulated with this, it will stop the fire and prevent spreading to the battery.

I don't know if potting with it is a good idea..it would explode out of whatever it's in when the sealant expands. I've found it best used to isolate components, around main connections. Something has to catch fire for it to "work"

This might be good for wrapping a pack or lining an enclosure

  `An easy-to-dispense, non-asbestos, inorganic material designed to be used as an alternative packing material to mineral wool, fiberglass and backer rod in through-penetration firestop systems. With excellent strength and flexibility characteristics it is an ideal through-penetration packing material.

Installation-friendly material is easy-to-dispense and its compact packaging is optimized for portability. The smooth-textured woven material can be torn by hand, eliminating the need for a knife. 3Mâ„¢ Fire Barrier Packing Material PM4 material is less irritating to the skin when compared to conventional mineral wool. Meets International Building Code (IBC) and other key life safety building codes. Also meets International Residential Code (IRD) as a stand-alone fireblocking material.`

-Get the angle of baseplate you want, not a wedge riser, it feels better. 

-Don't be cheap on wheels.

-Clean your bearings every 50-100mi to keep them fast

-Wax is your friend, pack your pivots and bushings with cheese grated wax. Feel the steez, feel the surf, none of the binding, none of the noise

-bearing or pulley pullers or arbor press to remove stuck on motor pulleys, pull from the ass of the pulley not the middle. If you can't get behind the pulley, undo the motor shaft set screws, pull the shaft out with the pulley then press the pulley off. Boom nothing is destroyed and its reusable. 

-nose guards on vertically laminated bamboo, yea I know you dont care your nose gets bashed up, but bashed up noses on vertical bamboo is asking to split your board down the middle

-if you have a board that is known to have wheel bite, wider trucks > risers. Keep that center of gravity low and increase the width of your truck instead of using risers for fitment, wider = more stability, narrow = more divey... (Similar to tkp vs rkp of the same width truck)

-bullets, once you know your good, separate your bullets in your build slide some heat shrink over them and then heat shrink them together to keep from vibrating apart.

-when you get a charger, and your setting up your board with a BMS. A lot of the times the chargers put out their "rated voltage" with no load, but it doesn't account for the Batteries Internal Resistance while loaded. Before assembling your board, allow your battery to charge to the max the charger will do, ensure your BMS hits all the cells balance voltage, and ensure that with the charger connected you are reaching your charge voltage, if not adjust the pot so the battery reaches charged voltage while the charger is plugged in, this will ensure your BMS ALWAYs hits balance voltage and your not just guessing did it balance. Know before you bolt up your enclosure

-hard bind your remotes, and set failsafes properly! Don't trust an autobind.

I'm sure I have more..just can't think of any ATM...
