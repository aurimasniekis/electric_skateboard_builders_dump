Just trying to gauge some interest here. Looking at making affordable high wedged risers out of solid aluminum. First one I want to make is 35Â°. Design is simple, just reached out for quotes so I'm waiting to hear back to give a price number. 

**Assuming a reasonable price** What sizes would you be interested in? Feel free to select more than one.

[poll type=multiple min=1 max=8 public=true]
* Less than 15
* 15
* 20
* 25
* 30
* 35
* Greater than 35
* Adjustable Option (More Expensive, Slotted Stops)
[/poll]

Thanks for the input. Need a demand to light a fire under my ass and get back to prototyping. Flagged first post because I F'd something up and it wouldn't let me edit it.

Also, thoughts on old school vs new school?

Why choose when you can have both?

Shit, it's not like I'm making it or anything right? Stupid question, I'll make holes for both.
