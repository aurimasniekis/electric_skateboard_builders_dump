any of you good at it?  I have a drawing I cant alter.  a slight chage or two on 2d and 3d drawings.

I figured how to do a change to the 2d drawing but need to change it to 3d.  thanks for your help but don't know how to do a screen shot.   is it possible you could tell me how to change the 2d into a 3d?  maybe I have to build it all again with the new dimensions..extruding and stuff?

I think what you are looking for is the "finish sketch" button with a green check mark on it

You have to extrude your shapes to get 3D.

So you started with a 2d sketch? Then finnish sketch, and extrude it in xyz to make a 3d

I started with a drawing and friend helped me ...but now I need to change two or three things.  I figured it out on the 2d, at least it has the right numbers on it but didnt' change the shape.  the 3d...I don't want to have to do the too much and rather just change the dimensions on what I have already
don't know how to do a screen shot

I'm feeling more private about this than the past (yet here on a public forum asking for help I know)..but if one of you give me your email...I think I could include you.  i'm inching closer to figuring it out after 4 hours.

don't know windows snipping tool.  I just got a new 300 dollar computer.  I rarely use it for anything technical.

id love to learn fusion360 just not right now as I'm in a rush to just get this part done

Your 3D part should change shape when you change the dimensions in the sketch.

but I think he went to sleep or I sucked all the juice out of him already and I have to convert from 2ds to 3.  do I have to go through every dimension and extrude?  seems a lot of work and I thought maybe there was a better way?

No that's the way to go :) you can extrude multiple sketches at the same time to the same dimension tho

this is the old version in 3d but the new version is very similar but I only have it in 2d.

will it produce 3d from the 2d instantly?  chutney said it would and it did happen for me before.  definitely don't want to do it all dimension by dimension

missing the axle that comes out 30mm from the hanger but otherwise these are all the mechanical parts of the motor
I gave you a heart chutney and then pulled it back!  didn't know you could do that.  you can suck them back again and give as many as you want, better than the real world.

hum I cant get the heart back again

ok last question that's loosely related to esk8:  how do you export from 360 to the computer so you can email drawings?

figured it out.  I like to ask and then I figure it out right away.  having someone looking over your shoulder gets the mind going

I like it a lot but I'm too impatient to learn from the videos.    
the manufacturer is going to want 3ds and I would really like to learn how to do them instead of having someone do it for me.  2d is easy after maybe 10 hours and a million random buttons pushed.    if there was a simultaneous approach we could do such as even talking through it over the phone I'm really interested in doing that tomorrow night if youre up for it.    IF you live in the bay area I'd come to you and get you dinner and drinks.

The best part of Fusion 360 is free for non-commercial entities/hobbyist and the simulation of parts. I made the strongest longboard hangers with the simulation data.

I never heard bear broke there but makes sense being just that aluminum nub having to take so much. but all the nubs on trucks are pretty much the same size it seems.  maybe there's are longer?

   I was just thinking about the nub and how it has to take a lot of stress on an eboard much more so with the torsion of the axle.  I found my nub cups get worn and so do the bushings.

Don't believe me. Comment Boy delivers. This part replacement hanger was simulated with 50 kN on that blue circle. Material simulated from fusion 360 library was 6061-T6 cold formed.The test is the nonlinear static stress.

This is way beyond the expected forces.

Safety factor. I know the pivoting nose is likely to fail as demonstrated by the bear truck company. It passes my needs.
https://i.imgur.com/m3yDWJM.png?1

Displacement is at most 0.875mm.
https://i.imgur.com/vo3xgVt.png?1

Edit: I have to fix this comment. THIS NOT ITS FINAL FORM.
Edit 2: It's fixed. Either way. This is a very strong hanger, or I'm doing something wrong in the simulation.
Edit 3: Zero intentions of producing some by CNC. It has to be made by CNC for precision.

At most no need of a mount if you have one with inserts. The insert is the only thing to supply for existing mounts.

I have inventor which is from autodesk, so maybe this trick works also in fusion360 : 
Sometimes the extrude function doesnt work because the 2d sketch is still an "open loop". To fix this there is a "close loop" function (righ click on the 2d sketch) that fills your 2d sketch with the missing points between lines and curves.
This usually solves all of my extrusion problems.

Bro Iâ€™m sorry but I had to go to school, I woke up at 5am to see if I could finish it for you.  I have the nut file almost finished if you still want it but I basically had to recreate the entire sketch from the pdf dimensions, thatâ€™s why it took so long.  Once again Iâ€™m sorry I couldnâ€™t help

so many people helped me over the last couple of days.  I really could've screwed it up.  Minim also is a wiz on the fusion..maybe you guys all are and that's what the kids are doing these days for fun. 
I think they will send two before another Chinese holiday on the first of October.  very happy with this design...as I keep saying.  then will have 100!

 but more so this was a rough draft and the half spheres are not lined up exactly with the rest of the groove. if you have a good way.![Capture|690x222](upload://tC7OSzmOMTXJiywz6mPoFB3Z7wU.JPG)

I'm not 100% sure I understand the issue..but you have the timeline under the drawing and can edit each scetch/drawing at any time. 
This looks to be some sort of a battery box.. Fillet would be a better option than a sphere
