@Titoxd10001 It actually was really impressive no lie. Hacksmith is a really fun channel to follow.  He's making an iron man flying suit. 

@Michaelinvegas .....of $1449.99  Those Dr. mad thrust motors are expensive

I understand why he has his arms like that now I thought he was trying to fly but it's for his fingers don't get chopped off lol

Wait, Isn't it he who is jet powered and not the board? Should be "Jet powered man on a long board".

Title is misleading, It's not jet powered, those aren't jet turbines, they're EDF motors (electric ducted fan).  

It's not every efficient either, 9 kilowatts and only 35mph?

Pretty cool gadget, but for how smart this guy seems, he doesn't seem to have the brains to protect...his brain. I like how he says he doesn't know how to ride, then almost streets his face, and then tells us all how dangerous Lipo batteries can be, not even mentioning what an idiot he is for not wearing a helmet and damn near cracking his head open. I don't get it. It's not that hard.

I like the idea, but not how this guy implemented it. Turbines (more like edf) strapped to the board could be fun, and braking would probably be smoother and less taxing on the esc (and no regen to ruin your freshly charged batteries).
Also less parts that wear down from friction like chain/belt, sprockets/pulleys, drive wheels (my drive wheel always wears down faster than the other wheels).

They are very inefficient though....

I'd be more impressed if he integrated the edf motors into the board.     I bet any esk8 forum member can build what he built if they had $1000-$2000 to burn, it's just HK edf motors, lipos, controllers strapped to a belt. lol

You can set the edf to reverse in order to brake, but I doubt it would work too well (due to the pitch of the impellers).

I doubt he could have done that.  Every planes, heli, multirotor, boat esc i've seen doesn't have reverse.

Fan propellers are shaped in a specific way to work in one direction, so reversing the fans, with custom firmware or not, to act as brakes won't work.

Someone needs to bolt these things onto a brakeboard. I'd try it if I had the money.

@photorph this could potentially satisfy your need for speed and also need for brakes! Lol
