# Introducing the *AVIO* mini remote v.1!

**This is a mini remote mod!**

I've been wanting to do something about the mini remote for 2 years but have always been procrastinating to do so. Now, 11 e-skates in and 10 non-modded mini remotes later, I have finally decided to design my very own mod.

What this mod aimed to do:
* A smaller form factor (26mm max thickness)
* Use LiPos instead of AA batts for ease of charging
* Increase throttle throw by about 50%
*Throttle ranged increase from 1.04 - 1.95 to 0.85 - 2.10*
* Hide the pesky trim knobs
* To be an idiot-proof mod for just about anyone to do

Here's how it looks and how it compares to the mini. I can finally say my "mini" remote is actually mini now!

**Please do not PM me to ask me for the .STL files (I've received way too many PMs on this already..) I will release them in due time, when I'm done with testing it. I will also release a "how-to" guide once it's all ready.**

What Version 2 shall aim to achieve: This version will take as least 2 to 4 months before I release it.)
* Acrylic clear backing for the LED
* TPU printed plug for the bind button
* Include a battery indicator (aim to use an arduino micro/pico or something similar)
* Same form factor (possibly slimmer?)
* 2 Versions, v.2-S and v.2-L (Short and Long)
* Any other things i should add? (This remote is meant to be a basic remote, nothing too fancy i.e. "telemetry" as I want to keep the small form factor as its selling point.)

That's the Wemos d1 Mini batt shield PCB that acts as a  3.3v regulator + charger. I like it cause it's cleaner than adding a tp4056 + 3.3v regulator.

Yup, downside of having it be small, the grip style @deucesdown is such that only 3 fingers will be holding the remote with the little finger supporting the bottom.

I also made a longer version that's 30mm longer for people who may want it.

I hear the AA batteries argument alot about the mini remote but iv a genuine question! Why not just use rechargeable AA batteries instead of a lipo? 

Surely that would be a much simpler and cheaper rechargeable solution for the mini?

[/quote]

The lvc for the mini is a bit too high, so fully charged eneloops only last like a week or two. Pisses me off. I'm using a lipo with a diode to drop the voltage a bit (thanks @SkaterBoy58). With basically a 1s bms with microusb charging. It would give comfort to run at 3v vs 4.3v.

Rechargeable AAs have a lower norminal voltage than your standard AAs. Once they drop below the threshold to power the remote, it stops working, and this happebs really quickly. I.e: you actually have to recharge those AA batts v.often. also, it's a hassle to remove the batts since the cover is secured with a screw. A rechargeable LiPo solves it all!

Last question, I promise :) That 3v3 pin is regulated 3.3v?

EDIT found some reviews. I only skimmed mostly because I'm too n00b so it takes a lot of energy to understand this stuff. Doesn't have low voltage cutoff protection, but that's kind of expected. It seems like there's a boost to 5v then an LDO 5v -> 3.3v (maybe). Still, cool new toys! I guess I'd measure the parasitic drain before putting it away in a drawer.

Ah ok gotcha, rechargeable aa's would still be a cheaper in the long term than buying standard aa batteries i guess  but a lipo is obviously the best solution.

Yeah, i was looking at it too, doesn't seem like it has a 3.3v regulator, always assumed it did haha. Oh well, thanks for pointing that out, looks like it's back to tp4056s for this.

It may be cheaper in the long run, but having to charge your batts after every 2 rides is kind of a bummer ):

[/quote]

I think it does? The schematic in the first link I think is for something else with a similar circuit. The second link says:

[quote]
* Leaving 17mA for the D1 mini. The LDO RT9013 drops that to 3.3V (still 17mA)
[/quote]


[quote]
The efficiencly is obviously improvable (going from >3.3V to 5V and then to 3.3V again for the ESP8266).

@deucesdown Hmm, i just hooked it up and tested it, could only get 5v, but nothing from the 3v3 rail.

Edit: i think he means that the rt9013 is on the d1 mini, not the shield.

Looking st the schematic the shield really does only have a Vout of 5v.

Do you think the remote can handle straight 3.7 (4.2 max) from a lipo? The 4.2 max might not be too much for the board.

[quote="ChicagoSkater, post:25, topic:72074"]

4.2v works, but might be stressing the components, and burn out at some point. The diode trick:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mini-remote-upgrade/51991

Ugh up above I was talking nonsense for voltages. 4.2v full lipo. diode typically drops 0.7v, so 3.5v at full charge. I use the board mmaner linked above. The only problem is the charge rate is a bit fast, want to change the resistor to do maybe 250ma instead of 1000ma. Maybe there are variants with a pot instead of a resistor.

[quote="davewood1982, post:27, topic:72074"]
, how often do you find your recharging them?
[/quote]

After I put in a tiny lipo, I think I could charge once a year, riding 35 miles per week. Twice a year to be safe :) But actually lipos hate being at full charge or empty, so I try to keep it around 3.8-3.9v.

LOVE IT! So stoked on this and have a spare mini remote laying around I used for one ride and not since due to the shape and ugliness. Will you also be posting links to the other parts and a quick directions guide for us non electrical people to be able to figure it out once you test it and post the STL files so we can print and make one too I hope?

You rock brotha, thanks so much! Been waiting for something like this for what feels like a lifetime.

Don't mean to bug or anything either but do you have just a rough guess on when you'll have enough testing on it and feel comfortable making it available to the community by chance....? I mean are you thinking a week or two, a month, much more/less than that...? I know I've got my PayPal account alerted to send you a tip to say thank you as soon as you do so lmk if you don't mind.

Thanks again and keep up the good work my dude! Will be waiting every so patiently to hear new updates.

Filling and sanding the cases. The logo was a bit harder to sand so a craft knife and a flat needle file would be great. ![20181029_070751|690x388](upload://8x4BwRRIu9AFfJeth5n1hyXcGPb.jpeg)

Long version added - Removed my logo cause I couldn't get it to look good on the long version ):

Will probably work on the instructions this weekend.

Err...! I worked on three at a time and i'd say i spent about 5 hours to get all surfaces smooth with the body filler. Then a coat of primer to bring out any imperfections the eye can't see before spray. Then i wet sand with 400 grit, and one more coat of primer. Add them all up, it should take no longer than half a day for one remote. That is, if you want to get it really smooth, but it's purely for aesthetics.

Hi @nuttyjeff,

Could you please add a lanyard hole at the bottom corner closest to the micro USB port?

I think it may help if we ever get into an accident.

Cheers,

30AWG to 24AWG wires. (Min of 2 different colours)
And of course, the remote casing. Refer to the first post of this thread for the download link to print.

![20181216_200457|690x388](upload://8Ogag4kPtPgFh3fSQnKkDE1wPy9.jpeg) 

Ok let's go.
First, remove your screws from the mini remote and open it up
KEEP THE SCREWS
![20181216_200623|690x388](upload://gqNbxCbbhT9iyxgqO8dUoXhESyI.jpeg) 

You're gonna need this![20181216_200657|690x388](upload://zefBcGXO3ID0lcrywUZoEvRdePp.jpeg) 

Cut these two wires that connect to the AA batteries. ![20181216_200709|690x388](upload://qmxnVja2q9MoLlGn6rwZAVxeCQT.jpeg) 

There we go, now let's remove more stuff.
![20181216_200752|690x388](upload://cP6SxGFMthBbAp7QXymOXUvzB2M.jpeg) 

Take this lever off, so it won't fly out and go under your bed which you will never find forever![20181216_200811|690x388](upload://bDPeiBDvRrOBQqtzu6LJNu7gc1I.jpeg)

 Remove the two screws here that attach the trigger to the casing![20181216_200832|690x388](upload://9BbNID7U2CwyKANpA0F5UkQJuS1.jpeg) 

![20181216_201002|690x388](upload://fzepzD5qkQ8mGwsRCZfcrTp60Ya.jpeg) 

Then, cut or desolder these three wires that connect to the steering knob of the mini remote, we do not need that.![20181216_201101|690x388](upload://ArixbudH5v0bTc104BY2n9u9Wqk.jpeg) 

Okay! That's all that we need from the mini remote. Now you can toss the casing in the trash :rofl:![20181216_201403|690x388](upload://z2XHAYAyvlFNbj5IhgJC8t4aIl4.jpeg) 

Okay now onto the regulator. You need to desolder and pull out all three pins. I did it by having the solder on the other side of the pin, once the solder iron melts, i tilt and twist slightly till the pin comes loose and eventually comes out. This one's tricky so take your time with it. ![20181216_201445|690x388](upload://3LQ6JM1BlcYp0yEJGM3m0BZd14C.jpeg) 
![20181216_202722|690x388](upload://u03D5oMOTBLpTrlKNlFq3U0f5dm.jpeg) 

Once that's done, you can solder the wires from the mini remote PCB in this fashion to the regulator. Red goes to OUT, and black goes to GND. Do note that the wire needs to be long enough for the regulator to extend past the PCB, so do resolder a longer wire if needed![20181216_210249|690x388](upload://hwhmYvERMyDYFziiQeO9nGaRksA.jpeg) 

Now, flip the regulator over to the other side. Have a new black and red wire that's about 40mm long, cut shorter if needed later. Solder the black one on GND as well, but this time it's below. ![20181216_211333|690x388](upload://vzJvmvhmQliqdiMvek9CjiRpcwN.jpeg) 

The red wire goes on VIN, but on the underside as well. ![20181216_211459|690x388](upload://9IFc47rQ6xeDgZlfDbmxgct8wvZ.jpeg) 

You should end up with this![20181216_211547|690x388](upload://eDwX5AqzcjhmqqsNfJ3HOlPyvAl.jpeg) 

The red wire will go to OUT+ of the micro USB PCB, and the black goes to OUT-![20181216_212211|690x388](upload://fBglaMrvBjtgfPLtZfyftesjobw.jpeg) 

And finally, the battery. I had mine with the wire on the bottom left![20181216_212507|690x388](upload://Au6zU8jIl6IMbbxPgAoUgEQrFyF.jpeg) 

The red wire of the battery goes on B+, and black goes to B-
![20181216_213420|690x388](upload://zaoCqBYapMkLkEFFh6Nq2EUJs7R.jpeg) And finally, use a plier to crush this LED bulb as it'll stay on and drain your battery.  ![20181216_213548|690x388](upload://uJo3v1fFhirSLaS3nL3O3AwWTqH.jpeg) 

SNIP SNIP![20181216_213604|690x388](upload://toSuMCneJmbF1tunz9OzoQu1WOA.jpeg) 

And we have power!![20181216_213646|690x388](upload://tfh0t59uFMdRmpNVeCZlEBiuEFg.jpeg) 

Now we are done with the electronics, next thing is to install it into the remote casing. ![20181216_214032|690x388](upload://pJjy2FqFJZ3DggdZ7G9X144Skjt.jpeg) Conformal coated all my PCBs.![20181216_214755|690x388](upload://lNDSgsHmXREl5fl8hrmLWLpu3Kw.jpeg) 

I also hot glued most of the solder joints to give it a bit of strength.

Now you can double side tape the battery to the bottom of the case, and also use foam tape or double side tape to paste the PCB on top of the battery. ![20181216_221804|690x388](upload://m2Ie3pN5rdOrBcFkMIuynon8bRf.jpeg) 

It might sit lower so use a foam tape that's 1mm thick to lift it up, and align it well with the hole.![20181216_221810|690x388](upload://yXE7m5lmbIhFCsmlPWaqn3Qa1W3.jpeg) 

Next, hot glue the mini remote PCB and push it all the way to the edge of the casing and make sure the switch goes into the hole of the new casing as well. Remember to hot glue the regulator PCB down to prevent it from rattling as well. ![20181216_222125|690x388](upload://ag4RzYkqlBElV6gUSy0mmXZ9iFc.jpeg) 

Next, you need to snip of a bit of these two knobs. **NOT ALL,** just about half or so. This is to prevent the other side of the casing hitting it and making it impossible to close the casing due to the height. 
![20181216_222842|690x388](upload://gYSEYFRvAmw3ideh1kBufoP48Kw.jpeg) ![20181216_223126|690x388](upload://uoysXXNLiay3RFeQN8a4kuRhKyU.jpeg) 

Once that's done, use the existing screws from the mini remote previously and screw them onto the new casing. You didn't throw the screws away did you?![20181216_222328|690x388](upload://h56bHdZ6MHhzpEl4ABhNCsRsO7p.jpeg) 

Install the lever back as well with the spring.![20181216_223655|690x388](upload://79cBtKKZdu02sbAbPL8JKmUNjQL.jpeg) 

And should everything be done properly, it should look like this! The short version basically has lesser length but there's still plenty of room. So the long one has A LOT of room haha. 

Wire management is pretty good if done well. But hey it's gonna be inside, never gonna be seen but that's how i do things. ![20181216_222931|690x388](upload://ex9YAcg704gWPzjAcuDg3UfZAG0.jpeg) 

Place the top casing on, and use the existing mini remote screws, and plop four of them into the screw holes.
![20181216_223723|281x500](upload://23o4nqE13bGSmrDHFtu6gV5kCaQ.jpeg) 

Success! Now what's left to do is to do the VESC set up and all that jazz. It's ready to use! For binding, you will need to use a small screw driver to press the button inside, or untill Jeff creates the STL for the long button plug.![20181216_223942|690x388](upload://ukb4q91szgD30N24X68erLZQfTZ.jpeg) 

And that's the end of it. You should have a remote that works. Please follow the steps from start to finish in order. The first one i did, i started with the battery and went up, basically doing it in reverse. I sorta ruined one of the PCBs and Jeff had to fix it for me. 

Do let us know if you have any further questions and we'll do our best to answer!

would this work instead of the vaultage regulator your using ? if I set the output to 3.3v as its pretty much the same as what you using but this one is verable. I'm asking as I already have these and it will save me having to wait for the ones your using to be delivered :) Thanks

I decided to put a 1500mah lipo in mine it fits perfectly inside the 'long version'. I've also added 2 buttons which I'm going to solder where the steering pot was so when I click them it gives a high/low value which I will then set up an arduino on the receiver to make the stearing (now 2 buttons) act as indicators for my board so it has in indicators. I also have an arduino wired between the receiver and VESC to read the throttle value and turn on a break light when I start to break . ALSO I have programmed both arduinos to flash all the LEDs if the controller dissconects to act as hazard lights just incase My controller was to die or lose connection. 

If anyone wants my arduino code ,` wiring diagrams and my edited remote case I'll be happy to help. as soon as its complete I will post photos on here .

This is awesome. You can add an array of buttons to do arbitrtary commands (by defining ppm range), like horn, smoke screen, oil slick, turbo, eject.

yes I know but I'm only going to be using 2 just as a test to make sure it works correctly and then once I have tested it I will improve the designs of the controller to add more buttons for more stuff and improve the arduino code to allow for expantion. once finished I would like top have around 8 - 10 buttons and the design files for them  . E.g if you wanted a controller with only 4 buttons I would be able to send you a folder with the 3D printable controller STL with space for 4 buttons, the arduino codes and the wiring diagram.

just so everyone knows these don't work I've tried 4 incase they was broken or fauly . when you set the voltage to 3.3v it for some reason doesnt let it power on. I tested it with normal AA battaries and it works fine but as soon as I use a lipo with this regulator it doesnt allow it to power on :/ hmmm I'm going to go ahead and buy the ones the creator recomended..

Hi, I really like the Avio mini version, for the form factor. My only concern is about the handling space. Do you feel the remote secure in your hand while using it? I ma afraid that my last finger won't fit on the remote handle because the trigger needs to go all the way down towards the remote body. Do you have some picture showing it in your hand?

Thanks a lot!

There's a pic in the first post.

I designed the mini (shorter) version for people who use a "claw grip"? like me. I hold the remote with just 4 fingers - my middle and ring finger lightly presses the remote against my palm.

The longer version was released after i received several PMs asking for a longer form factor, and also partly due to me realizing that not everyone has the same grip stype that I do. (:

Let me know when you can and greatly appreciate it. 

Directions were great BTW, I am not very DIY and just taught myself to solder in December and did just fine following the step by step guide. Was fun to do as well for my first little build.

Thanks again and LMK on a longer 3d print you can send me.

Poor range and interruptions.... any interruption on a board that can kill you or break your arm/leg/face in less than one second if malfunctioning is dangerous!

That’s why I’ve liked the mini remote so far... excellent range and never hiccups. I bought a ...designed net remote but honestly... it’s sucks and a thumb control remote doesn’t work for a high power board

I update the files fairly frequently (especially if someone were to point out a design change that i find beneficial! :D)
It's safe to download the most recent ones, have made about 10 sets of the recent versions already :D

Battery indicator added. Will upload the updated files and the link for the extra PCB in due time..

For those who have already printed the casing, you need only print the top casing if you want this feature. The bottom casing remains the same.

Hi @nuttyjeff

Any chance you could implement this to check voltage?

# Instructions:

1. Slot the battery indicator into the insert as shown below. Secure it into the slot with 2 screws (highlighted in blue). Any black screws used in the Mini Remote will do.

**Note:**
* Use a small nylon washer/nut between the screw and the 3d print. If not, ignore using the screws and simply use hot glue to secure it to the print. It works!

![image|614x500](upload://oeimFuZPcEJXc930msRZjw8257q.jpeg)  

2. Solder 2 wires to the positive and negative terminals of the battery indicator and connect them in parallel to your battery, (+ve connects to +ve, -ve connects to -ve). 

**Note (Optional):**
* You can simply solder them onto the inputs of the TP4056A pcb where your battery connects to!

3. Press the button on the cover to read the battery level of the remote! 

4. Enjoy! It should look like this from the outside:

Also, I've been receiving PMs in the last few months from people wondering if I sell these, and... yes, I do! I've just not been openly advertising this due to concerns on personal time constraints - It takes quite abit of time to paint and mod each remote from a Mini to an Avio remote.

However, after making over 20 of these bad boys, I've gotten rather efficient in this. So, for everyone else who wants to get their hands on this remote, I am openly now selling them on a build-to-order basis. *I will order the SLA covers and required components in batches based on the orders i get from time to time. The lead time for these remotes will hence vary from 1 week to 3 weeks, depending on shipping times.*

---

The price of the remotes are:
* **$67.5usd** for the Long Remote.
* **$62.5usd** for the Short Remote.

*The price stated covers PayPal fees and free intl.shipping*

---

Remotes will be printed in SLA, not FDM which makes for a much better surface finish and also painted in a multitude of colours of your choosing, including:

* Flat black
* White
* Pearl white
* Candy red
* Metallic red
* Hotrod red
* Candy blue
* Crystal blue
* Silver
* Truck-Bed Liner (+$10 usd)

One last question hopefully:

So my mini remote power switch snapped off a while back as they're prone to do. I was going to steal a similar, 5-pin switch from an old nano-x when I noticed this.

**2 pins on the MINI pcb's switch are soldered together**

![image|281x499](upload://7lWJFhMJnTm4NGrrDxHqxkIwfBl.jpeg) 

**They are not soldered together on the nano remote, switch looks identical**
![image|281x499](upload://nwJYpeaJQA4kXLaBoR1CBOVa6Gy.jpeg) 

Can anyone confirm if these 2 should be tied together or not on their Mini's pcb?

I modified my mini remote a few weeks back using the enclosure and parts from Jeff. I forgot to share the pics so let me make it up now.

![IMG_1719|666x500](upload://v407gz1uJyYv0hOBIuVZzmc1uHQ.jpeg) 

![IMG_1723|375x500](upload://BazpZiTqDAiiXVYZGH46yRm1W9.jpeg)

I actually didn't like the enclosure at first. It felt too small and kept slipping off my hand. Then I figured I could hold it like this and control the throttle with my middle finger:

![IMG_1842|359x500](upload://p1w5flpS1cGM1JnbKtifof0cQ7F.jpeg) 

That works really well for me. I'm very happy with the mod so far.

Battery indicator would be a nice addition, but I believe the battery lasts really long so if I don't forget to charge it here and there all should be good.

Are there any bike brake handle shaped remotes?  I haven't seen one but I feel they would have good control if you've got chunky gloves on

I have a few designs I was playing with but I'm not an electronics master quite yet so I would only have the shape and functionality to offer.

Actually incorporates the spring thumb button too haha.

Well, the mini remote was running on 2xAA batts before, and I simply assumed that was what the components on the PCB were designed for, approx 3V. I have never tried it without the regulator, and probably won't. haha.

No clue.. with the batt indicator now, it's much easier to tell when I have to charge it, so i'd just charge it when it has 2 bars left.

Maybe someone else who did the mod can tell you.

I decided I need the battery monitor, so I went ahead and modified my modified remote. :smile:

![IMG_1979|282x500](upload://cNRPgwNh2QL1CbpRscMlldSGsQr.jpeg) 

It doesn't really win a lot of points for sexiness but it works and is not in the way when holding the remote.

![IMG_1980|375x500](upload://9KfryuQMZpUb0IrI1M20OzaggJA.jpeg)  

Here's the [monitor thingie](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32921127212.html). It has cost me $1.85 shipped, which I consider a reasonable investment for preventing a dead remote because that can be a rather [unpleasant experience](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words-2/88821/808?u=janpom). :laughing:

Not sure if this question is directed at me, but I don't use a claw grip with the mini version haha, i use the same grip as the long version. The only difference is that my little finger doesn't wrap around the remote.
