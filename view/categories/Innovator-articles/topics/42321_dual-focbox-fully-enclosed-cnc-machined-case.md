As many have requested, today we started working on dual FocBox CNC machined case. Here are some early prototype pictures. This is only single case as the reference to figure out all the holes and design needed, later on, it will made into a dual case.

Thanks for @banjaxxed for providing Focbox as a reference for the design.

**Update:**

We finally finalized the pricing and models for:

* Single FocBox case without fins (26mm height) 30‚Ç¨ + shipping
* Dual FocBox case with fins (31mm height) 50‚Ç¨ + shipping
* Dual FocBox case without fins (26mm height) 40‚Ç¨ + shipping

We currently collecting pre-orders to know how much we would need to manufacture for the first batch. A pre-order will be you will have to pay 5‚Ç¨ for confirmation that you going to buy it. Then we finish you will get 5‚Ç¨ coupon code to deduce 5‚Ç¨ you paid from the final price.

Pre-order is needed so we could order required amount of material and save time on manufacture as we depend on 3rd party service for anodization.

You can get this from online store.

@Blasto  I dont know now correct number, but its calculated that it should enough with thermal conductive isolator to touch the alu with a bit of force.

@ElskerShadow It's smallest possible otherwise you will have same opened design as original Focbox

@Mobutusan yes, there is enough space for every connector. Which plug do you mean?

@BigBrit Fully enclosed water "tight", better heat dissipation. Also, don't forget it just a prototype single piece, the end result will be a dual case.

I was mainly concerned about the male-male servo wire we need to use to connect the receiver, although I think this would only be an issue on the older FOCBOX and VESC-X versions that don't have the servo/receiver wire built in.

It appears that the reference version he has here is one of the old ones with the plug for the receiver, so I would imagine he planned for that.  The new ones are easier obviously because they have the wires already soldered to the board.

In the one picture, you can see the receiver wires coming out of the grommet.

Awesome. Will there be a rubber seal between the two parts, other than those grommets used for the wires? Anyway you can think of making this waterproof?

I often skate in bad weather/typically don't let it stop me and often don't have a choice. 

How can it be mounted to the deck?

You could use gasket sealant or some high temp silicone equivalent, getting them made exactly would require expensive tooling or an expensive farming out to a supplier

Let us know when you'll start taking our money :stuck_out_tongue:

Seriously, this is a must-have item if it can be waterproofed and rockproofed.

Serious question though that I've had issues with before, are the fins far enough apart to fit fat fingers & washclothes in-between so I can wipe the road grime off?  Trying to clean fins that are closer than finger-width apart is a pain in the rear.

I'd rather have half as many fins if it means it takes a tenth the time to clean them
```

@telnoi there is no rubber seal but it has really tight fit so water splashes and some water will definitely not pass through. There is an option to order custom made but the price will be as for a single prototype run a lot bigger.

The mounting will be through holes you see in pictures. There also will be an option to buy a mounting plate to have our old style ears as many people complained that those mounting ears are not needed.

@NAF around something like this 70mm x 140mm x 28mm

@banjaxxed there will not be a single unit as most people who use focboxes are only using them in the dual configuration. 

@b264 first world problems :joy: The fins are 3mm width. There will be option to buy without fins it will be cheaper and lower than with fins (for those build who put them in boxes and etc.)

That's not the point.  The point is not having to use a toothbrush to clean it.  That's the whole thing I'm saying.  Not trying to solve for fingers not fitting... but saying this is a big part of how good this design is, if fingers can wipe it clean with a cloth

Might be nice if the fins are filleted at the front and rear to deal with unexpected glance when leaving the sidewalk, rather than being ripped off the deck it *might* have a chance of turning into a skidpan...90 degree angle avoidance

6061 is ok with its thermal conductivity. Not sure is that matter a lot but maybe when you have fins in heatsink it's a bit better than other harder alloys.

Honestly, I'd prefer an alloy that takes curb sliding like a champ and I'm sure whichever alloy that is will transfer heat plenty adequately.

No amount of being careful will completely eliminate the accidental concrete contact

Could you give me a top view with indicated distances for the mounting screws? Have to see how that would work with my board.

Still on the fence with the design. Obviously and for good reasons, the Rx will have to be relocated (using two..don't like canbus and I am cautious with y-cable). In addition, I have a volt meter that will have to go elsewhere..

why do people keep looking for waterPROOF? Seals can crack and wear down especially with the vibration these things go through. 

Maybe you can add a silicone seal and also a hydrophobic spray to seal everything, but like I mentioned, vibration will eventually cause a problem somewhere on/in your board

There are two pathways for two power supplies cables, I don't know if there will be enough space for putting cable inside as we do not have two focbox to try it out. But I think with some tinkering its possible, worst case scenario you can just route Y style cable to both of them and have an only single connector.

I don't think there will be more single ones made, because there was only several pre-orders compared to tenths of duals :unamused:

The cases with the fins from the first batch are available to buy right now. Only several are left.

https://shop.3dservisas.eu/products/dual-focbox-case-with-cooling-fins

There is a new batch coming with a bit changed design later on. It has wider spacing between fins (for those with big fingers :joy:) Also finless will be available too. People who pre-ordered single cases will also have coupons sent to them by tomorrow.

Hardly see anyone using single who has the resources to do dual & if that is a factor then spending another $60 on a case isn't really a go-er, that's probably the answer.

In saying that I definitely want to do a big-ass single so hope I can get one

Now I'm actually wondering how everyone are planning to use these. If the fins are there to help dissipate heat then will this be mounted within an enclosure? wouldn't the heat still be trapped in that? Is the heat spread across the enclosure negligible for me to not have to do what I planned? (below)

I'm going towards the idea of cutting a hole in my enclosure for the fins to be exposed

If i had unlimited money I'd buy 2 singles, I love modularity (not sure that's a word).
But one slice of the top-end market would be the dual diagonal builders, not a lot out there but worth considering.

@deucesdown just a thought, if you don't mind experimenting,  you can stitch modules together to form a group and print 2, 3, 4 modules as a group, depending what your printer allows:

If I had version with find (I have without), I would probably wish for something like this:

![image|658x499](upload://w130JEFgrXq93GIxSpRwcYAUqd3.jpg)

You could mount it on the enclosure and the case would be nicely cooled with outside air :)

The vesc enclosures do have ears with screw holes. Maybe future version?

You're right but you can just put the receiver inside the case and let the antenna go out of it through a little hole.

The website [3S SERVISAS](https://shop.3dservisas.eu/collections/cases/products/dual-focbox-case-without-cooling-fins) states this feature "3 x General purpose holes for wires (RF receiver, Bluetooth modules and etc.)", but I would like to know if this means there is a place for the receiver aside the two FOCBOXes.

First run with FocBox cases on the aluminum plate.  Things to consider it was at least ten degrees F cooler outside.  I didn't reach near as high of speed or pull as many amps

https://metr.at/r/NhZDK

Today was warm. 84f.   I was able to hit top speed for my gearing. 35mph and not slowing down up the hill just holding 35mph steady.  Motors had super loud whine going full out up the hill though..

Motors only warm to touch. Not close to hot.
https://metr.at/r/oRCzU

Well. Next step is to find a longer uphill to punish this board.  Already you can tell the temps are being dissipated faster and are generally lower.  I checked some of my data from cruising around and the temps are averaging a few degrees cooler in general which is great. I think some data from some mountain board users will be helpful.  I think the design is excellent and works as expected.  I intend to mount the case using Kydex with just the fins exposed. However there is so much aluminum I think this would be fine fully enclosed as well. Great work @Kug3lis

My CNC dual case arrived today - wow! It's even more beautiful than the pictures suggest! 

So for those that are curious the case fits perfect (tight fit on the sides with enough room for bt module, receiver in the 206 ultrabox:

![IMG_0282|666x500](upload://suHruyVvZ4ZzoJLLei6pjvYs9l3.JPG)

...but you're probably gonna wanna throw that shitty thing in the bin when you realise how sick it looks directly on the board!!! üòç

![IMG_0288|375x500](upload://mVkWukoXAoqFHS7FEcQIUaeNn4v.JPG)![IMG_0294|500x500](upload://3xHWErWlvIEmOX21ZEyCYm5vgHp.JPG)![IMG_0290|375x500](upload://dc6g69d77bCqIjM8ot46vsZEWga.JPG)

I actually plan just to Velcro it to the deck, get a very small box for my receiver, bt modules and loop key, and create a fastening for my phase wires. It doesn't matter to me if it's not totally waterproof - dust and splash proof is perfect for my needs.

I'll upload more pics when it's on the board.

......on second thoughts I may actually just shrink wrap my receiver etc and hide them in front of the case...no extra box needed!

....you will need to solder all pin connections to fit it in - but I guess that's a given and we should have it all soldered anyway.

Already testing that.  I think my 8ga wires are getting hot as well though.  I saw some discoloration near my loop key on my kydex enclosure.  Going to open the box to further inspect.  I didn't see any melting, discoloration, or warping on the wire or key itself.

I've bumped my battery amps to 65, however I haven't surpassed 55A on my setup.  It's dual 6374, but I think some larger motors would easily pull more battery amps.

You just need to use thermal pads for FET's and everything else has no connection to the case apart standoff legs. If you want to keep safe (paranoid) you can glue some Kapton tape around the case.

I think it would be nice for mountainboard if cable outputs were  symetrical. I mean there would be cooling fins up and down the case and the two focboxes would lay on opposite sides in the case. I would buy a case like that. I don‚Äôt know if you see what I mean.

The problem is that FET's are on one side only if I made it symmetrical (flip board) then whole cooling fin concept would kinda useless.

P.S. Even without the case it would look the same, in case you mount one on top and one on bottom which would also look not nice ;)

@E1Allen yes will be available again in 2-3weeks.

@Deckoz that mount was first made for my own board and never intended for selling but as people liked and asked for it it's being made so it will be available also in 2-3 weeks

Wonder if it takes two single enclosures? No real reason beyond interest and I don't have any singles, but bet it would look cool al the same

Did an off road hill test today where my previous build reduced speed halfway due to focboxes overheating (original enclosure / ultrabox 206). 

I could power up there full throttle now. Mind you, the previous build had issues at - 5 degrees celcius during winter . The finless case performed better at 20 degrees.

Time will tell if it worked, but I sealed the PCBs with a spray (tape off the fets) and put silicone in between the two halves of the case and around/in the cable grommets. The standard wires of the focbox are not thick enough to completely close the gaps In the grommets, neither are the xt60 cables.

Can't think of a better solution, unless you wire it all the way to where the lipo is located...or you relocate the entire dual enclosure to the center and put it inside of some container along with the lipos. 

I only have a receiver in there, which came waterproofed from the factory. It is drenched in some kind of epoxy. It might not look pretty as it is, but nothing will happen to it.

Just quick update, yesterday I glued in the Enertion Nano-X receiver without case and pins just soldered wires directly on PCB also covered whole PCB with hotglue so it wouldn't short something (I am bit skeptical to use tape as vibration/friction can tier it) I rode today without any problem also distance is the same like not in the case. I will try next to also put bluetooth module it would be super clean for everyone who uses it on top of deck like me :)

As far I can say after whole week riding it works without a problems, I had some other issues but that was related disconnected one phase wire and overcurrent protection kicking in :) I think it should work, just he will need to strip all the connectors and cases from those receivers as it maximum fits like ~5mm the height from capacitor until pcb so you can imagine, nano-x without headers and hot glue fits :)

As many people have requested to create a FocBox case which would fit inside enclosure's similar to evolve style heatsink we create a new design which has just on heatsink part and works with original FocBox covers on top, basically replaces two original alu plates with one big one which can be embedded inside enclosure.

LOL I was literally thinking about this last night. I'm switching from a top mounted battery pack to the eboosted double stack bottom mount enclosure and was debating if I should move the focbox case to the bottom too. But that would defeat the purpose of me getting the case which is better cooling as moving it inside the enclosure would cut off airflow. I could cut out a large hole but sealing that would be very hard without a lip around the fins.

It works for me in a browser -- and it works from the command-line from a server in an Amazon datacenter.

If you don't have apple stuff, may I ask what error you're seeing?

I think its something to do with your browsers or etc, because the site runs on Shopify and it shouldnt have any issues as its serving 100th's of thousands shops

I think it‚Äôs might be some thing to do with ISP classing you as a adult site. (2 weeks it dident work we were on 2 difrent connections both places used talk talk)

We had issues with some pyrotechnics websites been blocked so found out we had child protection on but them sites gave us a warning that said talk talk blocked it and to contact the bill payer. 3D servisas just have a error page.

Working at a difrent location with a difrent ISP (virgin) works on all the devises and difrent browsers that would not connect before. Order placed in the end. Don‚Äôt know if that helps but that‚Äôs what I found out.
