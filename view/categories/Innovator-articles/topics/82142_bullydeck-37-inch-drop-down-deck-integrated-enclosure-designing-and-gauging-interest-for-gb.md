Ok. It seems to go faster than I thought. If you like the project you can now sing to reserve your BullyDeck. It's not the final form, it's for me to understand if the project will take place or not :sweat_smile:. I have the company ready to make them after the Chinese New Year. I will first get a prototype and then open the final requests.

**Deck specs**:
- 36 inch drop through/down deck
- 9.8 to 9 inch wide
- Canadian maple plus fiber glass for integrity
- Nice concave
- Integrated enclosure
- 2 cutouts of 540 x 80mm x 24mm. 12s4p 2wd should fit easy.
- I like in a wood colour. I will add the varnish to protect it. You can then paint it as you like it :wink:


I want to make it happen for **below 200 Euro to Belgium, EU**, then the **shipping** to you (should be **around 30 Euro**). Of course the more the cheaper. **10 decks should be fine** for the first round. **It will probably be a small GB since I need it soon**! We can still change minor details in the next couple of weeks. Please participate to the pool and fill in the the **Google form**.
Thx!
Ciao ciao :wink:

UPDATE ALWAYS AT THE END OF THE THREAD!

Would you be interested in the BullyDeck project?
[poll type=regular public=true]
* Yes, I will sign the form
* Yes but I will wait the prototype first, to see if you lay :stuck_out_tongue:
* No! but I will see you spending a lot on money in prototyping :sob:
* No, I do not like it

Edit: Removed the old pics for clarity.

"Hello folks! Since I don't know what deck to use for my next build, I am thinking of making one with partial or full integrated enclosure. I already have a short board, perfect for commuting but I am now making a powerfull DD and I would need to pair it with a bigger battery. I really like the landyacht switchblade so why not based mine ipotetica one on it? I made a draft of what can be the final version. It's the 36inch one. Over 36 is too long for my taste. The one in the picture has grooves of 25mm deep so it would be the fully integrated version. Due to the size of the board I think it's more for dual drive and not 4wd. The deck is quite thick, 35mm, but I can always decrease it. I did it to be sure that will be sturdy. I am thinking of using Canadian maple."

It seems able to fit nicely 12s4p 18650 cells plus dual vesc and BMS (charge only).

That's too thick (but nice shape). How about shaping it like a thinner deck with a smooth angled enclosure? Design it like a classic deck then bulge it where needed. It'll also help drop the height.

I like it, like a short chunky hummie deck. If you mount drop through, you have to consider the thickness of the deck. Might need to route out a cavity on top for clearance.

As other suggested I will design in a way the thick part is only for the enclosure, so the truck should be fine, probably it will allow more geardrive, hub, DD over belt drive if you want to position them facing inside. I am planning DD so should be ok. I am in contact with a company. Waiting to know how much they want to make it. Do not have time to press it by myself. I hope they will do it with out a MOQ, We'll see it.

Cable management very simple for the moment, but that it's easy to make it in another way.

I dont think it needs to be this thick, I made my own (yet to be tested) out of hardware store plywood and PVA glue. It’s 18mm thick with a 12mm slot running he whole length of the wheel base almost. It is still reasonably strong but I will add a layer or two of fibreglass for extra strength and

man that change everything, I kept 10mm above the grooves but now I am discussing with the factory to actually add 2 layers of fiber glass. I can probably then go for like 30mm overall so 5mm left. From the side it looks thicker for the concave, but it is actually only on the sides.

I like the look and I like the fact that it's drop down. I recently made a new board with drop-down deck and it's very comfortable and controllable. 

But, maybe not have the drop through though. Makes it less strong. Also you can taper off the edges a bit to make it look slim. Like a MacBook.

BTW, why have bottom mount? Why not do it from.thr top? If you want w concave. You can still do that with an appropriate cover.

Well the truck are there for reference only. You can mount it drop through too. I will had fobweass so should be strong enough. Now the 2 ends are 14mm so I strong enough. For the w concave I can have it on top but at the bottom would require thicker lid.

Company agreed with making it! Great. Of course now there is the Chinese New Year. I will manage to have a sample first but in case someone is interested I would get a better price if I buy more of them and so you :smile:. Would someone be interested in this intagrated deck? I can make a pool where we can discuss the last details, such as final concave, color (it will change a bit the price I guess), drop through-down or drop down only (the drop has to stay, so nice!), underneath chamber space ecc... We will have until the end of the New Year holiday to modify it. The price should be below 200 Euro in BE + shipping to you. I will try to keep as low as possible. Of course the more we buy the less we pay. That's the orientative price for 10 decks. So cool!

Ah ok sorry didn't get it. Well because I think it's more difficult to make the lid for it afterwards. Plus I am planning to make it in the same wood material. I am not sure I would like to step on it with the risk of put pressure on the hardware. The lid would be rather thin, just to cover.

Yeh I really like it a lot, I am looking forward to make it! Grooves are 540 x 80mm x 24mm (1mm is taken by the lid). You can fit 12s4p easy. 13s4p maybe with a dual vesc.

This rendering looks dope, I can feel it!

Ah I see what you mean no I think they are going to add multiple layers only at the level of the enclosure before press the drop down shape. 
So you actually do not need to mill the first part. That what I think but can be wrong. I thought about it but they day its not a problem to make it. I will ask for sure.

Hi! I updated the first post. There the lower part is chamfered now. The rest of the board no need to model since I will just say to fillet all the edges. I put the chamfer at the bottom because is more prominent and important.
Or do you mean the entire side to be angled towards the bottom?

Then again, I know nothing about design.

Hi guys...so got I discuss with the factory and they gave me some advice. I need to make the lid a bit thicker in order to be one layer fiberglass and one layer maple, so I had to change the whole model :tired_face: I didn't model the cable routing for the moment, that really easy and I will make it at the end this time.

With the help of @mishrasubhransu I am going to test AT setup on this board. He recently modified his board so he knows where to make the cuts. He also remembered me the NESE modules, so one of the pool would be about that. The current grooves are 80mm wide so NESE modules fit nicely, but we could also go for a single groove and therefore have enough space for the wide NESE module and way more cells. I need to see if the structure would be strong enough in that case.
If you do not mind I will run a bit of surveys to understand which paths to take, so that at the end we will both like it. :grin: Your contribution is really welcome!

OK guys I spent the last two evening in flushing the deck and make it better. I have to say that now I really like a lot. Here the updated pics.

I made some simulations with free spot welded 18650 and NESE module (2S4P).
AS you can see with the current 2 grooves design you can fit 12s4p and 2 vescs or a dual vesc. Although the NESE modules take a bit of space so with the dual grooves you can fit 10s4p. I am planning to use the NESE module so I would see with the factory if a single grove is possible. I will probably need to add more fiberglass but should be possible.

Then here a gallery of the deck with 100mm BOA wheels and 8 inch (200mm) AT wheels. I didn't find a CAD file of a 5-6 inch wheel. If someone has it and wants to share it, thx! Maybe @mishrasubhransu do you have it?

One pic is with carbon fiber, just to dream a bit. I am going to ask whether they can do it and how much it is. Maybe my personal one would be an unicorn :unicorn: 
I design the deck only dropdown, but that can change easy. Do not forget to answer to the previous polls! You will help me a lot.
I hope you will like it...

Rey and I talked about it. I have a model of my deck in cad but I am yet to update it after I cut the corners(literally) to make sure that there is 0 wheel bite. 

Once I send him the updated deck he can use that as a reference to make sure that there is no wheel bit with 6" wheels.

Thanks to @mishrasubhransu for the files. I think that indeed it will requires the corners to go, but I am not sure I want to change the shape so much. This one is a 36 inch board, so shorter of the average dropdown. We can think about it. I am not familiar with AT setup but do you usually use some risers with it? because I thing with and angled one you will get to wheel bite setup. Can be wrong of course. 

Here the rendering:
I have to admit that never thought about an AT board, but I might it in the future...

**AT 6 inch tyres**

Glad to help. BTW, you should change the color of the rims to aluminum or something. Being black takes away from the look in the rendering. 

You'll have to remove material at a particular place to avoid wheel bite. Won't affect the strength much. I'll post a pic to store what I mean when I get to work.

That's nice! Thank you. I do have 90mm and 97 mm, but would be cool to test the other wheels too. My main concern are the AT wheels. For that either I make another version of the deck or design a riser to fix the problem. I do not have experience with AT set up, but what folks do in case of drop down deck? Raiser, angled raiser? The deck is based on a landyachz switchblade 36 inch so same wheel bite.
The carbon fiber version would be awesome but probably increases the price. I want to keep it as low as possible. I want it to be a sick deck for the community, that's it. Then people can always add it later ecc...

Thanks man ans nice deck. I would also go for a lid on top but the drop down makes everything more complicated thst I think a bottom lid is more practice. Plus I do not really like the idea that the thinner surface where I am staining is just above the battery. One solution to use the top lid would be 2mm of aluminium. Thst I think is strong enough but in case you bend it a bit, the deck is ruined. Teh problem that I should make the aluminium shaped in another factory I guess. That would increase the price a lot. I want to make a deck for myself and then more then glad to share it with few people interested. At the end the bottom lid will just result with small m3 screws or maybe an industrial velcro. Same for the top lid.

Wood thickness is pretty thin at the battery area ; maybe if you can do the same layout you already have (with the central woodbar reinforcement as a pilar) but close the bottom and open the top, you may be able to still get the same result and strength. Make a top lid curved and thick enough and you don't need an alu tray underneath anymore. 

Now it's just an alternative & not really needed idea, your current deck looks already great and functional too :sunglasses:

Shape of your deck is also pretty stiff IMO (bending the side walls will be really tough) !
```

thanks for the advice. The thickness above the battery is what I discuss with the factory. They suggest the minimum thickness to leave since I am gonna add fiberglass layer to make it strong. Yes the side frame would be really strong and also all around is the central part the weaker point, that's why the central wall.
I see your point of the top lid and indeed it is feasible but it will require more work I guess and so more money. it's not a simple concave you have the cleft in front ecc, while underneath I menage to have flat surface, way easier to make it right. Last thing on top I would see the need of add a lot of screws all around the edges, so everytime you are gonna need to open you will hate me :joy:I think that underneath the cover would be only too protect the hardware, so everything would be secure to the upper part with velcro or whatever people want to use and probably a velcro o 3 screws on the side and 1-2 front/rear would be plenty.
Now I have to think how to do the cable management. I am lending toward only make space in the central wall and maybe for the motor phase wires, although if someone want to use a diagonal configuration, single motor ecc he will need to drill new holes and what worse close unused one. Same for the charging port. The central wall for sure the rest, not sure. No personal I think. I was actually thinking of making 2 small windows and place the waterproof net to stop water and debris while allowing air to go through to cool down the components.

For CAD/CAM I use Fusion360, I learnt from YouTube tutorials :wink:

Edit: sorry for being confusing, but I was walking with the dog and writing. Didn't work out really well :sweat_smile:

i dont know what your knowledge towards fiberglass is, but i watched some good videos and basicly you need bidiagonal on top and the underside to create a box to counter torsion forces and Unidirectional Fiberglass for the bottom going with the grain to strengthen against bending forces from above.

It is sadly in german. He also didnt give any information towards how much you need in g/cm² . But i read that somewhere around 400g/cm² give a good stiffness, mind this is for longboards without any canals. Tricky stuff indeed.
 Maybe ask @Hummie. Since his deck is a composite aswell, maybe he can provide more info towards this. 
Question is, are you going to build a press or vacuum it. 
Some of his videos have autogenerated subtitles, so give it a shot. Search his channel for more videos.

Thanks to @mishrasubhransu we can now see a new 12s4p solution on this board. Since his module are a mix of NESE and @Winfly, I am pretty sure Winfly's modules would work too.
4p modules are placed 1mm apart and would need the external soldering of the series connections. That in case the central wall has to stay for rigidity concerns. Pretty pretty cool!
If @mishrasubhransu do not mind, I am going to modify a bit the module to make it, from my point of view, stronger.

That looks way better. It actually covers one of the modification I made. Because is better to have a spacer to prevent from over-tight the ends. Question, does the space already leave a bit of gap for the actual compression?
Other modifications that can help:
-  square the ends, and fillet the one facing the deck, so it can bend but more surface for keep compression

- Make a small cleft to host a zip tie. I know simple but can help as stress relief without increase the size

![mini_nese_71mm_BullyDeck%20v4|690x388](upload://gCIHS2ehl5TmHgnZ8OkMZUaEjzt.jpeg) 

For the mounting I think I am going to do as usual. I run a wide really really strong velcro at the bottom (you can stick tings to it and works as damper too) and I put underneath smaller velcro belt that grab every 4p packs.!


Updates:
@mishrasubhransu here the modifications that I suggested. Unfortunately I can not see the assembly history so I had to remove the fillet manually. I hope I didn't compromise the work. If you can make the same modification or share a file without fill and chamfer would be great. Thank you!

ok as thought current version suffer of wheel bite with AT set up. Still have to see with PU wheels.  I should check switchblade build what to they use and if they run into problems with it.

I should add almost 50 mm (47 and something) to allow sharp turn. That would require to add at least 3cm in length on each side and cut the shape, but by doing that I should decrease the enclosure capacity.

![riser|690x388](upload://l4uzwOv4VeJp3ZqmJ0z00dK15tA.jpeg) ![riser2|690x388](upload://g40vYR5SxG9u31vM4HIKNhWHhhP.jpeg) 

It's easy to see that your board it's way longer.

Solution could be:
1- Add plate, same principle of the g-bomb brackets.

![BullyDeck_plate|666x500](upload://tm283GTcxL83LC3ja4vqs6NItdR.jpeg) ![BullyDeck_plate1|666x500](upload://nDOt73WhVyJPs7Q0xoCW8jRof3K.jpeg) 

2- Maybe an angle raiser if you find a truck that gives you the right angle at the end.
3- I make 2 versions, one short 36 inch and another one with longer front/rear truck mounting that would reach 38-40 inch. At the end for the company would be the same mold just cut it differently in front and back.

I like the last option. The nose would be a bit longer in the main mould and they would just cut it differently in the very final stage. 

GBomb would just take away from the look. And angled riser wouldn't help because the wheel diameter is much bigger and there is a drop.

Yeh I also think it's the better the wood sheet would be logger anyway. I will make a CAD with the extra lenght need it and it should do the trick. In the short board they are rather short so possible that from 36 inch I bring it to 36,5 his tto be sure with PU as well :wink:

@rey8801 I like what you're doing with this design! But IMO, if you keep your design laser focused on exactly what you want, you'll make something awesome for people who want what you want.

If try to accommodate every possibility, you'll dilute your vision, and come out with something that's "pretty decent" for a lot of people, but not great.

I think, at least for round one, it's great to roll the ideas around in your head and in CAD, but you in the end, you should make the perfect deck for you -- I think a compact chunky urethane doubledrop? :) This is what would inspire and excite people.

Round 2 can accommodate pneumies and nondrop and whatever else others want.

Just IMO. No offense to everyone else in the thread I hope! Personally I was thinking this is a good combo for the AVIO AT gear drive, with motors inside mounted. ;) We have had a few integrated boards, but most are top mount with no wheel cutaways, so work better with smaller urethane wheels.

No offense at all... If you read the whole thread is what actually I am aiming to do. If yoi see I set the design as I like it. Choose the deck ecc... Then since make it its really expensive i thought hy not give it back to the community. I knew it it will be a deck for few. What I am open to change are small details to accommodate the other wishes. That why I said that it will stay a max 36 inch board, but since the mould would be the same why not cut the front and the back a bit longer for who want more gap. If at the end I will be the only one to have it, well I am happy as well. I made a personal deck, which is awasome. Thst to resume me intention with it in case I didn't claim it clearly at the beginning. It's a passion, that's it. I don't take it as a job. That's for others.
Yes the combo you suggest would be awesome, but as I said I will pair it with the DD I am making. All DIY stuffs for me. At least where I am capable :smile:

Ok, thank you all for answering the polls. After the Chinese holidays I am going to propose these two options and see which it is more feasible in terms of rigidity/time/production cost.
For the single groove, I need to ask first. Not sure is possible without increase the deck thickness.

Overall measures:

36inch length
9.6 wide
pockets 530 x 82.5 x 24 mm (25mm in the drop through version)

**Option 1: Drop down**

![BullyDeckNewStyle|666x500](upload://dxpXivHxI5S2USKwH4LKRWhYEsU.jpeg) ![BullyDeckNewStyle_1|666x500](upload://q1f7nIgvGd6hAnjnnyGW7n8pwu6.jpeg) ![BullyDeckNewStyle_2|666x500](upload://u1lxxZ8KjOFaE2YG27fISwcm04n.jpeg) 

**Option 2: Drop Through/Down**

I had to keep it open at the ends because I was afraid to get wheel bite if I go closer to the deck. Once they make it, it would be possible to test it and see if it is necessary or not. Just in case I increased of 1mm the thickness of the board. So in this version the pockets are 25mm deep, instead of 24mm.

Ok, agreed on the prototype. I should get it in 20-30 days. Exciting! :laughing: Of course I went for the carbon fiber top layer. Specifically drop down for the moment. We will discuss drop through later that it's easy anyway. I wanted as strong as possible so added carbon fiber and fiber glass. 
Should be like this at the end
I think it's sick!

Looks very good... I dont know why i have never seen this thread!

I am not that huuuuge fan of the bulldog shape... i loke it more smooth. But thats totally a personal thing!


2 things that go through my head:

Is the Core really stable enough? U create it from a solid piece of wood... i thing this is not as stable as a layered version, isnt it? I really dont know... just my first impression....

The channels are very deep... go for a deph of 22mm. Safe that two mm for more stabiltiy. The haya even works with 20mm on the prototype.

No I really wanted a little short tank. Thst was the purpose. I had all more flat deck so far and really want a drop down. 

For the core, that exactly what I asked but making a metal mould to press the right shape immidiately means 800$ only for the mould. 
Since it can be a single deck project that would be just crazy. 
The block of wood is actually made by like 35 sheets laminated with epoxy glue and then milled. So it's not a single block. The company said they have made other is the past and should be fine
Of course the more core the better. That's why I out the central wall too. Concerning the grooves thst would be awesome but how can it work with 22 only. Unity is 22mm, NESE module too. If you just add a damping material then won't fit anymore. Maybe 23mm can work but would be really tight
```

## \#105 Posted by: StefanMe Posted at: 2019-03-12T10:19:49.217Z Reads: 136

Unity is 19mm :stuck_out_tongue:

But u are right. More space is better... Was just my thoughts. on the Haya prototype i just got 20mm space by wrong milling I created some smaller nese modules and it works just fine. No dumping material of course, only from the top lib.

Therse bottom lib looks cool... how is it made? Also wood? Maybe i should read the hole thread frist ^^

Ah good I probably measured wrong mine haahah.
Yes same principle. Wood. I had to go with Baltic birch instead of maple because is already expensive as hell to make it. But I then found that is quite common for integrated deck due to the higher price of production. My original idea was to add fiberglass sheets in between but since it has to be milled it's not possible because you will break the fiber anyway. I put the lid below because I didn't like the idea of standing on the weaker parts above the electronics and because the drop down shape makes really difficult to put the lid on top.
The module I have for the NESE are 21mm so maybe 23mm deep will work too.

Hi. Both of the decks are in production at the moment.

The Bully deck is taking longer because is really complicate to make while the other one is almost done. Couple of weeks I should have both finally! Had to change a bit the design to accommodate production limit. I will post it once I have them 

Shoot from the AT deck production 
![gallery|281x500](upload://hq1tRDNAYPv4thWcUO6D8lMx8lY.jpeg)


Tha Bully Deck is inspired to switchblade landyachtz so what you can run there you will probably be able to run it on this deck too.

ahahha man if you can help would be fantastic. Then I will cut a grip tape for you too of the design you want!
The top it's not carbon fiber now. I am not sure  I will cover it becuase I would need to but the fiber, epoxy ecc... with all the other porjects I have I do not see the time. So the option are like pain it black on top and play with the piece of black grip tape or leave it wood colour and grip tape art. My original plan was to have it all wood colour but then I went for the aluminium lid so I had to painted to cover it. It's bed liner at the bottom though. 
It will be paid with MAD storm so raw hanger truck :wink:
For the grip tape design. Still didn't think about it :thinking:. I still need to make the bullydeck logo (otherwise no logo no party) and the grip tape design.

Hey Alessio,
Happy if I could help you back after all your hard works!
what your logo will approximatively look like ? it will be on the center of the deck? ^^ it could help me a lot to know where to go, with a little reference of anything else (trace of bully's paws ... ok absolutely not minimalist but just to know if it's a big no ! ?)
I got some design selected for a friend so I can easily show you some (he want all except minimalism :smile: )  :

... there is also a lot of geometric patterns available for our use!

I think it's more what you're looking for with the minimalist aspect.
I'm also a big fan of the last _eboosted_ grip that takes back the look of the enclosure :ok_hand: 

I will try some little 'toshop on your last photo with some simple minimalist design ... and maybe geometric pattern ;)

Man that's great! Not sure if I will place the logo on top. I will engrave it for sure with laser inside the enclosure since I want to number all the decks I make so they will always be unique :wink: it's al about details. For the logo is Ginn Ave the word Bully in a nice font and maybe a minimalistic drawing of a shardforshire bull terrier (my dog), but not sure. Geometric shapes on top would be great. I will always go for the classic style nothing pop art. Be 360 degree stealth is mandatory. Anyhow do not trouble too much, but if you can give some good ideas I appreciate a lot!

Hi! You should check on the new forum Esk8 news. I don't update here so often anymore. I just received the unity back so I will finish the build soon and test it. This deck is amazing but really expensive. Not sure it will see the light. It cost me a lot to make it.
For instance for the other deck I made, the Choo Choo deck, it's now running a small GB for who asked about it. Different concept, it's a short AT board. Anyway I wnt to first try the Bully deck and then decide of is worth it 😁

As for the ChooChoo deck I am not really interested in making profit, but the Bully deck costed me above 300$ once imported 😜

I would be able to make some of them only if we reach at least 10 decks and price would be at least 320$. You won't need the enclosure but the amount of work needed, makes it really expensive
