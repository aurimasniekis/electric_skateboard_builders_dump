Hi everyone,

I am part of a group of university students in a design course, and we are trying to gauge interest in a potential product for electric skateboards. We are designing a weight sensing control system that will take input from both a typical remote control and the weight sensors, and output to the boards speed controller(s). The purpose of the control system is to still allow you to have manual speed control, but to also monitor the riders position and modulate the throttle and/or brakes so as to not throw the rider off.

This survey should only take a minute to fill out.

If you have any questions, concerns or suggestions about the functions of this system, please ask them in this thread. 
(e.g. would you prefer if the product had an integrated remote, or if it plugged in between your existing remote and your ESC's)

I had a look at that thread by @GIP_longboard , they did some awesome design work on it, and certainly helped confirm to us that a system like this is possible at all.

It's being done also by Grin Technologies. https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=49557&p=1296864&hilit=weight+sensing+longboard#p1296864

They are using a different type of truck to accomplish this instead of the tradition hanger design.
