What do you guys think of having a page where we had 3d model files or links to like  Thingiverse pages where we had pre designed models of brushless motors that are commonly used here.

The application that I have in mind is quickly 3D printing the model of a motor (or dual setup) to see how everything mounts up before purchasing the real deal online.
