Hey everyone!
I designed a thing:
![Truck_2018-Jun-26_08-48-28AM-000_CustomizedView1133319088_png|647x500](upload://aIHhd7sOmBnDikaO5oL1JDU3put.jpg)

I've been talking to manufacturers, both locally and overseas, but everywhere I've gone has quoted ~1000 USD for mould setting (pretty much one set) - with initial manufacturing once the bits have been set being far, far cheaper

So the point of this post is, would anyone here be interested in a set of these motors?

Important Specifications
-
- The stator has 40.6 mm Diameter, 45mm long with 12 teeth and a 14mm bore. 
- Compatibility with Kegel Cores, which gives you all wheel sizes of 75mm, 80mm, 85mm, 90mm, 97mm and 100mm. The diameter of the motor also means that using 75mm wheels is possible with 11.5mm of ground clearance, perfect for people with small wheels.
- Motor dimensions are 5275, projected maximum wattage is ~1800.
- Fully compatible with Paris Baseplates and bushings as wide as Orangatang Nipples 
----
Maximum speeds with motor @65KV and different size wheels (12s nominal).
- 75mm (Can't remember the name) - 20.97 mph - 33.74 km/h
- 80mm (Kegel) - 22.36 mph - 35.99 km/h
- 85mm (Cagumar) - 23.76 mph - 38.24 km/h
- 90mm (Popoca, Hatchling, R-spec) - 25.16 mph - 40.49 km/h
- 97mm (R-spec) - 27.12 mph - 43.64 km/h
- 100mm (Constrictor, R-spec AT) - 27.96 mph - 44.99 km/h

Even with a few preorders, we could get the price ~500! Would there be any interest in this?

Some more pictures:

Some technical details:
1. Stator lamination height is 0.2mm
2. All motor parts are high grade ferromagnetic low carbon steel
3. Motor magnets are sintered Nd2Fe14B, which is rated to ~300 degrees celsius

I would take this to be more on just gauging interest at this point and providing a possible prince point.

As for the motors.  More options for this type of drive is always good.  It offers the same benefits as Carvon but with distinct differences that set it apart.

One option you could add is having removable alternative wheel adapters.
Not sure how you have designed the wheel adapters, but if it is anything like Carvons and simply unbolts I don't see any reason why it couldn't be done. 
Having the option to buy the drives and a matching wheel adapter for whatever wheel cores matches each persons personal favorite wheel would be a nice advantage.

They're a 3 part design, so really damn easy to have an Abec style core option. I chose the kegel style because the core is inherently stronger - thats a big plus when you're putting 8nm of torque through the wheel. Also my ABEC design had higher machining costs :frowning:

The more offer of a certain product the better

Did you design the stator specifically for these motor or are you going with what’s is offered by manufacturers?

Bit of both, it's a standard dimensioned 50xx stator (40.6mm od) but I'd get them specifically manufactured for this board - no one makes stators like this. 10mm longer than one in a 5065.

I only made this post because I'm a student, and I need 450 alone for stator production. That's 450 I can't free up without knowing there's some demand

My opinion is that there is a high demand for such products. It looks really nice!
BUT, I think people are hesitant to throw money at vaporware.

If you want to copy Carvon, please don't make the same mistakes along the way.
The kingpin screw seems to not have enough room between the motors for the axle to turn without hitting the motors.

Nice renders, IMHO this is how "hub motors" should have been created since day 1.

However, I would be very very careful before taking anybody's money. Just today, I was looking at [the kickstarter for a desktop laser cutter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mrbeam/mr-beam-ii-the-desktop-laser-cutter-and-engraver/updates). Just read those updates and see all the problems they had. Product was delivered over two years late. Same goes for the mellow drive, carvon etc. etc., and those guys were working on it full time with more than one person. This is why they say "hardware is hard", it's not something you can do next to being a student.

However, don't be discouraged, if you manage to pull it off I'm sure there's some demand (me included!). Just start with very very limited batches, and work out the problems before scaling up.

I think there's definitely a demand for direct drive systems. You'd only need to see how quickly a carvon group buy filled up and how many people still try and get their hands on those drives. I also think there's nothing wrong with having options. I for one encourage you to give it a go! I know my next street build will have them one way or another. Maybe hook up with @NAF and sell as a complete on his hyper beast? The renderings look sweet.

Maybe you can get some advice/collaborate re bringing your design into reality. 

Looking forward to hearing more :sunglasses:

It's a problem they ran into very early during the development of the Carvon V3 ([kickstarter update link](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/carvonllc/carvon-next-generation-electric-skateboards-longbo/posts/1900250)) 
It is not an issue anymore. And it might not be an issue here either. I really just do not want @JohnTakesPhotos to make the same mistakes.

If your directdrive can compete with carvon’s, i’d totally get one. However, i think you should do some prototyping and actually make a working version that you can show to the public before making a kickstarter out of it.

[/quote]

This would be a reason I'd be interested.  Having a shortboard with less noticeable/smaller motors without sacrificing real longboard wheels is definitely a good thing.  Dual 5065 is more than enough power for most applications.  Sometimes stealth and size are what is needed.

@Papperlapp fixed ;) Added 7.5mm to each side, sowould pair perfectly with paris 195's. 

I don't have the capital or time to make this a thing, so the file above is open to anyone who has any interest in making their own. gl

https://a360.co/2L2gKXa - just motor
https://a360.co/2N2N4Hj -  Full assembly


@b264 it's better than 5065! The stator is the same length as a high end 6375, just with a smaller diameter.

All,
Not sure if there is much interest in this project but I spoke with John a few weeks back and offered some help to get a lower quote than he was originally provided. 
I have someone who is helping me source other products non esk8 related market and with him being in China and speaking Mandarin let me tell you.... you don't get the BS run around and price hikes with Alibaba sourcing.  Some uncommon knowledge about Alibaba sourcing, you can find manufacturers but you never know if you are dealing with a true manufacturer unless you visit them. Most contacts are Dealers/Agents who raise prices for their cut of the pie and Manufacturers will commonly only use a dealer or agent so our guy becomes that person to get the best pricing available without raising it for his cut which brings some major transparency.

Because John really had the vision of this being an open community product we are trying to keep the price as low as possible without affecting quality.  As far as build material types and or redesigns, just add to the post and if we lock down the pricing for a first run we will hopefully get these as quickly as possible for a group buy. Similar to the ESCAPE VESC6 Project - profit isn't the goal here so you are practically getting this product at cost price. WHy? 
 because it may not be retail ready, I would consider it an alpha/beta product until tested and proven otherwise.

What else do we need to know?:

* You pay the obvious shipping and import taxes depending on your country.

* Shipping logistics won't be to much of an issue except for the normal Import Taxes depending on your country.

* As I receive information regarding the quoted pricing I will post to this thread. *Cross your Fingers* we get a damn good deal because this would be amazing if direct drive could be accessible to a large part of the community at fractions of the cost that everyone else is charging out there.

i was looking at your fusion drawings.  the amount of the axle that can screw into the aluminum hanger is pretty small and looks the weakest link and seems worth adding to.
   the temp ability of those magnets surely isnt 300 c.

the output power they gave you would likely be based at an ideally high rpm which you wouldnt be running at.

you said the stator has a 14mm bore and i think i measure the axle is 12mm....thats very thin material supporting the stator especially if it's aluminum.  maybe it's adequate

there are a lot of teeth in the design to orient the magnets.  if you cut the teeth off it will be much cheaper for them to make and you can position the magnets with something else either 3d printed or something.  youre going to want to use wider magnets as well for better coasting and lower temp.  the teeth will be very small

So I've got some quotes back and the price is varying. One manufacturer.
1st: 7075 materials(100 sets order): USD 110/set  

6061 materials(100 sets order): USD 112/set

Or $300 single order, this is not with compplete Motors mind you, stator price pending and you'd have to wind the phase wires yourself.

I'm still working on price for fully build motors. 

P. S. 
New design is in works from original poster so I'm waiting for the motor files to get itemized pricing for only motors then we can price the build out better.The current design is specifically for people to wind their own motors...(again missing stator pricing) . Which may not be suited for most folks.

Sorry for lack of an update. I had quotes from 2 manufacturers but the design changed and I need the new files from @JohnTakesPhotos hes a student and probably busy so I understand the delays. Let me follow up with the last pricing, the parts on the first request were only the housing, wheel adapters and truck cc milling so I need specs and files for stator, motor, copper wire type eetc. If I get that or if someone else get me the designs I'm all for getting these quotes for you guys at a lower cost than it would be to buy any of the direct drives out there now. 

Just need the specs..... I'll email John again.

@fliess any interest in getting some major manufacturing quotes for your direct drive? Obviously it's your product, you control pricing etc but nobody else other than carvon and torqueboards is working on these type of drives from my knowledge. I've got so many other things to worry about for pulse so ...well we ain't in the market to make these and spend the time designing our own version so best I can do is get you guys to the manufacturers and if its affordable for people to pitch in, itd be pretty epic

I am afraid it's going to be too expensive. I can explain why - I have an issue. My issue is that I hate low quality stuff. Not kidding. I am desperately trying to be more "italian", but there is something very "german" inside me (I am neither of).
Good DD cannot be cheap. If it's cheap, it's shit and people will have issues, which would be more difficult to fix than belt drive.

Sure, I am aware, that very quality stuff can also be produced in China. But one will constantly be involved in fight Quality vs. Price. I don't feel wasting my best years on this war. I would rather put my effort on machine learning and neural networks under my deck :crazy_face:
