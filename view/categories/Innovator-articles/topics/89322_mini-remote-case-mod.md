I have designed a new mini remote case, this has the same components to build as the Avio remote.

Features:

* Small
* USB Charge
* Battery Indicator
* More Travel
* Wrist Lanyard

[Lipo Battery](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Liter-energy-battery-3-7V-polymer-lithium-battery-wireless-phone-small-speaker-camera-103035-1000mAh-general/32793767461.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.4ce24c4dp3pdtH) Max Size 30X35mm

[Charger Board](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/5PCS-TP4056-TP4056A-1A-Lipo-Battery-Charging-Board-Charger-Module-lithium-battery-DIY-MICRO-Port-Mike/32838014285.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.4ce24c4dp3pdtH) could probably use TP4056A also

[Voltage Reg](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/5PCS-5V-3-3V-DC-DC-Step-Down-Power-Supply-Buck-Module-AMS1117-LDO-800MA/32732025305.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.4ce24c4dp3pdtH)

You will also need a donor remote and will need to remove the steering wheel pot. you may also want to re-solder the connections to the trigger to make it neater.

There are 2 version of the remote, a mini and a tiny, the tiny does have both the pots showing through the top

I have been printing in PETG.

This is a work in progress, there are probably going to be problems, so feedback is appreciated.

Thanks to @jaatis for sharing his files.

What itch did you have that AVIO remote wasn't scratching?

Maybe you could show us a few photos comparing your design to the AVIO? Just so that people get the idea what's different. I'm sure the ergonomics are different and it's always nice to have options.

Snip Snip

![IMG_9509|375x500](upload://t7abwBRLbanbSJrRHvrjKRHH5kV.jpeg) 

Snip the steering wheel pot wires

![IMG_9512|375x500](upload://2NwPEaFJRt0HSTf0q4WDssPeCTs.jpeg) 

Keep these 2 screws

![IMG_9532|375x500](upload://vG9F4FhMn5OXGJcRzRJGFIPWhHu.jpeg) 

Bend this crystal the other way to make room for the battery - you may have to heat up the hot glue

![IMG_9514|375x500](upload://3vOU7xOW06G9Qe1v1iNSSPa9HYC.jpeg) 

snip the plastic between the pins on the reg

![IMG_9520|375x500](upload://p2eA8fcjMIHxw2HODvPVIW4FTgS.jpeg) ![IMG_9521|375x500](upload://xummGio7RpeLPwuPe5TDVCIMzfI.jpeg) 

de-solder the pins

![IMG_9522|375x500](upload://1amdofFS7xQSKmzGzy15ieRfUsV.jpeg) ![IMG_9523|375x500](upload://4nf4kKckWC3LZ34MF2bkAHS3h0X.jpeg) ![IMG_9524|375x500](upload://9t0yPt6b62BUbUBVvSgvqM9qdqI.jpeg) 

Solder to the output and gnd that goes to the board

![IMG_9527|375x500](upload://kDoxmGqCZrSb1bNitcyMFjig1AP.jpeg) 

Solder both ways from the input and ground - solder the lipo metre board - snip the LED of the reg and headshrink

![IMG_9528|375x500](upload://qUS0XR0b1V6WrXkoSgcRZEfeUQN.jpeg) 

Solder the battery wires to the charger board

![IMG_9526|375x500](upload://2KE3CYaVX18khmXiOQ0LFvJFg8A.jpeg) 

Solder the other last pair of wires to the battery pads on the charger board - have fun with that one

![IMG_9530|375x500](upload://vaIl44tGxo4YOfRFGvU86snioyP.jpeg) 

Snip down the throttle about this much - and also the spring lever - once you do this, there is no turning back.

Assemble

Hey, sorry about the delayed response, im working on a new design as i was not 100% happy with the current, i would like to make it much thinner by re-designing the thumb wheel. should be done in a couple of weeks.
