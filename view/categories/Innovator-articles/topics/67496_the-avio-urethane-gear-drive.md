## *(Installing the Motor Mount)*:
1. Take the hangar out of the truck baseplate.
2. Slide the motor mount onto the hangar.
3. Slide the hangar adapter onto the hangar.
4. Slide a wheel (with bearings) onto the axle and tighten it. The hangar adapter should be firmly locked in place.
5. Turn the hangar wheel side down and the motor mount should sit flush with the bearing adapter.
6. Screw in 2 m8 set screws to the inner holes (the curved side) of the motor mount. Ensuring that the motor mount is flat, hand tighten the 2 m8 set screws.
7. Check once more that the motor mount is flush with the hangar adapter. **(This is crucial!)**
8. Incrementally tighten the 2 set m8 set screws to 16Nm each.
9. Check again if the motor mount is flush (Have I not emphasized how important this is?)
10. Screw in the remaining 2 m8 set screws into the motor mount holes and incrementally tighten them to 16Nm.
11. Check to see if it's flush once last time. I promise this is the last time! If it's not flush, you'll have to start over from step 6. If it is flush, in no particular order, remove each m8 screw, apply loctite 242/243 or similar, and screw and tighten it back in to 16Nm. *You should only add or remove 1 m8 set screw at any one time.*

## *(Installing the Motor & Pinion)*:
12. Remote the wheel from the axle.
13. Place the motor (NOT INCLUDED IN THE KIT) with the cable facing the board side onto the motor mount.
14. Hand tighten the motor onto mount. (You should not be able to move it along the mount after.)
15. Apply loctite 638/648/680 onto the motor shaft and slide the pinion onto the motor shaft.
16. Use the 3d-printed washer provided to ensure the a 1.5mm gap between the motor mount and the pinion.
17. Let it sure for a minimum of 30minutes before continuing with the installation process.
## *(Installing the Spur Gear)*:
18. Lightly loosen the motor from the motor mount so you can slide it along the motor mount but not so much till the point where you can rattle the motor.
19. Push the motor away from the truck.
20. Place both 6706RS bearings into the spur gear.
21. Push the spur gear to the end of the bearing adapter.

## *(Adjusting the Backlash)*:
22. Using a piece of 70 to 80gsm paper (standard notebook paper), fold it in 2 and place it inbetween the spur gear and the pinion.
23. Slide the pinion along the motor mount such that it forms a tight mesh with the spur gear and hand tighten the 2 motor screws furthest from the spur gear.
24. Rotate the pinion or the spur until the piece of paper rolls out.
25. Remove the spur gear from the bearing adapter.
26. Tighten the remaining 2 motor screws.
27. Similar to step 11,  tighten all 4 motor screws to 6Nm each, with loctite 242/243 or similar.

## *(Installing the Wheel Adapter)*:
28. Screw in 6 M3X10MM screws into the flywheel adapter.
29. Place the flywheel adapter into the core of a wheel. (Ensure you,'re putting it on the correct side of the wheel, it should be the side closest to the bushings when you slide the wheel in.)
30. Wrap the V-ring around the adapter and ensure it's flush with the wheel.
31. Carefully place the spur gear back onto the hangar adapter (the side with the larger holes must be facing you, away from the motor mount), ensuring it meshes nicely with the pinion. (Give it a quick turn to make sure it spins well).
32. Apply your lubricant of choice to the spur gear and pinion at this stage, making sure both the pinion and the spur gear are coated thoroughly.
33. Using 5 m3x10mm screws, secure the gear enclosure onto the motor mount.
34. Remove the wheel adapter from the wheel while ensuring that you do not to move the position of the v-ring.
35. Attach the flywheel adapter onto the spur gear by aligning the 6 holes of the spur gear with the 6 m3 socket heads.
36. Install your wheels on the axle just like you would any regular wheel, aligning the spokes on the wheel adapter to the holes of your wheel core and tighten it. (Don't forget your speed rings!)
37. If you purchased a bashguard, install it with the m3 screws provided into the following holes.
38. Voila! You're done! :smile:

I've tested my gear drive to the extent where I think it works well enough to be sold to the DIY community. I'd say that these are still in the prototyping phase and the price that it's sold at reflects this.

More information on the testing process and updates on it are shared in post #55 and is tagged below as the solution to the thread.

Looks great!

What kind of gearing options would you offer, If none would the gear drive work with 90mm wheels and still have OK ground clearance?

As of now, it has a 2.65 gear ratio and is designed to work with 97 and 107mm wheels. I can probably get it smaller to work with 90mm wheels :D

Are the actual gears plastic? Personally I wouldn't want plastic gearing without a belt. A friend of mine had broken/worn gears in a short time. After seeing that I'm not so sure.

But your design looks awesome.

@UKRider 

I can only assume you are living in a bubble & as per your limited forum experience you have done no forum research? steel/pom gear combos have proven to work quite well in rc/eSk8!

You see I got a high kv motor. So just a low gearing would work great for me.
97 - 107 for regular motors 170-205 kv
And for peeps like me with a 245kv I would put on a 90mm.

So the new question is ignoring 'comfortable gearing ratios etc,
Would 90mm wheels work with the drive?

@brenternet 
Yup! It'll be a single drive on a standard caliber 184mm. I have another version for the extended caliber trucks and the tb218, just gotta invert the mount. :smiley:

@UKRider
 They're CNCed from POM, yes a kind of plastic. I'm not sure what material those gears of yours are made off, but people in this forum have been using the combination of steel and POM with good results!

@Blitz
I tend to go bigger on my wheels and have a lower KV on my motors simply because of the riding comfort i get from 97mm wheels and above. If i do decide to sell these, i'll definitely try to design it to accomodate 90mm wheels (I think it's very possible tbh, but i wont know till I re-design the mount and enclosure.)

No need to get so sensitive. Only stating what I have seen. Everyone has there own preferences, Gears only, belts, hubs and so on.

I actually like the look of gears.

Redesigned it a little to accommodate smaller wheels (97mms) better (chopped off the end by 5mm to give it better ground clearance). With this current gear setup (Module 1.5), I don't think i can get it any smaller to fit 90mm wheels.

Most recent update!

It'll be 2 weeks before my CNCed mounts and motors arrive, can't wait!
In the mean time, my HP Jet-Fusioned parts have arrived and everything fits! :smiley: Will try to source for a transparent cover (kinda cool to see the internals).
Also updated my design to make space for dual-6355s on the E-Caliber hangar or dual-6374s on the TB218 hangar. Unfortunately, the current design will only accomodate up to a single 63XX on a regular caliber ll mount.

![IMG_20180923_195604%20(1)|650x500](upload://4i1JvKSnhbCZX5h9yJWhrNaKNBf.jpeg) 
![Dual%20Drive%20Render|650x500](upload://aB5m2jd9E1Uanf8aYforNXyCN7I.jpeg) 

In response to the module used - honestly, use whatever module you want, each comes with its pros and cons, but generally, with a larger module comes a larger backlash which may or may not be beneficial depending on what you're designing for. I chose a module  of 1.5 mainly because the COTS pinion that I managed to find happened to be just that. :smiley:

@Vanarian No plans on releasing the price at the moment. This project is still in its early stages and i'll test the shit out of this drive before i sell it. Plans are to do 2 iterations (currently on the first) to work out all the kinks before finally selling the 3rd.  

@Jc06505n Yeap, a kegel mount has already been modelled, though the drive would only probably be able to support 100mm Boas. ><.

So, the parts are here. Time to get it going. I'm currently in the middle of building a dual belt drive on an aileron deck, so getting another build up to test this will have to wait for abit. I might decide to replace a belt drive on one of my single drive builds to save me some time, we'll see. As always, some pics! :smile:

Also, decided to go with red for additional speed.

Some updates (17/10/18):

After about 100km on the drive, it's still running really good. I will continue testing this version it breaks or till I hit 1000 km, whichever comes first. Riding about 20 to 30km per day after work to test this out.. it's really tiring. (Testing of this drive involves riding at speeds of 20 to 35kmh up and down 10 to 25% inclines to really stress test the drive system).

Few changes to the next version:

* Integrating the Caliber Adapter and Washer together. Also changed chamfer angle to fit Kegel adapters in the future.
* Increasing width of the Motor Cover Case by 2mm to increase motor shaft clearance (The drive can now work for a max motor shaft length of 30mm).
* Decreasing bearing clearance for an interference fit to the spur gear.
* Increasing size of spur gear mounting holes for a looser fit and better alignment tolerances.
* Exploring the possibility of a CNC-ed POM spur gear.

Thanks for the suggestion, but my part's aren't FDMed. They're made with hp jet fusion (a more advanced sintering process) are made from Nylon PA12. It's incredibly strong, but really expensive with each gear running me about 40usd, not exacly feasible for scaled production. I dont think shapeways is any cheaper too ): ..

#The Build Post with Updates

Hey everyone! Decided to design a sealed, compact gear drive (2.65 Ratio) of my own to fit 63mm motors while making it compatible with any 184mm caliber trucks commonly available. I&#39;m unsure if this will be for sale in the future, but I&#39;ve already ordered some of the necessary parts and will making one soon to test it out! Making this thread to be my build and designing log :D any inputs will be greatly appreciated!

_**Version 0.1**_
![Newest 644x450](upload://xKv5nQ2jL5QSDxLljEcQntGQUg5.jpg)

_**Version 0.2**_
![Kegel%20Gear%20Drive 644x500](upload://7fsbBFsokYXXUYM9ULcQSh3SrPP.jpg)

Materials forming the gear drive:
**Mount:** T6 Aluminium
**Gear:** HP Jet-Fusion Nylon PA12 (May change to CNC-ed POM if Jet Fusion doesn&#39;t work)
**Pinion:** Steel
**Wheel Adapter:** HP Jet-Fusion Nylon PA12
**Mount Cover:** HP Jet-Fusion Nylon PA12
**Seal:** V-Ring Seal

Let me know what ya&#39;ll think!

**Update (09/09/18):**
3rd iteration through 3d printing. Got all the parts to fit nicely. (Ignore the bashed up motor :smile:) ![IMG_20180909_225604 666x500](upload://9ie5PADyuNniKCYWKgLc8zJNlnv.jpg)

**Update (10/09/18):**
Redesigned it a little to accommodate smaller wheels (97mms) better (chopped off the end by 5mm to give it better ground clearance). Also made the overall footprint of this drive slightly smaller.

With this current gear setup (Module 1.5), I don&#39;t think i can get it any smaller to fit 90mm wheels.

**Update (11/09/18):**
Made it EVEN smaller to hopefully accomodate 90mm wheels now. Internals remain the same. Time to CNC them all!

**Update (13/09/18):**
Renamed to the Aortal Gear Drive (Name was derived from the blood-red lube i&#39;m going to be using)
![IMG_20180912_202513 666x500](upload://ukeAaAkcc694c5muAfhtazxg4Dc.jpg)

Designed a logo to 3d print on to the Cover.
![aortal 507x499](upload://pzKZKq0A0O3ka9Y1venUGRI560c.jpg)

Designed a Kegel-core mount so Kegel wheels shall now fit on this Drive!

**Update (26/09/18):**
It&#39;ll be 2 weeks before my CNCed mounts and motors arrive, can&#39;t wait!
In the mean time, my HP Jet-Fusioned parts have arrived and everything fits! :smiley: Will try to source for a transparent cover (kinda cool to see the internals).
Also updated my design to make space for dual-6355s on the E-Caliber hangar or dual-6374s on the TB218 hangar. Unfortunately, the current design will only accomodate up to a single 63XX on a regular caliber ll mount.

**Update (30/09/18):**
Fine tuned everything, down to how tight the V-Ring sits. Made a BOM for this gear drive. Eagerly waiting for all the parts to arrive on 8th Oct before I begin assembly and testing. Here&#39;s the Aortal Gear Drive in all its glory - This will be the final render and I will be working on a skid plate now.

![Turntable 600x450](upload://AkkPS8Am4JQKJF1rSahmbGQWvBK.gif)

**Update (10/10/2018):**
So, the parts are here. Time to get it going. I&#39;m currently in the middle of building a dual belt drive on an aileron deck, so getting another build up to test this will have to wait for abit. I might decide to replace a belt drive on one of my single drive builds to save me some time, we&#39;ll see. As always, some pics! :smile:

**Update (11/10/2018):**
**Test 1:** 15-18kmh @ a 10% gradient.**
**Microphone:** Huawei P20 Pro
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoZZjb3qyfk&amp;feature=youtu.be

**Test 2:** 25-30kmh @ a 10% gradient.
**Microphone:** Huawei P20 Pro
https://youtu.be/_j2FA3eHOU8

**Update (17/10/18):**
After about 100km on the drive, it&#39;s still running really good. I will continue testing this version it breaks or till I hit 1000 km, whichever comes first. Riding about 20 to 30km per day after work to test this out.. it&#39;s really tiring. (Testing of this drive involves riding at speeds of 20 to 35kmh up and down 10 to 25% inclines to really stress test the drive system).

Few changes to the next version:

* Integrating the Caliber Adapter and Washer together. Also changed chamfer angle to adapt Kegel adapters in the future.
* Increasing width of the Motor Cover Case by 2mm to increase motor shaft clearance (The drive can now work for a max motor shaft length of 30mm).
* Decreasing bearing clearance for an interference fit to the spur gear.
* Increasing size of spur gear mounting holes for a looser fit and better alignment tolerances.
* Exploring the possibility of a CNC-ed POM spur gear.

**Update (27/10/2018):**

* 250km in and still going strong. Loctite 638 stuff is really insanely strong, I&#39;m surprised at how well it has been holding up.
* Range test has shown an increase in efficiency of about 15 to 20% compared to my previous belt drive. (Tests were conducted using the same board and rider, on the same test route. The amount of energy (Wh) expanded was then recorded to calculate).
* Re-lubed at the 200km mark. V-RING seems to be working really well with very minimal gunk build-up.
* Have managed to source for CNC-ed POM gears as an alternative to 3D printing.
* Made some changes to the 3D printed cover. Increased its width (to achieve a more seamless design) while making it more hollow cheaper to 3d print).
* The motor mount seems to be working flawlessly so far, secured with 4xM8 set screws torqued to 16Nm each, secured with loctite 243.
* Motor mount screws came loose at the 130ish km mark - have since torqued them down to 6Nm and secured them with loctite 243.
* Will now be gauging the interest of these drives for sale. Check the first post for more information.
* The testing continues.

**Update (29/10/2018):**

* Talked to my suppliers, based on the gauged interest, i've decided to order 20 sets, 10 Left and 10 Right sets. (A dual rear drive would require 1 of each set.)
* To keep the cost down, and to have a variety of options, I've decided to have it be in a clear finish (shot-peened & clear anodized.) I would then spray paint it to a variety of colours (right now: Candy Red, Candy Blue and Flat Black).
* I've made a google order form for those who are interested to get a set or multiple sets. Due to the limited amount of sets i'll be ordering, I'll be selling the kits on a first come first served basis. The final price will also be reflected when I issue the payment request through the PayPal emails listed in the google form. I will also update the final price here on the forums.

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgBuTulJXbCGO6cEv7lBuWa77PZ0V3FDgCUdaqh94DBtw1KA/viewform

**Note: I&#39;m interested to know if anyone would be interested to purchase these gear drives if I can get the price to around 150USD incl. intl shipping per set (ONE DRIVE) Price should be higher once I've figured everything out, it'll range from 150 to199 USD. (It will include everything in except the motor.) Am thinking of CNCing a batch to lower production costs and sell the rest.**

More information to come your way soon, once I have things finalised with my suppliers.

Wanted to ask the reason as to why it is limited to 107mm? would it be possible to fit the upcoming @torqueboards 110mm on these as well? :smile: I would be interested for a small cruiser board they definitely are compact and really affordable for gear drives!

It even works on 97mm haha (tested for the first 50km). Anthing larger than 97mm on an abec core will work.

I'm working on a kegel core now, but it's really low on my priorities now simply because only 100mm wheels can work with this drive.

Yeah, I'm not really in this to make money, the pricing simply factors in a little of my labour costs + the costs of the items and shipping. Free shipping may be a stretch, but i'll see how much it costs and update the price accordingly. My aim is to make it an affordable gear drive for everyone.

I've thought about releasing the files, but I didn't see the point in the end because you'd have to have CNC contacts to build it, not something one can 3d print.

150 even for one is a steal. I haven't seen any gear drives this small at that price yet. I re-read the post and saw that you got it to fit 90mm? would 90mm boa hatchlings work on these? :star_struck:

I did ask him regarding 90mm but the clearance would be very little. It's possible buuut it comes with lotsa gear box scrapes.

Yeah, it'll really be pushing the clearance with 90mm wheels. You could mod the mount and add in a bashgard at the bottom by drilling 2 M3 holes and adding a 3d printed part or thin 1mm plywood strip.

The colour is NOT finalised yet, the final finish will be shot-peened and anodized (will do a google spread sheet to find out which colour the majority would prefer), not spray painted. I could apply a different colour with a 2k spray paint coat for extra $ though (would have to purchase the paint etc.)

I'll see what I can do regarding the bash guards. Through my test rides, i have isolated the places where it get dinged up the most, may 3d print a bash guard for the part and release the file for people to print it and replace it when it gets destroyed.

Yeah, just 2 to 3 M3 mounting holes on the underside of the motor mount. Am thinking if I should add those holes or simply let people customize if by drilling it out themselves.

Nylon won't necessarily make it more durable, it'll probably just as scratched up as one in PLA - imagine taking the bash guard and grinding it against a belt sander ><.

yup they do. and I that knob isn't measured in total length figured I could always shave it down to get them to get clearance but I'm not 100% on that

just checked out maytech's site and the motor size shows 6354 but its titled as a 6355. odd, probably 6355 including the little knob already

Will you consider selling partial kits, and share parts of the kit or at least some critical dimensions for printing on a limited basis?

I assume it would be cost prohibitive to produce herringbone/helical motor gears, and I would love to be able to purchase most of the kit, but print nylon herringbone gears. My fully printed gear enclosure thing for TB mounts didn't really work out in the end, and some purpose built mounts like yours are looking really good right now... But I don't want to go back to Spurs after trying herringbones. 😋😎

You'd just need to mod the spur gear adapter (1 3d printed part) to get it working for any other wheel :slight_smile: I can help you out with that.


Side note: It seems like there's alot of interest in this gear drive, I'll get to making a google sheets soon to take people's orders down. 

I'm also not sure what is needed to be done before i sell anything on the forums, so if @moderators can advice, that'll be great.

if its cheaper for @skunk to send them to me instead of directly to you, I can take care of shipping and forward that as well

So regarding Surfrodz, which model truck is the most common? RKP or TKP? I need a dummy's guide to this truck as i've heard some good stuff about it but not too sure about the differences. Wouldn't a RKP be better than a TKP for high speeds for example?

## \#124 Posted by: Wraith Posted at: 2018-10-27T08:03:18.634Z Reads: 202

yeah thats true, RKP for stability at higher speeds. TKP is just super dive-y and carvy on lower speeds making it ideal to use on carver or cruiser builds.

I just stick to RKPs generally. they're precision trucks with great stability and zero slop. They cost more and are only made in the US so getting them outside the US is not as easy afaik

**Update (29/10/2018):**

* Talked to my suppliers, based on the gauged interest, i've decided to order 20 sets, 10 Left and 10 Right sets. (A dual rear drive would require 1 of each set.)
* To keep the cost down, and to have a variety of options, I've decided to have it be in a clear finish (shot-peened & clear anodized.) I would then spray paint it to a variety of colours (right now: Candy Red, Candy Blue and Flat Black).
* I've made a google order form for those who are interested to get a set or multiple sets. Due to the limited amount of sets i'll be ordering, I'll be selling the kits on a first come first served basis. The final price will also be reflected when I issue the payment request through the PayPal emails listed in the google form. I will also update the final price here on the forums.

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgBuTulJXbCGO6cEv7lBuWa77PZ0V3FDgCUdaqh94DBtw1KA/viewform

For those who are interested, do fill it out. No commitments here, just gauging interest, but will send out an payment request when it's ready for shipping.

General Update:

I've decided to revise the drive slightly - Version 2.

* V1 is working perfectly for me still, over 300km and running smoothly.

* Because of the varying differences in the profiles of cast caliber trucks, I've decided to engage @Linny to help with turning these trucks down to reduce any slop in the drive system. We will be working together to bring these drives to you guys (: The V1 works perfect with my calibers simply because I modeled the profile of the bearing shaft after the profile of my calibers to ensure a tight fit. The final product will hence include the lathed caliber ll hanger (with the basplate & bushings) along with the drive system. (Think of it as precision-cast trucks :D). This opens a new can of worms due to the 3 different caliber profile trucks in the market - (Standard 184mm calibers (For single 63xx), E-calibers (For dual 6355s) and TB 218mms (For dual 6374s).. I'll guess people can indicate the setup they're looking for and purchase the appropriate trucks through a down-payment of sorts.. I'll figure this out.

* Other than changing the bearing shaft design slightly, I've also decided to go with a large bearing to seal the drive from the wheel side as opposed to a radial seal or a v-ring. I'm intending to minimize friction and power losses, and hence the decision to omit friction rubber seals. Also, from a cost perspective, this is cheaper than a radial seal and should do the job. Also, the dimensions of the bearing seal will be the same as a radial seal or a V-ring, which leaves the option to purchase a radial seal/v-ring and swap it out if anyone isn't comfortable with it. I'll be trying this method to see how well it works.

* I've also decided to go with a key-way on the pinion - managed to find some COTS pinions with a key-way and hub, where @Linny would be helping to lathe the hub away. The pinion should then be secured with loctite 638/648/680. Easy.

* Even though I have contacts to CNC POM, I'm thinking I'll be sticking to Nylon PA12, unless I get more orders. I'm realizing that I am actually incurring a lot of financial risk in getting this drive out to you guys. (I'm practically selling it near cost, and if I'm left with any unsold stock, i'll make a loss.)

* I will be creating a group chat soon for those who have indicated interest in the drive and will take their comments and suggestions into consideration as I move forward designing the drive. V2 has already been designed (very simple yet impactful changes made.)

That's all folks!
```

Great idea, I will see if I can do something similar on mine since I’m afraid the losses for the axial seal will be too big

How do you plan to guarantee that the gear and the 3D printed case are concentric? 

Also be cautious about turning the hangers, I did on my Paris 195 to fit a 17mm pulley bearing and it bent after a few 100’s kilometers

Down to 17 to fit a bearing with 17 I.D., the unturned diameter was between 18.5 and 19 mm due to it being cast, so not a lot of material removed but it made all the difference, I have ridden one not turned for a lot longer and no problems

It’s hard to show on the picture, but the motors at a lot close board side than road side, also it was a pain to take the wheel out due to the bearing

**Update: 10/11/18**

To make the drive agnostic to any hanger (this means we can install the gear drive to almost any hanger now), we decided to change the motor mount slightly with a 19mm hole instead of a caliber profile that attaches to the motor mount using 4xM8 set screws (there will be 3 flat spots for the set screws to sit on (much like how one installs a motor pulley onto a motor shaft - can be seen from the pictures). The motor mount will sit on the 19mm lathed portion of the truck. Following that the truck is stepped down to 17mm to hold the bearings for the spur gear and the wheel adapter.

Stay hyped for v2! Will be ordering parts soon!

Here's a pic of the lathed hangar! 19 to 17mm step down!

From a printed adapter with slop, to exactly 17mm for two, which will eventually be three bearings which fit snugly ![20181110_110658|690x388](upload://nEBE2RWJE5lyqFtuaDiaZy99oak.jpeg)

I'm using UKG bearings from china for now. We have local stores that sell NSK bearings for about 12bucks a pop, but i honestly don't see the point in getting high-end bearings. These bearings arent taking nearly much load as those on your wheels. I'm actl planning to get a set of NSKs vs my taobao bearings though, just to test the difference in resistance and what not.

That said, i don't think they have to be top-end bearings? What're your thoughts?

I kind of agree with you, but for 12 bucks the NSK is half of the price from what I pay here

The second tier ones may work forever or may not, it’s hard to know 

What I would do is calculate the loadings and see how close they are to the limit, if it’s way lower you should be fine

Damn. NSKs are expensive where you're at. haha. I could buy some and have them shipped over if it's cheaper for you? :stuck_out_tongue: 

Doubt they're anywhere close to the rated load rating nor RPM limits, considering these are way bigger bearings than the 608s we use on the wheels or 698s on motors ><.

You probably wouldnt have to send me the hanger. Have you read the recent update on the drive? 

[quote="nuttyjeff, post:172, topic:67496"]
**Update: 10/11/18**

To make the drive agnostic to any hangar (this means we can install the gear drive to almost any hangar now), we decided to change the motor mount slightly with a 19mm hole instead of a caliber profile that attaches to the motor mount using 4xM8 set screws (there will be 3 flat spots for the set screws to sit on (much like how one installs a motor pulley onto a motor shaft - can be seen from the pictures). The motor mount will sit on the 19mm lathed portion of the truck. Following that the truck is stepped down to 17mm to hold the bearings for the spur gear and the wheel adapter.

@nuttyjeff I tried your solution for sealing using a bearing between the gear and the case, unfortunately for the Trampa wheel the smallest bearing I can fit must have 55m I.D. so a 61811 bearing is required, which is really expensive from the sources I've found, will check some local shops

But nice solution for your design

**Update 14/11/2018**

* I have ordered 20 motor mounts to be CNCed (based on the v2 design). Of these 20 drives, ill be assembling a dual drive for myself and @Linny, leaving 16 sets to be sold. As of now, there's interest for more than 20 sets and hence will be selling them based on a first-come-first-serve basis.
* I will be sending PMs to the people who have indicated interest to ask them if they would like a lathed TB hanger/E-caliber hanger/normal caliber hanger. I will also need confirmation of the orders/ a deposit before I proceed to order said hangers.
* The new pinions I ordered fit, and now include a keyway. The hub of the pinion will be grinded/lathed away!

I think everyone will ask so,

What motors fit with each hanger?

What's the price difference of the hangers options?

What's the new all-in price?

I love the progress but I always get worried when meat is removed from trucks. Wish there was time for you to test them for a bit before committing.

Still excited!

## \#208 Posted by: nuttyjeff Posted at: 2018-11-14T13:08:26.279Z Reads: 238

I'm definitely still going to test them when I get em. We hardly removed much from the trucks, from a 20mm ish diameter to 19mm. Reason for doing so is to ensure perfect concentricity throughout the drive, with the added benefit of having the motor mount agnostic to any hanger. At 19mm, you have nothing to worry about, even paris trucks are close to 19mm in diameter :slight_smile: 

* For dual 6374 motors and below - TB 218mms.
* For dual 6355 motors and below - E-Calibers
* For single 63xx motors - Any Caliber styled hanger.

I will be probably be purchasing the E-Calibers from @longhairedboy and the TB 218mms from @torqueboards. You could probably head over to their shops to check the pricing out :slight_smile:  

I'm still waiting on @Linny to finalise the new total price with the trucks. He will be adding the cost to turn the hangers into the total price. However, the price of the drive will remain at 150USD (but I might have to charge a little for shipping, just found recently (through my mass clearance sale) that shipping to the USA isn't as cheap as I thought it was going to be. With the added weight of the trucks, it will be impossible for me to cover the cost of the drive.

Glad you're still excited! I am too!

Nice to see this going forward

About the concentricity, pay extra attention to it, if you hold one side of the hanger on the lathe and mill the other one it will not be concentric

If you hold both side there is a chance that it still won’t be concentric, that happened in mine and ruined the core of my kegels 

Ideally you would want to just secure the side you are milling and see if you can reverse mount the tools on the lathe 

What matters is that the 8mm axle is concentric with the bearing seats on that particular side, if you try to be concentric across both sides you will have a bad time

yeah, you can't use just any plastic with the V-ring, it has to be slightly wear resistant, which the PA12 is. Closing on 500km on the V-ring version and still holding strong. Am hoping the new bearing seal model works out so people can get more creative with their enclosure material options and hopefully print some themselves.

**Update 21/11/18**

* Bearings have arrived! They fit nicely! Have ordered the remaining bearings needrd for the preorder sale.
* CNC production has started and the motor mounts will be with me in 2-3 weeks time (supplier's ETA).
* Every other part has been ordered, except for the hp fusioned parts. Still doing last minute revisions (aesthetics) before sending them for printing.
* To make assembly of the drive as painless as possibly, I will write a detailed set of instructions (with pictures) and a link will be given to those who were in the pre-order. I will also be 3d printing some 'tools' to help with the assembly of the drive (so that everything is aligned as can be, to remove as much of the user errors involved in the installation process).
* After this preorder sale, I'm probably not going to sell any more of these drives - realised that I'm close to making a loss, or if not am already making a loss by selling these. Not worth the effort >< imho, but getting gear drives out to the commuity gives me a sense of fulfilment (: I apologize to those who have didn't manage to secure any Aortal drives during the preorder stage.
* I will, however be working on it on a more personal level and will continue publishing my updates here. I might make the CAD files open sourced if there's enough interest.

Assembling my dual aortal drives and @Linny's 2 x 1WD drives.

Everything fits as expected and hence there will be no delays in getting the pre-orders out the door. 

Some things to note, the colour of the cover our drives are black, same as those in the preorders. All other components will be heather grey, unlike those in the picture above. Why? Because we're special like that :smiley:

Alot of other parts are coming soon. Am currently working on ways I can cut costs on the gear drive, because I forgot to factor in import taxes, which would mean I will now be making a loss by selling these drives at the current price with free intl shipping (trucks and metal parts are not light, shipping prices are a bitch.) I'll see what I can work out.

The length, tip to tip would be approximately 126mm, with a width of 76.5mm.

The rolling resistance is very similar to pushing a non-electric longboard. Ran out of batt once and had to kick-push my board home, was amazingly easy to do. This was on the V1 with a V-ring seal - I'm expecting it to be slightly better with a bearing seal.

I use a marine grease called "TOYO EAJ8000", I'm certain most marine greases would work.

Took my drive up for a test run today, up the one of steepest hill in Singapore @ a 31% grade. I'm 75kg and it went up pretty easily. Also i love them photos, so i'm sharing :D

Is there a reason I never see fully steel gears on gear drives like this? It's always either POM or a combo of steel and POM. Would steel on steel have too much friction? I wonder if it's possible to make the gearbox completely sealed like a differential on a RWD car, and then have oil to lubricate it. Just a thought.

Did you have any of the same clearance issues similar to what @Kug3lis had on his urethane gear drives?  Are they able to run any sized 63xx dual motors without clipping the king pin or any parts of the base plate?  Currently myself and @moon are designing a drive train to address that issue, along with a few other things, and many added benefits IMO.  Would be very interested to see a normal 2 gear drive train that can run dual 63xx (I have the new TB 6380's) motors on stock trucks, like the TB 218's and have no issues with clearance...

The problem is that the shape of the mini hanger is not that accurate. I see no way to use it for gear drive without cnc machining the hanger. I have massive problems with alignment and shifting motor mounts (belt drive without crossbars). The normal hanger works better but cnc machining is still the best.

The shape of normal hanger is different to mini hanger because on mini hanger the mount sits more inwards and there is a different shape.

Thanks for your help though :slight_smile:

E: ok, I know this question is pretty stupid, but since both the hanger and mount for the gear drive are aluminum, would welding it be an option?

I just want something that I can set and forget.... I think I spoiled myself with marcmt88 s motor mounts 😂

^ This.

Trampa hangers have variance and yeah one set is not like the other.

Either machined by the drive vendor or a precision hanger like @3DServisas @Kaly  is the way to go with a Trampa baseplate/suspension parts. 

Expect @Nowind  to have a custom hanger 2019 & probably has one now already under wraps. I know he has recently made a MBS baseplate to replace the plastic one they have on the MBS Matrix II

17T Motor pinion gear
![20181224_202422|690x388](upload://v51fBbn4P2lLtBS7Xcai4BnYtDZ.jpeg) 

Not provided,
Motor, has to be 63xx to fit the mount

Tools you'll need!
2.5mm allen key
3mm Allen key
4mm Allen key
Skate tool
243 loctite, or any loctite for set screws
680 retaining compound, recommended for the motor pinion
Torque wrench
![20181224_202606|690x388](upload://y13O7leU4INVJjdSHgHZAd5ldeE.jpeg) 

SOME PREP WORK BEFOREHAND,
The motor shaft length from the edge has to be between 25~30mm. If it's longer than that, you will have to cut it down. I used an angle grinder for this, a dremel rotary tool with a cut off wheel works too.
![11|690x388](upload://98zFSpbGDh044IjydijVvBA9gxV.jpeg) ![22|690x388](upload://u6BZKsVuAqnr3CCN9VQupuVLzZW.jpeg) ![33|690x388](upload://wiecBLdBIjkJ0R1ATrTZM6RLkPj.jpeg) 


Now we will install the mount onto the hangar. Place your motor mount on the 19mm diameter shoulder, with the flat face of the motor mount facing out. If you are doing a dual drive, **install your motor on the mount later when you are doing the other side, if not you won't be able to do so once both mounts are on.** ![20181224_203004|690x388](upload://dS9SIaNZrJBJ1hHAs26wJazZHOg.jpeg) Plop the 3d printed assist piece over the axle and use the lock nut from the truck to tighten it slightly, with some wiggle room.![20181224_203012|690x388](upload://lL9Y8pWPp2UYajInIhNCsoW5AbD.jpeg)

Ensure the edge of the motor mount is parallel with the baseplate, this angle gives the most ground clearance. ![20181224_203141|690x388](upload://vBsQhaBtDoidc4wMcMVeITy52tf.jpeg) 

Once you've got it angled right, use your skate tool and tighten the lock nut to push the 3D print assist piece and the motor mount further in, locking it in place for the next step. ![20181224_203025|690x388](upload://avIxnYffQbpb9jyVir9EJFtyucE.jpeg)

Next, install the four M8 set screws. Long ones go on the curved spot, and the shorter ones go on the flat edges.![20181224_203343|690x388](upload://6TUCjWMx5aC4Ae4ld8O1ZJjNv55.jpeg) 

Loctite time![20181224_203449|690x388](upload://iUZ39aS5tiExO05QSczx0v8v91V.jpeg) Apply loctite and screw all four in, but not tight.![20181224_203517|690x388](upload://bdF38r5ZTwts3pSWiIaWOXZyZ7T.jpeg) 

![20181224_203706|690x388](upload://AauretlR0uGfOrPp82rbVSWsant.jpeg) 

Now grab your torque wrench, and set it to 6Nm![20181224_203817|690x388](upload://59h2OBkYwk4bYpbU52HyDWaTJ1O.jpeg) 

You will need to tighten the set screws in this order, but make sure all of them are snug first.![Image2|690x388](upload://iCiCU433q1Df7nfRACUZUMntFyB.jpeg) 

![20181224_203824|690x388](upload://sDCL9Q92kNxci8ZL29G3h1khCci.jpeg) 

After all four are tightened, set your wrench to 14 Nm now, and torque it down hard
![20181224_203846|690x388](upload://e7KzDK9sgR91cAVYtKG2lFUp61F.jpeg) 
Once all four set screws are done, you will have a mount that will never move. You can remove the lock nut and 3D print assist piece.

Note that the 19mm shoulder will pop out by 1mm from the mount, this is the 'integrated' washer.![20181224_204015|690x388](upload://d1fYrotR1ajUuQCLwArdepIELFg.jpeg) 

Next, install the bashguard onto the motor mount. We did it at the last step and it was a bit difficult due to the hangar being in the way..

Use two of the button head screws to install it on.![20181224_211254|690x388](upload://3I96YjZbcZfSBKYG1IY5ztQH1nI.jpeg) 
![20181224_211346|690x388](upload://ficHzRxqga3C7EHMUJrT8GocVcy.jpeg) 

Use the last two button head screws on the other side of the mount, to seal the holes. ![20181224_211848|690x388](upload://kD05s4artYPqcIhaSjH886uQGR.jpeg) 

Now onto the spur gear, pop the two 17mm bearings on both sides of the gear.
![20181224_204045|690x388](upload://5T1iNiNIQcD9r1fcOCLhUThsW1d.jpeg) 

Since this is single drive, the motor can be installed now. Once again if you are doing a dual, please install the motor at the first step when you do the other side.![20181224_204122|690x388](upload://aZM7CDesPgk8hL4wqzk8yRsYfsr.jpeg)

Ensure the bolts are tightened slightly, you should be able to push the motor forward and back, like adjusting tension for a belt. ![20181224_204405|690x388](upload://nGx6J1dcfTygZ4MjCsXzVXztZBB.jpeg) 

Next, slot the motor pinion on, If it does not fit, you might need to file the motor pinion a bit for a snug fit.![20181224_204430|690x388](upload://kLYxLs0Lb2N3A1Qk62WYDPCfGBQ.jpeg) 

Use the large washer included in the kit, it's 1mm thick so it'll give the spacing for your pinion and mount.![20181224_204438|690x388](upload://p2ec2iprvOa6XUNK4USh7CPtH4W.jpeg) Clean the shaft and inside of the pinion with a solvent, and apply the retaining compount to the shaft and pinion hole. Not too much on the shaft, as it might squeeze out and get on the motor mount and even worst, the bearing.
![20181224_204616|690x388](upload://g7hNpBQfaBsR8K3Hr5eMYjBbP7v.jpeg)
![20181224_204717|690x388](upload://tbl7SLUg2pVvP6GiK67tGLfMcaa.jpeg)  ![20181224_204724|690x388](upload://surI8IB6LOdY6AaWIuwrIhOMD0Q.jpeg) 

![20181224_204756|690x388](upload://5mqG3Eq4GR6TLzwEXRXpEzeWoIK.jpeg) 

Pop the pinion on with the retaining compound,remove the washer and let it sit for a few mins. It should harden pretty quickly. Try to do this quickly because it sets fast, and if you mess up you will need to heat it up to 500 celcius to remove it and redo....![20181224_204804|690x388](upload://kzQqbfOE776x1VNHhBE9uFdKSQC.jpeg) 

Next, take a piece of printer paper and fold it in half, place the spur gear on the hangar and slot the paper in between the gears. ![20181224_205045|690x388](upload://bvKn7MrHJ6DKaszRnagTBpyIP2b.jpeg) 

Push the motor in and let the gears engage with each other. Snug but not too tight, a little backlash is needed.![20181224_205055|690x388](upload://7ka7lT0DaBLuq5iBlen1fP5URnp.jpeg) 

Once you have the backlash set, tighten the four motor screws in a diagonal fashion. ![20181224_205118|690x388](upload://4LKc4ersQGKPAbo4HNkNaubmjFd.jpeg) 

Do remember to have the spur gear placed correctly at the end. The holes with the recess should be facing out, like in this picture.![20181224_205215|690x388](upload://5DbtXjU3HUBoiobkY6EB5y3hPWo.jpeg) With the spur gear removed, it's easier to tighten all four. **Do not loctite it yet, do a test ride after it's done and hear if it sounds fine. If it's too loud you might need to readjust**. Once you are happy with the sound, then loctite the motor screws.
![20181224_205234|690x388](upload://9En1A0Pj0AECp7MLzCfZvKnSXfs.jpeg) 

Lube time. Use a grease that bonds well with the gears and is safe on Nylon. I used a marine grade grease and used a bunch of it. Use a popsicle stick and apply it generously to the gears. ![20181224_205340|690x388](upload://pGFq8clV6mOs3iqKnsASGPOSvr8.jpeg) ![20181224_205346|690x388](upload://bh0gBrmzGiDNwGir8zKz2Xh85z4.jpeg) ![20181224_205837|690x388](upload://2WtZeTSwzJi0bEjlIgdZst80Jj1.jpeg) 

Now comes the gearbox. Install it on the motor mount and use five socket screws and a 2.5mm Allen key to screw it down. ![20181224_210109|690x388](upload://8svv7GnY4o5V72KgBin1CgcbUO2.jpeg) ![20181224_210313|690x388](upload://c9LtWbSj5dWvtm7zIoAxuJwcekv.jpeg) 

Use six socket screws and install them to the Abec wheel adapter. ![20181224_210328|690x388](upload://eHnVcKBfaqdctwhQt1sjur86bmh.jpeg)![20181224_210517|690x388](upload://usSGuNK2NPU2Vw2TCqhu8EXkDrP.jpeg)

Next, place the big bearing on the Abec adapter, we will be doing a bearing seal. ![20181224_210529|690x388](upload://13qiNJm6mJLxKbNWBqxpEhh4s6P.jpeg) 

Press it onto the spur gear, engaging the six bolts into the other six holes on the spur gear.![20181224_210534|690x388](upload://33U4MhYKgDYqTXzkx7fqpHWIL49.jpeg) 


This one is optional, but if you want a secondary seal, place the 3rd and final 17mm bearing into the 17mm shoulder. ![20181224_210723|690x388](upload://4XCMSUBqwWZ4xjGY5ehNMf7VhG8.jpeg) 

Place the 4.5mm spacer onto the axle. ![20181224_211044|690x388](upload://5x8nhInM4yUPJkMBRkJaoqEo8n1.jpeg) 




Now, pop in your Abec wheel of choice.
![20181224_211211|690x388](upload://fVffwoIQJPjUODGcp13dFid5yPR.jpeg) ![20181224_211207|690x388](upload://lsAQ5muQLDtp1Wy2mgT5e8OC0bN.jpeg) ![20181224_211217|690x388](upload://e1WM34iFLBfd5bgHuiXow71v64L.jpeg) 


And it's done! Your drive is completed. If you are doing dual, repeat on the other side! Note that for dual, only diagonal or E-Calibers/TB 218s will fit. ![20181224_212058|690x388](upload://vc8gFl3s1buOHnd2Ge1qTOSheKn.jpeg) 

Now that your drive is assembled, install it to your build! Mine's coming soon.... shhh.![20181224_214005|690x388](upload://6wtCoae1OOEbVEQLxNQdMjoQG5c.jpeg)

I'm assembling mine now. So sweet. I have dual on e-calibers. The instructions, written and video, have been amazingly helpful. Thank you guys!

Notes and issues I've had:

- the paint inside the axle holes of the mount plate had to be sanded off, but I think there were burrs? Or the axle wasn't machine exactly conical. Things kept getting stuck, needing a lot of sanding and wiggling, with lots of chowder marks on the axle surfaces. Eventually got everything all the way in and aligned. Not so easy for me like the youtube video! :) I didn't mind the extra work, as long as everything lined up in the end, which it did.

- motor gears had some burrs, so motor shaft would not insert without some dremelling of the gear. Kind of a lot of dremelling.

- BKB 6354 shafts are just about the perfect length!

- The 3rd 17mm bearing that goes inside the wheel adapter -- if I use the huge bearing for the outer seal instead of the v-ring, alignment is slightly between the gear cover and the machined axle. The bearing will not fit. Good thing it's optional :slight_smile: Oh, I've only tried on once side so far.

Now I'm at the point where I install the wheels. Question for @nuttyjeff. You included a plastic spacer thing that's about the same size/shape as a skate wheel spacer. This part is not mentioned in the video or written instructions. And the 4.5mm plastic disc spacer. Do I need either or both with e-caliber?

Thanks again guys. This stuff was a pleasure to assemble, and so pretty!

Nice! No chopping needed?

Yeah, these gears arent very good, id admit. Im not buying COTS gears anymore, machining my own for future drives.

Which part is this again? I think i included a black metal one haha. It's for ecalibers. You insert it after inserting the 4.5mm nylon spacer.

EDIT: **From the start of the hanger axle, it's**

**Black nylon > Black Metal spacer > speed ring > (bearing, wheel spacer, bearing) > speed ring > nut.**

Roger that, everything fitting nicely. The spacer is indeed aluminum, anodized black (wow). It's so light I mistook for plastic, sorry!

Yah no chopping, perfect fit. I would note though, the shaft has a keyway, and 2 big flats. So not much contact for retaining compound. I don't think we can skip the key with this motor. BKB sells keys that are almost a perfect fit (they require a bit of sanding).

Did a noise test with a Unity. Seems to purrrrrrr.

I wish I could run them with 97mm given 6355, and for weight, but clearance looks tight.

@nuttyjeff @Linny 
Would I be OK with 97mm or would I be better of with 100+?  Im planning a short board build and really don't want to be high of the ground... 
And, is there a kegel pully option? Maybe an stl I can print? Thanks

It's entirely dependent on the terrain you ride on. If you ride on smooth pavements 97mm will suffice, else 107mms should work on most pavements.

Do note that the drive you received for the xmas present isn't the v2 but the v1 where installation instructions will be slightly different. PM me for the instructions should you need any help.

I see people mention kegel adapter is it something I can buy from you? Are they compatible with v1?

It's a one off adapter i made for prototyping, and is only compatible with the v2. @Jc06505n has it now haha.

Do you still have the single mentioned in an earlier post for sale? All I would need is the actual gearing, I have access to a machine shop for anything else.

That being said - if you don't have the single for sale... I do have access to a machine shop/CNC stuff. Possibilities of you dropping the files (or at least giving them to people wanting to make one-offs on personal equipment)

Dope thread in general tho, haha
