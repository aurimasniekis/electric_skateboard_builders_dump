Wow. That's surprising.  I'd love to the see the board more. Looks pretty awesome.  Wonder how the handle works.   Wish it would make it to production but that would be even more surprising.

Here in southern Cali I would say pretty popular from all the rich kids and hipsters at the beach/boardwalks with longboards.

I've met one other person with an e-board; I think they had a benchwheel or something.

Did I mention I have never seen a electric longboard with urethane wheels? I have only seen (5 to be exact)
E-MTBs

lightweight electric vehicles will be commonplace in the future....  sort of like the mobile phone is now.

skateboards happen to be a very good platform for a light weight vehicle. Very few mechanical parts, simple to operate & lightweight. Mostly made from cheap materials.

eboards are the future.

I'll see one every half hour During rush hour downtown in San Francisco. 


The weirdest part of that board and it's features ..you load it with groceries and it follows you home!  Wow.  So you walk home and your groceries get hit by a truck probably.

this makes me wanna book the car itself . and that built in handle for e~longboard ? is just an excuse  to ride it with a slim girlfriend . 55kg and above chubby g'frnds arent allowed on this one for sure . 
it also looked like its a dual satellite config . once in my hands , gonna switch mod it with @jacobbloy's dual hub :yum: . good idea Audi got for us eboarders . once car is parked , no need to walk 100m or 700m to home , work or  shopping mall . with that handle , you can again mod it to carry light weight items . laptop , 2 plastic bags of groceries , and many more . so cool .

The mechanicals are almost certainly boostedboard components: <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/9/9b63b1508e46b2453d5aa42f006b066f56c99905.jpeg" width="500" height="500">

That's a cool concept, and I actually like the fold up scooter mode (for other people), plus the bumper is a nice cool place to keep your board, but holy hell, did you see the size of the battery charger? It's enormous and weighs like 3 tons! Sure it's a pretty blue color, but how am I going to fit that into my backpack for when I get 6 miles away and have to recharge to get back to my...charger? :confused: :laughing:

And how do I mod my car to have a slide out ESk8 utensil drawer? That's the real question.

True on performance and price, but the boosted remote is the most refined remote short of whatever the Revol guys have. Power without control is great for skinned knee and ED visits. 

Btw, the Instagram videos of your night lights are pretty sick. üëç

I hate the boosted remote.  It gives my hand spasms.  Super awkward as u have to hold two levers at once

I have to do this on my truck somehow. It just has to be done. Maybe i could fit a drawer for two boards with an integrated charging system that runs off the alternator/battery. I need a welder.

the handlebars, it's just a bar coming up, is it connected to the hanger and the bar pivots or is it connected to the board and u turn with it? I'd like to try both.  Looks like it's just connected to the board 

Why are there no three wheeled razor scooter boards with trucks on the back?  Anyone ridden such a beast?  I think it sounds awesome.  Anyone can ride that and fully realize the power of their little motor.  I saw some company is starting up and trying to sell them but do it yourself people there aren't any.   I like the challenge of fitting it all inside the hollow aluminum deck.  They cost 50$ and one skate truck and two wheels, cheap.

yeah that would be a beast, especially dual drive with some large abecs on the back. 

I'd like to make a motorized scooter from one of the larger razors with pneumies too.

My point in posting this wasn't because I thought the board was cool. It was to bring awareness to the fact that a nice car manufacturers, who doesn't need gimmicks to sell cars is debuting a car with a built in e board. That's huge a deserves our attention.

They advertise that u can load ur board up with groceries and it will follow u home by tracking your phone.  Crazy....but how would that even be possible without any turning on the board?

I remember it saying the board could follow you home!  so you'd load it up with groceries and then walk and it follows you.  dont believe it but remember reading that.

"Follow mode: the board is a transport device for bags or searching bags: Connected wirelessly to a smartphone or smart-watch, the board mechanically follows its owner."

it would need so much more to do this

```
All four wheels would have to be controlled, even then the turning radius would be a ridiculous amount. They would slow one wheel down and speed up another. Or they could have pivoting trucks, who knows. I hope this one dosnt have fraud software that pumps more pollution than it says. Oh wait its an electric skateboard. Im sure they could still find a way.
