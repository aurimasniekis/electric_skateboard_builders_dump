Trucks assembly with intervention system - prevents unintended tilting from side to side, enables quick recovery from undesired jerks and the wobbly effect, and that keeps the skateboard rider smart and stylish. Solid reliable trucks are the most important items to have if the rider wants a competitive advantage when riding aggressively on the electric skateboard, or for smooth curving and cruising.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/9/a90749f1810f00e32830558381898f94df519262.jpg" width="690" height="388">

@anorak234 thank you for your comment. My aim is to educate riders of all types of skateboards that this innovation will improve board's performance and stability. Selling is not my main goal - I want riders to be aware of new ways to improve stability. I hope that helps.

I feel like I'm the only one besides OP who understands how this *might* work.

Springs are a lot easier to expand with your weight vs compressing a hard bushing. Harder bushings provide more stability at the cost of decreased turning potential/radius. With the springs, you can **theoretically** have softer bushings for increased turning radius, but yet have stability at higher speeds due to the stabilization force of the springs. The only downside (besides increased board weight) is it'll require a little more weight on each side to turn the board.

Springs expand more than a hard bushing can compress is the basic idea.

```
The only way to chip away at speed wobbles is to decrease the angle of your hanger in relation to your baseplate or deck. The way to do this is by shimming your back truck. Or by buying a lesser degree truck/baseplate. A 50 degree truck turns in faster than a 45 degree truck.  People have virtually eliminated speed wobble by using a 0 degree truck on the rear of their board. 
-Back to springs:
Channel trucks use springs. They wobble like a mofo at speed mounted on a deck with 45 degree nose and tail angles. Do you know what helped to lessen wobble with that set up in it's inception? Putting urethane eggs inside the springs. So is it the spring or the bushing that helps dampen wobbles?

You'll need at least four though. Lol. I do have to say that adding bungee cords to my old shitty mountain board did significantly increase stability at higher speeds. However, this was with REALLY worn trucks that had a lot of play in the pivot cup area. Definitely was an improvement though.

Yes, this. Springs cant really reduce speed wobbles without increasing the effort it takes to turn. Dampers can because dampers are 'soft' when moving slow (turning), and 'hard' when moving fast (wobbles).

@psychotiller Any conventional trucks (including precision trucks) with the present tensioners to support the conventional bushings are significantly more solid. The constant pulling of the tension springs to reach equilibrium dissipates the tilting from side to side "wobbly" effect quickly. The tension springs compensate for the weakness of the bushings. The springs pulling enables the board to stay upright and self-balance itself after the wheels encounter bumps in the road and/or after the rider completes a turn.

@smurf The tension springs mounted configuration is different to a conventional independent suspension system that would absorb the energy of each wheel independently, allowing the deck to ride undisturbed while the wheels follow bumps in the road. The present tension springs tensioners supports the bushings to absorb much of the up-and-down movement as the wheels move over irregularities in the road. It keeps the skateboard deck at an even level as well as keeping it relatively free from road shock and minimizing vibration.

@Jinra thanks for your kind comment – I feel we’re on the same wavelength. I sense there is a big task ahead of me in educating the skateboard riders. I welcome any support I can get to help riders appreciate that the Skateboardstabilizer will make their electric skateboard significantly more solid, stable and better able to handle the "wobbly" effect with fine steering control. With my stabilizer the electric skateboard axles will look more like racing car axles :) but more importantly riders will be able to enjoy the same benefits as described for both downhill riders and freeriders on my website.  Thanks again!

@Jinra Yes, I think I should make a short video as you suggested to help the cause – not risky for me to produce at all. In fact, I have been riding my Raptor 1 with the stabilizer installed since I filed the Patent application which was drafted by experienced Patent Attorneys who also have an engineering background.

```
Basically no. 
As the springs are compressed at rest and un-damped they will do the square root of nothing. Any effect they give to your board is purely coincidental, and likely caused by them effectively stiffening your truck which, as another member pointed out, would also be the effect gained from higher stiffness bushings. 
If that was an oil filled damper possibly fixed to the board not the truck you could have a similar setup to a motorcycle steering dampener which would work by greatly reducing the frequency at which the trucks could oscillate.

Any trucks with the present tensioners to support the conventional bushings are significantly more stable than the non-conventional trucks which don’t use the conventional bushings. This is because the conventional bushings, although they have drawbacks, are still essential to the skateboard’s stabilization and the present tensioners reinforces the conventional bushings to improve the overall skateboard stabilization.

racing motorcycles have similar issues as speed wobble with the front wheel - to counter that they have a dampener supressing rapid handle bar movement and it works. a hydraulic dampener. here i just see springs != dampening.

Sorry, have to add that our only vulnerability to speed wobbles is when we are flat and going straight. (Right where you're springs are doing nothing) As soon as you initiate any pressure toeside or heelside the bushings do their job. Saying you need something like this when all you need to do is change your bushings and/or tighten them down is downright false information. 

This forum has a lot of new members. Some of which have little to no longboarding experience. Good info is priceless. 

Peddle this junk elsewhere.

I respect anyones religious beliefs, but ' believing'  does not make something work well thats fundamentally a bad design. Please stop spreading rubbish on this forum.

Although increasing the stiffness of the trucks increases the speed at which wobbles start to occur, they also make it hard to steer around tight corners. Dampers are a fundamentally better option as they offer a high ' stiffness'  against wobbles which are relatively high frequency, but still allow easy turning and good carvyness because it has a low to no ' stiffness'  when turning (low frequency).

@Mobutusan your solution looks quite interesting! I think carver boards actually used something similar while they were developing their trucks.

I've never had speed wobbles myself so don't need anything new. I've got my trucks cranked down so hard most often I can barely do a u-turn but I like it.  But that price..maybe some unlucky person went down from wobbles would be willing to pay that but seems rediculous as I said. But how will you prove it works?  I'd like to see how you could do that.  How can you say it works otherwise?  I don't see logic that it would yet. 
@wmj259 I doubt I would use them even if free

Trampa also use a spring but include some type of bushing inside and on the page state "Loose steering will result in speed wobble at high speeds ". 
How could what you're doing be any different?

Thank you Hummie. You have asked me one of the important questions which I have been waiting for. Your question: "Trampa also use a spring but include some type of bushing inside and on the page state "Loose steering will result in speed wobble at high speeds ".  How could what you're doing be any different? Here is my answer. There are few obvious differences - one obvious one is I use tension springs, not compression springs.  They behave differently. With tension springs the movement of the axle engages the tension springs which store and release the pull energy in such a way that the skateboard maximizes the friction between the skateboard wheels and the road surface. For example, when the left wheel moves up due to a road bump, the gap between the board and the right wheel widens causing the right spring to expand, and the right spring will immediately retract to its normal state when the spring’s retracting strength is greater than the pressure applied to it. When the right spring retracts it forces the axle to push the left wheel to be in contact with the road surface. Equally, when the right wheel moves up it will be pushed down by the left spring when the spring’s retracting strength is greater than the pressure applied to it. Thanks for  your very good  question.

I prefer conventional bushings rather than some type of bushing. This is because the conventional bushings, although they have drawbacks, are still essential to the skateboard’s stabilization and the present tensioners reinforces the conventional bushings to improve the overall skateboard stabilization.

well, atleast he fulfilled one of jasons smaller ideas, a dual drive single motor. same power as a mono drive, bit more torque than one obviously because both back wheels are moving, thatd allow safer braking too, unless that's also someone else's build

Power decided by the motor, and torque by motor and gearing,  not if its two wheels drive or one.  Only one wheel can brake with this 

The explanation here for why a spring in tension would be any better than compression for stopping oscillations is a word salad without any substance.

   Been an exciting day on here: i'm sick in bed.

@skateboardstabilizer i see you sell a double mount for one motor.  I've never had one but from what I've read and makes sense to me you would need a one-way bearing or something of that sort on one of the two wheels if you plan to turn since the wheels can't be locked at the same speed as the outside wheel needs to do more rotations.  I've never tried it though but it sounds like you haven't either.   I think we're all curious about you and your maybe new business!   I think you should rework it. The spring thing is far fetched but the mounts seem cool and maybe just need that one-way bearing.
how bout you do a blow out sale and get rid of everything at cost!  If you even manage to send things to people within a week and they work you'll be doing better than many.  Build your rep then go for the jugular

@Hummie a single"sprag bearing" or ratcheting mechanism would allow independent wheel movement turning one direction while locking the axle going straight and turning the opposite direction. A differentiating device for a single motor would be the option . Dual sprag bearings would render brakes useless.

I don't think a live or locked axle would be a good option on a skateboard being the weight is transferred to the inside wheels when cornering. Unlike a gocart which transfers to the outside.  I have found Testing a thought gives more definitive answers than the thought itself.

rip, torque transfer was the term I should've used but yeah, by driving 2 wheels you're basically doubling the belt width which will give a higher torque transfer, seeing Jason put the boosted dual + against the raptor mono it showed that higher torque transfer = higher traction = higher acceleration, even though it had a higher torque transfer, the boosted board didn't have as much actual torque as the raptor mono cos boosted lost the hill climb. wait.. whats a one way bearing?

@memesupreme, the motor spins a solid, locked or live axle. Two cogs, pinions or pulleys attached to the live axle spin fixed and in sync with each other an unable to move independently from each other. This locked axle then is transferred to the wheels through the connection of the belts.  Imagine a 300lb man trying to make a 9' slow circle on this setup. Then imagine what the torque number would be on the 8mm shaft holding the two cogs in sync. It would make for a built in brake when carving. Very hard on belts and cogs.

Unfortunately this video doesn't show much. I think the best test would be if you ran a board on a treadmill with a heavy weight on the rear truck and tie the board to the treadmill so it stays on. Then you can press down on one side to create speed wobbles. After, you can do the exact same test with the stabilizers on to show if speed wobbles are less intense. You may want to show the turning potential of the board before each test as well so no one thinks you tightened the bushings for the stabilized one.

So it allows the separate drive trains to work independently but still from the same motor? Rather than both spinner exactly the same all the time.. ah I get it, if you try turning in a circle the inside wheel will travel less distance than the outside wheel, so if both wheels are forced to go the same speed you'll either slide, not be able to turn or possibly break the actual shaft? I think I'll stick with dual motors though😅 it's a cool concept though

For the Dual-Drive (single motor) initiative there are two possible solution options:1) with a Differential Gear  2) if some skidding is not an issue than I suppose we could tighten the rear truck, but loosen front truck. Perhaps we could ride the Dual-Drive (single motor) skateboard like a 3-wheel motorbike or down hill longboard? It might work because when riding a skateboard rarely do we corner sharp enough and most skateboard truck hangers are not very wide, so the wheels are fairly close together anyway. Just a tought...

Let's say this thing has the fixed axle on the left wheel and the right wheel has the one-way bearing,  when looking from above, and we take a left turn, the left wheel will have to be the sole torque as the right wheel has to go faster than the left. If we turn right we have ...a situation where the outside wheel can no longer freewheel faster than an inner powered wheel.  How is torque transferred then? The inner wheel again is the only one able to give torque as it's the slowest in the turn.

It can work without a one way bearing, except its no longer a longboard, its a go cart. The drive wheels truck cant be a turning one, it'd have to be a solid axel attatched to the board, not a truck baseplate, also you'll need super hard wheels for sli- I mean drifting without wearing out the wheels too much

You guys are Killin me and I just pulled the fork out if my eye from earlier.  The least of your problems from locking the rear is the two most discussed and important parts if a build, performance and range. Locking the rear will suck both of these out if your build. Second point: the irony is goddam hullarious: "skateboard stabilizer" is pawning a product that will break traction on one of the rear wheels you need for lateral force traction in a corner when at speed, actually making your skateboard less stable. Even Ray Charles can see what is about to happen here.  Third point, the applied forces will break the weakest part in the chain, you pick one. Ok a sprag bearing, no dice. No brakes on one wheel and still locks axle turning the opposite direction.   The only option here is an open differential. Even an adjustable slipper style clutch will suck performance. A pulse width modulated clutch sounds cool, over my pay grade.  Lets dig a hole and bury this thing till the long haired one gets some real world testing on this. Fork is back in the eye, dammit!

As mentioned the mounting brackets are for mounting dual motors - although the mounting brackets can also be used for a single motor (dual-drive) setup, the brackets do not have a differential gear to allow the separate drive trains to work independently. Therefore a single-motor dual-drive setup can be dangerous and  likely to cause harm or injury. We do NOT recommend a single motor (dual drive) setup, therefore we will not be sending out to anyone for a real world testing with respect to a single motor  (dual drive).

@Hummie Carvon had a hybrid 4wd. Hub motors on one axel and single motor dual sprag bearings, (one way ratcheting) on the other.  This allowed the single to drive both wheels forward with no braking and unlocked turning.  Not a solution for a single drive unless you like to foot brake.

I don't know man. Both as an esk8 enthusiast and a Freerider/downhil rider myself, this whole thread is so revolting. From the badly edited stock picture (the pucks do light up if you have the special ones but you don't ignite the street on fire...) to the Idea of stabilizers for your trucks ? Like really ? Having a mecanical lock that differentiates with pressure and is even somewhat spring loaded sounds absolutely scary to me and also a danger to others. While on our rides back to the mountaintop (in the car) today we read trough the thread and your coments, basically everything you said about stability is so nonsensical. :"The down side of higher durometer bushings is that it limits smooth curving, cruising and smooth steering." Ehm you wut mate ? Really, is that your take on bushings and their functionality ? This here is my favourite we almost pissed our pants:" Any conventional trucks (including precision trucks) with the present tensioners to support the conventional bushings are significantly more solid. The constant pulling of the tension springs to reach equilibrium dissipates the tilting from side to side "wobbly" effect quickly. The tension springs compensate for the weakness of the bushings. The springs pulling enables the board to stay upright and **self-balance itself after the wheels encounter bumps in the road and/or after the rider completes a turn**." I mean I also style my arm hairs in a way that absorbs negative fibrations and radio frequency which allows me to stay more grounded and thus making me more stable after hitting a bumb in the road. Makes sense right ?! (sarcasm...) :no_mouth:

Did you know that speedwobbles aren't just an inconvenience ? Did you know that last year in the USA alone 14 poeple died on a longboard, with no other vehicles involved? Most of those horrors were caused by wobbles. And you now give poeple a wrong sense of security, based on nothing at all? I am pissed at you mate, let me explain why: 


1.) If you ever feel unstable on a deck after you went over a certain speed limit you were familiar with, know that that is a good thing. You just realised where your skillcap is at the moment and you were concious enough about the situation that you realised it. So now you have to go over your options to improve your freedom further while riding so that 50, 60 or mayby even 70 becomes a familiar speed. (meaning km/h). The first thing would be to check your set up, from the deck, to the wheelbase, to your trucks and bushings. Do you have most weight directly over the truck? Are you within the optimal weight limit of your bushings? If you are still having issues, its also helpfull to upgrade in the truck departement. I did take my stock cast caliber 2 184mm well over 60 before and it felt decent. But even the minimal upgrade to ronin cast was a new world. So much more controle and stability at higher speeds and most importantly in corners that I griped.

2.) Now fixing the issues of instability or even wobbels with a mecanical feature that locks up gradualy by saving the energy in a spring function is a terrible idea in itself. (Only based on my opinion, happy to concede that I could be wrong as anyone can be about anything). But basically you are trying to cover up missing knowledge, skill and practice with something else. If you are not comfortable riding at 60 and want those stabilizers to help you, sure you may try it. But if you cannot emergency brake at 60, when you cannot controle your line at 60, when you cannot control your fall at 60, or even slide, you should NOT even think about going 60. I personally wouldn't trust our current braking systems enough to even go 40 down a hill with an esk8, If I could not stop safely and quickly myself. ( I am using 60 as a the speed here because it will apear fast for most of you and help stress my point, even though all of this may very well aply for 40/50 for others).

3.) I will not go into how suffisticated trucks are on the higher end.( e.g: vortex, koa, ronin pro light etc.) and how much experience is behind it. But if you are generaly intrested read up on how important it is to have a lot of play and that having a super "fix" truck is actualy so much more unstable. Anyhow, the best way I can put it is like this. There are a few races in the world where only a few riders sign up, not because they don't want to. But because it is extremely scary and hardcore difficult. Those riders who thrown down on a mountain at well over 90km/h sometimes even dipping 110km/h, don't you think everyone would use anything that would help them out? That would ensure them more safety ? To prevent loss of life or injury? Also why has no player in the game that has produced multiple world champions never brought anything to market like this ? It was a thing before and it came up here and there over the years the last time 2011, but noone ever thought it was even remotely usefull or worth cheking out. 

4,) I am sorry that I blew up in this, but huge claims deserve huge criticism. ("Let's ride electric skateboard in a new way") / ("Stabilised skateboard truck | Anti Speed Wobble Tech"). But it sounds like a Faceboock post:" Anti cancer tech /  get your healing stickers today" I am not even going into the whole single motor dual wheel shabang, since more skilled poeple on the subject already chimed in. But please aknowledge that even though esk8 is a new venture on its own, that skating has been explored very far, and poeple are risking their skin daily to push limits further, so mayby instead of disregarding that mountain of accesable knowledge, digg into it, cooperate with it and come out stronger on the other end. I am deeply concerned about the safety of our community, I daily worry about inexperienced riders going over 40 regularely without proper protection. 40 is enough to kill a human, a fact I was remembered when we burried a friend a few weeks ago who died doing what we all love, riding. So stay safe, and remember that upgrading your ride is only have the work. Educate yourself as a rider along side it. 

TLDR: Safety of human life is not something you want to mess with"

Faith in the belief that facts and evidence are meaningless and just fancy tools that smart people use to try to talk the sheeple out of blindly throwing their money at the troll oil peddlers. A person on the internet says their product will work if you just have "faith"! What more do you need? Don't over think or even think, just buy it! Hell, buy two! Just in case you need to hold a tarp down or keep your car's hatchback closed when you take home that sweet, free bed frame you find at the bottom of your favorite downhill run. 

/sarcasm

P.s. @psychotiller it's good to see you back on your feet, er, skates! You healed fast! Looking goood!

This was a funny, and at times horrifying thread. This isn't the first time I've seen some ass hat pushing 🐍 oil in a skate forum. Thanks for posting, and trying to set people straight. It's been a while since my last case of speed wobbles, and I ended up riding it out. I'm a little afraid that someone with little skating time going to end up dead, because even seasoned ride can make mistakes .

For intances, somone posts "innovation" in regards to trucks and stability, then I would have the possibility to sort of Sign the post, by saying approved by XYZ or dissaproved by. 

Lately I see so much unfounded weird shit on here. Random claims, poeple "helping" in build threads who themselves never built anything with wrong information. Or poeple searching for riding tipps and gettingg horrible and dangerous suggestions.

Thougght about it like a quality controle of sorts, where we don't delet or flag a post, but would be able to Sign it with our seal of approval.

People don't understand that speed wobble isn't exclusive to skateboards. Motorbike, cars, bike etc, they all have speed wobbles, just under diff name :death wobble, tank slapper, speed shimmy. They all have one commonality, the unfixed axis or steering wheels, is always the part of the vehicle that violently shakes back and forth whereas the fixed axis/wheels is then being lead by the force of the steering wheels trying to counter it with stability. Our esk8 has 2 unfixed axis! Locking up one of the axis will only decrease the steer-ability of the skateboard but wont decrease wobbling significantly! Think about it this way, cars, bicycles and motorbike, they all have rear fixed axis but yet they still have the wobbles. Locking up the rear trunks is like imitating a rwd car.

"...When a speed wobble occurs, it doesn’t begin as a slight wobble and build to a larger and larger amplitude but rather begins at a point known as critical speed, or the point at which the board crosses the Hopf bifurcation value, and shakes violently back and forth at a more set amplitude..." This is fukin physics!

The best way to decrease speed wobbles is weight distribution and experience. I decrease speed when i reach a slight wobble. My body then learn to get used to that speed on this platform (or eboard in this case) and i learn to distribute weight and pressure from my legs efficiently. The next time I get up to the same speed I was able to increase my speed cap. Point is, there are dozen of other factors that can contribute to a speed wobble, road condition, wind condition, wheels condition etc. Don't just rely on a locking mechanism.

There are 5 key issues associated with the electric skateboard drivetrain:

1) small stones and tree twigs often get caught between the pulley teeth causing the belts to snap during high speed;
2) when belts are wet from rain they easily slip and are bulnerable to snapping. If belts snap during braking, the rider is unable to stop which is a safety issue;
3) fail to maintain your chain, and you run the risk of all kinds of mechanical mayhem. Electric skateboard chains are thinner than bike/bicycle chain. A chain can break .... and be fatal.
Other issues with belts:
4) belt-drives incur more power loss than chain-drives or direct-drive hub motors;
5) belt-drives cost more overtime. The life of the belts are comparatively shorter, and require frequent replacement due to wear, tear and snapping;

If you can avoid them, please do not get belt or chain drives as they can cause a life-threatening accident. 
In my view, they are simply not good enough when it comes to safety - please protect your life and money.

1) _small stones and tree twigs often get caught between the pulley teeth causing the belts to snap during high speed;_
**Nope, mostly just bounce off, even if get caught, it rides fine. I had to remove some stones but that's it.**
 
2) _when belts are wet from rain they easily slip and are bulnerable to snapping. If belts snap during braking, the rider is unable to stop which is a safety issue;_
**it's due to user error in wrong belt tension. never snapped because of wet. if anything u can spray belt conditioner for once and good for life. Thanks to teflon coating. And also, remember to use foot brake. when belt snaps off at high speed, the board just slows down, u still in control**.

_3) fail to maintain your chain, and you run the risk of all kinds of mechanical mayhem. Electric skateboard chains are thinner than bike/bicycle chain. A chain can break .... and be fatal._ **Same concept as belt, it breaks, don't panic, just foot brake.**

Other issues with belts:
_4) belt-drives incur more power loss than chain-drives or direct-drive hub motors;_ **Wrong! maybe inefficient, not loss in power. two different thing man.**

_5) belt-drives cost more overtime. The life of the belts are comparatively shorter, and require frequent replacement due to wear, tear and snapping;_ **Wrong Again! Correctly tension-ed belt can last a year. Actually, hubs will have to replace the thane when chipped.**

I don't know who got into ur head and said hub is the best, but it's still very early stage in development. 
Thane is the biggest issue for hubs, too thine or too thick. either way it cracks and chips out.

not only that, thane debond  from the motor, why do u think wheels have cores embedded into meats of the Thane.

What about vibration, motor shorting, hitting large crack. I bent truck hanger before so will motor survive? How about torque? it doesn't brake as well as belts. What about sizes? does it have 97mm?

I'm not here to say hub is suck. I actually want to buy nice hub. But These issues aren't addressed and not been resolved.

Where as belt, I can get 10 for $20 in aliexpress. 
How much is a quality Thane.

What about people want penumatics, mt board? can u call those garbage cuz use belt?
They use like 120amp per motor, still goes strong over puddle.
