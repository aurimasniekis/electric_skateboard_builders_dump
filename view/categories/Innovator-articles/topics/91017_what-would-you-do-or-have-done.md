We are quickly approaching mid 2019 now and I was just thinking about how much everything has changed since I first started ghosting around on this forum. With all these new innovations around I thought It would be cool to redo a topic that has been created before just to see what everyone has to say now. 

 My question for everyone is....

**What is the one thing that you want to change or did change on your build that felt like it was life changing?**

For me its actually so simple but it has made a massive improvement. [Trinity Wedge Risers](https://www.trinitydistribution.com.au/hardware/misc.-hardware/Trinity-Risers-Wedge). They are 10 AUD and run a 5 degree wedge that is soft enough to cushion out bumps without affecting ride. They also create a 10 degree split between my trucks giving a more stable ride at high speeds.

Switching from springs to elastomer damper and riding with heelstraps instead of bindings only.

I owned a Bajaboard for years before I tried an eSk8 with thane - this changed everything for me I felt pretty dumb not trying it sooner!   (I've skated since the 80s)

Precision trucks & good urethane bits. 

Split angles was such a good change as well. I don't think I can go back to 45/45 on a high speed board again.

Freeboard S2 half strap bindings. I put them on everything, even my breakfast eggs.  

I also should have quit double kingpin tkp trucks long ago.

Switching over to precision trucks!! Oh lawdy it's night and day when cruising 30+mph. Also, ditching the dkp evolve crap trucks has been a great improvement for my lavaboard

I bought the evolve gt as my first board just to try those 7inch tires, got underwhelmed with power and range, sold all but trucks and built a 10s4p platform to power the drivetrain with 200kv 6365s. The power increase was real and the unstable nature of the dkps became very real.. I cannot recommend them to anybody

Learning how to build battery packs (the first thing I did) set the table for everything.

Oh and Cronins. O.M.G... I fantasize now about modeling a ronin hanger with caliber profile and getting a few made, so I can mount gear drives, etc. Maybe even for DD motors. Wouldn't mind ponying up for ronin precision baseplates.

It's like a virus infecting my brain. Maybe I can infect @rey8801 and @LukePL too. :slight_smile:

The easiest way is to slightly modify the hanger and use rey's mad hubs.

The hanger profile is curvy, and recent versions are very narrow, so custom cnc hangers might be the next most reasonable way.

Adding @moon to the list to infect. ;)

marcmt88 has clamps, but they don't work without a fight. Ollin has mounts.

The other way is I think to file flatspots, and/or braze or tig weld to add some material to square things up. But this is almost futile unless you've stockpiled the old hangers.

I like tkp on slow turny setups. Apprehensive about going fast on them.

CNC Ronin's are a thing. I think ollin modifies the hanger too

I stopped using an on-board bms :hushed:, batteries I use on my boards are big so the cells rarely fall out of balance. If they do need attention I bring them back into balance manually. I also started running a seperate battery for my reciever to take the load off my motor controller.

@dareno you must be talking about those long-lasting, cold-tolerating, LiFePO4 cells then.  12S of those is 43.8V

I would have made 2 types of builds -- a shortboard and a longboard -- and made 3 clones of each of them, reusing as many of the same pieces as possible.

That way, when anything breaks I swap the piece out and go.  My "spare parts on-hand" for keeping the fleet running would be a tenth of what they are now.

It'd be the difference between a car repair shop that only works on a fleet of 10 same-year Ford Mustangs, or a shop that works on 10 cars, all different makes and models.
