Hello fellow Eskaters,

Im building my first electric skateboard and I love to try new things and make inventions.
I was thinking about what would be a cool feature to have on an electric skateboard. 
But couldn't go further than a smoke module that can create a cloud of smoke under your board or a bluetooth speaker.

Do you have any sugestions? It can be a simple pcb with a new function or a whole new application. I am just seeking new insparation to make something!

Microwave. I get hungry sometimes on my esk8, and would be cool to bring some frozen tamales, and microwave them mid-ride!

why don't u just finish a build first then add ancillary bits to it after. building a board is challenge enough, why complicate your first with unnecessary, albeit cool, items? perfecting a build, if there is such a thing, is difficult enough.

I want a device that's less than 2 cubic centimeters in size that is full of explosives and connects to the charging jack or BMS.  I want to have to plug a "key" into the charging jack (that transmits a code to the device) at least every week or two.  Failure to plug the correct key in within 2 weeks means the device will explode, tearing apart the esk8.  Think of this as a theft-deterrent device.

And I don't want to have to use any certain BMS by any certain manufacturer or any certain battery voltage beyond a broad range, like "3S to 16S"

This needs to be a stand-alone device with a stand-alone key

A controller that downhill riders are able to use with their fingers and or wrist and still have two free palms for sliding on pucks.

A beer holder

a standard of parts and interfaces allowing the competing companies to all share in a new market and create a new hype and industry around a new product with interchangeable parts, options style selections and everything that say, a skateboarder, would enjoy when entering a skateboard shop and picking one out...it should be assembled as quickly as any skateboard right there in front of the customer and.or guardian and the customer should enjoy the freedom and luxury of picking out all the component and parts themselves, just like they have done with skateboards since the beginning of skateboard time...but no, we need to have chinese completes falling out of the sky ruining everything..

Hah luckily no. It was slowly cracking over time and I had patch worked it together again a few times but ended up modifying the design so I can swap my batteries out and I just charge them off the board:

Regarding the controller ideas I've thought about using a string driven type thing where you pull a string somewhere on your arm/hand to control acceleration my worry is what if you twitch or fall?

About interchangeable parts, that would be nice but also think it's harder in the case of esk8 since things are best when purpose built (don't want an extra big enclosure if you have a smaller battery, if you want a long flexy deck need split enclosures).  That said trying to work towards some standards on things is always good for reasons you already stated.

Would love to see someone make 'retractable' mountainboard wheels.. though that would require mechanical knowledge and know how to make such 'system' sturdy enough for riding.

Have seen it for amphibia cars:

This would save some space for when there is a need to carry / park mountainboard.. 

--

Other than that, from electronics side:

  **Turn signals** - would be cool, (someone made brake light, as far as i know)

 Been thinking about **'charging platform'** for awhile but havent made on myself (similar concept like electric kettle is working, when u just place it on a 'pod')

I agree that a lot of cool stuff can be made with lights.. be it el wire, light channels.. opportunities are quite wide there

On the lights ideas I was just looking at some GPS modules or lots of old android phones on ebay... think it'd be cool if the board had indicators to tell me when I need to turn somewhere so I don't have to take my phone out.  I suppose it could just use bluetooth or something from the phone and use a phone app to tell it what to do and handle the gps/routing.

Batteries should come enclosed and with mounts for electric skateboards. You said it, things are best when made for the purpose...right?

Motors are pretty standard already, 50 and 65...

Mounts are becoming standard, the little hole is different on each truck clamp..

The trucks are not really made for electric skating yet, but we can hope and try to change that fact.

Seems there's only a very few mating locations (genitals) between electric and unpowered skateboards, it appears we only have a few items to form a factor around...yes?

Yeah I guess the issue then though is what to consider a form factor or a variation.  For example for the speed controller/receiver/telemetry it depends on which of those components you have how big they will be, but we could come up with some numbers that get say 90% of use cases (would probably need to include VESC 4 and VESC 6 options as well as single vs dual sizes).  From those dimensions and commonly used board types/sizes could come up with a hole pattern that could be shared.

On the battery could maybe do the same type of thing but think it's harder since there's even more variation there (18650 vs lipo and all the possible ways to arrange both).  I mean you could come up with "standards" for a bunch of variations, but then they aren't as useful as a "standard" since everyone can use a different one.  That's the other side too, even if we establish here we would like some standard we also then need to convince the manufacturers to adopt those standards for reasons that are somehow beneficial to them.

Yes correct, standards are not just decisions, they are consensus, so the companies that understand the need for such a standard in this new industry are here and some are even reading. I work with a few already and I make it a point to highlight skateboard companies in the USA near or at the heart of the history of skateboarding. 

All the companies owned and operated by skateboarders themselves, be it downhill, freeride, freestyle park, vert, whatever, you name it and there's already companies making it. What we need to do is catch their attention, show them there's a new demographic, a new product and it needs a standard...

They will listen and make what we wish if we show we will buy it, it's simple...we actually get to create the standard if we play our cards right..How about Liquid, Caliber, Paris, Indy and whatever else all making a 200mm truck made for electric skateboarding and all can fit the same motor? Imagine a selection of wheels, not just like two models or three sizes to choose from but a whole wall of choices that all fit on the same pullies? in all sorts of shapes and sizes and color! 

Decks, come on, we got decks coming out of our ears already in this world, great ones, let's highlight them, ask them to be involved and drill a few more holes, how hard is this really? Not very hard with a little cooperation and spirit!  competition breeds innovation but right now the market is sort of dead, we need hype, the companies need hype and growth, growth comes from new standards..

I am more than willing to bet that the companies wanting to be involved in that standard, and apart of that sea of parts on the wall the customer has to choose from, will understand all of this and hear me..

Flamethrower in the back.  I want to lay a trail of burning kerosene "Back to the future" style.  @longhairedboy would probably be all over making this a standard feature on his boards.  This is definitely a "shut up and take my money" feature if I've ever heard of one.  Mashing the throttle and laying down a burning trail would be epic.

Your know what I saw someone do that on YouTube with a Butane can, didn't work very well but it also wasn't an EBoard. Could be pretty cool using a Butane canister and proper metal tubing controlled by a solenoid, I plan on doing something like this to add an Afterburner to my model D.H. Vampire EDF jet.

There's nothing we can do to a skateboard to solve the turn signals problem, because drivers don't even see us AT ALL, much less see the little light ... much less then focus closely on it to realise it's a blinking arrow.... they'll just go around us then turn right in front of us, cutting us off and wrecking us and almost running us over, then being completely oblivious what is happening in the world outside their incoming text messages...

 You can bring your z axis fully down and then move your y axis fully from start to end.  That worked for me once.  It removed the print with glass bed included and "stored" them on the floor.  Never did it again though

I was actually thinking of something like a double sided heatbed that would rotate, dislodge the print and put fresh bed in place. This would allow the 2nd  print to start on a new bed without chance of any contamination or misalignment of the first bed and give you time to check before the next cycle

It wouldn't hang, it would get knocked off and down a chute, you need the width of the baseplate to rotate and if the beds are equally spaced from the center it'll be aligned. Regardless alignment isn't the problem I want solved 😋

Two ways I've seen something like this done... 1 the 360 3d printer robot arm type thing something like this but I've seen less cheesy more 3d printer specific ones just can't find right now:

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1849283018/makerarm-the-first-robotic-arm-that-makes-anything

Then other option was having a conveyer belt that things print on then it rolls them off the edge.  Would guess issue there is trying to keep it "taught" or flat for printing.

---

Think mostly people just deal with it though or get a print bed with big enough volume to print multiples in one go.

---

You could also 3d print one thing then make a mold with silicone (somewhat time consuming) but then can pour fast curing plastic resin stuff that cures in 10-20min if you're just repeating some part for mid-scale stuff.

hey dude, the BMS question is actually solved. The BMS is ultra smart (may be too smart for a general non power user), but costs a lot as well. 140 -160 euro depending on the current capability.

I think it would be amazing if someone was able to produce an electric skateboard that could easily convert to a motorized SUP board. The hubs of the wheels could act as propellers by either rotating the truck or axles 90deg or attaching some sort of fins onto the hubs. Something like this wrapped in PU or pneumatics/airless...https://youtu.be/Us8qirIV4mw  Even if it didn't go fast in the water, it would be a blast. I have had this idea on my mind but I don't have the tools nor the CAD  capabilities to make this happen. I imagine having two separate foam or inflatable attachments for each end of the deck to make the board float, but integrating the propellers into the drivetrain/wheel hubs. Some of these new jet boards are awesome. It seems like a huge engineering challenge but with the innovation I have seen on this forum it doesn't seem impossible. If anyone wants to team up on this idea shoot me a PM. AMPHIB-ESK8

I would like to see a working dead man switch that causes the board to do a full brake when no one stands on the board. 

Would be suitable for emergency situations whe you are forced to jump off your deck as well as sort of a handbrake while waiting at a stop or having a chat...

Have seen some sketches of such thing but never a finished solution.

Might work with a strain gauge and some logic board...

Hmm true. 
Would need a timeout and the option to switch it off completely.

Now this is an idea. This is doable with a foot switch. I'm not sure about how the programming in the vesc would go but if the vesc is capable, that's all it would take.

I saw some futuristic board on kickstarter a cpl of years back. it had "artificial intelligence"..
One of the features was that "it could tell if a person was on the board", also had a charging dock for the remote where it flew around in some magnetic field, levatating while charging. Personally it just smelled like alot of bullshit. Berly anything bout the actuall performance of the board, just alot of 5th element engineering.

Why not just do it like jet skis, snowmobiles and quads do and have a ankle strap tide to some kind of kill switch.
Same way you would wear a leash for snowboarding or surfing

I am not talking about some bs shishi but a real savety feature to bring your board to a full stop when you can't. Minimzing the chance of it seriously damaging something/someone when turned into a fairly heavy projectile...

Yeah that would be an rather unsexy but proven alternative..

The plug just must not vibrate itself loose in any case. Worst case would be that the plug would not come loose at all keeping the board attached to you as  ⚓ 😀

A plug with a solid casing that's made to "brake" under stress would keep it from just coming undone. The benefit in being a less technical safety feature is if for some reason you have technical failure that makes you start uncontrollably accelerating you could pull it and ride it out.

an anti-crash system like Tesla's autopilot..



OOH! advanced cruiser, something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvWCJbYtq7Q) which locks on to an object in front and mirrors their speeds (and maintains distance)

You could make modes that are controlled with the remote (eg; cruising or high power). orrr you could theoretically put the big capacity one at a constant rate of discharge or a smooth curve for more battery life while having the other pack fill in the rest of the necessary power

I was thinking of Theft since i live in a city full of it. Now realistically speaking the most common way they would steal your eboard is grab n go or just taking it from an unprotected location. or maybe armed robbery.. or getting jumped

I was thinking of putting a gps tracker and found some like these;
[GPS Tracker 1](https://www.amazon.com/Spy-Tec-Portable-Personal-Vehicle/dp/B00JG8KCLO/ref=pd_sim_107_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00JG8KCLO&pd_rd_r=b3d38f5a-d98e-11e8-812b-6f7e56fb9f31&pd_rd_w=Gs11q&pd_rd_wg=ii5v2&pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=18bb0b78-4200-49b9-ac91-f141d61a1780&pf_rd_r=AZZV3PQSST3DRZENFZ79&pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_t=40701&psc=1&refRID=AZZV3PQSST3DRZENFZ79)
[GPS Tracker 2 (seems to be better imo)](https://www.amazon.com/VIFLYKOO-BSJ-A5E-3-Tracking-Waterproof-Anti-Theft/dp/B07DDCVB5Q?keywords=small+gps+tracker+sim&qid=1540606830&s=GPS+%26+Navigation&sr=1-16&ref=sr_1_16)

Another thing is that they probably cant use the board without a controller, so always keep your controller with you.

Now since the thief won't have the ability to use it and/or sell it, he will try to part it out, and that's where I would use complex screws instead of normal ones, and protect the rest by making it not your openable with average tools (for example a lot of people own the T tool, so instead take that out and put something proprietary or something unique that no one can find easily), and after the thief find he cant open it, odds are he will just leave it/dump it

We sort of have what @sebike was asking for in the form of capacitors (guess super capacitors now are the new hype but just high capacity capacitors, good at discharging quickly and can infinitely recharge from what I can tell).  That said also what you mentioned on adjustable modes the metr.at module and app allow you to easily switch between slow, normal, and fast modes changing the battery and motor max current settings via the bluetooth connection (just swipe on the mode you want to change to on a phone and good to go).

Regarding theft I just put a hole in my board and use a regular bike lock to lock it up to bike racks, someone who was smart enough could unbuckle the batteries and disconnect them from the board and take them but it's like an $80 loss at worst for me and so far no thieves smart enough to do that and dumb enough to not just get a job.

I have bigger plans for mine. Using the Bajaboard "dyno" as inspiration.

I have a invention idea I'm trying to find out the best way to do it. That is adaptive bushings. So on low speed you have them loose (soft) and on higher speed its stiff and hard.

inflation bag, a tiny one, instead of a bushing.  put the kingpin on a motor so you can push button tighten or loosen the hanger.  

that being said, a good setup with good trucks is already there.

I like the idea of a slow brake if a sensor is triggered for weight of rider leaving, somewhere around the front bushing and not a pedal or something that needs to be intentionality activated

no way man, I "unweight" my board a lot while riding to get over things and I don't want any feature like that giving false info and throwing me when I use the kicktail...

If the sensor is between the bushings then you can reposition all you like, imagine tip toeing on your bathroom scales you still have the same weight

When I said "unweight" what I meant was, quite literally, unweighting the entire board while riding at speed to get over large obstacles like railroad tracks...I do it all the time...This is a common technique used in almost all forms of skateboarding for some reason or another...don't imagine what I meant, listen to what I said..

Hey I just saw this, what are the odds.

I'm currently making a dyno, but pretty small. I'm not using inertia as a simulated load, I'm using skateboard wheels hooked up to some fat 63mm motors. That way I can apply brake and get telemetry out of it, read out actual efficiencies, etc.

Once it's done I'd totally bring it to events in California if people want to stress test their board and get some metrics that can be used to compare.
