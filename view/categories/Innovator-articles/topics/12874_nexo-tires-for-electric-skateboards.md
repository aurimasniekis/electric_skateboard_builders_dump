Is something similiar possible for eboards and could this type of tire fill the gap between longboard-wheels and pneumatic wheels?

seems like a good idea for Trampa offroad boards. because they DO go flat.

on skate wheels you donÂ´t need that "technology" because you control the hardness/softness with different durometers. 
(no holes needed for that)
