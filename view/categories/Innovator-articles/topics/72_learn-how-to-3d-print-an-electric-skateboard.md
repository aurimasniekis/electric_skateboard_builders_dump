The livestream workshop session, which will incorporate the use of 3D printed parts to build an open API electric skateboard, is being held to help viewers gain a better understanding of the process behind building your own electric longboard using the Faraday platform.

Better later than never :) But yeah things are starting to move quite fast with us. We are planning to develop some cool stuff and we want to share our learnings.

**EDIT:** We did not even know our live stream announcement was posted here. If anybody stumbles upon this and wants to see what happened we have a recording available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1I6DlRB1_w)

Yes, I agree! :slight_smile:

 I'm not judging ... I'm just amazed you found a post from a year ago. I can't seem to find a post 2 days ago! :joy:
