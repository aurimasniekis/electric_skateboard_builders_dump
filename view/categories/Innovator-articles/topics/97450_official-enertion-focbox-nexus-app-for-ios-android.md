We all know it's been a long time coming...

![App%20Store%20Banner|499x500](upload://jiHA0T8LP8XPNY7bBgVqQrMtJGY.png) 

***Introducing Focbox Nexus***

The only app you will ever need for all your Enertion Focbox related needs.

Features include:

* Connect directly to the Focbox Unity, no additional hardware required
* Connect to any accessories (Enertion or otherwise) conforming to the new Unified CANbus Protocol (UCP) using only the single Bluetooth module in your Focbox Unity
* Read stats and configure settings of any connected accessories over UCP
* Full Focbox Unity stats and configuration support
* Wirelessly update connected accessory firmware
* Track your rides with time and location logged stats
* Share your rides and stats with a single link (coming after release)
* 100% platform native implementation for iOS & Android
* Apple Watch compatibility starting at watchOS 3
* Mac compatibility starting with macOS Catalina in the fall (https://developer.apple.com/ipad-apps-for-mac/)
* Fast, beautiful, and responsive UI

Absolutely not final UI, but here's a preview to give you an idea of the direction it's going

https://youtu.be/_GCV5_yQOPA

**What will the app work with?**

We've designed a new Unified CANbus Protocol that fully supports reading and configuring accessories connected via CANbus. As long as a piece of hardware connects via the CANbus header and conforms to the UCP, it will be configurable via the Focbox Nexus app. Specs and implementation details on UCP will come soon!

**When will it be available?**

iOS public testing has started! Because we want to build an app the community wants, we are releasing an alpha so you can get your hands on it and start giving feedback ASAP. **By signing up for the alpha, you are acknowledging that you understand this is pre-release software and things may go wrong**. Please sign up to test here: https://testflight.apple.com/join/f8tjt7Is (click this on your iOS device)

Android public testing will begin by the end of the summer. Check back here soon...

**How much will it cost?**

$Free.99

Could you tell a bit more on UCP and what do you mean by "accessories" ?
```

---
## \#18 Posted by: sofu Posted at: 2019-06-30T06:25:21.250Z Reads: 251

```
Sure, so UCP stands for Universal Canbus Protocol. It‚Äôs an updated protocol we‚Äôre developing that would allow anything communicating over canbus (vescs, remotes, bms, lights controller, etc) to identify itself and serve stuff like settings and statistics to the app so you can view and edit it all in one place. If you look in the preview video, you can see sample accessories connected below the main stats. Ideally you will be able to configure them directly from the app with no extra setup required.

The icons there are dynamic. If you connect something via canbus and it supports UCP, it will show up there. If your smart BMS supports UCP it will also show up there ;)

That's an interesting suggestion. I didn't envision turn by turn as a feature of the app because it's a lot of dev time and nuance for something probably not used very often, but maybe if there is more demand I can add some sort of routing button that opens gmaps or amaps sort of like how uber does it.

As a heads up, I'm aware there is currently a buffer overflow problem where the app will stop reading data until you relaunch it. I'm figuring it out :slight_smile:

Ideally I wanna base the calculation off of what the vesc returns for cutoffs, but right now it's just based on 12s values stuck in there for testing. For next release I'll change it.

Got a very quick test of this in last night, happy to report it was uber smooth, telemetry was extremely accurate though stuck in miles/hr, gps was quick and efficient. Also connection was strong, which is a huge deal for me as third party apps were constantly losing connection, and those were costing money. Super well done! Keen for the rest, especially Apple watch support since I stopped using a display supported remote.

At this point I think it's actually something in how the app handles data received... but that could change as I look into the issue. It may also be an issue of the Unity mcu being overtaxed by the amount of polls the app does of the Unity.

Ok thanks! Here we received the New Lime Scooters and I tried one out. Basically same as electric skateboard. I heard some cities are frowning and are making electric skateboards illegal in some parts of the world. Since you‚Äôre in the process with this app maybe an option on the app can be role/kick assist. So if you turn the feature on? All you need is to role couple km hr then it engages power to the remote to run the Unity. At least it can be used in an argument if getting a ticket. Here as long bikes are pedal assist and scooters there ok to ride. Also a speed governor can be selected. It‚Äôs just an option and proof since you app will have ride history. Kick assist only when at an initial stop and ready to power the board.

ditto! @FredXanadu  its pitiful it has to be this way. basically a scam for those of us who use iOS. We were supposed to be able to do vesc config through our phones but at least just to be able to check our voltages... WTH is going on over at enertion??

It seems Enertion has abandoned their customers. 
I think our only hope is getting bright developers in the community that can pick up their pieces. So unfortunate for all that purchased this stupid orange box.
