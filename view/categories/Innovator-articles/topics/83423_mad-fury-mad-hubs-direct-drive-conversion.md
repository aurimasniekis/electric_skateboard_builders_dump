Hi! Finnaly I finish my first DD coversion. I used the MAD hubs. That has been the idea behind since the beginning of the group buy... Now only time will tell if they are gonna last. I designed to be reversable so in case I can come back to the original configuration.

Mad Fury 75Kv

The origin and designing

Simpler, but should be really strong :grin: if I can make it and pair it with the BullyDeck (integrated enclosure) I am making too then it would be suck a sick build... Looking forward.

Funny story the only thing I am missing are the speed rings :joy: I ordered 1 month ago but still didn't get it... I could make it on the lathe but too much work for a washer.

well metasurf has a 8mm axle longer an for all the truck length. I cut the 8mm part to like 5 cm (see picture) and then made an axle extention screwed on it to reach 12mm for all the truck except 15mm where the motor can is in contact with the axle. So basically is a 12mm axle along the all length. I wanted to be a conversion kit, that way this solution. Otherwise I would drill the motor and make it all the way 12mm. Plus the motor support it self since was design as hub motor. SO I basically use is structure and brought it closer to the center. Of course, only real test will tell us.

Went for a short ride to cut my hair... Little spam never reached there :sweat_smile:

Riding feeling way better with 4 full wheels and 97mm. The motors ride super smooth. But thst I already know since I have tried the MAD hubs as hub motors before. Set in FOC sensored. Really silent. The power is there. Initial torque less then the Meepo style hub motor since they are 90mm and 65Kv but still great torque. Compare to the 130Kv is like almost double. Speed in insane. Reached 45kmh but like immidiately, and you feel thst there is a lot left. In bench it reaches 60kmh. So I guess 54-56kmh possible.

All nice but then all of the sudden the board stopped and throwed me off. Fxxk! Smelled burn pcb :disappointed_relieved:
Mall grubed back to home (3 km) and found this

Not sure whether is the antispark switch that didn't like the 12s and then killed 1 VESC or is the VESC itself. I hope it's only one. Need to test it. I found 2 little stones inside the enclosure. Since I opened again after sealed probably I didn't sealed right the last time. Can also be that the 2 stones caused the shorts and bye bye. Of course I just sold my spare vesc 6.6 last Wednesday... All right! I guess tests are postponed. :sob:

These Parts are ceramic capacitors (google "MLCC"). They smooth out the battery voltage for the VESC. One probably had in internal short from the vibrations and catched on fire.

In the automotive industry they use a special type of ceramic capacitor which fails in an open circuit rather than in an short circuit and therefore does not catch fire.

I immediately thought to your situation. Also the antispark is gone, while the other vesc seems to work just fine. Not sure if buy another 6.6 or move to like unity. I sold my spare 6.6 last week otherwise no doubt to try it again.

I don't think it's a problem with using an anti spark switch. It probably just died because of the huge current that was flowing thru it due to the short in the VESC.

MLCCs tend to fail like that when the PCB they are mounted on are flexing/bending to much.

yeh I think I will switch to another type of vesc. I need to trust anyway. Otherwise I do not ride confident. Good that the other vesc looks fine, tested now and everything works. So probably the issue was the other vesc and not the antisparks.

## \#44 Posted by: mishrasubhransu Posted at: 2019-02-09T18:35:06.112Z Reads: 268

```
I was wondering what the position of antispark was relative to the VESC. Was it placed on top of the VESC?

Also if the antispark blew first, then there is no way for the current to go back to the battery. If you were braking then, there would be voltage spikes in the vesc, blowing it up. 

On way to get confidence is built a bench test. With your skills and setup, you can easily build one. They do those thorough air crash investigation is because they can't just change everything for peace of mind. It is important to be able to pinpoint.

The antispark was on top.
Never thought about a bench test setup. I was going to buy a 30V 10A bench power supplier to test out vesc and motors but I would need a really pwerfull one to put them under stress.

Well, there's your answer. The temperature produced by it surely can destroy nearby components and placed on top is a sure way of doing it.

no chance of a short in the motor causing boom? we don't want to kill a Unity, although I've read they are resilient to motor shorts somehow.

Well the motors are new. Motor detection and hall sensors works fine. To check whether there is fault or not I should see if the motor wires are isolated between each other right? I don't want to kill a unity as well... Although the what broke in the Flipsky 6.6 were the ceramic capacitors and the antispark switch too. I don't know which one first. Do you think a motor short can cause that?

Edit:
That what I meant. I will try this test. But my motors spin without any drag.

I will check for shorts but the only ones you can detect with a multimeter are between motor wires and motor shaft/can. Then you can check connections between phase wires. You can not detect shorts inside the windings. The motors are new and I prepared a lot of them for the GB and they spin as the others, but you never know. It seemed really weird to me too that only after 3km one vesc blew up since I used same vescs and battery with the previous motors for 1 month at least. I thought could be because of the antisparks and the facts that these motors ask more current compare the previous one.

Inductance will vary by how many turns of wire around the teeth.  If it’s shorted the number will be less. I forget the number it shows when I check all the phases but it’s like 600 mili henries maybe or whatever denomination. U can see if shorted to the stator too. Which although not ideal will still be ok. 

It’s a cool tool for 15$

Like hummie says, inductance should be roughly the same between each phase. loop of wire = inductance, Many loops of wire = more inductance.
i.e if it is cut of somwhere along the way, less inductance will be shown.

Using it today ive come across a question maybe @linsus you have an answer or I know there’s other electronics people here too

I get the same inductance on each of the 3 phases within maybe 5 mili henrys for all the motors, you can see 285, and you can see measuring to just the wye, which is halfway, and it’s always less by 20. Why consistently is it less measuring halfway?![image|375x500](upload://8S21ti5JGnUOlU0CXcWnWXEDKz4.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://1qo1cwjVIT7mVa6R0dIkZtSRU1d.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://l6CAhWs6tpRqY5KLZHuPNkU3ySO.jpeg)

Your question is why you have half the value in a Star connection when meassuring between middle point and a phase? Well. Theres less turns half way thru. 

![Y|213x180](upload://nN7mUTFk2NIyvCjFhRNFwrrqihT.png) 

Between phases theres always gonna be roughly the same given a symmetrical motor. Between any given phase and middle you'd have rougly half. With some offset. Simply cause when meassuring the device uses current. And the current will only flow thru the coil between your probes. i.e probing 1 and middle will only meassure inductance of the blue coil, while point 1 to 2 will meassure the inductance thru red and blue coil. Not sure what the accuracy for your LC meter is but seems about right.

Can recommend this one, have it at my desk at work. 7$ and it does a load of things, dont have to select any mode, it just detects w/e you put in there. It even tells if you're putting in a MOSFET or a Bipolar Transistor. Which is quite facinating for the small number of components.

This morning back to the road. I needed to use it to go to work. I took it really easy since I don't want to fall again in case of something brakes, plus need to set the truck ecc... Anyhow I have to say that with the unity I feel more power compare to before and more gradual control. The acceleration is better and the unity temp stained so low compare to other VESC i have tried. These MAD hubs are really nice and at 12s they go really fast. Unfortunately the @Ackmaniac app has some compatibility problem with the unity. It does work but it stops recording during the commute and 50% of the time doesn't receive the data at first try. Here the screen from the ride this morning.

![vescmonitor|281x500](upload://w2jKhOOTsqzmTQ9lPUZfV4l4Tx3.png) 

I can tell you that I maybe reached 45kmh but there is more room (65kmh was a free spin), around 53-55kmh should be no problem with my battery, a 4-5p will do better. To finish faster I printed the motor can cover in ABS (just for eastetics). Still holding fine but not sure how long it will last. Well I have the metal to make it, but I am working on another DD at the moment Which will be a bit overkill I think but why not? :laughing:

yeh to me it pushes more during the acceleration than at the top when it's more a smooth increase, but I didn't feel any steps or whatsoever. I had used the flipsky 6.6 before, not too much with these motor though (or at least for really short time), and rode them in FOC as well. Both of the vesc give a really nice feeling, compare to my old Maytech 4.12 you feel the difference.

Update after one week of riding. I still have to get use to these hubs at 12s. They ride super smooth but the power is too much for my short board. At least for me :grin: Switched back to 90mm...despite the lower clearance I needed to feel more stable, now it rides like a super car. The torque improved a lot and I can not believe how strong they are. I never tried a raptor hubs but man these MAD hubs push a lot. Still didn't find the gut to push them to the limit. Went over 45 kmh for sure but you get there so fast that I am not sure how fast you can actually go at the end. I can not log any telemetry data since ackmaniac's app is not working properly with the unity. I will use some running app to at least show something. Ah the unity BTW gives way better brakes then the other vesc I have tried (same setting). 
What is surprising me is the efficiency. The 130Kv were usigg a lot of current while the 75Kv for the moment the consumption is really good.
Did I already told you how strong they are? Ahahaha

Well not sure if I want to make them available because you will need the hubs which are quite expensive and then the cnc work. I think the lower I can provide them is around 450 euro and 250 the kit only. For sure they are worth it since to me are really nice hubs. 
Plus I like the idea of a conversion kit but maybe is better to just drill the motor and go for a 12mm axle all the way. Simpler and stronger for sure. In that case to come back you will need just a small cylinder adapter, but why come back when you can have the as DD? Probably my design is enough storing but I weight 85kg. Do not know if someone of over 100kg decide to jump on it :rofl:

Ya I'd say it's the best bigger wheel option out there as of now .. I don't like abecs myself .. ollin wheels is very similar to kegel I think the blue ones are grippier and I find I don't get the high speed bouncy ball affect.. ollin wheels are by far better then abecs so if you can't run a 85 kegel or Seismic and stuck to a 90mm get his wheel by far superior for that size and then there is haggy has a 78a 90m kegel basically too they all have the same shape.. but I can't tell you if haggy are the same or not ..

With this DD 90mm is really the limit. The clearance is already low. 97mm would be better by I don't feel right for my set up. Too high from the ground for my fast turn style :laughing:
The Popoca 90mm are perfect but stuoid me I made the adapter for Abec since planning on using 97mm and didn't find any 97mm kegel. For the next DD I am making is way lower profile so I will rather use 90mm popoca or 85mm caguama blue. I am always towards torque and low ride so probably 85mm

Yeh probelm that I am now using unity and the only app compatible is metr, but I don't have metr module. Ackmaniac is great but not compatible with unity yet. It does pair 1 out 5, but the connection is not stable, always stops recording ecc... Anyhow the difference is immense. I don't know why since I think they are the same motors, one in wye and the other in delta. Probably one is more efficient, but with the 75Kv I hlget same range than the Meepo hubs so like 13-14watt/km while riding pretty fast and lower to 11 with more cruising style.

What @pat.speed said is correct they need more amp for the same torque so the efficiency is toward high rpm. Although it's true that is not linear I get 30km out of the 75Kv and barelly 10-12km with the 130Kv. Same setting. You can think to switch the termination. It's rather easy. The tricky part is to disassemble the rear bearings from the stator.

Like @rey8801 said converting hubs to dd is very simple. Since both sides of the motor already have bearings. All that is needed is an extended axle and a core adaptor that can bolt straight onto the existing plate that covered one side of the motor.

The other great thing is they are nice and compact meaning that can probably be squeezed onto some 180/195mm trucks

Thanks @pat.speed I have some don't trip slalocybins that I'm not using any more as I got the new dh-cybins down hill slalom truck and won't use the slalom again so I was thinking my two separate single Acton hubs mounted to these 90 mm hanger I might go see a machine shop and get them shaved a bit more and beefed up the Axel's as I'll need custom ones..I'm not a heavy weight at all at 140 to 150 pounds..been tempted to buy a metasurf motor also

Those don’t look very wide, you will need at least 55mm of room between the inside of the wheel and the bit of the hanger that starts to curve off to attach to the bad plate. 180mm might fit depending on the truck and 195-205 should also fit. I could be wrong tho as I’ve only done a little bit of measuring. You probably won’t have to beef up the axle as long as most of the aluminium hanger stays there. You should aim for 16mm hanger but I guess it depends on the size of the hub motor and bearings

Converting hubs to DD is for sure not too much complicate but not to discourage anyone do not thing is a one night shoot. You need to right fit everything in order to have a reliable finish product and the parts you need will cost you some if you don't have the machine and the skills needed to manufacture by yourself. I mean you can also ask to a company but you need to give them precise measurements otherwise every try will cost you as a new motor.

Time wise a lot. I had to take all the measurements to make the model and 6 rounds of prototype to make it fit right. Then I bought a small CNC and a lathe. Of course also for other things I do but otherwise not possible to make it without. Then the metal itself both aluminium and steel. The trucks, the motors ecc...so only parts I would say 300 euro. Plus the machines and time, a lot of time. I tried to ask a company. Only for making a prototype of only the few metal parts, still have to buy motors and mill the trucks, threads ecc...was 360$ plus shipping, and you are not sure it will be correct at the first try. I then asked them what if I order more, then the price became competitive. For instance 20 sets of this kit would be more affordable but still it is not cheap.

I mean if you go to mass production than the price is really cheap but you need to put quite some money in advance. Now I am making a DD from scratch, from an out runner motor. I have to make more parts but i can design how I want. To me it's simpler like that because from existing motors you really need the parts to fit perfectly.

yeh difficult to check it but I can tell you that even with 90mm wheels that it's really few mm from the ground you have to go over cracks to touch the 3D printed can. So I do not think it bends too much. Yesterday I check the truck without the wheels and the adapters are still there in place. nothing moved. So far so good and I am using everyday. I also not super heavy, like 80kg plus gears and back pack probably 90 (all the gym stuffs, food ecc, look like that I am leaving for camping every morning).
Anyhow I think that the easiest way it's just drill the motors and make all the way 12mm. I might redo it like that, just for fun, but already now it's 12mm along the whole axle.

Ah if he meant the wheels @composites_r_awesome then the Kv is too high. The next DD I am making use custom motors and you can put whatever motors inside as long is the same stator size. To me for 110mm wheels you have to go like 50-60Kv max.

Ok first day back on the 97mm wheels. I have to give up and keep them. The 90mm gives too low clearance. Anyhow I removed the tail and front guard risers and now the overall height it's still the same as 90mm wheels, so really nice. Riding feeling is really good. Popoca is better even if 90mm. Probably need to upgrade to Abec reflex 97mm.
Anyhow based on my calculation rode about 70-85km with them. All fine. Being outside the PU makes them running hand warm and nothing more. Efficiency is really good. Conperable to the Meepo hubs but with double of the power. Increased motor max to 60A to comprate the bigger wheels. Amazing torque. 
Tried to hit the top speed this morning but strava stopped to log. Here the evenkng riding. Pretty fast one considering the traffic and traffic lights

Might have missed it but what OD did you end up with on your motor can ?

I can see you were running 90's which were preferred but changed to 97's due to concerns with clearance.

Obviously will change with road conditions but how much clearance do you think is needed ?

97mm is good. You go around without problem. 90mm it's really a super car, you have few mm left, plus the compression of the wheels underload leaves really small clearance. I would say 97mm is the minimum. The OD is imposed by the origianal motor can, so the final one is 76mm

Ok so 76mm can with a 97mm wheel is 21mm OD reduction / 10.5mm clearance
76mm can with 90 mm wheel is 14mm OD reduction / 7mm clearance

With your ground up build I'm guessing it's something like a 63 series motor, extra thick motor can so say 68mm OD, 90mm wheels, 11mm clearance.

Judging by the test on your mad fury hubs sounds like that should be enough clearance

Pretty close man good math. Yes the nect DD since I don't have the limit of the motor can are going to be 69OD so wheels from 85mm would be fine but I will use popoca 90mm since I love them. This DD, the MAD Fury requires 98mm but I removed the riser I designed to be nose and tail guard and now it is as low as with 90mm wheels. I am actually really surprise and happy of the performance of this motors. They are really strong. It happened already two times that I shit my pants thinking thst I finally hit the top speed but actually it keeps pushing and I get wheel wobbling. I am use them on a 29inch board and although I feel comfortable above 55kmh starts to be tricky :grin:

Fastes ride of the week. Pretty much free road and Felt confident to push my little Spud to the top speed. I didn't keep it for too long just because I am scared of the police. They won't like it :laughing: Although I could feel the motors reached the max ERPM so maybe you get slightly more but I would say that it's enough. I don't know how precise is my phone GPS but that what I got, believe it was fast! Just tested for science not planning to do it again. I pushed really hard this time and the motors were barelly warm. The difference from when they were hub motors is enormous. Really really good, super happy! Ah 97mm wheels.

Yea at minute 8 he makes some choice based on location.  Surely not universal and works for that winding or maybe just that motor wound on that machine.

The method for super low kv redo is to take those multistrand motors, like in the video, with like 5 small strands in parallel in that video, and put those strands in series. No longer (5) 10 foot wire and then (1)50 foot wire.

That's is an interesting approach. It will allow high rpm motor to get to reasonable Kv if someone wants to convert them into hubs.

depends how long and how fast can rid of heat.  and what temp the enamel is rated for.  

the sk3 and most others are probably wound similarly maybe with the same machines even.  I don't know what winding they do but you could dissect it and bet its a DLRK.   but if you were to do it yourself you could end up with a different configuration of the wires and not be able to go by this guy's choosing method of the starts and ends.

I used that video you linked, I happened to be using an sk3 though so it should be correct

However it is all possible just by looking at the motor to find the starts and ends. I had already found out the starts and ends of most of the phases before the video which just confirmed my assumptions. It is quite common sense as it’s clear the machine would have need to start its winding in the middle and work outwards. As it isn’t possible to wind from the outside in. This meant I go find 4 of the phases starts and ends, I didn’t however try to find the last as I came across this video

That easy. The difficult part is to remove the rear metal part with the bearing. I will send you a picture of the motor disassemble until it is really feasible tomorrow. I have motors that I used for design the DD unmounted

Great man! Then you have to tell us how you removed the rear bearing and metal part. Anyhow as @pat.speed said. The start will be the inner wires (close to the center of the stator) while the end the outer wires. That because the winding machine starts from the center to wind the motor.

Plus you should have labeled the pair one. When you separate them from the single phase wire. Then between the 2 the inner is the start and the outer is the end

I just used force, it was easy... Maybe I'm just to strong lol... But I think that putting it back is going to be tougher.
The thing is that only 1 group of wires look to be on the outer part (like in the video)... I'll take a closer look when I am back home.

I identified the pairs and there is a pattern there, so I will just go for it... Now two quetions
1. The ones I am soldering together, should I cut them and make a nob like in the video or would it be the same to just solder them like they are? (that's easier I guess)
2.should I cover the wires with just heatshrink or is there another kind of silicone cover that I should be using? Heatshrink is kinda stiff.

Heat shrinks is good to keep it isolated, so I would do that. You have to remove the enamel in that spot to make the connection then solder

U have to scratch all the enamel off from the three ends when u solder them together, (just make a small nub with them wound n soldered together) and seal the connection after soldering, and get some heat resistant epoxy to pin everything down again and the winding probably isn’t held well to begin with.  Omega heat resistant epoxy in the single pouch is simple and good

Ok, little update. I have been riding them for a while now and so far so good. I am really satifie from the performance, efficiency ecc...to be honest I didn't expect such a good result. Anyhow some people made me think thst the current design is not bullet proof since for a like 2 cm there is a section of 8mm in diameter along the axle. This part is supported before and after but still it is the weaker point. Since few people asked for this kit I then adjust led the design to be a full 12mm steel axle. I am gonna open a thread tomorrow to see if there is interest in a second GB for these hubs and I will also give the opportunity to get this kit. If the interest is enough to be worth it to put time in it I will machine the new truck. All the rest is the same as before. 

Here with the new truck

it's already in the quotation I sent. ABEC, kegel. Now thay there is the 60Kv option, I was thinking to some 5 inch pneumatic too or Bergmeister.
I also thought that in case the price is still too high I could just let them do the flat pulley in front and then we can model the adapter to be 3D printed so everyone can design and make and share his adapters. I think it would be cool, and cheaper for sure.

Just a bit of sun today to record a ride. Unfortunately I used my phone to take the telemetry data and with the new app I used the GPS was taking the speed every 4 sec and stopped in the middle of the ride. 4 sec are way too long so impossible to synchronise it with the video. Anyhow I left almost all the raw footage of the 5km ride. 

General stats:
- Rider weight 85kg
- 12s3p
- 97mm wheels
- Max speed recorded 45kmh (I think I reached 50kmh max today, I tried but I didn't feel stable. Probably is because I played with the trucks and now they are too loose. Didn't want to finish the video with me scratching the concrete. Funny to see it but not to try it :grin:)
- Battery from 50.4V to 47.3V
- Motors temp just after the ride 55^C

I will try to record another one with the telemetry by using other apps, sorry guys. Please @Ackmaniac make your app Unity compatible. Was so easy to show telemetry before.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_kyz2jbb6E&feature=youtu.be

Max speed recorded I think at 8:15 and 10:21

I know you can change it but not the internal UART ports as far as I know. It only does it for the external one. I might have to reread sofus thread again. 

In order to use the internal ones (where unity's BT is connected), you need to be able to switch the baudrate. There's a "special" firmware floating around for this. I have it. Tried it but somehow unity app does not recognize this custom firmware so it disconnects. I may have to play w this again to see if I can get it to work.

Second video with a bit of telemetry. The speed is a bit off. I compare it with the one I get from my watch which is more accurate but I can not export the file in GPX, need it for the video/telemetry overlay. The speed is not perfectly syncro and during fast acceleration it does extrapolate the speed so it's higher than real, it goes back to the real one when the speed is maintained for few seconds. Anyhow top speed was around 55kmh :wink:

Want to replace my commute buddy that served me for the past year. My little spud is great but I need something to everyday with heavy backpacks that damp more the vibrations. So I thought to use the recent MAD Fury kit with a custom 60Kv motor to run Bergmeister wheels from @riverside.rider.
The idea comes from @ervinelin and his amazing short AT. As him I am using a standard skateboard deck, just uncut in my case so that I can shape it as I like it. I will make a thread when it's time but can not wait for it :star_struck:

Bully deck is gonna be a monster :rofl: but 37inch is not feasible for everyday. I need something I can fit in the closets and bring it on the train ecc...
It will get the electronics I have on my board at the moment. I need the new 60Kv motor to pair with MAD Fury, wheels and deck. The rest is already done.

Instead of the riser I want to use adjustable base plate but I stopped my self by making adjustable base plate for caliber and Paris truck. Probably next project :wink: so I can get rid of the riser.

Ok thanks @ervinelin for the pulley file. That made thing way easier. I only had to modified a bit to fit my DD. First try I didn't think enough about the bolts position but now it's fixed. Waiting the new 60Kv motors and deck to make it happen!

Final version
![Haggy_WheelAdapter_MF%20v7|690x388](upload://rVtoiLqwhzaVC7dLf6ifKOvJi2z.jpeg)

@deucesdown I will send you the file once it's tested. I think the 3D printed version is plenty for this pulley. As long you can print it in PETG or ABS or better nylon. 6-7walls, 100% infill.

I will make a thread alone for the new deck and build, but finished the enclosure too. I will build a DIY vacuum forming (or at least try) and use 3D printed mould for it. It should be fine for few tries.

Ok I think it is right now. I will send you the file @deucesdown @pookybear so you can be prepare for when you get the drive. 
You will need 3 M4x30mm and 3 M4 x 12mm each side to lock them in place. Always screw in a star configuration. I will double check the screws leght but should be correct. Too long risk to damage the winding inside the motor.

yeh It's ok. I really do not feel too much difference compare a normal deck. I think they are between 700 to 900g usually. That's why I wanted to shape the thick part only at the bottom and use a ABS enclosure to save weight so that it will be more or less a standard esk8 at the end

Thanks man. Really no problem for Elofty. When I started there where no DD available that's why I spent time to make MAD Fury. Now DD is everywhere so totally fine with it. I am not planning to replace any mass production companies. I won't be able to provide as many drives as a company does. Although I am happy with what I got to be honest. I wanted to provide a new DD and hub motor all in one concept, with replaceable Pullies (with possible future implementing over ABEC, kegel and bergmeister thst are already available). And I wanted to be accessible. Of course never thought to make money out of it otherwise impossible to provide it for the cost I set. More pay back something of the time and cost of development. I decided to give it a try since I am using my DD for a quite some kms now and I am really happy with it. These drives will be more a limited set for who is more in the DIY community perspective and doesn't just want a anonymous train to install on deck and go. From a general customer point of view I would also pick it up from a company first. I started with Meepo hubs and only later wanted something different. Anyhow I will be happy to try the elofty, ownboard, crown wheel DD. Since I am getting a 60Kv version of the MAD hubs as well to mount AT wheels. So similar to the current DD. My standard DD are 75Kv.

Ah I totally missed TB DD :grin: My bad. No those drives are nice. Nothing to say about it. They cost more, but there is more thoughts behind. Just to understand I would have also asked the same in case of real profit. I don't know for them, but CNC all the parts, stronger 7075 Alu for the hanger ecc... Cost a lot.

Edit: Anyhow @BillGordon I don't want to generate any problem, but I got contact from the guys that make the actual drive Elofty sells. They could give the drive for a barbarian price. Now I don't know at how much is currently set the price but for sure not low as they told me.

12s3p 30Q battery.

I am now testing 
Motor max 70A
Motor min - 70A
Battery max 30A each Vesc or 60A unity
Battery min - 8A each or - 16A unity. 

The limit here is my battery. It's rather small so it can not provide all the energy I ask during hard accellerarion. The torque It's already really a lot. Impossible for me to go full throttle and alway pushs up to the top speed. I would be really courious to see results from 12s or 13s 4-5p battery. Too speed should stay but the torque should be even more!
Anyhiw I never went above motor max 50A as hub motors. They get hotter easier if closed in the PU of course. For the moment 70A no problem but they are stated as 50A on the datasheet. Just to know.

Thanks man that means a lot! 

The metr current max for the battery makes me wonder. I set it to 60A and on peak it goes over up to 85.2A. Do you think Unity is not fast enough to overcome to that? I do not think it's a problem since 60A should be continuous current for the 3p 30Q cells, but still I do not think I had the same with previous VESC. The motor max is ok. I actually never reached 140A so I guess I can not with this battery :sweat_smile:

With Lipo you have a lot of current so up to you to test it out :smile:

I can't really say, I only use vesc, and sometime it goes a bit up than the limite... but I never notice something like that (if I remember well)   
maybe copy your post on the unity thread to get some enertion fedback ;)

yeh on the Unity thread they are very busy with all the people mad for the cut out problems with hight Kv motors. So if I post something like that it will just pass. I will wait low tide and post it.

Got those babies!

I'm running them with haggy wheels and even tho they're the 70kv version, they're pretty darn good! 

I don't have metrics... yet, due to what I think is a metr incompatibility with iOS 13.

Pretty satisfied customer

What motor and batt max did you end up using? I'm still accumulating parts for the MAD DD build.

man you where so fast! I ma the last one to try them with haggy that's not right ahahhaah
Amazing deck btw. 

I still have the 60Kv version to try it out. Which battery do you have?
@riverside.rider we are getting there finally! :wink:

Do you have unity or other vesc? BEcause unity has the new app from @sofu and maybe you can be beta tester in case.

I’m on 11s3p 30Q. I’m 30a battery max, -10A battery min, 60/-60 the motors. I’m using two focboxes. 

Right now it’s almost on par (torque wise) with the eLofty 56kv.

Pretty surprise of that since it's a way higher Kv. Sometime I am wondering if that plus minus 20bKv does something in reality.
Anyway if you have focbox you could get a cheap Bluetooth module for a ips app. Wierd that metr has a problem with IOS. I thought it is fully compatible.

On a single motor build I swapped 190kv to 170kv, very noticeable difference! Both were SK3 6374.

Definitely they’re not suited for hills lol
They probably were 200F after a long hill.

With the Haggy they would die only for very very steep hills.

To be honest still have to find a  motor that doesn't get hot on hills or when you push it hard. Thanks for the metr data 😁

Oh yeah no complaints! Strange that I got cut off, we don’t have temp motor. 

Other than that, which was expected... man impressed with the build quality, they’re silent and darn light. Love them!

cut off I guess then is BMS or VESC based. I see the temp when pretty high in your metr data. I wouldn't advice to put them under too much stress on long long hills and with Haggy that ask more power for sure. With urethane they take hills as a champ but after several one I ride a bit more chilly to get them rest a bit. At least that what I do and I have 1000km on mine.

Yup it might be the VESC. IIIRC the cutoff is 100F

Thanks, well to be fair the motor I simply tried all the hubs out there and founda good quality/price. For the DD conversion, then thanks that took a bit of effort to make it happen :sweat_smile:

How were the temps though? Also curious about the TKP setup on a DD!
