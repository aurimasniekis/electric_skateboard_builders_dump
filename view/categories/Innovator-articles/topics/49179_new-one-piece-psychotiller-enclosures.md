ITs about god damn time. HIs monolithic enclosures were sweet as hell but the split boxes didn't sit well with me. 

Maybe now i can get back to figuring out some decent watt hour low rider cruisers.

Alright boys I want a clean and fair fight, nothing below the waist, no eye poking, and only 3 mama jokes per round. Loser has to skate down Baldwin street in a birthday suit with a monkey.

Is there a reason why you make bumpy ones?

Is there a reason why you're so hung up on it? The rough (haircell) finish is cool and doesn't get all scratched
