Hi guys!
It's time to separate this project form the former one https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/mad-fury-mad-hubs-conversion-to-direct-drive/83423/206. 
THis one is going to be my second DD. This time from scratch. Simple plan. Take a big motor and make it direct drive...easy right? :laughing: 
I will update the thread while I am making the parts instead of showing everything at the end.
The DD will be then mounted on the BullyDeck an integrated solution I am making https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/bullydeck-36-inch-drop-down-deck-integrated-enclosure-designing-and-gauging-interest-for-gb/82142/99?u=rey8801 to create The StormBreaker...Of course!

Now that I am using the MAD fury and they are already plenty strong, do not know how I will handle them. Although I am going to use longer deck so I opt that helps.

Have seen some of the cnc trucks using what looked like a screw in bit for the pivot (not sure of proper name)
If they are readily available might be easier then trying to 3d machine the end bit as just need to drill and tap it.
Am super interested in how this turns out, are the trucks just modelled off the caliber 2 trucks?

Damn! I thought about it but never found it. Took like 4hiur to make haf of the pivot! It would be so much easier to screw something on :laughing: I feel really dump a the moment. Thank you for the info.
Yes the base is Caliber II. I will use TB truck to pair them.

That would speed up a lot the process... The pivot part sucks. I checked again but could only find same small pivotball for small downhill truck. Nothing for like caliber or Paris truck. Although I could also machine them separately and then run a m5 screw in it to mount it to the truck.

Other option would be if you have a lathe with a 4 jaw chuck is just leave it as a square on the end and turn the pivot on the lathe, dare say it will get more cylindrical then trying to 3d profile and will be much quicker if your just cutting out a 2d profile. 

Not sure how accurate the dome on the end needs to be ? if it's not critical could just make it close enough with a file or even go all out with a profile tool.

If you don't already know how to cheat indicating a square part Joe Pie did an awesome video on a nice trick

YEh that was a possibility I though about it in case it won't work on the CNC. I went for the CNC way because once set it it does by itself and I can enjoy the afternoon :smile:
I have a mini late at home but it is 3 jaws at the moment (planning of upgrade it). Although I have access to a big lathe at the uni 4 jaws that works like a charm. I do not have the custom adapter to make sperical part so if I making on the lathe would be a bit rough shape and then maybe adjust it manually. I wiil do the lower part today and hope it will be fine. Thanks for the suggestions :wink:

PS: Nice trick btw!

Thanks man. No it's just passion. I have few guy at the Uni that initiated me to a manual lathe work and manual mill. Fell in love with it and start to build my own workshop at home. Moreover I love technology so I try to make semiautomatized whatever I thouch. All my machines are good/entry level so you have to put patience and time to overcome that fact that they are not professional machines. For a hobby level is plenty though. For the rest all self learning. I have been buiding stuffs since I was little, mainly with wood in the past and now with Esk8 only metal :grin: No University degree in that. I am doing a PhD in the faculty of Medicine, studied Biomedical biology, so no background or whatsoever. Use to read a lot in a scientific way, so I make my own laws quite fast. 
If you have questions about what to buy in particular just ask. I also have a new entry a small laser engraver...planning to engrave logos, cut some stylish grip tape with it :laughing:

excatly that one man :wink: Not the basic model, which is good as well, but the slighlty bigger one. The same model has been rebranded and sold by famous brand like HBM for way more. https://www.hbm-machines.com/producten/metaalbewerking/metaaldraaibanken/metaaldraaibankensub/hbm-180-vario-metaaldraaibank?channable=e13762.TVBOMDAwOTg&gclid=CjwKCAiA_P3jBRAqEiwAZyWWaK7e5cYNDaR_3jNGgeSPasbll30YwLGnlDNMHZkesuc5G7JI8h37yhoCKZgQAvD_BwE

This lathe is bigger than the basic model for like 200 euro more. With digital RPM reading, metal gears ecc... I think it's worth it. It's still a little lathe, I have in Uni an industrial one and you can not simple work on this small lathe in the same way as the other. I has to fix at the beginning, tial stock not aligned, tool holder not properly made, but after few customisation here and there I am happy with it. I also mill steel with it. I bought it from Alibaba, they have a warehouse in Belgium and Germany so slightly more but no Taxes for around 550 Euro.

The basic model has been cover from the same guy I posted above. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05vUCdzhoe4
It will give you an idea of the actual machine. This one you can find it for 350 on AMazon.

I’m really torn between the base model and next model up, there doesn’t seem to be much difference except the digital display and stronger looking shield cover. 

Also here in Aus the price for the base is about $550 and the next is $999 so it’s almost double the price

Ah ok I didn't realized you are in AU. Double is a lot indeed. Believe me that it's not for the digital reader what worth the money, since I use my hear and chips evacuation to understand if I am milling right, but you want the machine to be as heavy as possible. Rigidity is everything in this machine, CNC in general. PLus the work area is really limited in the small one. You have to consider the chuck you have, the bigger one go up to 100mm in diameter, the small one I think 70mm but can be wrong. Although if you think it is enough for your use, than perfect. Just be aware that the difference is a lot. One is like 20-25Kg, the other 60Kg.

For instance to make motor can often you won't find the right piece of metal and you have to start bigger. A 63xx motor usually has a 70mm motor can. Like now just got the metal pieces I need and the big cylinder won't probably fit in the small lathe. If you have access to a big lathe to just reduce the size of the pieces then it's fine

Man respect level just went up a notch, not sure why but I thought you had a much bigger mill and lathe. Just goes to show that you can get a good product off if you take the time to learn and tweak your machines.

@pat.speed I'm going to warn you now, metalworking is a very expensive rabbit hole you can fall down. Something like a minilathe is a minimum viable lathe. Like it's better than no lathe at all but you will find its limitations real quick. As Rey said rigidity / weight is king, depending on budget & space you might be able to pick something up second hand. Treat a mini lathe like a kit, you get all the parts you need but will need to do some finishing before it's really usable. Rule of thumb is also what you spend on the machine, you will spend that much again on tooling

I posted pics of a bigger lather thst I used in part for the first DD I made. Thst is at the Uni. Such a nice machine, metal is butter. I had to go for a lathe max 50-60kg due to the fact that my workshop is in the basement with a very little entrance. Otherwise a guy I know was selling a super nice lathe for like 600 Euro, 150Kg with cutting oil tray ecc...really nice but No way I could get it in the basement.

Yes is the small model Stepcraft 2 300. Limited in size better for metal since the mechanics is the same of the bigger onee but shorter in the axis. I chose that one since I wanted to use for projects and not spend time in building a own one. At the end as usual you pretty much understand too late that you need to spend a lot of time to fine tune the machine (almost a month) and I ordered spare DIY parts to make it way better. I should have waited a bit and read more. Well lesson learnt. It's a good machine but you can build a better one for the same amount of money. 

This evening not thst much time so finished the truck...

I machined the first 5 mm to create a precise guide and then use the drill press. Most of the end mill does not reach such deepness, moreover on small CNC. Plus a 40mm end mill will create so much vibrations that won't be precise. 3rd the drill press is faster :wink:

The inner stator has already cut out for former keyway. I am going to reproduce at the CNC the other side on the outer pipe. Plus I will also add loctite or high temp epoxy to further secure the stator. Both should be fine.

I will go for both. Yes I have the right loctite looked few times ago
Like 648 or something like that. Made to stop two cilindric parts from rolling. Tempersture up to 150 degree if I remebe correctly and it also give an extra 0.1mm thickness. I also have a high temp epoxy that should be more similar to what I have found when I unmounted the motors.

ah ok got it, yes it is a possibility. What I will probably do it is a key way and loctite or epoxy for the stator, then grub screw from the stator pipe to the axle and screw that connects the rear stator pipe to the truck. In this way should be really solid.

U have a lot of bare space on the hub part. Maybe too late this time but u could have the motor case like half an inch smaller.  The stator is far far from the wall on the back.  That little lip on the hub seems helpful but is limiting where the stator will go along.  I like to get it all the way touching the back wall as it can turn transfee from copper straight to that wall (yours aluminum especially would be greasy to transfer the heat.  Maybe motor so big it’s not important).  But that big space of pure pure air in the motor!

These are pics of how flipsky put their sensor. I don’t put a sensor in and u can see how tight.  I don’t know if uve tried without sensors but good enough to me and rather have it filled with motor.  The Vesc was designed to give good control n tortque at startup without sensors and I think he did a great job   
A lot of people squeak sensors in without any room individually.  Tons of work though. And they always seem to break.

I thought that air left is not that bad. It's really the closest I can go without touching the pcb. Do you advice to use special loctite, I think it was 648, or a high temp epoxy glue to secure the stator to the pipe? The motor came with epoxy glue.

Well let's say 5mm is the pcb, the rest Is the 3 motor oahse wires that are not positioned really well. Maybe I can try to heat it up and fold them a bit more but I thought it would be safer like that.

If you see the picture with the motor in the late you see the thickness taken by the pcb and the wires. So there is 5mm left for sure. The problem that the motor phases wires are really thick and I don't want to bend them too much

You really soak the stator pipe in glue before secure the stator. Is it glue the white surface I see or it's a different type of coating?
The pcb is not to big my problem are the motor wires that are made to stick out from the side and I moved them to the back. I will see better. Maybe I can fold them better and save overall 1cm.

I do wye and the wye bundle and the three magnet wire phases leave the motor and then add the leads.  Safer as the connection between them and all the beehive with them is a risk.    You’ll have to get some good high temp thin epoxy to put on all the magnet wire while covering the shafts, as in my pic they’re covered w silicone.  I haven’t found a better way not as hugely time consuming but all the wire inside has to be fixed solid or will short really quickly



I have an interference fit with the stator on the hub which I really like. Pressed. No keyway complication. There’s a keyway slot on hub n stator n gets resin vacuumed in when also coating all the magnet wire.

No glue until one time in the pot n vacuum.  The resin is translucent.  That grey-white is the silicone protecting the shafts and inside the hub. And a bit of kapton tape is there too to take off the resin as it catches at bottom of the teeth

I see. Why the wires should short so quickly? Due to vibrations or what? I was thinking to cover the back with high temp epoxy to secure in place all the motor phase wires (I think they are delta), then secure it to the stator pipe. I mean the whole central part is not gonna rotate

Just vibrations they will short to the hub or maybe themselves.  The insulation gets worn. Without resin holding, Ive heard of it being done with a hub motor and shorted in moments.  The old motors I had made all were mechanically good with the only problem ever happening was the shorting of magnet or phase wires inside.  More than any other reason that why I make them now.  I put silicone hose coming out of the motor and the magnet wire goes through and outside of the motor and then solder the leads. Safer.  No rubbing wires as they come out.  That’s how more motors broke than any other way even with three layers of shrink.  And then it’s a paperweight.

Never thought about it. That makes sense. I never saw a motor made with this principle but indeed it's a issue. I have bought a high temp silicon like 200 degree. Do you think it's better. I could squise it inside the motor phase wire to damp vibration

There’s a lot of variation in silicone and don’t know but generally you’d want an epoxy for this specific use.  There’s places that specialize in it (epic resins) but I don’t know the details of what makes it unique and I’m sure you could get away with some more standard thin unfilled epoxy.  I use a one-part I bake in but two-part stuff can be good. I like the single envelopes for 20$ from Omega.

Awesome project! I have been mulling over getting a CNC mill as well but it is likely to be heavily under utilised..... 

How is your step craft holding up when cutting aluminium? So far in terms of budget and availability (being in Asia), I am severely limited by what the local distributors carry. But I do have a step craft dealer, so that's one possible option.

I had previously not looked at it because it's still a router... Not ideal for metal work. But seems like you got it to cut metal just fine..

Thanks! I follow your pejects, really inspiring.
As I wrote in another post I chose Stepcraft to have something to use instead of building but then I spent the same amount of time to make it right. So with the s mount of money you can male your own CNC with better spec. It's not difficult you have to read about a bit and you can make one. As a good cheap entry level around 1200-1500$ you can get a CNC 6040 frame (classic one you find every where in Asia), but buy the model with supported axis, miche stronger, then there are kit for the motors, drive and breakout board with nema23, perfect to start with, and a spindle 1.5w or better 2.2w air (easier to maintain) or liquid cooled. That's it. The rest you have to learn it anyway. How to use a CNC doesn't chenge between the model.
Now I order same kit to make the stepcraft better. I won't buy the same one, just build one.

Actually I have been researching on converting a proper mill to CNC. The routers no matter what have less mass and as a result are not as suitable for metal.

I am narrowing it down to a Sieg SX2.7 as it's one of the very few desktop Mills I can get my hands on locally. Then kit it up with CNC. But the pricing is going to escalate easily way past a 6040... 

Also I am pretty sure I am going to get an earful from the Mrs.

Of course converting a manual  
Mill to a CNC one is the best option for metal. D
Fixed spindle is just way more rigid than a router. Although I would still chose a router because the mill is more expensive and I understand the extra rigidity for production parts where time is one of the main factor. But a router with supported axis,screws and few reinforced parts of you want the extra kit it's plenty for aluminium. You will have problem with steel thought. The sofferenze is that will take swallow passage and overall more time to make the parts but you will have the versatility of a router and work on several applications. Of you want more you can go for psed loop motors, 3 times more expensive bur anlther world.

Just checked and the mill you suggested is actually pretty good. Here a guy the converted and seems a feasible job https://r.tapatalk.com/shareLink?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ecnczone%2Ecom%2Fforums%2Fshowthread%2Ephp%3Ft%3D305810&share_tid=305810&share_fid=11158&share_type=t
 The axis are easy accessible to install the stepper motor. Apparently nema34 for Z, due to weight.
As software I use mach3 but UCCNC is cheaper and easier.

Today I have done some progress. The MAD Fury are ready for release. I will update that thread too. 
For the MAD Storm I took the time to think about what @Hummie said. Played a bit with the epoxy and indeed if I heat it up a bit it becomes really thin. Nice trick! Tired in some metal parts I think it's feasible to use to to cover the wires. Finished the stator, made the key way, super professional one :joy:
I also reduced the gap and between stator and pipe. Overall I gain 1cm along the entire axle. That's a lot!

The MAD Fury is taking me a lot of time. But Here the last update... Finished one side and at good point for the other one. The motor can has to shorted a bit to the right size but will do it later. Need to drill precise hole for mounting Pulley ecc... I hope to don't mesh up everything right at the end otherwise :sob:

Also need to blueing the steel, never done before. I think I will do it by heat it up until it gets drak grey then quenc it in motorcycle oil. Then I will paint it with the rest of the drive. I wanted to keep it silver but it has to be protected otherwise it will rust over time.

Yes i know but then it's really a weka surface protection, while quencing is stronger and goes a bit deeper. I will try if it is too difficult I will do cold blueing for sure. After will be painted anyway.

Yes, I thought about it but didn't want to find a company willing to do it here. Plus I did for my motorcycle few years ago and even thanks to a friend I saved a bit it will still cost me like 100 Euro easy. At that point I would actually by the kit and do it by myself. It's rather easy. That's why I wanted to leave it silver to don't bother about painting that always looks bad after a while.

Motors will get beaten up whatever the paint is on them, unless they are like top mounted
The kits for powder coating are not expensive, and you could offer that as an option (I assume you will sell these)

For the moment that just for me. Not sure people want such a big DD. I would also choose raw metal look that will give the bad ass look with wood or black deck. The problem that the motor can in steel to me ferromagnetic and it needs to be covered. If I blue it will be darker then the rest. Probably still nice but different for sure.

What type of stainless steel did you use? If it is hardened heating it to these temperatures and quenching with cause it to lose strength and become tougher, meaning it will bend easier but will be harder to snap

i think I am going to use a torch and then quenching in motor oil. I know I won't get and even surface but yeh that what I have at the moment.
The screws I ordered all stainless steel, just waiting for them to come. But not planning to use the skate in rain anyway.

For the stator pipe, yeh I removed the rear flag as you suggested it but indeed now I do not have nothing at the back. Now is too late to change it. I have a wall to stop it in the inside but I have seen other motor with nothing out side. I will use loctite to keep it there and make a strong thin wall with epoxy outside. If it doesn't work I will remake the pipe but not looking forward for it. Then I did not really got how you can mechanically secure the bearing if you only have a wall inside. The only solution I see is to have an additional component either attached to the rear pipe or to the central hanger.

```
Quenching is a hardening process while bluing is just protective.  You probably don’t want the metal hardened as it’ll be more likely to crack or slightly warp in the temp shock.  The part would then be harder in the magnetic circuit and have a harder time switching polarity and increase iron losses. (Although it’s behind the magnets and really won’t see much switching and likely will just be worse at containing the magnetic field.  The milder the steel the better.  You just want an oxide coating and can get that from just bluing and air cooling 


U can glue the bearings and imagine you plan to but the retaining fluid will eventually break down and the bearing needs some walls so it won’t slide off to the outside or inside.  Your design is similar to the raptor or mellow boards I think. 
Theres bearing that have a wall integrated into them and maybe easier.

Well I will read more but for blueing still that what I found. You heat it up until you get the colour you want, like dark grey. then quenching the parts in oil, vegetable or better engine oil. That what I found. I used mild steel and is it rather ferromagnetic.
As @pat.speed suggested, I will recreate the clamp with a 1mm ring behind the bearing. The front is well lock, is the rear that without the wall is not well held in place. I will put the something. Not a big deal. Just more machining.

And maybe need a bearing wall for big bearing on the bell if not already 

If u made the bell a single machined part and not with the plate bolted on the outside it would be a lot more metal that would be lathed down, and I’m not sure how you even have things, but would allow better precision and strength.   Extruded steel with a plate bolted on is maybe mechanically fine but then again maybe it’s fraught with machining risks and work too.  If one piece you could machine it lighter, stronger, and more precise.  Get some crazy small airgap n make a better motor.

Bearing has an internal wall from the bell. The bell is a single mild steel piece. The bolt from the outside are for the pulley. I did separately otherwise the metal to be machined would be too much and a waste for me. The two parts are really tight together. Probably less then 0.1mm between the two. I had to use an industrial grade lathe to machine those. My mini lathe was screaming...too strong and too big metal piece. With small steel piece is ok, but for big one I used the big brother. Like 1.5 tons of lathe. I love it. Everything feels like butter.![IMG_20190320_175937|690x388](upload://2YQ4BewjAlr01vfZtZPFogZPPbV.jpeg)

Been a while but this weekend I spent all the free time on it. I wanted ti give it a burst otherwise it will never happen. I would say 70% done. One side spin better then the other. I have to check why one is better centered. I made both in the same way. Anyhow now I need to blueing the can and probably paint it if the colour contrast at the end is not what I want. Then the axle step down and that's it.
This thing is heavy. Almost 3.5kg...the motor can in steel are massive.

Polish, blue, clear coat, then instantly scratch it.   Bluing it is at least easy.  I tried to polish an aluminum bike frame once and that was like 12 hours of not much. I think u should gold plate them.  Could be a rare crinkled gold crushed look years later.  Or it chips off.   Even if it rusts on the outside badly wouldn’t matter and inside maybe ..that could maybe happen w them sealed even.  Get behind the glue.  I highly doubt it. U and I will be the only blued motors I’ve seen.  But be nice to see a blued steel accessory for an out runner!

Well the all the bolts are not in place yet. Bearings has to be fixed with loctite too. I will also need the wheels to keep the motor can in place andottle compress the whole motor. Probably won't be 100% perfect anyway since everything was made manually and although I spent a lot of time on it I won't be able to have the same low tollerance everywhere as production parts. So far the motors spin really well, they are 14 poles but they turn really smooth.
In the video are BLDC sensorless. I will try FOC, I hope e my old maytech esc won't immidiately die on it :sweat_smile:
I will blue the motor can alone. Magnets are attach to an internal motor can. I am going to use heat to blue it.

Thanks.
No, I think it's mostly because the motor can needs the wheel to compress the whole motor together. So now the motor can shakes a bit. Anyhow It won't be with the same tollerance everywhere. My tool are entry level and my needs too high grade. Now I am dreaming for a CNC upgrade but not for the moment :grin:

If I have that noise it comes from a loose tolerance somewhere.  He probably already knows but with a slide fitting, which is easier and less expensive, you can get retaining compounds to fill the gap.  Epoxy for bearings.  Worth doing and there’s different ones for high temp or bigger gaps

Exactly I am going to fill the gaps with high temperature retainer loctite or high temp epoxy. I have both but I will probably go with the specific loctite product since seems made for that. All my cylindrical parts are getting loctite. My bearings sit thight but no press fit. Too difficult to achieve it and I needed to remove the bearings several times during testing

Yes but it's an integrated deck if I start drill ports on the side you loose the concept. It has to look as close as possible as normal deck. I am also thinking of using just start to push to do not instal any power button. I got a micro bms but doens't balance. The smaller 12s I see from Bestech is the one @Chase used (http://www.bestechpower.com/444v12spcmbmspcbforli-ionli-polymerbatterypack/PCM-D606.html). Can mine is 10mm wider. I will see. By my test the fit it's really tight. If someone knows a really small bms that actually work let me know!

I always make custom balance leads, and crimping PH for me has very very low success rate, and prone to break. So I'm more likely to use inline splices for these things, which I also don't like.

probably ebike jump to 13s. the problem with 13s is that they might not balance actually loosing the all point of the story. In my understanding the balacing starts when the bms detects the max voltage and a 12s battery with 13s bms won't reach it. Or is the max voltage for each cells?

I'm with you, get 12s bms for 12s pack. None of the mfgs documents the behavior or their bms so it's a gamble.

no I checked in the past as well never found the 12s. 10s, 13s always present. My question is if the 13s will balance the 12s battery since you won't reach the max voltage of the total package or is the max voltage on a single cells? In the latest case it should work.

The "one-port 25A" option seems like the one.

As @acido said they have tiny balance current.

Did u glue the magnet wire down?  Be nice to see the inside and winding.  Or I forget maybe u reused another wound stator too.  The magnets I think u wrote u pressed it into the steel sleeve. Be nice to see the kv before and after the big steel sleeve

If you mean the motor phase wires, yes I did. And on one side I did a mistake. Basically I paid attention to leave all the space for the stator pipe but apparently on one side I reduce the rear diameter a bit. So since the stator pipe was not sliding all the way I remove the stator and heated it up with the heat gun to adjust the epoxy. Well I adjusted but probably was not completely cured yet, sloded the pipe stator and guess what. Now it's impossible to remove it anymore :laughing: I guess if I have to remove the stator on thst side will be quite a challenge with the heat gun. I was just a bit tired and overlooked that little little aspect :rofl:

Do you know if it will balance 12s too? Meaning the balance starts when 4.2V is reached on the p groups or when the overall voltage is at his maximum? I guess on single P group but maybe you now it.

Thank you man appreciate a lot, but if you look at the space I have in picture above, you can see that I need the smallest thing ever. I have a 12s d140 and it's already too big.

I can confirm that you can by the 13s from the seller and leave them the message that you want the 12s and they will make it for you. Thank @Acido for the trick. I asked the size of the 16A since it look the smallest they have.

I think so. I took a pic this morning I have 55mm max width so both the bestech (55mm wide) and the waterproof one should be fine (probably smaller the 16A). Bestech usually are good. Waiting the reply of both of the sellers and I will decide.

I made the mistake of that guy and bought the 12s lifepo4 one DUH! If anyone is running a lifepo4 12s battery and wants it for shipping cost DM me...sorry for derail @rey8801 

But to kind of keep it on topic(bms), I asked if they could give me any instructions on if it is possible to change the charge voltage to li-ion (even with a programmer) and the answer is **sorry no can do**

No problem...Yeh I am getting from them the right one. 12s LiIon. You only have to ask them to make the right one. They will tell you to order the 13s and leave the message, "please I need the 12s". They shipped the next day.

I know. I was wondering wheter the overvoltage protection during charging will work as well. Since there is stated as 53V and not single cells. Do you know if in that case it works on single series group as well?

I am not sure if it is set up for individual balancing, I would assume so as it has a balance lead connection it does balance but I haven’t tried with this bms myself.

I think balance would be individual, but the overall overcharge protection from charging I am not sure. Anyhow if you ask you get the 12s for the same price so why to bother about it :grin:

How would the bms know what series to balance if it reads only overall voltage? So im pretty sure it does read individual parallel groups.

## \#272 Posted by: rey8801 Posted at: 2019-05-13T16:23:49.130Z Reads: 134

No normally bms for balancing works on single series groups that why in the datasheet you read 4.18 plus minus 0.025V. It's for the overall charging protection that I am not sure.
```

---
## \#273 Posted by: RedBaron Posted at: 2019-05-13T17:04:41.734Z Reads: 134

```
Ah I see. The way I understood it was when voltage is applied and the balance board manages the series groups. If one group is disconnected the rest of the pack still gets charged despite it and even though the bms wants to reach 42v (on 10s) it senses the missing series and stops charging all together. That's why when a pack had lost a series the battery only charges to like 38v instead of 42. (For 10s)
```

## \#274 Posted by: rey8801 Posted at: 2019-05-13T17:37:37.188Z Reads: 135

For balancing for sure thst what it does. What I said is that I am not sure if the overall voltages is read it as single series groups of 4. 2V or if the bms look at the the real value like 42V for 10s. In the case yuu describe for sure is on the single series groups. In thst case it's good since you can use a 13s bms for a 12s with virtually no difference. I was doubting because the I do not understand why when the out overcharge protection they write the total V of 42V for instance instead of 4.2V. To me thst would be more clear and solve all my doubts
