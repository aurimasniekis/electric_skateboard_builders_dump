If you are going there, go all the way with a hypoid gear so you can off set the motor from the wheels for clearance and still keep it parallel to the ground. Plus I think they sound cool!

Nice work, just a few coments, you need to keep an eye on the axial force imposed on the shaft and consequently on the bearings of the motor if you plan to use helical bevel gears, they may no be up to the task

The wheel gear can be smaller, and by making a new shaft to the motor you don't have to limited to the length of original shaft and can also incorporate an angular bearing to prevent any axial force on the motor bearings

I think a dual setup rear mounted at and slight angle would make a killer visual

That would make it even cooler rear mounted, add an butane reservoir and an switch conectes to the remote and you can have fire shooting motors

The only problem with hypoid is slight lower efficiency, but I don't think it matters here

that wheel is 86mm, if I recall correctly, the motor gear is 10 tooth and the wheel gear is 28.  Reason for the odd gearing is because of space constraints, bigger wheels will make this much, much easier

I love exploring the topic between belts vs gears. Don't know if this applies here, but in the RC world, gears and belts are used with great success. Those gears are gonna be very expensive to make though, that is what I worry. A quality machined and hardened gear costs quite a lot to make. A sintered powder metal one is what you would expect.

I worry a little on the condition of the gears though. A rock in a gearset like that will not go down well. It is very easy to chip a tooth on one of the gears as hardened gears are strong but rather brittle. Running them dry will also not be very good for too long.

That being said I still want to see it done.

Yeah, for sure it needs a box, if you go with helical or hypoid profiles a oil bath is a must since there's a lot of slipping happening, without it the teeth will wear "fast"

I mainly use Solidworks, but it's easy to export and share

I took a quick look in a few books that i had here, almost certain that the module will be between 1 and 1.5mm considering 1000W per motor, so the number of teeth will go up and their size will shrink, that's also good for noise and wear, since we have more tooth face in contact for a given instant

What's your engineering rational for the bevel gears?  Just curious, not trying to challenge you

One advantage I see with belts over direct drives is the dampening effect.  On a belt-driven powertrain, vibrations are not directly transferred from the wheels to the motor

I know it's a very early concept, but I would recommend using bigger wheels or a smaller gear. You've got very little clearance right now, and any impact would wreck some havoc on the gears.  Good luck!

GM I was thinking what pitch too, Im guessing depending on material you could drop the pitch... you could make em... or buy em off the shelf I'll find a link and add it below. 
If you reduce pitch you will have more teeth ;)

Just a wild idea i had on my mind for a while, Nowinds Direct Drive uses POM Gears and POM can be 3d printed. Or even Polycarbonate. 
3D Printing the stuff would make manufacturing a lot easier i guess, but it's hard to know if it will hold up without trying out. So far my expectations regarding durability for 3d printed parts have always bin exceeded.

I think the big gear (drive gear) can be 3d printed and nylon is the most suitable material. It is self lubricating and holds up well. The smaller motor spur gear can be the part that is metal/aluminum as it will need to be for the heat coming off the motor.

Obviously this is the setup i refer to... smaller gear get from maedler.de or some US vendor already pre-made and just use whatever pitch they have. The larger gear nylon 3d print.

So on durability this was @Nowind results using POM but nylon is even better... the strongest there is. You just need a e3d-v6 hotend ($28) for your 3d printer. His system of course is an enclosure and he uses total power grease. I have used white lithium grease from home depot ;)

If you don't have an enclosure though... i don't know if greasing is an option?

Why don't you take this a step further and create an axle style truck that would still have a section for the bushings and the kingpin to go through, and a nipple to sit in the pivot cups?

You could mount the motor under the deck, facing inwards (toward the front if at rear), and one motor could drive both wheels...
Heck, if you spent some more time you could even integrate a diff in there for those thinking that the fixed axle is going to affect steering (which for most of us, won't).

Actually I like the idea of one motor per wheel.  It eliminates issues with slipping and makes braking better.  The differential would suck for hard braking compared to two smaller motors.

Of course it wouldn't. The differential would lock and you'd have the same braking capabilities as a single motor, single wheel drive setup. In fact it'd be a bit better because two wheels will be gripping instead of just one, which would mean there'd be less chance of skidding...

I'm looking at it from the perspective of going over pebbles, a brake on the differential would be robbing the other wheel of stopping power.  I'd far prefer two wheels braking independently, even for half the wattage, than one differential braking two wheels

Maybe u know, and was already said, there'll be axial forces and you'll likely need thrust bearings on both sides.  And the mount will have to take that axial force as well. 
That design above and use a floating axle for one of the wheels, so just one wheel drive...be slick

Anyone seen any videos of helical gears because they're said to be very quiet but hard to find in every way.

 But printing them..the hardest to manufacture part seems easy now if u make it big enough to be strong enough. Maybe. And while they would look awesome be a shame and have to cover them. But bet that could even make a clear composite like that pic. Carbon where needed in the mold.  I would love to try but too busy for that monster. Print all the parts make molds of them. Pour and suck them w fiber already in the mold or make a slushy w carbon.  If u can print the parts and make molds ...

lol I know how that feels.  I'll probably end up printing the bigger one with something like abs+ or something strong like that to reduce cost.  Of course, this all depends on durability...

Yes of course, but that's not seen as a problem is it? The 'gearbox' contains the oil, there's no chance of leakage unless the housing is compromised...

This would mean one sweet sounding, almost silent dive train!

Doesn't look like much, but that was a ton of work.  In that picture is just the axle for one side.  They will be a standard 180mm hangar truck unless I change it later.  I still have to design a hangar, a gearbox (this one will be fully encloused :) )  and a whole bunch of other stuff.  Ill keep chugging away until I fall asleep today and continue work tomorrow :wink:

If you use a thicker oil in the differential you have a limited slip differential, it would help when one looses traction, but when i say thicker, is really thick, the ones you turn the bottle upside down and it doesn't move

i assume the shiny bit is your printed piece. I think it needs to be shorter so it and the motor pinion clears the cup on the baseplate.
I'm guessing you will machine the hangar to accept a bearing and mount the _piece_ to the bearing. Then it will be supported and will be aligned?
but it is your design little bro... keep at it :)

I think you're going too big. If you're going for internal gears you can go a lot smaller, smaller than you'd need to with anything external like a pulley. The motor pinion can be a lot smaller too because you're not having to make sure a belt stays on it and doesn't jump etc. it's meshing directly with other teeth...

Think 1/8th RC axles.... If you can make one of those with internal bearings and so that a flywheel can fit on the end, you're laughing!

There may even be a scenario, if you can think of a good solution, to have no need for any wheel adapters... Think about, instead of bearings, the 'bearings' in the case for the drive wheel were solid and don't spin? You tighten them up to the drive axle and the axle spins with the wheel held solid to it....

[/quote]

That is actually exactly my idea for this one!  The gear will be smaller, but also, bolted to the drive axle which will have the flywheel adapter attached solidly to it.  The bearings are there so the axle can rotate independently of the hangar. On the end is a left hand thread so the nut doesn't become loose over time.  I will leave the normal bearings in the wheels though just for simplicity, I don't need another piece to make...

Yes, inside the wheel bearing's housing... that's why I said "if you can think of a good solution"... maybe sharp teeth on the outside of that fake bearing to eat in to the plastic of the flywheel...? Dunno, just a thought as that, under a person's weight might just immediately strip...

If you can find a good way for it to stay put, as I say, you wouldn't need an adapter...

I have decided to make the Jenso style direct drive priority for now.  Mostly because its easier to design and I can manufacture for cheaper since I can do it on my own CNC.  Flywheel version will be printed tomorrow.  If all goes well I will order a couple of motor gears (not super expensive) and work on the gearbox.

So my thoughts were, rather than just copy Jenso's mount which is a cool mount in itself, but improve on it with your original idea of a bevel gear.

The bevel gear lets you put the motor in a 90 degree plane to allow for larger motors and also handle smaller gear ratios.

Essentially take this...

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/e/3/e30f8320eaf95b51bc41898b002762db71742575.jpeg" width="237" height="213">

And put it in here... and fold the enclosure 90 degrees along the purple dotted line towards the truck:

Hey!

I've "finished" [my bevel gear longboard](http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/bevel-gear-racerstar-6368-6s-5000mah-arduino-uart-514/35189) today. I didn't do any CAD designs, mainly because i immediately wanted to start :D

Some findings i've had:
-You need to be able to adjust to motor position in all axis. If your gears aren't fitting accurate they won't the needed momentum. (I was able to change the angle.. but thats not really necessary)
-Think about adding some kind of oilpath to reduce friction. I didn't drive far but aren't looking great anymore.
-At least close the gears. I don't want to know what happens, if you'll get a stone between the gears while driving.

Nice work! figure out how to make a cover --- think it will a little tricky because where will it mount to?

Without a cover... it's likely to be a bit dangerous.

I don't know if you've ever been in to RC cars, I mean proper RC cars, but it sounds like you've got the pinion too far in to the teeth of the spur, (too close together), it needs like 1mm clearance at least.

The way you've got the pinion, like part off of the spur is the correct position to have it in though, you never have them fully meshed.

Looking good though. What do you envisage this being made out of for reals though, ali?

Yea I made the screw holes too small on the mount and was too lazy to take them out to move the motor...

Big gear will probably be printed out of POM like @Nowind and small gear will be steel.

After seeing this thread, I modeled this in Inventor in a few hours. I will probably try to improve it this weekend. It's pretty similar to the image you posted @darkkevind, and I even implemented your solid bearing idea. I'll try to switch the gears to hypoid gears, so the motor can be moved closer to the deck and be quieter.

I have access to a full free machine shop that has CNCs, so I might be up for trying this in a few weeks.

Hey @GrecoMan just wondering, since you mount at 90¬∞ your motors why not use 3 pulley gears instead of 2 ? It would solve your wheel size / gear sizes limitations. You can put a smaller diameter on the wheel and keep outrunner design ? Even a normal shaft & standard motor can do.

Edit : Forget about straight cut gears, I've seen there are many options discussed already

True that's what I thought first too but if you use 3x 45 degrees pulleys (invert motor pulley so angle faces the motor) it might be able to do the trick with standard parts.

Greco would need to use proper size and adapted mount though

maybe with tech these days and 3d printers you could print a helical gear and make a silicone mold and pour a couple in steel.  be awesome if it were a quiet helical but they seem crazy expensive to get made.  maybe wouldn't be the strongest steel but if it had a large interface between parts to transfer load bet even mild steel would be good.

helical seems really expensive from my looking but syched to hear the differences.  it's hard to find examples of sounds from helical gears and instead it's just said they're very quiet.  if pouring metal is too much you could make the mold and do it will a resin and carbon or even just fiberglass with the resin sucked in.  composites are damn strong.  quieter too.

assuming this all goes perfectly and I get a working system without problems, how much would anyone actually pay for a complete setup? kinda just curious. full setup means:
1x POM or ABS wheel spur
1x Steel Motor Spur
1x Alu 7075 Motor Mount
1x Gearbox Cover
[poll type=regular]
* $75-100
* $100-150
* $150-200
* $200+

obviously the higher cost would result in higher tolerances in machining and overall better quality

why helical gears? are the mechanical advantages significant enough for the additional cost and design complications? all of the videos I've seen of your board show it running really loud, which means there is probably a lot of vibration, not good for obvious reasons.

I do love the idea and concept though. I just feel like a simpler design would have been easier to execute.

maybe if your gears had a different interface or more contact area they would be quiet?  I guess helical is a pretty broad category.  I think you can get some made steel or something and they could be very qiuiet.  but maybe you needed steel because of this small contact area yours use as well?

I used this same method, the problem I had was with torque and differential.  The 1:8 scale differential was just shredded after about 30 minutes of riding.  After trying it with 3 I discovered it was the takeoff and braking that shredded the internal gears.  Unless you use larger gears with better tolerances and much stronger materials this is just a creative way to bust up  a board and your hands :slight_smile:

I came across [these](http://www.samagaga.com/Product.aspx?ProductID=DG7201) the other day. They're 66mm x 102mm and designed for tricycles (human/electric powered), so I'd imagine they are a bit more suitable for esk8... if you could get them to fit. They'd handle the torque, but would need to spin a lot faster than what they were designed for (skateboard wheel diam vs bicycle wheel diam). From what I've found on random forums, prices seem to be under 100USD.

I had 8x16x6mm (I think) outside of the diff & inside the wheels on both sides, used snap rings to keep them in place with an milled aluminum cylinder holding everything.  Used an old caliber 2 hanger, cut down to about in inch from the beginning of the pivot pin, welded on both sides to the aluminum cylinder.  I wasn't built well, but it was good enough.  

I think the problem I had was that the torsion stress of the axles would feedback into the diff causing it to loose alignment.  That caused it to essentially disintegrate from the inside out, which had the resulting action of throwing on my big ugly face :slight_smile:.

Yea I think he used a one way bearing though, which really fucks with the brakes

that is true, but with another single motor up front for brakes the torque would be insane.  anyway, it will take some serious material that can stand high torsion stress and manufactured to high tolerances.  it wouldn't hurt if the diff was in a sealed housing full of lithium grease.

Be careful with grabcad, I downloaded very often not precise cad files, and ended up making them myself.
The problem with grabcad is, that there is no control for uploaded files.

I like it when people call me genius...I mean, its all bullshit, but I still like it :smile:.
 
Im sure they came from Alibaba or eBay.  This is how to do it, at least  think this is the safest and most long lived method...who knows.

That's really, really awesome....

I think this setup would go really well with an APS motor...and single VESC....

@marcmt88 - maybe adopted to fit 80mm motors... definitely would need a 1/2" riser for sure .  It would be a beastly board.
