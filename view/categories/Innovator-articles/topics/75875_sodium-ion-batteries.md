Hi Guys! 

I saw the below video about this new type of battery

Supposedly it can be transported with ease and zero chance of exploding or catching fire being that they can bee discharged to 0 volts when transported without any kind of side effect.

Please tell me what you guys think if it would be a good idea to make a battery pack for your build.

In 10 years yes. Right now they are less energy dense.
