Todays modern DIY Esk8ter requires 30Q batteries, a TSG helmet, 107 mm Superfly wheels, Turnigy SK3 motors.... and [Flatland3D](https://flatland-3d.com/) & [Knox Armour](https://www.planet-knox.com/) E-skate gloves, which are regarded as the worlds first dedicated esk8 gloves.

What's the difference with regular protected gloves ? DH gloves have pucks, right. There are also models without pucks. "Mitaine" style or "full glove" for both. So where does this model fit ?

btw I think there is a mod for either a remote adapted to a DH glove with puck, or a glove with puck worked down to get space for a remote. I don't remember well but have seen it, should be popular for e-skateboarding too.

$50 for that is quite expensive. I would rather check motorcycle gloves, you can probably found some for a better price with more protection. And cut the tip of each finger if that's what you want :stuck_out_tongue:

How are these " dedicated esk8 gloves"?  They look just like mountain biking gloves.  You can't even slide with them

These are e-skate gloves:

[quote="jmasta, post:7, topic:34281, full:true"]
Half-finger gloves work well.  I hold the remote in my rear hand, so I can wear a puck on the front glove to throw 1-handed heelside slides if needed

Or Carvon's prototype... (seems like it still needs some development work, but the following post is from 6 months ago)

[quote="NummThumz, post:19, topic:9205, full:true"]
Reviving this old thread since I hijacked another thread with slide puck talk. I'm awaiting getting a Raptor 2, but really want to have the option to use a slide puck on my remote hand. Looks like there are a few options here and then someone pointed out one on the Carvon website:
https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/655/566/b9e8afc745f5ab1a5705e3897119738e_original.gif?w=680&fit=max&v=1488179275&auto=format&gif-q=50&q=92&s=5736e8539861025ab043d2def97d27e0
https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/655/436/8604bb022d16d466b2f89f6e2a4eb467_original.jpg?w=680&fit=max&v=1488178084&auto=format&q=92&s=0fadfa636def17772e611d75bffc4871

I'm still not sold on this answer. Ideally, I'd like to take a standard remote and put a screw input (like on the bottom of a camera) on the bottom of it. Then use a slide puck mounted on a screw to attach to the bottom of it. I'd have to change my slide technique to be the bottom of my fist rather than the palm of my hand, but it seems like the best combination of maintaining remote function and usability of the slide puck. 

Someone mentioned that the vibration of the puck will create issues when connected directly to the remote. Anyone have more details on this? Also interested in other solutions out there.

is the puck for protection if you fall or do people actually slide on their eboard? seems a hinderance.   my wheels are so sticky I can barely slide and not something I try to do.  I've got brakes.  but i'm not satisfied with my remote though and liken it to playing grand theft auto with a Nintendo knob

83mm flywheels in 81a classic isn't to bad to slide on...but everything else is pretty shitty if it's bigger

So a standard oldschool mountaintbike glove for that price?! No thank you. Anyone who put their hands down on pavement at 40+ won't consider this glove. Or am I wrong?  

I use normal slide gloves. With a puck in 3 pieces in the remote hand to be able to grab it and a zipitie thingy that u use for your skiing ticket for when I need said hand and need to let go of the remote.

Am I the only one using wrist guards with these things? 

Been only riding pneumatics so far, so not much use for slide gloves. Think I'll have to rely on the bush method if my brakes fail, either that or use my helmet as a slide puck.

So what happens when you're approaching a red light and your brakes fail? Or the board gets stuck on full auto? Happened to me. The slide puck and a heelside shutdown slide saved me from going to the hospital 

Most people don't slide their e-board because they don't know how. Flat out. A lot of these guys can't even push a normal board.   Not trying to be an elitist, but it's true 

75A Flywheels slide fine. A little choppy until broken-in

actually I'm always trying to slide for fun.  What happens why I lose brakes or get stuck at full throttle?, which has also happened to me, I try to run it off and get hurt.    When I just fall off I don't get hurt.

looking for video of 80duro kegels sliding is hard to find.

4000$  
that's what I'd use those gloves for
I don't ride with gloves except sometimes thin cotton.   want to have best control of remote.   I get lucky and always slide on my forearm and always wear long sleeves if not two layers.  no shorts ever

Someone on these forums uses Knox Orsa gloves and he's able to slide a bit on the pieces that are suppose to provide scaphoid protection. However....the esk8 versions look a bit cheap compared to their motorcycle-centered counterparts.

Can somebody point me out on the material used on pucks ? Is it some Teflon compound ?

Edit : Someone should list the mainstream remotes w/ their sizes and weight, would be helpful. And thanks to Cobber, so it is delrin compound !

EditÂ² : @mmaner I found your thread from a while : 

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/remotes-commercially-available-options/15162

Is it possible when you get time that you update your first post with sizes for each (and include the Mini, the Benchweel and the OLED remotes) ? Sorry for the bother, but at least your thread has good info on that !

I used to sell slide pucks made of UHMW-PE, Delrin, and Delrin-AF (embedded with teflon)

Go with UHMW for e-skate. Lighter, much cheaper, and lasts forever.  Delrin is great for tech sliding because it slides faster. But it's denser and you need smooth roads, or it gets torn up quick. The green pucks I posted above are made from UHMW

Or the DIY cheap approach is to go to Home Depot and get some free Corian samples (used for tiling your bathroom). Cuttingboard works too but doesn't last long

Sector 9 lightning, more form fitting leather no wrist support. Easier to manipulate throttle as it's like a 2nd skin fit.
