Hi, there! :upside_down_face:
This is my first post here so...
First of all, I want to thank Benjamin Vedder for his great project and @Onloop for this kind place.
Also great thanks to @WhitePony for his very detailed and helpful build process posts.
And all of you, guys, for that large community.

Now, closer to the topic...
I spent some time to realize my friend's idea of underbody synchronized lighting,
it's hard to explain and better to see once than read a hundred times.

**don't forget to set stepdown converter to +5volts**

I have a WS2812strip...looks like I'm going to have to grab an apa102 one instead.

Is the strip sealed, and if so where did you get it?

[/quote]
At first I tried to accomplish this project with ws2812, but it's too slow because this strip is very time dependent - ws2812 library disables interrupts to write to the strip and enables it back, so with uart interrupts this all takes too much time... I dont say this is impossible, but sure, to get it work you will need to write your own libraries on vanilla C. One for Arduino uart setup and communication and second for updating ws2812 strip, so I decided that I don't want to waste time on this. :sweat_smile:

Opened a new sketch, then copied the contents of main.cpp into it.  Saved the sketch.

Moved the folders in /lib to the arduino library folder, then had to install the fastgpio and the apa102 libraries.

compiled OK.  need to test tomorrow.

Quick questions!

Your picture his the plug going into the debug header, but shouldn't it be going into the uart header?

I have yet to play with @Ackmaniac's firmware and an HM10 module, but I think using the UART port will make users choose one or the other.  Can this firmware simply sniff the green Tx line for state changes if a bluetooth module is installed?

/edit

How could I add a second strip - one on each side of the board - that have duplicate functionality?

Ah... You right, the picture was wrong! Shame on me) I corrected this. Thank you.

The best option to work with bluetooth module and arduino on the same VESC uart is take arduino with two uarts. And connect arduino to VESC uart and bluetooth module to second uart of arduino, but this will need some code rework.

To add second APA102 led strip just connect it in parallel with first one to the **d11** and **d12** and **gnd** arduino pins(You, also, will need second LM2596HVS converter for second strip because one of this can take only 3A current.)

OK!  So I got this up and running last night.  Works great!

Some notes:

1) I went and [zipped up the sketch and libraries](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6yPgtXXa9tXV0UzUWdIRGJ5MDhsdmFMSkMxd2NpU0lJZ2cw/view?usp=sharing).  Simply upload this zip file to the on-line arduino IDE, [Arduino Create](https://create.arduino.cc/).  Should compile right away and the FASTGPIO and APA102 libraries are already available.  Works great and web access is nice!

2) My arduino pro mini would not upload when connected to the TxRx of the VESC, even with the VESC powered down.  I had to break these connections to get it to upload.  Not the end of the world, just something to be mindful of.

3) I had trouble getting the police_pallete to work.  My LED strip is 29 modules long, so I changed             
         'static const uint16_t CURRENT_PALLETE_WIDTH =29;'  I modified police_pallete too.

      const hsv_color police_pallete[80] PROGMEM = {
      0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
      0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 240, 240, 240, 240, 240,
      240, 240, 240, 240, 240, 240, 240, 240, 240, 240,
   };
It works well now.  
RESPECT MAH AUTHORITAH!
![identities-cop-cartman|690x388](upload://7Db0KqvYuyTXK8509CT3nzQLNRL.jpg)
Should CURRENT_PALLETE_WIDTH = LED_COUNT?

Also, I had a thought about how to avoid using UART entirely.  Could we attach the output of two of the motor hall sensors to INT0/1 to get the motor position? This might mess with FOC, but I'd bet that it wouldn't.

You don't need to set **CURRENT_PALLETE_WIDTH** to **LED_COUNT**.
**CURRENT_PALLETE_WIDTH** must be equal to pallete elements, for example, if you want to create new pallete with 3 elements:
const hsv_color pallete_name[3] PROGMEM = { 0, 240, 0 };
or
const hsv_color another_pallete_name[6] PROGMEM = { 0, 240, 0, 240, 0, 240, };
so **CURRENT_PALLETE_WIDTH** must be equal to number in **[ ]** brackets and count of values in **{ }** brackets. :slight_smile:

Instead of this set **#define LED_COUNT** to number of leds on your strip(in **led_strip_apa102.h** file). And don't forget change **#define LED_STRIP_BRIGHTNESS** to **31** in the same file.

That's interesting idea, man, I think it's possible, but only for sensored motors :roll_eyes:

Do you have single motor board?

Also, are you using old firmware on your VESC?
I'm asking, because I tried to use HM-10 bluetooth module(with many apps at google play) and can't get any data back, because of outdated protocol I think...

p.s. Could you, please, record a video? I have too many snow on the streets in my country now, so I can't get joy of this.:sweat_smile:

It just snowed here last night, so ice and salt and water everywhere.  :(  

I can take a quick vid of it on the bench in my disaster of an office/workshop.

I'll play with the settings tonight and document what I do and how it works.

I'm running the lastest vesc firmware from vedder - I need to dig out my HM10 module and flash the ackmaniac FW and see if I can get it working.

Yeah, sensored motors only, but I'm running @12S and the cord is just dangling there.

I already have a script running that reads a button press on channel 3.  Hoping to use a button press to turn the lights on and off as I don't want them on during the day.

I bet we could attach channel 2 to to INT1 and get throttle position, but that would eat up all the hardware interrupts and I'm thinking that reading hall sensors is the way to go to get around UART.

Here's the script:

#define BUTTON_SIGNAL_IN 0 
#define BUTTON_SIGNAL_IN_PIN 2
#define NEUTRAL_BUTTON 1500
volatile int nButtonIn = NEUTRAL_BUTTON;
volatile unsigned long ulStartPeriod = 0;
volatile boolean bNewButtonSignal = false;

void setup()
{
  attachInterrupt(BUTTON_SIGNAL_IN,calcInput,CHANGE);
  Serial.begin(9600); 
}

void loop()
{
 if(bNewButtonSignal)
 {
   if(nButtonIn > 1500){
   Serial.println("ON");
   }
   else{
   Serial.println("OFF");
   }
   bNewButtonSignal = false;
 }
}

void calcInput()
{
  if(digitalRead(BUTTON_SIGNAL_IN_PIN) == HIGH)
  { 
    ulStartPeriod = micros();
  }
  else
  {
    if(ulStartPeriod && (bNewButtonSignal == false))
    {
      nButtonIn = (int)(micros() - ulStartPeriod);
      ulStartPeriod = 0;
      bNewButtonSignal = true;
    }
  }
}

I was actually just thinking, why not use ppm for everything? And/or why not put a sensor on the Arduino to sense the road moving by or motor/wheel spin? Can be vesc/ESC independent then
```

## \#34 Posted by: akhlut Posted at: 2018-02-03T15:34:18.354Z Reads: 195

```
Essentially yes.  We want to see what the motor or wheels are doing so that the lights are synched to the actual motion of the board.  Polling the VESC via UART gives that, but there are other ways of getting that info.

I think that reading a hall sensor is most likely the easiest way as the motors have the hardware built-in and the VESC is simply reading the values.  If we can sniff a single hall line we should be able to determine the RPM of the motor without interfering with FOC.  

I'm thinking of making a PCB to knit all these ideas together for testing.

Wouldn't reading the ppm be kind of easier.  Just use a y servo cable to split the signal to vesc and arduino. Maybe drop an optocoupler before getting to the arduino to be safe. Arduino already has libraries to read the servo signal
That's what I was planning on doing on the future at least

You're pulling the ground from the same battery ground as the vesc, right? so there's still a common ground there with the battery to filter it.

I'm making it as plugnplay as possible to any existing setup, don't have to mess with the board battery or anything just plug in uart and go
With a switch on the battery, could even be a ppm controlled switch and use your remote for on/off

no, you need arduino with vesc common ground to get right uart signals.

You can use ttp223 sensor module in switch mode(with mosfet) on battery enclosure for this or even try to use it through deck ;)

@ju_mpe_r

changing the led direction of travel...

_color_shifting.cpp_
_#include "color_shifting.h"_
_#include "led_strip_apa102.h"_
_#include "color_palletes.h"_



_extern "C" {_
_#include "vesc_uart.h"_
_};_



_void update_strip_colors(void) {_
_uint32_t current_tacho_value;_
_uint32_t pallete_travel;_
_current_tacho_value = bldc_get_tachometer_value();_
_pallete_travel = current_tacho_value / WHEEL_SIZE_RATIO;_
_for (uint8_t i; i < LED_COUNT; i++) {_
_led_strip_colors[i] = get_pallete_color(pallete_travel  + i);_
_}_
_update_strip();_
_}_

Just change 
    **led_strip_colors[i] = get_pallete_color(pallete_travel  + i);**
to
    **led_strip_colors[i] = get_pallete_color(pallete_travel  - i);**

You can try it but I dont recommend it, maybe it can work well but the main problem is that the vesc isnt capable of supplying a lot of juice from his 5v port.

I know someone that blew his vesc because he had too big of a light connected to his vesc so maybe try to find another solution (iknow its probably hard)

Do you have experience with Arduino coding? I know that the Unity has a different response for the COMM_GET_VALUES UART command, so though I'm not completely familiar with how the code for this is written i would bet that you need to change how the data from that packet is parsed (which bytes are stored in which variables)

No problem :) after taking a look at the code, it looks like you can update which bytes are taken from a COMM_GET_VALUES packet in the "bldc_interface.c" file of the VESC UART library used. Look at the "bldc_interface_process_packet" function. Just check what bytes are sent by the Unity by looking at the "commands.c" file of enertion's unity FW and update them accordingly :slight_smile:
