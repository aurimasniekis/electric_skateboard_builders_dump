Moving away from hummie's thread.

Afaik NESE is the only high preformance non solder battery pack in the market. I do agree that it is a good design and he has put in a lot of effort to ensure it's safety. Not to say that it's full of flaws, but there are a few things I would like to improve on:
1. Cost 
    * It's kind of expensive. **€103.35** for a 10s4p module to ship to the US
2. Size
    * it got that extended part for screws terminals. I don't see it as a necessity. It adds length to the whole P group and IMO length is pretty important since most battery packs are made laying the 18650s along the length of the deck
    

With that in mind changing these are my design principle:
1. Low Cost
2. Easily mass produced and distributed
3. Compact

See picture below. This is a prototype 12s4p pack with:
* 3d printed PETG
* Secured solely with simple hardware (M3)
* 0.6x10mm copper (6mm^2 cross section, basically 10 guage wire) 
* Pressed copper strip for cell terminal isolation
* 4mm gaps between series (2x 2mm cell holder wall all around)
* U-shaped wiring

* Round corners
* 1mm space for folding copper and balance wire
* more polygons for aesthetic 

V0.1 (~73x78x24mm)

So these are able to safely draw roughly about equal amount of amps as a nese module seeing as you're using the same copper/hardware? not sure how much of a difference in measurements the tabs are between the two. I recall nese doing about 200a or something like that

Just a thought: spacing the cells further apart would make the P group larger but you could move the bolts inline. Would give you a slimmer pack (at the obvious expense of a wider pack) but also give the cells some "air" to dissipate heat better (just like the regular 18650 holders one can buy).
If you shrinkwrap the metal nut you could position it directly between two cells.

I did considered that. I favored the current design over because I think the limiting factor of battery size is it's length rather than height. You can't pack as many in if you bolt it inline also you will need to make a hole on the copper strip so the bolt don't short the 2 sides

Try to find one locally and try to become acquainted with him/her there are many people who have a printer but don't utilize them that much or only sporadically.

Many of these ppl like to sare there experiences and often the hardware, too. It will be a huge gain to actually see a running printer and failed prints to improve your own knowledge.
If he/her is a good guy he can give you leftovers or parts that might help you. 


Overall I recommend personal experiences first, you will learn and improve your designs faster it is also the best way to evaluate to buy one yourself or if 3dprinting services are enough for your usecase.


You can probably find such people with 3dprinting related subreddits, 3dprint service sites (these where everyone can offer a service) or even FB (there are a few 3dprinting groups most often related to specific printers).

Whoops I thought that was to me. 

I want to eventually do injection molding. To get a good print of these takes way too long. cura quoted 30+ Hr for a 12s4p set at 100% infill, 0.2 layer height. And you all know cura estimate is bullshit. My CR-10 can't handle petg at 0.3. Or I haven't found a good setting for 0.3. (talking about v0.1 haven't printed any of the new one yet)

Yeah I guess you also got a spot welder and then decided it's not worth the time. I have the Korean boss spot welder too but I still don't trust myself even through I spam welded and triple plated my pack. The welds disintegrated after a few rides on my first pack attempt, kapton tape and paper ring saved my ass. So I spam welded my current one.

I really like these, mainly on the cost side and size, that’s what put me off using NESE, but a few thoughts 

As I understand there is nothing between the cooper strip and the 3D printed case right? Every polymer relax with time, even more with heat, what may be compressed today can be completely loose in a year, it’s worse from the outer cells that’s don’t have two screws holding

Also, I would highly recommend going 4 screws even if it’s more expensive, maybe to screw one side and nut on the other. There is some large brass screws that can go from on side to the other, that for the same reason, with relaxation the modules will twist and you would end up with a really small contact área 

Back to the compression strip, @agniusm went really far to find a material that would keep the pressure really well after a long time, I don’t remember if he ever said what it is since that the secret of his modules, it’s worth take a look

Besides that I think it’s has a lot o potential 

Good luck

another idea: instead of a nickel strip make it fit an 10AWG wire with the insulation removed and the insulation still there between groups - that way you could build an entire pack by chaining them together and they'd be flexible in between individual P groups.

The size difference is 0.141L per 4P nese vs 0.136L 4p here if i am not mistaken through a quick browse.
Nese has exposed terminals so wiring bms and in general is more convenient. I had to design it so its easy to use even for a first time builder.
Regarding price i wont denie that ita on the expensive side but considering that the hardware is not off the hardware store shelve and demand is limited due to the size of the nishe market. As I invested a lot of my personal money and time I want to be able to earn a little from this venture. I do try to have stuff available for people to dowbload and diy for free if they wish and have many photos tests end expanations posted if someone cares about that (it was discused on material used for compresion) but i cant support diy'ers explaining each in detail how to make it themselves for free, mainly cause of lack of time. I always salute new ideas like this.
Compression is always underlooked so my advise would be to investigate that. Vruzend did not put too much thought into it and i lt would be good to see othewise.

Look at Nickel Plated Spring Steel, its what battery holders in all battery operated devices use for compression terminals. Ive used them myself on other projects. You can get off the shelf ones called keystone terminals, they work extremely well on 3d parts, they are just a little expensive.

Now I am thinking, why not use the copper braids all the way. Have channels in @Winfly's holders to keep the copper braids secured. Where the braid would meet the battery, make the plastic a bit raised, to enable good connection and not touch the perimeter. There would be no need to stamp copper or anything. Super DIY. The size of the braided copper determines the current :D.
The 3/8th inch one I am using is 10 Gauge, I think.

Nonsense, you only have to read the various datasheets to know this is not true. They come in a huge array of sizes and ratings, or you can make your own. No vibration will be able to pry away the chunky spring steel clips i use for my 26850s, it takes considerable force just getting them in. For the record i like the nese design, its simple, effective and pretty fool proof. However there are other options for creative individuals.:yum:

Its not the springiness but rather increased heating if they are underreated which causes termal expantion and contraction. You can seize everything but compared to copper it probably be 5 x over in size cause of conductivity

Parameter you are looking at in this situation is compression set. Basically material is squeezed for certain time period in elevated temperature. Then released and measured what procentage in height it recovered to.

Ok, thanks for everyone's feedback. 

These are the thing I'm gona try out: 
* Nylon hardware
* Smaller footprint
* (Tinned) copper braid
* More hardware. Trying out 3 before 4.

[quote="Winfly, post:1, topic:67878"]
NESE is the only high preformance non solder battery pack in the market and there are many thing I don’t like about it.

1. Cost - literally it’s a monopoly
2. Location - he’s based in EU so shipping will cost even more money
3. Size - it’s huge, it got that extended part for screws terminals, and it’s fully enclosed. In Eskate everyone uses an enclosure anyways there’s no necessity to enclose the whole pack.
[/quote]

1. You can print modules yourself, diy series tabs and get bolts at local hardware store. Tabs for 10S4P would cost you 30.30EUR including shipping.
2. Total nonsense. Example above would cost you 7.7EUR to ship from EU to States. USPS would charge you  7.10USD for Priority Mail 3-Day™ Regional Rate Box A (Shipping inside US). Not much of a difference, hu?
3. As mentioned in another thread, you save 40 milliliters or 1.35 ounces of volume per your design.
What you gain is:
a. Far more DIY and time involved building a battery
b. Greater risk of thermal if cells get loose without using any compression material
c. No easy way to transport up to 100WH on a plane.
It is one thing to design something and use it yourself, than design something to be safe to sell.
If i were you, i would rather ask someone with experience, or someone who done something similar for insights and advice, than jump discarding everyone and assuming or thinking you can do a lot better on your spare time ;)

I actually just get the tabs and they are pretty inexpensive given the quality. I buy the 5 tabset, enough for 10S4P for about $31(including shipping). Everything else you can buy for peanuts. Of course this all makes sense if you have access to a 3D printer.

When you see assembled modules bursting into flames every few weeks and on the other hand there are videos of these modules pushing 200A even when under vibration, it is kinda weird to be dismissive about these modules.

My price is a monopoly? WTF does that even mean? When you buy cells, do they cost the same? Or perhaps more power dense ones are more expensive? The price reflects product. If you dont spend much time and finances in developing it, it might be cheap but it will most definetely be worse.

I think he should add something that will be the compression material and not using the 3D print plastic. Foam. A reliable compressible 
On endless sphere people showed using thinner copper and stacking it showed better contact and less resistance than one thick copper contact. 

There’s a lot of people who are doing well using magnets on the terminals to get compression.  The magnets are somewhat conductive plated in copper n nickel but it’s pretty thin and people use copper foil layers between the cell n magnets.

So I did a thing. CADding bug bit me hard today and thought of completing 1 more thing. I had the NESE tabs lying around so thought why not try out a @Winfly style 4P pack just for fun. I intend to use just braided copper directly without using tabs at all but that's for next weekend maybe. So here's what I got. It's the same height as NESE btw(22mm). I think, I stayed true to how @agniusm  designed NESE and combined it with Winfly's idea.

Nice Rendering. Tips: if you are using strips, since it's rigid, you can fillet the corner instead of rounding the ends. That way the 3d printed piece will be have more volume and thus stronger layer adhesion. I've cracked a few by over tightening it and it always splits along the opening for the copper strip to pass through.

I guess that is to be seen. The same will hold in my setup too. Thankfully my board is not too flexible. But it will be interesting to see how long it lasts. Even when it breaks it won't happen suddenly. If you open the enclosure every 2 weeks or so, you should be able to see it start to fray(if at all it does that)

Yeah thats the worst case I was thinking of as well. but maybe it just may not happen if the flex is minimal like on the Hummie decks that it wouldn't fatigue it all that much. Good question is how to accurately test it in a controlled environment I suppose

Edit:
Or I just test out the long term stress myself once these become available :laughing:

So, this is an upgrade(I think) on the previous design in the way that:
1. I get to fix the distance between the side pieces. So no more over tightening and cracking of the plastic
2. The standoffs were kind of hard to grab on to and would spin when I tighten the screws. 
3. It has two mounting holes.

The total volume for printing these is 20,000mm^3 where as NESE is about 90,000mm^3 if I am not mistaken. I would imagine these could be more useful when people want to save a little more on 3D printing are not afraid of soldering. The series connections has to be soldered, ideally with a super flexible wire. 

I'll be putting these10S4P module on a new board, lets see how it fares.

these are goofy bad pics but instead of having to solder on wires for flex between the groups of four the method in these pics is just a bend of the copper that can go down the length of the cell a couple cm and then back up to the other group and leaves a lot of material to bend.  with this method, if it were to last, you'd need no soldering except the start and end of the 12s chain.   I don't know how long until the copper would finally harden and break and never made these to test.   couldn't find any better pics!   and you can see theres a "guard" going down the length of the cell were the copper bends

and was just going to use nitrile high heat rubber bands for compression which I think is maybe a safer method than even the nese now that I see how little foam is used in those.

for the copper it takes so long to oxidize and especially with the contact to the cell having slight friction I doubt it would have a problem not being plated and you can get bare sheet easily and cut and press it with 3dprints easily.

layers of thin stuff were shown to have less resistance with better conforming contact on the cells than thick non conforming stuff.  so easy to work with the thin stuff

plating with tin is easy and theres also some other easier coating method I found that doesn't add resistance but stops oxidation forget what it was, some dip.   I have rolls of copper from years ago look as good as new though

How did you trap the copper tabs inside the plastic? Or is it a 2 piece design?

You and @Winfly have the same idea and I love it. I think @hummie teased about this first and then Winfly made an entire pack?

Well, I am using @agniusm's tabs with measurements from N.E.S.E design, because they are superb quality and readily available. I don't want to cut and stamp copper myself without proper tools.

yea the copper is trapped between the outer and inner parts.  the inner also has the guard going down the side. 

its so easy to stamp and cut.  I put the copper between two prints, press it, and trim the outside of the 3d prints and they work as a cutting template too.  

yea winfly got me back into it by actually doing it!   but we're both working on another version in the deck I sell.  so solving the mounting of the pack as well.  why not.  using foam for compression.

I don’t really see how that idea with the copper could work. The boards we use flex in the other direction (lengthwise) having the copper in that orientation as soon as the board flexes either the copper will be pulled out from some of the modules or it will twist and break.

It would need to be orientated the other way which would increase size a lot and make the connection almost impossible

I'm not quite sure what thats meant to represent but its the same principle. the cardboard will not bend or flex when it is in the orientation that our batteries are on our decks. If you sit the cardboard up so it is perpendicular to the ground like our nickel/copper strips sit and then try to make it flex/bend the direction that longboard decks do you will see what I mean.

the pic of the cardboard with the bend in it can bend in the other plane.  if it were stood up, as typical for the batteries on a board, it can do the bend with the deck.  the other pic of cardboard without the bend wont be able to bend in the middle in the same direction

easiest would be not soldering and just a bend between the packs of four, if it doesn’t break.  If it’s two packs of four with just the bend between then only have to solder to the start n end of the pack

I personally don’t think it’s that hard to solder a few wires to tabs. You would have to maybe make 20 connections and it might take you 1 hour to do so, but then your pack can flex any direction with out any wear and without the worry of fatigue

Simiply put, a good solder joint for a 10 guage wire to a copper strip takes up space. That's why I'm considering using the braided copper. I do concern about the copper fatigue over time but without further testing, we cant shoot out folding copper strip as a valid series connection.

With sufficient compression it would not budge even when I pull on it really hard. I'm testing how much my 3d printed parts can compress and how much tension it can hold before they crack.
As for broken lose strand, I ordered some 4s barley paper rings for the terminals and will probably make covers for between the rings and the holder. Honestly it's compressed and braided so tight i doubt it would even have the slightest room for the strand to move inside.

I just use the same compression as given in N.E.S.E modules. I don't have to worry about that since they are tested well. What I am concerned about is how well the plastic threads will hold over time under force and at elevated temperature. I used ABS, so it should be a bit better.

While I was assembling it, I was kinda annoyed that even with the improvements, I had to be careful about the torque, making sure the threads are not stripped etc. Some surface needed sanding to sit flat. It took me quite some time to assemble 9 modules. I now appreciate how convenient the N.E.S.E modules are, having assembled them both. On top of that, to replace cells, when they get old, I have to go through the whole process again with my modules. Is it worth saving a bit of plastic? I don't know. 

BTW, can't decide what's the best way to arrange these modules. Bottom one looks more compact whereas the top one is like @Winfly's original layout.  @uigiroux was wondering about that in the N.E.S.E thread.  I'll be soldering braided copper between the modules.

How about like this? You'd flip every other pack so that positive ends are facing each other. Now you could connect the terminals with short wires on the sides.

stronger = yes probably
but need these to be that strong? After all they only need to hold the compression, tbf the weak point on the prints is the layer adhesion (print orientation and optimizations will improve them)

quicker = I don't think so, the design is not 100% 2.5d so a completly milled version (awith the way cheaper and common portal style mill) would need some work (or be splitted and glued) after it's milled (cutouts for the busbars/cabels/taps).
The preparation for milling and speed isn't that faster either. 

And after all this milling needs way more material and the machines are even less available than printers. 
Sure milled would work, printing should work also but over all the best solution (with appropriate demand) would be injection molding: simple parts fast to produce, as strong as milled, low amounts of trash and good surface finish and precision

When I say milled I'm talking about getting some long square plastic stock and using a drill stand.
You could mark it out and drill pilot holes, then slowly step up the drill size till you have an 18.5mm recess for each battery. Using Forstner bits would give a flat bottom then you just need to cut a slot for the braid to be inserted.

It would take a while but doable.

@mishrasubhransu said he'll be soldering braided copper between the modules. To me this means that the packs should be able to flex which is not accomplished by soldering rigid terminals directly to each other.

Also to get the terminals coming out on the opposite side I imagine he should redesign, reprint and reassemble multiple packs which he said to be pain in the ass.

My original design has terminal opening on both sides. But why do you want both sides to be open? for a series connection you only really need one opening. I closed it to add strength and better isolation between S when putting them side by side.



As for being pain in the ass to assemble. yes if you rely on thread onto the 3d printed holes it will take forever to screw on 8x12S screws without a power tool. I've been though that :joy:. to fix that I'm going to make larger hole for screws to push though, shorter screws and longer standoff and make the model the exact height such that when the standoff completely meet both side of the holders. it will be the optimal compression s.t. you don't have to guess how far to compress it. (RIP sourcing parts from china and it's taking forever to get here.)

Also i find that with standoff, once you have assembled it once, it's really easy to unthread and take it off. All you have to do is loosen one end and you can easily rotate the standoff with your thumb. unfortunately that won't be possible with the longer standoff as mentioned above.

The reason to have the tabs on both sides should be obvious I thought...  With the NESE Modules, I got 6 of the 2s4p modules, but only use one of them as that.  I have one 2s4p and five 4p +4p (cut the copper tab in half).  Each module holds eight cells, I put four cells one orientation and the other for the opposite, so from one side I can connect the series tabs for 4p, run it up one side starting to the 2s4p module, then end up at the first module for both terminals.  Basically this allows you to use half the modules you normally would need to, so it is more convenient IMO.

I actually have holes on both side. It will be a matter of disassembling them and flipping into the orientation required. Right now they are configured for the axis of the cells to be perpendicular to lenght of the board. 

I guess the orientation would depend on how much space you have. If you are using 5P, then no way it's going to fit in hummies deck when the axis of the cell is parallel to lenght of board.

I don't think I am happy with this. Lots of wasted space. I could definitely reprint and rearrange them to reduce space but I don't think it is worth it. But I'll continue to use it until something breaks then shift to N.E.S.E.

@Winfly 's or @Hummie 's design makes perfect sense when decks have cutouts, for flat deck, you need some sort of legs and that reduces space. Might as well go with N.E.S.E, as changing cells is very easy. I am going to stop working on this and wait to see what Winfly or Hummie come up with. 

What do you guys think?

This is what you need https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0779N142T for securing nicely in the plastic.

Also, you had asked about the pack dimension(along length of cell), well mine should be 71 according to design, but is 71.5 in reality. Since the slot in hummie's deck is 74mm wide you will have enough space to accommodate these hex screws.  The height of module is 22mm. Distance between cells is 18.3(because of N.E.S.E tabs)

Have you considered printing the raised part in TPU, as a separate part? That way the braided part has some springiness to it when contacting the cell terminals? Did I make sense? Else I can cad it up.

As promise there's the big update:

Didn't know that there are different thickness of copper braid. I bought some 1.2mm and 0.3mm thick braid.

* 0.3mm - Seller list it as rated for 40A (right)
* 1.2mm - no rating available (left)
![image|250x250](upload://tpgchEcYutXVE9WN2cEujPxNKUj.jpg) ![image|333x250](upload://gli62qYqYeE0fYDldUKVxDxf7yA.jpeg) 

Since the thicker braid came first, I did measurement changes tailor to it so when the nylon standoff meets the cell holder on both sides it has a right amount of compression and not damage the 3d print.
![image|345x170](upload://uVjpBZKmvzjnk5KxEaAn2pUabgt.jpeg) 
you can kind of see the circular deformation at the top formed by the terminal buttons. This way there's enough compression on the battery terminals without weakening the integrity of the cell 

Testing with the thicker braid was pretty straight forward. This test is mainly for measuring the temperature of the copper braid during high continuous discharge to ensure it doesnt get too hot for PETG (80C glass temperature). The test was conducted on a 4p Samsung 30Q pack with thick copper braid (fully charged to 4.2V) with 10 gauge wire soldered to the ends of the braid. Using a 240W DC load, I drew constant current 20A, 40A, 60A (maximum of the DC load) for a few minutes while monitoring the temperature of the braid, closest to the opening of the cell holder and the batteries, with a IR thermometer gun. 

The result is very optimistic. At the end of 60A constant current draw, Battery temperature was at 50C, while the braid only reached about ~40C. I also did a good old touch test to confirm that the braid was colder than the batteries.
This video didnt capture everything but you will get the gist of it 
https://youtu.be/gQc3b2ZQ9rI

Since the measurements are tailor to the thicker braid and it pass the test by very large margin. I will keep the current version and test the thinner braid later when I have time.

Nice test. nice clean fingernails 

You think repeatedly getting the prints to an increased temp but still below the glass tradition temp could warp the print and relieve the compression?  Be cool to see a repeated test and somehow gauge the compression after.  Maybe just ride it and see if the resistance is increasing beyond what the little amount the cells would increase

Damn that's some nice gear! So jelly.

My 2 cents. I think electrically everything is up to and beyond specs. The unknowns are the mechanical properties, especially under tension, heat and vibration, over time.

The test is awesome though!

EDIT for grounding braid wire, I find mcmaster has a nice list with specs, and decent prices.

Whoops I typed this out but never hit reply.

I was doing the test at a electronics lab on college campus. I wish I have all that stuff. I want to test mechanical properties as well. If you guys knows how I can test that I'll do it. I love McMaster but they don't have the right 3/8" ~10mm and a good thickness available. Their price aren't always the best for uncommon items and they use the fastest shipping and then slap you with the shipping cost after.

@Hummie  I should dig deeper for PETG spec. I choose petg bc it has higher glass temperature that PLA and more flexible than ABS, which help with compression. Im not entire sure about repeated heat under glass temp damages the integrity of the shape. Not to mention that I did the test at 60A and I believe a normal load on battery is about 15-30a continuous on a dual setup and peaks to whatever your max Batt Amp is when you acelerate.

I can put together a pack with already dead cells and do a few heat cycles in a toaster oven.

Update 11/21/18:
1. Real life testing
   * I have been using the current design for the past few weeks in my 13s Hummie Build. Although I'm typically only ride on BaeSk8 group rides, our group ride can get quite intensed if you are at the front of the pack pushing 28mph uphill and doing 30+ on flats. and going up Twin peak at full throttle. 

    * there are section with repeated cement gaps and rough street, also I rode on a already terrible road and there was hella small rocks(probably fell of some truck that day) to the group ride. So if your cell holders are properly padded they have no problem dealing with vibration. 

    * [[usable telemetry files]](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1YfvfiD9UgCy46kE4KA4qzKzUb7JWaq4N?ogsrc=32) (if you wanna throw some metr module at me, you will get better telemetry)

![image|690x320](upload://lMoB2VBfDtwsd3wkSPcEEI1tExD.png) 

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-hummie-beast-hummie-wood-carbon-deck-hummie-v4-diy-enclosure-13s4p-compression-pack-2x-fsesc6-6-diy-nano-x-mod/73231?u=winfly

2. Beta Testing
    *  We have a few beta tester signed up for testing the current design with copper braid. as you read, these copper braid is way over spec our application and iti will stay this way. I am printing out single stack, 2s modules and stagger stack modules for these guys. 

   * I'm confident in the compression and safety, but I know these will take a bit longer than NESE to assemble and would like to hear what they think about the process of putting them together. I'm trying to make these as noob friendly as possible so if you can follow instruction you an build a pack.

3. Since I already have all the dimension nailed down. it's quite easy for me to populate all the configurations you will ever want.
    * single stack, aligned double stack, stagger stack
![image|200x250](upload://d1rXy39Y2YYBzN5F8t6Rup06oCP.jpeg) ![image|324x250](upload://q7yT1CPpmfD4DeEM1QVwCiYp3Dg.jpeg) (upload://d1rXy39Y2YYBzN5F8t6Rup06oCP.jpeg) 
      * Aligned stack has additional standoff in the middle for more compression while stagger stack trim the height from 41mm to 39.5mm 

    * keep it under 99Wh. multiple S modules. (single stack, double stack however you want)
      * e.g. 2s4p 30Qs is  86.4Wh

4. Working on improving modularity
    * I'm looking to use ring connector in the next iterations to improve modularity. idea is to quickly connect/disconnect module by loosening the one end of the module and inserting ring connector crimped to the positive sided braid around the first terminal button of negative side of next module
      * pic > words ![image|690x155](upload://oqA2bAjchyrZXuVfLnz8EBCb9Ge.jpeg) 
    * **NEW IDEA!!!!!!!!!**

      * Forgot to charge your short deck? Not enough range and want more fun?
        * Introducing 1 piece small swappable packs at 10s2p 12s2p or similar sizes.
      * Idea is to have Interlocking cell holders to form a small rigid pack. will be vulnerable to impact cus you will be carrying it around. so material and encasement will be explored. still in very early phase

5. Gauging size of market interest and demand for scalability
    * I need to know how many people are interested in using these cell holders instead of NESE or spot welding services? A set of 12s4p (using 2s4p modules) took about 18 hrs to print at the moment and nowhere scalable with 3d printing. If there's enough demand, I will make a silicone mold or even design something for injection molding for large quantities.

    * **Pricing:** i'm figuring out how much I should price these things and where they are placed in the battery market. 

      * here are some pros and cons I came up with. please open to discuss about the current state of design:
[quote="Winfly, post:269, topic:73363"]
Cell Holder vs DIY Spot welding

Pros

* for one timer, saving on expensive spotwelder
* Simple to assemble
  * Don’t need to do research about spot welding technique
  * Don’t need to source nickel strip
* Modular-“ish” as of now for air travel
* Easy to upgrade/downgrade #S
* Cost less? 
* (future) Swappable pack.

Cons

* It’s “not as conductive” as spot welding
* takes some time to assemble for the first time
* need some confidence and some electrical knowledge to use them
* need a power drill or you get sore arms turning that many screws
* it’s still just 3d printed so it’s gona break if you drop it while it’s under tension
[/quote]
   
AFAIK spot welding service cost about $200ish in labor. with the advantages of taking off individual cells to replace them and modularity and compactness over NESE, these cell holders I hope to price them low if I can get produced in quantity.

[poll name=poll2 type=multiple min=1 max=5 public=true]

This is what you would expect to get for a 1s4p module + the braid ofc. with the current design and it will only get better.

@Winfly I was thinking here, injection molding will be expensive for sure, what if you could do a hybrid construction? Laser cutting is pretty cheap, you could have a reinforcement stainless steel plate at each side, with some longer screws one side could be threaded to further reduce the number of components

This way the 3D printed pieces would only be used to position te cells and have the bump to guarantee the compression on the right place

Another upside is that if the steel plate thickness is calculated correctly it will be light and works as a spring, no more worrying about compression set

Thank you for your suggestions. Quite an interesting approach I didn't think of. 

I ran made a spreadsheet today to see what's the reasonable cost for everyone. I'm trying to raise fund to increase production through casting or injection molding, and support further development cost. I spent way too much money ordering the wrong stuff. 




# Initial early access offer

As of now, It will take me a day to print a set of 12s4p . That's no where close to being sustainable. Because I will still be printing these I'm doing an early cost ended up higher than I wanted to be.

Settled cost:
* $80 + shipping for 10s4p set
* $95 + shipping for 12s4p set

You will have the option of mix of 1s4p and 2s4p modules for cutomized flexibility at different part of your board. Pieces will be cleaned up, Inspected and test fitted before shipping out. 

Dimension of 1s4p module is 22h x 73w x 76l 
2s4p saves 1mm in length. Pic later.

Other configurations: 
* 1,2,3,4s  2-8p modules  
* Stagger stack
* Align stack
All available as long as it doesn't exceed 10 cells in length. Price will be figured out and discussed.

Add-ons: 
* Choices of 30Qs or VTC6
* Hex bit to save elbow grease 
*  Mini hex bit ratchet (highly recommending hand turning for finish compression. Not liable for damages caused by over compression)

Offer will be availabled once beta tester receive their units within 2 weeks and provide user feedback and pics.

### Saving you some math and comparison:
NESE 10s4p modules = 90 EURO (with 4p modules) and 84 EURO (with 2s4p).  + Shipping


# Warnning! Subjective opinion, Do **NOT** over react.
Advantages over spot welding:
* Low initial cost
  * -cost on spot welder
* Save you time and effort to
  * Research spot welding technique
  * Source material
* Modularity
  * Easy to replace cells
  * Easy to upgrade battery pack
  * (Work in progress) travel friendly. Dis assemble into smaller packs for flights
* Cost 

Disadvantages:
* Lesser conductivity between cell and busbar/braid contact (this is debatable, not going to argue.)
* Not fool proof. If you assemble wrong, you and I will be very very sad.
* Material, 3d printed part not the best at mechanical properties. That's why I'm raising money to scale up production using other manufacturing method.


Advantage over NESE: 
* shorter module length across cell diameter for more compactness
* Adjustable flexibility between modules
* Future prove as I will keep working on these and backward compactible is on the list.

Disadvantage vs NESE:
* Require a little longer and more tedious to assemble
*  can mess up you if assembled incorrectly

As for promised releasing 3d model for this project. I dont thinking this is the right time yet.
1. This is not a complicated part. Anyone with some experience in CAD can replicate it. :frowning_face: 
2. It will be a bad business strategy. I need this money to scale up to higher volume production. So quality increase and cost reduced in a long run.

I promise, once I overcome production logistics and begin higher volume production using better method. models will be available to public

## Small update 12/27/18: Connectors, Upgraded braid, Custom 4p HAYA holders, SPUD Tayto Proj, gauging interest again

### Connectors 
Finally found some Ring Connectors that is the right size so that it preserve the form factor. still need to trim the crimp length by half but this will do.

![image|123x250](upload://ncfhKqooTFpVZxMmqQ2OpVkuuZm.jpeg) ![image|345x170](upload://kahNgfREWhBmUCG56jYA7hyYAce.jpeg) 

### Solid contacts as you asked for
On the other hand. I'm getting some of these made by a copper company in china. pressed copper on both sides with braid running along the whole length. It will be nickel plated and then pressed to make the buttons for contacts. since the MOQ is high I'll only be ordering these for 4p options.
![png|690x187](upload://z1cs8pPo962rWCFK1iNaXAwsXRJ.png) 

### HAYA and HAYA only
Making Custom 4P modules for the HAYA Deck. Will be test fitted on @sofu's new acquired HAYA.
![image|270x250](upload://1oy0igPkYzhMIb9LgNTHR6xPSlj.png)

### SPUD / TAYTO Swappable battery??
i'm working on a custom enclosure with swappable battery on everyone's favorite short deck SPUD / TAYTO

12s3p
![image|375x500](upload://tyOTkXY4Xq3xnqqhnWfbksXf6Jh.jpeg) 
It's slightly angled to match the concave of the deck
![image|666x500](upload://593zdp2AXjztXo5XsuNJoAsGvFG.jpeg) 

Realized I need clearance for the kicktail to actually do anything. lmao. 12s3p is a little too big but I will still keep mine this way. maybe offering 10s3p or 12s2p in the future for the swappable to make sense. 
![image|690x340](upload://7HPQB6ZFmy7G70BGQJ9sikr3AuC.jpeg) 
Going to print a 2 piece enclosure and then either make a silicone mold or Fiberglass right on top.

### Still interested?
Since I was busy with school when I was last posted about selling them. and told everyone to hold off. how many ppl are interested to still? 
[poll type=multiple min=1 max=2 public=true]
* Didn't take my money last time, take it now (pm me)
* Interested but still waiting for more incremental improvement (lmk what you are waiting for)
[/poll]
Price chart is as such.
![image|690x278](upload://8bRRpO0JTIsX4suY6rKq1oZfJtd.png)  
  \+ $7-13 US shipping. , will figure out international shipping when you ask me
 I know I changed it a few time but this makes more sense for me.

Yeas for the raised tabs. That's what I meant by buttons for contact. It will just be a rectangular bar and pressed instead of his that matches the cell diameter, that's just not necessary and serves no purpose in power delivery. 

With that you can still loosen one module and pull it straight out. On the negative side . Will probably short the cells if you slide it over the positive side.

@DAddYE  just PM me.  

it's would be nice to give me your build list with deck and enclosure sizing so I can help you figure out how much you can cramp in there.

e.g hummie deck can do 12s4p signle stack at most and 13s4p single stack super crowded like my current build. HAYA with the new custom 4p module can probably fit 12s4p 4wd. with 4 focboxes or 6.6s. (674mm - 74*6 mm = 230mm for electronics, foc box are 65mm and 6.6s are 67mm long with the xt90 desolder from the pcb)

Well I made a mistake. Promised @Tello1969 that I'll assemble his for free because I need to take pictures to make an instruction guide. Here it is hours later. Same setup as mine, 13s4p Hummie double cutout. Split p-group at the end, 4x 2s4p at the ends, and 4x 1s4p at the middle for better flex. Additional balance wire guides. Clear wrapped VTC6. This is definitely way better assembled than mine.


1hour of wrapping VTC6 with clear heat shrink.
1hour of prep/taking pics for a ifixit style guide.
3 hours of assembly.

To be Fair, I feel like I can so a lot better to redesign and cut the assembly time shorter.

Hey @Winfly , do you have a source for the braids? I will use that to joint each P group in my new pack, but on Ali you only find a handful of vendors and most of them don't specify how wide they are

Locally I couldn't find also, maybe I have not found the right nomenclature to search for it in Portuguese

Beta Tester here. Sorry for the really late update as my build is still held up due to one issue coming up after another.This is one of the earlier iterations of the 6p stagger stacked holders. I currently have it on a 10s6p config as previously mentioned in one of @winfly's updates.

So far as a first time builder this really simplified a number of things for me. that being having to go the spot welder route which I preferred not to have to do for a number of reasons and allowing me to switch out bad cells without too much fuss.

The biggest challenge was assembling it but once done, it was just a matter of insulating the Series braids and I didn't have to worry about shorts or balance wires getting pulled out.

I unfortunately wasn't able to take photos while I was building as I wanted to focus on working on the pack. What I mean by balance wires not getting pulled out is that I soldered the balance leads under the braid so that it is squeezed between the braid and the bottom/top of the cell holder so that not only is the solder securing it there, the rest of the balance wire is tightly compressed.
![image|375x500](upload://qBpuyeQojkZpU3oHtuBAgwKHzWx.jpeg) ![image|375x500](upload://Ac7ZaCgIMqvCk49Cowwm4hlw1WO.jpeg) 

I used velcro on the 3D printed parts to secure it to the deck so no movement at all for me. It is a great fit for the widened Hummie deck and I'm pleased with how it came out. I've yet to test it during actual use but I'll be updating again once my board is rolling! Again big thanks to @winfly for allowing me to run His Cell holders on my build :smile:

Well Winfly's project started out as something that 

1. doesn't use a plastic box to maintain compression because everyone already uses as enclosure.
2. doesn't use expensive stamped and pressed copper sheet for contact.
 
but now it's both those things. It's a pretty good design( esp flexible connection), but it's both those things that he didn't like in the NESE in the first place.

Edit: quoting.
"
Afaik NESE is the only high preformance non solder battery pack in the market and there are many thing I don’t like about it.

1. Cost - literally it’s a monopoly
2. Location - he’s based in EU so shipping will cost even more money
3. Size - it’s huge, it got that extended part for screws terminals, and it’s fully enclosed. In Eskate everyone uses an enclosure anyways there’s no necessity to enclose the whole pack.
```

I don't see it like that....

1. I had nothing against the box design. I just didn't like NESE's terminal. I'm trading modularity for compact size. Also, there's no way to get the cell holders under 22mm tall with these nylon standoffs (can't source brass or aluminium ones for cheap).
2. I custom made this busbars because some of us prefer solid surface to surface contacts and it still gives  flexibility between series. they are quite cheap too. it literally cost <$2 a piece for me and that was with $70 DHL shipping from China.

Anyways I don't think it's worth my effort to sell them as 3d printed parts. If I can, I would much rather do a groupbuy and get them injection molded. And I will release the files for the V1 standoff design as well as the my sources for BOM next week. 

the reason why I went with the modified NESE box and these custom made pressed braid is V1 is take too much time to assemble. They will work if you dont mind taking the time to assemble them.

[quote="agniusm, post:702, topic:36847"]
What got me is that he even does not want to share stl files, not to mention CAD’s cause its bad for business.
In the end, the system started taking NESE shape with lower quality components costing marginally less.

Gimme a break dude. "Lower quality parts" tested on a DC load and easily accessible. I've done over 300 miles on my 13s4p pack and it got slightly toasted by my broken 6.6 melting in the enclosure and it's still holding up.

Forgot how to mention thr v1 with the compressed braid allows the pack to flex if it has to without worry. With about 1-2mm length of series braid the pack can flex wuite a bit. I’m gonna have mine on a Hummie deck so I won’t be able to check how much it can flex but you can always extend the series braid length if needed for more flexibility

@Skunk, your message that I just came to this thread to take a stab at him is deleted but I am still going to reply to you.

Well, I am not a person to take a stab at anyone. I say things as they are.  I have really liked his design, right from the start, especially because he made  the modules more compact and continuous. Then it was "I" who suggested to use copper braids with raised tabs and then @Winfly and I talked about what braids size to use, where to buy it from and, if memory serves me right, current ratings etc. Before that he has using stamped continuous copper tabs. I was pretty eager at every point in his designs and still am. I just like to state things as they are. 

The thing is, if your design starts to look like an opensource design it should follow the same etiquettes as an opensource design. That's my beef here, nothing else

We’ve been arguing which is safer. Bands r bolts.  Have to make better press today.   

Stiff tabs, while seeming Better w higher amp ability, it’s also a liability w the compression of each individual cell.  Cells in p could disconnect.

Don't know how you made the nipples but from the photo it looks of different height. I assume these are not flexible at all and it might pose a danger if the variation in height is too great.
When i was doing mine manually, i made a jig, then used drill bit blunt end to form nipples hitting 3 times with a hammer to ensure even height. Could be an option here.

If you ask me, i think its safer to have braid only and bolts to keep it whole while having rubber bands to keep them pressed.

```
the nipples I made in the pic were just to see how possible it was to bend the material and I definitely won't be using that one.   I assumed your contacts are not bendable @agniusm and you had the same risk of a paralleled cell losing contact but maybe yours are a bit bendable which in my mind would be much safer.   but when it gets to be a thin contact that is bendable and safer in that way it often has a sharp edge which is also dangerous and so easy to cut the shrink wrap.   I made some contact before using a thin foil and a protector above them also 3d printed and maybe will go back to that.   intact thats what I'm going to do.  a hair more space and bendable.  

the braid I'm afraid could have a strand break or compress and have a strand get under the shrink and short so I have it oriented so its only solid contact under the cell.

@agniusm your poron foam is a standard for having little compression and I know you've done tons of testing with what you made but the poron seems so thin.  I actually feel safer with bands!  wondering what testing could be done to assure no p cells are losing contact.

Since you switch to rigid tabs, may I ask whether do you think there is the possibility that few wires  inside the braid can brake under pressure at the level of the posive side? Then make a bridge between the neg and pos part of the positive side. I know you added a ring to close the positive side except the battery "nipple", but I was just wondering about it.   Anyhow really good design. Thx!

Edit: well apparently @Hummie thought the same. Fun

My tabs are 0.6mm so they are flexible and poron allows for it to flex and hit each and every cell. The tabs are also punched and pressed on industrial press so the tolerances are more uniform than those you can get manually punching.
The poron might be thin, bit it develops a force (actual measured force)  that i think is sufficient. Here is my own quote from the back in da day :) :slight_smile:
 So, poron is producing 18-20N of force measured. Thats 1.83kgf/2.54cm² and 2.04kgf/2.54cm².
Poron specification is 76kPa which is 0.775kgf/cm² or 1.968kgf/2.54cm² which is close to my observation.

I don't think there would be any loose wire from the braid at all. Unless they were already there when you assembled it. Everything is fitted tightly and not possible be move on the inside.. Unless you lose compression by idk dropping the whole thing from like a good height and breaking the plastic.

Also I didn't just switch to rigid tabs, I got them for testing.

@mishrasubhransu which one looks like an open source project? The newer box design? I literally just printed a few more than 2 weeks ago and didn't do anything with them.

Also, do any of these take heat shrink around the batt? Didn't see it in the description on thingi so I presume noy

 Thank-yew

I only have the 20700 holders atm. @neiru37 finally finished building his 12s4p sanyo pack. I can go home and modify it for 21700. But please print and test them before building the whole pack.

Counting on @RedBaron for printing. We'll let ya know. Give us the thinnest walls you can that will still work, I think total depth is 23mm. Definitely no room to widen the diameter with thick wall heatshrink.

Need 21700 haha.

Give me the 18650 files in a form that aren't STL and I'll make HAYA 21700 modules for everybody ;)

The HAYA is only 22mm deep so you are gonna need the 20700 I made for @neiru37. I'll post them up tonight.

lmao yer either high as fuck or super fuckin busy and stressed. I'll presume the latter ;)

Either way - I'm going to make this HAYA HB83 Shortboard run 21700's in a compression style holder. Just like I'm going to make it run 110 wheels. If I have to route out a bit of the deck myself for some more depth to accomodate, I will. I just want to use the base design of your holders :)

To be fair my Haya is a v1 prototype so dimensions could have changed.

Do you mind reposting or resharing your files? The link requires permission access.

If you are going to use those copper tabs(from http://18650.lt/index.php/product/n-e-s-e-tab-set/), then I'll share the updated files on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3444525) in a day or so. All developments regarding NESE are presented here: https://forum./t/nese-the-no-solder-18650-battery-system/1777

If you are thinking of using the braided copper then you can winfly's designs here: https://www.thingiverse.com/winfly/designs

I'm doing a comparison of both copper braid and the NESE tabs so I'll just check in the upcoming weeks for your files on thingiverse. Thanks for putting in the work!

@annihil8ted
I already had all the files, so it's not a big deal. Just uploaded a few files on thingiverse. The one meant for you is:
1. sidescrew_4P_curvedwall_lid.stl   
2. sidescrew_4P_curvedwall_straight_base.stl 

Print it at 100% scale, assemble the pack to make sure it fits well and there is good compression, otherwise adjust the scale(100.2, 100.5 etc). It all depends on the filament and the print temp etc.

Let me know if you have any issues.

Thanks! I'll let you know how it turns out. Do you have even earlier iterations of your designs? The one that looks similar to the older winfly version but replaces the standoff?

I do have them, pm me and I'll send them. But I absolutely hate them when compared to these new designs. They just take a lot of time to assemble and disassemble. Also of you don't don't have the right torque on the screws then you either crack them or you don't have good enough compression. Also you can't see the compression.

Does there exist an 1S8P STL of winfly's design? I ask because while I don't intend to make a 8P battery, It's be nice to have a single bracket to connect 4P heads to tails.

Hi there Winfly!

Just wanted to ask if you are considering to share the compression cell holders you made for the Spud with us?! Woudl want to experiment with it on my Spud.

Thank you very much in advance! :)

Oooh I'd love to take you up on that offer! The only think I can think of is maybe have a version where the ends/slits are closed (usually one side has ends/slits open to accommodate the metal braid) and to have a slit in the center of the bracket so you can solder balance leads.

Just a heads up, I finally have 1s4p and 6s2p 21700 holders en route to me. Modified them to use heat-set nutserts. May be overkill. Will update with how they work in a week or two
