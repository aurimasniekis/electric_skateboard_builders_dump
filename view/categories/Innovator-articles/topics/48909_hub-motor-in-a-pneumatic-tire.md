I was just thinking about the different ways we have come up with to transfer power from the motor to the wheels, and I was thinking about how I really like hub motors, but it seems that no matter how well they're made, the issue of either the PU not sticking to the hub, or the ride quality being not nearly as good because of much less PU between the hub and the road is always a problem.  So I was looking at some of the pneumatic tires Trampa makes, and I was just wondering, why hasn't anyone made a hub that fits inside a pneumatic tire?  You wouldn't lose any of the ride quality as the inner hubs/spokes/rims are easily large enough to allow for a hub motor designed to fit in there without compromising the hub motor either...  

I dunno, has anyone tried anything like this?  Seems like a good solution to the main problems I keep hearing about with hub motors.

This looks like an ideal wheel to put a hub motor in.  Just need to machine a way of connecting it in there and fitting to the tire.

Not to mention a hub motor that size would have huge mechanical advantage compared to our current  motors so that mean way way more torque with out gears. That is a good idea let's so if anyone is skilled enough to invent it. BTW I want those wheels for my build so bad.

I looked into this and it would work if someone wants to design a hub motor for the trampa tires. All it needs is someone to do it

In terms of width, I figure as long as it is mounted in the wheel and is flush on the outside, it would work just fine. Be kinda like a hybrid direct drive like Carvon… Half hub half Carvon style direct drive sticking inwards a bit.

Anyone know what the inner diameter of that wheel I posted is?  If one was to make a hub motor specifically for that using those dimensions that could be a very powerful motor, it'd be similar to the bike wheel hub motors, and those really are quite powerful!  Hmm I'm really liking this idea... Kinda wish I developed it first now though,... Oh well, free too all! :wink:

This definitely needs to be done. One of the biggest issues hub motors are subject to is vibration wearing the crap out of everything. Put a little cushion of air surrounding them and the problem would be greatly reduced. Only drawback is the drag and bad wear characteristics of rubber. Though if the trampa wheel was used as a platform, you could swap between rubber and urethane depending on conditions.

If I still worked at a machine shop, would be all over this.

You would need a solid tire, which would be heavy and without the comfort of the inflated tires.
Your motor would weigh 2.5 KG instead of 700g and torque would be less than in a geared system with a light weight and small motor. If the torque would be equal, your efficiency would be low and heat would build up. Electric motors simply don't want to produce high torque. They want to run relativity fast at relative low torque output.
Gearing is simple, efficient and the way forward.

If you look at the hub motors out there you will realize that they all face the same issues.
Mechanical strain on motor ( which is the last thing you want), poor efficiency, heavy, limited tire choice and ride comfort.  Since a MTB wheel is bigger, the gearing is smaller relative to the wheel size. Some systems are already smaller in diameter than the wheel diameter. Why would you want to deal with the downsides of a hub motor?

The wheel is bigger, so can be the motor. But these bigger motors are expensive and probably need a rewind to get the right kv, much much work.
There is a 4wd hub motor mountainboard already on es forums, search 4 it.

Not true. If the wheel is bigger, you face negative wheel gearing. A hub motor is not 1:1. it is usually 0.8:1. On a pneumatic wheel the gearing is even worse. In consequence you need to compensate that. relative to the board, the motor can be bigger, but your wheel is also bigger! one RPM on the wheel will get you further than using a 90mm PU wheel. So you need more torque on the motor side and things will go in the wrong direction.  A 1KW bike-hub motor weighs a lot! So would your hub motor. You don't want such a chunky piece attached to your board. 
The Chinese solid tire hub motors deliver 500W and torque is very limited. It would get you rolling on the flat, at the price of very low power and 4KG of extra weight and non inflated tires.

What if you used a smaller esk8 motor, say 50**, coupled with a planetary gear?

Compared to what? They produce more torque than gas engines at lower RPMs. Tesla has proven this repeatedly. 

When using a small motor in a belt driven system, maybe i can see what you're saying. When throwing a fuckload of iron and copper into the center of a pneumatic ring, I think you'll be surprised.

The question is how fast can we get it without losing the _desired_ amount of torque as we shift the KV up in order to find the sweet range.

But ebike hub motors are relatively small to their wheels, when you compare them to eskate hub motors and their wheel size.

I just don't get your point.

Yeah I don't see how they wouldn't have good torque, since as stated earlier, hub motors relative to bike tires are small, so if just one motor on a bike can produce sufficient torque, then 4 motors with much smaller wheels would produce a much greater amount.... As LHB said though, just finding the right kv would be the main factor I think.

That was just an example of what's already out there.  One could build a motor much more powerful easily. 63mm or even 80mm diameter motor sized stator would fit in the hub, it just would be like 40-50mm wide.  Definitely could have 2000W or more...

I was just looking for dimensions of this hub, and it's 4.25in, so about 106mm diameter and 35-40mm width I believe, so that's plenty of room to make a killer hub motor that's perfectly mounted.

What’s frank want to say that electric motor achieve high efficiency by running at low torque / high rpm

Since the dominant loss is cooper loss (I^2R), you want to run the motor at the lowest possible current, meaning the lowest possible torque, and they way to do that is to spin it fast and gear it down (for what) to increase torque at the wheel

If this lowest efficiency really comes into play in real world usage I don’t know

Another problem I see is the pneumatics tires are narrow, and motor torque for a given geometry and winding pattern is directly proportional to motor length, so maybe the motor have to be wider than the wheel/hub to be capable of doing the necessary work without overheating

But I think it’s possible to make it work and would be sick a 4WD with big off road tires

I have a pair of those chinese hub motor tires. About 20cm diameter, 350W per wheel, and that is not enough to climb even 20 degree hills. And they weight 3kg each.
I imagine those 500W would also be as bad.
Smaller the tire diameter, the less power is needed to climb.

I guess it mainly depends on what motor you're using. I'm not sure how most hub motors are mounted these days (square mounting hole?), but if you're talking about adapting a scooter motor you might need to do a little redesigning. That's why I thought it might be easier to try to fit an existing outrunner motor inside the space of the hub.

Ugh OMG I literally spent months thinking about doing exactly what he's done in that video.  I figured since the width of the motors requires you to have to machine a special hanger to mount a motor onto the axle, why not use larger wheels, and then mount a very large diameter, short width,  multi-rotor motor to the axle...  Everyone I mentioned my idea too all told me it wouldn't be nearly powerful enough though...  Well damn, I guess IT CAN BE DONE!   Damn, I gotta rethink some things now...

Depends on what you want doing, for normal mountainboard usage (hillclimbing/offroadaction) a transmission will probably be better.
If you're just coasting on flat streets, the hub wins.

Maybe you need to spend less time thinking and more time doing. 😂

I'm on my second/third rev of DD large enough for pneumatics. I haven't done hub motors because of most motors under $600 don't have a second support bearing and custom making motors isn't something I'm interested in. 

I could fit pneumatics on my dd but I don't see the appeal of spending 300+ on wheels.

That's true, but the main reason for even being this topic up is that the thane seems to always fail in hubs, so if you could mount your hub motor inside the wheel hub, you would eliminate the issue of thin thane and wheel slippage.

I'm not quite sure what point you're  trying to make?  If you have spent so much on thane over the years, it stands to reason that is because the thane has failed you, ie wheel slipping, etc...  So why wouldn't you consider a wheel, say like a Gummies clone or similar where you could mount your hub motor inside of it, and thereby solve your expensive thane problem..?

It just means that the motor's rotor diameter is smaller than the wheel diameter, so there is a reduction in torque.

For example:
Motor outer diameter: 63 mm
Wheel diameter: 107 mm (ABEC 11 flywheel)

So the final drive is 63:107 -> 0.59:1

Or with another wheel size:
Motor outer diameter: 63 mm
Wheel diameter: 90 mm (ABEC 11 flywheel)

Final drive is 63:90 -> 0.7:1 
so more torque compared to the upper wheel, if identical motor is used on both examples

Well that feat of modern day engineering would be crazy sweet compared to the long list of horrible compromises that have had to be made in regards to  all hubmotors. 
Carvon v4's and six shooter wheels are likely to be the best you'll will ever see where air is concerned.

Yeah those wheels would be perfect, with regards to the air nozzle. Their inner tube is just the type you'd need to make a motor in the hub design work!

If you had said that about latex I would have been impressed 🤣

Do it!  I want a wide pneumatic tire no larger than 4.5” with a hub inside. They make the tires for remote control cars but they aren’t made to hold significant pressure.

I have a pair of those chinese hub motor tires. About 20cm diameter, 350W per wheel, and that is not enough to climb even 20 degree hills. And they weight 3kg each.
I imagine those 500W would also be as bad.
Smaller the tire diameter, the less power is needed to climb.

Hey, so you have something like that *link* and don't like it? Can't climb a 20degree hill? https://www.ebay.com/itm/36V48V-350W-Electric-Scooter-Hub-Motor-With-Tyre-200MM-Electric-Brushless-Motor/264245853342?hash=item3d8647bc9e:m:mo__L-KgjqOKYHzScgamxkA

It looks very similar. You need to consider where you are going to use it.

@trampa, you should create the same thread on the other place too.
