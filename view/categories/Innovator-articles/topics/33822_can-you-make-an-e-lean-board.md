Can you make this into an Eboard? Can you use hubs motors? https://www.pramash.com/blank-rwrlr/lean-trucks-and-wheels-only

I don't think you could use hub motors, as they tend to have to attach to the hanger, which isn't in the center of the wheel on those trucks.

The hangers look the surf rodz tkp hangers, it may be that a surf rodz motor mount will work perfectly.

Can i just say don't even bother with hubs, with that double hanger design you have a MUCH stronger mount for a belt drive system. **Seize** this opportunity.
