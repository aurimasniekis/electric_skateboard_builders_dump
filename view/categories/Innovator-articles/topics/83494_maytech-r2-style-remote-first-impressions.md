Thanks for the hookup @hyperIon1!!! I usually prefer to use my thumb, but i love this remote! I only took a quick test ride last night, but so far it‚Äôs my new favorite. The triggers have great resistance, I like the size and weight of it, and it hasnt cut out... yet ü§ûüèº All things considered, I may get another remote... definitely at least another receiver

:disappointed_relieved: i really wanted one lol
Had to pick motors (6880) or remote. 
Glad to hear you like it right away. 
Gonna have to find a way to get my hands on one.

It would be really interesting to have a version with vesc telemetry.. :slight_smile:
@hyperIon1 any chance that's going to happen in the near future? :slight_smile:

Sorry @venom121212, ive had little time with all the shitty rain in SD, work and coaching baseball. I did take it on a group ride this past Saturday and it had 0 interruptions and zero cutouts. Brakes worked everytime. I did experience a little loss in power if I slammed the throttle too fast but im almost sure its because of my speed controllers settings and the shitty diyeboard battery.... other than that, the throttle feels great, and its a perfect fit in the hand.... i plan on getting more rceivers to pair this remote to several different boards. Wireless charging works great as well! Once you pair it up and calibrate the first time, it really works effortlessly. You turn on your board and the remote and it‚Äôs ready to roll. My only gripe is the lack of features on the screen. It only displays battery life and throttle %. Adding more kinds of telemetry like mph,wh, vlltage and so on would be nice. Maybe some kind of Bluetooth functionality with a module...... but I digress, i love a thumb trigger remote, but this dual trigger remote has become my favorite. Thanks for the hookup @hyperIon1. Cant wait for my 6880s to come in !!!

No esk8 lanyard. It comes with a giant orange floatation device/wristrap lanyard for the surfing function but it looks silly if you‚Äôre not in water

I believe its meant to float (bulky orange lanyard). I'm going to ask them to include a regular lanyard instead of the floaty one in the next order.

It definitely is a floaty. Looks like a life vest strapped to a lanyard. Im not sure because im at work but i think the floaty may be removable. Then again it mag be sewn on

I wanted to ask if you still haven't had any cut outs? I recently got this remote too and 4 receivers for all my boards. So far I freaking love it, so precise. 

I ride in NYC everyday and I have noticed in some areas I'll see the remote connection signal drop to no bars but I'll still have a connection and it responds to inputs. So to be clear I've had no full drops, but the signal thing sketches me out a little.

Honestly i had none. I lost the remote somewhere in my house a week ago so ive been using a Nano-x mod but WHEN i find it I plan on using it lol. TBH i never really looked at the signal bar when i rode tho

I'll add on here as I've been using this remote for about a week now. 

I love it. Initial calibration was confusing til I found documentation. The feel is ergonomically pleasing. The amount of throw for both throttle and brake give for a ton of control. Wirelessly charging it is cool. I keep a charge pad in my garage where I charge. No dropouts or issues so far. I also like that it has a notch for a wrist strap.

have you experienced the no bars on the read out but still have connection thing, I mentioned above? 

I haven't had drops in areas of NYC that are known for drops (see steeze maytech and boosted v1 remote). However, that's only my limited experience.

I had a cut out this morning =(.

I didn't mount the receiver in the middle of the board and when I pulled my hand up to look at the readout in a high interference area it dropped. Only for a second but it dropped. I'm going to re-position to the middle and make the receiver wire come out of the enclosure a little. 

I was wondering is it possible to gut a nano v2 and use the signal and receiver bits for a better connection? (I have very very limited knowledge of receivers work other than them being bluetooth or 2.4ghz)

The nano rx and tx aren't built for sending vesc data. Im also interested in a bulletproof connection for a wireless remote with telemetry. To be honest, I would pay up to 200 dollars for the receiver alone to have the absolute guarantee that it never drops

If I'm not mistaken the Maytech "R2" doesn't read VESC data either. it only reads signal strength and how much you are pulling the throttle or pushing the brake. It also has a read out for remote battery, and board battery if you solder a wire from the positive side of the battery pack to the "42v" pin on the receiver.

I have about 3 nano v2 receivers and two nano v2 remotes. Do you think I can cut up the pairing bits and make them work for the Maytech? I don't mind the calibration of the nano v2 prior to pairing with the board each time just because it never drops a connection which is my main concern. After riding some of my higher powered boards for a few days I'm in love with the throw and feel of this new maytech remote, its soooo precise, just need to find a solution so it never drops. I can't see myself going back from this remote.

Hmm not sure about compatibility between them. You could try a thin transparent plastic tube around the antenna to get it to lay straight. Try and keep it untangled from power wires specifically I've heard

There has to be a way to amplify the receiver or something.

A typical lipo uses standard li-on chemistry so I'd assume 3.7v

That is correct. Don't be scared when you don't see the first battery bar drop. It won't change until what I measured ~78% battery

I hade more cut outs today even after I pushed the receiver out of the enclosure. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt reco this remote to anyone in a city area or places with heavy signal interference. I did the one legged balance dance through nyc traffic because of delay and that was nooooot cool at all.

The receiver that comes with the remote has an unsoldered point labeled 42V. If you run a wire from that to your battery's positive, you will get voltage reading on the remote's screen.

I just made a small xt60 male to female adapter and tied the positive in there.

As a general safety rule with anything rc its best to turn the remote on first to avoid runaway stuff.  Had too many cars fly off on their own to do it any other way now.  Only happened to me once on esk8 but it went under a car.  Push to start pre-built.

If you're using a nano/nanox then yes I think the board has to be on first to calibrate.

I have the maytech r2 connected to FocBox Unity correctly I think. But my battery meter almost never goes down. I have 12s4p and it is set for 11 cells. Maybe I set it for 10? Wish I had more play in the battery meter....

Yeah I agree with you here. They say to set it to the correct cell count if you have the r2v2 (slightly different display) but I still don't see a drop until ~80% battery. Even then, I only see the bar drop when throttling. I wish it did an average cell amp count or something more intelligent. 

I do love the control setup, feel, and form of the remote still
