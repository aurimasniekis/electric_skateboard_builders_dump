Hey everyone,

During the day I work as a product expert for a 3D design tool that's actually free for hobbyists / enthusiasts, teaching people what's possible with the software, and helping individuals with projects. I've noticed there's a fair amount of interest in 3D Printing / CNC-ing parts, but this requires skills in 3D modeling.

I'd be more than happy to teach folks how to design their own parts in 3D - I just need to know **what** you're looking to design! If anyone has anything in mind that they'd like to learn, give me a shout, and I'll make it happen.

Here to help!

And what tool is that praytell?

[Found ya.](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/blog/author/taylor-stein/)

Fusion360 FTW!  Good to see Autodesk here.  Maybe you can talk to Carl about sponsoring the esk8 convention...

Really interested in Creating a 3D Design for bashguards for my board ! Either the type that extends over the edge or ones that overlapes the edge it self ![image|375x500](upload://lhsfi7IXRnwWfXDVKeqWfH8KBWC.jpeg)

I like the idea of modeling a 3D printing a bash guard! I've also been thinking about showing the steps to create a Timing Pulley.

When my build progresses, I was thinking of documenting the process of designing, CNC, and vacuum forming a custom enclosure.

That would be awesome!  I really want to start using the CAM functionality, but I'm stuck on using CAMBAM for everything because that's what I'm comfortable with.  

Started using 123D, then moved onto Inventor Fusion now using Fusion360.  Autodesk is the bees knees, and I preach it to my students whenever I get the chance.

Here, I need to learn how to 3D model. Got two ideas; First, to 3D my conformal battery enclosure which will be detachable like a combat aircraft ammunitions store. Second, I want to create either a full wide footstop or an integral, 5 in 1, front end footstop sleeve (it will fit thru the forward deck neck like wearing a T-shirt thru your head) which will incorporate front lights, voltmeter, speedometer and battery indicator, all in one piece.

I assume you have some FEA knowledge too? Could you help out setting up a stress analysis for a truck hanger. I am particularly interested how to constrain the bloody thing.

Id like to make some sort of remote holder to go on the bottom of the deck when I carry it. Also wheel splash guards.

I love fusion.  Using it non stop for my 3d prints and other designs. 
I have a question though.  I thought the only free option was a 3 year license for students.  What's with this 

[quote="Tstein, post:1, topic:45384"]
thatâ€™s actually free for hobbyists / enthusias
[/quote]

I'm hugely interested because I wad kind of scared the 3 year period would arrived.  Already burned 2 years.

Anyhow.I'm going to be abusing your knowledge generosity.  Thank you very much

Fusion 360 is certainly different. I have to admit that I like the thermal/mechanical stress analysis package but that's about it. For everything else I use Inventor (which is not harder to learn). And I hate that everything ends up somehow in the cloud!

Nah it really isn't that much harder to learn Inventor, I just prefer the layout of Fusion better.  However, I personally like that it is in the cloud because then I can switch seamlessly from my laptop to desktop, and even across Windows and Mac, taking my personal settings wherever I want.

@krloz - in addition to our student offering, there's a 1-year license for Startups / Enthusiasts. [Here is more information](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/fusion-360/learn-explore/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-activate-start-up-or-educational-licensing-for-Fusion-360.html) on the startup license. The license can be renewed every year : )

This might be a stretch but I'm interested in learning how to model a square mold for pressing my own decks. I'm trying to model a "street" style shape in Fusion but I'm struggling to model the dips and concave correctly.

Happy to share my first eSk8-related Fusion 360 tutorial! Per @Jc06505n 's request, this video shows how to design a 3D-printable bash-guard. It was a fun project to work on. Modeling the exact deck profile can be tricky, as it's hard to accurately measure with calipers.

[Here's the Tutorial!](https://youtu.be/SVGrygpnbpM)

Looking forward to making more tutorials, and I'm always open to suggestions

I have to use Fusion at my workplace nowadays. I did Inventor and SW for quite a bit too. Fusion has some really great usability features, but for anything a bit more serious (ESPECIALLY if you need 2D production drawings) I would prefer literally anything else over Fusion. It down right sucks ass at drawigns. Oh and weldments are not there in any shape or form. Oh and configurations? ever heard of such things? They can be usefull sometimes (deep sarcasm).

Overall Fusion is really only for hobby people at this point.

Hi, I was wandering if you could have a look at this design I made for dual mounts, I have never done CAD stuff before so any advice would be appreciated.
