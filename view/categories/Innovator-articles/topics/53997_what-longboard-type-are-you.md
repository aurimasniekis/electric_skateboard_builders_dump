speedboards suck for footplacement, speaking of expierence. Feerideboards are better in every aspect, you can even get them with a kicktail

what? this makes no sense, if your foot doesnt have enough space to be completly on the board you will feel it after a while

nice, thats a good answer. now i understand your point of view. that's exactly what i was talking about. I dont like to have my feet on the edge. Thats why the freerideboard shape is for me better. But gotta give you a point, i should have my point clearer.
And my point of reference is the picture above from OP, because many DH boards i have seen don't even have that shape.

Your speedboard too short brah. Your feet should not be all the way on the nose and tail of that style of board. I have a 41" and a 45". Your front foot should be on the wider portion of the board.

never said it is. it is just limiting, and i always look at it from an eskate angle. the narrow end is troublesome for enclosures. It is just limiting in you range of choice, thats why i said it is worse than the freeride shape. i am not talking length just shape and width.
@cobber dude you are not forced to reply at all or 24hrs, and why that last jab again....
