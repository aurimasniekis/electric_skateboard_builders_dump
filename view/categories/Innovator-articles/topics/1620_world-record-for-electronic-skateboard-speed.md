I feel like this is going to be broken repeatedly until electric longboard racing becomes as popular as /insert any animal or vehicle/ racing.

Someone should cram a CF tube full of batteries (I'm thinking like 2x12s), strap it to a deck (or ride the battery tube bareback), and break the record with a 4WD setup (Standard 6374 motors, just for kicks). The record was set for electric skateboards, not for hub motor builds.

Seatbelt optional, but helmet and suit are required.

Need $200 for CF tubing, $250 for batteries, $400 for VESC(s), $300 for motors and gets, and $200 for trucks and wheels (why not?).

I'm pretty sure that's why he fell. If you watch it frame by frame you can see part of the wheel fly off and then he bails. When he's carrying the board after he fell, you can see the hub motor with no rubber. Non hub motors are probably better for more speed but no skateboard wheel is designed for this kind of speed lol.

Can u lay down. Can the board be as big as my front door. 

I think just adding some fiberglass fabric in the wheel towards the inside would do a lot toward holding it.   

Anyone who wants to try ...(4) 200kv motors for 350$ Or use them on 6s, as apposed to 12s, and stay at 33mph

The record is 59 all those who don't know.  You can do that easily.  I can't but you can in your leather suit and full face helmet

Their wheel choice was horrible.  There are many wheels in the downhill world that can handle those speeds.  I guess they didn't really have an option since they are using hub motors.  The last I heard of those  motors was when I was in the RC helicopter phase, basically they are used on huge helicopters to spin the rotors and have insane torque and speed.  

Going fast in a straight line on perfect roads is not that hard and it does not make you a skilled skater.  It's being able to hold a line going downhill at speed that takes skills.  I'd say anyone with basic long boarding experience can hit 40 mph in a straight line on perfect tarmac with protective gear.  The board would have to be set up to avoid speed wobbles and the rider would need to have some balls.  

I am not a pro rider by any means but I'd be stupid enough to try to break that speed in a straight line on perfect tarmac with my suit and full face helmet.  The wheels would have to be bigger, board set up would have to be to my liking, and the tarmac would have to be perfect.  The 2nd or 3rd time I got on a long board in my teenage years I went on a slight hill that got me up to 30 mph and this was without any gear, so that was way dumber than attempting to go fast in a straight line in a controlled environment with appropriate gear.

I wonder if anyone here can build a board that could go faster.  I do think record will be broken, officially or unofficially.

It is any easy record to break as you say.  A nice round number of 60.  I'm surprised it's so low considering he's done I think 80something as the regular downhill record.  
With protective gear he even showed if you go down you can get right back up.  Don't try to roll but slide it out. 

If I had the board set up and the gear and the space to do it I couldn't help but try.  Sounds fun.   

I believe the the (4) 200kv motors I have could do it and am dying to get them in the hands of someone who really wants to try. Someone who simply has a good leather suit and full face helmet and the desire.  350$ for four motors if ur really thinking about it.  Just need 4 vescs and not even a big battery.  Probably the easiest cheapest way to get in the Guinness book without doing something gross or retarded

4x VESC: ~$350
4x HummieHubs: $350
2x 12s 5Ah Batteries + Charger: ~$100-150
Wired Nunchuck (for Reliability): ~$5

So really, you need a lot more money to do this.  Safety gear too. Plus renting out a tarmac.  

If the community sets a bounty for setting a new record by 5-10mph, I'll consider it if I would break even.

If you are willing o wait a few months, Enertion sells them with discounts (the more you buy). Pairs sell for $180, so two would be $350 more or less (shipping not included).

I wouldn't build this till VESC 5.0 or if you feel capable of switching the current shunts with ones for 10-12s voltage at 30-60Amps.  FOC doesn't like going higher than 10s 20Amp with my current unsensored motor.

Don't think that the @Hummie hubz are 200kv, think they are 80kv or 90kv. 
Wheel size is around 83mm, so that would give you around 55km/h unweighted, weighted around 39km/h 

@photorph, go for it! 

btw, in order to reach 100km/h unweighted, wheels must be 150mm for these motors :-)

I imagine it wouldn't be 100% efficient, but I dont know enough about the topic, especially hub motors. Just as a reference point the theoretically max speed of the Raptor is 45km/hr which is what it actually hits. Though being at full charge probably helps with this.

I THINK but don't know for sure, that there is a huge efficiency loss with hub motors compared to a belt drive system.  

I hit 44ish km/h on my raptor all the time on flats.  So the raptor has a high efficiency because it's a belt drive system.  Same is the case with my other belt drive board.  I've never ridden a hub motor board or have any experience with them, curious to learn more though.

at 80mph there is a TON of air resistance so I would definitely agree it'd be hard to hit 80 with his hubs. Not to mention the urethane will probably literally explode off the rotor can.

I know from motorcycles that belt drives do have about an 11% loss on the drivetrain, that why sport bikes still use chains, even though they make more noise and need much more maintnence, they apparently only have a 2% loss on the drivetrain. Shaft drive motorcycles have about a 24% loss. 

I wonder if the same numbers would apply to es8's?, have a board set up with a little chain drive, may gain 9% of power to the wheel compared to a belt? Until it gets dirty anyway.

In general the more moving parts between a motor and a wheel hitting the ground, the greater the drivetrain loss. That's way tesla basically mounts their motors right on the axle.

belts can be very close to the efficiency of chains.  Last way longer.  Much quieter 

http://www.chuckhawks.com/motorcycle_drive_systems.htm

hub motors need not be more inefficient and can be more efficient if they have enough power I read.   Cut the pulley or gearing system and replace it with copper.  So I read on es.  The debate still rages

@GhettoFab.rictation  I wont be running bindings for top speed tests so when I go down it should just be a long slide. Yeah Ill have all my gear on for this one.

Im thinking of it as more of a test and tune day but between @MoeStooge and myself there's a good chance some personal bests might happen which means that 59mph mark is that much closer.

You should probably give us an expected post time. So anything after we can all start to speculate what happened.

@MoeStooge is going to try and get the video of his runs edited but I can give you a summary. My 25hp trampa couldmt break 40mph without the wobbles despite taking most of the rear truck angle out and tightening the springs all the way down into the stiffest white dampas.

Brandon was able to build speed on his runs all day finishing with a 57mph run.

Awesome work guys.  I'd love some salt flats to work on. What kind of wobbles were they? 

I switched to taller gears and 107mm for my setup. Soon as I hit about 35 I started getting wobbles as well. Topped out at 37mph. They were slow building wobbles but I couldn't stop them from increasing with speed so I had to back off.

BigBro have you seen the elastomers duffman made, Jenso has a set... they were black elastomers the size of the springs, there was some video of some dampening.tests...

MoeBro! smoking it in at 57mph... way to go dude!

So, we got to the dirt flats with some unknowns and first times in front of us. The dry lake bed surface was cracked but smooth. The relative traction to asphalt was obviously way down. We started slow with 40mph runs. DkCharger on the radar and recording on his phone and Chuck running chase car with a GoPro.  Made 7 or 8 runs progressing speed  with each pass.  Last run was at 30v on 8s. At 57mph the push from the rear wheels Vs the limited traction from the dirt hit a wall and lost forward bite. I felt the board had another 8 or 9 mph in it. Board was stable and straight till we spun the rear wheels. We all took quite a bit from these speed tests and learned a lot. #fastestboardondirt 🏁

Ive seen the elastomers but I think my set up will need more than that to be stable at high speed. With the springs cranked down on the white dampas the board was super stiff, but the vertical and torisonal flex of the trampa deck still made it very unstable above 35mph.  The sketchiest part is letting off the throttle. The slight shift forward onto the front causes a bounce that easily turns into a wobble. A rigid deck is must if I wanna try for top speed on this drive train set up again.

I was excited to see the results mate!!! great runs! @MoeStooge nice now you can find pavement possibly to top the record! @BigBoyToys I am running 100% stiff board with old school hanger trucks taking spring out of the equation. The build I went for was urban high speed emtb anyway so I'm hoping when I'm finished we could meet up for runs in case you are ever half way across the world hah :laughing: . It's nice to see that with a miniature tire balance machine and tighter trucks that you had space!!! Keep in touch mate I'm excited to see what you and Moe can do in the near future!
