Guys this thread is for any of you that wish to collaborate your contribute towards the development of a permanent solution to the wheel slip issue.

Im going to be as transparent as possible. 

Option 1 
Right now I found a manufacture that can make the wheel with a polycarbonate core or Tpu or metal. The issue is they wont move forward without at least $500 in sales. This is http://www.gallaghercorp.com/ they seem to know polyurethane very well and have the ability to bond it to almost anything.

Option 2

Ive developed the insert in polycarbonate as well as the outer perimeter and the stepped edge infills using a 3d printer. Ive had issues with the casting epoxy resin bondjng to the form as well as expanding and creatjng air pockets.
I found a manufacture that can provide a 85a shore casting polyurethane thats perfect for the wheels but they sell in gallons at $180 per gallon and min order of $250.

What would you feel would generate a better solution for the community?

Option 1 and we get $500 bucks to get things rolling with gallagherg and we write a performance spec as well as cad drawings 

Or 

Option 2 and we get half the amount and i continue to explore creating the wheels on my own using the resources i have at home?

For option 1, what durometers could you get? Also, could you get them in 90 or 97mm sizes? I'm thinking a 90mm 75a or 78a wheel could be pretty sweet.

What I want to see is the specification for a rebound of at least 33%. I heard the best wheels in longboard get around 35%. Just note polyurethane is a terrible conductor of heat and needs some consideration. From reading a few books and articles, the wheels are better if it is hot pour and cure in an oven controlled setting.

I'm  down for whatever the decision is. If you want to learn more and make them, that's cool. or leave it to someone that knows the process in and out which leaves you time to focus on other projects.

Id like to get these sets done professionally and set up a trusted manufacture that others can benefit from in the future.

Ive sent gallagher the requests everyone mentioned as well as my design for a production cost estimate per set that meets a total purchase of $500 min.

Its best to let an expert in the US do this given how many times this has gotten screwed up.

They may even do an aluminum sleeve with polyurethane bonded. I want a badass wheel set for this dam motor!

The offroad version is next if this is a success.

Would it be possible to make a aluminium sleeve with some small fins on the inside of the wheel could also help cooling and give a little more support to bond the thane in place.

Of course if you look at my second sleeve design it actually has greater volume and a sqaure ribbed surface. Ideally if it were aluminum it would act as a huge heatsink given he polyurethane can withstand the temps and the bond. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/6/c/6c9ef7bf71c8837b4d90a5b55004b6eb4dd0947f.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Guys,

I need to provide the rep with drawings what the wheel size youd like and how are we going to fund this initiative?

Call me if you have questions 305 834 2929

This is the email from the rep.

Rafael,
The next step would be for you to provide us with a drawing of the part.  We need to understand the dimensions and tolerances. 
Do you have CAD files?  We work in solidworks over here.  Once we check out the design we will get a better understanding if this is a good fit or not.

Good point, maybe 97mm would be better so we have the option of running clones too. Plus, clones come in black too, so they would actually match. I'll cast my vote for 97mm.

I don't know if I said this all before here but Bjb enterprises has room cure two part pu that can be gotten in small quantities.   You'll need a good vacuum pump and chamber and I'd get stuff that has a working time / pot life much longer than 3 minutes and it can take a lot of time to get everything well mixed, degassed, and into the mold.  The longer the better for that for convenience and the longer the cure time and pot life the better the working properties seem to be 

In my looking a polycarbonate 3D print core is possibly the best high heat resistant 3D printable core.  Aluminum as a heat sink core there's nowhere for the heat to go and maybe also would add to the obstacle of pu's mechanical properties deteriorating with the heat.   Think it's best to have a non-thermally conductive core...whatever will allow the core to stick well to the pu and keep the heat away from it.  Almost all pu deteriorates around a stated 170f.  Pu is said to stick well to most things but with the mix of heat and stress..hopefully the polycarbonate sticks and holds. That's my plan as well.   If it doesn't hold you could use a hard pu as the harder stuff is more heat resistant and pu sticks great to pu.  A hard pu is typical as a core. 
All the pu I've seen is supposed to sit around for maybe 30 days to have its full mechanical properties.
80 duro will soften with heat
U can also get high duro silicone around 50 duro for the mold from bjb.  All and all expect to spend maybe 400 including pump, chamber, silicone for mold, and a minimum of pu.

That makes sense, I can make any of those work. 100mm fronts could be my 100mm MBS ATLB wheels. Or 107mm match with ABECs or 97mm which are pretty much 100mm so can match either way and not notice.

I did one in house yesterday in 80a duro and I'll post the pictures later today. It's black 86mm with an outer lip. This time the urethane isn't sticking so the demold is working good. 

It will take several days before it fully cures to max strength but right now it feels solid with virtually no air bubbles.


 Still waiting on a responsemail from the Gallagher engineering team.

Another shot of the fit and the urethane after 100 miles of riding. So far so good.
Yesterday I received confirmation that Gallagher wouldn't take on this project for production. So for now it's just these unless someone else finds a manufacturer. 

I'm really happy with the ride and the results so far and I think the 97mm will be great too. Hopefully in the future we can get them in 70a duro for a silky smooth ride.

Thanks for the support you know who you are ; )

If need access to any supplier. I have used http://www.thomasnet.com/ to find companies selling castable polyurethane elastomer for a DIY longboard wheels in the past. I stopped because of the need for using the hot pour method means working with a company who have the equipment.

OK the form is ready for the 100mm wheels I'd like  to buy a gallon of the urethane. How many of you are willing to actually buy these 100mm from me?

I need to be able to offset materials cost which isn't cheap. The price per set will be $89 

The central core is redesigned to be more robust and take on the additional stress of 100mm, which by the way is huge!  There is no hub motor with 100mm wheels. I am pretty sure you can get off-road with these diameters in unpaved roads. I also need to buy 100mm clones for the front tires.

Thanks to @oriol360 for getting me a badass remote I was able to try to new diameter. It rides 60% smoother than the 90mm especially over rough asphalt. It also takes on grass like a champ. The motor has plenty of power and pulls me up to a 26 mph top speed on a 12s2p LG hg2 pack with no issues. The torque is reduced a bit but I like it because you won't fall on an accidental full throttle acceleration.

Duro is 80a . I'm making some changes to the form work to make it more efficient as well as testing the wheel for durability . I think in the coming 2 weeks I'll have it tested enough to sell. I don't plan on making the 90mm since this design is so much better. Price is 89.99 in the USA and an additional $34 for international. Yes it will include two front black wheels as well as the rear hub wheels. Front are 97mm rear are 100mm. 


Thanks for the positive vibes!

Yes that can be done but no one will pay the price of custom bolt ons required for the bead to set properly. Getting the sharader valve out will also cause major issues. Thanks

```
actually the 6inch pneumatics could fit directly on the hub.
inner diameter is ~75mm and the hubs have an outside diameter of ~72.
All we'd need is new endcaps that are extended in diameter to keep the tire from sliding of.

the valve could be fitted through a hole in the endcap.

I wouldn't be comfortable copying the endcap and increasing the diameter. Maybe Jacob can take on that endeavor since those caps are part of the integrity of the motor .

well they obviously would need to be cut from aluminium - all I am saying is that theoretically it should be possible.
if anyone has a watercutter I'd be happy to help design the caps.

You could design them and send them to 3d print at shapeways in stainless steel. They can also be milled in a cnc. 

At 5" the motor will struggle to pull a heavy rider even on a flat surface. 

In the coming week I'm hoping to have @oriol360 set me up with the Bluetooth BlDC app on my dual vesc and hopefully can get you guys consumption numbers at 90mm and 100mm vs the 83mm

Cool man thanks, just a quick update on the developments . I changed the design from the polycarbonate core with 80a urethane to a full 80a urethane wheel with 8 transverse 3mm stainless steel rods that reinforce the wheel laterally. The ride improved even more ! it's really smooth even on rough asphalt and over sidewalks. Today @oriol360 and I rode a bit after he helped me setup the Bluetooth adapter on my VESC and he really like the torque and smoothness of the ride. I added the Bluetooth adapter so you guys can see the current draw and speed along with the video on the big 100mm wheels. I should have pics of the new prototype and videos later in the week. It's a great design that very robust and hopefully everyone in the community van benefit from the product or the research development progress. Many thanks !

I'll clarify everything now and refund you the money. 

The sale includes everything listed on the PayPal invoice. 

My intention was to keep the price affordable despite having to add 16 stainless steel rods and many other components to the urethane wheel to make the design work from the first version which didn't include all the additional hardware. 

I can't also include the wheels in the front at this point

The community experienced some urethane deformation or slipping with the original design . depending on riding conditions and user preferences some requested bigger wheels that offered a smoother ride and no wheel slip. 

I came up with the design up there with the help of many individuals including engineers from Gallangher who offered their insight on the design.

Guys between today and tomorrow im fullfilling the final order of the 3 people that requested the item and actually paid..

Because of the time involved to produce this i don't see myself doing this beyond this week. Im actually loosing money in the process. 

Moving forward I might be making the wheels just out of urethane for those interested in the higher diameter. And the buyer can solve the hardware fabrication and bracing strategy. 

In had really hoped more of you would support the efforts but it is what it is. 

Many thanks to the 3 of you that actually paid for a set.

I am sorry but my Jacob Hubs are still going strong and I have had no need for an upgrade.
Adding some layers of adhesive tape around the motor can and over the 3D printed nubs caused me to never experience any slipping urethane (even on summer roads at 30°) - I actually feel bad because I got the impression that the slipping urethane caused Jacob to lose out on this project bigtime. It was a 2min fix for me.

OK so I think the contact path of the 97mm clone wheels is about 45-50mm and the width of the 100mm hub wheels I'm guessing will be about 60-65mm? Call me weird but I prefer to have them approx. equal.

This is my current setup, the front wheels are very soft and 55mm wide 83mm diameter 78a Alien Power System wheels, dyed in black (original color orange). The hub motor wheels are non-slip quite hard urethane 60mm wide. So the difference btw front and back is 0mm in diameter and only 5mm in width.

You are kidding me right? The difference you feel is due to quality differences in the urethane not contact patch. Also mounted on the board that difference is hard to see. Your Alien Wheels are also clones - so you just have to find the right 97mm clones with the width you want.
There is no such thing as a regular clone - all the wheels that are not Abec11s but have the same spoke pattern are clones.
Also you would have the same problem with 107mm wheels so I don't get it.

Well the urethane is softer than that of the 76a trampa stickies, which are the ones in the image. So that helps. But in my opinion, a wider wheel also distributes the weight of the rider better - more urethane on the ground is not a bad thing. So no, I'm not kidding you. I've ridden both of these wheels and there is a huge difference btw them.

Yes I might have the same problem with the 107mm ABEC's, but maybe not. Trying to find out. Also, if you know of 97mm wheels that are wider than the Abec's or clones, that would solve my problem. I just couldn't find any.

A workaround could also be to use Paris 195mm trucks for the front, to make up for the loss in width. The hub motors increase the width of the custom 180mm trucks considerably.

How is that new harder non slip urethane ? I tried it out when they were developing it and it was noisy. It  sounded like there was play between the nubs and the motor especially at high speeds. I had told them to reduce internal diameter but they didn't listen. 

The ride over rough asphalt was also unbearable it would numb my feet.

They are certainly not perfect, but much better than the original ones. I don't get slippage, unless I push them really hard uphill when they are already smoking hot. But this board I use mostly for trips in the city under 10km, so under normal conditions I don't have any problems, and up to about 30kmh they run totally smooth. I weigh 78kg.

The Jacobs motors have a lot of torque at low speed, but some other hub motors might have a problem dealing with the larger diameter what do you think? I also use the torqueboards hub motors on another board, with 90mm wheels. But even at that size I need to get over about 15kmh before they start pulling hard. That's generally fine, unless you're doing a lot of stop and go. On the plus side I'm getting a higher top speed.

That sounds great man, thanks for the offer! As far as I know those motors all come from the same factory, and just had them confirm they are 67kv. They are currently changing the design of the motors: adding hall sensors, lengthening the magnets, and changing the mounting/truck design. Supposedly they are more powerful and with better starting and climbing torque. They recommend using them with their new controller instead of the VESC. Apparently they can already be purchased, but I would be hesitant because from experience I know they tend build a lot of crap as well. Luckily they are still manufacturing the old design as well. The trucks they use will be a bit narrower for whatever reason, only about 170mm instead of 180mm. The new mounting design looks good though. My locking screws kept braking, but now I just close the axle nut extremely hard and that seems to hold them in place even with broken screws. What do think of sensored motors, are they worth it?

Sure they are good salespeople most of the time. The VESC's I got from them blew up after 2 days, and they didn't really want to deal with that. Had them repaired by Lucas from lp-electronic in Germany, now they run really well. I'm not an expert, but apparently they had some serious design flaws. I'm happy to keep buying the original 83mm motors from them, and I'm curious about the new design, but yeah.. don't want to be the guinea pig :slight_smile:

If these are the same motors I was shown by a manufacturer last week which i believe strongly they are then the Urethane will slip just based off design. There are no grooves holding the PU in place only small 12  1/2 inch bolt grooves. around the motor can. They grooves do not go across the entire motor can. Just like 1/2 an inch. THey had a previous design which was identical to this and slippage was a problem. I told them to fix it and obviously they don't listen very well or understand the directions. :)   So.... would advise not to buy these. just saying..
However, if the new PU you guys have can lock over the motor you are in a solid buy mode :) gogogo

@Ralphy has pretty much solved the slipping urethane issues for me, just using his 3d printed nubs and sleeves. I'm sure his new 100mm tires won't disappoint either. I've been running these hubs on my Frankentrike, for a few months, and they've been rock solid. I'm not sure I could put them through any worse abuse on a skateboard. But I'll try!

1 hub was used for literally 1 mile tops, just around the block. Other unused. Will let go for £150, thats for both Hubs, and both the trucks that come with them.

@ralphy 
Did some more riding today on your 100mm's! No slippage and the ride quality is substantially improved from the extra cushion the thicker urathane provides.
 I still havent had a chance to clock their top speed yet but im very confident its well over 25mph. I did measure the top speed with the original 83mm urathane and it was 23mph on a 12S battery. 

I plugged the numbers into the eskate calculator and it predicts a 5mph increase from 83mm to 100mm wheels.

How many of you less aggressive riders would like to have these wheels without the locking plate and hardware? 

What price would you consider reasonable to pay for the set? 

I'm thinking some of you with time on your hands and small budget can fabricate the plates and possibly drill the urethane and epoxy in the rods, or just plain out ride without any additional reinforcement. 

I can still go up one more from 80a to 90a with the urethane.


For the 107mm I was thinking of dropping the duro down to 70a when anyone is ready to order.  

It will ride as smooth as the Abec 11.

You want just the motors. The trucks and front wheels arnt that good compared Paris trucks and abec11 wheels. 

They will probably include new urethane that's like harder than 90a. Probably like 60d. It will feel like a rough ride and eventually the phase wires break off the banana prongs.

Went for a other ride tonight. It hit 28mph. Lots of vibration at that speed though. I think the wheeels arent quite true. Im hoping it smooths out with more miles. It rides noce and smooth up to about 20-22mph though. Acceleration is pretty impressive, i was expecting less at my weight with the large diameter wheels. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/1/41b8dc82bab43ccc42ad8614ed58b419f60a0494.png" width="243" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/9/191df55d8e152ff847678adcc1977f5d91de8f9a.jpg" width="666" height="500">

Derek ,

28mph seems accurate. The ride should be smooth all the way through top speed. Your shipment was the first one and it was before the laser cut plates. You can send them back and I'll send you a new pair with laser cut plates and all. Ride them a bit more and get back to us.

So I spent a little more time on it today and it is actually a runout issue with the wheel. I held the wheels to the ground while doing a burn out of sorts and there was 1 section of the wheel that was a little higher. 60 secs later it pretty much smoothed out and the vibration at high speed is gone.

Right. Since its a 3d printed form it's hard for it to be perfect. As i recommneded a little burnout over smooth concrete that's moist solves all surface imperfections including the "joint".

Guys as we move into the 107mm wheel setup I was told by a client there are no affordable standard 107mm wheels for the front  in the market. I believe Abec 11 has them but they are over 100 bucks.

Guys one of the buyers yesterday experienced a rod coming off their urethane. Unfortunately it led to a total destruction of his entire setup. Although this hasn't happened to me in all my testing please inspect your rods and ensure your plates are secure before and after every ride. The rods are permanenantly bound to the urethane during the cast. Any attempt to alter the rods by turning them will break the bond and cause them to potentially displace laterally. Any impact with rocks or lateral hits against curbs can also break them free.

Sure price is $99 for the pair of 100mm wheels and $335 for dual motors with wheels installed.

Adding 2 trucks with rear motors mounted is $65. I use stainless set screws drill your truck dual insert for the screws and taper the trucks mating surface to avoid it cutting the motor wires.

The pair of 97mm clones in black with bearings are $35

Price includes shipping in the USA. International shipments add $40-55 depending on weight of items that you'd like to purchase.

For those that have gotten motors from me rest assured your getting the best not some old production. The stator core is ready fitted locked in place with clips and adhered with high temp epoxy. 

Windings are also very nicely done.

Enjoy and happy riding! <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/8/5/854825921c0a3047bc24d90e61d4414934735823.jpg" width="375" height="500">

Guys so production of these wheels will stop for about 3 weeks as i get re established on the Florida Gulf coast. 

If your concerned with the 3mm rods moving on the wheels do not use a regular hex nut on both sides of the rods. Use any epoxy adhesive including loctite professional grade super glue and or a "push nut" on eitber side 3mm or 3/32" should work. Dont push them tight just far enough in  to keep any potential lateral displacement minimal. Remember all these materials expand and contract so its essential to allow for that expansion and contraction. Attached is a pic of the push nut they should be avaliable in packs of 20 from grainger or zoro supply. Ride safe thanks for the support and feedback. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/6/a61f7c89f8a6792b3fb56a66c7ebc1a688c2eb13.png" width="331" height="500">

When you ride 500 miles on that 3d print core it will become a bunch of little pieces. Cracks and lossening around the plastic core will start at 150 miles approx.

Which fill grade do you have printed the core? And which material did you use? I uses PLA and fill 100 percent and had such a problem not. I very been driven one year with them and had no problem. On ABS I had a problem because this filament is not so good for PU. It lose the connection very soon because of low surface energy. It is a glue problem of the ABS. But for the negative Form ABS is good but I use there PLA too but with a Form Spray. I also increase the connection with vacuum. So the PU is pressed into the PLA. And you have no bubbles in the PU. Vacuum is crucial necessary for the wheels and the quality. I try to find a manufacturer for this wheels but I had to order a very large quantity and that is the problem actual. So I only can produce a small quantity at the moment in my tiny garage :-) I can send you some if you are interested in it

Ok, pla starts to deform at 110F and the motor gets to 130 F really easily. I dont understand how it is possible to not melt the pla core with extended use. 

Polycarbonate is more structurally resistent and heat resistant and it failed on me after several hundred miles. 

I cant test them since i moved and left my board behind but im sure others on the forum would like to test them.

Thanks

Yes that is right. I have a modified motor and truck connection that uses the truck as a heatsink. The surface is very large to transport the heat better to the truck. See attached photo. And I uses for me 4 wheel drive so that I get really quickly enough speed. At the low RPM the motor gets faster warm by current as by higher RPM. At higher RPM you have more like the AC than DC values of max current. So that is the reason why some manufacturers of in wheel boards reduces the current limit at low RPM. 
But there is a little tip to get more heat disperse to the truck by using the normal Jacob motor: verify that the gap between the motor and truck is absolutely clean and tight. The holes from drilling the torque bolts can cause a large gap e. G. Or the truck is not manufactured clean so that there is a little bit too much aluminum at the shaft... 
And you must put cooling paste like arctic silver on the shaft and between the truck and motor connection. And the alignments crew is to be secured with locktite! When this screw lose then the motor will be very soon too warm. 

But is is real recommend to use 4 motors that brings very much... Then the motors will stay cool and you have real fun with it. Hillclimbing is no problem anymore. Even when you are heavy like me. 

The PLA can handle this temperatures then. Maybe it depends on the PU resin manufacturer too. From which manufacturer do you have ordered the PU?

Hey mate, how is Florida? OK so after using the wheels in my secondary board for a few weeks I can report a few things. The diameter of the wheels is awesome and the motors seem to handle it without issue, they even feel more powerful than before somehow. The urethane is super hard, but that's OK I don't mind it too much if that means they will last forever. What worries me is that the rods are sticking out on the side by about 2mm, is that necessary? I find it impossible to completely avoid any side contact with a curb, sooner or later it will happen. And it did happen to me the other day, causing one of the rods to slightly bend. So to avoid worse happening in the future I was considering to try and cut off those ends that are sticking out, do you see any problems with that? Why are the sticking out in the first place?

Ok good to hear that. The rods stick out 2mm because thats thebonly way i can keep them in place during casting. You can cut them off with a grinder cut off wheel.  Dont take more than 5 sec per rod so they dont overheat. You can also add a plate to the outer surface for additional lateral protection. Keep us posted and ride safe!

Im no copyright law expert, but as the chinese wheels are different dimensions with a different tread patter and slot pattern and not for hub motors Im guessing you wouldn't have much of a case.  Anyways, solid wheels with slots have been a thing since the 20's, just ask Goodyear.

 I will only consider these wheels if they can be made as a regular skateboard wheel and not exclusively for an electric skateboard. The only thing I see with the usage of aramid fibers is strengthening of the wheels and decreasing rate of wear, but it can also be accomplished using fiberglass.

Who's interested in a set ? Price is $120 a set shipping included in the USA and like prior sets it will have the s.s. hardware and the s.s. plates. They will only have 4 rods per wheel unlike the 8 the 100mm had. <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/c/f/cf729874855276ce552e6d6e0773cc08650e3130.jpg" width="500" height="500">

No its without them. But i am working on a strategy to cast the clone front ones that are 97mm up to 114mm.

First prototype of the 114mm wheel. I feel good about this setup and looking forward to testing once i complete a full set to roll 114mm wheels all around. 

Screw the 107mm abec11 wheels we will have the BIGGEST BLACK ONES!

Yeah guys anyone can buy them I am just showing you my process. Im very curious about current draw at such a large diameter. Im also certain the urethane will last a long time and you can run the plate on the outside since there is so much urethane.

Fun Fact : My 100mm wheels after months of riding and burnouts and pure torture have been worn down to 99mm. Pics will follow tomorrow so you can see how the urethane is behaving and the actual diameter reading of 99mm on the caliper. 

YES alot of motors and wheels are coming out but I still have the biggest one! lol <img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/4/d/4dab8da351672b2525134e780723240f86b4f366.JPG" width="690" height="406">

What have you done to fix the issue of the threaded rods backing out of the urethane? Very dangerous design flaw that only took a few miles of riding to start happening.

## \#338 Posted by: ralphy Posted at: 2017-10-08T18:25:23.050Z Reads: 169

Well i wouldnt call it a design flaw. Some people have realized that the rods do not displace on their own. It takes a latteral impact to cause the bond to break. One person showed us how you can shave them down on the outside and i also recomemened you periodically inspect them visually. You can also use epoxy or retaining clips to prevent any displacment in the most extreme situations. 

Most importantly if you feel the design isnt suitable for your application buy the other manufactures products. The whole purpose of this thread is not for me to sell items but for everyone to offer design solutions you find useful for your motors.

Thanks for the input!

This is certainly not true. I rode my board all of 10 miles and the rods on both sides had moved laterally, some more than others (anywhere from 2-4mm). I can assure you that there was no lateral impact to those rods during that time. Luckily I caught it and decided to simply not ride them anymore out of fear that it would cause a major problem. I believe one user had them back out enough that they got caught up on the phase wires, shredding them, frying their VESCs as well. 

I'm certainly aware that I can just buy other products, which is exactly what I ended up doing. I just hoped that this problem had been addressed for future buyers. Fortunately I can take a $350 loss and write it off as a "learning process" without any real impact to my life, but other forum members aren't exactly in the financial situation that I am, and I want to ensure that they are aware of the problem (whether you consider it a problem or not) prior to purchasing, that's all. Or ideally, there would be a design modification that made my post completely irrelevant.

I'm all for supporting people with their DIY designs, but I like to think that when a flaw is identified that they will address it rather than continuing to sell it knowing of the "problem". This post isn't meant as an attack by any means. Moreso a push to keep innovating and improving, that's all.

Everyone is entitled to a full refund so im not sure about your learning expense allocation to my product.

Guys and Gals as many might know production of these motors stopped several months ago. Several of you are interested in the motors and I just wanted to let everyone know that the manufacture will be making more in the next couple weeks and I will also be producing the 100mm wheels. Repeat customers and resellers are welcome to buy and you can always get your money back if your unsatisfied for any reason. Its been great to hear all the positive feedback!<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/1/a13ef48bfe162cfc84269dce23f6e776edd467e9.jpg" width="666" height="500">2<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/0/90d9b7902e4198d647f36eeaad1a02b7a4e327e9.jpg" width="666" height="500">

It will take more than a urethane reformulation and some sensors to fix the problem these motors had with slipping and loose urethane. Without a new retention method like glueing them on or pouring the urethane onto a metal rotor sleeve these will end up with the same issues the first time you get the motors warm. Buyer beware.

In my opinion these maytech hubs are completely different and have nothing to do with jacob's hubs. They must have higher kv, because @adman told about 27 mph in FOC with 83mm urethane. The original jacob hubs have 60 kv and I get 22 mph using FOC with 91 mm urethane. I would like to see pictures from the inside of the hubs to see how they build in the sensors. Btw. I also implemented hall sensors in my jacob hubs, because in FOC they run crazy from the startup without sensors.

Higher KV is likeky to mske them run even hotter. 

All the sensored Chinese hubs Ive seen use a pcb at the back side on the stator.

Im pretty sure the urethane just slips over the can like 99% of the hub motors on the market. That design just doesnt hold up under weight, heat force.

Id love to hear some feedback if any of you have at 30-50 miles on these. I have many hundreds of miles on 10 different pairs of hub motors and all have them same problem with urethane to rotor adhesion/retention.

How did you implement a sensor in the Jacob hubs?

I believe these hubs have 6 nubs so they are less likely to slip completely out of place. I'm sure they will still loosen up in time but they may be more realiable. We can always make bigger urethane and some plates and rods for these. I just need the dimensions off someone who has them and I'll be happy to develop a solution if it's desired by the community.

35% rebound is extremely dead.  The urethanes that we make our APS 80a bushings out of are 64%

I'm trying to get in contact with Ralphy to buy more 100mm wheels. Has anyone heard from him? It looks like he hasn't logged into the forum since April 1st.

The last version of my wheels for the 83mm hub motor are in test since this summer by Dennis from Marburg (five month ago) - he made this video for my channel: https://youtu.be/jDEnipgUHBk
He is driving with them until today with no problems on a 4WD Hornetboard Hyper. He is my first Customer of this incredible strong board. 
On two motor driven setups the motors produce too much heat on hot asphalt so I decided to develop new motors with the double power to make wheels for 2wd setups. Now I am testing since two month my 100mm hub motors and they work very good. But for selling them with warranty there are more month tests necessary. Fabian from Germany has bought a prototype with 100mm hub motors one month ago and he is testing the power of them on a 4wd Hornetboard Hyper too. He has reached 60 kmh with them. The motors was at this test much colder as the 83 mm motors. I have now 65 kv and 80 kv versions. The 80 kv version is not tested because lack of time... But I guess they can reach over 70 kmh with them. Only for downhill drivers or speed junkies... 😉 That's the current status. You can follow my YouTube channel or Instagram to receive news in the future.

They are only five month in test with the 4wd and 83mm motors... One wheel cost me materials around 30 usd. For my 100mm hub motors is 2wd ok. The 100 mm wheels are around 38 usd material costs - but you need two vesc's less.
Here is the presentation of the 2wd setup of the 100mm hubs at the Makerfaire Hanover this autumn:
