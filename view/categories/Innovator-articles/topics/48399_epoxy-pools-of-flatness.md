So the other night I was dealing with a tough problem on a "commuter" build I'm working on. I couldn't figure out how to mate the Enerion enclosure I got with a battery to a cool Skateshred deck with rocker and funny concave. There just wasn't an easy way to get the two flush enough for even the rubber seal/gasket they sent with it. As you can see the deck has a unique rocker in it cresting near the front of the deck.

![20180225_142851|690x425](upload://habJ0TpTeZVxktKMw7hoHuTH1cV.jpg)

I stood there like a dumbass and decided to just give up and drink some beer. A local IPA from Track7 if you may know, it hit the spot!

Someone else in the forums posted a link to the perfect self adhesive foam gasket stuff to use on my other "skater" setup and I had that laying around. So I used small strips of it to build up a wall high enough to pool some 20-min epoxy. the idea here is to just get the deck level and then pour in a lot of epoxy and let it pool up and flatten out forming a perfectly flat surface for the enclosure to mount too!

I sanded the deck of course so it bonds well, traced the enclosure on the deck, cut out some foam filler to lay inside the epoxy to take up some extra volume and then blamo, I made this. 

![20180302_110751|666x500](upload://u3VGnaKlj6oiLjG0igiovWpt8uj.jpg)

I literally took an entire 2x bottles of 20-min epoxy and mixed them together in a cup and then poured it in, it was so simple in the end.

![20180302_110744|375x500](upload://qIKK1UOrsLgnt1UAvrmsoFFkpNF.jpg)

Of course the epoxy doesn't dry perfectly flat due to surface tension and it's sort of thick anyway. I let this cure about 3 days, even though 20-min epoxy says it cures in 20 minutes, that's just to harden, for it to really set up it needs at least 48 hours or so, be patient if you do this.

After I let it set for days and had some more beer I took off the foam "dam" I had built and used power tools like a madman to grind and smooth it to shape so it looked cool. And then I simply painted it. It was about here that I realized that embedding LED's into the epoxy would have been a great idea. So if you ever have a need to do this, and want a awesome and weatherproof place to install LED's that can be seen on all four corners, do that before the epoxy cures, ok?

Here she is mocked up for a glamor shot in her natural environment, no beer spilled and the mating problem fixed..on to the next step!

![20180307_073751|666x500](upload://dX3xP9G9ws1xrvunAycYmBjM1my.jpg)

I don't know what to call this method, I don't know if it's been done before. But I was pretty proud of my out-of-the-box approach of using a box to pool up epoxy, lol. I'll just call it epoxy pools and we'll open it up to testing, let's see if this crap holds and doesn't crack to pieces over time. I choose 20-min epoxy to hopefully get the best bond and avoid the brittleness of the 5-min stuff. I found flexible epoxy once, if you can grind and sand it, that might be even better.

@Jedi  
I will for sure post some pictures of the finished product...just not there yet...I will share as I progress through the project.

Next is to drill and put in some nice inserts (sex bolts) and find the right length hardware to account for the added depth that the epoxy added to the whole equation.

How much weight did it seem to add.. noticeable at all or not even?  I am having the same exact issue with my neversummer that just arrived today, and I already made a custom kydex enclosure that just wont work as it.. here is the link

https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/72370/never-summer-2017-covert-longboard-skateboard-deck-w-grip

Although there is a decent size of flat along the middle of the board, my enclosure extends further in width and becomes more narrow closer to the rear truck.  Wish I didn't already spend a couple days making a beautiful buck for and kydex enclosure which will be difficult to mount to this board.

Even attempting the epoxy pools may be difficult if you look closely at the bottom shape of my board you will see why.

So to report on the state of this method after 1k miles or so, IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM!

I took it to Vegas, Tahoe, San Fransico and it's been used in testing a few different sets of wheels including Kegals, 90mm flywheels in classic and now 97mm Reflys in Reflex thane. 

I have lost one screw from the enclosure during that time and had to replace it, I have never opened the enclosure or had to service anything yet. the epoxy is holding perfectly, no issues at all, no cracking or signs of wear as I use this setup as my primary commuter and joy ride toy...

That is a sick deck.

I wonder if you could make an inner dam as well as an outer dam to save on resin/weight, assuming you're only concerned with the perimeter.

[/quote]

Its actually the older Panasonic cell model, and in this setup I get 30 miles out of it...I am happy with it, but I have two buddies having issues with torque right now, we got 2 bad 30q 12s4p packs, they would not turn on unless you flipped the switch a bunch of times, possibly a faulty BMS and then another...they sent them back and we have been waiting for weeks. TB isn't very good on the communications and customer service, but the value in the products is there..also, every time I chat on their website, they tell me to send an email anyway it's like a trap, a chat that doesn't help much, so if you need to ask them anything, just go to email...

@squishy654 PM me your email or ticket numbers for the 12S4P that have issues. We'll get those resolved as soon as we can.

We just hired a few more people on our team so we're working on improving our support times. Sorry, it's been a bit slow lately.

So I sent a pm with three order numbers yesterday, nothing back, no eta, not even a communication back about it, but it was viewed. 

there's three local guys in Sacramento, pissed and waiting and about to throw in the towel due to lack of communication and integrity from the company. All they need to do is communicate and be honest, and that seems to be difficult for them and disheartening. I actually like some of the products, but if people cannot get them or they are faulty on delivery, then I have to lead by example and be honest about the facts. 

@torqueboards don't just pretend to be well intended, but display it through actions. If it's gonna take 3 weeks, tell the customer it will be three weeks instead of toying with them, not answering emails and giving excuses for three weeks...it's better to just be honest about the delays and shortcomings, you will get much more respect and patients for it...by now I'm sure those guys are sending hate mail and screaming...and they are justified if they still have literally no idea when they will see their stuff or their money back...this shit ain't cheap, when someone throws down 500 bucks for a battery...you should at least talk to them...

Putting this here. 
[quote="squishy654, post:35, topic:58563, full:true"]
Step 1: Mail something

Step 2: ?

Step 3: raise holy hell when it doesn’t show up, burn the place down, beat each other up.

Looks like par for the course…nothing new or innovative here…waste of a thread…it’s already in my FB feed and we all have our own F’ing personal problems with vendors or products, how about we keep them to ourselves you bitching spraylords…

Yeah I hate to complain about a company, and I really have no dog in the fight, I didn't even purchase anything, none of my orders with them are outstanding. this has to do with all the people in my town who do, are bugging me about it now...and I don't even work for DIY, I simply recommended them, now I'm catching crap for it and I'm not even involved...just making it known is all I am doing and passing on the numbers as requested...I didn't even get a "thanks, we got it" reply...nothing...so I now understand why people are bitching to me about it...this isn't calling out a scam or burning a company, it's a request for communication, with honesty and respect, out in the open (because it's where I like to do things).

Hi @squishy654 really good idea. Did you mount the inserts in the epoxy or in the deck?
I'm planning to do the same but to make an edge around the outline of my enclosure to get some more room inside. I'm planning to mount the inserts in the epoxy but I'm concerned if it will be too much load for the epoxy and if it's actually possible to mount the inserts in the epoxy. What do you think?

For anyone that is going to do it and will be using foam to make some walls for the epoxy, use some hard/solid foam with little air. I recommend using [this foam from aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1Roll-200-2cm-EVA-Single-Sided-Adhesive-Tape-Weather-Sticky-Stripping-Sponge-Foam-Rubber-Strip-Neoprene/32818859998.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.641b4c4dJBZ4MT). Rember to buy enough :slight_smile: 

Don't stretch the foam when you apply it, otherwise it will be completely out of shape the next day.

The same epoxy @squishy654 used can also [be found on Hobbyking](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/finish-cure-20-min-epoxy-glue-4-5-oz.html) :slight_smile:

hey @squishy654!

How did you mount the inserts in the deck? I tried to do it but I had to make the hole bigger to get the screw down and it's impossible to get the screw back  up after you have inserted the insert.

---

I find it weird that the some of the epoxy is 100% transparent while the other is white and impossible to see through. Does anybody know why? Air bubbles?

My advice to get the epoxy somehow flatter is Vibration ;) there are plenty possibilities to construct/buy something. You could just even Hammer the Board next to the epoxy to flatten it out and get some air bubbles up/out of it

I think it has something to do with the influence of air. Every hidden Part looks invisible and the top Part looks milky.
A mold has normaly only one small injection hole. But i dont know for Sure

I just saw a guy that used a blowtorch to heat some epoxy up really short to pop all the bubbles. A heatgun might work as well.

I finally managed to get mostly rid of the air bubbles. There is a few tricks I want to share.

1. Put the two bottles of epoxy and hardener in hot water (Above 35 Celsius. I didn't read the temperature of my water, but it was a bit above my body temperature)
2. Mix the epoxy and hardener slowly together.
3. Let the epoxy sit for 3-5 minutes (depending on what epoxy you use) after you have mixed it. That will make most of the air bubbles disappear.

btw. You can also use an heat gun instead of blow torch to remove some of the bubbles, but that will make the epoxy move a bit around.

This picture was taken after I had mixed the epoxy like some crazy guy. There was a bit less bubbles before :slight_smile:
