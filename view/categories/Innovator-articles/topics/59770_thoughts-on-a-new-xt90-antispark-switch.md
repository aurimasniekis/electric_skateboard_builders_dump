Hello, I've been drawing up a "button" for a XT90s antispark switch during the day and i'm just finished with the first draft of it.

**So I turn to you guys now and ask if this is something you would use?**

The shell for it is a bit on the large side coming in at **49mm x 54mm** without the button, the button has neodymium magnets so when it's opened it will stay attached to the front shell.

The thought is that it will be mounted on the inside of your enclosure and only the button will stick out and when turning it on it will be in a recessed state and when it is turned off it will be in a protruding state.

First image is next to a 18650.

Could depend on the gauge of the cable. Iâ€™ve been riding around for the past hour ( just started to rain ffs) and mine is not even a hint of warm

"too stoned to construct a sentence apparently"

Hahaha. I feel the same most days.  

Great idea @Hannes. I'll buy a few when you finish them. I've always used an anti spark and  and power button. This can cut both out.

I've found that it takes a lot of force to pull an xt90s out, how does this switch handle going from on to off position?

I think with an AS150 you could have made a cleaner and simpler design. There is no need to go for 4 solder joints in total when the entire plug is hidden anyway. @Deckoz designed something similar if I remember right. Maybe you should work together on this?

I'll release it on thingiverse so it will be free if you have a 3d printer :)

Currently trying to get rid of the magnets so it can be as simple as possible and also reducing overall size of it..

Yes, that is something I have to experiment with when I get my connector, it's currently in shipment.

But it is something i have in mind, i have tried pulling the "button" part quite hard against the lid and i have not destroyed it yet. but yes, I will have to look into it further when i get my connector. It needs to be able to handle a smack from the connector when pulling out ;)

Is it [this one](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/7mm-as150-anti-spark-self-insulating-gold-bullet-connector-2-pairs.html?___store=en_us) your are thinking of? I'll have to look into that, can always do both :) but for now most people seem to have the xt90-s so it's my priority right now :) 

Also cost is an issue, to get something like this valuable it needs to be at a much lower price than the vedder anti spark switch and if you start adding "not widely used" connectors + a 3d printed parts + shipping (cheaper if they have their own 3d printer and make their own) + all other hidden costs you end up with a product that wont be that far of a much nicer switch.

Only problem is it would be harder to make a button version with an as150 bullet than an xt-90

In my tiny mind the AS150 version would kinda look like two match boxes together with one draw pushed between the connected sleeves for on and off positions.

Well perhaps but nothing is impossible :slight_smile:
But the size difference wont be that different, I could save a couple of mm with the AS150.


Atleast if these dimensions are correct

You can make XT-90s or any of the push on connectors like that easier to slide in and out by squeezing the pins on the plugs with some needle nose pliers.  It's a bit of a balancing act, but you can push them out from the middle by squeezing the pliers into the hole in the center of the connector, for the most part it's the tension in the metal parts holding the connector together the plastic creates very little friction by itself.

It's an interesting idea for sure... I think I like being able to take my XT-90 with me though as a sort of a key, someone could still just jack the board but I like that they see me remove something from it when I walk away for a minute and gives me peace of mind it can't accidentally get connected somehow.

AS150 update, i've been switching to the AS150 for now since we can make a much nicer and smaller footprint holder for them.

The AS150 connector, does anyone have any concerns with something? if you do please write them down and tell me so i can improve the design to make it as bulletproof as possible.

My greatest concerns with these sort of switches is the plastic gripping the connector wearing out and then you're stuck with an always on switch.
Might be worth thinking of small metal collars which surround the connector around specific points. These collars will give the plastic bigger surface areas to work against for better durability.

Since the as150 is threaded a thread insert might be worth looking at, then some locktite. M9 thread insert.

Will look into it further :)

Hi again, i'm currently looking at the height of the slide button and how far out it should be protruding from the enclosure, so **I would like to know how thick your enclosure are?** 

My estimate is approx 3mm thick on most ABS enclosures.

And with current design the slide will be protrude 7mm, would you want it to be more? would you want a visible or hidden approach?

First prototype assembled, some tolerances to change otherwise OK,

I'm actually back at the drawingboard after realizing how much force that is needed to connect these kinds of connectors.

So therefore I'm back at a push style instead of slide and back at xt90-s, so currently the thing on my 3d printer atm actually is an almost regular looking panel mount for xt90s but with a feature where after/during connection you recess the loopkey inside the enclosure to make it less visible/protruding.

I'll try to make a more informational rendering tomorrow after i get some sleep :)

Size inside enclosure are, 39x46x22mm

So this is the latest design using the XT90-S connector, the design on this holder is to recess the xt90 loopkey after insertion and hiding it inside the enclosure. 

The holder uses 6 neodymium magnets to hold the connector in either recessed position or protruding position. And currently the fastening of the connectors inside the 3d printed part is done via superglue and friction.

Currently the fastening to the case are done via 4 m3 screws, the part will sit inside the enclosure for now, no collar.

The only thing sticking out of the board in a powered on state is the little head with a bit of a texture to it.

A few more pictures

https://i.gyazo.com/d449630d80dd06e5e28ba7ca3f17623d.png

So the thing now that i'm waiting for before releasing something is to get my wires from hobbyking(10awg) and solid copper wire (10awg) and soldering the connector to make sure that the cable wont pinch when recessing the connector.  I'm also waiting to get my board together (battery and enclosure coming this week) to test it out and see if it actually works in a real life environment.

Thats a neat solution :slight_smile:

Something i've been wondering about is how far away you need to "store" the connectors in a design like that, is it a possibility that they will spark if they are too close? and what is too close?
