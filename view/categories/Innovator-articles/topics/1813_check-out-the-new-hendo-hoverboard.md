Check this out Hendo released their original ugly looking board to the public a while ago, but this is newly released with a pretty hefty price tag.

The easiest way to do it (that i can think of ) is to make it front wheel drive lol. Putting motors on that assembly would be difficult unless theyre hub motors

I was just thinking about using 4 of these sets with Carvon V4's.  Wow, if the Evo 4WD can do 45+, this setup could probably do like 80+???

They don't even list the maximum wheel size or anything.  This is unusable unless someone bought one and measured it.
