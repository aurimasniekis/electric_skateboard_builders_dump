```
The receiver that plugs into the ESC has a tiny spot to solder the batt+ to. Once done, the voltage info is sent to the remote.

So just a wire from the positive wire on the battery to that small spot on the receiver?

Yes that's correct,  a small awg similar to that used for your balance wires would be fine.

Also just to mention, the unity has a small battery aux port that this can be conveniently tied to I found out.

Im loving this remote.   I feel the same way with received  feedback. "This remote makes the ride more fun when reliability helps out."

Hi Eileen,
Can you please tell me the what the current draw from the receiver through the 42v battery terminal is?
```

## \#14 Posted by: Battosaii Posted at: 2019-02-20T16:57:29.203Z Reads: 72

Only 42v so it won't work on 12s?
```

It can be connected to 3-14s. The words 42V was printed wrong. We will correct it in next production.

Building my "on board" wireless charger for the remote, rough prototype in the works, but looks promising, more to come....

Bit of a crappy print, but it's a prototype, so not being too fussy

With and without power
