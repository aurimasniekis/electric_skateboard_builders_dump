Loaded has just announced the loaded motherboard deck! Email reads as follows: You’ve got a dirty mind. It’s time to get your hands dirty, as well. The future is electric! The future is you! The future is now! Well, it’s actually n‌ext Tuesday. But we’re giving you a sneak peek right here: O‌n Tuesday, J‌anuary 15th we’ll be launching the limited-editionLoaded Motherboard deck. Designed specifically for the rigors of electric skateboarding, we created the Motherboard to celebrate the growing Do-It-Yourself e-skate community. Whether you’re an experienced e-board builder or just like putting your fingers in electrical sockets, we’re here to help (at least with technical questions—not so much with the psychological stuff). Pick one up, slap some motors and batteries on it, and ride away into the sunset. The only thing we ask is that your post pics of your builds using the hashtag#LoadedMotherboard and share your feedback with us. The Motherboard will be available only in a very limited run and only atloadedboards.com. Additionally, we're offering it at a discounted rate to help stimulate DIY e-skate and foster creativity. Based on your feedback, this (or some version of this design) may eventually become a standard board in the Loaded lineup. More info to come next T‌uesday. Stay tuned here and/or check out our website and social media next week for more details.

I've been saying (on record here and other places) that Loaded are going to be moving into the eBoard scene.  I fully expect they will release their own electric skateboard in 2020.  They are seeing the growth in this hobby of ours and looking at how they can get in on the action.  It started with the Caguama, that has been massively successful for loaded and now this - all the power to them they make awesome shit.

Loaded know how to make a deck, I own two of them and have electrified one (Icarus). Very clever to offer it at a discounted price and ask for feedback from those that know what they are doing (us) with a view to add this to the permanent line up after the feedback.

So the only question is whose going to get one and send it to @Eboosted? 😂

I'm going between 2 and 250. Also I had some ideas of some cool options for the deck in terms of it being aimed at esk8. I thought maybe it has some groves cut out for running cables through or maybe having some special grip that like the one they showed in the insta pictures.

Yeah freggin right.

They are using us for free R&D.

They haven't done shit all.

1. Release their "esk8 deck" into the wild.  

2. Watch this forum for what we do with it.

3. Make the best builds the blueprint for an e board they launch in 2020 or 2021

They will release an eBoard for sure - traditional longboarding is on the wane and us electric weirdos are growing.

I don't mind the free RnD tbh, I like Loaded as a brand I think they make sick stuff.  I will waiting for some more details of this.  If it's not special in anyway I'll leave it but if it has features for us I'll grab one

* Wheel well flares to accommodate large wheels and promote board awareness
* TPU-reinforced composite construction for vibration damping and durability
* Camber for suspension and enhanced component clearance

It seems the thing is that they don’t know what they are doing leaving traditional deck design do they made what they believe is a core that builders will want to rock some cool builds out of, this is all well and fine however it is no longer 2017 and you need to have integration or and enclosure at least to foist it as an esk8 specific deck.

Wonder if loaded are going to represent here more than the cross-link. I likez their productz but must try harder

The TPU-reinforced composite construction is a nice add on, however it applies to all decks.
The cambered construction means it is targeted towards low speed builds.
One stiffness only?
Wheel well flares increase clearance for larger wheels (up to 85mm with Paris 180mm 50° trucks) :rofl::rofl::rofl:

There is nothing in that deck that screams esk8. No integrated enclosure, no front - rear angle split, no cabling management etc.
Plus, IMO it does not look as nice as some of their other decks.

Bold enough to cross-link they should represent here and do a proper builder discount code & inveigle.

Otherwise this is essentially confused corporate faff ordered by the management team as to why they aren't getting any of that esk8 market he's been hearing about.

The responsibility would appear to have fallen into the hands of someone who does not really understand where esk8 is at and the value placed on design innovation, either that or rushed out.

Other traditional skate companies have have made the transition to enter this market with more grace capitalizing on what they do know & learning what they don't to create desirable products...Riptide, Drangboards to name a couple.

Shame, Loaded make nice stuff.

Looks like an Icarus shape, with new cut ..?

> Purpose built for e-boarding:
>

Vang. or Ica. are better with their shape for wheel well ..

> * TPU-reinforced composite construction for vibration damping and durability

Last Loaded board already get cork layer (in last layer, under board) as damping for the comfort and to attenuate the vibrations thus ...

> * Camber for suspension and enhanced component clearance
The Loaded Motherboard: a perfectly poised platform for your next DIY electric skateboard.

... here also, flex and not flat under-surface are not really best DIY friends but ok. (This is all the difficulty for a beginner or experienced DIYer) to make an electric board and enclosure DIY to get it flexy, water/dust-proof etc.) 
Just my opinion ^^

We should let them know what esk8ers look for in a deck. @longhairedboy, @psychotiller and @onloop should talk to them about it because their names are mentioned on their website. 

I'll start with what I need
1. Cutouts for 10s5p + battery + bms + 2 esc
2. Predrilled holes for enclosure
3. Channels cut for motor wires   
4. Optional: enclosure option. Single stack(5p) or staggered stack(9p)
5. If they make it splash proof enough to ride in rains, I'll give them all my money.

Don't worry, i'm already on it. They sent me this deck a few weeks ago and asked me to "do something with it" but not to share it or post it. 

Honestly, i don't think they're going to like my write up, and its going to take me a minute to "do something" with this because of the deck's overall weirdness. 

also they wouldn't send me a second deck to carve into to make a proper plug for a mold, so i'm having to do it the hard way. And even if they had, i doubt the texture is consistent from deck to deck so the bumps would have to be shaved anyway. 

I was going with a 12S3P + Unity on this because i wanted a single layer. They sent me Caguamas and bushings also, but i'm probably going to go with a carvon rear end and some Abec 97s instead.

Ladies and gents of loaded. When you read this thread please keep in mind that most people here area  big fan of loaded. Boosted boards got a lot of us into this one way or another and there's thousands of loaded esk8s already flapping around here.

We want to see you succeed in a big way, it just needs to be the right product. Active engagement in the forum and with our premium builders is a must if you want some serious non fanboy feedback. 

Keep at it!

Perhaps they were going for the Boosted style, with split enclosures and smaller wheels... Which is confusing with the callouts to our vendors.

For this feature set, I'm priced out, even at the intro price.

It is for loaded but its not a big discount.

I honestly (as a big fan of Loaded with my DIY Icarus) think they messed up here.  Its not a good shape, it doesnt have any eskaing specific features that you cant find on any other boards and its just not "special" enough for me to choose it over building on another Loaded deck such as the Icarus, Vanguard, poke or Tessy.

Loaded, build a deck with wire channels, the ability to easily add an enclosure (maybe work with @Eboosted) big wheel wells and either a cruiser or downhill style shape instead of what looks like a dancer and you are on to something.

Oh and my picture of my Icarus made the Loaded advert! 🤣🤣

I like loaded decks, got 5 of them, sold 3. My first serious build was using their deck to build a replicate of the Boosted back in 2016. We all know that each of their deck is a lot of money for what it is and this has already been covered for years and discussed over and over. We are all mostly paying the communication team and the new dancing movement which is highly lucrative. But man, this is where you see that communication, videos does not always match the expectations of a market. I really think that even if it looks cool, it does not fit my needs or riding style but I can understand that some will pull the trigger because it's cool to have a new deck. 

I don't know why they didn't reach out to a ESK8 builder or at least someone that understand what we are talking about to adress the minimum requirements and factor that in the design phase of the board like they did for the dancing with my buddy Lotfi... which came out to be a dope deck for dancing/freestyling called the Tarab.

I'm not going to buy this, and if I got one offered... probably do a giveaway but I won't keep it.

Yeah I think are scared to make battery cut outs, wire channels etc because it might intimidate the avg person looking to get into diy esk8. I think they wanted to catch a broder market. This maybe marketed toward people that want a longbaord right now and maybe thinking about getting to esk8 later In the future. Just my guess.

I've loved all the Tesseracts I've had, and this board would be no different I'm sure. 
But to call it esk8 specific is just crazy. From such a credible company I'm really surprised and disappointed. I must add, I'm sure I could, "do something with it'

Reminds me of a very rare, obscure deck that was produced in New York a while back called the ANVL Hanzo:

I think loaded feels pushing on the esk8 since the commercial success of their sale of the blue kegel & Caguama, that visibly they had not anticipated.
It may also be to boost a boosted board (ahah) who dropped them on his new model.
Personally the shape of the board does not excite me more than that.
To see if at least it does not have wet feet when driving on wet :) Indeed a passage of cable would have been a plus, and have no concave under a portion of the board to make it more easily intgable with the boxes would have been better.

The deck design & construction values are sweet, I bet it handles.

I guess they are going to leave it to DIY scene to figure everything out, but it's such a shame they did not try make any integration for electronics. I wish they would go back with this design and make an in-house mod at least using the current construction as a base. As such that was kind of backing away from a challenge to present this as a blank canvas, which shows a bit of a lack of imagination & desire for innovation. 

Sure maybe Bigben, Eboosted, Longhairedboy & Pyschotiller etc will make an enclosure at some point, but it will not look like something from the future of esk8, no reflection on the great enclosures these guys make but it will be really, really difficult to tack something on and make it look like something from the future, that is my supposition, I hope I'm wrong maybe someone has game for it. 

That is the shame and it is a contradiction to the main premise that they have fun with in the product video 'The Future', the vid is funny in a good way.

Ive been waiting to comment on this, hoping there was something I missed.  I dont see a single thing that makes this better for esk8 than a poke or a vanguard, in fact it appears to be worse with the weird bottom coat.  I mean, if it doesnt have cable routing and an enclosure at a minimum, whats the point?  I think loaded either missed the point entirely or they have something else in the works.  I hope its the later.

I'm speaking to Ethan at Loaded about a lot of this stuff.  They are sending me a care package with a few bits in it and have opened up dialogue as I already have a full custom build on a Loaded deck.  They are very interested in understanding our requirements and I intend to go back to them with a comprehensive report covering a load of points I think are relevant.

They are reading this forum too so make your points known, they are not affraid to read any cold hard truths at all.

Here is a quote from their email

"With the Motherboard, we are actually very thankful for the honest feedback from the DIY community. There are many minds at work here in the HQ, with everyone having different opinions about how a board should look and feel for this particular application. We are definitely lacking the insight of a true DIY e-builder, since all of us come from a downhill, dancing, or carving background."

They are very receptive which is really nice! And yes they have a load of stuff in the works, some of which I am sure we are going to find very interesting.

I personally don't like this deck. The deck has these huge wheel cuts, or whatever they're called, and that ain't gonna help anyone. Ppl with eboards usually have their trucks **tighter** than normal so we avoid speed wobbles.

(slightly OT here, but)
I'm not sure how other ppl ride their boards, but I ride with my trucks as loose as possible. 

Max speed of my build is 28 mph, so maybe loose trucks are not good above those speeds (?), but I believe a good choice of bushings, trucks and a good stance is a better way to eliminate wobbles going these speeds.

What I'm getting out of this deck now (Electric dancers)  I'd say with all that clearance for motors and big ass wheels for hard carving cruisers..like the evolve ppl could swap there street to A/T set ups to inward mounting for cleaner set..and diy gears drives are looking pretty slick for a application like this

Is there potential to run that deck in a drop through configuration with that clearance? The motors hitting the deck is the only reason you can't run front mounted motors in drop through.

I could be wrong, but my clown feet get in the way of alot of boards 😴😴 either they hang off or I have to angle them and alter my riding stance 🤔

Agreed, there's plenty of room for improvement.  Considering they claim to want to build decks for the DIY community, you would think that they would have representative on the forums like Brian from @Hi5ber.  Or maybe they are lurking...

To be perfectly honest that deck while its growing on me has about as much to do with esk8 as a polar bear.  The easiest way to get into the esk8 market with decks is just to offer an esk8 version of every deck you make.  Wire channels and grip seperate.  Easy peasy.  They already produce decks that are used on builds all the time so just make it easier is all they should do at this point.  I'd like a vanguard please mr loaded.  Would you sir?  Marvelleous would you like that esk8 or analog?  Esk8 please sir and I thank you.

I love loaded, own 4. But will most likely never make any of them motorized because I prefer to carve and enjoy them at a slower pace then electricfied versions. (Unpopular option) The motherland looks like an awesome deck but I was hopping something different without the classic loaded flex, closer to the chubby with locking footstop wheelwells (not the taco ones) that can fit larger wheels, loaded is close but not quite there for the perfect deck.
