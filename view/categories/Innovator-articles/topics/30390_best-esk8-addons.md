After completing your board, chances are you added some novelty features, such as head lights or grip tape art. Now, I’m not looking for any technical innovations like a ramped up motor, more either aesthetic or original. I’m looking for some inspiration, as are many others I’m sure, so if you have added something cool and/or unique to your board, please share it! Describe it please, and pictures are very welcome.

This could be a very cool thread. 
I wanted a more aesthetic look for my grip rather than just a sheet of grip. Here is my work in progress so far. Will be finishing the board with black.

Here is one I did a few months ago. I drew on the grip tape with paint pens and it is still crystal clear.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/0/105a223d3890912aa745f3806e2d66b407c72327.png" width="690" height="388">

Bluetooth module the @Ackmaniac firmware. The Android app is great for telemetry and legacy ride data.
