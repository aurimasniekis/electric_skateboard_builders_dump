We are working at the moment on custom Caliber hanger and I have a question regarding the length of hanger what are your thoughts about 230mm, 240mm and 250mm hangers?

I always wondered why nobody did this.

I think we need them so they fit (all variants of) 6374s, anything longer is too much.

I would also make sure the profile is the same as the original Caliber, there are a lot of motor mounts available for it and it would be a shame if some wouldn‚Äôt work due to a different thickness of the hanger.

We will be making in 0.75" I guess not sure but mainly its for our drives and maybe even belt mount :)

Don't the 218mm hangers already fit 2 6374 motors?

there's been problems with these extended hangars breaking.  not sure what material you'll be using but ensure it's at least at strong as TB's 218mm.

Not sure how far the axle goes into the TB218, but if you were to make a longer precision one maybe just long enough to accommodate dual 6384 and any makers drives or 20mm pulleys. You could go safe on it and either run the axle straight through for ultimate no flex or quite deep

Oh and sell them individually, do a bulk run for lowest price you can, a precision baseplate option may be welcome depending on price, Randal degrees - 39?/44/50

8mm is already weak on 218mm
If you extend it further, you have to extend the axle diameter too.

Yeah check out Surf Rodz options on sickboards, 200mm hanger + they have an 80mm axle(not on sickboards)

Oh and there is the possibility to make a mount ring/adapter which either forms the basis for a drive or simple motor mount, look at pychotillers clamp for surf rodz

Definitely interested in a set that pairs with the carvon speed drive r footprint. 
Would like to see a hanger that doesn‚Äôt use a spacer to compensate for the longer axle.

Also it should have decent axel length, the 218‚Äôs have 48mm axel I think, which gives you a lot of mounting freedom for different wheels / pulleys etc. and surf rods have options up to 70mm

Longer hangers are not the answer... the rest of the skate world that is handling orientated is narrowing hangers! :boom:
Use the fact you have cnc **_precision_** and develop a bevel gear system!
Narrower hangers can get you more grip & a decreased turn radius.

What is the point of longer hangers? Look at the longboarding community: pro downhill longboards don't increase hanger length for stability, in fact they are narrowing.

For esk8 I like the flexibility of bigger motors and flexibility of street/AT setup. Longer hanger allows for that. Do wider hangers/axels make it less stable at high speeds?

Maybe so but larger axel width for bigger guys helps with durability and Larger axel width help for landing if one chooses to go airborne.

Both trampa and MBS appear to have 10mm and 12mm axels at least for EMTB.

Make the axle long enough to fit an extra bearing!

everything longer than the 218er TB trucks, i would trust an 8mm axle.
Sure it¬¥s a bit strange if you still wanna use normal longboard wheels, but for pneus, it¬¥s definitely a good thing and suiting bearings are easy to source.

Im gonna go with 240mm as this should be wide enough for dual 80mm motors and 15mm belts. With 50mm axels.  

Or got 220mm with 80mm long 10 diameter [shoulder bolt](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/5-Pieces-M8-Threaded-10-x-80mm-12-9-Grade-Alloy-Steel-Hexagon-Socket-Head-Shoulder/32761108203.html?spm=2114.search0104.3.76.1a4675d1pJqsLx&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_3_10152_5722917_10151_10065_10344_10068_10342_5722817_10343_10340_10341_5722617_10696_10084_10083_10618_10307_5722717_10059_306_100031_10103_5722517_10624_10623_10622_10621_10620,searchweb201603_6,ppcSwitch_5&algo_expid=72d7a3e5-273a-4ed0-a098-ffa620353b4f-12&algo_pvid=72d7a3e5-273a-4ed0-a098-ffa620353b4f&priceBeautifyAB=0) axles, similar to surf rods. Some amount of the bolt inside the truck.

I'd be Happy just by having 218 trucks in EU at an affordable price.
