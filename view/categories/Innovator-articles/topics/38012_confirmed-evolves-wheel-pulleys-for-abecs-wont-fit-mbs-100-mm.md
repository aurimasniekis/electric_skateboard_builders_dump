Went to Last Mile in San Fran today wanting to solve a myth: if Evolve's wheel pulleys for ABECs also fitted MBS 100 mm wheels?

Sadly I got to tell you guys that they don't fit. The Evolve pulleys made specially for ABEC hubs come with slighly wider spokes which can not fit the narrow openings inside the MBS 100 mm wheel hubs. They did not universally fit both brands. Case closed.

Call me lazy but I love plug and play.
