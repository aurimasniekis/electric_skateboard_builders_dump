Hi Folks.

Today I am going to reveal a small insight to the HUB motor I have on hand at the moment. I have this set of Hub motor for a while and I have them opened for inspection. This is a Chinese made Hub motor, possibly the best I could found out there. As you might be familiar to the look, yes this comes from lofty ambition.

Since I am so curious about HUB motor, I decided to buy 1 that is already finished. Note: this is probably not the best Hub motor out there as they are Humie and Carvon and others. However I weight only 60kg's and The Netherlands big cities have no hills to climb. Nevertheless I need hub motor that is completely sealed due to the constant rainy weather in The Netherlands. In short this Hub motor fits my budget and condition, so I decided to get them and test them.

Note: The cover have been painted in black since I don't like the shiny things over my build and the bolts have been replaced with an anti-rust bolts.

Below are some of the photos

**My Thoughts:**
 1. In overall quite well build, however it's not recommended for people who consider them self heavy as the hub motors sits on a small rectangular spot on the truck to counter the rotational force of the hub motor as well as to keep them aligned with the ground.
 2. It doesn't get hot spinning full speed without load on 6s, however it could get pretty hot with serious load, speed and distance / hills.
 3. They are weather sealed good for rainy weather and lower maintenance, however heat could be a problem for some.
4. The urethane are replaceable, I have some spare which is nice!
5. They are 90mm in size, quite large and could definitely handle some obstacles.
6. They are equipped with hall sensor (you can see it from the photos), which is good to help starting from static.
7. They are very quite running on RC grade ESC compared to my satellite configuration. I wonder how silent it would be with VESC FOC mode.
8. Not bad for the price. 350 euro with all of the cost of tax and cosmetic upgrade I did.

@mostwanted Yea I think it have 24 stator, if I am not mistaken what stator means (normally stator is situated at the outside ring, but because this is outrunner it could be in the inside). Not quite sure why this Hub motor have 24 instead of 12 like what you think. Not sure what are the implications, but logically it should be smoother with higher torque.

Well I didn't build this Hub motor, I bought them. Off course when ordered alot it could be rebranded and modified to further improved the design. To be honest there are things that could be improved within this Hub motor, but it requires me to order like between 20 - 100 of them. PS I also don't like the colors :smiley:

@barajabali Not quite sure what weight it could handle, I haven't even mount this yet on my board. From my bench test I could see the potential of carrying my weight. I could safely say it have more power than single belt driven 190kv motor. The torque on Hub motor would be less than belt drive, however most people on hub motor here will be running dual Hub motor. Starting torque should not be an issue, also especially with the added Hall sensors. I have to say the torque of brushless outrunner are relative to the speed they are rotating. They are designed to run on certain rpm to be able to output their maximum torque. So climbing hills slowly seems not to be an option for these motors.

@Evan yes that is definitely a good idea. Today I just did a soak test, there are traces of water within the lip of the cover. However it didn't get into the hub yet. Nevertheless there aren't things that could be damaged badly from a brushless outrunner even placed under water (besides the hall sensor).

One thing to add. It seems that these bearings are not easy to replace or even unreplaceable. So the entire cover of the bearing and the plate have to be replaced. That doesn't seems to be a a real big issue after all. The only 2 things I don't really like from this Hub motor are the wobble and the heat that could build up.

Thanks for showing.  The stator has 24 teeth. Nice for torque. 

 I wonder how many volts you could do with the vesc though as so many teeth will increase the commutation speed necessary per rotation.  Maybe.  Not a typical 12x14 pole motor 

If the bearings are a slide fit and not a press fit Id get some "retaining fluid" and make them solid especially if the shaft is aluminum. 

Is the shaft the bearing sits on steel or aluminum?  Looks like steel.  Maybe heavy but good thing to have. 

What wobbles?  The motor or the motor on truck square?  I'd put retaining fluid on every interface.
```

To be honest I don't know about the bearings sittings, wether they are glued welded and or fitting fit. However the connections have to be pretty strong as they have to handle torsional load from our weight, cruising vibration, hitting obstacle and or other thing that would make it come loose.

@evan Yes the axle is only a long bolt, with about 1 cm insertion to the truck axle. This is the weakest point of this hub motor as I could see it. If I mount both bolt without the hub motor, I could see that they are slightly bend to the side of the road. However if the hub motor is installed, those flat spot with the rectangular joint from the truck axle and the hub motor makes the mounting of the hub motor feels more horizontal again, only small wobble occurred which I don't think within 6s configuration is a problem.

@hummie I believe the metal piece of the bearings are aluminium (based on color and temperature), although most skate bearings I have were steel covered. The metal plate that holds the bearing are pretty thick (if you see the photos I have above). The other weak point of this hub motor is that both cover plates of the hub motor are being hold by 12 small 2.5mm hex bolts that are only 6mm in length. Yes they are short and very hard to be thighten and they will need to withstand all of the load. So not tightening this properly will cause the hub motor to be rotating in an awkward direction. Could cause stress to the motor on high speed and load. As far as I could sense from my bench test, one side of my hub motor that are more wobbly gets slightly hotter than the other side. Yes I would put retaining fluid everywhere when I have test this hub motor with my build so I know where are the stress points.

Once u put retaining fluid on it makes the bearing as hard to remove as a press fit so be careful. 

I'm a bit confused by your answer ...are the bearings resting on steel on their inner and outer surfaces or aluminum?  The plates and the shaft.

@evan I dont think this Hub motor could be fitted into a standard longboard axle. Although the hub motor have big holes to fit the entire wheels to a longboard axle, the nuts that holds the motor / wheels wouldn't be able to handle the torsional load given by the hub. Thats the reason why small rectangular flat spot exist there. I also dream of the same thing, it would be nice to have hub motor that could easily fit into standard caliber 2 trucks by extending the back metal part of the hub motor to fit into the D shaped hanger to counter the torsional load. I believe this will add cost to the production, but definitely achievable.

What other thing I noticed is that these hub motor are 5.5cm in width. It's 0.5cm wider than standard 90mm longboard wheels which is around 4.5cm to 5cm. So in case the additional metal could be added to fit into the D shaped hanger to counter the torsional load, the nuts have to placed / lock deeper inside the hub motor as the axle of standard caliber 2 trucks are shorter compared to the length of the bolt used by this Hub motor.

Well I don't think this is a big issue in the end, as a matter all of the hub motor being sold or created nowdays also being sold with the truck axle as well. What is more important in this construction is that the Chinese factory have to use larger bolt size, making sure they are aligned perfectly when the hub are mounted with the truck axle, uses longer M2.5 hex bolt (instead of 6mm use 1cm or longer), better urethane that have perfectly rounded shape.

I believe wobble is always something which very hard to encounter on hub motor. The metal part could be perfectly round, but the urethane could have different softness on certain spot especially they are quite thin compared to a standard round 90mm longboard wheels.

Still in overall I am quite satisfied with the overall build with that price point.

@Hummie The inner and outer side of the bearing seems to be aluminum while the rim that holds it in place is definitely steel.

I've also just noticed they are 110kv, which means larger torque.
But yea I don't know how how they wound the motor with what diagram.
So performance wise with other hub motor with similar specifications in real life condition are questionable.

110kv for a hub motor, especially with a wheel so big...I ride 100kv with 80mm diameter wheel and on 12s easily hits 35mph


I'm still confused by your answer.  Please bear with me.  The bearing itself is surely all steel. The two parts the bearing sits against , the shaft and housing, are they both steel?

@hummie Hmm okay if you say so, I am not a metal expert but it make sense that the bearings are steel. The shaft and the  housing is definitely steel both back and front cover. They are really heavy, I mean seriously heavy.

I am not sure why you asked this, but I believe they should be made out of very strong material. The cover of the hub motor act as a rim. They are the one responsible to hold the load of the board. They have to be very round in order to keep the small gap between the stator axle and the permanent magnet around the motor to avoid friction. If the cover by chance are slightly bend, the rotation of the hub motor could not be perfect. It could cause friction, wobble and heat. This also applies if the small bolts are not being properly mounted and tightened.

@evan Well there are advantages of belt driven compared to hub motor especially in regards of torque. However I still feel that belt driven system have too much parts to maintain. Cleaning is horrible when you ride in almost rainy weather every time. Nevertheless belt drive needs to be adjusted frequently to make sure that the belt are tight, aligned and screwed properly as they tend to vibrate alot.

Hub motor single speed should be the future of electric longboard. Its a complete elegant solution. Its cheaper than purchasing motor, mount, belt and pulleys. Making it possible to go for dual configuration in slightly more pricier category. But the torque, the setup feels better. I believe higher torque, belt drive system are nice for mountainboard drive. They require more torque and made for special purpose of climbing, jumping, etc. Since longboard are made purely to be ridden on normal street path, hub motor is ideal the way I look at it.

---

@Hummie Yes I know jacob and your hub motor build. They are awesome and still in production - development. One two small thing that I don't envy on jacob hub motor is the mounting option on standard truck axle. They need to be twisted to lock into the axle and the hold by a grub screw. Locking into axle have consequences like jacob stated that these eboards have power to accelerate and decelerate. It means torsional load are applied clockwise and counter-clockwise. So during acceleration or deceleration it could undo the locking, thats why the grub screw are to lock it further. It's fine solution but somehow I have bad experience with twist lock mechanism to handle torsional load since I have ridden friction drive before. Also all hub motor are open designed and not sealed for heat exchange. The Netherlands is always misty and 80% of the days are cloudy and wet. I don't cruise when it rains, but its unavoidable to go home completely wet.

Honestly if I have the ability to create my own hub motor, I would start from scratch. Starting from wheels, hub and axle. The specs would be

 1. Weather sealed but not heating up easily.
 2. Custom truck axle design is fine (buyer will need to buy the hub motor anyway, so the axle could be an all in one package too). As buyer I don't mind getting a nice axle for hub motor config if they are mechanically excellent. Even if the truck axle is one piece with the stator axle, if they could align perfectly minimizing the wobble, i'll be fine.
 3. It would be great to have varieties of different wheels replacement from color, size and durometer or even brand. That means the "seller" provide a lathed / cut branded wheels from Orangatang / abec 11 as wheel replacement. So we as longboarder could have the same wheels feeling as common longboard wheels.

I'm curious what the wheel/motor bearings are sitting on.  Are they simply sitting on the long threaded bolt?  Bearings siting on threads isn't good.   And if it's structurally as I imagine....the weight of the rider is putting so much force on that lever, the bolt, and it's not supported until it gets into the aluminum hanger.  Strange because they have steel in the center of the stator, which is strong and good, but it doesn't really matter because it's not taking any load...   The best and only thing good about the steel center is it's a solid shaft for the smaller outside bearing which is a weak point. 

At first I thought maybe it was a robust design with the inner steel but now...   Maybe I have it wrong but is that long bolt, that the bearings are sitting on, spanning all the way through the motor and then it inserts into the aluminum threading?  That's a crazy long span and doubt the square peg will take much of the load.


Motors are almost waterproof as is.  I wouldn't worry about it especially if u seal the connections from the motor leads to the windings.  

I thought Jacob changed from. The little grub screw to a nice locking mechanism,

@Hummie I think I might know what you are in doubt with they are not completely right, but the weak point still lies within the long bolt that hold the hub motor to the axle.

The stator axle is one solid steel axle with round edge on one side and dipped rectangular spot on the other side. They could be mounted on the truck axle without both hub motor cover installed. It will stay locked in that position. So the torsional load, are all being hold by this rectangular spot.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/8/80b7da81c8587c7e5e8aba94407820e8b2c73d0a.jpg" width="613" height="500">

In short this rectangular insertion hold the hub motor axle in place. It holds the torsional load as well as making sure that the hub motor sit horizontally perfect to the truck axle. The long bolt will lock onto this black rounded side of the stator axle.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/787152e3d123467c8c1c40393afca298b8e7a6de.jpg" width="535" height="500">
So the bearings inner side will sit on the outter side of this black rounded stator axle.

Just for clarity, this is the photo of the back side of the hub motor.
<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/7d73544b9978de2099329f4e9c21f87a1de0bbee.jpg" width="505" height="500">

In the end the bolt has to hold the hub motor rectangular spot with the truck axle rectangular spot are always perfectly intact. So the whole load sits on that tiny rectangular spot, which is quite small and weak. Also the insertion of this long bolt to the truck axle is only about 1 cm (you can see it from the photo above the discoloration on the bolt), which is quite short while the bolt its self is 6cm long. So the bolt doesnt hold any torsional load at all!

This design could be perfected if the chinese manufacturer extend this small flat rectangular spot all the way through the hub motor stator axle. Ensuring that is perfectly perpendicular all the way from the edge of truck axle to the edge of the hub motor stator axle, spreading the torsional load and weight along the rectangular shaft.

the torsion load I wasn't concerned about.  and not catastrophic if it fails.  Maybe strip the wires at worst but not have the wheel come off. 

You say the bolt only goes into the aluminum hanger a cm?  Scary.  

The bearings do they sit on a shaft that's threaded?  That has to be bad but not as scary as the 1cm threading of aluminum that's right at the fulcrum 

If u want to get a set of the motors I had made to see how they compare I'll send them to you for the 200$ Plus shipping. Be nice to see how they compare. 

Someone...the only person I've heard of..is getting the NGV motors and was also getting mine but backed out of mine.  Disapointing as I'd like to have heard a comparison of those as well

Maybe they're all great. 

I've only done 150 miles with mine before they shorted through a simple insulation problem but I wonder how things will go at mile 50,000.  I'll still be riding them if they're going and definately don't want a wheel falling off.


Can u put a longer threaded shaft throught the hanger? 

Bearings on threads though..no one does that probably for a reason.

Yeap I know that belt drive is hard to go drop-through setup which I really want to. But hub motor can't change truck/wheels easily because the design, maybe someday it might be change or something.

So at this moment the best way to us should be like having both setup and skating crazily everyday hahaha.

@evan To be honest changing the wheels are more important than trucks from my pov. Because the affect of trucks to the style of longboarder doesn't change significantly compared to the wheels. Since elongboard are not meant to do tricks, from my pov it doesnt matter at all. In fact how many times do you think you change set of trucks compared to set of wheels. The amount of trucks out there are only a few, even then belt driven mount also currently only supporting paris and caliber 2 trucks.

@Hummie yes it's scary! Thats why if you scroll back above, I do NOT recommend this hub motor for heavy duty and heavy load purpose as most of the stress are being hold by that small rectangular spot. Although they are NOT aluminum, they are steel for sure, from mechanical perspective they will for sure have to hold the entire stress we put.

The bearings doesn't sit on the threaded shaft (the bolt). The stator axle has its on hollow shaft and the threaded shaft goes in it locking the stator axle to the truck. Anyway I'd be happy to have your Hub motor to be compared side by side. But first let me get my VESC shipment from Chaka have this tested, if my budget fits for 2nd build I would definitely contact you.

Nevertheless Is there any photos where I could see how you mount the hub motor to the truck? I didn't seem to see it / understand it properly from ES. For the rest of the build of the chinese hub motor compared to your build seems to be quite identical despite different size of bearings and how the cover are locked with the motor can.

i think there's a video where Jason talked about this hub motor . somewhere in his youtube vlog or instagram vids . fyi , theres alot of china e~skate hub motors popping up in alibaba & aliexpress . idk about amazon or ebay . maybe there is too . some even offer complete dual hub set up incl remote , 2 escs + programmer and 22V 18650 pack battery . at only USD$469 (i think)

same as you , i dont like the colour . darker blue is ok , since it's touching the ground . cobalt blue like those wheels ? are not my taste . its a "turn~off"  colour .

@mostwanted Yea Jason talked about this hub motor within one of his youtube vlog. I already have this hub motor for sometime already about (1 - 2 months, beginning of this year). I've been thinking to post this with my upgraded build later, but I changed my mind. It seems better to have it open in another post :smile:

As far as my investigation, there are only 2 suppliers I could found that sells electric hub motor for longboard.
However I decided to go over Lofty Ambition as it seems to be more solid build (in my pov).

I've been thinking for sometime now to have my wheels painted black, maybe dyed black. Not sure if that would work.

Yes they are steel, in fact they are all steel. There is no plastic involve in this hub motor besides the bearing cover. These hub motor are quite heavy in my opinion. I actually expect hub motor to be lighter and more powerful.

@trbt555 Yes I am wrong again :) it's from aluminium. However the rest are from steel (cover of the hub motor), they are attracted to magnets. The hanger is from aluminium. Strange aluminium are really expensive and if the Chinese is using it, I suppose the hanger are CNC machined. However when the bolt is attached without the hub motor, they doesn't seems to aligned perfectly. Nevertheless I never expect I have aluminium hanger as all of my trucks are cast trucks.

It's probably cast aluminum and then they drill it after. 

can u please show a picture of the bolt through the motor but not screwed into the hanger?  You said there is a small amount of metal that is able to screw in.  I think maybe most of the rider's weight on the board would be on transfered through the threads and not the jigsaw piece sticking out of the motor.  

Aluminum threads bearing the weight. Humm. I'd fill the hanger with epoxy!

Here is the photo. From my pov, it appears that this rectangular spot hold most of the stress. The rest of the stress is from the bolt connection to the hanger hole in which its still the reactangular piece.

Btw as you can see I painted the wheels and all of the things black. It occurs to me that the hub wheels are slightly too small or the fitting is too thight. It causes the hub wheel to slightly deformed and cause wobble on certain slow speed. I guess it would be fine after some run as the wheels will be grinded with the street, but still this shouldnt occur in the first place.

@justin Yes I use spray paint, but for sure it will wear out after several ride.
So decided to buy a Rit Dye from the UK to dye the wheels because the Dylon dye that is available here is quite tricky to work with.

I am not going to try to ride this unpowered until I have it powered, I like the way it looks for now

I havent got my esc from chaka yet, its on the way. Probably about this week it will arrive, but yeah depends on the shipping.

I have them spray painted atm, but I am sure it will get scrapped off. So I have a dye coming on its way to color them better.

For the diameter I havent measured it yet, its either 90mm or 97mm. I think its 90mm but I will measure it again.

I also confirm today that the hall sensor from the hub motor works, which is very cool  doesn't cog alot when I use small RC car esc.

@Hummie I've just run some test. With my lipo 24v setup it could draw 15A on full throttle bench test. After around 30sec of full throttle, it gets hot. Normally on SK3 motor it's cold - warm, but this is quite hot. I don't think this is normal, yet theres no load on top of it.

So finally VESC arrived today from @chaka. Wonderful quality, opened the box smells like I could get high on the coating. Overall bench test was great though I have abit of a problem getting bldc and firmware (apparently I have other bldc in my mac somewhere within some folders, so I kept using the old one over and over) :D my bad!

**So I've tested again my Chinese Hub Motor, actually seems pretty good with VESC on bench test.**

Last time the hub motor went **super hot being run with RC grade ESC**, but the power of the hub motor with sensored operation was incredible. I am not recommending using this hub motor with RC grade ESC, because it will just destroys it. Not quite sure if it because I ran high timing, but it gets very hot after 30 seconds of full throttle.

**So what happen with VESC?**
Runs very cool, quieter than normal single belt drive (I only dont like the high pitch start). Somehow I felt more power (because of VESC settings and dual motor setup I guess). Braking is nice and solid. Everything still runs on BLDC mode atm, so no FOC yet. Ahh yes I also would like to try the hybrid mode, I think it can also be a game changer (similar to the RC grade performance).

Finally the wait and the hub motor works, at least for the bench test :) We will see how it performs on the real street!
Also if I got the chance, I hope I'll get this compared to @Hummie hub motor.

Today I've just got an hour of flat ground testing.
**Overall performance, Satisfied. Very satisfied!**

I can hit 40km/h speed not hitting full throttle yet which is scary enough to make me chicken out.
The motor seems to draw more amps than belt drive configuration, but the torque is forgiving (not surprising like belt drive) but still quite insane on acceleration from static condition.

**The motor runs super cool** I have to say this was my biggest concern of all, since the first time I tested it with RC grade esc. But with VESC, theres huge difference in performance and cooling. I simply love it!

I managed to do a little burn out on the hub motor urethane to have them round and balanced, now it doesn't wobble alot anymore. Great!

After full day ride about several kilometers, everything seems to be very cool and operational. I've managed to reduce the speed wobble on higher speed by sanding down the hub motor urethane on a flat surface. This makes them very round with less vibrations.

FOC mode doesn't seems to work very well. So I've decided to try FOC mode and it doesn't seems to work very well. It's ok on lower rpm but when the throttle gets about 25%, the motor started to rattle from the inside quite hard. Not sure what it is but I do not dare to increase the throttle anymore.

If anyone experience this issue and have solutions, please let me know :smiley:

The detection went fine, but when it spins hard it started to rattle. So @Hummie how do you think I could solve this FOC issue? Btw the motor doesn't gets hot anymore (after using VESC BLDC mode) which is great.

---

@broshi I will do it soon, hopefully within this week if the weather is great. I have tested it today for hill climbing, I have to say it's pretty good if you're about 60kg - 80kg weight with hill grade about 20 - 35. It can pull me on 30 - 35ish range but I have to kick push it once (at least get the wheels spinning for the VESC to catch up). If it's 20 - 25 it can start from stand still but I got to push it a little because VESC won't start pushing forward when the wheels / motor is going the opposite direction. So in overall not bad at all.

Until now the only 2 issues I have with this motor are:
1. Not working with FOC mode
2. It wobbles on certain rpm due to urethane not perfectly round after being fit into the motor (I minimized it by sanding the urethane down)
```

---
## \#62 Posted by: laurnts Posted at: 2016-04-18T00:01:51.597Z Reads: 341

```
Okay after sanding it down, the vibrations / wobbles seems to be minimised significantly but not cannot be nullified.
After several analysis, the reason it can't be nullified because of the softer 90mm 80A durometer. I believe this is not 80A durometer but 76A durometer.

If you look into this photo
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/787152e3d123467c8c1c40393afca298b8e7a6de.jpg

You can see that the wheels are lock into place by 6 metal star pattern from the hub motor case. It seems that the difference in thickness of the urethane plays a great contribution to the vibration which is (if its true) hard to nullified.

Thats the reason why at higher speed / rpm this vibrations are not existing anymore because the centrifuge as well as the rotation are fast enough to overcome this issue.

I don't know much about the vesc or FOC, just know I like it a lot.  The only thing I can think of is how u have so many stator teeth and the fast electrical commutation necessary, but ur good on bldc so probably not the problem

The rubber I'm confused what ur saying is the problem. i cook my rubber up hot with my new motors and it starts as 83 duro and surely gets softer. If ur wheel S round to begin with I don't understand how going faster would help and not make the problem more noticeable. 

I still wonder about dyeing the rubber.  Didn't know u could do that

I would recommend to set the hub motor wheels with higher durometer than 80A, so 83A is a good starting point.
Yes the motor is already silent compared to SK3 with belt drive, only the high pitch noise start up sound is the one I dislike alot.

Because if I just sit on my board while watching the wheels and the rims, I've noticed every time the section that has the bolt touches the ground it made the little bump. It happens for all of the stars for all wheels. I sand the rubber carefully with soft sand paper on high speed and flat equal surface.

Well the spray paint has gone completely, but I will try dying them with a multipurpose dye next week.
It should able to penetrate the rubber urethane deep enough. I've seen it works for RC car plastics and wheels, so I am going to try that on longboard wheels. Would be cool to see it works.

For lighter person like me it's a great hub motor, especially combined with VESC.

To be honest Jerry also sell the dual hub sinewave controller that uses the hall sensor to operate. Someone uses it and the performance seems to be very decent. Very silent operation only plug and play. The downside of this controller is that we have to use the remote that they made. Frankly speaking it looks horrible, but if someone make a 3d printer mod out of it, it could be a bargain. controller + remote 140usd I think (140 usd for the price of 2 FOC ESC + remote)

Yesterday I tested my dual hub motor compared to single belt drive motor with same - similar battery spec, similar weight 60kg's and same ESC (VESC) all run with bldc mode. I have to say that the performance of single drive especially the startup torque is more aggressive and inside. Impressively due to belt drive mechanism is transferring power to the wheels, the wheels stays round so less vibrations occurred. Once hitting 15km/h ish hub motor performance accel significanty. They accelerate and they torque harder with higher top speed ofc.

However there are things I didnt like after having it for a while.

I used Hub once, never think of going back. However you really need to get th e right hub motor that doesn't heat up fast or doesnt wobble because of its mechanical construction.

TBH the chinese hub mount have the same mount system as the new enertion ghost drive, which I personally dislikes as it can have wobble issues easily due to few milimiters of manufacturing faults between the truck and hub motor mount.

Hopefully with their cnc cut method, this issue is solved. But for now I believe that hummie hub and carvon motor mount mechanics are better.
