Hi guys, the new project is coming up with new gearbox using inner gears to make it smallest possible direct drive gearbox :slight_smile: It's nor possible to make any smaller because then motor 63mm will start to touch the hanger. Maybe there will be some trying to make 3 gear system but it's only on the mind right now ;)

There will be no need to machine a hanger, every gear will be machined from scratch so it suppose to be cheaper than our normal gearbox, plus it will have only 4 parts

* Main gear attached to the hub of the wheel.
* Hanger mounting adapter,
* Baseplate
* Motor gear

How do you achieve sealing of the gears in order to keep the luberication in the system?
Wouldn't you need a flange somewhere to mount a v-ring?

There is basically no need for lubrication ;) I am already over 500km on my gearbox and I don't see any wear.

```
At the moment my own 6384 170kv but should be working with any 63mm motor ;) Top speed should be around 50km/h. It's more for Mtb boards so high speeds are not much better.

50 km/h is more then enough for a board with 4 wheels(at least for me :slight_smile:).
Anyway it looks awesome.. Good luck!

How do you achieve a top speed of 50 km\hr with a 170 KV motor and gear ratio of 5:1? What's your battery voltage?
```

---
## \#10 Posted by: Ishayc Posted at: 2018-01-24T12:17:28.529Z Reads: 502

```
Yup, actually with 12 cells you will need 350kv motor to achieve that if you go with 90mm wheels.
With bigger wheels lets say 200mm  you will achieve 50 km/h with 170kv.
He's planning to build MTB so no problem there.

Well that's cool, it's like an oversized, offset ATB hub motor.

I'm interested in a few months I guess, nice one another cool product, mix these up with @scepterr's dark matter motors and you's have a really nice crap-free transmission

It's relevant as soon as you mill out corners (bigger endmill=bigger radius of my "corner"), and smaller tools want higher rpm;)

There are sealing, dirt, mud, sand will fly out as it spins (like centrifuge) no lube is required as I am riding my board no lube for over 500km (the old style lot smaller gears).

Plus the metal gear was covered in the special material which is really hard to break so it should stay in the same shape for decades.

If I understood correctly it should be less than 400€ + shipping

Bit higher, but its really short like 2cm width I think, so I don't think you will be going ride your board 2cm away from wheel on border some kind so it should not much matter now ;)

P.S. Its kinda the same as just pulley I just realized :D As that whole black thing spins together with the wheel

[quote="Kug3lis, post:66, topic:44512"]

[/quote]

How will it fly out of the gear based on centrifugal force? I get that i will fly outwards to the teeth, but there is no force getting it out through the small gap once it's really inside.

I have to clean my inner gear drive teeth everytime i go through really heavy mud, no matter how small i make the gap between motor mount and gear, however my gears are the tiniest bit flexible so it isn't as bad when it clogs up and it's clearly audible before it gets too bad.

Flexible may be better as it squashes which helps for clearances and has no need for mechanical strength in this application

If it's printed thin the material is flexible enough i guess, but i think i didn't get earlier that you meant that th part should touch the gear. In that case some really squishy filament might be needed and i'm afraid my modded cr10 could not do that.

I can see dirt and debris from wear and tear accumulating and becoming compacted in the teeth valley on the inside spur gear. It's a great design but like everything else will need maintenance now and then. I can say steel on steel gears are strong. I haven't found a power limit that the 32p (mod.8) gear can't hold. My setup starts with 8.44:1  9pinion 76spur and can run any size pinion. How about pinion size options for gearing? Be a nice option..

[quote="MoeStooge, post:75, topic:44512"]
I can see dirt and debris from wear and tear accumulating and becoming compacted in the teeth valley on the inside spur gear. It’s a great design but like everything else will need maintenance now and then.
[/quote]
Yes of course it needs maintenance, but i have a feeling that my PC/Nylon gears can stomach a lot more grit between the teeth than regular 100% stiff steel or POM gears. Not saying they are necessarily stronger, but if have a feeling that they won't block as easily. I'm not sure though, haven't gotten that many kilometers on them.

[quote="MoeStooge, post:75, topic:44512"]
I haven’t found a power limit that the 32p (mod.8) gear can’t hold.
[/quote]
That's impressive, i saw pictures of your gears and wondered what module they are but i didn't think they would be just 0.8. But i still think that it's very brave to run them without some sort of enclosure :sweat_smile:

[quote="MoeStooge, post:75, topic:44512"]
How about pinion size options for gearing? Be a nice option…
[/quote]

I don't know what @Kug3lis has planned for his gears but different  pinions shouldn't be an issue as long as they don't get too big since the motors are really close already to the hanger. There isn't much room though, maybe 14 teeth Modul 2 on mine tops. 

Inner Gear Drive would be pretty cool with Inrunners since you could save a few mm's on motor diameter and even secure the motor directly on the hanger.

I have a light weight 4pole Inrunner setup with 40mm cans that makes 8400w but it needs an 8:1 ratio to run a 90mm wheel. 40mph board and has more torque under 5mph than a human can Handel. Inrunners and gear drives are made for each other...  https://www.instagram.com/p/BaFYW0jj0I4/

Man thats sick. I don't have any experience with inrunners but everyone is making them sound soooo goood. 8.4kW in a 40mm can sound absolutely bananas compared to our regular 6374 motors!

In my case the bottleneck would be the availability of gears since i don't have a cnc, so i can partly only rely on what you find online for pinions. I don't see a 8:1 happening with the usual mountainboard sizes of 8mm shafts and modul 2 +/+ 0.5. (unless using some kind of planetary system, @Riako? :wink:) 

Anyways i think my 130kv 1:5.5 setup is more than enough torque right now on 200mm's so im focusing more on the riding than development in the next months :D

Guys if you go through mud baths then nothing will help even my old gearbox will need some cleanup. But for the normal day going through sand, grass and etc shouldn't be much of a problem.

@banjaxxed regarding the lip it does not work very well ;)

Inrunner are bit crazy as I see they are over 1k on KV... So I don't know what kind of pinions you would want to run them.

So today I received the kit for my board to try it out damn its fine way better than the old one. It drives smoothly and the most important part sound is like 10 times lower compared to the previous drivetrain. There is no more geary feeling when riding it. 

Also, I received some info that it will be available to buy next week and price will be 375€ + shipping.

Dude just wow, i love it.

Can you explain a bit more about your trucks? I see its a spherical joint, the two side links constrain the path of the axle rotation, but what stops it from wiggling around like crazy? Do you have some bushings hidden away?

And also what is the tiny little linkage in the middle of one of the bigger ones? Is that a damper of some sort? But how.. its just a link as far as i can see

Awesome set up! Very intriguing

Insanity! of the good kind. Can;t believe the bushing was right in front of my nose, i guess black and white pictures fooled me :smiley:

@Kug3lis yea sorry for thread hijacking. I wanted to ask, why have the motor mount distance adjustable? Unless of course you were making different pinions to go with the set. I'm asking mainly because only two screws are kind of holding the motor mount in place, which seems to be the weakest point in the whole (otherwise great) build.

There are not much-bending forces as with belts or chains, so 2 screws are more than enough, the moving is only to fine adjust the gear engagement as on each wheel the wheel sits differently because of the hub (that's why we are working on solid alu hubs) ;)

Ground clearance is around 4cm but the idea is that the biggest part is only 2.5cm width next to the tire so in case you happen to ride a rail next wheel it shouldn't cause many problems.

Hey @Kug3lis, Have you noticed if the 3:1 gearbox benefits from a lower Kv motor?  I’m running about 4:1 on my belt drive trampa and feel like it needs more low end on the 8 inch pneumatics.  I’m running 12s and 190 kv motors and want to try a gearbox, but I’m worried about the 190’s being the wrong choice.  Btw I live in a very hilly area.

I haven't yet tried 3:1 as it is still in development. Your setup really lacks in the torque department.

![48 AM|492x370](upload://yzDjgxI59q0TSqSy8YzSCB32Hd.png)

The 3:1 version is oriented for smaller wheels like 6.5" / 125mm gummies and etc and low kv motors like 130kv

![36 AM|496x364](upload://q5leMPP4Mp8t14Cb8WZMtov4S0n.png)

If you want more torque I would recommend this inner gear drive box with 170kv motors which would give you more than enough torque

![00 AM|490x354](upload://83hHML36FQxeMhY7d5UuQ1988os.png)

Or even 130kv motors but then you lose max speed. With 5:1 and 170kv I had no problem climbing to really steep hills.

I originally only wanted a Carvon system, but I'm very much interested in this design your working on.  Seems now, a better solution even over the Carvon's IMHO...  Fanatic work! Really liking forward too the new project your working on for a smaller sized wheel...! :smile:

I've been through a lot of mud and dirt with my Inner Gear drive and i assume that the dimensions are roughly similar with @Kug3lis one and i don't see anything on the outside of the gears.
Could be because the material of my gears is a lot more flexible than POM but i think you would have to hit a really hard piece of something on purpose in the right angle to effectively damage anything.

Do you think helical (or maybe even herringbone gears) would improve this system? After seeing Nowind's new direct drive with helical gears and the apparent much quieter ride I was wondering if this would be something you will try in the future.

Would be an improvement noise wise, but you need crazy machinery. Normal helical gears require 4axis machining, these would need 5th axis.

I mean helical or heringbone, they both need the same machinery. Sls parts probably could work, but not sure how these parts deal with abrassive forces, and these printers are even more expensive than some 5 axis :/

This style gear I think would be impossible as helical, because you have only one side of access so I cant imagine how to mill inside of it at the different angle.

I have modded the ATB 1:5 to fit on scrub hubs with 9" wheels, they also have a 5 spoke fit.

Went a little something like this, worked out alignment,made withness marks and drilled out to 4mm same as scrub bolts
![bdf39f85c03e5389a0d58932ead80dcd725ddd4f|375x500](upload://p9RtQE5tkGNqyLVrxrGVZ1wNbiB.jpg)
It sure ain't CNC but I was accurate enough not to introduce an alignment problem (I think)

![drill|375x500](upload://k14fpqiZXAhhjsV9tkcQHdyVsaP.jpg)

![image|640x480](upload://vXg73AFaPrbbNU9VR3t13g519qA.jpg)

Just have to shorten the M4 50mm bolts down to 40mm and done for this side
![bolts|375x500](upload://q5i5puCtqt0Gb6chD9khRnEUnei.JPG)

Using the 6374 Dark Matter sealed motors with a 8mm shaft, this caused a little problem due to the collar at the base of the shaft, the solution was a stack of 5 washers and longer M4 bolts (15mm torx).
![washer stack|640x480](upload://yzXFHC98mtfv0jIFBul17n4dz63.JPG)![darkmatter|640x480](upload://pPAX1zZvFLLokpdaQcNXYT6bcnX.JPG)
Whether this turns out to be a stable soltion time will tell, if not I'll take some meat off the base of the spur

Faint mark from the spur touching on pushed test, problem?

Maybe a sixth washer but the stack is longer than I'd like already![IMG_8771|666x500](upload://fhRDvI2jlZxIXGZV0MfnNzkg8F3.JPG)

I think the bigger isue will be the inner gear not being concentric to the wheel hub. I can see from your photos quite a difference in distance between the original holes and the ones you made- on one side the original holes are closer than the other. Or at least thats what I see.

The washer solution is some true dope head engineering :smiley: might as well be the cause of the scrub mark on the inner gear because the stacks of washers could be different in height thus causing the motor gear axis being not perpendicular to the plane of the inner gear. This would leadt to not a line contact between the gears but more of a point contact - the POM gear will wear out sooner than it should.

Edit: I would try and get some real spacers for the motor and test if the scrubbing is still happening. also put the wheel on the axle and spin it, see if the inner gear is running concentric.

The run mark is even the whole circumference in both sweep and depth indicating running true.

The photo may not be representative & the counterbores are not as nice as the actual bolt body slots which are very clean & true, in the photo above you can see paint marks rather than gouging & looks more angled than actually is. The new counterbore ever so slighly breaches the other counterbore, but the actual bolt holes are apart, maybe I'll get a pic on the other side when doing the other drive

Each bolt slid effortlessly through the 5mm hole and into the wheel. I can seee any deviation throughout the wheel rotation, maybe I got lucky...

Ps. I did price up a pair of replacement POM wheel gears, maybe dope head engineering but it has a chance, now to the other side.

[/quote]

If ypou read my post again & the install manual you'll understand that there needs to be a clearance of 30mm between the top of the spur and the top of the motor, with dark matter motors there is a collar which prevents that so the choices are -

i) Removing ~5mm from the neck of the spur close to the grub screws

ii) Adding washers

iii) removing the collar with a lathe

I went with (ii) for my mock up but may revert to (i) if I feel it won't work. S/S 15mm M5 torx bolts are used due to the 6 washers. That's right I added one more washer to remove the rub.

Ok I know ya'all be waiting for me to show superstars but I've not given into this temptation just yet.

The gear you're looking at apart from the drive unit is 2nd hand and as such has lived before this build, and lived well.


In saying that I'd throw in some advice on the install instructions, there needs to be about 45mm of axle showing in order for the adapter part to be fully seated. The machined square was taken off @Kug3lis's trucks and due to manufacturing differences they may or may not slide straight on.

So in order if you find me that the adapter plate won't slide straight on 

1. Make sure the grub screws are backed out and no grub hole burrs are protruding

2. try swapping sides

3. Try swapping trucks...remember they are the same truck

4. Still problems then do this 
![IMG_8786|375x500](upload://cFlZrzkWPGAqSw3ZfbKzoS6xrfJ.JPG)

Just a cheap socket and a large 12mm washer, the even force will push the plate down on the hanger evenly to the plane of the axle. 

Caveat: This will mar the hanger powdercoat of course but much better than breaking out the file which I did initially, don't be me.

I believe this is why Jenso asks for a hanger, his method includes precision machining of the hanger making all hangers 'the same' for his drive.

The other problem I have with this is a slight runout of the wheelgear, there are 1-2 supplied washers recommended between which influence the trueness of this rotation
(even without the wheel attached to the wheelgear) but they sit on a very narrow reference point for transferring 'trueness' of the adapter plate/axle![IMG_8787|666x500](upload://tSwP04v8glwUlU0JQ76mZ5aMwv9.JPG)

This would be a great place to design in a 12mm bearing![IMG_8788|666x500](upload://3wmn6xCAjCk0R5LBFA5pumTrR15.JPG)
