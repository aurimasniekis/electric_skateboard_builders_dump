Ok. So I thought I'd dedicate a thread to all those little DIY tips and tricks that we all use when we don't have, and don't want to invest lots of money into that special tool...

I hope this isn't the 10th thread on this specific topic, but I haven't seen one in a while, so let's call this 2018 life hacks :wink:

First off is this stupid little thing that we have far too many of lying around the apartment. Kids love bubbles. Me not so mucho.

So I use this whenever I clean bearings. Pull out that middle thingie and put the bearings on and push it back onto the lid. Fill it up with isopropyl alcohol and shake. No need to buy "expensive " bearings cleaners! Yaaay.

If youâ€™ve got generic 50 degree trucks iâ€™d recommend wedging front by 5 degrees and dewedge back by 5 degrees. Thickness doesnt really matter.

"Lemon scent pledge" for cleaning. I picked up this trick from a fellow truck driver. The driver that showed me this trick drove a spotless concrete mixer truck. Pledge keeps grime from sticking . Cyclist in the know have been using pledge for years as well. It's cheep and works better than anything on the market. I buy the generic stuff from the local Dollar store.

Soldering: More heat, less time, better join

Vesc repair: If you screw a pad, it's because your approach or mindset is wrong.

Always be prepared to back off and have a think about what you're doing & how you can do it better

If the balls of the bearing pop out while cleaning, use this video as reference on how to put it all together again.

Stiffer bushings is an option, but make the board less lively. To still keep that livelyness/carvyness you need to apply wedges. OR trucks of different geometries

Dont let your balls hit water. ... Sorry wrong forum.  If you are riding in the rain make sure you wipe down your board after you get home.  And also open your bearings so they wont rust.

@banjaxxed This is a good tip! I had problem cutting strips as they tend to warp when cutting with not so fancy scissors..

The nail clippers will probably blunt and stop working. A pair of tough scissors is much easier

I just wanted to pass the idea that this is the one rare situation where cutting corners is actually a good idea :smiley:

Ialways wonder when I see those pointy corners on the end of a positive pole if it could get bent under the ring or cut it's way through to the negative can. Even if not they can short off something else; sharp, sticky-out  current carrying things should be avoided in a pack getting vibration, that is all...hack

Yeh, I agree with you on this one.. These sharp corners look like unfinished job to me.. Dont really have any pictures of my strips but some of them I even cut round.. In the shape of positive round terminal. 

At least then I know if for whatever reason a direct impact hits that strip, it does not have a fckn sharp corner to bend and hit a cell directly.. just an extra safety and works for aesthetic purposes also..

My nickel strips warped a bit too when cutting them. I put them on a smooth surface and rolled them like cookie dough with a roll of hockey tape. Good as new. I also rolled down all the edges on the pack as I built it too. Great tip with the clippers @banjaxxed.

Yeh I assume rolling with something hard might work nicely..

 I  hammered mine flat against smooth surface and they also looked better.

One of my motors has been causing me so much trouble.. One of the latest things was the stripped threads that made me loose all 4 screws securing the motor to the mount during a ride. lol. 

Some people might drill and re-thread with a tap, others would use an insert...but this part of the motor is made out of soft aluminum, and rethreading would most probably lead to another stripped threads...and I don't have tools for the threaded inserts.

So instead I took hex nuts small enough to fit on the inside of the motor, put the screws in (with added threadlocker...also made sure nuts and screws would not interfere with windings) and epoxied down the nuts to the motor. No more stripped threads.

Edit.. I even added som nail-polish onto the bottom of the screw+nut for isolation. lol. Don't know if it would help or not. :nail_care:t3:

Cut them down to the size you want, find the balance point and attach. Obviously you won't lugging it super long distances this way, but it is easy to pick up on the fly and carry a bit.
