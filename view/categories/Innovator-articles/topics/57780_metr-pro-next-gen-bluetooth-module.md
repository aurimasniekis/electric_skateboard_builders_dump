Hey everyone!

Together with @hexakopter we present you the all new **Metr Pro** bluetooth module! It is based on the latest tech from Nordic nRF52 and packs a punch!

![metr-pro|690x460](upload://mfspbyAz53KR9WPBTTBoqGRpQN9.jpg)

<div align=center>

## Hardware Features

</div>

1. **Metal Shield** for interference protection. This is very important because a lot of EMI is coming from our high current fast switching setups in some cases disturbing the correct operation of the module. The main unit is shielded to mitigate that.
2. Optional **external 2.4GHz antenna**. Recommended if you have carbon fiber enclosure or you experience a lot of issues with bluetooth module disconnecting. It makes a noticeable difference. In our tests external antenna doubled the range of operation. But even the default configuration with internal PCB antenna still has much better connection than HM-10.

3. **Three bright colored LEDs** for easy diagnostics.

![table_discov_90|425x200,35%](upload://u3dBafqrtPDauRfEPeUtxMKJ05g.gif)

</div>

</td><td>

Blue LED (bottom) is for bluetooth. When it is blinking slowly, the module is in Discovery mode. It is advertising and you should be able to find it within your mobile app.

</td>
</tr>

<div align=center>

![table_ble_90|427x200,35%](upload://gP01tnlJPCuoutpJKFhU1zPVV8o.gif)

</div>

</td><td>

Blue LED rapidly blinking means the data is exchanged via bluetooth. Each incoming and outgoing bluetooth packet results in a little blink.

</td>

![table_uart_90|432x200,35%](upload://1McL16VaM0UYLnKqt39KWGp86j7.gif)

</div>

</td><td>

Green LED (center) is for UART. When it is blinking the module is negotiating BAUD rate and RX / TX pin positions. Usually after half a second it becomes solid green which means the negotiation is successful.

</td>
</tr>

<div align=center>

![table_error|427x200,35%](upload://vZKjg3j4r9VtjaRbGiXW2QSH8kj.jpg)

</div>

</td><td>

Red LED (top) is for errors. When it‚Äôs ON, some error has happened. It might be wrong security PIN code, or UART communication problem. Metr Pro will try to report this error back to the Metr app.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

4. **Additional nRF52 pinouts** on the back of the module. Currently these pins are not used but we might have some ideas like adding a Micro SD card or another UART to communicate with some other stuff ;)


<div align=center>

## Software Features

</div>

1. **BLE security** with Elliptic Curve Cryptography and Man-in-the-Middle protection. All the modules that we use today have bad security or no security at all. It is only a matter of time before someone starts messing around with it. Think about it this way: your board can be hacked, your settings can be messed up, this can result in serious injury. The chance is very low, but why risk?
![pincode2|690x328,80%](upload://9FDhBejOLzSlZ09DBGYqnUEs2bS.jpg)
Metr Pro will never bypass communication from an unpaired phone to the VESC. Each Metr Pro module has a random 6 digit PIN code label on the back side which is used for pairing. Once paired, all the communication is encrypted and secure.

2. Works with **all the apps**. We made sure Metr Pro supports every VESC app. There are more and more apps and they are getting better and better. Thanks to all the amazing software developers out there!

3. Latest updates from Benjamin made possible what we call **VESC Tool Direct**. Forget about TCP Bridge. Connect directly from the desktop version of VESC Tool. Supported on Windows, Mac and Linux.
![vesctool|690x362](upload://jPOuxWff5Crlz6mdvzEhgPDLlrv.png)

4. Works with **all the hardware**. No matter what VESC variant you have, no matter what firmware you have installed*, no matter what BAUD rate you have, Metr Pro works with everything. It has automatic BAUD rate detection and automatic RX / TX pins detection. There is only one cable and only one way to connect it. After being connected it detects RX and TX pins as well as BAUD rates programmatically until successful connection is made. And it has no issues with Android Oreo.

5. **Updatable over the air**. The module itself is running a special firmware that implements the whole BLE stack, UART, VESC protocol + custom Metr protocol. New features can be (and will be) constantly added and you can update the module effortlessly with the Metr app over the air.
![ota|320x426,80%](upload://rfnxb5rlMiS4T2EI3A6CarkAzgz.gif)

6. **Parallel VESC firmware update** with automatic settings backup and restore. With just one click the new firmware can be sent simultaneously to both of your VESCs connected via CAN and motor + app configuration will be restored after the update. Everything in just one minute. Ben and Nico have been hitting hard with the new updates and we think that is awesome. With Metr Pro you can keep up without too much hassle.
![vfu|320x427,80%](upload://fIOGenFqtELqH5JWnXIxgAAasKd.gif)

7. **Startup Mode**. From the Modes tab you can assign one of your modes to be a startup mode and it will automatically apply when you power on your VESC, even if your phone is not around. I like to use it as a warm up. I set up a mode with low-amp, low-speed as startup and ride it for 5-10 first minutes before changing to a faster one. This helps to avoid the stressful situations I sometimes had when accidentally pushing trigger too much in the morning on the way to work.
![startup|320x384,80%](upload://wHFSaHiRsrkNR2UMJ6WfXQYvAeF.gif)

8. **True Dual Realtime Data**. Metr Pro constantly communicates with both VESCs connected via CAN, repacks the data and sends it to the Metr app. Just in case you want to see both motor temperatures and both motor currents independently and understand if one motor starts to perform worse and needs some service. The delivery **speed and density** of Realtime Data is also improved. With these modules you will have faster updates and much more detail.
![dual|320x351,80%](upload://3k49qPb27N51hDrDeWfBWGShmIb.gif)

We can‚Äôt wait for you to use Metr Pro in your builds! This module is no longer just a serial bridge between VESC and mobile, it is a full-fledged VESC-addon with smart features.

You achieve a very advanced product here, focused on the real concerns everyday riders can encounter.

Do you sell only 7pin version ? No 8pin for VESC6 ?

I am little confused: the pin protected pairing thing can be done with an HM-10 also, no? Just need to set it up via AT commands.
Also what does startup mode mean? Just have what you want as "startup" as your default in the VESC and then update to a different mode via for example @Ackmaniac's App later while riding. Or am I missing something?
Seems like nice hardware though and i like the dual vesc data - that is really helpful when you are using for example different kv motors in a dual setup.

It's very encouraging to see you all excited! A big thanks to everyone that already ordered a Metr Pro module so that we sold all our 22 modules that were already produced on our release data. Thats awesome! :grinning:  I will add pictures of these modules below. We will deliver our best! I am working hard right now to produce some more so that all modules that are bought as of now will be shipped as soon as possible. Right after we finish support for 2.54 and 2.18 and test all use cases, we will start shipping. We will try to ship all the modules that have been ordered so far hopefully before Monday. First orders will be shipped first.

@mmaner @caustin @ElskerShadow @i2oadsweepei2 @Adam0311 we didn't realize how many people are using 2.54 and 2.18, the support for those is being added as we speak. Dual Realtime Data, and Modes will be supported.

Damn, just received the ‚Äûold‚Äú HM-10 [Metr.at ](http://Metr.at) module yesterday :confused: Any way to monitor dual Vesc setup with this module or do I need the new module for this?
[/quote]
You can still monitor both of your VESCs with HM-10, but only one at a time using CAN ID in Settings


[quote="CBom, post:54, topic:57780, full:true"]
Looks great! Does this one work with Android 8?
[/quote]
Yes Metr Pro works with Android 8 Oreo. Tested on Pixel 2 XL. The old module doesn't get discovered on Oreo most of the times according to the forum members.

We went with this antenna, because it was recommended by our nRF supplier and gives best results. But feel free to experiment. As you can see on the photos, there are 2 parts:

1) U.FL to RP-SMA extension cable
2) 2.4GHz RP-SMA antenna

I recommend to keep the extension cable and try some small 2.4GHz RP-SMA antennas, like this one

@Gdunn416 please be aware that modules with antenna and without antenna have 0R resistor soldered in a different position. But with a good soldering equipment it should be easy to resolder.

@Deodand Oh yes it does. The latest Qt version does support bluetooth low energy on Windows 10. You just need to build `wip/win` branch of `qtconnectivity.git`. After that VESC Tool works just fine. Btw, very excited to add FOCBOX Unity support to Metr Pro when it's ready :+1:

Ah, so currently the vesc-tool has to be rebuilt from source with the changes to qt libs you suggest? Very excited to hear this; no BLE support in windows was driving me crazy. Couldn't get the website-downloaded windows version to run it in a quick test today, assuming they still need to update it with changes? 

We will do our best to get a unity in your hands soon so you can add support! I'm going to try and make a small document to outline the additional values I added to the RT data packet and motor config to accommodate the extra motor parameters/data alongside the released source code.

Quick update. I have good news for all of you. :grin: Metr Pro is now updated to also work with FW2.18 and FW2.54 and you will get the newest firmware already flashed to your module so it will work with these firmwares out of the box. I produce some more modules so all orders as of now are covered. We will try to ship the first orders today and all the rest tomorrow.

To make you the waiting time more pleasant I took some pictures. :grinning: Following two pictures show the modules after first step of soldering.

Mine is working on 2.54 right now Mike. I get a lot of disconnect notifications, but it still seems to record the full stats for the day and the records start and stop well enough.  Also I lost my ferrite ring before I installed it. I just found it last night under the beer fridge üëç. That should fix the disconnect problem I hope.

@mmaner original metr modules already work with 2.54, but some features are not available (dual realtime data, startup mode, etc.)
@Manu39 yes, you can buy antenna later, but you also need to resolder 0R resistor on the Metr Pro module, between internal PCB antenna and external antenna port

I'm sure many of you would like to try VESC Tool with direct BLE connection to Metr Pro.
Here you can find the latest VESC Tool binaries for macOS and Windows.

https://github.com/rpasichnyk/vesc_tool/releases

In Windows, you first need to complete new device pairing procedure:
1. Press Start and type bluetooth. Open Bluetooth and other device settings.
![00|294x500,80%](upload://quYeSNojREiCnNWg9oBNafulpoG.jpg)
2. Click "Add Bluetooth or other device

3. Wait until you see Metr Pro, click on it and enter PIN code
![06|690x419,50%](upload://iDUzkuiIOdLAyNTiIkR0rmMuWEZ.png) 

After this you should be able to connect via VESC Tool

@Skitzor I understand you feelings and I am sorry about that. Android 8 has changes that prevent the old module from being discovered. One way to workaround that is to downgrade to Android 7, perform discovery (Scan) inside the metr app and connect to the module, then upgrade to Android 8 and the module will be still saved in the app. This way you can use it with Android 8.

The new module is not a limitation at all. It is actually a direct solution to the Anroid 8 problem. With insurance. If Google does some trick like this again, the module's firmware can be updated over the air to be compatible with future versions of Android.

@Manu BLE connection does work with the original VESC Tool v0.92 but only on Linux

Every phone has the "issue" but not every module has faulty firmware. The problem comes from Oreo being stricter in terms of how the responses have to look like coming from the modules and the clone firmwares are not properly programmed so they are no longer considered by the phone. With an original firmware you don't have that problem.

I doubt @rpasichnyk built his own firmware. Otherwise it would be easy to publish a new one that solves the Oreo problem. Everything he added must either come via AT commands or is coded into the App.

@Pimousse yeah my wording was probably not perfect there ;) But since it worked before the oreo update I kind of see the problem on the Android side for being too strict where it might not have been necessary. When you update only one part and the system does not work anymore after the update you always see the problem in the thing you changed no?

The official VESC Tool does not support BLE on Windows. You can use the compiled version from my GitHub. There are no source code modifications, just slightly different version of Qt library. I hope Benjamin can use the procedure that I described to provide BLE support on Windows in the future.

A lot of users still prefer Win 7 over Win 10 and they will use it till 2020. I bet that Microsoft will extend their support even longer. 
So the VESC-Tool should be able to run on 
Win 7. Locking out users is no good idea. Software should be compatible with active and used operating systems. 
The mobile VESC-Tool works quite well for wireless configuration. In addition to that you can use your smartphone as a bridge between your computer and board. 
Personally I prefer using my android tablet that has the full VESC-Tool installed. 
Plenty of options on the table already...

Allright, just did a 14km test dride. Checked 3 times during the ride and every time I opened the app the module wasn't connected anymore and there was no ongoing track. Every time a sec later the module connected back but no trace of the previous started record. Of that whole trip it saved 1.5km to my daily stats.. Oh and I didn't even step off my board.. I'll send you the logs @rpasichnyk 

Using the version without extra entenna and have an abs enclosure. Only had like 3 disconnects ever with the old module in the last 1.5 year..

Edit: allright gents, Android decided to turn back on battery optimization for me again. Without telling me, I suspect it randomly does this after updating the app. If you have any issues, check if it is still off for you. Even if you did turn it off just a day before.

Edit 2: module is still disconnecting. Even after a seven minute ride.

The "Update Interval" setting does not make any difference when connected to Metr Pro. The module determines "Uptate Interval" on it's own (currently about 70ms). This setting is only useful with the old modules.

The reason might be that you are using old module and VESC firmware that has low packet timeout. Please try again and right after that go to Settings ‚Üí Show Logs and email to me.

1 / Buy this USB stick bluetooth 4.0:
https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B007ZT2AXE/ref=ya_st_dp_summary?ie=UTF8&psc=1

2 / Download this dmg:
Hardware IO tools for Xcode 7.3
http://www.k-upload.fr/afficher-fichier-2018-06-19-1f47a6302hardwareioto.dmg.html
3 / Install the DMG and open Bluetooth Explorer
Then in the bar at the top of your Mac click on TOOLS / HCI Control Selector and finally choose from the Broadcom Corp. drop-down menu.

4 / pair your keyboard again or mouse or trackpad ...

Turn on your board, open VESC Tools and connect in BLE

I buy it cause the last (old) one never really work more than 500m/ride, I totalize around 2 or 3km for the last year (where I made more than 500/1000km). So after riding all the good work made (even if it never worked before), I buy a new module with external antenna (cause you said if we got pb before its better), I receive it without antenna ... discover after there wasn't working one my like you said "old PC" who works better than the w10 one ... but don't work also on my Windows 10 haaaaaaaaaaaa who was supposed to be the solution ...

haannn :sweat_smile: so I should instal _ubuntu_ on my w10 computer to do what ?..

I received my module. Thanks guys! The build continues.

For anyone interested my module was shipped on the 9th or 10th and was brought to my door on the 20th. I‚Äôm in Ontario Canada. Near Toronto. There were no extra fees or duties though that would have been my responsibility anyway. üëç

Not sure if you've found your solution yet, but I have the galaxy s6 and after it updated to Oreo, my module stopped working. I then realized it was a [clone of a clone](https://blog.yavilevich.com/2017/03/mlt-bt05-ble-module-a-clone-of-a-clone/)  called the MLT-BT05. I bought a genuine HM-10 from robotshop on Amazon, and it now works flawlessly.

I got my module and the both the VESC tool and the metr app are working nicely on my android phone. Thanks @rpasichnyk and @hexakopter! So awesome to finally have riding modes with the default firmware!

I have two issues with the metr app though: 
1) it seems that it ignores the regenerated energy when calculating the Wh/km. 
2) Could you enable custom discharge curves in the battery setup? I assume you just interpolate from a table? I set my app to Li-Ion but it seems to be pretty far off from 30Qs, which I'm using. So the % displayed doesn't fit my battery at all. This would also be nice for people that e.g. use different voltage cutoffs and so on. 

Another thing, which is not a big deal, but it might be nice if the battery percentage is averaged over a few seconds in the realtime display. The voltage readout on the vesc is so noisy that the battery display "flickers" around like crazy and is just not that nice to look at.

Haha the perfect response. Percentage indicators don't work unless you set them up according to your batteries.

Lookup a discharge curve for the 30Q's and base your percentages from that people! 


On another note hopefully my metr pro's show up this week so I can install them.

I know it's a matter of firmware/software update. But the Metr has a basic encryption somehow. startbit/endbit whatever. I'm too busy to find out.

Yeah. There's nothing special about the antenna. As long as you have the right connector you can use whatever "antenna" you want as long as it's for the right frequency band. Making your own custom antenna isn't at all difficult and amateur radio (and other) websites offer lots of help.

@ducktaperules
Every single Metr Pro module is tested with its pin code on the back, the JST cable it comes with and if realtime data/recording works flawlessly before it is shipped. So the pin code on the back of your module should work.
Have you tried to power down your VESC, force close the Metr app, turn off bluetooth on your phone, turn back on bluetooth on your phone, power on your VESC and reopen the Metr app? After that try to connect to the module again. If that does not work please send us the log file and we will figure out what went wrong.

@ducktaperules Glad that it works for you now.

@E1Allen You need to connect **3.3V, GND, TX** and **RX**. TX and RX can be swapped, Metr Pro will auto detect that on startup and work anyway. So no more trouble with the right TX/RX placement. :smiley:
**It is not possible to power your module with 5V!** 5V is just routed so you have the 7pin count like on most VESCs (so it is only possible to plug it in one way) and to have 5V accessible for future accessories that would need it. So right now the 5V isn't connected to anything so **can not** be used to power your Metr Pro. 3.3V is required to power your module.
SWD and SWC pins are just used for initial flashing so you can let them unconnected. Firmware updates are possible over the air, so no SWD necessary.

Metr-pro BT module and app working well but unable to use with Ackmaniac-Esc monitor app.  I'm using Dual Vesc6 and latest EXTENDED ACKMANIAC-ESC Tools 3.102 and Android 7.  This app works with BT5 module.  Small point I notice Metr-pro firmware update option doesn't show latest firmware.  Finally compiled latest version of ESC tools for Linux and and Win and was unable to connect using bluetooth, is it possibly only select versions are supported?

Im having issues getting my Metr Pro up & running.  I am running dual FocBox's with Ack's 2.54 with Can Bus.  

This is all I see is...
![image|281x500](upload://p9rix53fmTAvZqyS1KqukfzfxTW.jpg)

Oddly, this is what I see on the Settings tab...
![image|383x180](upload://tx53rX5XE41tZNC6nzV0MiOXxPq.jpg)

It's weird that the app sees the Metr Pro version but not the VESC firmware or hardware version.  On the adaptor itself the blue light is solid when it connects, then starts a double blink every 2 seconds, but its not the same as when its not connected.  The green light is solid.  No red light at all.  

I've rebooted and restarted my phone multiple times.  Its a Pixel running Android 8.1.  I pu my old HM-10 on the 2nd VESC and it still works fine with Ack's app.  Ack's app does not show any data when connected to the Metr Pro.

@rpasichnyk any suggestions?

* Edit:  I uninstalled and reinstalled the app 2 times, PeriMetr also does not see the Metr Pro module.

Hi Roman !
Found some spare time to test this Metr Pro.
First, as we told, JST connector has to be swapped.

First feedback after a quick try : 
- My Macbook Pro can't see the Metr Pro (MacBook Pro 2017).
- In the parameter menu of the module (where you can change the name and see FW infos), the module says that VESC FW is up to date even if it can't communicate with it.
- No problem on Android 8, OnePlus 5T
- TCP bridge works amazingly fast comapred to the previous module ! That makes direct connection to the laptop less needed as this works flawlessly.

Thank you very much again, can't wait to play more with this piece of engineering.

No it wouldn't. On macOS you need to perform pairing too. The difference is that Windows doesn't allow apps to initiate pairing procedure, it has to be done by the user in the Control Panel. Hence I wrote a separate post describing how to do it. With macOS it's much more intuitive, everything is done in the app.

I did not noticed any performance difference to the bigger antenna. When you compare antenna gain it is 2.5 dBi for the bigger antenna and 2.0 dBi for the smaller one. So in theory when mounted the antenna correctly you should get a slightly higher range because of the narrower and longer main lobe. But thats just theory and in reality you most likely will not notice. :slight_smile: The main advantage of the external antennas to be able mounting them outside your carbon enclosure or anything else dampening the electromagnetic field massively applys to both antennas. 

It would be possible for us to sell the antenna separately, but also without tracking number shipping is a lot more expensive then what is possible when ordering from China. So here a link where you can get those:

Hi @rpasichnyk Im sorry to be one of those guys and I'm probably doing/done something wrong but i've recently go one of your dongles, i've followed all the steps on the site and i'm not getting any data from my vesc's.

I've got it installed to my second vesc (ID1) which is set to PPM & UART and the UART is set to 115200 bps but i'm not getting any data through.

Even when clicking on the cog of the module in the app i see the metr pros version but its not pulling any version data from the vesc. i've tried this on stock 3.38 and also your custom 3.28 (if that's still valid) but either FW i'm not getting any telemetry.

Do you have any suggestions on why i may be having issues?

Many thanks in advance for your assistance.

@webst there is a plan which involves SD card. There are additional pins routed on the back of the module for that. No ETA though.

Btw. @rpasichnyk just ordered the basic module for 40 euro, but i got charged additional 10euro for VAT. ? I thought you where within EU ?
[/quote]

Yep, the site adds ‚Ç¨10 VAT and ‚Ç¨12 shipping even if its coming from a city an hour away in a flat pack bag.
so a ‚Ç¨40 module ends up costing ‚Ç¨62. Then if you want to add a ‚Ç¨3  [antenna](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/-/32848962210.html?spm=a2g0s.13010208.99999999.299.53b63c009ZRAIc) its another ‚Ç¨12 plus ‚Ç¨3 VAT for a total of ‚Ç¨77 

Shipping is far overpriced for Europe . I sent a 5kg box to sweden from Germany last week tracked for ‚Ç¨15, so I don't see how a 20g module sent from an hour away in the next city over and cost almost the same price is justified ...

@Silverline you can connect either to master or slave, it doesn't matter. We only supply 7p connector as it works just as well in 8p slot, you shouldn't have any issues with that. Please check the pin order on your ESCape, if I recall correctly they are in reverse order. Not just RX and TX, all pins are in reverse order. Would be great if you confirm that and let us know ;)

Yes, ADC3 is the 8th pin added on HW6 VESCs (official and alternatives).

If you don't want to bother you swapping all the Metr Pro wires, just leave free (but isolated by heatshrink for example) Swd, Swc, and 5V.

Benjamins version just supports BLE for Linux systems. To get Windows and Mac support you need the linked version with slightly code changes.

Great to hear that it is now working for you. Benjamins VESC Tool got updated to version 0.95 which added FW3.39 support. That 0.95 is what Romans version is based on. After that Benjamin updated version 0.95 to also get FW3.40 support but doesn't changed the new version to 0.96 but is still using 0.95 as version number.

What VESC version are you using? I got some random overcurrents with HW4.12 in the past. Please note that this fault has nothing to do with your Metr Pro module and is just based on your VESC. Metr Pro just visualize the over current error inside your record/graph as @oyta said.

With battery min (regen) of -30A I guess you are using LiPo? It seems too low for LiIon.

You can lower the motor min to at least -60 per VESC to get more power on the breaking with low duty cycle.

And what is your absolute current Max?

Yeah... So with -30a i should'nt get any "over current" fail ? As you can se, i wasnt even braking a lot, only slightly. Or do my braking force need to be higher, to not get this failure. 
Yes i'm using 12s graphene lipo. 

Absolutely max, is default for vesc 6, so i guess 130a if i remember correctly.

@E1Allen but i was barely braking :-/
But what i can se is that the voltage was 50,4v, wich is a full charged 12s lipo. Could i Cold solder join, on the two big capacitors , give some sort of voltage spike ? And trigger over-current failure ?

Sorry for the late response. Wasn't at home the last days, so all open orders will be send tomorrow.

@gmurad I don't have a Android wear device, so I can just answer my presumption. When I understand it right Android wear is just a "light" Android system where Apps are installed over the phone and enable a connection through your phone. So my assumption is that Android wear devices connect to your phone and your phone to your Metr Pro module. But it looks like there are also watches out there running a "full" Android like the one @Klattrup is using where you can directly connect to the Metr Pro module like you can see in his post https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/configuration-and-telemetry-for-vesc-ios-android/13483/913 Maybe someone using a Android smartwatch can tell you more.

@epster On average we ship orders within 3 days. [s]We are running out of small antennas right now, so maybe there could be a delay when ordering a module with small antenna the next days.[/s] To get an idea about delivery time of the currier have a look [here](https://www.deutschepost.de/content/dam/dpag/images/B_b/Briefe_ins_Ausland/downloads/dp_laender-und-laufzeiten-2017.pdf). 
To get an idea about the differences I would recommend to read the first post of this thread. All things like BLE encryption, support for all known apps including VESC Tool on desktop systems, baud rate and TX/RX detection, firmware updates over the air for both the Metr Pro module and the VESC, faster update rate etc. are only available for Metr Pro. The standard Metr bluetooth module just behave like a serial bridge, while the Metr Pro is running its own firmware and enables a lot more opportunities. And you are right that eskating currently just sells "old/standard" Metr modules.

@plasteroid I think you are not running the adapted version of VESC tool that has some small BLE changes. You can read more in that post: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/metr-pro-next-gen-bluetooth-module/57780/94

Edit.: Small antennas are out of stock now.

I've just received my metr Pro module, works like a charm, the app is really cool and uploading the datas is really easy. Thanks !

I have some questions though:
https://metr.at/r/jP7nx

- As you can see on the data, I don't have the motor temperature. Does it work only with sensored motors ?

- The RPM is not correct. I'm running a 100Kv Outrunner at 12S, meaning the motor can't spin faster than 5000 RPM. Yet, the maximum recorded is 20 000RPM. 
Does anybody knows how to set the app so that I get the right RPM ?

The rpm you are referencing is the ERPM which is the more commonly referred in terms of the Vesc. Is you divide the erpm by the motor pole pair (normally 7) you should get the proper rpm.

So i was happy to get the metr pro and immidiatly got disappointed as it uses both ADC. So what do i do now? I wanted to use it for my Ebike project and I have regen braking on ADC2 and Throttle on ADC1... I know i should have checked this before but why does it even need those two ADC? I know i could bypass with a arduino nano to PPM but honestly... this seems way overcomplexed. That moment when you dont check every detail...

No, it doesn't use ADC. It only uses TX, RX, 3.3V and GND.  You can safely use ADC for your own needs. We supply Metr Pro together with 7pin cable just because it's easier for us. Think how much time it would take to remove those 3 wires from the each cable over and over again ;)

Could you please provide some guidelines for dummies on that?

Routing on the module for those pins is needed because they (I guess @hexakopter ) use them for programming the nRF51 chip (refer to the silkscreen marks).
But once connected to the VESC, it's not use anymore. ;)

Still, it's smart from them to design it the most "plug-and-play" way.
The counter side is that for some uses (like ADC), it's a bit less convenient.

@rpasichnyk : this point should be explained in your FAQ/guide, shouldn't it ?

[quote="hexakopter, post:252, topic:57780"]
I did not noticed any performance difference to the bigger antenna. When you compare antenna gain it is 2.5 dBi for the bigger antenna and 2.0 dBi for the smaller one. So in theory when mounted the antenna correctly you should get a slightly higher range because of the narrower and longer main lobe. But thats just theory and in reality you most likely will not notice. :slight_smile: The main advantage of the external antennas to be able mounting them outside your carbon enclosure or anything else dampening the electromagnetic field massively applys to both antennas.
[/quote]
I hope that helps you a bit to decide. Speaking for myself I am happy with the PCB antenna without any dropouts, but I am not using a carbon enclosure and the phone is near to the module all the time.

Yes you can add the external antenna later with resoldering a very tiny cap to a different place. When you don't have good solder experience I wouldn't recommend doing that yourself. Yes it is possible to get the module without any antenna. Do you need the u.FL to IPEX connector already connected or without antenna and without connector? Please send a request to support@metr.at about what you need especially.

@Pimousse We will update our FAQ/guide over time. Thanks for your suggestion. We will add that later.

Hello guys,

I need help and advice or tips or everything that can help me to fully record my rides! Plzzz

I can not record a single complete ride with metr.pro, what are your parameters side phone those who have an Android?
I removed the battery saver, I activity the non-pumping battery restriction of the apps, I increased the standby time of my phone ...
The apps shut up like that from one moment to the next.
Clearly, when I ride I look very often my phone to just avoid it removes my ride and yet, just like that, when I re-open my phone the app is no longer open!! Grrr, I have to re-click on it! And so it re-opens like the ride had never existed.
Why does not she save at least everything that was first covered?
And then it should automatically resume the record since I activated the autostart record mode?
So that's because the apps close itself, but why?
Has anyone ever met with the problem?

I have the automatic update ...
But I have trouble since the metr module BT 1st generation.
FW 3.40 (FSESC4.20) but I had the problem with my VESC6 too.

So I guess it my phone or the apps the issue, not the module disconnection?
Or is that what would cause the spontaneous break of the apps?

Thanks for your help :pray:

@all Just want to let you know that all Metr Pro antenna options are back in stock.

@Riako I would guess its some problem with your phone. Do you have the chance to use a different phone from friend/family and give it a test? It would also be helpful when you send a log to support@metr.at so we can have a look if we spot something wrong. Maybe also reinstalling the app like @mmaner suggested could help fixing your problem.

so 've been dicking around with my new metr pro module all morning... I bought two, one for my ride and one for testing and reviewing shit that moves around between Betty and Jake's board. 

i think i have everything figured out. 

so which app gives me the video overlays with speedometer dashboards and shit? i keep seeing that in various places. Can the metr pro feed those kinds of video apps with data as well?

So I have a question about ride data. I have 2 vescs of can. Both double data and dual data were on. Is the energy consumption shown for both VESC or just one? 

Edit: also, how can I tell what the fault was? There is a little red 1 on the trip data. ![image|281x499](upload://tAXvuujSlp3fNmPQ0etFdOnqGIT.jpeg)

Normally there should be a pink strip on the diagram for the duration of the fault.
I can't see anything on your diagram but I do see a point around 23:30 where the voltage dropped to 9.0V so this would be registered as an under voltage fault.

Maybe worth a shoot to try, when you go to the multitask screen, usually left bottom of the navbar, there is a lock on the top right part of the screen, this will lock your app to not be closed.

It a bit annoying to have to buy a new phone to could make all work .... but what we didn't do for passion !?.. :smile: 

So, it's why Im asking for some advice about phones that will work for sure and perfectly with your module.
I got 3 Metr.at and Metr.Pro module, and would like to could use them on my esk8, eMTB and eDirt, I know it a phone problem... and would resolve that :blush: 
I will try the Surfer tips and friends got an old Samsung to give it a try ... hop this old boy will handle it !

I am glad it helped, thank you @Surfer! The Wh consumption is indeed wrong, and that's because of 2 reasons:

1. Something is wrong with your wired connection between VESC and Metr Pro. I remember you have a lot of UART errors in the log. Check the cables?
2. There is a multiply bug in current Metr Pro firmware, which usually happens after several UART interruptions. We have a fix coming soon. It will be the first official Metr Pro firmware update :slight_smile:

You can upgrade Over The Air

1. Power on.
2. Go to Settings, click on blue gear
3. Click on Upgrade

https://gph.is/2OVBZIy

If you have issues connecting to Metr Pro after upgrade, go to your phone settings and turn Bluetooth Off and On again (happens on some really old phones).

The new firmware includes support for DieBieMS :heart: and FOCBOX Unity :rocket: (beta, no Modes yet). Also highly recommended if you experience multiply bug (@Riako, @rene)

This might be Startup Mode. From the Modes tab you can assign one of your modes to be a startup mode and it will automatically apply when you power on your VESC, even if your phone is not around.

To disable this, open Modes tab, click on the menu dots above and select Clear Startup Mode.

Yes, it's very hard to see a fault, when a record is so big. Try to make smaller records next time. But here you go:

![30|605x500,70%](upload://P0TcHLzFBtzZppmj1YRezUAjj2.png) 

Unfortunately that doesn't help much, because the fault code is 138 which seems like corrupted data and not the real fault.

Did you update Metr Pro firmware to latest?

Thx Roman, seems to work great directly :+1: 
I make the upgrade open air just now after the evening ride, it just a minute !
And it corrects the Wh consume (? right ?), directly of my current ride from I don't remember exactly to 117Wh (therefore I was around +200/230Wh ... with my 185Wh pack at around 35% at the end of the ride). Cool !
I check as you told me the wiring of the module and put some more heat glue to fix and secure all.
Now when I write modes it well applies to only 2 vesc ;)

you can convert the meter file to .json. There you have a field called "speed". just ad "?format=json" at the end of the URL. 

If you got access to Matlab I can send you a function to convert .json files to .csv (with the same structure as on acks app and so on.

When you go to "Settings" -> "Location" -> "Prefer GPS", is it enabled? When you don't have GPS available and use the VESC ERPM value for speed and distance calculation please turn "Prefer GPS" off and check that "Settings" -> "Motor" -> "Motor poles", "Wheel diameter" etc. are set correctly.
In the realtime tab the speed and distance is shown correctly?

I wanted to chime in and say that the Metr module is working great. I was worried about not buying the version with the extended antenna, but I haven't had a single disconnect, even if I am in a different room as the module. 
I had an issue with some weird numbers recorded (I think the odometer) but that was fixed in the latest update.

Thanks for your reply. Under the location tab, everything is on and GPS Accuracy is "0".
On the motor tab, everything is setup correctly. 

Regarding the real time data on the app itself, the current speed works, but the distance does not.
Any suggestions?

As I said, please disable "Prefer GPS". You can also click on the little question mark beside each setting, to get an idea what it is for. That way you also record your GPS coordinates to see them on your uploaded record later (when GPS was available), but your distance and speed also works without GPS. Just in some rare cases where your motor does not spin all the time (like freewheel etc.) I would enable that setting.

Hi @rpasichnyk, some people, me included, have troubles with writing configuration.
It happened to a guy when he applied a mode. Metr Pro messed parameters up.

However, this works using Metr app.

Ok, more details gathered :

- Dude A (Tartopom) : Metr Pro, FW 2.18 (raptor 2 downgraded).
He applied a custom Beginner mode, no issue. Then he came back to full power mode. This messed CAN ID and BLDC Hall sensors table up. Others parameters like Motor/batt min/max current were ok.
- Dude B (Thomas P.) : after switching modes, nothing was working (no much more details). Don't know the FW (only Metr app version : 3.3.1 )
- Dude C (@goldenkiller) : same issue as Dude A (BLDC Hall sensor table values mixed) using Metr Pro + FW3.40. Not sure about CAN ID.

Other bug reported by Dude A : After having created a new mode in Metr app, if you want to delete another one, sometimes it deletes 2 modes.

That's all I could gather from french Metr Pro users.
If you need more info, feel free to ask.

Cheers !

I may be alone in this request, but does anyone else here think the following would be a useful feature?

Metr app notifies (Vibration and/or pop-up) when battery has reached additional specified voltages.

I realize these notifications exist for low and cut-off voltages, but it would be nice to have one for charging as well. I don't like to charge my batteries all the way to 4.2v, which means that I need to keep a constant eye on Metr or the meter on the board. Plus, I can be a forgetful person.

Might be wrong thead but anyhow this is an automatic brake if your remote disconnects ‚Äútimeout‚Äù . Most people leave it off as it can be dangerous if set wrong. Needs road testing and adjustment.

I think its intention is to stop a runaway board. But if its set too high it could be real bad, imagine your riding along at high speed, your remote disconnects then the brakes come on hard then you fly like sack of potatoes into traffic. FUN!

What do you mean with "_without doing anything_ it jumps from 28 up to 39"? Do you mean that when you strain the battery while driving and then stop, the battery level goes up? Thats normal because the value is calculated from the battery voltage which goes down while you are pulling some amps.

@rpasichnyk Back when you first released this app, I was competing with my own app. I quickly brought some updates, and I noticed it kept you on your toes to keep innovating also. I slowed down in development, but you have pushed 5 light years ahead.

I was upset at the shit that happened back then, but I can't let that stop me from using the best tech, so I will be ordering a module soon. My 1 request for you though, is please, PLEASE, add support for 4 vescs instead of just 2. I saw you mentioned it's possible with this new module, just not implemented. I've been seeing a lot more 4wd boards lately, so I know I'm not the only one waiting for this!

Love the diebms integration. Could you post a wiring diagram for this? Is it just the CAN L VESC -> CAN L BMS and CAN H VESC -> CAN H BMS?

Please, 4wd support asap! If you need a beta tester for it, I'm happy to do so.

Ok, I'll check again. There's actually 4 threads (3 were group buy threads, and there's info all over these threads I'm finding), so It's a bit messy, which I why I'm asking for clarification. The DieBieMS also has 5 pins from the canbus to the 4 on the vesc. I saw this picture:

Do you know what 0R is? This doesn't seem right either, as CAN H and CAN L are the middle 2 pins on the vesc...

After some more testing I discovered it usually happens after the board has been stationary for a while like at a stop light or while taking a short break to rest my feet. A simple restart of the board and it's good again until the next time it happens. No startup mode has been applied nor does it happen when any changes are made in the app. 

I will send logs soon.

@Sharukh5996 Respond to your mail that you have send to support@metr.at.

@mikenyc Some 16mm clear heat shrink. Unfortunately I don't remember the actual source. You should be able to find some online when searching for "16mm clear heat shrink".
The whole JST 7pin 2.0mm header broke off? Never heard about something like that and it must have been more then just vibrations to brake it. Is it possible that a bigger force was pulling on the connector, like a loose battery or something like that? Would be great if you can send a picture of the broken module to support@metr.at if you took one.

The motor and wheel pulley count of 1 for direct drives is correct. Not sure about the motor poles of the Carvon hubs. But because the max speed of 60kph seems right to the motor specs the motor poles count should also be right.

Why do you think the energy consumption is off? The motor settings you show are just used for rpm based speed calculations.

I ran into a weird problem today. When I set a start up mode and then change modes after I switch on the board with the metr app on it applies the new mode but it leaves one motor behaving like it hasn‚Äôt run motor detection  yet. 
Only way to solve it for me was to run motor detection again with the desktop app and not use the start up mode since I narrowed it down that it only happens with this mode, and it does so every time. 

I‚Äôm using dual escapes with 3.40 firmware and the metr app for iphone.

This is supported. Connect your first board (make sure it is online) and make changes to Motor settings. Turn off your first board. Connect your second board (make sure it is online) and make changes to Motor settings. Turn off your second board. Turn on your first board and you will see settings change automatically.

That is not the same fluctuations that I have seen on the 6.6. 

It may not be your battery sagging but the fact that the voltage drops whenever the current rises suggests that their must be some resistance in the supply...

Are you using Android or iOS?

For iOS you can connect to iTunes and save all .s and .r record files from the metr app and import them afterwards for your new device. I think a iTunes device backup should also work to save all data. When the backup is not working its always good to have screenshots from all your stats and settings so you could change them on the device later manually.
For Android you can get the record files inside the metr app folder on the SD card or where you have installed it.

no, just a wifi/ethernet connection, no BT.

You need a BT adapter/card IF you want to connect directly via Bluetooth to the vesc tool. This works with the Linux and Mac tool (the one modded by Roman). But if you got a metr pro I would stick to TCP, now its hella fast.

Alternatively you could change settings just via the Metr App on the "expert" section

Business wise, it wouldn‚Äôt make sense for him to make the BT on the unities work on METR. Espeically when 

A) The primary income for METR is from the sales of the modules

B) Enertion will not pay him for every unity Metrized

C) The Unity will become the primary dual VESC for the foreseeable future 

More than likely, and business wise, he would either have to make METR a paid app (which would be a loss in income compared to the module) or keep on the current module and jsut update the METR mods to work with the way the unity flirts with UART. This is all speculation of course, but anyone could see why it wouldn‚Äôt make sense for the unity to be meterized without some form of compensation to subsidized the app.

Hmmm I don‚Äôt know my dudes. 2018 saw a series of new ESC‚Äôs and even then the Focbox has stood on top because: 

* Trampa is Expensive
* Stewie‚Äô is mia for the time being making the escapes and escape support severely limited
* Flipsky are for the cost you get them
* Maytech are Maytech 
* Focboxes work and have proven time and time again that they do. 

Now that they‚Äôre gone and more people will want to run an efficient system , so long as the unity‚Äôs switch system works with no problems , there‚Äôs very little that makes it not the optimal choice. 

[quote="StefanMe, post:579, topic:57780"]
I don‚Äôt see why the paid app is a loss in income‚Ä¶ no extra hardware cost, no repairs of module‚Ä¶ just super quick payment by in app purchase.

It‚Äôs not just the cost of hardware that goes into metr but the software  the support to catch and squash bugs, to help configurations and keep up with the latest release... a one time 4.99 a pop ain‚Äôt ganna cut it

Made me wanne ask what the last years top vesc was. As it's just a simple question and you're kinda unnecessarily dissing someone in a demeaning way who has the side of history on his side. As this market is very small I wouldn't be to sure about "the electronics evolution" because only small vendors do the research and development at this moment.

Anyway. The Unity not having two uart ports makes me kinda sad. (Edit: it has 3 lololoool Edit agian: no it doesn't) I think the target audience for Metr Pro contains a lot of people who also want a remote with telemetry over uart, me included. I just ordered a Metr Pro and have a Unity on the bench. So I'm interested in what rpasichnyk will or won't do if the Unity really will be the top dog for the foreseeable future.

What you're missing is that Enertion prior to the Unity has been taking others design's long before they found  @Deodand and the Unity. Not to mention, steals open source code without providing it back as legally required. @Blasto just made the design better. I can vouch for his work because I've been running two vesc-x's for two years that he personally fixed for me. I blew two FOCBoxes in a week the first time I ran them. Not to mention all the others with QC issues. I'm not dissing anyone. I'm stating the facts. This is a evolution. And whether Enertion takes the reigns , there will be evolution regardless.

If what I'm saying is wrong in 2019. I'll actually cut off my nipples and my fianc√©s in place of @brenternet's.

Support for UNITY stock BLE module is not planned at the moment. We discussed this option with Enertion and I am happy we tried. Unfortunately timeframes and resources were constrained and we couldn't come up with an agreement.

What we are working on with @hexakopter is adapting Metr Pro firmware and Metr App to the changes in UNITY code and making sure it all works well. We also have another project in the works, a smaller Metr Pro variant that can be fitted inside UNITY and replace the stock module.

Don't expect it in the next weeks. It will take some time to test, program and source parts. I am in contact with @Deodand about getting a damaged Unity from the final production batch to see if the new smaller Metr Pro module would fit and work. 
Right now we don't have a final production Unity to test the module and there are also other factors that could delay ETA. We will let you know when we could estimate a date.

@jadatmag Your module would be shipped today, but we can also hold it. Please let us know ASAP if you want to cancel the order.
Its not a clean and nice option, but when you cut a hole in the orange silicone case of the Unity and build an adapter cable it could actually work. But I wouldn't recommend that "dirty hack" and see problems with loose connections.

"Location services always on" is not required for this to work.. can you make a short test? Start the app, move it to background, start your board and press throttle, after 10 seconds the record should start.

If you want to get all three functioning at the same time, note that there are actually three tx/rx pairs in total. Looking at the esc landscape from the uart port, there's of course the "external" one, then counting from the top left on the "internal" header, pin 7/14 are rx/tx, 10/11 are rx/tx. So really the Unity includes one more uart port than a regular dual vesc which in my book makes an already leaps and bounds beyond esc even better ü§£ The internal pins are bound to 250k baud right now though, so you'll have to either ask @Deodand or wait for an updated tool where you can change the baud values of those

@rpasichnyk, If I get the pcb version can I put the antenna later(in case I have connection problems)? I have a bunch of those antennas lying around.

Yes, that is possible with some soldering and an appropriate antenna cable. You can find the answer in the [FAQ.](https://metr.at/faq#q33)

_Yes, it is possible but requires some good soldering skills. You need to resolder the 0402 capacitor near the u.FL connector in a different position to change between internal PCB antenna and external antenna._

Hope someone can help.  

Discovered this issue the other day when I was a long way from home and without a laptop resulting in a long walk back.

I configured vesc 0 using vesc_tool_0.95(linux) with via USB then vesc 1 same method and all works fine.  Side note, Bluetooth connection is discovered but doesn't work on Ubuntu8.04. 

Then out on the road decided to change mode connecting via  mobile Metr Pro.  Applied a different mode then immediately after vesc1 no longer responded.  I tried to recover using the expert settings, read the existing setting, change option to enable vesc1, wrote the change then found I was unable to use the remote control. 

When I got home I hooked up the laptop with vesc_tool to find the application and motor was all wrong.   Why would the mode change cause this issue?
    

metr pro version 3.4.14 firmware 3.65 Android 7.1.1 
Dual Vesc6 3.40 
hardware 60

Also I'm unable to connect using ESC monitor.  The app finds the connection, able to enter the security key but after that no data is shown.  Actually never been able to get this app to work with the metr module, tried several installs no luck, perhaps the app is no longer supported?

Did you read your settings before creating new modes?
If you don't read your settings before creating modes default values for motor detection etc. will be applied which will mess up your settings.
As for the ESC monitor app, I can not comment, haven't used it yet.

Sorry for this. Actually happened to me once as well, had to push about 2km back home, it sucked! I don't know the reason, but it never saw it again, it feels like the stars have to align for it to happen. I was never able to reproduce this issue. If you can, this will be great. Find the reliable way to recreate the problem and send logs!

About ESC monitor app. When we released Metr Pro, it was working. Then after some time it stopped. I don't know the reason and I tried to reach the developer for help, but got no reply. Unfortunately there is little we can do. You can try using the older apk, which should work.

hi,
just finished a build with unity today (at least on the test bench, because still waiting for the board ;-)).
1) connected the metr.pro module without difficulty.
2) entered the pin code without problem
3) enterd all motor and config parameter without problem
4) tryed to update the module  (i'm using unity... so necessary!) with the blue icon
it says my firmware is 3.63 and that 3.65 ( unity 23.41 supporting, witch is my case) is avalaible
i click upgrade and...
start to download for 1 sec then

**Erreur SHA-256 mismatch.**

Any idea?
(blue led is ligthing and green blinking on the module)

Posting here for posterity, but for people wanting to use Metr + some other uart based peripheral, here's the link to the firmware file with internal ports running at 115200. This also has the low speed braking fix.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ng-Gk0CU3XOB-D-ocXVkNCycbUTCykwM/view

Here's the pinout

![image|690x200](upload://xAv3R5dE3hGz15NaeyPIX05moec.png) 

This specific firmware is supposed to have UART2 enabled at 115200. I'm unsure if UART1 is running at 115200, it may still be at 9600.

@bevilacqua thanks so much for that! How are you doing this wizardry?! 

Any idea why the current would go into over current instead of just limiting? Is it anything to do with traction control as that was kicking in a lot on the mud and gravel?

It‚Äôs a flipsky dual 6.6.  Do I just need to raise my absolute max figure?

These are my settings....

I'm not sure how this happens, but I had it once too on 4.12HW vescs when I tried to climb a way to steep ramp. Probably rising the absolute current setting helps, but I am not sure what the absolute-max-rating of the MOSFETs in in FS6.6 vescs is.

Im working on a kind of longer paper (UNI work) where I analyze e-skate telemetry.  I have some scripts to automatically read all the values in Matlab.

Just got my Metr installed. Few questions. When I go into Expert and read. Is it reading both VESC or just the can ID i have set in settings?

In theory, would I change the settings for Master, go to settings, enable CAN FWD, change ID to slave, and go back to Expert to change settings for Slave?
```

## \#727 Posted by: rpasichnyk Posted at: 2019-02-16T06:06:25.993Z Reads: 189

It is reading the VESC that is currently selected on the top of the screen. To read another VESC, just select another one and click Read

![12|319x500](upload://wJ6GI42IYOxWDntLG1wDqqi0o80.png) 

CAN FWD is almost never needed and not recommended to use at all. Unless you are absolutely sure what you are doing. All Metr functions (Modes, Expert, Realtime, etc.) work just fine without enabling CAN FWD.

I tried this but when I try to read VESC 2, it appears to be the same as VESC 1. I scroll down and both list the same CAN ID. 

Example:
VESC 1 > Read > view CAN ID : 0
Go to VESC 2 > Read > view CAN ID: 0

Thoughts on how to correct this? Or possible bug?

Running dual FOCBOX 

I‚Äôm familiar with CAN FWD as that‚Äôs how I typically program my VESC from an externally accessible USB port. Just wasn‚Äôt sure if i needed to do somewhere here.

Edit: I should add that if I do back out to settings and enable CAN FWD, then read VESC 2, it will change to CAN ID: 1,  but if I go back to view VESC 1, it also updates to show ID 1.

@rpasichnyk I noticed Expert only saves the current VESC, and there's no way to rename or label master vs slave. Could you add either the naming of saved configs, or add VESC 1/2 to the default save name? I accidentally loaded my Master settings to my Slave which caused a bunch of havoc.

Edit: never mind. I see log pressing the file allows you to rename...

Under the expert tab, I only see vesc ID's 1, 2 and 3, I don't see vesc 4.
The module is attached to ID 1.
PPM is on ID 2.
All 4 motors spin correctly together (via canbus) and I can see them all via the vesc tool via canbus. So I know it's a not a physical connection issue.

I played a little bit with Metr data in Jupyter notebok. I was mainly interested in the discharge curve for my battery pack (voltage vs. Wh), but since I was already at it, I looked at some other things, such as Wh / regenerated Wh vs. altitude to see whether regenerative breaking really works (it does! :slight_smile:) or how speed affects the energy efficiency (no strong conclusions there yet). Anyway, [here's](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1glnV74xLNRwdulUe21U-H_lz2T46W0K8) what I have done. There's a lot of scary looking code at the top, but if you scroll all the way down, you'll see some charts.

![41|690x259](upload://mNoqTwX0lduacVxFqz91lJiIhYD.png) 

To analyze your own Metr data with the same notebook, do the following:
- download the notebook (`File > Download .ipynb`)
- upload the downloaded file back to Google Colab
- change the `METR_URL` at the very top
- `Runtime > Restart and run all...`

You can also add more charts to the notebook. I added a convenience `plot` function that's straightforward to use. Or, if there's some other data you'd like to see and don't know how to add it, you can ask me and I'll try to add it.

Thanks @rpasichnyk for doing such complete data logging. It's very useful.

Thanks. I tried plotting that in a scatterplot. Here's what the result looks like (more black = more frequent, logarithmic scaling):

![07|690x434](upload://ja83APaFWKcVonr1FDjicsdyuER.jpeg) 

I added it to the notebook. Not sure it's correct though. I would expect the more frequent points to be inside and less frequent outside, not the other way around.

Edit: Well, of course it's wrong because more brightness is more white. I'm such a genius. :smile: Corrected.

![11|690x436](upload://10HRykBTbFhUwtKvVDYqVYgDKGk.jpeg)

Edit2: A version with the `motorCurrent=0` data points excluded and with linear scaling for the brightness.

But when I launch Metr Pro on andro√Ød it changes master vesc motor setting to the old ones. Even if I don't touch to "Modes" or "Expert". A a result master and slave vesc have different motor current settings.

It's also accumulated data over all ESCs. 
Problem about using data from only one ESC has been the accuracy. Heel side motors take 60 to 65% of the strain, while toe side motors are less stressed. The new code gives you quite precise values.

It is. Raptor 2 motor temp has been debated several times in Unity thread. Heel side glows, while the side is 25-30deg cooler. 
The big difference in strain taken by the two motors was a big issue for accurate RT-Data display. In consequence Benjamin coded the new VESC-Tool with accumulated values from all VESCs. Otherwise your values can easily be 15-20% off tge reality.

I don't have any of the ADC connected and it still works.

You do need to connect both the 5V and 3.3V though, which caught me by surprise. I only connected the 5V first and it kinda worked but the BT connection was extremely unstable. After connecting 3.3V as well it works like a charm.

Edit: 5V actually doesn't need to be connected.

I have done my own measurements today. Here's the data from my two VESCs on a ~10.5km ride. This was ca 7km of paved road and the rest pretty rough terrain in a forest, lots of steep hills (I didn't even think I would make it up on some :)). 12S 8Ah LiPo battery, 2x 6374-149kv SK3, MBS tires.

![45|490x214](upload://c7IlebOR5qbpgFlq0QcDcwxnbao.png)

In my case, it was actually the toeside motor that took more strain (I double-checked I didn't get the readings reversed) and the difference between the two is not even 52/48, so 60/40 or even 65/35 seems exaggerated though I understand that YMMV.

So to convert the board antenna to external antenna I have to move the 0 resistor from the board antenna side to external antenna side. But is it a 0R resistor or a capacitor?

"is it possible to change external/internal antenna afterwards?

Yes, it is possible but requires some good soldering skills. You need to resolder the 0402 capacitor near the u.FL connector in a different position to change between internal PCB antenna and external antenna."

It's hard for me to use this BT module with my feather remote. It uses the uart port. I could connect it to the extra uart ports inside the unity but I'd have to leave the cover off. Additionally, I need to be able the change the baud rates for those specific ports. I know sofu shared that special firmware but for some reason, the unity app doesn't recognize this version and disconnects. Im pretty much SOL.

This new BT direct replacement for the unity one fixes all my issues.

I can collect logs or whatever but would be good if there are known good steps to follow so my logs make some sense (I'll do what seems reasonable for now)  Tried rebooting the phone and uninstall/reinstall of app all results in same pop up message asking for pairing request and pin (tried 0000, or 1234, just loops back to prompt).

This is weird, but thank you for letting me know! I don't have xiaomi at hand but maybe you can collect some helpful information if you have computer which you can connect to your phone with USB.

- Install adb on your computer, enable Developer Mode on xiaomi
- Run "adb logcat"
- Start metr app
- Collect output of adb logcat and send to support@metr.at

If this is sounds too complicated, you can also try reinstalling the app, maybe it will work. Or wait until I get someone who has xiaomi and can help with this issue :bug::hammer:

Yah have had this happen a few times too where I need to cycle the bluetooth on and off on the phone and scan again for it to connect but small inconvenience.  Main problem I'm having now is self imposed, after trying to flash firmware over bluetooth/tcp bridge I ended up putting my VESC in an unusable state.... managed to recover with an ST-Link but I still need to get the bootloader on there I beleive because the USB connection still doesn't work as is so I've been relying on the bluetooth module to update the firmware and configure things for the time being (all working at this point but think the bootloader is still missing so going to continue tinkering, figure I probably can't brick it more than I have already and seems recoverable with ST-link in the worst case scenario)

Did you erase the entire chip u der ST-Link software ?
Once done, flash the firmware and connect via VESC-Tool and burn the bootloader through it.
What's your computer OS ?

Hey yah after trying to set modes in the app the vesc wouldn't respond (metr said VESC is running old firmware).  Once the disconnect happens from the module I tried hooking up over USB but no connection, so connected with stlink and cleared memory using windows and flashed hex file found searching the internet file with bootloader and firmware combined i think.  After flashing that way i regain connection via metr module but still no USB.  After that i tried bootloader upload via metr tcp bridge but same situation basically can consistently wipe and flash with st link but no flashing lights on boot seemingly no USB and can configure via metr module after flashing manually and then can update firmware but think bootloader is still botched.   I have access to windows ubuntu and mac os I've mostly been using windows to erase and flash but also tried with CLI make upload command and rougly same thing happening (flashing looks successful but no device in dmesg via regular usb only connected with st link)

Also things are working fine when configured over the tcp bridge but would be nice to be able to set modes on the fly again and just know whats going on with the USB connection so open to suggestions.

I also had issues burning the bootloader through ST-Link software on Windows.
Erase fully the chip (all the table shall be filled with FFFF), then write ONLY the firmware.
If it doesn't work, check USB port integrity (I mean physically) and try another cable.
If you recover the USB connection, burn the bootloader via VESC-Tool.

I have upgraded all firmwares of my VESC4.12 last weekend, since I'm unable to connect to them via the TCP bridge option and latest VESCtool for mac from your github, a connection attempt results in a firmware unknown error, I do see some bytes send, none received in metr.pro

Could this have to do with the vesc "app" configuration configured as just ppm or none, 
I have two vesc, the master has a ppm/uart solidgeek-ish receiver, The slave VESC connects to the Metr.pro, both VESCs and DieBieMS is connected via CAN (nothing electricly changed, worked fine before the fw upgrade)

Can connect to Metr module, can update Metr firmware, but it can't detect VESC firmware or hardware and seems to be unable to communicate with the VESC to relay information to the Metr app.

I'm running dual VESC 6s over CAN bus, so I decided to update VESCs' firmwares manually from 3.34 to 3.54. When I got the master VESC flashed and got the settings configured (motor and app) the Metr app seemed to be working, got actually some live data running in the realtime window, but after I tried again after setting up the second VESC and got the CAN configured. Well now there is no life in the Metr app again, even though I can connect to the Metr module.

"Enable Permanent UART" is set to True and was not changed from default.

What do?

**SOLVED**: In VESC tool on the **MASTER VESC**; "App settings" -> "General" -> "APP to Use" needs to be set to "control signal and UART". In my case with GT2B PPM RC controller "PPM and UART". 

_I recommend adding this to the FAQ section on_ "https://metr.at/faq"

This is normal to get this fault message in the end of the upload.
You get it because it reboots the vesc and i takes a couple of sec to get it connected again.

To Check if the fw is updated go to the firmware tab and check.

I personally didn't even notice the disconnect message at the bottom of the VESC tool, as I was already expecting it to disconnect upon finishing the flashing and rebooting.

@rpasichnyk hi! Just pulled the trigger on 2 metr pro modules. Super exited to finally have back telemetry with the Unity. I was waiting Enertion's app but will take too long I guess. One question that it's not totally clear to me. I know Metr works with Unity but it is possible to use it with the internal UART port? I read it somewhere but maybe now there is a more clear tutorial to follow. I would like to keep the external one for the remote or other device.
Thank you very much.

I saw the post I was hoping there was a step by step procedure since a lot of people are using unity by now. Maybe @sofu can you make a tutorial for it? A short on √® is fine too. I was wondering the custom firmware allow you to chenge the interla UART baud rate or just change them to 115200 and you cna not play with it? Just to know which device will be compatible with the internal one since some modules use 9600, other 115200. Is the firmware still update or not there are new one? I have seen at least  2 official firmwares updates meanwhile.

Thank you

You got some weird readings at the end there. It goes over 100% duty a few times before the fault is logged. 

What did you do after it happened to get going again?

I had this happen to me once and I kick pushed to get home and while kick pushing it suddenly sprung back to life. 

Escapes fw3.38, maytech 6374 190kv, ali 12s bms bypassed or so I thought (discharge was connected to the charge lead, dumbass me), martinsp push to start v1, samsung 30q 12s6p.

Ok, looks like I found the wrong module... :sweat_smile: 
The Metr Pro modules are meant to pair to a computer or phone (iOS or Android) running the [Metr App](https://metr.at) or any other VESC communication app.
But when you want to challenge yourself and program a functioning code for the heltec module feel free to do it.

Hi, 

Setting:
Metr pro,
Ackmaniac 3.102,
Huawei Honor 8 Adroid 8.0,
2x focbox

Problem:

App finds the module but doesn't ask for the pairing code. Blue led stays on while green led flashes.
I can connect the module to the device (app says so) but no telemetry datas are exchanged.
Any suggestions?

This happened to me too. What I did was I paired it the first time w the ack app. It prompted me for the code. But for some reason it didn't work. I couldn't even pair it w metr app after that.

Here's what I did to fix it:
* Uninstall both apps
* Delete metr under phone system Bluetooth settings. (important step)
* Install metr app first
* Pair metr BT module using the metr app
* Type code 
* Confirm BT is connected successfully 
* Exit metr app
* Install ack app. It should not ask for the code since you have already inputted it. The phone system remembers it.
* Find BT module and connect.

As far as I know, this module does not support concurrent connections. Meaning you can't have both app open. One app needs to be closed/exited first to be able to use the other. 

Hopefully, this helps you.

You and me both! Just received 2 Metr Pros last week for future builds using Unity.... Did the metr team consider just making an adapter instead of a new module? Not sure what are the constraints there.

Hopefully someone will come up with a more streamlined way to use the internal UART port in the Unity. I want to use a Metr pro and a DaveGA at the very least and maybe a custom remote in the future(seems like you can't have more then 2 devices tho)

2018/2019 seems to be a year where a lot of "telemetry" options are available, I feel that the ecosystem as a whole has a lot of redundant efforts going on, imagine the same build using Metr pro, DaveGA and one of the Firefly variant remotes... It would be amazing is this was standardized in some way where you can get all of it in 1 solution.

Technically one NRF 51/52 module is enough
To get telemetry, connect to VESC-Tool and run a remote controller connection simoultaniously. 
The VESC code base is open source for a reason. Redundant module instalation is sort of silly from a technical point of view. If you start to run out of uart ports, you should ask yourself why that is the case.

I totally agree and that's the point I'm making. I wonder what it will take to standardize or to reduce redundancy of the solutions. Metr is not open source but I feel it's the closest "entity" that could expand their efforts to provide an onboard telemetry screen and then eventually a remote controller receiver, a headlight/breaklight controller all in one pcb.

The modules are pretty standard, it is a matter of the software/FW and/or purposely built in software locks. Technically there is no reason why a random NRF 51/52 module shouldn't be able to connect to your Phone/App, telemetry device, remote etc. 
You end up using two or more nearly identical BLE Modules for no other reason than a business strategy (e.g. Software only works with the hardware I sold you, UUID locked). 

We will try our best to offer FW updates for the Open Source-based NRF modules via VESC-Tool and we will bang on remote controller and telemetry solutions that work with a wide range of NRF modules available today. The idea is that you will only need one module and keep it updated FW wise. Benjamin Vedder spent quite some time on coding a FW that allows to use **one module** for **many purposes**, so that you can have a remote controller connection, VESC-Tool connection and telemetry at the same time via the same NRF module that can be upgraded via the VESC. 

In other words: **It is there already.** 

All you need is a open source NRF module solution and cheap small android skate phone in your pocket or strapped to the board.

Green LED flashing means that no UART connection is detected. Makes sure that you enable UART output of your VESC. You will see the green LED going solid when a UART connection is established which is necessary to receive data.
When I remember correctly some people reported that they have trouble with Ackmaniac 3.103 firmware so staying on 3.102 is maybe a good idea.

I would say it is worth it. :smile: Yes, you can program your VESC on the go, program different speed modes and activate them via smartphone and log all your rides via smartphone. Do you have a link to that hardware to be sure it is working? When it is VESC based (from the name it sound its based on the HW4.12) and has a UART port available it will work fine.

@hexakopter @rpasichnyk I'm having this interesting issue with one of my modules. I can connect to it but I can't update the firmware on it. The app says installed firmware is 3.63 and that the module is up to date, but the latest firmware is 3.69 I believe. When the module turns on it flashes red once then the red turns off. I guess this is because it can't read the Unity. I did make sure the baud rate and uart output is turned on, but I think the unable to update firmware issue may be something else?

@oyta VESC firmwares have some small issues and the latest is not available yet to update via Metr app. In more detail, now it generates a random CAN ID based on STM UUID. This was not the case before, where people used to have CAN IDs 0, 1, 2, etc. Because of it settings fail to restore after update and I consider the experience as not acceptable. I will fix this and VESC firmware updates will be available through the Metr app again

Measurements with one number are combined already and measurements that have two numbers are per motor. No settings to toggle. Here is some code from my Unity iOS app.

You can see some stuff like motor temps are still split up but stuff like voltage, input current, etc are combined. Just trust in Metr, they automatically do the correct data display config.

Even if you are not using Metr app, you still get more benefits with Metr Pro:

* Encrypted bluetooth communication protected with PIN - only you can connect to your board
* Antenna for better signal
* Direct BLE connection from your Desktop computer

And you really want to try Metr app, because it has a lot of goodness!:heart:

Arguably Better Data Presentation and exportation, faster compatibles updates allowing the module to be used with vesc that don't follow the main VESC code (FocBox Unity) , protection pin,  and and ios application.

I've read through a bunch of this thread, but before ordering I wanted to check a couple of things to see if this might work as a solution for me. 

I'm in the process of looking for a LCD screen to wire up to my bms, so that I can see my current battery level while riding, as well as monitor my battery while charging so I can make sure it's charging up to the correct voltages etc. Is the data from the Metr via the vesc able to provide accurate (or at least fairly accurate for my needs) voltage info even while charging? (I believe it can from what a couple people said, but I wanted to be sure before I invested). 

Also, are there currently any small board-mountable screens that people have used to display the data? If not, I'd be tempted to attempt something, it would seem all it would need is an android-powered touchscreen...

Yeh I had already looked at that, but from what the thread says there‚Äôs not currently any kits available, and it requires a bunch of soldering and programming arduino to get it working. Unless I buy the Flipsky clone, but I can 3d print my own enclosures for a lot less than they‚Äôre charging. The thread also doesn‚Äôt seem to say how it wires in, I assume it uses the same comms port though which means I wouldn‚Äôt be able to have both options, and having the gps and map tracking etc through the android apps gives me a lot more options.

I may be wrong on all of this, as I‚Äôve not actually used either of these units lol. Just going by what the threads tell me.

Edit:
The Dual VESC I'm getting seems to have 3 communication ports, but as far as I can tell from what people on here say I need to use one specific port for these things to work? So I couldn't have both Metr and Davega working at the same time?

My understanding is that you can connect Metr into one VESCs UART port, and DaVeGa into the other VESCs UART port.  Metr allows you to see the data from both VESCs, while DaVeGa takes the data from the VESC it is connected to and multiplies it x2 where appropriate.  The VESCs talk to each other over the CAN bus, which is a different connector.  CAN bus is what you use if you get a DieBieMS, and that bus supports connecting multiple devices in parallel.

Where can you run into trouble? If you want to use a Metr, DaVeGa, and a Photon.  Those all use UART.

@Darkie02 There are some delivery delays regarding some parts. I can not guarantee, but I am pretty confident that we should get all missing parts before end of this month.
So I think the Metr Pro UNITY modules will be for sale around end of May/ early June.:grinning:

The latest VESC firmware v3.56 is now fully supported. And even ancient v2.18 firmware received quality fixes recently because some people are still using it :skull:

I have a metr pro in one of my boards and love just everything about it.

But I do not quite understand the unity metr module I think. Seeing bioboards using normal metr pro modules with their unitys what exactly is the benefit of a special unity module besides being integrated inside the unity?

Does the Enertion unity app still work beside the metr app?

The benefit of the Metr Pro UNITY is that it fits so well into the UNITY. You just pull out the built-in BLE module that comes with the UNITY and put Metr Pro instead:

And this is exactly the other benefit (more important one :slight_smile:) Otherwise it's the same Metr Pro (almost :wink: )! And you can even use it with all other VESCs - it will work just fine.

metr is not a remote, it logs telemetry, therefore no

You would need to get a remote that can do CC. Alternatively, I think that the mini-remote in combination with Ackmaniacs watt-control can do CC too.

I am sorry, but we will not sell an adapter that connects the standard Metr Pro module to the special internal UNITY port. As already said a while back (https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/metr-pro-next-gen-bluetooth-module/57780/604) it would be needed to cut a hole in the UNITY‚Äôs orange silicone case to have the space for the wires soldered to the 2.0mm 6pin pinheader you would plug into that port. The hole is also needed because there is no space inside the UNITY case for the standard Metr Pro module, so you need the wires to go outside the silicone case. I would also recommend glueing the adapter to the port so you don‚Äôt have trouble with a loose connection.

So it is technically feasible, but I think it is more a ‚Äûdirty hack‚Äú for DIY people than something that we want to sell. But feel free to build an adapter yourself and we will try our best to help you with upcoming questions and support the DIY spirit.:grinning:

Hi @rpasichnyk,
We updated @Manu39 's VESCs to latest FW 3.57.
On my side, no problem, but he bricked his VESC (the one connected to Metr Pro) when he applied a mode.

Unfortunately we couldn't use the other one to reprogram it (since Vedder added the Black Magic probe for SWG prog a bricked VESC with a working one).
So a STLink is on its way to him.

I'm really confused with the mode system. I already bricked a VESC the same way (that was with the old Metr module and a cheap Android phone).
I assume that needs to be fixed mostly on the FW side but cuold you have a look ?

This is my second metr pro(This one has an antenna). I bought this one from a forum member. The issue that I am having is that the module just keeps restarting every 5 second or so. I am using the 5V supply to the module. I am able to connect to the metr pro app but it disconnects and connects every 5 seconds. 

When it disconnects on the app, all the leds go out on the module. So the module is physically turning off. @hexakopter and @rpasichnyk, any idea what's going on?'

I just have the 5V, Gnd, rx, tx connected. I flipped rx, tx to see if that's the problem, it didn't change anything. I know, I know it's auto detect, but just in case. 
I then tried to run the module with rx and tx both removed. It wouldn't even turn on. Is that supposed to happen?

EDIT: Fixed
Used 3.3V and it worked. Somehow 5V was making it restart. I confirmed by going back to 5V.

As stated in the [metr.at FAQ](https://metr.at/faq#q31):

_What pins of the JST connector are necessary for Metr Pro to work?_

Only four pins: 3.3V, GND, TX and RX need to be connected. The cable uses 7 wires to match ESCs 7 pin connector. We can not provide a cable with missing wires and we don't really have time to remove them. **You can't power the module with 5V**.

So you need 3.3V to power the module.

Please consider putting NC on the silkscreen where it's not connected. I just didn't want to put the plug the 7pin directly because I wasn't sure how the 5V and 3.3V would interact. Also I am not sure what SWC and SWD are(no info on FAQ).

@Pantata I don't think I ever saw reconnecting problem. Can you send logs?
Wh/km wrong reading is confirmed and being fixed. The range should reset after a day. Try to check tomorrow. The compatibility with ackmaniac, I really tried to make it work, I can see on my end that request is coming and reply is sent successfully for GET_VERSION command, but then the Android app just seems to ignore it :confused:

After a slightly messy bailout and a shattered IPhone screen, I have been using an old throw away Android phone to connect with my metr and check distance, motor temps, etc... with the throw away phone, I do not have a sim card and use wifi for any network needed.. When i attempt to upload my log files to view on a device with a larger screen, it just sits there and never uploads... in the application log, the error is an SSL Handshake error.. upon watching wifi traffic, no request is ever sent from the application. It seems that the software just kind of ignores the wifi connection and only uses cell.... it would be nice to be able to connect via wifi

I just tested record upload on Moto G4 with Android 7.0 and it worked fine. The phone doesn't have a SIM card, only using Wi-Fi. Please do some more investigation, maybe connecting your phone with USB cable and running `adb logcat` will give you some hints

metr offers two options to record the speed and show it in the upload. One is by GPS data and the other is by RPM and number of poles of the motor and some calculation on wheel circumference. 
It would be very handsome if the raw eRPM or mRPM would show up as an individual channel on the uploaded graphic although the GPS speed is taken as reference. This feature would be helpful for all applications where you use a gearshift and also for propeller driven vehicles. Thank you.

@rpasichnyk

I got the same problem. It hangs at the screen "Don't interrupt..." and I'm not able to upgrade fw. I will send you my log. Thanks for investigating.

By the way: Is with 4.8 the problem fixed, that people brick their VESCs since VESC fw 3.57 and the new, updated VESC tool? When I'm right, there was a problem with changing modes. Or was it when updating VESC fw via TCP bridge over metr? I don't know exactly. I did it via VESC mobile app and everything worked well. But also here I stuck now with VESC fw 3.57 and am not able to update to 3.58. There's another thread in this forum. More people have this problem.

Together with the problem now, that I'm not able to update metr.pro to 4.8. It all starts with 3.57 if you want so, but I don't think it's related.

No, this is not related. The upgrade from 3.69 to 4.8 was a major update that not only includes Metr Pro firmware but also new nordic softdevice and bootloader. This is why update process consists of 2 parts and it's very important not to interrupt it. However in some cases softdevice and bootloader update completes, but firmware is still 3.69. @taz had exactly this problem and we solved it using individual GUID based firmware update. Hope the same trick helps to you.

I'm sure many of you would like to try VESC Tool with direct BLE connection to Metr Pro.
Here you can find the latest VESC Tool binaries for macOS and Windows.

https://github.com/rpasichnyk/vesc_tool/releases

In Windows, you first need to complete new device pairing procedure:
1. Press Start and type bluetooth. Open Bluetooth and other device settings.
![00|294x500,80%](upload://quYeSNojREiCnNWg9oBNafulpoG.jpg)
2. Click "Add Bluetooth or other device
![48|690x425,80%](upload://ArT4M0QgTQ9HmYoLEtNiZUZw0G.jpg)
3. Wait until you see Metr Pro, click on it and enter PIN code
![06|690x419,50%](upload://iDUzkuiIOdLAyNTiIkR0rmMuWEZ.png) 

After this you should be able to connect via VESC Tool

Ah thought so I was cross referencing my focbox and it seems that's the only extra pin. I was also wondering if this will work from the slave vesc  on the flipsky duel 6.6 as I have the Firefly nanao remote i wnat to use that on the master side and the METR Pro on the Slave side is it possible?

None of the versions, have had the module for over half a year, never managed to run the Ackamanic Esc app. It does show the module, it does "connect" but doesn't show any data and If I click on modes or anythig, it will say ESC is not connected. Does it work for you?

I'm using:

* Ack FW 3.102 ( [LINK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ek1vL60n7eza7-dDqQeXCfLRhfMQXofg?usp=sharing) )
* Ack app v1.101  ( [LINK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QGyXueD_3qjdLBn_8hV8rTziXPBnKmaL?usp=sharing) )

This works for me. Make sure you set PPM+UART. Hope this helps.

Unfortunately, ack app only works WITH ack FW. Just use metr app. It's pretty robust.

Can someone explain me (with very little experience) what the Metr Pro is about?

Sorry guys, I just don¬¥t get it. Hope you can help me out ;)

Hello, I would like to find out some info beforei  purchase a couple Vesc6 from trampa. i already have the Metr Pro blutooth module as i was planning on using it with another vesc but it died during test any ways...   they have this Dongle on their site which i assume is just another blutooth module but at a fraction of the cost. i picked up the Metr pro module for its features but i would like to know if its usable in place of the Dongle. since i already have it and have used it a couple of times i really like the features and data it outputs and its ease of use. but im not sure what the difference is between the Trampa Dongle and the Metr Pro module. can i use the Metr Pro module in place of the Dongle. or do i need to use the Dongle and scrap the Metr Pro module i have?

Appologies for my ignorance. i am truely confused here about what i can use. just trying to save my self 20 pounds before making the purchase if i can is all since i already have the Metr Pro module. but i dont mind grabbing it incase i cant use the Metr Pro module if you know what i mean.

Thanks in advanced!

You can use Metr Pro instead of Trampa Dongle. It supports all the functions and is more secure. But if you want to use their new remote Trampa WAND, you need Trampa Dongle.

ah ok dam i was literly just about to ask about that as i was going to get the wand remote. guess ill hold off from the wand then. will metr pro be compatible with the Wand remote in the future or is it simpley pick 1 or the other. i like the feature on the wand remote which has safe reverse brakes for going down hill. basically makes the brakes work properly when going down hill without having reverse set up as i ride with forward/brake modes


Actually is it possible to use Both Metr Pro and the Trampa Dongle so i can get readings to the wand remote as well as record the data on my phone?

Remote seems nice but this is fatal flaw.

How to properly connect metr with diebiems?

I've tried searching forums but had no luck...

I am using flipsky dual 6.6 fesc.

Thanks
```

---
## \#1146 Posted by: rpasichnyk Posted at: 2019-12-09T09:55:14.778Z Reads: 47

```
1. Connect your DieBieMS via CAN to VESC
2. Connect USB cable to VESC
3. Use DieBieMS Tool on your computer and make sure it can access DieBieMS over VESC over CAN
4. Metr app should work out of the box after this. The only thing you need to change in Settings -> Battery -> Battery type to DieBieMS

ANy update on the constant freezes? It's been weeks now... I need 4.08 fw version so I can downgrade... Can you do that for me Roman If you can't fix it the correct way? I have almost no records in last weeks because of that... I did some testing and it has something to do with vertical/horizontal view change on the phone. There is a bug in it, I disabled horizontal view at all, will see If it stops freezing now.

If you want 4.8 fw you have to send module back to us to reprogram. There is no easy way to downgrade the firmware
