It actually looks pretty sweet! I'm not a huge fan of th deck's shape/design, and I'm skeptical about that tiny motor, but otherwise it seems pretty cool

I actually quite like the shape and design, much better looking than that "case board" design. I also like that it fits in a back pack. I grow tired of having to carry my 40" deck around the shops while also trying to get grocery's.

It's one of those things where it's so simple, and you just think to yourself, "Why didn't I think of that?"

That reminds me i need to finish developing the skate strap idea i had a while back. It would let you cary your 40+" eboard (i have one too, i feel ya) over your shoulder like a back pack. Or like a Ninja Turtle, whichever you prefer. 

They have something like that already for regular boards, but i think since some of these rigs weigh as much as 20 pounds, the strap idea needs some attention in the comfort department.

I appreciate this in concept, but wonder whether it would take the abuse of daily commuting. Looks like it would feel a little "Sky Mall" to me :smile:

@claudiofiore88 @longhairedboy I was thinking of getting [something like this][1]

The quicksilver store by my house is closing down, and they were selling everything for like 70% off. They had a dc skateboard backpack got like $20. I should've bought it. I think they might have closed already now that I think of it.

That's pretty sweet actually. What I have in mind doesn't have the bag component though. And will probably be covered in beer caps because i have a giant bag of them i've been saving to craft with for almost 10 years now.

I would expect that hinge system to get sloppy and noisy over time.

It looks really flexy in the video. 

Not good flexy like a loaded board either

Yeah that concerns me too. although it appears to be made out of carbon fibre, so its probably quite strong. only time will tell I suppose.

bamboo, carbon fiber, and high tech plastic. 

Why don't they paint it pink, put a mirror finish on one side and call it the Compact? Then they can sell it with a purse instead of a backpack and capture an entirely new market.

I like the idea, but I think it'll have some issue with the structure. For example, will the hing move when you hit bumps or pebbles. This reminds me of the razor scooters. Everyone had to get a razor because they could fold up. But that hing was terrible, bending every time I stood on it, making tricks or even riding it dangerous.

And people can't judge hill steepness. To say it can go up 12% is useless for most people. There will be people of try for steeper hills and will break their boards. Why not at least put a dual drive?

That would likely put the price out of thier comfortable margin. Double the motors means double the money on the whole drive system.

The thing is, if you want something to work, you don't build it as cheaply as possible. You build it as sound as possible with the price in mind. my competitive skateboard for example, costs almost $300, far above your typical non-motorized skateboard. However, Its packed full of technology, including ceramic balled bone bearings, 6 layers of Canadian maple + 1 layer of carbon fiber in my deck, and titanium trucks (much lighter and 2.5 times stronger than steel trucks). However, I can actually use it for what it was meant for, which is skateboard fast, hard, and big stuff.

This may end up being a great board. But until I try it myself, its just a great idea, not a great board.

I feel yah. I've got about about $250 in my push board all said and done, and i'm not even using titanium trucks, just caliber IIs. Its totally worth it though. Super stable, stupid fast, feels great in fast carves, and takes a fast downhill with no worry of wobbles. I'm sure if i rode your board i'd feel the quality right away too. 

But that's not the objective with this device in my opinion. This is high margin hardware designed to leverage the current PEV environment to extract money from people who have it laying around and don't know what to do with it. 

I didn't want to say it was total crap because that would be unprofessional.

I don't have any picture of it per say, as I switch decks at least once a month due to wear a tear and just changed trucks, as I wore out the pivot cup in my old pair (I did have them for almost 2 years).

But here's my latest video part which has the board in it:

@longhairedboy that's what I was getting at when I referred to it as "Sky Mall" ... for those who don't use Delta Airlines, the "Sky Mall" catalog is an in-flight catalog where you can buy a lot of low-quality novelty items, like a [fake dinosaur head][1] or other crap that will break as soon as you unwrap it.

Nice design, they're claiming 160wh battery from 18650, and at full length and the board is 33 inches, 10" wide.

top speed is 17mph.

They will need to beef up the hinges,  if they want to take on our heavy consumers instead of lithe females. Plastic trucks and hinges have to be very strong,  but it's probably a good engineering choice if you manage it.

The design is attractive! They have to strengthen the mechanism anyway It seems to be something different from the normal electric skateboard. It will be nice to bring it inside the hand luggage in the plane! Let's see when they will launch the production..

They're going to do a kick starter in a month, and it's got more battery than a boosted board.  160wh. It looks like they went with HTD 3 mm pitch with an idler pulley drive train (smart)

The engineering looks solid, and they're making everything purpose built,   Custom trucks. glass-fiber nylon probably.?

The charger should be minimum 200w according to the literature, without accounting for any charging losses. The hinge and the fast charging are definitely innovations.

 I think it **should** be single drive, and if they can put a 12% grade with a 210 pound load that seems more than enough.  Don't forget it's still a folding light weight design. Single motor is improved range, too.

If everything is injection molded, they have a better business model than boosted. The BOM is less $ since they don't have to pay Bear for trucks or Loaded for a deck.  The parts are going to be cheap if Kickstarter pays for the injection molding start up cost.  

 I think other boards are probably more fun, but this is a very practical Board.

 Lighter, slower, more range, 83mm wheels, faster charge, and tiny. That folded package is amazing.

@Long_Stunt I just flew with my Boosted as my personal item. I did call Virgin Atlantic in advance and a skateboard is considered a personal item approved as carry on. TSA supervisor asked me to tell them what type of battery was in the board (found out after) their only concern was what type of battery was in the board magic word was LITHIUM. (Guess too many of those cheap Chinese balance boards lighting on fire has spread the bad news fast all over). She said the fires was main reason lithium was not allowed.
Good thing I read the Boosted Boards website and quoted them: 
"Our battery is UN38.3 certified for commercial air transport and is 
under 100Wh capacity. We are compliant with the regulations regarding 
transport of the board on most passenger planes." I left out the word most when I quoted it.  FLY safe my friends.

Thanks for the info @Long_Stunt. Just found this on TSA site:

					Pack Safe
					
Lithium ion and lithium metal batteries, spare (uninstalled)

Rechargeable and non-rechargeable lithium batteries, cell phone batteries, laptop batteries, external batteries, portable rechargers Spare (uninstalled) lithium ion and lithium metal batteries must be carried in carry-on baggage only.

When a carry-on bag is checked at the gate or at planeside, all spare lithium batteries must be removed from the bag and kept with the passenger in the aircraft cabin. The battery terminals must be protected from short circuit.
						
This covers spare lithium metal and spare rechargeable lithium ion batteries for personal electronics such as cameras, cell phones, laptop computers, tablets, watches, calculators, etc. This also includes external battery chargers (portable rechargers) containing a lithium ion battery. For lithium batteries that are installed in a device (laptop, cell phone, camera, etc.), see the entry for "portable electronic devices, containing batteries" in this chart.
						
Size limits: Lithium metal (non-rechargeable) batteries are limited to 2 grams of lithium per battery. Lithium ion (rechargeable) batteries are limited to a rating of 100 watt hours (Wh) per battery. These limits allow for nearly all types of lithium batteries used by the average person in their electronic devices. With airline approval, passengers may also carry up to two spare larger lithium ion batteries (101-160 watt hours). This size covers the larger 
after-market extended-life laptop computer batteries and some larger 
batteries used in professional audio/visual equipment.
						
Quantity limits: None for most batteries – but batteries must be for use by the passenger. Batteries carried for further sale or distribution (vendor samples, etc.) are prohibited. There is a limit of two spare batteries per person for the larger lithium ion batteries described above (101-160 watt hours per battery).

Batteries must be protected from damage.
						
Battery terminals (usually the ends) must be protected from short circuit (i.e., the terminals must not come in contact with other metal). Methods include: leaving the batteries in their retail packaging, covering battery terminals with tape, using a battery case, using a battery sleeve in a camera bag, or putting them snugly in a plastic bag or protective pouch.

**UPDATE: Swappable Battery Pack**

Source: Linky's Indiegogo Page

_* We’ve done some further work on the battery pack in order to make battery removal simple - this in response in particular to airlines’ continued restrictions on batteries and our desire to make Linky air-safe. We’ve made the design of the battery pack MODULAR in order to make it possible to remove it in about 5 minutes, with a set of tools we will provide. Here’s some details:_

_* **Modular design:** 5 minutes to remove the battery for maintenance reasons or for air transport._

_* Linky will ship with the tools required to open the battery compartment, which is made with highly resistant rigid plastic._

_* If required, you can transport the battery separately from the skateboard on an airplane as carry on luggage. In this way, Linky will be a normal, non battery powered skateboard that you can either bring on board or as checked luggage. The battery, on its own, has a Battery Management System and is approved (homologated) for air transport and can be brought in carry-on luggage._

## LINKY Update:

> **New Electronic**

> We have focused our studies on the soft start and the soft brake as they are features that can strongly affect the riding experience and the safety of the riders. We are really happy with the results obtained. The riding mode "cruise" is provided with a soft start ramp and a smooth brake.

> We are thinking to introduce a sort of " hand brake " mode that will keep the skateboard more stable when it is still. Who is used to starting the ride  pushing and then accelerating will find it a little bit weird. What do you think about this feature? Below a video. Please don't care about the aesthetic of the remote and the skateboard. They are "mules" used for testing.

> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf8I0jPPenE


> **New Trucks**

> We made Linky to cruise into the city! We want you to have a lot of fun but even to be able to ride avoiding the obstacles that you can find on the city streets and to turn on the classic 90degrees corner of a downtown.  

> Here our latest version of Linky's trucks, you can almost do pirouettes! they are quite fun to use :)

Hey everyone, first time posting on the esk8 forums. I'm looking to get into the E-Board hobby. The DIY stuff is fascinating, but I'm on the fence about DIY vs Prebuilt. Right now I'm still in research mode.

I'm super curious about Linky and really would just like to hear some more opinions from people who have been in this hobby a lot longer than me.

What do people think of the speed and range specs? 18.6mph and 9.3 mile range? 

Also, 10% grade is pretty great, they even have a video of the board tackling a 20% grade, how does this compare to a DIY board?

Thanks guys, I appreciate anyone's help.

Cheers.

Johnny, I made my own DIY board a couple months ago. DIY are way better regarding top speed and range, but they often look bulky (except if you are really good with diy stuff and count with some machines as cnc, 3D printer, etc). My board went 40 km/h and had a range of 20kms, I backed Linky knowing that won't even get near that, but after all is a nice finished product that you can't take with you everywhere without having to worry about anything else.

Thanks for the response, Hooch.

Yeah, that's how I feel as well. The DIY performance looks amazing, andI feel like that it is something I might do for the future if I really get into to the hobby, but right now I kind of want to just try something out. I've looked into the Koowheels and the Benchwheels, and they are contenders, but I worry about their reliability. Linky is still an unknown I guess, but the quality seems really high for the price point.

It's good to know that you have done to DIY and still ordered a Linky. Have you tried the Benchwheel or Koowheel?
