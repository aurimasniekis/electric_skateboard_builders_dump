I honestly don't know if this has ever been covered before, but considering everyone I know and have met whom are on pneumatics and the fact that they aren't using this method, I will assume not a lot of people know about it. 

Well the issue is the fact that these 7-8" pneumatic wheels do in fact vibrate a lot and there's really no easy and effective way to conventionally balance them - unless you get some wheel beads! 

I first was introduced to wheel beads a few years ago while attending a track day with one of my bikes. There was a vender there promoting the stuff, and I was intrigued if they actually worked or not. So I bought a kit ($25) and put them on the wheels of my AWD Christini, and wow was I amazed! I noticed a difference almost immediately! Such a simple, cheap and easy to use product that actually works!

How it works - Basically you add these little ceramic beads into the wheel by temporarily removing the bleeder valve / core. How much you put in is calculated by the wheel size, application and use. You close everything back up, add air and you're good to go! Basically, the beads spin within the wheel and will counter any imbalances you have. 

I just added a few grams to each of my 7" Trampa pneumatics and the difference is night and day! The ride at higher speeds is smooth and steady. No more vibes! 

If you're on pneumatic wheels, I highly recommend you get some and give them a try! They're available on Amazon, eBay or on any of the many motorcycle parts and accessorie stores online. Prices usually start at around $15 and go up depending on how much you need.

Aka: counteracting bead, balance beads, ceramic wheel beads... 

They're commonly used on motorcycle wheels, truck tires, and hard to balance all terrain wheels.

Stans Sealant will balance them.

One little 2oz bottle is easily enough for all 4 tubes.

Probably could use a bit less.

No flat tires either.

@DucatiGuy Just wait 2 weeks Trampa will be selling them on their website as an innovation for a premium pricetag :grin: Hate when companies come here for ideas and sell them without any credit to the innovator which in this case is you.

I wouldn't call myself an innovator but more so just an enthusiast, and as such it gives me great pleasure to share with the rest of you (even the manufactures) insight on techniques, and products that I have run across or used that may better the industry and community as a whole. 

I hope Frank and the guys @trampa try the sample I shipped them (which by the way was mailed out today) and if they're as satisfied as I am, which I think they will be, I would love to see it on their website!

I think you can buy that on online for the best price you get. But maybe someone buying wheels will consider dropping it in the parcel to save some $ on postage. So if it works, we might stock some for the convenience of the customer. I doubt it will make us any richer selling this stuff.
We tried the sealant some years back but it can also make a mess out of your tire, leaking in between the tire and the tube.

@DucatiGuy Maybe you dont consider yourself as one but what you did is technically an innovation, accept is as a compliment :wink:
@trampa Nice, you found a name that finally suits you :laughing: Also the customer that is buying wheels at your webpage  will see the beads and wont be able to find them searching on google, expecially if you give them a new name and market as a new product. Im not from yesterday. And my troubles are not far away.........*music reference*

I'm not sure about this one. I'm using the sealant now and though it does decrease chance of punctured tube, I notice an increase in vibration. I wonder if we can combine the balance beads and the sealant together. 🤔🤔🤔

Hey Nate, you wouldn't want to use the beads and sealant together. The sealant would prevent the beads from effectively rolling through the wheel and countering the imbalances. The beads need to flow freely, unobstructed within the wheels to work effectively. The sealant will only inhibit that. 

Sealant alone will offer some initial balancing properties, but as the stuff evaporates and dries up (and yes it will even in a sealed inner tube), it'll negate any balancing benefits, and in some cases may even make the vibes worse. 

The beads, unless you get a blow out, don't go anywhere, they're not messy, and are always working.
```

damn. So either use beads and risk punctures for increase stability and top speed or use sealant and decrease stability but also decrease risk of punctures........guess I'm going to have to start living life at the edge again :smiling_imp:

Cool bro, do it! I always found it such a pleasure to work the older bergs from the early KTM period. Looks like you have the high seat as well.
I put a Dale Lineaweaver jet kit on mine, he is the berg tuning master ;)
He is working on a team bringing the[ ALTA](https://www.altamotors.co/#the-future-of-fast) electric motorbikes to market atm.

& just to keep things on topic...
I never had any wheel vibes on my tard :neutral_face:

Me either.  Balanced with sticky weights, and ghetto tubeless.

I brought my carb to Dales Shop and had him install his jetting kit. 1-1/2hrs drive. He showed up at the track without Alta once. 
 Was racing a 25 year old Honda 150. Kills it @ 60+ years old.

I've seen the Alta up close, its straight up dreamy. Its hands down the best E-motorcycle on the market. 

The Alta SM came in first place In sloppy muddy conditions at the IMS in Sacramento California. 
They are allowed in 250, 450, and unlimited classes.

On topic, here in the states, they use Dyna Beads for dynamic balancing.

Hey bro i am considering buying these Dyna beads as my wheels are not balanced and making noise.

How many Gramms would you add to a single 8 inch trampa tyre ?

You dont have enough for me to buy from you for 4 , 8 inch wheels ?
 looks like u might have exrta.

Hey guys, so the amounts that seem to work best for tires in the 6-8” range, are usually around 2-5 grams per tire. I would start with 2 grams and work your way up in half gram increments till you get the desired results. The trick is to add just enough, and not more than you need.

Also keep in mind, in order for the beads to work, 1 - they must be able to spin freely through your wheel / tube. If your inner tube is kinked in anyway, it’ll inhibit the beads from spinning properly, which may in fact make your balance issues worse, and 2 - to get them to work efficiently, you will need to get up to speed in excess of 8-10mph. The faster you go, the smoother everything will roll.

The beads should flow into your valve without any issue, but on occasion, specially with 90 degree style valves, you may get blockage occurring from time to time. You want to flow the beads in small steady groups. If you notice they’re not going in, you can always take a small piece of wire and pick into the valve to free up the blockage. I’ve also seen people use an old electric toothbrush to vibrate the valve stem, which in return with assist with the flow of stuck beads.

Last but not least, if your vibes are being caused from an out of round tire, the beads will not counter balance such a defect. They may help slightly, but ultimately you’ll need to swap out the tire for a good one to fix the issue. Don’t waste your beads and time trying to fix such a condition. 

Hope this info helps! Let me know how you guys make out.

It's really a unique riding experience. The AWD shines off road, and on the road it enables you to get the most power to the ground without the worry of the rear sliding out underneath you. Hard to really put into words, but I find myself cracking that throttle at points within an apex I would never have in a "conventional motorcycle". I was sold on it years prior when I first saw it at the International Motorcycle Show, and officially became a believer in 2012 when I purchased it new from Christini in Philly. It'a a blast to ride and hands down turns more heads and sparks more conversations than any bike I've ever owned.

I got some beads and it really made a noticeable difference. While filling them (which was a huge pain getting them through the valve) I was wondering: if we fill the tube with some water - wouldn't that have the exact same effect as with the beads plus it's cheaper and easier to fill?

PS: if you don't have a tool to remove the valve insides: a 4mm bullet connector with two of the 4 sprongs removed works just as well :D

I’ve heard about guys using antifreeze, and I assume it should work the same, albeit a little messier if you ever get a flat or blowout. I can’t comment on how effective either or is (in comparison) in terms of the actual physicals, but in theory they both do the same thing.

I tried a few grams in mine today, no difference. However, i think its because my tyres are total crap. I found them very easy to fill, just screw on the plastic pipe that came with the beads. I tried 1 gram then 2 then 3. Ive now ordered new tyres.

If your tires are out of round, abnormally worn out, or if you have wheel / bearing issues (which may be the underlying cause of your vibes) the beads won’t work well. 

Get the new tires, spin them up and see how well everything looks and feels. If all is well, proceed the same way, adding a gram at a time. I’ve found 2-3 grams is usually adequate.
