Good morning, I am the President of RipTide Sports Inc. and we would like to offer our capabilities to make custom parts out of urethane using our open molding process.  As you may know, urethanes offer characteristic that can be modified to suit the product requirement of your design as described below.  Please email me directly at brad@riptidesports.com if you would like to confidentially discuss you idea for a new product.

Polyurethane Advantages
Wide Range of Hardness
The classification of hardness for polyurethane relies on the prepolymer's molecular structure can be manufactured from 20 SHORE A to 85 SHORE D

High Load Bearing Capacity
Polyurethane has a high load capacity in both tension and compression. Polyurethane may undergo a change in shape under a heavy load, but will return to its original shape once the load is removed with little compression set in the material when designed properly for a given application.

Flexibility
Polyurethanes perform very well when used in high flex fatigue applications. Flexural properties can be isolated allowing for very good elongation and recovery properties.

Abrasion & Impact Resistance
For applications where severe wear prove challenging, polyurethanes are an ideal solution even at low temperatures.

Tear Resistance
Polyurethanes possess high tear resistance along with high tensile properties.

Resistance to Water, Oil & Grease
Polyurethane's material properties will remain stable (with minimal swelling) in water / oil / grease. Polyether compounds will last many years in subsea applications.

Electrical Properties
Polyurethanes exhibit good electrical insulating properties.

Wide Resiliency Range
Resilience is generally a function of hardness. For shock-absorbing elastomer applications, low rebound compounds are usually used i.e. resilience range of 10-40%. For high frequency vibrations or where quick recovery is required, compounds in the 40-65% resilience are used. In general, toughness is enhanced by high resilience.

Strong Bonding Properties
Polyurethane bonds to a wide range of materials during the manufacturing process. These materials include other plastics, metals, and wood. This property makes polyurethane an ideal material for wheels, rollers, and inserts.

Performance in Harsh Environments
Polyurethane is very resistant to temperature extremes, meaning harsh environmental conditions and many chemicals will not cause material degradation.

Mold, Mildew & Fungus Resistance
Most polyether based polyurethanes do not support fungal / mold / mildew growth and are therefore highly suitable for tropical environments and FDA applications. Special additives can also be added to reduce this in polyester materials as well.

Color Ranges
Varying color pigments can be added to polyurethane in the manufacturing process. Ultraviolet shielding can be incorporated into the pigment to provide better color stability in outdoor applications.

Economical Manufacturing Process
Polyurethane is often used to manufacture one-off parts, prototypes or high volume, repeat production runs. Size ranges vary from a couple grams to 2000lb parts.

Short Production Lead Times
Compared to conventional thermoplastic materials polyurethane has a relatively short lead time with significantly more economical tooling costs.

Hey David, we don't have a minimum order quantity.  Every project is judged on it individual merits and we are happy to determine if it can be made using our process and what it will cost to do.  The normal way we proceed is to take a look at the part in a 3d file, if it looks like a suitable product that we can make out of urethane, we have you make a 3d print model or we can have it done for you, we then make a proto mold from the 3d male part and reproduce it in urethane for testing functionality as well as fit and finish.  From there, if it is a product you want us to make for you to sell we can produce production tooling and provide you with production quantities.at an agreed upon rate.

Greetings Brad,
I am a big fan of your bushings and pivot cups for Caliber2 trucks.
I am currently running Riptide Krank bushings and very happy with their performance.
There is a need in the Eskate market for more wheel options in sizes 90mm, 97mm, 100mm, 107mm
What we need is soft wheels with high rebound, duro 75 or softer with either a Kegal or Flywheel type hub.
There are many flywheel clones available but they are too hard and have little or no rebound.
Many of us currently use Abec11 flywheel which are good quality but hard to get at times since the demand is greater than supply.

Omg!

I'm so happy to see the president of Riptide around here, thank you for taking the time to offer your services.

We need a 110mm 70A urethane wheel, ultra high rebound, in repsol orange, black and fluorescent lime, but I'm not sure of you will be able to copy the Abec 11 design, so we could continue using the same pulleys. 

We also need to know if you could offer pulleys along with the wheels, how cool would that be, just buy the wheels and select your pulley teeth count, pulley should be made of hard plastic with high tensile strength. 

What we need is a wheel that could hold bad terrains without chipping and at the same time be able to damp all kind of bad roads, rocks and broken asphalt. 

Do you know how hard I is to get a good wheel these days? You need to be all over this right now

Thank you and i really love your enthusiasm but we are not offering to make conventional wheels at this juncture and the last thing I would do is copy a good friend's product line that is rapidly improving as we speak with increased urethane depth through smaller drive compatible hubs.  I would suggest addressing any needs or shortcomings with existing wheels that you perceive directly with Abec-11.  They do listen.

What do you think about risers with channels for motor wiring, I'm not sure of the duro of typical risers but I guess something like that is fine

Here's my diy implementation

nah

a riser pad with cable routing makes uber sense. by bringing the motor wires closer to the trucks pivot point it reduces degridation on the motor wires. It is also clean aesthetically & practically if you use big wheels you almost always have to use a riser with a regular skate deck. make it generic, offer a couple of duros, one for maple one for CF... you have the market covered and could become the preferred choice...

but...
If someone made Moe some thane bushings his three link trucks would be the fastest eSk8 trucks/board on the planet... on cracked dirt the dude did 57mph on rubber bushings. The best the competition can do is 59mph on a airfield. And it wasn't like he needed the run up he never topped out... I'm not making excuses but pointing out fact, he did that with flat batteries, with out any help one or two more runs Moe has it in the bag, he has so much power to spare... but dialed in thane bushings would add to what he is doing.

Oh hey builders, Riptide makes some rad footstops too that the downhill world really loves. I was weary of them thinking I was going to trip over it when stepping off or it was going to get in the way but honestly, it's perfect. Like a nice comprise between a full set of big foot straps and a naked deck. You can position it right where your most comfortable stance is and never look down again to find it. I can slide my foot up to it and I know right where I am on my giant 42 inch deck..in the same spirit I went out and bought a rear-view mirror for my helmet so now I don't have to look down, or backwards...lol And my daughter says I ride like I have eyes on the back of my head now, lol...

It's super low profile, non-obtrusive and does what you think it does...I was very skeptical but I'm sold on the idea..

oh man, if you guys are thinking of doing risers, a set of nice wedges in a shock absorbing Sorbothane or something would be sick!! like 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 degrees..like in a little angle tuning kit like Kiro has but a full riser like that above ^
```

## \#38 Posted by: Alphamail Posted at: 2017-12-23T17:46:14.253Z Reads: 334

```
Angled risers are not the best way to wedge or de-wedge since as the angle increases, the fastener spacing diminishes and the fasteners are left to deal with an abnormal clamping angle.  It is better to choose trucks with adjustable base plate angles like Don't Trip trucks: [https://www.dtskate.com/SearchResults.asp?Cat=1963](https://www.dtskate.com/SearchResults.asp?Cat=1963)

As for asking a riser pad to act as a shock absorber, you end up with a riser pad that does not do either function you are asking it to do very well.  As a mount, it is loose and flexible so it is not a good mount and as a shock absorber, it is limited in it ability to do so since it needs to keep the truck stable and transfer the angular turning input from the deck so it squishes when you turn and your mounting hardware is now tight in one side and loose on the other.  Shock and vibration should be addressed elsewhere, not the truck mount.

Pretty much, the lighting channel doesn't need to be that wide, and for the main in/out channel I'm guessing it needs to be a bit wider to accommodate wires from 2 motors, as well as round off the corner the wires bend around for easier routing

Other than that, where do I order and how 😂

If it's translucent, it can't hurt to add two 3mm holes somewhere so an LED could be stuck in it to light up the riser, if one so desired.  Just for bling.

@Alphamail While we're on the subject of risers and wedges, how about making an extra wide 15° wedge that would allow the use of MBS and Trampa channel trucks on mountain boards that only have 20° angled tip and tail? I have a couple older mountain board decks that I would like to use with channel trucks, but the 20° mounting angles were based on using skate type trucks, and with channel trucks, it steers like a semi truck and the turning radius is ridiculous. 

Also, I don't know if it's feasible, but it would be cool if you could also make some affordable 35° wedges for using channel trucks on regular skate decks, e.g., the Jet Spud on MTB trucks & wheels.

On the whole riser thing.... I'd love to see a soft, high-rebound urethane spacer that actually compresses a significant amount when you hit a bump. For many, it's not that extra bit of vibration-dampening is not that big of a deal, but it's significant for super stiff Carbon Fiber decks like the one I'm using for my own products.

While the thought of that is nice, the issues @Alphamail pointed out earlier are real. Personally having tried softer risers to get some more dampening on my all cf build resulted in a ton of movement of the deck/baseplate along the bolts while turning, could hear it scraping up and down on the bolt threads.
Insoles/deck padding have been the best solution I've found. 

Maybe some soft duro footpads to stand on?

Looks cool dude, but I think I can see ways we can optimize it for motor wire flow/guidance. I'll sketch something up 2d tomorrow. If you imagine the motors do not sit at 90 degrees to the two lateral channels. But are mounted behind the riser pad to each side, so ideally to minimize pressure on the motor wires they need to be directed diagonally behind the riser pad not to the side. 
You could take some meat out of the current drawing and add some in other areas to give support and reduce the flex angle of the motor wires.

@Alphamail another idea that I think is worth kicking around, but will require more development is a slide glove puck that contained a internal mount for a eSk8 remote.
It could be proprietary or even be a mod of a existing popular controller...

I'll agree

[quote="Deckoz, post:17, topic:39913"]
I like thumb remotes, just there's none that just clip onto the side of a puck, or have most of the electronics in a  thin circular enclosure with Velcro on both sides to sandwich as a puck/remote shim between glove and slide puck. 

Having both hands available  would be better....

WoW, that is selfish!!! :)  Custom color runs are very expensive since it is difficult to get the color right the first time.  The urethane natural color is a bit of an off white depending on the duro and formulation so you need to compensate for that influence plus you need to pour 19 pairs at a time on our smallest Barrel mold and 24 pairs on the Cone mold.  We are talking hundreds of dollars to do something like that.  Happy to do it but it will be charged as time and materials.

OK, here is where @scepterr and I are at currently with what we are calling the Tunnel Riser.  We are open to alternate names and we would like to gauge interest on the numbers we should make as well as colors.  The material will be the same 60d translucent urethane that we use for our PSD FootStops that has a well documented and proven track record in durability!  The riser takes about the same amount of material as the FootStops which retail for $20.00 each but we will likely offer them here for less at least initially.  Please let us know your thoughts!

You could use the same in front even without motors up there, you can use the channels for routing lighting wires as well 

@Alphamail will have to confirm but I can't imagine it's any cheaper making an additional solid one, if anything would keep prices up for both

Running two of the same would be the best.  A solid one would be more expensive to pour as well as make the extreme high res 3d plugs we use (see picture).  Quantity will definitely bring the cost down because with a short run product, you need to amortize the multiple 3d's (6 of them to maximize our mold base dimensions), the tooling compound (this adds up to around $1,000.00 for the first mold) to make the mold and the cost of running 6 parts per lot and oven curing them for 16 hours.  The higher commitment here, the cheaper the parts can be!

Update on the Tunnel Riser project.  We plan on printing 6 male models to make the mold from and the quality we are looking for is described here:  https://www.shapeways.com/materials/frosted-detail-plastic  
The cost to do this is $45.00 each X 6 = $270.00.  Does anyone here have access to this quality at a lower price?  Here is a shot of the plate we mount the parts to then 4 walls and we pour the tooling compound over it to make the female mold to make the parts.

I am interested in what they are for?  From what I am looking at, they plug the hanger space and fill the primary bushing seat so another bushing will not sit where it should.  I imagine you use a shorter bushing roadside like a flipped StreetFatCone or StreetChubby to fit the secondary seat to compensate for the the reduced clearance?  What is the benefit?

I chop my baseplates to accommodate the plug. The plug basically does the same job as your APS insert bushings. The 'disk' for my DIYot plugs are thick in order to raise the bushing out of the seat, basically creating a seatless boardside bushing seat which enables massive amounts of lean. Obviously, like an insert bushing, the DIYot plug makes these trucks turn extremely precise and near impervious to torque steer.

The end result is akin to what a Ronin would feel like if it was rakeless.

SK8 Tunnel Riser

OK, here is where we are at and sorry for the delay but we have been burned on a couple of skate and nonskate related projects lately where we spent the $ for tooling and prototyping only to have the customer bail and go to China because they saved a few pennies.  Needless to say we are a little shy to do it again so here is what I propose.  If you want some of the Tunnel Riser, you will need to put your $ into an escrow account with us at RipTide.  Once the countdown starts, you will have two weeks to commit and if we have enough orders for the costs to make molds we will commit and fulfill the orders.  If we do not, we will return your $.  If these become a product, they will retail at $20.00 each, for you guys here, this offer is for $15.00 each so pony up and let's see if we can make this a reality.  If the presale is successful expect finished units at your doors 2 to 4 weeks after the close.  All you need to go is go to our website and purchase a gift certificate for $15.00 x the # you want.  We will deal with shipping charges and tax at completion if we go forward.  We have not been happy with the 3d print versions we have seen and been quoted so we will likely have them machined out of aluminum.

Please let me know if you are OK with doing it this way.

That sounds do-able. Would either you mind (or I could) create a Separate topic for these for the sake of awareness and organization. 

Also are these wire channels in the sense that you wire your motor wires through them like this:

Me too but don't let that slow you down, the tunnel reiser is merely a riser that goes between the truck and deck with room to route wires underneath, and from the picture you posted, you have something very similar.

It has room to route wires to 2 motors and one light/powerswitch/batt_gauge.  You may or may not use all of those.  You could just wire one motor with it.

@Sender, @itsmedant, @Jc06505n  

Tunnel Riser Project

Everything is set up to do this, let me know if you have any questions.  Just go to:

[http://www.riptidesports.com/giftcertificates.php](http://www.riptidesports.com/giftcertificates.php) 

Purchase a gift certificate for the # you want X $15.00 each and leave a note that the $ is for the Tunnel Risers with your shipping address and the desired color using the FootStop colors as your guide.  If the project is launched after 2 weeks, you will be invoiced for shipping (and tax if you are a CA resident) when the parts are ready to ship.  Thank you for your understanding for us doing it this way but we are a bit risk averse due to recent events!

@Alphamail I'm pumped for this! I was wondering if i could at the time of shipping have other products added to the order. I live in Canada and shipping here is a real bitch kitty. I have high levels of want for a few sets of pivot cups and bushings (there will be questioned on the other thread) on top of these risers. How would i organize that to have it work and become an awesome reality?

We have made wheels but the urethanes we use make the wheels prohibitively expensive since they require about 1 kg of the very expensive urethane that we use plus we hand batch and pour everything we make.  Until we figure something else out (which we are working on) wheels are a great way to lose $ and urethane has a lot of shortcomings and is barely suitable for eSk8 applications when you get down to it.

1. Angled risers. Or angled risers with wire channels. 5deg and then maybe a 2.5deg that could be stacked. 
Many users here use angled risers for a non symmetrical setup or just for tuning. I would have jumped on the last one if they there was an angled version. 

2. Riser with integrated area to add LEDs for brake lights head lights or decoration. 

3. XT90s screw down plug holder. Extra points if LEDs can be added by the user. Like these 
![image|670x449](upload://6aUHeOAj72GsDpd62gX6onpLCta.jpg)

4. GT2B remote case. This would be indestructible! No one will agree on a design though so maybe this is just a dream. If you need a 3D CAD guy I could do that.

One of my most difficult hurdles with this deck. The enclosure needs to conform around this recessed underbelly and I wont drill holes on the 1 kg super light 44" carbon deck. So, double challenge. I think I got a good idea on the last week a with be a conventional one. Still is going to be a conformal enclosure 100% covered all over.

So then it looks like @bigben's as it should ;) 

Great idea. My current enclosure is a muuuuuuch nicer fit. Officially done clogging this thread.

@Alphamail, there is lack of enclosure risers and sink risers for battery and electronics convertion on major board brands. One example will be Evolve's Carbon GT & Bamboo GT series boards. 

There is a huge need to modify both enclosure types. Eliminating a divider inside the CGT to acomodate the largest possible cell battery (10s5p) the entire lenght of the board and lowering down BMS and VESCs via a 3D printed Sink Riser which is difficult to get. 

For the BGT there is a need to elevate the original enclosure height because it lays too flat against the Bamboo series underbelly due to the stock slim Li-po battery; again, in order to acomodate a larger (and taller) Li-ion cell battery the entire enclosure lenght, a 3D printed riser enclosure is require (between 10mm to 18mm depending on the cell diameter) as well as a heat sink riser to lower BMS and VESCs (could go as much as 22mm thick) and also need to consider the square opening to sit the heat sink.

I printed this 10mm enclosure riser for my Bamboo series, found in Thingiverse, but I'll probably require a thicker one if this comes too short for my need... :point_down:

We are geared to make small parts and the footprint of a enclosure riser would make processing very inefficient and so prohibitively expensive.  If someone out there wanted to make these, I would suggest making a series of female molds, lay them out on a flat table and pour a RTV (room temp vulcanizing) resin into them and have at it.

No, that riser there is made up of 8 different segments the lenght of a pen each. They were lined up for the pic. The riser is not one piece!

If modular worked, you could just use standoffs!  :)

Not to get off topic but I know you have done the tunnel risers but what about just a simple riser that would dampen more vibration more than the rubber shock pads. I feel like a soft 60a duro or something would make a nice comfortable ride.

There are several reasons we do not make a cushioning riser but primarily you are asking it to do two thing that work counter to each other, kind of like our two party political system...it ends up not working very well for either task you are asking it to do.  If the riser is stiff and bolted rigidly to the deck, it holds the truck well and transfers the rider input through the deck, the riser and into the truck so the setup turns predictably and is repeatable allowing your muscle memory to form and your skills to advance.  If the riser is soft, there is a superficially low limit to what you can tighten your fasteners to otherwise you take all the compression out of the soft riser and you are back to a rigid mounting.  So with the arbitrarily loose mounting hardware, with you skating in a straight line, the soft riser is allowed to absorb vibration and fulfill its purpose.  When you decide it is time to turn, the 4 bolts on the outside of the turn increase in tension and the 4 bolts on the inside of the turn go slack.  Not only is the soft riser absorbing vibration, it is also absorbing your steering input forcing you to compensate and turn harder than you would with a rigid mount.  Personally I do not like the feeling and I find that fasteners end up failing sooner and also abrade the deck and trucks with almost a file effect going back and forth in the mounting holes.  I think a far more effective way is to pad the deck or use pneumatics if you are looking for a plush, carefree ride

I tried soft risers for vibration dampening but found the handling unpredictable compared to solid. And not stable at high speed. 

Better off with big soft wheels.

I made some "dampeners" for evolve trucks some time ago. It stiffens the boardside kingping a little and also provides some very minimal shock absorption so your nuts don't dig into the underside of the deck. All the guys I gave some to, said it was night and day difference in the added stability against speed wobbles without noticeably losing carving ability. What do you guys think? @Alphamail

Thanks!! 

I'm Tom, unfortunately Jake left the operation. 

$25 with longer hardware and shipping included 
$20 no hardware shipping included 

Im hoping to bring prices down by moving away from 3d printing. We'll see what AlphaMail has to say about it.

It Provides the swing arm or what ever for the dkp to travel smoothly across its range while turning and carving. It's almost like force feedback. Results in a more predictable motion. All the magic comes from these areas here.![20190510_163931|581x500](upload://jYL55qLNymGldy4dfxgFD38UMwL.jpeg) 

It also give the bolts another surface to dig into instead of your deck and slightly reduces vibrations. I think with a real chemical compound the effects could be much better.

It needs some small refinements but overall it exceeded my expectations.
