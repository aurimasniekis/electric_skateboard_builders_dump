Someone followed me yesterday on instagram and noticed they had some really nice products going, wheels made by same factory as kegels boa and so on as well.


Maybe the new Carvon killer? 

Company is called swissboards.ch

Hey guys, 

Thanks for helping me start my morning) you gave me a good laugh! No one is scaring me, I'm currently riding 1 of our prototypes, getting some testing miles on it, and I'm not the best at multi tasking.

[quote="Lumaci, post:12, topic:71614"]
i just checked the people he follow 70% of them are here on forum
[/quote]

The Instagram is very new, and I just gave a hint to my team to follow some people from the forum, didn't mean for them to follow 70% of you, sorry for that)

SwissBoards is my company, based in Switzerland, and we have quite a few products planned out for this year. The board you saw, is the first complete we'll have on offer. It's an integrated, all maple and fiberglass, deck, housing a 10s4p made with VTC6 cells, and 4 direct drive motors, all made by us, in Switzerland. 

The remote is nowhere close to generic Chinese remotes, here is a rendering from a long time ago if you're interested:

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/no-words-just-pictures-delete-words-use-pm/2992/5490?u=boostedbuilder

We had a lot of changes done to it, and will be sharing progress on that Instagram page. We are still a little far off from the finished product, but when we are done, it will be quite a board.

This is definitely not as much as you expected me to write, but I also didn't expect this thread! And I'm going up a 20% hill at 27mph now, so I kinda have eyes full of tears and I can't see the phone screen to well.

Anyways, if you have any particular questions, let me know. I can't promise to answer everything, but I'll do my best to both keep you intrigued and well informed.

[/quote]

Currently, axles are 11mm stepped down to 7.92mm, milled from 17-4 PH steel which is pretty much the hardest steel out there. We have 2 lengths, 250mm and 290mm for 2 different motor sizes. 5565 and 5575 motors.

Production axles will be 11.6mm stepped down to 8mm, same material, and will only be made in 260mm width for 5565 motors.

Motors can output up to 3000W of continuous power, however our connectors limit it to 1375W, so these motors might not be very interesting to builders, unless you put your own connectors, which won't be very easy. Approximately 75kv, silver wire windings, ceramic bearings, IP66... and more to come.

We are working on some AT cores similar to the Kegel, which we'll fit the drives.

Well with 7" wheels, 12s and 75kv its like 100km/h and like 1/3 of the torque is left compared to urethane wheels so I don't think its really worth it :D

@pat.speed, Haven't tried it because I haven't been able to get some purpose built samples for a decent price

I am designing a circuit to handle the switching tho, the relay can be emulated with smaller components and Im shooting to make it handle 100A (a bit over kill but until I can test the circuit is rather be over than blow good components)

Congrats man! and super nice choice to go with a pre-built board. Except Raptor 2 there are no competitors in the premium pre-built DD boards. You board looks really slick. 90% of the customers want to ride a board and not build it, unfortunately! Please share more tests and video about it.
One question how did you hold in place the hanger in the truck? glue? grub screws?
Well done!

Not sure if I like that answer. Means you did not focus on the road 100% at that speed and other people could have gotten hurt. Don't care if it's maybe a remote location - you never know. It shines a potentially bad light on esk8ers when people are reckless like that and accidents happen.

Not that @BoostedBuilder needs to defended by me but come on, it was clear to me that he just wants to show off a bit of excitement for the performance of his new born baby! He lives in Switzerland where esk8 is not allowed, I am pretty sure he won't do something stupid to call him all the attention :policeman:. That also probably why he went for a super stealth look for his board :wink:
I agree that we have to be all responsible while riding, but in this case I think you took him to seriously.
@BoostedBuilder I would like to see a video of that hill climbing BTW :grin: You should test your board on the now famous steep hill that FabTRAV uses in his reviews (I am joking, but it would be fun).

Silver windings?!  U jest.

Ceramic bearings are pennies compared to silver windings.  No one does that. Maybe it‚Äôs for the super upgrade price.  In my looking enameled silver wire is insanely expensive w little benefit.

It did bring the price up quite a lot, but our motors are smaller than 63mm yet we are able to achieve very similar performance.

Our board will still be cheaper than an Evolve for example.

Since this is for normal consumers not real diyers like us bullets would scream unfinished product and "diy".

These wires makes it look finished, and way more easy to install and uninstall since it cant go in wrong so its better for a final product for consumers that wants a quality feeling product ![image|500x500](upload://jnW0AYsmejOseMBFIbtNWNqws0Q.jpeg)

@12meterkuk  we are working on a matte black 195mm version which will perfectly match the back truck.

@Hummie we purchased pure silver wires, however, we never actually sent them for any tests to prove they are pure silver. We only intend to use pure silver, so we will continue searching for suppliers, until we find pure. To answer your other questions: 96C / China

@b264 yes, that's our intention. We have sent a sample of the wire to a lab to test for pureness. We use curved N48SH magnets, currently searching for N52SH which are incredibly hard to find. Axles are milled and heat treated.

@BoostedBuilder really like the design with 50xx motors, for the larger one always look strange on the side of the wheel

About the magnets, be careful with N52 about the temperatures, even the SH, they can operate a way lower temperature than the 48SH for the same geometry 

Maximum operating temperature is not only a function of grade, the form of the magnet play a large role in determining how hot can you take them without permanent loses

Hi Michael,

Not really, no. As I've told @iTzDiego , time is flying crazy quick but things are not moving very quick. We just switched our manufacturers for multiple reasons so there will be more testing, and it will most likely be mid to late January that we will offer the drives for sale, and the complete boards closer to mid-March.

We would like our products to be the absolute best they can before they get delivered to our customers, so I prefer delaying things, and get things perfect the first time.

I wonder if some "DIYer version" could be cheaply done with bullet connectors or MT30 to unleash the full power for the ones amongst us who are a little nuts. Probably not financially viable though, if it's anything like the smaller motors i was working on getting made, any tiny changes between skews jacks the price up significantly

The silver wire likely gets good quantity discount for enough for 500 motors vs a pair. A couple of us checked on the pricing and we were looking at about $100 for silver, I‚Äôm sure that price was top dollar but did not even include enameling, bulk who knows maybe $25 a side enameled otherwise too costly

@McErono thanks for the offer) I might reach out soon!

@banjaxxed Well, silver simply is a more conductive metal than copper meaning that it can either transfer more electricity while staying at the same temperature or transfer an equal amount of electricity while loosing less energy through heat, making it more efficient and this efficiency allows for a cooler running motor. 

@Livid I'm thinking of the best way to do that for the guys on this forum. I'm sure we'll come up with something.

@banjaxxed yeah, bulk pricing for silver enameled wire is definitely better. Currently it costs us about $47 per motor.

What is the awg rating of the 3 phase wires inside the sleeve? Are they also only rated for 1300w or such?

Wondering is a DIY user need to also cut the wire back to the motor and solder on some 12awg? Or maybe it's silver all the way to the connector

The sensor connectors could be continue to live where they are, just reseal and use the female connector part which hopefully comes with DIY package.

One other Question, sorry if I missed. What are the wheel specs size-wise

Nice

Yeah, the Higo connector (phase wire wise) is rated to 52V and 25a and you can go a little bit above that.

I'm thinking of making a DIY version with 14AWG wires and a Higo connector for sensors, because you won't be able to modify the main version of the motor. I just don't think there will be much interest in these within the DIY community since everyone here wants BIG and POWERFULL where as these were designed with portability in mind. Anyways, I'll see... 

What do you mean by wheel specs? Of the production board? 100mm and you can choose other sizes for the direct drive motors if you want them separately : )

You can't imagine how perfect this represents us : (

It's quite ridiculous but I have to say that we are just not ready. Although the website is done and actually turned out way better than I was hoping, I don't want it to just say out of stock or pre-order for the board and drives.

We'll swap the countdown for an email subscription as it's quite obvious now that we aren't capable of correctly estimating the time required. Exactly the reason why I didn't want to start a thread about this.

On the good note, the drives are turning out to be incredible little beasts, and I truly think you'll all love them! Just not tomorrow)

No, not anymore. Silver turned out to be much softer than copper and after winding multiple stators, the wire would either crack or break entirely on some of the bends. 1 out of every 5 motors had a broken wire which got really expensive so we ditched the idea.

Yes and no. You could push an equal amount of current into silver and copper, silver just wouldn't get as hot. 
We were able to achieve a very efficient overall motor design, and we can fit just a little less copper than a 63mm motor. So if you stay under 30 continuous amps, efficiency shouldn't be problem.

@BoostedBuilder What's the max speed on those? how silent are they? stability on high speeds?  
let's say it different: possible to come by and test them?

Ahmyo Akasha wheels will come as standard, larger wheels will have a higher price (for example, kegels +$10). The wheel choice will be from what we have in stock and we don't have TB wheels. If there is interest for Europeans, I'll place an order.

Max speed literally? I'd say somewhere around 50mph at 13s, in 4WD and with 110mm wheels but never tested. Pleasantly silent in FOC. I'm not sure how motors affect stability so I don't know how to answer your question.
Sure, when we're done, you can come by and test them)

32mph and trucks feel great) 35+mph should totally be fine but I really wouldn't advise anyone to go that fast.

The fine is in the region of 500CHF in Zurich.
No, we'll only sell the drivetrain separately, and only for a limited time before we start selling the complete board.
