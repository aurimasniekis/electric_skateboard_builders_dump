You spoke and we listened! The FreeRide hollow core deck is now better than ever! Our new construction methods have produced a deck with a lower overall ride height and weight. 

Topside the deck features a micro drop paired with a flat bottom V concave for a comfortable locked in foot placement. The top hatch is constructed from 6061 T6 aluminum and fastened with M3 torx machine screws and threaded inserts bedded with epoxy.

Roadside is where we made the most changes to our FreeRide design. Board thickness has been reduced on the nose and tail which has dropped the ride height and increased stability by lowering the center of gravity. The thinner nose and tail sections have also improved ride quality by providing the perfect amount of flex without losing the torsional stiffness of the original FreeRide. The bottom layer contains several layers of glass fiber reinforcement and finished with a triaxial weave for extreme strength and durability.

The Ollin FreeRide Re-Curve deck  is now available to builders and enthusiast alike! Retro fit the deck with electronics, batteries, trucks, wheels and drive train of your choice.  

Order now and s ave $50 off the regular retail price of $298.95!!!

Looks great! Do you have photos from other angles? Top view? with the lid as well? Does the lid provide reliable water resistance?
Whats the biggest wheels you can put on there? :smile:

Edit:
Also do you have a close up for the underside? Can't tell how the wire channels leading into the core are oriented

Edit**:
How long do we have for the $50 off sale price?

Any dimension of the internals? I see it fits 60 cells but is that with or without controllers? 

A bit more info and I’m in @OllinBoardCompany
How long until we can expect delivery ?

the Ollin complete ships with a "756 watt-hour 18650, 12s5p battery pack capable of 100+ amps", with dual Ollin ESCs (the slimmer ones)

The dimensions appear absolutely ideal; will post pics once it arrives.

The two side channels inside the deck each measure 70mm wide by 622mm long and 22mm deep. These dimensions easily fit 30 18650 cells in each channel leaving enough room on each end for the battery cables and balance wires to be routed through the access holes in the structural beams of the board which are located on both ends. The center channel measures 58mm at the widest points and 53.5mm at the narrowest point. It has a slight hourglass shape. At each end of the center channel you will find tunnels for routing motor wires to the truck mounting locations.

@Wraith you can run our 90mm Popocas on 1/4" risers with zero wheel bite. You can also use 107mm wheels but you will need 3/4" risers if you don't want wheel bite. Wheels like the kegel shouldn't need any riser at all.  

If you use a thin coating of silicone when you secure your lid, it should be fairly water resistant. It will really depend on what power switch you use, where you drill your holes, what power ports you use...but yes, the board can be pretty water resistant.

@barajabali we already have a few orders in. Those who have already ordered can expect their boards to arrive after next week.   

The inner compartments are almost identical to the original FreeRide deck. The outer two channels are for the batteries and the center channel is for VESCs and other electronics. If you are using a wide motor controller like the FOC box, you will need to sacrifice some of the space in the battery compartments for the motor controllers. This board is designed specifically for our motor controller or the original version 4.12 VESC. 

@Eboostin we have phased out the pop up hatch however we do have a new switch mechanism that will be available soon. It is a component that can be added later to our deck or any other DIY build. 

Here are a few  more photos of the Re-Curve. We will be uploading more detailed photos very soon.

This could be the only longboard I might be interested in.  Everything else will be shortboards or bust.

@OllinBoardCompany are there any hatches or openings on top, or are they ALL on the underside of the deck?

They're all on the top, my friend.

Believe it or not, this is Ollin's last-gen deck; note the center channel size for ESCs:

![IMG_20160314_091900|506x500](upload://sW4kI32PRJubNCM3eTq5OFhG17G.jpeg)

As the Ollin is a F/R setup, the routing for the cables is the same on both sides.

This opens up the possibility for builds like, an AWD Carvon build on ABEC 90 ReFlys that would boast perfect 50/50 weight distribution in a solid, vibration-dampening integrated platform.

Yeah that's the problem.  Water travels downhill, so if it gets in there, it doesn't get out.

@scrapheap and @barajabali 

Technically there is enough depth to fit 20700 cells.The cells would need to be fitted length wise in groups of three but it would leave very little room for the neoprene rubber strips we use for padding in our builds. It would probably work if you only welded strips to the ends of the batteries and did not use the bus-bars you see in our builds.

> 20700 are the future imo 

@chaka aka Jeramiah feels the same way but 18650 are still basically the commodity cell of choice around the world and the most cost effective.

@Colson003
> there isn’t a hatch on top. It sounds like the whole top layer bolts on.

If you look closely at the photo @topcloud posted we actually create a recess for the aluminum top hatch. The remaining top area of the board is a composite skin that is bonded to the core. Once grip tape is applied, there is no visible seam. 

@b264 we have been riding this style of deck for several years.  If care is taken during the build to seal the motor wire tunnels with silicone, riding through puddles will not be a problem at all. We have found that using grip tape alone to cover the seam the top hatch creates, is all you need for riding in wet conditions, wet roads, puddles, etc.  If you are dead set on riding in a down pour, you would want to use a quality silicone sealant around the edge of the hatch because some brands of grip tape actually have tiny holes for air to escape.The tiny holes help remove air bubbles from under the grip tape.

That doesn't solve the problem.  To be reliable, I try to make boards "water-resistant" AND "waterproof" which means that water shouldn't get in -- that part you got -- but *if it does* then it won't hurt anything.  Having a way to run back out through the broken seal means the lid has to be on the bottom due to the mechanics of gravity.  That's how you build things that survive daily abuse as a commuting tool.

I know nobody is going to listen, but I have to put it out there.

The lids *have to be* on the bottom.  Same mistake the Hyperbeast deck has and the Carbon GT deck.

Because in the end, I'm not in control of whether it starts raining or snowing while I'm at work or grocery shopping or wherever.  Or if someone is washing their car or a sprinkler system has water all over the street.

@b264 we could argue till the end of time on this subject. The truth remains that if you plan on riding in the rain and properly seal this board you shouldn't have any trouble with water intrusion. The beauty of it is that this a deck for the DIYer.  The builder can create and customize it to work for their needs. No worries man if this board is not for you. 

@mikenyc the borad in the picture is the new board. We will have additional pictures soon with the hatch on. The top of the board will look very similar to the original FreeRide. The main difference is we use torx machine screws instead of Philips head wood screws to secure the top hatch.

Also, was there anyone in the hyperbeast buy that had water ingress issues?

I'm sort of in the same boat as you are, but for a different reason. I've been thinking of making my own integrated deck that opens from the bottom, because trying to do maintenance and checks on a board with the lid on the top and covered with griptape just screams PITA to me. And if going for the more stealth look, a board with screws showing on the top and the griptape obviously cut to give easy access to the lid will ruin it.
 
Bleh...and not really being able to comfortably accommodate 20700's is a bit of a deal breaker for me. I might get one anyway though and see if it's possible to do a little routing on the channels. Or let Bara try to see what can be done first :stuck_out_tongue:!

@barajabali  the deck does not come with the switch or the charge port. The deck at the listed price will need holes drilled for the charge port and switch of your choosing, very similar to what you would do with an ABS enclosure.  In the near future, we will offer these as add on features. We should have photos of the aluminum top hatch up really soon. It looks almost identical to the original FreeRide minus the magnetic flip hatch.   It is one solid piece with countersunk holes for the Torx screws. 

I do have pictures of the optional charge port that we will have listen soon as an add on.

@barajabali  Thanks, we are really pleased with the charge port as well. @b264 is close, it's actually a 4 pin aviation connector. Each pair of pins are good up to 5 amps so you could use up to a 10 amp charger with this connector.  The connector comes with a custom circuit board too.

If you want water to drain out the bottom. Drill some small drainage holes in the bottom. 

Is that not what your saying, a bottom opening board would be a bit leaky to allow water to get out on its own?

If you must cover them with small round stickers if you want water to not go in there and then open to let the water drain out after a ride.

I'm a rain rider too, I'm hesitant to use a fully bolted down enclosure I can't see into or open quickly. There is no way to know if water is in there or not after a wet ride without taking all the bolts off.

I had this grand idea to G-Bomb the Ollin, dial-in the angles of a dual 6380 FatBoy 230mm drivetrain & AT precision wheels so it could go long-range.

...but that's what I bought the LaCroix for, and it's still on the bench, waiting on me.

Sorry for the lack of posting lately, we have been busy getting ready for the Renegade Vegas weekend.  Spent the night at Show Low, AZ and will arrive in Vegas later today.

Decks are almost complete. The aluminum top hatches are being machine cut this week. There was a little delay in production because we decided to go with a larger diameter insert for the top hatch to give the epoxy bond more surface area. Once we return, later next week, decks will begin to ship out.

Hey everyone, a little update on where we are with the Re-Curve. Cores are complete, skins are pressed. We didn't want to finish all the machining until we were sure about the reliability of the threaded inserts.  This turned out to be good because we ended up needing a larger size which are holding up very well. We made a quick listing for the charge port add on if anyone is interested. We will be contacting everyone before we send their board to ask if they want this add on option along with the new anti-spark switch (which I have on my personal board and love :heartpulse:) Please know that if you opt out of the add-on options you will need to drill your own holes.

@Sender is correct but keep in mind to do this you must use an original 4.12 VESC or our modifier version with direct FETs.  The 60 cells completely fill the two outer channels as shown in this photo we posted earlier.

The board doesn't need to withstand hours and hours in a high pressure shower or being submerged in a puddle, it just needs to get you home without damage if you get caught in the rain.

Honestly riding the the rain is suicide on urethane anyway. I have never once fallen on dry roads, but I've received a significant amount of wet concrete kisses against my poor knees and elbows. :confounded:

I mean, I am definitely not the person to answer this, but I am sure you could figure out something with the right amount of..... drive?

But, why not just make it an 18650 build as intended?

 Whenever there is a cell that is more widely adopted in our community that is both economically and pratically available, I have no doubt @chaka will be ready and willing to jump on the bandwagon and have a bad ass deck design catered to it.

@uigiroux the only modifications we are making to the decks are the addition of the anti-spark switch and charge port on the rail of the board.  In order to modify the board to fit the larger batteries it would take a complete redesign. This will not be the last deck we design and will take into consideration the larger batteries in the future.

I think once I get my HAYA in I'm gonna have to make a tough decision over which to go with.  Damn I love this design :heart_eyes:   As for whether to eat cell space or use the older vesc design I already purchased dual ESCape's.  I have a dual enclosure as well as two single enclosures for them so I'd likely just use those.   That'd still be enough room for a 12s4p or 10s5p wouldn't it?

Is there any more from this batch left?

@uigiroux Our first batch sold pretty quick and we do not have any left. If you are interested in the second batch, please allow us some time to focus on those whom have already ordered before we can give you an expected time frame on the second production batch.

We are running behind and do apologize immensely. We ran out of epoxy and had to order more…which took a week to get here. We then had an employee out for awhile which slowed us down as well. I would also like to announce that we made the hard decision to no longer sell complete ready to ride boards. This will allow us to put all our energy into making decks and manufacturing parts for builders. Because of this we will soon offer battery options and other included components with our decks to accommodate new builders or riders that want something that they can just bolt on their drive train of choice.

Not really, the veneer is mainly aesthetic. The bottom of the deck is composed of many layers of glass fiber composite. It is amazingly durable! Much stronger than an ABS enclosure and harder than bare maple.

Most people think I simply route out a deck and slap an aluminum sheet over the top but there is much more to it than that.

@sender I have been working more on that idea you and I talked about on stacking 2 of our Direct VESC's. Looks like its a go! This is a crude mock up, used some fasteners we had on hand but it should work. 2x VESC with the same footprint as one VESC and still fit inside the Re-Curve! :metal:

In my experience we do not need heat sinks in a dual configuration so in a quad it shouldn't be a problem at all. Will need to use some 90 deg jst ports and possible wire in an extended jst for bt and sensors.

I mean, running 12s5p 30q, I would set 25 bat max per vesc.  That is pretty low demand.  You spread the load, makes everybody have to work less and still get tons of power increase.

If @chaka thinks heat sinks aren't necessary in this application, I trust him.  I think it makes sense.

It will be fun to run telemetry to see the numbers!

> 3 piece heatsink? Middle heatsink can have the proper standoffs.

We will see, I have actually used this model without heatsinks in a dual configuration and didn't get any thermal throttling with factory settings. When I have more time I will start modeling some ultra low profile heatsinks since having some thermal mass is a good thing for the long term health of the direct FETs.

I’m reasonable, I get that delays happen but because this is a community there should be a personal touch. It would be great to let customers know if delays happen and a new ETA, proactively. Taking money and not replying is not ideal whether you’re a massive company or the mom & pop shop down the street.

You must be new here.

[quote="treenutter, post:1, topic:20290"]
Many of the threads on the forum take an immediate nosedive when someone starts complaining repeatedly about a vendor transaction. Here are some examples of things to DM your vendor about, instead of creating a topic about it:

* Waiting for a part and annoyed that it hasn’t arrived
* Vendor didn’t respond fast enough to your text/email/phone call/smoke signal
* You want your money back
* You are angry about a transaction and you want to insult a vendor
[/quote]

That's great that you have an opinion on what you expect from a very small business, run by 2 people, aware that they are out on vacation. In my opinion you come across as pretty privileged and whiney. 

Not long ago everything took weeks, even months to receive on the internet.

One has a choice to purchase things wherever one likes these days. It's also entirely on the consumer to manage their own expectations when purchasing from small shops. There's not a lot of money to be made here, for almost all small vendors here this is a labor of love because they're passionate about it. 

Being able to purchase hand made, custom electric skateboard components from those that love this sport is a privilege to anyone who can't design and produce this stuff themselves.

You're taking this too far imo.

Eboosted has been very polite as has everyone else, because Ollin has been a very respected contributor.

But missing delivery dates by months with no updates... the customers deserve an update. If there's none to be had they should share information, hopefully in a polite manner.

I don't see any vendor bashing here.

@Eboostin, I sent you a PM with an update moments before we left for Barrett Junction knowing that it would be days before we got back.  I'm sorry you thought my response was "generic", next time I'll try and throw in some flare.  I did not respond to your last two PMs (which I will shortly) because we were at Barrett Junction...which you knew.  

When I came on the forums I let everyone know that I cannot be on here very often but that I would try my best to be on here as much as possible.  So if you PM me or tag me and I do not respond, it's because I'm not on here. If anyone wants to reach us and wants a response quickly then they need to contact us through proper channels, the best way is through an email from the contact page on our website or a phone call like we received from @Eboostin today. Sorry we missed your call @Eboostin, I heard your message and will be writing you soon.

@deucesdown, this is a completely false accusation.  I've PM everyone who has contacted me and even made a few updates on this very thread.  We have been away from home/ the shop for a good month, only stopping at home long enough to do laundry and repack the camper....so not as many updates.

As far as updates go:  We managed to ship a couple out prior to leaving for Barrett Junction. We are now back in the shop working hard. Jeramiah is finishing the lamination on the next few decks so more people should have them in their hands soon.

@OllinBoardCompany Thank you for the update on the boards! 

I didn't want to discuss details of specific orders in here but since it was brought up, by "generic" I meant that there was no info pertaining to my order. One of the PMs I sent was last Friday asking if mine was one of the ones that shipped pre-Barrett Jackson. The other was today when I hadn't heard back to the PM I sent last Friday. 

This wasn't meant to be accusatory at all so I apologize if it came across that way. I'm a big Ollin supporter (I have 10 of your VESCs (6 of which were purchased directly from you), a few antisparks and now this board order) so I was hoping for a bit more communication since we are now two months past the promised delivery date. 

I'll keep a look out for your PM, have a great weekend!

Definitely just build the hummie. My hummie build has been awesome. 12s destroys every single production board in every aspect and everyone that gets on it is impressed by the torque.

You kind-of remind me when people ask about building a computer. They always want the latest and greatest parts but there is always something better and something more powerful on its way. In the time you take waiting for the next best thing you could have been riding for a year and enjoying yourself! Get your board together and ride it IMHO. Work out if you want more torque or range/belts/DD and then adjust accordingly. :slight_smile:

There is no way to know what you need/want/like on an  esk8 unless you have some serious riding time.

@Friskies That's a perfect example of why I've dragged this out for so long, I get all OCD about wanting the best of each component and I just keep extending my build time...  Lol, I was thinking about getting a phone upgrade earlier today and decided I'll wait a month or so since there's a few phones coming out soon.  Luckily I still have my first hummie deck, along with the original NESE modules... I've been putting off building my battery for the same reason.
@taz I know I'm embarrassed I haven't finished one yet 😊. I'm gonna have it ready before winter ends though!
I am planning on getting a couple of the new Maytech 6880's though.  Still gonna keep my TB 6380's, but I feel compelled to over power it.

That's what I'm going to do.  Since I kept changing my mind about decks I haven't gotten around to making my battery yet since I wasn't sure about configuration.  You are right though, I am going to finish using the hummie deck.
I just need to get 50 30Q's, 2 motor pulleys with belts... oh and until I have the things to make my own enclosure I'll use one of bigbens. Lol, that's literally all I need.
So in addition to those things I'll be using:
Hummie deck, dual TB 6380's, TB 218 trucks, DieBieBMS, ESCape's, boa 100mm wheels, push to start from MartinSP, metr pro BT, NESE modules for 12s4p, and I ordered a firefly with display from @Zyb.
Then when I'm able to, I'm going to swap out the belt system for the 3 gear drive @moon and me are working on, the Re-Curve deck, Maytech 6880's, Hoyt remote, upgrade to surf rodz trucks.  Also I'll probably build another battery pack using the newer Samsung 30T or 40T.

Some of you know winter wreaked havoc on my epoxy layup method. We tried heating the press and it just caused some cosmetic blemishes in the cover weave of almost all of the first pressings. The material layup cost is huge on these boards so I will be spraying the blemished boards with a color coat, either white with a black logo or black with a silver logo. Other colors are definitely a possibility so please feel free to chime in here on this thread if any of you feel like having a deck with a solid color coat.

I am currently repressing skins and everything is going smoothly now that we are not fighting freezing temps so the wood grain option is still happening!

Look at you with the fancy drill bit, I remember those from my days building boats!

How does the epoxy hold up on aluminum? If it holds well a thinner sheet of aluminum could be used to keep the thickness in check.

@briman The bottom skin is primarily a composite structure, the wood veneer is in the center. The veneer is also very thin, about 1/42" in thickness.

Aw ok I wasn't sure if it was a composite as it has the look of wood and on the site it looks like it is just a different type of wood veneer. But yeah I would not be able to burn a design into the deck with out creating toxic fumes.  Thanks for clearing that up though :+1:

In a design without any compound curves I can mold a veneer onto the outside face of the bottom skin. The re-curve is nuts though, it has a pretty hefty compound curve where the deck goes from the truck mounts to the hollow core enclosure. 

Maybe you should come out to New Mexico and burn your artwork into the veneer before I work my black magic in the press. :metal:

This is what I am working on today, yesterday the two on the right received their fresh belly pans. If you look closely the one on the left is one of the blems, nothing major but definitely a no-go for a full wood grain finish.

The sunshine from the open door shows just how thin those veneers are!

I wish I could man that would be awesome.  Maybe some day. Or you could send a few pieces out to me to burn and then I could ship them back for you to press with your black magic.  Because if I came there I would end up finding out the magic and a good magician never reveals his secrets.

Purple and yellow is not a problem but the closest I can come to distressed paint stripper is this.

legends! RIP

@briman05 most of the people who come out here from the east coast never leave. Besides, would be happy to share what I have learned from my own trials. The only reason I can operate cnc or press decks is from knowledge others have shared so it is actually kind of a dick move if I don't share a little!

Yea very true. I’m going to pick up some reverse gx12 2pin for a mobile charger I’m working on.
As it stands now, people will plug the output right back in to itself or use their boards charger. Not good

For anybody with a haya deck. 
I chose to use the spare hole for the trucks for the charger pos and negative. It is fused to the same fuse as the 12v phone charger and also doubles as a voltage meter so I know what my battery is at. The connectors are 3.5 bullets btw.

This is very discerning. I've tried on several occasions to email him for updates. No responses. Its been 10 months since I ordered my board. This is my second time dealing with Ollin Boards. The first time didn't go very well also. Waited over 5 months for his Vesc.

I really like Jeremiah. The no contract, no updates isn't a great sign.  Hope he's doing alright but i also hope the members of our community who ordered from him get what they ordered or some kinda reimbursement if necessary.

Has anyone seen him like at all? His Instagram is gone and he hasn’t been on either forum in over a month. His website is still up but most things are listed as out of stock. He still has some smaller stuff in there in stock. Almost tempting to go and buy some spacers or something small/ cheap from him and see if he even is still there at all.

Damn, that sucks man. Glad someone finally got a response. FYI, I was told “soon” last December and Feb and March aaaaaand you see my point. 

This is one of the reasons I really respect what @bevilacqua has done. :fire: Each time he has done a run of boards, there are progress pics, updates and post purchase support.
