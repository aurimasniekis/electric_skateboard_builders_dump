I dont know, that looks like it could be pretty cool. Kinda bulky, maybe they can slim it down though.

What? I mean, I'm just speechless right now. The claims looks impressive though, I'm almost certain the range and speed is depended on rider and load of bag.

Please @Nate search and read before posting. Its impressive concept, but I dont think its a good eboard. And for sure its one hell heavy backpack to begin with.

ok cool, got it. 

I meant the idea sounds good on paper but its pretty silly come implementation phase. I just can't see people riding a half bag half e-skateboard to and from work. Looks kind of like a inverted centaur.

The concept is nice. But I cant imagine my self on it. It looks ridiculous lol.

You have a bag + longboard. The board could be easily carried and stowed in the bag. You can hop it at your back or drag it along like a suit case.

To be honest is better to invent a backpack that can do this instead of integrating it all at once.

Pretty sure with a heavy load in the pack. That board can easily tripped over to the sides. Also no lively feeling riding a longboard.
