Something tells me that bustin board isn’t backing this. I tried to get josh involved a year ago. He told me. We don’t see the need to invest in the esk8 industry. He would rather Fauster mom and pop shops in the community brick and mortar. 
My response was bring a lot of cash. 
So funny

based on those specs i'd call it at 10S3P. When they first started marketing, i thought it was a push assist because of the amount of "research" they led us to believe they did and all the talk about pushing and feeling natural, but then i realized quickly it was a throttle like ours on what seems to be a standard variant of generic hubs. I wonder what i would find in the ESC compartment if we cracked it open. Likely something familiar, but not from around here. 

I want to believe they did something cool with the urethane, or the feel of it, or something. It looks slick but also reeks of cheap electronics. Also, they won't send me one to test. 

bustin is one of my favorite deck companies. There's at least 3 of their decks in my shop in various states of use. 

Also, i'm not sure why they are acting like this is their first foray into esk8. I JUST saw an older evolve carton with their logo on it the other day.

I'm still wondering about that weird gap in the urethane. I have a feeling it was an afterthought for cooling? Kinda like how CarvOn made a new adapter that requires cutting off the urethane sleeve so the motor cools easier.

That’s the hubs teemgee is using, they didn’t develop it. The back hanger is also shit as the bushing seat is smaller than a barrel and will damage it over time. I’ve used it before.

Very close to the Acton s2 specs ..which is a 10s2p Samsung in my blink junk..not sure what cell tho..just says Samsung on it ..it's just a bit faster at 25 mph and the Acton s2 is about 20mph to 18mph after 50%of battery drained..I am light weight at 65kg tho..after seeing the specs what a sack

you need 7.5 Ah at 10S to get 15 miles credibly. They could be using a 30Q 10S2P and stretching it a bit for marketing, you'd have 6Ah there. or 9Ah in a 3P. but if its a 3P 25R pack, it would be right on the money.

That's more typical performance at fun speed. I was going slow, and was in a tuck. Because i was cold and trying to keep warm, it was too slow to make any aero difference.

I like bustin decks, they don't last me a very long time as typically pump (non-electric) and they tend to crack before long.  Maybe this resolves that issue, although its probably not an issue unless you pump hard and it has a lot of flex.

I guess Im wondering if this is a Bustin enterprise or not.  The board doesn't look bad, at least as good as a meepo or winboard, if the performance is that good...

So I hope you guys are wrong. Was gonna do my first DIY build converting my Bustin Sportster.... Then this thing came along. What sold me was the pushability. Are all hubdrives easy to push or are they onto something new? I should be receiving my board in February/March. Will post my experience here.

[/quote]


Fairly confident that it depends on a lot of things but you can make belt drives with a good amount of leway to push (or move the belt out of the pulley). 

It's just the board looks like nothing new, the remote looks like a rearranged crown wheel remote and the hubs don't seem to be different from anything we've seen before. You would think that Bustin would try to partner up with a company worthy of it's reputation but all they're doing (Duaomo) is acting Like hubs are doing something that other drive train (one in which can probably free roll better than hubs). 

It's even a bit funny since this board seems to **not** have a push assist feature, the one feature that would actually validate its marketing. It's push features is just relying on the better free rolling ability of _some_ hubs.

 If it's pushabiity that sold you, you coulda either built a gear drive board or wait on push assist implementation for the unity.

This, along with the hub motors points it to being the same manufacture as Crownwheel, a questionable company with questionable tactics.

Yeah, I cannot understand the system as well. In my opinion there is a much better and easier way to fix the stator to the trucks, but it seems like every company in china or elsewhere got big problems with that. Its kinda sad that I have to mention as a rookie who never builded an electric skateboard. Its a big mystery. On the other hand I think this could be a good product for this price if the thin urethane stays in place while riding it to its limits, but only time and some youtube reviews will tell.

I think wheel bite would occur if they put urethane there.  And the deck would then be too thin.  One way to fix that would be low angle baseplates, and then a special cut in what would now not be the most stressed area on the board but meh.  comment for sub cuz I got my eye on them offering all their shizzle for the cheapest ever.  Bustin is really dropping the drawers rn, for skateboards, just like the other big brands, but we'll see what happens for the price of this one.

Yeah you're right, they're the old Backfire design. Still get hot as shit which causes the urethane to warp/vibrate. Not half bad with the 97mm covers but that defeats the "hybrid" purpose of this board.

whats the "push" ability of these?  or the mellow hubs which also claim to be easy to push.  anyone ridden them? 


with the permanent magnets I cant see how you could get any easier push.  you either have enough magnet strength to allow less turns on the stator side and run cooler, and the stronger magnets producing a stonger magnetic field in the gap when unpowered and so less push-ability, or it's a weaker magnetic field in the airgap allowing an easy push-ability, but at the expense of needing more turns on the stator side of the motor to produce a strong magnetic field in the gap, which will then have more resistance and not be as powerful (get hot).   Is there any way around the magnetic resistance of the eddy currents and hysteresis and its reduced push-ability with a permanent magnet motor?

Only the guys from Jay-Kay have solved this differently.

 On all other hubmotors it's just tweaking the same PMSM concept.

For 6 months every post here's been talking crap about this Bustin/Dualomo that hasn't even hit the streets. It should be out in a couple of weeks and I can't wait to see you guys eat those words. I'm in middle GA if you want to come over and try it. 30+mph and climb over 25% incline is something no other can do since this is nothing but a copy of existing eboard's, huh?

Less so talking crap and more so trying to understand what it is. From this, it seems the consensus is that there's nothing unique about this board. And there's nothing wrong with that, but there's nothing great about that either.

One of the best things about this hobby (suck it) is that us eating our words mean progression. I love eating words. 

The only thing i don't like about the Dualomo is that it markets it 's Push-ability as if it's a unique feature of the board. I would be more forgiving if this was a Gear Drive marketing its free roll or if they even implemented a push assist feature , but all it is is a Good deck on OK components, on questionably ok wheels, with alright but can do better batteries. 

Bustin could've done better.

First off, your attitude should change so you dont dissapoint yourself :kissing:

 How is it different?

Is it *REALLY* the specs you claim? If so ill eat my proverbial hat, but until then I think that this forums seasoned users can spot false esk8 claims like a tennis ball amongst baseballs.

I'm not saying it's impossible but 700 watts is barely enough to get a 160 pound rider with a frontal area of 4 sq/ft (this would mean a full tuck most likely) and a drag coefficient of .9 to 30 mph (according to this calculator) it says .85 hp which is 633.76 watts meaning ou only have 65 ish watts of headroom http://www.wallaceracing.com/Calculate%20HP%20For%20Speed.php
Also I'm pretty sure that this early hub motors are 75 kv and at 42 volts (full charge) with 83 mm wheels a 1:1 ratio you get 31.5 mph with 100% efficiency. I've found that you get about 85% efficiency in the real world and I'm pretty light (140 pounds) in conclusion I don't think this board has the ability to go 30 mph with a rider on it in real wprld conditions and I don't feel like doing the math for the hill climb percent but I don't think a 25% hill climb is possible either

If you look on Instagram under Dualomo you'll see more photos of the board's components than you'll find anywhere. Motors out of the case so you can see if they are different. They say they haven't removed all resistance, just got it very low. I figured like on ebikes with bearings in their hub motors, but they can't have regen braking, which they claim to have, so total freewheel is impossible so far.

If they have a magnet passing a conductive surface, as all permanent magnet motors do, then eddy currents and hysteresis will occur creating drag.  The stronger the motor the more this drag will occur.  You can use many magnets and teeth and that will decrease the cogging that can be felt as the motor rotates at slow speed but cogging supposedly producers no net gain or loss so you won’t get a better coast that way.  So far it’s seeming they have good coastability because it’s a small weak motor. 

It seems to have a 20 tooth stator at least, so more than the typical 12 tooth, so less cogging, which is just the ratcheting effect you can feel in your hand but not going to make a better coast with that alone

The Pu on here and the motor size is like I sold years ago.   The Pu can’t take the heat and eventually softens and expands and flies off.   I bet if u were to run these at their stated max wattage for a while this will happen after some days and the deterioration of the Pu will progress and the tires ruined after not long.  Maybe not.  If not either there’s magic in the motor keeping it cool despite its small size and standard components or the Pu is something magical.

After multiple versions trying to make the motor stronger and keep cool I don’t want to go over 91mm.  That’s the plan.  All these lofty and torque board direct drives intended for giant wheels is going to put a lot of stress on an already stressed motor vehicle j my mind.  If it goes over 140f, that may be fine for magnets n wire but it will destroy Pu and bearings suffer and efficiency goes from bad to even worse

What about fat overbearings then ? Putting a rim between your motor and the tyre with even a tiny layer of free space will help insulate the tire yet allow airflow. Overbearings or outer bearings would help take the beating too :v:

Gunna seal motors next time n bigger bearings.  Ceramic would be good for stopping heat too.  But all these tricks...rather a bigger motor.   But yap yap n hope to meet these motors on the road n we will see.  Surely they need some kinda temp sensor in the motor to decreases current or it will go Nukuler.  If u try the local mountain up and down..
If u have these is San Fran write me and let’s see

Because he is lol.

@esk8tr Anything you've built to show us your more experience then us or something? We can simply do the math based on what we are seeing. 700 watts is for toys, not real eskates. The acceleration is going to be awful. It's not like we've been building our own boards or anything for the past couple of years...

Notice the design also of the truck. These are shitty hoverboard style motors. They don't attach to a through axel. Each wheel has it's own "axle" per say, held on the truck with 4 screws each. Why? Cheap to make and very easy to design. I think it's ugly and not what a performance eskate should be build on.

At 30mph, I want a proper through axle... That speed is not for the faint of heart...

I only have experience with belt drives. with the efficiency at 85% and all my board specs put into this calculator http://calc.esk8.it/ the top speed is accurate. I'm under the impression that your efficiency wouldn't change too much based on the drive system because it's a result of air drag and weight (because a 100% value would be no load/ full throttle on the bench)

Funny thing is...You'll be be either editing what you just wrote or just wishing you had bought something better when you yourself get to try one on a 25% incline. See you back here in a few weeks asking how to fix the clicky hubs and sleeve problems lol.
