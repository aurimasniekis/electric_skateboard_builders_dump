This video was posted by a YouTuber recently and appears to show a Verreal AT board with scooter hub motors mounted to a double wishbone independent suspension.

I think this could actually be a compelling product. Not from a raw power perspective, but from a ride comfort perspective. Fully independent suspension could be a killer feature if it becomes commodified by a chinaboard company.
