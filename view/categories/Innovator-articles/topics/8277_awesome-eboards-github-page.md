Hi guys,

I compiled a github awesome page about electric boards:

https://github.com/ciocan/awesome-eboards

Because the whole eboards market is still in early stages I put in the list almost everything I thought to be awesome.

Feel free to update it on github or here with new links.

That's exactly what I do :) 

All the joy of owning a tricked out DIY without the solder iron burns and brown pants from accidentally shorting lipos lol
