I'd get shot by cops in under 2 minutes carrying that around here :smiley:

How about making it white?

In all seriousness, I went to the police station and let them all look at some esk8s.  Then I asked them what the best way to not get shot holding a remote is.  They told me clearly "make them white".  :slight_smile:

That remote is by epicboards, tbh the only epic thing is the light on the remote. The connection is pretty shit and top speed is about 28km/h

...thats right its by epic boards and is available for 99 bucks.
The say on their website that it has a 2,4 ghz connection, so how can the connection be that bad? Maybe it needs some mods.
What has the speed of their board to do with the remote?:roll_eyes:

Don't people usually ride with their hands loosely at their sides? That means you have to raise your remote-holding hand to point the light in the right direction. Doesn't sound like the most comfortable or ergonomic solution to me. 
This could be very handy for quick inspections of your board during a ride but for seeing ahead I think a headlight makes more sense.

it surly will not replace the headlights, but it will be good for other things, like finding the door locker at night, because you always carry your remote in your hands. For me a big pro to get a light into a remote control

Multiple reasons for a light. I already carry one plus my helmet plus my head lights but having to bust out my light when I need it takes to long.

[/quote]

Just because it is 2.4ghz doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s any good. Look at the V1 winning remote for example. I know all of this because a mate bought one, pretty sure it doesnâ€™t even work any more. But the point was that the connection sucked, it would drop out at random intersections even without traffic lights or any visible interferences, and also on metal bridges which sent in rolling back down the other side

It might not be frequency-hopping spread spectrum, making it prone to interference.

ah OK, just thought 2,4 ghz remotes are all the same because of the frequency. Now i know more. Thank you:grinning:

Consider a direct cable connection, no fear of being 'shot' by the police and totally  eliminates any connection issues or battery problems.

I had tried to explore this idea before, and modeled piccatany rails on the FeatherRemote, which i figured would allow for any good quality gun light to be used, but obviously in lands where you're at risk at getting shot, it may not be the best idea
