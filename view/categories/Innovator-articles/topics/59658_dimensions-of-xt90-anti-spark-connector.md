Hi!

I'm am trying to make a push style "button" for a loopkey with [xt90 anti spark connector](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt90-s-anti-spark-connector-2pairs-bag.html) but i have one problem! my connector wont be here until next week so.. i'm hoping if anyone here that has a xt90 anti spark connector could make a sketch of all the dimensions on it?, not the itty bitty details just OD, ID chamfers and such?

Kind regards :)
