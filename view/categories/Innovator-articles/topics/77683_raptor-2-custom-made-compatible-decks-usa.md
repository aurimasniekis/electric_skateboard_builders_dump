Welp her she goes.  There are already a few boards I'd really love to see powered by the likes of the raptor 2.1 setup.  We'll be acquiring the full raptor kit at some point TBD, and will proceed to put it on a few decks. 

The first one I'd love would be this stretched skateboard mold.  In DK form, with 7" tails, the deck would be 48".  I figure we'll make the board exactly as wide as the Raptor wheels as they are now...  

As pictured: 
Length 42"
Width 10"
Wheelbase 26.5"
![image|690x374](upload://eR2Co2cu28FPTUsSR22vVQKh7Tb.jpeg) 

Wheel wells would also be included, but haven't been modeled.  

Another deck I'd like to see work, (this one would go great with 100mm wheels, with it's .5" mandatory riser height.  

Specs
Length 39"
Width 10" 
Wheelbase 26-27"
Kicktail 8"
Drops/rocker (.5" combined)
Downhill concave (not too steep or deep)

![image|690x379](upload://cBhhwwYuAtwj7c16cDO72uSuL3z.jpeg) 

I talked to PNL the other day and he said he still has some 23° baseplates.  

This deck would start as a 12 ply deck, and the bottom would have generous material removed on the bottom for the enclosure base to be bolted down. 


There are many other ideas I'd love to share, but this is the perfect topic for a shared conversation.  We could potentially blow our mind.

I do think your half an inch riser for 100mm is a rough estimate and it maybe as high as 1 inch on some setups for manuverability or soft setups.

This board has a deep concave.  The board is thick, and the wheel wells will be deep.  I believe based on this and other decks we've already built that .5" riser should work with no cut outs.  If you check out 

This deck has less concave, and shallower wheel wells than this one would, so I think 100mm would be close with a half inch riser, but my bet is that it fits.

This deck would have to have special 3d custom risers, but I think it would be SO cool!

It actually already is about as close as it can get both front and rear.  Well, the rear relationship is already set, but the front is closer to the main box (corners where wheel bite can occur)  and can't really get much closer.  It seems like 26.5" is the minimum acceptable wheel base for this board.

We're going to find out just how many of our molds currently can work to make awesome franken-raptors. 

Then we're going to figure out what molds don't yet exist, but should exist for the raptor.

Laminated this deck and I am stoked about it. Gonna do something like what has previously been designed. Can anyone speak about ideal sizes for the battery enclosure? ![IMG_1074|666x500](upload://wHojteFm9BPwcMwWI4nARFiV3we.jpeg) ![image|666x500](upload://rUF42qOMeyOg2eJghrc03DCPtil.jpeg) ![IMG_1070|666x500](upload://3EtkZrjYNvlsf3k64ATCYi9tdJM.jpeg) ![IMG_1075|666x500](upload://7s1OfnQTUGQ2pUV5P1nzZK0uVdZ.jpeg)

Hey hey @drangboards I wanted to see if you'd be open for doing a prototype / test board and the second 39" version you did above that I could buy off of you cause I'd love to get my hands on one of these things and ride my R2 daily so could give you any necessary feedback I learn to help fine tune it too.....

Not sure if you could do this as well but one thing that was kind of a pretty big pain when I switched my R2 parts over to my moonshine outlaw deck I'm currently riding (and love with how much better it feels FYI) was making sure that the screw holes on the enclosure and the holes you have to drill through the board to secure the base plate of the enclosure/etray to the deck from the top side is hard to line up exactly, especially with any type of concave. Any error in measuring / drilling can cause it to not fit or be secured properly and/or also cause the enclosure/etray to warp or bend some which we all know on ESK8's is not good any time. Since @onloop never made or provided a stencil with the package like it was once talked about (or a way to print one online would be super cool even) if you could have threaded coil inserts done in house for the enclosure mounting it would make the deck and build time exponentially better and easier. That way it lines up perfect every time and having it threaded is always a plus too. That how I do my enc mounting currently with my decks and it's great. 

I currently have the 97mm HUB's on the R2 motors in back but on the front I am running a RKP SR 200mm truck with the black Abec 97mm refly's and then the MFG outlaw deck I mentioned but am hoping to use that deck for my TB DD set up coming in a few months so keep me posted if I can be the guinea pig on this board (the 2nd one) at a discounted price or something.

IF not, I didn't see any mention of price or timing for doing some decks like this that will fit with the R2 so lmk on that when you can too. Also, if you need any measurements or anything I can provide that will help just lmk.

Thanks in advance and keep up the hard work, love what you're doing.

Absolutely.  You have some of the answers I have questions for on making this set up fit on the bottom of other shapes besides flat like earth.  Did you use a raptor battery?  My main questions have to do with different boards, I want to be able to mount the raptor battery onto radial concave, flat bottom tub concave, (with or without cuts.).  When I receive my raptor two system minus deck, I'll put it on the bottom of something to test ride, but to test fit, I might use this blank.  The biggest question is only to be answered when the board is ridden.  I love that you responded here, because that's how I like responding.  I don't want to give my answers to 1 person only at a time. 

@Deodand  I guess what I mean is; How wide and long does the flat section of the enertion battery pack interface surface need to be in order to get a good solid seal? Is there material we don't have to remove, since this board specifically has a longer standing platform, even inside of the drops.  The board here has more concave by maybe 40%.  It has a moderate w concave in the middle of the platform.  The rocker is negated by the lenticular shape of the W.  If we cut down all the way until the middle of the w concave began being cut, we'd be about 7" wide on the flat section, and on the left and right of the W hump, the route would be through 4 plies.  I think it will retain all the stiffness it needs, and maybe it can be further lightened with other cuts like deep wheel wells, flush mounts, and maybe some tail fluting which I invented last week haha.

My fantasy is to utilize the group setting to collectively envision some other versions of this board.  Can raptor 2 riders please tell me things I can't seem to find in any reviews online about the raptor 2 being ridden at the limits of traction while turning different kinds of corners.  My theory is that the wheels can suddenly lose traction.  but that they have good traction up until that point.  Most people aren't riding the board this way, but it is the crux and the complete focus of me when I consider the possibility that every rider  newb or veteran is going to need to make acrobatic maneuvers at some point out of dire need to stay alive.

We have really good DHL rates, and discounts on USPS and UPS international.  We ship everywhere in the world.  

This board hasn't been made yet.  There are probably 3 or more boards I'm trying to spur talks for.  This is a design in the making.  What do you want to see?  

We do have one deck pressed, and it's likely going to be the 39" shape posted above. 

Deodand, I don't want a 1 button survey as much as I want nuanced anecdotal experience and thoughts about what will make the perfect board.

Maybe you have gotten more info by now, otherwise I can tell you the battery part you have in 3d is most probably a rubber slab, not aluminium. To keep the battery compartment dry, they could not get a good seal against the wood.

That's great thank you! So this piece is all rubber.  I think we're on the right track still, but it seems all boards using this battery will need to be routed on the bottom to make room for the battery.

Enertion stopped routing out the battery compartment because of accuracy issues. The tolerances where too big to make it to mass production. It costed them too much time and the boards ended up not being splash proof. 
This routing stuff is only working for diy people who build their own one off enclosures.
I did watched some of your life feeds cutting boards. I really envy your work, looks like a lot of fun creating decks for a living. 
Looking forward to your progress! 
Btw. Why is your site down?

Just started a group buy for the last remaining PNL 23° baseplates.  They'll go fast.  Should have them here Friday if dude is able to get to storage to get them and ship them, or they'll come at the third week of Fab.  

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/23-baseplate-pnl/80931/2

The 23 degree plates will feel great at speed.  

I also noticed that these trucks are designed the same as the randal r3 trucks, which have a stand off section on the board side bushing which keeps the axle where it needs to be during turning and non turning events.  All around awesome set up for maximizing lean to turn ratio, and keeping slop from killing you.  

Those bushings will certainly be what I use for my raptor powered board front and rear.  SO stoked on these.  I'll be starting my first hand research asap.  Still waiting on the rubber gasket which holds the enclosure.

Just wanted to add a bit of info I'm stoked to try out this 23° baseplate from PNL.  The hanger isn't a perfect fit, the pivot isn't in by about 3mm or less. Whateva.  I'll have to replace the pivot cup sooner, or maybe seek some other solution, but I think they'll be fine.. 

Wanted to post some pics here to show how the raptor drive system looks in place on the Doobie based mold.

That is .5" 12.7mm of riser pad and there are about 2.5 of my fat fingers between the wheel and the wheel well which means that is ridable, but wheel bite can occur, so maybe an additional 8th inch or 3mm of riser and confidence grows.  I'm keen to ride a board that tall with that tail.  Gonna need some UHMW tail protectors which I have just now decided I am naming  Ass Dragons. Stay tuned for product release lol.

This deck is a few notches stiffer than the enetertion deck, likely because of the concave, and our better lamination practices Idunno.

This is a 11 ply deck and tie raptor stuff is going to be mounted to it. Today I received more raptor parts. Word has it I’m getting a unity!  Giggity goo Will post more stoked pics soon. I am about to have the fastest true dk skate deck this side of the tracks.

I still have some left.  The advantage with non powered boards is more speed with less twitch.  With powered boards my theory is that it will help vector thrust also, which will make turning while accelerating really fun.

Oh and I got what appears to be everything else yesterday.  I am a bit confused at how many riser pads you run on your boards, because I believe I got 3 total pads, all the same size, so either one is missing or I have one more than you use.

Yep, Final Answer Bob.This is exactly what I'll be riding.  I made a small change to elevate the truck mounting base so that it isn't comprimised in thickness.  The stock riser for the raptor 2 is .3125" or 5/16 of an inch or just under 8mm.  I suppose 1 riser pad only is used on this set up both front and rear normally?  I'd like to see if that will be enough.  

Now I need to remove some material in the nose and tail to try and save weight and give a bit of flex back to the board.

![image|690x375](upload://6PSTtJeOaVbkp1O9IdFbJgE3ygA.jpeg) 

Ok I got the weight reduction mostly finalized.  I could probably go much crazier on that part given this deck is much stiffer than the standard Raptor 2 deck.

Here is a shot of wheel clearance at 20 degrees of lean with 95mm wheels, and the stock raptor riser pads of 5/16" or 8mm.  I am thinking of throwing some flush mounts both front and rear so I can see about getting a lower height by maybe an 8th of an inch of 4mm.  I'd like to see more than 20 degrees lean before bite, and then less riser than the current raptor uses, by having these deep wheel wells. 

![image|690x375](upload://g4RghsCacBaZbu43XnCkma0qaIN.jpeg) 

Here you see contact being made at 25 degrees lean.  (keep in mind 95mm wheels) I think I'll keep it that way and leave the flush mounts out of this.

I made a few more changes to the model.  It would be a bit more artistically stylized, but whatever.  I think it is good enough for me.  What do you thin?  It looks happy right? I am still a bit on the fence about cutting flush mounts into the deck, but I'm going to see what happens without them on the first deck.  It is going to last forever at 11 plies.

Me too brother!  I am planning on having this deck set up soon, but i might just have to set the raptor 2 up on a raptor deck. I still need to make a CNC vacuum pass through fixture to hold this blank down for cutting and I have to redesign just one aspect of the surface to match the piece that covers all the wires on the way to the trucks. After I redesign, and then make the CNC fixture, I'll be able to cut the first one, and after that I'll know how much the board needs to cost, and can start taking one off orders, or get people into group buys for discounts.

I am currently in deliberation over what to do with the piece which comes out of the enclosure, with wires.  That piece cannot be bent upward very much I assume, so I might need to change that part of it.  Might need to put some cable notches in the board too under the trucks.  

I have done some figuring and I am certain that the deck I am building is going to have somewhere around 3-7 additional mms of wheel clearance, which is awesome!!!  I'll be able to replace some cup washers with flat washers board,side  and/or road side, and get a bit more lean on the board while being able to tighten them up a bit.  

I have been riding this board now for long enough to almost feel "used to it".  That being said it still scares me and with how loose I have the trucks even with whatever skill I have riding downhill boards, I can still not keep the board from being overly twitchy under full throttle.  I can't wait to get my 23° PNL baseplate on the back of the board!  The new deck may happen this week.  If I didn't have a date I'd be pushing to have it cut tonight, and I still might.  I need the new deck.  

How many people out there would be interested in a no kick (or tiny kick) DH board?  

How about a cut out DH shape, where we can run zero riser, and still get zero wheel bite...  I could even do extra deep flush mounts, for a nice low rider. ooooo that will be really nice.

I like everything you just said above and am interested in all of it really.... lol. Seriously though. 

And I always vote for a kick even if tiny or noticeable at first as long as it is a little functional like what is on the jet spud I think is the smallest or lowest profile you would ever want to go.... just my opinion.

I want one of those decks cut out for the R2 stuff ASAP though!!! How soon you think I could get one of even prototype one for you maybe to help you with decisions...? I ride mine multiple times daily so lmk.

I do want it.... but at that price tag I would want to have you do your test board first before paying that much to make sure there aren't little tweaks that you figure out should be done and work out any other little things on the shape or cut outs or anything else that could make the board that much better and already be stuck with the first one that doesn't have any of the first time rider adjustments cause I'm sure there will be at least a few things that need to be modified... right? You get what I'm sayin though.....?

If you were to say "here you are kind of the guinea pig with me on the first board we cut and for that reason you'll get a intro one time price of $xxx.xx to test it with me" then I would be down with that for sure, but not at $175 when I am basically being somewhat of a tester who will provide some good real world riding feedback and input ya know...?

I do believe independent of anyone's review and before it hits the roads, Iam able to say that this deck is near or at 100%.  If you want to wait in case something has been looked over and needs an edit, this is highly unlikely, but feel free to wait.  I don't think this board is going to retail for much less than 150-160. Given the materials and work that goes into it.

K tonight I am going to find out if the deck I made works.  I wish you were all here with me to find out, those of you who get stoked on that sort of thing.  For the rest who just want to see something they can buy, I know exactly how long it takes to make this deck, all that goes into it, and will certainly be wanting to build as many of these as I can, for those who own raptors and want to feel like they can contact the ground again with the tail without deep fear.  I'll be pulling everything apart, and putting it back together tonight on the new deck.  Not sure what I want to do for Grip tape, but I have an idea which shouldn't cost any money.  I'll get more photos and vid tonight. I did a bunch on this board on instagram live last night, @drangmfglab.  Should still all be up for a few hours.  

Gonna mess with a few things.  I took the throttle curve up to 25% poly +-.  Also upped output amps to 66.  How high can I go? I'll imagine for now.

Thank you! I requested to join the FB group, and I'd like to sign up for the club you mentioned sender, is that electric-skateboard.club?  

I cannot underestimate how even extremely subtle changes to a deck will make ride significantly different, and in this case, significant changes were made.  

Now that I have the new deck, I am going to be changing my acceleration curves again to be a bit more extreme, because the wide stance I can utilize on this board makes it so much more comfy for my wide hips and tall stature.  

I guess most of the people on here aren't raptor owners then huh?  

I should mention that I can make any shape out of this mold and we can accommodate many battery enclosures.  Keep me in mind for your future builds.

Coolio.  I do need to change some things, for example I way over estimated the strength of the tail it seems to be flexy which actually feels great at speed, but I am afraid I weakened it.  We'll see.  That's why I'm riding it.  I'm going to take it somewhat easy for a bit, and when I'm in the clear for a new deck I'll really jump on it, and see if I can get it to break. Less weight savings on the tail.  

The thing about this is that the board could be literally anything.  We are a full service custom longboard shop.  People spec boards out however.  Let's do your specs all here on the forum.  You down?  

Yes, I'll put the holes for the battery.  I'll be revising the wheel wells a tiny bit so as not to take as much material on the tail specifically.

Could paint the board any color or do color schemes with staining, tinted clearcoat, could use composites on the board, Fiberglass (22 ounce triaxial snowboard glass) or 8 ounce triaxial carbon fiber.  Those options would maybe let us go from 11 to 10 plies.  Might want to bury another layer under..   

But I digress.  We could totally just do this board again with a few specs n stuff made best, for the official v1 of the unofficial raptor 3.0 as I see it.  I could even cut the shape to a different overall width and length. 

I made an 8 inch tail on this one because I really wanted to know that longer wasn't better, and for now I feel so comfy on it doing wheelies up to maybe 18mph so far.  

The biggest questions a deck needs to answer are what will happen when you need to not die the most.  This deck is that for me.  It is also so huge I can butt board on it, and it's way more maneuverable than while standing.

self voted best electric skateboard in all of ever, between the deck, the trucks, and the El Jefe of all prebuilts, the raptor 2.1.  I am going to film skating, because my local road is the most bumpy with seams which tore my last set of wheels up and this board is taking that all like a champ.  I am shocked by it at 100% battery and at 50% it's probably still faster n quicker than the boosted.

Jared, the only thing 100% here is confirmation that you are a shill.

Why are you personally attacking Jared for liking his Raptor?

Yes that was me who flagged your post. It's a shit post

@brenternet, this seems a bit harsh if I am understanding what you are saying, @drangboards should be excited, biased and proud about what he has done here as he has put tons of thought and hard work into trying to satisfy the wants needs and desires of the collective efforts of the DIY community.

Why you Brad, I can't possibly argue with you.

If developers and builders here lose their objectivity we're out in the cold.

I'm gonna refrain from giving my opinion, but I'll say this. "Better than a boosted" is not a high bar when discussing speed and range. Although safety is a different discussion I won't delve into.

So developers and builders can’t have their own favorite board ? 

@drangboards’s been ESK8 for more than a year now and he’s comparing his experience with the new customizations he’s made (notice how in his comment he highlights the deck , *his* deck first) . He , nor any others rebuilder or developer has no responsibility to be objective. They like what they like and they shouldn’t be dogged for it.

Brent.  I do wish your post wasn't removed.  I like me some controversy.  Let's talk about why I make these claims about the raptor being awesome before I even go into what I've done to it to make it the best raptor in the world for me.  I have been riding it for a short period of time so far, but I haven't seen anything else anyone has said about riding the board harder than I do because I haven't seen anyone doing that. 

Raptor Motors are strong, and durable. The road I ride on to work every day is full of all the stuff that turns motors into 
 ![IMG_0489|375x500](upload://xtqhgVzvpvTjMgoUMuEgMUDDjos.jpeg) 
This is the first Funing longboard motor set up with a v2 hanger, because I bent the v1 hangers like 10+°
It aint my first rodeo, and Commerce Drive here in Murray is not the kind of road you expect board to have a very long life on.  

Cheers for good rubber, great seals on the motors, thick enough rubber to actually get over most of what you'll ever need to on the roads, and the price/power ratio is good.  

The enclosure is made well also.  Good product.  There are other awesome completes out there I want to try, and I'm sure I'll get behind more products which I have tested and know to be awesome. 

The deck I made for it is such a different experience than the standard deck which has it's purpose.  

This deck is the first raptor compatible deck.  The final product won't be 10.5" max width, it will be probably like 10".

I am thinking I might like to sell this deck to someone when I go to make a new one.  

I'll be building a slalom style raptor deck, some drop through or cut out decks maybe although the rear wheels are extra wide and that presents problems for the cut out width.

I am actually shocked by how high I can ollie with this deck.  Proper leverage makes a HUGE difference. 

This deck weighs over 26 lbs.

I was going 30mph over an overpass in the shoulder and there was a 1x1 across the path, which i picked my nose up for but took the back wheels over it.  It would have done so to anyone else and I even had my 23 degree plates on.  Good luck going over that with a 50 degree rear plate.

edit it really almost wrecked me standing tall with cars passing in all lanes of traffic.

I run 35° rear.
Im just saying i wouldn't ollie on hubs because i don't think they can take it.

Olliing will without a doubt do much less force on the wheels than riding them.

Should modify that to not stomping high ollies will likely do much less force than just running over bumps.

I've seen enough hubs motor hangers bend and or snap that i wouldn't risk those forces. 
Then again i don't ride hubs at all. Maybe if i lived somewhere with really nice roads.  I like full urethane too much.

It is true they feel better.  At this point I've ridden 3 sets of hub motors and 2 sets of belt (boosteds) on the same road back and forth on the worst concrete pavement in the neighborhood.  Commerce drive in murray is very undesirable riding per se, but the raptor having a bit more thane helps.
