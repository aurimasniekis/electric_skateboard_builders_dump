Recently I had the idea of ​​making an RFID lock for my e-board. But I just do not have the knowledge of what parts I need or how I can build it. Please help me.

Do you have a wrench?

Can you code so that power is only delivered if RFID Tag is present near the receiver to be detected withing 5 feet?

I think then i would need a very good and expensive RFID reader. I thought about just holding the card under the board and it would be unlocked. With like a cheap arduino RFID module.

That should work with a cheap RFID reader. Use RFID tag to enable VESC use after power on and keep doing that every time board is turned on and used.

I would just use an Arduino and some code with the RFID tag to turn on the board via a MOSFET switch. I would probably just do a thing where if it's scanned you have like a minute to push a button to turn it on and then just the button turns it off again.

Don't turn the board off if the RFID isn't present.  Just engage full brake at random once speed gets high

does any one has an idea how to wire the RFID module and the arduino to the vesk or the whole eboard 
circuit?

You need to know which RFID module, the specifications and/or schematic for it to begin with.  Then you need to know what you want it to do

"Don’t turn the board off if the RFID isn’t present. Just engage full brake at random once speed gets high"

This is a really good idea dude! Thanks!

Yeah, but good luck testing it to see if it works :stuck_out_tongue:

And the penalty for forgetting your own key is either going really slow or a big accident

Yep. I have some ideas for testing. But if I lose my key I better just go full speed on it to teach me yet another lesson. ;)

But i think that the current of my board is to high for the arduino and the RFID module. (I would use something like that: https://de.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-RFID-module-RC522-Kits-S50-13-56-Mhz-6cm-With-Tags-SPI-Write-Read/32502259949.html?spm=a2g0x.search0104.3.37.5ce86b99OXa8Vp&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_1_10320_10152_10321_10065_10151_10344_10068_10342_10547_10343_10322_10340_5722611_10341_10548_10698_10697_10193_10696_10194_5722911_5722811_10084_5722711_10083_10618_10304_10307_10302_5711211_10180_10059_10184_308_100031_10319_10103_441_10624_10623_10622_10186_10621_10620_5711311_5722511,searchweb201603_25,ppcSwitch_5&algo_expid=eec09648-3ba4-42d5-b469-265ef0ff0212-5&algo_pvid=eec09648-3ba4-42d5-b469-265ef0ff0212&priceBeautifyAB=0 )

A slight modification of this idea would be to put an RFID tag in your shoe, so it unlocks as soon as you step on the board.

You also don't need a full arduino, you could easily run it off of an attiny or similar, which would reduce the power consumption.

That is a great idea! but I still dont know how to wire it up to the battery or vesk.

Another idea would be to have the rfid not be the actual power controller: If you spin the wheels, the vesc will power up for a moment on the electricity generated by the spinning motor. You could use this to activate an e-switch that would then turn everything on for real. 
Once that happens, the RFID reader wakes up and checks if a valid tag is present. If so,  everything behaves normally. If not, it listens to the throttle signal, waits for full throttle, then overrides it and slams on the brakes, then deactivates the eswitch,

Like @b264 said earlier, to figure out exactly how to wire all this, you have to come up with a specific idea of what you want it to do and how it should do it, as well as exactly what components you want to use.

I think you are on the wrong forum dude... 
I would suggest to learn some basic arduino coding and then copying a existing RFID proyect.

After that, start thinking on your project ;)
