Modules could also be mounted using advanced doublesided tapes. 3M has good range. I have tested 3M VHB tapes and they have very strong bond. Its used on trailers instead of rivets as it is stronger. I had to use full body strenght to get one 20x40mm magnet off. Read manufacturers data sheets before purchase paying extra attention to holding force. This is most simple no brainer solution. It gives some cushioning as well. I would give it first place in recommending to mount the modules. Here is a video on strength of the tape:

Having printed these modules in ABS following the recommended settings on your website I can say that they went together with no issues, (snug but in a good way) I will likely end up changing the 3s 10p battery for a 4s 8p NESE system._

For anybody seeing this thread for the first time: These are worth the price, especially since the designs are open source and can be printed at home. If you want a solderless kit, use this. I spent a year playing with other kits until I finally decided to throw down the money on these, and it was worth it.

BTW, checkout the  flexible battery pack like you did with the m3 threaded rods. I put 3mm carbon fiber rod which fits snugly into cylindrical hole positioned at the middle of the box(not edges). It think it's going to turn out nice.

I think its next simplest way of mounting. You can take 2 or 3 aluminium angles and drill them to match nese holes and 2 for mounting on the board. Then all ot takes is to unscrew 4 nuts to take it apart. And its tidy, and it will flex with the board. Only i would mount it lid up for durability but it might be alright lid down as well

Reposting for new thread: Is there any clear reason why this battery would only output 25v despite battery-to-battery being 52v? I've since replaced the single positive terminal ring with two using 10awg wire, still not enough power output. It'd have to be the BMS, right? It was pulled from a battery that hasn't worked in some time so I am unsure if it works completely.

Have you even thought about it? It feels like movement for unnecessary complication. i'll explain, again.
Tesla does it, cause there are ~7000 whatever cells in their battery pack. Internal short, that fuse would help in safety would be in one over a million cells. For Tesla, one burned family in 143 cars i a huge liability, that's why they use it. Few tens of cells on the board is nothing. Its a hype.
But i could make it, it would be larger

Check your wiring. You have 12 balance wires. Most of the time 12S would have 13 wires. If its 12 wire PCM, connect correct charger. Sometimes protection kicks in and PCM needs to be reactivated. Connect charger for short while, disconnect and check your voltage. Tahe a photo of PCM front as well if above did not help.
If you have 52V on the battery terminals its def PCM, either wrong wiring or faulty unit

It has 13 balance wires, it's just hard to tell from the photo. Each is connected in order to the positive terminal of it's number, charger doesn't seem to fix the issue. I suspect that I overvolted the BMS at some point. I'll replace that. Thanks.

The reason Ive thought of cell level fusing is that when I've lost a single cell in a 6p, I've ended up losing all six cells. Correct me if I'm wrong but I understand that with cell level fusing you only lose one cell, which results in a modest voltage drop in that one parallel set.

Say you have 5 cells fuse for 100A, so 20A per cell and one blows. Now you pull 100A out of 4 cells at 25A per cell. That difference might bring those cells to thermal runaway temps and the whole board might be on fire. Its different when you have hundreds of cells in parallel as one cell gets little currents and capacity drop would be unnoticeable.
You probably were playing with dodgy cells or used cells with unknown history. If one cell would act weird in small pack such as used on the boards, the fault should be noticeable strait away
```

```
@agniusm, in your above explanation the missing information is what is each the fuse rated to blow at?

I tried to analyze it and the thermal runaway scenario didn't come up at all. A properly designed cell level fusing would actually avoid that. Take a look:

Max amps drawn by both ESC: 100A  
Cells in Parallel: 6  
Max amps per cell: 16.67A  
Rated Continuous Discharge per cell(25R): 25A  
Fuse rated to blow at : 30A  

Say one cell has gone bad then the fuse safely blows, leaving the other cells intact. The user continues to draw 100A peak(20Amps per cell) and still everything is fine. 

Say another cell in that bad P group malfunctions and the fuse blows. The user continues to be able to draw 100A peak(25Amps per cell) and still everything works fine.  However, he notices a significant drop in capacity and realizes that certain p-groups have lost cells. He pops in 2 new cells, replaces the fuses and it's fixed.

Say he doesn't notice the decreased range and doesn't fix them. And to his bad luck another cell in that p-group goes bad and hence blowing the fuse. When he goes full throttle he starts to draws 100Aps(33.3A/cell). The fuse does it's job and instead of letting a thermal runaway happening, they just cut off the cells without destroying them.  The end effect is that he will loose braking at that point and ... 

But the fact is that there is no thermal runaway problem. There is a problem of loosing brakes when all fuses have failed. If we are using smart BMSs like DieBieMS, it can be programmed to realize a cell fusing has blown and warn the user in some ways.

[/quote]

This is why I don't fuse anything but the charge port.  I would rather the board burn itself to a cinder than run the risk of no brakes when you least expect it. Fuses blow all the time for no apparent reason.   Charging though.  **Thats a different ball game and most, not all, but most fires happen when charging.**  

_Disclaimer_

This sweeping statement is based on the assumption that the battery has been built correctly.
 and not by me.

```
I have not seen cells that could be discharged at 20A continues. Manufacturers state that but...
I was looking at 5P example, but i should use 4P, 3P, 2P examples. What then? 3P group, cell max at 30A (one of sony's VTC's). Set the fuse at 35A, controller is at 90-100A. One fuse blows, and then there is a fuse that does not blow (cause there are no identical fuses). Now cell can be sucked at 45A.
I have seen how high power cells accelerate in heating up. I was testing with VTC5A (35A). At ~33A it quickly went to 90C, what would happen if you would not notice and fuse does not fail and you drawing 45A? It will get lit !!! Or maybe become a projectile.
You can experiment if you want as you have CAD skills. See where there is unpadded tab, u extend that side by the width of the fuse, make a gap for the tab and holes for the fuses so they touch the nipple of unpadded tab. Use glass or ceramic fuse of desired rating. Smalles i have seen is 20mm so you are adding 20mm to width and that becomes 94.2
BTW, anyone seen what 30A fuse looks like? Nothing even close to tesla fuses :rofl:

![image|466x466](upload://eaneMoEYA8BgZ2hrUOCXKWw7PQc.jpeg) 

I always recommend using brand new cells from authorized resellers. Use of additional insulation on positive end, use of at least PCM's. If you do that, there is no point for fusing except weird nonsensical fused cell movement :smiley:
I get it when people try to implement safety in powerwall builds where they use used tool, computer, medical cells ripped out of the discarded packs and they have hundreds and thousands of them. There is no benefit here.
After all there is no fusing on laptops, medical devices, UPS'es, hand tools, even large backpack batteries.

It should be pretty easy to monitor each P-group and determine if one ends up with less Ah. With a BMS that exposes each group's voltage over CAN an alert could be easily added to any open source receiver+remote. I'll probably do this once my NESE-inspired pack is done -- I plan to have a fuse wire on the + connector:

![image|615x500](upload://bVjSnsU6wpweRbxCBxQlRHnwKQ1.jpeg) 

12AWG will take the place of the plated copper, with a 3d printed support to translate force from poron to the contacts. @mishrasubhransu if you are at all interested send me a PM, I would appreciate any printing advice you have as I've only done a bit.

@agniusm

Wonderful work here! I've seen some of your progress between here and the endless sphere. I do have some questions. Please forgive me if they've been asked before.

Are the 3D models available for the BMS portion of your 10S7P battery? I see you have one for the DieBieMS but I wondering if something more generic was available.

Are there models/dimensions for the internal parallel tabs? I understand if you don't want to share this one. Seems like this would be the money maker.

At the moment i have no other bms modules shared as i am experimenting and trying to get it as simple as i can. If you imagine there are tons of PCM's and BMS'es out there and then i have modules ranging from 2P to 8P and to mix and match all would be impossible. I will release empty enclosures and add brackets for the boards i own so one could mate them in cad and produce desired combination. For other boards it will be up to comunity and individuals.
I do not share tab dimensions and cad's as i would like to keep some of the stuff internally as it generates some income for me to work and improve this design further. Hope You understand. Its simple part that could be easilly replicated but if you go that length, you have to put in some work :)

@agniusm just to be sure, what exactly does one get when they buy a set of the  tabs? Is it exactly what's pictured, in other words enough material for 2 4P modules? I'm just confused since it looks like 2 8P tabs, 1 with the poron foam 1 without.  Are you supposed to use the foam backed one on the positive side and the unbacked on the negative side?

You get 2 full tabs. You cut them in half and have 2 sets of 4P, or you can cut them to have 5p and 3p sets. 
Does not matter where you put the foamed tab. I usually place it on negative side

I finally mounted them on the board with inserts and vibration mount. Putting the insert in is the hardest part. You have to get the spacing and the angle right. I had to make a small 3D printed jig to make sure my drill went in at the right angle and right position. Next time I'll try to think of a simpler solution.

Somehow i came to consensus, that the best way to mount them is with high end industrial doublesided tapes. It might sound weak but its actually stronger than any other option. It does not add to the hight, maybe 1mm or 2mm. The board remains flexible. You can still pry modules off. Most of all it very quick and requires not tools.

That might be the simplest of solution. I believe, it, still, will need 2 small 3d printed(joined to the NESE box on the bottom side with the standard screws) on which you would stick the double sided tape. If the deck was flat it wouldn't be required. The other alternative would be to use multiple layers of the double sided tape instead.

I'll try the double sided tape when I open up my enclosure(It's sealed shut and has the original NESE setup) after completing 1000km. I'll do it only if something was broken, haha.

I got an unused full 12s4p kit from someone else and after receiving it I can see he cut all the tabs in the middle, so now I can't make a 2s4p modules anymore but rather 2 x 1s4p.

Does anyone have an idea of how I can join the tabs back into 1 full tab? I tried soldering a braided wire in between but didn't work.

I'm trying to avoid having to connect them from the outside. 

Picture of the tabs:

No those are how you make 2s4p modules.  Have you seen the drawing I made which shows how is done?  There is 8 cells in each, and I cut all but one of the tabs in half.  So the ones that are cut have 2 4 parallels.  You run 4p, up one side, and once you get to the end unit that isn't cut, you go back down the other way.  It's exactly how a 12s4p would be set up on a double sided module.

Thanks @agniusm, I tried soldering again and this is what I ended up with:

 ![image|690x335](upload://4pEo2cHob5oQ7cIs7EeuPhrc8mQ.jpeg) 
![image|690x335](upload://9EyX4qbp2YUFtTOF88bUQyAQTKS.jpeg) 

When doing this I had to make sure to not add height to the tab otherwise you can short the caell (e.g.: cutting the battery wrap with the solder joint near the position terminal) and also would make the lid not close.

I deformed the cases a bit with the heat so I had to remove a tiny bit of material from the cases near the middle so it would close properly.

Definetely not as nice as the module that had the full tab but I feel like this will be reliable enough. What do you think?

Modules ready to go:
![image|690x335](upload://92kEFC0gd2KmdvYPb9Ns4YY79bX.jpeg) 


@uigiroux I can see what you mean, if you are doing a layout like this it would make sense to have them be separate 1s4p module(all but 1):

![image|243x500](upload://jzyE18ZXftoapyrzpgqL3lv8Nkx.jpeg)

If you got it done, it should be alright. Only next time pull tabs out before soldering and solder  the tab with no foam. It does not matter where the foamed tab goes anyway and excessive heat can damage it ;)

So I checked and indeed the tabs were smaller(8mm width instead of 8.5mm). I have modified it to accommodate 8.6mm width tabs. I also created sheet metal cutting and folding diagram. Please feel free to share it they work out for you. 

If people want to cut their own tabs, they can print the [dbms_tabs2_flat_pattern.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fRkiAY4ir7_9TYPGS1eeWNAG4aPPAaYh/view?usp=sharing) file, paste it on a 0.6mm sheet of copper and then cut it with shears.

Thanks. That's what I tried at first but there were 2 issues:

1. If soldering the tabs outside the case, when trying to put them back in place the solder joint would break because you need to bend it to fit it through the holes.
2. Soldering on the side with the foam allowed me to not add any thickness to the inside. When I soldered the side without foam the box got too tight for the battery.

With more patience I could have probably overcome those issues.

Just a quick note. Soldering is by far worst way to make connections. Signal wires, ~ok, but power connections best to be avoided. Solder has poor conductivity and is hard, so it might break.

Well, I'll have to say you're wrong.

What you meant to say is, it's probably a bad idea to use solder for power connections because it's very hard to do well, but when done well it's better than a cold weld crimp.

I did not meant that. If you look arround all wire terminals from oem's are crimped and not soldered. Automotive, general electronics, etc. Again, solder is a bad conductor, it breakes, it can go loose if power flowing exeds safe operating limits and cable heats up. I am ok if you have another view on that but my science does not go with that.

Yes, in vibration prone settings, such as in Automotive, a cold weld crimp is better.

However - solder IS better for power connections. Unless we have a different meaning of 'better'

It's really a situational thing. But in a vacuum where nothing is moving... solder is a better power conductor than a crimp.

If u get a good crimp connection it’s copper on copper with no air and not with low conductivity solder between.  Lower elec resistance.    And less likely to break or no cold flow.     If u get a fancy crimper they will literally press the materials together making essentially one wire

I have it on thingiverse link i posted earlier, on the bms part. One file is bracket, the other is grommet. They gave parameters that you can just enter in inventor and it scales part in length or width or depth. Was eandering if this future is lost on import or still available on SW

I did some research after the discussion here and learned how crimping can be better then soldering for many situations(some even say most situations), was very surprised to learn that.

As you can see from the post above I ended up crimping, I used some ring connectors I bought at an auto parts store and I used the wire cutter I have to crimp (it has a section for that in the handle). I'm not 100% confident the ring connectors I used (they similar thickness to the NESE bus bars) will handle the load from a 12s4p 30Q battery and my crimping tool is not the best either.

I tried to pull the connector out of the cable with a lot of force and they didn't move at all, but I don't know how it will hold over time. I'm temped to add a bit of soldering to the end to help even more.

It depends on the quality of the crimp and the quality of the solder for sure. Have you heard about the xt60 on ender3 melting? That's because a partner company was crimping the xt60 connectors instead of soldering.

Bad quality xt60. Then, shit happens when you crimp connectors that are meant to be soldered.  Its Chinese with their nonsenses. Its a poor example to begin with. 
Most have soldering iron but industrial and professionals use proper stripping and crimping tools.
Your system looks great.
I like the shape of your board. Very sexy.

Just had this email from a customer, thought i'd share:

"Hey buddy. Thought id let you know that your battery holders are  explosive safe. Put a battery in backwards a thermal runaway came so quick I barely had time to get it in the protection bag I  use but after explosion almost no damage to the unit."

"Very cool though. Well that's our way of saying very interesting. I  had my foot on the bag and felt the explosion. Then I  looked and the other one was ready to blow so i stomped on the bag ag but it just seemed to release pressure through a hole in the side. Very  exciting though. Thank you for building a great product"

21700 hardware should be almost on time. I would estimate up to 2 weeks being late. First modules will be sold to order so expect some delay for building them.

[/quote]

It depends on your layout   
If using @gmurad's layout below, you need 6 x 8P tabs and 12 x 4p tabs  
![image|690x335](upload://76jF3oQMqBVZNcA5hlewlyMJKIs.jpeg) 

If you are using my layout below, you can just use all 4P tabs. If you don't want to have the long red wire at the bottom, you can use 1x8P tab at the bottom to make the connection internally.  
![image|666x500](upload://wT53e3uPVvq5NNvBW1vh25DVYCO.jpeg) 

You can come ask questions here too, more people to help.

Shallow screws are now available.
I have received some 21700 cells to test fit modules. The fit is nice and all works great.
8P comes at 715g fully loaded so expect similar with 2S4P.

You would need to space them out. I dont have 20700 yet but it will use same 21700 hardware. You could use shrink wrap rings on 20700 to bring diameter to 21mm

So 21700 hardware is here and is available starting today. Complete modules are on demand as i have to build stock and evaluate what products are main-sellers.
On this occasion 10% discount for one month. Use  **21700** code when purchasing.
21700 modules will use 21700 series bus bars when mounted back to back (surface with the greatest are) or 18650 series bus bars when mounted side to side (mostly on flat scateboard builds).
This will eventually be fixed and 21700 modules will use 21700 series bus bars in any orientation.

Bumping as my second set of hardware arrived and I'm reminded of how great these things are. I'm moving my second setup from vruzend to NESE because the improvements are so drastic. Not having to worry about vibration is the main reason, but it also doesn't scratch my hands when trying to disassemble. Really can't get enough of these. Thanks again!
