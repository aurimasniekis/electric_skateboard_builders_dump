I sat down after school and spent a few hours diddling around in Fusion 360, just fiddling around with different drive concepts.
At school, we're pretty heavily drilled to follow a design process which goes something like:
1) Research / Evaluate existing solutions (aka what can you copy)
2) Conceptually sketch your designs 

I recently brought a pair of Jacobs, but there's already a few things I don't like about them, number one being how damn thing the urethane is, and number two being the fact that they literally don't "FOC".
That's the negatives; the coasting of 14 poles is something to die for, even in BLDC they're incredibly silent and they have a really weird but seductively nice feel when accelerating.

So with that being said, I began carrying out Mr campells design process; i.e. stealing ideas from other hubs.

@onloop eliminated urethane slippage with the Ghosts
@Hummie nailed urethane thickness with a 55mm ish motor
@Jacob 's 14 pole's are stupidly nice

With a few of my own requirements, I matched the dimensions of ABEC Big Zigs:

And this is what I came up with. Ignore the textures haha.

I'm only 16 so I have no idea how fit for purpose a system like this would be, so could I get some tips from people who have more experience than me? @hummie or @onloop maybe?

Here a nice topic with lots of pictures of the progress, also use the search function. Cant give you tips about hub motors because i dont ride them, but there are plenty of tips buried in the forum discussions.

Cool shit. Lower the pole pair count.

Hey @JohnTakesPhotos awesome you want to design your own hubmotor!

I am 17 years old and am also planning to make one myself but understanding and designing a brushless dc motor is quite difficult for me (Idk where to find information about that)

I have found this article: http://index-of.es/Varios-2/Motors%20for%20Makers%20A%20Guide%20to%20Steppers,%20Servos%20and%20Other%20Electrical%20Machines.pdf
Maybe we can stay in contact and maybe help eachother? :slight_smile:

That guide is an axial direct drive, correct? I tried designing one of those a while ago, but with 5065 motors to cut down on weight and give it a slightly more appealing aesthetic.

Would something like this be mechanically superior to hubs? (the wheels have Kegel dimensions)

@PredatorBoards I thought that higher pole pairs allowed for more torque due to a higher copper fill?

@Bor.inc Take one apart... quite literally the best way to see how it works. And for sure, pm me

I wish I'd be that good in Fusion 360...

I learnt by watching a few of their webinars - they're all free and on youtube! Another great way to learn would be going to local [meetups](http://meetup.com) where they learn Fusion 360 together. In my city an insanely talented engineer does completely free workshops once a month.

Your latter design looks pretty similar to carvons

That's exactly what it is, it's an axial direct drive system. ![37%20AM|690x448](upload://zgkwkGaeGUVMmOfWJ7GgApmKhOq.jpg)
