Showcasing the design of the enclosure so I don't ruin the other thread.

Nice one, how sealed it is? Is there a rubber sheet or something like that on the inside?

It's not my board so I wouldn't know but I can look into it. It doesn't really effect the design of the enclosure. Just place rubber sheet/gasket underneath the enclosure

How much would something like this cost to print?

Do you mean if you wanted to pay someone to print it for you?

Or the plastic itself?

Not sure.

You could check 3Dhubs.com or maybe someone here could do you a favour, its a lot to print though

cura calculated 1day 1hour 33min for just the front part one middle section and the end part :sweat_smile:
with 0.1 and 100% infill...
yes it is a bit to print.

Yeah but 0.1mm is a bit much isn't ?

Easily bump that up to 0.2?

Printing an enclosure to make a mould for for a carver board atm. Full print time will be around 6 days for that one with 15%. This one has some complex structures as well so I'd guess something similiar.Cost will be around 30-60 euro. Depending on material etc obv.

Just for interest I looked in 3D hubs. 
1x Front, 1x Back, 8x Middle part in PETG around 75 Euro. Ready till 2.6. .
I would offer you to print it too, but I just started with 3D printing, so I guess I first need some more experience before I'm ready for so big parts.

Nope, for me as min. Realized that there is always something you need a bit different than on what you get already made.

It might open up if yours is a long board I guess.

Looking at the 3d pieces, it surely does. You would need to add some sealing material inside to avoid dust and water.

There is this really great closed cell rubber sheeting we use for vibration dampening 1/16 with stick back. It also repels water really well. You can cut to any shape.

I designed a modular and 'flexible' enclosure a while back for @agniusm N.E.S.E modules. But the design is easily modifiable to knock out the N.E.S.E module and eBay esc substitute specific components to make room for a flat spotwelded pack and a Vesc / Focbox, if someone wishes to do so. I used just silicone to seal the gaps to 'weather' proof it. This here in the pictures fits 10s4p on a 36" deck, but completely configurable depending on your decks length. 

Not the most elegant one nor am I super proud of it - but it worked! I have now moved on and abandoned this design.
