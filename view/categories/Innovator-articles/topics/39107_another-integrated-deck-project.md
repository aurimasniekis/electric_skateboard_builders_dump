Hi Guys!
I need your opinion about it! It's not going to be easy to make it so I need every opinion I can get.
Size similar to Jet Spud. Space for 10s5p pack and some electronics.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/0/4/043ca30bf14bf2ee362dc919cf748ff5c2801631.JPG" width="564" height="499"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/5/25e3f9a40a542fa5894ef8e7e6fb294cef2bd226.JPG" width="613" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/1/9/1904643fbfa64a1716bd4bf658a2a35ddf8f2c4a.JPG" width="690" height="483"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/9/9/9943f13c17026316b755213fd1d0d55d54eef51b.JPG" width="651" height="499">

Is there space for mounting trucks? I feel like a 10s5p will take a lot of structural integrity away risking cracks so either make it longer and thicker or decrease the pack size! Also, work on the concave, its very important!

The solid area it's about 70mm so trucks should fit. I can always make it bigger but I want to push the limits and make it as small as possible. The concave thing is the hardest part for me because I never skatebord in my life :D

What type of wood are planning on using?

Theres two difficulties here. Strength and flatness.

Electric skateboards are easier flat, for batteries, but better with concave.
Strength is hard, which is where material choice is important.

I tried for over a year to make a board like this work, but I had too many fail while riding. So I went back to the basics. Maybe reinforce with carbon fiber and use the wood as a core? Just food for thought.

Best of luck!

I plan to use maple plywood (18-20plys) as I mentioned in your build thread. Also there's an option to order custom plywood and add some carbon fibre or something else.
As for shape......

For electric skateboards, that shape is the easiest shape. Never ridden a board like that, so can't comment how it will ride.

Personally, I like the progressive and radial concaves best. But they are harder for electric skateboards.

```
In my opinion you should make a compromise between size and range. 
The small size will likely not feel very stable at speeds of 25mph. and will probably make the ride uncomfortable after a few miles. If I ride my 10s3p all the way, my legs are already as sore as can get. Same goes for grip on the board carrying the 10s5p weight.

Superpaintskillz! No :smiley: , I seriously believe that that is your weak spot on either board. You still have to run wires from your electronics to your vescs, so even more from that T structure will be weakened. If you stay with this I don't think wood is an option, you'll have to go the carbon fiber way.

So have you decided on a battery size? 10s5p is overkill for this size as I told you earlier. (imho)
Also, while you are thinking of a lay-out. How is that cover going to work? should it be easy open-able or are you going to close it shut with bolts ?

I must stop doing this night time.... Again you are right. Second one looks like crap but It's a atempt to make concave not flatcave. I have a new idea based on first design with 10s4p battery. As for cover.... Bolts for sure. This will create like outer shell and will be crucial for this design. Once build is done you shouln't have a need to look inside very often.
```

## \#14 Posted by: Skitzor Posted at: 2017-11-29T01:03:49.182Z Reads: 546

```
Well that all depends...
I think something the size of this is looking for just a 10s or maybe a 10s2p battery. (Again, that's my opinion and advice) Which saves you some room on the interior. Going from this standpoint. You have a 10s4p (5p) in mind. Going lower in capacity, but giving interchangeability a chance, you need a lid (and battery) that's easy removable.

And yes, whatever shape/size, concave is a must !

I think I have mentioned this before on similar thread, but a inexpensive way of adding rigidity is by adding lengths of aluminium extrusions, say 90 degree angle.  Of course it would have to be insulated so as to not cause shorts circuits to the battery and electronics.

```
The T thing isn't going to work out as planned. There's a reason Ollin sticks with the 4.12 format for VESCs. They fit in the channels that go all the way down the board and structures like this are avoided. ITs also one of the reasons he uses dual diagonal. You're going for dual rear which requires the pocket you drew up. That pocket is the source of the issue. 

Instead of having a single pocket, bring the center wall all the way down to make two pockets, and widen each one at the end to contain either a 4.12 or 6 formatted vesc. then you can notch the tops of the walls for wires and not dig all the way down for them, leaving some wall for strength.

Another option, and more complicated, would be to laminate all the necessary connectors into the veneer.

```
Have you considered reverse engineering a deck design based on a vendor's existing battery pack dimensions? 

It might make it easier to keep the structural integrity of your design, rather than offering heaps of space for custom battery packs.

I built something similiar. Space for up to ~14s5p (10s5p installed) and two esc. So far it survived the first test drive.

@baxter aluminium is no good. It depends what alloy and hardness but this what is easy avaiable is no good. It bends and just stays that way. If a first prototype fail I'll try a insert from square carbon fibre tube.
As for battery I was planing to build a battery exactly this way

@Jinra I hope you don't mind that I used your photo? I belive that here more pople build their packs than buy ready ones.

@longhairedboy thanks a lot I'll try to follow your tips.

@fummy wow! nice one but it looks like quite thick. If your works, than it is more hope for mine to be ok :)

And question about CONCAVE! Is 5mm enough? How big it should be?

there are lots of variations the hi5ber yellow jacket uses some rocker (front to back curve) and some concave (side to side curve) to make a front and back "pocket" you can wedge your foot in to so it will not slip.

![image|488x420](upload://fTfo0hVV2Cd3cGxBiByUVYTqcFp.jpg)

look up popular DH decks to get more ideas on the variations that wheel flares and gas pedals or W can add to the above.

truncated tesseract adds "w" and wheel flares

rayne fortune v3 has a double flare to push your toe in to... get creative or use the basics? all the landmarks also help you know where your feet are by feel

Do you plan to sell this ? 
If not would you allow me to copy the design to make my own ? I think of an integrated deck for so long ! 
Will you stick to 10S4P ? In your current iteration what is the size of each pocket if not the same ? 

I really like it ! If i may suggest some design tought you could run motors wire by digging little cavity from truck baseplate to the pocket on the other side. I’m not sure it would compromise structural integrity

This way I can put fiberglass layers in between the wood layers

Thanks guys for interest. Here is my take on the whole thing. As for now there's no integrated deck that is tested. I want to build something that looks good because for me that is the main advantage of it. There are amazing decks out there and very high quality enclosures so I believe that integrated deck is no better in function. @NAF deck gained a lot of interest but for me personally it looks like deck with enclosure. Top cover with button looks like a cool idea but it can be tricky to seal it from water. I also believe that once your build is done  you should not have a need to look inside for a long time. That's why I think I'll just put grip tape on without any cuts and it will seal the whole thing.
This is a first prototype and I can see already that I'll do some changes to make it better and also to make it cheaper. If everything will go as planned you will be surprised with the price ;)
I'm not shearing any dimensions yet because it constantly changes but yes 10s4p with BMS and dual ESC.
I have a plan for bigger model with different shape :slight_smile:
So next week I hope I can finish this first prototype and start some testing. I have already a bit different design according to advice from @Cobber (thanks ;) )  When I have the prototype I'll add holes for wires and other things and maybe even an integrated lights. So give me a little time and I hope you won't regret it :)

If you are making this a reality please give me the honnor to be the first one ever to buy this deck from you 😍😌

I am truely in love with this deck, this is actualy what I am dreaming about for years. Now I’ll wait very patiently. ( imagine this with hummies or Carvon the sleekest board ever ) 

I have just a suggestion, is it possible to add a layer on the downside ( road side ) of beautiful wood ? Like some black veneer or something tasty you know... like on arbor decks etc.. even if it ads a little bit of cost peoples would be happy to have a premium feeling on the board

It is not full CF -- it's all wooden core just like this deck but with carbon fiber and fiber glass layups. 
I hate full CF decks too. Had one. There is too much vibration out of pure CF comosite decks.

Okay ! I tought it was actualy the same design that used the deck of the raptor 1 and that was awful with street wheels. 
If the core is wood it should be much more vibration free !

No not at all . The shape is based on Jet Spud / Potato but that lid idea on top is of course taken from R1.

There are going to be 3 layers of maple and one finishing from different woods. I can choose something from this.![aaafornir|690x409](upload://8ahsdzN2SU7gnTZIpc2heZLPAuL.jpg)

Yaaaaay ! 🏂🏂🎖🏆
It’s gonna be a game of patience haha can’t wait to see what you come up with especially on the concave 
Either the middle one (3) or the far left (5) if you ask me 😌
An error lot of shapers do is not use the same layer on the top as well, for the peoples who will use clear grip or honey comb etc 
So if you choose one « fancy » layer on the bottom be sure to apply it on the top, many thinks it’s not important because of griptape but for example look at this beauty :

I’m from France and it does not surprise me. My brother in law design custom furnitures,custom everything from scratch and then build them and he always says that Poland is the coutry with the more handy and highly skilled peoples, that will always try to overcome difficulties and be highly involved in the projects at a point it become personal to them... and before going in Poland he manufactured stuff in france, germany, italy.... he would always have problems ( especially in France and Italy we are the worst of this continent hahahaha)

The plywood that I use it's very strong but not enough as I assumed at the beginning. That's why I need to add extra layers of veneer and glass or carbon cloths between them. There's no way other than test different versions to tell what will be enough. Don't worry guys won't release anything that could be dangerous.

Don't worry it's not a final look as I did it manually just for quick check to get rid of wheel bite.
Those Ronins are giving me hard time as the can go so low but I love them :smiley:
You can see also a brown 3D printed washer that I plan to made from aluminium with integrated lights. Plan is to have Nichia or Cree led there with stepdown module. Rear will be red COB LED strip.

I have also received final plywood which is much nicer that what this first prototype is made from.
Veneers are thinner and there are more of them. For now I have enough material to make 5 decks ;)

most people don't know how to properly seal a lid. on a production board, that can and has been a problem. I used to do raptor repairs for Enertion back when the Raptor 1 was selling. Water damage was most of what i saw. Rusty batteries from the factory using shit nickel, crusty deposition on PCBs, etc. However, the Raptor 1 had huge gaping holes in its lid for the charge port and power buttons and fuel guage. Riding that in the rain in a stock configuration would be tragically stupid. 

I also see a whole lot of gross inside the Evolve Carbons and always have to clean out the bays before i can drop the new packs in. Not just moisture deposition, i'm talking full on dirt, even mud. 

There are good ways to implement a top lid that will work. Unfortunately, it seems like no one is using them. closed cell silicone foam is a good start but usually its too thin. 

I have stuck with bottom mount boxes for simplicity, not because i favor one over the other. However, simplicity is often the best choice when trying to eliminate a problem related to complexity.

Seal can degrade with time but so as any other part. 
I'm considering bottom mounted lid..... it gives problems but also opportunities. Don't have enough time to test both and it would be the only way to find out.

but doesnt more water hit the bottom than the top from the wheels spinning up road water versus just rain..
the new boosted board has went with a top mounted lid too

Yeah as for myself with the raptor 1 I have done again 2 time the seal because it would be worn out over time. When riding in rain I simply always used duck tape to seal everything for the ride ( screen, charging port....)
+ I had covered the whole deck of grip tape so the side of the lid couldn't let water in

That is correct. Which means that no matter which decision you go with, you're going to have to know how to properly implement a seal that lasts. 

I use silicone sealer on my boxes. I don't reccommend that for tinkerers that want to get inside and mess with stuff every day because you'll just spend a lot of money and time buying and waiting for silicone to dry. For that, a thicker closed cell silicone foam gasket would likely be the best choice.

I know that I'm late to the game because of @bevilacqua and his HAYA. There are many things that adds to that. I'm working with forth company now on this deck and finally I'm confident that I can make a great product.
Mine is different than HAYA. 
It's CNC milled from Baltic Birch but it also has a bottom layers made of Oak pressed on a 20 ton press
 (I believe full pressure is not used in this case ;) ) Baltic birch is great material. It's not so dense as beach wood for example and dampens vibrations better. The process is quite complicated because it starts with cnc milling, than it goes to press and cnc on both sides again. 
Why I took this route?
I didn't wanted to make just cut from a plain board deck. I wanted to achieve "real" long board deck look. Those oak layers also adds to strength of the whole thing. I have checked a lot of different types of veneers and decided not to go with maple because there are better ones for this application. It's not a ordinary deck and my approach was also not to stick to what's known but to find something better. 
Deck is slightly under 30 inches. As you can see I'll try to build 10s4p battery with dual ESCape and some big Bestech 80A BMS. This bms might be to much but I'll try to do it. Everything is quite tight but that was the plan to build small rocket :smiley:
I have also in the works this version with small kicktail and should have a  prototype next week.
I'll try to throw some numbers (measurements, weight and price :) ) tomorrow.
Shoot with your questions and opinions and let me know if you are interested ;)

I think I will end up setting up my last prototype deck for kicks, but unless you have like, a 12inch wide deck press, I can't fit enough cells into one board. Your on to something with the stacking of vesc's though for 4wd and how you can fit 60 cells too. I could only fit 60 cells, and no vesc's, haha.

Deck weight is 1350g.
As for the price it should be around 150 euro. I'm thinking to launch group buy next week but timing is bad because of Christmas and New Year. Things simply going to take longer during this period.
Depending on number of orders first buyers will have extra special price. Also there was a number of people that waited for this deck but it took to much time. If someone is still interested from this first group I can do a special price for sure :)

Something like this should work ;)

@harrypzee I like your attitude :D Thing with carbon is not tested. For sure this press is for veneer. I can put layers of carbon between veneers but not as outer decorative layers. I should probably be a different technique and would add to cost. I'm not saying no, but I have to focus on the things that need to be done first and than this product will be at never ending development program ;)

I just got the HAYA deck, but I think I want to sell that to get one of yours...  Such an amazing design :heart_eyes:

I don't imagine it's possible to get one that's like 4 inches longer so 12s4p could fit..?  Will these fit 2170's?  Also, I have both of the ESCape's cases you made, dual and single.  Would it be possible to get the deck with a cutout on the bottom for the dual ESCape case?

@uigiroux the purpose for this deck is to be light and compact. What you are looking for is quite opposite. I'm working on a big brother now ;)
All you guys need to remember that because those integrated decks are higher the leverage is longer so you need to fine tune your trucks. I belive that split angles and harder bushings is a must for high speed board.

I almost ordered 8x3s1p Lipo or 10s4p vtc6 but reason set in and told me to wait for the deck :D Since I didn't listen to it when buying the Hummies I'll do this time :)
I love N.E.S.E. modules, they give me a feeling of control over every single cell. As far as i can tell, a (6x)2s3p module would fit in there too, I would have to drill not very deep holes in the sides for the bus screws... But without N.E.S.E. a 10s4p fits. With the Lipos it would work to get a 10Ah 12s pack consisting of said 8 3s1p packs, but I'd have to get two in parallel for this and I want to CONTROL EVERYTHING (:exploding_head:) the Lipos are 23mm in height, will this be too tight, might it work to remove the cover, I'm starting to get crazy :D

edit: 12s3p N.E.S.E. made it, this time I ordered only the metal parts. I'll modify the case to fit the deck 100% ;) Its more expensive than the spot welded version but I can check each cell if I want to :) Other advantage is that I can take apart the whole thing for boarding an airplane :).

Have you a lid tease for us Luke? Textolite that's an interesting choice over regular glassfiber, is there any material property that was really attractive or is this an available and fits the bill thing? Soviets used it in heat shield technology!

Another nice choice maybe basalt fiber but not sure how hard it is to get, really indestructible stuff, Trampa uses it as far as I can determine & they offer a lifetime guarantee on structure of their boards & Pele had fake hair made of the stuff

![IMG_20190114_165132|375x500](upload://r1xwOIMCP9P36tkv0wFRV0Imjoc.jpeg) 

@banjaxxed Tekstolite is strong material and widely available in Poland. Maybe it's because we were under influence of Soviets for many years and learn how to use it? The thing I need is stiffness from 3mm thick material. Epoxy and glass fiber (also known as glass tekstolite or FR4 or G10 ). Might be better and I think I have found a good source for it. I'll test that. Basalt is more exotic and Trampa deck are rather flexy so maybe not ideal for this application.

@Grozniy yes the no kicktail version is 150euro and kicktail will be a bit more because it's bigger and I can have 2-3 board less from whole sheet of plywood compared to no kicktail version.

**BTW. If any one have a good name for those two let me know. I would gladly stop to call them by a version ;)**

@LukePL Can you CNC the integrated enclosure one mm deeper? Before you never added the thickness of the lid to the value so I thought that NESE modules fit easily but they are 22mm and now its onl 21mm that they can take. I will reinforce the structure anyway so this Milimeter shouldn't hurt :)

It's hard to say how many miles. I have used whole last year one ugly prototype that I would never give for free to any one with zero problems. This prototype was made with a vacuum bag (the one used for clothing storage) and vacuum cleaner :D This final version is made on press so much better process. Glue that is used is from Franklin International and it's the one that most of the deck company uses.
There's always a possibility but it would have to be manufacturing error in which case I would send replacement.

Yes I did ;) Worked really well. I made like 5 of them with that technique and every piece was ok. I had Miele vacuum cleaner which is quite powerful. When I cut veneers to shape I was able to laminate 2 at once. My deck has some quite rounded areas but with more traditional deck you can probably do more. For carbon wrapping should be also enough ;)

How water resistant are you planning to make the deck?
