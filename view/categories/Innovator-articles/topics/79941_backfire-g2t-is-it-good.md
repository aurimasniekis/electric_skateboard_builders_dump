The new Backfire board: backfire g2t, has a new custom remote and i think uses hobby wing esc. I have a couple questions like:

will the vibration issues be fixed?
will the torque be better?

and so on. if anyone has seen what it has done, pls tell. i wanna get my brother a board and idk if he'll use it enough for me to make him a top of the line one, but i just wanna cruise with him.

I would not get a hub motor board when things like Metroboard and Arcboards exist.  Also boards come up for sale on this forum a lot.

If you buy a cheap hub motor board, it means you're going to have to fix a broken hub motor board, and that means you will have to replace everything, because you can't use the trucks, can't use the wheels, can't use the motors, can't use anything at all once something breaks.  Which will happen.

Cheap china hub motor boards excel at being cheap, but that's the only thing they excel at.

I have had two G2 and One G2s and for the price the G2 was really nice for a begginer board with ok spec. The G2s was a major dissapointment! Good Esc and super quiet but the battery is totall crap, I had better range on the G2 and the advertised speed is for the first 0,5km then it drops significantly.

The vibration issue was never fixed from G2 to G2s but it comes from the urethane having a bad fit on most batches. If you get a good batch you will have about 1mm of space between urethane and hubs, they have a dirty fix for it, apply some greese. I works for maybe two rides then it's back and you are most probably gonna spray your shoes Whit it when riding.

Hope this one is better. They have at least made a lot of improvements continuously even if it is the same board. Both my G2 and my friends had different parts that had been upgraded between batches.

Also good to know is that their customer service used to be a little disorganized but always got good help but that has changed. Now it is beyond terrible if you have any problems with your board! The stall and try to avoid fixing boards that are not up to the spec. 

Both me and my friend had serious issues when we got our G2s boards. I ended up selling it discounted in the end because I got so feed up with them for not fixing it. (Got a small refund from them in the end but not near the lost cost)

@b264 ik all of that. My brother is 15 and he has something called osgood-schlatter disease. its where he has a bone growth in his knee from repetitive jumping, i have the same thing. we got it from over-playing basketball and now his is pretty bad. thats the point of getting him a board. he goes to his friends house to be driven to cal-train, and i think this would be a good for him since my parents have to drive me to the bus and him to our family friends. 

@M77 i think the battery was better for the G2, but someone had an accident on it and they cut down on the battery for the G2S to avoid another lawsuit or something. idk tho, the G2s lacks acceleration, but i think it slightly makes up for it in the flexy deck. they claim to have solved the vibration issues, but :lying_face: i doubt it. another issue is the battery life, but my brother only needs to go .5 - .75 miles there, so one mile - 1.5 miles in total so that doesn't worry me.

So why not this for $755 https://metro-board.com/shop/shortboard-electric-skateboard-brushless-outrunner-motor/

Or this

wait its 755!? did not know that, thought it was 1000 something! arc board is something i was looking into, but it wasn't flexy and osgood-schlatter would hurt from constant vibration, so i think flexy is better.

You can send them any deck and they will build the board on your deck.  That $755 metroboard would be waaaaay better than any china hub motor board.

Or you could get him a DIY from here, there are ones that come up for a sale a lot

Thats a bitch.  Had it most of my life and it sucks.  One thing worth mentioning (although I would think that the us medical system is far more informed than the uk national health service in the 80s) is that that syndrome makes the whole knee joint weak and I have suffered from dislocations since day dot. 
Saying that I ride urethane on hard non flexy decks and the vibrations don't really have too much effect.

@b264 just posted a link to the board I’m selling. Might be a good board for your brother. Not flexible, but the Abec 11 wheels dampen vibration quite well. I’m in the Los Angeles area.

Hmm a bit late but chinese hub board these days from the top 4 companies have very good reliability. If someone really wants to go 25MPH for 10 Miles on a longboard, its pretty much impossible to beat the value of them DIYing without getting Lipos or owning the equipment to build your own battery already. 

You need to know when to reccomend prebuilt vs diy, its usually at about:
600$ Budget for a shortboard or cruiser in the US
800$ For similar in the EU

Otherwise you kind of have to get parts which are restrictive to upgrading or also shitty chinese.

When you miss your first day of work because you bought a shitty china hub motor board, you'll know all about why they're cheaper.  And then you can't work on anything or upgrade any of it, you have to start over again, except without the money you gave to the shitty china hub motor company.  Almost like you'd have been better off not buying the shitty china hub motor board....

It sounds like you have had your own experience with them, which board did you have? Regardless if you haven't checked up on them for a while they don't break down often, probably similar failure rates to boosted and better than evolve. 

You can upgrade many aspect of the board before you make the move to belts. You can get front wheels and trucks (Save the back half for belts) an enclosure, bigger battery, vescs, maybe a deck then finally jump to belts and have a full DIY. Really depends what people want I suppose, but the boards just aren't shitty, they provide exactly what is advertised with good reliability and service life.

There is so much evidence. Constant threads of people posting broken trucks, fires, and all sorts of issues. Just search the forum, reddit, and internet and you'll see.

Paging @b264 in response too

I have done, and I can't find any without water damage. As for other breakages, there was a faulty batch of meepo trucks a while back but they were recalled and replaced for free and I have not seen any issues since (Other companies go through these issues a lot, even ones praised/liked here). I wouldn't make the claim without extensive reading and knowledge/awareness of issues and things going on with the boards, I talk to and make serious recommendations to so many people both online and IRL that I want to direct people towards the best options for them. Again I am specifically talking about Meepo, wowgo and ownboard. If you can source unsolved and relevant issues from any of those companies parts/boards please show me, I am happy to change my opinion about things but to all the searching I can do even now I can't find evidence of what you're talking about

Again im trying to be as logical/evidence based as I can here and from all I can search you guys are just witch hunting

It probably just sends more current to the hubs, so it will be a heat issue if its done for too long

Very happy to own the Backfire Board G2T have not came down to any types of issues with it. Very cheap to service when things needs to be replaced. It's a very fast electric skateboard for it's kind no need to worry about dramatic voltage sag it will carry you until the end with ease. Yes it's considerd a cheap Chinese buget electric skateboard but it's perfect for it's price , quality and performance. Can't believe I had put a good 1000miles on this board already.

I purchased a backfire g2t skateboard and I’m very happy with it but I have gotten use to the speed of it already and I would like to upgrade the hub motors. Are there any hub motors compatible to ones that comes with the board? But with higher watts like 600 watts per hub.

```
Hub motor watts mean nothing and a higher watt hub motor won't increase performance because you're limited by the ESC and battery anyway. If you don't have the bigfoot sleeves on it already those will increase speed, or putting in a VESC might give you a little extra speed. Beyond that, you'll have to install a more powerful battery to get more performance out of the board.
