I have a vision for the ultimate VESC that includes multiple VESC 4.12's on one board, with canbus already connected in the design, vedders antispark switch, and my bluetooth module, all on one board.

I do not have enough kicad design knowledge to do this correctly, so I'm looking for someone in the community to make this a reality. I need someone who can combine these designs, verify traces are wide enough, and verify no electrical problems exist in the design.

I am looking to pay, so please pm me with your price for a dual and quad design.

I think there are people on this forum like @Duffman or @The_Dude who might already have designs for this. Maybe they can help out
