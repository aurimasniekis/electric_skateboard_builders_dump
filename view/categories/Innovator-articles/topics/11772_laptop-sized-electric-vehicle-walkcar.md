Quite hilarious to be using it on the city streets with those wheels, but I would love to have one of these to power through the airport!

If it can't go faster than an old lady jogs it's embarrassing to be seen on it.
Having now seen the video I want one. Seems good for a congested sidewalk

Not as bad as I thought considering how compact it is. Definitely better than the Moboster posted not too long ago.

Those tiny wheels are going to skid to a halt on the first tiny rock they hit, and send you flying.

Thats probably why the top part is metal (or at least it looks like it is), it acts as a ballistic shield when the batteries blow up.

When you hit those sidewalks that are misaligned with 1" vertical deviation on that you'll fall flat on your face standing like that. At least a skateboard allows you to fly off in a way you can keep running.
