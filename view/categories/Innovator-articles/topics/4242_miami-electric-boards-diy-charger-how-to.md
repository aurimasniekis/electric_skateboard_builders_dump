##Hey eSk8!

I've gotten a lot of questions about the 6S charger I make using a VGA Port.
http://miamielectricboards.com/shop-1/ez
I thought I would just make a quick guide showing you how it's done! 

#Parts:
VGA Connects (Female/Male)
6S balance extension leads
18AWG Wire

#Skills:
Soldering

#Step 1:
Cut the 6S balance extention in half.
Set up your VGA Connector to solder each lead to it's own pin. There are 15. I use the Top 5 pins and 2 of the middle pins.
Make sure you put heat shrink on the wires.

#Step 2:
Preform the same steps as in step 1 on the other side of the VGA connector. 
*VERY IMPORTANT* Wires must match up/

#Step 3:
Soldering battery leads.
Split the battery cable into 2 pins (2 for Red and 2 for Black) 4 Total. This will allow you to charge up too 6amps.
Sorry phone died at this step and could not take a picture before heat shrink.

#Step 4:
Hot glue your leads! 
This will further insulate and waterproof each lead preventing a short but also keep the leads from getting tangles or breaking.

#Step 5:
Connect in **PARALLEL** with your battery. Either with a parallel harness or soldering straight to your wires.
And connect balance leads.

#Step 6:
Charge!
Connect the other half of the adapter to your charger and start charging!

Realy useful modification. It was the simplest way for me to charge with Imax B6 witout open the box. (photo - summer 2015)

just finished mine the vga port I used was 9 pin for some reason so I could only use one pin for the battery leads not sure how many amps I will be able to charge at. I used a cable mesh so that the balance leads would all be in one cable and wont tangle.

Yup, All you have to do since you got bought it with no connections is Solder directly to your wires or solder your own connection and connect it in parallel.
If you have any issues or questions PM or Email me :grin:

This is a great solution! 
Is it possible for you to send this charging adapter (only this thing) to Europe? I saw your message on your website stating, that you only ship within the US, but is it possible anyway with such a small item? It would very much appreciated! :)

[quote="eLDoska, post:8, topic:4242"]

[/quote]



Is this for each single pin?

I counted on my VGA cable.. it has 15pins.. So, if 7 of them is taken for balancing (6s), I still theorethically have 8pins left.. So does it mean I could push 20A through 4pins (+) side?

So far my charger puts out about 5amps.. (~100w).. So, if it is not 20A total for 4pins.. I assume 1.5A per one pin should still be fine..

I guess I actually answered my question.. but if you have info that would be great!

Sorry for the slow reply. In the datasheet of the connector which i use it is indicated 5 Amp for each single pin.

if i were to use the positive and negative charging wire pins for the positive and negative of the first and last cell respectively, could i use this for a 12s pack?

also, how can i charge a 12s pack with a b6?

I understand your tutorial here but I am trying to figure out how to do like the guy in this video https://youtu.be/UVcUgsTTknM he charges with one vga port,but has a total of 4 3s batteries (2 3s connected in series to make two 6s and then the 6s connected in parallel to make a 6s2p pack). I just don't understand how to wire up one vga port for this. Do you guys by chance have any of these or could you make one

Yup you nailed it.
You would set up two 3S packs in series to get 6S.
Then you would setup both your 6S packs in parallel.
Then Finally connect the parallel packs to the adapter(also in parallel).
Unfortunately, I cannot make one at the moment as each one takes a bit of time that I do not have right now.

Most adapters you need are out there, the only one you would have to make is the VGA adapter.

3S Series adapters:

6S Parallel adapters:

https://hobbyking.com/en_us/xt60-harness-for-2-packs-in-parallel-1pc-1.html?___store=en_us

VGA adapter: you could ask if anyone is selling one, or if anyone is willing to make one for you if you don't want to try yourself.

So is it possible to have a 12s setup (2 x 6s in series) with 2 VGA charging ports (one for each 6s) so that I don't need to open the enclosure to change anything around for plug and play charging? 

I hope so, I already made the 4 VGA port adapters accordingly.  Even if I can only use 3 and have to charge each 6s individually and not at the same time with two external B6's. 

If this is possinle could someone please explain in a little more detail? (Sorry for being such a cottonheaded ninnymuggins)

You can do it with a single VGA port. I've done it with 10s (2x 5s in series), and it works great. You would need a 12s balance charger though. (or external BMS)

I understand that it could be done with a single port if I had a 12S balance charger.  The big thing is I don't, and they're pretty expensive from what I hear.  

Thus my plan is/was to use two Imax B6's (or one if I cant charge both 6s batteries at the same time) as they are readily available, have a good rep, and most importantly, are affordable.

Does anyone know if this is possible / how it could be accomplished?  Would I need an anti spark between the two batteries, as well as between battery/esc? 

If so, would it be done with a parallel connector to each battery + VGA adapter in series with another parallel battery + adapter?  Thank you all in advance!
