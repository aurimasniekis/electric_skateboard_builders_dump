Hi!
I just lanched a new app on the play store. The goal is to help esk8 builders to easily calculate the range and speed of their eboard. It is still under development, but I hope that it can help someone with building their eboard.

Unfortunately this app isnâ€™t accurate at all. Maybe you should try and redo the formulas?

Hi, I'm always up for improving stuff! What are the numbers you get in real world usage?

Hey! I just saw the second picture is Wh/mile so I will need to test that again, but for the first picture, the top speed would be 50kph+. On other calculators, they do show that for me.

This is a really basic app and it covers only a subset of what http://calc.esk8.it/ does for free, so I think you shouldn't charge anything for the app. Especially if it isn't correct, that is the least a buyer could expect when there are free alternatives that indeed work correctly.
