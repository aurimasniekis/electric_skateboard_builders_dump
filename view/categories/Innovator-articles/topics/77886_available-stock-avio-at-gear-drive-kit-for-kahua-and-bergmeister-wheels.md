# Description:

Hey guys! You guys are probably familiar with the [Avio Gear Drive for Urethane wheels.](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/gauging-interest-the-aortal-gear-drive-63xx-50-caliber-ll-compatible-97mm-wheels-and-above-tested/67496)

I've have since been poisoned my the AT wheels in my local community (I blame @ervinelin) and have decided to design one for an AT drive with the use of Bergmeister Wheels and Kahua Trucks from https://haggyboard.com/ - Timo, @riverside.rider.

# The Kahua Trucks:

[![image|500x500](upload://eKtARYMS580z35QGJ6tjeXxtSog.jpeg)](https://haggyboard.com/collections/trucks-accessories/products/kahua-precision-milled-trucks-front-back-truck)

> * The  **Kahua truck**  is made for speed on any terrain! It is the combination of a forged and precision milled hanger with super strong 12mm diameter / 8mm stepped axles and a 50-degree baseplate.
>* 340mm total truck width with axles made of extremely strong carbon steel.
>* Tighten the 92A barrel bushings and your board will be stable for gnarly speed fun, loosen them and you can enjoy an intense carving session.

# The Bergmeister Wheels:

[![image|500x500](upload://coFh6a9kU16jbypQiZxcJK2Gc8o.jpeg)](https://haggyboard.com/collections/wheels-tires-tubes/products/bergmeister-all-terrain-complete-pneumatic-wheel-set-150mm-diameter) 

>* Precision CNC milled three-spoke hubs in  **5 different colors** to choose from. 150mm wheel diameter and 45mm width. Fits all standard longboard trucks with 8mm axles.
>* The  **Bergmeister All-terrain**  tire is designed with a multi-arc profile, which means that the thread profile varies across the full tire profile. This design allows for better steering and providing substantially more traction than normal shaped tires of same diameter.

The design has already been modelled with a 3.75:1 gear ratio, using the following primary components:

| Material       | Component             | Colour | Qty |
|----------------|-----------------------|---------------| ---- |
| AL7075-T6         | Motor Mount           | Black| 2
| AL7075-T6         | Cover                 | Black| 2
| AL7075-T6            | Pinion Gear 16T            | Black| 2
| POM        | Spur Gear 60T          | White| 2
| POM   | Wheel Adapter         | Black| 2
| Nitrile Rubber | V-Ring                | Black| 2
| - | M3x25mm Screw            | -| 12
| - | M4x3mm Set Screw              | -| 4
| - | M5x30mm Screw              | -| 6
| - | M8x35mm Set Screw                | -| 6
| - | 6801 Bearing                | -| 2
| - | 6805 Bearing               | -| 2
| - | 3-DP Squaring Jig                | -| 1

I am planning to do an pre-order of these drives, should I have a sufficient interest in this (**and only if everything goes well with testing**). Timo and I have also been talking about this and he is keen to offer a package deal of his trucks and wheels with this drive. Do take part in the Poll below if you’re interested!

[poll name="Interest Form"]

hahaha, @Linny, ....I am actually in a somewhat similar position...too much stuff piling up here. 

As @nuttyjeff already mentioned above, the idea is to offer a package deal. If you purchase from Jeff the Aortal AT setup you will get a sweet n sexy discount code from him that can be used to purchase either of the two packages from the haggyboard website:

**Package A:** 
- 2x Kahua trucks with replaceable / screw in axles
- 4x Complete Bergmeister wheels 
- incl. shipping

**Package B:**
- 2x Kahua trucks with replaceable / screw in axles
- 4x Complete Bergmeister wheels 
- 4x Extra inner tubes & tires
- incl. shipping

We are still discussing the idea about the rim color possibly matching the Aortal AT gear drive....so I would say that this depends on the poll.
Nevertheless, we will have some new fancy rim colors soon.

This drive is designed with a fixed Gear Ratio (3.75:1) that isn't meant for those wheels unfortunately. (The clearance between the drive and the road would also be really small for a urethane wheel of that size.) 

If you're looking for a urethane gear drive, you might want check my other thread - The Aortal Gear Drive.

Sweet! What deck is that?

I realise I've not been updating this thread, but that's because I've been working with the supplier to get the prototypes out!

So, update: 
* I've ordered 4 drives to test (for me and my local esk8 riders.) To arrive by mid Jan where testing will ensue. (We have builds ready to go and waiting the drive :D)
* Am working with Timo on the price of the drive and will release the price when the drive is ready for pre-orders.
* Almost every component of the drive will be CNCed, down to the motor pinion, from 7075 Alu/ POM and will be black hard anodized. (Seems like black won colour vote, no surprise there :P.)
* Logo will be laser engraved on the cover, because, why not :D I might go with a red logo for production pieces, because of +23.4% speed.

I had the exact same problem with a switchblade deck. The corner of the deck hits the wheels.

I intend to push the trucks further towards the edge of the deck to solve it (:

Hi @murdomeek
Indeed, the angle can be freely adjusted as the motor mount is “clamped tight” onto the round surface of the Kahua Trucks. This means any angle can be chosen depending on your deck.


You can see the area where the mount is placed....accordingly the motor mount can pivot by any angle

Good work!

@nuttyjeff @riverside.rider don't forget to come to an agreement about selling a kit without wheels (with/without motors option)to maximise sales to those who got in on the wheel group buy  :slight_smile:

The rough targeted schedule:

* **15th Jan - 1st Mar:** Testing
* **1st Feb - 1st Mar: Preorders** (should everything go well)
* **1st Mar - 1st Apr:** Manufacturing
* **1st Apr:** Shipping

I will also be releasing the prices soon!

Schedule is not set in stone and may move faster depending on the competency of our suppliers (:

I would want one for the spud, one that acts as a [cable riser](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/cable-risers-and-bash-guard-files/20987?u=jc06505n) too would be godly

How much of an extension do you want it to be though? I pushed mine out by 4cm.

I could definitely look into having some made, I have to admit, the current one is rather crude.

My solution will leave 4 nuts on the top :stuck_out_tongue:  

Also, i drilled through the deck to add more screws. Could possibly make some with slots for adjusting different extension lengths. 

If there's enough interest, i'll get to designing a proper one.

I only need just a bit , for me it’s less so for the wheels and more so to create more space between the motor wires and enclosure. If it becomes a cable riser as well, the added space leaves room for the wires to diverse into the enclosure.

# Testing Update #1:

Thought i'll do an update every 100km (Will add pictures and videos in subsequent updates.)

How I'm testing the drive: simply putting the drive through various riding conditions on my current [Challenger Setup.](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/the-challenger-build-thread/81021)

* Hill Climb (31%) - Works as expected. (No slip, DUH!).
* Speed (55kmh) - Works as expected.
* Light AT riding (On Grass) - Works as expected.
* Hard Braking (Downhill) - Works as expected.
* Noise Test - Slightly noisier with a higher pitch than belts, as expected from a gear drive. Am waiting on my cover with a new design to attempt to dampen the noise. It's worth noting that it's already significantly quieter than the Kaly.Nyc 1:4 Spur Gear Drive.
* Efficiency (Range on 12s4p w/80kg rider) - Have not ran the battery flat, estimated 50km at 30 - 40kmh speed on decent terrain)
* Wear & Tear: None at 100km.

Nothing much else as it's only been 100km!

# Other updates:

* I should be releasing the price of the drive come the end of the month, ~~along with launching a shopify site where pre-orders can be made.~~ edit: Shopify is too much of a pain. I'd be conducting the sale of this drive like how i did for my Urethane drive - Google Forms & PayPal.
* Minor design changes to make the installation process slightly easier.
* I have designed a front-facing bashguard and will release the .STL file for it.
* All aluminium components in the drive will be made from T6 Heat Treated 7075 Aluminium, with a Hard Black Anodized finish.
* All plastic compnents (Gear and Adapter) will be made from White/Black POM.
* Every component of the drive will be CNCed. (The hangers and baseplates from Timo may be CNCed as well! Precision everything! Haha.)
* I'm currently thinking of making shorter axles for the gear drive, 10mm shorter on each side, for a more seamless look. (What'd you think?) How it is now is that there is a 20mm ish gap between the gearbox and the wheel. 10mm of that gap is used for a V.Ring, leaving another 10mm exposed. Let me know your thoughts on this! (:

Personally I’d like to see the stock haggy axles stay. I have the drive setup from him and I’d be able to swap over to that setup for thane wheels if I wanted. Plus I like wide:) 
I’m sure others may feel differently though. 
Thanks for the update!

If this drive is installed, urethane wheels would not be an option though. It's only designed for the Bergmeister Rims right now (:

It's worth nothing that the main benefit of a shorter axle is for a seamless design ><.

## \#83 Posted by: Excess Posted at: 2019-01-20T05:43:27.718Z Reads: 265

Yeah. I was referring to swapping between the avio gear drive and the haggy drive with press fit pulleys. I got the drive system from Timo and the press fit pulleys would need the full axle length. 
I’m sure I’m the minority so I would take others input over mine probably. :) 
Thanks

## \#84 Posted by: riverside.rider Posted at: 2019-01-20T05:43:33.918Z Reads: 256

and here my 10 cents: Jeff is correct and the good thing is: the axles are "screw in" and can be easily interchanged, so that would make for a Kahua truck that is very versatile and compatible with many different setups.

You're right, I'll see what I can do. I can easily make the drive compatible to those who already have the axles and are not intending to buy custom ones separately. (Just a change in adapter length), although I wouldn't want to have to deal with 2 different adapter types. If the community would like the length of the axle to remain the same, i'd be more than happy to keep the design as such :smiley:

Thanks for your feedback though, @Excess!

# Cover Design Update:

## Old Design:
![IMG_20190124_185412|666x500](upload://tvbMNuaNTRz0hulAAXBBmY6hORo.jpeg) 

## New Design:
![IMG_20190124_185353|666x500](upload://kcgAn20TYcOBCkhoV2cqR68GOhb.jpeg) 

Redesigned the motor cover slightly due to the following reasons:
1. **Increased Lubricant Retention**
The previous cover design was a simple empty cover to house the gears. The new design incorporates thin ribs to essentially bring the walls of the cover closer towards the gears, resulting in significantly less lubricant flinging to the side of the walls over time. The gears "scoops" up the lubricant on the cover walls and "reuses" it.
2. **Reduced Noise**
(The result from point 1.)
3. **To incorporate bashguard mounting holes**
It was pointed out to me that some people may want to mount the drive in a drop-through set up. As such, 2 M3 holes have been added to the front of the cover for an additional bash-guard to be installed, should you wish to mount it lower towards the ground. This allows for the installation of a rounded bash-guard to deflect objects by sliding around them instead of colliding into them head-on. For those who don't want to install the bash-guard, simply plug the holes with 2xM3 button head screws :smiley:, or not, your choice :P

![image|584x500](upload://76LKNamLeOgMDQwoSfkCZxgc50a.jpeg) 
![image|610x486](upload://oxKRTXz9aL8INX1gfrnqBXfCOAa.jpeg) 
![image|669x431](upload://AhftnYLSlbVSLIgU8KKxTtrWLoJ.jpeg) 
![image|590x500](upload://7lPZywfoAhTl34cnkGVpfCHzp9c.jpeg) 

That's all for now, will update when I'm at the 300km mark of testing. No signs of any wear on the gears so far.

**Things to note:**
* The motor pinion can fit most motors (Haggyboard's new motor, Torqueboards, BKB, Flipsky), basically any motor with an 8mm shaft. You will be required to cut the shaft (with a hacksaw or a dremel) to length though. (It's easy to do!)
* All aluminium parts are made from 7075-T6 aluminium, the same grade of aluminium used in Aircrafts!
* All aluminium parts will be hard anodized in black. Hard anodizing makes it extremely dcratch resistant.

The stock bushings subjected to a wholly scientific finger squeeze would seem to rate at around 88A. Blood orange bushing was a good fit in the hanger but a bit too tall to work, shame as they have inserts which fit into the hanger perfectly 

Pictured is deckside 93A Riptide Krank Canon and roadside the stock shorter bushing.

Hey Alan,
try to flip the hanger, so the the grub screw holes face the street side. That may allow for bigger bushings to be used.

I have swapped out Caliber baseplate kingpins, so if you use caliber plates, you can do so by hammering out the original one and plopping in another one with your desired length.

You cant swap it out on the stock baseplates afaik, they're pressed in really tight.
( i'll try some methods to take mine out and will let you know if I manage to (: )

But as @Linny mentioned, you can definitely change Caliber kingpins (:

Ok conclusion: pretty much impossible to take out the kingpin on the stock baseplates, i suggest using Caliber baseplates if you're after a longer kingpin.

# The 500km Update!

Alright guys, as promised, here's the 500km update!

Firstly, some pics before my comments:

![IMG_20190209_095828|666x500](upload://dvRUmAJl4gtx41jE0Z5SxOZU9JW.jpeg) 

![IMG_20190209_100024|666x500](upload://4Z1FJtqsBmvsses7MWvKiH8NJT0.jpeg) 

![IMG_20190209_100106|666x500](upload://oVCtkwKR8cGsDmkzR8Q4xjx40bz.jpeg) 

![IMG_20190209_101120|690x481](upload://j123isSYaBS093CY5y9DRZwVE4k.jpeg) 

![IMG_20190209_095806|666x500](upload://pTctNSjkHrwfenog6cNgVQhxEYm.jpeg) 

* The gears have virtually 0 wear after 500km (I don't think the grease i'm using is any good, doesnt seem to stick too well to POM gears.. time for molykote g1067, if i can even get my hands on some.)
* The cover (installed at the 300km mark) seems to be doing its job in keeping the gears consistently lubricanted while reducing noise.
* The skidplate (installed at the 400km mark) seems to do it's job in protecting the underside of the drive, there's visible damage to the plate after 100km on various terrain, including some AT. 
* Nothing much else to add really, the drive behaves the same as day 1!

---

# The Pre-order Update!

* Offering a **10% discount** off the total price for people who order a **4WD!** Updated the main thread above accordingly.
* Basically waiting for more preorders to come through so I can send the files to the factory straight after their CNY holiday is over!

# Pre-Order Update

CNY is coming to end and manufacturing can start soon! Hooray! 
* The pre-order form will be kept open for people to place their orders until the parts are to be sent for anodizing (most likely in the first week of march). This will give people more time to make payment too!
* For those who have been PM-ing me about where to pre order, the link can be found in the first post of the thread! Or seperately, for convenience sake, here (Sorry if it wasn't clear before): https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gYr1-n0KrREdRcyXWUtRPM9gcydkQm_xFLcjo0lM4Ak/edit 
* I will try my best to post a weekly update for the benefit of those who pre-ordered, just like how I did for my Urethane Avio Drive. The only difference would be that I will be posting the updates publicly on this thread.

# Design Update:
* Apart from the gear cover design, there have been no need for any further design changes and will be manufactured identical to the drive I am using now.
* I am thinking of designing different adapters for different wheel rims, do let me know whay rims you guys are inerested in! (Note, the rims have to be able to accomodate an 8mm shaft, e.g. Evolve Rims, because the Kahua axle has an 8mm diameter. Is it possible to add a 10mm diameter spacer along the 8mm shaft to transform it to a pseudo 10mm shaft? No clue. Lmk your thoughts, if any!)

Edit: @Linny pointed out that trampa uses a 12mm to 8mm spacer to 'convert' 8mm axles to 12mms to fit their wheels. I'll check it out!

That's all folks!

So my board is already pretty heavy around 30lbs. The handle is a blessing because I almost dropped it before it’s just so unwieldy. 

What is the weight of the whole gear drive system? Compared to the haggy mounts and belts what will be the added weight?

2x motors
2x wheels

Hi Everyone!

Unfortunately there's a hiccup with manufacturing. Long story short, my supplier messed up and are now trying to fix it (by redoing everything), with the time line pushed back by about a week.

Some examples of the screw ups:

* They fked up the hole chamfers by manually chamfering it. (Rejected.)
![Screenshot_20190326_002340|385x500](upload://3nAv8XK63fdxel2rWAwdTcky4Uo.jpeg) 

* They managed to anodize it in the colours I wanted, but left some stains on some parts in the process. (Rejected.)

* Some parts deviated from the specified tolerances by 0.01mm, and were rejected as a result. (Rejected.)

* There were minor milling marks left on the motor covers. (Rejected.)
![machining%20knife%20line|500x500](upload://l5Q041j8jgaVF3x2pO3kfJ6z4b4.jpeg) 

Most flaws are related to aesthetics, but I expect only the highest of quality from my suppliers. 

As such, the new time line has been pushed back by about a week - I will update progress on this thread as frequent as I can. I sincerely apologise for the delay, i hate it as much as you do when things dont go according to plan. ):

For those who pre-ordered, feel free to shoot me a PM with any questions or simply reply to this thread and I'll get back to you asap (even though I'm on vacation now) :stuck_out_tongue:

I'm 20 seconds in, so professional! Why do you guys have huge baby bottle size loctite? lol

Okay doing running commentary. :) Everything's so huge! or you have tiny hands.

The motor mount screws and loctite. On my urethane gear drives, I dry fit the screws without loctite for like the first 4. Then I got cocky and put loctite on without test fitting. Of course, the last screw had some weird partial cross threading and needed unbelievable amounts of force to get in tight. So don't be lazy like me. Test fit the screws before loctite.

I'm assembling these now, nice improvements from urethane drives!

Some things I've noted so far:

- motor screws need to be M4 socket head (not button head) 8mm. 10m goes in too far, slightly touches motor parts in a maytech sealed 6374. Ordered some from [ebay.](https://www.ebay.com/itm/M2-M2-5-M3-M4-M5-M6-M8-Stainless-Steel-Socket-Head-Cap-Screws-DIN-912-Metric/233091084473) 100 pcs lol. I suppose if anyone in the US needs a set for this drive, hit me up.

- the motor seal plate (the thin red piece of aluminum). Referring to the video... The maytechs are have 2 concentric sets of screw holes as usual. If you don't use the seal plate, the inner screw holes are exposed to the innards of the gear drive, so grease can migrate into the motor. I imagine this is the same deal for just about all motors. side note, I have to take like 2mm off the motor shaft on these motors.

- the big bearing into the wheel pulley. If I press it against something flat to seat it (so the bearing is flush with the pulley), there appears to be about a 2mm space between the bearing and the end of the bearing cavity. But if you look at the pulley cavity without the bearing in it, there's a 2mm lip to hold the bearing there. Do not attempt to seat the bearing more deeply. :) This bearing rides on the hanger on the thick section that the motor mount rides on, of which there's only like 2mm sticking out.

It's going together like lego so far. The haggy trucks are really really nice (@riverside.rider). The drive is so big compared to the urethane drive!

2 questions for jeff or others who have assembled.

What KV are you running? 190-200kv seems a bit high for the gear ratio? I'm going to try 170kv, planning on 12s.

@nuttyjeff are you able to do 10mm wheel pulleys? For the maytech 6880 motors? Maybe at a slightly higher gear ratio? Hypothetical question at this point, but the size of the drive makes me think this might be a good move.
```

I'm running 190kv Flipsky 6354s, on 10s. Seems like a sweet spot for me. If you plan to go 12s, 170kv or so is good, gives more torque too.

Well, technically, yeah, but i'm not sure what the demand is on this. Like with all cnc parts it''s pretty expensive to make them in small quantities.

Yeah, i sure did! dual Helicals are cheaper to make, but the company quoted me the same price for both dual helical and herringbone gears, so why not go with herringbone! The reason why it took me so long to get it done was due to the sourcing and searching for a competitively priced manufacturer who was willing enough to take this project up..

They have all the benefits of helical gears, without the issue of axial loads. Ideally, i'm trying to make a silent gear drive, but only real-life testing will tell (:

Woow such a high level content with not so many followers. I hope it's because is a new channel.

Interesting for the gears. well I guess existing gear drive only have to update the 2 gears and they are ready to go. 
Another question I got by looking at the pictures. Why the choice of a steal or aluminium motor pulley and a POM or similar gear for the wheel? Is it to reduce the noise level?

I see it as a common choice, is it to try to reduce the noise or there is more behind it? I start get fascinated by the gear drive system I guess :grin:

I'm going off fuzzy memory, but I think metal on metal gears need to be very precisely made with little/no play. Plastic on metal is more forgiving, especially including wear and trauma. Also quieter and possibly lighter. And at the scale of the wheel gear, plastic is also strong/durable.

POM as a material for gears is surprisingly strong and chemical resistant (which affects lubrication choises). I believe including cost of machining it actually is similar to or more expensive than aluminum.

Thanks @Linny I was so lazy lol. From trampa:

[quote]
Trampa Gears are designed with a 1:6 reduction (more is always better). In general straight cut gears have advantages over helicals, since you can transfer more torque. Helical gears only touch in one sliding point, so contact in between material is limited (therefore less noise). Straight cut gears have contact over the entire width of the gear and there is less pressure on the POM gear material, since the pressure is is distributed over a larger surface area. Racing cars have straight cut gears for a reason… Another thing that needs to be considered: Helicals create a side thrust. The higher the angle, the more silent, the more side thrust, which puts strain on the motor and wheel bearings. Every coin has two sides… To catch the sideway oriented loads we have two extra bearings in our system.
[/quote]

 I was wondering why trampa didn't just use straight cut gears...
```

Since I machine POM I can answer to part of the question. POM is as expensive if not more than aluminium but the machining time is shorter so overall cheaper in large production process.
Plus what you said is right POM and plastic in general is great against wear. Between metal and plasti, surprisely the metal side will wear faster.


The tollerance issue makes sense. Thanks for the input.

Yeah, IIRC, it's because helical gears require you to design for axial loads which require additional design requirements and components (i.e. thrust bearings, transmission casings) in the drive system. These components take up space and increase weight, which isn't ideal when you want the lightest and densest powerhouse in your race car.

Exactly - also there must be a reason why for example Tesla is using helical gears in their model 3

Did the test ride. Whoohoo! Still need to dial stuff in, but plenty of power and torque. The gear noise, wow, unexpected. It sounds like an air raid siren, then I hit about 23mph, and another high pitch noise kicks in like I'm breaking the sound barrier.

I'm at 12s on 6ah graphene lipos with maytech sealed 6374 170KV. Unity HUD says theoretical max speed is 31mph. Too early to judge but I like the torque so far at this ratio. Motors got hot to the touch though. I'm set for 80a battery total, and 70a per motor.

You can all be jealous of @Hummie deck + @bigben doublestack enclosure that let me try this thing with lipos.

Lol I only lost 1 screw today.

Got those bolts in there.  Was actually easier than I imagined but effectively has destroyed the first 20mm of thread.  In like its never coming out though.  I was worried that the pressure of forcing a shoulder through the adapter would strip the whole thread but its fiiiiine!
I'll say it again.  Its a very professional kit and very well manufactured.  Tolerances are spot on.  Its an engineers dream.  Everything just clicks into place.  Brilliant work.  @nuttyjeff @riverside.rider  and @Linny for making me laugh during the video.

If the herringbone gears im designing work as intended, I don't think I'll be making different ratios for the straight-cut gears, but for the herringbone gears.

You could try to find pinions with the following specs:
1. Module 1.5
2. Face width 15mm
3. 8mm bore woth a 3mm keyway
4. For gears 16T and below, you might want to source for gears with an undercut to eliminate gear interference. Else you can also just adjust your backlash in your setup.

Note: If you were to buy a COTS gear, im unsure how a different involute profile will mesh with the profile I use. That being said, such gears aren't expensive (less than 5bucks) and you can probably play around with several pinion types!

So, here we go. The Avio AT Gear Drive Mk2, Stealth Edition, featuring, you guessed it, HERRINGBONE GEARS!. :slight_smile:
 
If you don't want to read the rest of this post, TLDR: they rock. they are so much quieter, easier to assemble, with fewer parts needed. (Read on for more.) Oh, and the gear ratio has been updated to 13:51 i.e. (3.92:1)

First, let's show some pictures. These are taken in a rush, so don't judge me, i was really excited to put the whole thing together.

---
![04|690x345](upload://37fRVBQezjIuMHZRHO4nhcgRTjP.jpeg) 

**Quieter!**

If you can see from the pics, 2 different spur materials were tested, the traditional POM and ALU 7075. People were worried of the strength of POM, so we decided to go for a beefier option. Now, i know what you're thinking, it's gonna be LOUD AF. -> Far from it. It's MUCH quieter than my spur gear design, with a different sound pitch compared to the POM herringbone gears, but probably the same sound level (dB) between the 2. I've yet to measure this and will get back with some quantitative numbers when i'm done with testing.

---

**Easier to assemble!**

Assembly is also made easier. Herringbone gears are inherently self aligning - that means no more Loctite 638 to attach the pinion to the spur! easily swap them out (literally slide the pinion out from the shaft) for different pinions to change the gear ratios quickly! (when we produce them!)

---

**Fewer parts!**

Well, you don't need loctite 638 anymore, plus, the bearing has been changed to a thinner bearing that better adapts onto the Kahua trucks. That means you don't need 2 bearings anymore, a single bearing on the inner part of the truck is all that is required! 

---

**Lighter!**

The gears have also been slightly redesigned to be lighter (The POM version at least) with cutouts, but not affecting strength of the gear.

---

**Stronger!**

Aluminium Spur gears provide an increase in strength while keeping it lighter than the previous design!

---

**Quieter!!**

Did I mention how much quieter it is? I'll upload videos soon, but from initial testing, it's definitely something to be excited about. :D

---

**What now?**

It's not for sale yet and I'll let you guys know when it will be. In the mean time, you can PM me to indicate your interest (:
