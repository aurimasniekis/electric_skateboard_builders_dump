I have always thought the idea of being able to ride anywhere on your electric skateboard was a good one, who doesn't want to choose their own path?

My first attempt at building all terrain eboards was based on standard skate trucks and motors mounted with belts & pulleys... 

here are some of my early prototypes.

This was a product that i started selling in 2014 and it was a huge hit!

I custom CNC'd my own aluminium 5inch rims & pneumatic wheels & made special aluminium wheel pulleys.

This made for some awesome fun... But the problem with belts & motors that are mounted onto the hanger is they get hammered hard! Rocks, dirt, sticks, mud... all stuff that is not great for your drive train. Also the 5 inch wheels were ok for some of the harder stuff but got bogged down fairly easily.... 


So i went back to the drawing board and started working on something a bit more! AWESOME!

Here are my last two VLOGS that feature the All-terrain HUB MOTOR build.

**I will be working on this more over the coming weeks and offering a Complete All-terrain Hub Motor Kit soon.**

Very cool. Looking forward to seeing what you offer. Barely finishing my first build (FULLY hooked on this eSk8 thing) and already thinking about going off road with the next one. I really like the idea of hub motors for this application.

What type of approximate top speed are you getting and how does it perform uphill?
```

## \#8 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2016-03-09T02:23:35.843Z Reads: 605

about 38km/h, surprisingly climbs hills well, motors don't get hot.

4wd hubz would be sweet on that sand...

Now I really want to take a stab at another AT board with it being beach weather 9/12months here in Florida.

So what sort of time frame would we realistically be looking at before you start selling an AT hub motor e-board, Jason? 
3 months? 6 months? 9 months?
```

## \#13 Posted by: onloop Posted at: 2016-03-14T14:02:00.937Z Reads: 554

```
maybe 6 to 9 months... 

I may release the drive train components as a kit... this will potentially speed up the release.

it needs to be refined once or twice before i will sell it.

Do you still sell the original wheels I haven't seen them online for a few months. I am trying to upgrade my board to all terrain. I am going off to college next year and want to ride this to class

Hi,
Where are the hub motors/wheels from?
I'd like to build my own all terrain board.
I've found some wheels on Ali express but don't know if they are any good.
Thanks.

Is there any follow up on this one? All I've heard a while ago that they were discontinued (at least the custom made wheels).. I assume the cost was too high or the interest did not match longboard kits..

Ok, so starting from 2017. Jan, Start giving us updates on the progress ;)

I think there might be more ppl interested in these hub driven mountainboards, than you think ;) 

Ppl in my country already discussing idea about using hub wheels for mountainboard build .. just saying :D

It's 2017 and the dreams of dozens of us concerning the AT Enertion model live on. I'm only guessing here, but I suppose you'll wait with any announcements for the second half of the year not to impair the sales of the Raptor 2, won't you, Jason? ;) But I'm sure to jump on the bandwagon once Enertion's AT's out!

Might be the case, monkey32, might easily be the case. Jason mentioned developing an AT board right after Raptor 2, and I love his concepts so I think I'll be waiting on Enertion's call on that ;)

Hes actually had a prototype running but suspect it all went on hold with R2. I wouldn't hold your breath it will be a long wait. On his vid he never says a date.

Maybe someone can answer these questions about the board in Jasons vlog videos.

Does anybody know where to get these hub motors?
Does any "self balancing board"-motor from alibaba work or would they have a kv rating that is too low? 
And last thing: would it be possible to switch the tyres to some nice brand mountain board tyres?

@Jedi  Thank you, but these have bolts on both sides of the motor and are therefore more fir electric scooters

It says they also have a mono shaft version. 

If you look closely at Jason's AT prototype, the hub motors are mounted to a custom made truck. To make the above motor work, or any other hub motor on that site, some modification to the trucks is most likely necessary.

How does the thing work at low speeds?  I'm thinking that, on poor terrain, you're not going to be zipping along at 38km/h.  What kind of voltage/current/heat/power consumption are you seeing at, say 3mph?
