**The only post you need to read** :wink: UPDATE 02/04/19
https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/paris-caliber2-adjustable-base-plate-the-hammock-base-sick-of-angled-risers-pre-orders-125-for-two/88220/106?u=rey8801






EDIT, moved on top for clarification:

**Price as low I can get it for 10 sets ( 2 base plate) is 120 Euro shipped to EU. 10-15 Euro more for US. Rest of the world need to check but will be similar.**
**Material Aluminium 7075. I will include 3 bolts and nuts for the angle adjustment. Size compatible with the Skate tool, always handy like that :wink:**
**Colour black anodised, but I think we can choose other too. Price should stay.**

Who is interested to get an adjustable base plate truck for Paris and Caliber 2, TB hanger?

Seems already perfect fit for Paris hanger :wink: I will add an extra hole on the base for really extreme angles. Just in case.


Hello, in this period I am rather inspired. As someone probably knows I would like to make a short AT using my MAD Fury DD

The deck is in production, the electronics is here. The only thing I can not get rid off it is the ugly angled raiser...so I thought to make something should have been done before. It's just the first approach but looks ok. I am going to print it to test today nad ask already a quotation for machine it. It is just adjustable base plate. The same other trucks have it, but did not find it for Caliber or Paris. I normalyy used them, Mad Fury is Paris based so why not? Still have to check paris-Caliber compatibility. Except for a slightly different pivot cup I do not see too much difference. I made custom hanger for caliber that fits Paris base plate.

Anyhow it will allow a lot of angle, probably too much :joy:
As usual I made is simple, to be quality, but still feasible to machine it. Final cool aesthetic, but useless :sunglasses: , particulars will be added later. Let me know if you see something weird there. The only thing that the truck would be about 20mm higher but since it is made for AT decks then is actually better. Welcome to the **Hammock Base** :grin:

Need to find caliber truck to test it. I order TB truck but still not here and the other caliber are gone :sweat_smile:

One set is mine... Booked!
Of course more sets better price., but has to be at least double I guess, otherwise for them is the same. 

No angled riser please! Price is really what they ask plus taxes and shipping. It will never be so low again. I need to build :laughing: Of it happens is gonna be fast.
Ciao :wink:

For less stress on the screws, you could do a invert T on the red part, so the vibration are a little more distributed 
But that's just a little thing, I think it will be okay without

Great work, I'm sure with a GB of 10pcs it could happen.

I was looking for SR truck,.. but now thinking about a Mad Rey truck set :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

ahahaha As usual I start from the name The hammock made me laugh so it's perfect. No really at the beginning I stopped my self from do it, but every time I visualised the piece of plastic that I would use as riser and the waste of lines and space I couldn't resist. I hope the price would be right. Although I kept it simple, is still not so easy to machine it. I always make the parts in a way that I could also do it with my tools. In this way should be feasible for companies. Going to test it a bit in the next days. Everything to have a sick short AT board :rofl: I am totally gone...or MADman :sunglasses:

Start printing now! I think it was just time to make something like that. I hope I can get it done thst fits both Paris and caliber since those are the one I used the most. It will hold standard m10 king pin and not the crap pressed king ping thst if you use barrel bushings won't be long enough. I had to drill many trucks to make them fit longer king pin. Included real Paris truck. This will fit whatever lenght since it's interchangeable.

There are maybe about 50sets which would be fairly snapped up on you depending on price. Maybe consider getting a quote on that number as well

Not sure if SR are going to do a thing quickly about a GB.

Oh and have a think if there is any way to engineer in a solution to different ride heights Front/Rear due to disparate angles- that would be an evolution over the SR

I though SR only fits SR hanger. Awesome product but I want to give something good to convert TB truck, caliber, Paris mainly because is what I use :laughing: and I want to give it at a fair price. Now with 10 pairs probably not that easy. 25 pairs for sure way better. 
Keep the same axle height is possible but then degree are limited to like plus minus 7. In my case is not enough. In case of difference in height you will only need to compensate with short risers, few mm compare tp the 30mm I would need without

Yes simple risers solve the height difference

That a original Paris truck. Need to find caliber truck to test it. I order TB truck but still not here and the other caliber are gone :sweat_smile:

Anyhow got the price. If we could get 10 pairs (2 hammock front and rear) I can provide it for 120 Euro shipped in EU and plus 10 euro for US. Ah I went for Alu 7075, stronger than classic Alu for this project. Black anodised. The colours we can choose, as long we agree on a couple of them and not like rainbow pearl with gold reflex :rofl:

One set is mine... Booked!
Of course more sets better price., but has to be at least double I guess, otherwise for them is the same.

Different in hight compare to classic Paris truck. Not a big deal since is for angled tail board, like AT. It will reduce wheel bite. The Hammock is 19mm taller at 50 degree angle. The final model will be few mm shorter. I have found some parts that are slightly taller than need it.

Damn i would of sent you a TB218 for science. If you still need one for any reason let me know. 

Adjustable base plates is the game changer we needed to make sick mtb board conversions like @sender, @mmaner and @Ixf.  

Get an atom or a flame board throw on a set of TB trucks with some thane.... yes...that could work.

I can cover the shipping cost for the hanger if you will to lend me one for testing. Otherwise I will buy a standard caliber truck. Thanks!

Hopefully they will arrive soon, but @torqueboards is really slow on communication. A few days ago I sent them a message and haven't got any reply back. I got no idea whether they have the trucks or if are on the way to them. They have been ordered from the factory though. I will sent them a message later today..

I have a caliber 2 truck laying doing nothing, I'm in switzerland if you want

Also, maybe you could move the screw that hold the angle so the baseplate could fit in a drop through deck or is it way too thick to do that ?

Thanks man. Do you know how much is shipping to Belgium? What you ask can be done not a big problem but need another design where the screws are below the bottom of the the base plate. Like the arch sticks out side. With this design is not possible while keep it simple. Let's do this one first that will cover most of the deck...EVO, AT decks and then if need it I can always make the drop through version of it.

Just a bit of touch to make it sick. Still have to decide between front logo or side one. The logo is a hammock in a minimalist "One Piece style". Once of my favourite manga :grin:

For the kingpin I based on the one I use, I think it's Venom.. 70mm or 2.75 inch long, 9.42mm OD. Bolt size as picture, please check.if you all use another kingpin I will then change it.

Nice, thanks for checking. 23 degree is actually what I need I guess. Then nice I hope this base plate can fit so many hangers.
Then I will make sure that it fits Caliber hanger too and should be fine.

Damn! Kahua looks a really a nice truck

According to the spreadsheet, it looks like caliber <-> paris with a pivot cup swap, not directly compatible. Caliber is directly compatible with nothing (except TB218).

Paris interchanges with Randall R-II.

Yes that for a perfect fit you will need to swap the rubber piot cup, not a big deal. Since if you have caliber truck you porbably have the pivot cup too. Anyhow I made caliber hanger custom truck and they fit paris base plate, I never notice a different. the difference is like 1mm in length of the pivot on the hanger and maybe slighlty bigger diameter but nothing that once compress make a difference. At least to me.

Since the design is mainly square based, then I thought this angled base plate will be sick AF :sunglasses: It will also make the truck lighter.
I hope it doesn't increased the price. (overall angles will be automatic chamfered at 0.5mm from the company that's why not present in the model).

I think the model is ready. I tested with original Paris and Caliber. Therefore should be fine for TB 218 truck. Randal. Probably Haggy Kahua since they are Caliber based. Basicaly the majority of hangers. It will allow to accommodate almost whatever angle. Every steps gives you about 5.5 degree adjustment, pretty good. 
I used Paris pivot cup style (the round one), since needs less high to keep the hammock shorter. Tried 3 different kingpin. Venom, caliber, Khiro. Bushings from Venom, Riptide, Caliber and Paris. 

The base plate with accommodate almost all the skateboards, longboard, AT decks such as MTB and Trampa. 
I would like to have them soon, maybe we can run a small Beta GB. We need 10 sets (1 pair) of truck to make feasible. One is mine. So 9 to go. I will open the Google form and if we are fast we can have them before the end of April :wink: Of everything doesn't change, but should fine, I can do 120 Euro shipped in EU and plus 15 Euro for US. Also rest of the world is possible and would be similar to US I guess. Just don't know by heart.
I hope we can make it happen.

I made a shape in between so It does fit the caliber style pivot but it will stick out few mm since is taller. The reason why I chose a Paris pivot style is because It can host both of the hanger really nice, so I did not see the point to stick to a caliber pivot shape.

EDIT: I test paris hanger to caliber base plate and it fits. If most want caliber pivot style I can make like that, not a big deal.

Had a talk with my friend engineer and showed him the model. He gave me some suggestion and I implemented them. Now the adjustable steps will allow about 2.2 degree correction. I think it's amazing.
After reading a bit I decided to modify the pivot to be caliber style since it can host both the pivot cup styles (@Linny thanks for the suggestion). I will test it tomorrow then I think we are there :wink:

If it's not difficult, I'd recommend a quality of life improvement, a drill holes at the bottom of the pivot cup so that pivot cups aren't suctioned in permanently, like Randals do. Even a small drill holes would allow easier removal of installed pivot cups.

I've used the hole on Randals to push the pivot cup out.

It's not the best way to do it though since it can be tight and not move regardless, but at least you don't have to deal with suction on top of tight pivot cups when removing them.

An alternative to pushing is measuring the height of pivot cups you want to be compatible and ensure they don't sit perfectly flush, instead protruding by 1-2mm to allow grabbing them with pliers to pull them out. 

Also, some hangars don't protrude far from the top of the pivot cup, if not some sit flush on the top rim of the pivot cup. Having a flush pivot can mean hangars grinding on the baseplate when leaning, and that extra 1-2mm of the pivot cup protruding prevents those type of occurances. See pivot and hangar here for example: https://www.tactics.com/a/8gjt/9/randal-r-ii-150mm-50-degree-longboard-trucks-raw-silver.webp

Ok, I think it's time. Sorry for the last 4 days with no updates, but I got a nice suggestion from @Ixf to take into account also the 0 degree for pure AT decks, like Trampa, with already 30 degree on their own. Therefore I started again from scratch, but I have to say, I like it even more now. Here the final features:

- Adjustable base plate from 0 to your imagination (actually even below 0 :grin: ).
- Each step gives you 5 degree, so starting from 0 you have 5,10,15...
- Paris, caliber 2 and TB compatible. Probably it will also fit caliber based hanger such as Kahua Haggy, Randal ecc...
- Pivot cup base on Caliber II, and will accept Riptide caliber, Paris pivot and probably others.
I intentionally left 1-2mm of pivot sticking outside the pivot cup to better support the hanger during turns and help with avoiding the two metal parts to touch each other.
- Material strong Aluminium 7000 series.
- Colour probably matt black with white logo as shown. I din't ask but but probably is possible to get another colour, so in case let me know and we make a pool.
- Holes for new and old school decks
- It will accept standard Kingpin, the one coming with caliber is perfect. If you want to buy one stay on the short side since now the kingpin mounts reverse. The one from caliber is the max length you can use. Since is reverse you use way more of the length so it's plenty to stack fat bushings too. Dual barrel fits perfectly.


**Price**
**125$ for two base plate + shipping.**


I wanted to do it shipping included but then the difference are too big and I would have set a higher price. Some examples:
I am in Belgium
**For EU**. Check your price https://www.dpdwebparcel.be/#/banner
                                          https://www.gls-one.be/nl/parcel/

Most of EU states fluctuate between 7-15 Euro (7.84 - 16.79$). Only few countries like Greece are more expensive, that's why I couldn't set a fixed price.

**For US** 
I asked and should be able to ship the pair for 21.27$ tracked, not bad at all.
This price is probably the **same** for **rest of the world**, but the guy at the post looked a bit nervous after all my questions :laughing:, so didn't dare to ask more.

The form to book your spot. The threshold is 10 sets. One is already taken :laughing:
https://forms.gle/CJw2H79sjXqpFfWn6

Thank you all and I hope we make it happen.


Now the most important part the **Hammock** itself...in is I hope final version this time :grin: (The final version can still change a bit buy overall it's done)

Some pictures at different degree from 0 to 50 degree. The hangers are Paris and caliber.

I took the liberty of making a variation. I will probably get few more sets just in case. Mine will probably be old fashion style. I know I am a bit obsess with raw finish :laughing: 
Ah the number of sets is already ok so I guess around the end of the week I will close the GB and order all the stuffs

if the Alessio Hammock base plate in black works with the Haggy Bergmeister kit, like I think it will... let's just say, I think you'll sell quite a few as angled MTB/street hybrids emerge, like this one:

![image|690x378](upload://zfR1N8mkYK9TnLOvFAsTwLMVptK.jpeg) 

'Haggy in a Hammock' suddenly makes this ^^ tier-1 build accessible to everyone - no goofy Surf Rodz required.

Thanks man. I honestly thought for a while about it and didn't plan it to do it now due to other projects on going, but during simulation of my short AT I was staring those huge angled raisers I would have to use and said fxxk it, let's do it. 
Well as @Riako suggested Kahua is Caliber based so should work. Don't have one to test though but he will try for sure. I got Beigmeister but planning to use them with TB hanger. Probably black hanger to pair it with my DD, but silver Hammock

I see your bergmeister red looks red, which I like it. Just got it today and in my case they are a bit towards pink
![IMG_20190402_114148|690x388](upload://27IujHpZsMXpLgLXKjxvf07UHpn.jpeg)

The Matt black ones are simple gorgeous. Ama colour I am gonna use it for Hammock and MAD Fury DD. Love the black

I am making for the other trucks because there was no one available and everyone has a Paris, caliber, randal, TB taking dust on a shelf :grin:
Not sure is correct to make it for surfroadz, since they have their product. Anyway adjust it for them product won't be difficult, just not sure is correct. In case more need it we can do a small batch to satisfy the need and not hit their market. 
I think the reason why they esitate is because an adjustable base plate cost them 3 time or more than a normal one and they can not charge that much to get the same money out of it. So not a great business for them Risers are dirty cheap instead.

Surf Rodz really nailed the concept.  It is pretty annoying how lackluster they are about getting product out there. But they keep saying they are going to do a run soon and we will have first stab at them.


I am just hoping we can get some confirmation on what baseplates the TB DD fits.  If it fits caliber, I have to get a set of these!

I want to put the TB DD 4x4 90kv on a Kaly deck with Stooge race wheels.  It would help a lot if I could use these instead of having to come up with something one off.

I really like surfrodz products but I have too many trucks be Paris and Caliber that I thought I have to make something for them. Standard TB will fit, I order them but the GB is taking forever...I hoped to have it now for test them but they should be Caliber based.
I think before Surfrodz another brand made adjustable base plate but I can not remember who. Anyhow it's a clever way to accommodate angled decks. It will be my first angled deck otherwise those things would have been out already for a while. Usually I build, always find something I don't like it, then I make it and present it here :grin:

Anyhow I was wondering that if there are enough US order I could ship all of them in one package to someone and then you split them over there. I can ship 5kg for 40$ tracked. each pair is gonna be around  700g they said. so 5 pairs can go together and save a lot. Just an idea. I think your internal post is fast and cheap to use it.

Ah pity. To many different base plate. I tried to go for the most interchangeable one but I don't know the designs of the new ones up coming. If it is not too different maybe I can make an adapter. Or only change the upper part and base plate stays the same. The second option is probably the most realist to do it and do it right.

It's all good. I've been playing w different angles lately. It's so much more convenient when it's adjustable. Surf rodz still hasn't come out w their adjustable plates. I might switch to Paris, calibers or TBs.

With your DD, I can fine tune my setup with these. 

Matt black, if you have any left. Make one for surf rodz!

Yep one set left. It was raw finished but I asked to change it to matt black. They still have to finishing blasting so should be fine. If you take it, then the spare units are officially over :grin: Not really spare at the end :sweat_smile:

For SR I know and I have been asked about it few times. As I said before I do not know if it is correct. They have their own product, so didn't want to affect their market. In the future if they won't provide it anymore or there is a need we can do a small batch just for few in order fulfil the demand. adjust it for SF won't be difficult but I do not have neither the cad or the hanger.

Arrived, thank you, look choice!

Question. The kingpin seems to hold the nut captive in a well, with no way for the bolt to run through it (obviously!), so the kingpin nut instead of being exposed on the roadside of the hanger is inside the mechanism, this brings a couple of questions to mind for when I have a chance to play.

Does this mean bushing choice requires the same bushing as what you have? 
And stacking washers - for thinner bushings
and a longer kingpin for thicker bushing?

If so what bushing are you using there ^ and what washers for perfection? Given that the  bolt can only run through the nut by a mm or 2 it seems a vital thing to get right, bushing squish is a thing.
```

Thank you. 
I suggest to use the same set up as normal. the kingpin is reverse put the mechanism is the same. Just keep tight it down until you get the compression you like it. Of course place a washer between kingpin and bushing. I prefer flat washer road side, but that just me.

I'm thinking, if the kingpin is a bit too long, you can add washers on the side closest to the road to space it out.

Ho my loooooorrd !!! This pic is crazy (you can share it full screen if in landscape mode ? for personnal wallpaper use ^^)

You're not going with a mini GD chrome with it?! or some raw [akhlut](https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/u/akhlut) mount for those Fatboy (230 or 240?) ?
I don't see many other raw finish for caliber style motor mount (maybe APS ?).  
You wan't chain also with the MoeStooge Wheels ? or just the 3dsas superstar ?
But we can definitely make something special for that! Or even share a custom drawing to Matt for you !? (faster maybe)

Some raw and polished exemple or stuff realized (but its all hand made not as perfect ^^):

Figurati di nulla! That's a lot of steps for making a motor mount. Do you know why the water jet cut before CNC? I don't see the problem of making with a CNC only. Or do you mean manual milling?

laser cut was cheaper, then my man adds some modification with the CNC, because, it was my 1st experience, try, and learn of the kind.
