**Features** 

Module 2 Straight Tooth Spur Gear
Precision Milled Gears for production. The wheel gear will house a 6006 bearing and will be made from POM or nylon , have not decided which material is best. And the motor gear will likely be made from Stainless Steel
Options to change gear ratios - 4.4, 4, 3.7
Rotary Encoder - Similar to what Jenso has done :)

Prototypes on the way :) and being tested by a few people

* @mmaner for Surfrodz RKP or TKP
* @Grozniy for Lacroix - designed to replace the Lacroix drive system entirely; a conversion from belt drive to gear drive
* @Andy87 for Trampa   

Designed to fit the following wheels

MBS Rockstar - and other wheels with the same bolt pattern
Trampa Superstar - and other wheels with the same bolt pattern
Sixshooters
Haggy wheels
Moon MK16 Hubs

Designed to fit the following trucks

MBS Matrix II
Trampa Vertigo/Infinity
Surfrodz RKP TKP

Price is not confirmed, definitely a very competitive base price but add ons for people who want the rotary encoder :slight_smile:

At the start it will only be for a select number of trucks:

Surfrodz TKP
Surfrodz RKP 200mm
Trampa Vertigo/Infinity - lowest priority of this list 
MBS Matrix II 

More will be added

This looks like it will be really cool!
Do you think your kit will have a way of using haggy wheels with the matrix 2 trucks?
I‚Äôm guessing not (because of axle size) but figured it couldn‚Äôt hurt to ask.

Finally üôè
I think the fact that you can use one gear drive with different trucks and hubs was missing long time here. No need to spend an arm and a leg if you decide to swap out some components on your board.
Really hope you get the AS5047 Encoder integrated in your gear drive. The encoder seems to bring a lot more control over start up traction. Next level üòú and should be standard for all e-mtb in my opinion. Unfortunately I see it way too less used here.

Is this going to be targeted towards mountain use or on/off use?
4.4 gear ratio is too tall for 200mm tyres if you have proper hills, especially off road.

I think it also depends on your motor kV.
130-150kV with 4.4 gearing should bring you already pretty good torque.

one massive one and a smaller one

I‚Äòll let you know how it works on dual with 170kV and 8‚Äú. If that works well 130kV and 9‚Äú should be fine too.

I think a lot depends on the terrain you will drive at. Like @taz said in his area a 1:4.4 will probably be not enough. For my area it‚Äôs probably more than enough and I like the extra speed I can get with it.
For 8‚Äú (180mm) and 170kV that would be geared to 52km/h which seems a pretty sweet spot for me.

We have a completely different definition of hills.

https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/trampa-mountain-board-buy-or-build/72702/23?u=taz

These are medium hills I have to tackle during my commute. Going off road means hills twice as steep.
Simply put a 3:1 gearing ratio with 200mm wheels can't go up these hills especially in the summer.

And maybe I'm completly wrong about min/max teeth number for ATB, subject to correction on this -

Gear Drive/Spurs in use currently by other makers for bigger wheel drives(ie 8‚Äù wheel+ ATB)

**Moon**
10T motor gear
44T Wheel gear

**Kaly**
10T motor pulley
40T Wheel pulley

**Etoxx**
Mini Helical Gearbox is 10/40 for 8 and 10mm Motorshaft
OR 8/40 for 8 mm Motorshaft

Maxi Helical Gearbox is 10/50 for 8 and 10 and 12mm Motorshaft
OR 8/50 for 8mm Motorshaft

**Trampa**
10 Tooth HELICAL Motor Pulley
58 Tooth Helical Slave Pulley

I have a hill in the park nearby that is so steep, they made it a one way going down because:
1) you can't see people coming up its so steep

Crazy to go down. There's a turn at the bottom that if you miss, you're going into the lake.

Unfortunately we don‚Äôt have so much choice if it comes to 80xxx motors and all have there downsides.
APS - quality I not constant 
Leopard - expensive and only 8072
Maytech - low amp rating (max 80a)
Chinese nonames - you never know what you get and no CS if something goes wrong.

So in fact APS is not s bad choice in this case.
The price is good and as min they have a customer service, so if your motor fucks up you get a replacement.

@moon what you think how much the gear drive will get more heavy by changing the printed part to a full cnc?

Maybe 200 grams total.

Actually I can't say. The carbon fiber plate was so light that a 3d printed case would weigh maybe more

Yeah maybe a group buy. Thinking of a small beta test first.

And that would be open to the public, the current testers are friends :)

I‚Äôll definitely be down to buy into a public beta if it happens. I love this idea and I have all the trucks except TKP and all the wheels except moon and shooters. 
Love the idea of mixing and matching all different setups. Super glad you‚Äôre making this moon.

The grease kills the pitch whine almost completely. They will never be as quiet as belts, but that's the trade off for massive torque and less maintenance.

I think the archoil is likely better, but I got 14 oz of Mobilgrease 28 for the almost the same same price as 0.5 oz of Archoil 8300.

Mobil 28 = $21.87 with free shipping

Archoil AR8300 Sever Duty = $16.95 plus shipping

I think 14 Oz is good for 5 drives, once belts are forgotten about and gear drives are on every single board I'm sure some grease nerd will find something good for us

Alternatively I can find some good stuff in europe for the same price and it's 1kg
