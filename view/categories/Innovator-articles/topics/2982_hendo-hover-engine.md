I backed the Hendo Hoverboard Kickstarter about a year ago and they finally sent out the first few "whiteboxes" last week and I got mine. It's just one of thier "hover engines" in a box that can hover over a sheet of metal. 

It sounds kind of boring but it's actually pretty freaking cool in person! Could be the very distant future of e skates (a wheel-free future??) 

Just thought this group might get a kick out of this thing...
