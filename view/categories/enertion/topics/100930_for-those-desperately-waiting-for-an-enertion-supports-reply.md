Hello Enertion team, since I can't in touch with you via support tickets, let's try this way.

**I sent a request for a refund and still waiting for an answer.** And for god's sake I won't pay 20% (~300â‚¬) cancellation fees to a company which have backlog orders, on an item that didn't arrive at the expected time (wanted to ride it this summer,but that slept through the cracks) this is just a nonsense.


**For customers that can't contact them either**, just do like I did, **contact ACCC** (Australian Competition & Consumer Comission). 
Their website is available here https://www.accc.gov.au/.

I advise you to make a consumer complaint explaining them the ridiculous situation you find yourself in. I'm pretty sure ACCC can also help us with the 20% cancellation fee. Here the webpage to file a complaint https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/complaints-problems/make-a-consumer-complaint.

I guess that if they have enough requests they'll end up contacting Enertion. This company is just freewheeling, taking our money hostage, let's make them meet their obligations.

Bet this post will be removed soon, at best I'll be contacted by Enertion to remove it, it will be an opportunity to discuss my refund. This situation is just crazy.

**Courage to you all, the common effort will prevail.**

I ordered on february this year, wanted to ride this summer with some friends, summer has gone now, and so did my friends. 
So I just would like to have a refund, which I have already kindly asked multiple times. 1500â‚¬ is not nothing for me, I can't left it in the wild like this.

I know it's Enertion forum thanks, that's why I post here, trying to have an answer.

EDIT: Thanks for the link anyways :slight_smile:

I have a really basic credit card, without included insurances etc.. I'll call them tomorrow if still no answer from Enertion but I think they won't do anything.
Still worth to give it a try i guess

 @venom121212 You'd have the same problem as the refunds for unities. 110% is just words like all the other promises. I bet you they might even charge the restock fee of 20% on top of it. 
1800usd x500= 900k/
900k refund= 990k/
990k restock fee= 792k refund/
So you'd be giving them an extra 108k usd to play with.
I might be mistaken but I doubt you want to try tk prove me wrong by testing it ðŸ˜‚

Iâ€™d definately be cutting my world tour short to fix my companies issues itâ€™s getting pretty rabid on the socials not just the forum. At this rate I feel like if I ever get my unity itâ€™ll be a miracle. didnâ€™t drunk Jason say in England over a month ago in 4 weeks (that date was 7 days ago) theyâ€™ll be in Stock on amazon US? Haha what a joke ðŸ˜¢

Ofcourse it is. Imagine if they were to give real honest personal responses to each of the hundreds of angry clients ðŸ˜‚ I doubt employees are paid well enough to put that kind of effort for someone else's company failures ðŸ˜‰

I was tempted to buy FOCBOX, but once I read all horror stories on this forum I realized that Enertion controllers name was misspelled. It should be FUCKBOX. :imp:
I just don't get why people still placing orders with them. Maybe because they have a nice website (lipstick)?:roll_eyes:

Because the unity is a solid device at a great price point. The company is just a cock salad of a mess and can't seem to get supply and delivery down. Or honesty apparently. I wish everyone could have a unity on time that ordered one. It's unbelievable the waits some people have had and are still having.

There biggest issue is there lack of response on tickets. This can sometimes take days. My unity has been broken for over a month, and the biggest reason I believe it's not yet fixed is that they take on average 2 days to respond to a message of me. Now halfway, so I'm expecting a response in about 24 hours. Why the hell is Jason still traveling around the world when his company is going down in flames?

I do believe @CarlCollins is doing not much wrong. He has too much work for what he can handle. When he responds he is very helpful. The blame here is solely on Jason and the rest of the staff here.

Any news about refound? 
I have buy a raptor 2.1 the 30 may 2019.
When i buy this eboard the seller reassured me that the material would be shipped in 4-6 weeks.
now more than 7 months have passed and I have no news, I receive an answer, from enertion.

this table is for my girlfriend and now she hates me because I convinced her to buy it :smile: 
I will ask for a full refund and as soon as I receive it, I will buy a table from another brand, or I will build one by myself.

I don't know how you paid for it, but if you can do a chargeback, start the process immediately. Enertion is all but dead and you will not be getting that board.

So sorry, brother.

[/quote]

Actually, not the case. The biggest problem is the wheel urethane, because the excessive heat the hub motors produce cooks the urethane. If you sign up on the other forum, I'll link you to the graveyard where guys are trying to solve the wheel problem.

But if you can get your money out, please do it. Don't fall in love with flawed technologies and failing companies.

thanks friend. what other forum? I would gladly watch it.
In my opinion they are looking in the wrong place. the concept of cooling is simply wrong. it is not by inserting a straw full of h2o that an object cools down. especially if held horizontal. or run the water or it serves no purpose.
Remove the straw that is better. the engine takes longer to warm up but once it reaches the temperature it can no longer dissipate it.
For 20 years I have designed systems that are much more complex than these, having problems is normal but getting lost behind bullshit doesn't make sense.
While I waited, however, I built a faster skateboard (more than raptor 2.0), with 36Amp / h battery, at 50 volts and that does not warm up like the raptor. It cost me a lot of free time, since it was just fun for me. Maybe soon I will post the photos if it can interest you.

Anyway, I contacted ACCC just yesterday and I'm waiting for their communication.
Thanks again ;)

link? :slight_smile:

when I'm ready for sure. For now I can only say that it works very well. unfortunately, however, I'm waiting for a unit compatible with bldc mode. the focbox is not compatible and I don't want to use it. also I measured the current and the focbox does a little what it wants and does not satisfy me.

give me a little more time. but... the link of the other forum? :)
