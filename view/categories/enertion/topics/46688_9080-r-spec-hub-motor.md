Can somebody clear up what is the total output in watts is the Raptor 2? Can't find  anything on Enertion website. Couple of reviews on ESK8 reported 2x 3360 watts. Support at Enertion state only 2200?

Well the Focbox is rated to 60amps and the max voltage is 42v at full charge so 60*42 is 2520 watts at full pull per motor

That’s more so a peak number.

If seen people pull 90-100amps on focbox but I feel you need a bigger  heatsink.

Yea it’s possible that the peak could be well over that but I’m trying to get real world numbers that are useful to everyday people. Peak numbers are misleading

wouldn't it be the motor amps x voltage for peak power?
