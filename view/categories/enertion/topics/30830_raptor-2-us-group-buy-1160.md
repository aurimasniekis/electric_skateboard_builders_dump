Well....  The first Raptor 2's were originally supposed to ship in May.  From what I've gathered, they have shipped 15 of the first 500 sold.  And they are currently only at 1/5 of their production capability

So.... 2019?

That's a great price but not knowing actual delivery date kills it for me. 

I would be in if they were in stock now.

Are all these boards shipped to one location or will they be shipped to the individual buyers for $1160. Is there tax or shipping in top of that price or is it all inclusive?

Thanks

$1163 is the total cost (tax and shipping included) shipped anywhere in the US. Boards will be shipped to individual addresses. Total cost to ship to Canada is $1239.
