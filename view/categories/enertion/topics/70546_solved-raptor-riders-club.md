**RAPTOR RIDERS CLUB TEMPORARY HOME**


Hi guys. 

As some of you may now the electric-skateboard.club website has been gone for the past week. It was mainly a raptor 2 owner's website where we shared our experience, board issues, frustration, and had direct communication with @CarlCollins @barajabali and others. 

In the comments of this [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BoqJpOKgh8w/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=164dhu3626j00), enertion is letting us now that they _could_ get the website back up but they're not doing it (as of now). The reasons are unknown but my guess is because they're thinking: no website, no complains. When it's actually quite the opposite. 

So for now, we're hosting temporarily the "Raptor Riders Club" here until the website is back up. You don't silence an entire community that is helpful to each other just for "reasons". 

Because of that "Club" thread, I'm sure tons of of accidents and worse have been avoided thanks to the help of other riders letting us now various issues and how to deal with them on the Raptor 2. 
@CarlCollins and @barajabali have helped us times and times again with our issues, with our frustrations over a year and a half of delays, and I believe enertion would be in a worse place image wise if it wasn't for those two, paying attention to all our issues and complaints in the most professional manner, on this forum.

It was also filled with important resources about said issues, accessories, replacement screws, riding tips, maintenance, and much more.

I felt something fishy was going on too. I really hope they are not doing this on purpose. It would be really messed up. But seeing the other part of the website up seems weird.

They are not putting it back up, when they could. So it's on purpose.

Apologies guys for the ESK8 club down.
I am trying my best to collect as much information as I can on this one.
I will keep you guys updated if ESK8 Club is ever going to be back online

A lot of valueble content had dissapeared.

* Safety checklists by community members for the Raptor 2
* Official statements about warranty handling by Enertion support (for example: they stated that if a warranty replacement or repair takes over 2-4 weeks your warranty period will be extended. They won't do this for you without pointing them to the official statement they made.)
* Official statements about water ingress and warranty
* Documented faults of Raptor 2's (broken axle's, failing motors etc etc.)
* Tons and tons of tips about safety, maintenance etc.
* Tons and tons of tips about accessories 
* This list goes on and on and on ofcours
* We were/are a community

I get that the forums were filled with complaints... but for good reason. 

I feel muted and censored. 

This is NOT ok

Thanks Carl. But let your management know that shutting down a community that has helped each other going through what Enertion put us through is not ok if thatâ€™s whatâ€™s happening. Hope you guys solve this issue fast. If it wasnâ€™t for that community my order would be long gone. 
If you read past the angry post ( which I truly believe Enertion deserves) you have quite a team of fans out there ready to praise the performance of the board and that did so on many occasions. Complaining about the lack of competence and quality of the boards are just byproducts of Enertion â€˜s lazy management.

@CarlCollins Thanks for you guys to stick with us and our anger on the forum. Know that deep down your help is truly appreciated.

@ajelex
I can understand! I am sure there is something else which held the forum down. Maybe a Cyber attack or something.
I'll let you know once I get any related and useful information about it.

There is problem with billing, it's down because of the that reason alone.

We need to discuss with hosting provider and see if it can be revived as it was.

Once we know the options we will discuss it internally then act.

You clearly said you were thinking of not putting it back up. You said yourself your role with enertion doesn't impact those .builder and .club forums. And yet right now you are dealing with that website under the Enertion banner. Carl also confirmed you own the website as an independent, not as Enertion.

So as an independent you have absolutely no reason to not put the website back up, unless you don't want to pay for hosting/domain anymore and if that's the case **I'm happy to take care of those payments, without administrative position of those websites, because again, they belong to the community.**

Will you please stop considering closing the website for good and just leave it back up as it should be? Thank you.

Agree and a comment from @onloop is really needed here. Everything you or Enertion said on this particular issue is inconsistent.

Just glad we have some communication going on with Enertion at this point. But knowing all of the issues and the necessity of this forum, itâ€™s a bit outta touch to only acknowledge it now isnâ€™t it?

Yes, @SeanHacker, one of your early customers that trusted you from the very beginning with a large amount of money and only had broken boards to this day. He also brought a lot of issues to light that helped you and enertion be more communicative about those issues and fix them. 

Because of him I know for a fact that my Raptor that I'm waiting since a year and 7 month will be a better product than the one he owns. Yes he's rough with his words but that's no way to talk to him.

Sean, frankly speaking, I don't want to talk to you via the forums because historically it's not constructive. 

I do understand you are upset, you have made it very clear to everyone.

My advice is to E-mail support@enertionboards.com and allow a certified repair agent to fix the board for you.

No hard feelings.

Youâ€™re right and I donâ€™t think you should be here answering every post.
What I hope you understand is that leaving us in the dark all the time only make it worst and may fuel the kind of mindset you can see people in.
Iâ€™ve been mostly ok waiting for the board. The pain is the inconsistencies in everything that is said or done. And the way it is done. This is what drives me nuts.
 
Sometimes you just want to know the status of your board and you have to dig between the chat, the forum, YouTube, Reddit and the production page to put together some Â« official news Â». 
And then the forum shuts down and what could have been a minor incident if the company acknowledged it straight away and started working on a fix. We are back at creating an other thread hoping for some news.

I think that the production issues are one thing but your clients have the right to be in the clear and that in the easiest way. I donâ€™t think you can not have a production update regularly just because you donâ€™t have much news the same way I think the thread has been essential with everything happening with Raptor 2 so far and I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a thing to take lightly . And I donâ€™t think itâ€™s ok that someone within your company says that it might be taken down without any notice.

Other than that you are building a new a innovative product and that takes time and a lot of failure I guess. You really are a company changing the game in this space but you are not going to become one of the great if you keep acting his way with you customers.

Other than that I wish you good luck on your journey and I canâ€™t wait to ride the beast.

Hm, I'd be surprised if the cost of hosting a forum like that could be of any significance to be even worth debating, even for Godaddy's well known despicable practices. Unless you were dealing with some dodgy reseller? Even so how much could they possibly be asking, really!

It's your right of course to treat this as an internal matter but know that this is a strong community and there are people with the know-how and the resources to help, both bring the forum back up if you have access to the data or a recent backup, or provide any sort of advice (technical or legal).

If it's purely a billing issue and not settling will mean you can't restore the forum elsewhere, but you are thinking of not settling it regardless, I guess that implies someone is trying to extort an amount of money that you consider unreasonable before they give you access to your data?

In any case, I for one volunteer to advice/guide someone from your team how to set everything up directly to a reputable provider like google, amazon, online.net, hetzner, ovh, etc, in a way that you don't have to rely on any individual or find yourselves without a recent copy of related data necessary to bring it up back straight away ever again. Same sort of thing that you should have in place for this forum as well.

These two forums is one of the things that make Enertion different, don't give up on it Jason. To many it will rightfully feel like you're severing your ties with the community.

PS. It's not just Godaddy snatching an expired domain and trying to oversell it right? Because... nobody really cares about the domain, just get a new one!

Hi!

Domain is still registered to Jason Potter at godaddy, no updates since registration date on 2017-06-22T01:35:24Z

That means hosting issues (software and data possibly stored in cloud)

We know it's an unpaid domain issue that closed the website. The problem though is that they won't put it back on, again, as indicated by Jason's comment that he's thinking of closing it for good.

Hey guys! I can't believe it - my tracking info also just updated! Arrival end of day ~tomorrow (11/12th of October)!

Just one note: We will easily be able to see if these boards are from the old or the new batch. 
If anyone receives their board and the hub motors are not chrome/metal coloured, please report here. In any case, we should closely inspect our boards. Better notice a major issue before the maiden voyage :slight_smile:

I just got my Raptor 2 yesterday....this thing is a beast!

I am having an issue with the bluetooth though. When I turn the board on and scan for it on Metr and the other VESC status app, it won't find the board.

I also did a regular bluetooth scan and it wasn't finding the board at all.

Anyone else run into this or am I missing an important step to connect my bluetooth!?

I hit up support and all they said was "take the enclosure off and send us a picture of the electronics"

So I'll be doing that today. Just didn't know if I was missing something stupid there.
