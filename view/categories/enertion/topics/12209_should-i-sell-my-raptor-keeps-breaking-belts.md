I'll start by stating that I am incredibly frustrated right now since I just kicked this thing 4 miles to get home...

Today was probably my fifth ride ever on my Dual Raptor. Both belts broke. One snapped off and the other had all its teeth completely worn down, leaving me stranded. This was the first ride since replacing another broken belt, making 3 broken belts in only 2 rides. 

It's 50° F where I am and there are tiny rocks everywhere. I don't think those two factors are unique at all to where I am, but perhaps this is vastly different to the environment that Enertion is testing these things in. I have tiny rocks in the gears after every ride. I actually pull over every 15 minutes or so and pop out little rocks with my car keys, that's how easily it happens. 

I own a Yuneec E-GO that i've ridden about 50 miles a week for the past 2 years or so. It's on the original belt. The only issue I had with that board was the ECU (brain part) start to come loose on the board and they replaced it for free. The E-GO has a plastic cover that protects the gears and belt from rocks entering. 

I've ridden the E-GO all over the USA, from NYC to San Diego, from 40°-100°F...never an issues besides the small one I mentioned. 

The wheels and pulleys on my Raptor are all slightly off-balance, so the belt tension fluctuates throughout the wheels' revolution. Everything is aligned and tightened to what I believe is the best tolerances physically possible, I don't think the issue has to do with belt tension, alignment, or any other user related issue. I inspected everything after the belts failed again and nothing has moved.

I'm considering TWO options:

1. Sell the board and get/build a dual hub motor. No more issues with belts, would give me a lower center of balance that I'm missing, higher top speed and less torque which I'd be happy with.

2. Get new wheels/gears from Enertion to fix the belt tension issue, build a shroud to prevent rocks from getting in the gears (not sure how I'd do this by myself), buy belts in bulk and take them and tools along with me on every ride??

Curious what everyone's thoughts are since you are likely much more calm and level headed than me right now ;)

Brilliant. 

Boosted, Evolve, Yuneec, and probably others, all have covers for the belts/gears.

Are you sure you are not riding the belts too tight or loose? If realignment is the issue, make sure the belt is not rubbing on the sides of the motor pulley. Try realigning your wheel pulleys since they can be a tad off sometimes.

I'm not 100% positive because I don't have anything to compare to aside from my Yuneec E-GO. 

There's usually enough slack so when you push on the belt, it moves about ~1/4"-1/2". I assumed it was too tight after the first one broke and read on the forum another member saying they like to keep their belts kinda loose. When the 2 belts broke today, I'd say it was on the loose side, but I would not have thought it was too loose or loose enough for either one to lose grip with the gears.

Another option, if you were happy with the deck / battery / VESCS, would be to sell the back trucks / drive train / wheels and buy a dual hub truck set up to swap out with. But since you dislike the height of the board you may be better off selling it as a unit and building something that suits you exact situation. 

I've ridden by raptor maybe 7 times for a total of ~50 ish miles and have only gotten a single rock in my pulleys. I think your situation with those tiny rocks may be a little more unique than you think. Would be interested to see how often other raptor owners break belts. I carry a few backups and skate tools in my backpack incase of a situation like yours. In the end you are probably better with hubs, or with the printed covers to the drive train system.

There's a few reasons why I like hubs better than belt drive systems. Most importantly, no alignment/belt tensioning issues, no belts to break, and you can get lower to the ground (you can get lower to the ground with belt drives, but you have to put them in the back like evolve does, which I don't think is a good solution). With my current board, I am the same height off the ground with reverse recession as I would be with the non-electric version of this deck.

Hubs have their drawbacks too, such as higher amp draw for the same torque and intern, higher temps. But I think the benefits outweigh the costs, and we will see more hubs in the future on completes, as they are more user friendly and less problematic once the engineering kicks are worked out of course.

I would recommend you try to fix the alignment/tension, since you already have a board, but if you can't, sell it and build a hub motor board. the carvon v3 and hummies new 3x the stator motor should both be really solid hub motors that will be coming out in the not too distant future.

If these go thru, you can get a pair of wider caliber style trucks and run wider belts. I was sooo close to buying a raptor dual, I still want one actually. The 9mm belts is what made me not want to get it quite yet. If these come out, a raptor with dual 15mm belts would be bad ass, not to mention to wider stance.

If its not a tension / alignment issue then its most likely tbe small rocks thats the problem. Especially if your saying you have to keep getting the, out of the cogs. I rarely have had any issues with the belts. It is unusual your riding environment. I ride on roads paths, theres crap everywhere and no real issues.

A cover maybe an option, but it would need to be custom, but it may exasperate the issue and trap the small rocks in it and be harder to get out.

Bring more belts and tools, it just could be bad luck.

I think the issue with wider belts is its harder to do for dual det up. The trucks would need more modding and the space between the motors may become too close. Be ok for single drive set up suspect.

I would return it if you don't like it rather than getting less than it's worth if you want to go down that route. My belts have held up just fine personally, so it very well could be an alignment issue. I also recommend pushing first then activating the motors to prevent strain on everything. That could be what's breaking the belts?

Here are some pics of the alignment and a video (coming soon, bad connection right now) showing how the tension in the belts fluctuates as the wheel turns (from pretty loose to pretty tight). You can also get an idea of how rocky it is where I'm located - it's unavoidable. The front trucks don't have a single chip on them, whereas all the rear components look like I took a sand blaster to 'em...<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/7/6/76a7058cb45e6453928435f92b5ba970449ea48a.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/2/3/23e0359ce35dbeeb4d8ac79e9674d73fdc8c1790.jpg" width="666" height="500"><img src="/uploads/db1493/original/3X/a/a/aa90d4840abf00da30a7ce9f773905a6ba2feb8a.jpg" width="666" height="500">

```
Dual diagonal makes sense for braking purposes and weight distribution, but I feel like more companies would do this if it were really optimal. Or maybe they just don't do it because whether you ride regular or goofy, it would make a pretty big difference in usability for a diagonal setup. Running the wires all the way from the rear to the front motor was another concern of mine for that setup, probably not a big deal but usually the less wire the better.

Is the belt alignment default from the day it arrived? I had that same issue with belt breaking every few rides and what not, had to move the MOTOR mount (clamp) instead and after that everything went smoothly. This is one of the issues with Enertion, the way they set up the mount is not perfect so you have to do your own diligence to perfect it. You should probably think about upgrading those wheels to 97mm if the road for your commute is rough.

I took it apart to paint the trucks black. Issues with breaking belts started after I put it back together. 

The board already feels and looks so high off the ground with the two risers, I can't imagine raising it further with 97mm wheels :/

this is precisely why your belts are breaking, you need to disassemble the wheels & reseat the drive pulley. Basically pull the pulley out, clean up the area to ensure there is no debris & re-insert it flush. Make sure you torque the down the axle nut appropriately so there is no slop for the pulley to dislodge from the seated position.

during the tear down It might be worth eyeing the pulley to make sure it is not damaged, or warped permanently...  if you have a damaged pulley we suggest replacing it. Have plenty in stock and happy to ship them out is this is the fault, need photos.

Maybe there's your answer. As suggested by @onloop when you have time, you should probably reassemble everything. It's probably a longshot, from your pictures it looks like your motor mount might be too close to the wheels. One of the screws on the mount might be impinging on the belt, probably a safe bet to leave a bit of gap between the motor mount and wheel pulley. 

The meaty risers are great for 97mm Flywheels! It made a hell of a difference for me when I decided to switch, never looked back since. There's no debris on the road that I'm worried about anymore, don't even need to avoid cracks and small potholes. You should take a look at it.

On enertion.com, when looking at the "parts and pulleys" page, the drive pulley is labeled as "drive hub" and the motor pulley is labeled as "motor pulley". That's how I tried to learn which part was the "pulley" when your customer support gave me the same suggestion. Now I realize that a pulley is just a gear and the two parts are refereed to as "drive pulley" and "motor pulley". I was confused until now. 

Your answer was exactly what Ossama was asking me to try via email. I did not understand and thought I had to "remove the wheel..." in order to remove the belt and get access to the "pulley", which I understood to always mean "motor pulley" at the time. Luckily, I didn't have a way of removing the pin securing the motor pulley, so I gave up. 

When I disassembled the trucks in order to paint them, I never removed or made adjustments to any of the pulleys. But who knows. Now that I realize we're talking about the wheel pulley, I'll give it a shot and inspect like you and Ossama said!

Gave you a lengthy explanation just now so perhaps you could reword the website (very low priority, I get it) or create a more detailed canned email response (not that the email was canned by any means) to help your future customers who may be as new to the terms as myself.

getting perfect alignment of the motor mount is very important, once you know how to do it is easy.... I would suggest double checking you have the alignment perfect.

when you spin the wheels with your hand you will better see the belt alignment (or lack of) the belt shouldn't rub on anything.

Actually, i thought to just try spinning the wheel when the belt's not on to see if it wobbles and it does, a lot. On to whacking out the wheel bearings to reset the wheel pulleys...

Guess you don't have to knock out the bearings to get the wheel pulleys off...

The problem is the wheel pulleys. I mounted them without the wheels to the trucks and spun them and both wheel pulleys wobble a lot. Cleaned up the wheels and reconnected the wheel pulleys to them. Put back on axle without belts, tightened up, spun, and still lots of wobble. 

It's definitely the wheel pulleys that are not true, causing the belts to fluctuate tension. This might explain why sometimes a belt snaps (too much tension) and sometimes slips (not enough tension). 

I'll email support.

I am not sure that emailing us will help this process. They are only going to say what i have said already.

So, give it a go, Just remove the pulley & try to reseat it, take photos when it's off, it will help me diagnose if there is faulty part.

There is a small chance the pulley is molded wrong, if that's the case it gets replaced. However, you also said it only started snapping belts after you made changes, so it might just be a matter of reseating it. I would nearly class this as maintenance related. like a wheel alignment on your car.

I am confident this matter can be resolved very easily.

Figured you'd want all support issues to go through email and not this forum. That said, it's the wheel pulleys. Both are not true and wobble when you spin them without the wheel. I can post a video if you'd like once I get a better internet connection.

I believe my belts are breaking for two reasons:

1. The **wheel pulleys are not true**. This is causing the belts to fluctuate between too loose and too tight with each revolution, making it basically impossible to set the tension right.

2. There are a **shit ton of rocks** in Wyoming. Tiny rocks are getting stuck in both my wheel and motor pulleys. This is obviously going to wear down the belts and make them weak, allowing them to break or strip down much sooner than they should. 

Solution should be **new wheel pulleys and a cover around the belts to prevent rocks from entering.** I'm assuming the wheel pulley imperfection is a manufacturing mistake. The rocks are my fault...well, Wyoming's fault! I know to avoid rough roads and rocks, but even a "smooth" road here would be considered rocky by most standards. I didn't realize how rocky it was here until some members pointed out that it's very unusual for rocks to get stuck in the pulleys; I get a rock stuck every 10-15 minutes of riding! Rock guards should take are of that! 

$40 worth of plastic and I hopefully won't have to worry about breaking any more belts, unless of course I'm abusing this thing, which I don't :)

I had 3 snapped 9mm belts in 3 weeks, then I changed to 12mm drive system. Rocks still kept coming in every single trip, had to check the pulley and belt EVERYTIME (t-tool, wrench also spare belts are in my backpack all the time). My pulleys are wearing out by rocks, branches, glasses and even small fruits from tree. One 12mm belt broke in 20k since I bought them.

Really kinda need a protect shell for enertion's motor system....

Difficult to say exactly of course but it would seem from the video that the wheel gear inserts have been badly. 3D printed and are not running true. Either new ones from Enertion or get a set printed, there are files on this site somewhere for the 3D wheel gears. Getting a set 3D printed is pretty cheap so worth a shot.

Send video to Enertion support and they will send you new pulleys ASAP. 

As for the Rocks theres not much you can do there,  but try covers if you can get one made for the Raptor. 

For sure you are riding in peppered rocky ares.  Hate those little rocks and your motors are all dinted now.

I watched the video & im Happy to replace them. Just fix me up with the postage http://www.enertionboards.com/how-to-build-eboard/postage-charge/

However I couldn't really see a major deformity there. Maybe a slight wobble but it could happen as the bearing might me slightly out of alignment, same can happen with a wheel if it only had one bearing. Also you mention the fault occurred after you removed the parts to respray the hanger? There is a chance the bearing needs to be reseated.

Anyway. I'll send you some extra belts too. Just write a note saying what you need.

Sorry, my mistake then. Though strictly speaking, 3D printing is a form on injection molding, just without the form.
And before the flaming starts that was 'tongue in cheek.'
Did want to point out though that it is a cheap and easy way to test something. I got two wheel gears knocked up for my dual and I must say they run perfectly true as the fit into the wheel is perfect. I was pleasantly surprised how good they are and how they are holding up.
Obviously if you are going to replace them the OP has no need to try.

While I'm fairly certain having imbalanced wheel pulleys was adding to the reason I was breaking belts, I'd like to wrap up this thread:

**I'm confident that the absurd amount of tiny rocks where I live are what were breaking my belts.** I believe this was only accentuated by the imbalanced wheel pulleys. A belt cover or smoother roads would fix the issue. 

Thanks for all the feedback, people! Love this board :)

I usually get a rock stuck in the pulley every 1-2 rides. I just check after every ride and pry out any rocks stuck in the pulley. Can't say they've broken my belts though. Though I have broken 2 belts so far.

Same here with my rig. Little Rocks every few ride stuck up in the teeth like little pieces of corn.  I'd also like to add that the video showing the wheel pulleys looks like what I eperienced on my Enertion pulley. Try reseating them by loading them onto to the wheel and gently leaning on the wheel when in situ on the truck. It seemed to straighten mine back into place.

I hit tons of gravel when I ride too. Real killer for me has been new asphalt since it's so sticky, it gets right in the gear teeth and pops the belt - I've went through 3 belts in the first month but now my current belt has lasted since late September. The enertion drive system can be really finicky to get right.
