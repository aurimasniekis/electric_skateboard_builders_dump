Hi,

I'm located in Belgium, order number was 2151, not sure which batch I was on. Got the Raptor Dual.

As you may have seen on yesterday's VLOG, I've asked Jason if there's only 94 sold. 
He replied there are only about 40-50 in the world, the rest is waiting for VESC's so this list should be not to hard to make. 

Nice idea btw. ! #HappyRaptoring

Yesterday I met with @HH1 to hand him my spare battery.
Riding together is sooooo much fun! I'm also located close to you and @Dustin89 is too.
When everyone is up and running we should meet for some rides together :smiley:
Unfortunately five Raptors in one place is max due to the steez remote and the limited channels.....

Mono has no problem keeping up on flat ground. Hill climbing and braking falls short of the dual as you'd expect, but overall it's surprisingly capable. It can get me up and down the steepest hills in my area and I'm about 210lbs (95kgs)   In fact, my first DIY build is going to be a mono with SPACE CELL Pro4. Just waiting on the Pro4.

@Tarzan  i am already looking forward to it when i drop the battery of (and hopefully are able to ride a bit better) to ride with you again.
@Djupex yes my board is up and running though i do not have a charger yet i am only missing an adapter(i ordered a charger with the wrong plug) this board is so much fun but accelerating and breaking is adding a whole new dimension to riding you need to get used to.
@Dedbny could you put 26789 Leer Niedersachsen Germany as address while reviewing my data I thought that the north of Germany is a bit to vague

Nope, sold mine to finance the Raptor about a month ago. Getting the Evolve GT as well for more range and everyday D.C. commuting. I feel like it will be a safer option for non-recreational commutes because the take offs and breaking seem to be very smooth but still powerful. 

Wouldn't be surprised if there are a lot more BBers out there now that the weather is prime for it. I'm sure I will see a few in D.C. this summer.

@HH1 updated. ONce Enertions n sets you up properly youll never look back. As far as the throttle. Just take it slow, so you start getting use to it. I think Tim is alot more experienced with speed and these things. Ride to your limit. i also suggest not to use the C cruise button. That function tend to speed up without smoothness.

I've got the fibreglass lid, 12 holes, kicktail plate,black handle and black toggle switch. Oldskool with bolts trough the wheels like the first pictures in this tread. And the new 2,4 ghz remote as standard (was just upgraded after my order)

@Dedbny yes taking it slow is a good hint i already  ignored it and fell of (or to be honest and even more ashamed i was not even fast but still fell of :-) )but nothing big i would say this is just part of the learning process.

@Tarzan already told me about the tricky cruise control and it's drawbacks

@flatsp0t Email enerttion support and they'll send you a new one. The thing I've found with it is that it wont stay on. Ie its 3M taped on delivery. I've tried flexible glue and tarzan glue, but due to so much vibration and pounding the board takes nothing seems to work, The only thing I can think of is to screw it in, but I dont want to drill into the deck. 

So if you do get one just be aware it may come off. Ive already lost one. You just dont know when it might drop off as in rear.

Mine is still currently off, so deciding what other adhesive to use. Noting seems to work.

I have screwed the tailguard on.
I will take a picture when I'm home from work because it looks tidy :smiley:
I also mounted it a bit more back that it has a small overhang. 
This way I don't have to worry about breaking the cf while carrying the board and hit the ground with the tail.
If I forget to upload pictures, please remind me.

The First picture shows the system and the tail guard. I don't know how these things are called but I guess something with hollow.
The size is M5 and I countersunk the screw in the tail guard.

Laz
Order 1360
Northern NJ Metro NYC Area
Must admit pulling away from other riders with other boards is very satisfying, especially my own kids on the BBD+. I must admit though if I am wearing my Vans the flexy deck of the BBD+ is a little more cushy for those longer rides on bumpy NYC roads.

Sorry for the delay posting this. Had a high speed crash on my Raptor and strained my shoulder ligaments so I have not been riding for about 5 weeks. NO WORRIES is was all worth it and now I am getting back on the saddle and riding again Only minor scratches to the deck so she can take a hit at nearly full speed and survive relatively unscathed.

Fort Bragg,California. order number 4630! yikes!  from the looks of it,seems I won't be getting my board any time soon. I actually canceled my order from Boosted after looking into The Enertia Raptor which in my opinion is the better board out there. Well "potentially"  I think Jason needs to consider starting a production space in the USA most of his new customer base is going to be from here.

We are getting up a solar panel booster production facility in NY. I am wondering if we might be able to put a few of these together here stateside on a spare bench. I'll have to see after we get set up but getting from one side of the factory to the other is a lot faster on a board than walking. even a few fun transitions to to go up and down. Just still need to grind down a few pesky  control joints that are sticking up.
I also ordered the new BBD+ with extended battery of my younger son as he keeps stealing mine. No word yet on production date. You will love the Raptor. I also funded a LINKY folding board on Kickstarter, May have to upgrade it to ENERTION power!  I just love the folding concept. Hopefully it will not be a bust.I enjoy riding at slower speeds as well as fast but in NYC if you are not driving a Ferrari you just ain't shit.
I was at a light and a few young punks were messing with me thinking I was on a regular long board I let them ride away when the light changed green. They all got a surprise when I blew passed them a block later pushing as fast as they could trying to catch up.

order 2782 just shipped this week to Michigan, US.  For those with order numbers after this, you can use my number and the fact that they build about 30 raptors a month to figure out when you would get your order.

Hmm, Does the system count numerically in a linear fashion, or is there some sort of coding in the number like a date or month? Also, if a person just orders one skateboard wheel that may take an order number.

If in fact I need to wait for 2021 Raptors to be built thats 67.4 month, or, 5.61 years. I doubt they would have taken my order if thats the case?

They're ordinal but not metric.
The numbers go up, but the actual order numbers are probably the post numbers used by his shop system. This skips a few numbers between :slight_smile:

@furryfrog 
I am #3210 which should be a one of the next raptors after @Photorph . Posting videos as soon as I get it. It will be the first and only one to ride through Berlin :slight_smile: Lets hope the police wont notice lol
Your wait wont be as long as most of the orders before you. I can remember some people waited 4 months+ and yours should be completed faster by the amount of parts Jason orders nowadays

I would like to see a raptor rider going up and down hills, stopping and starting at lights, general commuting type stuff would be cool, passing cyclist up hills on bike routes lol. I watched every video I could find on you tube of the raptor, wanted to get an idea of its performance going up hills. Your review and thoughts of the board as well, I have the sense this is not your first esk8.

@Dedbny sure I'll do unboxing, and then follow up with other videos.  I'm gonna keep the unboxing short, because I think people get bored if it's too long.  

@furryfrog Ok will do.  I just don't have many hills in my area though.  I can pass cyclists no problem.  And no not my first first esk8...this will be 4th E-board.  Prior to the e-boards I had 3 regular longboards, one for carving, one mini cruiser, and a downhill specific boards.

Frankly, I think unboxing the raptor is a bit anticlimactic, plain box and bubble wrap.  Not like unboxing an Apple device with fancy or well thought out presentation. The magic for Raptor doesn't start until you ride it.

Have no more Raptors been sold after mine (#4808)? This list feels very incomplete.. 

I'd be interested to know who got the hundredth Raptor order :) (were at 94 on June 7th I believe when the VIP club was launched)

I can only record those Raptor owners on the forum and who would give me the detials to post oN this thread. Not all Raptor buyers even know about this forum. Only Enertion know how many are sold.

I started it wanting it to allow others to catch up for a skateboard if they lived in the area which it has worked for a few. Id like to know where all the Australian are, but not all a member here.

Makes total sense dude. I had just hoped when each customer received their Raptor VIP Club invite they would have joined here to take part/enroll. Potentially they simply didn't notice this thread. Also figured this comment would bring this thread back up the boards and hopefully some more recent Raptor customers might take notice. 

Where you at Raptors?

awesome, I think a lot of people are eager to here how the new remote is compared to that fragile steez remote.  Feel free to post your impressions in general of the board and the remote after you ride it, positive and negative.  Here is the thread for reviews.

I'm in the Bay Area, CA and ordered late August.
And finally got my first ride in last night, pretty wicked machine.  It takes a concentrated effort to keep the front wheels on the ground for sure but so awesome.
@lordlimes would be great to put together a meetup in the bay!
