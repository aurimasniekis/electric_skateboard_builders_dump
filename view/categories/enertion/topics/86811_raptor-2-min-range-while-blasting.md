I am curious. What is the lowest range you’ve been able to get with the latest raptor. I don’t have android so I haven’t really got a convenient method of checking this but I’d bet I’ll get lower than 10 miles going mostly full throttle. Can anyone tell me what the raptor does at full throttle for yo my over distances?

I think you will get following 
Slow mode: minimum 8-10 Miles - Maximum up to 25 miles 
R-Spec mode: minimum 8-10 miles - Maximum up to 20 miles

Note: Values vary because of multiple factors involvement

Just to clarify, you expect min range on slow mode to be the same as the min range in R spec mode? 

sofu, I am stoked on the iphone app and will pay whatever it costs.

On my OG Raptor 1 I was getting 10-17 miles and on my Raptor 2 with bigger newer battery I was getting 8-10 miles lol

Maybe the 2.1 is more efficient but I think it has to do with the Raptor 1 being geared with a reduction ratio and the Raptor 2 is 1:1

This can't be right.... I would imagine that slowmode should at least have 20% more range, if not more 🤔

The R2 will never ever get 25 miles. This is false info. Not even in the most perfect conditions will a Raptor get this type of range. The Raptor is a 10 mile or less range board no matter how you cut it. I've owned two of them. Not to mention the 6 others I know that own one that get even less than that.

With an old battery 10s3p pack (25r) my “Raptor 1” rebuild with CarvOn V4 gets this kind of range because of freewheeling. Obviously not full throttling all the time. Damn DDs are efficient!

My last ride with @BigBoyToys 😔 did 17 miles and used 50% battery ( I know it's not entirely accurate, but still awesome ![image|501x499](upload://odivgJwDuLk3gcYAOtIdkUWqOjy.jpeg) 

On the same battery with dual 6355 I got about 15 miles

Currently the Raptor 1 build has a new 10s3p 25r pack and dual 6274s barely got 10 miles going slow. I wonder what difference 30q would make.

I thought I read somewhere that with urethanes and a dual build that isn't inefficient as hell, gets about 5-6 miles per p group of 30q 🤔🤔

So 15-18mi?

Such low range is only good enough for mere mortals. I've done 2 group rides 15 and 20 miles each and I still haven't charged I'm at %50 now. Oh and I always ride fast.

This is the 8p 30q right?

8p 30q yeah.

If you run the Samsung 35e cells at 8p it would have the discharge we need for a fast dual set up and more range than 30q. But on my 4wd set up I need the amps.

I'm tired of having range anxiety

E: I know you probably don't have concrete numbers, but do you think that an Evo would have more underboard space, or a trampa urban carve with 6.5 inch wheels? 🤔🤔

I feel like it might be even... I'm just worried about bottoming out 😂

Eboosted makes an enclosure that fits 8p on either Evo or Trampa. 

Imo I could have built a bigger battery in the Evo if I was going 2wd a 12s9p would fit np.

it is 8a continuous  / 80a for 12s8p for 35e vs 15a continuous  / 120a for 12s8p for 30q 

how many amps are you pulling from 2wd 6374s? are you saying you dont even hit near 120a or 80a with 2wd?

motors maxes are usually around 80a anyway? what am I missing here
```

---
## \#43 Posted by: Battosaii Posted at: 2019-03-19T12:17:13.038Z Reads: 120

I'm running my Unities at 40a battery a per motor so 160a total but no I have never reached that high of amps yet probably cause I need some more time on the board to get comfortable to push the limits.
```

---
## \#44 Posted by: Resonant Posted at: 2019-03-19T12:19:39.839Z Reads: 119

so if 40a battery a per motor 80a total = 35e 80a rate continuous for 2wd might as well use those for bettery range or its safer to use 30q since higher 120a but I doubt anyone is gonna go 80a continuous for long periods of time right?
```

## \#45 Posted by: Battosaii Posted at: 2019-03-19T12:19:56.874Z Reads: 116

What I'm saying is most ESC can't really handle more than 60a per side so most use 40 to be safe on a dual set up that means 80a total.
```

---
## \#46 Posted by: Resonant Posted at: 2019-03-19T12:20:41.499Z Reads: 115

so 30q is just a bunch of unharnessed power basically and lower range.

If you are going with a large P count and dual set up yes thats true but the 30q are great for 4p set ups

## \#48 Posted by: Resonant Posted at: 2019-03-19T12:22:55.457Z Reads: 122

```
why would that still be better for a 4p setup that confuses me

why do people choose 30q if its a bunch of power that cant be used and decreases range

focbox unity is capable of 80a on motors continuous ( is that per motor? if so -> cus 160 system continuous it should be able to hit 80a on each motor x 2 = 160 system?
```

---
## \#49 Posted by: Battosaii Posted at: 2019-03-19T12:30:48.872Z Reads: 118

```
Because a 4p 30q can deliver 80a continuos so that's perfect for a dual set up. 

Also you may be confusing motor amps and battery amps. Motor amps are different and can be much higher than the battery amps.
```

---
## \#50 Posted by: Resonant Posted at: 2019-03-19T12:33:14.871Z Reads: 121

```
the 35e's should be able to deliver 80a continuous as well? 

edit oh nevermind 35e is 40a for 12s4p but 80a for 12s8p so that would ultimately be the better option in that config in 2wd vs 12s8p 30q which has more power than can be used and lower capacity / is the reason why you say if you didnt need 4wd youd use 35e?
```

---
## \#51 Posted by: Battosaii Posted at: 2019-03-19T12:42:04.597Z Reads: 114

```
35e at higher P groups can deliver the amps that we want for a fast board, less than a 30q at the same size but enough amps yet on the other hand it has a higher capacity so you would get more range with the 35e and still have a fast board.

I did a range test yesterday and I'm a little unhappy. 
I mostly pressed 75-90% in Rspec mode and at the end I reached a range of 14km/8.7miles.

Compared to my meepo unfortunately very disappointed even if the weather conditions were on meepos side I expected at least 20km.


**Details**

_Weight:_ 88kg / 194lbs

**_Raptor 2.1_:** 

75-90% (Throttle) Rspec

_Temperature:_ ~16 degrees, windy

_Range_: 14km/8.7miles -- avg. 33.1kmh/20.57mph

_Topspeed_: 45kmh/28mph

![20190416_162205|320x500](upload://sD065hRp1q41FzyWM9IeR1FS3Yq.jpeg) 

_**Meepo v2 Sanyo:**_ 

80-100% (Throttle) 3rd mode

_Temperature:_ ~22 degrees

_Range_: 22km/13.7miles -- avg. 27.1kmh/16.84mph

_Topspeed_: 40kmh/25mph

![20190416_162147|340x500](upload://pkUHD9BRCjRoYO62yhlkcDAY1Zq.jpeg) 

note: on the screenshot at the bottom right the max speed is not correct but the one on the graph is the correct one.

Edit: So on avg. i was 6kmh slower with the meepo but got 8km more range. I will do a new test soon. Maybe i have to contact enertion.

Sorry Carl, nothing against you but I hate this answer and the thought behind it. These *DEVICES* (vehicles, toys, whatever) deserve real range estimates, or at least a 'worse case' vs 'best case'. There has to be some sort of customer protection against this. 

He's getting 14 kms off a good damn 30q 10s4p. I got 15 kms off a 10s4p 25r pack... built by enertion (both packs, wildly underperforming)

Removed last paragraph, was a little preachy.

I weigh about 200 lbs  with the throttle at 100% I can make it in somewhat cold weather about 3.5 miles before getting to the 50% battery level. While riding with friends who have slower boards I have made it 7 miles before getting to 50%. Good luck riding under 25% it feels very slow down below 30%.

I think its much about riders weight. A lot is riding conditions as well but we all know about that. Personally i think 12 miles in real life is a good result by "throttling" all the way through, but not as much as advertised. Maybe a 70kg rider could reach 3 more miles without shoes
