So my raptor arrived and it's loads of fun. One small problem... I got the fast charger in the box and proceeded to get a 250v 10a extension for my American outlets but the charger always has the green led on indicating it's fully charged even when it's only at 40%. The charger thinks the battery is full and won't charge it. 

I tried trouble shooting with other extensions but to no avail. When I unplug it and replug it it gives off a spark also. 

Any ideas?

I have no idea here, but maybe it'll "spark" someone to help you solve the problem. Are you meaning you're using an American 240V plug when you say "250v 10a extension?" Do you know if you plugging into a single phase or three phase connection? I know the fast charger is listed as dual voltage, I assume it is intended for a single phase connection like most dual voltage electronics. If you have been trying to plug into a 3 phase 240V connection, perhaps that is the issue. If your using some unusual and truly "250V" connection that is likely the issue as the fast charger seem to be rated for 240V max. Again, I don't really know. I'm only suggesting it as a possibility. Perhaps you can try to plug into a typical single phase 120V American connection. I don't believe this should have an impact on charge rate relative to 240V. Does the Enertion fast charger have a voltage switch? I don't have one one, but looking online today it seems some similar looking chargers do have a physical voltage switch. If the Enertion fast charger does too, you might want to be certain is flipped to the proper voltage your attempting to use.

 I'm out and about trying to enjoy the last 20% of my battery and one of the motors fell off and got completed scratched and messed up. I even double checked the motor mounts specifically before I left. This shouldn't be happening on the first day dude. I spent 1500$ for a missing slow charger, a broken fast charger and now a scratched up board that I have to work to fix. AND the motor looks fucked up now. Not to mention it was 3 months late for the quality control, so that THIS wouldn't happen.  Today is not a good day.

To boot, the screw came off in transit so now I can't even fix it myself. Sweet.

It looks like you hadn't put any thread locker on that opening at all. Theres no residual on the opening of the one that fell off, but the one next to it does.

I feel for you dude.  That really sucks.  Mine is set to arrive in mere hours, and I know how sad I will be if something similar happens.  I'm trying to keep in mind that this is THE first batch of Raptors, and that there are bound to be some growing pains.  The Raptor has a warranty, so I'm sure Jason will take care of any issues.  At the end of it all we will all have the best board money can buy.  :smile:

I am happy to send you a new motor. After all it was my mistake for not applying enough thread locker. I really want all my raptor customers to have the opportunity to put their own scratches on the raptor due to their own errors, not due to mine... :smile: 

The only problem with a new motor is you need to remove heat shrink, & re-glue the connections at the VESC.

You also need to remove the pulley from the old motor and that will require circlip pliers.

I suppose i could send a motor assembly with the CF plate & Pulley already attached, then you just need to deal with three wires & some heat shrink.

anyway... this is up to you. What do you suggest?

To make onloops day. As it seems there are some issues big and small. I can say I am not disappointed what so ever with the product. 

The waits been long, but once it arrived the wait  has been forgotten. The whole package is fantastic, and the wait for the right hand controller was the correct descision.

Great unboxing! I'm happy to see more of them . I liked the camara angle when you removed the lid. The reflection on the shinny carbon fiber was cool. Also, I thought it was funny when you picked up the wrong tool,  don't know why. Of course, I laughed when the boards power surprised you and you fell off. I can't wait to experience that power. 

I noticed you're married, as am I. What are the odds any of us could get our wifes' to do a ride video?  I think that'd be funny too. I'd expect lots of comments like "this thing is stupid fast, your going to kill yourself, how much life insurance are we carrying on you, again?" I don't know why, but I really want to try and make that happen. If I get it on video, I will definitely share.

Switzerland is somewhat tax heavy in regards to personal taxes. They are higher than some on import taxes and one of the highest for import fees, separate from taxes as a percentage. They happen to be one of the lowest, overall, for corporate taxes. In fact, small businesses starting out here can go 2 years tax free. Different Cantons have different tax rates for both individuals and businesses, kind of like American states. Zug, the Canton and city I live in has some of the very lowest corporate taxes in the world. This attracts business from around the globe. Many global companies have a presence, or even their headquarters here. Some of that is changing though. 

To @Howser's issue it seems related to a lot of red tape, more than fees themselves. Switzerland has a lot of bureaucracy, in general. It's not uncommon, in my experience, for the Swiss to seemingly sometimes get caught up in following to rules. Don't get me wrong, they're great and I love it here. It's just that they seem very stringent and seem to take pride in enforcement even on a personal level. I've literally seen a Swiss someone make the effort to come downstairs out of an office building, walk about 100 meters/yards, and tell someone they had driven the wrong way in an otherwise completely empty parking lot. While this was one of my first experiences here, and I found it surprising, I wouldn't find it surprising at all today having been here a while now. 

While things can get stuck in the gears of bureaucracy here, there are always rules. Fortunately that means there are rules for how to deal with confusion and the bureaucracy itself. It can take some time, but in the end, it all seems to work out.

Great idea to secure the protective power plug with the lid cover screw @Dedbny . That seems to be even more secure than press fitting it between the board and battery. Thanks for sharing. I will definitely use this method.

Do not expect any un-boxing videos from me, I'm too impatient. Got my SPACE cell and just waiting for the Raptor now. You will see videos of my and my son on the Boosted Dual+ riding side by side soon.

I do have data logged from several rides on my son's Boosted Dual+ with him riding as well as myself (I'm Godzilla sized wind resistance + 2x his weight) around a fixed loop in a local park as well as neighborhood loop (both with elevation changes) that I ran fully charged till depletion. Can't wait for the the comparison of rides and distance. I will take into consideration the difference in battery capacity and then determine effectiveness of drive systems on a km/w basis. I recently got back from a trip and was frustrated as the Boosted Dual+ ran short three blocks from my meeting so the 99Wh battery was the main reason for me looking elsewhere for e-transportation that is realistically transportable. I will be posting my results as soon they are able to be made. Living in the North East of the US and with fresh snow this morning I did not order my Raptor the the winter studded wheels option so weather permitting I will get to it soon as I can.

I also thought the Std charger was included with the SPACE cell and the additional price was for the fast charger in addition to the std one. We all know slow charging is ideal for best battery life but often need the fast charge to keep up with life's fast pace.  Jason ( @onloop )  no worries mate,  all we ask is that you offer it to those of us asking for it for a fair price that does not have you loose out on the deal. 

Finally I see that Jason is replying to new owners concerns in lightning fast response times. I cannot ever recall a company that is so open and honest as well as owning up to their growing pains. His passion & dedication to making each and everyone of us a satisfied customer is to be commended. I applaud him and respect him and wish you much success. Cheers and all the best!

I couldn't agree more.  It was a large part of the reason why I selected the Raptor over other boards.

Just curious, those have used their boards, what kind of operating range are you getting with the remote?  Presently, I have to stay within about 2-3 feet of the electronics to get a consistent signal (in other words, I can't hold the remote in front of me, I have to hang my arm down - I'm 6'1").

I agree with @MonsterCoatings and @Xusia, Jason has been very accessible, responsive, and shown great concern in providing a great experience. We know he is running things in a very hands on way and with time at a premium. Sure I've had some issues, but thus far, for me personally, I could not ask more of him.

I accept that almost any company is going to have occasional issues with a product. I try to judge a company not so much in whether there is an issue or not. Rather by how it handles an issue when one occurs. Thus far Enertion has been exceptionally good in this regard. **Thank you, Jason, for bringing this product to reality and supporting your customers in the way you have so far.**

Related to the remote's range. Jason told me he plans to produce a video soon outlining the remote functions completely, including pairing. He said there are multiple channels the remote can use. It's said to operates in the  2.4ghz range, so it might be susceptible to some level of interference from things such as WiFi signals, *Bluetooth*, cordless phones, etc. That said, the 2.4ghz range is fairly robust and I'd expect at least a 20 foot range even with heavy congestion. I wouldn't expect it should have much issue penetrating you body if it has power similar to a cordless phone. I'm not sure it does, though. Maybe there is an issue related to the receiver placement and the VESC or other component. In my dual the receiver is essentially right next to one of the VESC. I wonder what the configuration looks like for the singles, and if they have any better reception because of a possible difference.  In @Xusia's video around the 10:45 mark you see him run the board away from him and stop it at what looks like, to me, about 25 feet. You might want to wait till the video about the remote comes out and then  try getting another channel in the band. I was told that the remote pairs when the board is turned on first, before the remote. Maybe (big maybe) a combination of turning the remote and board on and off separately could pair them on a new channel... If so, it might improve your apparent issue with range, assuming interference in the 2.4ghz range.  You could also try using it somewhere where your certain they are no other 2.4ghz signals. Perhaps then your range would improve and you could rest easy knowing that the issue is easily resolvable by changing channels once you know how. Anyhow, hope that helps, either way good luck. Let us know if you find any solutions, like @MonsterCoatings remote extension.

So I took it out again, a couple things. When I road it on the sidewalk the tiny cracks would displace the belt and it would catch and shoot me off. So I went to the street and the rattling made something loose inside so I lost remote signal. I tried turning them all off and on and nothing worked. The board was at 50% the remote had a green light for charged still but wouldn't connect. 

I walked 3 miles uphill and then when I saw downhill I road it on the sidewalk which seemed to rattle something inside to make the remote work again. 

I appreciate your response time and your help-fullness but my qualm with this board is that I can not just take It out and ride it without expecting something to go wrong. You showed us someone kick flipping it but i can't even ride anywhere but the smoothest surfaces.

[/quote]


are you saying the belt is literally getting caught on something? or it just feels like it is? I am not sure how it is possible. can you send a photo? Does the belt need to be tighter? 

basic maintenance and stuff is always important, but at this early stage you should definitely feel like you can go for a ride without worrying about problems..and really there's probably nothing that you should have to adjust... i have never heard of small cracks causing a belt to shift, im scratching my head on that one.

There is a chance your remote is not working properly, it might be faulty, there might be some interferences. Maybe some wires came loose, but they are all glued with hot glue. so it also seems unlikely it is due to a loose wire. I will make a video today showing how to change the radio channel. Also, try to test this without any other radio device nearby. It shouldn't matter, i ride with my phone always without problems.

The LID itself is made with Carbon Fiber, this is known to block radio signals, After a trial of pure CF I ended up going with CF & Glass because I was worried it might block the signal.

After testing with both Pure CF lid & CF & Fiber Glass there didn't appear to be any difference. We ended going with the CF & FG anyway.

One test you could try to see if it is the LID itself blocking the signal, just remove it and go for a ride to see if there are improvements. If it works better I will make Pure Glass Fiber lid and send that to you.

Also, this sounds stupid, but if you put your foot directly over the receiver combined that with the CF layer in the lid, maybe it is enough to cause these problems.

OK. Separately, would you mind sharing a picture of the layout of the electrical components inside the (Raptor single) board? I haven't seen that yet in any other pictures or videos. I'm simply curious. With 1 less VESC, I wonder how the layout differs from the dual.

So I think I solved the belt problem. It was really a gear grinding problem but I tightened them as tight as they go I'll let you know if they keep shifting though. 

The remote problem is interesting though. I just took the lid off and the remote was WAY more responsive.  I could be about 6-8 feet without a lid and i didnt have to point at it directly. But what I don't understand is when the remote went out on my ride I was walking for 3 miles trying to figure out what was wrong I pointed the remote not even 6 inches away from the vesc and it didn't work. But now it does.

test it without the lid. if it is not better try repositioning the receiver, you will need hot air to soften the hot glue we used to mount it.

If this problem is somthing that everyone with a raptor has ill get the recevier redesigned with a high gain antenna.

I doubt the motor has failed, but there is a good chance that when the motor fell off it has pulled one of the phase wires out of the VESC...

the domino effect.

more than happy to have you send it back, get it rebuilt, ride it around to ensure its fine, then send it back again.

Ok I was just riding and I heard a rubbing noise. So I found that the belt was rubbing on the wheel because 2bolts on the motor mount bracket were loose, allowing the motor assembly to move closer to the wheel, thus rubbing. So.. No big deal, I went ahead  and aligned the motor assembly tightened up the 2 bolts nice and tight. After riding about an 30 minutes, all was good until the belt started rubbing on the wheel again. I went ahead an removed the 2 aforementioned screws, and found the problem. It looks like a bad batch of thread locker. This is an easy fix and just wanted to warn all raptor owners to double check their screws for thread locker before anything bad happens.<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/7/783d46dc025398374b5bc2eac9d0a40a75ff91c0.jpg" width="375" height="500">

But what I don't understand is when the remote went out on my ride I was walking for 3 miles trying to figure out what was wrong I pointed the remote not even 6 inches away from the vesc and it didn't work. But now it does.
[/quote]

Not sure if this is the issue, but do you remember if the LED on the LEFT side of the remote (when pointed forward) was red or green?  If it was green, the remote was in cruise control mode (red is normal mode).  If the wheels are not moving and the remote enters this mode, it appears like the remote does not work.  All you need to do, however, is press the stick down to exit cruise control mode and get back to normal mode.

So I took the motor off completely and ran it. It spins but then some sparks came out and now my garage smells like a burnt motor. And not to forget to mention that it's also very hot now.

 I'm sorry if any of my posts come out as snarky. I've been looking into buying an eboard for over a year now and almost went with the boosted but I waited for you because I wanted the range speed and quality. I'm a college student that isn't rich and has to save for 3 months for this board and now every single time I've ridden it something has gone wrong because you skimped on the thread locker (which can be seen in your how to videos), or the alignment of the motor for the one that didn't fall off was off. Then the screws to the motor mount caused the motor to rub and now to burn. The attena went out because there wasnt enough super glue to hold it in place to ensure the connection isnt lost when ot wiggles around in the board.

I don't feel bad asking you to replace this because all of the damage is from you. You could even fix it and use it in your videos or something. If you're unwilling I guess I'll take the repair. But I refuse to pay the parcel fee. How do I go about sending it back?

Listen onloop, this is my guess...if you notice the red threadlocker, it is not applied at the tips of the screws. And from what i saw, the tips of the screws is what contacts the mount. Threadlocker doesnt go bad in 12 months as far as i know.

shit man.. I really hope your ankle is ok.

here is what likely happened

The Low Voltage Cut off (LVC) of S.P.A.C.E Cell is 28v
This is roughly how the LCD is programmed.
42v = 100%
40v = 80%
37v = 50%
35v = 30%
33v = 10%
32v = 0%

Once the battery reaches 0% **under load** you will probably be hitting the LVC - which means **OFF**

I am not sure what your readout would have said once it started up the hill & and the motors started drawing more current.. but i would assume that your voltage dropped to 0% very quickly. Basically, the LVC of the BMS came on and that makes the board stop accelerating whilst your body continued.

Honestly, I never bothered using the LVC cutoff built into the VESC because I never ride the board uphill with very low battery power. But this is no excuse, I now have to think about all the possibilities that will occur when other people ride.

So from now on I'll program a soft voltage cut-off at 33V and hard cutoff at 28v, this way if you approach a hill like the one in your video the board won't shut off rapidly. It will slow down.

**Based this video I highly recommend that everyone considers making this change or not riding up hills with low % battery**

ALSO, you guys might want to get something like this to help with accessing the USB port on the VESC.

search something like this: **"Mini USB Male to Female Right Angle 90 Degree Adapter"**

Jason @onloop just a suggestion for those that may not have a full snap on box of tools to just open up and repair most anything on the board. 
For many with questions here a tool list and a full hardware detail list (any way you can take the exploded view int the cad software and number the parts with descriptions)  so identification is easy and/or replacement can be as easy as a quick run to the local hardware store (i.e. I need a socket cap M6x20mm screw).

Just came back from a ride and did a check of the fittings. Probably should of done that before I left after reading raptor customer post.

Bolts to motor mounts looked fine. Gave them a quick tighten. The RHS motor and drive was a little loose compared to the other. Found the gromit screw to the end motor belt drive was a little loose. Easy fix. Im going to watch the Onloop video on Motor Mount set up to check up on things to look out for. 

There is a slight clicking sound to the LHS motor on the half turn. Sounds like it coming from wheel. Bearing?

On the subject of the remote controller range, I tested my Enertion remote this afternoon and I could get 10m from my board before the signal dropped. Please note this was NOT on a Raptor.
Another good thing was the fact the board went to neutral when the signal dropped.

Mine has arrived today and after paying 305€ (ouch) to the postman I unwrapped it.
In this post I'll just write down what I "dislike" and save the good, well the awesome stuff to the new thread.
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/raptor-riding-experience-the-good/1299
1. Okay first look and the griptape is sticking very bad on the board. A lot of bubbles and only like 50% of the glue had contact to the skateboard and the rest was not pressed down. I don't know why it was like this and I hope that Enertion give the board a rub with alcohol before they glue it on. I have heated it slightly with a hot air gun to make the glue softer and stick better. Good! I hope that it will stay there now and no silicone is on the surface.
2. Some of the screws were loose and I recommend to everyone to check them before riding. Two of the eight screws that hold the trucks were completely loose.
3. Like others noticed on there first ride the range of the hand controller in combination with the CF Deck is poor. Especially on the first ride it is damn dangerous because you hit the joystick to accelerate aaaand nothing. If you change the position and leave the joystick in the acceleration position the remote get signal und you launch forward.
4. @ Onloop. Do we need two of these risers to get no wheelbite? I really like it when a skateboard is low.

Please let us know if you have any success and how you go about this. Do you already know how you will do it? Do you know where to place an extension as far as which wire and whatnot? Here is what it looks like in my Dual Raptor:

My hope is that this might be a lead that can be easily used for an antenna extension:

When I obtain an adapter that will allow me to access the mini USB port on the VESC in my Raptor I will attempt to make the changes you've outlined. I ordered a few today from a few different places, but it'll be at least a week before any of them make it. Anyhow, Will I need to make these changes to both VESC (slave and master) or just the master? Basically, I'm not sure, even with an adapter, that I will be able to gain access to the mini USB port on the slave without removing it. That's not something I would look forward to. I'm handy enough to do it, but bought the complete to avoid such complications.

that wire is not an antenna, it allows the signal from the RX to be split and sent directly into each vesc, in the end I decided to use CANbus interface for better syncing of the motors. I left the wire there just in case.

you can configure both vesc from one usb port. access to the with RX directly connected should be easy.

you probably only need to make those changes if there is a chance you will ride the board to 0% charge. I know this sounds like stupid mistake/excuse on my behalf, but because i started out riding with lipo batteries on my eboards I would never ride it to such a point the LVC would kick in - i was always battery conscious. 

The problem is I am not designing the board for just me anymore, I must think of everyone and all possibilities, this is a well-learned lesson now. I will make changes & imporve.

yes, i prefer if people dont make changes to the firmware, but as a safety precaution it might be a good idea.

I'm still curious with what @Nasty will do related to an antenna extension. If it works to improve reception (and isn't to complicated to achieve) better communication between the remote and Raptor can't be a bad thing, right?

1. yes for some reason that grip tape only sticks down after you have ridden it once or twice, i thought about ordering another batch but it would add another two weeks and wasnt sure it would change anything..i didnt think it was a justified wait considering it does stick once you start to ride it.. It stays down once it has weight on it so you could stack a some books on top of a towel to help that if you want..surface was cleaned before apply it.


2. Screws being loose is a major issue which I am gut wrenching over :cry: . I personally checked all the screws that I installed twice, whether my new assistant took the same methodological approach maybe not. I have been building eboards for three years full time, I know how important it is and it is an automatic instinct for me, My assistant hasn't and was literally 2 weeks into a new role & seriously under the pump. *I am not sure if anyone read my owners manual but it clearly says check all the screws before riding, i also made a video emphasizing how important it is. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: *  Anyway, I am not trying to make this is an excuse, I totally fucked up.. and accept full responsibility. We are now rethinking out QC procedure, i must admit that we could have done a better job at building the first batch. it was fucking chaos, i only thought id sell 10 of these and we sold 3x that much... it was mayhem for a while.

3. this is another oversight on my behalf. During testing i just rode how i naturally would, for me this is holding the remote in my right hand and holding it low, its normally only max of 3ft away. Never had any signal issues also my deck has a pure carbon fiber lid too. I will probably need to change the lid to Pure Glass Fiber...

4. the extra riser was a last minute safety idea. you can get away with just one, but beware the chance of wheel bite increases & the chance of the motor hitting the deck increases (only when cornering really aggressively). If you are a big guy its probably better to leave the two in place. But test it & see. it also depends on what bushing setup you go with, the standard bushings are probably not good for heavy guys (95kg+) so i suggest changing them if you want to ride at high speed and avoid the wobs.

After the second ride I have to admit that we need a better connection between both.
Mine is really bad and gives me a hard time while riding. 
Especially when you are in a multi-storey car park like me 20 min ago (only dry spot I could find). It was pure fun an a adrenalin rush but if you can't break because you hold the controller 5cm to far from the board the fun part drops pretty fast. 
Same with acceleration in bends. I leave the throttle on the same position and move on the board and it stops and starts accelerating uncontrolled.
If this issue is solved you can't beat the performance this Raptor delivers.

in order to truly enjoy the power of the raptor you have to build full confidence in the board. losing connection is certainly not helpful. but i'm confident a solution will be found soon. i will be able to start testing tomorrow as well (yeaah). this might be one of those occasions where my smaller statue will be of advantage.

has anyone tried if removing the rubber case on the remote is making a difference already? the sledgehammer approach would be to cut another hole in the board above the receiver.

also some of you may have noticed, in some cases the holes for the trucks had to be re-drilled. it's only a cosmetic thing but it bugs me a bit. my idea is to cover it with grip tape as well. i'll get some this week and post some pictures how it looks. maybe in a different shade of gray or if available in a blue similar to the trucks.

maybe for now, anyone with signal issues, i suggest drilling a 10-15mm hole directly above the RX (perhaps first test with the lid off to ensure it improves the results)

I will send all raptor customers with signal problems a new lid... with less carbon fiber in it!.

**it also dawned on me maybe some of you got boards with pure carbon fiber lids... I just realised I didn't change that until the 2nd batch of decks... :cold_sweat:**

1. All good! The heat gun works like a charm and makes the gip tape really sticky.
2. Do you think i should unscrew everything and put new Locktite on the lower windings of the screws? Sad that the boards don´t have a serial number and you could check who made it. Like Tom said I bought a complete to avoid such a work.
3. Yes if you ride regular and use your right hand for the controller. I ride goofy and use the hand controller with the right hand so it makes a bigger distance. What do you think about drilling holes in the lid over the RX?

actually those holes are meant to be there, at least in my initial design, Because the deck is sold separately it needs to be multi-truck compatible, not everyone has the same truck hole patterns, so in my first & 2nd batch the extra holes are drilled. but in the 3rd batch there are no extra truck holes. Actually my wife told me to remove them, she said it looks shit...

Hey Raptor, 

Once again sorry for missing these messages. It's actually very difficult keeping up with new messages on these threads, sometimes I miss em. you can email me directly whenever you want jason@enertionboards.com

I am curious, how did you test that motor? You said you took it completely off? you tested it using it connect to the vesc right, i hope :wink:


In that video, the reason the motor is twitching is because one of the phase wires has come loose, probably at the 5.5mm connectors at the vesc itself. Enough force will pull them out of the plug (but maybe inside the motor the wires got yanked out too - i honestly don't know because you have not sent me any pictures!!! hint hint). 

Anyway, all this likely happened due to the motor falling off and being dragged across the ground. The spark are probably due to the phase wires touching each other somewhere, maybe now you have a damaged VESC too.

**PLEASE LET ME SAY THIS TO ALL RAPTOR CUSTOMERS**
**if you have a problem email me, don't try to solve major problems with guess work as it might lead to electrocutions, fires, or more damage being done..**

ANYWAY... Dude your posts aren't snarky, you paid good money and got a board that had a loose screw, the screw fell out and damaged your motor, then the motor shorted during *some test procedure*.... none of this is your fault. you will not have to pay a cent to get this problem resolved. but it will take time.

Here are the 3 options for you.

1. I send the parts you fix it
2. you send the board (without battery) to my US agent they repair it
3. you send the thing back to Australia i fix it.

last option is probably the slowest.

And why to hell eight holes?
[/quote]

the idea was to make the deck multi-truck compatible and also allow the rider to increase/decrease wheelbase to tune the handling... the longer wheelbase is more stable at high speed, but less turny...

i thought it was a good idea at the time...  :flushed:

Yes and I replied to that post yesterday with no response... Dude, I appreciate that you are a stand up guy trying to do good business, I just believe my board was poorly put together (it could have been your assistant). I do t think this is a domino effect problem other than the motor. Sorry for calling you out on the thread locker. I'll make another video here shortlly.

you send the thing back to Australia i fix it.

that video was really well done, thanks.

its clear your deck missed out on getting a thorough QC. 

the only enertion agents at the moment are in the EAST! 

Unless there are any other West based esk8 community folks that want to help me out on this and act as an agent, you will get a repair fee & also get some parts. 

basically, I will send a new set of parts to the designated repair agent to replace all the things that got damaged. 
1. pulleys.
2. motor/s
3. new belts
4. new VESC, if needed. but lets hope not.

I tested my board without the battery compartment cover and remote range was MUCH improved.  I could hold the remote over my head and it still worked!  I also looked at the position of my foot and it was behind the receiver, which is to say it was not in the way at all.  So I think that nails the problem down to the battery compartment cover.  Thank you so much for offering to send out new ones.  That's just awesome.  :smile:

First of all I don't want to be a big downer but I just got my raptor today and spent some time getting this bad boy going. Well the first thing I did was trying to get the space cell to turn on and it would flash on for a second and turn off as soon as I let go of the button. So I tried to hold the button down and it would come up to 93%. But as soon as I let go nothing. After hearing of other people having this same issue I believe I have a faulty switch. So I went ahead and held the switch
Down and checked the drive and remote and everything checked out just great. So I know Jason is probably overwhelmed with first run issues but have to add one more to your list. My order  number is 1550 if that helps. Also welling to save you some shipping if you want to sale me this defected space cell.

If you are in the states, an enertion Rep can fix your battery switch for you. Jason would pay the postage for you to send the battery to get fixed, and you would be able to have it back in a relatively quick amount of time.

btw, boosted and Enertion are very different companies. Boosted boards is about money. While any company wants to profit, Enertion cares way more about about quality. Look at those little motors on boosted vs enertions beefy rspec motors. Not to mention the space cell and VESC are top of the line. And enertion is community based, and everything is open source. I emailed boosted about their parts and they emailed me back telling me they can not disclose details about their electronics. Very different companies and I doubt they would be willing to help the eskate community.

Background so you don't think I'm a noob rider. I've been skating for over 10 years, I frequently ride a normal longboard to work.

Picked up the board at 6:30pm in San Francisco! Had the battery already charged so I plugged the nunchuck into my computer. hour later, couldn't figure out how to pair the remote to the board. Figured out to hold the A button and the LED turns red on one side and green on the other. Success :)

This thing flies! Torque is out of this world. immediately, noticed the remote is not sensitive. Most of the time I had to push the stick forward about 1cm before it would make the engines turn on. Also the remote seems "all or none" meaning that I can't go at a constant middle speed.  With the Boosted board, pressing the trigger foward 2mm made the board go 4mph, trigger 4mm made the board go 8mph.... With this the board pushing the stick forward makes the board go 30mph or nothing at all. Whatever, I got used to this quickly by pulsing the throttle. To brake, the remote is not sensitive either.. I found myself having to push the stick about 0.5cm back before the braking kicks on. I got used to this... Or so I thought. 

After about 1 hour of riding, I was confident bombing at full speed and decided to slow down. I eased the brake 0.5cm and nothing. I let the stick come back to neutral and I tried it again very slowly. At the normal 0.5cm, I felt the brake kick in so I held it... but suddenly, I felt the brake RELEASE and THEN it started to brake again. I lurched and flew off my board thank god no obstacles. I rolled about 3 or 4 times as I was going top speed. I limped home after that. 

I looked over this thread and found others having problems with the remote. This problem is scary. It's concerning that the remote isn't very sensitive... Meaning I have to push it forward 1 cm before makes the engines turn on. Now I'm worried if the remote un-pairs at top speed... That could be dangerous. But what happened on my ride seems worse. it was like the signal got lost for a split second and then reconnected as I was braking. 

Like I said, during the first hour I got used to the looseness of the remote... I don't like it but I got used to its. I would rather the remote activate the motor as soon as I move the stick forward 1 mm rather than having to push the stick 1cm forward before it activates. Anyways then I got used to the brakes and having to move the stick about 0.5cm backwards for the brakes to begin to work. 

But damn... I haven't had a fall that bad in years. Mostly because I was going max speed. And the braking did something completely unexpected. I put over 100 miles on the trial boosted board that I rented for a month without a fall because the remote never came unpaired and the sensitivity was predictable. 

I'm gonna keep trying this out tmr. But God, I don't know if I can trust the remote to be paired when I need it... I don't know if I can trust the remote to brake when I need it. And thus...don't know if it's safe to go at top speed again. The fall really freaked me out and I have a hard time believing this was my fault...

understood.  I guess my questions are:
1. Is the remote truly all or none? As im testing it the board's remote has two speeds: off or full speed. The remote may as well be an on/off switch. 

2. is this a faulty remote that I have to push the stick forward 1 cm before the engines turn on?

3. Now that I'm playing with the board upside down... I notice that every 10 times I hit the stick forward, nothing happens and I have to let the stick come back to neutral and then hit the stick forward again... How do I fix this?

That might be connection issues. Remember that the board is made of carbon fiber, which messes with the 2.4 ghz signal. I haven't heard of anyone else having that issue. I am waiting for the controller to arrive myself to test it out. Watching Jason's videos of accelerating with the remote seem promising.

I don't believe its an all or nothing remote, but I can't confirm since I have yet to test this remote out. I am hoping not, seeing as I am using using motors which are capable of 45 mph+ in the board I'm building now, and that would make this remote useless for me.

In my very limited experience with the remote, while it doesn't quite have the finesse I'd like, I don't have to push it that far for it to engage.  Same on the braking.  More gradation for the remote lever, and/or actuation using a ramp up curve (as opposed to linear), would likely be helpful.

Ok I'll try reprogram. But that's not really the problem... Ramp up to top speed is fine I actually like it. It's the fact that when the throttle is activated it's 100% speed or its Zero. Is this your experience?

It might be possible to adjust that somehow through the settings of the VESC, though I can't confirm. The VESCs are feature rich and open source, so it wouldn't surprise me if you could. However, I would not recommend prodding around the settings without following a guide (unless you really know what you are doing).

Hi guys, I know you all want to ride at full speed on this, but there is a **CONFIRMED ISSUE** with the **pure carbon fiber lid blocking signals**. 10 of you out of approx 30 have full carbon fiber lids, 20 of you have half Cf half Fiber Glass. Signal will likely drop out if you tend to ride with your hands up high.

Once again I didn't test it riding with my hands up high, i never ride like that i always have my hand low... its stupid that I didn't test for this... i am realising that i clearly didn't think of everything before releasing this.

Please be careful until I can arrange new lids.

P.S. I just spent three hours riding the mono raptor side-by-side with a boosted board for a new compare video i am making. Not one drop out, not one problem with the brake on the Raptor...

I think what is happening to a lot of you is you are not used to the sensitivity of the remote... this remote operates in millimeters not centimeters, just like the GT-2B that many people use & love.. So Please don't jerk on the brake or the accelerator, you WILL crash. 
Please think about how you drive your car, you jump in and slowly accelerate to a desired speed, when braking you apply the brake lightly until you come to a controlled stop. If you pull the brake on hard the board will instantly brake, the regen current limit will be hit and the motor controller will stop controlling the motor and it will release it. meaning you lurch forward again and go flying...

if you haven't watch this video please watch it now.

EDIT: I stand corrected and I apologize... As Jason said the sensitivity is in millimeters not centimeters. I just filmed a video to send to Jason of the "all or nothing" with my remote and I can clearly see the remote is more sensitive than I made it out to be. 

Understood, I'll keep playing with it. As I said, I feel like I've learned where the stick activates the motors both for acceleration and braking. 

I experience the issue with braking, whatever the sensitivity, in that braking is "all or none", when I push the stick just enough to activate the brake, it brakes fully. It isn't possible for me to do a controlled stop.

Same with the acceleration. Even when I baby the throttle forward, nothing. nothing. nothing. then WHAM! there's a point where all of a sudden the motors activate at full strength... it is not possible for me to accelerate slowly unless I pulse the throttle.

I don't own a Raptor but I do have the Enertion remote and I have the same experience, the trigger feel is a bit too "all or nothing".
I was playing around with settings in the VESC last night and I found that decreasing the dead-band will make the board react to the joystick faster, but still jerky.
The only way I could get smooth and gradual acceleration is to set the PPM control mode to *PID speed control* but then I had no brake.
Setting the control mode to *PID speed control with brake* turned out to be dangerous, because the board went crazy backwards after braking hard.

**CONFIRMED ISSUE** with the pure **carbon fiber lid blocking signals**.
[/quote]

I'm assuming you don't have a way of identifying who has what lid material by their serial number or order number, correct? Is it possible we could tell by the weight of the lids? I don't yet know if I suffer from a poor connection to my remote (as I'm not running yet) and have no idea if my lid is 100% carbon fiber or a carbon fiber and glass mix. I was wondering if there might be a way to tell which I have. To me, just looking, it looks like carbon fiber. That said, I expected carbon fiber to be less heavy. I thought, perhaps, the grip tape was throwing of my perception. Anyhow, I weighed mine to be **381.5 grams or 13.4 oz** using the same scale. Obviously there is a margin of error here as those two numbers don't directly correlate. Perhaps if enough people can weigh their lids we can better identify the material type we all have and better understand the impact of the material type on remote reception. 

**Is anyone else able to weigh their lids?** If so, please do, and report on the quality of your remote's reception.

@Xusia What is is you're trying to do? A firmware update? If so, is it for a specific feature of the new firmware? I have seen this before:

[quote="EnertionSupport, post:9, topic:706"]
Quote By: Benjamin Vedder. Using the wrong firmware will most likely kill the FETs and/or the drv, so when you change firmware you should use some kind of power supply that cannot deliver too much current at first and preferably a low voltage (&lt;20 V).
[/quote]


----------


If your simply looking to change some settings, I think it's pretty straight forward having looked into it a bit a playing around with the software. Phsicaly it should just be USB port on your windows machine to the USB port on your (master ) VESC. I have seen some reports of issues connecting with a USB 3.0 port and directing users to use USB 2.0, but that seems strange. Hopefully it isn't a problem because the only machine I have with a USB 2.0 port is an Nokia Booklet from 2010, and it's freaking slow.  I don't yet have the ability to physically connect as I'm waiting on my right angle adapter. I started a thread related to Raptor specific VESC programming. Maybe you could post more specifics about what you are looking to accomplish, or difficulties your having, there.

Edit. I don't know whey this didn't show as a reply. Edited to add the @Xusia to the top.

Mono Rapter pulley rubbing. Noise is more pronounced when riding. Unfortunately that angle is not adjustable, unless you bend it. Which I did bend back, then after riding for half an hour the noise came back. Also when this happens, it loosens the belt tension, and allows the belt to skip teeth, which is dangerous. The mono motor is a great and powerful motor, unfortunately it is mounted on a week bracket. Mind you I was not riding aggressively. With the sensitivity of the controller and that great torque, the drivetrain suffers severely. This to you Onloop.

**The flanges on the motor pulley need to be there!, they hold the belt in position, they are meant to touch the belt.**

The fact that you can move the mount so much tells me the bolts are too loose. Please take the time to check over the fixtures to ensure they are done up tightly...

After further review of the **loose bolt issue** I think I have identified the problem. In some of the motor mounts we received in the last batch, there was an excessive amount of tapping lubricant inside the bolt holes. Normally the anodizing process would remove this and leave a nice clean hole.

Coincidently we switched anodizing factories on this batch too, so maybe they have a different method of cleaning. or just not as thorough. Their anodizing is definitely better though :joy:

Anyway, it would appear that the thread locker never set properly due to the excess lubricant.

I strongly recommend that the two bolts that hold the motor clamp be removed, holes cleaned out with de-greaser and bolts reinstalled with fresh thread lock.

Lol Onloop please tell me your not as simple minded as the replys you just gave me. No one is saying the motor pulley flanges aren't supposed to be there. What I am saying is that the belt shouldn't rub on the flange that way. Rubbing like that generates heat, and could easily snap the belt on a long ride. Onloop take your time and look at my post. The mount is NOT loose I can assure you that. That creaking noise in the video is the bushing on the truck, NOT a loose screw. That video was demonstrating how the mount is incorrectly positioned causing that noise. Stop dodging facts.

I'm pretty sure thread locking the bolts on the motor mount would fix your problem. Your diagram even points to that as being the fault with the angle occurring where the truck meets the mount. 

If your two bolts holding the mount onto the truck become loose, the mount will no longer be straight, hence the belt rubbing.

You are correct sir. Only one thing, ALL bolts/screws have threadlocker and haven't come loose since. I dont see why its so hard to understand the concept of something bending smh... For your information i was the original post that told everyone to check their decks for threadlocker. The threadlock issue was only my first with this board.

I am not trying to update the firmware.  I am only trying to update the settings as advised by Jason, and change the drive control mode (to hopefully make it easier to go slower at a steady pace and to make the cruise control more functional).  However, at this point I am dead in the water.  The software does not appear to be compatible with Windows 10 (I've tried 2 machines so far), and the virtual com port driver JUST. DOES. NOT. WORK.  SOOOOOOO frustrating...

I think it's really awesome of Jason to arrange for personal help with the BLDC tool, but unless I can get the VCP (virtual com port) driver working, it's worthless.  Something that seems so simple to do just shouldn't be this hard (it connects via USB - why isn't it just recognized??).  THAT's one of the troubles with open source stuff though.  I know there are a lot of positives to open source, and generally speaking, I'm a fan, but there *ARE* negatives as well.

I guess I'll just wait...  :frowning:

Move your motor mount 2mm closer to the wheel, that should solve your angle issue.

Actually any closer and the belt would touch the wheel. When the motor is not parallel to the truck axle, the belt will always try and move(in my case rubbing on the pulley flange).  Moving the motor assembly side to side isn't going to fix an unparalleled issue.

You seem capable and I guessing you might already have tried, in case you haven't, did you try compatibility mode? I haven't read about this solving issues with BLDC, it's just a thought. I have an old Nokia Booklet that I installed Windows 10 on before advised. I had to run the graphics driver installation in Windows 7 compatibility mode to install it. Their was a newer driver trying to install, but it didn't work. The installation would fail for the old driver when done normally. After installation the driver works fine, for me, in Windows 10. 

If you have tried it, was it for installation and running it, or just one or the other? Anyhow, its just a thought. I've seen other's reporting no issues with BLDC on Windows 10 at the same time as some reports of issues. Maybe you can find a solution.

Ok Ive been riding some more and I feel the controller does only have an all go or nothing set up like some of the others owners have commented on. Appreciate that Onloop is saying the controller works in mm, but mm from 0,straight to full throttle. Thats how it feels.

When I bench test the cruise funcrion it seems to only stay on the top speed. This seems to be on the track as well. There doesnt seem to be a cruise setting that can be feathered up to. It just cruises only on full throttle. This has to be incorrect.

Oh and that grip tape hurts.😬 Im running out of bandaids,

i just hooked it up to the battery the first time and unfortunately i experience exactly the same.
it's either full throttle or no throttle at all. with the slightest movement of the throttle stick it goes full speed.

i'll check if switching the channel or rebinding the remote is helping. (edit: switching channels didn't)

edit: not sure if this is relevant. the receiver inside the board is always flashing red quickly when the remote is not powered on. when the remote is powered on the red blinking stays but slows down. the remote itself shows a red light on the left side and a green light on the right.

could someone with a working throttle check if it's the same for them please?

Receiver
Fast blinking red LED = signal from controller OK
Slow blinking red LED = signal from controller NOT OK

**EDIT: at least that's how my receiver works, @Howser informed me his blinks slow when there's a signal from the controller...**
 
Controller
Left LED is red = signal to receiver OK
Left LED is green = signal to receiver NOT OK
Left LED is blinking green = cruise control engaged

God how I hate this inverted Chinese logic. Green led should be a sign that all is well and red should indicate lost connection.

Changing channels will only help improve reception, you'll need to change settings in the VESC to get the most out of it.
PM me if you need help.

I challenge anyone to try can keep a constant speed of 12mph, or 14mph or 18mph or 25mph. The point is that you can't, while litterally moving my finger half a mm every time, I was only able to obtain a constant 15mph, 20mph, then 28mph. There is no in between Onloop. Go ahead make a video mr perfect rider(Onloop), because I know you can't. So sad that Onloop is trying to play everyone for a fool. Not me Onloop, I'm on to you

I stand by my statement that the controller works fine. In fact this controller is also used by several other electric skateboard brands. 

also here is the evidence of it working:

this was filmed just two days ago, starting from stationary positions, accelerating without problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgKPCrG5Nyc

in this video i come to a complete stop, then accelerate again at a gradual pace
https://youtu.be/o_5Bh4zceGQ?t=45s

here is another video showing the controller working perfectly, apply the brake, then starting again. all in a controlled manner.
https://www.instagram.com/p/_lYcMtgW7e/?taken-by=enertionboards

So I have no doubts about this controller.


So what is going on then? Help me to help you. 
-------------------------
Some possibilities
1. Your controller is faulty.
2. You are using it wrong.
3. You are simply not used to OR not expecting the power of the Raptor so you think it's out of control.
4. The trimming in the VESC needs adjusting to better suit your requirements.
5. The signal is really bad between the RX & TX and you are actually missing data.
( I have already said i would send new lids to EVERYONE)

If you like I will buy you a GT-2B and send that too. I am here to make you all happy and I refuse to stop until you all have a fucking smile on your faces.

Jason, I think you made a solid choice with the remote.  The signal issues - at least for me - seem to all be related to the lid.  Outside of that, YES, I am definitely NOT used to the torque output.  This is my first electric skateboard.  Perhaps that's the crux of the issue, but for me I'd like something that delivered the initial power more softly but ramps up to full power.  This is not because I don't like the power or don't want to accelerate.  Rather, it's because I don't ALWAYS want to go fast.  I'd love to get the cruise control to work at something close to a steady 8mph so I just cruise & carve, but I simply can't do that.

Going back to my first statement, this isn't a criticism about the remote.  I think it's something that can be handled in software, either by changing the drive mode, or by modifying the sensitivity of the remote to something less linear.  I plan to play around with those settings and see if I can get it more to where I like it.

Try "soft rpm", it helped me a lot. It eases into the 3 speeds that we have (15mph, 20 mph, 28mph). So much better. Only problem is since the throttle curve is so bad, you'll never be able to ride at 8mph consistently. I'm sure there is a way to fix that curve, but nobody knows how.

It's definitely a combination of #2, 3 and 4. The trim was perfect for me. I think a lot of people are thinking of this as a casual board like the other Eboards on the market and it's not that... Which is why I purchased it. You can slowly accelerate in mm it just takes sensitivity. I even walked my 2 lb dog on leash with it and didn't ever accelerate to hard to hurt him. It just takes time and practice.

My instructions to reduce the aggressive low-speed power of the raptor.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*NOTE: please test with lid off first! This is to make sure your problem is not related to poor signal, if nothing changes with the lid off & the signal seems responsive its fair to assume you can get some results with the below instructions.*

**1. Reduce motor current.** 
- See "Motor Max" change this to 40
- To reduce the brake force, change "Motor min (regen)" - this is also rider weight dependent. Maybe try -10 or -20 to get it perfect you will need to use trial & error.

**2. Re-tune or customize the PPM settings.**
- Adjust the "Soft RPM Limit" settings
- Increase the Deadband

Watch this video too:

**3. Limit Top Speed using RPM limits**
You might also try setting the ERPM Limit Start at **20000** This will start limiting the Speed at around 10km... Could be a good idea until you get your bearings.
Otherwise maybe try these settings below... 
Its really up to you. You can tune this to meet your expectations.

That video is great.  I literally just got done changing my settings and was going to post my findings when I saw it.  Although I was able to figure it out, that video explains it very well.  I simply cannot express how much better the remote is for me after making those changes.  I recommend everyone isn't 100% satisfied with the remote WATCH THAT VIDEO AND MAKE THOSE CHANGES.  What a difference it made for me.  Seriously!

I only changed the deadband & min/max pulsewidth and now I can cruise at slower speeds at a steady pace.  I'm SOOO happy!!

One thing I will say is that my min & max are far different from those in the video, but it looks like he has a different remote altogether (I could be wrong).  Anyway, my remote min was 1.14 (I used 1.15 as the min pulsewidth), my max was 2.08 (I used 2.15 as the max pulsewidth), and I set the deadband to .17.  The default settings were deadband .15, min, 1, max 2.  So changing the numbers even slightly has a pronounced effect.

Thanks again to Jason and Enertion for making such a great board.  Not only does it outperform the competition, but you can also customize it to your liking.  Perfect!!

EDIT:  A few things I thought of that might help others edit their settings:
1.  The firmware version on my VESC is 1.14, so the download link provided by Jason previously did not work.  Another VERY helpful dude pointed me here which worked:  http://vesc.net.au/BLDC-TOOL/Windows/OLD%20Versions/

2.  Make sure you install the STM drivers FIRST.  And NOTE:  There are 2 installs (read the readme!!).  Once this is done, connect the battery to the board and turn it on, then connect the VESC to the computer using a mini-USB cable.  You should hear the normal sound when connecting a USB device, and Device Manager should show the Virtual Com Port.  If not, you have a problem with either the driver or the connectivity (my prob was a bad cable).   After that it's just a matter of running the BLDC_TOOL.exe.

3.  I had trouble reading the configuration until I went to the Realtime Data tab and checked the "Activate sampling" box.  That seems to get the communication working and I was able to read the config (NOTE:  You seem to need to read the config on each page!).

Again, I hope this helps.

I wanted to keep this separate from my previous post.  For those that were potentially interested in the other control modes, Here is what I found:

Duty Cycle
Better than the "Current no reverse with brake" default settings, but after making the changes to the default settings I liked "Current no reverse with brake" better.

PID Speed Control
VERY good if you really just want to go slow.  Allows for very precise speed control at slower speeds, but top speed was down significantly.  Here again, I didn't try very hard to fix this by playing with the settings (or trying PID Speed Control No Reverse), so perhaps that's possible.  One thing about this mode I did not like at all about this mode is that when the control stick is neutral it means speed=0.  In other words, the board applies the brakes to achieve 0mph, so no coasting.

Hopefully this helps others.  I'm happy to answer any questions.

@Xusia man oh man this is reassuring news... I've been feeling sick for the last few days thinking over everything thats been happening... 

The ability to customize your ride is why the VESC is so awesome...THANK YOU BENJAMIN VEDDER!
Also, None of us are the same, we all have different expectations & reactions to inputs from the world around us.

I remember my first eboard build, I had to detune everything in the Alien/Flier ESC otherwise i would shit my pants.... I suppose that's what's partly what's happening to many of you guys too.. the standard settings are just way to aggressive...But i do feel confident that in a week or so you will feel very natural on the Beast Raptor!

ALSO, I never rode your boards on the street, So I could only program the VESC with settings I have on my board. So I suppose what we are learning is that the remotes have all got their own "personality" in terms of the "trimming" so they really all need to be programmed separately.

So now the question is, how do I build a rig that allows me to ride every customers raptor, to finely tune the PPM, without getting it super dirty? 

Maybe I need to invest in a treadmill. This way I can check the Pulsewidth settings, ride the board to make sure it's working properly, and not get it dirty

Here's a video I made to hopefully help others:  https://youtu.be/g96Vegbz-SM

The first part is about the cable.  If you are like me, you probably have a ton of those cables lying around.  Rather than buy the right-angle adapter, I just dissected one of those.  It's really easy and only takes a couple minutes.

The second part shows where to make the changes and the results of the new settings.  It's only on the bench, but you still see remarkable results.  I also tested it in my garage, and while that's not really what I'd consider a good test, it was enough to validate the results.  It really is SOO much better!  I can't wait to try it out when the rain stops and ground dries (so, in like 2 months...  KIDDING!  But it *is* Oregon...).

Again, I'm happy to answer any questions if people have them.

I think we all know that this is a learning curve for some of us, and you could only really set it up as you ride. Dont think there is a way for you to test each new board. Plus the fact I dont think theres that many hrs in your day to do that, even with help.

The one thing I gathered with the boosted is it has the 4 settings on the remote which give the rider instant control. I could not just let a stranger use my Raptor in fear of injury.

I understand your baby has a few niggles, but it looks like there is hope. Ive got another board now to do all my beginner testing with the full Raptor 1.0  ready for blasting when were all comfortable with the speed.

We all want it to be a success, and I think thats why we are sharing on here our niggles. I dont think anyone with one of these boards is wanting to aim their frustration on you or the company. It does show with what Xusia is saying that maybe the contoller is not set up the way you think for other users which was what Nasty was also trying to say. IMO

Based on what I saw and what others have described, my theory is that each remote is just a bit different.  The numbers that worked for me, might not work perfectly for someone else.  But I didn't have to ride the board to find those settings.  I found them fairly easy on the "bench," and I think Jason could easily do the same.  I don't think it would take that much time, and I think it would be time well spent.

While generic settings "work" they don't present the product in it's best light.  Also of concern (I would think) is that this is a higher level of performance than virtually all other boards, and therefore the difference between "works" and "works well" can be significant.

so i'm off to the mall now to get one of those USB angles and see if something shows in the setup that's out of the ordinary. i lost overview of the posts so could someone tell me if I only have to plug in the USB to one VESC or repeat the process for both? thanks!

i don't want to start this topic again but my problem seems of a different nature.
it's impossible to keep my board at a steady speed other then full speed. after 1mm of stick movement it wants to accelerate to 100% speed. keeping the thumb steady in such a tiny margin on a moving platform is not doable. the riding tips video of onloop cruising at the beach at lower speeds, or in the promo where the guys cruising at the mall? simply not possible with my board due to this.

but i'm confident i can adjust this behavior with the guides posted so far. will post the results!

@xusia 's video and comments make it clear we should have a lot of flexibility for getting the control behavior modified to our likeing.

You'll only need program the master VESC on your Raptor dual.

I've linked all the "numbers" posts from this thread and Raptor Specific VESC information here :
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/enertion-raptor-understanding-vesc-programing-defaults-effects-of-making-changes/1319?u=thomwithah

It's my hope that people will share their Raptor specific VESC programing information there. I hope to keep it about the numbers, and results, so that is the go to sorce for this type of information and troubleshooting.

May I also suggest car door edge trim from Autozone for the LCD? I use them for my Space Cell enclosures and its surprisingly helpful in protecting it from the elements. I've ridden through very harsh Michigan weather recently and it holds up.

That's impossible with the raptor and the remote settings! The torque isn't the problem. It's the unpredictable communication between controller and VESC.

 I own an evolve skateboard  and I've been very impressed with the durability and the way the skateboard behave , everything is under control and predictable !! but the only thing is missing is a little bit of speed !! 35km/h is nice but 45km/h  it would be super !! .   That's why I was looking forward to buy the raptor . But  after reading what happen with the first batch I thought it would be huge mistake !!!  Now don't get me wrong I know enertion  is high-quality . what's worrying me , is I know the raptor is not ready yet for a friendly user mode , like my evolve skate  that you don't need to worry about configuration and what not !  You just hop on the board and you're good to go ! 

So here's my dilemma . what enertion Will do for the second ,3th, 4th,5th .... and the future batch  Of raptors ???  Because trust me this product has huge potential !! But if enertion cannot spare me this whole programming thing and the few issues that we saw this passed day!! Ex  battery not working ,  Remote control lossing signal , falling motors !! Lol ( sorry but that was a good one ) .  All this potential will be lost  and it will be sad,  because now evolve is not doing anything that run 45 km an hour . 

So what will you do for the future of the raptor !!  Because I could be one of your future customers and many more !! ;)

The main thing I'd take into account is that this is Enertion's first production electric skateboard-

Look at teslas first car, the roadster: It was plagued with some early production issues, but after revamping and creating the model S, they are now a super successful company. 

Or look at marbel, another eboard that was funded insanely fast in kickstarter.. they had parts falling off inside the deck, motors coming apart (because of a screw issue) and motors burning out. That said, after the first month of issues, they made sure everyone had solid customer support and eliminated the issues on all the boards since. 

Long story short, just because there are problems with bringing something new and large scale to the market right now, doesn't mean those problems with remain during batch 2 and so on.

We know the CF lid affects remote range, and that all new lids will be fiberglass, eliminating that issue.

I also know (from more testing done today) that the remote settings make a HUGE difference.  We don't yet know how Jason will handle this, but we do know that good settings can be found (I'll post my results separately).  I can't say enough how big of a difference this has made for me, and I believe every Raptor owner can benefit from adjusting these settings.  So this is yet another problem more-or-less solved.  (you don't want to have to do it yourself - I get that!)

I would also add that this is not Honda Civic, or even a Porsche.  It's more like a Dodge Viper.  Tons of power and no electronic nanny's to help you manage it.  And the more power you have just in general, the more control issues you will have.  I don't know if you've driven cars with VERY high horsepower (like 700+) but daily drivers they are not - I don't care what the manufacturer may claim.  Such cars are beasts, as is the Raptor, and they are not for everyone.  What I'm saying is you can't have a super high performance board, and expect it to behave sedately.  It's just not going to happen.

Last thought:  Have you considered the Raptor Mono?  Based on my testing today, I'm very seriously considering a custom build based on the Enertion mono motor/setup.  The only real difference I can see is the massive torque off the line.  But if you don't need that, meaning, you don't need to blast off the line, the dual is kind of a waste in my opinion.  The top speed of the Mono is the same (27mph), and it still goes up steep hills better than a Boosted Dual+, so not sure what more would really be needed.  The positive of Mono, I believe (not having tested it personally), is that it should have more predictable acceleration and control than the dual.  Would it meet your needs?  I can't say for sure, but I think it's very likely.

 I agree with all of you !!! but think about something imagine your kid look at your board and he said I want to go for a ride !! what you going to say!  hold on I got a hook up the raptor to my computer first  so I can change the settings and five hours later you can say to your kid OK go ahead but be careful with the break they are very sensitive !! because is like driving a viper and you can get killed  !!so be careful I'm not sure if is going to break Lol !!! 

When you all  saw the preview  of the raptor  like a week or so!
I'm sure in the back of your head you thought the guy who made the raptor have a lot of experience he been working for like more than a year on this project,he tested the raptor in all possible ways ??? But what happen!!! You guy  almost kill yourself and you did pay him good money  !!! Right!! And don't get me wrong if I'm a businessman i'll test my product first to make sure if safe  and if it is I'll sell it !! 

 So my next question is did he really test the final product that he sold you or  he was too busy making money and he said this fool will test it for me ????? 

 This is nothing personal , is because I feel bad for you guys for what happened because that guy could it be me !!!

This is the first batch.  Issues are to be expected (at least in my opinion), but so far I have not encountered anything that I think is gross negligence.  Jason has been very open and honest and all the details are in this thread.  There are some scenarios he didn't account for, but for every issue he has offered solutions.  Some involve me doing the work, which may not be for everyone, but what's the alternative?  Send it back so he can update it?  That would take a while and cost money, so in this case I'd much rather do it myself (I also enjoy learning and playing around, even when it's occasionally frustrating).

To answer your question about kids, my 8-year old son asked me if he could try it and I said "Hell no!"  I did let him try a friend's self-balancing scooter (aka hoverboard), and he did fine with it, so it's not like I'm a worry wart or over protective.  It's just that like my motorcycle, this particular board is not a toy and it's not suitable for all ages.  If you want an electric skateboard a kid can ride, I've seen some kid-friendly models for ~$160 on Amazon.  They go like 6mph.

I have several boards that my kids as well as my friends don't get to ride. I built a board specific for my 6 year old son that won't go faster than 15mph. That's called responsibility. Fact is, our boards aren't 12v ride on toys.

NOT impossible!  Proof!!!

https://youtu.be/hZvSDTrGEWc

The next couple days are SUPPOSED to be rain free, so hopefully I can get some video in a more appropriate environment (that would be OUT-SIDE) to really show it off.  As I state in the video, I am literally BLOWN AWAY at how much of a difference optimizing the settings have made.  The board is totally controllable and a pleasure to ride.

I don't feel like making a complete tutorial on how I derived my settings (the method in the video Jason posted didn't get me totally dialed in), but:

 1. One thing I will say is that I found I needed the forward motion
    range on the remote stick to be .55 or greater or it was too
    sensitive.  For example, the "neutral" value on my remote was
    reading 1.55.  Adding .55 to this results in 2.1, which is the value
    I used for the Max Pulsewidth.  Any lesser value and it was too
    sensitive.
 2. I'm happy to answer questions.

Hi Ermac

I fully understand this dilemma & I suppose it's the same question everyone ask themselves before they buy anything. Can I trust this Brand/Company/Person etc... when it boils down buying/selling is all about trust.

Let me tell you a story about myself & enertion. 

I am not the kinda guy who sits on his hands and does nothing... I promise you, I am not sitting at my desk counting my fortune either. In fact, in most cases there is no money in the bank. Because every single dollar that is generated from selling products has all gone back into R&D, building better products, buying larger quantities to get better deals & building a better business. It might surprise you but I don't actually draw a wage from this business and I probably won't anytime soon! There is too much more to achieve and money doesn't make me happy anyway.. Innovating, designing and building cool shit is what makes me happy,.

enertion is only about 20months old. The first year was really only focused on making motor mounts & learning as much as I could about the technology & the engineering...  I also spent a lot of time blowing up other people electronics...  learning from mistakes, mine & others,  is what I excel at.

**Here is the first ever board I built. It's a piece of shit, But I learned a lot from it**
http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/uploads/db1493/optimized/1X/be97075a48b9e1ad1b2c2541d5df533ca91241cd_1_179x500.jpg


**This was the next evolution, it looked nice, but wasn't good enough.**
https://www.instagram.com/p/rdd-jQAW4I/?taken-by=enertionboards


**Now we are here, it looks great & performance is market leading, but some minor teething problems**
https://www.instagram.com/p/-k4rkXgWw2/?taken-by=enertionboards


**So use your imagination, look at what I have achieved in 20 months.. ask yourself what will be next?.**


This progression has all happened because of my relentless hunger to build the best electric skateboard ever made, I am also extremely passionate about growing the "self-built eboard industry".... I now have a product that 'on paper'  beats all/most of the competition. Yeah, First batch was not 100% perfect yet, some *very minor* problems & some *very silly mistakes* on my behalf have made the last week one of the toughest I've had in the last 20 months, it was gut wrenching.. Do I know where I went wrong? YES!!

So do people really think I'm just going to hang up the gloves and let these teething problems be the end of my dream? No way! I am far from done in my pursuit to make the best eboard! If anything has come from this less than desirable Raptor launch, it is that good is not good enough.. I need to do better.. & I will. **You are only as good as your harshest critic.**

*I also need to keep reminding myself that if this was easy everyone would have done it..  Also, I don't have hundreds of thousands of dollars from crowd-funding campaigns...* 

This image I posted on my Instagram account last year is a perfect example of what drives me... doing great things, being the underdog... I am certainly not finished.
https://www.instagram.com/p/6zD_YNgWxJ/?taken-by=enertionboards


**A summary of improvements to be made in the 2nd batch**
1. No pure CF lids as it block the signal. (all first batch customers will get a new lid at end of the month)
2. Customize each VESC PPM settings, don't copy them generically across each Raptor.
3. Utilise the VESC Soft Voltage Limit so that the boards doesn't shut down rapidly due to voltage sag when bat is low.
4. *Maybe* reduce the motor current slightly so it is less wild on startup.
5. *Maybe* reduce the brake strength so it is softer.
6. Double Check that all the bolts are properly installed & the thread locker is set & secure.

These are all really easy things to implement, there is no extra cost or labour required.

Some near future improvements.
1. Phone app for changing VESC settings without cable. Will have presets: beginner/advanced.
2. IP68 rated electronics enclosure. Raptor will be entirely water proof.
3. Battery option with 33% greater capacity.

anyway.. i hope this solves your dilemma.

Xusia !! you are a good man !  And I see that you're very positive person and honestly I admire that ! and I'm happy that your issue with the board is almost solved!!! :) but what about everybody else? 

I know enertion will do something!!  
but specifically what??? 
I think everybody  Deserve to know what's going to happen with the new batch of raptor???  So this is a special question for Mr. Enertion?
 Because hell yeah I want to ride a raptor ! but before buying one I want to make sure they wont be no surprise! Lol   Is like when you bought your PS4 you were expecting to play call duty All the weekend not thinking  if there is a piece of Harward missing inside the console !!  I thing you all get the point :)
 
 so If i spend 1500$ on the raptor  what i should expect from the next batch????

Great informative post @onloop. I think it answers anyone's questions about your plans for the 2nd batch and your brand in general. 

Does this forum support polls? I don't see a way to do it.

I'm curious what current owners think about the "maybes" (#4 & #5) from the list above. It would seem to me from @xusia's latest video that motor current may be a non-issue. As well, I've not seen anyone terribly upset with the braking performance of the Raptor, or its remote. Do any current Raptor owners feel that #4 and/or #5 from the list should make it into the next batch of Raptors?

@Ermac-514 what would you like to see from Enertion that hasn't already been committed to? Do you want a board that does 70 KM/h and is safe for kids? Honestly, I haven't seen them ever saying "no," or "we can't" (or won't) do that. Sometimes they say "give us time," but never flat out "no." So, what would you have them do? You'd make it a lot easier on them by saying exactly what you want. That way they could try to deliver on it. At least they'd know what you want, specifically.

I don't think anyone who bought a Raptor in the first batch was concerned with letting children or novice e-Sk8 riders on their machines. Like was said, it's not responsible to do so. Now, it seems that eventually there will be a phone app to potentially allow for responsible sharing of these high performance machines. That's great!  More features, I'm sure, will be welcomed.

to be honest, the raptor is already enjoyable... I have been riding one for 6 months already.. the problem was I had never built 30 of them before..  so stuff got missed... normally when I build a board I ride it, then I change settings if I don't like it... the problem here was I didn't ride any of these boards before shipping... I assumed that copying my settings across were correct..  but i was wrong, each one needs to be tuned more than i expected...

anyway here is the video showcasing the product...  honestly the raptor is a nice board to ride... You might also be interested to know that the guy in this video **it was his first ever ride on a raptor the actual day of filming** He had never ridden an electric skateboard before making this video.

 This is only a suggestion . it would be a good thing to make few videos with different scenarios and settings so you can show to everybody step-by-step how you Tune the raptor properly but not the kind of video that you can barely see the screen !  I really mean step-by-step video like ((raptor  for dummies )) lol  and honestly that simple thing will give a lot of confidence to everyone and in the case somethings is wrong with the settings there's no problem  !!  Because your tutorial is easy to follow so everybody can get back in track fast !  Also you could include the software for the pc  in the box with the raptor .

I thought I'd add that my order number was 1343 and my S/N ends with 34 if that helps is establish a pattern.  Has anyone been able to weigh their lids yet?

onloop has offed 2 paid hours of VESC customization for current Raptor owners. This is amazing and should provide more confidence than even the best made videos! It's personalized "hand holding" for Raptor owners and their VESC / BLDC programing needs. 

Considering that you can't buy a Raptor, really, without Internet access it's not truly necessary to provide the software in the box. That said, I have suggested a Raptor toolbox to include just that. The thread is here:

http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/raptor-toolkit-esk8-toolkit-should-enertion-offer-one/1323

I've started a thread dedicated to Raptor VESC programing in the mean time. It's my hope that this thread will become a kind of "Raptor for Dummies and Smarties" as people add there findings during their paid customization service and own trial and error. That thread is here:

We get that someone shouldn't have to change settings on their remote to ride at lower speeds, but at the same time, why does being a good sport about it make him blind.. 

I'm not a Raptor owner, but I honestly don't see anything more Jason could have done to fix the problem- from the new lids, videos, constant replies, and 2 hours of VESC support, I think the situation has been handled quite well and he has made sure every knows that he backs his product. 

I don't blame you for being mad, but at the same time, he is doing everything in his power to fix the problems presented to him.

I dont think you do get it. Just to name one problem, Xusia's video showed how he can go in low speed,. But not everyone realizes that he could not keep/maintain that slow speed. You can easily hear the motors ramping up, so that means he never held the board at a slow speed. Which means you would have you feather the throttle to keep a desired speed. *Yes guys that means at high speeds as well*. Maybe i just have high standards when it comes to throttle response, i guess safety isn't everything. Ive driven Honda civics, semi trucks, motorcycles, and Ferrari's, and yes they all have different throttle responses. But one thing remains the same, i am able to control what speed i want to go, and you can't with this board!(guys its that simple).   Your right Onloop is doing a great job, but listen there are terms and agreements for this Raptor that Onloop is simply not following.

In my humble opinion, #4 is not needed if the remote settings are optimized, and #5 is a matter of preference.  If you are an aggressive rider - which I am not - you will probably need the brake settings as they were.  For me, it was a bit much.  I changed the setting from -60 to -40 (a reduction in braking force) and I was much happier.

I'm a bit confused here.  I don't recall seeing any terms or conditions, other than the 300 day money back & 600 day repair guaranties.  He has offered you several solutions to fix the board, so he has covered the 600 day repair guarantee.  Did you ask for your money back and he refused??  Or are you referring to something else entirely?  Can you be specific?  Exactly what terms and agreements are you talking about?

I never went public with the matter, because I respected him. But after him not responding to that specific request twice, how would you take that? Trust me now that it has gone public, he will do the right thing. My point is he should've done the right thing from the start.

Please stop complaining so much about it, I want to read problems & solutions!!! Enertion is a 20 month person work and or home industry (better term than company). The reason of existence is to help DIY community and Raptor is their very first complete line of production. Buying one of these without the knowledge of DIY'ers are risk it's self, you got to have a leap of faith and trust. Pretty sure you all have to take risk in buying from small business compared to big commercial companies. Also one of the few key reason of going for raptor is performance and tweakability. If flawless is you're looking for (45km/h longboard), that simply doesn't exist unless you build one your self. I personally have VESC from Enertion and it broke after 7 minutes for no reason, disappointed, but I could understand if they can't refund. It's a prototype and if I have my own company building not ready things for people, I don't want to do RMA since things can go wrong in many ways. Stating the problem over and over doesn't solve your issue. The topic of the discussion is problems and solutions, not problems problems problems and ego.

What I believe as improper from Enertion side is that they are not ready to sell raptor yet months ago. The remote is one of the final adjustment placed within production time. There are already major delay in remote shipment and parts, then ofc as a company you want to send your products asap. Take your time, relax be patient, pretty sure any industries don't want to have bad reviews over their product and surely the owner / responsible person would take actions from it. You might be not the only one with issues, there are more people when 1 part of the product is going wrong. All of the customer would have the same issue! so give Enertion abit more time to solve their and look up into yours.

Hi NASTY,

I don't fully understand why you refuse to make any effort to implement the recommended changes with the settings to get your problems resolved. There is now plenty of evidence proving that this resolves the acceleration issues & I have offered you free support to help you do it!! 
Do you update your iphone with new software patches when they get released? Probably not.

Regarding the video where you are moving the motor mount back & forth with one finger, it's clear that you need to tighten up some fixtures.. But once again you seem to not want to do anything that might make things better.

So here are your options..

1. Submit an RA, Post the board back to me, minus the battery (you can't send the battery back due to aviation regulations) & ill refund the money minus the battery cost.
2. Find someone on here (or anywhere) who wants a new raptor and who is willing to take it off your hands. I will offer them your board at a heavily discounted price of $1000USD. Then I will refund you your entire order amount.

Please negotiate with nasty to ensure he wants to go through with this. If he does ill contact you and you will pay me directly for the board. I will then refund nasty & he will ship it.

@Ermac-514 How much more videos are you looking for? I believe the amount of videos we have + photos are already sufficient enough. The support and the service for the product is also great. If you want it, just order it! You will never truly understand the feeling of it from videos. The components are transferable for sure as it's also sold as parts, but you will need new case, accompanying decks and compatible wheels and trucks for sure.

Removing the cover over the battery has made all the difference as far as losing signal. I don't have the problem unresponsive movements of the throttle and after about two hours of riding no more "shorts" where the signal would just stop then start again. Phenomenal up and down the hills there is almost no decrease in speed.

I still have the problem that I can't cruise at 5mph the board wants to keep accelerating to max as long as I have the throttle on... But I can just pulse the throttle to go slow. 

I'll start tweaking the settings but wanted to put hours on the board without the battery cover as u guys suggested. Confidence restored regarding the connection issue so far :)

have the battery off, and then plug in the charger. 

The battery will then "turn in" because even if the switch is off, the LCD will be on when charging. 

So your switch won't be pressed, but the LCD will still be on while charging.

If you are using cruise control wouldn't you let off the throttle unless you "wanted" to speed up? I would assume that once you set cruise you wouldn't need to touch the throttle unless you wanted to speed up or slow down.

I've seen a few throw their hat in the ring to buy Nasty's board. I will put myself in line, if that's OK. I'd love to have this sent to my brother in the United States. Only a dual would do, and I know it would look used quick, so like new looks wouldn't be needed as long as it worked properly. Anyhow, if anything comes up with those before me which prevents their purchase I'd instantly pay to gift it to my brother.

Thanks Xusia to motivate me to get into BLDC tool! I was a bit afraid to destroy everything but you made me clear that it's easy and everyone can do it. I have just changed the PPM settings and it is a complete different board.
The speed is now controllable and the board much more predictable while accelerating.
Now Im able to hold low speed if I want. Haven't tried the cruise control yet but I will tomorrow.
Know I can just repeat what you said:
## Everyone should do these changes ##
Made another mod today to check if I could add a bit range to the controller. I came up with this because I think it looks better than one big hole :smiley:

This thread has me thinking i should stick to fiberglass boxes. 

I'm using all of these exact same parts on my boards. The entire power train, electronics, receivers, everything is basically identical to a raptor on a Scarlet except the deck and box. Even the same exact steez remote. 

I have no transceiver issues at all, but yeah, the throttle is touchy. UNTIL YOU GET USED TO IT. 

Stand on your board and ease up on the throttle until it "bubbles" then starts to move. Yes it will keep accelerating until you ease back again. It's just like a car. 

all those holes in the lid... some people are gonna be fucked when it rains.

@onloop not that I plan to hold your "feet to the fire," yet I'm hoping could you provide some details about the replacement lids. When do you think you will have them sent out buy, in terms of timeframe? Will they look like carbon fiber yet be made of fiber glass? If not, will they be solid black, or something else? Will they come with the relevant grip tape pre-applied, or something/nothing else? Just curious if you can share any more details at this point.

I have an update on the VESC voltage limits settings.  These are the settings that Jason recommended in order to prevent the BMS (Battery Management System) LVC (Low Voltage Cut-off) from kicking in.  I'm happy to report they worked most excellently!

The hill I used is the one on the way to my house.  It's a 700' elevation gain over 1.5 miles.  It's not a steady incline, so some sections are very steep while others are less steep.  The battery was at approximately 55% - 60% when I started the hill.  What I noticed was 2 things:
1.  The board slowed down (but did NOT stop!!!)
2.  In the steeper sections, the LCD fuel gauge backlight shut off, and the LCD fuel reading went to a steady 0% (it did not shut off).

The entire time the board behaved very well, and other than the slower speed I had absolutely NO ISSUES!  Thanks Jason!!

In the end, the hill consumed about 30% - 35% of my total battery capacity, so while the Raptor is definitely capable of climbing hills, doing so REALLY eats the battery.

On a side note, I've never liked going down hills on my longboard - I'm more of a cruiser guy.  And today I learned that having an electric skateboard doesn't change that.  I still don't like going down hills.  I just don't feel comfortable and my thought now is that I'm not sure ANY skateboard could change that.  So as far as my commute goes, I'm not sure what I'll do.  I may just bite it and tune the braking force a bit better for my hills, or I might just take a vehicle down the hill and use the board the rest of the way.

LOL (I assume you are teasing me)

A "little" hill absolutely does not scare me.  But you haven't seen these hills - they are far from little.  And braking is not as well tuned as propulsion. In one of my videos I mention that there seems to be only 3 levels of braking force:  1)You might have applied the brakes, but you aren't totally sure; 2)Oh yeah, there's the brake, but it's not quite enough; and 3)STOP THE BOARD RIGHT F'ING NOW!!!

I've not written it completely off.  Just considering all options.

Just teasing of course. 🙄🙃

I think you might just not be used to the sensitivity still. There's a sweet spot in there I promise. I found mine before the motor fell off. (which is getting fixed finally)

I started feeling more comfortable going down hills after I started training my brain into remembering that I went faster on flat ground. I hit 26 or 27 mph consistently on flat ground and only like 22ish downhill.

[/quote]

Let's hope we find a way to improve the braking feel beyond these three levels just as you have with acceleration. I can see myself being like you @xusia when it comes to downhill braking. I think a big part of that is understanding that there is more potential energy at any given point while facing a downhill as well as a chance at a runaway Raptor should the brakes fail and I bail.


To be completely comfortable I know I'll need to be not just comfortable with the speed of a downhill, but it's control and reliability. I can't slide to brake "on demand" (yet), so I'm mostly limited to foot braking even while going downhill. Obviously this isn't as effective as foot braking while on uphill or flats. For me, that means I'll need to trust the Raptor will have brakes I can control in order to take downhills with momentum. I'd really hate to end up bailing and sending my $1000+ Raptor off a cliff, into traffic, or anywhere more than 10 feet from myself really .

Maybe I can modify some avalanche airbag technology to protect the Raptor, people, and things (to some degree) in the event of a brake fail and bail... Actually, anyone done something like this already, anywhere?

@onloop How exactly do you wish to have your spreadsheet used. Is it so that you may track all issues from beginning to end? Or is more to track open issues? What I mean is should we bother with listing things that you've already resolved?  If, for example, someone didn't get a handle on their Raptor but you've already sent, and they received, the new one, would you want that on the list? What if you sent it but it hadn't yet been received? 

Basically do you want issues to be cleared from the list by us, by you, or to remain as a record for future reference? If they are to be cleared at what point should that happen when the issue is resolved completly, or after you've taken action to resolve the issue?

Ok took the board out again for a dusk ride because I couldnt handle looking at the board just sitting in the corner of the lounge.

Fun factor to the Max.

Theres always a but and I actually think the cruise control on my hand controller is not set correctly. When I push to a speed( at this point the lowest I think that I can handle) its not maintaining the speed. The thing is ramping up. I mean its like its as if I'm pushing the throttle forward.

Now your going to ask is this a one off. No. I tried this a few times and in actual fact the thing wanted to take off. Its not good. The cruise function is not working as it should.

It should be called the Nitro button. Which I suppose is fine if you have the confidence that you think you had enough time to throttle off and slow down. Trees don't move if I hit them when I come off.

My brakes work well.Too good. No issues with that at least.

Regen braking is good as I can see the battery indicator go up after some good downhill work.

Any ideas whats happening here.

As Tarzan asked, did you update the settings in the VESC?  If not, that should definitely be step 1.

I had the same problem with the cruise control, and I talk about in the last video I made.  The final solution (step 2) was the learn to push that button down without actually moving it forward, which I was definitely doing; and I didn't think I was until I accidentally got it right and experienced cruise control working like I expect.  It takes a bit of skill to do correctly on demand.  I'm still not perfect, but I can do it correctly about 50% - 60% of the time now on the first try.

Well up until last night I was getting use to the original settings, but found the cruise just not right at all. No Vesc play. hoping I didnt have to reset anything from factory, but it sounds like I may have to. 

Ill still give it another go this week to see how Im pressing the cruise on. But in reality to use it you push forward to accerlerate to speed and then need to push down, so it isnt good that its such a fine line to get it working then.

Wonder whether onloop can test his original settings as shipped, and show on video on the test track. In any event it sounds like the remote settings are slightly different.

Yes they are different.
It's just a tiny bit but it makes a massive difference. It isn't a very easy fix so just do it :D 
It is more then worth the effort.
Download bldc tool in version 1.14
Read the readme! There is the right channel you have to use if I'm correct it ends with 301.
Connect your VESC 
Read settings
And do the pulse adjustment from the video!
Write settings
Done

=> perfect throttle feel!

Well thats what I was wondering. Im slowly getting use to the full on throttle,  but the cruise is an issue.  Ill try testing again to see whether its me pushing it down incorrectly.  Is anyone else having problems maintaining a constant speed on cruise mode? Im very much a person who tries not to touch things if I can avoid it.  I know I can change that Vesc mapping,  but want to keep settings to factory as it was meant to be.

Well you could get an adapter to connect to Vesc,   but you would need to cut another hole for the plug to fit on the cover.  Definately an option if you ok with drilling additional holes in it.

@Dedbny, in regards to the cruise control, I have found it very difficult to press the stick down while simultaneously keeping the stick "throttle" position constant.  Also, unlike the cruise control in a car, it won't increase the throttle to maintain speed.  It's really more of a "throttle lock" (if you ride motorcycles, you will likely know what a throttle lock is).  What this means in practical terms is that your speed is always going to vary *somewhat*, because the conditions are always changing:  Surface variations (rough vs. smooth pavement, gravel, dirt, etc.), wind, slope, etc., affect your speed.  It takes more power to go uphill, into the wind, over rough pavement or gravel, etc., so if your power is constant because of throttle lock, you will lose speed.  Likewise, when the conditions are more favorable, such as a tail wind, smooth pavement, etc., you will speed up.

Additionally, I have found that some speeds are just harder to maintain than others.  For me keeping in the 8-10mph range is really difficult - even just trying to keep a constant throttle manually (try it!!); I'm always making small adjustments.  Whereas, at 3-5mph, it seems very easy to keep within that speed.  Your results may vary.

Bottom line, I've just stopped trying to use the cruise control.  On the bright side, though, I'm getting fairly skilled at using the remote and manipulating the throttle manually.  It's far less dramatic...  :smile: 

In regards to the VESC settings, the specific settings we are talking about are not really "factory" settings.  Jason just did what we've done:  Adjusted the settings, tested, and re-adjusted.  Then he copied those settings to your VESC.  The problem is your remote is slightly different, so the settings that were dialed in on his remote **may** not be ideal for your remote.  I'll say this again - from experience - unless you are **1000%** satisfied with the way the remote works, you ***need*** to adjust these settings!!!  It is the safe and responsible thing to do.

The cruise control seems to be inconsistent at low speed, I am now discussing this with the factory to see if they can fix anything in firmware. 

Also, I have sent a hand controller to Benjamin Vedder (VESC Designer) to see if there are some vesc options to help the cruise control function better.

he also tells me of progress regarding the Wii controller he has designed specifically for the VESC. If it turns out to be a reliable solution in the near term I will give everyone the option of swapping to it for use on the raptor. 

One key benefit is It has much more advanced controls in the VESC firmware which allow you to perfectly tune the ramping, so you can really fine tune the timing of acceleration & cruise control parameters.

@Xusia, im gonna try one more time. You keep dodging the fact that the acceleration is the issue. The cruise will not work due to the acceleration problem. (Bench test) On BLDC, under PPM, when the percentage is at 50% on the remote, this means there is ZERO acceleration. When you accelerate to approx. 58%, the motor kicks on at approx. 17,000 "electrical rpm's"(look on the Graph Tab on BLDC). Yes i know from ZERO to 17,000 electrical rpm's!(where's the in between?) So keep pressing the throttle and now you are at 60% with approx. 24,000 rpm's (again where is the in between). So from 60% to 64% the rpm's remain at 24,000(ok?). When you reach 65% you go from 24,000 rpm's to 28,000 rpm's. At 67% it jumps from 28,000 rpm's to 38,000 rpm's (holy crap). Just 2% difference and it jumped 10,000 rpm's! So last but not least, at 68% you reach around 44,000 electrical rpm's. Guess what happens when you go from 69% to 100%(as far as speed is concerned), NOTHING! You have reached you MAX speed(44,000 rpm's). Don't you see? There are too many dead spots during acceleration. Remember, there is no in between, these are the speeds that your dealt with. I really don't think the remote is the issue(unless you have the nunchuck, but that is a whole other story), i think the problem is the VESC settings. Here is a video of how acceleration should look like during bench testing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltfktAvOnk . He is using a traditional ESC, which has horrible during "take off" and and also braking sucks, BUT that acceleration is what the VESC needs.

Your not supposed to press the cruise button while accelerating, thats obviously difficult and wont even matter. Cruise control is supposed set when the VESC detects the RPM's, then holds the RPM at the number the VESC sees. Well, if you remember, we only have a limited set of rpms to work with, FIVE to be exact. Yes with the VESC we are only limited to FIVE speeds. I think the speeds are 5mph, 15mph, 18mph, 22mph, then 27mph. In case you forgot, we have 50% throttle to work with, and only get FIVE speeds. It would be DECENT if the speeds were 60%=5mph, 70%=15mph, 80%=18mph, 90% 22mph, and 100% 27mph. But NO, we only have 10%(remember 58% to 68%) to work with all FIVE speeds. I hope some engineer can fix this, because until then, IMO the VESC is not ready for the masses.

Just making an educational guess here, i don't own a raptor nor an eboard. But i'm building one and blowned up a fuck ton of vesc to have an opinion here.

If you set your throttle to a certain speed, 90% throttle for example and hit the cruise. But you are currently going 50% speed. The vesc does not know you want to cruise at 50% speed, it thinks you want to go 90% speed because you hit the cruise at 90% throttle.

So the vesc will continue to accelerate up to 90% speed... Thus the acceleration you guys are feeling.

This is a consequence of the type of control that is used (ppm), the data sent by the controller and the experience of the user.

I still don't quite understand the erpm value, rpm*npoles = erpm ?

And the sad thing is, no one has found the solution yet.

This is totally correct! The problem is, 70% is equal to 90%. You only have a speed difference from 58% to 68%, meaning you only have 10% to play with, meaning when you hit cruise, your chances are likely to go faster than you want.

@Nasty, I understand what you are saying, but my results appear different than yours.  I don't have a way to measure it, but when riding it does not feel like I have only 5 speeds.  Furthermore, my remote feels like the range is FAR greater than from 58% to 70%.  Just today I had to push it almost to the end of the stick travel to get the speed I was after (catching a bicyclist - I love that!).  Again, I can't exactly measure that, but based on my own experience riding, such as today, I have a hard time believing I hit full throttle at 70% of the stick travel (after making my adjustments).

Part of the theory I'm working on is that the forward range has a minimum width, and that anything less produces results like you talked about.  But once it has that minimum bandwidth, it's far better.  Is it perfect?  Probably not, but to really fine tune it more I think you'd need ramp scales like Jason mentioned with the nunchuck controllers (which would be sweet - I'm in if it gets going), or if there really are only a set number of speeds, you would need a lot more speeds, or you would need something that is continuously variable.

I'll be the first to admit (and I did in a post already), that I'm definitely learning here - I absolutely don't know everything - and I'm just trying to help others with what I've learned.  Despite any issues there may be with the VESC using PPM, I think the experience is better if you dial in the settings.

Maybe another option is to use a newer VESC firmware that supports FOC??  I saw a video on that it looked very controlled.

When you hit 70%, that means the top speed is now set, but only at its minimum amperage. If you hit 70% on flat level you will hit top speed. BUT it will gradually take you to top speed, rather than 100%, it will shoot you to top speed. If you were approaching a hill at 70%, you would not hit top speed, because the amperage is not there(it would just slow down). You would have to accelerate (increase the amperage) to get to that set speed. Our throttle really feels like an amperage acceleration vs an rpm acceleration. I already did this by manually setting the VESC to 70% (so i didnt use the remote to accelerate), and the board hit 27mph(gradually). I only used the remote to brake.  You might say that you have adjusted the settings to your liking, but lets be honest. who wants to feather the throttle? im not a perfectionist, but come on guys really? Without full control, its hard to get comfortable.

I think that is the case.
When you hit C, you're basically telling the controller to keep sending the same pulse it was sending when you hit C.
The VESC interpretes this into a current output to the motors and the speed of the board is determined by how level terrain is, rider weight and wind resistance.
So if you pressed C going 18mph uphill and you hit flat terrain, the board will accellerate to a new higher speed.
The VESC does not know you pressed C, it just sees pulses coming in.
However, in PID speed control mode, theoretically the VESC will try to maintain an ERPM (as opposed to a current) which corresponds to a given throttle setting, based on the max ERPM setting for that control mode. Theoretically. Can be tested.

Cruise control on the Enertion controller should be called "throttle preset" because there's no "control".

I think the controller cruise control may be the issue. I think it's more of a simple controller as far as the programming firmware goes. Hopefully, the controller does get better. An adjustable cruise control will be awesome.

BATTERY NOT TURNING ON PROBLEMS - 4 SOLUTIONS
------------------------------
If your battery doesn't turn on / stay on. We believe this is due to a bad Switch, Or loose wire onto the switch, Or loose sense wire.

**Option 1.** We send new switch & black shrink tube, you replace it DIY style.
**Option 2.** You try to return the battery to our factory in Shenzhen China. Depending on country might not be possible. They repair & return it.
**Option 3.** Send the battery to my US based Repair Agent, have the parts replaced for you. Option for US residents only.
**Option 4.** Buy one new spare battery get two brand new batteries sent, 2for1, Then use original one for spare parts or try to fix it & have 3 batteries.

Xusia "Likewise, when the conditions are more favor able, such as a tail wind, smooth pavement, etc., you will speed"

Very robust posts. I like the details as well.

All I can say from my own experience that 10% speed range thats @Nasty notes may be why I cant set cruise properly. The Vesc asjustments to the mapping should help smooth out how the speed is delivered from what @Xusia ia saying, im not worried about that.

Cruise control should now be called throttle lock untill someone actually works out the settings to make the speed constant. I dont think there Is one.

I will only make any changes as advised by Enertion and with directions. Not to void the warranty.

We are now getting comments back from those that have been playing with Vesc which now alters results. Dont have an issue with that as the results seem to be helping some. Not mine at the moment.h

In case anyone would like some pictures of the relative size of the standard and fast charges I've shared some, with a standard credit card sized card [HERE][1] .

<img src="/uploads/db1493/original/2X/b/b9912e615d310fcb9d3f0bbf03181cba275d90ef.jpg" width="345" height="194">

I've also weighed them without the removable power cords they weighed in at:

**Normal  = 287.5 Grams**, or 10.14 Ounces
**Fast      = 710.5 Grams**, or 25.06 Ounces, or 1 Pound 9 Ounces, or 1.56 Pounds

The fast charger seems to be nearly 250% heavier than the normal charger. 


----------


Since I have a charger, today, and can now charge my battery. I've begun charging. When plugged in my LCD came on and showed 88%. The green light on the charger has been on for an couple of hours now. It only took about 20 minutes for he LCD to go to 100% and 30 minutes for the charger light to go green. The documentation with the charger says I should charge for 24h the first time. **Is this 24hr required?** (It's an exercise in patience to wait, for sure.) I understand that an additional 30 minutes after green charger light is recommended, for future charges, to allow the cells to balance. What happens if this isn't done? **How often is it OK to not charge with complete cell balancing?**

*On a side note, the included instruction could definitely benefit from some editing in grammar, spelling , and structure*.

This is probably the weirdest video I have ever made about electric skateboards, But I think this video clearly demonstrates Extremely slow speed control on the raptor. So I believe that the remote control you all have is perfectly useable in this application. 

**NOTE: The speed on my phone is MPH**

The settings I selected for the PPM are MIN1.19 MAX 2.01

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEWHhwSDkug

NOTE: The cruise control function is not fool proof, it doesn't like to maintain speed if the load increases. Also if you set the speed when the motor has high load & low speed - then if the load on the motor actually decreases you start accelerating. Basically it can't maintain speed in an environment when the load is variable.

Sorry @Dedbny, let me get you up to speed.

The settings that got sent out were stock standard default settings. This means that acceleration was very rapid with minimal throttle stick adjustment.

To improve slow speed performance you can modify the settings to open up the throttle range, this allows you to move the throttle stick more & accelerate less. It also makes riding at really slow speeds easier... 

These settings don't limit top speed. However, it might make speed control seem a little bit more sluggish when riding at top speed.

Programming the vesc is very easy and really worth it. I encourage you to try. You just need an angle usb (for example "A to down angle mini cable" from startech.com and follow the instructions from the VESC thread

@pierres   dont have a problem changing the vesc as there is a thread on that. What I am now assuming from reading the posts is the vesc wasnt programmed before it was shipped. Ive waited so long for the board, and just want it right like everyone else.

Agreed. It will apply to the next batch hopefully. Unfortunately, to enjoy our received boards safely now, some of us have no choice than going into the VESC ... For me, tweaking is part of the fun, DIY style. We may admit that the first batch is more an "almost Ready-to-Ride kit" than a mass commercial product. Anyway, given the power of the DUAL, it is like a race car, not for everyone.

YES, next batch of VESC will have the Vertical USB receptacle so we can better access it when the VESC are mounted in the Raptor.

I'd vote for a **micro USB**, or USB Type-C, connection if that's an option *in addition to placing it vertically*. I think mini USB feels dated. Personally I have many more other types of USB cables around than the mini USB type at this point.

here is a sample of the Pure Class Fiber Lid. It will come with grip tape. But i am looking at some other options too. Ill no more tomorrow.

Any details you can share yet? I know this is a lot to keep up with. I don't expect you to be like me sitting around consuming every piece of information about these first batch Raptors. You've got lots going on. I know. Still, I'm curious about the lid. It's hard for me to tell what it looks like from the picture, but it seems like a black fiber glass, **no carbon look, right?** I'm thinking I would like to have the carbon look. If you don''t have a solution, I'm wondering if I can apply the grip myself? I might want to apply some 3M DI-NOC (or other shiny) Carbon Fiber Vinyl before the grip to match the original look.

```
A tutorial video was provided by Onloop (Jason) further back in this thread, but it won't help you with the values.  The reason this issue exists is that the remotes have slight manufacturing variances, causing **some** of the remotes to exhibit touchy behavior with the "default" settings.  The fix is to CUSTOMIZE the settings in the VESC based on the actual values the remote is sending, so that the 2 are "matched."  Therefore the values that worked for me may not work as well for you.

That said, the values are very easy to derive.  Watch the aforementioned video to understand what to do and how to get some initial values that are closer, then experiment a bit to get them dialed in.

I am very happy with my board now.  So happy in fact, I'm going to do another one (just waiting to find out if Nasty is going to take Jason up on the refund).  I liked it out of the box, but it was a tad scary for me (it is my first eboard).  Customizing the settings in the VESC has made it almost perfect.  I do think there is still some room for improvement in regards to the user experience with the remote (I won't go into detail here), and based on what I've seen and heard, additional improvements do seem likely in the near future.

This reminds me a lot of the early Android days; back when the user experience wasn't as good as IOS.  It wasn't long before it was dialed in and offered a user experience more equivlaent to IOS ( and even making some advances!), while still maintaining a high degree of user control and the ability to customize.  I think the same will happen here as well.

I'm a happy customer as well!
The board is amazing AFTER some tweaking of the pulse thing in the bldc tool.
I really recommend it because it's easy and a game changer!
The problem is not that the VESCs aren't programmed correctly. The last minute choice to the other controller creates these problems. They differ in the pulse width and that something Jason hasn't expected.
I can't criticize him for that!
If you have problems with the receiver drill some holes in the lid. It makes a difference and you will get a new one so fuck it up like me.

Another thing I will do, is to change all the screws to VA ones. I bought all screws and nuts twice for less then five euros. Remember I bought small amounts. Jason should do the same and use only non rusting bolts an nuts.

In the first row you can see the screws for the lid. I don't know why Jason use screwed with such a long thread. M4x6mm fits great and you have less work when you want to check the internals.
If someone is interested I can post a list with the needed ones.

I have now confirmed that the lid can be made with a CF style Glass Fiber material. It looks like CF but doesn't block signal.

Some people got pure CF & Some people got CF & Glass....

The problem is I have no record of that because the decks were not being serialised at that point.

I did notice a reduced signal (only worked when standing on the deck) in early days of production, hence the change to CF & GF - which in most cases works exceptionally.

However, I suppose it makes sense to completely remove the CF from the lid, It will not affect the structure of the deck in terms of the strength & it will allow long range control. This will also help diagnose future issues relating to signal or drop out. Problem solving is about eliminating possible cause.

The boards will be better now.

My understanding is that they don't last very long, but I expected better than 50 miles...

Your belts were probably not aligned, i had the same issue. If you spin the wheels manually, and you hear an obvious rubbing noise, then your belt is susceptible to overheating. Overheating the rubber will dramatically decrease the life of your belt.

p.s. both belts at the same time? that's odd...

I'm glad to see you striving for a more perfect battery solution. Obviously I don't have the experience you do. That said, I wonder about this type of switch. It seems this type of switch would be more likely to be accidentally switched off while riding a Raptor. It obviously is taller than the original switch. Also, the angle and placement seem pretty much ideal for switching of when mounting the board with my right foot. The Raptor lid isn't very thick. What is the remaining clearance between this switch and the top of your Cf board? I'm fairly sure you've thought this through and have decided this is the best solution. Could you share your thoughts for me and anyone thinking likewise.

Yes, you could potentially turn the battery off with your foot. You would need to put your foot very far up the board to do it, I suppose if you have a very narrow forward biased stance it could be a problem.

The reality is my options are limited. YES I would prefer a switch that is waterproof, slimline, sexy, fancy led lights, shock proof and uber reliable... but it seems they don't exist... at least not in the size i require it to be.

So i have had to go with a switch that has a very good reliability vs one that looks nice and seems to be rather unreliable (at least the last batch of them anyway)

[/quote]

Reliability, of course, is paramount. I feel reliability also means that the switch shouldn't be prone to shut off inadvertently regardless of stance. For me, my feet go on top of my boards anywhere I like. I don't like the idea of being limited in that regard. I can gladly give up the other niceties you've mentioned in favor of reliability in all it forms, including no risk of acedental shut off. 

Perhaps I'm wrong in thinking others would agree with me. So, let them speak up. If you disagree, tell me you're OK with a switch that would allow you to "potentially turn the battery off with your foot." Maybe you're a better rider than me and are 100% aware of your foot placement all the time and aren't bothered by taking care to avoid a particular area. If I'm wrong I'd like to know.

@onloop I know you're dedicated to putting out a great product with mass appeal at a reasonable price. I think all of us appreciate that, including me. I have no doubt you are doing your best. I also realize your options are more limited within your constraints, particularly time, as some people want their batteries NOW. Still, I ask that you consider the switch choice moving forward. Could this may be another case of not recognizing all  the various types of riders and ride types that your product might be used by or for? Similar to the uphill use and battery cutoff settings, could this switch be a non-issue for you, but a big enough deal (for enough others) to warrant some other solution?

Accidental shut off was my first thought when I saw the new switch, but in pushing my board around, I agree with Onloop that it's unlikely I'll ever be in a stance that narrow or that forward. For added peace of mind, I'll likely cut and glue a small piece of plastic equal to switch height to prevent accident shut off.

I'm wondering what you think about a variation of what @Dedbny has done with his clear dvd blank? Perhaps cutting a piece, of this or something else, to fit the lid hole, with a small hole for the charger and power switch would work. What do you think, would that be enough help against accidental shut off to warrant the effort? Maybe it wouldn't help or be needed at all... I had been thinking of using something like this over the LCD to prevent scratching anyhow. 

Previously I was thinking of using a waterproof zipper on the power port and switch hole. I thought that might be easy enough to install and use, while providing some protection from dirt and whatnot. My guess is this would make the potential for issues worse, not better, with this new switch. What do you think?

Yikes! Has any reason been sited for this? Does this apply to Switzerland too? If not, maybe shipping to Switzerland and then forwarding from there could be cost effective. I'd read in the news, today, that lithium batteries are no longer allowed in cargo shipments of *passenger* planes to the EU. I wonder if this is related to the price hike. If so, I hadn't imagined that there was so much cargo on passenger planes to cause this drastic an effect. 

You'd mentioned somewhere before the idea of a S.P.A.C.E. Cell Booster pack. Is there a work around the shipping issue, in the future, in that idea? Are smaller capacity batteries easier to ship? Maybe several much smaller packs that link up to for a large pack could be done.... Maybe that's not possible or cost effective.  It'd be cool though.  Having a brains pack, with power switch (and laser beams), BMS, power port, etc, able to connect to bosterpacks to provide 10S3P or 10S4P or other configurations. 

I hope you do see some serious money come your way, maybe via a Kickstarter, so that all your ideas can become reality.

What will you do with the space cells being replaced for Raptor customers in the USA due to faulty switches?  I ask because I'm in the USA (Colorado), and I'm reasonably talented with electronic work (I used to do electronic design and assembly).  If it would be helpful, I can retrofit those space cells with improved switches, without international shipping required.  If it's only 3-4 units, I'll be happy to volunteer my time.  For science, of course.  :blush:

Hi @onloop

I see you have a sale on Raptors. Can you list the changes made the second batch of Raptors over the first batch. (or if I've missed this just point me there)

Thanks

Changes are.

1. Different switch on battery, 5 people from 30 had and issue. (technically only 3 people have provided evidence - anyway 10% is too high)
2. No carbon fiber to be used in the lid, signal drop significantly beyond 1m due to CF
3. Custom tune each controller PPM settings, some people had very sensitive throttle response.
4. Improve QC process to ensure the basic things don't get missed, like checking the torque we put into each fixture. Some people had loose bolts.
5. Set the Soft-Low Voltage cut off in motor controller so that the Battery BMS doesn't hard cut power at end of battery capacity.
6. Vibration dampening material used between lid & main deck.


That's about it....

Some things to note in addition to onloops last post are posts #187, and #189. Also, for anyone considering a order now, the wheel pullies could be changed to a new injection molded type in future batches, though likely not the second batch. The handle on shipped Raptors is black, not blue as pictured in some places. The fast charger at a discount is an upgrade to the normal charger, and not in addition to it.

So much i hate to report a problem but I have the same problem.....
https://youtu.be/JX1I9EY-2xc
Everything was fine the last days and I rode the board some kilometers with no changes.
The only changes I made were the recommendations from onloop with higher current.
The happening:
I cruised downhill as it happened and noticed a change in the sound the board made. The drag got higher and the board went slower and I decided to stop to check everything. While slowing down I noticed as well that the brake force was reduced.
I checked for loose wires, sniffed for burned parts and if the motors were spinning free. All seemed fine so I hit the trigger while the wheels were in the air.
Only one motor was spinning and the other was cogging like in the video.
After I carried the board for four kilometers I decided to give it another try and switched it on, but the problem was still there.
It got heavy so I pushed it for 400 meters but the drag was to high to continue.
Board on remote on and another try.
I rode it 500 meters with nearly no throttle and when I tried to activate the brake slightly the wheel blocked. I removed the belts and kicked it home.
I'm afraid that I burned a motor but no smell and no heat from the strange one.
What shall I do now?
Thanks in advance.

Can you read your settings from both VESC? If not, why not? If do, does the information for both seem the same, or different? If not the same, did you try writing the same information from the master to the slave? You shouldn't have to do this, but it might clear up an issue....

I would say the problem is at the connection between the PCB itself & the connector. It probably needs more solder to build up the joint and make it stronger. If I had it here I would build up a solder bridge between the MOSFET legs & the connector. (one of the mosfet pins is isolated and should not be soldered together with the other pins.)

So found some time at work and measured the connections. Everything (resistance) looked the some on all six connections.
So I changed the motors to the other VESCs. The VESCs and the soldering looks fine but the cogging motor does the same with the other VESC 😁

Vesc with might loose connection on the working motor: https://youtu.be/Y7nqq7TKGRE


Working vesc with on the cogging motor: https://youtu.be/l_MJ34ztzdA

What bothers me most is that I removed the perfect sealed VESCs and all the other electronics to find out that the motor might is broken. Its hardcore to get them out.
Future Raptors should have a rubber gasket on the connector side and screwed electronics for better stability.

Another thing I will do, is to change all the screws to VA ones. I bought all screws and nuts twice for less then five euros.

Hey, great stuff! Want them, too! I love VA. And therefore I need you to post the list of the different kind of screws. Thanks!!!

Just a reminder on order 1550. I have a motor issue as well as the battery. I would much rather you just send me a motor than sending the whole board back. I can even send just the motor first and you guys can look it over before sending me one in return. I did fill out another issue about the motor on your spread sheet. Just haven't heard back from you in awhile. Thanks

It was a loose connection inside the motor. I played around with the wire on both the vesc and then the motor and when moving motor wire around it started working. Any it on your spread sheet

Replacing the motor is not very easy, there are lots of fiddly things, also you need to have heat shrink and hot glue to ensure the motor connectors don't vibrate loose. If you replace the motor and it's not done properly then any related fault that occurs (like the connections falling out) afterwards would be your responsibility. I am happy to help you through the process though.

ALSO, I would like to see the fault in case it is a problem with my factory not soldering the wires correctly on the inside.

Let me know what you want to do, the motor cable could just be plugged in, I recommend using some hot glue otherwise it can vibrate loose. 

I am not sure i understand how the mount is cooked. the photo doesn't clearly show it.

SO finally nice weather and I got the Raptor screws checked out I took it out. First impression, the Raptor is sick fast. Acceleration is quick and the only issue was occasional cutting out of the controller until I put my hand back closer to the board so I must have the full CF lid.

Mad thanks to @jacobbloy for taking the time to call me to walk me through the issues I had connecting my BLDC to my VESC's using a down adapter I found on B&H photo's website and made connecting to the VESC's painless for only $11-.  I finally got the necessary changes to the VESC's made and now I will be drilling holes in the CF cover (thanks @Tarzan for the idea)  till I get a more frequency transparent cover. (Jason @onloop you can even send it to @longhairedboy with the batch of batteries and then he can fwd to me if it saves you some money, I can wait.  

Observations with the new settings. 
I have to increase the braking to stop a Godzilla sized rider. Overshot the turn after decreasing to recommend changes (not enough force to slow 132kg down a 16% down slope). 
When going 41.76km/h down a 6 degree slope on numerous occasions I observed what appeared to be a temporary loss of motor control or safety shut down or something that changed the characteristics of the ride which surprised me. It was only about I'd estimate a 10% or so perceived change of force but little surprising first time it happened. Any input would be appreciated.
I changed to Bones hard durometer bushings as the original ones were way to soft for Godzilla. Better but I still have a little speed wobble.
Acceleration is little slower but much improved, maybe I'll adjust it later if I get used to it.

Overall just a thrill every time I go for a ride. Looking forward to many more adjustments saved profiles and hopefully soon a bluetooth app which lets me change things on the road. Thank you all for everyones passion to make the most fun electric vehicles out there better and better everyday.

The new non-CF lids are nearly done, it's a very close match, but to the trained eye i think you can tell its not a perfect carbon fiber match.

But like one of my customers said, function over form is important for this.

Looks like a dead vesc or the motor connectors are broken off, or both. your board had the motor fall off right? this damage to vesc may have happened when your motor fell off and now due to vibrations the motor connectors have come away from the PCB. 

For now you could remove the belt on the side that doesn't work.

Probably need to just replace the VESC.

you can send the board for repair. or try to fix it yourself.

Well sure, but that's why I sent it in the first time. So that it could be "fixed tested and good to go", like you said. Should I send it to the same guy, and send you another shipping charge? I can fix some things but installing a vesc is not one.

We can only fix the problems that are present at the time, technically this problem has only just occurred so we could not have fixed it before. However there is a chance that it is related.

Also, if you decide to send it back try to use the same shipping method that was used when we returned it to you, it was like $55 but when you sent it the first time you paid $130ish. I am happy to offer a $60 credit to cover the return shipping.

5. is there a red light on the Receiver?
6. Is the remote charged?

@onloop, looks like a faulty fuse connection. The bulk caps get charged and keeps everything on, but as soon as he gives it some throttle, everything shut off, including the vescs

My guess would be the fuse holder or the fuse is not well seated.

the new lids are finally done, it took a while to get it right...

It's a very close match to the normal CF look, there will be no RF signal deterioration. Also we added some dampening material to reduce noise & vibrations

ALL raptor owners get one sent out free of charge. it will take time to manage the logistics... Got to get parts shipped halfway across the globe a few times...

Holy crap, you are amazing, @onloop!!!

I've been beset with blegh weather this past week here in Colorado, with a blizzard followed up with wetness and cold.  Finally got back out on the mighty Raptor today, and was all giggles!  The only trouble I've encountered once taming the VESC settings and tightening up one screw, has been the dropouts, and it's not even that bad (simply have to hold the controller just right).  I ride goofy, so the receiver is likely blocked by my heel and calf.  Oh, and the griptape likes to peel up a bit -- will fix that with a trip to the hardware store for stronger glue.

This thing draws stares from *everyone*!  The best comment I overheard was after a cruised past a couple of dudes -- one said to the other, "SIIIICK!!!"  :sunglasses:

Indeed man, this thing is Da Bomb.  Thanks for making one helluva board.

I tried to be patient and wait for the fiberglass lid, but the dropouts with my early-edition Raptor were starting to feel dodgy as I embarked upon bigger hills.  So ummm, I put my baby under the knife.  :anguished:

I used a Dremel to cut about a 1 inch square hole in the lid, directly above the receiver.  I then fashioned a piece of black plexiglass to fit perfectly, and glued it in place with an acetone-based glue.  The result is night-and-day!  Just that one little bit of radio-transparent material is enough to make the dropouts nearly nonexistent.  Life is good.  :sunglasses:

Twice now I've had one motor go down while riding. Nothing particular happening prior to motor going down, just normal riding. Each time I've resolved the issue by turning the board off and on. Hasn't really bothered me since it was so easily solved, but I would like to know what's causing it. Motor wires don't seem loose and I feel like if it was a loose wire it would happen more often. Heel side motor which is attached to slave VESC. Welcome any ideas or suggestions for trouble shooting...

I've had the same trouble, twice now.  The right-side motor (heel side for me; I ride goofy), which I think is the slave VESC, stops working.  Turning the board off and then back on fixes it.  I haven't been riding aggressively at all, just puttering along at maybe 10mph.  Strange.

Upon further thought, each time it happened for me I was going down hill leaving my house...likely had a full battery, but I'm not positive. Could this be a VESC shut off to avoid regen overcharge? Seems like that would shut off both motors...the hill is pretty small and I never slam on the brakes.

And btw, the raptor ist stupid fast, i love it...
I just adjusted the throttle so it is 50% on Center and the brakes. After the litte changes it is very easy to manage the speed. Even slow driving. 
But i think about to Limit the power, because my skill Level is Not allowing me to drive this fast.
Also i didn't use the cruise control, because it is Hard to Presse at the Same time as i use the throttle. But thx for the great board

Hey @onloop I'm still suffering dropouts and anxiously awaiting a fiberglass lid.  If it hasn't shipped yet, I might put my CF lid under the knife for a far more extensive mod.  :confused:  Thanks!

I got the Fiber Glass Lids 2 days ago, but they are about 0.3mm thinner than expected.... I am seriously pissed after waiting 2 months...

I am not sure if i will send them. Waiting for the factory to give me an ETA to remake them at the correct thickness

sorry, this should be a small one; i have to tighten the belt now and bought a nut wrench for this. but it's still too big to be able to turn. from the raptor maintenance video i learned i have to tighten these  screws, right?:

You pre tighten (quite tight but not thight enough to lock) one of the 3 bolts, then pivot the motor up down till the belt stretches. Once you are happy bolt tight all of them.

Possibly the motor mount, but you might try a short ride to see if it corrects...mine did. If not then a very slight adjustment to motor mount should correct.

i don't see how that can affect the position of the belt though so that it won't touch the wheel. what am i missing?

Hey @onloop I'm having trouble with what seems to be a loose connection or an intermittent short (big spark!) in the left-side motor in my Raptor.  When the problem occurs, I get cogging instead of propulsion, and all joy ceases. :-( 

Otherwise, I'm in the midst of a very saucy love affair with this thing, and loathe to suffer a Raptor outage while it goes in for service.

Would it be possible for me to simply buy another motor, and send the problem child in for service?  That'd give me a spare, keep me surfing concrete, and gain you a motor sale.  You like?

I'm happy to do the motor swap myself.  I'm halfway tempted to simply tear the motor apart and fix it!

Thanks for a helluva ride,

 - Fred

You could prob do it if you know what exactly the issue is with the motor... I'd check the connection between the vesc and the phase wires as see if one has jiggled loose...if it's a r-spec issue ... That's a diffrent story

@fredx  If the spark is in the motor, it is likely a motor short causing problems. 

Please email us on the "contact us" section of our website, and if you could include a picture of where the spark is accusing that'd be great as well. Make sure your picture is under 1mb for us to view it in our email client. 

Once we have a good idea of what's causing the problem, we will make sure to get your Raptor up and running ASAP!

Hey @onloop / @EnertionSupport here's a video of the problem:

[Enertion R-Spec motor failure](https://youtu.be/XwXZ-N2dzXo)

I think you're right, that it's an intermittent short.  It looks to me like the phase wires are shorting, possibly due to vibration wearing the enamel away.

You'll see in your ordering system that I ordered a replacement motor last Friday, with expedited shipping.  When I receive that, I'll swap motors and send you this one for repair or replacement.  In the meantime, I'm going to try dabbing a little bit of JB Weld in between the phase wires to see if that'll help the motor survive a little longer...

Cheers,

 - Fred

It's a little hard to see in that photo, but the two phase wires were shorting out and intermittently welding, as identified by the charred and melted copper and burnt enamel.

I'm surprised that these enamel wires are left to vibrate against each other, but I guess this problem I encountered must be rare?

Anyway, yeah, let's replace this motor.

Thanks,

 - Fred

So, has anyone else received their replacement lid yet? I have and I am disappointed. The screw holes, on mine, are not countersunk, so all the lid screw's stick up from the board if you try to use the lid. The original lid's holes where countersunk to support flush mounting of the screws. I'm wondering if mine was a lone oversight or if all the lids are like this.

```
I do. That said, I won't have what I own for several weeks. I've recently moved from Switzerland to the United States. The majority of my things are in a container crossing the Atlantic. When it arrives in the US I will be storing it until my new home is complete.  So, in the meantime I don't even have a screwdriver. Recently I had to build a "no tools required" Chinchilla cage with a can opener and the railing of a stairway...

To me, that's all besides the point. I wasn't expecting this, and so I wasn't prepared for it. I would like to think it's a one off mistake, but I'm curious to know if anyone else has the same issue. That, and possibly helping others be prepared, is why I posted the question and pictures.

This was a complete package that is supposed to be ready to run. So, all the tools that are supposed to be required where shipped with the board. Basically, that was a skate tool and some Allen wrenches. Nothing was sent to make countersunk holes . Therefore, when I brought the board with me over to the U.S. I didn't bring any such tools either. Additionally, I'm not sure I could successfully modify the holes with out cracking or splintering the material, as it seems fairly brittle, even if I had all my tools.

Anyhow, I have no doubt Enertion will make it right. The only reason I have a new lid is because Jason wants to take care of his customers. It's just a shame that this was overlooked given that it's already shipped after having been delayed longer than anyone (including Jason) would have liked.

I would have to agree ... I don't think it is unreasonable to expect the replacement lid to have those details...like counter sunk holes... 

I have a feeling it was an over sight by the maker...I wonder if @onloop even knows abt it...Have you mention this to @EnertionSupport?

I have a separate issue in with support now. I'm sure it will take a while.  When they reply to that I include this information if it's not responded to, here, before then. I'm not worried about it being dealt with. I'm sure it will be made right in the end. It just might take some time before it's resolved, and I can accept that. I knew it was a small business before I bought the thing, so it's to be expected to some degree. I'm happy their growing. Some growing pains, within reason, are understandable.

I had a similar issue with my mono raptor as well. I'm surprised that there isn't any kind of insulator on the wire connection like some shrink tube. There's a lot of play and vibration at that point of connection. I had a new motor put on and believe I'm having the same issue. My biggest concern is that it might damage the vesc. I have a DIY board that I built with a turnigy sk3 and have been riding it for 8 months with no issues. Sorry had a lose motor mount once.

The holes are not meant to be countersunk on the new lids, the countersunk holes were very close to the edge and i felt it weakened the cover with the extra material being removed.

The new lids were meant to be sent out with new stainless steel screws.... but it was forgotten about.

I can arrange to send them out to everyone, otherwise go to your local hardware store & buy M4*8 Button head screws

Given the advice from Enertion that the new lid is not counter sunk.  Do you actually experience any drop out on remote when riding with carbon lid.   I always had remote low,  so no real issues. 

Dont like the screws sticking out. Maybe dome heads would look better. 

@onloop just to let you know Ive had my fibre lid countersunk. No issues,  but appreciate when looking at it that you thought it could be an issue not having enough meat to edge for longevity.

I didn't know which thread to put this question in, so I'll just give it a go here. Which kind of tools do you use to tighten the bolts to ajust the belt? I've tried with a 10mm spinner, but it seems like it's too big. That means that the bolt will get ruined after some time. What do you use?
I'm from Denmark btw, don't know if we got different sizes of tools.
